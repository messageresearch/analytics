[20:43] do a prayer request now yesterday I met
[20:50] family and Copley and their 18 year old
[20:52] son is in heavy use of marijuana and
[20:54] he's left the house so let's pray for
[20:56] him I told the father that we'll set up
[20:59] a day of prayer and fasting and whoever
[21:00] can fast that day we couldn't fast to
[21:02] bring this 18 year old home he's a
[21:04] senior but that's usually the the
[21:08] gateway drug is marijuana and then when
[21:10] you get to that and they do all these
[21:12] all crazy drugs and so we're just crying
[21:14] out you know God will deliver this 18
[21:19] year old boy from such awful destruction
[21:22] of Satan so let's just pray for that
[21:24] also brother John has a surgery on
[21:26] Tuesday let's remember him in prayer by
[21:28] the grace of Lord I've asked him
[21:29] numerous times if there's anything we
[21:31] can do to help out so please let me know
[21:32] there's anything we can do I know your
[21:33] wife might need the help but please let
[21:35] me know if there's anything we can do by
[21:37] the grace of God he'll have a total hip
[21:38] replacement and we just believe it's the
[21:41] hand of God that God has allowed him to
[21:42] be able to have that you know and when
[21:46] you remember he gave his testimony kind
[21:47] of member of the story behind his hip in
[21:48] the car accident and so forth but just
[21:51] the grace of God that he can have this
[21:53] hip replaced here and trust me a good
[21:56] time of healing for him by the grace of
[21:57] Lord trust God to bring the healing also
[22:01] my brother Simon he asked all of us to
[22:03] pray just for unspoken requests he's
[22:05] kind of going through a battle he and I
[22:06] talked about last night on the phone
[22:07] it's kind of personal but he's really

[22:11] just kind of like a mind battle and
[22:13] different things so I could really sense

[37:07] our Bibles this morning I like to open
[37:09] up to proverbs chapter 1 I'd like to
[37:11] begin a little series on wisdom by the
[37:14] grace of Lord I still have one more
[37:17] service I want to preach on the later
[37:18] scene church age so probably look at
[37:20] that maybe on Wednesday I've just been
[37:24] feeling led to go to the Book of
[37:25] Proverbs lately and Ecclesiastes and
[37:27] perhaps Jobe will see what the Lord
[37:30] allows here just kind of feeling that of
[37:33] the Lord I think you'll see what see
[37:38] what I mean at the end of this sermon
[37:40] I'm just going to share some of the
[37:41] things we were talking about last Sunday
[37:43] at Giant Eagle we're talking about a few
[37:45] things but I want to kind of just lay a
[37:47] little foundation this morning and then
[37:50] begin looking at the wisdom in the Book
[37:52] of Proverbs by God's grace so very
[37:54] thankful for the word of the Lord this
[37:56] morning and good to see the Saints in
[37:59] the house of Lord proverbs chapter 1
[38:06] [Music]
[38:16] Rober chapter 1 verse 1 the Proverbs of
[38:22] Solomon the son of David king of Israel
[38:26] to know wisdom and instruction to
[38:28] perceive the words of understanding to
[38:32] receive the instruction of wisdom
[38:35] justice and judgment and equity to give
[38:40] subtility to the simple to young man
[38:44] knowledge and discretion a wise man will
[38:48] hear and will increase learning and a
[38:51] man of understanding shall attain unto
[38:53] wise counsels to understand a proverb
[38:56] and the interpretation the words of the
[39:00] wise and their dark sayings
[39:03] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[39:05] wisdom but fools despise wisdom and
[39:08] instruction
[39:09] I like verse 10 my son if sinners entice
[39:15] the consent thou not that's just bar
[39:18] heads in word of Prayer ask the Lord
[39:20] here to minister if you ever need on
[39:22] your heart just make it unto God as we
[39:23] pray Heavenly Father we've opened this
[39:25] divinely inspired book we know every
[39:28] word Lord God is inspired it's God
[39:30] breathed Lord you've anointed men of God
[39:34] to write this book and given it to us we
[39:37] know there is profound wisdom inside of
[39:39] this book in every page but Lord
[39:41] especially here in the books of wisdom
[39:43] Lord speak to us this morning Lord God I
[39:45] believe numerous thoughts I've had in
[39:48] just studies Lord I've just felt felt
[39:51] you leading me Lord to this book so I
[39:54] just pray you'd guide me by the Holy
[39:56] Spirit Lord God and may it be a blessing
[39:58] to your people father for we all want to
[40:00] be wise Lord God none of us want to be
[40:02] foolish we want to be wise Lord God so
[40:05] help us this morning Lord to understand
[40:07] the Word of God and help us to have
[40:10] wisdom with that word that you've given
[40:12] to us we ask you to meet every need now
[40:14] in Jesus Christ's name never said Amen
[40:17] god bless you to be in season praise the
[40:19] Lord so Malachi can switch over there
[40:32] buddy we've got some quotes and things
[40:33] want to show I just kind of want to do a
[40:35] an outline this morning and maybe like a
[40:38] summary and then I want to close with
[40:39] just some of those thoughts the
[40:41] revelations I feel like God has shown me
[40:43] in the book of Proverbs by God's grace
[40:46] I'm not really preached on it you know
[40:49] I'm sorry I think I plugged in the wrong
[40:51] adapter here pardon me never really
[40:54] preached you know through this book but
[40:55] I'd like to begin preaching through this
[40:58] book if the Lord would help me this
[41:00] morning so I want to let's look at a
[41:04] introduction here to proverbs and I like
[41:09] to use slides because it kind of slows
[41:11] me down kind of try to say sometimes
[41:14] like going too fast and I just kind of
[41:15] want to slow
[41:16] and emphasize different thoughts so
[41:19] that's what I love about PowerPoint it
[41:21] slows me down you know I've just in a
[41:23] hurry to I always have so much to say
[41:25] but this kind of forces me to slow down
[41:27] and not I like that you know there's
[41:31] importance to the proverbs they're
[41:35] divinely inspired we know they are
[41:38] actually God's guide for our daily lives
[41:41] which actually guide us to eternal life
[41:45] we're supposed to take these proverbs
[41:47] and apply them everyday and then that
[41:50] makes a way that makes a guide for us to
[41:53] go to heaven to be with Christ
[41:55] it's proverbs is quite clear on this
[41:57] where it says the way of life is above
[42:00] to the wise that he may depart from Hell
[42:04] beneath so the Bible plainly states it
[42:07] there to depart from Hell is to choose
[42:10] the way of wisdom barmy
[42:15] and I love this she is a tree of life to
[42:18] them that lay upon her so when a
[42:21] Christian really has the wisdom of God
[42:23] and this is what we're gonna you know
[42:25] we're gonna emphasize again and again
[42:26] the wise Virgin will have all these
[42:29] proverbs manifesting in her life
[42:32] the foolish virgin will have some of
[42:35] them but she's going to miss out on
[42:36] certain of them that deal with the
[42:38] baptism of the holy ghost of course but
[42:40] it makes it a tree of life and brother
[42:42] Branham said over and over again but one
[42:43] time in particular in marriage in
[42:45] divorce he said that Christ is the Tree
[42:48] of Life so wisdom is personified as a
[42:51] woman how many brothers know your wife
[42:53] is very wise y'all better raise your
[42:55] hand
[42:56] she's a tree of life God uses a woman to
[42:59] represent wisdom
[43:01] there's something about a woman's
[43:02] personality that God built and formed to
[43:07] be very wise to be analytical to examine
[43:10] things to understand things and I was
[43:13] look at this thing to some research I
[43:15] don't have it in front of me is from
[43:16] Michael Hyatt I really like some things
[43:18] he says he's just like a motivational
[43:20] speaker but it kind of motivates me to
[43:21] be more diligent but he was saying
[43:23] there's some research that shows how you
[43:25] know men and women's brains are
[43:26] different you know men's brains more
[43:28] focus on the
[43:29] possibilities and and taking risk
[43:31] whereas a woman's mind is more
[43:33] analytical and more thinking about the
[43:36] details and that's definitely true in my
[43:39] marriage there's definitely true my wife
[43:41] thinks that things are really well you
[43:43] know very thoroughly through whereas I
[43:45] just kind of like to I'll just go with
[43:47] that you know I see the direction I want
[43:49] to go and I don't think about the
[43:50] details maybe but its personified as a
[43:54] woman now and we're gonna see there's
[43:56] many types here you can type it to an
[43:57] individual woman but you can also type
[44:00] it to the bride of Jesus Christ the
[44:02] Church of Jesus Christ is like a tree of
[44:05] life amen
[44:06] I'm gonna glad when you come to our
[44:08] church you can hear the words of eternal
[44:10] life you will hear part of it you know
[44:12] you hear some things at other churches
[44:14] that don't believe the message you know
[44:16] here's part of it but here we're
[44:18] supposed to get a whole loaf of wisdom
[44:21] oh not just a slice we're supposed to
[44:24] have a whole loaf of the eternal wisdom
[44:27] of God Almighty I'm glad we got an amen
[44:29] hallelujah we have it by the grace of
[44:33] God how do you know because you can look
[44:36] at the lives of those who are living off
[44:38] wisdom you know give every person the
[44:40] word test give you yourself the word
[44:42] test examine yourselves according to the
[44:45] word not according to other people but
[44:47] when we look at ourselves align
[44:49] ourselves look with God's Word we can
[44:51] look at other lives and say my there no
[44:53] they don't have this wisdom that God is
[44:54] offering and God is graciously offering
[44:57] this wisdom he is we'll get to that in
[44:59] Chapter 1 in just a moment let us keep
[45:01] looking here now here's why it's
[45:02] important to you and I as well other
[45:04] than eternal life if we are the wise
[45:07] virgins our lives should be centered
[45:10] around the wisdom of Proverbs because
[45:13] we're wise virgins that's what we're
[45:15] called by Jesus wisdom of course is the
[45:18] first gift of the Holy Ghost needed to
[45:21] manage the other gifts so wisdom is so
[45:24] crucial to the Bride of Christ who has
[45:26] the gifts operating charity those first
[45:29] needed before wisdom so you really must
[45:31] be born again that makes you wise virgin
[45:34] and then if you have that Holy Spirit
[45:36] seal inside of you then you'll take that
[45:39] wisdom that's a part of that Co a part
[45:42] of that
[45:43] Europe and you apply it to every gift of
[45:45] God in our myths amen
[45:48] wisdom has to manage every all the other
[45:51] eight and this is beautiful as we'll get
[45:54] to it kind at the end the climax or
[45:57] culmination of proverbs is this mature
[46:01] fruitful rare woman of wisdom the Bible
[46:06] says who can find a woman like this and
[46:08] when I preach on that I'm gonna probably
[46:09] reach on the next set well not whether
[46:11] there ought to be your next Sunday so
[46:12] the Sunday after I don't want the
[46:15] sisters would be discouraged I'm sure
[46:16] you've read proverbs 31 before I don't
[46:18] want you be discouraged because you've
[46:19] got to see her as she's a woman she
[46:21] represents the church this is what the
[46:23] church as a whole will be will produce
[46:26] if she's got the wisdom of God in her
[46:28] life and this is and for one woman to
[46:32] accomplish that it's possible but it's
[46:33] very rare so it's it's something that is
[46:37] something that should encourage us look
[46:38] how much God can use a woman if she's
[46:41] yield to the Spirit amen but it's not
[46:45] these things aren't to discourage this
[46:46] looks just like the life of Christ
[46:47] shouldn't discourage us brothers
[46:49] you know what Christ never felt a lust
[46:51] or Christ never I could never be like
[46:53] Christ that shouldn't discourage us but
[46:55] we should look at his victories and say
[46:57] my if he overcome that then he can help
[46:59] me overcome that he's the sakr of all
[47:02] those who need help amen he overcame it
[47:06] for my sake amen hallelujah so we've got
[47:10] to understand that that this is
[47:14] therefore our our it's like our goal
[47:17] this is what we're shooting for is this
[47:19] mature Christian who who can hear the
[47:22] voice of God who has the mind of Christ
[47:24] amen
[47:25] which we're gonna see that's very
[47:26] similar to wisdom is the mind of Christ
[47:28] the Holy Ghost these are kind of
[47:30] synonymous things here now the author of
[47:34] course was Solomon he says it in chapter
[47:36] 1 verse 1 in chapter 10 verse 1 he's the
[47:39] author and he he gathered it's really
[47:41] striking he gathered all this all these
[47:44] Proverbs and he placed them in this this
[47:47] book because that's what Ackley's yesyes
[47:49] 12:9 says the preacher was why's he
[47:52] still taught the people knowledge yeah
[47:54] he yeah he gave good he
[47:56] and sought out and set in order many
[47:59] proverbs so sow there's a time of
[48:02] Solomon's life where he was just
[48:03] collecting wisdom all the time he
[48:05] collected he write it down collected you
[48:07] tell his scribes write this down file it
[48:09] for me
[48:09] keep this don't use this I'm gonna need
[48:12] this later he was just collecting he was
[48:15] a collector of wisdom I'll tell you the
[48:17] greatest collection of wisdom we have it
[48:19] right here the word of the Lord we have
[48:21] to look very far we have to go on the
[48:22] internet and search for wisdom so much
[48:24] you can but any wisdom out there's got
[48:26] to be backed up right here because this
[48:29] is the whole Council of God amen so he
[48:34] was one that was searching out and
[48:35] setting in order and and looking for
[48:38] wisdom and God gave it to him because we
[48:40] know he asked for it because he said
[48:42] Behold I've done a cord to thy words you
[48:43] know he was offered money and he's
[48:45] offered anything you want somebody said
[48:46] give me an understanding heart that I
[48:49] might judge your people he said I've
[48:51] given thee a wise and understanding
[48:52] heart so that there is none like thee
[48:54] before they neither after thee shall any
[48:56] arise like unto thee what man outside of
[49:01] Jesus Christ could write a book as
[49:03] inspired as the proverbs 31 chapters of
[49:07] just golden nuggets of truths that we
[49:10] all need to listen to and obey no man
[49:13] has ever written because no man was
[49:15] wiser than Solomon outside of Christ no
[49:17] one could write such an inspired book
[49:19] God anointed him to collect all this
[49:23] wisdom write down this knowledge for our
[49:25] sake today amen that's why I wrote it
[49:28] down
[49:28] the Bible says see the Proverbs of
[49:30] Solomon doesn't mean that you know he
[49:33] had everyone these ones you know was
[49:36] just originally from him it wasn't like
[49:38] that no doubt maybe some of them were
[49:40] but the scripture tells us he had over
[49:43] 3,000 proverbs 3,000 and now you know
[49:47] there's not three thousand verses you
[49:48] know well there might be I have to check
[49:49] that out there might be there might be
[49:52] three thousand verses in Proverbs I
[49:53] don't know that's I've to add those up I
[49:55] doubt it
[49:57] but he says look here more in first
[49:59] Kings four and God gave Solomon wisdom
[50:02] and understanding exceeding much
[50:03] enlarged nosov heart even as a sand that
[50:06] is on the seashore
[50:10] his wisdom excelled the wisdom of all
[50:11] the children of the East country and all
[50:13] the wisdom of Egypt for he was wiser
[50:16] than all men then Ethan the Ezra hide
[50:19] and he Manon and chow call and Darla the
[50:22] sons of Mahal and his fame was in all
[50:25] nations round about and he spake three
[50:31] thousand proverbs and his songs were a
[50:35] thousand and five this man was just
[50:37] receiving inspiration all the time he
[50:39] imagined three thousand thoughts and
[50:41] then I thought I was a hundred songs I
[50:43] was a thousand songs a thousand songs
[50:47] just about the glory of God the wisdom
[50:49] of God the instruction of God and His
[50:53] wisdom went to all all extremes
[50:57] he had wisdom from trees he had wisdom
[51:00] from a common weed called hyssop he
[51:03] learned wisdom from beasts he learned
[51:05] wisdom from the birds and creeping
[51:06] things and fishes he had wisdom he could
[51:09] gain wisdom from anything and that
[51:10] reminds us of brother Brad and I said my
[51:12] first Bible was what nature and there
[51:16] came of all people to hear the wisdom of
[51:17] Solomon from all kings of the earth
[51:19] which had heard of his wisdom now if
[51:23] you'd like I have this little I thought
[51:24] that Bible I bought last year with the
[51:26] gift cards it has all these divisions
[51:29] and it shows you where all these
[51:30] different things are so the topics are
[51:33] organized by category on these printouts
[51:36] I have so if you want to learn about
[51:37] anger there's this little printout to
[51:39] tell you right where to find anger you
[51:40] can find something similar I'm sure on
[51:41] the internet but look look how much that
[51:44] proverbs covers anger anxiety bitterness
[51:47] desire jealousy grief sadness all these
[51:50] human emotions healing hope joy delight
[51:52] rejoicing love hate panic dread
[51:55] separation shame the human spirit
[51:57] friends neighbors strangers enemies and
[51:59] dynamics of relationships all this is
[52:02] covered in proverbs if we're willing to
[52:04] look for it our tongues in our bodies
[52:08] the longevity of our bodies the strength
[52:10] our body bones the head gray hair our
[52:13] face eyes ears mouth tongues lips neck
[52:16] hand heart foot you can gain wisdom from
[52:18] all these body parts and God has a
[52:21] purpose for all of them nobody likes the
[52:23] gray hair
[52:24] proudly but there's wisdom in that gray
[52:26] hair that gray hair speaks to something
[52:29] and then the godly traits you can find
[52:32] the Blessed that how God covers us he
[52:34] conceals a sin discerning judicious
[52:37] astute discretion fear glory being even
[52:41] being you know centered even with the
[52:43] word street-level humble lowly meek
[52:45] integrity blameless wholeness learning
[52:48] instruction practical wisdom prudence
[52:50] purity righteousness to be satisfied
[52:52] with God understanding upright integrity
[52:55] and marital faithfulness and then
[52:58] there's the ungodly traits the
[52:59] abominations horrible deeds backsliders
[53:02] the boorish the brutish the stupid the
[53:04] Bible calls it cruel deceitful deceiving
[53:08] enticing evil fools gluttony drinking
[53:10] perverse pride reproach scoffers scorn
[53:13] or shame simple-minded sins traitors
[53:16] treacherous vanity vengeance wicked the
[53:19] viciousness offense and adultery and if
[53:23] you want know about economics they have
[53:24] justice injustice poverty wealth work
[53:26] work habits occupation business business
[53:29] practices borrowing lending inheritance
[53:32] possessions properties lotteries farming
[53:35] it gets into political matters about
[53:37] political justice injustice war those in
[53:40] authority goes into nature with creation
[53:42] water birds animals weather storms
[53:45] silver gold jewels even goes into cities
[53:48] and towns and then principles of
[53:51] commandments councils guidance secret
[53:53] counsel discipline goodness grace
[53:55] justice injustice knowledge law mercy
[53:58] name the reputation peace rebuke
[54:01] scolding truth lies wisdom in our word
[54:04] day men he was more wise than all the
[54:09] kings of Egypt he knew what God wanted
[54:12] for political matters amen God knew what
[54:16] we can learn from nature and showed it
[54:17] to Solomon he had principles God wanted
[54:22] us to know God wants us to know these
[54:23] things God wants us to apply this advice
[54:27] to our lives but as we as we've known as
[54:31] I preach out at a couple years ago the
[54:33] sad thing about Solomon Solomon had all
[54:35] this as the sand of the sea but he
[54:37] ultimately left the beach can I say like
[54:39] that he was enjoying life at the beach
[54:42] like you all do on vacation like to go
[54:45] down to the beach but he spiritually
[54:47] left that beach he left the wisdom for
[54:49] the sake of his wives I don't want I
[54:52] don't want you to miss that he had all
[54:54] this wisdom at his disposal all these
[54:56] gifts all these truths all these
[54:59] understandings all this instruction but
[55:02] he turned from it but for the sake of
[55:04] his wives to please his wives
[55:08] he loved many strange women the Bible
[55:11] says God had not God see God even gave a
[55:13] warning God said these women are going
[55:16] to turn your hearts away in first Kings
[55:18] verse 11 and the seven hundred wives and
[55:22] princesses 300 concubines his wives
[55:25] turned away his heart so he could have
[55:29] all this the sand of the sea as far as
[55:31] wisdom and all the other glory and the
[55:34] promises behind it but he eventually
[55:36] kind of got old to him he let the word
[55:39] of God become common to him God help us
[55:43] to not let the beach become common to us
[55:45] remember the story brother mantle what's
[55:47] so special about the beach I've seen him
[55:49] for 40 years what's so special about
[55:51] your church I've been going there for 10
[55:52] years
[55:53] it's not us it's special it's the word
[55:55] is special it's your credit though your
[55:58] walk with God that's special it's the
[56:00] presence of Christ in your life that's
[56:02] special amen and you've got to keep it
[56:05] special I'll see you grieve him and then
[56:07] he leaves your life his influence in
[56:09] your life will leave if you don't keep
[56:11] it special but we've got to keep it
[56:13] special it keeps going and says it came
[56:17] to pass when he was old his wives turned
[56:18] away his heart after other gods his
[56:21] heart was not perfect with the Lord his
[56:22] God as David David just failed in one
[56:26] manner Bathsheba every other thing he
[56:28] kept he went after asterisk the goddess
[56:33] of the zidonians milcom the abomination
[56:36] of the hammerites
[56:37] and Solomon did evil in the sight of the
[56:39] Lord and went not fully after the Lord
[56:41] as did David his father so much wisdom
[56:45] 3000 proverbs he could live from he can
[56:48] pull strength from 3000 different
[56:50] sources
[56:51] but at the end of his life the women
[56:53] seem more interesting than the Word of
[56:55] God and yet he's seen God twice just
[56:59] like brother Branham saw Jesus try twice
[57:01] what a striking contrast between brother
[57:04] Branham and Salomon aha
[57:07] then did Salman bring in a high place
[57:09] for shamash the abomination of Moab can
[57:13] you imagine Jerusalem putting up
[57:15] building permits you know they come down
[57:18] to the temple to worship on a Sabbath
[57:19] day it's Saturday brother amen and his
[57:21] wife were walking down there to bring
[57:23] their lambs you know their offerings oh
[57:24] there's a building permit oh I wonder
[57:27] what Solomon's building today one of
[57:28] he's gonna add to the temple no it's
[57:31] it's a house of whoredom it's a house of
[57:34] spiritual heart it's a house of idols
[57:36] can you imagine the people right here's
[57:39] a man that love the Lord and yet he
[57:42] allowed repeated permit after permit
[57:45] after permit to all these houses of hell
[57:47] can I say like that abominations
[57:51] disgusting hateful loathsome things in
[57:54] the mind of God so it proves it's not so
[57:56] much what you have it's what you do with
[57:58] what you have that's why God will say
[58:01] foolish virgins than denominations
[58:03] that's why God will save Catholics it's
[58:04] what you do with what you have amen
[58:07] you're judged by what you do it's what
[58:10] you have he did this for all of his
[58:14] strange wives I don't know if that's you
[58:16] know I'm not sure how many houses that
[58:18] was but amongst a thousand wives how
[58:21] many different gods because you have the
[58:22] Bible said he built a house for all of
[58:25] their gods and yet he had all this
[58:28] wisdom like the sand of the sea so how
[58:32] did God feel about that angry anger you
[58:38] know Solomon was saved of course Jesus
[58:40] talks about the glory of Solomon and we
[58:42] know that he was buried with you know by
[58:43] David his father and so forth like this
[58:45] but it made God in a temporary sense
[58:47] angry with Solomon not to wrath but to
[58:53] his disobedience he was upset with
[58:55] Solomon's disobedience I've showed
[58:58] myself to you twice you've seen the pur
[59:00] glory of God twice you've asked for all
[59:03] this wisdom and then you asked
[59:05] or but then you do nothing with it my we
[59:09] must remember what we asked for we must
[59:11] be faithful with what we've asked for
[59:13] Church see wisdom is useless without
[59:17] application who has been given more
[59:22] wisdom than the people in the message
[59:23] who do you know as the Buddhists been
[59:26] given more wisdom Mahatma Gandhi has a
[59:29] how you say his name
[59:30] has he been given more wisdom than the
[59:32] people the message absolutely not
[59:34] because our our wisdom is thus saith the
[59:38] Lord our wisdom is the Bible the
[59:40] mysteries on the Bible the loose ends
[59:42] the confusion that's all been unwrapped
[59:44] although the seals have all been
[59:46] unwrapped and the loose ends have all
[59:48] been tied together and now the Bible
[59:51] makes sense and now we know what God
[59:52] expects but what are we doing with what
[59:56] he's given to us we have a great
[59:59] responsibility to apply and live this
[1:00:02] message that's what I love to live it
[1:00:05] that's what I love to see who will hang
[1:00:07] around who will hang around and live the
[1:00:10] message not just talk about it and not
[1:00:12] even just come to church but actually
[1:00:14] live it in every day of your life that's
[1:00:17] what I get excited about to see people
[1:00:19] who actually live what brother Branham
[1:00:20] said not just saying that's good and
[1:00:23] well I agree with it you know but who
[1:00:25] actually live what brother Branham said
[1:00:27] as it's written in the Bible that's what
[1:00:30] we're talking about not just brother man
[1:00:32] we talked about that last week 1977 you
[1:00:34] know not just things that he said but
[1:00:35] things that were actually in the
[1:00:36] scripture which was most of what he said
[1:00:40] now you get this wisdom here I'm sorry
[1:00:44] and what good are gifts if they're not
[1:00:46] consecrated completely to Almighty God
[1:00:47] what good is it to see God twice to have
[1:00:52] wisdom and proverbs as the sand of the
[1:00:54] sea what good is that to have access to
[1:00:56] the beach on your vacation if it rains
[1:00:58] the whole time or if you just don't want
[1:01:00] to go out because you rather sit in and
[1:01:02] watch TV or something but what good
[1:01:05] would that beach be it wouldn't do any
[1:01:07] good and so what good is what good is
[1:01:10] the message unless we're gonna be fully
[1:01:13] going after the message with all of our
[1:01:15] hearts so see that's what that's these
[1:01:18] are
[1:01:18] these thoughts I want to pull out from
[1:01:19] Proverbs he accumulated all this wisdom
[1:01:23] and he was for a while he's very
[1:01:24] faithful just pulling in all the wisdom
[1:01:26] but there came a spot when he stopped
[1:01:28] applying it to his life he thought that
[1:01:31] he was above the message praise the Lord
[1:01:34] he thought he's above that and I have so
[1:01:37] much peace and I've done so much
[1:01:39] forgotten I'm above that I don't have to
[1:01:41] live that anymore god help us to just
[1:01:43] remain humble that means below Christ
[1:01:46] not exalting are what we want above but
[1:01:49] just to remain just do what God says so
[1:01:53] hard to find humble people right we
[1:01:56] should be the most humble praise the
[1:01:57] Lord
[1:01:57] that's right now verses I'm sorry
[1:02:02] chapters 1 to 24 were all wisdom of
[1:02:06] Solomon that he wrote down during his
[1:02:09] days but the Bible tells us chapters 25
[1:02:12] to 29 just think this just like kind of
[1:02:14] like details about Proverbs I love
[1:02:16] seeing all these details in the
[1:02:17] scripture I never knew before so I had
[1:02:18] to share them with you they were
[1:02:21] collected and copied in Hezekiah time
[1:02:23] when Scofield pointed that out when I
[1:02:24] was reading his notes because the Bible
[1:02:27] says it's in Proverbs 25 these are also
[1:02:29] Proverbs of Solomon which the men of
[1:02:31] Hezekiah king of Judah copied out so
[1:02:34] these were copied out after Solomon died
[1:02:36] in the days of Hezekiah and then the
[1:02:39] Holy Spirit had them put you know
[1:02:40] chapters 1 to 24 together with chapters
[1:02:44] 25 to 29 and then chapters 30 and 31
[1:02:49] were by Egger and King Lemuel
[1:02:52] respectively so that's where we get
[1:02:55] that's that's how the book is brought
[1:02:56] together a 1 to 24 from Solomon than the
[1:03:00] Solomon wrote those down collected those
[1:03:02] and then in the days of Hezekiah they
[1:03:04] found these other Proverbs of Solomon
[1:03:06] they brought them together to make this
[1:03:08] book along with these last two chapters
[1:03:10] now the message and purpose of this book
[1:03:14] is to exhort encourage and offer hope
[1:03:19] amen how many one hoped today and the
[1:03:24] one of the purposes of this book is to
[1:03:26] the youth so we need to teach our young
[1:03:28] people the wisdom of God because
[1:03:31] Almond repeatedly admonishes the young
[1:03:34] people my son my son chapters one
[1:03:38] through eight is full of that my son
[1:03:40] listen to me listen to me son he says
[1:03:44] they're supposed to pursue wisdom rather
[1:03:46] than foolishness Solomon is trying to
[1:03:49] nip it at the bud with there's any
[1:03:51] temptation for sin Solomon is trying to
[1:03:53] nip it at the bud to make sure the life
[1:03:55] is not a disgraced life which which may
[1:03:57] end up with salvation at the end but
[1:03:59] Solomon wants a fruitful life for Christ
[1:04:02] he doesn't want to thief on the cross at
[1:04:05] this point doesn't want a thief on the
[1:04:06] cross experience where you're a thief
[1:04:08] your whole life a murder your whole life
[1:04:09] and at the last moment you get saved
[1:04:11] thank God for that but Solomon saying as
[1:04:13] you're young remember Christ when you're
[1:04:16] young amen choose a wise path don't
[1:04:19] choose a foolish path and he goes says
[1:04:23] over and over learn being let someone
[1:04:27] instruct you take instruction be
[1:04:31] teachable in other words go to church
[1:04:34] and learn something however you learn
[1:04:37] mess if you learn best by writing it
[1:04:39] down write it down
[1:04:41] learn something don't act like you know
[1:04:44] everything because the Holy Spirit will
[1:04:46] go right over the top of your head if
[1:04:47] you don't humble yourself you must be
[1:04:52] teachable if not if you're not teachable
[1:04:55] you'll become a mocker and don't we see
[1:04:57] that in different churches people that
[1:04:59] are no longer hungry to learn and grow
[1:05:01] in the Word of God they just mock other
[1:05:03] people they mock preachers they mock
[1:05:05] anybody who's trying to feed on the Word
[1:05:06] of God some and said you want to become
[1:05:09] one of the other a learner or a mocker
[1:05:12] we don't want to be in church the
[1:05:13] Pharisees were mocking the move of God
[1:05:15] out there they're mocking that and we
[1:05:17] don't want to mock the move of God we
[1:05:19] want to be right in the thick of it amen
[1:05:21] I want to be right in the thick of it
[1:05:23] hallelujah Amen now here's where we're
[1:05:26] gonna get down into some just some
[1:05:29] understanding of proverbs proverbs are
[1:05:32] not the same as laws and commands
[1:05:34] necessarily they're more like advice
[1:05:36] they're they predict they're more like
[1:05:39] predictions prediction that that those
[1:05:42] who pursue wisdom would generally find
[1:05:44] success and happiness
[1:05:45] in this earthly life so there's many of
[1:05:48] the Proverbs or predictions as we'll see
[1:05:49] I'll show you some examples this morning
[1:05:52] but then other proverbs are absolute
[1:05:55] promises that they'll find blessings for
[1:05:58] in eternity like I've already showed you
[1:06:00] the one to one's about eternal life so
[1:06:01] there are some proverbs that are just
[1:06:03] wisdom like this is pretty good advice
[1:06:05] you should follow this advice in every
[1:06:07] situation but it's not a guarantee
[1:06:09] guarantee and we'll get to those we'll
[1:06:12] get to those and then others are
[1:06:14] absolute promises of God she really got
[1:06:17] the balance when you read proverbs and
[1:06:19] especially when you read Ecclesiastes
[1:06:21] you really got to balance that out
[1:06:23] Ecclesiastes of Solomon he's battling is
[1:06:25] this even worth it this seems
[1:06:26] meaningless what is this about life and
[1:06:28] this one dies the next one raises up and
[1:06:31] don't even care what his father did and
[1:06:32] left him all his money he don't even
[1:06:34] care and solomon sees it all he's
[1:06:36] wrestling with these ideas and he says
[1:06:38] it's vanity it's meaningless it's it's
[1:06:40] meaningless but see that's a mind that's
[1:06:42] not born again by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:45] hey Dad that's right and so Ecclesiastes
[1:06:48] shows this wrestling with Solomon trying
[1:06:50] to understand life and and he brings it
[1:06:53] down the best he can without the baptism
[1:06:55] of the Holy Ghost he brings it down to
[1:06:57] saying fear God and keep his commands
[1:06:59] that's the best and that is that is
[1:07:01] still the best thing to do but we should
[1:07:04] not look at our daily lives and say it's
[1:07:05] vain you know the fellowship or it's
[1:07:08] vain to read my Bible it's vain to save
[1:07:10] money or we shouldn't look at it like
[1:07:12] that we should rejoice in what God has
[1:07:14] given us the wisdom and enjoy every
[1:07:17] moment that God has given us on this
[1:07:18] earth amen enjoy and see God's hand in
[1:07:22] it and see how God wants to put his hand
[1:07:24] into our lives amen I just look at just
[1:07:27] and this pessimistic view God doesn't
[1:07:29] want negative pessimistic Christians God
[1:07:32] wants Christians that are full of the
[1:07:34] joy of the Lord the happiness the peace
[1:07:36] of God that passes all understanding God
[1:07:39] wants us to be overcomers amen ha ha
[1:07:41] that's right church overcomers yeah
[1:07:45] we'll go through trials but we were not
[1:07:48] we shouldn't be pessimistic like Solomon
[1:07:49] was in Ecclesiastes and why and I've got
[1:07:54] little hint why it was like that because
[1:07:55] he was given he was given love to his
[1:07:57] wives at that time
[1:07:59] this at the end of his life he's writing
[1:08:01] Ecclesiastes he all his heart's already
[1:08:03] turned away from God so he started
[1:08:04] saying this seems vain this seems
[1:08:06] useless this seems useless but the Bible
[1:08:08] said there's nothing that's done in vain
[1:08:10] in the Lord and how to do yet God sees
[1:08:14] every effort we give amen
[1:08:15] God hears every prayer God sees every
[1:08:18] time we try to seek his face it's not
[1:08:20] done if been done in vain if it's done
[1:08:23] in the Lord Amen it's exactly right but
[1:08:27] there are like I said there are proverbs
[1:08:28] you have to balance out they deal more
[1:08:30] with probability and prediction or as
[1:08:32] advice more so than actual commandment
[1:08:35] so let's look at a few I didn't get to
[1:08:36] the structure there's a different part I
[1:08:38] want to get to the structure but I did
[1:08:40] get to this outline this is how Scofield
[1:08:42] outlines and I just I just try to stay
[1:08:44] with Scofield because mother man liked a
[1:08:45] lot of his work not all of it but a lot
[1:08:47] of it so chapters one to seven is two
[1:08:49] sons Solomon is speaking directly to his
[1:08:53] son and then he prays his wisdom in
[1:08:55] chapters 8 9 and then the folly of sin
[1:08:58] but of course there's there's a lot of
[1:08:59] wisdom in here too it kind of shows the
[1:09:01] blessing of obedience and then the folly
[1:09:02] of sin it kind of shows both I just
[1:09:04] wrote what Scofield said but you
[1:09:06] understand warnings and instructions are
[1:09:09] in chapters 20 to 29 the words of agar
[1:09:11] chapter 30 and then the the words of
[1:09:13] King Lemuel chapter 31 now what is
[1:09:16] wisdom I had to find it like this and
[1:09:18] correct me if I'm wrong after church
[1:09:20] notice I said after church your
[1:09:22] application is de Miz your application
[1:09:24] of the word to your daily life we all
[1:09:28] know we hear the word we know the word
[1:09:30] that's just knowledge okay I know it I
[1:09:33] know it I know it now how do you apply
[1:09:35] it how do you base your decisions with
[1:09:37] the knowledge that you have how do you
[1:09:39] base your to sit right what what
[1:09:41] decisions do you make based upon what
[1:09:42] you know that is wisdom or lack thereof
[1:09:45] I put in another way that we might you
[1:09:49] know program talks about how we're
[1:09:50] creators that's what wisdom is you take
[1:09:53] the Word of God and you create an
[1:09:54] atmosphere in your home praise the Lord
[1:09:57] you create an atmosphere in your church
[1:09:59] that's wisdom you're taking what you
[1:10:02] know and you create with that word you
[1:10:05] let that word live through you amen
[1:10:08] hallelujah how will you build your crate
[1:10:12] this this light
[1:10:12] of yours how well are you building what
[1:10:18] are you building what kind of atmosphere
[1:10:19] are you creating what kind of life what
[1:10:22] kind of habits are you forming this is
[1:10:24] what wisdom is here for amen
[1:10:26] how do you want to build a life that's a
[1:10:29] testimony a monument to Jesus Christ
[1:10:32] now I come up with this definition
[1:10:35] because of the Hebrew here's the Hebrew
[1:10:36] Hebrew means skill in war but also skill
[1:10:39] shrewdness prudence which is governing
[1:10:43] or disciplining yourself that's it's the
[1:10:45] application you govern your own life
[1:10:47] with that's wisdom how you govern
[1:10:49] yourself how you rule over yourself like
[1:10:52] Paul said I've got to beat my body and
[1:10:53] bring it under subjection he's talking
[1:10:56] about whiz that's what wisdom does it
[1:10:57] governs over your sinful nature that's
[1:11:00] inside your flesh now wisdom in the
[1:11:02] Greek has a similar meaning it's your
[1:11:04] skill in the management of your affairs
[1:11:07] it's the practice of a godly and upright
[1:11:11] life not just talking about how loving
[1:11:13] God is or how great or how wonderful the
[1:11:15] bride is or or how holy the bride is or
[1:11:17] how to beat it
[1:11:18] not just talking about it but actually
[1:11:20] doing it that's a wisdom is how you
[1:11:24] apply the Word of God that's preached to
[1:11:26] you and that you read in your home how
[1:11:28] you apply that to your life now you've
[1:11:31] got to hold a wisdom it's the atmosphere
[1:11:33] you create it's the the life that you're
[1:11:35] building through the wisdom of God
[1:11:37] through the Word of God
[1:11:39] now Webster a Moore a modern definition
[1:11:43] is something like good sense or judgment
[1:11:45] you know we would say oats and that does
[1:11:47] apply spiritually it kind of it lines up
[1:11:49] with our other definitions but Webster
[1:11:51] calls it the ability to discern inner
[1:11:53] qualities and relationships insight
[1:11:55] which is true I mean every decision you
[1:11:58] make involves wisdom you're they're
[1:11:59] gonna use the wisdom of God or you're
[1:12:01] not going to use the wisdom of God so it
[1:12:03] all does go together now I kind of put a
[1:12:07] note here wisdom is a gift of the Holy
[1:12:09] Ghost and yet also and actually that
[1:12:11] every Christian should possess I didn't
[1:12:14] put up the scriptures here but I
[1:12:15] preached on him before about how wisdom
[1:12:16] is something we should all grow in
[1:12:18] knowledge and wisdom always go together
[1:12:20] throughout the the New Testament
[1:12:22] knowledge and wisdom now I'm gonna
[1:12:25] call back - when I preach on the gifts
[1:12:26] of the Spirit how I differentiated
[1:12:29] differentiated between wisdom and
[1:12:31] discernment wisdom the word of wisdom is
[1:12:33] the skill in managing affairs its
[1:12:35] discretion imparting truth and Jesus
[1:12:39] said wisdom is justified through its
[1:12:41] children or in other words wisdom is
[1:12:44] declared through the works or your
[1:12:46] actions right so your actions show our
[1:12:51] actions show the results of our actions
[1:12:53] show if we use wisdom or not and then
[1:12:59] wisdom tells you what to do with Bible
[1:13:01] knowledge because the Bible said wisdom
[1:13:03] hath builded her house wisdom takes the
[1:13:06] materials of knowledge and starts
[1:13:08] building them into something a structure
[1:13:11] because a wise man builds his house upon
[1:13:14] a rock hallelujah wise man mother bear
[1:13:19] said wisdom is the best group but guess
[1:13:21] best gift of the group of the nine gifts
[1:13:23] of the Spirit remember he said if you'll
[1:13:26] notice he said the verses to get the
[1:13:28] wisdom this is the best gift of the
[1:13:29] group and if we don't have wisdom we
[1:13:31] won't know how to use knowledge he says
[1:13:34] which is the second gift praise the Lord
[1:13:38] we got to have this wisdom first to know
[1:13:42] what to do with the other gifts of the
[1:13:44] Holy Spirit
[1:13:47] now discernment though is just to say
[1:13:51] though but the sermon is just
[1:13:54] distinguishing or judging the source
[1:13:56] behind an action that's the sermon
[1:13:59] wisdom is actually taking the word and
[1:14:01] actually doing something with it but
[1:14:03] discernment is just able to say that's
[1:14:05] of God that's of the devil that's what
[1:14:07] the sermon is and it's important gift
[1:14:09] because the sermon judges the spirit
[1:14:11] behind actions prophecies and words
[1:14:13] according to the Bible so wisdom and
[1:14:16] discernment are close but discernment is
[1:14:19] just the simple acknowledging of God not
[1:14:21] of God brother Branham said a message of
[1:14:24] tongues has to be before the church
[1:14:25] receives it Paul said leave two or three
[1:14:27] judges with discernment of spirit before
[1:14:29] it can be accepted to the church that's
[1:14:32] all discernment is and thank God thank
[1:14:34] God the sermons there but it's not as
[1:14:36] great of a gift as wisdom
[1:14:39] how do you apply what we've heard that's
[1:14:42] are my desires a pastor to help you
[1:14:44] learn myself to learn how to apply the
[1:14:47] message to our daily lives that's right
[1:14:51] now I'm gonna skip past that because
[1:14:53] that's the court I just read now what's
[1:14:57] a proverb because we have the book of
[1:14:58] Proverbs that when you know wisdom is
[1:15:00] and can contain in Proverbs a proverb is
[1:15:02] a brief well-known principle that states
[1:15:04] a general truth this is generally true
[1:15:08] in most cases it's a proverb it's kind
[1:15:10] of like this is what is probably going
[1:15:11] to be the end result if you do this
[1:15:14] action right because in the in the in
[1:15:17] the Hebrew proverb means a maxim it's a
[1:15:20] maximum and a maximum is an adage or a
[1:15:24] general truth a fundamental principle or
[1:15:26] it's a rule of conduct you should
[1:15:28] generally do this this is a generally
[1:15:30] the right way to do it
[1:15:31] adage is a principle now I put at the
[1:15:37] bottom note that proverbs are general
[1:15:39] truths they're fundamental principles
[1:15:41] some are absolute truths as we said some
[1:15:44] proverbs emphasize probability about
[1:15:46] what will likely happen but not always
[1:15:49] not always let me share some examples so
[1:15:51] let me show some absolute examples of
[1:15:54] proverbs versus probability proverbs I
[1:15:57] can say it like that so here's some I'm
[1:16:02] sorry we already the absolutes yeah so
[1:16:03] though if you choose wisdom you're gonna
[1:16:06] be saved there's no doubt about that
[1:16:08] right you if you if you eat from the
[1:16:11] tree of life the holy ghost you're going
[1:16:13] to be saved no doubt about its absolute
[1:16:16] right if you let it go all the way down
[1:16:18] to your soul you're gonna be saved now
[1:16:22] let me give you an example of a
[1:16:23] probability it's proverbs 22:6 train up
[1:16:26] a child in the way you should go and
[1:16:28] when he is old he will not depart from
[1:16:30] it and yet we can all say we know
[1:16:33] families who raise children the best
[1:16:35] they could to know God better than what
[1:16:38] they received as children yet their
[1:16:41] children turn away from God
[1:16:42] so this is
[1:16:44] of a proverb that's problem it's a
[1:16:47] probability it's predictive because
[1:16:50] there's no guarantee that every child of
[1:16:52] a believer is going to be saved there's
[1:16:55] no guarantee because the examples Jacob
[1:16:57] and Esau God hated Esau hated him and
[1:17:02] yet who's gonna say that Isaac and
[1:17:04] Rebekah were not good parents who's
[1:17:06] gonna raise up and say they got Bible
[1:17:07] proof for that right
[1:17:10] Jacob turned out to be a type of Christ
[1:17:13] Jacob turned out to be a mighty man of
[1:17:16] God right the twelve tribes of Israel
[1:17:18] the trove tribes of Jacob he was like
[1:17:20] the father of the 12 tribes both his
[1:17:26] parents were righteous scripture never
[1:17:28] alludes that Esau his parents did not
[1:17:30] train them in the ways of God do you
[1:17:32] think Isaac and Rebekah are saying it's
[1:17:33] okay for you to drink and smoke Esau but
[1:17:36] I I'm sorry but Jacob no you can't do
[1:17:39] that it's okay for you to watch evil
[1:17:41] things but no Jacob you're not allowed
[1:17:43] to do you think they were doing that
[1:17:45] absolutely not they've been hypocrites
[1:17:47] they have been compromisers so see
[1:17:51] there's there's but generally it's true
[1:17:53] if you raise a child and train them with
[1:17:56] love and the way the Bible says
[1:17:58] generally they're gonna keep the habits
[1:18:00] that you've formed in their lives
[1:18:02] generally they asked brother Branham
[1:18:05] this is quite a question are all the
[1:18:08] children of those who go in the rapture
[1:18:10] are they gonna go in the rapture - what
[1:18:11] a question to ask brother Branham
[1:18:13] doesn't give them a guarantee he just
[1:18:15] says if if if their names are on the
[1:18:21] book he cannot guarantee that every
[1:18:24] child of a believer is going to be safe
[1:18:26] it all depends if their name is on the
[1:18:29] book Esau they could not guarantee Esau
[1:18:33] was gonna be safe because God knew God
[1:18:35] foreknew what was in his heart evil was
[1:18:37] in his heart so there's no guarantees
[1:18:40] with salvation salvation is of the Lord
[1:18:43] he has mercy on whom he would I'm
[1:18:45] talking about there's no guarantees as
[1:18:47] far as parents training that's what I'm
[1:18:48] talking about there is a guarantee for
[1:18:50] you if you have faith amen
[1:18:52] that's Jesus's word Jesus word is a
[1:18:54] guarantee he that believeth on me has
[1:18:56] passed from death unto life Amen
[1:18:58] hallelujah and will not come into
[1:19:00] condemnation there are guarantees for
[1:19:02] believers but as far as parents if you
[1:19:05] train them up and do the best that you
[1:19:06] can there really is no guarantee it's
[1:19:08] all about their calling it's all about
[1:19:10] the election of God the Bible says he
[1:19:14] has mercy on whom he will and that's
[1:19:18] what Romans 9 18 now here's a
[1:19:21] probability in the Psalms I don't know
[1:19:23] if you ever check this out but David
[1:19:25] said I've never seen the righteous
[1:19:26] forsaken nor his seed begging bread
[1:19:29] that's not a promise this is
[1:19:31] misunderstood this is not a promise that
[1:19:33] a Christian will never have to beg for
[1:19:34] food it's not because it's true it's
[1:19:39] true David never saw a believer begging
[1:19:42] bread that's true David never saw it but
[1:19:45] if you go to Luke 16 20 the Bible caused
[1:19:48] Lazarus a beggar and he got the crumbs
[1:19:52] that fell from the rich man's table and
[1:19:54] the church said and you can't tell me he
[1:19:58] wasn't a seat of God because there is
[1:20:00] with Abraham in Abraham's bosom as the
[1:20:04] seat of Abraham so what does it show God
[1:20:08] that's true God with David David never
[1:20:10] saw righteous person begging bread but
[1:20:13] there may be a time there may be a
[1:20:15] situation where God allows a Christian
[1:20:18] or believer to become a beggar why in
[1:20:20] order to have a testimony in order to be
[1:20:24] able to say well this person overcame
[1:20:26] this person was an overcomer he you
[1:20:31] cannot say it wasn't the seed of Abraham
[1:20:32] because right there
[1:20:34] he's with Abraham hallelujah I love the
[1:20:37] wisdom of the Holy Spirit don't you
[1:20:38] church oh my I think it's beautiful so
[1:20:41] we got to be careful when we when we try
[1:20:45] to interpret the Word of God like like
[1:20:48] in the case of the children well these
[1:20:49] parents all it's their fault they didn't
[1:20:51] raise their child good enough well be
[1:20:53] careful wait till you have children wait
[1:20:56] till you have children I will see what
[1:20:57] kind of children you produce it's easy
[1:21:00] to judge that's why the Bible said be
[1:21:03] merciful
[1:21:04] [Laughter]
[1:21:06] be merciful here's another probability
[1:21:12] look at this proverbs 12 21 there shall
[1:21:15] no evil happen to the just no evil but
[1:21:18] then job tells his wife show we received
[1:21:21] good the hand of God and not receive
[1:21:23] evil he's making a general observation
[1:21:27] right
[1:21:29] that Christians generally God will not
[1:21:31] send evil upon them God will generally
[1:21:33] not allow evil to come upon them but
[1:21:35] sometimes he does now this hero I wrote
[1:21:39] here this might refer to the soul
[1:21:41] because once you get sealed by the
[1:21:43] Baptist and Holy Ghost Satan can't touch
[1:21:46] your soul praise the Lord all things and
[1:21:51] remember all things work together for
[1:21:52] good to them that love the Lord the
[1:21:55] Bible said there's no evil happen to the
[1:21:57] just of course nothing evil can happen
[1:21:59] to myself Christ is living in me praise
[1:22:01] God might happen evil to my flesh like
[1:22:04] job or even my spirit I might get some
[1:22:08] horrible mind battle or something some
[1:22:10] awful you know disruption of my spirit
[1:22:13] you know am I gonna scar my mind or some
[1:22:16] shocking tragic accident that might
[1:22:19] shake my mind but the Bible said no evil
[1:22:23] will happen to the just so see we've got
[1:22:28] to look at this as probability these are
[1:22:30] predictive things some of these proverbs
[1:22:32] are predictive and we can clearly see
[1:22:36] that through the scripture here's
[1:22:39] another probability we often
[1:22:40] misunderstand proverbs 10 27 the fear of
[1:22:43] the Lord prolong if days in other words
[1:22:46] if you if your fear God you live longer
[1:22:48] than sinners but the years of the wicked
[1:22:53] shall be shortened
[1:22:54] so some if we're not careful then every
[1:22:57] Christians got to live longer than every
[1:22:59] sinner you know well we got some
[1:23:01] problems in Jesus Christ was the most
[1:23:04] righteous man ever he only lived 33
[1:23:05] years st. Paul lived around 58 to 60
[1:23:09] years brother Branham only lived 56
[1:23:12] years but Hugh Hefner the Playboy
[1:23:15] founder lived 91 years
[1:23:18] Billy Graham live 99 so in some cases
[1:23:22] the Reich just do live longer right but
[1:23:27] sometimes the sinners live longer the
[1:23:30] church said Hugh Hefner was one of the
[1:23:33] most awful wicked business man's ever
[1:23:36] because he exploited the the beauty that
[1:23:38] God gave to women exploited it and then
[1:23:40] live with a bunch of women all his adult
[1:23:42] life
[1:23:44] fornication after for adultery after
[1:23:46] dollar after Daltry after Daltry all for
[1:23:49] money SiC and he lived 91 years old 91
[1:23:53] years
[1:23:54] remember Saul's death was premature so
[1:23:56] there there are some truths to this but
[1:23:59] even God God didn't lengthen Saul's days
[1:24:01] he shortened them because that kind of
[1:24:03] goes with this if you do wicked things
[1:24:05] I'm gonna shorten your life and then
[1:24:08] Hezekiah was not wicked but his death
[1:24:11] was post mature due to his sins he lived
[1:24:15] 15 extra years in the permissive will of
[1:24:17] God rather than the perfect will of God
[1:24:19] it would've been better if he would have
[1:24:20] left 15 years earlier but generally it's
[1:24:25] true if you serve God your life's gonna
[1:24:27] last longer generally and generally God
[1:24:32] will take sinners off the earth
[1:24:33] generally much of the time but there are
[1:24:38] some times where God allows tests or God
[1:24:41] is testing our faith or or God God God
[1:24:44] is doing something church that's we
[1:24:45] gotta remember God is doing something
[1:24:46] today amen
[1:24:48] he's in control he knows what he's doing
[1:24:50] praise the Lord we've got to trust God
[1:24:53] we've got to trust the process that God
[1:24:55] is playing out in our lives there's a
[1:25:00] lot more on this if the days the days of
[1:25:02] our years are threescore and ten and if
[1:25:04] look at that if there's no guarantee
[1:25:06] we'll get seventy years there's no
[1:25:08] guarantee brother Graham got fifty-six
[1:25:10] right and if by reason of strength they
[1:25:12] be fourscore years yet their strength
[1:25:15] labor and sorrow for too soon cut off
[1:25:17] and we fly away I remind me that song
[1:25:20] I'll fly away Oh glory so you brought a
[1:25:23] man that's what happens when we die we
[1:25:24] fly away hallelujah brother Lawrence
[1:25:27] we'll fly away we died
[1:25:29] flying off to heaven amen it's
[1:25:31] scriptural hallelujah
[1:25:33] that's right heat now God weak and it's
[1:25:36] my strength in their way he shortness my
[1:25:39] days this is what David wrote look it up
[1:25:41] it's David wrote this
[1:25:42] he's shortening my days so see it's all
[1:25:48] about God's purpose God's timing on some
[1:25:52] of these proverbs proverbs 3:16 length
[1:25:55] of days is in her right hand and in left
[1:25:58] her left hand riches and honor
[1:26:00] so God may give you from his left hand
[1:26:03] he may give you a I'm sorry right hand
[1:26:04] length of days left hand riches and
[1:26:06] honor either way I just want to kiss
[1:26:09] that nail-scarred hand I just want to I
[1:26:12] just want to get everything I receive I
[1:26:14] want everything I received to come from
[1:26:15] the hand of Christ
[1:26:17] Jobe said this seeing his days are
[1:26:20] determined so see God has a determined
[1:26:22] number God had 99 years for Billy Graham
[1:26:26] the number of his months are with thee
[1:26:29] God already knows the number
[1:26:31] thou has appointed his bounds that he
[1:26:33] cannot pass brother Ram couldn't live
[1:26:36] past 56 years because God had numbered
[1:26:38] his years got a number as months and the
[1:26:41] same thing is true for you and I God has
[1:26:44] all of our days in his hand amen he said
[1:26:48] my times are in that hand
[1:26:51] deliver me from the hand of mine enemies
[1:26:53] and from then that persecute me does
[1:26:56] this help by God's grace I hope it's a
[1:26:58] help it's getting real quiet out there I
[1:27:00] hope it's a help to you by the grace of
[1:27:02] Lord I'll try to watch my time too
[1:27:04] sometimes I know it gets quiet because
[1:27:06] I'm going so long so I know that so I
[1:27:09] cuz I was sat listening to brother
[1:27:11] salmon too and I kind of got tired at
[1:27:13] the end of course I was sick you know
[1:27:14] okay I'm not often sitting the sees what
[1:27:18] I'm saying I'm mostly up at the pulpit
[1:27:19] preaching so I get all kinds of energy
[1:27:21] and inspiration up here but when I sit
[1:27:23] there you know I got a battle through
[1:27:24] that the flesh I put 15 minutes aw give
[1:27:29] me about 20 minutes we'll try to finish
[1:27:30] up here these three books in the Bible
[1:27:32] are known as the wisdom books proverbs
[1:27:34] ecclesiastes in job they complement each
[1:27:36] other they don't contradict a compliment
[1:27:38] but you've got to look at them the right
[1:27:40] way like Ecclesiastes this is
[1:27:43] Solomon's struggle he's struggling in
[1:27:44] life he's saying this is vain if I work
[1:27:47] this is vain if I read books or this is
[1:27:49] vain because he's struggling he doesn't
[1:27:53] he don't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:55] Ghost
[1:27:55] he's compromising right he's
[1:27:58] compromising with women
[1:27:59] he's compromising on the word he's not
[1:28:01] using the wisdom God gave him amen so
[1:28:04] he's struggling the preach the preacher
[1:28:07] was struggling and that day of all the
[1:28:10] people to struggle that's the one we
[1:28:12] don't want to struggle because he's
[1:28:13] guiding the rest yet he was struggling
[1:28:17] they didn't have the Holy Ghost in the
[1:28:19] baptism see he was struggling to connect
[1:28:23] behavior well this sinner behaves like
[1:28:24] this but his consequence seems different
[1:28:28] both died and this one lives the whys
[1:28:31] that the Beast this one dies like the
[1:28:34] Beast and and this one is the sinner
[1:28:35] lives longer than the holy one what is
[1:28:37] this he was trying to understand the
[1:28:41] uncertainty of life in other words he
[1:28:43] was trying to understand God's plan for
[1:28:45] every person but Church you and I can't
[1:28:48] understand God's plan for every person
[1:28:49] who can understand God's prophet brother
[1:28:51] Graham dying in a car accident I've
[1:28:53] never heard a preacher understand that
[1:28:55] or explain that to me why why God want
[1:28:57] to do it and you know why because it was
[1:28:59] God's decision and he didn't share with
[1:29:01] anybody from Peregrine's testimony all
[1:29:05] the people all the bodies that were in
[1:29:07] intensive care unit they all got healed
[1:29:09] and left according to Perry green
[1:29:10] testimony so that might have been part
[1:29:11] of it but he died you know December 24th
[1:29:15] 1965 he died but all the other ones got
[1:29:17] healed in there why I don't know why
[1:29:20] it's God's purpose he's the author of
[1:29:23] truth he's the author of peace he's the
[1:29:26] author of hope he's not the author of
[1:29:28] confusion of frustration that's where
[1:29:31] we're going to he's the author of peace
[1:29:34] God had a number of months for brother
[1:29:36] Branham he fulfilled it let's just be
[1:29:38] faithful for our number of months job
[1:29:43] also brings balance to these general
[1:29:44] truths of proverbs he was a righteous
[1:29:47] man yet he was tested like few others
[1:29:52] yeah he was
[1:29:53] perfect in the sight of God and this
[1:29:56] lets us know Church that God is in
[1:29:58] control throughout your entire trial
[1:30:00] hope it's okay but I just you know I've
[1:30:02] been talking to brother John hope it's
[1:30:03] okay if I say this about John but in the
[1:30:05] midst of his trial with this hip
[1:30:06] replacement he's been looking for the
[1:30:08] hand of God in it he's seeing he's
[1:30:11] seeing how he's shared with me how God
[1:30:12] has allowed this to happen and different
[1:30:15] things happening his lives to see how
[1:30:17] God is what God is doing with and I
[1:30:19] think that's very admirable of our
[1:30:20] brother to see these things the pain
[1:30:23] that he suffers the physical pain and
[1:30:25] different things like that that's
[1:30:26] admirable because he could have too
[1:30:28] easily took the other way and thought
[1:30:30] all gods against me and what good is it
[1:30:32] to do serve God and all he could add
[1:30:34] others negative attitude he could have
[1:30:35] looked at like Solomon what good is it
[1:30:37] vanity vanity all these years of serving
[1:30:39] God vanity but he's choosing look at it
[1:30:41] as God has a purpose in it God is doing
[1:30:44] something amen God maybe no understand
[1:30:47] it but I got enough faith in maturity
[1:30:49] know that God is doing something in my
[1:30:51] life amen
[1:30:53] God's in control I didn't bring myself
[1:30:57] here God brought me here and I didn't
[1:30:59] bring myself here then God's got a he's
[1:31:01] got a purpose for me being here now I
[1:31:05] want to bring this thought to this is
[1:31:06] getting real deep so bear with me I'm
[1:31:08] gonna go real deep here for a moment I
[1:31:10] think this whole series is gonna be deep
[1:31:12] because I've really I'm gonna scratch my
[1:31:13] head a few times but it's good that the
[1:31:16] Holy Spirit brings us the deep things of
[1:31:18] God job was perfect yet to say in heaven
[1:31:24] he was perfect but on the earth he was
[1:31:26] battling fear how can a man by the Amen
[1:31:31] be battling fear on the earth but yet in
[1:31:35] heaven God sees him as perfect because
[1:31:38] God's looking at his sacrifice what a
[1:31:42] job say job said the thing which I
[1:31:44] greatly fear job just didn't battle with
[1:31:47] this every now and then brother John
[1:31:49] it was just wasn't well I battled fear
[1:31:51] every now and then it was a constant
[1:31:52] battle he was scared Oh mom I'm gonna
[1:31:55] lose my children I might lose my money I
[1:31:57] might lose my home I might is something
[1:32:00] he battled all the time yet in heaven
[1:32:03] God said this man is perfect amen
[1:32:05] Ilia why because he
[1:32:07] your Feist the soccer the blood
[1:32:09] sacrifice a man he met gods requirement
[1:32:12] but yet he had mind battles and I'm so
[1:32:16] scared I'm gonna lose all this don't be
[1:32:19] scared about losing material things just
[1:32:22] be concerned about losing your testimony
[1:32:24] for Christ's fear also is a seed and it
[1:32:30] works in the law of reaping and sowing
[1:32:32] joel planted seeds of fear in his life
[1:32:36] and he said that which i planted i
[1:32:39] reaped church let's not be a slave to
[1:32:42] fear this morning amen
[1:32:44] let's not be a slave to doubt don't
[1:32:46] don't greatly battle doubt past all the
[1:32:50] doubt out and have faith that god knows
[1:32:52] what he's doing amen
[1:32:54] joke planted in the heaven he's perfect
[1:32:57] because he sacrificed blood
[1:32:59] he used the blood of God told you I was
[1:33:01] going deep but at the same time was
[1:33:03] perfect in heaven he's battling
[1:33:06] spiritual powers and principalities in
[1:33:08] high places amen and he lost the battle
[1:33:11] can I say like that brother Bram said he
[1:33:13] lost the battle I'm not presuming I'm
[1:33:16] telling you what brother Branham said
[1:33:19] God sees his children as perfect or
[1:33:22] sinless in heaven under their blood
[1:33:24] sacrifice because there's no
[1:33:27] condemnation than learn in Christ Jesus
[1:33:30] hallelujah see don't let guilt get you I
[1:33:34] know we struck time people have told me
[1:33:35] they struggle with guilt in our church
[1:33:36] from time to time they feel guilty like
[1:33:38] God can't forgive them this proves God
[1:33:40] does forgive you amen
[1:33:42] you're perfect in heaven but in the
[1:33:44] earth you're still battling because God
[1:33:47] accepts your sacrifice and he just wants
[1:33:50] you to develop some real character down
[1:33:51] there on earth amen he just wants you to
[1:33:54] overcome on the battlefield hallelujah
[1:33:56] but in heaven you're already perfect
[1:33:58] there's no condemnation to you you're
[1:34:01] forgiven you're going to heaven you're a
[1:34:03] child of God trust God at the same time
[1:34:10] God sees him is perfect
[1:34:11] I still need to correct my child he
[1:34:14] shouldn't have planted all these fear
[1:34:16] seeds in his life
[1:34:17] because if you plant fear guess what
[1:34:20] you're going to get Church here
[1:34:22] if you plant holiness guess what guess
[1:34:25] what you're gonna get
[1:34:26] holiness the man said and look at the
[1:34:29] book of Job and said Joe feared and what
[1:34:31] he feared it actually happened because
[1:34:33] it's a law of reaping and sowing what
[1:34:36] brought it his fear what brought this
[1:34:38] test upon him brother Baptist had fear
[1:34:41] that's what made it happen
[1:34:43] his faith would have kept him from it
[1:34:45] but his fear brought him brought it to
[1:34:47] him and the church said his faith could
[1:34:55] have kept it from him so doesn't this
[1:34:57] make you feel better
[1:34:58] Church doesn't make it feel better job
[1:35:00] wasn't perfect he reap what he sowed but
[1:35:03] he also overcame by the blood he
[1:35:07] overcame by understanding God as England
[1:35:09] I had to learn it on a hard lesson after
[1:35:11] 42 chapters he had to learn at our
[1:35:13] lesson 42 chapters of argue and he
[1:35:15] argued three times with those three
[1:35:16] friends there's three cycles of three in
[1:35:18] there which is pretty striking and
[1:35:20] interesting then Allah who comes and
[1:35:22] then God comes oh my god had to show him
[1:35:27] this I'm in control and you know God
[1:35:31] really never answered why he loved this
[1:35:33] trial to go to pass God never let job
[1:35:34] know about that he just said you try to
[1:35:37] you run the universe sometime cuz job
[1:35:40] was accusing God of not being faithful
[1:35:41] he said where is God I'm just invited
[1:35:44] God allowing this what's wrong with God
[1:35:46] and God said you try to run you try to
[1:35:49] bring snow out of the the great secret
[1:35:51] places you tried to divide the rivers
[1:35:53] from the stream you tried to divide the
[1:35:55] mountains from the land try that
[1:35:57] sometimes you see it was to Humble him
[1:36:00] search time you know we want to be
[1:36:02] humble by God's grace humble humble God
[1:36:06] knows what he's doing Church it's the
[1:36:10] wisdom of God he was scared it was gonna
[1:36:13] happen and it did happen now if he if he
[1:36:15] knowed it would it happened it wouldn't
[1:36:17] happen see what I mean so look it was a
[1:36:18] seed of fear planted in his life that's
[1:36:23] why when you come to church honest
[1:36:25] Church hear the word of God and leave a
[1:36:28] different person leave with different
[1:36:30] thoughts or else you're gonna reap what
[1:36:32] you sow
[1:36:33] you got to speak the Word of God like we
[1:36:36] said last week the overcomer speaks the
[1:36:38] word amen I will not let fear I will not
[1:36:41] let doubt I would not let lust oh not
[1:36:43] get greed I'll not let these things take
[1:36:45] a root in my life I'll let faith rule my
[1:36:48] life but man said if you're afraid when
[1:36:51] you come in the prayer line maybe I just
[1:36:53] have got enough faith all submission
[1:36:54] it'll never happen don't worry
[1:36:57] why because you've already planted seeds
[1:36:59] of fear in your life yet in heaven
[1:37:01] you're gonna be saved you're gonna go to
[1:37:03] heaven you're gonna be the rapture but
[1:37:04] on earth you're going through a trial
[1:37:06] and you've got to overcome that trial so
[1:37:13] I told you it's deep but if you know
[1:37:16] it's going to happen healing it'll
[1:37:18] happen
[1:37:19] see it's a substance of thump something
[1:37:21] Jobe had a fear that these things would
[1:37:24] come upon him and they did if you have a
[1:37:27] fear that your disease is gonna leave
[1:37:29] you or won't leave you it won't if you
[1:37:30] have faith that it will it will leave
[1:37:33] you love the Lord and I expect some
[1:37:38] questions so send me an email shoot me
[1:37:39] an email
[1:37:39] talk to me after church I know it gets
[1:37:42] really deep because the thing is God has
[1:37:45] a certain purpose for every is a certain
[1:37:47] testimony for every life and he needs to
[1:37:51] overcomer for every area of life now
[1:37:56] this is our confidence in Christ I told
[1:37:57] you I was gonna try to get here our
[1:37:59] confidence is this that we know all
[1:38:01] things work together for good to them
[1:38:03] that love God to them who are called
[1:38:06] according to his purpose that's the
[1:38:08] thing Joel didn't know the purpose of it
[1:38:10] but we are told what the purpose was
[1:38:12] Satan thought Jobe would just work in
[1:38:14] the system oh he just serves you because
[1:38:17] you know you do good to him see we know
[1:38:21] the purpose their God trying to prove to
[1:38:22] the devil that somebody will love it may
[1:38:24] men not just for natural blessings but
[1:38:27] somebody really loves the righteousness
[1:38:28] of Christ amen more they love sin and
[1:38:32] lust that was the purpose of job's trial
[1:38:35] and also to be a testimony of patience
[1:38:38] to all of us because
[1:38:39] remember the patience of Job be patient
[1:38:43] in trials be patient don't get upset
[1:38:44] don't try to solve it yourself I know
[1:38:46] now if you can solve it by God's grace
[1:38:48] by the leadership the Holy Spirit solve
[1:38:50] it but if you can't trust God to solve
[1:38:52] it just give him glory in the midst of
[1:38:55] the trial amen
[1:38:56] for whom he did foreknow he did also
[1:39:00] predetermined he's predetermined to be
[1:39:03] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:39:05] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:39:07] brethren God has determined that you are
[1:39:10] going to live like Christ lived a man
[1:39:13] God has already determined that you're
[1:39:16] going to be victorious and you're gonna
[1:39:17] act like Christ would act amen if Christ
[1:39:21] was acting a living here in 2018 he'd be
[1:39:24] living like you are amen that's the
[1:39:27] predestinated plan of God we are here
[1:39:29] choice in that amen we're the ones that
[1:39:32] are supposed to be Christ in flesh Toma
[1:39:38] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:39:40] he also called whom he called them he
[1:39:42] also justified whom he justified them he
[1:39:45] also glorified you see Israel could not
[1:39:48] figure out God's love the Prophet says
[1:39:50] they thought love meant no suffering
[1:39:52] they thought their love met a baby with
[1:39:54] parental care but God said his love was
[1:39:56] elective love I know we read this Coral
[1:39:57] you need it I need it because we go
[1:40:01] through so many mind battles and trials
[1:40:03] there's so many voices and seeds of
[1:40:06] doubt and and fear all these things we
[1:40:08] need to hear the word of God the proof
[1:40:13] of his love is election that no matter
[1:40:15] what happened his love was proven truly
[1:40:17] by the fact that they were chosen the
[1:40:19] salvation because God has chosen you
[1:40:21] from to salvation through sanctification
[1:40:23] of the Spirit and belief of the truth he
[1:40:27] may commit you to death as he did Paul
[1:40:29] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:40:32] job that is his prerogative he is
[1:40:35] sovereign but it is all with a purpose
[1:40:39] there's an end result God wants to get
[1:40:41] out of all of our lives and that's why I
[1:40:45] like we said that's why some of the
[1:40:46] Proverbs may seem they may seem
[1:40:48] predictable they may seem like
[1:40:50] probability because God may have a
[1:40:52] certain
[1:40:53] testimony for a believer and they may
[1:40:55] have to suffer and they'd have to go
[1:40:57] through different trials but it's all
[1:40:59] with a purpose in mind God knows what
[1:41:01] he's doing with the clay aren't you glad
[1:41:03] all my desire just pour more water on me
[1:41:06] Lord let the water of the word just pour
[1:41:08] over me like a hot bath her hot shower
[1:41:10] just let it pour we clean me out and
[1:41:12] just mold me help me to just get in your
[1:41:15] mind if God did not have a purpose he
[1:41:19] would be the author of frustration I
[1:41:21] hope we come to church and we don't feel
[1:41:23] like God it's so frustrating to serve
[1:41:25] you if we are we've missed the purpose
[1:41:27] of God we're not we think we know our
[1:41:30] purpose for our life better than God
[1:41:31] does
[1:41:32] and that's called pride but God is the
[1:41:36] author of peace his purpose is that we
[1:41:40] after we have suffered a while we be
[1:41:42] made perfect and be established
[1:41:44] strengthened and settled in the faith as
[1:41:47] Jobe said he put strength in us you see
[1:41:50] he himself suffered he learned obedience
[1:41:51] by the things he suffered he was
[1:41:53] actually made perfect by the things
[1:41:54] which he suffered like the Bible said
[1:41:56] about Christ think about what are you
[1:42:01] learning lately what is God teaching you
[1:42:02] lately I hope you can think of something
[1:42:04] he's taught you lately
[1:42:06] through suffering usually it's through
[1:42:09] suffering we have to learn the lesson
[1:42:11] the hard way gotta suffer and oh it's
[1:42:16] like God's got a pound in our brain and
[1:42:18] preach it again and preach it again and
[1:42:20] preach it again and now it comes on a
[1:42:22] tape I'm listening brother brown then I
[1:42:24] hear another preacher say it on YouTube
[1:42:25] where I hear Tara just he's got to just
[1:42:27] pound it until we go through our thick
[1:42:29] skulls sometimes let me just be playing
[1:42:32] a little bit this morning let's not be
[1:42:36] stubborn let's just be humble let's be
[1:42:40] teachable we must trust
[1:42:45] purpose in the probability or the
[1:42:47] uncertainty of our lives each one of our
[1:42:49] lives we can't predict the future each
[1:42:51] one of us have uncertainty about
[1:42:53] tomorrow there's probability well this
[1:42:56] may happen or that may happen it's true
[1:42:57] that may happen but we must trust God in
[1:43:01] the midst of it all and I'm almost done
[1:43:03] here I told you 15 minutes yeah I got 14
[1:43:06] here left huh gang so afraid so hard now
[1:43:08] not know I think I hit 30 instead of 15
[1:43:10] forgive me I'm looking at that clock
[1:43:13] here give me yeah let me keep let me
[1:43:16] give me 13 more now Jesus member now
[1:43:19] this what we're saying I brought this up
[1:43:21] before but Jesus gave two examples God
[1:43:24] needed overcomers for the day of
[1:43:26] judgment he needed men and women of true
[1:43:28] christ-like character and so he used the
[1:43:32] men of Nineveh and the queen of sheba he
[1:43:36] brings up what is what was their whole
[1:43:39] life about the men of Nineveh their
[1:43:41] whole life's purpose was to do one thing
[1:43:44] repent at Jonas preaching that's all
[1:43:47] because God is going to raise them all
[1:43:49] in their judgment what was your
[1:43:51] testimony we repented when we heard a
[1:43:54] prophet preach the word amen we knew
[1:43:57] judgment was coming we knew the wrath of
[1:43:59] God was coming but we repented and that
[1:44:01] was the whole purpose for the Amen of
[1:44:03] their life hey man that part of their
[1:44:06] testimony is going to speak on the day
[1:44:08] of judgment it's gonna shine like the
[1:44:09] Sun the Bible says the Sun of
[1:44:12] righteousness the Bible says that's the
[1:44:15] whole purpose of their life was to just
[1:44:17] repent because member in Jesus member
[1:44:21] these are gonna witness against Jesus's
[1:44:23] day because John the Baptist said you
[1:44:25] generation of vipers who hath warned you
[1:44:28] to flee from the wrath of God that is to
[1:44:29] come and they didn't repent at that so
[1:44:32] God needed someone with a testimony of
[1:44:34] repentance and the church said that's
[1:44:37] beautiful that's the Holy Spirit given
[1:44:40] us understand that was their whole
[1:44:41] purpose of life was just to repent their
[1:44:43] whole life was building up the one thing
[1:44:44] to repent when a prophet got spit out of
[1:44:47] a whale's mouth after that just had to
[1:44:51] live a holy life pleasing to God and
[1:44:52] God's gonna use them these were over
[1:44:54] comers
[1:44:55] oh my life seems so dull my life seems
[1:44:58] so this is that but just be what God
[1:45:00] called you to be find the purpose of God
[1:45:04] for your life and live for Christ with
[1:45:07] all of your heart
[1:45:08] amen what was the Queen of Sheba her
[1:45:12] whole testimony on the day of judgment
[1:45:14] is to rise up against these Pharisees
[1:45:16] who wouldn't even go go over and be
[1:45:17] baptized by John the Baptist or join
[1:45:20] Jesus church because she came from the
[1:45:23] uttermost parts of the earth God is
[1:45:25] gonna use her extreme effort and
[1:45:27] sacrifice physically she physically
[1:45:30] sacrificed everything across the desert
[1:45:33] in order just I just want to hear God's
[1:45:35] Word amen and God is going to use her as
[1:45:39] an example of sacrificing everything was
[1:45:42] there her whole life was about that
[1:45:44] think about that after she left Israel
[1:45:46] her life was just it was as a
[1:45:48] decrescendo said the right word brothers
[1:45:50] day crescendo decrescendo he would he'd
[1:45:54] know the music word I learned in fifth
[1:45:56] grade I remember that that's all I
[1:45:57] remember
[1:45:58] see the very climax of her life was to
[1:46:02] be led by the Holy Spirit to cross the
[1:46:04] desert and hear the words of Solomon and
[1:46:06] then the rest of her life was kind of
[1:46:08] just downhill and God said I'm in that
[1:46:13] part of your life that I'm sorry Queen
[1:46:15] of Sheba I'm gonna raise it up on the
[1:46:17] day of judgment that was your purpose in
[1:46:18] life and we have sister Wendy crossing
[1:46:21] the state I wonder if God's gonna use
[1:46:23] her as a witness one day I wonder Church
[1:46:25] some of you cross hundreds of my house
[1:46:29] drive hundreds of miles to church I
[1:46:31] wonder if God is gonna use you as a
[1:46:33] witness of it what's the purpose of my
[1:46:35] life brother Jesse it's so there's so
[1:46:37] much it's so hard to know I don't know
[1:46:38] but it sure seems like God chooses very
[1:46:40] simple humble things in our lives we
[1:46:44] just need to be faithful with what he's
[1:46:46] given to us see
[1:46:52] Satan's trick oh the grass is greener on
[1:46:53] the other side Oh only my life had a
[1:46:55] testimony like sister so-and-so only if
[1:46:57] my life was like brother so-and-so it's
[1:46:59] so much easier if I was a brother or a
[1:47:01] preacher or something God wants us to be
[1:47:05] content with his purpose for our life
[1:47:08] and we can kick against him all we want
[1:47:12] but guess what if you're a son of God
[1:47:13] he's gonna rebuke you and correct you
[1:47:15] until you get in your position man or
[1:47:19] woman and the church said you can fight
[1:47:22] against you can kick against the pricks
[1:47:23] like Saul you can do all you want but he
[1:47:26] is gonna give you're a child of God you
[1:47:28] are gonna find your predestinated place
[1:47:31] in the body of Christ amen
[1:47:33] I feel inspired this morning amen how do
[1:47:36] I so tell her I'm so excited to preach
[1:47:38] this message this morning I just feel
[1:47:39] like the wisdom of God's all over it
[1:47:41] ought to be if it's God's wisdom I ought
[1:47:43] to be preaching on wisdom let me close
[1:47:46] with this you're giving I got 9 minutes
[1:47:48] these were some of the revelations out I
[1:47:51] believe now rub to me a revelation is
[1:47:53] the unveiling
[1:47:53] these are revelations the Holy Spirit I
[1:47:55] believe gave to me you can disagree but
[1:47:58] the way you'll know is about what it
[1:48:00] produces in my life that's how you know
[1:48:01] if it's a revelation if the gates of
[1:48:03] hell cannot overcome me then it was a
[1:48:05] revelation hallelujah that's what Jesus
[1:48:09] said by the way flesh and blood could
[1:48:12] not give it unto you but my father which
[1:48:13] is given it he said that's a revelation
[1:48:15] and the gates of Hell will not prevail
[1:48:17] against them
[1:48:17] we're not prevail against those who have
[1:48:20] the revelation look at this look at the
[1:48:23] first and last chapters of Proverbs go
[1:48:25] home and read it today if you got a
[1:48:26] chance more than one service go don't
[1:48:28] read your Bible if you can tonight you
[1:48:30] off to you anyway chapter one begins
[1:48:33] with the plea to receive the seeds of
[1:48:36] wisdom like chapter one which i pers 1/3
[1:48:39] all about just receive it get wisdom get
[1:48:41] understanding it's it's pleading with
[1:48:44] the young people to receive the seeds
[1:48:47] and it's from a king to a son and wisdom
[1:48:52] as build up as is built up as a
[1:48:54] spiritual lady wisdom as like a symbolic
[1:48:57] personification of wisdom so if you put
[1:48:59] wisdom in a person it be a woman a godly
[1:49:01] woman that I'll encourage our sisters
[1:49:07] God likens wisdom to a old lady so
[1:49:13] chapter one is the scene chapter chapter
[1:49:17] 31 is the fruit chapter or the results
[1:49:21] of living a life a wisdom from another
[1:49:24] king that he received from his mother
[1:49:26] isn't that striking the father is
[1:49:30] instructing the son the beginning but at
[1:49:32] the end we see where our another King
[1:49:33] where did this King get his wisdom from
[1:49:35] his faithful mother the fifth gospel
[1:49:38] amen glory all mothers he ought to be so
[1:49:41] thankful for what God's given to you a
[1:49:44] chance to teach the next generation the
[1:49:48] Word of God King Lemuel says this is the
[1:49:53] prophecy that my mother taught me this
[1:49:56] is what a true woman who's led by the
[1:49:58] Holy Ghost in the wisdom of God this is
[1:50:01] how she lives her life amen
[1:50:03] where the King get this wisdom from his
[1:50:06] momma where I get a lot of my wisdom
[1:50:08] from well if you think it's wisdom for
[1:50:11] my mom taught me to put God first always
[1:50:14] pray always go to church never forsake
[1:50:16] the house of God but God's house above
[1:50:18] everything else
[1:50:19] read your Bible pray pray before
[1:50:21] everything you know give God ties give
[1:50:24] to people give to the poor know nothing
[1:50:25] is over not give it to him
[1:50:27] I know there's balance on that I could
[1:50:29] preach on that recent I understand that
[1:50:31] but the idea is like the Proverbs woman
[1:50:34] the Bible said she stretched out her
[1:50:35] hand to the poor well preach on that
[1:50:38] hopefully in about two Sundays she
[1:50:40] didn't wait for all the beggars to put
[1:50:42] out their hands to her the Bible said
[1:50:44] she stretched out her hand to the poor
[1:50:45] which means she found people that were
[1:50:48] hurting and she reached out to them
[1:50:50] instead of them just reaching out to to
[1:50:53] me give it to me give it to me she she
[1:50:55] sought people she knew people who are
[1:50:57] hurting and so she purposely went and
[1:50:59] found them help them out so see
[1:51:05] 4:31 is what wisdom is now that wisdom
[1:51:09] is now in the flesh is no longer
[1:51:10] symbolic just as lady wisdom now it's in
[1:51:14] flesh the word is made flesh how many
[1:51:17] want to be the Word made flesh today
[1:51:19] amen
[1:51:20] how many want to be the masterpiece of
[1:51:21] God amen
[1:51:23] that's what chapter 31 is all about this
[1:51:25] is how a wise woman who has applied the
[1:51:29] wisdom of Solomon throughout the entire
[1:51:31] book this is what her life produces amen
[1:51:33] and did you know this I'm gonna preach
[1:51:36] on this this is good in verses 10 to 31
[1:51:40] it starts with who can find a virtuous
[1:51:42] woman every verse from ten to thirty one
[1:51:45] starts with a different Hebrew letter
[1:51:47] it's the A to Z Hebrew alphabet about a
[1:51:51] mature woman and there's some good
[1:51:53] thoughts behind that I'm going to bring
[1:51:54] out the whole alphabet explains in other
[1:51:59] words all the language declares the
[1:52:02] wisdom of a godly woman I got it's got a
[1:52:08] couple more slides I'm almost done I got
[1:52:10] five more minutes on here so bear with
[1:52:11] me it's not even one church ninety one I
[1:52:15] don't know what I don't wear you out you
[1:52:17] know I told you I try to close to
[1:52:19] chapter one chapter one contains as go
[1:52:22] to our Bibles chapter one contains the
[1:52:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost I read this
[1:52:25] and it just jumped off the pages to me
[1:52:26] this is my Dharma it's a revelation of
[1:52:28] the Holy Spirit I wasn't looking for
[1:52:31] this I'm just reading and then the voice
[1:52:34] of the voice of God speaks this to my
[1:52:35] heart go to proverbs 1 verse 20 now
[1:52:46] chapter one
[1:52:47] the baptism the Holy Ghost this is
[1:52:49] because the baptism Holy Ghost most
[1:52:51] certainly would represent the mind of
[1:52:52] Christ when Paul says have the mind of
[1:52:55] Christ what does he say he saying be
[1:52:57] filled with the Holy Ghost walk in the
[1:52:59] spirit obey the spirit use the wisdom of
[1:53:02] the Holy Ghost look at proverbs 1 22 23
[1:53:07] this is beautiful
[1:53:09] wisdom cries without she utters her
[1:53:12] voice in the streets what a brother
[1:53:14] Graham say when they got the Holy Ghost
[1:53:16] he said they jumped out of windows down
[1:53:18] into the streets can you believe that
[1:53:21] church jumped out of windows in the
[1:53:24] streets and now wisdom what were they
[1:53:26] saying the Bible said they were
[1:53:27] declaring the wonderful works of God
[1:53:30] wisdom doesn't hide itself wisdom
[1:53:33] declares itself wisdom is not afraid to
[1:53:37] glorify the Lord ER to honor and magnify
[1:53:39] the Lord that's not whiz that's fear but
[1:53:42] wisdom enjoys expressing itself amen
[1:53:46] hallelujah that's verse 20 she cried in
[1:53:53] the chief place of Concours in the
[1:53:57] openings of the gates in the city she
[1:53:59] out of her voice her word saying I'm
[1:54:05] sorry how long
[1:54:06] we love simplicity and scorners delight
[1:54:09] in their scorning and fools hate now
[1:54:12] it's look at verse 23 here's the baptism
[1:54:14] holy ghost turn at you my reproof behold
[1:54:17] I will pour out my spirit unto you I
[1:54:20] will make no my words unto you in that
[1:54:23] beautiful wisdom goes out in the street
[1:54:26] and said let me pour out the spirit unto
[1:54:28] you amen Joel chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 I
[1:54:32] will pull out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:54:36] hallelujah
[1:54:37] how does wisdom get started in a
[1:54:39] person's heart they got to be borned
[1:54:40] again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:42] and if you got the back to the Holy
[1:54:45] Ghost it'll produce a proverbs 31 Church
[1:54:47] oh yes sir
[1:54:51] can everybody see that the baptism of
[1:54:54] the Holy Ghost is laying right in
[1:54:56] chapter one if you want wisdom you've
[1:54:59] got to let the Holy Ghost be poured out
[1:55:00] upon you amen
[1:55:03] do you believe that church it's
[1:55:06] beautiful my the wisdom of God now let's
[1:55:09] finish with this this is my last thought
[1:55:11] it is because I only got I think three
[1:55:13] more slides yeah I got two more slides
[1:55:16] let's go to chapter eight now this
[1:55:20] doesn't
[1:55:20] a prophet along with all the other proof
[1:55:22] I don't know what does but this is an
[1:55:26] insight only a prophet could have
[1:55:28] proverbs 8 chapter 8 contains the
[1:55:33] origins of wisdom where did wisdom come
[1:55:36] from or the logos we'd say which
[1:55:41] remember is just the visible Spirit of
[1:55:42] God when there was nothing before there
[1:55:45] was no earth before there was any angels
[1:55:47] before there was any heaven it was just
[1:55:48] all nothingness but now that nothingness
[1:55:50] came forth a little light brother
[1:55:51] Branham said that was the Spirit of God
[1:55:53] that was the logos he said that was a
[1:55:55] pillar of fire whatever you want to call
[1:55:56] it it was all those synonyms that was
[1:55:58] the Spirit of God
[1:56:03] proverbs 822 the Lord possessed me in
[1:56:09] the beginning of his way the speaking of
[1:56:10] wisdom before his works of old I was set
[1:56:14] up from everlasting from the beginning
[1:56:15] or ever the earth was when there was no
[1:56:17] depth I was brought forth when there was
[1:56:19] no fountains abounding with water before
[1:56:22] the mountains were settled before the
[1:56:24] hills I was brought forth who is brought
[1:56:26] forth wisdom while as yet he had not
[1:56:30] made the earth nor the fields or the
[1:56:31] highest part of the dust of the world
[1:56:33] when he prepared the heavens I was there
[1:56:36] when he set a compass upon the face of
[1:56:39] the depth when he established the clouds
[1:56:41] above when he strengtheneth The
[1:56:42] Fountains of the deep when he gave to
[1:56:44] the sea has decreed that the water
[1:56:45] should not pass his commandment when he
[1:56:47] appointed the foundation of the earth
[1:56:49] then I was by him listened as one
[1:56:52] brought up with him
[1:56:54] I was like a little child right there by
[1:56:57] Daddy and I was daily his delight
[1:57:01] rejoicing always before him wisdom is
[1:57:05] like a little child as the delight of
[1:57:07] their parent rejoicing before their
[1:57:10] parent is that striking or what
[1:57:13] look at verse 31 rejoicing in the
[1:57:15] habitable part of his earth and my
[1:57:17] delights were with the sons of man let's
[1:57:20] stand to our feet
[1:57:20] there's my timer did you catch that
[1:57:24] wisdom was like this little child
[1:57:28] standing before God and what does
[1:57:31] brother BAM say about the logos now the
[1:57:33] Bible teaches us that the logos went
[1:57:35] forth I might say all of God becoming
[1:57:37] his first body form when the logos went
[1:57:39] out of God let's look what it looked
[1:57:41] like no one had seen the father at any
[1:57:43] time nowhere never did never will
[1:57:46] because God is invisible you never see
[1:57:48] God but then that little guy that went
[1:57:51] out of him become like a little halo of
[1:57:53] light let's see it playing yonder like a
[1:57:56] child before the door steps of the
[1:57:58] Father hey man and now I can see him as
[1:58:03] he moves over here and he draws into his
[1:58:05] memory or his mind a picture of what the
[1:58:07] world should be now there's there's not
[1:58:11] a star or nothing how do brother Graham
[1:58:14] described the beginning before the
[1:58:16] creation of the world he describes it as
[1:58:18] a little light dancing and playing
[1:58:20] before the Father and the Bible
[1:58:22] describes wisdom as I was by him one row
[1:58:26] up with him and I was daily his delight
[1:58:28] rejoicing always before him amen how
[1:58:33] many love the Lord Church oh isn't this
[1:58:35] beautiful
[1:58:36] don't you delight in the wisdom of God
[1:58:37] that's justice I'll just thank the Lord
[1:58:39] for his word thank you Lord thank you
[1:58:41] Jesus for your word it is so true church
[1:58:45] this word is so true brother Lord's mind

[1:58:53] how great is God how great he had his
[1:58:56] wisdom there personified as the Holy
[1:58:58] Spirit just dancing before him and this
[1:59:01] wisdom was going to create the entire
[1:59:03] world and now I'm sure she says now can
[1:59:06] live in you and I we don't have to be
[1:59:08] defeated we have to wonder what's God's
[1:59:10] purpose we have to be jealous or envious
[1:59:13] or discourage or full of guilt we don't
[1:59:15] have to be any of those things we can be
