here to stand in the sea learning to lean on Jesus I'm just learning to lean just that simple little course so we were singing on Sunday night leaning on the everlasting arms just wanna lean on this word praise God learning Julie [Applause] you need to lean on Jesus on finding more power than I've ever not Jesus yes somebody to lead to me hi [Music] I find more praise God amen thank you Laura thank you praise God amen let's take your Bibles let's go to Genesis chapter 1 I like to look at that numerology series I like to keep that going by God's grace I feel like I got away from it for a little while and I just want to try to stay in it and finish it here so let's go to Genesis chapter 1 and let's look at the number 7 I was studying more I realized I didn't finish the chapter on number 7 so I went back and read it and I saw there's a whole lot more on number 7 so we look at number 7 here tonight by the grace of Lord this will be part eight in the series on biblical numerology hope it's been a blessing to you praise God I talked to different preachers and they've said I've never heard a sermon or a series on by biblical numbers so that makes me feel good like I feel like it's a fresh thought from the Holy Spirit that's why I like that I like to go deeper with things I've never known before and all of this church is to point us to one person Jesus Christ that we can know him better and nobody he's trying to tell us he's trying to make himself known in these numbers praise God so Genesis chapter 1 I just want to read the scripture about the seventh day it's actually it's chapter two I'm sorry forgive me let's go to chapter two verse one and two part me Genesis 2:1 and to thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them that's reversed two together one two three and on the seventh day God ended his work which he made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made let's have one more word of Prayer as we bow our heads Heavenly Father the Lord God we read your holy word father we saw how you created Lord and you rested on the seventh you completed it on the seventh day and fathers we look at the number seven speak to our hearts let us see what you have completed let us see how you put your stamp of completion Lord and all throughout the scripture and father let us have the confidence to know that you'll complete your work in our lives dear God help us Lord to see how you're making yourself known to us all through the Bible through sevens in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless your being to see to praise the Lord so you can switch over there Lydia and I think I got I got some slides for us here tonight I'm gonna try to preach 45 minutes again I worked out pretty good on Sunday I preached an hour I said 45 minutes I only went 15 minutes over so I felt pretty good about that so let's look at this here by the grace of the Lord I'm really gonna try to preach seven okay so this is part 8 I said part six on Sunday I was wrong I looked it up it was par seven so the today's part eight we're looking at the number seven again I imagine I'll have one more sermon on 7 and then I'll probably have eight and nine so maybe next Wednesday we'll see what the Lord allows one look at these numbers here to try to get you to see the full thought a church of this don't prove this is eternal this is not an eternal book I don't know what does how you see all these numbers all the way through our God is so perfect and church people are listening you know I had my friend from high school who was basically he's in high school just text me this morning you said I've been listening and listening and watching your teachings on Facebook and he said I had it he said this is why I chose number three on the foot on the football team you know and because he said God perfects everything in threes so a person I never thought would be interested in God they're watching us but RAM said some people person night might never go to church but they'll go to church by watching your life amen yes I got to know everything I do on Facebook everything that goes on there everything that I do everything you say everything I say somebody's watching and it's going to influence um one way or the other we've got to influence them for Jesus Christ I don't know what happened like I said I don't know what people would choose but I know what I'm gonna choose I know for as for me in my house I'm gonna serve the Lord Jesus Christ praise God so be encouraged and just know that God is speaking through your life God is moving through your life people are watching I really blessed my heart today know what's that sister amen that's right very thankful he's watching they've hid and just so you know I know our most-watched sermon lately was my sermon on Christmas can you imagine that remember back in September know is October I right before Halloween I preached on Christmas that's been my most why our most watched sermon lately so I just thought that was encouraging you know to know that and I listened to it again because there's a little bit of a minister's battle going on on Facebook with you know Christmas so I kind of want to see what did I preach I forgot what I preached and I just want to make sure I said everything right but I'm sorry I won't be here Sunday for Christmas but may the lord give you the BAM said one of the Marius Christmases he said you have such a Merry Christmas let it be a sacred time Church but as I was listening I just remember call this if you go to a party or family party or work party just make sure you let the light of Jesus Christ shine in your life be show moderation you're not you're not the one drinking all the punch and you're not the one you know you're not the one watching the TV or like that you're the one that's really godly you're the one that's so salty people get thirsty talking to you amen so my inspiration church I believe comes from Christ from this of course the message brother my always talks about God's biblical numerology and his numbers and then of course if you haven't seen this book if you can buy the book or you can find it online it's called a number in Scripture by I think it's JW Bollinger or something like that so I've just been reading this book and then pulling all the thoughts that I can find and then as I pull them then the Holy Spirit remind me what brother branham's said about this or what about that and I just I'm just trying to put it all together by the grace of the Lord so remember number seven means completion I'm not going to spend much time on this we know what Branham said he said its completion God's perfect in his word I think you're gonna see he's perfect in his word tonight all the seven in here in the word eventually we'll get to the book of Hebrews there's so many sevens I never knew it in the book of Hebrews we could spend the whole sermon just on the sevens if we want to read all the scriptures in the book of Hebrews now but let's start with this I mean maybe I'll just maybe I'll make that my goal to get to Hebrews and we'll just read some of those I'll try to go through these maybe a little brief little briefly so there are seven miracles in the book of Saint John there's the water turned to wine the nobleman's son was healed in chapter four in Chapter five the pool bethesda the man was healed there chapter six the feeding of the 5,000 was Americo the man born blind was Americo how he was healed the raising of Lazarus and then after Jesus resurrection the draught of fishes and so this proves completion there's seven miracles so it's complete proof of the signs that Jesus was the Christ they meant in the book of John seven miracles I like this one there's seven gifts that Christ gives us in the book of st. John there's seven things the Bible said he's going to give first when he says I'm gonna give my flesh for the world amen and he said I'm gonna give my life and then he says he gives his example of he you know he took off his outer garment and he went and washed their feet he said I'm giving you an example and then he said I'm gonna give you that I'm gonna send you the comforter I'm gonna give it and they got for that gift I don't know yeah that's what we need today we need comfort today and Laodicea then he said I'm gonna leave you my peace I'm gonna give you that peace and then he said he said I'm gonna give you my words he said they're gonna go to the disciples and then through the disciples they'll come to you and then he said I'm gonna share glory so let's go to that one let's read that one because that might be a little bit unfamiliar John 17 22 let's read that you know there's a certain glory that we experienced of course you know God's glory in our lives and then there's a certain glory he's going to share with us like we're gonna have a certain anointing that will be glorious and the angels will look on us and they won't be able to understand it because they've never been redeemed they've always been saved but we'll have a certain glow because we've experienced sin and death but we've been redeemed and purchased by the blood of God's own son it says that even the Angels can't even experience but thank God for the angels amen we're not whenever we never we never want to say oh we're better than the Angels you know we don't want to use that quote or the scripture the wrong way we just want to understand they're just different positions praise God so John 17 22 I started verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that's where Jesus prayed for you Church right there amen I know you can't say well Jesus never prayed for me right there he prayed for you I'm praying for all them that here my disciples and then that here on me through their word well you've heard through their word verse 21 that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us see there's that let us there's that same us Jesus is using us and that's a plural pronoun right that the world may believe that thou has sent me verse 22 and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them he said I've already given them that glory amen hallelujah that they may be one even as we are one so if the glory of God is upon us what will it bring it bring a unity praise God because he says I've given my disciples that glory that they may be one so there's such glory when people visit our church and they feel a unity in our church there's a special glory when we have Kerry ends or when we're just fellowshipping out here we're talking there's such a glory when people can feel unity or we can feel you need that we all want the same thing we all want Jesus to be glorified we want everybody to church to obey God's Word that's all we want aim ahead we just want to go in the rapture praise God we don't want to miss it we don't want to go to the tribulation we are that unity we want to be saved amen so see that's God's glory he said I'm giving them the glory that you gave me praise God so it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit to be unified that's the glory Jesus said I'm gonna give them the glory that they may be you want praise God aren't you gonna half of those seven gifts see before I read this I didn't know Jesus gave us seven gifts in the book of Saint John he gave us complete gifts amen I like that now I didn't actually read through these I just actually had time just to put this down well there are seven times he mentions the last day let's read them since we're right here in John let's go to John 639 I know one of them is an actual natural day the Feast of the Tabernacles where that's in John 7 but let's go to John 639 let's look at these last days now I did look it up I did type in last days and book of John and there are only are seven so that was right I knew there was seven but I didn't get a chance to read them all through let's read them here and see what the Lord says about the last day all right John 639 and this is the Father's will which he has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it again I'm sure raise it up again at the last day amen so that's speaking of the white throne judgment amen so all those the last day has to be the right throne judgment because after that he turned he sets in just struck me right there under there yeah that's the last day and after that there's just one eternal day ah it's always gonna be that same day amen hallelujah all right verse 40 is the second one and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which has see at the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day amen at church you understand that even foolish virgins when they're really saved they have eternal life already not in them but they have eternal life waiting because jesus said whoever believes in me he said has passed from death unto life a foolish virgin has eternal life waiting for them they passed from death and they've got life amen praise God but see as a Christian now with the Holy Ghost is come now we pass from death unto life but now we have eternal life already in us praise God that's the difference but they've got as long as their names on the book of life they've got eternal life promised and they passed from death not gonna die they're not going to hell later hell fire lake fire they're gonna be saved and they've got the promise of it and they already believe it but see us we've got to have it and we got to show it to other people praise God amen now verse 44 this is what I'm saying here no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I'll raise him up at the last day amen hallelujah who's gonna raise him up Jesus is gonna raise him up at the last day who's gonna raise you if we die and go to the grave who's gonna raise your body up Jesus Christ will raise you up amen he said I'm gonna raise you up so the PAS the fullness of the Godhead bodily will be in Christ and he'll speak the word and he'll say let that leão to see him bride come up and she'll come up amen hallelujah verse 54 whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last day a man beautiful go to chapter 7 37 this is the one I was speaking of earlier this is the one that speaks of a literal day yeah in the last day that great day of the feast see Jesus stood and cried saying if a man thirst let him come unto me and drink now Church you catch this he said come to me and drink but the Holy Ghost hasn't even fallen yet is anybody catch that he's saying come to me and drink and now this is before he's been crucified this is before the forty days he's seen by the 500 people at one time this is well before that he's saying a live voice come to me a drink and yet if he came at that moment they came at that moment they wouldn't be born again so what does it mean if you really love Jesus you're willing to come to him now but you're willing to stay with him amen that was the difference look at verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so he's preaching if you come and believe on me you'll have rivers flow out of you but they're not gonna get it that day they've got to hang around well jesus said I was going to have it if I came and so they couldn't complain they could say well I didn't have the rivers you let's stay with Jesus until the rivers flow out of your heart amen look at verse 39 and this proves our right here look at verse 39 but this making of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified amen I hope everybody can catch that tonight by God's grace he's saying come he's speaking of some future he says come to me and you'll have rivers flowing out he'll just have all this praise amen here's have all these songs yours have all this worship flowing out of you but they were not going to get it that day they had to hang around and they had to go to Pentecost and they had to be there when the Holy Ghost fell and then the rivers of God would flow out of their mouths amen see that church that's how we got that's how we got to believe every promise of God like we said on Sunday night with divine healing we would preach on that on Sunday night even if you don't have it right and then if you don't even have the revelation but just keep confessing it just keep believing it until that revelation comes they need glory that's what he's saying here come to me rivers will flow out of you rivers of water will flow out but it may not happen now but stay with me it'll happen to you eventually oh that's right amen John 1124 that's so important to understand Church they would did not receive rivers of water at that moment they had to go to Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost [Music] John 1124 okay this is Martha okay yeah Martha say than him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so again she's speaking of that day the white throne judgment right all right that's all right now 12:48 john 12:48 there's seven last days mentioned in the John but of course many of them are speaking of that white throne judgment 12:48 father glue father name I'm in the wrong spot yeah I'm in the wrong spot 12:40 okay he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that I've spoken the same shall judge him in the last day church you know you know I don't have to worry why don't what is God what does Christ gonna judge us about in the day of judgment whatever is right in here that's what I like to give my life to this right here I'll spend all my time right here because I know this is what we're gonna be judged by I want to make sure that you and I pass the judgement other there yeah I want to make sure that's one thing I got to make sure my life is I passed that judgment test amen I got to study that word and be in that word enjoy that word love that word line my life up with the word amen and how do you do that you let the word judge you every day now today church I had to repent to two people because I made a mistake today can I tell that real quick does everybody knows that I'm human okay is that the end of the day all the kids have already gone home the secretary calls over the loudspeaker and said mr. Smith do you have so-and-so to give to a parent and I said the wrong thing I said no the parent didn't email me soon enough so I put the blame on the parent as soon as I said I was like that's not right and so I was walking out and I was like lord I got a call I gotta say it wasn't their fault the fault was I didn't have a time to check my email all afternoon I was like Lord will you help me make this right with both the secretary and the parent and I was walking out to my car the Secretary's walking out and I just said Gauri there she is I can apologize so I walked up to her and I said I'm so sorry I made it sound like it was the parents fault it was not the parents fault it was my fault and the schedule because I couldn't check my email the rest of the afternoon so I said forgive me and she's just kind of blew it off she's like you know oh that's okay everybody makes mistakes but I just said forgive me I'm so sorry see that what is that church that's the word judging me every single day the word has got to judge you all day if you make a mistake say Lord forgive me God will help you do it so I got in the car before I drove off I dialed the parents number I said will you please forgive me I put the pressure I put the blame on you I didn't mean to put the blame on you it was my fault I it was not your fault would you forgive me and she said of course seekers this is going to judge us we've got to be judged by the Word of God these are not little things everything's a big li but the Bram said the reason people don't get further with God is because they is not because they don't do the big things they don't do the little things right they let the little things go and pretty soon a little thing turns into a big old nasty thing right so I got to get that lion thing that just that was just it was alive I think I was stressed out at the end the day wherever that lion thing was in there I just said God forgive me I didn't mean to say that sometimes we just speak before we think about it so I'm human but I know Jesus Christ is supernatural amen and he helps me to stay pure so there you go there you go the same should judge him in the last day the Word of God that we preach and Jesus preached will judge us at the last day all right did you know this there's seven miracles wrought by Christ on this Sabbath day seven is completion so Jesus was showing that the Sabbath day is going to be completely changed I says I'm saying on Sunday it's not it's you know Sunday as our natural day built in to be our day of rest for most people and I know brother Aaron has to work on Sundays but for most people it's bill in it's a natural day of rest we don't go to our regular jobs but that's not the real Sabbath the real Sabbath is you ceasing from your works and doing what the Holy Ghost has called you to do that's the real Sabbath entering into the real rest where you rest in the finished work and the blood of Jesus Christ amen and because I'm resting on that I want to do something for Jesus for his glory but see he healed a withered hand on the Sabbath he cast out an unclean spirit he owed a peter smother in law he healed a woman and Luke 13 let's read that when I don't know what that one was I I don't remember that one Luke 13 11 which woman was that oh we have the spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and can no wise lift herself up she couldn't even lift herself up she's so tied up together and jesus healed her on the Sabbath day hey man that is something a woman who couldn't work now she can work amen now she'll have to sit there all the time and it's a day of rest but on the day of rest God's still working amen I like that God working when we take a rest or we take a break god never takes a break he's always working amen he said he took the one break on the day of the seventh day but then Satan interrupted it right he's been working ever since even cuz gods outside of time amen gods outside of that and he works on the Sabbath the man with drops he was healed by Christ the impotent man was healed by Christ and the man born blind seven miracles right on the Sabbath day he was completing any doubt about the Sabbath days completing and saying it's not a about a day it's about the power of God amen that's right seven completion now this is what I've been writing a book on I wrote about 6,000 words on this chapter there are seven parables complete that completely reveal there's work complete seven is completion completely reveal the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 13 so I wrote a chapter on that and it's the next book I'll be working on here I'm actually on the third chapter right now I'm working on the Godhead chapter because there's 12 New Testament mysteries I got the introduction chapter done I got this chapter and then I'm working on the Godhead so the first parable is the sower in the foregrounds and this revelation is that there's four heart reactions to hearing preaching about Jesus Christ there's four there's only four reactions there's four type of grounds and church we need to have good grounds that means good honest hearts we can't have hearts that let all the cares of the world live as we were saying last Wednesday choke it out we can't let things choke out our spiritual life we've got to choke out the devil amen we've got to choke out his life don't let him choke out our live oh I'm getting weaker and weaker weaker as a Christian say no devil I'm gonna choke you I'm gonna squeeze you the life out of your life whatever you say I'm gonna squeeze your little neck in it I'm gonna get the victory I'm more than a conqueror amen squeeze out his life you and I not gonna be the wayside you proved it by your life I proved it by my life we're not by the wayside and we're not on stony ground or anything like that we've got to be careful that the devil doesn't we don't let the devil squeeze out our life we've got to squeeze out his life the weed the tares number two and the revelation is that each person is either a child of God or Satan and the churches are full of both brother man have said the field is the church ages remember brother Simon preached that he found that with such a revelation to him and me to the field is the church ages and their house Oh father's full of wheat and tares Satan you know started off good but then Satan brought in all these deeds of Nicolaitans doctrines of Balaam and all these Jezebel religion and now it's just full of tears but there's a few we in there still and that's what he's coming back for amen amen he's coming back for weak takuya the third one is the grain of mustard seed brother man said the false church started out small like a grain of mustard seed but it grew until it's full large and filled with all demonic powers so brother Graham in the church age book likens the Roman Catholic Church to a church that started off as a grain of mustard seed but it grew so great to announce the biggest Church in the world it's got almost two billion members there's only 7 billion people on the earth Church and it's almost got two billion the fourth one is the leaven hid in three measures of meal and this has to be this cannot be the true church because the true church does not deal with leaven we see what's your sin it has to be the Roman Catholic Church again that she hides lies the this threefold lies and her teachings until the entire doctrine is fully corrupted and of course what were those three measures Father Son Holy Ghost I've been studying on that there's a lot of history on that there's a lot of false doctrine on that or I'm sorry it exposes the false doctrine on the Trinity now Church did you know this the Roman Catholic Church did not declare that the holy ghost was a person until 381 ad can you believe that brother Aaron it took them almost four hundred years to realize the Holy Ghost was a person but right after on the day of Pentecost Peter got lied to you by Ananias and Sapphira and Peter says you've lied to the Holy Ghost and because you've lied to the Holy Ghost you're gonna repack your body out of here dead and then a few verses later Luke records it as they lied to God amen Peter said the Holy Ghost Luke said God so the early disciples knew that the Holy Ghost is a person the Holy Ghost is God but it took the Trinitarians almost 400 years to know that the Holy Ghost was a person amen oh it's so foolish it's so full of folly and what are they doing Church all behind it is they're mimicking all those false three-person God's the Hindu one and I forget all the other ones I haven't I need to study on that I'm not done with that chapter I'm still working on the chapter but see it said three measures three measures of living this the father that false life father son only goes now it was God Father Son Holy Ghost of course he is not my person but by manifestation praise God but see 11 always as sin in the Bible 11 is all wasted I've never found one scripture where 11 was actually a good thing it's all here up here is always represents sin now number 5 the treasure in a field brother man or the Bible says a true believer joyfully trades all his possession at the surprising opportunity to gain Christ so this one's about when u s-- Christ surprises your life did he surprise your life one day the Bible said the man was just look in the field and all of a sudden oh the joy that he found this treasure oh it's just hidden I wasn't even looking for that's how it was for me in the message he meant I wasn't looking forward I long hair I was gonna be in the NFL I thought I was gonna be some bigshot but all of a sudden I stumbled on the message of the hour and it surprised me but that's okay I went and sold out everything to buy the field that had the treasure amen I could thank God it's been a real treasure praise to the heart but a greater treasure than anything else I never would have made the NFL but I just I thought I was so don't let people tell you I never would have made the NFL I doubt it very very much now a number six the one probe great price a true believer abandons his search for many spiritual truths in order gain the one most valuable truth that's Christ he member because the Bible said he's he's he already seeking goodly pearls he wants a lot of great troops and people can find good things about Mahatma Gandhi they can find good things maybe Mohammed said or all these spiritual truths but when you find the one Pearl great price all these other things that are good you realize the only thing that's good about it is because they borrowed from Jesus ain't it so I get rid of all these little pearls and I'll just take the one great pearl praise God the pearl of great price like there's good things in Taekwondo mankind I've been learning about even Confucianism it's a good thing like it's recent you know a part of its good respecting elders there's nothing that's a good thing to do you know showing honor to the outer day those are the Bible talks about that give double honor to the elders you know you give them double honor and there's good things but those are all just little pearls but where we find Christ we find the true reality of elders because they take it too far they take it where you only have to follow everything your grandpa says if the oldest person alive in your family if they say no to Christianity you've got to follow because you got to honor your elders now see that's just a small pearl and that's alive from hell that's an evil thing and we ought to be able to forsake that to find the real pearl Jesus Christ and no matter how old somebody is you respect them you love them but you love them with the love of Christ and Jesus said if you love me he said you'll forsake father mother sister brother husband father-in-law mother-in-law you'll forsake everything he said I come to bring a sword in your house amen hallelujah to see Confucianism is like little tiny pearls but we don't want that we want the pearl of great price amen and anything that would shine in Confucianism or Hinduism anything that would seem good is already in Christ they just borrowed and stole from him is that right hallelujah because he's the source of every good and perfect gift he's the source of life everything comes from God I'd rather have the one pearl of great price and last when the net Caston to see at the end of the world the gospel will attract believers and unbelievers but God's angels separate the wicked away from the holy isn't it interesting on the seventh and final parable Jesus specifically says this is an endtime parable and then brother man come preach it in 1965 the anointed ones at the end time praise God that's the last parable is about how the gospel will attract all kinds of sinners and saints good people bad people why because everybody loves God's anointing I've never I've met so many church people that cut their hair wear makeup wear pants win it and they say when we talk about God I've had so many people tell me oh I got goose bumps when I'm talking about Jesus Church who doesn't like feeling the presence of God do you have your met ever somebody who doesn't like the Friends of God why because it's sweet it's holy it's loving but the thing is you just can't feel the goose buns to say okay now I'll go cut my hair or now I'll go wear makeup or something like that you got to get in the goose bumps and let that guide you to the Word of God amen go wash your face or let your hair grow out or something like that that's you got the goose bumps do to motivate you to inspire you to look to the God of the Bible amen but this right here to me the revelation this is anointed ones the endtime the gospel attracts everybody it'll tract everybody but only but all the ones that are not true trout rainbow trout they all get thrown back they'll get throw back but God's gonna keep all the good ones praise God he's gonna keep you church that's right alright did you know this this is all these were new to me well this one was new to me actually yeah this was already new I preached this one before did you know there are seven gifts in the get in the book of Romans you know this so outside of the nine gifts of the Spirit and outside the fives there's seven other gifts did you know that I didn't know that I'm gonna have to start apply that somehow to my sermons well there's half an hour how did that happen there's the list seven gifts now we already have that gift of prophecies I'm not sure about that but it's a list seven in this context prophecy ministry exhortation isn't it is it interesting how some people just they can encourage anybody that's a gift exhortation is a gift comfort giving is a gift some people just have a gift to give that's all they know how to do they just give and some people have a gift to rule over others and then some people have a gift of God to show mercy that's where we see a lot of women right showing mercy as nurses or caregivers they can just show mercy when people don't deserve it they show mercy when other pieces well I couldn't put up with that I couldn't handle that I just couldn't do that but yet some people have so much compassion it just moves them to show mercy to others I don't appreciate God's gifts amen now there's seven listed here listed here there is some type of overlap right because that's the overlap to the nine gifts this is an overlap to the fivefold that's the overlap well that's overlapped to the fivefold too because there they kind of rule the church so yeah it's interesting but there's seven listed in those three scriptures verse six seven eight now this is one hour to preach on there are seven unities listed in Ephesians four there's one body one spirit one hope one Lord one faith one baptism and one god and father of us all seven unities there's that all these are one there they're all unified I think that's really striking seven of them not now I preached this before not long ago I think it was about a year ago there are seven complete character characteristics of wisdom did you know that see but the wisdom that is from above is first pure so wisdom is always pure there's nothing there's no selfish motives in wisdom then it's peaceable you'll feel the peace of God then it's gentle and easy to be intreated it's full of mercy and good fruits and it's without partiality so when someone really has to get the wisdom they're not partial to well I like this brother better I like that sister better so I'm gonna I'm gonna give my advice this no it's just impartial just what the word says and without hypocrisy so nobody's being a hypocrite nobody's trying to act like they're a Pharisee or a side you see or something that they're not right that's wisdom so wisdom has seven characteristics so if someone that says well have to get the wisdom then they have to meet these qualifications because that's complete wisdom right there that's complete it's finished that's wisdom right there all right now let's get our Bibles here let's finish up here and let's go through the book of Hebrews let's look through throw some of these these were so such a blessing to me as I was studying here this morning by God's grace woke up at 5:00 and try to get some good studying before work today all right did you know there's seven things that are completely better for us in the New Testament according to the book of Hebrews there are seven betters so let's read these SR in Hebrews 7 how many wanna leave out a better Christian tonight amen I do I'm gonna fall more in love with Christ on a girl know his word more I want to put I want to take more of what I preach and more of what I've read and apply it to my life I tell you that that situation with this boy in my class has really brought me back to a real closer walk with the Lord isn't it amazing how God uses trials in our lives to draw us closer back to him and at the end of it we just appreciate the Lord even more well thank you lord I don't understand it but I know all these things work together for my good for the glory of God all right Bob says we have a better hope now who would anyone like to help me read tonight here by God's grace a1 Lydia 719 okay so there has to be grace right so grace gives us a better hope than the law does hey men searching that something all those Saints remember all the Saints the Old Testament Saints that rose after Jesus rose had a good merit in Jerusalem maybe you'll come up we've got a better hope than the Hat it doesn't matter where you buried his body cuz I've already buried in Christ amen I got a much better hope that's about the begging my son maokai bury me in jefferson miller bury me he know in jerusalem i don't have to say that why because i'm already buried in christ amen honey that's a better hope hey man these bones could rot away and die and whatever whatever could happen but I've got a better hope in Jesus Christ thank you Lord all right 7:22 bye so much was Jesus made of a surety of a better Testament so speaking of the Melchizedek Priesthood and we're under a better Testament a better covenant amen Jesus was made a better covenant for us praise God alright better promises I like this one eighty six but now at the obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he's a mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises a man better we all want to get better right we all want to do better we can't get no better than this phrase God amen the blood of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit the unconditional covenant of God it doesn't get any better than this praise God you know that Michigan football coach I've heard him saying before cuz he used to be on the 49ers he said noe they have a cheer at the end of every game or practice they say nobody's got it better than us well I think I'd like to disagree with him because the Bible says seven times we've got it better than everybody Amen nobody's got it better than the bride of Jesus Christ amen okay what trials we go through it our ties this is just light affliction our life is but a little vapor we've got better promises amen hallelujah I guess Jim Harbaugh is that Wright brothers and Jim Harbaugh thank you the one that says that every year they lose to Ohio State so I don't know how much better they got it but church we're the ones who got it better praise the Lord now not because we're better but because Christ is better better to be on Jesus's side all right because we have better sacrifices 923 923 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these the Jesus Christ's sacrifice is a better sacrifice than all the blood of bulls and goats amen no doubt about that because those those things could even they could just for cover sins but the blood of Jesus Christ abolished sins and it also cleanses all the heavens as well the Bible says the heavenly things and wrote have said that's because when demons are around the throne he said it just makes it not as clean he said but the blood of Jesus Christ one day drive him all out and it'll be even heavens will be pure purged amen that's right 10:34 10:34 Hebrews 10 34 for he had compassion of me and my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your Goods knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and enduring substance so Paul saying you gave me gifts you gave me natural possessions he said but because you gave me your natural ones he says you I got your possessions but you've got better ones ha ha ha praise God that's why I church I don't mind giving if I'm low on money I said I don't mind giving a little bit of money away because you know what I got a better promise I got better possessions than that race is hard my numbers might be going [Music] my bank account might be good because you know that's how life is up and down up but even a lot of times I know if I see somebody in need my faith is dead if I can't help them out hey then if you see somebody cold and you don't help them out something's wrong with our faith if somebody asks you for something and you should be able to give it to them and hope they don't pay you back because you know God's gonna pay you back amen you don't know how you don't know when but he'll do it again he'll pay you back because when you lend to the poor you lend to the Lord ain't it so Paul says you got better possessions in heaven I've got your bread I've got your oil I've got the the gifts you gave me I got the food you gave me the meats he says but you've got better possessions because you gave to me the Bible says we got a better country we're going to that's good because I'm tired of the United States and all the contradictions and the government and all of all the troubles on the local level there's trouble everywhere we talk about there's trouble on every level I'm tired of disappointments and and promises broken by every president breaks the prophecy you know our George HW just passing the only thing I remember him forwards when he said read my lips no new taxes before he got elected and then he broke his promise and that in that said the church were going to a place where the president he never breaks his promise whatever he says it's gonna happen ain't it you can rest your soul on the promises of Jesus Christ amen that's the country we're going to know we were wrong I appreciate that United States more than other countries I do I appreciate the freedom here but I just get tired of seeing sin in fact it makes us cry it ought to make us cry we ought to sign cry for all the abominations done in America day man let's read it 11 16 but now it is a better country Amen that is and heavenly we're of God is not ashamed to be called their God for you have prepared for them HD Oh surprising that song where what will it be when we get over yonder it's a country where no shadows Twilight's deep in unending day where night will never be it's a city where no storm clouds ever gather now this is what just what heaven means to me we've got a better country common Church amen glory thank you lord we have a better resurrection eleven thirty five women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection praise God think about what kind of the resident you want to have not sure am I gonna say it or not well I just chose to make my life a little easier I kind of compromised on the word or I chose the sacrifice I chose the harder path because I want a better resurrection just puts it on us this puts it on you what kind of better will you choose what you want a better resurrection or her worst resurrection I want the better one so god help me to sacrifice whatever I need to sacrifice help me to give it up so I have a better resurrection amen and that's completely better this is completely better than every than the Old Testament and the church said better promises better sacrifice better Testament better a whole better country better resurrection better heavenly rewards everything's better oh thank you lord amen it's all better praise God and then beside this is only gonna get better praise God you know people senators like to say that oh the best is yet to come and really for them it's not actually the worst is yet to come but for us the best is yet to come because we have a better promise we have better rewards we have a better resurrection coming I don't want to be a part I don't want to be in the second resurrection I want to come up in the first that's matter the first is better I want to come up at the rapture amen and meet Jesus Christ in the air as a faithful servant of God I want a better resurrection so that's why I'm here tonight try to make myself ready his wife has made herself ready oh thank you lord did you know there are seven titles for Jesus Christ in the book of Hebrews seven I didn't know that till this morning the Bible says he's the heir of all things praise God he deserves it you know why because he gave everything he sacrificed he laughed off heaven to die on earth so he deserves everything he deserves inherit everything because he he left his crown or arrested left his throne and crown to become one of us praise God that we might become like him glory he's the captain of our salvation he's the captain of our deliverance amen he knows all about it he's planted all out he's the the Bible said he's the Apostle and high priest of our profession praise God he's the great apostle you ever think about that Christ came an apostle he went and sought you out as a missionary do you ever think about that Jesus was the missionary that really saved you did you ever think about that Simon is one that brought me the message but really it was Jesus in Simon because Jesus is the apostle he's the one that spreads he's the one that goes in the places where the words never gone I'm so glad the Apostle Christ came to me praise God I'll send a message after church say thank you for letting Jesus be an apostle in your in your life he's the author of salvation he wrote the book he wrote the script and I'm so glad that he he wrote me as part of his script praise God he's the forerunner he went before us praise God he paved the way the Bible said he loved us before we loved him praise God the Bible said that we love Him because He first loved us while we were dead and said Christ loved us and Christ died for us he was the forerunner he's the high priest there it is like Aaron the high priest of our profession give me 50 more minutes I'll try to finish up here that was 45 minutes right there so it looks like it's gonna be a Howard again boy well maybe that's good maybe ours it's just what I need all right now cross Christ is also the author and finisher now remember we already saw him he's the author here he's the author of the faith he's author of salvation he's author and finisher of our faith praise God now this is what I like here right here Church finisher how many glad how many know he's gonna finish your life he's gonna complete it he's the one that started he's the author he's the one that's gonna complete it so the Bible gives him seven complete names in the book of Hebrews to completely show what he is oh he's everything to me praise God he's my father my sister my father my mother my sister my brother he's everything to me he's heir he's captain he's apostle author forerunner high priest finisher he's everything to me praise God oh thank you Lord did you know there's seven once and I looked this up two or once and for all is in the book of Hebrews there are seven of them once the high priest entered once in the holy place per year Christ appear once to put away sin glory it's appointed two men to die once and then the judgment Christ once offered to bear the sins of many he was offered once not many times the Bible said not daily like the high priests had to do in the Old Testament but once and for all he was offered the worshipers once purged should have had no conscious of sin so he was showing how once wasn't good enough for the Old Testament God will shake heaven oath once more amen haha and then the Bible says the next verse and this word yet once more will he give to the people so he repeats it once more amen God's going to shake all things heaven earth now church do you know what the Bible says there when God takes everything all that's not on Jesus falls but all those who are in Jesus they stand on the rock amen that's just like the world you know I saw that out in Japan you know last time Japan had a major earthquake there's a big report about some of the buildings stood because they were shockproof buildings oh that's what Jesus did when he sent the Holy Ghost to you he gave you a shockproof foundation amen all of us shake and all the earthquakes all the storms all the howling winds are saying can never put you off your foundation because you got a shockproof foundation a holiday up and you're not gonna fall it's not follow order it's not gonna fall apart it's not gonna be destroyed you're established on better things you're established on the rock Jesus Christ amen thank you lord amen I can't fall I can't go back in the world because I'm founded on a rock amen hallelujah because you know the author of that earthquake is the one that built my foundation so he knows how the heavy that he knows how bad that earthquake seemed to me you know how high it's going to go on the Richter scale whether 7.0 8.0 probably 7.0 because it's completion right probably 7.0 but he knew that he's I've got to build a foundation that Jesse can stand it's got a wish stand the shock so I'm not going to give him a earthquake he can't handle Amen I'm gonna build this foundation on my word hey man thank you Lord once and for all there seven once and for all well I'm so glad about that I'm so glad I worried about that last shaking because even if I even if things shake I'm still gonna stand did you know there are seven let us now this is what we could use help with church right here tonight by God's grace how many want to do this now remember these three are all in that part about gather more come to church more as you see that day approaching all these are in that same portion because verse 24 and 25 it says we're gather more as you see the Day approaching so it says let us draw near with a true heart we need to say God help me to come to church every time with a true heart I don't want to falsely come and and try to have some ulterior motive on coming to church my whole brother Aaron brings food tonight and if so boy we're gonna eat all I'm the first in line yeah well I wonder what to preach I'm just gonna try it like we've had people come here Church before that have come here just to find fault with my preaching that's only reason they came to church to find fault with brother Branham and they've told me that so I'm not making it up they've told me that they came they gathered not with the true heart they gathered with the wrong heart because they came to find fault then when they couldn't stand it anymore about my preaching then they stopped coming or they thought they found fault with me or brother they leave they found the faults they won to find that's not a true heart let us hold fast the profession of our faith hold it fast let's not let's not say something different let's always say what the word says let us consider one another on this consider means to look closely upon so I'm gonna consider sister Connie I gotta look real closely at her and that's what the Bible says when we come together you got to look at other people and see how they're feeling you gotta be able to look and see oh do they feel good today or do they need prayer we're supposed to look at other people and consider them how we might provoke them and that just means inspire them maybe that means saying oh do you need any money or can you need any prayer how are things going this week do you have a good week in the Lord how's your family doing you got to look at people and consider them let us consider other people how we can inspire them praise the Lord now search sometimes I'll get to this maybe on the next time I preach well you can inspire people by singing a special you can inspire people by testifying my sister Connie our sister Beatrice has such a fiery fiery testimony praise the Lord that's gonna really inspire me to go pray for this situation in my life and honestly Church that's what God wants God wants you and I to inspire one another I see I felt inspired to tell that little testimony about my failure today and I just prayed God let me make it right I felt inspired to share that hope that inspires you because that God knows I wanted to make it right God knows I didn't mean to say that I was just in this in the flesh but the Holy Spirit helped me get out of the flesh hey man let us lay aside every way and run the race with perseverance let us do that let bride of Christ do that let us have grace to serve God accept ibly not law let us have grace now that doesn't mean we don't obey the word but it doesn't mean we don't we don't quit or we don't we don't bash somebody if they just make one mistake cuz I just told you about my mistake tonight right let us go forth under him I love this without the camp go outside of the RET the heat he was saying Jesus had to go outside the camp he had to go outside of Jerusalem in other words brother Hamza preaches that and he says it's spiritually we've got to go outside denomination we've got to go outside man-made tradition we've got to go outside of anything that's not a pleasing to God we've got to go outside we've got to leave that let us go out of that and go to the word Christ and let us by him I love this offer the sacrifice of praise by our lips I hope that's your prayer Church I hope when you come in here you say lord help me to worship you with your help because the Bible says by him Jesus helped me to worship you because doctors except you burped I don't worship with Jesse Smith spirit because that won't do me any good I've got a worship by his help by his spirit how many when worship like that amen but RAM said you are supposed to be a participant in the feeling of the Holy Spirit in the church in other words I shouldn't be or just one of you shouldn't be the only one who feels excited about God or feels like they love God we've all got to participate in that us a God by you let me offer the sacrifice of praise for my lips seven let us seven I think that's good for our church wouldn't it be great if everybody the church all did this wouldn't be great if everybody in the message did that let us it's us it's for us it's for a group of believers to do this all right did you know there are seven eternal things in the book of Hebrews this just keeps going on and on this that's why I was saying this book is eternal church this is an eternal book and here it is eternal the Bible says there's eternal salvation there's eternal judgment now didn't say burn eternally it just said that judgment lasts like brother Jason preach that judgment will last for eternity and those who are judged as sinners they're that judgment is going to last in other words they're gonna be annihilated though they'll never exist anymore but the judgment upon them will stand forever or eternally but God's mercy on judging us will be still standing eternally as well Melchizedek is eternal because he's without beginning of days or ending of life he's eternal Christ has the power of an endless life eternal life there's eternal redemption and the Bible said we do not grieve the Eternal Spirit of God and the Bible says we have an eternal inheritance amen no you might get an earthly inheritance on the earth but eventually is going to run out but with Jesus his inheritance is never gonna run out that's yeah amen that's the best inheritance I could ask for praise God I know I'm really gonna get nothing from my mom or dad and that's fine but as long as I get that eternal inheritance that's all the cattle tape it on the new you and again I'm not going for fours just give me just lay at his feet for a thousand years let me just be there with Jesus Christ I'm not I'm not begging I'm not competing I'm just saying Lord Jesus let me be faithful and let me just inherit eternal life if anything comes out for that that's just icing on the cake but of course I want to be sanctified of course okay I got five minutes yeah five minutes did you know now we're finally outside of Hebrews are you happy about that what a great book there's seven firstfruits mention in the Bible the first fruits of the Holy Spirit he said both Jew and Gentile Romans 8:23 so the day of Pentecost right there's firstfruits of the bride tree in Romans 11 16 which is referring to these now this is this is what I like there's firstfruits of the city of a ki and one of the man's name was at pnts or the first believers the Christians Christ on Sarno Christ is the firstfruits of them that slept so Jesus is that first fruit wave offering amen everybody says the brother branham but I just heard brother bam say it's the message the word the message is way before the people praise God the first one they come to maturity is Christ and the Bible said Christ is the firstfruits of them that slept he's their firstfruits he's the first one that's mature praise God amen the Bible also says it which is interesting a ki Stefano says house was also these firstfruits the first Christian in that city was epic epic to need us so I'm not saying that right and it's the finest they're the firstfruits now this made me shout last year I may not get excited this year but church I'm the firstfruits of Akron hallelujah I received the message in Akron and I'm a pastor dacron I'm the first one I know that receives the message inaccurate hey how did he have raised God I am the firstfruits and if you got saved in Akron and got the Holy Ghost and a cure to God we receive the message in Akron then you're part of the firstfruits of Akron June you might be man that's okay it's a good as place as any any place where you're a first fruit any place where you've got the baptism holy ghost is a good place to be hey man we probably got first fruits of Ghana back there in the back don't we sister Beatrice first fruit of Ghana yeah amen thank you no hard amen that's right if you're the first believer or one of the first group of a move there you got the Holy Ghost here one of the first fruits that's the word now the believers are firstfruits of his creatures which are the new creation Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God and so he was the beginning were the end amen and we appreciate this last Wednesday night revelation 14 the 144,000 are the firstfruits unto God so after the Gentile branch is cut off God grafts in the Israel branch and then the 144,000 are the firstfruits that come out of that branch amen were the last fruits right who are the last ones on that layer see a branch that is cut off after you harvest those and then he gets the firstfruits the 144,000 oh thank you lord let's I'm closer with this I'm going right here that's the last ones I'm gonna do did you know this there are seven blessings in the book of Revelation 7 the book of Revelation says blessing seven times come on you if you and I obey the Word of God amen because hearers are not justified churchgoers are not blessed it's those who take what the church says and lives it Hey look it look what it says now look I put the whole scriptures up here so I'm not going to paraphrase bless it he that readeth and then hear the words of prophecy and then that keep those things that are written there and so there's one for keeping and doing the Word of God and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord branch forth yay say the spirit that they met or a rest from their labors and their works to follow them so that one doesn't say specifically but it does talk about good works number three behold I come as a key as a thief sorry blessed is he that watches and keeps his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame keeping the word keeping clean number four and he said to me write blessed are they which are called the marriage supper of the Lamb and he said to me these are the true sayings of God now you know the scripture the bride has to do what make herself ready so that really counts she has to make herself ready the next one blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power they shall be priests of God in Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years we already got four right here it is the last one right no there's two more behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book amen now there's five see Church we got to keep the Word of God I don't just want I just don't want to say brother am said brother I have said brother have said I want to say brother Ram said and I did that's what I want to say brother Ram has preached this and I and I experienced it that is true brother him said to do it I did it and I got the same results Amen that's right blessed are they that do so six out of the seven specifically say or refer to keeping the Word of God praise the Lord I think it's pretty clear if you want to be blessed Church what do we gotta do we got to do the Word of God we have to do it and that means we gotta have true hearts like we saw we got to come to church we got to participate we got to consider one another we got to do what the Word of God says that they might have a right to the Tree of Life in other words you got to meet the requirements if you want to eat on the Tree of Life how many would

left off here did you know there are seven steps in Jesus humiliation his crucifixion I didn't know that and there's seven there's exaltation as well I didn't know that so we get to these other ones
