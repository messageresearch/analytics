[0:01] This is part 18 and I actually would
[0:04] actually I'm not going to change it but
[0:05] this should really be part 19 because
[0:07] brother Simon preached part 18 for us
[0:09] last Wednesday. How many thankful for
[0:11] that? Wouldn't that beautiful? Uh my
[0:13] brother Rod Simon comes in here. I was
[0:15] at home with my wife with the baby and
[0:17] Simon preaches a s just a sermon and
[0:20] hits like the highlights of the whole
[0:22] book of first Corinthians, right? and
[0:24] I've preached 17 sermons and Simon
[0:26] didn't know that. And it was such a a
[0:29] vindication of the Holy Ghost. So, I was
[0:32] so thankful. I didn't let Simon know
[0:34] yet, but I thought that was a
[0:35] masterpiece. I thought it was just a
[0:37] true word from the Lord. Uh we're so so
[0:41] thankful by God's grace. Hallelujah. I
[0:44] loved how he was, you remember, he was
[0:45] using those quotes about division and
[0:47] speaking against your pastor, right?
[0:48] We've just gone through that. You know,
[0:49] Simon doesn't know what's been going on.
[0:51] Uh, so what a vindication of the Holy
[0:53] Ghost. Praise God. And I just love how
[0:55] he ended it there with uh, you know, the
[0:58] book ends with the greatest of all
[1:00] things is love, right? And if you get
[1:01] love right, you'll get the gifts right
[1:03] and then you'll go in the rapture.
[1:04] Hallelujah. Because the chapter 15 is
[1:06] about the rapture. Praise
[1:08] God. Oh, I was just so I'm I'm so
[1:11] thankful that God uh moves by his Holy
[1:13] Spirit. Praise God. Oh my, we're so
[1:15] blessed to be in his presence. And what
[1:18] another vindication God's with us.
[1:19] Praise God. So, 1 Corinthians 10:16 and
[1:23] then
[1:24] 11:26. Same verses I used a couple
[1:26] Wednesdays ago before my wife had the
[1:29] baby. So, I'm getting as many many
[1:32] snuggles as I can. The baby's now nine
[1:34] days old, brother. And I'm I'm kissing
[1:36] her. I do about 20 kisses on one side of
[1:38] the cheek and I go about 20 kisses on
[1:41] the other side. I'm enjoying this be our
[1:44] last one. It's it's at least by surgery.
[1:46] It's going to be our last one. So, I
[1:48] want to enjoy this uh newborn stage as
[1:50] much as I can by God's grace. So, 1
[1:53] Corinthians
[1:57] 10:16. Remember, the Bible says, church,
[1:59] that the the fruit of the womb are the
[2:01] reward of God. They're God's rewards.
[2:03] So, we just take it as a real gift from
[2:04] the Lord, and we're thankful for God's
[2:06] amazing grace. Verse 16, I'll read this.
[2:11] Well, you know, we all can read it and
[2:12] then we'll go to 11:26. 1020 I'm sorry
[2:14] 10:16 and then 11:26 pardon
[2:18] me. Let's read that on three. One, two,
[2:20] three. The cup of blessing which we
[2:23] bless, is it not the communion of the
[2:26] blood of Christ? The bread which we
[2:29] break, is it not the communion of the
[2:32] body of Christ? Hallelujah. Then
[2:36] 11:26. So the bread and the cup are
[2:39] signs of that we're having communion
[2:41] with the Lord Jesus Christ in 11:26
[2:47] here. Let's read that on three. 1 2 3.
[2:50] For as often as ye eat this bread and
[2:53] drink this cup, ye do shu the Lord's
[2:56] death till he come. May God add his
[2:58] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[3:00] can be seated. Praise
[3:02] God. So you can switch over. I got some
[3:04] uh verses here and some things I want to
[3:06] uh share here tonight by the grace of
[3:08] the
[3:10] Lord. So again, we're thankful, you
[3:12] know, that was a wonderful masterpiece,
[3:14] Brother Simon preached for us uh u you
[3:17] know, last Wednesday on uh Corinthian uh
[3:19] Corinthians. And uh I'll probably go
[3:21] back and listen to it again and preach
[3:22] on it again here by God's grace. But um
[3:25] let's here continue go going. Uh a
[3:27] couple Wednesdays ago, I was looking at
[3:28] there's five at least five Old Testament
[3:30] examples of communion. We call them
[3:32] foreshadowings in the Old Testament uh
[3:35] before we even get to the New Testament.
[3:37] Praise God. Uh but before we get to the
[3:39] second one here, let's look at communion
[3:41] again. This is according to the the
[3:42] lexicon here. So communion, the the
[3:45] communion of the bread and the communion
[3:48] of the cup. It means fellowship or
[3:51] association or the community or the
[3:54] joint participation or intercourse to
[3:57] share with uh which one has in anything.
[4:01] So we can read those. I like this one
[4:02] right here. Intimacy. Praise God. So
[4:05] when we have communion with the Lord,
[4:06] it's especially the the the cup and and
[4:08] the the the the cup and the bread. It
[4:11] shows that we're intimate with Christ.
[4:13] We know him more than just a general
[4:16] terms of him, right? We know his very
[4:18] heart. Hallelujah. And and we know what
[4:20] he wants done. As brother Ram said, we
[4:22] know what he wants done with the word.
[4:24] Hallelujah. And we know many churches
[4:26] don't know what he wants done with the
[4:28] word. They let women preach. That shows
[4:29] they don't know what God wants done with
[4:32] the word. Hallelujah. They let the women
[4:34] strip off their clothes and just
[4:35] holiness is an easy one for us to see,
[4:37] you know. Uh so it shows when they when
[4:39] they dress unholy, they dress sexy sex
[4:41] sexy, whatever, and they let women
[4:43] preach or they they call God three
[4:45] persons and no scripture for it and they
[4:47] they take a uh they take
[4:49] transubstantiation, we'd say, in the
[4:51] Catholic church, or they give uh the
[4:52] prayer beads, the the merry Hail Mary
[4:55] beads, and all these things, it shows
[4:56] they don't have an intimacy with Christ.
[4:58] They don't know the real word of God.
[5:01] Hallelujah. But we do. And we should be
[5:03] thankful that God has revealed the truth
[5:05] to us. Praise God. And we should keep
[5:06] reaching out to those who want to know.
[5:08] Hallelujah. So, uh, we looked at this
[5:11] last time, the the three purposes in
[5:13] these verses of communion. We see the
[5:15] benefits of communion, the examination
[5:17] of communion that's required, and the
[5:20] proclamation. Uh, communion proclaims
[5:22] something to each one of us, right? It
[5:24] even proclaims something to God. It
[5:26] proclaims to God that we want to have
[5:28] intimacy with him. Hallelujah. So the
[5:31] word uh blessing there in the Greek
[5:33] means a benefit. So the cup of benefit
[5:35] which we bless. Now church, I've been
[5:38] taking communion uh my whole life, but I
[5:40] really didn't start taking it seriously
[5:42] till I got saved around 2000. And so I
[5:45] can see from 2025 years, I can see
[5:48] blessings all over my life. Hallelujah.
[5:50] Uh so many blessings I can hardly count
[5:52] them. Can you see that many? Hallelujah.
[5:54] I hope you can see many blessings over
[5:56] your life. And I'm talking about
[5:58] spiritual, not just physical, but
[6:00] spiritual blessings over your life. In
[6:02] other words, the power to overcome sin.
[6:05] The power to come back to God if we've
[6:07] fallen short. Hallelujah. The power to
[6:09] see gifts and miracles. Praise God.
[6:11] Hallelujah. Oh my. There's so many
[6:13] blessings that come along with it.
[6:15] Supernatural power. And there's
[6:17] character power because we know that's
[6:18] all we're taking with us is our
[6:20] character. Praise God. Hallelujah. We're
[6:22] not taking our money. We're not taking
[6:23] our our necessarily our our physical
[6:25] clothes or our homes or vehicles. Alls
[6:28] we're taking with us is our soul. Praise
[6:30] God. Our soul and spirit. Hallelujah.
[6:32] The Bible said they go back to the
[6:34] creator who formed them. Hallelujah. So,
[6:36] we want to recognize there's more than
[6:38] just physical benefits. Hallelujah.
[6:40] There's of course spiritual and I'd
[6:42] argue uh maybe with a godly argument
[6:44] that that's more important the spiritual
[6:46] benefits than the physical. Praise God.
[6:49] And also now it also means we uh show so
[6:52] the part of communion is uh uh showing
[6:54] forth the Lord's death and that means to
[6:57] declare it to make it known. Hallelujah.
[7:01] And church you know when when people
[7:02] learn about our lives many times and
[7:04] they they say wow you go to church that
[7:06] many times or you you really believe
[7:08] that you dress that way. When people
[7:10] really learn that about your life it's
[7:12] actually showing forth it's declaring
[7:14] the gospel to other people. Hallelujah.
[7:17] Uh it it declares that like I remember
[7:19] Aacia last year at uh at the horse
[7:22] lessons when when her friend and her
[7:24] were talking her case got to share
[7:26] really what we believe and that was that
[7:29] was this that was showing the Lord's
[7:31] death because Aacia has to die to the
[7:33] things of the world to manifest the real
[7:36] life of Christ to her friends, right? To
[7:38] wear holy clothes and to not cut her
[7:41] hair and she has to die. It shows the
[7:44] Lord's death that she's died to herself
[7:46] and she's raised a new creation in
[7:48] Christ. Hallelujah. Same same thing for
[7:51] our brothers. Brother uh Rod used to
[7:52] invite me. You want to go drinking and
[7:53] golfing? You know, my my boss used to
[7:55] invite me. You want to go drinking and
[7:56] golfing? And I'd say no. And that was me
[7:59] showing the Lord's death. I've died out
[8:01] to those things. Hallelujah. I I don't
[8:04] partake in those things anymore. So,
[8:06] see, and that's what that's what the
[8:08] communion does. When we partake of the
[8:10] the Lord's cup and the Lord's bread,
[8:12] it's showing to all, right? It's showing
[8:14] to everybody that we're dying with
[8:16] Christ daily. Praise God. That's right.
[8:19] Now, last time we looked at
[8:22] uh uh by God's grace, uh we looked at uh
[8:25] Abraham and Melzdc for communion. Do you
[8:27] remember that? We looked at uh Melzdc.
[8:30] Melzdc was God with a flesh body on him.
[8:33] Hallelujah. A flesh body. But this is a
[8:36] very special uh visitation here. Let's
[8:39] go to Genesis
[8:42] 18. Let me set a timer here as well. By
[8:44] God's
[8:48] grace, you know, I was uh wanting to
[8:51] preach this last time, but I went so
[8:53] long on Melzdc. I never usually don't
[8:56] plan to do that, but it's just kind of
[8:57] how it happened. But let's here look at
[9:01] this one here by God's grace. Genesis
[9:03] 18.
[9:06] Now here where uh here's where we see
[9:08] Abraham here is waiting at the tent door
[9:11] in verse one. And the Lord appeared unto
[9:12] Abram in the plains of Mamry and he sat
[9:14] in the tent door in the heat of the day.
[9:18] Now my wife got me a book for my uh you
[9:20] know for Christmas and it actually has
[9:22] the site in archaeology arch
[9:26] archaeology. It has the exact site. The
[9:28] book has it where Abraham sat right
[9:30] there in memory. They have the place.
[9:32] It's still like some of the remains are
[9:34] still there. Hallelujah. And they have
[9:37] layers of it. So when Abraham was there
[9:39] and then they have the layer of when
[9:40] people came uh was it later a couple
[9:42] people oh the time of David they have
[9:44] the remains because they have the
[9:46] artifacts. Oh this matches this time
[9:47] period and then they even have uh then
[9:49] Christians came to dwell there about the
[9:51] time of Christ. There was Christians
[9:52] there too. So they have at least three
[9:55] layers. It's a nice little book. I've
[9:56] only got started on the first maybe 10
[9:58] pages of it. Uh but it's just been a
[10:00] neat thing to see that right there in
[10:01] Mamry. So they actually and there was an
[10:03] altar there. They they've actually been
[10:05] able to excavate that Abraham's altar
[10:07] where he sacrificed to God in Mamry.
[10:09] It's amazing. See God the Bible said God
[10:12] doesn't leave himself without a witness.
[10:13] Praise God. Hallelujah. They're still
[10:16] finding these uh they're still uh
[10:18] digging up all these uh findings. God's
[10:20] word will always return true.
[10:22] Hallelujah. It will not return void.
[10:24] Hallelujah. Thank God. So he sat in the
[10:27] tent door and he lift up his eyes and
[10:29] looked and three men stood by him. And
[10:31] when he saw them, he ran to meet them
[10:33] from the tent door and bowed himself
[10:34] down toward the ground. Now here we're
[10:36] going to show here's what you do when
[10:37] you when you commune with God. You bow
[10:39] down and worship him. And the church
[10:41] said, "Amen." Hope you bow down in your
[10:43] prayer closet, right? Or, you know, it
[10:45] can be a small room. It don't have to be
[10:46] a closet. But see, when God comes, we
[10:49] want to bow down and really worship him.
[10:51] Hallelujah. That's what Abraham did. And
[10:53] how many know that you're a child of
[10:54] Abraham, too? That's right. Hallelujah.
[10:58] How does Abraham act when God comes
[11:00] again? Now, he's already met God. How
[11:02] many times have he already met God? He
[11:03] met Melzdc. He heard God tell him to
[11:06] leave of Chaldis and go to to this land.
[11:08] You know, he's met him many times in
[11:10] visions. He saw visions of him. He's
[11:12] heard the voice of God numerous
[11:14] times. But notice no notice now he meets
[11:17] him in a new manifestation. And that's
[11:20] how we should have it. We should meet
[11:21] Jesus in different manifestations.
[11:23] Sometimes it's dreams. Sometimes it's in
[11:25] a sermon. Hallelujah. Sometimes it's
[11:27] meeting him in somebody else.
[11:29] Hallelujah. Right? So, so we want to
[11:32] meet Jesus that way. Sometimes it's
[11:33] through a prophecy, a word of wisdom, a
[11:35] word of knowledge, a word of faith.
[11:37] Sometimes it's prayer and the Holy Ghost
[11:39] just comes upon you. You know, there's
[11:41] many ways to meet Jesus. Hallelujah. But
[11:43] we know it's always him because he
[11:44] always acts the same way because his
[11:46] nature doesn't change. He's the same
[11:48] yesterday, today, and forever.
[11:51] And every experience we have with him
[11:52] will point us back to the word of God.
[11:55] Not to some creed or some tradition or
[11:57] some pleasure of the flesh or lust of
[11:59] the flesh or lust of the eyes, pride of
[12:01] life. It'll point us to a consecrated
[12:03] holy ghostfilled life. Hallelujah.
[12:06] That's right. Now he bows himself in
[12:08] verse three. He said, "My Lord, if now I
[12:10] found favor in thy sight, pass not away,
[12:12] I pray thee, from thy servant.
[12:15] Let a little water, I pray you, be
[12:17] fetched and wash your feet and rest
[12:19] yourselves under a tree. Oh my. So look,
[12:22] he bows down and then he washes his
[12:24] feet. And brother Ram said, "That's what
[12:26] we should do. It's like the woman who
[12:27] washed Jesus' feet. We should we should
[12:30] pray and we should bring tears and we
[12:32] should show God our love with tears."
[12:34] Amen. Hallelujah. See, it's more than
[12:37] just a more just well I come to church,
[12:39] I walk in the doors, I walk out. Show
[12:41] him some love. Hallelujah. Kiss the son
[12:44] lest he be angry. Hallelujah. Psalms
[12:47] chapter 2, I believe, if I'm not not
[12:48] mistaken. Kiss him. Show him. Show him
[12:50] how how good, great he is. Give him some
[12:52] praise. Hallelujah. We're in the house
[12:54] of God. This is God's house. Amen. He
[12:57] deserves our worship. Abraham says, "I'm
[12:59] going to bow down. Then I'm going to get
[13:00] some water. Then I'm going to wash your
[13:02] feet. Make you feel welcome."
[13:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Remember church,
[13:07] we've had uh Remember church, we had a a
[13:10] family. Now the family moved away but uh
[13:12] the brother remember he had a brother
[13:14] coming here he got married but then he
[13:15] moved away and remember his wife said
[13:17] she visited us for a couple months his
[13:19] wife said I I normally go to church that
[13:22] has 300 people it's a mega church a
[13:24] message megaurch and he but she said I
[13:27] feel more love in this place than I do
[13:30] at the mega
[13:31] church. Why? Because we shook her hand
[13:34] we pray with her. We greeted her. We
[13:36] fellowship with her. We didn't avoid
[13:37] her. And that's what Abraham is doing
[13:39] here. When God comes, Abraham shows him
[13:42] some attention. Praise God. And that's
[13:44] what we need to do. Show God's people
[13:45] attention, right? Show them love. Show
[13:47] them fellowship. Praise God. But also,
[13:49] most importantly above all that is
[13:51] giving God praise. Hallelujah. Giving
[13:54] God worship, giving God your prayers,
[13:56] giving him thanks, giving him your
[13:57] tears, giving shouts and claps.
[14:00] Hallelujah. Just making the Holy Spirit
[14:03] feel welcome.
[14:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank God. Hallelujah.
[14:09] That's
[14:10] right. Verse five. And I will fetch a
[14:12] morsel of bread and comfort your hearts.
[14:15] After that, you shall pass on. For
[14:16] therefore are ye come to your servant.
[14:19] So that's why he came. He come to
[14:22] fellowship with Abraham. See that?
[14:23] You're going to talk and then you're
[14:24] going to pass
[14:25] on. He come to spend time with us. God's
[14:29] spirit comes in our services to spend
[14:31] time with us. Yes. Verse six. And
[14:35] Abraham hastened in the tent unto Sarah
[14:36] and said, "Make ready quickly three
[14:38] measures of fine meal." Now, I don't I I
[14:41] forgot one time I studied this. I think
[14:42] it was two or three hours it would take
[14:44] to do all this bread and then kill these
[14:46] animals and then cook the the food. It
[14:49] was numerous hours. But notice, you
[14:51] think Abraham minded? No. He got to sit
[14:53] there and wash God's
[14:54] feet. Oh, he got to talk with God and
[14:57] the angels, right? Because it was God
[15:00] and two angels. God did not go down to
[15:02] Sodom. The two angels went down to
[15:04] Sodom. God stayed with Abraham. Ah,
[15:07] amen. And brother said that's a type of
[15:09] today. The Holy Ghost will stay with the
[15:11] bride who keeps all the word of God who
[15:15] doesn't crossdress and cut their hair
[15:16] and smoke cigars and and do all this
[15:19] nonsense and let women preach and
[15:20] Catholic Hail Mary beads. The angels
[15:23] will go to them, but God stays with
[15:25] Abraham's family. Hallelujah. That's us.
[15:28] Amen. Because we keep all the word of
[15:31] God. Hallelujah. Amen. That's right.
[15:35] Amen. Notice God never went down to
[15:38] Sodom. God sent the angels to save them
[15:41] out of Sodom. Hallelujah. God saved with
[15:44] Abraham. Hallelujah. Let's make sure
[15:46] we're Abraham's seed tonight.
[15:48] Hallelujah. That's right. I believe we
[15:50] are. But make your make sure your life
[15:52] is clean with God. Verse seven. And
[15:54] Abraham ran into the herd and fed. Now
[15:56] notice he ran. Here's an old man if I'm
[15:58] not mistaken. This is He's 99 if I'm not
[16:01] mistaken by my uh collection. He's 99
[16:04] and he can run. Now, church, remember,
[16:06] why could he do that? Because God is
[16:08] starting to change him back to a young
[16:09] man. Remember, the Bible said both his
[16:12] loins were dead and the deadness of
[16:14] Sarah's womb, right? So, God had to do a
[16:16] body change. He had to make the old
[16:18] young again. Oh, hallelujah. When was
[16:21] the last time you seen a 99y old run,
[16:23] Brother Austin? You ever seen one? There
[16:25] might be some viral Tik Toks out there,
[16:28] but it's very rare to see a 99 year old
[16:30] man run. Why? Because they're just
[16:32] older. They're breaking down. But not
[16:34] Abraham. Abraham could run, bow down,
[16:36] wash feet, because God is making him
[16:38] young again. Hallelujah. Glory. God is
[16:41] bringing his promise to pass. Amen. And
[16:44] this is a foreshadowing of the church
[16:46] going to get a body change. God's going
[16:48] to make all the bride young again to
[16:50] meet Jesus in the air.
[16:52] Oh, hallelujah. That's right. It's a
[16:55] It's a
[16:56] type. It's a foreshadowing of the
[16:59] rapture where the dead in Christ rise
[17:01] first. Of course, Abraham doesn't
[17:02] represent that. Abraham represents the
[17:04] living who uh no matter what age,
[17:06] they'll be changed to be young again to
[17:08] meet Jesus in the air. That's
[17:11] right. Now, he ran. I don't think I
[17:14] finished verse seven. And he fetched a
[17:16] calf tender and good, and gave it unto a
[17:18] young man, and he hastened to dress it.
[17:20] And he took butter and milk and the calf
[17:22] which he addressed and set it before
[17:23] them. And he stood by them under the
[17:25] tree and they didn't eat. So God's not a
[17:28] vegetarian. Brother man makes a little
[17:30] joke about that. And church, it's it's
[17:32] unhealthy to be just a vegetarian. It's
[17:34] unhealthy because there's so many uh my
[17:36] wife told me one time, I'm going to I'm
[17:38] going to chop it up. But there's certain
[17:40] things in the animal fats that we need
[17:42] to stay
[17:43] healthy. So even God modeled that. I'm
[17:46] not a vegetarian. Now, you can do that
[17:48] for a little time of fasting like
[17:50] Daniel. Remember, Daniel did a fast. He
[17:52] said, "I'm not eating pleasant meats.
[17:54] I'm just going to eat vegetables." And
[17:55] notice what happened. God honored that.
[17:57] And God sent the angel to answer his
[17:59] questions. See? So, but God comes and
[18:02] shows us vegetarian is not the way. And
[18:05] they said unto him, "Where is Sarah thy
[18:08] wife?" And he said, "Behold, in the tent
[18:09] and he said, I will certainly return
[18:11] unto thee according to the time of life.
[18:13] And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a
[18:14] son." And Sarah heard it in the tent
[18:17] door which was behind him. Now church
[18:21] notice this. Sometimes God talks and uh
[18:25] it's not maybe we'd say to your face
[18:27] it's behind you. So sometimes we hear
[18:30] whispers of God and maybe it doesn't
[18:32] sound like God's talking to us. Maybe
[18:34] God's talking about us. In other words,
[18:36] sometimes we maybe we don't feel like we
[18:38] hear directly from God, but we hear
[18:40] whispers of God.
[18:42] In other words, we got to have our ears
[18:44] open at all times to hear from God.
[18:46] Hallelujah.
[18:48] Right? Because even in Revelation 1
[18:50] verse 10, I don't have it up here, but
[18:51] even in Revelation 1:10, John said he
[18:53] heard a voice behind him and it was
[18:55] Jesus.
[18:57] Hallelujah. So, that just tells us God's
[19:00] not always going to tell us, okay,
[19:01] Austin do this, Austin that. Sometimes
[19:03] you hear something a little maybe from a
[19:05] a
[19:06] podcast. Charlie Kirk, we he told me a
[19:10] good testimony yesterday. a good
[19:11] testimony that relates to his testimony.
[19:13] Really beautiful. In other words, you
[19:15] can hear some somebody else's question
[19:17] and answer could be an answer to your
[19:19] life. Praise God. Hallelujah. So, in
[19:22] other words, we got to be listening all
[19:24] the time. Sarah wasn't being talked to
[19:26] by God, but God was talking about her.
[19:29] How many know this Bible talks about
[19:31] you? Hallelujah. The Gentile bride. Yes.
[19:34] Any scripture about the gentile bride or
[19:36] getting the bride ready for the rapture
[19:38] in the Old Testament, New Testament is
[19:40] talking about you and
[19:42] I. That's right. Amen. Esther is talking
[19:45] about you and I. Hallelujah. That's
[19:47] right. Rebecca is talking about you and
[19:50] I. Hallelujah. Sarah and Abraham is
[19:52] talking about you and I. Hallelujah. Oh
[19:55] my. All these examples down through the
[19:57] Bible, they're talking about us. It may
[20:00] not be say Jesse Smith or may not say
[20:02] Austin Laramie, but it's talking about
[20:04] us. It may not be right to us, but we
[20:05] hear the whispers of it and it's
[20:07] speaking to our hearts.
[20:10] Hallelujah.
[20:12] Glory. God even spoke to Ezekiel behind
[20:14] him. I'm going to read that one. Ezekiel
[20:16] 3 3:12. Ezekiel
[20:19] 3:12. I wrote that in my Bible as a a
[20:22] note. Yes. Then the spirit took me up
[20:24] and I heard behind me a voice of a great
[20:27] rushing saying, "Blessed be the glory of
[20:29] the Lord from this place." See, it's not
[20:32] always going to be right directly to
[20:34] you. Sometimes it's going to be just you
[20:36] hear the whispers of the Holy Spirit. Or
[20:38] somebody else is not even talking to
[20:40] you. You can just be bypassing somebody
[20:42] along and and just listen to somebody's
[20:44] testimony and that'll speak to you and
[20:45] they might not even be talking to you.
[20:48] Hallelujah. That's right. John heard it.
[20:51] Abra, I'm sorry. Sarah heard it. Ezekiel
[20:53] heard voices of God behind them. But
[20:55] listen, listen, church. They were
[20:57] listening. That's what we need to do.
[20:58] Listen for the voice of God. That's
[21:02] right. Now, when now Abraham and Sarah
[21:05] were old and wellstricken in age, and it
[21:07] ceased to be with Sarah after the man or
[21:09] women. Therefore Sarah laughed within
[21:11] herself, saying, "After I am waxed old,
[21:14] shall I have pleasure, my lord, being
[21:16] old also."
[21:18] So, she hears God's word and she laughs
[21:21] at it. Now, church, sometimes we might
[21:23] think, "Oh, how is God going to get how
[21:25] is God going to get me in the rapture?"
[21:27] And it might seem like
[21:29] laughable, but let me tell you, if
[21:31] you're in the bride, God's going to come
[21:33] and make you believe that word. We're
[21:35] going to start seeing prophecies come to
[21:37] pass. And the church
[21:39] said, "Hallelujah. We're going to start
[21:42] seeing more of what Brother Brandham
[21:43] said come to pass." And the church said,
[21:46] "That's right.
[21:48] Hallelujah.
[21:50] Amen." He says, "Now,
[21:54] uh, let's Yeah. Verse 13." And the Lord
[21:56] said unto Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah
[21:58] laugh, saying, Shall I of assurity bear
[21:59] a child which old?" Is anything too hard
[22:02] for the Lord? At that time appointed,
[22:05] I'll return to thee according to the
[22:06] time of life, and Sarah shall have a
[22:08] son. Church, is anything too hard for
[22:11] the Lord tonight? Hallelujah. But you
[22:14] just got to believe God and you got to
[22:15] be willing to wait. Praise God. God's
[22:18] not going to spoil us and do everything
[22:20] we want right away. God wants us to
[22:22] believe anything's possible, but we must
[22:24] wait on the God on God to move first.
[22:26] Hallelujah. Which made we must wait on
[22:29] the God of heaven to move in his right
[22:31] time. Notice it's like he told Sarah,
[22:33] it'll be according to the time of life.
[22:35] Hallelujah.
[22:38] Hallelujah. We got to be willing to wait
[22:40] till it's the right time of life.
[22:43] That's when God will return and God will
[22:45] answer great prayers we've asked for.
[22:49] Hallelujah. And now look at verse 15.
[22:52] Then Sarah denied saying, "I I laugh not
[22:54] for she was afraid." And he said, "Nay,
[22:56] but thou did laugh." Now we've all heard
[22:58] brother Ram say that. Brother Ram said,
[23:00] "God should have struck Sarah dead for
[23:02] lying to her." But God couldn't get rid
[23:04] of Sarah because she was part of the
[23:06] promise to
[23:08] Abraham.
[23:09] Hallelujah. Right? And God can't get rid
[23:12] of us because we're part of the promise
[23:14] to Jesus. We're his wife. Amen. Is that
[23:18] right? We're his wife. Amen. And we're
[23:21] going to a marriage supper. So, he can't
[23:22] get rid of us because we got to be
[23:24] there. We're the wife that he's
[23:25] marrying. Praise God. Amen. And then God
[23:28] will forgive our lies. Hallelujah.
[23:31] God will forgive our our sins that we
[23:34] commit, our iniquities.
[23:37] Real quick, I read this this week. Uh
[23:39] get go to go to uh go to Psalms 18 real
[23:41] quick. I read this this week. I saw a
[23:43] good scripture, church, about when we're
[23:45] under the anointing and living hard,
[23:47] living hard after the truth of God, God
[23:49] gives us victory over our
[23:51] iniquities. Give us uh Psalm
[23:59] 18. I was reading in my Bible uh Bible
[24:04] devotions. Yeah. Psalm 18.
[24:08] I want you to see what he says here. Uh
[24:10] verse 19. He brought me forth also into
[24:12] a large place. Now this is after David
[24:14] escaped
[24:16] Saul. Now look what he says. He
[24:18] delivered me because he delighted in me.
[24:21] Church, don't you know God loves your
[24:23] worship? Don't you know God loves it
[24:25] when you sing to him, read his Bible,
[24:28] and love him? Don't you know God loves
[24:30] that? He delighted in David. Amen.
[24:33] Because David was a man after God's own
[24:34] heart. Well, what whose heart are you
[24:36] after? I'm after the heart of Christ.
[24:38] Hallelujah. That's why I read the Bible.
[24:40] That's why I pray. That's why I listen
[24:42] to Brother Brandham. Hallelujah. Right?
[24:44] That's why I listen to other preachers,
[24:45] too, because I want to know my heart
[24:47] wants to know God's heart. Hallelujah.
[24:49] Amen. And I know God will perfect us
[24:51] through the five preaching gifts. That's
[24:53] in Ephesians chapter 4. remember uh the
[24:56] prophet uh apostle, pastor, teacher,
[24:59] evangelist. He he said the he said all
[25:01] these five will bring a unity of the
[25:03] faith and bring us to the fullness of
[25:05] the stature of Christ. Hallelujah.
[25:08] That's why listen to all the preachers.
[25:09] Hallelujah. The good ones now, not the
[25:11] bad ones, the good ones. Hallelujah. Now
[25:14] look at verse 20. Now look, church,
[25:15] look. The Lord rewarded me according to
[25:18] who? Whose righteousness? My
[25:21] righteousness.
[25:23] So this there's something to be said for
[25:25] you getting victory over your sinful
[25:27] human
[25:29] nature. I'm talking about I'm talking
[25:31] about when you obey God, God will reward
[25:34] you for bringing your body into
[25:36] subjection. When you get anointed by the
[25:38] Holy Ghost and your virtue overcomes uh
[25:41] any sin, your knowledge overcomes
[25:43] Satan's knowledge and and your patience
[25:46] overcomes your
[25:47] impatience. So instead of being
[25:49] impatient, you're actually patient. God
[25:51] will reward you for that. Hallelujah.
[25:54] Amen. Look at that. David said, "God
[25:57] rewarded me according to my," In other
[25:59] words, my obedience. God loves
[26:04] obedience. According to the cleanness of
[26:06] my hands, hack he had he recompensed me.
[26:08] You know, Austin, I prayed that numerous
[26:10] times. I've said, "God, remember I kept
[26:12] my hands clean from sinful
[26:14] things." I have. I haven't gone back
[26:17] after the uh evil things my hands used
[26:19] to touch. I haven't gone back. My hands
[26:21] only touch holy things now. Hallelujah.
[26:24] By the grace of God. Hallelujah.
[26:27] See verse 21. I've kept the ways of the
[26:30] Lord. Have not wickedly departed from my
[26:33] God. See, I was tempted. We're all
[26:35] tempted to leave God. But we didn't
[26:37] leave. We stayed.
[26:41] Amen. I did not leave the message. I've
[26:43] stayed in the message. Hallelujah. The
[26:46] Bible. Hallelujah. I've seen the Bible
[26:48] truth, the present truth for this day.
[26:51] We haven't left it. We've been faithful
[26:53] to it. And God sees our faithfulness.
[26:55] Hallelujah.
[26:57] Amen. This is a church. This is a Holy
[27:00] Ghost prayer. Who wrote the scripture
[27:02] again? Uh yeah, the Holy Ghost wrote it.
[27:05] Right. So, the Holy Ghost loves this.
[27:08] When people are righteous and they obey,
[27:11] God will hear their prayer, God will
[27:13] reward them. Praise God.
[27:17] He said, "I've kept the ways of God. I
[27:19] haven't departed. I haven't left the God
[27:21] and the truth." Verse 22, "For all his
[27:23] judgments were before me, and I did not
[27:25] put away his statutes from me. I was
[27:27] also upright before him, and I kept
[27:29] myself from my iniquity." That's where I
[27:32] want to get to right there. See, church,
[27:34] we all have iniquity. We all do sins
[27:36] that we shouldn't do. But what about the
[27:38] days when we we we we we feel tempted to
[27:42] do it, but we actually turn it down and
[27:44] we overcome it.
[27:46] That's what David was rejoicing in.
[27:48] David was saying, "I kept myself." In
[27:51] other words, I yielded to the Holy
[27:52] Spirit and I kept myself from my own
[27:55] iniquity, the sins that I would normally
[27:57] do. And the church said, "No, remember,
[28:00] don't forget all of his benefits. He
[28:02] forgives all your iniquities and he
[28:04] heals all your diseases. But there's
[28:06] going to be times when you get victory
[28:08] over the iniquities." Hallelujah.
[28:12] Isn't that a beautiful scripture? I just
[28:14] came across that this week again. I'm
[28:15] I'm almost uh I'm about probably uh
[28:17] twothirds of the way reading through the
[28:19] Bible
[28:22] again. See, and if you do that verse 24,
[28:25] therefore hath the Lord. Okay, see
[28:27] because he kept himself out of the sin
[28:29] he normally would commit. He didn't do
[28:31] the sin and go back into his sinful
[28:33] habits. because he kept himself out of
[28:35] his sinful habits. Therefore, the Lord
[28:37] hath recompensed me according to my
[28:39] righteousness, according to the
[28:40] cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
[28:42] With the merciful, thou will show
[28:44] thyself merciful. With the upright man,
[28:46] thou shalt show thyself upright. With
[28:48] the pure, thou wil show thyself pure.
[28:52] And with the froward, thou will show
[28:53] thyself forward. Hallelu. Isn't that a
[28:56] beautiful portion of scripture?
[28:58] So, this shows right here how God honors
[29:01] you when you can get victory over the
[29:03] sin nature. Hallelujah. And your your
[29:06] constant mind battles. You know, there's
[29:08] days we we do better than others. But
[29:10] let's let's have days where we do
[29:12] better. And then we when we pray, we can
[29:14] quote these scriptures. God, you're
[29:16] going to reward me. The Bible says
[29:18] without faith, it's impossible to please
[29:20] him. Hallelujah. Amen. Right? And he
[29:23] rewards all those who diligently seek
[29:26] him. Praise God.
[29:28] That's
[29:30] right. I feel that's why God blessed us
[29:33] with that ninth little baby there by
[29:34] God's grace because God's looked at our
[29:37] clean hands. We ha we haven't departed
[29:40] from God. We stay true to God.
[29:43] Hallelujah. While the world will want to
[29:45] abort them and delete them, we'll
[29:47] receive them just as God sends them.
[29:51] Hallelujah. Think about that. The world
[29:53] doesn't want them, but God's people want
[29:55] them. Hallelujah.
[29:56] That's a real sign somebody loves the
[29:58] Lord. Hallelujah. Now, okay, back to
[30:01] Genesis 18. I just thought I'd drop that
[30:03] in there. Maybe I could have saved that
[30:05] for for a full sermon,
[30:09] but Genesis
[30:11] 18. So, even so, S Sarah lies and God
[30:15] forgives her iniquity. Doesn't
[30:17] even God God can't can't kill her
[30:20] because she's part of the promise. And
[30:21] God knows we're all sinners who need
[30:23] God's grace. Hallelujah.
[30:25] She's part of Abraham. But look at now
[30:28] look. God corrects her just like Jesus
[30:30] would correct everybody. Right? God
[30:33] says, "No, you did laugh." She said, "I
[30:35] didn't laugh." God said, "No, you did."
[30:38] See how the Holy Ghost will correct all
[30:39] of our mistakes. Hallelujah. Don't tell
[30:43] us. Ain't ain't going to look past,
[30:44] well, I didn't see that. No. The Holy
[30:45] Ghost say, "You're wrong. You did. You
[30:48] sinned." And we ought to be thankful for
[30:50] a heavenly father like that.
[30:52] Hallelujah. Right. to tell us the truth.
[30:55] Verse 16. And the men rose up from then
[30:58] and looked towards Sodom, and Abraham
[31:00] went with them to bring them on the way.
[31:03] And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from
[31:05] Abraham that which thing I do? Seeing
[31:09] that Abraham shall surely become a great
[31:11] and mighty nation, and all the nations
[31:13] of the earth shall be blessed in him."
[31:16] Now, church, take a moment there.
[31:18] Remember that God is not going to hide
[31:20] what he's doing to Abraham. And what is
[31:24] he talking about? The destruction of
[31:26] Sodom. So, how does that relate to us?
[31:29] If we're the seed of Abraham, God's not
[31:31] going to hide from us what he's going to
[31:32] do to the sinful world. We're going to
[31:34] know about the judgments of God that are
[31:36] going to come and we're going to be kept
[31:38] from the judgments of God.
[31:41] Right?
[31:43] Hallelujah. So, we know what's going to
[31:45] happen to the LGBTQ whatever plus
[31:47] community they are. There's a million
[31:49] letters after that. just shows there's a
[31:51] million different devils to deceive
[31:53] them,
[31:55] right? But we know it's going to happen
[31:57] to them. God's going to do the same
[31:58] thing he did here in Genesis
[32:01] 19. See, but how many churches, like we
[32:03] saw, remember we saw in Obern. How many
[32:05] churches are uniting with that? Why?
[32:07] Because they're not God's friend.
[32:09] They're not the seed of Abraham. God's
[32:11] hiding that from them because they don't
[32:13] want to see it. But we're the people of
[32:16] God. We want to see it. So God won't
[32:18] hide it from us. In other words, God
[32:20] will reveal his secrets unto us.
[32:22] Hallelujah. And he has. Amen. Through
[32:24] God's prophet, brother Brandham.
[32:26] Hallelujah. Because surely the Lord God
[32:28] will do nothing except he reveals his
[32:30] secret unto his servant, the prophet.
[32:33] Hallelujah. Amos
[32:35] 3:7. I just love how this message ties
[32:38] the whole Bible together in this big
[32:40] beautiful knot. Brother Austin, it's
[32:42] just this like a big beautiful knotted,
[32:44] bowed up, beautiful present. God's tied
[32:47] it all up perfectly together. It's a
[32:49] present to
[32:50] us with thus sayeth the Lord.
[32:54] Amen.
[32:57] My God says, "Am I going to hide this?"
[33:00] Now, verse n, I love 19. Now, church,
[33:02] this is why it's so important to get
[33:03] your home in
[33:04] order, right? Why is God going to reveal
[33:07] this to Abraham? For I know him that he
[33:10] will command his children and his
[33:12] household after him. remember he had
[33:13] over 300 some uh servants back in
[33:15] chapter 14. I wonder how many he had
[33:17] now. And they shall keep the way of the
[33:20] Lord to do justice and judgment that the
[33:22] Lord may bring upon Abraham that which
[33:25] he has spoken of him. So the reason
[33:28] God's going to reveal more to Abraham is
[33:30] because God knows Abraham is going to
[33:32] keep the way of the Lord and make sure
[33:34] it's done at his house. Hallelujah.
[33:38] That's why don't let sin in your house
[33:39] like Achen. Don't bring the sin into
[33:41] your house. Achen learned the hard way,
[33:44] right? We got to keep all the sin out of
[33:46] our houses. Praise God. And we got to
[33:49] keep the way of the Lord. Oh, there's so
[33:51] much joy in serving the Lord. So,
[33:53] Brother Austin saying, I'm sorry, I was
[33:56] singing Omema. Dance around the house
[33:57] today, brother. See, what am I doing?
[33:59] I'm keeping the way of the
[34:01] Lord. I'm not dancing to the devil. I'm
[34:04] dancing for Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen.
[34:08] praying to asking God, reading the word,
[34:11] listening to sermons. You keep the way
[34:13] of the Lord in your home, and God will
[34:15] show us what's to come that we haven't
[34:17] seen yet. Hallelujah. That's right,
[34:19] church.
[34:21] Nice. Verse 20. And the Lord said, be uh
[34:25] because the cry of Sodom and Gomorra is
[34:26] great, and because their sin is very
[34:28] grievous, I'll go down and see whether
[34:29] they have done allto together according
[34:32] to the cry of it which has come unto me,
[34:33] and if not, I will know. And the men
[34:36] turned their faces from tents and went
[34:38] towards Sodom. But Abraham stood yet
[34:39] before the Lord. Now notice this church,
[34:42] the angels going down, God counted that
[34:45] as him going down. But God's presence
[34:47] did not go down. That's because the
[34:49] Bible says the angels are angels of his
[34:51] presence. Angels carry the presence of
[34:54] the Holy Spirit. That's what Psalm says.
[34:56] They're angels of his presence. So God
[34:58] said, "I'm going to go down and hear the
[35:00] cries." Now look, we got another thought
[35:01] in there. God hears all your groanings
[35:03] and your cries.
[35:06] What cries were going down there? The
[35:07] people that dislike Lot. The people that
[35:10] were vexed. Glory. The people that were
[35:12] vexed by the sinfulness of
[35:15] Sodom. God heard their prayers. All
[35:18] right. So, it must have been Lot and his
[35:21] daughters right there. Who else? Who
[35:23] else was vexed down there? Everybody,
[35:26] God said, "I will not judge the
[35:28] righteous with the wicked." Oh, I I've
[35:30] never seen that before. That's just
[35:31] fresh. That's fresh. Thank you, Lord,
[35:32] for some fresh mana today. That was Lot.
[35:36] That was Lot's prayers. That was the cry
[35:38] of the city. And how about the ones that
[35:40] were abused, too? Maybe that they they
[35:42] died. The abused ones that died. What
[35:44] about the people that might have moved
[35:45] out of the city that were crying and
[35:46] vexed? Because the Bible said Lot was
[35:48] vexed every day by what he saw and
[35:51] heard. That's why, church, if you're
[35:52] vexed by your phone, by what you see or
[35:54] hear or a tablet or whatever it is or
[35:55] movies, you got to get it out of your
[35:57] life,
[35:59] right? He was vexed every day by what he
[36:02] saw and what he heard. But Abraham
[36:04] wasn't because he lived a clean life. Is
[36:07] that right? Ain't that beautiful?
[36:09] Hallelujah.
[36:11] And God said, "I'm going down because I
[36:13] hear people crying unto me. They're
[36:14] vexed." Wow. I just I just never seen
[36:16] that before. Wow. Lot was crying because
[36:20] he was vexed by this God. Now, church,
[36:22] did he have a choice to get out? Yes, he
[36:23] could have got out. But that's why he's
[36:25] foolish. He's the foolish. He's a type
[36:27] of the foolish virgin. Abraham's a type
[36:29] of the wise virgin. Everybody see that?
[36:32] You have two people that are saved.
[36:34] One's really obeying. One keeps all of
[36:37] his family with the word of God. Obeys,
[36:39] everybody in the house obeys. Lot
[36:41] remember, he lost some he lost some
[36:42] family members, even his
[36:44] wife, because he wasn't keeping the word
[36:47] like Abraham was.
[36:50] Hallelujah. And church, remember that
[36:52] God hears our cries. When we're vexed or
[36:54] we're struggling, cry out to God. God
[36:57] hears us. And then, church, he'll do
[36:59] something about it. But he wants to hear
[37:01] you cry first. Right? That's what it
[37:03] says right there. The cries. I've heard
[37:05] the cry of
[37:08] it. Now, before we read 23, go down to
[37:11] verse 33. Malachi, I want you read that
[37:14] for us, buddy. You got
[37:21] it. Now, that's what blessed me. I I I
[37:25] realized that's right. The word
[37:26] communion is used here.
[37:29] So all this going on is communion. The
[37:33] eating, think about that, eating some
[37:35] calf meat, brother. Man, that must have
[37:37] been some good calf meat. Totally
[37:39] organic, brother, before all the sprays.
[37:41] Can you imagine how good that must have
[37:43] been? But Abraham Eden there with God
[37:46] and the angels and Sarah communing and
[37:49] then Lord, can I worship you? Can I wash
[37:52] your feet, Lord? Oh God, can I work? I
[37:54] love I love you, God. Could I wash your
[37:56] feet? Thank you for coming my way. I've
[37:58] been sitting in the tent door. I've been
[37:59] waiting for you. I knew you were coming.
[38:02] Amen. We know he's coming for us.
[38:03] Hallelujah. Thank God. Amen. And all
[38:07] these talks, he's like, "I'm going to
[38:08] visit you." They're talking back and
[38:10] forth. I'm going to visit you according
[38:12] time of life. And oh, praise God. Uh
[38:14] Sarah's going to have a Sarah Sarah's
[38:16] going to have a child. Hallelujah. She
[38:18] said, "No, I'm not." And yet yes, you
[38:20] did. You did laugh. You know, all all
[38:23] this uh I'm not going to hide this from
[38:25] you, Abraham. Here's what I'm going to
[38:27] do here. I'm going to judge sin. All
[38:29] this is communion,
[38:31] church. Think about that. All the
[38:33] sermons we hear, what is it? It's
[38:34] communion with God. I'm talking about
[38:35] the part that's inspired, not the human
[38:38] part that fails. When brother Jesse
[38:40] stutters or says the wrong scripture or
[38:42] says my own opinion, that that's not
[38:44] communion. But when it's God's word and
[38:46] speaking your heart, that's communion
[38:49] because it'll bring us to a unity of the
[38:51] faith. Ephesians 4 says, so that blessed
[38:54] me so much. That's why that was a fresh
[38:56] thought. I wanted to preach it last week
[38:58] or two weeks ago, but I didn't get to
[39:00] it. Now, this is all communion. Now, we
[39:03] can see Genesis 18 is the communion
[39:06] chapter. So, you sit and wait for God.
[39:09] You bow down to God. You wash God's
[39:12] feet. You have a meal with God. You talk
[39:15] about what God's going to do in the
[39:16] future, future judgments, and also also
[39:18] future blessings. Talk about the future
[39:21] promises that are coming to pass. Sound
[39:23] like a really good church service,
[39:24] doesn't it?
[39:26] Sounds like a real good service. Amen.
[39:28] And church, we're not even done. The
[39:30] last part of communion is
[39:33] prayer. Interceding for the foolish
[39:37] virgin. Hallelujah. In other words,
[39:39] people like Brother Rod knows, Rod's a
[39:41] dedicated Christian, people that aren't
[39:43] as dedicated as Brother Rod and and us,
[39:46] right? You can I it's all over Rod's
[39:48] life. I' I've been privileged to spend
[39:50] 11 hours in the car with one trip with
[39:52] him.
[39:54] Hallelujah. And it's all Jesus. It's all
[39:58] about Jesus and history and how God has
[40:00] been gracious to all the people all down
[40:02] through history. It's a consecrated
[40:04] life. Hallelujah. It's a dedicated life.
[40:08] But we all know people that don't go
[40:10] that far. They waste so much time. And
[40:13] I'll say like this. We all know people
[40:14] that are vexed by their sinful
[40:16] addictions.
[40:18] So I don't we don't know all the sins
[40:20] Lot was committing but he was actually
[40:22] putting himself and his family in a very
[40:24] bad
[40:25] position. He was even crying out about
[40:27] it but he still could have left but he
[40:30] didn't probably because of the financial
[40:32] situation right because remember he
[40:33] first he looked towards Sodom then he
[40:35] saw all the wells of Sodom. It's like oh
[40:37] my it's like Garden of Eden there.
[40:38] Remember he just kept getting closer by
[40:39] the
[40:40] scripture. See that? But we all know
[40:43] people that don't live as dedicated to
[40:45] Jesus as we do. So whose job is it to
[40:48] pray? It's our
[40:50] job. And that is communion with
[40:54] God.
[40:57] Hallelujah. Look at verse and notice now
[41:00] he's standing yet before the Lord. Look
[41:02] at verse 23. Here's another good type of
[41:04] communion. And Abraham drew near and
[41:06] said, "Wilt thou also destroy the
[41:08] righteous with the wicked?" So see,
[41:12] that's how we that's how we get near to
[41:13] God. We pray. We start talking to God.
[41:16] Lord, what what are the plans for what
[41:18] what's going to happen in 220 2025?
[41:21] Lord, is there going to be a 2030? See,
[41:24] you should talk. We should talk to God
[41:25] like that, right? Lord, like Lord, I'm
[41:28] drawing near. I want to know if I'm
[41:31] going to live to see the body change or
[41:32] not. Remember, I've said that before. I
[41:34] that that's that's me drawing near to
[41:36] God and saying, "God, I want to know."
[41:39] Now, he hasn't revealed to me yet, but
[41:40] if he does, I'll let you know
[41:43] first. That'd be really striking.
[41:47] Hallelujah. But this is this is
[41:50] communion. Lord, we've had I've bowed
[41:52] down. I've worshiped you. I made you a
[41:55] meal. You've given me promises. This is
[41:57] awesome. This is so wonderful. But now
[41:59] I'm going to draw near. And I want you
[42:01] to hear my prayer for the
[42:05] righteous that are they're they're
[42:07] trapped in their sins out there, right?
[42:09] They're they're they're far away from
[42:10] us, but they're trapped in in a bad
[42:12] place. And God, please remember God just
[42:15] told him I'm going to destroy Sodom. So
[42:16] he's like, but now his heart's moved.
[42:18] Oh, I I I have family in Sodom, church.
[42:20] I have family. We have family in
[42:21] denominations that are are I'm talking
[42:23] about bad
[42:24] denominations,
[42:27] right? Yeah. Hallelujah. I have family,
[42:31] you know, uh in denominations that that
[42:34] they've broken the word of God. And
[42:36] brother Ram said, "Thus said the Lord,
[42:37] and denominations will never come back
[42:40] to this Bible, all the full revelation."
[42:42] And no denomination ever has a man said,
[42:45] "Thus say the Lord," they'll never break
[42:46] up their creeds and come back to the
[42:48] apostolic faith. Thus sayeth the Lord,
[42:51] and it's never happened, and it never
[42:53] will, right? Because denominations are
[42:56] set up by men, right? We're not to be a
[42:59] organization. We're to be an organism.
[43:02] Hallelujah. That's right, church. Amen.
[43:05] But now, what's the final part of
[43:07] communion? Is prayer. He said, "Lord,
[43:10] please don't destroy the foolish virgin.
[43:14] Please don't destroy those that are
[43:16] living amongst things that vex them
[43:19] every single day. They're tormented by
[43:21] the sinful things they see and hear
[43:24] every day." This also tells us we should
[43:26] be living a life free from a lot of
[43:27] these
[43:29] things. This means Abraham was living a
[43:31] life free from things that he saw and
[43:34] heard that vex his heart, right? He
[43:37] wasn't living there. He was far away
[43:40] from
[43:40] that.
[43:44] Hallelujah. Per venture. Verse 24, there
[43:47] be 50 righteous within the city. Thou
[43:49] would also destroy and not spare the
[43:51] place for the 50 righteous that are
[43:52] therein. That be far from thee to do
[43:55] after this manner to slay the righteous
[43:57] with the wicked, and that the righteous
[43:59] should be as the wicked. That be far
[44:00] from thee. Shall not the judge of all
[44:03] the earth do right? I love this. Abraham
[44:05] saying, God, isn't this your character?
[44:07] God, isn't this how you act? What is he
[44:09] doing? He's repeating God's promises
[44:11] back to him. Hallelujah. You can do the
[44:14] same thing. When you feel alone, you can
[44:15] say, "God, you said you'd never leave me
[44:18] nor forsake me." Hallelujah. It's your
[44:20] promise.
[44:22] He's quoting the promise back to God.
[44:25] That's what a high that's what uh that's
[44:26] what confession means. Brother Bam says
[44:28] the word means it. Confess means to say
[44:31] the same
[44:32] thing,
[44:34] right? So that's what Abraham's doing.
[44:36] He's confessing what God has already
[44:38] said and he's interceding for those who
[44:42] aren't living as true to God as he
[44:47] is. That's right. And I love this. Shall
[44:51] not Won't the God of all the earth do
[44:52] right? Of course. Of course he knows
[44:55] what the answer is going to be. Yeah.
[44:57] God Yeah. God said, "I'm going to do
[44:58] what's
[44:59] right. I'm not going to destroy the
[45:02] righteous with the wicked." Hallelujah.
[45:05] And see, that means church, all the
[45:06] foolish virgin in the tribulation while
[45:08] we're gone, the rapture, they're going
[45:09] to die some way, but they're not going
[45:11] to die through the way of God's wrath
[45:13] with the trumpets and the vows and the
[45:15] woes, they won't die based upon God's
[45:18] wrath. They'll die some other
[45:21] way. Probably through the mark of the
[45:23] beast. If they don't buy or sell,
[45:25] they'll be killed, right? Probably
[45:26] hunted down or something like that.
[45:30] But you know, if they know the
[45:31] scripture, they can try to go hide in
[45:32] some cave because Zechariah 14 says that
[45:35] they that are they that are uh left over
[45:37] the remnant, they'll walk up walk out.
[45:40] I'm sorry. They'll walk out into the
[45:41] millennium. Not on the ashes, but
[45:43] they'll walk out there and they can live
[45:45] into the
[45:47] millennium. All right? So, we see that
[45:49] now church, you all know this. Uh he
[45:51] breaks it down from 50 all the way down
[45:54] to 10. Verse 32. And he said, "Oh, let
[45:57] not the Lord be angry, and I'll speak
[45:58] yet, but this once, per adventure, 10
[46:01] shall be found there." And he said, "I
[46:02] will not destroy it for 10 sake." And
[46:05] the Lord went his way as soon as he had
[46:07] left, communing with Abraham. And
[46:09] Abraham returned unto his place. So see
[46:13] church, we get something special
[46:15] here. Communion is praying with God and
[46:18] make look, he's making his request known
[46:21] unto God. That's what God wants you to
[46:23] do. That's what God wants me to do. Make
[46:26] our request. In other words, call those
[46:28] individual names, right? The names of
[46:30] the people in your family, call them out
[46:32] to God. Say, "God, be merciful to this
[46:34] one. God, be gracious to that
[46:36] one." Right? God, please don't let them
[46:40] be destroyed with the wicked. God have
[46:42] mercy on them. And it also gives us
[46:45] understanding too that when we pray,
[46:47] God's spirit comes closer to us than
[46:49] other times because look, what did the
[46:51] Bible say? Did God did God stay there?
[46:53] No. He went his
[46:55] way. Right? So, we know there's times
[46:58] God's spirit feels closer than others
[47:00] and yet God never forsakes
[47:02] us. But sometimes, brother Austin,
[47:04] right? He's closer. Sometimes I feel him
[47:06] a lot closer than other times. Right.
[47:09] What is that through?
[47:11] Prayer. Communion. Yes. Draw nigh to
[47:13] God. And then he promises, I'll draw
[47:15] nigh unto you. Hallelujah. It's a good
[47:17] verse, brother. Good verse. James,
[47:19] right? James chapter 4, if I'm not
[47:21] mistaken. Draw nigh to God. God will
[47:23] draw nigh to
[47:24] you. Hallelujah. Now, let me close up
[47:27] here. I've only been preaching about 40
[47:29] minutes. Wow. Hard to believe
[47:32] that.
[47:34] So, God and Abraham now have a second
[47:37] communion. This foreshadows communion.
[47:40] Hallelujah. Because we got the eating,
[47:42] we got the bowing down, we got the
[47:43] worship, we got the making known, we got
[47:46] the prayers, the intercession, we have
[47:47] all these things. Amazing uh example
[47:50] here of communion. And brother Bram says
[47:54] uh God's visit to Abraham and Sarah was
[47:57] the last sign they got before Isaac was
[48:00] born. And that's true. If you look at uh
[48:03] n last visit, yes, God's last visit
[48:06] because chapter 19 is the destruction of
[48:08] Sodom. God doesn't visit them there.
[48:10] Acts I'm sorry, Genesis chapter 20 is
[48:13] Abraham's lapse at
[48:15] Gerrar, right? When uh Abraham lied
[48:18] again about
[48:20] Sarah. Now, my wife shared this thought
[48:22] with me. I thought it was pretty
[48:23] striking. Abraham's lie there the second
[48:26] time was way worse than the first time
[48:29] because the second time around, Abraham
[48:33] already visited by God and said, "It's
[48:35] going to come through Sarah." He didn't
[48:36] know that
[48:38] before. God just visit him and said,
[48:41] "I'm going to be with you." Like, I'm
[48:43] going to visit you and she's going to
[48:45] have a child. And yet he still gives her
[48:47] over to Aimilec because of fear. Church,
[48:51] fear is an awful thing. We got to rebuke
[48:54] it in Jesus name. We got to stand upon
[48:57] God's word. Hallelujah. But think about
[49:00] that. It was this was way worse the
[49:03] second time around. He's already been
[49:05] through this. But what does it show
[49:07] again? It again shows that God is
[49:09] merciful to our what? Our
[49:12] iniquities. Second time I've struggled
[49:14] with this. Now for some of us it might
[49:15] be this is the third time this is the
[49:17] fourth time now I don't know how many
[49:19] times but God will forgive all our
[49:23] iniquities even after he had thus sayith
[49:25] the Lord God visited him and said it's
[49:27] coming through Sarah I'm going to visit
[49:29] you next year and still he gives his
[49:31] wife up to another
[49:34] man oh God have
[49:37] mercy and we learn of course the
[49:40] previous chapter though prayer is
[49:41] communion okay so
[49:43] God.
[49:45] Uh, so God's last sign was God coming to
[49:50] Abraham and Sarah in the tent, right?
[49:52] That was the last sign. Now, look what
[49:54] brother Ram says. Brother Ram says this
[49:55] six
[49:58] times. Uh, but I have three here for
[50:00] you. Brother Ram said in 1961,
[50:02] "Remember, let me tell you, thus sayith
[50:03] the Lord God that's on me. This is the
[50:04] last sign to the Gentile church before
[50:06] the
[50:08] rapture." That's quite a
[50:10] statement. Remember, thus sayith the
[50:12] Holy Spirit. This is your last sign.
[50:13] Write it in your Bible. And if something
[50:15] rises besides this, greater than this,
[50:17] call me a false prophet. Brother Ram was
[50:19] talking about, Brother Rod, the prayer
[50:20] lines where he would tell people, I
[50:22] think I showed you one time, 15 secrets
[50:24] God told one woman. And brother Ram did
[50:27] this night after night after night after
[50:29] night. And brother Bam said, "Thus
[50:31] sayeth the Lord, if a sign comes greater
[50:34] than this, I'm a false prophet." Now,
[50:35] here we are 60 almost 60 years after
[50:38] Brother Bram. Has anyone ever risen
[50:40] that's greater than brother Brandham's
[50:41] gift? None. That's because he had thus
[50:44] sayith the Lord. That's because he was
[50:45] God's true
[50:46] prophet. I think I I don't know. I don't
[50:48] know if I had that on this slide or not.
[50:51] I don't think I
[50:53] do, but I had the I think I showed the
[50:55] 15 the last
[50:58] time. Okay. So uh and then the this
[51:02] third one he said just remember thus
[51:03] sayith the Lord you'll never and no more
[51:05] gentile church age ever see any sign to
[51:08] succeed this go greater this is the last
[51:10] sign to the church now this is powerful
[51:12] because he says
[51:14] gentile because that means the Jews the
[51:17] Jews are not included in this Jews will
[51:20] have greater signs than brother
[51:21] Brandham's we we might say right because
[51:24] the Jews uh they'll turn water to blood
[51:27] and they'll cause it not to rain for
[51:29] three and a half years. Brother Ram
[51:30] never did that. He spoke to storms and
[51:33] he uh prayed for the dead. They come
[51:34] back and did different things. But
[51:36] brother Ram says, notice he said this
[51:38] sign is to the church, not to the Jews.
[51:42] So see how see how see how careful see
[51:45] how detailed the Holy Spirit was not to
[51:48] let him say the wrong thing. Brother
[51:51] Ram's ministry was the last sign to the
[51:53] Gentiles, not the Jews. The Jews get
[51:56] greater signs. They get all those signs
[51:58] through the sixth seal and of course the
[52:00] two
[52:01] prophets. All right. Can everybody see
[52:03] that? By God's
[52:04] grace. Now, brother Ram says this
[52:07] because
[52:09] uh because God was standing there and
[52:11] Sarah was behind him in the tent and God
[52:14] discerned. In other words, God judged
[52:15] and knew Sarah's behavior even though
[52:17] she was behind him in the
[52:19] tent. In other words, God knew the
[52:21] secrets of Sarah's heart even though
[52:23] Sarah wasn't right in front of him. And
[52:25] that's what brother Ram had. Brother Ram
[52:27] had the gift to know the thoughts and
[52:28] intents of the heart. And brother Rod, I
[52:31] need to share. I need to find it with
[52:32] you and I need to post it online. But
[52:34] there's a sermon where brother Ram's
[52:36] preaching on act Genesis 18 and he says
[52:39] something along this lines and he said,
[52:41] "Let me prove to you that the same God
[52:43] that had his back turned to Sarah is the
[52:46] same God that's in sentent me." Brother
[52:48] man turns his back to the audience,
[52:50] Brother Rod, and he goes right down the
[52:52] row, the first row, and he discerns
[52:54] everybody's secrets in the f first
[52:56] entire
[52:58] row. Hallelujah. Ah, we don't have We're
[53:01] not playing some fairy tale. We've got
[53:03] thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah.
[53:08] Hallelujah. Praise God. I need to find
[53:10] that. Uh I think it was in 1964 if I'm
[53:13] not
[53:14] mistaken. Tremendous gift. That's why
[53:17] the Holy Spirit said this is the last
[53:20] sign, the greatest sign the Gentiles,
[53:22] Gentiles will see before the rapture of
[53:24] the church.
[53:26] Hallelujah. Amazing. Amazing
[53:30] grace. All right.
[53:34] Now, let me close just with those last
[53:36] few things here.
[53:43] Uh, I never got to preach because my
[53:45] wife had the baby. I never got to preach
[53:47] on the new pope situation. Now, 71 years
[53:50] ago, Brother Random said a pope was
[53:53] coming out of the United
[53:55] States. Now, I've made I put a video
[53:58] about out this uh out today about this
[54:01] on
[54:02] YouTube. Somehow, Brother Random had
[54:04] some knowledge from God. He doesn't tell
[54:06] us the specific
[54:08] prophecy, but he said according to
[54:10] prophecy, he said there's going to be a
[54:13] new pope brought out of the United
[54:14] States and put over there according to
[54:17] prophecy. Then they'll form an image
[54:19] liken of the
[54:20] beast. This was December 19th, 1954. And
[54:25] church, I've gone online. I think I
[54:27] found uh almost 10 quotes where people
[54:30] said they never thought there'd be an
[54:31] American pope. Yeah.
[54:35] Uh I I I watched you I mean I watched
[54:37] numerous videos about the new pope right
[54:38] you probably did too and a lot of these
[54:41] women and these reporters were saying oh
[54:42] this is such an amazing thing we never
[54:44] thought would one would ever come out of
[54:46] America uh because of her position
[54:49] because the church doesn't want you know
[54:50] America influencing the church because
[54:52] the church wants to say based upon its
[54:54] traditions. Well sure it does because
[54:56] it's got traditions of devils but
[54:58] America's just as
[55:01] bad. But they they were all saying they
[55:04] never thought there'd be an American
[55:05] pope. But who knew there'd be an
[55:07] American pope 71 years ago, God's
[55:11] prophet. Now, personally though, now
[55:14] this is what I put in the video, too.
[55:15] Personally, I don't think this was a
[55:16] specific prophecy. I think it was just a
[55:18] general prophecy brother saw in the
[55:22] scripture because look, there's no thus
[55:24] sayeth the
[55:25] Lord.
[55:27] Okay? Now the reason I believe that is
[55:29] because uh seven months later in May of
[55:32] 1954 for the first time brother Random
[55:35] preached United States is in revelation
[55:37] chapter
[55:38] 13. Okay it's 13
[55:41] 11-18. I'm going to go there briefly.
[55:44] Revelation
[55:50] 1311. Now the beast comes up in 11 out
[55:52] of the land. Notice it's not the sea.
[55:54] It's not the multitudes of people like
[55:56] the beast came out of Rome, right? all
[55:58] those multitudes of people, the kingdom
[55:59] of Rome, right? So, brother Ram says it
[56:02] comes out of the earth. That was North
[56:04] America where there wasn't a lot of
[56:06] people. He had two horns like a lamb.
[56:08] Brother Ram said lamb represents this
[56:10] innocent religion. And the two horns he
[56:13] says are ci civil power. So, government
[56:15] powers and ecclesiastical powers. So,
[56:18] government and church
[56:21] powers. And he spake like a dragon. In
[56:23] other words, he's going to start
[56:25] speaking like he's the boss of the
[56:26] world, like Rome
[56:27] was, right? And how many times has Trump
[56:30] declared, "We're the greatest nation on
[56:31] the earth." Many times. I know in 2017,
[56:35] I put in my book, in 2017, he went to
[56:37] United Nations nations said, "We're the
[56:38] greatest nation. We're the most powerful
[56:40] and we're going to be the most powerful
[56:41] ever." He boasts like a
[56:44] dragon. That's
[56:46] right. And he exercises all the power of
[56:49] the first beast before
[56:51] him. Okay. Okay. Now, he does great
[56:53] wonders to make fire come down from
[56:54] heaven. That was the two bombs in Japan,
[56:57] 1945. He makes fire come down from
[57:00] heaven, right? And no one's able to make
[57:03] war with him. Who's made war with the
[57:05] United States? Come and make war on
[57:07] us,
[57:10] right? And so, the Bible said he had
[57:13] power in verse 15 to give life under the
[57:16] image of the beast. So, this is what I
[57:17] believe. that to the best of my
[57:19] understanding. I can't prove it
[57:21] necessarily with a quote, but it looks
[57:22] like brother Ram's just giving a general
[57:24] prophecy. When the United Confederation
[57:26] of Church goes together, the new pope is
[57:28] brought on the United States and put
[57:30] over there according to prophecy. So, I
[57:32] believe what he's talking about is
[57:33] Revelation 13 verse 15. That's what I
[57:38] believe then. Okay, so once the pope's
[57:41] there, then they'll have to form an
[57:43] image like in the beast. And I tell you,
[57:45] the true church of God will be drove
[57:47] together, right? Because we're going to
[57:49] start hearing we're start hearing of all
[57:50] the churches. You got to unite with the
[57:52] government. It's it's all going to be a
[57:53] good thing. And we're going to start
[57:55] hearing about the mark of the beast. But
[57:58] this is going to drive the true church
[57:59] together away from the papal Rome.
[58:03] Hallelujah. And all the uniting of the
[58:04] Protestants, which they're not real
[58:05] Protestants if they're uniting with the
[58:07] pope. They are not protesting the pope.
[58:10] Amen. We're protesting the pope.
[58:12] Hallelujah.
[58:14] Right? The real true believers out of
[58:17] Methodists, Baptist, Presbyterian, I
[58:19] came out of the Pentecostal church,
[58:21] Nazarene, pilgrim, holiness, whatever
[58:23] they'll be. See, whatever he said, no
[58:25] matter what church it is, they will go
[58:27] together and cemented by the love of
[58:29] God. Amen. And what is God? God is the
[58:32] word. Hallelujah.
[58:34] See, we're going to love the
[58:36] word. And that'll make the body of the
[58:39] Jesus, the Lord Jesus Christ, all the
[58:41] believers. I think I left an S off
[58:43] there. I accidentally deleted that. Now,
[58:45] see, church, you got to be very careful
[58:46] how we interpret this because of this.
[58:48] We don't know if this current pope we
[58:50] have will be the antichrist or not. We
[58:53] don't
[58:54] know because we don't have a thus sayith
[58:56] the Lord on
[58:58] this. It seems like brother just looked
[59:00] at, well, if Revelation 13 is US verses
[59:04] 11 to 18, and they're going to lay down
[59:05] the mark, well, then the pope's going to
[59:07] have to be up from America then. That's
[59:09] what it looks like to me.
[59:11] Because we don't have a thus sayith the
[59:13] Lord. And look, church, did he give any
[59:14] scripture for us to use? No, we have no
[59:16] scripture pro. What pro what prophecy?
[59:18] We don't
[59:20] know. Now, some message people are
[59:22] making this a thus sayith the Lord
[59:23] prophecy. But church, it's not a thus
[59:25] sayith the Lord
[59:26] prophecy. It's a general prophecy from
[59:30] Revelation 13. Does everybody understand
[59:32] what I'm saying here? Because what if
[59:34] this pope dies? What if this pope dies
[59:35] in 15, 10 years and they get a now pope
[59:38] from Africa, right? They're going to
[59:40] say, "You bunch of liars. You've I'm not
[59:43] going to lie. I'm not saying this. I'm
[59:45] not saying this is a specific prophecy.
[59:47] It's a general
[59:48] prophecy because I don't know if this
[59:50] pope is going to bring uh raise up that
[59:53] image to the beast. I don't know if this
[59:54] is the pope that's going to do it. I
[59:55] don't
[59:56] know. And neither do you. And neither do
[59:59] any of us." And the church said, "None
[1:00:01] of us know the future unless God chose
[1:00:03] us."
[1:00:05] So let's let's not let's not bring
[1:00:07] reproach upon the name of Jesus and make
[1:00:09] something a prophecy when it's really
[1:00:11] not a specific prophecy. It's a general
[1:00:14] this is just he didn't even tell us the
[1:00:16] we don't even know the Bible verse. I'm
[1:00:17] just giving my best
[1:00:19] guess. Now what is this similar to? And
[1:00:21] Simon mentioned it. Remember Simon is
[1:00:23] like I heard him preach. He said I like
[1:00:25] brother Jesse's video on Camala Harris.
[1:00:27] Let's go over that real quickly
[1:00:29] here because church we got to be good
[1:00:31] with thus say the Lord. If we're not
[1:00:32] good with thus sayith the Lord, we're
[1:00:33] going to we're going to make something
[1:00:34] thus sayith the Lord that's not and then
[1:00:37] we look like fools when it doesn't come
[1:00:39] to
[1:00:40] pass. Like here's what brother said in
[1:00:42] 1933. Brother Rod, look what he said. He
[1:00:45] saw seven visions. In the six I s I saw
[1:00:47] the rose of an America, most beautiful
[1:00:48] but cruel woman. She held the people in
[1:00:51] her complete power. I believe that this
[1:00:54] was the rise of the Roman Catholic
[1:00:55] Church, though I knew it could possibly
[1:00:56] be a vision of some woman rising great
[1:00:58] power in America to a popular vote by
[1:01:00] women. And so when Camala Harris became
[1:01:03] vice president, a lot of people said,
[1:01:05] "Oh, this one's fulfilled." But I never
[1:01:07] did because I never saw her get complete
[1:01:11] power. When did Camala Harris have
[1:01:14] complete power over you, brother? Never.
[1:01:18] I never bowed to because other ways he
[1:01:20] tells us, he said, "The whole nation
[1:01:22] bowed to this woman. I never bowed to
[1:01:24] Camala Harris. I never voted for her."
[1:01:27] Hallelujah.
[1:01:29] I wasn't under her complete power. If
[1:01:31] the vision says complete power, it's
[1:01:33] going to be complete power. Praise God.
[1:01:35] If all the other visions and thus say
[1:01:37] the Lord as we preach with, we have thus
[1:01:38] sayith the Lord. Two sermons when
[1:01:39] brother Rod was here. I went through
[1:01:41] like what 20 of them. If all those came
[1:01:43] to pass, all the rest will come to pass.
[1:01:45] Praise God. Amen. Because God doesn't
[1:01:48] lie. Hallelujah.
[1:01:50] Amen. Now, this is thus sayith the Lord.
[1:01:54] But if she doesn't, if Camala didn't
[1:01:55] have complete power, then Camala didn't
[1:01:58] fulfill the
[1:01:59] vision. And that's what I said when she
[1:02:01] first got
[1:02:04] elected. And now look, And now what do
[1:02:06] people look like that say Camala
[1:02:08] fulfilled
[1:02:10] that? They look
[1:02:13] silly. They just look immature. They
[1:02:15] look like they don't know how to rightly
[1:02:16] divide the word of God.
[1:02:22] Now, why didn't Now, why didn't they see
[1:02:24] this quote from Brother
[1:02:27] Brandham? See, some people just want to
[1:02:29] use some quotes. And I'm not saying I
[1:02:31] use every quote from Brother Brandon,
[1:02:32] but I want to acknowledge all the quotes
[1:02:35] of Brother Brandham. Like, if there's a
[1:02:36] if there's a question and brother
[1:02:38] Brandham has ideas about this side of a
[1:02:39] topic and that side, I want to at least
[1:02:41] acknowledge both of them and I'll give
[1:02:44] you my opinion about which one I think
[1:02:45] it might be right if we don't have with
[1:02:47] us, sayith the Lord. Well, look what he
[1:02:50] says. How that doing so, they'd permit
[1:02:52] women to vote, which they did. Women
[1:02:54] suffrage. And doing so, they would elect
[1:02:56] the wrong president. Right? All those
[1:02:57] women voted for the handsome JFK. They
[1:02:59] voted for they voted for the wrong guy,
[1:03:02] right? He's a womanizer. He's a very
[1:03:03] very filthy
[1:03:05] man,
[1:03:07] right? And and and this would be a woman
[1:03:10] sent up that would govern the United
[1:03:12] States. Not actually a woman.
[1:03:16] Not actually Camala Harris, although
[1:03:18] people think that it was Camala Harris,
[1:03:21] but a
[1:03:22] church. Is Camala Harris a church? No.
[1:03:26] She's a woman, but she's not a
[1:03:29] church. Then I see her with nothing but
[1:03:32] ashes. It's going to
[1:03:34] happen.
[1:03:36] Hallelujah. So, see friends, it goes
[1:03:38] back to this new Pope thing, right? We
[1:03:40] got to be very careful what we do with
[1:03:44] prophecy because if we're right, yeah,
[1:03:46] we look right. But if we're wrong, we
[1:03:48] look foolish and we bring reproach upon
[1:03:50] the gospel of Christ. Oh, you know what?
[1:03:52] I know the way that we're going to get
[1:03:53] it right. Have communion with Christ.
[1:03:56] Let's stand to our feet. How did Abraham
[1:03:59] get it right, church? He had communion
[1:04:00] with Christ. Musicians can come. Does
[1:04:03] everybody understand that? By God's
[1:04:05] grace, we got to have communion with
[1:04:07] Jesus Christ. And then we'll say the
[1:04:09] right thing. We'll do the right
[1:04:12] thing. Not just shooting from the hip. I
[1:04:14] think it's gonna be that. Well, I got a
[1:04:15] quote for this. Well, guess what?
[1:04:16] There's always quotes on the other side,
[1:04:18] too. Have you looked at all the quotes?
[1:04:21] Have you looked at all the prophecies in
[1:04:23] the
[1:04:24] Bible? See, it's a shame when people
[1:04:26] don't do that. But God help us. God will
[1:04:31] help us, church, because I'm told by
[1:04:32] Jesus Christ that if I've got the Holy
[1:04:34] Ghost, I will be guided into all truth.
[1:04:36] And I believe that. How many believe
[1:04:39] that? Do we really think Do we really
[1:04:41] think that promise is going to fail? I
[1:04:43] don't. Do I think it's going to be my
[1:04:45] power, Genevie, that's going to bring
[1:04:46] that to pass? No. It's going to be the
[1:04:48] power. You're right. The power of
[1:04:50] Christ.
[1:04:52] Hallelujah. See, God's watching over his
[1:04:55] word. And God's going to help us watch
[1:04:56] over his word as well. Let's bow our
[1:04:59] heads. How many want to have communion
[1:05:00] with Christ? More. More communion with
[1:05:02] Christ. Praise God. I surely do. And I
[1:05:04] love to see that chapter. What a
[1:05:05] beautiful chapter on communion. Genesis
[1:05:08] 18. Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[1:05:11] tonight. Lord, thank you for your truth
[1:05:12] in your word. God, keep us balanced,
[1:05:14] Lord. Keep us humble, Lord. Keep us
[1:05:16] stable, Lord
[1:05:18] God. Help us to live what we actually
[1:05:21] preach and believe. So many don't, Lord
[1:05:24] God. So many will say, "Well, we got to
[1:05:27] have a scripture for everything." And
[1:05:28] and then when they don't have a
[1:05:29] scripture, they'll still make some claim
[1:05:30] that proves wrong, like the Camala
[1:05:33] Harris thing. Dear God, Lord have mercy,
[1:05:35] God.
[1:05:38] Help us to live and apply what we
[1:05:42] preach, what we say we believe.
[1:05:44] Hallelujah. Let us be doers of the word,
[1:05:48] not just hearers of the
[1:05:50] word. So Lord, we look at prophecy. If
[1:05:53] there's no thus sayith the Lord, well
[1:05:54] then we are not going to make it to thus
[1:05:56] sayith the Lord. Help us not to do that,
[1:05:58] dear God.
[1:06:00] Help us to do what we know is right,
[1:06:02] dear God. Because that proves we've had
[1:06:05] communion with the Almighty God. Oh God,
[1:06:08] draw near to us like you did to Abraham.
[1:06:10] Lord, and we even saw that Abraham can
[1:06:12] draw nigh to you, Lord God. Help us to
[1:06:14] draw nigh to you in our homes. Lord God,
[1:06:17] help us not to vex ourselves with what
[1:06:20] looking at the wrong thing, listening to
[1:06:22] the wrong thing. Oh God, help us not to
[1:06:24] vex the Holy Spirit.
[1:06:26] We know if we do though there's mercy,
[1:06:29] there's forgiveness. Lord God, help us
[1:06:32] Lord to have testimonies like David
[1:06:34] where you say, "The Lord rewarded me
[1:06:36] according to my righteousness because my
[1:06:38] hands were clean."
[1:06:40] Hallelujah. Because I did not give into
[1:06:42] my iniquity, I overcame my iniquity,
[1:06:45] Lord
[1:06:47] God. With the pure God, you will show
[1:06:50] yourself pure. Help us to be pure
[1:06:52] tonight, Lord Jesus. Oh God, let us be
[1:06:54] pure in thy sight, Lord
[1:06:56] God. Hallelujah, Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[1:06:59] God, for your blessings. Thank you for
[1:07:01] your word tonight. Thank you for the
[1:07:03] songs of Zion. Thank you for the prayers
[1:07:04] of the saints, Lord God. The prayer of
[1:07:06] faith shall save the sick, Lord God. We
[1:07:08] thank you, God, for these promises.
[1:07:10] They're yay and amen. Help us to listen
[1:07:13] when it's coming directly to us. Help us
[1:07:15] to listen also when it might seem like
[1:07:16] it's coming from behind us. Help us just
[1:07:19] always to listen. When the Savior calls,
[1:07:23] I'll
[1:07:24] answer. Oh God, help us to listen,
[1:07:27] Jesus. Lord, we're so thankful for this
[1:07:30] end time thus sayith the Lord message
[1:07:32] you given to us, pointing us back to the
[1:07:34] Bible. Help us to live it closer, Lord
[1:07:36] God, and bless our communion where we
[1:07:38] can get on our knees, Lord God, and
[1:07:41] worship and wash your feet, Lord God. We
[1:07:43] can have a meal with you spiritually,
[1:07:45] we'd say. And then we can plead for the
[1:07:48] souls of those Christians who don't live
[1:07:52] as high with a high calling as Paul said
[1:07:56] as we do. Lord God, not to exalt
[1:07:58] ourselves, God. I'm not exalting myself.
[1:08:00] I'm nothing. I'm a sinner saved by
[1:08:02] grace. But I can recognize that Lord,
[1:08:04] with all these standards, we have
[1:08:06] holiness. A woman that cuts her hair is
[1:08:08] not close to God is a woman who lets it
[1:08:10] grow.
[1:08:12] A man who's married twice preaching is
[1:08:14] not as close to God as a man who's
[1:08:16] married once and preaches. For the Bible
[1:08:19] said, "Let the bishop be the husband of
[1:08:21] one wife." Lord, so we can see how we're
[1:08:25] closer to God, not because we're better,
[1:08:27] but because you've given us grace, Lord
[1:08:30] God, to hear the word of God and to live
[1:08:32] it, Lord
[1:08:33] God. You've given us grace. So we thank
[1:08:37] you, Lord Jesus.
[1:08:40] Commune with us, Lord, here tonight,
[1:08:42] dear
[1:08:44] God. And Lord Jesus, may we intercede
[1:08:46] for others, Lord
[1:08:49] God. Hear our humble prayers. We ask it,
[1:08:51] Lord Jesus, tonight. Guide us by your
[1:08:53] holy spirit.
