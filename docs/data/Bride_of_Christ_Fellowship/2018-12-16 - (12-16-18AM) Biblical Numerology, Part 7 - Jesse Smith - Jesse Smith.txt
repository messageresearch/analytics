Lord tonight by God's grace let's go to Isaiah chapter 11 here just uh you know scripture like to read and then we'll have you be seen just a moment here let's take as a chapter 11 verse 1 and 2 I like to preach on biblical numerology again this is part 7 I'd like to return to that thought I've been trying to finish up the series that I've started so I can move on to some other ones there's some other ones I have a I'd like to really preach but I want to finish up some of these first by the grace of Lord but Isaiah chapter 11 verses 1 & 2 notice this is a six fold anointing on Christ a six fold anointing so this Holy Spirit on Jesus Christ would produce six attributes let's look at Isaiah 11 1 & 2 verse 1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots let's read verse 2 together one two three and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord of course we know this is speaking of Christ amen so the Holy Spirit anointing would have this six fold blessing upon his life how many can say praise the Lord let's bow our heads in word of prayer here Heavenly Father Lord we just come reverently Lord as we just say give us clean hands and pure hearts Lord God father we're seeking your face this morning Lord God and father we want to hear from you Lord we just ask that your Holy Spirit would speak through me Lord freely I wouldn't hinder it dear God and it would hear through each and every person Lord that we would not just be hearers of the word but we would be doers of the word help us Lord to hear and do today father God speak through Lord these lips of clay and Lord may your Holy Spirit manifests himself Lord God amongst us we just ask that you move amongst us freely Lord God you would accomplish your purpose for this service today and we ask it all in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen God best she was being seated praise God can you switch over there Lidia see if we got it on here okay that worked out pretty good also brother I wanted to thank brother Aaron you know he gave me this prayer cloth brother McCormack got it from Perry green and so I'm gonna take that to that boy today I don't know if you heard but one of the boys in my class has a tumor on his brainstem so we've been I was praying for him and I'm gonna preach with this on today cuz I know I know the same God that was on brother Branham is on me because I preached the same message I've only seen a little fraction of the same results but I've seen some of the same results so I know the same God that was on brother Branham is with me and just kind of has a refresher just to kind of look at the scripture you know the Bible said I wrote it on there so that hopefully the family can see it acts 19 11 and 12 and God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the disease is departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them amen so we know we know I even mentioned on Wednesday you know I wasn't even thinking about this but it's not it's not there's no virtue in the cloth but at what the cloth represents this cloth represents that a man of God was anointed of the Holy Ghost to do great signs miracles and wonders was anointed with thus saith the LORD preached in our generation manifested the Holy Ghost in our generation and now we have the same faith praise God we are believing in the same God that he preached the Lord Jesus Christ so let's look at these numbers here I like to look at just six seven and eight again you know I'm gonna try not to repeat myself too much and I'm gonna try to preach 45 minutes today I'm gonna try all right so let's look at this thought here and I want to actually want to look down and I want to go to this slide real quick I just thought of it from the first sermon and I preached on this thought I want to just show the quote from brother Branham about numbers why God uses numbers yeah he's known by his number so I wanted to read that three is the number of perfection we all know that three is God's number in his numerology God is known by his numbers so you know as I was talking to my wife last night you know as I've studied these thoughts you know sometimes it's it's more challenging to find numbers in your own life but today you know if you can't find specific numbers in your life take courage in the numbers that God has placed in the Bible and what it means to you so for example number six means the number of man it could mean fallen man but can also mean anointed man and so you may not be able to recognize a six maybe while I wasn't born I was in the sixth child or you know I wasn't I don't have six letters in my name or but don't necessarily get hung up on that so much focus on what it represents in other words I want to be anointed of the whole the spirit help me to get anything out of my life that's keeping me from being anointed of the Holy Spirit and so forth number seven is completion so Lord in other words if you can't find a seven well I'm not the seventh child or I'm not my name doesn't have seven letters in it like brother Branham or something like that don't so much focus on that but focus on God you have completed a work on the cross and take courage in what the seven means to your spiritual life if you if you can't find something specifically about you know your life with the number don't worry about that but take courage and what God's numbers represent what he's trying to get you to see today and the church said amen so remember let's just go over some of these meetings you know number one represents preeminence or unity that's what number one represents and that's what Christ the mystery of God revealed is all about there's one great mystery that God wants to have preeminence in your life in my life number two brother Branham says it means division it means difference testimony and it can also mean friendship or unity as well a unity of two so we know what the number two represents number three represents divine perfection or life the prophet of God says because Jesus rose on the third day and there's so much in nature that has threes involved in it there's three parts to this and three parts to that so we know it's God's perfection when God divinely designed something he often has three parts to it praise the Lord for of course is the number of deliverance that's the earth that's a number of other RAM says of double confirmation sometimes you have four witnesses to something brother grams let's see that's a double confirmation it's also an earthly number God does different things on the earth God does it for like there's four winds there's four directions you know the number four is related to earthly things five it means grace or favor if you see a five in your life it means labor and grace it also means Redemption God uses number five in Redemption number six we'll look at a little today we'll look at a little more six is the number of fallen man and fallen beasts it's also the number though of anointed man thank God and it's also used as a measure of time the number six is for time of course so is seven as well so Bob Arum says now one thing I got here are five things I like to speak up just a second just as quick as I can there's seven sevens there's five sevens and God's plan of redemption five is the number of grace now he knows that j esus fa ith five is the number of gray six is the man's day and seven is his day of redemption so six the sixth day if you just take one moment and remember the six day you know so often sixes looked on as a bad number but when God did the number of six in the beginning it was a great number it was the very height of his creation day six the beasts of the field but after that was man man who has made not an image of beasts but the image of God amen and so six is the man's day when God made man he made him an anointed man praise God he didn't have any sin he was perfect he was complete and so God 6 is always a good thing when it's anointed of his spirit now here's some more I found in the Old Testament there are 6 things under man's dominion according to Psalms 86 so in order for him to have dominion over 6 he's got to be anointed right and 6 represents the anointed man praise God the Bible said house made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands that was put all things under his feet Amen hallelujah now I'm thinking about Devils this morning I'm not thinking about sheep and oxen I'm thinking of how demons are under our feet amen but he says all sheep or oxen yea the beasts of the field follow the air the fish of the sea and then 6 whatsoever passes through the pass of the of the seas amen six fold Dominion that man has over the earth he said O Lord our God how excellent is thy name in all the earth remember Christ anointing would have a 6-volt blessing now to Church this looks like that Christ would have the full armor of God on because remember there's six pieces in the armor of God how remember that from the message we preach in it there's not seven there six there's six parts to the armor of God and so here Jesus Christ is said to come out of the stem of Jesse the branch of David we know and then the Bible said he'd have wisdom understanding counsel might knowledge and the fear of the Lord amen hallelujah praise God that's what that's what the Bible lists amen and you know God doesn't guess with numbers God doesn't play around with numbers when he lists numbers they have a meaning praise God this is how God would be known Jesus Christ would be known as a man anointed of the Holy Ghost and a power and he died and rose again that we might have the same anointing on us Dave a hallelujah that's exactly right did you know the anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost was to be on all flesh which means six-fold manner Oh the Bible said the Holy Ghost would fall on all flesh and then it says this should come to pass afterward I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and this is what all flesh means your sons so Malachi you can have the anointing on you it can fall on you your daughters all my six daughters the anointing can fall on you your old man we got any old men here today just me your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions amen and also upon the servants servants and upon the hand maids in those days will I pour out my spirit a church you can pray and ask God now say God let your Holy Spirit fall on me because I'm a servant I'm a handmaid I'm a young man I'm a son I'm a daughter I'm an old man let your spirit fall on me you promised it would fall on all flesh amen hallelujah all flesh all man it would fall anyone who'd be willing to come God's provided way praise God for the anointing which is confession hallelujah confess your sin unto God make your request made known unto God in the peace of God that passes all understanding will keep your hearts and minds clear through Jesus Christ that's right so it's a six fold manner because six is the number of man and the number of anointed man is the number six is in a striking church right did you know Israel's endowments as God's people were six fold did you know that they had a six fold blessing upon them because they were anointed right they were anointed of God's Spirit on the on the the flesh and the the human spirit look what Paul says he says who are Israelites and whom pertaineth the adoption see God adopted them God they were down in Egypt and God said out of my out of Egypt have I called my son amen oh yeah he adopted that he called them out of Egypt and he took him for herself that they might serve Him in the wilderness and he might place his adopted son in the promised land amen and the glory and the covenants see covenants and the giving of the law through Moses of course the covenants would be Abraham Isaac Jacob Moses and the service of God in the tabernacle and the promises amen so these are all great things these are numbers these are sixes that God uses first glory now let me go back I'm just thing out Pope yeah yeah let me go back I think I'll have enough time let me go back to 61 here I just was looking at some of the remember the New Testament there were six over comers in John the Baptist day Joseph Mary Zacharias Elizabeth Simeon in an inner six male and female over comers brother Ram said that and who how can I overcome I can't explain it but there are six there are that's where he says he says and how can I overcome okay that's the same one all right now let me go back a little bit further to the anointed man here all right so as we said earlier the sixth day of creation God created an anointed man with a six fold dominion over the earth amen but man said he had a holy veil Adam had a holy veil on him a holy anointing Abraham interceded six times for a lot in Genesis how many are willing to pray a few more times for the same thing Jesus prayed three times that the cup would pass and on the third time God answered Abraham kept praying six times and God answered finally on the sixth one after that he said I've got to go we got to be willing to pray more amen God it would be willing to seek God's face amen that's what the anointed man or woman does they seek the face of God they get God's anointing on them they want to be in God's presence hallelujah on the sixth day of manna I'm sorry on the sixth day manna would be twice as much to cover the seventh day because the seventh was a day of rest so they got a double anointing on the sixth day hey man I like that praise God the sixth day amen six days the glory of the Lord in the cloud covered Mount Sinai but on the seventh day God called unto Moses on the midst of the cloud and Moses was caught up in the cloud on the seventh and stayed forty days and forty nights but it was six days the glory covered it six branches came out of one getting a golden candle stick three on each side as a type of course to seven Church ages Aaron's rod had to officer Aaron's ephod had two stones one for each shoulder each had six names on the children of Israel on them Amen shewbread was in two rows of six on the table there's your double anointing two sixes right there mentioned that earlier a double portion on the sixth day here's a double row of sixes amen there were six cities of refuge where unawares men could flee among the cities of the Levites three on this this side of Jordan and three on the Canaan side amen six days Israel a unleavened bread for the feast and on the seventh day was a solemn assembly praise God Joshua compass Jericho six days company this compass in the city once returning to the camp but the trumpets blowed on the seventh glory Routh was given six measures of barley by Boaz for her and Naomi and was told to rest until he finished the redemption praise God David was doing God a service and he sacrificed oxen and fat Ling's I'm sorry not failings fatlings that's miss wrist pronounced they're misspelled rather maybe I'll just fix that real quick I don't mess it up and then every six spaces or steps he would do more worship or more sacrifice Solomon's Temple had seven steps with twelve Lions on the six steps two groups of six just like the shewbread just like the the stones on Aaron's ephod Esther was purified by six months of oil myrrh and then six more months of sweet odours two sixes amen I love it don't you church seraphim's had six wings too covered their face feet and two for flying and one brought a coal of fire to cleanse eyes to his lips for the anointing oh my number six had a six fold blessing upon man by God the Bible said let let the Lord bless you keep you shine upon you grace upon you countenance upon you let us peace be upon you amen Daniel's Gabriel 6-volt visit to Daniel I'm not gonna go through that I went through that a few months ago but as to finish the transgression make an end of sins make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness and sealed the vision the prophecy and anoint the most holy amen the sixth one was anointing the most holy hallelujah the six hallelujah in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy Gabriel visited Mary praise God where the RAM said life came into John at six months the Holy Ghost anointing struck him Amen that's where he says it in paradox Jesus first miracle changed six pots of water water into wine amen hallelujah six days before the Passover Mary anointed Jesus feet with a pound of ointment a spikenard there's the anointing each of the four living creatures had six wings they anointed the Christians in each age hallelujah Jesus weary sat on the well of Jacob about the sixth hour and exercised the Son of Man gifted the sermon revealing the thoughts and intents of the heart to the Samaritan woman who had six husbands there's the anointed man Peter went up and pray about the sixth hour when he saw the great sheet vision there he was anointed about the sixth hour so remember the sixth hour was noon and here we are it's almost noon right there it's the 11:58 church hallelujah thank you lord amen Oh God move by your spirit praise God amen the anointing six men on Mount Transfiguration Moses Elijah Christ with Peter James and John six men on that anointed Mount where they saw the preview of the rapture hallelujah there's six raptures Enoch Elijah Jesus only to the Father Jesus leading captivity captive the Gentile bride and two prophets in revelation 11 the full armor of God six elements the loins gird about with truth is your mind tied up real tight today you're not letting anything get in your mind but your mind is is tie it's it's R it's really really focused on God's Word amen the breastplate of righteousness the feet shod with the gospel of preparation of peace the shield of faith the helmet of salvation the sword of the Spirit and the seventh action is a prayer so once you got those six now you can go to action now it's time to pray praying always with all prayer and supplication the Bible says once you got the full armor of God on what you're anointed then it's time to pray that's the program says you got to get in the anointing first then you pray then you act on the Word of God he said people get baptized but they go down so they go down a dry sinner they come up a wet one because they never gotten the anointing or the revelation of the word repent they've got to really repent they've got really died out and then when they come up they'll be forgiven and fill it the Holy Ghost amen but see so many people go down they repented they come up the Holy Ghost doesn't come upon them they become a stiff starchy church member something's wrong with that they never got under the anointing Church we got to be under the anointing of the Holy Spirit amen and this is the kind of person he anoints right here the search 6 church age messenger to the Philadelphia was John Wesley under the man anointing man anointed man the third of the fourth beast the anointed man praise God brother Branham smokes six squirrels into existence three in Jeffersonville three in Kentucky he said these six would be a God confirming his ministry of the third Pole and to me that's a confirmation of God's anointed prophet Isle they lujah there he that's where he says it there yeah he says the number of man six times the mother man says I got six squirrels because it's the number of man the anointed man the man who speaks the word all right I think that might be I think that's what I yeah close with that and then some member Satan imitated the number six Satan had one of Goliath have six fingers and six toes yeah all right is that a good reminder by God's grace okay all right let's go to number seven now so I just want to review that as I've been studying these last few days I've come across those I want to make sure I give those to you by God's grace see now if you don't have a six in your life don't feel bad but one thing you can you can get on the six pieces of armor of Jesus Christ and you can be a soldier for Jesus Christ today I don't want to be a soldier amen start with your mind that's the first thing gird about the loins of your mind don't let anything contrary to God's Word get any place in your thoughts cast out anything that's exalts itself against them the Word of God and bring into captivity to the Holy Spirit amen so brother seven again his completion now the last time I preached it back in September I think it was September 15th I preached on the number seven so just review program said everything's is in threes there are three is a perfect number five is a number of gray seven completion twelve worship twenty-four or forty temptation fifty is the Jubilee the very word Pentecost means Jubilee fifty now God in His numerals he's perfect in his numerals I believe that so in each of these cases where God had sixes or sevens or eights God is perfect in them he's trying to get us to see something that will help us today and help us to better know him by His grace now these are ones already shared last time I just I just think I highlighted what just one yeah I just did one Joshua's army marched around jericho seven times on the seventh day with seven priests bearing seven trumpets of ram horns going before the ark so that was going to be a complete God was completely gonna deliver Jericho in the hand of Israel completely he was going to complete it that day so it was a lot of sevens that day and the member had a shout and Trump I'm still looking for the voice there I know there's got to be a rapture type there I'm still looking for the voice because there's a shout in the trunk there's got to be a voice laying there I just got to pray more and 7000 men did not bow the knee to bail in the days of Elijah the seven naming the leper had to dip seven times in the Jordan River to be cleansed and that's a type of the seven church ages in order for the whole church to be cleaned and all be together remember Hebrews 11 wrote about it how they died in faith I had not have you received the promise what were they doing they were waiting on you and I and if we die then we'll be waiting on the next generation that comes is that right everybody in the body of Christ is waiting to come to full completion and we'll all come to completion at the rapture amen that's when the body of Christ will be finished amen that's a type of that it's he was he was completely healed he was made totally whole on the seventh praise God the seven dip for us the seven church age here's some new ones I haven't shared yet so now this is all new there's no review now seven classifications for living things in nature I remember learning this in high school I learned this I memorized it kingdom phylum class order family genus species of all living things have a Sevenfold classification anybody learned that lately anybody Lydia not yet okay I was a junior when I learned it cuz I remember the class I was in there's seven colors in the rainbow Roy G Bev red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet seven days in a week these are all completions so colors completed in seven living things are completed in seven different categories there are seven days a week as completed in Swiss seven days there are seven openings to the head two eyes two nostrils two years in the mouth it's completed there's there's seven notes and music I think that's right I should ask Malachi and amen now seven is rest because God worked for six created on the seventh he rested he was completely done so he rested on the seventh he knock the seventh from Adam walked home in a rapture showing that when a person's really complete they're ready to walk home and go home with Jesus in the seventh generation from Adam again a type of the seven church age as well the Laodicean bride the bride who's alive and remain will walk out of laodicea to meet Christ in the air she'll walk right out of here amen a week equals seven years so it's a period of time it's a complete period of labor we'd say because a week is seven years Jacob had to work a week for Leah and then another week for Rachel so that's a complete period of time David had not I put a question mark after this one David had seven other brothers that were refused he was the eighth so seven might be complete refusal I don't know that's just my guess on that one I'm not quite sure but Abraham's Abraham had a Sevenfold blessing how many know that if you go to Genesis well God said avi I'll make a great nation so you'll be a great nation I'll bless you I'll make your name great so people hear your name your reputation less that's a great man thou shalt be a blessing so to others I will bless them that bless thee so anyone who blesses you I'm blessing them amen glory anyone that curses you I'm cursing him in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed amen remember Church you are a child of Abraham by faith in Jesus Christ how many got faith in Christ they amen will this blessing that roommate relates to it flows to your life amen the blessing of God is on your life Deuteronomy a8 says now listen isn't interesting there's seven promised land foods that are listed God said I'm gonna give you wheat barley vines fig trees pomegranates olives and honey you can look it up God says I'm gonna give you seven wonderful foods in that land I'm gonna feed you a seven of them praise God complete nourishment praise the Lord you might want to help that might help us all with our diets then huh maybe we should apply that to our diet I'll text everybody that so you can work on your diet this week it's a perfect time of the year too you know it's the new year this is beautiful God gives Israel seven I wills Amen hallelujah now they're in Egypt they haven't come out but God tells them this wherefore saying to the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out under the burdens of the Egyptians amen I will who's gonna do it not Lowe's us not Aaron God's gonna do it he said that I will rid you of their bondage and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments and I will take you to me for a people and I will be to you a God and you shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out from under the burden of the Egyptians and I will bring you like this one I will bring you into the land concerning which I did swear to give it to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and I will give it to you foreign heritage I am the Lord amen in other words I'm going to do complete redemption I'm going to bring you out with all this power and I'm gonna place you in praise God amen I will do it and church when we want something done whose got to do it God's got to do it praise God remember the I am will do it amen the I am is also the I will gonna say like that the I am is that I will praise the Lord I will do it God will do it amen the blood was applied in seven locations in Moses Tabernacle so in order for it to be completely clean it had to be applied in seven locations on the mercy seat it had to be before the mercy seat it had to be before the veil it had to be on the horns of the golden altar it had to be on the other altar of incense it had to be on the horns of the brazen altar in the outer court and had me round about the altar on the ground and then whatever blood was left over had to be poured out at the foot of the brazen altar Amen Sevenfold it was complete anointed complete covered completely covered by the blood amen hallelujah for a sin-offering blood was sprinkled seven times before the veil first sin-offering so if you want to be forgiven by the of your sins and you brought a sin offering there to kill that at that animal and they had to sprinkle it seven times before the veil and the priests dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle the blood seven times before the Lord before the veil the sanctuary to cleanse a leper blood was sprinkled on him seven times amen and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times why not five why not six because this was going to be a complete work amen he says and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose in the open field as your two birds amen remember one was one was killed for the other than well that's how represents how Jesus you know there were a husband and wife bird right and the husband had to die for the female praise God and Jesus had to die for our cleansing amen we took that blood seven times the leper was sprinkle with that blood on the day of atonement now this is the day when every sin from the past year would be forgiven blood was sprinkled seven times as a sin offering for the people he would take of the blood of the bull hock and sprinkle with his finger but I'm sorry upon the mercy seat eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times this is sound like God likes the number seven and blood blood and seven that's right here's one I preached on last year it was such a powerful move of the Holy Spirit the red heifers blood was sprinkled seven times before the tabernacle so before anyone could be forgiven or any proselyte could be brought into the Jewish camp they had to be clean before they can even come behind the curtains even into the outer court and began in order for this to be possible the pure or the red heifer had to be killed and that blood had to be sprinkled seven times and brother Branham said that was blood for every church age before you and I could even be baptized there had to be a blood there that would already cleanse us amen there had to be a blood that would already forgive us and that was a shed blood of Jesus Christ shed to forgive all seven Church ages amen glory now the New Testament there were seven offerings from a boy that Christ multiplied five loaves plus two fishes it was a complete offering complete offering which led to the feeding of a multitude praise God and I think church when we completely offer ourselves to God don't we see a real a real multiplication of blessings don't you see that and then there's so much blessings there's leftover blessings there's fragments one one place as twelve baskets other one said seven baskets leftover there's so many leftover blessings when you fully sacrifice your heart to God give up everything for Jesus after six days so on the seventh day Jesus took three disciples up to Mount Transfiguration I got 15 minutes this is actually going pretty good for done believe it or not and Jesus went to show them the preview of the rapture it was after 6:00 on the seventh praise God and of course that was because the rapture would be in the seven church age Enoch was the seventh from Adam Peter and six men entered into car News's house when the Holy Ghost fell yes amen seven complete amen they're gonna get a complete baptism amen I like that now you know there's seven spiritual attributes that complete a believer who's then ready to be born again so that completely sanctifies them can I say like that let me write that real quick whoops complete sanctification there I just want to make sure I don't get that I don't forget that complete sanctification how many believe in complete sanctification program said when you're cleaned out fully then God will come in fully amen but if there's still things that are lingering in your life and heart that you haven't given up to Christ you've got to give him up and then he'll come in all the way praise God that's right because that's what the Word of God says there's there's seven and then the eighth will get you now is charity the baptism of the Holy Ghost so God does a complete Sevenfold sanctification work in your life and then he caps you off with eternity amen now eights really got two definitions these are just the same because I use or here so it can either mean eternity or the first day again whatever you want to say or it can mean a new creation or a new start a new beginning that's what I think God gave our church a new beginning and wasn't that in the eighth month yeah August wasn't it when we had that flood I think it was glory well that just struck me right here amen hey we always want to know where we where we stand with God don't we yeah we uh well thank the Lord amen I wasn't ready for that one church age book chapter 2 let's see what the Bible teaches us about the Sabbath rest now of course he's getting the Sabbath for he that is entered into his rest this entering in is not only entering in but remaining in the rest it is an eternal rest of which the seven-day is but a type 7 is completion 8 is the first day again Jesus resurrection was in the first day of the week giving us eternal life and eternal Sabbath rest so see that see Jesus resurrection is is two numbers it's number three life and the number eight for eternity new beginning so his resurrection fulfilled two numbers their life and then eternity eternal life thus we see why God could not give us any one certain day of the week as the Sabbath rest we've entered into and do and do remain in our rest which Israel could not do having only a shadow of the true substance which we enjoy why go back to a shadow when we have reality now amen thank God hallelujah first we got such a reality in the Old Testament it would sacrifice those animals and the Bible said their conscience would remain guilty the next time they come back and sacrifice but you and I by the blood of Jesus Christ can confess our sin and our conscience can be cleaned that's because God delivers us from any demon powers and we'll never do it again praise God he completely dens in delivers us from our addictions and habits and all these things and our conscience is not defiled I do not live with a default conscious that I'm still smoking or I'm still cussing I'm still drinking or I'm still addicted to this or that we don't live with that because the Bible says God's given us eternal life we're in our New Covenant and our conscious our clean by the blood of Jesus Christ amen it's a rest its eternal life we should know that he turned that he has entered into us I'm resting in God's Spirit I'm resting in God's life are you resting in that today you've ceased from your old works of the world and now you do the works of God thank you lord here's where he says its new creation in the future home seven days watch which passed away or I've said we'll change to another eight days now we're going to go through this quote here in a few moments the full quote eight days deals with new creation see not all creation eight days is new creation yeah it was August because the Graham's letter last Sunday here was on the first Sunday of the August so just now that just came to my mind yeah so God's doing something new in starting in the eighth month glory now he says charity now charity eight is the number of new creation so when God's holy spirit also known as charity also known as love when that comes down and caps somebody off with the baptism of the holy ghost they are not out a new creation in Christ day men they're a new creation the old things have passed away they're so passed away the Bible said they're sealed out they're locked out they're shut out amen never more to be returned because they're sealed out to the day of our Redemption so see the Holy Ghost or charity is the eighth and final virtue or attribute in the statute perfect man because God's fear is immortal or eternal so it works either way whether you say new creation or eternity eight works either way as charity in the statute of a perfect man so God gives you first second third fourth fifth sixth huh godliness God anointed anointed man godliness man like God brotherly kindness and then charity love amen new beginning praise God a fresh start you're finally ready to live once you're born again amen you're finally fit to live on this earth once you're born again and eternal life has come into you you're immortal a part of you is immortal and eternal you've had a new creation amen now brother Branham says now you just turn the leaf over you said the leaf over you got a brand new leaf hallelujah you got a brand new branch you got ready you got brand new life amen hallelujah when the real Holy Ghost comes upon you you live a new life it's eternal life now it also means the first day again now here's where we look at a future home just for a few moments I'm almost done with my 45 minutes - Jesus resurrected on the first day of the week so it's the first day again so it's the eighth day the first day of the week is a week has seven days well when you start a new week now it's the eighth day from that first day now the Bible said there would be a holy convocation which is a sacred assembly or Sabbath a day of rest where all the Jews who are resting and not working would all come together and assemble for a holy day a day of worship a holiday and it would be on the eighth day of the Feast of Trumpets all right bless you now remember the spirit let's start here this is the spiritual year of Israel starts in mid-march they have two years they have a civil year and they have a spiritual year the spiritual year starts here with the Passover and they have seven months first the spiritual year the civil year is about the middle of October and goes to the beginning of March that's called this civil year so months eight nine ten eleven twelve that's the civil year I like how the spiritual year has has more months in it don't you seven to five I like how God divided it so for seven years they're in a spiritual year and God said there's really just three main feasts but within them we know there's seven yeah but there's really three main ones the Passover now he calls that the unleavened bread God calls that feast of weeks in the Feast of Tabernacles those are the three names that we call the through the feasts of Israel but inside of them they have other feasts like the Passover is first then the feast of unleavened bread then the feast of firstfruits so that was Jesus's death here and then that was the day between his crucifixion and the first fruits was his resurrection amen so this is Friday Saturday Sunday praise God Amen already fulfilled now here's where we're at now we are in this feast right now we're in the feast of weeks the feast of weeks is summertime isn't a pretty hot spiritually Church isn't it pretty hot does the Bible say that those Hebrew children that have got turned up seven times hotter praise God it's hot it's harvest time amen but we're gleaning but if the Lord of the harvest hasn't come back then there's still work to be done amen and the II said just pray he said just pray that I'll send forth laborers out into the harvest amen God just needs a labor God just needs somebody who labor in the hot discouraging strenuous age that is Laodicea but thank God for the former range sister Connie but thank God we got a former rate the teaching rate of Malachi four five and six amen oh and you know if there's a former eight then there's got to come a ladder ain't a net wrap string fake they men hallelujah because it's thus saith ax I'm sorry Joel chapter 2 if there's a former rain there's got to be a ladder rain to come to finally harvest this that this harvest here at the end before the trumpets blow and gather all Israel back for the Feast of Trumpets oh my let me say like this church we've already gathered by the gospel trumpet hey yeah and there'll be one more trumpet that's gonna sound shout very strum the the Trump of God and when that trumpet blows you'll hear your name crawled your body will be swallowed up in the feel for the glorified and you'll go to meet your theophany in the air amen that's the one trumpet were waiting for amen hallelujah it's exactly right oh my and when this rapture goes Church then the trumpets will blow in Israel we gather they're ready for their day of atonement by Mercy Lord and of course their David toment was on the tenth day of the seventh month and that's when they'll as we said on Wednesday night that's when they'll go from house to house and say we've crucified our Messiah they'll mourn from this the house of behind the Bible said to the house of Zebulun and they'll more from house to house and the Bible said when nature veil they'll give birth in one day a man how do their yeah and so see that they then they get born again so if you want to be born again if you want more of God you've got to travail until God brings for something in your life amen glory I seem to agree with him but humans have only been on the earth about 6,000 years and brought that lines up with what brother Branham said he said it could have been millions and he said billions of years they can now measure the distance light travels they never canoe before and to travel east certain distances in this space it had to be about 14 billion years old so the flood was after 2,000 years God does something every 2,000 years doesn't he he had it but a flood after the first 2,000 and then he brought the cross after the second 2,000 now we are in the seven church ages were finishing up the sixth day and then the holy fire will come after that right and then the seventh day of course will be the millennium that's the seventh day now this is where program teaches in the future home so that millennium is the seventh day God finally gets his seven day with no interruption of sin but the eighth day is the new heavens and the new earth it's also called the New Jerusalem okay how does that make sense by God's grace this is what brother I'm saying the Feast of Trumpets had the celebration that was I'm saw the Feast of Tabernacles I was on the eighth day and program saying well people say well you don't have anymore eights and he's like yes I do the seventh day is the Millennium the eighth day is the future home God give us an eighth Church Alleluia so don't feel bad if your name has eight letters in it or you're the eighth child or something like that or you're born in the eighth year no don't feel bad about that it's a good number praise God all these numbers are good numbers when God's with the numbers amen saying this ain't over every one of those numbers so don't take Satan's perversion takes God take God's beautiful creation amen his purpose behind his numbers take that no two seven days only has to do with all creation world time seven days that's the money on the rest day and God labored six days rested on the seventh a church labor six days and rests on the seventh ha ha oh ha our Labor's almost over church just keep working keep laboring for Jesus do everything you can for Christ keep labor and it's almost a seven-day it's almost the millennium but you're still in a time element I ain't speaking of the eternal but you see there's no such thing as eight days you go back the first day I see the first day the Sabbath speaks of the old law which was the pass away the keeping of a Sabbath which passed away orbs or if I said or I have said change to another it didn't pass away just change from the old law of keeping a certain day of the week so the Saturday Sabbath from the Old Testament has changed and now it's not that we keep a literal day it's that we keep ourselves in the baptism of the Holy Ghost we rest from our works and now we crucify ourselves you know we let we crucify the lusts of the flesh and all these things the affections they're up and now we let the Holy Spirit work in our lives that's the true Sabbath today and the church said but I like to I tell the Sabbatarians I've had a lot a mail me the last year I tell them you know I said the Sabbath is the baptism Holy Ghost but but just just for you know just for your sake God give me a rest day and it's it's it's Sunday Sunday is now my Sabbath like if you want a physical day of rest I don't work on Sunday I never go to work on Sunday but I'm working for Jesus but that don't count because you can wear the priests could work on the Sabbath day and Jesus said well you were your priests work on the Sabbath but they blasting the Sabbath he said but God forgives them because they're doing God a service amen that's the same thing I say God built our day of rest our physical day of rest right into today you're enjoying rest aren't you nobody's got to go well air might have to go toil tonight but on most occasions you don't have to toil on Sunday oh not tonight well glory amen but see God he gives us the spiritual the real meaning of the Sabbath is to be born again but he also builds into it the first day of the week sunday is our day of rest we shouldn't work if we can possibly help it on the day of rest Sunday God builds it into our schedules and it's true let me just go back to say that I preach now for 14 years and I preached many of those Sundays and I preach I heart out I preach my voice out and every time I've never missed a Monday so see that proves I worked all day Sunday but God didn't count it as work and I go to work the next day and I got strength to go to work the next day that proves it right that's right that's what Willie's proves it to me maybe not you but it proves it to me you enter into life not keeping a day or shadow Paul said over there in Hebrews the fourth chapter you keep gazing shadows and things like that I'm scared of your experience he says see we don't pass in the certain days in orders we passed from death unto eternal life not days and times you pass into eternity that's the holy convocation rather seven days watch which pass away or I've said we'll change to another eight days deals with new creation see not all creation eight days is new creation it for it was on the eighth day that our Lord raised from the dead he said there's your other convocation the holiness not considering the Sabbath at all or the Feast of the Tabernacles feast of that Feast of Pentecost Jesus raised from the dead for our justification on the eighth day after the seven Sabbath's or seven days seven Church Ages Jesus raised from the dead eighth day which is holy convocation see which is the first day now I got a few more slides here let me see yeah I'm almost done yeah I'm almost done I only got three more slides well there you go it can mean a new beginning like we saw in August the glory of the Lord fell on the eighth day when the Aaronic priesthood offerings for the people to make atonement for them found the eighth day the leper was declared clean at the door of the congregation you guessed it on the eighth day he got a fresh start he went to church seven he couldn't go to church but on the eighth day he finally goes there and the priest says you're clean have a fresh start welcome in the church welcome back brother good to have you back it's a fresh start for you you're clean welcome back to God's fold amen the pride of the son received eight witnesses of his new beginning the father fell on his neck kissed him game Oh gave him a ring gave him shoes killed the fatted calf ate it and then he said let us make merry eight things for a new beginning oh thank you Jesus amen I love how God is trying to tell us something he's trying to tell us he's trying to make himself known to us the paralyzed Aeneas I'm not sure how to say that heal by Peter and the eighth year of his infirmity just see Satan could have easily whispered Oh see here in the eighth year you know sevens sevens completion and five is grace you already past the fifth year God's not gonna have any grace on you see how Satan will live to lighten people's minds like this but see God uses it for another reason God can use any of his numbers since he created them he can use them all for his glory and so Satan he wouldn't take Satan's words he said well Peters a man of God and Peter prayed for him and he was healed of his infirmity in the eighth year the eighth year oh thank you Jesus David was the youngest of eight sons he was number eight see God was beginning something new he was beginning with a king after his own heart he was starting something new because member Saul was chosen by men right God said I'm gonna do something new I'm gonna get a king after my own heart and it was so new that he said I'm gonna let that the priesthood of David go right so the priesthood of David lasted all those years amen till Christ came there was eight souls were saved by water during the flood would they get they got a brand new beginning when they come out and sacrificed brand-new beginning eight now the lot this a Hebrew boy was circumcised on the eighth day and I thought maybe it's because he's a new male member of the Covenant because without the circumcision you were not part of the Covenant so in order to be in the Covenant you had to be circumcised on the eighth day so it seems like he has a the the male has a fresh start a new beginning he's a part of the covenant of Abraham that's what it seems like to me I could be wrong no that's why I put a question mark let's say an or fee satan's invitation of eight this is the only eight that I can find right now that were Satan's trying to use the eight to kind of imitate God the Beast which I think seems to be the person the Antichrist in revelation 17 11 is the 8th King which some people say is a pope which it could be I think we've talked now we talked about that brother Aaron okay because something some people were counting the number of popes like to see what number this Pope was so it was just interesting I'm not sure if you I or somebody else talked about that but this beast is the 8th King and he's of the seventh King and then he goes into perdition which which means Hellfire or destruction because perdition means destruction so this 8th King will exalt himself above all that's called God as the Antichrist but then he'll be judged by the Word of God Jesus Christ now as much as he tries to imitate imitations will never work it's got to be genuine now I come to the piano how many 1 a genuine walk with the Lord today we don't want to imitation Church we don't want to be pretend just play Church we want to be the church we want to be written epistles known and read of all men and we want people to say about us I don't know how what school they been to I don't even know if they've been to a school but one thing we know they've been with Jesus how many want that in their life praise God let's have about have a word of Prayer to us bow our heads here as we pray chair think about that if you really want to be a genuine Christian if there's anything you need clean out of your life let's get it clean now if you don't feel like you're annoying to the Holy Spirit that's the number six and that's to get you to think what am I doing in my humanity that I'm keeping the blessing of God from anointing me is there anything I'm doing that's keeping the anointing of God off me if you're longing for a new beginning they've been struggling something for a while and you need like a fresh start how many know God's the god of the fresh start and with the prodigal he did it over and over again he remember he renews the strength like an eagle your strength and return your experience can return your love can return it can be brand new again you can have the anointing of God on you let's have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord these are your children these are your people but I've tried to let your spirit preach this morning Lord some of these things I'll review somewhere new to us and Lord that fulfills what Jesus said the teacher brings out things both old and new old things we've heard new things we haven't and Lord is to do this to make Jesus Christ known amen glory father my prayer Lord now is that you'll make yourself known to these people that love you that have sacrificed to be here that have gathered we'd say for this holy convocation dear God this sacred assembly where we don't work we don't think about the things of the world all we think about is Jesus Christ amen hallelujah [Music] Lord Jesus we thank you Lord God I
