========================================

foreign ERS especially our families and our loved ones the home Church I would like to preach on just once more Lord judges 16 28. I'd like to as I said on Sunday I'd like to preach more faith sermons and raise our faith here I need my faith raised Hallelujah I trust it'll be a blessing to you by the grace of the Lord I do want to watch the length here I told brother amen we were just talking I wrote down this list of things I like to preach a little less if we could pray a little more at the end of services by God agree so I don't want to feel pressured like I have to finish my thought I'd like to have a little more prayer time at the end of services I really enjoyed that Sunday the extra prayer on the second service um brother amen and I were just praying that God would do miracles for each and every person praise God one topic that just came up Sister reserves that we just realized what a miracle your life is that you're back in the house of God we were rejoicing over your testimony we thought wow you know excuse me we were saying you know we want God to do Miracles but then we realize wow what a wonderful Miracle sitting right here standing right here with us our sisters there so we love you sisters there and I just really encourage me I don't want to forget the miracle looking right at me and each one of you your life is a miracle for the glory of God a miracle all the way from Arizona two Miracles all the way from Arizona raspberries Hallelujah so we're thankful for the grace of the Lord judges 16 28 just one verse and I have a little word of prayer again have you be seated here let's read that on three one two three and Samson called unto the Lord and said O Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once o God that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines for my two eyes uh just a wonderful amazing prayer here he was asking for Revenge he was asking for revenge in his prayer and did you know there's two verses in the New Testament where you can ask for Revenge so we'll look at those at the end of the service here tonight Hallelujah and of course I'll just kind of let let you remind you the Revenge that we want is Revenge from our past mistakes right so we don't want revenge against other people we want revenge from our own mistakes in other words we want revenge over our sinful nature and the church said amen so don't think about well this person did me wrong I want revenge over them no I want revenge over Jesse Smith my sin nature and so that's what that's what we can pull from Samson I might have failed Jesse Smith might have failed last week but I want revenge I want a victory here tonight by God's grace does everybody understand that's our word of prayer father God we thank you for tonight Lord I've listened to this sermon I've Loved this sermon this sermon has meant so much to me over the years Lord God and so I pray Lord you just anoint me to preach your word bless each and every person that came out here and those that would listen on the live stream or the archive Lord God receive all the glory the lord we pray like Samson just once more Lord just visit us just once more dear God are we how we love when you visit Lord God we love the daily Christian Life and we love the the constant fellowship with you but Lord we also love special visitations Lord God when we we all know that God visited us because we know you'll never leave us nor forsake us Hallelujah but there are special visitations that we rejoice in Lord God we might call getting our first love back we might call it Revival Lord we just enjoy those times so much Lord God so we thank you and we give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you being seated praise God good to see you brother Marlon God bless you sir Hallelujah somebody set a timer here we'll kind of see how it goes it's eight or seven o'clock okay not eight o'clock okay so if you haven't listened to sermon lately I would encourage you to do it I think I'm going to preaching it around four or five times sometimes he calls it just once more Lord or oh Lord just just once more and I listened to the one from uh November 17th 1963. so I'm just gonna just revisit some of my brother man's thoughts and then you know add my own scriptures here uh by the grace of God um so uh by God's grace like I said I will see how long it goes I don't know maybe it'd be a 25 minute I mean we might laugh but maybe I'll preach 25 minutes tonight I don't know kind of see how it goes but I'd like to spend a little more time praying at the End by God's grace so brother Brown starts this particular message uh kind of giving a background he said it was probably a hot day at this Philistine Temple and he said there was 3 000 Philistines celebrating a victory over Jehovah's servant and he said their fish God Dagen was was standing up there uh and everybody was uh rejoicing over the victory that the fish had had over Jehovah's servant the fish God and brother Randolph said Samson was being led in of course and he was led in as a disgrace but Ram said uh the man had failed he said God didn't fail but the man failed and that's what we know in our lives God never fails Hallelujah even if even if there's tragedies in our lives God never failed God didn't promise a flowery bed of ease there's not one scripture that says it he promised us rest in our souls is what he promised us hallelujah he also said thinking not strange when fiery Trials come on you he said we must all go through the fiery Trials of faith that our faith may be purified we don't want to go to heaven with a selfish heart we don't want to try to go to heaven uh as as babies right we want to go as mature solid Christians praise God Christians that put on the full armor of God Amen Hallelujah but Samson here is let in he's a disgrace he's failed brother Rand said he was spiritually stripped of his spiritual power and he was morally broken he he broken all the moral stands or Sinners that he'd held for his life the spirit of God was stripped from him think of that the spirit of God was taken from him because of his choices the church the same thing can happen to us we can grieve the Holy Spirit and the anointing can leave us right is that true the Bible says Ephesians 4 30. you know grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption praise God so you can be sealed in your soul but the spirit grieved from your your mind like we showed the illustration there at the Baptist Church you can have God's spirit totally grieved in your mind and your body but your soul can be seated your soul can be at rest my goodness it's just it's an amazing thought it's a I would call it a mystery godliness restored to man it's one of the mysteries of God kind of dramatizes it and says this was the main event of uh the Philistine event the main event was to make fun of Samson and make fun of Jehovah and uh the brother man said they had all their preliminaries he said maybe they brought out monkeys and the monkeys perform maybe they brought out all these other uh maybe half-dressed women and so forth that all these preliminaries but it came to the main event and Samson was to be mocked and he said all the all the rich men Sat by their uh their queens and they all they were all drunken they drunk the whole time they got drunk and and were waiting for this moment the the climax of the service was to mock Jehovah and mock Jehovah's servant and rejoiced that they had gotten Victory brother said it this makes me sad even thinking about it doesn't it make you sad yes think of that that that uh God was going to be mocked and it was going to make and it's going to be made to look that God had failed but remember God cannot fail praise God hallelujah I love this because God always gets the last word amen no matter how long that event was God was going to get the last word church God's gonna get the last word in your life Hallelujah he's going to get the last word in this church amen hallelujah he's going to get the last word in the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and the last word will be the last Trump Hallelujah when he changes her body in a moment and the twinkling of an eye praise God Hallelujah that's what I'm living for I've been living for that praise God and God will get the last word he'll get the last say he'll get the last to laugh you know they put out all these uh podcasts and videos making fun of brother Adam but God will get the last say Hallelujah listen to the end of this sermon brother Graham glorifies God it's so beautiful he starts getting discernment he starts reading in the vision he starts reading how to uh spell people's last names you can't fake that you can't fake it I mean goes through three or four or five six or seven discernments he said I can't pronounce your name but here's how to spell it friends God visited this generation praise God Hallelujah and he pointed us to Jesus Christ he pointed us to the Holy Spirit praise God he pointed us to this wonderful black backed Bible brother man calls it amen hallelujah thank God he said uh Jehovah had not failed but Jehovah's servant had failed God failed Jehovah brother man said it used to be the entire Philistine country would tremble at the name of Samson he said just like people used to tremble at the name of Jesus right there used to be so much respect in America for the name of Jesus not anymore unless you're amongst the Believers praise God Amen Hallelujah then you respect the name of Jesus Amen and you're careful what you say about Jesus Hallelujah well Ram said Samson is a perfect parallel to the modern church today the church as a whole has lost its respect because the church has failed now I'm going to make a important point when brother is talking about the failed church it's not talking about us it's not talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ it's talking about the denominations who as we saw even a little bit on Sunday with all due respect we saw how there's a lack of reverence in some Services right everybody understand there's no praying before church it's just talking and laughing that should not be in the Church of the Living God you don't come to God you don't come to a courtroom laughing and joking with the judge you come to the courtroom in reverence and respect for the judge and the Bible said judgment begins at the house of God hallelujah amen now none of us are perfect and you know we just try to as you know too we just try to uh fit in and not be a rebuke on people but just try to Worship the Lord and try to be a real example praise God Hallelujah and so those cases you got to kind of wait till the spirit of God can fall amen wait to get the right Psalms up there wait till you get the right preaching then finally the spirit of God will follow praise God like I said I pray for two men Weeping at the altar there on Sunday morning two grown men I'm sorry one's almost grown he's 17. but almost a grown man Hallelujah he said God has not failed the church the church I'm sorry speaking of denominations have failed God Samson had failed God God never failed Samson brother in other places said Samson failed because he gave God only his his body he didn't give God his heart right he yielded his body to God when God would want to do great Miracles but he didn't give his heart to God he gave his heart to women and eventually Delilah see God but once both your body and your heart I'll say I guess he wants all through your soul body Spirit praise God we got to give God all of it praise God Hallelujah must not be like Samson just give you know one part of us or maybe two parts of us and of course you know we want to balance this out because remember he was put in the Hall of Fame of faith in Hebrews 11 so he served god well for many years but remember during that 20 years after he lost that wife that he wanted that Gentile wife then he started visiting harlots and so forth after that and then he kind of got off and then look God brings him right back at the end God brings them back into Fellowship praise God and God puts him in the Hall of Fame of but not it's not about your mistakes it's about getting right with God God will put you and I in the Hall of Fame of Faith as well Hallelujah as the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we can live the word of God just live the word that he's given to us how many can say Amen to that praise God live this word enjoy this word rejoice in this word that God has given to us brother Rand makes a whole point he says of the whole church he says he said today the church doesn't have ananias and Sapphira right it's very rare even in brother Adams meetings it's very rare for an ananias and Sapphire type of anointing where people will die if they if they lie to the Holy Spirit think about that most nurses are filled with people who lie to the Holy Spirit oh they act like everything's okay everything's okay but not at the early church right if they lied to Peter they packed him out dead is that right right brother said that was one proof that the church today has lost its sincerity remember Church the whole point of Brothers Ministry was to restore the book of Acts amen hallelujah so we believe we're being restored by the time of the Rapture if we're here or whoever's here it will be so sincere I believe it'll be like that praise God because it's got to go out the same way it came in that's the principle Alpha and Omega first and last Hallelujah I will restore all the years that the Paul worm came to learn locusts and caterpillar has eaten God's going to restore all that praise God think about that church walking into service and thinking I don't want to die I'm going to confess my sins will we live to see it I hope so by God's grace I hope so where everybody's so sincere they don't walk in that door until they've confessed all their sins right because we're all going to have one every day aren't we we're gonna have one sin at least one sin every day we're gonna make a mistake but that's what he says that's the comparison he's making like Samson versus the church Samson had great the church had this but then they've lost it but God is the god of restoration brother Brown said we have the keys to the kingdom plus we have the gifts of the Spirit he said but if we compromise we become nothing but alive and I don't believe that's us I believe that speaking of denominations he said Samson lost his power the church loses its influence of its testimony Hallelujah brother Adam said the the church in the days of Jesus had lost its power in Matthew 15. Jesus said uh you make the word of God of none effect by your Traditions Hallelujah so Creeds and traditions of men and dogmas right that make the word of God of none effect that's why we've always got to preach against sin if we allow sin it'll take all the power out but if we preach against the sin it'll keep the Holiness in the church praise God the program makes a statement like the churches they stop preaching about hair length and modest clothes and and Men drinking alcohol and all these things and and men being married three four times the Soviet deacons in the church and the church we've lived above that praise God by God's grace that's why I believe this is not referring to us praise God but but we still want more power the point is we want more of God we want God to restore the church like it was in the book of Acts praise God Hallelujah brother said you have to put mechanics with their Dynamics together he said Dynamics is faith in the word so just having if Jesus said it I believe it praise God right just having that that strong faith now mechanics he says those knowing your position and that's the part we preach on Sunday you have to find the will of God first amen amen so think about that church we have to say God can do it that's the Dynamics Hallelujah God is powerful God's Supernatural but then the mechanics is now let's find God's will for this right that's the balance I know my position I'm a son or daughter of God a sister can have a gift to cast out devils just like a brother that's the position I gotta know my position I gotta know what God's called me to do sisters can have gifts of Miracles Hallelujah I was just reading there in Josiah remember who was it that prophesied in Josiah it was a woman Prophet I forget her name does anybody remember her name uh it starts with a D uh Dinah or something like that it's a woman Prophet that came and prophesied Josiah because you kept the word of God God will not let you see evil in your day amen because we keep the word of God made God granted that we that we do evil in our day Hallelujah a woman prophetess Hallelujah so see I'm trying to raise the Faith of Our sisters now how about our brothers amen Brothers Let's be strong and courageous hallelujah amen amen let's lead the way with faith we gotta have faith and we got to have mechanics we gotta have Dynamics and mechanics we have to know God can do it believe God is here believe God is with us live a holy life but we got to have the mechanics and finally let's find the will of God who has the anointing on him to do this praise God amen Hallelujah and they told member brother and told the story of the man uh he was uh I believe a Luther he said I went to a Pentecostal meeting and all they're doing is kicking over chairs and screaming shouting speaking in tongues and and the man said now brother how could that be God brother man said these wise words he said if he said I don't know I'm not judging God in other words I'm not going to blaspheme the Holy Spirit right but then he says well why did they do it he said well they don't know their position so they're just trying to let the steam off Hallelujah but imagine if they could just get together with the the people that know the the position in Christ he said the Church of God would start moving on Amen [Music] so God can move right to the church praise God remember Church Peter preached a five-minute sermon and the Holy Ghost fell in cornelius's house I don't have to preach an hour and I'm going to try to push that through my head these next few weeks brother Austin I'm trying to cram that down my head I don't care how long I preach anymore now what I was trying to get through the thoughts but what I want to see is faith in the word of God we need to have faith in the word of God and get behind the word of God and let God move praise God if there's needs here let's call on God just like Samson amen he didn't sit back and just you know whisper he called on God hallelujah that's what we can do how many how many can do that tonight by God's grace you can call on God remember I said why should the church take a defeat why should Samson take a defeat you didn't have to but he had but he took a defeat because of his own sin but Robert said if we have Mark 16 how can how can we take a defeat these signs shall follow them that believe Hallelujah but Raph said we should at least be like the heat three Hebrew children that said uh King I don't know if God will do it but all he knows we will not bow our knee to this Idol that should be our our very least of our faith right if we get challenged or Satan challenges with sickness or something we should be able to say I don't know if God's gonna do it but I'm going to pray and ask God because I know he's willing and able praise God Amen yeah amen we cannot be ashamed of the Gospel in other words brother Adam says Satan I'm sorry uh yeah brother says Satan caused uh Samson's eyes to be plucked out he said that's what the enemy does he shuts off your eyes from the light of the gospel and you cannot see the gospel truth anymore you can't now seeing represents Enlightenment which represents understanding so when Samson's eyes are out he doesn't understand the gospel he doesn't he doesn't understand the move of God anymore he's in slavery and so that represents we don't understand something uh we don't understand what sin is doing to us and we're a slave and in some type of addiction and the church said amen the eyes are plucked out the understanding's gone and now just like Samson going around and around every week is the same every week is the same I'm still addicted to this I'm still battling this it's just it's a cycle the same cycle same cycle when we should break out of the cycle praise God Hallelujah said getting your sight back is Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah that's getting your sight back huh do you pronounce that Samson was captive by the nation that he was raised up to destroy he said it's a type of the Pentecostal Church 50 years ago so 50 years from that would have been 1913. right that was seven years after Azusa Street like we preached them he said but now Pentecost is divided up into many denominations he said denominations are cursed because they hand the move of I'm sorry they put their hand on the move of the spirit they stop Revival and the spirit is completely grieved away like again like we saw Sunday right denominations they don't they don't know about Revival they don't make a room for it they don't create an atmosphere for it but see we're trying to bring it in there Hallelujah that's right that's what the pastor was praying for brother Austin that we'd bring in the Holy Spirit praise God that's what he's been praying for like I told you people saying telling them oh it's got to be tongues he knows better not everybody speaks with tongues but the spirit of God will bring us to the word of God it'll make us thankful we'll give thanks Hallelujah it'll make us sing songs all the day Hallelujah it'll make us believe in Supernatural Hallelujah it'll make us get one Accord it'll make us love each other praise God hey man said let's think about what the Philistines were thinking of he said the Philistines he said although drunk he said alcohol was going down their beards they remembered that man Samson killing a thousand men with one Jawbone of a mule he said some of them remember Gaza when Samson carried the gates away he said maybe six tons he said they remembered Samson when the spirit of the Lord was on him but remember said some of them might have seen and heard that when that line came against Samson and Samson ripped the line in half remember there was honey right there was Honey in the eater not that great riddle Hallelujah and brothers at the church used to cast out Devils raise the dead and he said sin could not dwell among them he said the Holy Spirit would reveal sin as soon as it came into the church saints were blessed when a preacher comes or I preach or whoever we're blessed if our sins get called out we're blessed that's proof that the word of God is with us hallelujah amen amen right because none of us are perfect we all need God's grace but if we confess our sins God is faithful and just to cleanse us from all unrighteousness praise God Amen would it be something it's been so long since I've cast The Devil out now not that I wanted to show my power but Lord are there any more that you want me to do yeah is there a furthering of my work I've only done it one time on this soil as far as I know we're actually seeing the manifestations of the devil the other ones the other Sixers five times was over down there in South America but that's what I think about lord it's been so many years you've all heard my testimony so many times you just say okay I know what he's going to say I remember that testimony that's bad over in Guyana that's 2011. you you know you know right but God has done other things praise God and we're grateful for what he's done but let's not forget the church in the Bible That's the church we're trying to make our standard praise God Amen Hallelujah brother said God is Duty bound to manifest everything in this Bible and now get your Bible go to Psalm 71 18. somehow I came across this and I showed it to brother amen on Sunday Psalms 71 18. so Malachi read that when you got it sorry to put you on the spot but you were turning pretty fast so I thought I'd ask you Psalm 71 18 and this ought to remind you of something I read to you last month I think it was now also when I am old and gray and great oh God forsake me not life sure that strength into this generation and empowered everyone that is to come amen thank you Malachi does that remind you of something remember I read this to you a month ago what was brother Adam's prayer he wrote in his Bible I do believe every word in this Bible To Be Thy word help me to live and prove it so to my generation I didn't even realize he was quoting scripture that's already that was already a prophet's desire let this generation know that God is powerful amen amen so I said don't forget to keep telling that testimony about that sister that God healed keep out there in Arizona keep telling that testimony oh did you hallelujah amen I gotta keep telling about my mom's funeral I gotta keep talking about Jose's healing this generation needs to know that God is the god of power praise God amen help me to prove it he said he said Lord he said uh forsake me not until in other words don't let me die until everyone around me knows God's power Hallelujah man oh it's a great scripture in it Hallelujah remember God is Judy bound to his word if we can just get in the channel pray for Revelation and see which verses God wants to fulfill Hallelujah now brother says now let's go through what was going through Solomon's mind so now we know it's going through the Philistines the drunken Philistines he said let's look at Solomon's mind now he said he was thinking about all the victories he had and how the Lord had blessed him as long as he kept the promises of God he remembered his Nazarite vow which he for which he forsook he broke the vow of Separation now that ought to open our hearts right God help me to live separated to Christ let me not let sin into my life let me live separated like I promised I would Hallelujah he said brother man Samson realize I failed God's people remember the man said uh there was other compromisers like lot and Abraham lot was a compromiser but Abraham wasn't Abraham stayed true to the word of God he said lot didn't have enough courage and here Samson didn't have enough courage to overcome Delight of Temptation he said many women today or many preachers today are afraid to preach against women cutting their hair wearing a moral clothes committing spiritual adultery men having social drinks on Christmas and telling dirty jokes yet can remain deacons in the church amen he said Samson was reminded reminded of how he failed God and his people and brother Adam said I want brother man said I have no selfish motives I only have Zeal for the Lord he said this the very thing the Pentecostal people were called out to destroy they're now enslaved by see Pentecost was called out of denominations but then they just went and created denominations right and how do we know because more sin came into their churches that's what we've got to watch out hallelujah our church came our church started fresh our chart our church is a is a uh uh a brand new church nobody started this this church isn't a a church split this was started organically by the Holy Spirit praise God Hallelujah God started this church back in uh it would have been 2003 when brother Tim started those uh well I started the Bible studies I imagine I started the Bible studies when Tim started the Saturday night services back there while I was playing football I couldn't go to the Saturday night services here so we have both had some part in it Hallelujah but see we wanna we were called out to to come against the denominational system and we can't let sin make us a denomination brother answer the Pentecostal move was like a doll going back to its vomit let's not be like a dog going back to his vomit Let's Be Like an Eagle getting his strength back praise God I wait upon the Lord and God will renew our strength hallelujah amen let's not go back to Obama let's go back to flying in the heavenlies praise God amen listen to the sermon if you have in church whether answer the church ought to have a holy power in the church that will make demons flee he said what caused this Samson he said let a woman lure him away from his nazirite vow his separation from God he said she shaved off his oddness he said the church is supposed to be odd we're supposed to be a peculiar people but he says now the church tries to outshine other denominations Hallelujah we can't let the enemy shave off our vow to God we've got to keep our vows we got to be separate from the things of the world we got to live differently I gotta live holy you and I got to magnify Christ and live a separated life praise God Amen that's how you get the Revival back amen hallelujah that's how you do it we can't be lured away into Temptations we got to stay true to God's word that brother Ram goes into the the system the Roman Catholicism he said they're the mother of harlots and all the Protestants are daughters by Creeds and organizations brother man said Delilah kept wooing Samson remember day after day tell me your secret tell me your secret tell me your secret he said Delilah kept wooing him and made love to him until he gave in she took his secret from him and the same thing happened to the church he said at the Nicene Council 325 where idolatry came back in the church remember Constantine gave him all those he gave him all these uh buildings all these temples but yet there's Idols in those temples and the church let idolatry get right back into their into their lives yeah remember the history on that the real Believers weren't a part of that Council amen they were protesting that Council Hallelujah amen now look what brother says now some of you may be surprised at this I made a video about this a couple years ago got some slack for it but that's okay I don't mind people slack I don't mind people's but brother Adam said the mother heart of the Roman Catholic church wooed the church and shaved all the rights away from the church yes he said and he said this was prophesied and he said the prophecy was that brother Ram gave was in 1933 where uh the woman would have what would rule the nation and in this servant brother said it's not a literal woman it's the Roman Catholic Church Hallelujah right so many people think it was Kamala Harris or whatever but brother Adam said in this sermon he said it's not a woman it's the church he said that was a pair to Delilah wooing Samson the Roman Catholic Church wooed all the Christians to unite with the Catholics they're still doing it anybody that says that Pope is a Spirit-filled man they've got a wrong Spirit on them that's right that man's got an evil spirit on him that's right saying it's okay for homosexuality and okay for all these War all this all this uh sin it's not right Hallelujah and we can't we'll never buddy up with those people right we'll pray for them we'll be kind to them but we'll tell them the truth and we'll draw a line in the sand this is as far as I go Hallelujah if you invite me in I'll preach to you but I'm not inviting you to preach in our church Hallelujah I'll go on your ground right to declare the gospel but I'm not letting you give us a message the church said amen amen hallelujah know where we stand brother said the Roman Catholic Church is Delilah ruling the wooing the Pentecostals back into Fellowship he said how could a born-again church submit to the Roman Catholic Church they couldn't but the man said these uh these preachers seek a lld or doctorate degree he said but that's not how you become a preacher you've got to wait until power comes from on high just like Acts chapter 2 praise God he said what's the qualification of a Preacher he said it's not a fellowship card he said a fellowship card can't produce the Holy Ghost Hallelujah amen Glory remember the ram said Samson realized where he was standing he said and we must think what we must be by the Bible and program says these words he said a humble reverent Spirit-filled people look at that humble reverent Spirit-filled people that's why I said I believe that's what we are amen we're not the denomination brother man's rebuking we're not the church that's sold out we're not married to Roman Catholicism when was the last time I tried to offer you a uh prayer beads and say well sister who won't you pray to Mary why don't you try this Hail Mary I said pray to Jesus said I said you tell me pray to Jesus brother Jesse right we haven't yoked up with these people we're separate from them but we're a small Church we're a small church that just desires Revival Hallelujah we're a small church that wants more mechanics and more Dynamics Hallelujah because we go through battles we go through trials we just want restoration we want Revival hallelujah we're not joined with the Roman Catholic Church we're not a part of a curse of nomination but we can relate this answer because there's times we should be strong but we're weak instead and God is gracious just like he was to Samson Hallelujah hey man but man said Samson's hair started to grow out again and he cried out to God he cried to the Lord that's what we need today crying out to God Amen that's exactly right brother said Samson's hair grew out again and he said Revenge my eyes and then he said Samson thought perhaps there's a possibility Jehovah is full of love forgiving the iniquity of generations perhaps he would send the power and forgive me just once more amen I love it praise God our sins got us in trouble but it's God's love that leads us to repentance Hallelujah [Applause] he's the god of Grace Hallelujah said people today are satisfied to go along with the same Trend in other words they don't want to pray the prayer that Samson prayed they're just let's go along with it we'll get ready to die let's retire get ready to die instead of crying after God and say God what's more give me dreams for healing praise God help me to cast out Devils Hallelujah whatever you call me to do revive it again do it again all things are possible I want to die to all my sins Hallelujah because that's what it is for us it's not dying physical dying we don't want to die until it's God's time what we want to do is die out as Paul said I Die daily praise God that's what we need I've been encouraged the last two weeks some people have come up and said I want to be more dedicated and I want God to use me more how many want God to use them more and right and we have to remember our covenant we've got to remember brother said seven locksmen means seven Church ages right Covenant with God Hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ the seven Church ages the Covenant of the blood of Jesus Christ he said I make a new testament a new testament in my blood Hallelujah amen but Ben said God doesn't have grandchildren he said just because you were raised in Pentecostal church he said people got used to that now look he makes a statement he said you have to pay the same price that the others paid now that that's what's so amazing about the Holy Ghost it's called a gift but then the Bible said God only gives it to the people that obey him right yes amen right yeah so so the easiest thing to do is take it back to Joshua that promised land was a gift but they had to believe the promises right they had to obey what Moses said they had to obey what Joshua said they had to pay the same price Hallelujah see the Holy Ghost is a gift as long as you and it will it always is and you just have to obey what God Said he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him oh it's a beautiful balance whether I have to ask these questions where is God proving Hebrews 13 8 I want God to do it right here Hallelujah I want you know your I want William to email me and say how's it going I want to say brother William Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he moved today in service praise God Amen or your your dad or your mom or your somebody you know your your uncle and somebody that you can say Jesus Christ is the same praise God you know they'll say our church is going through politics and we're trying to let homosexuals in but we'll say God is moving God's forgiveness of our sins he's saving Souls he's Healing The Sick he's speaking in tongues he's prophesied he's doing Miracles he's doing Divine Healing he's the surgery the thoughts and tests of our hearts amen he's given us dreams and prophecies he's foretelling US future events amen oh man Randy God where is God proving Hebrews 13 8. I told this brother amen God was doing so many wonderful Miracles right around 2010 11 and 12 because that's when cam preached this sermon at our church was 2010. and once you preached out I wet my my web I wept at the altar I said I'm going to preach more on the supernatural then we started seeing that's when my wife got healed of the migraines Miracle after Miracle after Miracle after miracle Hallelujah Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever where is God doing that so I know there's times and seasons for everything and I want to preach faith well Ram said Samson had the same ideas Gideon Gideon said if God's with us where's all the Miracles Hallelujah that was one of the sermons God blessed me the most anywhere I preached in this whole entire world this few places I've gone that's the sermon God has anointed more than any other sermon I've ever preached if God is with us where's all the Miracles Hallelujah that's a scriptural question to ask where's his miracles everybody said that's what a Christian asks it's not a bad thing to ask that it's a good thing to ask that because it makes you hungry for Supernatural moves of God amen amen Hallelujah program said Samson prayed right Lord let me die with the Enemy and there's a possibility that a prayer meeting might spark Revival brother Brown said Samson had to die to his enemy in order to get the power back everybody said we have to die to our enemy that's got us bound I'm talking about if we're battled if we're struggling if we like Reverend said in the sermon if you let the cares of the world in too much you get bound up by them yeah yeah and then you're worried about all these natural things which we got to take care of them but we shouldn't worry about them right right we gotta overcome we gotta trust God and we got we got to overcome the cares of the world and we got to have faith in God we got to have mechanics and we got to have Dynamics praise God said Samson prayed the right prayer and he said a prayer meeting Samson thought that might might spark my Revival Hallelujah oh it's a beautiful dog but Amanda said Samson knew what would happen if God answered his prayer he knew it would mean death Hallelujah so church we don't need a whole Revival of like nobody's born again or nobody's saved or word denomination we don't need that we need a Revival of our minds that's what we need today how many can say Amen that's what we need we need a Revival like Abraham and Sarah needed a Revival yeah after 24 years they shouldn't believed so God had to come inside himself and discern the thoughts and tense of their heart said I will visit you again I will give you a body change Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit I believe is here today to tell us that we can have our first love back we can be on fire for God we can have the Dynamics we can't have the dynamic mechanics we can have both of them and this car can run for God Amen I've always used the illustration of a car you got to have a spark and you gotta have the gasoline and all the mechanics you got to have all that together praise God and then God's Great vehicle can drive down the highway Holiness praise God now why does the sermon so much to me and I shared this with sir last year on August 11 2007 2007. brother Brooks dedicated our first tiny little building which you all sat in you did too yeah some of you didn't because you weren't born yet there's preach the dedicated dedication he preached from this quote and he used this quote but the man said he said if we could only stop like Samson did and think for just a moment of what we're supposed to be by God's Bible not keeping up with the Joneses he said not the shiniest biggest church and brothers read this he said we would be better off if we stood down at the alley in a storeroom and have the spirit of God back on us again the program said brother Jesse that's your church amen you're not some big fancy building we were behind the alley we were back behind the alley and that's exactly what it was and brother uh brookson said to top it off he said that was preached on your birthday brother Jesse that's what this is November 17 1963 right on my birthday my brand said you'd be better off if you're down with the alley and have the spirit of God on us that's all we've got Hallelujah we've got the spirit of God I've proved it we prove it on Sunday morning the spirit of God moved upon those men and women and brought them up to the altar weeping and crying saying we want the spirit of God here we want the spirit of God now we've got it but we got to ask for more of it praise God hey man there's more for our church to be restored to him we don't have as much power as we like to see right we want to we want to live more separated to God we'd like to have more testimonies to go share to others that Hebrews 13 8 is right in our church amen not because of what we've done but because of God's grace because we believed the Nazarite vow we've kept the Nazareth out brother the live by every word that proceeds on the mouth of God we're living according to the message of the hour that's why this sermon means so much to me and that was the same night that brother Brooks and I were walking after the service and sister Karen Sanders was there and she said I gotta talk to you brothers and she she started screaming and shouting thus saith the Lord and gave a word from Brother Brooks gave a word to brother Brooks and earlier that morning she wasn't here she was Earth that morning she was still in Lima she hadn't driven across the state and early that morning brother Brooks and I went to The Gorge and we were talking brother Brook said I feel a burden to this I feel a burden to that I need to do this and that's exactly all those things he said was exactly what the Holy Spirit told Brother Brooks and I was a witness so in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established amen so that was a supernatural day that was a supernatural moment and that's why this uh sermon means so much to me I looked in my notes I couldn't find where I'd ever preached just once more Lord so you get this for the first time here now where's Revenge he said Revenge me in my eyes where's revenge in the New Testament go to Second Corinthians 7. verse 10 second Corinthians 7 10. have you got your Bible just turned every good for you turn some pages before we pray I've been preaching 40 minutes now I'm going to try to close here preach a 45-minute sermon brother for tomorrow that don't happen too much now don't happen because I want to make a little more time to pray it ain't even 8 45 yeah I like I'm sorry 745 I want to stop at 7 45. yes we can ask for Revenge but it's revenge for what our fa our failures have done not revengeful let me get my dad back who divorced my mom or let me get revenge on that person at work who said it evil about me no no no no no revenge against our own failures Hallelujah menu second Corinthians 7 10 for Godly sorrow worketh repentance to Salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death bless you verse 11 for behold this so same thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly sword what carefulness what clearing of yourselves yay what beer yay what vehement desire yay what Zeal yay what revenge in all things you have approved yourself to be clear of this matter see Paul says when you really repent you want revenge against your last failure you don't want to fall to that again you want to prove to yourself amen you want to prove yourself and anyone that saw your Valor especially God and the evil spirits you want to prove to them that you've got real repentance and that Godly sorrowhead you're sorry for it's worked in your heart and now you're ready to be different praise God that's the Revenge of Samson in the New Testament amen amen because I'm looking at Samson Hallelujah I'm looking at the New Testament Church I'm looking at the mighty Church of God hallelujah the church teaches keeps marching on Hallelujah the truth will keep marching on amen I go to chapter 10 verse three second Corinthians 10 verse three there's two times the word revenge is used in the New Testament these two same man same book just a few chapters later three chapters later I'm sorry no yeah three chapters verse three second Corinthians 10 verse 3 second Corinthians 10 verse 3. for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imagination and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing in captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge what all of our disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled amen Amen in other words I'm going to get revenge against the sin nature that's inside of me I'm not going to say that again I'm not going to do that again I'm not going to think that again I'm going to overcome but it's got to be in your prayer like Samson said avenge my eyes they took my eyes right because of his own fault it was his own fault he couldn't blame anybody else he could say oh it's a pastor's father Deacon's song leader it was his fault praise God yeah yeah so he said avenge me of my eyes and the Bible says hallelujah the Bible said Jesus gives us I Salve so he can see so our eyes are open we can understand the truth we can see the situation the right way and then we can get revenge Upon Our disobedience and we can live different we can live higher the next time we can have both mechanics and Dynamics praise God and you remember in judges 16 30 Samson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all of his mind and the house fell upon the Lords and upon all the people that were there and so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life all things work together for them that love the Lord praise God it looks like his life would end in Failure but he stayed true to God he called out to God he said just once more Lord do something great may this work out so I can still be in the Hall of Fame of Faith amen Lord I serve you into pure heart but I got cold I got vaccine Revenge those mistakes and may I glorify you may I fulfill your purpose for my life let's say to our feet praise God he fulfilled the calling of God through death and that's why we Must Die daily a musician can come I'm going to read romance prayer as he closes the service this was in New York he said Lord Jesus Great Master Of Life The Shepherd of the sheep come forth Lord these people are hungry gotta be hungry and thirsty for the power of God so you can't sit there and just you know I can't sit here and just be quiet like Lord maybe send your power tonight you've got we got to call it out to God for it I can't be the only one praying right it's got to be everybody Samson had to cry to God for it he said they're thirsting Lord years I've waited to see this happen maybe it will just once in our Lord one more great move of the spirit One More Time Lord and the church might receive the rapturing faith to go in now he's hoping the Rapture would take place granted Lord make known that you are with us and we will praise him for it in Jesus name we ask you he says then he says amen then he says I know it's not many words I know it ain't a long prayer but he knows my objective I mean it which means I meant it can Jesus live among us tonight now that's a good question can Jesus live here tonight of course absolutely because he's also living right here too but we like to see when he comes out and he lives amongst all of us and he answers prayer and he heals the sick and he discerns our hearts and he helps us in significant ways where where brother Jesse want to write down here's another testimony amen I wrote that testimony down from Sunday where the Pastor said like I told you somebody been encouraging you got to get them to speak in tongues and the people don't want to speak in tongues and he said Lord we just need to we just need the the true teaching on the spirit of God being born again and there it come he said it just flowed out of there amen that's what Jesus said he said open up your mouth and the word of God will come out like Living Waters praise God Amen he says can Jesus live among us tonight can Jesus once more come to us and show that he's the same yesterday today and forever as we've been taught aren't you glad you've been taught the truth I'm so glad I'm so glad I've been taught the truth Jesus Christ is the same yesterday yes he said is there sick or Afflicted or downcast and here look at that downcast anybody come to church a little downcast he said that you know there's no prayer cards out he said but believe God would raise your hand say I'm in need brother random I pray God that he will speak to me he said a man can say anything unless God vindicates that then it's wrong he said now you believe and he goes into his prayer line he has no prayer cards he just starts Discerning he calls people out like I said he starts he starts seeing people's names spelling them quickly not not something like oh like they say he was wearing like an earpiece oh repeat that again I didn't hear was that an F or a g what was that a bunch of nonsense look what he preached he preached the water baptism in Jesus Christ's name he keep the whole He preached the Holiness he preached the mysteries of God hallelujah he preached the power of God he preached against the nomination and riches and all these things that was a true man of God it was a visitation of the son of man hallelujah oh just listen to that sermon you'll hear it praise God it's a visitation of the son of man let me see if there's anything else I want to say I hope this was a help tonight here by God's grace just once more Lord just once more Lord and I pray that how many times we pray that with Jose and God every time we seem like every time we pray it seems like not every time it seems like every time we pray we say Lord we just need one more healing God comes around and heals our brother Hallelujah such a blessing let's bow our heads here that was a uh 49-minute sermon friends not too bad for an old preacher Hallelujah we're so glad Jesus Christ is the same yesterday yes today and forever I'm looking for that line again there these are people hungering these are people thirsting he said I'm in need brother Branham I pray that God will speak to me praise God let's have a word of prayer Hallelujah I said I want to preach less and pray more I certainly preach less here I usually preach the eight o'clock [Music] I want to preach faith I want to preach Miracles I want to preach just once more Lord friends we are not this denominational Church we're not the ones not even close everybody here lives a Godly holy life when you make a sin what do you do you confess it but you go through battles and we need encouragement the best encouragement I've ever found is in God's holy word right here and if God had mercy on Samson God has mercy on you and I we've got better promises better Covenant [Music] Church none of us have done like Samson and all these people murdered all the all the times with Delilah immorality broke his vows all these things what I encourage you is trying to say you and I have Grace tonight we've got to hunger and thirst foreign this is what brother cam preach he said that quote he said there's a possibility that a prayer meeting might spark the Revival again I love that it's always meant so much to me possibility it's possible we're still here we don't want to be a denomination we don't want to live in sin we want to live holy there must be a possibility for God to move again I'm going to say let my let my desires die and let Christ live in me that's why I love that song so much as we Bring Me Back To Life let it be not Jesse Smith Living but let it be Christ in me living put your name in there let us have a word of prayer father God we thank you for tonight Lord I've stopped short I'm gonna have a time of prayer Lord we want the people we want myself we all got a battle we've got to battle the cares of the world Lord we want to hunger and thirst for your righteousness Lord I Thank you for the mechanics Lord God I believe that's part of my gift there is a gift of teaching there is a gift of pastoring Lord and we are grateful for the mechanics Lord God it's produced holy lives your Bible even says if you don't have the right Doctrine you don't even have the father and the son so we thank you for the uh the mechanics of the word of God but Lord we have a desire for the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit as I was telling brother amen how I'd like to see a paralyzed person walk how he would desire to see the dead raised a prophecy go forth foretelling something and it come to pass exactly as it would be Lord we desire the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost Lord God for Lord we've got to be in position we got to find your will Lord God we've got to seek for Revelation more than anything else dear God hallelujah Lord if we find ourselves like Samson going around and around as a slave to sin may we confess it may we ask for Mercy now Lord God oh Lord have mercy Lord God hallelujah Samson was willing to die to get the power of God back in his life Lord may we be willing to to die out to sins and cares of the world that the power of God might rest upon us Lord God granted Lord Jesus foreign we thank you Lord God thank you for thy mercy thank you for thy Grace in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] thank you
