[53:41] just like Rebecca did she has a veil
[53:43] over her face to meet Isaac she has no
[53:46] more head
[53:46] Isaac's her head and the church ought to
[53:49] be so submissive now so submissive to
[53:53] the Word of God that it fails its own
[53:55] face it doesn't want its rights anymore

[54:37] voices not according to this word now I
[54:39] never be so close to deceive the very
[54:41] elect amen
[54:42] but there's a voice that always
[54:43] coincides with this word and my sheep
[54:46] hear my and another though why because
[54:50] where they follow - they're followed to
[54:51] the place that God intended for them to
[54:53] be the bride of Jesus Christ ready
[54:55] waiting for rapture full power full the
[55:02] supernatural yes Amen the supernaturals
[55:05] real sights of God amen we should shoot
[55:07] me something that's foreign to us to see
[55:10] the supernatural move how do you say
[55:12] that read the book of Acts that's right
[55:17] what are we supposed to rewrite the look
[55:20] of X was a supernatural an operation
[55:21] absolutely yes well that was only that
[55:25] was only apostles no that was every one
[55:27] of them what was Stephen I love Steve I
[55:30] preached on Stephen II reason that's
[55:32] King get out of it
[55:32] Stephen wasn't an apostle right but he's
[55:36] very life matched the word
[55:39] look at it go back and read it starting
[55:42] in chapter 6 of Acts go back and read it
[55:43] what did he do he was full of the Holy
[55:45] Ghost signs and wonders was following
[55:48] him and he they lied on him
[55:51] made false witness of him I persecuted
[55:54] him and what did he say at the very end
[55:58] the whole scripture the worst chapter 7
[56:00] he took them and revealed to them Jesus
[56:02] up to that point
[56:04] amen and then he said Father forgive
[56:07] them exactly matching the word that's
[56:11] the place of eternally thanks of God we
[56:16] should accept anything less than that we
[56:17] should match the Word of God line upon
[56:19] line I can't do that you're right
[56:23] you can't do that but they're greater is
[56:25] he that is within me oh he's so undoing
[56:29] it
[56:30] yield yourself to the voice of God yield
[56:32] yourself to the Word of God
[56:34] yields your time for the Spirit of God
[56:36] for Supernatural change you yes what is
[56:47] it

[56:51] does he do that government of the
[56:53] shoulder here in the church age book
[56:54] there he says when the bride is seen
[56:56] community gu2 committed to the groom
[56:59] there's a lot of halfway committal
[57:01] around this message of the hour we're
[57:03] just going to spray track now there's a
[57:05] lot of halfway Camille's they know about
[57:07] the Prophet they know they can't get
[57:08] away but they haven't really given their
[57:10] all to God praise the Lord
[57:14] saints of God coming to your position
[57:15] there's such freedom there's such
[57:17] Liberty there suit beauty such beauty
[57:25] raise the Lord
[57:26] commit it to the groom she takes off her
[57:28] veil and places it over the groom's
[57:30] shoulder signifying that not only is she
[57:31] under his Dominion that she's
[57:34] transferred her rights to him that he is
[57:37] the head but also that he bears the
[57:39] responsibility and the care and he alone
[57:42] no one else nor the man no other power
[57:46] has any right and responsibility oh he
[57:53] wants to do their hey man hey man you
[57:55] say you know girl that I've done that
[57:57] once but man I'm talking less the

[58:08] god I failed the Lord I'm coming harder
[58:10] I'm gonna give it more give it my all
[58:16] even there's a humbling that needs to be
[58:19] done in this giving Christ his position
[58:21] and when there's a dying up to self that
[58:23] needs to happen a little bit more yes
[58:25] yes brother Matt's praying that he dies
[58:27] out a little bit more yes I believe John
[58:30] the Baptist did the same thing I must
[58:33] decrease our thoughts our desires our
[58:40] once we still got them and we need to
[58:43] die out a little bit more amen there's
[58:45] more I'm expecting the same things that
[58:48] happen in the book of Acts to be flowing
[58:49] from our churches no going to any person

[59:31] times we come from a humble humble
[59:32] beginning but sometimes we get a little
[59:34] handy and high-minded how do you know
[59:36] that brother Matt look your brother Saul
[59:38] King Saul yeah he was a humble being
[59:42] read back through it he was hiding
[59:44] amongst the stuff when they when they
[59:46] called him out he was hiding from his
[59:48] position I believe it's a First Samuel
[59:51] 11 I was looking a lot but I was in
[59:52] there in that in that very moment right
[59:55] there he won his first victory and when
[59:57] he won his first big tree there were
[59:59] ones that didn't want salt to be king
[1:00:01] hey man they didn't want him to be king
[1:00:03] so they made they said we don't want him
[1:00:05] to be king but when he won his first
[1:00:06] victory the others called out said let's
[1:00:08] kill him and soul today there'll be no
[1:00:09] killing today because salvation let's
[1:00:12] come to the house of the Lord
[1:00:14] that was Saul but look worse
[1:00:17] all got to the place because he forgot

[1:01:44] message why because that same person
[1:01:47] that received that message fed on that
[1:01:48] message and it changed them from glory

[1:20:39] got the place ready already you might be
[1:20:49] the one that preys but you might be the
[1:20:54] woman yes sir yes sir the by my shoulder
[1:21:01] joint is out of joint I don't work right
[1:21:03] but when this body comes in this place

[1:22:11] hey-ya or so listen no
[1:22:16] so these flutters over the room so it's
[1:22:19] big angle the vamps at one place is 14
[1:22:21] wing walking foot wingspan I could be
[1:22:23] wrong here but he's big wheeze yes sir

[1:22:29] foot seven this before but this eagle
[1:22:37] comes over this this butter to give you
[1:22:44] think of it's bird it's like it gets
[1:22:51] uncomfortable I'm gonna never send the
[1:22:53] service and that pretty walk down into
[1:22:55] your few and begins to blow all over you
[1:22:57] he doesn't know you from Adam he don't
[1:23:00] know who you are but he walks right down
[1:23:02] into your Pew who is that that's the
[1:23:04] Holy Ghost
[1:23:05] the wind of the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:23:07] that wind of the Holy Ghost you know
[1:23:09] what it begins to do maybe almost
[1:23:14] something goes alright this equals
[1:23:26] better even stuck in this yes yes so the
[1:23:29] evil begins to realize why does the
[1:23:48] Eagle do this because she sees the true
[1:23:51] potential in the limit she knows the
[1:23:54] little eagle is built just like she is
[1:23:58] how do you she knows something illegal
[1:24:01] in do exactly what she does the work
[1:24:03] should I do you do oh it's high up here
[1:24:16] I don't know I'm here to tell you if
[1:24:18] Papa God knows if that spirit come he's
[1:24:22] ever had
[1:24:22] happened in church mother Jessica on a
[1:24:24] subject man and he just won't get off of

[1:24:37] be dead
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:41] you ever have somebody step on your toes
[1:24:43] yeah those steps on your toes if the
[1:24:50] wind comes home and blows you that winds
[1:24:54] me notice an eagle dude it learns to
[1:24:58] mounted sweet
[1:25:00] it doesn't flop no mmm praise this is
[1:25:20] why why does the mother say I don't like
[1:25:22] the bit better your saints of God
[1:25:23] sometimes that comes that way because
[1:25:25] there's a besetting sins sitting in our
[1:25:27] life there's things in our life that we
[1:25:28] should not be doing we know better than
[1:25:30] do and we still hold on to amen praise
[1:25:33] the Lord but Matt included amen
[1:25:40] you don't look at this man up here like
[1:25:41] he's something big special yeah they're
[1:25:43] their position they have a place but
[1:25:45] they're walking the same walk you do
[1:25:46] they've been sometimes they're
[1:25:48] struggling just as hard as you do and
[1:25:49] still have to stand up here behind the
[1:25:51] pulpit and give everything they've got
[1:25:52] to God they don't feel like I don't want
[1:25:55] to amen but the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:25:57] the anointing comes down and then God
[1:25:59] just takes over the saints of God
[1:26:07] he's blowing applause he's saying these
[1:26:13] feathers will not take you interruption
[1:26:15] these feathers will harm you from
[1:26:18] playing sometimes we're so earthbound
[1:26:20] yeah when we were when we were in school
[1:26:22] I came up with these things in
[1:26:23] parachutes and you ran with a parachute
[1:26:26] on it well they put away the best on you
[1:26:28] jumped that it was harder to run that
[1:26:31] parachute right but I tell you when you
[1:26:33] got that person off
[1:26:35] you felt light is a bit when you got
[1:26:38] that weight off yeah he felt light as a
[1:26:40] feather and God sends the Holy Ghost
[1:26:42] down when he blows on you and you say
[1:26:45] know what I'm sorry
[1:26:46] and God blows things out of your life
[1:26:49] that's why we don't per se yeah even so
[1:26:52] much more than a approaches why because
[1:26:54] there's more oppression coming tables
[1:26:56] coming right things we got a fight but
[1:26:58] yours are safe in this is our comfort
[1:27:00] zone by the time the song service over
[1:27:11] the word says Amen and the preacher big
[1:27:13] news to come something change amen yes
[1:27:32] Laurie spreadeth abroad or wings so the
[1:27:37] single think about this the seagull

[1:27:56] the wings of the old and new Testament
[1:27:58] the wings weren't here were abroad yeah
[1:28:04] you know I think it's in songs that Doug
[1:28:07] David talks about feathers all those
[1:28:08] fenders that every one of those
[1:28:09] scriptures you know an eagle they can't
[1:28:11] pry those about it good the pliers
[1:28:13] there's some patent when you see the
[1:28:22] revelation of who he is and how big he
[1:28:25] is and how much he cares you I don't
[1:28:27] know if it does some of you but it puts
[1:28:28] me in comfort to know my God's got
[1:28:30] everything under control
[1:28:32] oh my god soft bit the David fell amen
[1:28:36] because he knew I needed to see somebody
[1:28:38] that wasn't perfect he's all fit I saw
[1:28:41] Jacob and a grace yes
[1:28:44] amen he saw that there were things in
[1:28:46] the scriptures that gave me

[1:28:50] short my god still is better he knew I
[1:28:58] needed a new idea to think he's covered
[1:29:00] he knew I need a transgression

[1:38:15] something but you know that's how God
[1:38:17] the church if you do not suffer you will
[1:38:21] not win think about David how many never
[1:38:25] you might need this place right now
[1:38:26] think about David running from soul
[1:38:30] thinking what did I do wrong
[1:38:32] how many stopped this why am I going
[1:38:34] through this sure sure what did I do
[1:38:36] wrong
[1:38:36] right David had to go through that 42
[1:38:40] the way he had to go through suffering
[1:38:44] before he was fit to be Mackey
[1:38:50] gives a different perspective to where
[1:38:52] you're at right now doesn't it you think
[1:38:54] God isn't working on you I was telling
[1:38:56] brother Jesse right now just a few
[1:38:58] minutes ago about Moses Moses when he
[1:39:01] came to the backside of the desert
[1:39:03] they just said he went to the backside
[1:39:05] desert and then 40 years later this
[1:39:06] happened look at God work on Moses
[1:39:12] because by the time God came to him in a
[1:39:14] burning bush Moses had a speech
[1:39:17] impediment Moses had seven weaknesses
[1:39:20] brother branham said all right
[1:39:22] he knew human weakness I can't do it I
[1:39:24] have no message I have no eloquence I
[1:39:26] have all these things but right there he
[1:39:29] was at perfection in the sign of God

[1:39:57] come into our place
[1:39:58] you know Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 it
[1:40:02] talks about the fivefold ministry
[1:40:03] let me just read through these
[1:40:04] scriptures here and he gave some
[1:40:09] apostles and some prophets some
[1:40:11] evangelists some pastors and some
[1:40:13] teachers we need all what's it for
[1:40:18] for the perfecting of the Saints without
[1:40:22] a fivefold ministry according to the
[1:40:25] Bible
[1:40:26] there's no perfecting how many once at
[1:40:31] all pray for pray for your pastor pray
[1:40:38] for the teacher pray for the evangelist
[1:40:41] pray for him because they go out and
[1:40:45] they do work you know what it's doing
[1:40:47] it's bringing your brothers and sisters
[1:40:49] it's bringing the body into the
[1:40:51] perfection that we take a rapture no
[1:40:55] bigger than anybody else they're called
[1:40:57] to serve amen
[1:40:59] that's what they're called to do but by
[1:41:01] they're serving God works
[1:41:03] and brings his bride into maturity for
[1:41:10] the works of the ministry for the
[1:41:12] edifying of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:41:13] listen till we all come in unity of the
[1:41:18] faith this is our position and of the
[1:41:22] knowledge of the sun-god until a perfect
[1:41:25] man to the measure of the stature of the
[1:41:27] fullness of Christ
[1:41:29] now we henceforth be not children tossed
[1:41:33] to and fro carried about with every wind
[1:41:35] of doctrine by the sleight of men and
[1:41:37] cunning craftiness II but speaking the
[1:41:43] truth in love may grow up into him in
