childhood you know we had always our little church on Wednesday night before Christmas our little church our Pentecostal church would go do caroling to all the houses for like an hour too and so we would sing all those songs and I got good memories about singing about Jesus so I thank the Lord for that I like to look at Luke 2:14 and I'd like to continue this little series on purpose we started at last New Year's Eve December 31st 2018 so I got quite a ways to go I think still on this series by God's grace but this is part 32 is that right 30 32 okay thank you 32 so we're looking at glory to God in the highest that's kind of like my subtopic glory to God in the highest Luke 2:14 [Music] this morning as we open gifts and we read all of Newton or Matthew chapter two and then a lot of Luke chapter two a very familiar story beautiful story humbling story and as I was preparing over the last few days I've just thought about verse 14 so I like to look at glory to God in the highest let's read that verse together Luke 2:14 ready one two three glory to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men let's have one more word of Prayer if we can hear by God's grace let's just invite the presence of Lord again and go closer into our hearts and minds heavenly father Lord we love you we invite you Lord into our thoughts and minds Lord and we thank you how the the words of the Lord and the music Lord and the songs that we've heard Lord has cleared our hearts and minds Lord and just come a little closer now Lord and let the word as its preached may give us life as we looked at a few weeks ago Lord God how the word brought life Lord and father to strengthen our hearts and lives thank you for blessing us on Sunday with the word that I know it helped my prayer life Lord God and to have more confidence when I pray Lord God and thank you there was a timely word and so father I pray the same tonight Lord be a timely word bless your people those physically who press their way out to the house of God Lord ministered to us here those that are watch it later or livestream minister to them as well and or we're reminded the scripture Lord God that says gather the more as you see that day approaching Lord God and that we all might come into the faith Lord God and so father bring us all into that one faith Lord God let us mature and overcome Lord God and let's be Lord brought to the fullness of the stature of Christ for each measure Lord for our lives Lord let us manifest your glory as we look at this thought tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you being seated praise God so when look at glory to God in the highest and I want to look at this little thought of bringing God glory as the Lord will help us here I hope you were blessed by Sunday's meetings I know my prayer life was much better I went you know before I prayed on Monday morning I went to my computer and typed out all those verses that he mentioned and then I was praying off of that sheet for the last few days I really enjoyed that that's why I love I love when I get a message and I can apply right to my life because that that scripture you know and in first John about we know he hears us if we ask according to his will that that to me is the foundational scripture for prayer right because Jesus you know says ask anything and I'll do it well that's not true for that's true but it won't it's only true if we ask a chord in his will so to me that was a scripture had to re re-emphasize there my prayer life is we have confidence when we ask according to God's will and so that really helped me you know what I'll just say it like this you know there there's a there's things there's times and seasons we all go through you know where it seems like God's really close and a lot of prayers to be an answer but then there's times where it seemed like you know the Lord is far away but he promised to never leave us or forsake us and so I guess I just been going through like a little quiet season where I feel like doesn't feel like my prayers are going behind the ceiling so that serve those services really strengthened me and and and then I was as I was reading this week in the scripture I finished the book of Genesis and there's some really important thoughts I I read about I'll share tonight that really helped me and encouraged me in my walk with the Lord so I thank the Lord for that and I want to look at the glory of God how many thankful for God's glory praise God you know there's many aspects to God's glory which we'll look at I like to start with this quote here I like to I was listening to this sermon we have seen his star and have come to worship Him this is from December 16 1963 its programs Christmas message and I he takes this thought here and I just want to start with this idea for Christmas Boban was saying how remember this is all prearranged by God himself this birth of his son when it was to take place how it was when it was was all pre-arranged by God himself did you notice it had to be just at this time when the murderous King Herod nothing but a murderer killed all those little children that it might be fulfilled which was spoken the Lord by the Prophet saying in Ramah Rachel weeping for her children and they were not so see there had to be a murderous King to fulfill that prophecy that was smoked many hundred years beforehand but when God speaks a word by his prophet it has to come to pass if it's God's word no matter how long it lingers it'll still come to pass because it's a seed jesus said the Word of God is a seed that a sower sowed so it must bear its fruit in its seasons and now this murders King had come to be at that time to do those evil things he says that another thing we want to notice is that just at the very time he had to raise taxes on the people so want you to see look at the time that God sends his son he sends it at a time when there's gonna be a really evil man reigning right and then it's at a time where financially wasn't a very good time more taxes right we got a tax break thank God at least we didn't I hope you did we had our biggest tax increase last year for tax return rather he says but Jesus he said in doing that the taxes cause Joseph and his wife his espoused wife Mary to be forced back into Bethlehem but ham says God knows how to do things so even make the works of the enemy praise Him so God's you know so the world they get Herod up there this evil guy and then they all raise taxes I'll take more of their money and what what he meant for evil God ends up using for good praise God because it allowed Jesus and Mary and Joseph to have to come back to Bethlehem praise God after they had left he said when we think sometimes it's all we got into this we got to that to make the clock tick just right but God's timepiece is ticking perfectly and Jesus will be here right on time he won't be one second behind everything will happen just exactly the way God said it would so whether we do it or whether we do not do it it will be here just the same because God has spoken it will be so so that's occurring for the second coming did you catch that the first coming no matter what was happening financially or politically all the trials and and so forth Jesus came right on time so will it be at the second coming right we know the churches are going to unite together with the government they're gonna unite together it's gonna be so close in to see their very elected if it were possible but it'll happen at just the right time and Jesus will come to rescues than a life praise God before the the enemy can end up a carry out his plot that's the word that they use before the enemy can carry out his plot against the bride Jesus will come and snatch his bride away hallelujah to be right on time now he find out the taxes that Herod said all the people were straight from their birthplace must return back that he thought he was doing something great there when he done this and not knowing he was working exactly in harmony with Jehovah hey Laurey a murderous evil king God can still have that person working a harmony with God you know like I was I I sent a man a letter this week and he had sent me a copy of his book and in the book he hasn't he had said that God was evil because the Bible says that God creates light and he creates peace and he creates evil in Isaiah 45 and I said sir you got the wrong interpretation when the Bible says I create peace and I create evil it's not saying God is evil it's saying that God we'll use servants on the earth to bring judgment upon people right because judgment is evil for those who are being judged right but God will not punish the righteous with the wicked Amen that's right and so when God says I create evil what he means he uses someone like Nebuchadnezzar remember that God said Nebuchadnezzar is my servant and I'm gonna use my servant Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Israel and carry her out of the her land amen so that's what that means it doesn't mean God is evil the Bible says God is just and the Bible said in God is no darkness at all amen you'll find nothing dark inside of God is all light it is all holiness it is all love so if God's in you that'll be inside of you to me as much as you can crucify the flesh and your sin nature and the nature of the word can live out through you praise God amen thank the Lord how many of the priests probably curse Harun at that time in the name of the Lord for raising taxes brother Hansen how many sit-ups early and said all this roman if we could just get a hold him and do so-and-so not knowing it was working exactly according to God's plan he says sometimes today we curse communism and all these things like Russia right people who curse Russia he said well maybe it deserves it but if you only knew the truth it's working exactly in God's hand to do just exactly what he said it would do he's got the raise up something to take Babylon off the earth and he's got the instrument in his hands you read the scripture it's written not right here what he said he would do and if those ministers of that day had just read and studied the word they knowed that was to happen and we noticed then that this great taxation the king gave forth his rule or his order and then all people would turn to their birthplace regardless now it looks like a horrible thing I listened you sisters that poor little woman in that place that she was heavy with child and would have to take that long journey think about how hard that was on Mary any sisters ever feel sorry for her she's the Bible said she was great with child so I'm not sure how much that means if the baby was J baby Jesus was big or not or just just means she was at the end of her her pregnancy she was great with child but look it didn't really seem where they meant like everything was working out for God's glory a woman riding the back of a donkey you know and that's not very comfortable doesn't seem like it's very nice and very peaceful this is the plan of God for my life yes it was yeah and some sometimes church we think hard times really isn't the plan of God but many times hard times are the plan of God amen none of us have ever had to ride a donkey for hundreds of miles being pregnant or weighing a lot of weight extra weight on us or anything like that we've never had to suffer like that be like God let Mary suffer like that and we ever remember you know she rejoiced because the Bible said that they would say Oh hail thou are highly favored well listen she deserves some highly high favor because the suffering she did right she deserves some of that favor because she suffered in a way that many never suffer praise God glory and charge you and I we're gonna sweet suffer in different ways that other Christians don't suffer in and so god I have a special reward and that's what the Bible means when the Bible said God is going to share his glory with us it doesn't mean that we get worship but what it means is that God gives us respect praise God God says you are worthy amen hallelujah so it's not that we get worship but it means we get respect and we get other because we've done what God has asked us to do praise God because remember every promise comes with conditions Amen hallelujah that eunuch said can I be baptized and Philip said Philip said there's conditions he said if you believe with all your heart you can be baptized amen hallelujah you shall get the Holy Ghost if you repent all the way if you get sanctified then you shall receive it but every promise is based upon conditions hallelujah that's been made real to me this week as I've been studying on the book of life did you know after the golden calf church did you know after the golden calf that Moses said block me out and God said no he said he said I'll spare you but I'll blot out all those who sinned against me do you know that and then the Bible the Bible God said I'm gonna blot them out praise God and then Jesus said to all those who overcome and fire tear he said if you overcame I will not blot you out of my book and then Moses said blot me out of the book that you've written who wrote that book Jesus Christ wrote that book amen and if we're believers and we stay faithful if we keep God's conditions by His grace and we surrender repent and Angel closer to him he will not remove our name off the Lamb's Book of Life a man but he said he would that's where people get mistaken do we have eternal security yes if you're in the Lamb's Book of Life you've got eternal security amen your name can never be removed praise God but there is no secure eternal security for people like Judas right who claim to be saved and and was justified and sanctified but then they sold it out they fell away and Jesus had to obliged name off the book of life he had to off because he said he went to his own place praise God oh my that's what I love about this it gets harder Church as time goes on but the revelation becomes clearer all the time it's darker there's less people serving God more people falling away but the revelation gets greater all the time amen praise God thank you like the Lord says show me things on the soul I never knew before now the book of life and as we study all these things it just gets more clear and we get more scripture all the time gives us more time to find the truth Alleluia because that's what the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Truth he said all that poor little woman she was heavy with child would have to take that long journey today we would hardly think of taking her to ambulance right if you were pregnant if you were eight months pregnant or whatever more as sisters here you don't want to travel very far you wouldn't want to get in our ambulance and travel all that distance that's what he's sayin it was a hard travel but she had to if you had worse in Palestine scene where she come through that rugged granite boulders up through there on the back of a little mule no matter how bad it was and how cruel it seemed that was the King's orders and everybody must do it young or old prepared or not prepared they had to do it anyhow so she didn't have a choice it looks like oh god I was so pregnant how can I do this but she didn't have a choice but see God knew that and God's grace was going to be with her she might not have known it but the angels of God were protecting God saying all the way crazy God just like the age of God protect us like William as he travels and flies across the Atlantic Ocean they're just like the age of God go with us here they were with her protecting her all the way it got uncomfortable no doubt it was painful but she had to overcome amen hallelujah and each one of us got to overcome by the grace of God if we want our names to remain on the book of life right we're not the ones who know it right we don't know whose names gonna be there but we know all those who are born again their names can never be removed and they've got eternal security amen but the Bible said we don't know everything necessarily we can't prove our lesson I can't prove my name's there he said God could use me as a tool for something else but the Bible says if you're you believe your name is there that make your calling and election sure praise God that's right he says sometimes we think our burdens are so heavy there's nothing like it in the world right sometimes we get discouraged right me - Oh nobody's got it as hard as I do he said do you know all those things are for your good they are to mold you and to make you he said these things that we have today there's nothing happened to us that hasn't happened to other Christians before other Christians has had to stand in the hours of darkness like this and even be fed to lions for their testimony how hard do we really got a church you ever had to face a hungry line never had to face anything that's gonna tear you to pieces or anything like this ever had to ride on the back of a donkey for a hundred miles or 200 you know 200 miles ever long that was pregnant he says but all of our trials are molding us so we have a specific testimony you know some brother bender on when he was here he was crying I was telling him a little bit after I told him this you know he's getting a doctor to Greene he's gonna be like a professor you know he's in education and then he can write books - and he says it'll give more credibility if he's got the PhD on there he was going through such a hard trial and I said I said listen brother Ben I said I don't know any other message believer who's trying to get a doctoral degree and he's telling me all these trials you might have overheard him all these trials that have happened I said brother you just remain faithful in that I said because on the day of judgment God's gonna raise you up as an overcomer you were called to get a doctor's degree and you were calling the field of education God needs a teacher that's got the Holy Ghost amen God needs a witness amongst those doctors who think they're so smart they don't need God and here God is gonna raise brother Ben up as one who got a PhD but only trust in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I said God's gonna raise you up on the day of judgment that you could overcome with every trial that seems to fall apart and this is gonna happen that's gonna happen financial struggles all these things and he started crying he said brother Jesse I really appreciate you sharing that I say God's got to have a little pastor to raise up and say well I can do it when others fell away others got discouraged others quit I didn't quit praise God because I thought the vision and I knew that other people had been through this before there's been others who had smaller churches in mind and yet remain faithful praise God so I can remain faithful with the little God's given me because it's not me it's greater is He that's in me than he that's in the world praise God hey man so he started crying he said I really appreciate Dennison yes sir I've been telling that's a lot of people lately I forget someone else I was talking about that and they said they really appreciated that God needs a mother God needs a young mother in Akron Ohio to overcome God needs young men and women praise God God needs the youth to be able to overcome and whatever your situation is God wants you to overcome no matter how hard this other Christians have it way harder than we had but we know that mind battles are difficult we know that deception is the greatest deception but I'm saying like this we've never had to face hungry lions we've never had to ride on a donkey like nine months pregnant right so we got to remember that God's loading us and our hard trials are the motifs that we can be a testimony for God hallelujah he said don't be afraid of your testimony for Jesus Christ shed forth your light stand for your convictions that he is the son of God and this is not a night for Kris Kringle what's the birth of Jesus Christ that we're celebrating amen he said did you ever see that when they're fixing the mold of bail some famous bail for a church chime or something that had to give a certain ding you see if you're ringing a chime it takes a certain range for each Bell and it makes certain materials go in there so much brass so much steel so much other ones ores that go into this Bell and if it just if it's just straight brass it won't ring right it's got to have all kinds of materials thrown into it to make it ring the right kind of a tone and the man who has put up the mold up and set the mold he knows exactly what it takes to go into the cupola what it takes to go into that that metal to make that bell ring that tone he said God is our great cupola he's the great refiners furnace that where he has to put these things upon us trials persecutions and things to mold it together to make our testimony ring for a certain time and a certain note that he once rang out in a certain day Amen God is trying to play music today hey that guy's trying to play a song today a song that will echo in heaven and he needs our lives to play certain notes praise God and our lives have to be mixed did they take it for me it takes some a great britain and you got takes some of the from Spain and some from Portugal hey guys think 2% I'm two percent Israeli they gotta take 18 percent of Native American and God had to put it all together melt it all together to give me a certain type of testimony a certain type of character praise God a certain type of attitude a certain type of outlook a certain type of a physical build up so that God could have a certain kind of testimony praise God I'll never forget when Craig Brewer said he's a pastor now in Connecticut he said you always remember when I came to the first Bible study out of the out of the denominations he said I look like Superman because I 190 pounds I weighed a lot more than I do right now he said long hair down to here and I just looked like I was all buffing her but God needed like a athlete God need like a athlete to surrender all their all of his rights all of his options all of his worldly options God needed that a certain kind of testimony he had to get a little Native American there for speed and jumping ability he had to get a little Brit Great Britain in there for a big old nose and a big old or something ears you know huh he had to put it all together and to bring out a testimony selling day of judgment my testimony rings praise God that it rings that that Christ was able to redeem an athlete amen Christ was able to redeem this this person in this in this life and the testimony will ring and I believe it will play onward Christian soldiers amen your testimony my testimony Church will all play the great anthems of God and give God glory but we got to let the Holy Spirit strike us a little bit praise God we got a little our lives the music of our lives be played out we got to be faithful to the music that the conductor's playing amen okay say I this we got to be faithful to the sheet music praise God if the music says this and I will not complain I will not despise I will not give up I will not quit if that's what the music says we better live it out praise God amen our life has to have a certain kind of testimony and that's this this point brother Ram brings out at the me of this message he said we're all made different we see different but we all see one thing that's Jesus Christ let's look at him the only way you can see him he said if he lets contrary to this word you're not looking at him right for the word is him glory if it he said if it doesn't look at that word then look away from it look to the word and that's what we're looking for Christ the manifestation of God's Word he is the vindication of God's Word hey hallelujah praise God now let's go to Genesis I want to just show you this this really encouraged me this week you know I think about you know times we go through quiet seasons and so forth I believe it's a 48 but I could be wrong I'm just guessing because I know it's at the end of the book now who remembers how it was Joseph when he was sold in the Egypt name remember 17 17 years old who knows how old was he when he finally got exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh 30 so for 13 years they men Jacob his father thought he was dead 13 years now a challenging Church read your Bible this week or soon and see how many times God spoke to Jacob when he first left and he's running from Esau he stopped the rest he made a pillow a stone and God spoke to him and said follow me and and here's a stairs of stairway to heaven and he poured the oil and said this is the house of God God told him exactly what to do and then he gets married he's got two wives all these sugar and then God said leave and go back home and so he left he went back then God said go build an altar at Bethel and all these things so the words man he meant God was talking constantly to Jacob but then when Joseph was sold it's like God didn't talk to him anymore at least in the scripture in church for at least 13 actually 13 plus 7 for 20 years right because they had seven good years of plenty and then seven years of famine right so for at least 20 years Jacob is a prophet but a man he's heard the voice of God before he's seen angels amen he's seen that stairway to heaven my goodness and yet when it comes God why'd you up my son died the whole time Joseph is alive amen y'all thinking about that he heard from time and time again no look he's faithful in all the major decisions of his life he goes here he marries Rachel and Leah and then he goes here God sends him back he's faithful and everything that Jacob every time he hears the voice of God he's faithful may may that be our testimony every every major decision of your life and every crossroads of your life sit and wait and don't move until you've got the Duff saith the Lord and then God will take care of all the little decisions we just make sure that you answer God and obey God on the major decisions praise God like who you marry o where you live in children and where you go and all these major major decisions life-changing decisions make sure we wait upon the Lord and do what the Lord tells us to do aha that's what Jacob did but brother brother Malachi for 20 years he's like God why did you let me why did you let my son Joseph die in the whole time he never died he gets news of it at the end of chapter 45 and look at verse 27 45 27 and they told him all the words of Joseph which he is said of them and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carrying the spirit of job Jacob their father revived so this man was in the can I say like this a major depression for 20 years now they're not supposed to have we're not supposed to have favorites as children right but he had favorites he loved Joseph more than all the other months that's not right as far as I'm concerned maybe it was right back then I don't know who might be I don't think it's right today for 20 years he bound depression he cried to God God why did you take my Joseph God never took him like that little Bram said God only tells prophets what he wants them to know gory he only tells us what he wants us to know Jacobs own old man he sees the wagons of Egypt Poland he's like he's revived thank God I finally come out of this depression Church one of these days if you're in a depression God's gonna revive you hey hi-yah praise God just keep holding on to God amen just keep believing yes there's times where God seems like he's silent and he's far away but God only lets you know what he wants you to know praise God he wants to test you he wants to test your faith he wants to make sure there's a certain kind of a ring praise God hey men now tell us a lot it's a lot like job job actually lost the children though and he never cursed god that's a great test for us can we lose things that we think so dear so loving and still love God can God give and take away and yet we'll still pass the test and still say I love the Lord hallelujah amen although a minute's room into two decades of depression hallelujah he was able to hang on and he never cursed God he just battled depression for all those years but then God finally said I'm gonna I'm gonna bring the end of this I'm gonna show you what I've been hiding from you all these years hey but had to be a right time and the right things and praise God look at verse 28 and Israel said it is enough Joseph my son is yet alive I will go and see him before I die amen as hard as it was to see the the coat of many colors colored a covered in blood and years of depression and all these things and hard as it was he hang on to God he never cursed God he went through harder things than what we went through praise God but he had he never cursed God he passed the test and now there's a certain testimony that he never cursed God even though he lost his son and God can bring me on a depression amen Oh hallelujah what a testimony church that's beautiful so for 20 years this man who saw the he saw the stairway he saw angels he talked to God he heard God's voice okay moved back to Canaan okay now go go to Laban you know he was back and forth and he always heard from God for 20 years God never tells him the answer Joseph is dead joseph is dead god never tells him any different he's not dead now look Church right after he finds out look what he does now let me find the chapter think it's 46 yes coma 46 verse 1 and Azrael took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices under the god of his father Isaac so now that Joseph's alive he's I'm gonna go sacrifice to the Lord thank you lord my son's not dead and look at verse 2 and who spoke to him God 20-years god I haven't heard anything about Joseph I didn't even know he was alive and now God starts talking to him again this is what encouraged me church there's times God will seem like God's telling you things all the time right tell you this tell you this tell you this and then all of a sudden it's like going in depression I don't hear God's voice what happened and actually God lets you think the wrong thing right God let him think the wrong thing that Joseph was dead for 20 years at least 20 years and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night oh thank you Lord and said Jacob Jacob and he said here am i he said I am God the God of thy father fear not to go down to Egypt for well I will there make a V a great nation I will go down with thee to Egypt so that these major decisions of his life he leaves Canaan you know to get a wife God tells him to do that then God tells him to go back and now God saying go down into Egypt look Church we just got to be faithful with thus saith the Lord amen we're gonna make little mistakes in our little Christian life but I'm talking about in the major things when we know we've got that saith the Lord we've got to obey that praise God seen his major decisions even though God hid things from God would return thank God amen God would return and speak to him again in a night vision praise God now night vision is different than a dream a dreams when you go to sleep a night vision is why you're awake at night and you see a vision at night Alleluia notice Jacob didn't complain God why didn't you tell me for 20-some years if my son died or my son was alive God he didn't complain because this and he realized that God works all things together for good to them that love him he wasn't one to get upset with God like we've seen you know we seen people get upset with God right we're not gonna get upset with God yes we'll cry we'll be heartbroken who might depression with him when things go wrong we thought we should go another way but he never cursed God he remained faithful and then God returned and said Jacob Jacob here am i amen he said I'm going down with you I'll surely bring you up again and Joseph shall put his hand upon his eyes you know how you know how he got back Joseph had to carry his bones back that's how he got back God said I'm gonna bring you back but it's gonna be after you're dead right so look at that church for like 20 years or more he never heard anything about his son being alive in Egypt because there's times God is silent on things and it's a teach us the weight upon his plan right teach us to go through fiery afflictions and and things that seem so difficult right like marry such a difficult thing back and forth and I'm pregnant all these things so difficult taxes and then this murderous King these things seem so difficult but it all works together according to God's perfect plan glory is that okay church is that okay you see what that's why that really encouraged me 20 years he's like my son's dead and he never was dead because God doesn't tell you everything okay say like this God wants you to sweat it out sometimes you got to stuff how many if you want to reign within you got to have godly character how do you I gonna have godly character if you give up after 20 years I can have godly character well I've waited five years I waited ten years I waited twenty years I can have godly character if you can't wait thirty or forty years see godly character patience is built not by just giving you everything you want it's built by testing and stretching it praise God you make taking it further than you think you could go praise God that's how God molds genuine patience in our heart not by answering right away but by teaching us to wait upon him hmm what a Christmas message praise God Ivan got the glory to God in the highest that's where I wanted to get to thank the Lord and then here's an thought now that's forward to the New Testament Joseph I just want to just briefly hit this we don't know much about him he's a carpenter the carpet Jesus the carpenter's son he worked with wood all the time Church worked with wood that was his testimony all we know about him is that he was a faithful father a faithful husband the Bible said he was a good honest a righteous man and all we know is that was righteous he did everything right he tried to obey God the best he could but when the Lord spoke to him in a dream with thus saith the LORD now not all of our dreams are from God but when he knew that dream is from God he acted on it amen move you must leave they said name the child Jesus for her save his people from their sins aim ahead Larry so he named him Jesus that's all we know about him we know he he moved his family to Egypt and moved him back to Bethlehem to be taxed and then and then moved into Nazareth the worst place in the world why am I at this time my life I got young family why am I going to the worst low down neighborhood there is an accurate or Doylestown see sometimes why would I be in the worst low down neighborhood there ever could be well maybe it's to fulfill God's plan for your life maybe there's a poor neighbor out there that needs to know the love of Jesus Christ praise God and how they gonna hear unless God some send somebody in flesh how they gonna hear they're not gonna hear except we tell them praise God so there he goes to Nazareth can any good thing come out of Nazareth and yet God told him to do it through dreams so that's the testimony like about Joseph we use Joseph of the old and Jacob also his father and Joseph of the new all's we know is he was righteous he obeyed every time he got a major decision he obeyed he kept God's purpose for his life he didn't reject it he obeyed it when he knew it was thus saith the Lord now the hard thing for us is and no one is thus saith the Lord well what it lines up with the word right because God will always give two or three witnesses in the mouth of every witness that I'm sending the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established praise God so see Joseph it was so simple he just had to obey the Lord at every major decision in his life and he did and then remember that when I preached a few weeks ago from the time Jesus was 12 - time is 30 we don't hear nothing about him but Joseph's job after that was to give orders to Jesus to keep Jesus in subjection and of course Jesus always obeyed so probably wasn't that hard but Joseph had to tell him Jesus go to this Jesus take out the wood shavings Jesus make this for that customer go deliver this to the customer one of this this table he had to order Jesus and tell Jesus he had to keep Jesus in the subjection right and Jesus learned obedience through Joseph and that's all we know we don't know any other miracles Church from his life did Joseph ever pray for the sick I don't know but God wanted us church to hear the ring can I get a ring here now it would ring God with us the ring of josephus Joseph's life was to be able to hear thus saith the Lord and move my family there to here they'll say the Lord named the baby this to hear thus saith the Lord and stay married to Mary she is a virgin to hear thus saith the Lord and just teach Jesus and be a faithful father o God could just help us be faithful mothers and fathers amen that's the room where they Memphis that's the ring God want us to hear when we read about Joseph in the Bible just be faithful be righteous be a godly man and God will let your life ring not only here on earth but in heaven as well praise God hey man that's where a cow's Amen is heaven jesus said if you fess the if you confess the father before me he said or before men I'll confess your name before the holy angels in heaven praise God amen that was a great encouragement to me Church I'm gonna use this quote from how can I overcome I read it a few weeks ago he said they overcome the mud that was around them and packed into them stuck their head above the thing and shine for the glory of God hallelujah now I want to move into that glory of God I'll try to just preach a few more minutes here so I wanted to preach a little bit out of the Christmas story but this main thought I want to now end with I won't be able to finish it is with the glory of God what is the glory of God there's lots of different ways to say it it means splendor or brightness it means magnificence excellence preeminence dignity or grace it said the kingly Majesty which belongs to Christ as supreme ruler absolute perfection of the deity that's the glory of God thank the Lord a most glorious condition an exalted state what is God's glory it's an exalted state hallelujah the angels let's go back to Luke chapter 2 here gotcha Bible Luke 2:8 and there was in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night so that tells us it wasn't exactly wintertime because you wouldn't have farmers in a field at nighttime if it's wintertime because it's too cold and low the the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord that majesty aim that splendor that brightness amen shown around about them and they were sore afraid the brightness of God's glory that's why brother BAM said the anointing is two separate things he said you can have the anointing to bubble dance he said but then you can have the anointing it's about scares you to death there's an anointing for joy he said there's an anointing of God's presence and that makes you feel like you're gonna die verse 10 and the angel said of them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and this should be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and that's so gracious of God that God sends his glory and then God said I'm not gonna just send my glory I'm gonna give you a sign I'm gonna give you my word I'm gonna that's what I like about God he gives you word he gives you experience and it'll give you a sign to vindicate it all praise God see if it's really God's will he's gonna have his word you're gonna have an experience and you're gonna have a sign that will prove that you're in the perfect will of God amen you'll find a bay wrapped in swaddling clothes not a young child like the three wise men found they found a young child this is a babe look at this and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God they weren't praising the Shepherd's right they were praised to themselves they were praising God saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men you ever understand this church he's saying peace on earth but within two years Herod is going to slay all those hundreds of thousands of children so this wasn't just for this just wasn't just for a short term this was a long term thing right it was through Jesus's cross amen it was through the Holy Spirit that God was going to bring peace amen he was going to being free he was going to bring peace in the hearts of believers amen that wrestle with God that Ward against God God was going to bring it hearts the hearts the peace of God that they needed real peace on earth won't happen to the Millenium praise God look believers can have peace with God now oh my I thank the Lord thank you Jesus goodwill toward men glory to God so Jesus is close that star is very close right but he says the angel sing glory to God in the highest God's gonna get all the glory he said as a sign of this you'll find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes praise God you know in other words you find the word wrapped in a lot of humility praise God I found the word this hour wrapped in a little man named Simon Smith for his God is wrapped in a humble man that's how I found the message shining up all my life praise God I found it a little humble brother praise God you find that little humble church who you heard a little humble service somewhere the word was wrapped in a humble ring praise God but it was a sign it was the assign from the Angels this is where I am praise God thank the Lord what do the Angels do they like to praise God what do his servants on earth like to do his heavenly servants like to praise what do we like to do we like to praise God hallelujah so those angels do a lot of praising God remember there's the seraphim's up there saying holy holy holy all the time holy ho they just fly around saying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty all around the throne and now more angels come down and they say glory to God how do they uh praise God angels servants of God made me praise God what a reminder that angels carry the presence of God hallelujah they're saying magnificence to God in the highest hallelujah in other words they're saying praise God for he's going to redeem man the plan of redemption will bring glory to God and designed to express his glory Jesus is going to be the evidence of God's love to his people his mercy his condescension and his high regard to the honor of his law and the stability of his own government amen glory to God in the highest has at least four meanings it means the highest strains or the highest possible manner amen glory so the highest possible praise God could have is angels right and the heavenly hosts saying and glory to God a second meaning is it's among the highest among the angels of God indicating that the Angels felt a deep interest in this work and were called upon to praise God for the redemption of man in other words go to God amongst the highest most holiest of his creatures and then it also means glory in the highest in the highest heavens indicating that the praise of redemption be confined to earth but it should be spread throughout the universe hey a minute glory it also means glory to God in the highest is equivalent to the Most High God in other words glory to the Most High God and the same is saying let the Most High God be praised for his love and His mercy to his people praise the Lord thank the Lord let me say a few more things here by God's grace you know the glory and the heavens are connected all through the Book of Psalms there's two four six there's seven scriptures about the glory of God and the heavens in the Book of Psalms Psalms 8:1 Oh Lord o our Lord how excellent is thy name above all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens Psalms 19:1 the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork Psalms 5075 be thou exalted O God above the heavens let thy glory be above the earth so in 57:11 be thou exalted O God above the heavens let thy glory be above the earth he repeats it Jewish poetry does a lot of repetition Psalms ninety seven six the heavens declare is righteousness and all the people see his glory thank the Lord Psalms 108 five be thou exalted O God above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth so Lord your majesty is greater than the earth it's greater than all the heavens how can anything get greater than all those stars and all the planets out there but yet David saying your glory is greater than that praise God amen hallelujah and these angels come down and say glory to God in the highest amen these angels that live way far above the heavens they know how insignificant this little place is because they live in the presence of God amen ah and there they're praising God saying glory to God who's high above all this for sending his son Jesus Christ praise God last one Psalms 1:13 for the Lord is high above all nations and his glory above the heavens that's beautiful church isn't it how many think that's beautiful tonight oh thank the Lord see all things are for God's glory Romans 11:36 for of him so of God so from God through him so something comes from God but other things must come through God through his power and to him sometimes these are given back to God so God it's from God through God to God are all things so everything's either from God to God or through God there's three of them n to whom be glory forever amen see everything comes from God everything goes back to God everything happens through God for those who are believers so to him be glory for ever and ever amen praise the Lord I want to do a few more here just a few more scriptures here could you pull up lydia isaiah 43:7 you know this church I know this but let's just revisit it here tonight on this Christmas night Jesus when he was born the angel saying glory to God in the highest so God was supposed to be praised right when Jesus came all the praise went to God all the glory went to God and near the Bible said even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory my splendor my preeminence my praise I informed him yay I have made him that's why I wanted this to be a part of the purpose series because your purpose in life my purpose in life is to bring God glory let me go back to that definition so through your life God should get magnified God should get preeminence God should get dignity dignity and respect God should be exalted or more through our lives that's what that means glory I've created him for my glory my exaltation so see Church that's why Mary had to go through hard thing hard times Joseph in the Old Testament Joseph in the New Testament Mary on the back of a mule for all those miles why they have to go through hard things so they can turn around and give God glory give God the praise hallelujah thank the Lord hallelujah let me just do a couple more here Jesus Christ says it so plainly I'll just close with Christ things here out orbán I'll have to preach rest this on Sunday I didn't think I'd get through all of it I didn't let's close with Christ John 4:34 John 4:30 saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work what was Jesus feeding on every church service were they meant what do you think Saints what was what was Jesus hungry to do what was he feeding on we'd say oh I feed on the preaching here that's what he was feeding on he was feeding on doing the will of God my meat when I'm feeding on is to do God's will right then john 17:4 he said I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work there's the meat I finished the work which thou gavest me to do can you pull out their acacia john 17:4 somebody can see it jesus's meat was to do the will do the work of God and then how do we know Jesus glorified God because he because he finished the work that God gave him to do stay there in John 17 the case you go to verse 5 they lujah and now O Father glorify thou me with our own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was praise got less than to our feet here thank the Lord Jesus is one request he's about to die he's about to suffer the absolute worst death any human ever could suffer and he's praying and saying God I've glorified you I brought you glory I finished the work that you've called me to do now glorify me with the glory that we shared before the foundation of the world oh my when it was just God and his son can we think about that just for a moment before there was any earth before the world was ever founded it was just God in his son the events are the first thing he made was angels right just God his son and somehow Jesus that theophany body must have remembered that he had glory with the father before the foundation of the world Jesus had to bend that light that theophany that lo gasps goodness gracious it had to remember what it was like before the foundation of the world and so because he had those memories before the foundation of world he says glorify me with the glory that I had what was he asking for church he was asking help me to get through this so I can get my glorified body okay I didn't raise god amen that's what he was asking because the glorified bodies a perfected body it's a perfect he said let me go back to being in that condition because remember Jesus suffered temptation he suffered pain and heartache and headaches and bleeding but he can remember back through the spiritual part of him he can remember back and say glorify me with the glory that we before the foundation of the world that was his prayer church hallelujah so how are we gonna give God glory today do the will of God do the will of God all right musicians if you'll come by God's grace who's getting the glory today well mostly it's Santa Claus Star Wars the new movie the frozen new movie so so wicked my movie stars rock stars rap stars who's getting the glory today they are but Jesus deserves all the glory the Angels sang about it and our voices join with the Angels don't they the angels sing holy holy holy our voices sing holy holy holy as well we must give God glory praise God let's have a word of Prayer here how many Father we thank
