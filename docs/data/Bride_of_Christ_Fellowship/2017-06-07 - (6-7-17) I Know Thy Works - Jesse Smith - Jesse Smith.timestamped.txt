[23:56] let's go to Revelation chapter 2 I'm
[23:58] going to take a little break from the
[24:00] church age and I'm just going to take a
[24:02] little thought I had a few weeks ago I
[24:03] could preach on I know that I worked I
[24:07] want to look at it good works tonight by
[24:09] God's grace in Revelation chapter 2
[24:17] relationship from - let me pull this
[24:20] around your finger grace of the Lord for
[24:27] look at I know that I work so leave it's
[24:30] 2:18 revelation 2:18 up preached a
[24:33] little bit on this when we went over
[24:35] this portion here in the thigh area
[24:39] church age well as I was preaching this
[24:41] a few weeks ago something just came to
[24:42] me I just had this thought come in my
[24:44] heart say good works but works I never
[24:47] did a study on good works before to kind
[24:50] of know about I've preached on rewards I
[24:53] never really looked at good work so I
[24:55] won't look at good works tonight by
[24:57] God's grace I think it will help you by
[24:59] the grace of the Lord tell me and let's
[25:03] look at this here our relation to 18
[25:06] that's just read verse 19 why we just
[25:08] read verse 19 and then we'll read that
[25:10] together
[25:11] revelation 2:19 we get on three one two
[25:15] three I know that works and charity and
[25:19] and service and faith annihilations and
[25:23] thy works and thy last be more than the
[25:26] first let's have one more repair that
[25:28] need on your hearts make another to go
[25:30] Heavenly Father my hands up Lord my
[25:32] heart is up as well Lord God my head is
[25:35] bowed or holy reverently I come before
[25:38] you take this word break it to us Lord
[25:41] give us understanding give us
[25:43] encouragement if we need correction
[25:45] edification or God if you want to
[25:49] prophesy tonight Lord if whatever you
[25:51] have Lord just have your way Lord I was
[25:54] to be unit vessels more Jesus and father
[25:57] we're depending on you tonight over to
[26:00] use me as a vessel use every person here
[26:02] may the Holy Spirit flow through us Lord
[26:04] it would be conduits Lord channels of
[26:07] the Holy Spirit Lord you can minister to
[26:09] every heart and soul or those live
[26:11] streaming here in Ohio or perhaps around
[26:14] the world as we received messages about
[26:16] that just have that own way Lord be with
[26:19] us operate in Jesus Christ name Church
[26:22] set may God bless you can see where is
[26:24] God
[26:27] no guy if you would switch that over
[26:40] okay I just want to show this real quick
[26:42] the last month I didn't I have brought
[26:44] in new videos the last month so I'm
[26:46] working on the book of Revelation will
[26:48] do like a video series on the book of
[26:50] Revelation and so I've typed out 32
[26:53] pages I'm just going to scroll down this
[26:56] what I've been working on the last time
[26:57] to teach every chapter you know that the
[27:00] highlights of every chapter so there's
[27:02] there's revelation 22
[27:04] I get the themes of every chapter and
[27:06] then the symbols in every chapter and
[27:09] then the key revelations so like The
[27:13] Tree of Life in chapter 22 the servants
[27:15] at the throne the poor still conditions
[27:18] be that's filthy let me be filthy still
[27:21] the invitation of the spear in the bride
[27:24] just give you an idea of the warning
[27:27] about the contents of the book you know
[27:28] you don't add or take away and then I do
[27:30] the tightening of all the events in each
[27:32] chapter so I'm really excited about that
[27:35] I've been kind of inspired last month to
[27:36] do that so I got 32 pages and I just got
[27:39] to record them and then I got edited
[27:40] over the Pope and get them up
[27:42] my god Grasso let's not let you know
[27:44] that's what I've been doing in my free
[27:45] time I kind of give myself to that and
[27:48] it would be a blessing you know we're
[27:51] the only people Church that really
[27:53] understand the book of Revelation do you
[27:55] understand that no one else really
[27:56] understands and who is virgin really
[27:58] don't understand it the bride is the
[28:00] only one to understand it it's not like
[28:02] we're just guessing brother Brandon has
[28:04] told us chapter 1 2 3 and 6 are all
[28:08] ducks a the Lord
[28:09] we have enough let's say the Lord on
[28:12] that day men and if we could take that
[28:15] and then late lay that as our foundation
[28:17] let's take the Lord and tie everything
[28:19] else together that he's already preached
[28:21] we get the right idea
[28:22] and we understand that book and whoever
[28:25] keeps that book will be blessed
[28:26] Trane's God so I just want to show that
[28:28] with you haven't look working on that
[28:30] quite diligently even this week
[28:33] finish it up I just finish it up this
[28:35] morning actually when God's grace so
[28:37] let's look at this brother rod Malay bow
[28:39] from the Philippines put this new video
[28:41] out this week I thought it was perfect
[28:43] because it's what we had a preaching on
[28:45] Christ remember in Revelation 1 he's
[28:47] standing in the midst of the seven
[28:48] golden candlesticks and he's got his
[28:50] seven stars in his head member I told
[28:52] you always wanted a picture that had it
[28:53] all together he put it out do you
[28:57] understand that there's a deep colatina
[28:58] there's a deeper respond man I just
[29:01] thought that was just this week and I
[29:02] thanked and I said thank you brother
[29:03] that's what I've been looking for so
[29:06] thank the Lord for that so I had this
[29:09] song you know I want to look at good
[29:10] worse and there was 212 hits all the
[29:14] works just in the New Testament so I
[29:16] went through all those in the last week
[29:18] or two which one hit the highlights I we
[29:20] can't possibly read and threw a tooth
[29:22] out to hundred twelve full scriptures
[29:25] tonight and one tie myself too so I
[29:27] don't wear myself out just bear with me
[29:30] and enjoy the services Sunday they were
[29:34] just beautiful we need to be more
[29:37] dedicated lad was a vacation I can be
[29:40] more dedicated by God's grace but you
[29:43] want to be more dedicated because we
[29:46] know one thing God is dedicated to
[29:47] keeping his promise if we'll keep God's
[29:50] promise and do our part God will surely
[29:52] keep his part
[29:53] praise the Lord so this will you know as
[29:56] I was tell you this morning I came
[29:57] across this quote I just want to remind
[29:58] this to the church you know we can
[30:02] actually hear the voice of God tonight
[30:04] you can actually hear it could be a
[30:06] metro voice or it could be through the
[30:08] five hole ministry program said the
[30:10] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[30:12] God talking about the nominal church the
[30:14] denominational churches it is its own
[30:17] mouthpiece so God is turning on her
[30:19] he will confound her through the prophet
[30:22] and the bride and church every
[30:24] denominational pastor person I've ever
[30:26] met with they always lead confound it
[30:29] when I share the truth because it's not
[30:31] my truth it's God's truth and it always
[30:35] confounds them like they just don't get
[30:36] it or they can't see it that's what the
[30:39] bunch of the prophets said they will be
[30:41] confounded through the prophet and who
[30:44] the bride for the voice of God will be
[30:48] in her now that's where a lot of people
[30:52] are today there a lot of people don't
[30:54] believe that they just say the voice of
[30:55] God is in brother Branham on the tapes
[30:57] and that's true the voice of God can
[30:59] speak through that but brother branham's
[31:01] and the voices in her not just the
[31:05] profit but the profit and the bride can
[31:07] we see that by God's grace so that's and
[31:10] then he quotes the scripture the spirit
[31:12] and the bride say come
[31:13] so it's not just the spirit and the
[31:15] Prophet but man said it's the spirit and
[31:18] the bride because the bride is made up
[31:19] of prophet and the rest of the bride so
[31:22] I just want to say that we should expect
[31:24] to hear the voice of God here tonight
[31:26] any time a man anointed the Holy Spirit
[31:28] who's consecrated gets up here to preach
[31:31] God's Word we should expect to hear from
[31:33] God amen so I'm yielding myself Lord let
[31:36] me be a vessel that the voice of God can
[31:38] speak tonight amen I know it's helpful I
[31:41] know it's long but God is always in
[31:43] simplicity a man he's always in the
[31:45] little things so remember we did our
[31:47] text here words under text now we just
[31:48] read 19 and just a few notes we'll look
[31:51] at a little bit love is the twin so
[31:54] charity or love is between works and
[31:55] faith your brother Graham said that's
[31:58] the right place it's the only place you
[32:00] should be love should be at the heart of
[32:02] your works and at the heart of your
[32:04] service to God and the thing that I
[32:07] might was Christ saw their increase of
[32:09] works over time they didn't get less
[32:12] dedicated to God they got more dedicated
[32:14] to God as we heard this as we heard this
[32:17] this weekend by God's grace here's a few
[32:20] points I want to make I'm going to
[32:21] review the thighs here and quote they're
[32:22] just like for quotes remember we're not
[32:26] saved by works when I saved by them but
[32:29] we're created for them and perform them
[32:32] out of love and we ought to be zealous
[32:35] of good works here's what I didn't get
[32:36] for the sisters I want to show some of
[32:38] the tabatha works and then the works of
[32:41] the sisters I have the scriptures ready
[32:43] and then the Titus 2 teachers I want to
[32:46] show that we'll probably get to that
[32:48] maybe next wednesday or maybe something
[32:50] that i want to maybe finish this up this
[32:51] is probably two services I think by
[32:54] God's grace because remember church
[32:57] we're going to be judged by our works
[32:58] and works means your business works
[33:01] means your deeds
[33:02] whatever fills your free time going to
[33:04] be judged by it let me know that either
[33:07] judge for reward or judge for eternal
[33:09] life or the second death or the other so
[33:12] for the bride she's judged and she's
[33:14] just given rewards for her works but the
[33:18] foolish virgin everybody else unbeliever
[33:20] make believer
[33:20] their judge their works are actually
[33:23] going to determine whether they receive
[33:24] eternal life or whether they're cast a
[33:27] lake of fire for the second death so
[33:29] works are very important let's give this
[33:31] ought to be zealous for good works so
[33:34] one thing the church ought to be here
[33:35] tonight
[33:36] gotta be zealous to hear about good
[33:37] works right and that means you're
[33:40] eagerly desired I just want to do
[33:42] something for the Lord so we'll get to
[33:44] that here now I read this quote a few
[33:47] weeks ago the scripture patience to Ted
[33:49] where as workmanship created in Christ
[33:52] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[33:53] ordained that we should walk in it so I
[33:56] put the note on there we were created in
[33:58] Christ unto good works that God ordained
[34:01] for us to walk into there's a work word
[34:04] to walk into there's something for us to
[34:06] do so I believe that God has something
[34:09] just special that you and I are supposed
[34:10] to do nobody else can do it but you
[34:13] praise God nobody else can do God's work
[34:15] for me
[34:16] accept me I've got to do exactly what he
[34:20] wants me to do God ordained it God
[34:23] established it God prepared it Jesse
[34:26] Smith has something to do the regos have
[34:28] something to do the Grahams have
[34:30] something to do the yeas have something
[34:32] to do every true child of God has
[34:34] something to do for God amen and they
[34:37] must do it because remember if they
[34:40] don't do it if we don't do the well god
[34:42] number what happens you become a worker
[34:44] of iniquity if you don't walk in God's
[34:46] ordained works then you're going to walk
[34:48] and work some addicted you're going to
[34:50] neglect the will of God so we'll get to
[34:52] that in just a moment I will just read
[34:55] over these four quotes again just to
[34:56] remind you now works will never take the
[34:59] place of faith in God for our salvation
[35:01] but works will show forth our faith
[35:04] already placed in him good works won't
[35:07] save you but they will come forth out of
[35:09] the same life as a fruit unto the Lord I
[35:11] believe in good works even if a man is
[35:14] not saying I do good works and do the
[35:16] best he can
[35:16] what does horrible the side of God is
[35:18] for men to do evil works and then say
[35:21] they're doing the will of the Lord that
[35:24] is what the bishops and folks in the
[35:26] hierarchy of Rome are doing member in
[35:27] the fourth church age they were killing
[35:30] maiming and doing all men oh he bore the
[35:32] name Lord now this first Jesus is
[35:35] commending his children because they
[35:37] were living change lives their works
[35:39] testify to a new spear within men saw
[35:42] their good works and glorified God
[35:44] yes sir you're a Christian you're going
[35:46] to do what's right your works will show
[35:48] that your heart is right and it won't be
[35:51] something you put on for you will do his
[35:54] will and no one but God sees you and you
[35:56] would do as well even if it costs you
[35:59] your life and then I had this scripture
[36:03] just reminding that God the Father sees
[36:05] what is in secret God sees our integrity
[36:08] God sees our character how much
[36:10] character do we have how much in Tigard
[36:12] do we have how dedicated are we amen the
[36:14] father sees our dedication praise God he
[36:17] sees what's in secret he said you will
[36:24] note that love is placed between works
[36:26] and service that is the right place for
[36:28] it because without love our works are
[36:30] accepted before God and neither is our
[36:32] service Paul speaking to the Corinthians
[36:35] said without love I'm nothing whatever I
[36:37] do is without profit lessons done in
[36:39] love now you can see right here that
[36:41] these believers worked in that nickel
[36:43] aiding class that then works as a means
[36:46] of salvation or to be admired by men
[36:48] they did their works out of the love of
[36:51] God that will shed abroad in their
[36:53] hearts by the Holy Ghost that's what I
[36:57] want to show again tonight
[36:59] church everyone that's not saved you
[37:03] know like to make believer they're only
[37:05] doing works to be seen of men they're
[37:08] not doing works to be seen of God they
[37:11] just want glory from other people but
[37:15] our works must be from the love of God
[37:17] within us that must be God's love
[37:20] motivating us to come to church to sing
[37:22] a special or to give to the poor give
[37:25] our tithes and offerings or to help out
[37:27] our brother and sister who's got a flat
[37:29] tire you know whatever we do it must be
[37:31] because of the love motivating us in our
[37:33] hearts not to be seen by men the rhythms
[37:38] of that love in our hearts was God's
[37:40] love for his own jesus said by this
[37:42] schulman know that you're my disciples
[37:44] when you have love one for another
[37:46] the pagans who saw their lives of early
[37:49] Christians that behold how they love
[37:51] each other and John said everyone that
[37:53] love is born of God they a bed lorry is
[37:59] the last one up for review and truly
[38:01] nothing instead of the increased labor
[38:04] of love and the other ages but in this
[38:05] age and the darkest of all ages they
[38:07] serve him more and more what a lesson
[38:10] that is there is no ceasing of this
[38:12] gracious service of love unto the Lord
[38:14] but rather an increasing of it that is
[38:17] the seeker you don't if you want to know
[38:19] the Christian or the secret of Christian
[38:20] life of course it's secret prayer but
[38:23] it's also increasing your love and
[38:25] service for God that's the secret to a
[38:27] Christian life let the enemy attempt to
[38:30] afford our service to the Lord our reply
[38:32] is increased service when the faith are
[38:36] crying in fear that is a time to shout
[38:38] the victory
[38:38] so our dedication must increase exactly
[38:41] what we heard on Sunday
[38:43] sky that is a secret don't give up don't
[38:46] get discourage keep doing right because
[38:49] of the due season you will reap if you
[38:50] faint enough the body says now there's
[38:53] two scriptures on the labor of love let
[38:54] me know that there's two scriptures our
[38:56] work must be love work must be motivated
[39:00] by love praise the Lord
[39:04] first us alone ends one verse two we
[39:06] give thanks to God always for you all
[39:08] making mention of you in our prayers you
[39:11] ever do that you're just crazy lord I
[39:12] thank you for brother so-and-so I thank
[39:14] you for sister so-and-so you ever done
[39:16] that
[39:16] I'm so thankful Lord that you set
[39:18] sister's brother Ernest on this family
[39:20] that's how we should feel about each
[39:22] other
[39:23] praise God remembering without ceasing
[39:26] your work of faith and labor of love and
[39:31] patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus
[39:34] Christ in the sight of God and our
[39:36] Father knowing their brethren beloved
[39:38] your election of God so you know that
[39:41] you're called of God so Paul says I
[39:44] thank you Lord for these Thessalonians I
[39:46] thank you for their labor thank you for
[39:48] their work and their love and he says
[39:51] knowing that they're called of God see
[39:53] when you know you're called it's easy to
[39:56] keep working because you've been called
[39:58] to do it praise God
[39:59] you know what they've all said you know
[40:01] with it that's what election means to
[40:02] call it I've been called to do this I've
[40:04] been called by God so how could I quit
[40:06] when God has called me to do it amen how
[40:09] could I give up
[40:09] how can I be crease the calling in my
[40:11] life when I know God has called me to
[40:13] amen
[40:14] you see that's what Paul said here it's
[40:17] a labor of love they did it because they
[40:18] didn't love God not because they want to
[40:21] be seen by man here's the second
[40:24] scripture for God is not one righteous
[40:28] to forget your work a labor of love
[40:30] how many feel good about death all the
[40:32] things you've done for God you might not
[40:35] seem like he got a reward yet but don't
[40:36] give up he's not going to forget about
[40:38] you face down he wrote down every prayer
[40:41] he wrote down every all he wrote down
[40:43] every fast he wrote all that down and
[40:46] he'll reward you praise God
[40:48] and the labor of love which you showed
[40:51] toward his name and that you have
[40:53] ministered to the Saints and do minister
[40:55] and we decide
[40:57] every one of you show the same diligence
[40:59] that's effort everybody should give the
[41:02] same effort to the full assurance of
[41:04] hope unto the end that could be not
[41:09] slothful or lazy but followers of them
[41:12] who faith and patience inherit the
[41:15] promises see what laziness shows
[41:18] laziness in a person's life and their
[41:22] lack of effort for God shows that they
[41:24] lost the vision they lost they lost the
[41:28] hope of the gospel they lost sight of
[41:29] the promise that got in our eyes off
[41:32] Christ and they got their eyes on the
[41:34] waves they even had like Peter they got
[41:36] their eyes in the wrong spot
[41:38] they'd forgotten they're calling a love
[41:42] that's supposed to be a labor of love
[41:44] remember Jesus will never forget us I
[41:47] want to bring this scripture because I
[41:49] mentioned it earlier this is the one I
[41:50] want to look at looking for that blessed
[41:53] hope and the glorious appearing of our
[41:55] great God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[41:56] who gave himself for us that he might
[41:59] redeem us from all iniquity that's why
[42:01] we got to come to all the services
[42:03] that's we got to pray all the days
[42:05] that's not going to be faithful all the
[42:08] time because we got a lot of iniquity to
[42:09] get purged out of us amen if they take
[42:12] it takes a lifetime to purge out all the
[42:14] iniquity doesn't it
[42:14] because you're constantly over trying to
[42:17] battle and wrestle with this sinful
[42:20] nature inside of you so all iniquity not
[42:23] just some all iniquity all the
[42:25] backsliding or all the evil officer all
[42:28] the laziness all this thoughtfulness he
[42:31] wants to bias back from all that and
[42:34] purify unto himself a peculiar people
[42:36] zealous of good works so see once here
[42:42] once he keeps verifying you and you're
[42:45] free from sin you'll be eager to do
[42:47] something forgot I'm you understand that
[42:48] if you're dirty and sin you won't want
[42:50] to do not forgot because you feel guilty
[42:52] right or you feel angry or you feel
[42:55] jealous or something like that but when
[42:57] you're pure before God you got a zeal to
[43:00] do something for God you feel good you
[43:03] feel right just like it's in your bed
[43:05] like in your marriage or with your
[43:06] parenting if you feel good towards your
[43:08] other wife you want to do some form you
[43:10] know
[43:11] you feel good towards your children you
[43:12] want to do something for them you feel
[43:15] good I feel good toward my class I'll do
[43:17] something good for my class you see
[43:20] that's how it is in Christ as long as
[43:22] we're staying pure will always be eager
[43:24] do something for God but if we let a
[43:26] little besetting sin we let the root of
[43:28] bitterness let a little lust or greed or
[43:31] anger or fear get in there then we won't
[43:34] want to really have a real desire to
[43:35] suffer God but when we're pure or we
[43:38] want to work for the Lord
[43:39] Damon that's right now the greek word
[43:41] means zealous it means eagerly desire of
[43:44] some high in other words mine I just
[43:47] wanna do something good for God I want
[43:49] Jesus to use me I want to do some for as
[43:52] a hobby no program said that's the
[43:55] evidence that you probably ought to Holy
[43:56] Ghost here it is
[43:58] 1954 I'll give you my estimation of what
[44:03] I think the closest thing to an evidence
[44:06] that a man is a Christian then anything
[44:10] I know you know what it is
[44:12] it's travail of soul a person that's
[44:16] always so hungry and thirsty for God
[44:20] amen
[44:21] they simply day night they just can't
[44:24] said it they got to do something for God
[44:29] amen what the other two only goes for
[44:31] Jessica see for the word of your day
[44:33] okay that's right now go little deeper
[44:35] once you receive the word of your day
[44:37] get cleaned out you want to do something
[44:38] for God see that and ties them perfectly
[44:42] you're so hungry for more of God your
[44:44] thirsting for more of God you always
[44:46] want more than honor so Stephen people
[44:48] going for the Lord it shows they're
[44:50] excellent because this is the true
[44:52] evidence that you are or to get you just
[44:54] want to do something for Diana you've
[44:57] seen God clean you out you've seen God
[44:59] take away get out of the kingdom of
[45:00] darkness and I are in the kingdom of
[45:02] light what can I do for the kingdom of
[45:04] light it's a brand new kingdom I love
[45:06] you part of this kingdom Lord give me
[45:08] some good works and do for this kingdom
[45:10] amen
[45:10] let me see this kingdom spread to other
[45:12] people praise God call fair perhaps ed
[45:19] they're full of love and they're just a
[45:21] soul travail like Carl right you
[45:24] just your soul travails for that versus
[45:26] like these other brothers on my heart
[45:28] you know tonight I just your soul
[45:30] travails for that just burn like my why
[45:34] don't they come back with these sisters
[45:36] one of these sisters come back my heart
[45:37] just yearns and I pray for them and I
[45:39] cry about them why would they come back
[45:41] that's a good evidence you got got
[45:43] inside of you that cuz he's the great
[45:45] Shepherd that left the 99 to go after
[45:47] the one praising the Bible said he that
[45:51] goes for sewing in tears cease sowing
[45:54] seeds God may these seeds come to
[45:56] fruition may these may be made these
[45:58] tracks the win souls these videos win
[46:01] souls write these sermons win souls
[46:03] whatever it is maybe some song CDs men
[46:07] they bless souls when you go planet I
[46:10] was said doubtless return again and
[46:13] rejoicing so whatever you plant
[46:15] eventually you'll rejoice over bringing
[46:18] him which precious shoes is that right I
[46:21] mean like that quote I can't even I like
[46:23] it it's one of the closest thing to an
[46:26] evidence I know hungry for souls just
[46:29] one do something for God man 1964 he
[46:33] says about the same thing and you and
[46:35] you're filled with the spirit here's one
[46:36] of the best signs I know of you're so in
[46:38] love with Christ and believe every word
[46:40] that he says to be the truth that's the
[46:43] evidence that you have the Holy Spirit
[46:44] and your lives for the joy and all my
[46:46] everything is different than what it
[46:48] used to be that's the Holy Spirit one of
[46:51] these days I'm going to stand that
[46:52] picture my sister Betty took me when I
[46:55] was 16 years old
[46:56] at my house I had all these sports
[46:59] posters on the wall women in bikinis but
[47:02] course I've come for that and that's
[47:03] awful that's sinful you know real
[47:05] wretched wicked I got my chewing tobacco
[47:07] sign hanging up back there
[47:09] that was my old life that's what I was
[47:12] but I tell the devil look at me now by
[47:15] God's grace
[47:15] those are my desires then look at my
[47:18] desires now praise God you won't find it
[47:20] to back up in our hops we'll have fun
[47:22] dirty pictures you'll find a sports
[47:24] letter B to get hanging all over the
[47:26] walls you'll find Christian posters all
[47:29] over the hollow you'll find a picture a
[47:31] brother random or the
[47:32] Lord Jesus Christ on the wall same day
[47:35] that's a Joe fine
[47:36] hallelujah it's exactly right now we're
[47:40] just going to hit a few of these by the
[47:41] racial or I still got about 40 minutes
[47:43] I just thought Lord I just want to see
[47:47] what what are some good scriptures on
[47:48] good works of the New Testament and
[47:51] would it inspire the church and
[47:53] encourage you to keep doing good
[47:54] amen always do good I want to look at
[47:58] this important point though first
[48:00] I remember the four classes of people
[48:03] never remember the first three kinds of
[48:05] believers program said in four classes I
[48:07] remember that okay so I want to focus on
[48:11] this one on the focus on the reprobate
[48:13] for a moment because I studied the
[48:15] scripture of the Bible the last week I
[48:17] really had an interesting there's just I
[48:20] would say like a further revelation on
[48:22] this so we got your Bible go to Titus
[48:25] one got your Bible when you light up
[48:27] here
[48:29] - 1:16 go ahead this was something that
[48:35] really struck me I want to I want to
[48:37] just note it for you because it really
[48:40] gets down to the heart of the good works
[48:42] why do you do that why do you come to
[48:44] church why do you go to service why you
[48:46] good works why do you give to this why
[48:47] do you do that I just want to bring this
[48:51] out because I've never seen it like this
[48:52] before Titus chapter 1 what did i do I
[49:03] know I'm on the wrong page okay there we
[49:07] go okay now I shall was one of our 15 -
[49:12] you're not reading Malcolm angry Liddy
[49:14] hey Malik I can you read 15 I just won
[49:18] 15 I did the pure all things are pure
[49:22] budgeted that are defiled I'll believe
[49:25] it is nothing pure but even their biting
[49:27] conscious is defiled okay so unbelievers
[49:31] nothing is pure to them before God right
[49:34] there they're so defiled in their mind
[49:36] is such an evil thoughts all the time
[49:37] and nothing is pure to them they're
[49:39] constant if I then it can you read verse
[49:41] 16
[49:48] - every time work there's a lot in that
[49:51] scripture but that scripture just stood
[49:54] out to me as I was preparing my these
[49:58] reprobates number remember the opposite
[50:00] of everybody's like Judas you know
[50:02] Balaam if mrs. Locke different ones I
[50:05] bet the Bible said they profess that
[50:09] they know God remember demons believe in
[50:12] God right and trembled these reprobates
[50:15] profess to know God but in their works
[50:19] they deny him being abominable so they
[50:23] do abominable thing thing about
[50:24] abominations homosexuality right
[50:26] cross-dressing so many others I can't
[50:30] think of it of course lying and
[50:31] dishonest balance you know not treating
[50:33] everybody fairly
[50:34] it's abomination the proud and little
[50:36] pride is an abomination right so in
[50:40] their works their abominable their
[50:42] disobedient to the word and on to every
[50:46] good work reprobate now what's the
[50:49] remember baby unfit so when it comes to
[50:52] doing a good work any good work for God
[50:54] they're unfit to do it why because their
[50:57] mind is the file right they do it for
[51:00] any other purpose they do it for them
[51:02] selfishly they do it for to be seen a
[51:04] men they do it to be whatever you make
[51:07] money so our works should not deny him
[51:12] our works should bless him he's got an
[51:14] artwork should please him we should be
[51:17] doing them for him
[51:18] I just want to get you to see that
[51:20] that's so crucial because this is the
[51:22] group that's going to be deceived on the
[51:24] day of judgment right that's why four
[51:26] judges are going to be surprised you
[51:27] know I thought we did this Lord then we
[51:29] do this or didn't we do that this is the
[51:32] group and why how did you how how could
[51:34] they have known they could know that
[51:36] they were look at their works they never
[51:38] really we're ready or fix you any good
[51:40] work for God so thought you like that
[51:45] there now you know Matthew 7:21 so this
[51:49] is the same group these are people that
[51:51] did works some works for God but
[51:54] ultimately they were workers of iniquity
[51:57] doors they had varicose judas course had
[51:59] miracles we went out with the 70 then
[52:02] went out to buy two did miracles healed
[52:03] the sick raise the dead did all kinds of
[52:05] miracles so sometimes had God's
[52:07] anointing on them when in the lead you
[52:09] get the devil's anointing on them
[52:10] especially sold out the Lord so in other
[52:14] words these are the tears all their
[52:16] tears with this group they claim to know
[52:18] God this group doesn't claim to know God
[52:19] it's like all these your left-wing
[52:23] people on the news and everything
[52:24] they'll even claim to believe in God but
[52:27] this is a group that's so to see they
[52:30] claim to know God but they're unfit to
[52:32] do any good work for God because their
[52:34] hearts and minds of the file I think I
[52:37] just need to emphasize that here they
[52:40] profess to know him but their works deny
[52:43] him and they're unfit to do it any good
[52:46] work for God all right
[52:50] now I put a mark 939 let's read out I
[52:53] just want you to see this here this
[52:55] helped me to mark 1939 I'll go to the
[53:01] next slide here student I'm going to be
[53:03] down here mark 939 go ahead you and read
[53:12] that mark nighty-night sir
[53:14] thank you but you just said for Benny
[53:17] not where there is no man
[53:19] which shall do a miracle in my name that
[53:22] candid lately speak evil of me amen
[53:26] now what Jesus say nobody can lightly
[53:30] speak evil of me and do a miracle
[53:33] remember those in Matthew 7 had miracles
[53:37] remember they said haven't we prophesied
[53:39] and when we cast out devils and Jesus
[53:41] said I never knew you you worker of
[53:44] iniquity right and so what did Jesus say
[53:47] Jesus says you can do a miracle right
[53:51] but you do not lightly speak easily all
[53:54] the word lightly means it means quickly
[53:56] their miracles proved they did not
[53:58] likely or quickly speak evil of Jesus
[54:01] that's how it's hard enough tears my
[54:03] like my gramps said they're hard to
[54:05] decipher sometimes they look just like
[54:06] the wheat so when you start talking to
[54:08] it it's all good
[54:10] good about Jesus everything's good they
[54:12] send a message and they say they love
[54:13] Jesus because they will quickly say
[54:16] something wrong but they're like Balaam
[54:18] who went to hell we know into the prison
[54:21] eventually as time went on he started
[54:24] teaching a false doctrine it's okay to
[54:27] commit fornication it's okay for these
[54:28] men asleep with the women different
[54:30] things like that it's okay for Jews and
[54:32] many nights and Jews
[54:34] whatever more to sleep you know all
[54:35] kinds of nonsense like that he didn't do
[54:38] it quickly at the beginning it took a
[54:40] while for it to show up that's why we
[54:43] thank God for the test of time amen make
[54:46] your collection sure praise God
[54:48] don't just not just a fly-by-night
[54:50] programs that just don't serve God for a
[54:52] week and then try to some for God or a
[54:54] year we want to be faithful for decades
[54:56] and lifetimes ain't ahead other than
[54:59] good center of all the days of our life
[55:01] on the dunya to see someone can do a
[55:06] miracle and still be lost like you to
[55:09] surveil and we know that that's what
[55:12] these people are they profess to know
[55:13] them and right away you know quickly
[55:15] enough to say nice things about Jesus
[55:17] but if you get him down on some doctrine
[55:18] to get them down a little bit further
[55:20] and get down to the real truth of the
[55:22] word pretty soon you'll find itself
[55:24] false about that and then all these
[55:27] other miracles didn't mean nothing
[55:30] because in their heart they still had
[55:32] the desire for sin see that I hope that
[55:37] does that help by God's grace I hope
[55:38] that helps you are the grace of Lord
[55:40] open itself in the live streamers to me
[55:42] may be a very small crowd respect I
[55:44] don't want them I want them to feel like
[55:46] me to have to say Amen I'll say Amen
[55:50] sorry but I hope you understand that
[55:52] that's how they can do it though the
[55:55] workers iniquity in Matthew 7 and Balaam
[55:57] Judas they could do miracles and right
[56:00] away they would say nothing wrong you
[56:01] quickly say something good but give it a
[56:04] little time I'm getting out of doctrine
[56:06] and they'll show their true colors and
[56:08] every tribe struck me on the Sunday I
[56:11] was writing down I'm going to stand up
[56:12] came up for second service every trial
[56:15] will show it's in people's heart right
[56:17] for example get people at marriage trial
[56:20] let's say it's a financial trouble
[56:24] let's just say it's a marrow trouble and
[56:26] let's say let's say a husband offends a
[56:28] white and - the wife runs out and finds
[56:30] another man that trial just showed what
[56:34] was in her heart and she wanted another
[56:35] man
[56:36] same thing for vice versa with a woman
[56:39] right if the woman does wrong to the man
[56:40] like I know I was told by a pastor up in
[56:43] uh well I'm not going to say this ain't
[56:45] good let me just say up north far no if
[56:49] not just you know this part as far north
[56:51] another state he said there was a
[56:53] message Church up there and a man found
[56:55] a quote where brother Ram said a woman
[56:59] cuts your hair a man and abortion that's
[57:01] true he could but he cannot remarry
[57:04] again because the only cause for
[57:07] remarriage is unconfessed fornication
[57:09] and Evelin espouse but this pastor told
[57:14] me that the previous pastor this church
[57:15] and he said they had about 200 people
[57:17] coming to church but once this pastor
[57:19] got an evil spirit on him he he went all
[57:24] he want to marry another woman in the
[57:25] church so younger girl so here's what he
[57:27] did was awful uh he kept abusing his
[57:32] wife verbally so she would cut her hair
[57:34] and then when then when she did and this
[57:37] is a man who tames Tommy pride about it
[57:39] it hurt he's the follow pastor he's
[57:41] trying to bring the church back together
[57:42] and this was happened about twenty years
[57:44] ago he said he did that so she cut her
[57:49] hair and then he presented to the church
[57:51] and said my wife cut her hair I can put
[57:53] her away and I marry another and he did
[57:55] it looks like an 18 year old girl he was
[57:57] already probably 30 to 40 and then the
[58:00] whole church did that all these men in
[58:02] church except for just a few couples did
[58:04] that
[58:04] now when that show the that trial or
[58:08] that thing show what was in the man's
[58:09] heart already if show he had lust laying
[58:12] there the whole time right and because
[58:15] he didn't deal with that lust his works
[58:18] were in vain I hope your how many
[58:19] sermons he preached I don't care how
[58:21] much good he did it was all in vain
[58:23] because he was a worker of iniquity here
[58:27] we see that is with the church and
[58:29] they're down to twenty last I went on
[58:30] their priest for them they're down to 20
[58:32] I'm going to only preach at one time I
[58:33] haven't been back since but they're down
[58:35] to 20 people made each one I purchased
[58:38] our 9:00 Sunday morning there's about 10
[58:39] people on Saturday night there might
[58:41] have a 20 on a Sunday my heart but it
[58:43] went from like 200 or 100 or something
[58:45] like that
[58:45] all the way another 20 all because of
[58:46] what it Nick with 10 then people started
[58:49] down to the message and now brother
[58:51] branham endowed this and what was it
[58:55] right at first that pass was a real good
[58:58] pastor but in little time to what he did
[59:00] it showed that the trials show what's in
[59:03] people's heart in praise God just like
[59:06] he would stop coming to church that
[59:09] shows that didn't really have a hunger
[59:10] and love for God to begin with right
[59:13] like we've had like I've had you know
[59:15] interaction with people that have left
[59:17] recently and talking with them and
[59:18] things like that
[59:19] and it shows that never had love for God
[59:22] the first place because when you come
[59:23] here is not to see a man or a woman it's
[59:25] because you love God amen that's why you
[59:27] come you're here support God they made
[59:30] and whoever is on God's side because
[59:33] it's your family right if a trial comes
[59:36] and say let's say a trial comes in and
[59:41] someone stops paying their ties if it's
[59:43] a financial tribe what does that show
[59:45] it show they didn't have a trust for God
[59:47] in the first place because that trial
[59:50] show what was in the person's heart see
[59:53] that so the trial blush the trial showed
[59:56] in the pastor's life lust was still in
[59:58] his heart the trial people skip in
[1:00:00] charge but absent shows that in order to
[1:00:03] love and gather heart you said 90% of
[1:00:04] church will watch we love Suzy ah Donna
[1:00:06] on Wednesday night rather coming to
[1:00:10] church of a prayer meeting it shows
[1:00:12] what's in their heart they love
[1:00:14] entertainment more than gospel true they
[1:00:16] met a bi and a financial trial will show
[1:00:19] that people don't have trust they can't
[1:00:21] put that 10% or 11% in 12 whatever they
[1:00:24] do they care if they don't have enough
[1:00:26] trust in God they don't believe God's
[1:00:27] promise it shows there's unbelief there
[1:00:29] the receipt up like a breeze hope you
[1:00:32] can see that now we can go with any of
[1:00:33] them anger bitterness fear you know you
[1:00:36] can put anything in there any trial that
[1:00:39] a person fails it shows there something
[1:00:42] that still haven't overcome but how does
[1:00:43] it even God's grace and mercy that if
[1:00:46] they confess their sin it's our walk
[1:00:48] back of the light and God will purge
[1:00:50] their heart
[1:00:51] and purge them from all iniquity hey man
[1:00:55] that's right okay I've got the blessing
[1:00:58] hope that makes sense by God's grace I
[1:01:00] think it does as we get to the word now
[1:01:04] just so you know some works are not to
[1:01:08] be seen I already saw some scriptures
[1:01:09] you know there's private prayer there's
[1:01:11] private almsgiving I don't need to show
[1:01:13] that I think you government understand
[1:01:15] oh the people here I don't know how the
[1:01:17] LOB to the large one does if they go to
[1:01:18] our church I'm sure they understand but
[1:01:20] maybe newcomers in other countries
[1:01:22] listen might not but there are some
[1:01:25] works that God doesn't want anybody to
[1:01:26] see you do right but some works are to
[1:01:30] be seen right
[1:01:32] God wants to think of all the miracles
[1:01:34] Jesus did and everybody saw praise God
[1:01:37] think about st. Paul all the miracles he
[1:01:39] did think about all the Americans
[1:01:40] brother Brandon there's some things God
[1:01:42] does want you to do in front of people
[1:01:43] so that they will see the glory of God
[1:01:46] and then give God Bowl and it don't
[1:01:50] always have to be married you can just
[1:01:52] be any kindness it can be any act of
[1:01:54] Christianity remember we have to do it
[1:01:58] so not so people see us no they're going
[1:02:01] to see us but to do it because it's the
[1:02:03] right thing to do and Christ Christ is
[1:02:06] our motivation for it
[1:02:07] so some works are to be seen this is
[1:02:10] Matthew 5:16 remember brother Clemente
[1:02:12] Aran's preached on that I'm the older
[1:02:13] gentleman who's going to Philippines he
[1:02:15] preached let your light so shine before
[1:02:18] men member that they might see your good
[1:02:20] works so one case Jesus says don't let
[1:02:23] people see the words in other cases like
[1:02:25] let people see your works season you got
[1:02:28] you have that with good work some of
[1:02:29] that he wants you to show them that you
[1:02:32] live the life in front of people the
[1:02:34] others he said keep this private between
[1:02:36] you and I remember Church sometimes God
[1:02:41] wants us to pray in public you know
[1:02:42] never when Paul went to Lydia Paul went
[1:02:46] to Lydia and they were praying by River
[1:02:48] I would pop you know there's public you
[1:02:51] know they're they're not under roof
[1:02:52] they're just praying out there and Paul
[1:02:54] goes and joins them for each of Evan she
[1:02:56] might sum over to the house and gets a
[1:02:58] get baptized you know Peter and John
[1:03:01] were going down to pray the gate of
[1:03:03] beautiful and they saw the paralyzing
[1:03:05] Edison such as I have yet ID right
[1:03:07] they're going to pray publicly there so
[1:03:10] there is a place for public prayer here
[1:03:11] to church we got to make sure we're
[1:03:14] praying in a humble way and we're
[1:03:15] praying not to have a long prayer you
[1:03:17] know to make myself look good or DC or
[1:03:20] make myself look good on YouTube or
[1:03:21] stuff like that this is just a free
[1:03:23] honest sincere heart thanks John
[1:03:25] to contact God amen so I'm gonna teach
[1:03:31] you a whole sermon about this on
[1:03:32] September 3rd 1961 called let your light
[1:03:34] so shine before men and here's the basic
[1:03:38] thought here's his main thought we are
[1:03:41] God's advertising billboard brother
[1:03:43] Graham said now how you feel okay buddy
[1:03:46] go once you go talk to mommy look it's
[1:03:49] okay if you don't have to put it let me
[1:03:50] get some water who see mama he wasn't
[1:03:58] dealing with you sweetie
[1:03:59] I don't want to pass enough media now we
[1:04:02] do have the bracelet no doubt about that
[1:04:04] if you get some water if you look better
[1:04:07] so this message whether grabbing luck
[1:04:09] like it too unto a billboard you see
[1:04:12] billboards always charge don't in most
[1:04:14] of you hate something you like but brig
[1:04:17] Anderson we are God's advertising
[1:04:20] billboard that's what you and I are you
[1:04:23] talk about letting your light shine our
[1:04:26] advertisement events it will only take
[1:04:28] effect on those who are in need of what
[1:04:30] we're reflecting and he gives the
[1:04:31] example he said he was driving
[1:04:32] somewheres all sides and said hungry
[1:04:34] with a question mark
[1:04:35] the bet is that that side is only going
[1:04:38] to take effect on those who are hungry
[1:04:40] other people you don't go past after the
[1:04:42] pesticide they'll pass the restaurant
[1:04:44] never deal I don't need that I'm gonna
[1:04:47] have the same said the same thing is
[1:04:48] true in other words they must be hungry
[1:04:49] and thirsting after righteousness in
[1:04:51] order for your side to have effect on a
[1:04:53] man and row Graham said advertising is
[1:04:56] very effective and realize that that's
[1:04:57] what God does with us God it's very
[1:04:59] effective using us as I've imagined and
[1:05:02] how did so much so they'll race up these
[1:05:04] billboards on the Dan judgments and
[1:05:06] outlet this week oh that this way Justin
[1:05:08] Krishna this wing will be God's
[1:05:10] advertise with God's evidence and
[1:05:12] somebody could that this work
[1:05:14] amen amen somebody can live it somebody
[1:05:17] can be a real billboard for Christ am
[1:05:20] Adam and that's this whole point of the
[1:05:23] whole sermon I just point out two quotes
[1:05:26] for you I think you like one of the
[1:05:27] beginning one at the end he said I
[1:05:29] believe the Christian is God's billboard
[1:05:32] I believe each one of us is God's
[1:05:35] billboard and we don't have to do so
[1:05:36] much carrying on about I'll look at I
[1:05:38] did see that's the first we'll get to
[1:05:41] that moose Pharisee said oh I give my
[1:05:43] time I give my offerings and I do I fast
[1:05:46] three times a week enough and they brag
[1:05:49] about in front of everybody
[1:05:50] I'm dr. so-and-so and I don't do this my
[1:05:54] medicines don't carry on about you worse
[1:05:57] just simply live such a life that will
[1:06:01] make people hungry the about any man so
[1:06:07] you don't carry around about what you do
[1:06:08] if you ask me yeah the honestly I didn't
[1:06:10] happen I was God's grace I was God's
[1:06:12] mercy the man is closed by saying you're
[1:06:17] the son of the earth if the salt has
[1:06:19] lost its taking over where we shall it
[1:06:21] be salted that's right
[1:06:23] hungry thirsty let your light so shine
[1:06:25] before men that they see your good works
[1:06:27] see what you do and glorify the father
[1:06:30] what's in heaven hungry signboards
[1:06:35] reflecting wonderful yes sir so see
[1:06:39] we're like a billboard reflected we must
[1:06:41] reflect Christ put something on our life
[1:06:43] he writes his word upon our hearts amen
[1:06:45] he writes it there and then we're
[1:06:48] supposed to reflect that to other people
[1:06:50] that they see the good works of God that
[1:06:52] help by God's grace amen that's what
[1:06:54] good works are good works
[1:06:57] many of our good works are to be seen by
[1:06:59] men is listen church if you don't do a
[1:07:01] good work around people you'll probably
[1:07:03] end up cine right or compromising you
[1:07:07] have to stand there we have to stand
[1:07:09] there and do the good thing do the right
[1:07:11] thing here's where we get in trouble
[1:07:13] people start hating us like I've had
[1:07:15] people hate me or unfriend me and not
[1:07:17] talk to me I had co-workers they won't
[1:07:19] even look at me when they want they used
[1:07:20] to be so friendly to me they found out
[1:07:22] when I preached on YouTube
[1:07:24] they don't even look at me that happened
[1:07:27] this year amen that's okay because we're
[1:07:31] supposed to speak about we're supposed
[1:07:33] to speak against evil work and the Bible
[1:07:37] said when someone doesn't even work you
[1:07:39] go and tell them alone and if they hear
[1:07:43] thee get your brother if I was at Cain
[1:07:45] slew Abel because it works for evil
[1:07:47] enables a righteous see our life is such
[1:07:51] a rebuke to sinners here's what here's
[1:07:55] where Jesus says it plainly the world
[1:07:58] cannot hate you but it Meah
[1:08:00] Edythe because I testify of it that the
[1:08:03] works there other evil
[1:08:05] that's what hated Jesus he told them
[1:08:07] their works were evil any minute so see
[1:08:10] us when we preach out things and people
[1:08:12] leave let them leave it shows they hate
[1:08:14] us right they hate the word because the
[1:08:16] word will always expose sin then there
[1:08:20] will be no sin into that holy city
[1:08:21] Alleluia man nothing nothing that
[1:08:23] defiles nothing abominable no thieves
[1:08:26] don't liars no nothing like that it'll
[1:08:29] be a pure holy city and all the works
[1:08:31] will be holy man let's see that's why
[1:08:35] the eighty Jesus he always told what was
[1:08:37] wrong what was right and Jesus said if
[1:08:40] he said they'll hate neither I hate you
[1:08:43] you should be hated of all men for my
[1:08:44] name's sake hey but he that endureth to
[1:08:47] the end shall be saved and we could
[1:08:50] endure being hated and we get a doer
[1:08:51] being rejected if we can endure
[1:08:53] you know bearing the reproach of Christ
[1:08:55] we shall be saved how did it again what
[1:08:58] are the best againa I'm almost done here
[1:09:00] like I said I'm not going to get to all
[1:09:02] these what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
[1:09:04] flip through these and we'll just hit
[1:09:05] the highlights the things I think the
[1:09:07] most beneficial got about twenty minutes
[1:09:12] okay here's four of them John the
[1:09:18] Baptist heard the works of Jesus so John
[1:09:20] the Baptist sitting are you the Messiah
[1:09:22] or should we look for another jesus said
[1:09:24] go tell them about the words see your
[1:09:27] works prove what kind of person you are
[1:09:28] praise God I served mother never said
[1:09:31] this vegan respect he said Jesus didn't
[1:09:34] send John a book on how to behave
[1:09:36] yourself in prison
[1:09:37] he said he said he said of a testimony
[1:09:40] saying the blind see the dead are raised
[1:09:42] the sicker healed the main wall came
[1:09:45] head that's what he said it in prison
[1:09:47] the testimony about the power of God he
[1:09:50] then glory Jesus said the mighty works
[1:09:54] of God should have brought people to
[1:09:55] repentance but it did not so all that
[1:09:58] was left was judgment
[1:10:00] jesus said every man will be judged by
[1:10:03] his works
[1:10:03] that's because works is faith expressed
[1:10:06] so we be saved if you have paid you do
[1:10:09] the right works if you don't have faith
[1:10:10] what you have you might want to think
[1:10:11] it's even better unbelief either a faith
[1:10:14] don't believe in your soul so unbelief
[1:10:16] will produce flow equal works it is
[1:10:20] unfit unbelief is unfit for any good
[1:10:22] work but if you have faith you do the
[1:10:25] right work change time and then you'll
[1:10:27] be judged on it and I just pull this up
[1:10:32] there it was out of order because I have
[1:10:33] some more but jesus said if you these
[1:10:35] are good works that will earn people's
[1:10:37] salvation church none and it was hard
[1:10:38] it's hard for so instead that but God is
[1:10:40] so love it he will give salvation to
[1:10:43] someone who never got saved never
[1:10:45] believed in Christ maybe but they did
[1:10:47] these things to believers they visited a
[1:10:50] Christian in prison they clothed the
[1:10:54] naked Christian or someone to do to
[1:10:55] clothes they fed a hungry Christian they
[1:11:00] gave drink to a thirsty Christian and
[1:11:02] they housed a Christian who is a
[1:11:04] stranger God will give somebody eternal
[1:11:07] life for that man isn't God's grace and
[1:11:10] they see touches that disposed me way
[1:11:12] every time I read that my and they'll
[1:11:14] say when did we do this Scott we didn't
[1:11:16] see you he says when you did the least
[1:11:18] these my brother you don't undersell
[1:11:20] good works matter Church good works
[1:11:22] matter if we stole Christian is in jail
[1:11:24] you should go see him if we know
[1:11:26] Christians in the hospital we should try
[1:11:27] to go see him up and possibly can if you
[1:11:34] 23 one to seven
[1:11:36] oh yeah let's read this one yeah so I'm
[1:11:37] after 23 this is going 3 through 23
[1:11:54] okay here's how you know you're sitting
[1:11:59] under a false preacher by God's grace I
[1:12:02] want to be true Beto I don't believe my
[1:12:04] boss that lead on true by the grace of
[1:12:06] Lord of it here's how you know verse one
[1:12:12] okay let's go to verse two the scribes
[1:12:14] and the Pharisees sit in Moses see all
[1:12:16] therefore whatsoever they bind you
[1:12:19] observe that observe and do but do not
[1:12:21] eat after their works for they say and
[1:12:24] do not that's when you know it's a false
[1:12:26] creature they say something and they
[1:12:28] don't do it right so Jesus I listen to
[1:12:32] them and take out the Bible for do what
[1:12:34] they say
[1:12:35] but don't do as they do because they say
[1:12:39] it but they don't do it for example if I
[1:12:42] say oh you should fast and pray but I
[1:12:43] never fast and pray
[1:12:44] that's hypocrite if I say oh we should
[1:12:47] come early to pray but I don't come
[1:12:49] early to pray that's immigrant right oh
[1:12:52] you should take communion but I don't
[1:12:54] take communion
[1:12:55] that's the hypocrite understand it look
[1:12:59] at verse 4 for they bind heavy burdens
[1:13:01] and grievous to be borne and lay them on
[1:13:05] men's shoulders but they themselves will
[1:13:08] not move them with one of their fingers
[1:13:09] so they put burdens on people but then
[1:13:12] they will even help the people out see
[1:13:15] that that's a false preacher this is
[1:13:20] someone who has the evil works we're not
[1:13:23] done verse 5 but all their works they do
[1:13:25] for to be seen of men they make broad
[1:13:30] their phylacteries and large the lords
[1:13:32] their garments so they won't help other
[1:13:34] people they'll tell people what to do
[1:13:36] but they won't help other people right
[1:13:39] and they love the uppermost rooms at the
[1:13:42] feast and the chief seats in the
[1:13:45] synagogues all right so see that's why
[1:13:51] but that's where the balances they only
[1:13:53] do works to be seen a minute but jesus
[1:13:55] said let your works be seen amend to see
[1:13:57] we have to be able to do things in front
[1:14:00] of men
[1:14:01] but not do it for them yeah do it for
[1:14:04] Christ amen because they want to be seen
[1:14:07] by men and yeah we want to be Jesus once
[1:14:09] men to see us but our reason for doing
[1:14:12] it has to be for Christ amen it's seeing
[1:14:15] such a see that's a fine line there he
[1:14:18] said let your light shine do good works
[1:14:20] in front of people do the right thing
[1:14:21] but don't do it for them
[1:14:23] amen you know to make to make them thing
[1:14:26] higher if you do it for Christ amen
[1:14:32] Jesus's works more witness that the
[1:14:34] father said him so see our works prove
[1:14:37] that we've gotten Jonathan takes what
[1:14:41] must we what must we do to do the work
[1:14:44] of the Son of God also the works of God
[1:14:47] I so I miss Beldon believe on the son
[1:14:50] because these signs will fall into
[1:14:52] belief Amen like that they wanted how do
[1:14:55] we do the works of God he says believe
[1:14:57] see how important faith is we just have
[1:14:59] to believe someone sick let's believe
[1:15:00] they'll get well for his job
[1:15:02] if someone struggled by edge let's
[1:15:04] believe a self about if we can amen
[1:15:06] let's put our money to it right because
[1:15:09] the Bible says if you don't help out
[1:15:10] then you don't your faith without works
[1:15:12] is dead right you really have dead faith
[1:15:15] that's right
[1:15:17] now aren't you ready John seven seven
[1:15:19] the world hates Jesus because he
[1:15:21] condemns their works I like this one the
[1:15:25] children Abraham do the works of Abraham
[1:15:27] praise God remember Abraham he believed
[1:15:29] and didn't doubt right he staggered out
[1:15:32] the promise of God Allah we made
[1:15:33] mistakes God didn't count his mistakes
[1:15:35] against him because he kept it under the
[1:15:37] blood that's what we do we confess our
[1:15:40] sins and we really we we give God glory
[1:15:43] and said we don't stagger on the promise
[1:15:45] of God we keep moving toward we keep
[1:15:47] moving toward by God's grace and John
[1:15:52] died a man was born blind that the works
[1:15:54] of God might be manifested in him
[1:15:56] praise God so see all trials don't
[1:16:00] happen because the people says I thought
[1:16:01] God just allows it so he can do good
[1:16:03] work amen John 10 believe me for the
[1:16:08] work sakes if you cannot believe my
[1:16:10] words believe me for because of the
[1:16:12] works praise God
[1:16:15] and John 14 said the father the dwell
[1:16:17] finding good the works the works that I
[1:16:18] do shall he be off a minute a minute
[1:16:21] they got for that Khalid idiot the sins
[1:16:24] of the Pharisees remained because Jesus
[1:16:26] spoke God's word unto them and did the
[1:16:29] works that no other man did so because
[1:16:32] he told them the truth now they're
[1:16:33] accountable for praise God and then
[1:16:36] because his works were greater than
[1:16:38] anybody else they'll also be held
[1:16:39] responsible for those works
[1:16:42] let's read acts 9 because I think
[1:16:44] that'll encourage the sisters acts 936
[1:16:47] it always encourages many them to look
[1:16:51] at the life of Tabitha God thought so
[1:16:53] much of her that erase her from the dead
[1:16:56] because she was full of good works in
[1:16:59] other words she filled her time with
[1:17:00] doing good things she was doing good
[1:17:02] things all the time John after X 9 36
[1:17:06] now there was that job a certain
[1:17:08] disciple named Tabitha which five
[1:17:10] interpretation is called dorkus
[1:17:12] this woman was full of good works and
[1:17:14] all his deeds which she did so good
[1:17:18] works which good business joy did good
[1:17:19] business and all his deeds of course are
[1:17:22] given secret giving so this is what her
[1:17:25] life was full of her life was full of
[1:17:27] doing good things for people and doing
[1:17:29] them in secret that's what our lives
[1:17:30] should be a bad look at this ah verse 39
[1:17:36] then Peter arose and went with them when
[1:17:40] he was called they brought him into the
[1:17:41] upper chamber and all the widows stood
[1:17:43] by weeping and showing the coats and
[1:17:45] garments which Dorcas had made while she
[1:17:47] was with her so before she died like a
[1:17:49] sister Dorcas what are you doing today
[1:17:51] you know it's Monday morning oh I'm so
[1:17:53] encodes for the kids I'm making garments
[1:17:56] for the poor Christians you know
[1:17:57] well it's Tuesday you want to go over
[1:18:00] here go oh my god I got so some more
[1:18:02] where'd you find sister darkus in church
[1:18:04] and you can find her do a good works
[1:18:07] where sister Dorcas well she didn't say
[1:18:09] she said she had some secret business to
[1:18:11] take care of you know she just left and
[1:18:13] she's probably giving up the coat see
[1:18:15] that you know the Dharma's
[1:18:17] maybe she made a nice new skirt for
[1:18:18] somebody maybe she sewed a nice tie for
[1:18:21] a pastor hey maybe she did something
[1:18:25] nice you see for
[1:18:26] bastard eater you know you see that it
[1:18:31] looks like she's getting to the poor
[1:18:32] because the all's right Holmes arms are
[1:18:35] people that need them that's where her
[1:18:37] life was full up what are you doing
[1:18:39] today I'm just trying to help somebody
[1:18:40] out my god that's guy so I'm gonna do
[1:18:42] today that's what the corpus is like and
[1:18:44] then we know she was raging the day God
[1:18:46] thought so much about it
[1:18:48] not in acts 26 23 bet and do works meet
[1:18:54] for pennies so if somebody truly repents
[1:18:57] their works will show that they did
[1:18:59] repent that's right
[1:19:03] and I had three acts of repentance I'm
[1:19:05] not going to get to that tonight now
[1:19:11] that's pretty good in seconds 11:15 Paul
[1:19:13] says the end of people is based upon
[1:19:16] their works either heaven or hell is
[1:19:19] thanks upon your works what you did with
[1:19:23] what God gave you now let me find a
[1:19:26] place of closure because I got 10
[1:19:27] minutes here um let me skip a little
[1:19:33] further here let me close with this I'm
[1:19:35] gonna skip all the way see how these
[1:19:36] there's 212 let's close let's close to
[1:19:40] here let's go let's go revelation let's
[1:19:42] close they're my customers now
[1:19:46] revelation if we want to get back our
[1:19:49] first original walk with God you got to
[1:19:51] do the first worse so however much you
[1:19:54] pray when you when you said you're on
[1:19:55] fire when I want to fire however much I
[1:19:58] prayed or studied I got to go back into
[1:19:59] the same and if I want the same
[1:20:02] experience I got to do the same work
[1:20:04] amen right guess it while I want a weary
[1:20:08] feeling of the Holy Ghost but not pray
[1:20:10] like when you've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:12] they could happen to that ain't gonna
[1:20:14] happen you have to do the first works if
[1:20:18] they get in condition to be refilled and
[1:20:21] be in condition to have those things
[1:20:24] come back to you if you've lost them any
[1:20:26] the first works now this is beautiful
[1:20:31] revelation 2:26 I just saw this this
[1:20:34] morning it's kind of familiar Watchers
[1:20:38] from there
[1:20:39] I'll read that revelation 2:26 one
[1:20:44] closer to this thought if we do the
[1:20:50] works of God he makes us rule over
[1:20:54] nations think of the nation United
[1:20:59] States if you do the works of God Christ
[1:21:04] promised you'll rule over a nation
[1:21:08] that's how that's how rare it is to find
[1:21:11] somebody who doesn't with of God that
[1:21:14] God has to give God if he's on the great
[1:21:15] reward I'll give you rule over a whole
[1:21:17] nation revelation 2:26 this is
[1:21:21] struggling today and he'd overcometh and
[1:21:24] keepeth my works unto the end to him
[1:21:26] will I give power over the nation's this
[1:21:31] is an estrangement right now that works
[1:21:33] out pretty good by God's grace so if
[1:21:37] they overcame Satan all devices and did
[1:21:40] the works of didn't Jesus works and not
[1:21:42] my works Jesus's words right not your
[1:21:45] works not by your your idea my idea but
[1:21:48] his idea praise God what is word says if
[1:21:51] you do that you and I do that
[1:21:53] he gives us power over the nation's now
[1:22:01] let's go to Revelation 21 now let's
[1:22:04] close of this I wonder this is what I
[1:22:05] kind of closed my script on for the next
[1:22:10] videos so I closed it kind of within
[1:22:11] Revelation 21 verse 24 relation 21 24 if
[1:22:19] we can tap into the mind of God and we
[1:22:22] can let the mind of God flow through us
[1:22:23] in our daily activities what do we fill
[1:22:26] our free tide with but we fill all of
[1:22:28] our time with if that could be the will
[1:22:30] of God he gives us a reward to rule over
[1:22:33] entire nation that's striking revelation
[1:22:38] 21 24 they didn't read 24 or 25 nations
[1:22:44] of them which are saved shall walk in
[1:22:46] the light of it and the kings of the
[1:22:48] earth
[1:22:51] it should not be shot
[1:22:56] verse 26 re and they shall bring the
[1:23:00] glory and honor of the nation's into it
[1:23:04] look at that history heads up so jesus
[1:23:08] promised this what 2,000 years ago
[1:23:11] he promised if you overcome your rule
[1:23:13] over nations in here we finally see
[1:23:15] where the reward gets given the heavenly
[1:23:18] city comes down to new jerusalem the
[1:23:21] bride is of the city and the Bible says
[1:23:24] that the nations of the saved that walk
[1:23:27] in the light the kings of those nations
[1:23:30] write their glory nada will be brought
[1:23:33] into the city amen all right look at
[1:23:37] that
[1:23:37] and that's striking and striking to me
[1:23:41] the program said about this I want to
[1:23:43] make sure I read this year hey let's do
[1:23:48] this thank you 59 and then I can prove
[1:23:52] that there is degrees in heaven that
[1:23:56] they'll not all be on the same equal I
[1:23:58] like here we have president he's highest
[1:24:02] maybe senators you know keep going maybe
[1:24:06] Supreme Court justice something you keep
[1:24:08] going down senator representative of the
[1:24:10] house he'll keep going down and you got
[1:24:12] a little little with us see right now
[1:24:14] we're on the bottom the church if we
[1:24:15] keep the Word of God it's going to flip
[1:24:17] Friday because the Bible said he'll turn
[1:24:21] the world upside down a man exactly
[1:24:23] right he turns the orders not the order
[1:24:25] of man now it's the order of God some of
[1:24:28] my being a bottom dweller down because
[1:24:30] and they're by God's grace will be at
[1:24:32] the top not because we did all works but
[1:24:35] because we did his works amen the works
[1:24:38] of God hallelujah so look it's not equal
[1:24:42] to heaven not everybody gets the same
[1:24:43] reward there's different rewards in
[1:24:46] heaven they'll not be on the same equal
[1:24:49] but you'll have equal eternal life is
[1:24:55] Jackie all because of what your works
[1:24:58] what you filled with your business what
[1:25:01] you did in your free time
[1:25:03] but the Bible said that the kings of the
[1:25:06] earth bring their honor and glory bring
[1:25:08] their honor and glory to the city that
[1:25:09] crews they'll be kings in the new earth
[1:25:10] kings and rulers jesus told his
[1:25:13] disciples what will we have after we
[1:25:16] have left father mother and I all to
[1:25:18] follow you he said barely said to you
[1:25:19] you'll set up on twelve Thrones judging
[1:25:21] the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:25:23] see it's another it's a big system
[1:25:25] that's coming up that will be our
[1:25:27] supreme to anything in that will be no
[1:25:30] more sin but yet they'll have rulers and
[1:25:33] so forth in the cities when everything
[1:25:35] will be carried on in the way of eternal
[1:25:38] life so see if we can walk in the way of
[1:25:41] eternal life now we're not going to walk
[1:25:43] in it over there but if we can rule now
[1:25:46] in your life will rule over there hit
[1:25:49] your head that's all of the Bible's that
[1:25:50] every believer is a king and a priest if
[1:25:53] we can rule over sit down we'll surely
[1:25:56] rule over others there and not that
[1:25:58] that's our motivation our motivation is
[1:26:01] the police Christ but Christ wants
[1:26:03] somebody in drop statement Christ wants
[1:26:05] to give the world blessed are the meek
[1:26:07] for what they hair of the earth Christ
[1:26:09] was to give the earth to a deep way you
[1:26:12] can trust how to do you that can be real
[1:26:14] kings and reign in righteousness amen
[1:26:17] look at 60 of ramesses
[1:26:20] and all the Earth's who come to this
[1:26:22] city Jerusalem and she'll bring the
[1:26:24] glory of it in there and the gage will
[1:26:26] not be shut by night because there's
[1:26:28] won't be any night see the gates always
[1:26:31] be open the keys to the earth relation
[1:26:33] 22 bring their honor and glory in the
[1:26:36] city but the bride is in there with the
[1:26:39] lamb
[1:26:40] oh my you see that in there not the
[1:26:44] bride isn't going to be out there
[1:26:45] laboring in the vineyards no no sir
[1:26:51] she's the bride she's the queen of the
[1:26:53] King it's the others that labor out
[1:26:56] there the nation's not the bride in that
[1:27:01] beautiful church the bride are the kings
[1:27:04] and priests and rulers they live in the
[1:27:06] city and they rule over these slavers
[1:27:09] the Bible said the earth will be full of
[1:27:13] nations
[1:27:13] now if church I don't understand that
[1:27:16] I don't it seems like the Holy Ghost
[1:27:18] filled sakes live in the city and all
[1:27:20] the foolish virgin
[1:27:21] that's Mother's Day all the foolish
[1:27:23] virgins fill up the entire earth and

[1:28:05] nations none of us are going to we're
[1:28:08] not trying to
[1:28:09] that's not our desire of his eyes just

[1:28:13] somebody he can trust with his kingdom
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:16] what somebody can trust with the earth
[1:28:19] so as I close here I got one min here
[1:28:23] recall the rewards this I preached us
[1:28:25] twice already I'll preach it back in
[1:28:27] 2009 and I appreciate it last year this
[1:28:31] is really small so I can you know this
[1:28:33] if you want I looked up the word reward
[1:28:35] every time that you tested it and these
[1:28:37] are rewards if you would stand
[1:28:39] persecution or endure temptation you get
[1:28:41] a reward if you give a cup of water in
[1:28:44] the name of Jesus or the name a disciple
[1:28:46] you get a reward if you receive a
[1:28:49] prophet or I just said God will reward
[1:28:51] you I don't know what the reward is
[1:28:53] other than we want eternal life that's
[1:28:54] the main reward praying and secret
[1:28:57] reward giving all of the secret you get
[1:29:00] rewarded planting and watering the
[1:29:02] gospel you're rewarded if you leave
[1:29:05] family members which many of us have
[1:29:07] right or possessions for the sake of God
[1:29:10] God rewards you for that amen if you
[1:29:13] fight the good fight
[1:29:15] keep the faith you'll be reward for you
[1:29:17] the crowd wait for you if you make a
[1:29:20] dinner for those who cannot repay you
[1:29:21] God reward you for that James wonders
[1:29:26] the scripture about pure and undefiled
[1:29:28] religion is visiting the fatherless and
[1:29:30] widow
[1:29:30] was an era fliction got a reward you for
[1:29:32] that if you love your enemies and you
[1:29:38] led to them all I just want to borrow
[1:29:40] your lawnmower arch one of borrowed 20
[1:29:43] bucks if you lend to them and I hope you
[1:29:47] get nothing back you get a reward for
[1:29:49] that hope they don't eat it to be back
[1:29:51] on the Lord your reward that's what our
[1:29:54] hearts need to be changed to ready
[1:29:56] honestly I've got a hard time with that
[1:29:58] either lend somebody something I like to
[1:29:59] get that back but see when we're close
[1:30:03] to Christ in prayer it's different and
[1:30:06] I've had to know recently I've had to do
[1:30:08] that I've given people things out of the
[1:30:11] love of God in my heart and I don't get
[1:30:13] it back but God give me braces say
[1:30:15] that's five because when I gave it to
[1:30:18] them I gave it to them in the name of
[1:30:19] Jesus I gave it as if I was giving that
[1:30:23] to Jesus now it gives from Jesus I don't
[1:30:25] want to back a man that's good out of
[1:30:28] your love being kind to the unthankful
[1:30:31] evil get a reward for that serving God
[1:30:34] willingly get a reward heartily service
[1:30:37] to Lord anything to reward and if you
[1:30:39] diligently seek God get a reward let's
[1:30:41] stand to our feet under you this last
[1:30:43] quote when it comes down to good works
[1:30:46] the worst thing anybody can do is not
[1:30:48] try see we should all try to do we saw
[1:30:52] bush we shall try to find what works in
[1:30:55] our day to do what did God put me on
[1:30:57] this earth but I have to do what am I
[1:30:58] supposed to do we should seek God for
[1:31:01] that right now and then when you find it
[1:31:04] do with all your heart I don't know yeah
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:07] but romance that the worst thing people
[1:31:09] can do is just not try I'm just I can do
[1:31:12] anything that's the worst thing you can
[1:31:15] let man said the Church of Christ
[1:31:17] creature told me about mr. Branum I'd
[1:31:19] rather wear out than rust out and there
[1:31:23] that's a lot of truth I'd rather wear
[1:31:25] out and not in the harness
[1:31:27] that's brother Neville said maybe they
[1:31:29] refuse to have the harness on in other
[1:31:32] words I happen I'd rather have a huge
[1:31:33] burden died if if that murder than had
[1:31:35] no burden at all like Burton to pray for
[1:31:38] people a burden to make clothes for
[1:31:39] people right a burden to give to people
[1:31:41] see kind of a burden preach to people or
[1:31:44] mr. feeble you know whatever your burden
[1:31:46] is have a burden you can't do nothing
[1:31:49] any worse he says that neglect to try so
[1:31:53] I'm going to try right we're going to
[1:31:54] try and do something Lord let us do all
[1:31:57] we can do with what you have to do with
[1:31:58] and the Holy Spirit our tutor we'll
[1:32:00] bring it to the Father here's the belt
[1:32:02] remember brother Ram said the bride has
[1:32:04] not said the Lord or she stands still we
[1:32:08] all set the show program quotes about
[1:32:09] make sure the scripture before you do it
[1:32:12] and then see if God blesses it for
[1:32:16] example when I started preaching I never
[1:32:17] heard a voice I just saw the inside poll
[1:32:21] and now now you know I get we get we get
[1:32:25] testimonies all the time about how the
[1:32:27] preaching helps people today I just hung
[1:32:28] up twelve testimonies of people that
[1:32:30] have emailed me on my wall as a reminder
[1:32:32] to keep making videos these are senators
[1:32:35] video testimonies
[1:32:36] I'll never cut my hair again I'll never
[1:32:38] wear pants again and all these things
[1:32:39] like that you know oh I want to be one
[1:32:42] of those mother amen
[1:32:43] I'm going to be rebaptised the name of
[1:32:45] Jesus Christ he thank me for that mother
[1:32:49] gives me John did you see I put him up
[1:32:53] there to remember that that's my job to
[1:32:57] do I never heard of supernatural I
[1:32:59] prayed and asked God for a sign God gave
[1:33:01] me a sign but that's what I'm saying
[1:33:04] like we can't we can't take this quote
[1:33:06] too far because we're not all prophets
[1:33:08] that see visions right but we have to
[1:33:11] ask God for a sign and God will give us
[1:33:14] the sign then we can know as I said yeah
[1:33:16] and I know your situations definite I
[1:33:19] think this would help you because that's
[1:33:21] what I need to I needed to know what
[1:33:24] God's Will was for my life so first make
[1:33:28] sure it's scriptural for you to do it
[1:33:30] and then see if God blesses it right
[1:33:35] last sighs last time remember the Bible
[1:33:39] says how will we escape damnation if we
[1:33:42] neglect this salvation see the worst
[1:33:44] thing I mentioned you can use neglect it
[1:33:46] just don't leave it look or just leave
[1:33:47] it alone oh I don't know I don't know
[1:33:49] what to do so I'm not you do anything
[1:33:50] for God know do something for guiding to
[1:33:53] good works fill your time be full of
[1:33:55] good works like
[1:33:56] gorgeous if that's all you can do is
[1:33:58] bend close and so close that's a lot
