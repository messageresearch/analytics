[19:24] their lives so lord it was a really nice
[19:26] weekend there ephesians 3
[19:36] uh i'll read verse four
[19:39] and five and then we'll all read verse
[19:40] six okay so i'll read four and five by
[19:42] myself and then we'll read verse six
[19:44] together then we'll go to
[19:45] psalm 19. verse four says whereby when
[19:48] you read you may understand my knowledge
[19:51] in the mystery of christ which in other
[19:54] ages was not made known unto the sons of
[19:56] men
[19:57] as it is now revealed unto us holy
[19:59] apostles and prophets
[20:00] by the spirit let's read verse six
[20:03] together ready
[20:04] one two three that the gentiles should
[20:07] be
[20:07] fellow heirs and of the same body
[20:10] and partakers of his promise in
[20:13] christ by the gospel amen let's go to
[20:17] psalm 19 here psalm 19 that will take a
[20:19] few prayer requests
[20:23] i am going to be very careful all the
[20:24] time now but they know what time you got
[20:25] to be out by 8 30
[20:27] yeah okay so maybe a little earlier
[20:38] psalm 19. i've been aiming for 8 to 8 15
[20:44] for a while now i would like to think
[20:48] many of those i hit but
[20:52] based upon everybody's laughing laughing
[20:54] uh
[20:55] but i i i honestly feel like i've hit
[20:58] him pretty good
[21:02] i guess the ones have to take data
[21:06] i know for sure last week we were out at
[21:08] 8 15. i know that for sure
[21:10] i remember right
[21:14] you know it's a joke but it's true i
[21:16] mean we just enter into heavenly places
[21:18] right
[21:18] and then when you start thinking about
[21:19] the holy spirit and all god's done for
[21:21] you like it's so hard to just
[21:23] i mean you don't you don't think about
[21:24] closing you know uh
[21:26] so you know we laugh about it but it's
[21:29] so true you just enter into another
[21:31] realm
[21:32] you know the spiritual mind that mind is
[21:34] christ that's what the bible says we
[21:36] have the mind of christ so
[21:38] it's just a joy to enter that mind as
[21:40] often as possible
[21:41] at least three times a week that's a
[21:42] real blessing and of course numerous
[21:44] times throughout the week as well
[21:46] psalm 19. let's go there beautiful
[21:48] scripture here let's read verses
[21:50] 13 and 14 all of us together on three
[21:52] one two
[21:53] three keep back thy servant also
[21:56] from presumptuous sins let them not have
[22:00] dominion over me then shall i be
[22:04] upright and i shall be innocent from the
[22:07] great transgression
[22:09] let the words of my mouth and the
[22:12] meditation
[22:12] of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o
[22:16] lord my strength and my redeemer praise
[22:20] god
[22:21] just remain standing just for a moment
[22:22] just want to announce brother cam
[22:25] uh his wife julia had the baby today
[22:28] on genevieve's birthday so it's
[22:31] genevieve's birthday today let's give
[22:32] her a round of applause god bless you
[22:33] genevieve
[22:36] want to show everybody your three she
[22:38] had to like use two she had to use
[22:39] another hand to hold up three fingers so
[22:42] she's three today so we're so thankful
[22:44] for genevieve what a blessing she's been
[22:46] to our family
[22:47] uh but uh cam had another boy so now
[22:50] they have four boys one girl
[22:53] his name's judah michael smith judah
[22:56] michael smith they're really hoping for
[22:59] a girl
[23:00] that god has a way god has a plan and
[23:04] we're thankful for that but
[23:05] poor uh shouldn't say poor but you know
[23:07] sad briella you know go out to pray for
[23:09] her
[23:11] but let's do keep uh you know julia in
[23:13] prayer she recovers
[23:15] and then we saw brother mike he's the
[23:16] one in the wheelchair he was shot in
[23:18] 2009
[23:19] by the cop and it was unjust but uh
[23:22] won the lawsuit anyways uh he's in a lot
[23:25] of pain he couldn't even come to the
[23:27] sunday morning service because he's in
[23:28] so much pain
[23:29] he gets a lot of infections so let's
[23:31] remember him in prayer
[23:33] we had we laid hands on him i fasted all
[23:34] day saturday and pray for him and
[23:36] it just he seems to say like god is
[23:40] allowing it to humble him
[23:41] and then be able to minister to other
[23:43] people he says here's a man in a
[23:45] wheelchair he says he goes into all
[23:46] these stores like lowe's and home depot
[23:49] and he prays for sick people often and
[23:51] they get well right there in the store
[23:54] and yet god keeps him in that wheelchair
[23:56] so it's really
[23:58] it's really interesting how god does it
[24:00] many times god's strength is made
[24:02] perfect in our weakness
[24:04] but we're not going to stop praying for
[24:05] that brother because he's such a
[24:07] wonderful man of god

[31:20] the lord
[31:21] and uh try to lay this little thought in
[31:25] so yeah we had some great services there
[31:26] uh saturday night i preached outside
[31:28] just in the woods that everybody had
[31:29] their you know
[31:30] their camp seats around and uh just
[31:33] preached and it was really good
[31:34] uh nobody came up for prayer we just
[31:36] prayed for brother mike because i was
[31:38] preaching to the young people and i kind
[31:39] of preached a sermon i preached last
[31:40] wednesday night about
[31:42] being an example so i went through all
[31:44] those six six traits where paul says you
[31:46] should be an example in all six of those
[31:48] traits
[31:49] uh so the people really somebody told me
[31:51] afterwards he said every time you come
[31:53] i feel like i need to repent and get
[31:54] right with god i said that's good
[31:57] that's what the holy spirit said jesus
[31:59] said the holy spirit will convict you of
[32:00] sin
[32:02] so i appreciate that and then sunday
[32:04] morning we had a great service i think i
[32:05] preached for two hours and
[32:06] i just i said well we only have one
[32:08] service i'm going to preach the whole
[32:09] thought and
[32:10] a couple people came up for prayer for
[32:11] some serious needs there and
[32:14] we just put our faith in the lord one
[32:16] was like a marriage need and another one
[32:18] was actually a couple
[32:20] in fornication and i told them they need
[32:22] to separate you know they can't live
[32:23] like that
[32:24] and then the cam would guide them and
[32:26] things like that so it was really great
[32:27] they both were weeping and crying and
[32:29] praising the lord it was just a really
[32:30] wonderful atmosphere there and uh just i
[32:33] think i preached on uh only be strong
[32:35] and very courageous on sunday morning so
[32:37] i preached that joshua series
[32:39] and then i ended that thought with the
[32:40] best is yet to come i finished with that
[32:42] thought
[32:43] because that's what it is the best is
[32:44] yet to come praise god we're
[32:46] just gonna say like this we're just
[32:47] getting started
[32:49] jesus is just getting started in our
[32:51] lives praise god
[32:52] each stage is always gonna get better
[32:54] praise god because we're going to see
[32:55] the fruits of all of our labors
[32:57] down through the years like you know we
[32:59] look at how malachi
[33:00] lydia and our our older ones have grown
[33:03] up and look
[33:03] look at the gifts in their lives and the
[33:06] sweet spirits that they have and the
[33:07] love
[33:08] for god they have i think wow i really
[33:10] wouldn't want to go back now
[33:13] although i do miss those great younger
[33:15] years you know but
[33:17] it's true god makes every stage better
[33:19] than the last
[33:21] i even had some grandparents sitting up
[33:22] there i said is that right grandparents
[33:23] and they said amen
[33:25] they said being a grandparent was better
[33:26] than even being a parent
[33:29] because there's no greater joy than to
[33:31] see your children and grandchildren
[33:32] walking the truth so
[33:34] we just had a wonderful time and then we
[33:35] had a minister's meeting
[33:37] right after the service and that was
[33:38] good we just talked about the seven
[33:39] thunders it was really nice
[33:41] uh ministers mean drove home got home
[33:43] about 9 15 on sunday night so
[33:45] thank you for your prayers it was a
[33:47] wonderful time in the lord
[33:48] so let's look here i'll try to set my
[33:50] timer here let's maybe try about 45
[33:52] minutes
[33:53] i'll try by the grace of the lord
[33:56] and we'll look to this thought here
[33:57] tonight i do believe that's all the
[33:59] announcements
[34:00] we don't really have any special
[34:01] meetings to the end of the month and i
[34:03] think i'm just going to preach all those
[34:04] and we'll do like a song service one of
[34:06] those
[34:07] and like a testimony meaning just with
[34:09] our church
[34:10] and then for july i'm trying to get
[34:12] brother randy out here i talked to him
[34:13] on the phone yesterday
[34:15] i could hear the planes flying over
[34:16] because he was on break you know
[34:18] at the airport or what yeah the airport
[34:21] or he's an air traffic control guy
[34:23] and he's like okay i'll send you some
[34:25] dates so i'm still waiting on the dates
[34:26] he's going to send me some dates in
[34:27] august
[34:28] or september but i told him my brother
[34:29] dick's coming we have brother dick's
[34:30] coming in september
[34:32] for labor day so he'll preach a friday
[34:34] saturday sunday so
[34:35] just kind of keep maybe mark that in
[34:36] your minds
[34:38] i'm really excited to have him it's been
[34:40] a couple years since we've had him so
[34:42] i'm really looking forward to having
[34:43] brother dig so i'm trying to get brother
[34:45] randy for july uh i think i'll take a
[34:48] break for august because i like to take
[34:49] a break every other month
[34:50] and then i'll try to get brother brooks
[34:52] and brother cam maybe for
[34:54] october or november i want to try to get
[34:55] them up here
[34:57] and i'll be like having brother simon
[34:58] come in from time to time because he
[35:00] lives so close and it's not
[35:01] he don't have to get a hotel you know
[35:02] it's not expensive for him to come and
[35:05] uh we can have enough finances for the
[35:06] church and everything so
[35:08] trying to do that and uh i just try to
[35:11] balance everything by the grace of the
[35:12] lord so
[35:13] okay enough on that let's get to the
[35:14] word of god here so we've been looking
[35:16] at this thought this is part six on this
[35:18] mystery
[35:19] now to us church this is not very uh
[35:21] mysterious but it would have been
[35:23] in the days of the bible days because
[35:26] there was a major segregation right
[35:28] there's a major segregation between jew
[35:31] and everybody else
[35:32] god's people were a holy priesthood and
[35:35] they didn't have any they tried not to
[35:37] have any contact with gentile or
[35:40] samaritan right
[35:41] they don't want any contact with them
[35:43] because it would defile them
[35:44] and make them unclean so today we kind
[35:48] of see the fruits of this mystery
[35:50] because we have caucasian asian black
[35:53] we have like a great variety today and
[35:56] we counted a joy we counted
[35:58] a privilege but if you were a jew you
[36:00] couldn't enjoy that if you're still
[36:01] under
[36:02] the old covenant because you would say
[36:04] well these gentiles they
[36:06] they eat that they eat that they eat
[36:07] pork and all these things
[36:10] but it's such a joy we're seeing the
[36:11] fruits of all paul's laborers today
[36:13] amen two thousand years later we got a
[36:16] bouquet bride here
[36:18] amen it's just beautiful to see that we
[36:21] are
[36:22] we're the fruits of all paul's labors
[36:24] remember they didn't know this for ages
[36:26] and generations
[36:27] abraham was 1500 years before christ
[36:30] and that was really when they started
[36:32] the separation right so for 1500 years
[36:34] it was always worth
[36:36] more holy physically we can't have any
[36:38] fellowship unless you
[36:39] go through all this process but then
[36:42] after peter saw the vision three times
[36:44] the sheet came down
[36:45] he said not so lord and after he seen
[36:47] the holy ghost fall he said
[36:48] who was i that i could withstand let's
[36:51] not call
[36:52] filthy what god has cleansed praise god
[36:54] amen
[36:55] and that satisfied every holy ghost
[36:57] filled person amen
[36:59] hallelujah so anyone that's born again
[37:01] today will be satisfied well as long as
[37:03] you have an experience
[37:04] like the day of pentecost welcome in
[37:06] you're a part of god's family amen
[37:09] as long as you've acted like that as
[37:11] long as you've lived like you've been
[37:13] touched by the holy spirit
[37:14] and you have the fire of god dwelling in
[37:16] you welcome to the family
[37:19] amen that's why we say welcome to this
[37:22] church
[37:22] as long as you're bored again praise god
[37:24] if you're not you'll get born again if
[37:26] you stay long enough amen
[37:28] by faith we believe that because if you
[37:31] sit around the fire long enough
[37:32] praise god it's going to burn you up
[37:34] it's going to consume you
[37:36] because our god is a consuming fire amen
[37:39] that's right it's true church that's the
[37:41] reality
[37:42] and so we're thankful that we live in
[37:45] this day where we can see
[37:47] how god has brought together every
[37:49] nationality
[37:50] and this right here is a foretaste of
[37:52] heaven
[37:55] this is a just like the holy ghost
[37:56] baptism is a down payment
[37:58] that's like a foretaste of the full
[38:00] payment praise god
[38:02] so is our fellowship with every creed
[38:04] when i create
[38:05] every color uh every nation every tongue
[38:08] it's a it's a conglomeration it's a
[38:10] blending together
[38:11] it's a weaving together or building
[38:13] together of
[38:15] a family of god and god has all
[38:18] all families of all nations everybody
[38:20] together everybody in one accord
[38:22] and they're all worshiping him praise
[38:24] god
[38:25] hallelujah so we're thankful now go to
[38:28] ephesians 2
[38:30] uh paul gives us two images
[38:34] of what this looks like one is a
[38:38] physical human body and then the other
[38:42] is a temple so paul gives us uh
[38:46] these two illustrations and i just
[38:49] thought of something
[38:50] i'm just looking up real quick maybe i
[38:52] can show a picture
[38:55] years and years ago i had this uh it's
[38:57] been probably
[38:58] four or five years here so why are you
[39:00] turning the ephesians 2
[39:03] maybe i can pull that up there
[39:06] uh you might remember it
[39:10] yeah there it is uh so can you pull this
[39:12] up here real quick can you switch over
[39:14] to my phone
[39:16] this is just a artist rendition of the
[39:18] inscription we'll get to this in a
[39:19] moment on the temple you might remember
[39:21] this
[39:21] when i preached on this why is that so
[39:23] tiny
[39:25] okay that's better yeah that's better
[39:27] now you can't read that i can't read it
[39:28] either
[39:29] but we'll get to in just a moment now in
[39:32] ephesians 2
[39:33] the first 10 verses of ephesians 2 are
[39:35] some of the most memorable and beautiful
[39:37] verses in the bible
[39:38] so let's have some readers there lydia
[39:40] malachi can you get those and then we'll
[39:41] go to nature
[39:42] so lydia uh malachi why don't you start
[39:44] ephesians 2
[39:45] since you got your bible there sorry i
[39:47] didn't mean this i'm just always
[39:48] surprising my children so
[39:50] it's gonna you'll see it'll help you
[39:51] later on in life you know
[39:53] like whenever somebody surprises you
[39:54] you'll be okay that's normal my dad
[39:56] always surprises me
[40:00] i guess i'm just so happy i'm gonna
[40:02] laughing a lot tonight
[40:04] ephesians two lydia can you do one
[40:06] through five then maokai six through ten
[40:08] please
[40:22] yes
[40:36] is
[40:44] amen is that beautiful some of the most
[40:46] beautiful language
[40:48] in the new testament is about this
[40:50] mystery
[40:52] because just like the gentiles were they
[40:54] were cut off
[40:55] from the hebrew the hebrew religion
[40:58] so paul says we were all dead but jesus
[41:02] has come around and raised up a dead
[41:04] body
[41:04] amen praise god we were most of us have
[41:07] never seen that i've never seen
[41:08] resurrection as far as that way
[41:11] uh my we have some friends that have
[41:13] brother brooks and brother craig and
[41:14] different ones have seen the dead you
[41:15] know
[41:16] shortly after they died come back to
[41:17] life oh yeah you've seen it thanks to
[41:18] the hospital
[41:20] right uh you're with your dad right he
[41:21] passed away but then they they brought
[41:23] him back right
[41:24] is that right did they shock him
[41:25] [Music]
[41:29] on the ambulance was that right okay
[41:32] okay i thought well maybe i gotta
[41:33] confuse sorry about that
[41:34] yeah the ambulance okay thank you
[41:37] and uh so paul gives illustration you
[41:40] were dead and you were walking on a
[41:42] course of wrath
[41:44] so the path you were walking on was
[41:46] leading to god's wrath
[41:47] but jesus came along and raised you up
[41:49] from the dead
[41:50] and put you on a path of grace amen
[41:54] so you're walking on a path of wrath and
[41:56] now you're on a path
[41:58] of grace here and he says god did this
[42:01] because he was rich in mercy
[42:03] and he had great love for you praise god
[42:07] so see we have so much to be thankful
[42:09] for tonight it was god's great love
[42:11] that pulled us off of the path of wrath
[42:14] and onto the path of grace amen
[42:16] it's his love that did that we were dead
[42:19] in sins
[42:20] and he's rich in mercy with great love
[42:23] amen
[42:23] some of the most beautiful language and
[42:25] he's talking about us he's talking about
[42:27] gentiles that were headed for hell but
[42:30] by god's grace and his mercy now we're
[42:32] headed to heaven amen
[42:34] what a blessing praise god amen malachi
[42:38] 6 to 10. now remember i like verse 10 we
[42:40] are his workmanship he's still working
[42:42] on us
[42:42] so go ahead maokai six to
[42:57] for ten things through faith is the gift
[43:01] of god
[43:03] not at work so we are his partnership
[43:07] created in christ
[43:13] amen praise god beautiful so see that's
[43:15] what we're talking about verse 6
[43:17] he's we're in heavenly places many times
[43:20] right that's why we can't think about
[43:21] the things of the world we can't
[43:22] meditate on them too long because
[43:24] we feel ourselves coming out of those
[43:25] heavenly places right and we've got to
[43:27] get back to the word back to the
[43:28] wonderful things of god right
[43:30] that's why we lose track of time it's
[43:32] because of heavenly places praise god
[43:34] right and then now look in the ages that
[43:37] come he's going to
[43:38] i remember i ended the sermon on this a
[43:39] while back he's going to take
[43:42] ages and show us his great grace for
[43:45] ages
[43:46] right think about that we live our lives
[43:48] you know we spent you know what 20 or 30
[43:50] years listen to preaching you know me
[43:51] i was raised in church so 40 years but
[43:55] that's just one lifetime but we're going
[43:56] to spend ages
[43:58] thinking about his exceeding rich
[44:01] grace and kindness oh my i can't wait to
[44:04] experience it
[44:05] i want to see all god's kindness to paul
[44:08] i want to see when he was shipwrecked
[44:10] three times and saved each time
[44:13] i want to see that i want to see we're
[44:14] going to go through all the kindness
[44:16] all that he showed to peter right peter
[44:19] paul and peter up out of the water
[44:20] that's why we like sight and sound it
[44:22] kind of gives us a preview of what
[44:23] that's going to be like
[44:24] got to give us a little preview and
[44:26] jonah on the belly of a whale think
[44:28] about
[44:29] it's going to take ages for god to show
[44:31] us all of his kindness
[44:33] all the great things he's done no this
[44:36] fellow sleep didn't okay sorry
[44:39] and the church we're looking forward to
[44:40] that this is what the scripture says
[44:42] so his grace is so amazing it's going to
[44:44] take years and years and years
[44:47] to really fully understand all that he's
[44:49] done for us
[44:50] amen oh god what a blessing and we're
[44:53] saved by grace
[44:54] no man will be able to boast on that day
[44:56] and say well i saved myself jesus
[44:58] no man can boast for salvation praise
[45:00] god
[45:01] right because we know for salvation it's
[45:05] all by grace
[45:06] now we know there's a judgment seat of
[45:08] christ where rewards are given out
[45:11] that's where we're not we're not
[45:12] boasting on what we've done but we're
[45:14] actually saying lord here's what i've
[45:15] done
[45:17] right like the man with five he said i
[45:18] invested i've got five more
[45:21] so see there will be a judgment where we
[45:23] get to show the lord now he already
[45:25] knows but we get to say in front of the
[45:26] saints here's what i did for you lord
[45:29] now that doesn't save us but it shows we
[45:31] were faithful with the assignment
[45:34] we listened to god's assignment we read
[45:36] the instructions
[45:37] we kept it we invested in it and lord
[45:40] here's what we've done for you praise
[45:41] god
[45:42] amen but we will always remember that
[45:45] we didn't start with that talent god
[45:47] gave us that talent praise god
[45:49] the talent was god's to begin with amen
[45:51] praise god
[45:52] so we know reason to brag it's just me
[45:54] lord you gave me this five
[45:55] i invested in it and look it brought
[45:58] back five more
[45:59] praise god but see there'll be no
[46:01] bragging on that day on either day
[46:03] praise god
[46:04] especially not for salvation now the
[46:06] bible said you're god's workmanship
[46:08] which means a product
[46:10] or a fabric a thing that is made you're
[46:13] a product
[46:14] of god god has made you like a fabric
[46:17] he's
[46:18] weaved your life together the bible said
[46:19] he's woven you in your mother's womb
[46:21] amen hallelujah he's weaved you together
[46:25] in your mother's womb
[46:26] and he's created you for something like
[46:28] lily bought fabric the other day right
[46:30] and she started cutting it she's making
[46:31] this little dress for a 4-h project
[46:33] i saw her cutting it she got the pattern
[46:35] and got it all that's what god did
[46:37] but man said all of humanity was a pat
[46:39] or was this fabric
[46:40] but you were the bride part amen
[46:45] so the part that lydia's keeping that's
[46:47] us amen
[46:48] i don't know we're the part god wants to
[46:50] use amen
[46:52] he's got certain works that he's gonna
[46:53] have us do praise god
[46:55] where's workmanship we're a part of his
[46:57] family praise god
[46:58] we were dead but now we're alive in
[47:00] christ jesus amen
[47:02] we were dead up on the shelf but god has
[47:04] pulled us down off the shelf and he's
[47:06] he's measured out the pattern this is
[47:07] what i want for my lair laodicean church
[47:09] age bride
[47:10] amen he's gonna look like this from
[47:12] akron and and from
[47:14] albion and and napoleon and all these
[47:17] patterns i'm cutting them out
[47:18] i'm gonna use them and make a big
[47:20] beautiful demonstration of my power amen
[47:24] i'm glad to be a part of that praise god
[47:27] you are god's workmanship you're god's
[47:30] fabric
[47:31] and he wants to do something with you
[47:34] he's weaving your life he's i'll say
[47:35] this
[47:36] he's woven you in your mother's womb but
[47:37] he's weaving the events of your life
[47:39] together to bring out a testimony
[47:42] like i shared your testimony on sunday
[47:43] sister naomi i hope that was okay
[47:45] remember you last couple sundays ago
[47:47] you're in the car there and you were
[47:48] saying how
[47:49] you were so thankful you could come to a
[47:50] church where you'd have to worry about
[47:52] what clothes you wore well i shared that
[47:54] at cam church and that was the highlight
[47:56] of the sermon
[47:58] sister started screaming and praising
[48:00] the lord that was the highlight so thank
[48:01] you for sharing that
[48:03] that was when the most people were
[48:04] screaming and crying and praising the
[48:06] lord
[48:07] because they must have experienced some
[48:08] type of you know in other churches
[48:10] they've been to they've experienced that
[48:12] denominational thing where the rich are
[48:13] better than the poor
[48:16] right where church isn't about jesus
[48:18] it's about your clothes or it's about
[48:20] your group that you're in
[48:21] but here at our church there's only one
[48:23] group and that's the jesus group
[48:25] amen praise god and there's no
[48:27] difference between
[48:29] our incomes or anything like that we got
[48:31] all things in common praise god
[48:34] and i say like this i'll say it again if
[48:35] you lack anything let me know
[48:38] if you lack anything we should have
[48:39] enough to take care of it praise god now
[48:41] we all got
[48:42] we all got uh debts we got to pay well
[48:43] most of us maybe not all of us
[48:46] i'm almost done with one of them but i
[48:47] just got two more
[48:49] but you know we all got things we have
[48:50] to take care of but
[48:52] if the bible said they had all things in
[48:54] common so that means enough food
[48:56] shelter and everything like that if
[48:58] someone doesn't have that they need to
[48:59] let me know so i can help them out
[49:01] but i trust the holy spirit will help us
[49:02] to well will make me known as well
[49:04] as well the holy spirit will help me
[49:06] know what the people need if there's
[49:07] anyone that lacks anything
[49:09] so see we're thankful for that we're
[49:11] we're not interested in the
[49:12] human things we're interested in
[49:14] everybody loving each other being free
[49:16] in the holy spirit
[49:17] for where the spirit lord is there's
[49:19] liberty amen
[49:20] amen that was very highlight sister of
[49:23] the service where the most people were
[49:24] up shouting and praising the lord
[49:26] it seemed like that really meant a need
[49:28] there where people were thankful for the
[49:30] freedom of the holy spirit
[49:32] amen a great blessing that was for sure
[49:35] uh so you are god's fabric god is gonna
[49:37] weave events of your life together
[49:40] for a testimony like that queen of the
[49:41] south her life was just weaved together
[49:44] she had to know that idols don't talk to
[49:45] you
[49:46] and she had to hear then about solomon
[49:48] she had to travel across the desert
[49:50] that was the very fabric of her
[49:52] testimony god was weaving that together
[49:54] because he's going to use that testimony
[49:56] against those in jesus day who wouldn't
[49:58] even travel across the county to hear
[50:00] the preaching
[50:01] but she traveled across the desert amen
[50:04] and jesus said that queen of the south
[50:06] shall judge you
[50:07] praise god because a greater than
[50:09] solomon is here amen
[50:11] see her life had to be weaved together
[50:14] where she had to have this major
[50:16] obstacle but she had to overcome it and
[50:18] god is going to use that
[50:20] uh because she was god's workmanship
[50:22] god's going to use that on the day of
[50:24] uh judgment so if my hardest thing in
[50:27] life is i have a big family
[50:29] and i have a small church and i get
[50:31] criticized a lot and i get rejected
[50:33] if that's my biggest trial so far praise
[50:35] god let it be
[50:37] then god's gonna use me on the day of
[50:38] judgment for people that had excuses
[50:40] well our church was too small
[50:42] or my family was too big they're gonna
[50:44] use all these excuses god's gonna need
[50:46] somebody to raise up
[50:47] who overcame praise god i'll be happy to
[50:50] be one of those overcomers amen
[50:53] in other words we won't let any excuse
[50:55] keep us from doing god's will for our
[50:57] lives amen
[50:59] hallelujah there's going to be no
[51:01] excuses church
[51:03] there's no excuses for us you know i
[51:06] heard a good thought let me just share
[51:07] this in acts 17
[51:09] the bible said god has determined the
[51:11] bound of your habitation
[51:13] that you might seek after him and feel
[51:15] after him and worship him
[51:18] that means god is determined everywhere
[51:21] where every person was ever going to
[51:22] live
[51:24] so that means and then the bible said
[51:26] the eyes of the lord run to and fro
[51:28] around the entire earth to find someone
[51:31] that would fear the lord
[51:33] in other words and this thought came to
[51:35] me there's going to be no one on the day
[51:37] of judgment that could say well god
[51:39] didn't
[51:40] god didn't seek after me it's going to
[51:42] be impossible
[51:43] because god's going to tell him no i
[51:44] placed you here so you can hear from
[51:46] this missionary or i place you here
[51:48] so i can show you a dream or a vision
[51:50] god is positionally placed all of us
[51:52] that means church
[51:53] we were meant to be together praise god
[51:56] amen
[51:58] god has determined the bounds of your
[52:00] habitation if god wanted you somewhere
[52:02] else
[52:02] you would have been somewhere else that
[52:04] helped us that helps us to be content
[52:06] praise god
[52:08] paul said one thing i've learned is to
[52:10] be content
[52:13] right content with our lot in life
[52:17] and then in our lot in life invest
[52:19] everything we got for jesus
[52:21] all the gifts all the tales just give
[52:23] jesus everything we got
[52:24] be an overcomer and god will weave
[52:27] together
[52:28] the story of our life to be a witness
[52:31] for the believers and against the
[52:32] unbelievers on the day of judgment
[52:36] i wonder how many people our family is
[52:38] going to condemn
[52:39] if that had abortions
[52:42] well we had too many kids we had to have
[52:44] an abortion god will raise this up
[52:47] say well we could do it i was a middle i
[52:50] was a middle class person i didn't have
[52:51] millions of dollars
[52:53] you know we get hand-me-downs for some
[52:55] of the kids you know
[52:57] what's wrong with that nothing's wrong
[52:58] with that that's no excuse to take a
[53:00] life
[53:02] see i wonder how many you think about
[53:03] your life many of the struggles you've
[53:04] been through like brother amen you've
[53:06] been kicked out of your house so god's
[53:07] going to raise up people that they got
[53:08] kicked out
[53:09] and they fell away but you're going to
[53:11] be an overcomer
[53:13] despite being kicked out i fell right in
[53:16] the hands of jesus
[53:19] you might have got kicked out of your
[53:20] natural house but god let you in the
[53:23] house amen
[53:24] the house of faith hallelujah and you
[53:27] can see that with everybody's like i
[53:28] said on the the
[53:30] the youth service my dad left me but
[53:32] instead i got three dads
[53:34] simon cam and sam that's how i looked at
[53:37] it
[53:38] after my dad left i really got three
[53:40] dads because they would wrestle with me
[53:42] fight with me you know
[53:43] whatever we'd share clothes
[53:46] you know we'd wrestle and argue and you
[53:48] know we play together too you know
[53:51] but it depends it all depends how you
[53:53] look at it
[53:56] there's no reason to ever walk away from
[53:58] god
[53:59] because god wants to use that as a
[54:01] testimony
[54:02] to turn it around
[54:06] like why am i so far away from my family
[54:08] why is naomi so far away from her family
[54:11] like we miss our family terribly we're
[54:12] only three hours away she's a whole
[54:14] ocean away from her family
[54:16] well there's got to be a reason for that
[54:18] there is
[54:19] she's got to overcome that we've got to
[54:21] overcome that we've got to overcome
[54:23] feeling alone
[54:25] but there's something god wants us to do
[54:27] now the opposite is like perry green
[54:29] perry green when he was growing up he
[54:31] never had
[54:33] a steady home because his parents were
[54:34] in the military so his dad he said he
[54:36] was never into school longer than six
[54:37] months
[54:38] his whole life six months he never even
[54:41] finished his school year
[54:43] so he was just used to traveling but
[54:44] then that fit him later in life
[54:46] when after brother adam left he passed
[54:48] her for a while but then he spent
[54:50] the last few decades of his life just
[54:51] traveling around the world
[54:53] from place and he he said i never met a
[54:56] stranger
[54:58] because as a child he just meet new
[55:00] friends make he knew how to make friends
[55:02] so god made him a missionary now after
[55:05] being a pastor
[55:07] so see you you could you could feel bad
[55:09] for yourself well i never really
[55:10] got to make any friends or you can take
[55:12] the opposite and just
[55:14] everybody becomes your friend
[55:17] you see we you see god is weaving our
[55:19] lives he's working something in you
[55:21] praise god
[55:23] he's working a certain kind of a
[55:25] testament i feel good tonight praise god
[55:27] i feel thankful that god is working in
[55:29] our lives amen
[55:31] we're the very fabric of his ministry
[55:33] right of his life
[55:35] we're the fabric that he's weaving
[55:36] together to form this great flag or this
[55:39] great banner of christianity
[55:41] can i say like that ma
[55:46] well verse 11
[55:50] wherefore remember that ye being in the
[55:51] times past gentiles in the flesh
[55:53] who are called to uncircumcision by that
[55:55] which is called the circumcision in the
[55:57] flesh made by hands
[55:58] that at that time now look at this
[55:59] church look how low we were look at
[56:02] verse 12. this is
[56:03] this really brings us in a humble
[56:05] condition here
[56:06] that at that time ye were without christ
[56:09] can you imagine where you'd be without
[56:10] christ
[56:12] you would have filthy minds filthy lives
[56:16] no holiness no judgment no i mean you
[56:19] just let anything come that comes
[56:21] instead of shutting the door to satan
[56:22] you just let satan in more and more
[56:24] where would you be
[56:26] i told the church i'd probably be
[56:28] addicted to drugs i'd be a thug with
[56:30] those
[56:30] sports jerseys on with my hat sideways
[56:33] and living still
[56:34] at my mom's house playing video games
[56:36] smoking and drinking and
[56:37] that's what i beat can you imagine but
[56:40] look what grace has done for me praise
[56:42] god
[56:44] what grace has done amen i've been
[56:47] living with my friends you know
[56:48] five four or five friends living
[56:49] together
[56:52] lord knows what else i would have been
[56:53] awful things that's the only thing as i
[56:54] could mention probably what i would have
[56:56] been doing
[56:57] because of sin but look you were without
[56:59] christ you're aliens from the
[57:01] commonwealth of israel
[57:02] and strangers from the covenants of
[57:04] promise you had no promises
[57:06] you had no hope
[57:10] and without god in the world can you
[57:12] imagine many people
[57:14] walk through this entire life this
[57:15] entire life without any hope
[57:19] we were without hope now don't get me
[57:21] wrong we said earlier god is searching
[57:23] and trying to encourage he's still
[57:25] striving with man he's trying to give
[57:27] them hope
[57:28] now i even believe this i believe god
[57:30] can use some of those
[57:31] uh televangelist preachers sometimes to
[57:35] just give people hope
[57:37] just some hope right now if they really
[57:41] love god they'll want more of god and
[57:42] they just they won't stop with that
[57:44] but there's a lot of testimonies they
[57:45] have of they just offer hope that
[57:47] there's hope in jesus there's hope
[57:49] there's
[57:50] there's a possibility of things changing
[57:52] oh my hallelujah the bible said there's
[57:54] such possibilities
[57:55] the bible said the early apostles turned
[57:58] the world upside down
[57:59] praise god in other words jesus can turn
[58:02] your entire world
[58:03] upside down praise god things will fall
[58:06] out of place and they'll just get all
[58:08] uh seemingly completely different that's
[58:11] what he does he just changes the entire
[58:13] scene amen
[58:15] when he comes into a life he changes it
[58:17] upside down praise god
[58:19] from darkness to from no hope
[58:22] from hopeless to hopeful we have a great
[58:25] hope church
[58:27] we have a great hope you probably know
[58:30] this
[58:30] most churches are still believing for a
[58:31] revival i'm talking about denominational
[58:33] most churches are still believing for a
[58:35] nationwide revival
[58:37] they're hoping for that but our hope's
[58:38] not in that our only hope is in the
[58:40] rapture praise god
[58:42] praise god because we know judgment's on
[58:44] the way 60 million abortions
[58:46] and that's that's that's just abortion
[58:48] what about all the murders and
[58:50] everything else going on and the drug
[58:51] addiction and the adulteries and the
[58:53] abominations that's just one
[58:55] avenue we know judgment's coming and so
[58:58] they have a false hope
[58:59] but we have a hope the hope is the
[59:01] return of the messiah
[59:03] the snatching away of his wife amen to
[59:05] rescue her
[59:06] from the judgment of the trumpets and
[59:09] the vials
[59:10] thank god he's going to rescue his wife
[59:12] amen
[59:13] she's not appointed around but she's
[59:15] appointed to salvation through jesus
[59:17] christ
[59:18] amen hallelujah
[59:21] but the world has no hope because
[59:23] they've turned down hope
[59:26] they've turned down god they've turned
[59:27] down the promises but what did what did
[59:28] it verse 13
[59:30] blood did it but now in christ jesus
[59:34] ye who sometimes were far off
[59:37] are made nigh by the blood of christ
[59:41] amen amen hallelujah afar off
[59:46] we were way far away from the promises
[59:49] but now
[59:50] we're brought nigh to jesus and that's
[59:53] why i put that picture up there i think
[59:54] i'll finally get to that you probably
[59:56] remember
[59:58] verse 14 says he's our peace he's broken
[1:00:01] down one and has broken down the middle
[1:00:03] wall partition between us
[1:00:05] so this was the inscription on herod's
[1:00:07] temple they had the gentile court then
[1:00:10] the court of the jewish women then the
[1:00:11] court of the men
[1:00:12] and then the holy place and the holiest
[1:00:14] of holies and herod's temple
[1:00:16] so this was the inscription right right
[1:00:17] before you entered in the court of the
[1:00:19] jewish women
[1:00:20] and the inscription says any gentile
[1:00:23] that enters in will be immediately
[1:00:24] killed
[1:00:26] right so any gentile living in the days
[1:00:29] of jesus
[1:00:29] they saw this that's as far as they
[1:00:31] could go
[1:00:33] right so when jesus taught on solomon's
[1:00:35] porch i believe it was in the court of
[1:00:37] the women further in
[1:00:38] so the gentiles couldn't hear him
[1:00:40] teaching there
[1:00:42] and it was death so they looked up this
[1:00:43] and said it's death
[1:00:45] for a gentile to come in there can you
[1:00:46] imagine a gentile that really loved god
[1:00:48] that's as this is as close as they could
[1:00:50] get they could come up here and they
[1:00:51] could try to listen in and hear jesus
[1:00:53] talking
[1:00:54] that's as close as they could get to god
[1:00:56] as they possibly could
[1:00:57] they were just trying to get close to
[1:00:59] the promises but then jesus comes around
[1:01:02] he sheds his blood and says it is
[1:01:04] finished praise god
[1:01:06] and the bible said the blood of christ
[1:01:08] broke down this middle wall
[1:01:10] so spiritually the wall came down and
[1:01:13] the love of god flooded out to them
[1:01:15] praise god
[1:01:16] amen the mercy of god was kept in but
[1:01:19] when jesus died
[1:01:20] it's as if the walls fell down and grace
[1:01:23] came in like a flood amen
[1:01:26] everybody could receive it then
[1:01:27] everybody could worship god praise god
[1:01:30] because the blood tore down the middle
[1:01:32] wall partition
[1:01:34] there's no difference between jew and
[1:01:36] gentile from asian and caucasian and
[1:01:38] african
[1:01:39] there's no difference we're all one
[1:01:41] blood we're all one faith
[1:01:43] we're all bought by the one blood jesus
[1:01:45] is blood amen
[1:01:47] the one blood paid for all of our sins
[1:01:49] we all fall short of the glory of god no
[1:01:51] matter the skin color
[1:01:53] so it's not about the skin color it's
[1:01:55] about the blood of christ the red blood
[1:01:57] that was shed to pardon us and forgive
[1:01:59] all of our transgressions
[1:02:02] it's not about skin color it's about
[1:02:03] blood color praise god
[1:02:06] it's the red blood of jesus christ that
[1:02:08] was shed isn't it isn't your blood blue
[1:02:10] when it's in your body is that right
[1:02:12] they always say it's blue but when it
[1:02:13] hits the oxygen on the outside then it
[1:02:15] turns red
[1:02:16] because i think sometimes you can see
[1:02:17] blue blue veins right so that proves
[1:02:19] it's
[1:02:21] okay that's what they say i'm not very
[1:02:23] smart i'm not much of a doctor you know
[1:02:25] but then when it hit the oxygen hits it
[1:02:27] then then you can see it turns red
[1:02:29] it's about the color of the blood it was
[1:02:31] shed for us praise god
[1:02:33] the red blood of jesus amen that's
[1:02:36] scarlet cord
[1:02:38] a scarlet cord praise god jesus christ
[1:02:41] broke down this middle wall
[1:02:43] of partition between the jew and gentile
[1:02:49] thank the lord for that so now church
[1:02:52] there's nobody that can say well you
[1:02:54] know
[1:02:56] and this is where message people fall
[1:02:57] short all the time well they try to make
[1:02:59] serving god mysterious like well i know
[1:03:01] things you don't
[1:03:02] know like the third poll i know things
[1:03:05] about the third pole
[1:03:06] because i'm closer to god than you are
[1:03:07] well friend the blood of jesus christ
[1:03:10] broke down the middle of all partition
[1:03:12] they make it sound like well i know
[1:03:13] things you don't know
[1:03:16] but how can you're not closer to god
[1:03:19] right
[1:03:19] if we got the holy ghost the bible said
[1:03:22] the holy ghost guides us
[1:03:23] all amen into all truth praise god
[1:03:27] but you usually find those preachers are
[1:03:28] the ones that fall into sins
[1:03:30] they act like they know something better
[1:03:32] like well i've got a closer relationship
[1:03:34] to god the bible said the blood of jesus
[1:03:36] broke all that down
[1:03:38] they did the jews did have a closer
[1:03:40] relationship to god but not anymore
[1:03:42] praise god
[1:03:42] we can all access the holiest of holies
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:45] the bible said by prayer we enter into
[1:03:48] the holiest of homes behind the bail
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:51] that's why the bible said our hope is
[1:03:53] anchored there praise god
[1:03:55] i've got an anchor for the amen and it's
[1:03:57] up there in heaven praise god
[1:03:59] it's opposite the anchor goes down in
[1:04:00] the earth but now the anchor goes up
[1:04:03] praise god
[1:04:04] and so while the storms are down here
[1:04:06] i'm so anchored in heaven can you see me
[1:04:07] anchored in heaven
[1:04:09] no matter how the storms toss me i'm not
[1:04:12] leaving his heart praise god
[1:04:13] i'm anchored in the holiest of holies
[1:04:15] praise god
[1:04:17] these storms won't move me out of there
[1:04:19] no matter what happens i'm still
[1:04:20] anchored no matter where i go
[1:04:22] i'm always anchored there because that's
[1:04:24] where the blood is right now
[1:04:26] that's where it was accepted in heaven
[1:04:29] that's where the high priest intercedes
[1:04:31] for me praise god
[1:04:33] amen i like that i like to act out more
[1:04:37] sometimes
[1:04:38] i like that no matter where i no matter
[1:04:40] what the devil throws at me can you
[1:04:41] imagine
[1:04:42] you just feel like sometimes you get
[1:04:44] knocked around and knocked out
[1:04:45] the devil tries to knock you out that
[1:04:47] don't change nothing you're still
[1:04:48] anchored to heaven
[1:04:50] well then talked about the chain however
[1:04:52] the chain is brother
[1:04:54] says we're hanging over hell on a chain
[1:04:56] right
[1:04:58] and that's kind of what it is it's kind
[1:04:59] of like that it's kind of you know we go
[1:05:01] through these fiery trials right peter
[1:05:02] says we go through the fiery trial of
[1:05:04] our faith
[1:05:05] but we're anchored to heaven praise god
[1:05:07] we might feel the fire sometimes hotter
[1:05:09] than others
[1:05:09] but we'll always have an anchor behind
[1:05:11] the veil
[1:05:13] glory and church this created
[1:05:17] peace with god
[1:05:20] look at verse 15 abolish in his flesh
[1:05:22] the enmity or the hatred
[1:05:24] between jew and gentile can you imagine
[1:05:26] they used to hate people
[1:05:27] church i don't hate anybody on this
[1:05:28] earth i hate their sin
[1:05:31] right and i hate my sin too
[1:05:34] but there's no there's no nation or
[1:05:36] anyone i hate
[1:05:38] but yet the jews actually hated the
[1:05:40] gentiles because they were so dirty
[1:05:43] but the bible said the blood of christ
[1:05:45] separated us from the enmity
[1:05:48] right it abolished it it did away with
[1:05:50] the hatred there's no more hatred
[1:05:53] even the law of commandments contained
[1:05:54] in ordinances for in
[1:05:56] himself of twain one new man so making
[1:06:00] peace so that's what the blood that's
[1:06:02] how you know jesus is in a church
[1:06:04] there's peace there right if there's if
[1:06:07] there's if there's division in the
[1:06:08] church
[1:06:09] you know they haven't somebody hasn't
[1:06:10] accepted jesus someone hasn't accepted
[1:06:12] the love of jesus because the love of
[1:06:14] jesus makes peace
[1:06:15] where there's hatred and division the
[1:06:17] love of god comes in there
[1:06:19] and there's unity
[1:06:22] that's true that's what the bible says
[1:06:23] creating peace verse 16 that he might
[1:06:26] reconcile both
[1:06:27] unto god in one body by the cross having
[1:06:30] slain
[1:06:30] the enmity thereby my so as
[1:06:34] jesus was slain the hatred was slain
[1:06:37] can't you see that can we all see that
[1:06:39] as they hated jesus and beat him
[1:06:41] that was actually paying for the hatred
[1:06:44] that jews had on gentiles that was
[1:06:45] paying for that
[1:06:46] because the bible said that hatred was
[1:06:48] slain
[1:06:50] right all that all the judgment was
[1:06:52] placed on jesus all the hatred
[1:06:54] from gentiles and jews was put on jesus
[1:06:57] they had to hate him
[1:06:59] so he could make peace with us right
[1:07:02] all that punishment for all the hatred
[1:07:04] had to be paid for
[1:07:06] jesus paid the prize praise god jesus
[1:07:08] paid it all
[1:07:10] all to him i owe praise god
[1:07:13] it's true praise god the enmity was
[1:07:15] slain on the cross as well praise god
[1:07:18] any hatred any any hatred we have
[1:07:20] towards anyone here or anyone in our
[1:07:22] family or
[1:07:22] hopefully nobody here but if we did it
[1:07:24] was already paid for
[1:07:26] it was already slain we just must
[1:07:28] recognize that jesus made a way
[1:07:30] for that healing to take place jesus
[1:07:33] paid for healing
[1:07:34] he took the punishment for hatred and
[1:07:36] now we can be healed by the bomb of the
[1:07:38] holy spirit
[1:07:40] that's what the blood does
[1:07:43] that's why i don't have any i mean i
[1:07:45] have enemies but i don't hate them
[1:07:46] i wish the best for them brother brahm
[1:07:48] said if you enjoy thinking about someone
[1:07:50] in hell he said you need to go to the
[1:07:51] altar
[1:07:53] we don't wish anybody to go to hell we
[1:07:55] wish for them to be corrected
[1:07:57] do i hate their sin yes i hate being
[1:07:59] talked about i hate being light upon
[1:08:01] i hate how they misrepresent me i hate
[1:08:04] that
[1:08:04] but themselves the person i love them
[1:08:08] and i don't want to see them burn in
[1:08:09] hell i don't see them saved
[1:08:12] but they got to repent right just like i
[1:08:14] did just like everybody has to do
[1:08:17] so that's a great distinction we have to
[1:08:18] make now the first picture is the body
[1:08:21] did you catch that
[1:08:22] he took two men the bible said and put
[1:08:24] him in one body
[1:08:27] he said two making one new man
[1:08:31] that was in verse 15. so that was the
[1:08:33] first picture
[1:08:35] so the cross makes two men one man
[1:08:38] and one body and don't you know the
[1:08:40] bible said christ is the head of this
[1:08:42] body
[1:08:44] hallelujah christ is the head and this
[1:08:47] new body has
[1:08:48] access to god the father through the
[1:08:51] spirit
[1:08:52] hallelujah so church we must always
[1:08:55] remember that jesus
[1:08:56] is the head that's why brother and said
[1:08:58] pray every day he said pray before every
[1:09:00] decision
[1:09:03] pray before every decision that way you
[1:09:05] get the instructions from the head
[1:09:08] right before we go do something before
[1:09:09] we drive or go do something
[1:09:11] we should pray first and make sure the
[1:09:13] head approves of that
[1:09:15] praise god because we're the body christ
[1:09:18] is the head amen
[1:09:20] there's that always that echo on
[1:09:21] wednesday night i'm not sure what that
[1:09:23] is that's probably is it every service
[1:09:24] that happens
[1:09:28] so he takes two men and makes them one
[1:09:31] new man
[1:09:32] in one body christ is the head
[1:09:36] praise god i don't have much more to say
[1:09:39] on that
[1:09:40] let's look at the second pictures in
[1:09:41] verse 19.
[1:09:44] now therefore you are no more strangers
[1:09:46] and foreigners but fellow citizens of
[1:09:47] the saints
[1:09:48] and of the household of god
[1:09:52] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:09:54] apostles and prophets
[1:09:55] jesus christ himself being the chief
[1:09:57] cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:09:59] fitly framed together growth under a
[1:10:01] holy temple in the lord
[1:10:03] in whom he also are builded together for
[1:10:05] inhabitation of god through the spirit
[1:10:07] so that's the second picture the first
[1:10:09] picture is
[1:10:10] everybody's a part of the same body
[1:10:13] we're a part of the same body brother
[1:10:15] amen
[1:10:16] brother bang that's why i've never hurt
[1:10:17] them because they're a part of my body
[1:10:19] whatever hurt my body on purpose
[1:10:21] i wouldn't think so i treat my body
[1:10:24] pretty good i try to at least
[1:10:26] because it's really not my body it's the
[1:10:28] body of christ right he purchased it
[1:10:30] with his blood
[1:10:31] we're all part of the same body so we
[1:10:32] should be for each other we should be
[1:10:34] cheering each other on right we should
[1:10:35] in other words
[1:10:36] encouraging them right not cheering like
[1:10:38] a cheerleader you know
[1:10:40] not that kind of cheering like that's
[1:10:41] how some people say it but it's
[1:10:43] encouraging them you just stay strong in
[1:10:44] the faith
[1:10:45] you just keep believing you keep
[1:10:47] trusting god for that salvation that
[1:10:48] lost love
[1:10:49] you i appreciate your faith i appreciate
[1:10:51] your example thanks for that song
[1:10:52] special thanks for praying for me when i
[1:10:54] was sick i believe god heard your
[1:10:55] prayers you know
[1:10:56] you just try to encourage them you don't
[1:10:57] try to discourage them you try to
[1:10:59] encourage them
[1:11:00] because we're all part of the same body
[1:11:01] amen amen
[1:11:03] and christ is the head
[1:11:08] think about you know if christ is the
[1:11:09] head and think about when you're driving
[1:11:11] you got your hands doing this you got
[1:11:12] your feet on the accelerator you might
[1:11:14] have your eyes back there
[1:11:15] see we can all be doing different things
[1:11:16] kind of but we're all moving the
[1:11:19] the vehicle forward right right you
[1:11:22] might be tapping i might not be a tapper
[1:11:24] right you might be the one on the pedal
[1:11:26] you might be pushing it forward what
[1:11:28] about you could even be talking on the
[1:11:29] phone while you're doing all this
[1:11:31] it could be picking your nails you know
[1:11:32] you could be okay put on your glasses
[1:11:34] you're gonna be doing all kinds of
[1:11:35] things
[1:11:35] the body does all kinds of things but it
[1:11:37] all answers back to the head praise
[1:11:40] god hallelujah we must remember that and
[1:11:42] appreciate that that we have different
[1:11:44] callings and ministries
[1:11:46] that's what the doctrine of the
[1:11:47] nicolaitans is all about brother simon
[1:11:49] talks about
[1:11:50] he just did a bible study on that it's a
[1:11:51] two hour one it's good to listen to if
[1:11:53] you ever
[1:11:53] listen to it but the main idea is that
[1:11:55] jesus hates the doctrine of the
[1:11:57] nicolaitans
[1:11:59] and that doctrine is the antichrist
[1:12:00] spirit conquers the people
[1:12:03] where the people don't they don't feel
[1:12:05] as close to god as the preachers
[1:12:07] everybody in here should be feel born
[1:12:08] again and just as close to god as i
[1:12:10] am if not then we just need to all we
[1:12:13] need to pray and study more
[1:12:14] right because that if i get close to god
[1:12:17] that's how i do it
[1:12:18] right i pray and study and try to get
[1:12:20] kind listen to the word of god
[1:12:22] and if we don't if we feel far from god
[1:12:24] we've got to draw near to god amen
[1:12:27] but the deeds of nicholadians tries to
[1:12:29] exalt preachers above everybody else now
[1:12:31] they have high responsibility but that
[1:12:33] doesn't mean they they're closer to god
[1:12:34] in any way right or
[1:12:36] they could have some revelation we can't
[1:12:37] have
[1:12:39] but the deeds of nicolaen seeks to exalt
[1:12:41] preachers above the laity
[1:12:43] and that's not right it's not right
[1:12:46] and the example that we see today as
[1:12:48] pastors they'll leave their churches and
[1:12:50] go do
[1:12:51] evangelistic work and still get the
[1:12:53] tithes
[1:12:55] that's wrong if they're out of their
[1:12:57] church more than in their church
[1:12:59] they shouldn't be getting the tithes
[1:13:00] because they're not feeding the flock
[1:13:03] but that's not how it works in a lot of
[1:13:04] churches that's the beginning of the
[1:13:06] deeds of nicolaitan simon brought that
[1:13:08] out really well
[1:13:09] that's why i knew it was the holy spirit
[1:13:11] because preachers don't like to hear
[1:13:12] that
[1:13:13] you start stepping on preachers though
[1:13:15] that's the holy spirit right there
[1:13:17] right especially the big name guys naomi
[1:13:19] was nodding
[1:13:20] you see it all over the place so i told
[1:13:22] brother amen i said if god ever calls me
[1:13:24] to
[1:13:25] uh missionary work i'd have to resign
[1:13:28] from the pastor here
[1:13:30] you guys have to vote another pastor i
[1:13:32] go out missionary work i come back to
[1:13:34] see you
[1:13:35] if i never do that i'm not even saying i
[1:13:37] would but i sure want to do some
[1:13:38] missionary work someday
[1:13:40] i want to win souls praise god i i think
[1:13:42] everybody deserves a chance to hear what
[1:13:43] we've heard
[1:13:45] i believe that with all my heart but
[1:13:46] that's the beginning of the deeds of the
[1:13:48] nicolaitans
[1:13:50] they become above or greater than the
[1:13:53] people
[1:13:55] okay so that's just one little example
[1:13:57] there now the second example we just
[1:13:59] read it
[1:13:59] is we are all part of a temple jesus is
[1:14:03] the cornerstone
[1:14:04] so we are all we're all sitting on the
[1:14:06] work of jesus
[1:14:08] we are firmly placed right on top of
[1:14:11] jesus
[1:14:12] don't worry about falling jesus is
[1:14:14] underneath you
[1:14:16] ah your foundation cannot crack amen
[1:14:21] your foundation's uncrackable praise god
[1:14:24] it's unbreakable amen
[1:14:26] because he was alive before the
[1:14:27] foundation of the world amen
[1:14:30] he has no beginning of days nor end of
[1:14:33] life
[1:14:33] he's the chief cornerstone the eternal
[1:14:36] stone praise god
[1:14:38] amen we're not going to fall we're going
[1:14:39] to stand strong in the word
[1:14:44] yeah that cuyahoga fault falls house we
[1:14:46] had had a really bad foundation
[1:14:48] i'm glad we got out of there we got a
[1:14:51] good one now by god's grace just got to
[1:14:53] keep the water away from it praise god
[1:14:55] right and that's a lot like the church
[1:14:57] in the church we have a real solid
[1:14:59] foundation
[1:14:59] there's no cracks there's there's going
[1:15:01] to be no problem with the foundation the
[1:15:02] foundation was right
[1:15:04] jesus paul apostles john james all these
[1:15:07] men
[1:15:08] and here we are right at the top oh
[1:15:10] we're the ones that are highest up here
[1:15:11] church
[1:15:13] we're right at the coming of the lord
[1:15:14] we've got a firm foundation praise god
[1:15:18] we are a part of the church we're a part
[1:15:21] of the temple praise god
[1:15:22] this is god's house amen i'm a part of
[1:15:25] god's church praise god
[1:15:27] we're a part of it let's stand like a
[1:15:29] real church praise god
[1:15:32] oh that's glorious we are not going to
[1:15:35] fall because we have a firm foundation
[1:15:38] it's impossible and we're a habitation
[1:15:41] of the holy spirit that means god's
[1:15:43] going to work through each one of us
[1:15:45] god can work he can just flow right
[1:15:47] through this house he can just work
[1:15:49] through each one of us that's what we
[1:15:50] saw when god anointed naomi and
[1:15:52] and the sisters that helped help lydia
[1:15:53] there a few months ago wasn't that
[1:15:55] beautiful
[1:15:56] that's beautiful it wasn't me god was
[1:15:58] choosing that day to help somebody
[1:16:01] i love that praise god sometimes i could
[1:16:03] like use a little break you know all the
[1:16:06] pro knowledge
[1:16:06] there's just pressure right there's
[1:16:07] pressure to preach the word i like when
[1:16:09] god uses other people praise god
[1:16:12] yeah we we all got to find a way to be
[1:16:15] united to be used by god amen
[1:16:19] and see the bible said we grow into the
[1:16:21] dwelling place see
[1:16:22] each generation grows so listen if god
[1:16:25] tarries
[1:16:26] brother amen we're building you're
[1:16:28] you're laying the music foundation for
[1:16:29] malachi lydia the next generation
[1:16:32] because the lord terry's one day you're
[1:16:34] gonna have to hang up your guitar buddy
[1:16:36] right one day i'm have to lay that lay
[1:16:38] down my bible hand to somebody to preach
[1:16:41] if the lord tarries but see we're
[1:16:43] growing we're still growing closer to
[1:16:45] the coming of the lord
[1:16:46] i love this jesus is the cornerstone and
[1:16:48] he's the headstone
[1:16:51] praise god how can he be both well the
[1:16:53] bible tells
[1:16:54] us he's god in all and through all
[1:16:57] praise god
[1:16:58] amen he is all and he's in
[1:17:01] all praise god can i say it like this
[1:17:04] he's the corner
[1:17:05] he's a headstone and he's in every stone
[1:17:07] as well
[1:17:10] just like he's in all the parts of the
[1:17:11] body as well he's the head but he's a
[1:17:13] part of
[1:17:14] every part of the body oh it's beautiful
[1:17:18] he's the head of the body and the
[1:17:20] cornerstone
[1:17:22] i'm all right i'm almost at my 45
[1:17:24] minutes good praise god
[1:17:25] pretty good
[1:17:29] now if you would here let's uh i think i
[1:17:32] want to close with this thought here
[1:17:34] uh we're trying to look and see which
[1:17:37] thought if you would go to first kings
[1:17:39] please first kings
[1:17:43] first king 638 if you would pull that up
[1:17:45] please yeah you can turn that off there
[1:17:46] sir
[1:17:48] i wanted to i forgot i want to look up
[1:17:49] some other pictures but that was all the
[1:17:51] one like
[1:17:51] all the time i had for
[1:17:56] oh we have a firm foundation church
[1:17:58] we're not going anywhere
[1:18:00] right you think satan's gonna blow down
[1:18:02] god's house
[1:18:04] like that little pig story and the wolf
[1:18:06] you think satan's gonna blow down the
[1:18:07] house of god
[1:18:08] the bible said he's blowing winds of
[1:18:10] doctrine do you think he's going to blow
[1:18:11] down
[1:18:12] god's house impossible let him come in
[1:18:15] like a flood let him come in like a
[1:18:16] storm
[1:18:17] the house of god stands firm jesus
[1:18:20] already said it when you build it the
[1:18:21] right way
[1:18:21] the storms come but the house stands
[1:18:24] hallelujah we're standing praise god
[1:18:28] let lies come in let all these things
[1:18:30] come in by the holy spirit we'll discern
[1:18:31] them all
[1:18:33] right we'll get the old lump out right
[1:18:35] we a few few seconds ago we preached on
[1:18:37] that
[1:18:37] we'll become a brand new not praise god
[1:18:39] we just got to get the sin out
[1:18:41] and we'll be a brand new church praise
[1:18:43] god amen that's right
[1:18:47] now first kings can you pull up first
[1:18:48] kings 6 38 38
[1:18:50] this is a thought i'll probably just
[1:18:51] maybe i'll end with this one here
[1:18:54] well you know maybe i might have a
[1:18:56] couple more thoughts here let's see
[1:18:57] there's okay there's 45 minutes right
[1:18:58] there
[1:19:00] i'll set it for 10 more minutes okay
[1:19:01] then i'll do about 55 minutes
[1:19:03] i really try to stop at 10 minutes now
[1:19:06] this reminded me as i read this i
[1:19:08] thought jew and gentile
[1:19:10] church jew and gentile temple and the
[1:19:13] holy spirit brought to me solomon's
[1:19:14] temple
[1:19:17] solomon's temple was a foreshadowing of
[1:19:20] the jew gentile church
[1:19:23] who's it built by the son of david
[1:19:27] solomon wasn't jesus christ called the
[1:19:29] son of david
[1:19:31] who built it the son of david with those
[1:19:33] thousand wives
[1:19:34] right a thousand church members right
[1:19:36] church bride members
[1:19:39] oh it's glorious amen beautiful how long
[1:19:42] did it take to build
[1:19:45] how long did it take for salmon to build
[1:19:47] this house
[1:19:48] where his bride is gonna live huh
[1:19:53] so he was seven years
[1:19:56] building it it took seven church ages
[1:19:59] for the son of david
[1:20:00] to build this house of worship get it
[1:20:03] seven church ages
[1:20:05] seven years seven church ages and that's
[1:20:08] what he's been doing
[1:20:10] for seven church ages he laid the
[1:20:12] foundation in ephesus
[1:20:14] he laid the foundation stone he laid
[1:20:17] that and then smyrna
[1:20:19] pergamos thyratira praise god sardis
[1:20:22] philadelphia and he's putting this stone
[1:20:24] right here the laodicean stone
[1:20:27] thank god the headstone's coming too
[1:20:29] hallelujah
[1:20:30] seven years seven church ages
[1:20:33] the son of david builds the house of god
[1:20:38] but not only jews build it
[1:20:42] if you go to chapter five solomon
[1:20:44] partners with a gentile king
[1:20:49] hiram the king of tyree
[1:20:53] so both kings and both people
[1:20:56] work together to build this house of god
[1:20:59] it just wasn't jews building this house
[1:21:02] it was gentiles building the house
[1:21:04] praise god
[1:21:06] they partnered and it became a beautiful
[1:21:08] habitation of the holy spirit
[1:21:10] so much so when they dedicate it the
[1:21:13] holy spirit filled the house and the
[1:21:14] priest couldn't minister
[1:21:16] jew and gentile work together they build
[1:21:19] the son of david builds the house of god
[1:21:21] the holy ghost comes down and god dwells
[1:21:24] amongst his people
[1:21:26] church god is coming to dwell on this
[1:21:29] earth in the millennium praise god
[1:21:31] he's going to dwell with his people
[1:21:32] praise god amen
[1:21:34] there'll be no interruptions of that
[1:21:35] church service praise god
[1:21:38] thousand years of worship thousand years
[1:21:41] of total
[1:21:42] obedience
[1:21:48] yeah i'm trying to remember some
[1:21:49] scriptures on the millennium but i
[1:21:50] better not say it cause i'll probably
[1:21:51] chop it up it's been too long since i
[1:21:53] preached on it
[1:21:55] see the spiritual temple is currently
[1:21:58] under construction
[1:21:59] but it's being built by jewish and
[1:22:02] gentile hearts today
[1:22:05] oh thank you lord hallelujah i'm glad to
[1:22:08] be a part of that church
[1:22:10] church maybe we're those last few stones
[1:22:13] think about that either our generation
[1:22:15] the next generation one of these next
[1:22:16] generations
[1:22:17] they're going to be the last stones laid
[1:22:18] up but like uh like enoch's pyramid
[1:22:21] right they're just it just it's just
[1:22:22] missing the headstone
[1:22:24] but those last stones at the top they've
[1:22:26] been privileged they're the ones that
[1:22:28] are gonna
[1:22:29] see the headstone come down right now
[1:22:31] spiritually
[1:22:33] they're the ones that get to touch the
[1:22:34] headstone
[1:22:36] and the saints that are alive they're
[1:22:39] the ones
[1:22:40] that get to touch jesus at the meeting
[1:22:42] in the air amen
[1:22:44] those last words praise god that are
[1:22:46] alive and remain
[1:22:48] they'll meet the lord in the air praise
[1:22:50] god amen
[1:22:52] the dead in christ rise first though
[1:22:54] praise god
[1:22:57] it's a beautiful picture if you want to
[1:22:58] see that isn't that beautiful
[1:23:00] seven years seven church ages for jew
[1:23:02] and gentile to build this church
[1:23:04] together
[1:23:05] and then it becomes a holy habitation oh
[1:23:08] we're so thankful to be a part of it
[1:23:10] thank you great son of david for making
[1:23:11] us a part of it
[1:23:16] yeah let me just close with this this
[1:23:18] last thought
[1:23:19] in ephesians chapter 3 paul calls
[1:23:22] himself a prisoner of christ for you
[1:23:24] gentiles
[1:23:25] that he should preach among the gentiles
[1:23:26] the unsearchable riches of christ
[1:23:28] and to make all men see what's the
[1:23:29] fellowship of the mystery
[1:23:31] so paul was a loved slave to christ's
[1:23:33] will
[1:23:34] that's what we all should be love slaves
[1:23:37] his calling was to preach jesus is
[1:23:39] amazing
[1:23:40] multifaceted love to the gentiles
[1:23:43] remember the height the breadth the
[1:23:44] depth
[1:23:45] and the width of jesus's love remember
[1:23:46] there's four dimensions to it
[1:23:50] but paul he says he wants everyone to
[1:23:53] see the fellowship of the mystery
[1:23:56] now that word fellowship i preached on
[1:23:57] this a while ago means
[1:23:59] intimacy paul wants us to see the
[1:24:02] intimacy or the joint participation
[1:24:06] of the mystery so in other words this
[1:24:08] mystery
[1:24:09] allows everyone to fellowship together
[1:24:13] right we don't segregate based upon
[1:24:15] financial achievements
[1:24:18] we don't segregate based on preacher
[1:24:20] well you're not a preacher you can't
[1:24:22] join us
[1:24:22] we have a special fellowship for
[1:24:23] preachers right
[1:24:26] and cam opened up that minister's
[1:24:27] meeting to everybody that was good
[1:24:29] when we had ministers meetings here i
[1:24:30] opened up to everybody too open up to
[1:24:32] everybody
[1:24:33] just the brothers came a couple brothers
[1:24:35] came one time and they didn't come back
[1:24:36] that's fine i open up to everybody i
[1:24:38] want them to hear what the preachers are
[1:24:39] saying
[1:24:41] but this this revelation of the jew and
[1:24:43] gentile one church
[1:24:45] it makes everybody a participant in the
[1:24:47] movement of the holy spirit
[1:24:50] that means church you can come to church
[1:24:52] with just as much of a revelation as i
[1:24:54] do
[1:24:55] right that's that's the fellowship of it
[1:24:59] that's the beauty of it right like i
[1:25:02] remember when sister remember when
[1:25:03] sister marie and kevin used to come
[1:25:05] i remember that morning when marie came
[1:25:06] when she had that bleeding and she was
[1:25:08] healed
[1:25:09] she walked in here her eyes were just
[1:25:12] so happy i remember opened the door for
[1:25:13] her when she and kevin walked in
[1:25:15] she was just so happy i preached on the
[1:25:16] five identification of the true church
[1:25:18] she come right up for prayer she said as
[1:25:20] we prayed she felt that blood dry up in
[1:25:22] her
[1:25:24] but i remember like and she was staring
[1:25:25] at me the whole time and that's the time
[1:25:27] where like someone like she came to
[1:25:29] church
[1:25:30] under that participation she was
[1:25:32] anointed to receive healing that morning
[1:25:34] right i love that like i just
[1:25:38] i mean i just knew well there's
[1:25:39] something different about today i didn't
[1:25:40] know what was gonna happen cause i
[1:25:41] didn't know she had bleeding trouble
[1:25:43] but that's the fellowship of the mystery
[1:25:46] that's where she was gonna participate
[1:25:48] in the ministry
[1:25:50] by getting a touch from the holy spirit
[1:25:51] praise god amen
[1:25:54] and we can all do that praise god let's
[1:25:57] go to the scripture first corinthians 14
[1:25:58] 26
[1:25:59] there's lots of different ways to do it
[1:26:00] like you can come with a song
[1:26:02] like many times i've seen that with
[1:26:03] brother amen he'll come and he's so
[1:26:05] happy and he's going to sing a certain
[1:26:07] song that makes him happy he'll cry
[1:26:09] i love that buddy
[1:26:13] see when you're when you're
[1:26:15] participating in the movement of the
[1:26:16] holy spirit
[1:26:18] you're anointed by the holy spirit
[1:26:20] that's the beauty of this
[1:26:22] before only jews could be anointed but
[1:26:24] now everybody can be anointed
[1:26:26] amen first corinthians 14 26 can you
[1:26:29] pull it up there hunts
[1:26:30] i don't have to have to lick it up here
[1:26:36] see we are all partaking in god's
[1:26:38] promises
[1:26:39] we all have full access to jesus christ
[1:26:46] how is it then brethren when you come
[1:26:48] together every one of you have to solve
[1:26:50] so brother amen will come with a song
[1:26:52] now that's not all he has to come with
[1:26:54] or like when sister naomi will sing a
[1:26:55] song special my wife will sing a song
[1:26:56] special
[1:26:58] they come and you can just tell like
[1:26:59] they're just ready to worship today
[1:27:01] what are they doing they come anointed
[1:27:03] with the psalm
[1:27:05] that's their part of the body they're
[1:27:07] just doing their part
[1:27:09] that's them being them right that's what
[1:27:11] they're called to do
[1:27:13] and sometimes if you see me come and
[1:27:14] preach and maybe you're tired of
[1:27:16] discouraging but yeah i'm really fiery
[1:27:18] and on fire you know
[1:27:19] i'm ready when you see me doing my part
[1:27:22] right
[1:27:23] or i pray for the sick and someone will
[1:27:24] get healed right then or later you know
[1:27:26] it was just everybody was doing their
[1:27:28] part praise god
[1:27:30] see this is the this is the fellowship
[1:27:32] of the mystery praise god
[1:27:34] we're all participants if you
[1:27:37] participate
[1:27:38] if brother amen participates we'll all
[1:27:40] get blessed by his songs
[1:27:42] because they're from god if i
[1:27:44] participate
[1:27:45] everybody leaves out of here blessed by
[1:27:47] the message
[1:27:48] if i participate now you put your own
[1:27:51] life in there
[1:27:52] maybe see i might be bringing a doctrine
[1:27:55] right
[1:27:56] a tongue right a tongue's interpretation
[1:27:58] we
[1:27:59] will have to grow into that one right
[1:28:01] but you can bring a revelation
[1:28:04] you could bring an interpretation you
[1:28:05] have to grow into that one too but that
[1:28:06] could be a dream that's right that could
[1:28:07] be a dream too
[1:28:09] let all things be done unto edifying so
[1:28:12] when you come to church you
[1:28:14] whatever you bring you come to build up
[1:28:16] the body
[1:28:18] right like one time i was at
[1:28:22] brother tim humes and we had a mighty
[1:28:25] move of the spirit in fact he looked at
[1:28:26] my wife and i after the service and him
[1:28:28] and his wife and he said that was one of
[1:28:29] the greatest services we've ever had in
[1:28:30] our
[1:28:31] 30 years of the church it was back in
[1:28:33] 2017.
[1:28:34] well the whole church was up there
[1:28:36] praying except like maybe
[1:28:37] five four or five people you remember
[1:28:39] that malachi do you remember that
[1:28:42] okay he's praying all of a sudden a
[1:28:45] sister
[1:28:46] runs up there and tries to take the mic
[1:28:48] from him and brother tim just stands
[1:28:50] there now he left the message since then
[1:28:51] but
[1:28:52] i'm not i'm not saying he's a good
[1:28:54] example now but i love him
[1:28:56] you know but it was just a good example
[1:28:59] when he was in the message
[1:29:00] that sister was trying to take the mic
[1:29:03] afterwards we talked to her he counseled
[1:29:05] her in the office
[1:29:06] and she was trying to rebuke one of her
[1:29:08] friends this girl this young girl didn't
[1:29:10] think her friend should be courting this
[1:29:12] boy
[1:29:13] and she didn't come to edify she came to
[1:29:16] tear down
[1:29:18] what's the bible saying that all things
[1:29:20] be done in the edifice
[1:29:21] and she was so out of place here's a
[1:29:24] woman she's probably she's probably this
[1:29:25] tall
[1:29:27] probably 17 or 18. she's trying to steal
[1:29:30] the mic from the man of god
[1:29:31] who's praying for all the families in
[1:29:33] the church to repent and play more tapes
[1:29:35] of brother branham that's what i
[1:29:36] preached on
[1:29:37] and now they don't even believe in
[1:29:37] brother branham that's what my message
[1:29:40] was to get all the leaven out of the
[1:29:42] house right that waters separation
[1:29:43] message
[1:29:44] but see she was trying to tear down her
[1:29:46] friend she was targeting just that one
[1:29:48] friend
[1:29:49] but the holy spirit was trying to heal
[1:29:50] the homes and get them back on the tapes
[1:29:54] and kick the tvs out of their houses in
[1:29:55] the star wars i remember i preached on
[1:29:57] star wars
[1:29:59] see that was coming to destroy the body
[1:30:01] now sometimes you got to correct the
[1:30:02] body but
[1:30:02] you could tell because she was trying to
[1:30:04] usurp authority
[1:30:06] and i always remember that because that
[1:30:07] was a great example and she repented
[1:30:09] afterwards and said yes it was out of
[1:30:10] place
[1:30:11] i was in the flesh not in the spirit but
[1:30:13] you should have saw her
[1:30:14] screaming and crying you would have
[1:30:16] thought she was under the holy spirit
[1:30:19] but she was out of order by their fruits
[1:30:23] you'll know them listen to our feet
[1:30:28] how is it bride of christ fellowship
[1:30:30] when you come together
[1:30:31] every one of you have to solve musicians
[1:30:34] can come
[1:30:36] preachers will have a doctrine
[1:30:40] right everybody can have a tongue
[1:30:43] everybody can have a revelation that's
[1:30:46] just the unveiling of god's will
[1:30:49] everyone can have an interpretation that
[1:30:51] all things be done unto edifying that's
[1:30:53] the beauty of the church
[1:30:54] i'm just going to use naomi again uh
[1:30:56] that that morning when uh we prayed for
[1:30:57] lydia there and
[1:30:58] naomi and the girls helped lydia naomi
[1:31:00] knew she was coming to church there was
[1:31:02] something she was supposed to do is that
[1:31:03] righteous
[1:31:05] see that that's a great example just
[1:31:07] like when sister uh
[1:31:09] marie she knew something was gonna
[1:31:11] happen at church that morning
[1:31:13] like see because we're all participating
[1:31:15] we're all part of this
[1:31:16] new man right we're all part of this
[1:31:20] holy temple
[1:31:21] and we all can participate in the
[1:31:24] building up of the body of christ so
[1:31:26] let's bow our heads here
[1:31:27] and let's let's ask the lord lord help
[1:31:29] me to build up my brothers and sisters
[1:31:31] in christ

[1:31:36] and many of you have built me up when i
[1:31:37] was down and discouraged or i was
[1:31:39] struggling
[1:31:40] many of you have built me up by saying
