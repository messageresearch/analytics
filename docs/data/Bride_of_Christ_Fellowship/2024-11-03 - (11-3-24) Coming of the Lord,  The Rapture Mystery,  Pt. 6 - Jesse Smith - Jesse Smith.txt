TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery praise God thank God that he's revealed the mystery to us it comes in a shout voice and a trump praise God comes before the tribulation period great great Revelations God has uh given to us we're thankful for his Amazing Grace Hallelujah I'll read 1 through 4 and then we can read verse 5 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemy and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life Hallelujah to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple let's read verse 5 1 2 3 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock let's have one more word of prayer uh if you have a need on your heart you can make it known unto God father we love you today Lord God we're here to accomplish your purpose Lord God we don't want our will we want thy will Lord God so have your way today Lord God just let your spirit move each person Lord God to receive your word Lord God to bless your Holy Name Lord God uh just have full control control here today Lord God we're mindful of your presence God we know you said you'd be wherever two or three are gathered Lord you'd be right there in the midst Lord God and you said if two or three agree on anything as touching it on Earth they shall have it Lord according to thy will so God we're thankful for your promises and Lord we love you Lord God thank you you're the strength of our soul and your love has defended us all the days of our life and will defend us Lord God in the future so we thank you for each day that we have Lord God we're thankful for all your provision Lord uh bless this preaching of Thy word in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're seated there praise God hallelujah so last time we looked at scoffers as brother Ram was looking at the scoffers uh in second Peter and then we looked at uh brother Ram talked about the Revelation it's so important brother Ram said the bride is waiting for the revelation of the Rapture how many still waiting praise God we must be patient for the revelation of the Rapture Hallelujah so at this moment here in the sermon brother Ram picks it up and now he begins on Election remember you can put it up there honey according to Romans 8:29 and3 there's five steps God gives us to his predestination the first is for knowledge whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren so first God forn knows our choices knows the free will uh free moral agency of every heart and then because of that he can pred destinate a vessel of Honor or a vessel Of Dishonor and of course he knew it before the foundation of the world and then the third step is uh whom he did predestinate them he also called the word called is the same word as elected God has elected us or called us so this is the main election I'm worried about today Hallelujah there's a big election coming on Tuesday but the main election I want to have is that I'm elected to Salvation through Jesus Christ hallelujah thank God for his grace and mercy and then whom he called called them he also Justified declared righteous and whom he justified them he also glorified brother R said that glorified then uh he said your raptured body is right there your glorified body he says the raptures already in you Hallelujah so we thank God for the election uh brother Bram begins uh here he takes a little break from Revelation and he says election he said you were in your father years before you were even born and we see that in Hebrews 7 9 and 10 if you want to put up there hun and I may as I may so say Levi also who received tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when MDC met him so we can say assuredly by the word of God that God foresaw our service to him uh at least uh three generations before we came because Abraham had Isaac Isaac had Jacob Jacob birth Levi and the Bible said Levi paid tithes in Abraham so three generations before you got here God fora you that you would serve God way before you even got here hallelujah and brother Braham said see you were in your father before you were even born so as we looked at last week even the so somewhere in the DNA of your father you were in there by God's grace Hallelujah I can't explain that yet but I'm sure science one day will find it out Hallelujah no doubt about that they L find out more things that God has already written in his word so God foresaw Levi's tithe paying in his uh great grandfather Abraham Hallelujah and brother Ram said my son Billy Paul was in me when I was 16 and now he said my son is in my uh uh when is in my own image and he said Billy Paul came at just the right time and church don't you know you came to this world at just the right time Hallelujah he said because we're attributes of God brother R said he knew the age you were coming in he he knew you wouldn't come in Ephesus or samna or pergamos or thy or Philadelphia or Sardis he knew you would come in the leoan church age and brother bam said he did that because he's longing for your fellowship so let's make sure today you give God some fellowship Hallelujah tell him how much you love Him worship Him Praise Him receive his word hallelujah Give Him Glory Hallelujah he's Longing To Be worshiped he's he's uh his angels brother R says are going uh along the roads taking down prayer requests Hallelujah and taking those prayer requests up to heaven and then putting them in vials and God writes down all your prayers in other words and puts them and collects them and they're all going to be poured out somehow way or another God will answer all our prayers Hallelujah now Church you know this we'll find out which prayer requests of ours were the perfect will of God and we'll find out which prayers of ours were our own desires Hallelujah but God's will will be accomplished amen 2 chronicles 16 9 says for the L the eyes of the Lord run to and thr fro sorry throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him so God wants to show himself strong in the lives of the Believers most people they are sinners and they have they're weak in faith but we're to be Christians we're to be holy ghost filled and God is looking for someone he can show strong faith in we want to be like Abraham we want to call those things not as though they are Hallelujah that's what God is looking for today his spirit is going all over the Earth trying to find someone he can show himself strong in let's be somebody that God can show his strength in today Hallelujah brother Ram said though although we're predestinated he said there's millions and billions he said mimicking Christianity and he goes to a quite a a graphic illustration he goes to cattle breeding and he goes to the discharge of a bull so I know that's quite descriptive there but he goes to that and he says uh his friend de mikarin uh raised bulls and he he showed brother brandom uh how they would uh uh how they would H breed the Bulls and so forth like that and he says uh in the discharge of a bull he said uh there's millions of germs in there he said but only one was ordained to life and brother man said he saw it in the in the microscope he saw a germ crawl over other germs to fertilize an egg that was waiting and brother R said it said that germ was predestinated by God that germ had to push its way because God ordained that particular one because it had certain traits about it in the DNA certain things that that God had ordained that that bull would Express and it had to bypass everything else to get to the egg in order to express the predestinated plan of God and brother Ram said that's more mysterious to us than the Virgin birth cuz the Virgin birth was God giving one germ one egg and just one and one came together to form the body of our Lord Jesus Christ but he said uh it's different with animal life and of course human life he said there's millions of of options but there's one that presses through the crowd amen this reminded me of the woman with the blood issue the Bible said when she heard of Jesus she came in the press behind and touched his garments there there was all kinds of people standing around Jesus but she pressed her way it was predestinated amen it was revealed to her that she was going to get her healing so just like that germ she pressed Beyond everybody in order to touch Jesus and as soon as she touched Jesus life occurred hallelujah amen hallelujah so just like you church just that's a that's a lesson for us today we've got to press through all the trials we've got to get past all the discouragement get past all the all the Mind battles we got to press through that and get to Jesus Hallelujah and receive from God what he'd have for us today Hallelujah think about that there was so many other traits uh just at at when you were conceived there were so many other traits options there but it was something about you God fornew you God predestinated you there's a purpose you're here God wants to help you God wants to strengthen you God wants to be strong in your life hallelujah hallelujah and then brother R says Ephesians 1 five sorry Ephesians 1 4-6 you were in God in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world he said that life you were in the life of God you were a part of the life of God that thought remember you went from thought uh uh to flesh right from thought or attribute to flesh Hallelujah then he says you'll go to theophany and then you'll go to glorified body Hallelujah that's the uh the regular line brother brandom calls it and who is this mzc he he said that life was always in you you were always in the mind of God he said then he goes into his Eagle in the chicken yard story Hallelujah he said that little Eagle would eat up all the chicken food it didn't taste good to him but he didn't have nothing else to do or or eat he just filed the chickens but brother B said he wasn't a chicken to begin with he said the mother screamed one day the mother ego said oh I know I had two eggs there's only one here I'm missing an egg you know the farmer had taking the egg and she said I must go looking for my uh my son and so she goes flying over the chicken yard she let out a scream and as soon as that little Eagle heard the scream it looked up and said brother said that scream fits me Hallelujah when I heard this message it fit me Hallelujah because I was raised in Pentecostal where they had to say you got to speak in tongues that didn't fit me tongues are the evidence that didn't fit me I'll say I'll say like this it suffocated me and that didn't fit me so I I couldn't I couldn't go along with that group but then I heard a prophet of God I heard an eagle scream and that fit me and it said the evidence is all the word of God being in the word all the way Hallelujah that fit me Hallelujah the father son Holy Ghost sprinkling or whatever it was that didn't fit me uh but the word of God from acts 238 and acts 8 and acts 10 and Acts 19 all the baptisms that fit me perfectly hallelujah amen I heard that voice and I believe that voice and I follow that Voice Hallelujah it's a thing that fits this message fits us hallelujah because it's the real interpretation of the word of God and it's Vindicated in our lives hallelujah how many times do we ask God for Vindication he gives us a Vindication Lord let me know I'm on the right path God lets us know we're on the right path hallelujah amen we've asked God God show me if there's sin in Me God will show us some sin and then it gets cleaned out Hallelujah that's God vindicating his word to us you know over the years I've asked Lord just show me the difference between you know the message and Pentecostals and message and evangelicals and every time God gives me a great Vindication and he shows us that he's in this message Hallelujah why church because all the other ones compromise and love the world they only have a partial fear of God but we must have a true fear of God brother Bram said see God is adding word upon word he said it's genuine adding word to word the bride will have to be all the word brother said Luther had part of the word Wesley had more of the word Pentecost he said and all the rest of the word goes with it he said it's life on top of life to bring out the full stature of the Bride Hallelujah think about that church in the days of Martin Luther they only had a partial uh portion of the word they didn't have the full word of God like the statue of a perfect man and all the revelations that we have today they don't so they weren't the full mature bride only in this day can God have a full mature bride that believes all the word of God hallelujah because it's word on top of word hallelujah man he says how do we get into that bride now he now he changes a a corner here he says how do we get in that bride that's the question he said some say You must speak in tongues others say You must dance and shout and brother raham said that's all right but it's also all wrong why is that wrong because you make one experience the evidence of it why is all why is it all right because when the Holy Ghost comes something has to happen amen so shouting or tongue or dancing something crying weeping rejoicing something has to happen he says it's all right but it's all wrong Hallelujah because we must have a word based experience and then brother Ram says how can a born again person deny the word of God he says you can't if you're a real born again so he said it must be Christ in you and the verse brother Ram uses to show us how to get into Christ is 1 Corinthians 1213 I'm going to read the context I'm going to read uh 1212 uh qua for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ so let's remember this today there are people that are baptized with the Holy Ghost and they might be a pinky in the plan of God they might be a e here now which which body part gets all the glory maybe the face gets all the glory right everybody wants to do a selfie and put it on you or maybe the big muscles there's a body there's a there might might be a bride member that's the bicep or the or the thighs or the hamstrings or the the knees or the ankles but there there is a body part that's just the little toe hallelujah or the appendix something you can live without right well at least one of them and so Paul's giving uh this picture of the body of Christ in other words God help me to be in your body whatever you want me to be in your body help me not to try to mimic something try to be like somebody else help me to be what you call me to be for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many so how do we get in this body baptized by the Holy Ghost your soul is filled your soul is quickened by the word of God by the spirit of God by the life of God hallelujah and then that controls your whole nature if you're born again your soul that will bring your mind into subjection and you won't do certain things Hallelujah and then when you got your mind anointed that will bring your body into subjection you won't do certain things Hallelujah because you're born again you have a power you have a nature uh that that that guards you that protects you it governs you it controls you Hallelujah that's right verse 15 and if the foot shall say because I'm not the hand I'm not the body is it therefore not the body of course it is the body right so some of us you know we're different parts of the body now we know as as sisters and maybe children uh you know who probably gets the most honor in the body well probably preachers or something like that you know we would think because they speak the word of God publicly right the the mouthpiece we we' say the spirit and the bride say come the preachers the fivefold ministry brings us to maturity but Paul's trying to say whatever part you are you're just as important as every other part who would want to willingly give up your foot today who would want to willingly uh give up your hand today no one would want to do that you want all the all the body together we want all the bride ready for the Rapture hallelujah amen so we get into one body by one Spirit baptized by the holy ghost Hallelujah remember baptize means to immerse uh to uh yeah to to to go to go completely under immerse means to go completely under the water Hallelujah so think of that your soul is completely immersed in the word of God that's why we think about it all day that's why we sing to Jesus all day that's why we can't get enough of God's word because our soul is is immersed with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah glory to God so that's the context how do we get into this rapture how do we get into the Rapture you must be baptized with the Holy Ghost we're all baptized into that one body glory to God and then brother R goes into another illustration of the Rapture I'm sorry with election he says he uh he was out there in the in California and he went to a farmer's uh kind of like a Orchard and he saw a orange tree that had eight or nine different kinds of fruit on it and you probably remember the story uh brother Bram said you know each branch that was a different life other than the orange Branch produce its own fruit like a apple or a pear or something like that brother said oh so then next season they'll all bring forth oranges brother brother said no whatever Branch uh whatever the branch is from the original tree it was that's the fruit is going to bring forth and brother R said see that's a Methodist will always bring forth a Methodist Hallelujah he said a Pentecostal will always bring forth the Pentecostal but a true member of the Bride of Jesus Christ will always bring forth the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen hallelujah glory to God he says and Jesus wants fruit for himself he wants bride children word children is what the word of God produces will produce a life of the word of God if we've got the right seed the seed of God will produce the life of God hallelujah amen but he said the nominal Church shall go back to the love of the world the Church of the Living God will be fully the word of God then brother Bram breaks back he keeps breaking back into Luther Wesley and and zuza he said Luther had to live above brother said the strange thing about Luther is that he had to live above all the fanaticism that surround His message remember church I don't know if you remember uh Luther said I hope 10% of the people we baptized are still saved and I saw a quote I said it on my phone Luther said by the end of his life he said he there's some of us that don't even look like we're even utterly Christian that that's how much people decline Church let's strive with all of our hearts not to decline in the faith let's strive to remain loyal let's strive to keep our fires burning amen it's lamp trimming time hallelujah it's time to trim our lamps to keep sin out of our lives in fact this is the message brother ram calls it lamp trimming time he said it's lamp trimming time it's Malachi 4 time he almost says it's Luke 17:30 time Hallelujah that's right he said there's so much imitation he talks about Amy simple mcferson and and he said but the word will bring forth of its own kind in its season Hallelujah so the word of of this season is to produce a Rapture a bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not going to produce uh something that looks like Pentecostal or or or or Methodist or Luther it's going to produce something that looks like the word of God the question is does your life look like the word of God that's the question for me does my life look like the word of God hallelujah now at this point brother BR at 50 minute Mark brother breaks into a new thought he gets done with election he preached on that for eight minutes and then he gets into types of the Rapture well Ram said uh now we get into the Rapture Enoch now he gets into Enoch Enoch was the seventh from Noah now don't say Amen okay don't say amen I told you last week brother Ram says the wrong name he meant to say Adam he says it twice he said that en en was the seventh from Noah and then two paragraphs later he says now we find here that Enoch was a seventh from Noah any Bible reader knows uh Enoch was the seventh from Adam Adam Seth Enos Canaan melel Jared and Enoch Hallelujah and then after Enoch Enoch begat Methuselah lamech and then Noah so Noah was the great grandson of Enoch but in the quote brother Ram says Enoch was a seventh from Adam so any mature Christian knows brother Bram just made a human mistake to say that brother brandham every word he said was thus say the Lord is evidence you're filled with a lying idolatrous spirit thank God we got enough truth in here that we can recognize when brother Ram's a man and brother bram's being a prophet with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah Enoch was the seventh from Adam and that brother Bram said makes him a type of the church ages he said Enoch was translated or raptured which which shows the seventh Church age takes the Rapture he says there's no doubt we're in the seventh Church age Hallelujah Enoch I'm sorry Noah was born approximately 70 years 69 70 after Enoch was raptured Hallelujah so uh Noah never of course never even met Enoch because he'd already been raptured but some people just don't have enough Common Sense uh to recognize these things Hallelujah but that's the battle we're facing today it's it's idolatry in the church remember John said and Paul said uh my brothers sisters flee from idolatry free from putting anything else that would would take the love of Jesus Christ or the admiration of Jesus Christ don't let anything get worshiped that belongs only to Jesus Christ Hallelujah church this Spirit of idolatry makes people lazy because they don't have to prove all things Hallelujah they don't have to fight off lies they just take whatever whatever uh their their brandom Tabernacle says they can just believe all things from one man and that man is not Jesus so that's idolatry their God is brother brandham they're insane to say that Enoch was a descendant from Noah right because Noah is a descendant of Enoch Hallelujah and brother says now Rapture without death was typ by Enoch for he was the seventh from Adam and is a type of the seventh Church age now now brother man says let's dig in now real deep guess where he goes Revelation 10:7 what we preach on last Sunday night Revelation 10:7 how many know Revelation 10 is deep that's what brother Ram says he said Revelation 107 the great mystery was to be unfolded by the seventh Angel's message angel means messenger when he begins to sound his ministry he says Jesus was rejected once he started preaching everybody loved Jesus when he was only doing Miracles but when he started bringing he said the Revelation and he he brought out the woes under the Pharisees and the woes under the Sadducees and brother said when he started saying You must drink my blood and eat my body he said that started the message actually started separating the True Believers from the unbelievers Hallelujah Jesus said I and my father are one and that separated the TR True Believer from the make believer Hallelujah but how many know Jesus was one with the father not a second person not a third person he was uh the express image of God's one person brother said Jesus didn't have to explain it he when he said eat flesh and drink blood he said we don't have to understand everything that God said we just have to believe it now remember Church there's a difference between brother brandham and Jesus if brother Bram said something in the name of the Lord then yes we have to believe it even though we don't understand it but if it's just something brother said without thus sayith the Lord we don't have to believe that but it's different with Jesus Everything Jesus said was thus saith God because he was God hallelujah that's the great difference but see tape worshippers can't accept that so that's the great difference that we have to see and we're digging in real deep now now this week I went and studied uh more on the Revelation 107 and the cloud from 1963 I only found one more quote I thought there'd be more but I probably need to keep looking but I at least now have three quotes where brother Ram connects the cloud uh from February 28 63 with his ministry of finishing the mystery of God I showed you from Shalom and what is the attraction on the mountain Hallelujah 64 and 1965 now I got one from 1963 this is a couple weeks after he preached the Seven Seals brother bam said said brother bam said said it might the Rapture might already be one of these mornings and you wouldn't know it why how I hope you can read I hope you can got a spirit of Christ enough to know what I'm talking about the Holy Spirit reveal it to you these are taped and they go around the world see but you realize now how many know brother manam said these tapes go out into the tape world how many know you're living in tape World ah hallah I hope you are by God's grace we're living in the tape world right this is the world where tapes are here we feed upon the word of of God it directs us back to the scripture and we rejoice in the word of God hallelujah I'm living in tape World brother Austin Hallelujah that's right I listen to the tapes the tapes point me to the word of God I'm strengthened I get to hear the voice of a genuine prophet of God how many people are privilege to have that very few we're a blessed people in this day Hallelujah H he said just a few days ago this is the world's falling apart in Albuquerque New Mexico April 12th 63 he said just a few days ago when them Seven Angels Came Down in that Vision many of you knowing it said go to Tucson and wait there for a while you'll hear a great blast go off remember brother told this vision of the blast going off and meeting the seven angels he told it in December of 62 and then he goes out to Tucson and actually experiences it probably in early March of 1963 so it was a vision for telling that he meet seven angels to tell him to go back to jeffon to preach the revelation of the Seven Seals and he said I tell it to you in the name of the Lord amen and it came to pass Hallelujah he says and when it goes blast return back and the Seven Seals were opened at the Tabernacle the other day everybody say open ready open he said the Seven Seals were already open in Revelation form when I seen people coming from standing there 3:00 in the in the morning to get a place to get in the auditorium and so forth forth think about that church when was the last time you came that early to church 3: in the morning I've never I've never instead of that I just stay overnight like if I'm going somewhere I'll just stay over the night rather than sitting outside the church at 3:00 a.m. so brother I said for the Seven Seals people were outside at 3:00 a.m. in the morning let's say they open the doors at 9: they waited there six hours in the cold just to hear a prophet of God give thus say the Lord now to me that proves it was a thunder each seal was a thunder it was the voice of God it wasn't the voice of a man it was the voice of a lion thundering out because God surely got do nothing except he reveals a secret to his servants the prophets Hallelujah as brother Ram said amen glory he says 3 o'clock in the morning they were setting to get a place to get into the auditorium and so forth seeing the hungry Hearts coming from everywhere I thought oh God we're bound to be at the end time remember the sounding of the seventh angel the mysteries of God was finished and there come an angel from heaven and swore and raised his hands from Heaven Revelation 10 1-7 that time would be no more exactly right the hour so brother showing look the vision was fulfilled we're in the hour of its almost time shall be no more Hallelujah of course that would mean the Rapture time no more before the Rapture God's done with the Gentiles goes to the Jews Hallelujah so that was pretty deep brother manam said that was digging real deep how many like the Deep things of God the spirit searches the Deep things of God yay the Deep things of God we'll get to that soon the prophet said the seventh angel reveals Mysteries of the Seven Seals Luther did not live long enough to reveal the seals brother said he would have if he lived long enough so it shows how God ordains ages God knows the next age the next anointing the next messenger god knows the next person the fivefold ministry he's going to use he said the Reformation was New Life coming forth after the death of the Dark Ages and he says the sunrise this morning foreshadowed that so the the the the Third Church age was like death I'm sorry no the fourth Church age thyro was was the darkest age brother Ram said and the Bible says that so that represent the sun going down so Martin Luther was the sunrise that you all saw this morning how many appreciate the Sunrise that represented Martin Luther Hallelujah he says the Reformation was new life like a sunrise coming forth out of a dark night he says the life came out of Luther it went into westly and life comes out of Pentecost church I thought about this today have you realized how the persecution has uh uh or the the trials for the Christian has been different as time went on I'm going to read it in just a moment but Martin Luther had had to stand there in front of the Pope and Cardinals and stand for his message of his hour and death was on the line now did did John Wesley have to do that no but what did John Wesley have to deal with churches that kicked him out they would throw stones at him right kicked him out different kind of persecution ausa Street my brother man said some of them even got shot at in their auditoriums so very similar to John Wesley there now we're living in a day and brother Ram said now he lived in America so remember uh brother Bram said the hardest thing he's ever gone through is being rejected out there in Arizona by all the preachers remember that he said that was the hardest thing he'd ever gone through out there he said he said I'm out here in a desert he said it's a desert spiritually all these preachers divided by their own they just want to grow their big kingdoms brother said this has been the hardest thing of my life that's what he said but look how look how the persecution physically has kind of gone down but we're still facing persecution we're still p uh still facing Trials of life don't you know the devil's trying to get us to recant our faith the devil will use your family he'll use friends he'll use work and job situations uh he he'll try anything to try to get you to recant your faith but God is telling you to stand on the word of God most of the day most of the time here in America the spirit in America is entertainment and so it's the devil trying to use entertainment to get people to deny their faith in the message of the hour pleasures of this life and remember they're just pleasurable for a season the the pleasures will only last for a few moments that's why it's better to enjoy the pleasures of God hallelujah because they're Eternal Hallelujah but the RAM said the life just like a stock a wheat grain the the life sprouted up and you saw the Sprout which was Luther and then he says uh you see Wesley the stalk and then you see the chaff Pentecost but then it comes to the full grain how many want to be a full grain believer you want to be the full seed the full power of God oh there's power in the seed look at you you're all examples there's power in the seed hallelujah oh my so let's go back I thought of this today who remembers uh Mo Martin Luther's most famous words anybody remember he said here I stand 15:21 Martin Luther stood in defense of his doctrine of justification at the diet of worms it looks like worms but it's not worms it's worms uh April 18th 1521 he was standing before the pope and all the Cardinals and it was a life or death situation now think about what the squeeze might come down to that's why I'm saying this brother BR said that that same power in the Roman Church is eventually going to come to America because she's the beast out of the land and then remember I love how Jesus said Jesus said don't don't take thought what you'd say when you're brought before the council he says my father will give you what to say in that hour Hallelujah so here's Jesus backing up his word giving Martin Luther the words to say and he didn't have anything he was in he was in chains before the council he didn't have any notes he could go to now as a preacher I really like to have notes but if I don't I know God will give me the word I sure appreciate notes but Luther standing there and they they give him one more chance will you recant and live or will you go die now remember he got rescued after that he got rescued by people that dressed up like the Pope's guards and they took him off in hiding and dressed him up like a soldier so then during the day or the night time he could translate the Bible into German here's what the Holy Ghost gave Martin Luther now think about would you have the courage to say this if somebody asked you to recant of Jesus Christ he said unless I am convicted by scripture and plain reason I do not accept the authority of popes and councils in other words there's nothing in the Bible that says popes and councils will rule over the church and there's no reasoning to put that into the word of God I don't see scripture and I don't see any reasoning right the popes were trying to keep the word of God why would they want to keep the word of God out the hands of the people because the word has life it's the only thing thank God that you've got life Hallelujah so he has no notes all he can say it's what the Holy Ghost tells him to say unless I'm convicted by scripture this is a prophet of God now brother said he was a prophet one place another place he says he's not but one things for sure he's a he's a messenger of God he's a star in the hand of God unless the scripture convicts me or plain reason I do not accept the authority of popes and councils that's why I don't accept the authority of any uh uh of any brandom Tabernacle or any other Church there's only one Authority that's Christ for they have contradicted each other so let me stop stop right there why doesn't he accept the pope because they contradict themselves why don't we accept brandom Tabernacle other churches because they contradict themselves they they they lie they say one thing and then they say the other thing the Bible said we should all say the same thing Hallelujah so what the Holy Ghost give the church age Messenger right before he could possibly be be killed what the Holy Ghost give him I cannot go against my conviction of the scripture because alls I see is I see you compromising and I see you contradicting yourself Church don't follow any lie if you see somebody contradict themselves go ask them about it you can do it in a nice way right you can say please help me understand you said this here you said that there did you mean to say that did you make a mistake I'm waiting for that there's certain people that have prophesied a certain preacher is going to be healed in the name of Jesus Christ from stage four cancer and I'm watching that now if this man dies I'm going to reach out to them and say I'm not going to straight accuse them of prophesying a lie I'm going to say did God reveal something else to you that changes prophecy you know why because I want to be respectful Hallelujah but if anybody says something in the name of the Lord they better make sure it's from the Lord he says for that you have contradicted each other my conscience is captive to the word of God my conscience only takes uh uh inspiration from the word of God not counsels not men not Authority I only am captured I I only think what the Bible says for me to think he says I cannot and will not recant anything for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe so what does it boil down to he has to stand upon his convictions he doesn't have a miracle he doesn't break out one of his gifts of the Spirit right and start doing Miracles he just speaks what the father gives him in that hour he's just willing to die for the truth he's willing to stand on the conviction that God placed in our heart church we ought to be thankful when God gives us a conviction that we can stand upon I cannot and real and will not recant anything for to go against my conscience neither right nor safe here I stand I cannot do otherwise God help me amen so he's facing death in the face from this uh religious government and he says I'm not going to follow people that contradict themselves I only take I only take confidence in the word of God because the Bible doesn't contradict itself God cannot lie God always tells the truth God's word can never fail God's word is eternal God's word is harmonious Hallelujah and here I stand I stand upon the word of God I cannot do otherwise God help me amen God help us to stand on the word of God no matter who leaves you no matter who forsakes you no matter who mocks you makes fun of you tries to persecute you stand on the word of God that's all God's asking you to do brother Braham sat now listen listen but said that life came out of Luther into Wesley so what did Wesley do he stood in front of those crowds and he let a few Stones hit him right he had to dodge we watched a we watched a Wesley video this week didn't we Caris the guys knocked him down and they picked him up again then he started preaching to him and it brought conviction to these guys that were going to beat him up and kill him his just his humility he kep he kept calling them good sir good good sir and these these angry mobs got mad like we're not good what do you mean he kept saying good sir he kept uh being humble and then eventually these leaders repented God spared his life now church that life is in you did everybody hear me the life that was in Luther to stand there and say I won't go against the word I'm not going to compromise that life went into John Wesley that life went into William Seymour that life went into William brandom and now that life is in you Hallelujah same life it's not a different life it's the same life Hallelujah Romans 9 uh Romans 5:9 and 10 tell us this much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by what his life see that life that was in Luther to stand there against an angry councel that would murder you like a trial a death sense that same life that was in Luther is in you and church that's how we know preachers even Bram Tabernacle any ones that contradict themselves we cannot follow what they say Bram Tabernacle will say uh every word is thus sayith the Lord and and it's infallible brother br will say I'm not infallible now who's who's right brother br will say there's mixups on the tapes Bram tab Tabernacle will say every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord so see there's contradictions and so we must use what God gave us God gave us a human Spirit we must use this in order to discern good from Evil thank God there's The Spar of discernment in the church today it can judge if that spirit is from the devil or that spirit is from God hallelujah said the bride comes out of each age the denominational shut dies so each one dies the life is coming up right to the seed so that other part gets ready to die and the life keeps going on he said life flows right out of the shuck into the wheat you can't beat nature that's how God does these things so I hope somebody's encouraged today if the life that was in Martin Luther Flo into Wesley and then William Seymour and then brother brandham remember brother Bram said he would be in meetings overseas I think it was Germany if I'm not mistaken maybe Finland and he said they had to have armed guards protecting him because there was snipers out there going to shoot him so there was time he was in very dangerous situations now what caused him to do that the same life that was in Luther was in William brandom Hallelujah willing to put his life on the line in order to stand for the truth and so we have that same life we must be willing to put our lives on the line to stand for the truth of God that goes with our conscience that goes with the word of God you cannot beat nature that's how God does things and remember this I'm going to preach a little bit maybe on the election here tonight but remember this Jesus said the tears will be bound first before the weat is Harvest so brother R said brother Ram says in the church book this is happening now the tears are being bound together in an economical movement now right now Church of course we see this in the Democratic party but like I showed you a few months ago this is also in the Republican party right uh the Christians are uniting with Hind hus and siks and Janes uh and and Jews and and they're all uniting what it seems like to be for a good cause but if but if they contradict God's word and say that the god of the seeks is the god of Christianity now they're lying now that's Antichrist right that's why we don't Unite with parties right because we're already United to Christ it's time for Christ and the bride to unite you can't beat nature Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of Sodom he said when the Son of Man reveals himself the word made known for the day he said the Holy Spirit making that word live amongst us now that's what we should pray for that's what we should strive for Lord let your spirit live amongst us hallelujah Glory that's what uh brother says no now I'm going to say this he says he said' let the Holy Spirit make the word live among us he said but I said we can still listen and hear the son of man on tape right we can still hear the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking through brother brandham Hallelujah Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart now I'm going to pull up a a quote I sent to Troy suy this week he and I were texting you shouldn't take me just a second man it's amazing how many texts you get in a week in 1959 did you know the Holy Ghost took over brother Ram's voice while he was doing a discernment line did you ever hear this quote brother Ram said is he pulsating you so who's giving you life is it Christ or is it your own human life now look brother man he instantly goes to this he says I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave brother R's talking he's saying I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the dead I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost brother is quoting this I'm the one that give the promise brother brandham has nothing to do in this and the church said now he had to yield himself but we're talking about the power who has power to raise Jesus from the grave brother random no only God could do that that's what he's saying other words God has orchestrated that I'm sending my seven Church age messenger I'm sending the seventh angel to finish the mystery of God to show the son of man sign to the Gentiles because the Gentiles never saw the Messiah side only the Jews and Samaritans but thank God the Gentiles get to see it Hallelujah you know one of the greatest compliments I ever got was was from Sister FL Florence Humes down there in North Carolina she was the one healed when brother Bram prayed for her over tuberculosis in 1956 after the sermon she shook my hand she said You Preach just like brother brandham and I said thank you sister that's probably the one of the greatest compliments I could ever get to try to preach just like the prophet of God not trying to in purpose on purpose to mimic him but to preach the same word that he preached Hallelujah that the life of brother randam which was really the life of Martin Luther and John Wesley could now flow from the the church age messenger into the fivefold ministry Hallelujah he said brother brandom has nothing to do in this he's only surrendered his life to me I'm using his Spirit I'm talking through his lips that's me I'm the Lord this is and preachers have used this over the years that's how yielded brother randam was to the Holy Ghost remember he'd say I'm kind of stalling now he would tell stories about discernment you know the woman at the well he then he say oh he's here now and that's when the Holy Ghost would take over he'd say I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that same son of man Ministry that was in Jesus Hall that Jesus was Hallelujah and he was so yielded he could say it's has nothing to do with brother randam it's God I'm using his lips and God help us that God could speak through our lips Hallelujah that we could talk the same thing the spirit would say because the spirit and the bride say come to the marriage supper of the Lamb hallelujah what a blessing bam said then God Discerning like Luke 17:30 turned his back to Sarah in the tent and Sarah laughed but it was God Discerning her heart just like was God Discerning the hearts of the people in brother bram's Ministry he says uh but that God was Elohim and that Elohim was Jesus so it was Jesus in the days of Abraham and Sarah it was the spirit of God not the body of Christ formed in the Virgin Mary but it was the spirit of Jesus the logos and brother manam said the Bible predicts it will return again in the last days he says and when it does he says this happens he said today it is Sodom if there ever was a Sodom think about that statement from 1965 couldn't we say the same today if there ever was a Sodom it's a Sodom today he said their minds are so perverted he said the people are on the Rampage of in indecency men are hanging on to their tradition he said they're blind to the word of God now we come to near nearly the hour mark of this sermon and brother B says we better hurry I think that lady wants us to leave I see her motioning her hand we better hurry and then he preaches for 42 minutes that's kind of like me I'll say I'm going to close but it's going to be 42 minutes later okay but that's that's how brother did it if you listen to it there's still 42 minutes left and then he takes eight more minutes on more types of the Rapture after going deep into Revelation 10 and the life of God in the church he says we are now living in the seven Church Age The Mysteries would be revealed by the son a man confirming his message the set now now he he breaks into an interesting thought I don't know if you ever heard this lately he said Enoch comes in the seventh watch now I think he meant to say Church age because then he goes into how the night was divided into four watches how many know it was divided into four four watches from 6:00 p.m. to 900 P p.m. was the first watch of the night right because Jews started the day at sundown they started the next day at sundown we started uh at in the middle of the night really the second watch was 9 to midnight I was up last night with Zion coffin at midnight the second watch I was up going to the Third Watch so was Mal Lydia the Third Watch was 12 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. and the Fourth Watch was 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. brother R somehow breaks into this thought here and I don't have quite this understood but I just want to let you know about it brother said now the seventh watch Enoch he says ' the night wasn't divided in hours there's three watches of the night but actually then he says uh oh okay yeah he says three watches but there's actually four the Bible says there's four watches now and brother R said now I believe the Rapture will take place some morning between 6: and 9 a.m. and then he quotes the hymn The Trumpet of the Lord shall sound on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise and and the glory of his resurrection share how many know there's people that they believe the Rapture is going to happen between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. there's songs about it there's a message song uh we used to sing it at Sheffield uh some early morning between s now they say 7 and 9 something's going to happen on this Earth it's going to happen all around the earth it kind of starts off with between seven and nine but here brother Ram says six and nine but if you go to Acts chapter 2 I think there is some some little evidence we can get here or maybe like a clue perhaps it's not but uh the Bible says it was yet not the third hour of the day uh acts 2:15 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day when did the Holy Ghost fall to start the church the third hour day that would have been 9:00 a. so the Holy Ghost fell before 9:00 a.m. cuz first they had to receive it they had to worship and then they had to go out in the streets and declare all the wonderful works of God hallelujah so uh is it thus sayith the Lord the Rapture is going to happen between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. no but we do have at least one Bible witness if the if the church ages started between six and N perhaps they'll finish between six and nine so the thing to be do or the thing to do church is be ready but if you want to know that's where we get this idea some people say oh the Rapture is going to be between six and N9 we get get it from this sermon the Rapture 1965 Hallelujah then brother R says the word rapture is not even in the Bible at all the Bible uses the term caught up harpazo and then uh brother random reads he breaks right into his scripture he knows he doesn't have much time left the woman says you got to get out of this hotel he goes right to quoting first Thessalonians 41 13-16 and he misquotes the book he says let's go to Second Thessalonians okay so can everybody see that like I told you last week there's two obvious statements in this sermon that are clearly not thus sayith the Lord there is no shout voice and Trump in 2 Thessalonians okay but what would it take somebody to say there is it is I believe it is thus sayith the Lord what would it take for somebody to believe that a lying Spirit Hallelujah let's have the spirit of Truth amongst us hallelujah glory to God he says there's three things that has to happen before the Lord appears a shout a voice and a trumpet this is at the hour and three minute Mark he says first comes a shout he said Jesus does all three of them when he's descending he says it's a shout what is a shout it's a message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride all right now some people call themselves The Midnight Cry now let me I just thought about that verse let me pull that one up there was a cry made now the word cry means a outcry or a clamor there was a Midnight Cry behold the bridegroom comes go out to meet them Hallelujah and the word trim your lamps means to set in order to make ready to prepare to ornament uh to embellish with honor to gain honor so the trim your lamps means to set your life in order ornament your life with the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'll say it like that in other words wash your garments white in the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now see so brother Ram sets this up and church that's why you know as we talked last week you know this is how I believe the shop voice Trump I believe the shout started with brother random in 1963 now I could be wrong but I got a quote for it Hallelujah and the way he brings it out is that it has to make it ready he has uh he says it it's the Living Word bringing forth the bride how many know there are still people realizing their bride Church you just got to jump in your car right now you could be there in two hours and 40 minutes drive straight South let's see which way South here where am I at here North is that South that's North that's South I lost my bearings here yeah that's North I think right yep that's North so South so you got to drive that way two and a half hours drive that way and you'll run into a city uh called Junction City and you'll find some former Amish people that have just realize they're the bride Hallelujah the shout the Midnight Cry has gone out to them uh behold the bridegroom comes make yourself ready hallelujah oh my like brother iring gave us his testimony last month for was it 50 some years 56 years he didn't even know there was a Rapture but God was gracious and God sent him the Midnight Cry and now he's making himself ready Hallelujah I hope you're making yourself ready today don't fall into the sleep don't go back to sleep Hallelujah right that's what the parable says some people will fall asleep in their spiritual life let's stay awake Hallelujah keep your lamp trimmed keep your life in order to trim your lamp means to set it in order to arrange your life in a way that would please God and be ready for the Rapture he says Jesus does all of these while he's descending brother Ram says God never changes his policy Amos 37 he quotes Amos 37 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His Secrets unto his servants the prophets God will do nothing until he reveals it to his servants the prophets and then he quotes Malachi 45 and 6 behold I send you Elijah the prophet he shall turn the hearts of the children to the fathers Hallelujah he says Malachi 4 has returned again a prophet is in the land god uses that Elijah Spirit five times five is the number of great brother says remember the message is Promised the the rise and trim your lamp message of the Rapture and when all these Mi Mysteries has been all bundled up by a bunch of Ecclesiastes it will take a direct Prophet from God to reveal it and that's exactly what he promised to do he said the prophet is the reflector of God's word and then he even uses balam he said balum couldn't he could only say what God put in his mouth and then brother Ram says' whatever you were like a prophet a prophet is born that way whatever you are you were born that way you can't make yourself something that you're not and then he breaks into this thought like I said last week brother manam said nobody stood before the prophet to judge him and that's true I just want to say that one more time now the the most message churches are are misinterpreting this they're saying brother Ram says you know when there's a minor prophet in the church and they would say thus sayith the Lord tomorrow is going to happen two or three people need to pray about that and judge that is that from God or not before it's accepted by the church that's a gift of Prophecy and church even dreams uh even dreams that we have amongst ourselves they should be judged now we don't do that because what do we because none of us ever announced well I had a dream it's thus sayith the Lord who's ever done that here right we don't go around well I had a dream it's thus say the now if somebody said that then it's time to get some judges on that right somebody would say I had a dream is thus say the Lord okay now let's pray and judge it let's get who's got the sermon let's judge the dream but brother man said nobody stood before like prophet Isaiah or Prophet Moses to judge him and that's true nobody did but Church what did God do God gave Joshua Joshua was a prophet God gave Joshua vindications so the people knew he was a prophet so what I'm saying is nobody stands before a prophet but you still have to prove what the prophet says prove all things the Bible says amen does ever understand that amen hallelujah that's that's critical to understand because the the message churches are using this nobody nobody can correct a Prophet by basically saying nobody can disagree with the quotes that I like but there's other quotes on that same topic you have to consider Hallelujah so it's very important to recognize that quote yes nobody stood before Moses uh to to correct him or judge him but they still had to stand there and Pro prove all things to make sure it came to pass Hallelujah that's right so this nobody stands before a prophet to judge him that's only referring to the thus sayith the Lord From The Prophet it must apply to Isaiah when he said a vergin shall conceive and Prophets only wrote down what what God told them to write down they just have a gift to say what only God says right that's what a prophet has you and I would wonder and say I don't know if this is God or not but a prophet is not like that they know when God saying thus sayith the Lord that's that's just how they're built Hallelujah now he says there's such a thing as a gift of Prophecy he said but a prophet is ordained for the hour he said every Revival died when they organized like Pentecost of 1906 I'm talking I'm I'm not talking about Pentecost of Acts chapter 2 that Revival is still going on Amen like we said last week how many have it still burning in your heart it's burning now within my heart Oh Glory to his name Hallelujah I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them Hallelujah he said every Revival did the same thing he said you Assemblies of God you turn like a dog to its vomit he said you shut up your vows of compassion and now you have to have almost a fellowship card to even associate harle so bam says see they went into organization you got to have some type of aard to even fellowship with somebody that's an organization and that's what I was telling my children you know they were asking about the fourth horse rider I no maybe it was brother Claude or brother Patrick last week after church it was Cloud am thank good memory sir good memory that fourth horse rider is writing now his name is death and brother Braham said see now brother Braham said God I don't know if you know this brother Braham said God accepted seminaries and organ organizations till this end time because now the horse rider riding and those organizations are dead think about that church did you know Martin Luther went to a seminary do you know John Wesley was taught vigorously in the word of God Charles Spurgeon went to Seminary something brother calls them the greatest preachers that preach the greatest sermons with the greatest writing and they went to Seminary brother raham said God had a season to use it but now that season's over because death is riding spiritual death has struck the denominations church we should have life here we should have the same life of Martin Luther in this church amen if we are the true bride of Christ Hallelujah which I believe amen I believe I'm a part of it praise God well then let's Express The Life of Christ let's show the love of Jesus Christ let's pray for the power of God to move let's have the same Life of Christ Hallelujah then he now he rebukes Assemblies of God then he rebukes the Oneness which is closer to us you Oneness he said instead of just going ahead and keeping humble with your Revelation that God's one person you organize your group and where you at now he said the same bucket of slops right and I have numerous oness friends of we've brother Jose is that is that AC church is that a Oneness or is that a trinitarian church do do you know it's okay if you don't know Unitarian one one one one God okay so they're are Oneness yeah so they might be a part of the UPC United Pentecostal Church okay right and they used to not so they're slowly compromising like when I like uh even in the early 2000s when I went to the West Church's ey they actually didn't wear high heels and they didn't let women preach but now they let women preach and now they wear high heels so just within 20 years the majority of them has compromised see that's what happens when you compromise on the word of God death sets in oh Church we've got to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered for the saints that will keep us in the life of God that will keep us in the love of God we can make no compromises we must live based upon our conscience of what the word of God says here we stand on God's word hallelujah oh glory to God thank you Jesus he said it's God's spirit moving on brother Ram said God's spirit will keep moving on uh let me look up a verse real quick ACAA I forgot to look this this one up plant water there's a scripture brother B quotes where I he said I the Lord God have planted it and I will water it day and night anybody know what verse I'm talking about I can't find it you water it plant anth in water day and night I'll look it up Lord wining for the second service thank you for your patience here I the Lord have planted it and I will water it day and night so brother raham is basically showing if a church won't take the water of the word of God God will send water to the fresh Revival amen he'll bring a church out of a church Hallelujah that's right glory to God Amen I'm coming down on my clothes here by God's grace Hallelujah now after that break he gets back to the shout voice and Trump after he looked at uh the idea on prophets Hallelujah he says now the first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout now here's where people disagree and which they're allowed to brother Braham said while Jesus is descending the shout Goes Forth that's where some people and you know I understand it too it's hard to understand how is he descending and then how is the Rapture already started right that's hard to understand I said that we were talking about that last week but there's a quote on it that's what brother says there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together a message comes forth now lamp trimming time so he says it twice in the sermon rise and trim your lamps watch or what watch was that the seventh or not the sixth I think he's talking about the church age what church age was that the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't have any oil in their lamp see but it's lamp trimming time so church it's lamp trimming time set your lives in order he said it's Malachai 4 time our hearts getting turned back to the apostolic father he said it's Luke 17 time amen the son of man Discerning the thoughts and intents of our hearts Hallelujah all these prophecy that can fit perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture we see it living right here so brother could say I see all these verses living right now amongst us I see John 1613 living right here God is guiding us into all truth hallelujah I see Ephesians 4 living amongst us the Holy Ghost through the five-fold ministry is bringing us into the stature of the fullness of Christ it's uniting our faith Hallelujah faith in the word of God hallelujah amen see that's what the true bride of Christ does they focus on what unifies them not what divides them Hallelujah and that's what God is doing with our church God Is uniting Us with all the churches that are born again God's uniting us under the true doctrines the true Revelations the Mysteries that's been finished Hallelujah God's uniting our hearts with them that's right it's uniting time Hallelujah now look at this statement brother Ram says he quotes uh lamp trimming time Malachi four time Luke 17:30 son of man Ministry time and then he says I see these things happen my dear brother when God in heaven knows I could die on this platform right now that that's quite a statement brother R says these are coming to pass and they're coming to pass I could die on this platform now if I'm not telling the truth and what was the last time you heard a preacher say that see brother M was trying to get the people to see God is fulfilling these scriptures Hallelujah you just ought to walk around a little he said it's tremendous when you see God come down from heaven stand before groups of men and stand there declare himself just as he ever did that's the truth this Bible open and the denominational system is dead it's gone it'll never rise again it'll be burned that's what you do with the husk on the field look he goes back to Nature flee from it get into Christ and how do you get into Christ by one Spirit we're all baptized into that body Hallelujah don't say I belong to Methodist I belong to baptist I belong to Pentecostal I belong to bride of Christ Fellowship you get into Christ we don't belong to anybody but Jesus Hallelujah now brother br will present us as a bride to Christ but we don't even belong to brother brandham we belong to Jesus hallelujah we're the bride of Christ not the Bride of a prophet or a bride of a messenger we're the Bride of Jesus Christ and if you're in Christ there's not a word written in here but what you believe and he didn't raise up his church age book or anything like that now the church age book is a good book but he raised up the Bible I don't care what anybody else said and then God makes that thing manifested because you when he pours the spirit upon the word what happens it's just like putting water on any seed it'll live and it'll bring forth of its own kind so see Church anyone that walks in here I've i' I've preached too long not to understand it if I'm preaching under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the and they accept it if they let that water fall in there and there's a seed in there it will bring forth Hallelujah nothing is going to stop it because it's the word of God hallelujah we just planted some echonous seeds you know at school and the W the the teacher said just puts just put it there by the window put some water on it it'll sprout right and my wife said yeah you could do that just throw it outside it'll Sprout on its own you don't got to put it by the window and I just poured a few waters in it pretty soon after a few days they start sprouting up and the kids come right up and say it's sprouted it's sprouted that's what happens here when we preach the word of God if water falls on it and it's a genuine seed of God people will believe the word they'll love the Bible Hallelujah because the seed that's in them wrote the Bible Hallelujah so we have nothing to worry about praise God all that's predestinated will come to God hallelujah because it's a seed it's the life it's the power of the seed working in The Believer it's a seed of God working in me Hallelujah glory to God the seed must bring forth of its own kind now brother BR breaks into a real he calls it Stinger later or earlier he calls it a real Stinger you Pentecostals say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother BR said that don't mean that you're saved not by long ways a church I I told you this story I don't I don't know if you remember it was probably uh 2008 or 2009 I I was in a Minister's meeting with brother cam brother Brooks there in Lima Ohio and a brother was there and at the end of the The Minister's meeting he read that quote and he said what does this mean how can you have the Holy Ghost uh and not be saved and he went on he said is it this is it that and I was just a young Pastor I didn't know well when I got home I thought well I'm Just a Fool I'll just go read what brother Ram say I read it and then right after it look at the next word so I was puzzled this Minister puzzled uh puzzled all of us right and then what when I went home and read it I just read the next sentence the next two sentences brother R says' lookie here you're a Triune being so what's he getting into the three parts of man brother R says Pentecostals they'll all say it right they'll say it at at the AC Church they said it at at my church growing up they say I've got the baptism I've spoken tongues and brother man said you can have that baptism and you're not even saved sometimes because you're a Triune being right so look look how simple look how simple this this this question is answered if we just keep reading in the quote now the reason I bring this up is because I eventually had that preacher come preach for us out of kindness we had some good Fellowship but then within 10 years he left the message uh and he denied brother R was a prophet he said brother R was a racist um I think he was upset because he didn't get a pastor position he was trying to get and so a lot of people when they get hurt by message churches or message people they'll turn on them and just go and find all these things that make it look like there's something wrong with the message and then I even have a screenshot still this day he uh he went to this denom and he was playing rock and roll he was he was the bass guitar for the rock and roll Christian band and he posted it on Facebook when I used to be on Facebook and he said what a blankety blank sermon today pastor and he used cuss words he said what a blankety blank sermon that was I mean cursing about a sermon a man who used to say he had the Holy Ghost a man that used to dress modestly but now doesn't dress modestly his wife used to have long hair now she cuts her hair and wears pants and wears makeup see these little things these little things that people don't sit down long enough brother says they don't get in the spirit of Revelation may God help us to get in the spirit of Revelation Hallelujah may we dig deeper May the Holy Ghost take us deeper in the word of God so we're not fooled by these things so we can't be offended out of the message but we go deeper into the message of God's word hallelujah oh my so what did I do when when I'm when I'm faced with that question what I do I go back to the quote and read the quote again and then take that back to the scripture this guy just goes on U doesn't read the rest of it doesn't go back to the scripture doesn't ask questions gets offended and then now turns on the message each of us have a choice what are you going to do with this Jesus called Christ what are you going to do Hallelujah time is the greatest tester of all things give it some time let's see I remember a a brother that used to be in the message he he gave a good word uh this I'll just say brother Tim Myers you know when I preached down there U remember in 2017 you you were just a little guy I preached down there and God fully Vindicated that that that message on the Waters of Separation after that brother Tim Myers reached out to George Smith Brother Ram son-in-law and brother Tim told me this he said brother Jesse's uh gifted by God and and you know what brother George said brother law he said let's just give him some time and let's see what comes out of his life before we get too excited about brother Jesse's Ministry let's give him some time I thought that's a real wise man right there now I've never talked to him uh Jose emails him and calls him right brother so look here we are uh three seven years later almost eight years later given brother Jesse some time have I stayed with the message or have I gone against it I've stayed with it I Believe by the grace of God I've only tried to defend it more growing more revelation of it Hallelujah uh understand it more preach it amen and more than that live the life before the people hallelujah that's what we must do we must live the life in front of the people because ultimately it's a life hallelujah look at here brother said you're a trium being inside this little fellow here is the soul the next is the spirit and the next is the body now you got five senses in this body to contact your Earthly home they don't contact the rest of it you got five senses of the spirit here love and conscience and so forth of that but in here is where you live that's where you are didn't Jesus say the rain falls and the just and the unjust so see Church let's take a moment in your soul there's a nature that's who you really are Hallelujah that's who you really are is your is your human nature is it quickened by the Holy Ghost so you can say Amen to every word of God and you can believe every word of God that's what brother BR brings us down to with Pentecostals they got tongues shouting uh jumping blood out of their hands he says a and said he had blood out of his hands all this uh unscriptural things he said it boils down to you do you have the nature of God that's born in your soul that will produce Christ in your life that's the test do you have the life of the seed Hallelujah and if you're not born again do you have the seed there but it's there but it's waiting to be quickened do you have a seed that can be quickened to the word of God hallelujah so the rain falls on the just and the unjust brother quotes Matthew 242 24 he said there be many false prophets and false christs he said they're not anointed to the word they're just anointed to their gifts church you can see it some people have tremendous gifts like I told you Joe OST he has all these testimonies on there on his website last time I checked people healed of cancer and uh all these things well no doubt I mean it's possible if he gets gets in the channel and speaks you know life and God's A Healer of your body and God has given that gift it's going to manifest Hallelujah any gift that's in your life if you can just get under the anointing and get that gift consecrated to God it's going to produce Hallelujah but brother and makes the distinguishment your gifts are anointed but is your life anointed is the soul anointed and quickened by the word of God are you quickened by the word in your soul Hallelujah because remember your gifts are in your human spirit right the gifts are in your human spirit because you can have that anointed and like balam or Judas still not have this Anointed The Soul he said they're false anointed ones he said it's just like the genuine anointing the genuine anointing fell on Caiaphas and he said one man must die for the nation and it was thus say the Lord Jesus died for the whole nation of Israel and then balam prophesied a star will rise out of Jacob and that's what happened Hallelujah brother Ram said so don't he says any of them Sensations and so forth forget it so here brother Ram brings down the evidence of the Holy Ghost listen what he says he said what's the evidence it's your heart in that word and that's Christ he's trying to get the people don't look the sensations or shouting or jumping or Screaming or tongues those are all good things but he said it's your heart in that word and the word word is Christ I just love it brother brother says it in so many different ways out the evidence of the Holy Ghost he says it he says sometimes it's the fruit sometimes it's believing in the word in the word all the way uh and here he says it it's your heart in that word and that word is Christ bring it in there and watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed and declares itself for the age it's living in Hallelujah he said Luther could bring nothing but sprig these others could bring other things we're in the wheat age now Luther's genuine Luthers had to bring forth genuine Luther genuine Pentecost had to bring forth genuine Pentecost that's all but we're past that age and we're going on and then he says because the spirit of death is here if the Catholic Church started as the Pentecostal he said look at the Catholic church now look at the Catholic church now all the prayer beads right all the all all the relics and so forth you know people are attracted to it because it looks so holy but it's not holy looks can be deceiving what's the life of that Catholic person right watch their words watch uh What uh watch what they think is holy or Unholy watch their life and we got good Catholic friends right we got but watch their life look what kind of life they're living the life they live shows which seed is on the inside and church with some of them we just got to we just got to trust there's a seed in there that's not yet quickened and that would be foolish virgin right but if we are the true seed of God our seed should be quickened and we should be putting forth the life that everybody can see here's a real Christian Life Hallelujah brother makes a statement he says if the Catholic church was the former Pentecostal he said if 2,000 years pass the Pentecostal would be worse than the Catholic think about that I was raised the Pentecostal church that's why it seems shocking to me it would be worse if you gave the current Pentecostals all their tongues and all their crazy charismatic things they do now if you gave them 2,000 years it'd be worse than the Catholic church is right now I'm closing with this he says brother BR breaks back into his ministry when I went forth into the meetings with you praying for the sick it was fine but when I come with a message if any message Goes Forth and it's a true message if it's a true genuine miracles of god but if it hangs in that organization you know it's not God because that thing is already declared dead Okay so let's look at Jesus Jesus had all the Miracles did he stay with the Pharisees Sadducees no he came out of there any genuine move of God Luther did he stay in the Catholic Church no he come out of it condemned it so so with brother brandom because he brought a true Revelation a true word of God he couldn't stay a part of those organizations he had to come out and start a new he says organism hallelujah amen and we are a living organism of the mystical body of Jesus Christ hallelujah we're organized by the word of God not by man's Creed because we have the Life of Christ that unites us with all the bride around the world Amen Hallelujah you know it's not God if it hangs right there in the organization because it's already been declared dead Jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch their eyes the people and then his message came that's right it has to have something that God is going to introduce Divine Healing his miracles like that to just catch the eyes of the people the main heart of it is the message so let me pause right there you know I feel led maybe if if God terries in 2025 or whatever happens if we are still allowed to have church whatever happens hopefully we have many more years but we'll see but I like to take the young people through the life of brother brandham and just show all these amazing Miracles when he got saved and the polls and his ups and downs I like to just put it on uh and and go through all these stories uh so because I've tried myself I've tried to do this I've tried to get you the main thing the main thing is the bible message the scriptures Hallelujah that's what brother said that's the main heart of it is the message now all the stories that will raise your faith Hallelujah right and that's why I tell some of those stories uh like the armor company I told that a few weeks ago you know keep washing those dishes Saints right Jesus is coming back for a bride amen he promised he's coming back Hallelujah just stay at your posted Duty Hallelujah be the bride but there's many stories out there that that might encourage uh the faith of our children they've encouraged me over the years and I like to put them down I like to go through them kind of slowly so you can see some of these highlights but Church uh you know brother R says even in his Divine Healing and his miracles the main heart of it is the message that's what it is he says it what comes from in here he's trying to get favor of the people so they'll set and listen to him see for there's some in there that's ordained to life Hallelujah some of the grain the wheat fell on ground the birds picked it up and others fell amongst thorns and some was went on prepared ground pre-prepared ground and brought forth Hallelujah so I want you to see that brother Ram's Divine Healing and his miracles and his discernments that's all powerful that's part of it but brother Ram said God gave him all those gifts and discernment to catch the eyes of the people so that they would see who the mother Harlot is and they could come out of death and come into life Hallelujah and have the real life of Jesus Christ that's the message Hallelujah let's stand our feet musicians can come here by God's grace would youa put up uh Mark 4: 26 I didn't really realize it till yesterday and I have a whole section on this in my book The Three works of Grace are seen through this here this idea of the wheat the life in the seed and he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground verse 27 and should sleep and Rise not I'm sorry and Rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how that's like each one of us we don't understand really how we grow as Believers right we repent we yield we do our best to obey and worship but somehow God causes us to grow Hallelujah I can't explain it but Jesse how could you grow and how could you leave the chapel and leave uh somebody's of God how could you leave your mom's church I don't know somehow somehow the life of God was in me and it just grew in me Hallelujah I can't explain it but I know it's happened Hallelujah I'm just Dr drawn to it because the spiritual seed of God has to produce itself this is the kingdom of God for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear so you have Luther Wesley and then brother Brandon of course there's not a four step some some of them have four some of them have three verse 29 but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because because the Harvest has come so see he only harvest the grain he only harvest the seven Church age aren't we glad that we know that by the grace of God let's bow our heads for a word of prayer here father God we're thankful for the ministry of the seventh angel Lord God I've surely been joying Lord these reviews and Lord some new things fresh things Lord God from this message Lord God we thank you for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Lord God God we're thankful there's a seed of God in us as the parable says Lord God and God alls we want Lord is to keep laying in the presence of the sun Lord and letting the Waters of the Holy Spirit refresh our lives dear God that we could grow up into Christ in all things as the scripture tells us Lord God lord May each person today Lord take it uh an examination at their lamps is their lamp trimmed is their life in order oh God help us to get it in order Lord God has their heart been turned back by Malachi 4 5 and 6 do their hearts look like the apostolic fathers we see there in the book of Acts God let me look at my heart as well Lord God hallelujah you're doing this Lord as you're descending you're getting a people ready with the bread of life the bridegroom has come go you out to meet him or we're making our lives ready for the coming of the Lord father I quote your Prophet here it's your life and that word and that word is Christ Lord May each person have a real evidence of the Holy Ghost in their lives Lord God may they not take somebody's word for it but may they look for the word manifesting itself in their Liv life Hallelujah Grant it Lord Jesus for a seed will produce of its own kind and a word seed can only produce a word life thank you Lord for building life upon life word upon [Music] word Lord I pray that we would have the [Music] courage of the fifth Church age messenger if we should ever have persecution that we could say here I stand upon my conscience upon the scripture because the scripture doesn't contradict itself God give us a life like that Hallelujah that life flow through Wesley and brother brandham and isua and Lord may it flow into us as well if a friend or family member or loved one husband spouse grandma grandpa someone would try to come against the truth of God in us may we stand upon the word of God I pray Grant it Lord Jesus we want to be ready for thy coming Lord God we're looking we're watching and waiting Lord Jesus strengthen us God by your amazing grace and mercy thank you for the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
