[0:00] let's go to saint john chapter 18 this
[0:03] morning
[0:07] appreciate those songs how many want to
[0:08] fly on the wings of faith praise god the
[0:11] word of god says it and spoken to us
[0:14] we'll believe it and that power of god's
[0:16] already in it praise god if we just
[0:18] receive it the power of god will lift us
[0:20] up praise god
[0:21] for the word is power
[0:23] amen
[0:29] john chapter 18 verse 18. i'd like to
[0:31] continue on this thought on
[0:33] the power
[0:35] of jesus's doctrine
[0:39] i believe it's a very needful subject
[0:45] and i think you do too so we're thankful
[0:47] for god's grace i'd like to i got a few
[0:49] slides here so i'd like to show some of
[0:50] those just a moment
[0:53] john 18 verse 18 we'll read
[0:56] 18-20
[1:01] [Music]
[1:10] john 18 18-20
[1:20] of course this is christ
[1:22] he was recently arrested on the night
[1:25] judas betrayed him
[1:27] and he's being questioned
[1:29] in the house of the high priest caiaphas
[1:35] and
[1:37] notice here how he
[1:40] he tells the high priest and all the all
[1:42] those that are
[1:43] having him on trial
[1:45] notice what he says when they ask him
[1:47] about his doctrine notice what he says
[1:51] so john 18 verse 18.
[1:56] i'll read 18-19 then we can all read
[1:58] verse 20 together so i'll read 18 myself
[2:01] and the servants and officers stood
[2:03] there who had made a fire of coals for
[2:05] it was cold
[2:06] and they warmed themselves and peter
[2:08] stood with them and warmed himself
[2:12] i'll read verse 19 the high priest then
[2:14] asked jesus
[2:16] of his disciples
[2:18] and of his doctrine
[2:20] so think about that when the word gets
[2:22] put on trial
[2:24] why is the word on trial
[2:26] because the unbelievers disagree with
[2:28] the doctrine
[2:30] and remember this is going to repeat
[2:31] again this is still repeating today
[2:34] because the bible says the sinners
[2:35] crucify the son of god afresh
[2:38] they're constantly crucifying the
[2:40] effects of the holy spirit and the
[2:42] effects of the holy spirit come through
[2:43] the doctrine
[2:45] praise god hopefully hopefully you saw
[2:46] that last sunday morning and wednesday
[2:48] night because you have to have teaching
[2:50] first you have to tell the people the
[2:52] way to get the anointing the way to get
[2:54] god's blessings
[2:56] so the teaching comes first and then the
[2:58] power flows after you're taught the word
[3:00] of god
[3:01] amen let's all read verse 20. can we one
[3:03] two three
[3:04] jesus answered him i spake openly
[3:08] to the world i ever taught in the
[3:11] synagogue and in the temple whither the
[3:14] jews always resort and in secret have i
[3:17] said nothing
[3:19] amen we'll get back to this here uh
[3:21] towards the middle of the sermon but
[3:22] let's bow our heads for a word of prayer
[3:24] if you have an e on your heart just make
[3:25] it known unto god
[3:26] god sees all the needs
[3:28] god knows all things
[3:30] as humans we know very little we're very
[3:32] limited but the almighty god is here
[3:34] hallelujah we've worshipped him we've
[3:35] sang to him we prayed to him we
[3:37] confessed our sins to him we've given
[3:38] him honor and glory we prayed for the
[3:40] sick we prayed for all the needs of the
[3:42] church and now lord god we just come to
[3:45] you in prayer so heavenly father we
[3:46] thank you for this opportunity lord god
[3:48] we're here in thanksgiving we're
[3:50] grateful lord for another opportunity to
[3:52] be in your house the house of prayer
[3:54] it's also a house of worship it's also a
[3:56] house of teaching and instruction and
[3:58] it's a house of miracles praise god
[4:00] hallelujah thank you god for your your
[4:02] mercy and your love lord god to us today
[4:05] anoint me lord anoint your people father
[4:06] we stand in need of you uh lord and we
[4:09] stand obeying your your promises lord we
[4:11] stand obeying your
[4:13] your commands lord god to come and
[4:15] assemble together more as we see that
[4:17] day approaching and lord with the
[4:19] promise that you will perfect us you'll
[4:20] bring us to completion and so god we
[4:23] thank you for it lord i pray you'll
[4:24] minister to each and every heart and
[4:26] receive all the glory honor and praise
[4:28] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[4:30] said
[4:31] amen god bless you as you're being
[4:32] seated praise god
[4:36] so i'm going to pick up a little bit on
[4:38] what i was saying last sunday
[4:41] uh as i preach there for my house i have
[4:43] a few things i skipped past there
[4:47] i just want to briefly review a little
[4:48] bit here
[4:51] so last sunday we basically looked at
[4:53] all the
[4:54] scriptures about jesus and doctrine we
[4:56] looked at all them and then as i uh
[4:58] studied this week i thought oh yeah
[5:00] that's right i need to look up the words
[5:01] that mean or all the words about jesus
[5:03] with teaching and talked
[5:05] those two words
[5:07] and so that's what i preached on
[5:08] wednesday night i just started that
[5:10] wednesday night we'll finish it today
[5:11] lord willing
[5:13] um
[5:14] and so we looked at uh jesus's doctrine
[5:16] and we showed how preaching is different
[5:18] from doctrine
[5:20] preaching is declaring what god has done
[5:23] and what god will do that's preaching
[5:25] so when you hear preachers say god is
[5:27] going to heal you god is going to do
[5:29] miracles that's preaching the word of
[5:30] god
[5:32] now when they start telling you how to
[5:35] possess those promises now we're getting
[5:37] into teaching
[5:38] for example uh jesus's disciples
[5:41] couldn't cast out a devil they said how
[5:43] come this devil's not going out he said
[5:45] because only some kind go out through
[5:46] prayer and fasting
[5:48] so see jesus had to teach them these
[5:50] deeper concepts so they can
[5:52] uh enjoy the benefits or the anointing
[5:54] of the holy spirit
[5:56] so hopefully everybody can understand
[5:57] that
[5:58] brother branham says
[6:00] he also tells us as well if we want to
[6:02] be healed by god the bible says confess
[6:03] your faults one to another so when we're
[6:06] teaching about divine healing we have to
[6:08] teach first first confess all your sins
[6:11] first make everything right then believe
[6:13] the promise of god
[6:15] but we can't expect to be
[6:16] anointed and have the blessing of god if
[6:18] we haven't kept the promises and obeyed
[6:21] the steps to receive the blessing
[6:23] just like on the day of pentecost my
[6:25] wife shared with this one with me
[6:26] good thought they said men and brother
[6:28] what shall we do how are we going to
[6:29] possess the holy ghost and peter gave
[6:31] him doctrine he said repent every one of
[6:33] you and be baptized and you shall
[6:36] receive the gift of the holy ghost see
[6:38] teaching always comes first right unless
[6:40] god specifically wants to show someone a
[6:42] miracle right like he hi like he healed
[6:44] the blind man without teaching him first
[6:45] you know there's different times god
[6:47] will just do miracles out of his grace
[6:49] and out of his mercy but many times with
[6:51] the gospel we have to teach people
[6:54] uh we all of us need to all right i need
[6:55] talk we all need talk we need uh talk
[6:58] how to possess a promise amen just like
[7:01] the holy spirit told joshua how to
[7:02] possess jericho amen
[7:04] how to possess ai how to possess uh
[7:08] how to protect the gibbonites how to
[7:10] possess all their land each time god
[7:12] would give them instruction on how to
[7:13] possess the promises of god and so we
[7:16] we've learned that we've learned there's
[7:17] a uh there's 158 new testament
[7:20] scriptures about doctrine and teaching
[7:22] compared to one on latter rain we looked
[7:24] at that last week we all want the latter
[7:27] rain
[7:27] who doesn't want rapturing faith i hope
[7:29] no hands go up who doesn't want
[7:31] rapturing faith well that's what the
[7:32] latter rain is well the bible only
[7:34] mentions it one time in the new
[7:35] testament eight times in the old
[7:36] testament why is there so little about
[7:39] it because the key to rapturing faith is
[7:41] to have faith right now
[7:43] be able to talk obey what the god has
[7:45] already said and then god will give you
[7:47] the faith at the end if you receive his
[7:49] faith for right now amen praise god if
[7:52] you receive his faith for the journey
[7:53] now he'll give you faith for the going
[7:55] home amen hallelujah praise god amen
[7:58] so it's very clear and we looked at all
[8:00] the we have quotes brother brahm talks
[8:02] about the difference between preaching
[8:03] and teaching
[8:04] and then there was i shared many quotes
[8:06] or i'm sorry not many but
[8:08] numerous quotes however brahms said i
[8:10] just love teaching because it settles
[8:12] the church of course he loved preaching
[8:14] as well and we saw how jesus the
[8:16] apostles and paul i think my children
[8:17] read it last sunday right everybody read
[8:20] a little bit about how all of them had
[8:22] preaching and teaching you have to have
[8:24] both imagine that i mean imagine that if
[8:28] a preacher or anybody uh a pastor would
[8:30] just preach all the time god's gonna
[8:31] bless you god's gonna bless you uh
[8:34] you're gonna get that financial blessing
[8:35] you're gonna you're gonna get that
[8:36] healing that would be encouraging
[8:39] but then you would at some point you
[8:41] would say well how am i going to get
[8:42] that
[8:43] what what can i do to inherit that but
[8:45] if it's just god's going to do it just
[8:47] confess you know as soon as they start
[8:49] giving some instruction then now you've
[8:51] got to obey the word of god
[8:54] right you have to obey the word of god
[8:55] so it can't be all just preaching all
[8:57] the time there is a place for that no
[8:59] doubt about it
[9:00] but as we saw last week as well jesus
[9:02] would go right from teaching to doing
[9:03] miracles
[9:05] it was that anointing so when the word
[9:07] of god was there when the when the when
[9:09] the presence of the holy spirit was
[9:10] there
[9:11] uh anointing him to teach the word of
[9:13] god then he would move over right into
[9:14] miracles and that's what of course i've
[9:16] seen in my ministry you know we've seen
[9:18] it here too we'll be preaching and
[9:19] teaching and then someone will come up
[9:20] for prayer and they'll get the healing
[9:22] praise god over there get the victory
[9:23] praise god
[9:25] because it's all tied in right you've
[9:27] got to instruct the people so they know
[9:28] what to do and then god will come around
[9:31] and answer prayers so it's all connected
[9:33] very closely together praise god now uh
[9:38] i you know i i think uh one thing i want
[9:40] to get let's go to ephesians four i'd
[9:41] like to uh i didn't get really get to
[9:43] this but i'd like to review just quickly
[9:44] about the fivefold ministry so let's go
[9:46] to ephesians four uh we know of course
[9:49] the fivefold ministry's under a great
[9:50] attack
[9:51] um
[9:53] you know especially out of uh the
[9:55] jeffersonville movement um
[9:58] but i want to just review again i'm
[9:59] looking for my note here on that
[10:04] so ephesians 4
[10:09] verse 8
[10:11] this will be good for austin alina's
[10:12] they're learning you know
[10:15] these elementary principles of the
[10:16] gospel
[10:19] ephesians 4 8
[10:26] wherefore he saith when he ascendeth up
[10:29] on high he led captivity
[10:31] captive and gave gifts unto men the
[10:33] speaking of christ when christ ascended
[10:34] he sent down gifts
[10:37] right and jesus said it's necessary that
[10:39] i go that the comforter will come it's
[10:41] better when the holy ghost is here
[10:42] rather than just one man
[10:44] right although he was god and flesh all
[10:46] the fullness of the godhead was bodily
[10:48] incarnate in christ he said it's better
[10:50] that everybody
[10:52] all the believers get a portion of the
[10:53] holy ghost he said it's better to have
[10:55] that
[10:56] right then just have one man everybody
[10:57] flock to that one man it's better
[10:58] because the gospel can be spread
[11:01] verse 9 now that he ascended what is it
[11:03] but that he also descended first into
[11:06] the lower parts of the earth
[11:08] he that descended is the same also that
[11:10] ascended up far above all heavens that
[11:12] he might fill
[11:13] all things
[11:15] praise god that's what we're saying he
[11:16] ascended up on high so he could send his
[11:18] holy spirit divide his holy spirit
[11:20] around the world praise god now he fills
[11:22] our church he feels brother brother
[11:23] brooks is church brother cam's church
[11:25] right he fills all these churches uh the
[11:27] churches in ghana amen
[11:29] he fills all these churches praise god
[11:31] because he fills all things amen
[11:33] hallelujah because of his great holy
[11:35] spirit
[11:36] verse 11 and he gave some apostles those
[11:38] are missionaries that start new churches
[11:41] he gave some prophets they're
[11:42] foretellers of the word of foretellers
[11:44] of the future
[11:46] uh revealers of the mysteries and some
[11:48] evangelists they go from city to city to
[11:51] stir people's faith up and some pastors
[11:53] they stay in one place and shepherd the
[11:55] flock and some teachers they instruct
[11:58] you deeper than all the other gifts
[12:01] right for the perfecting of the saints
[12:02] for the work of the ministry for the
[12:04] edifying of the body of christ in other
[12:06] words if you want to be edified if you
[12:08] want to be strengthened listen to god's
[12:10] five different kinds of preaching
[12:12] and that will build you up praise god
[12:15] see that the but the enemies uh the
[12:17] enemies uh temptation days that give us
[12:19] so many different voices that that you
[12:21] know we have human interests and things
[12:23] that we don't hear the fivefold ministry
[12:25] as much as we should
[12:27] right that's that's always been the
[12:29] enemies uh just like with the serpent
[12:31] and eve he tried to get her off from the
[12:33] word of god right distract her with some
[12:35] new thought or
[12:36] some false revelation right the same
[12:38] thing today satan's trying to distract
[12:40] our minds from hearing the true word of
[12:42] god but we will overcome the enemy
[12:46] amen
[12:48] verse 13 so we listen to all these
[12:50] preaching till we all come in the unity
[12:51] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[12:53] son of god unto a perfect man unto the
[12:56] measure of the stature of the fullness
[12:58] of christ
[13:00] you will listen and as you listen you
[13:02] will grow and you will come in the full
[13:04] portion that god wants you to attain as
[13:07] a christian
[13:09] praise god we all got in our mind but
[13:11] boy what would my life be like if i was
[13:13] fully surrendered to god
[13:15] right but we should have a confidence
[13:17] not discouraged but confident that god
[13:20] will bring us to that point praise god
[13:22] god will bring us to the the spot where
[13:25] we will manifest christ in the fullest
[13:27] uh capacity that he has for us how many
[13:30] want more of god
[13:31] how many want to manifest more of christ
[13:33] amen the bible says if you hear the
[13:35] fivefold ministry god will bring you to
[13:37] that full completion that full portion
[13:39] you desire to manifest to this dying
[13:42] world amen
[13:43] that's the confidence i have too so if
[13:46] you're still here god's not done with
[13:47] you praise god open up your heart to god
[13:49] let god flow through you more amen trust
[13:51] in the word of god hear the word of god
[13:53] let the word of god dwell on you richly
[13:55] with all knowledge and wisdom and you
[13:57] will come to that measure of christ that
[14:00] he desires for you
[14:02] amen praise god
[14:04] uh now i want to um
[14:08] look at that now here why is it so
[14:10] important because in verse 14 if you
[14:11] don't listen to the real preachers
[14:14] you will be tossed back and forth
[14:16] by winds of doctrine you will be blown
[14:19] all over the spectrum sometimes for some
[14:21] years you'll believe this and then then
[14:23] you'll get blown by another false
[14:24] doctrine to the other side over there
[14:27] right
[14:28] like the the popular one today is the
[14:30] prosperity gospel right well if i give
[14:32] uh all my money to this rich preacher
[14:34] i'm going to get rich too
[14:36] you get blown and there's a lot of
[14:38] people that believe that right that's
[14:39] why their churches are so big because
[14:40] they're really not after christ they're
[14:42] after the blessings of christ
[14:44] but we're concerned with knowing the
[14:46] person of christ amen
[14:48] god's going to give me the blessings if
[14:49] i just fall in love with him amen
[14:52] in fact the blessings are running after
[14:53] us amen praise god
[14:55] but see they flock just the blessings
[14:57] but we flock to the face of christ where
[15:00] we receive his will whether it's easy or
[15:02] not
[15:04] and then the blessings of god flow out
[15:06] of our sufferings but then we get
[15:08] blessed you know where we times of rest
[15:09] where we don't have to suffer so much we
[15:11] get the full course amen
[15:14] but most people just want blessing
[15:15] blessing blessing but i understand if
[15:18] i'm to be like christ i must suffer like
[15:20] christ amen
[15:21] i want to know him in the power of his
[15:24] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[15:25] sufferings amen
[15:28] paul said that's why i'm in prison so i
[15:30] can partake of christ's sufferings amen
[15:34] amen
[15:35] so when we when we go through tough
[15:37] times don't be discouraged when you when
[15:39] you when you suffer or you're you're
[15:41] rejected or you're uh you're ignored
[15:44] don't
[15:45] uh don't don't be discouraged just know
[15:47] that this is my portion that i must
[15:49] suffer in order to be like jesus amen
[15:52] he suffered he was uh people talked
[15:55] behind his back people defamed jesus
[15:57] they mocked him they slapped him that's
[15:59] what our text was you'll see they
[16:01] slapped him in a little bit after he
[16:03] talks about it you know you know my
[16:04] doctrine they slap him
[16:06] they're mistreated we're all going to be
[16:08] mistreated for being christians and
[16:10] that's the portion of suffering that we
[16:12] must endure
[16:14] right but the bible says if you suffer
[16:15] with him you'll also reign with him
[16:18] hallelujah that's what we're interested
[16:20] in amen we're not living we're not
[16:22] trying to reign here over the physical
[16:25] kingdoms or the natural cities or the
[16:27] natural churches we're not trying to
[16:29] reign over that we're trying to reign
[16:30] over sin flesh the devil and temptation
[16:34] praise god we're trying to reign
[16:35] spiritually so that later in the
[16:37] millennium then we'll reign naturally as
[16:39] well amen
[16:41] praise god
[16:42] but look at verse 14
[16:45] that we be henceforth no more
[16:48] children tossed
[16:50] i want to finish that tossed to and fro
[16:53] and carried about with every wind of
[16:55] doctrine
[16:57] and i'm looking up here uh okay got it
[17:00] all right
[17:01] see what so what what uh what's the
[17:04] problem with not listing the right
[17:06] preachers you don't know your doctrine
[17:08] you don't know how god's instructing you
[17:10] on how to live
[17:12] you go from one extreme to the next
[17:15] right there's a sweet person i'm not
[17:16] gonna name their name they're in my
[17:18] family they they they don't they don't
[17:21] follow the message that kind of narrows
[17:22] it down
[17:23] but
[17:24] they think every and they and i've seen
[17:27] them go from this side so with divine
[17:29] healing is what i want to share
[17:30] with divine healing it used to be uh
[17:33] god's going to heal everything i've seen
[17:34] this person and every time they pray
[17:36] they told the person god wants to heal
[17:38] god wants you you're going to be healed
[17:40] but now i see the person swinging to the
[17:42] other side and they're like if you're
[17:43] sick you're cursed and they try to just
[17:46] uh rebuke the person like they're cursed
[17:49] and both sides are wrong
[17:51] just because you're sick doesn't mean
[17:52] you're cursed
[17:54] how can i be cursed if god has blessed
[17:56] me amen
[17:58] but then how can god heal you every time
[18:01] if if uh
[18:02] how can god want to heal every time if
[18:05] if one day if god terrorists we're all
[18:06] going to die where's the healing then
[18:11] see like there's got to be a balance on
[18:13] all of our statements for example you've
[18:15] heard the statement the right positive
[18:17] mental attitude will bring every promise
[18:18] to pass but if you don't understand that
[18:21] well then you would think well this
[18:22] person died well i'm going to have the
[18:24] right mental attitude and they're going
[18:25] to come back to life well how many times
[18:26] has that happened
[18:27] very rare
[18:29] so you see what what that quote means is
[18:31] that when once god reveals that the
[18:34] promise is for you amen
[18:36] glory once you know it's god's will for
[18:38] this person to rise from the dead or for
[18:41] this miracle to happen then you've got
[18:43] to have the right mental attitude
[18:44] towards the revelation amen
[18:48] let me let me just go back to this one i
[18:49] used one a lot but i had two friends in
[18:51] the message and they really believed
[18:52] they were claiming they're going to
[18:53] marry this person
[18:55] both both a man and a woman just
[18:56] different people they don't go to church
[18:58] here
[18:59] but i just use this because it's very
[19:00] they were claiming in the name of jesus
[19:02] they're going to marry this person
[19:04] and they did it they ended up marrying
[19:06] they both married two other people
[19:08] but they could have said this well the
[19:10] right mental attitude is going to bring
[19:11] this promise to pass but that person god
[19:14] never ordained for them to marry so
[19:16] they're trying to claim a promise that
[19:18] wasn't theirs
[19:19] are you with me church
[19:21] see how we have to be so careful and
[19:23] preachers will just say that well the
[19:25] right mental attitude and we could be
[19:26] discouraged if it doesn't happen well
[19:29] first you got to go back and be taught
[19:31] again that first confess your sins and
[19:33] then second find the revelation is it
[19:36] god's will to do this
[19:40] is that helpful that's some real good
[19:42] meat you can chew on today
[19:45] might have we might have a good meal
[19:46] afterwards but i'll tell you this the
[19:48] real meat right here
[19:50] see because people say that well the
[19:51] right mental attitude just think
[19:52] different well what if you think
[19:54] different but then god shows you well
[19:56] that promise wasn't exactly to you
[19:58] and we sing that song every promise in
[20:00] the book is mine we got to update that
[20:01] song
[20:03] every promise revealed to me is mine now
[20:06] there you go now there's a good one
[20:07] right there
[20:09] because it's got to be revealed to you
[20:11] not all speak with tongues so what if i
[20:13] said well brother i just got to have the
[20:14] right mental attitude and you and i can
[20:16] speak in tongues but what if god has not
[20:17] ordained us to speak in tongues it'll
[20:19] never come to pass amen man
[20:22] hallelujah
[20:23] see we gotta can i say it like this we
[20:25] gotta go we gotta grow past babyhood and
[20:28] into manhood
[20:31] we gotta go past the teenager into the
[20:32] adults amen
[20:34] did everybody understand
[20:38] but see these are things the holy spirit
[20:39] reveals
[20:41] as we meditate upon them
[20:43] as you meditate upon the word of god
[20:46] jesus reveals these things now what does
[20:48] that mean now what is all this for it's
[20:49] for this
[20:51] that you and i have a closer intimacy
[20:53] with christ
[20:54] and that we pray lord let your will be
[20:56] done not my will we don't assume we just
[20:59] don't assume and think we know god's
[21:01] will in every situation we don't we have
[21:04] to constantly seek the face of god which
[21:06] makes us closer to god we're more
[21:08] intimate with him and we look for his
[21:10] will in every situation every situation
[21:12] not thinking we already know it
[21:15] which what makes us more humble
[21:18] instead of being prideful like i know
[21:20] everything i know what god wants to do
[21:21] in every situation you probably don't
[21:23] but ram said usually it's the opposite
[21:25] god wants to do the opposite of what we
[21:26] want to do
[21:28] right
[21:30] see we got to grow up and get out of the
[21:32] childhood
[21:33] being tossed back and forth like this
[21:34] dear family member oh everybody's going
[21:36] to be healed and then they saw they they
[21:38] weren't healed and then now everybody's
[21:40] cursed who's sick that's not always the
[21:41] case
[21:43] god paul told timothy just have a little
[21:45] wine for your stomach's sake he never
[21:46] said because you're cursed
[21:48] he never said that
[21:50] god was allowing a sickness for a
[21:52] purpose
[21:53] like with paul's eyes maybe it's for
[21:54] humility
[21:56] right maybe it's for some other reason
[21:59] but you don't know unless you ask
[22:02] and the bible said you have not because
[22:05] you ask not
[22:06] see we don't pray enough about certain
[22:08] things we just assume well the right
[22:10] mental attitude will bring it to pass
[22:12] well that's only if it's revealed to you
[22:15] right
[22:17] so hopefully that's helpful by the grace
[22:18] of god
[22:21] now let's finish verse
[22:23] 14.
[22:25] now go to the middle where it says every
[22:26] wind of doctrine
[22:28] and while you're going there i'm going
[22:29] to
[22:30] skip it down to 88 forgive me because
[22:32] here's the one i was looking to find no
[22:33] wonder i couldn't find it was already at
[22:34] the end
[22:38] so yeah verse
[22:40] 14 by the slight of men encountering
[22:42] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[22:44] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[22:46] may grow up into him in all things which
[22:49] is the head even christ now if you want
[22:51] to look up here
[22:54] mature christians we speak the truth and
[22:56] love so we're not hateful we're not
[22:58] envious we're not jealous
[23:00] and also as mature christians we find
[23:03] where god has joy fitly joined us in our
[23:06] position in the body of christ
[23:12] amen
[23:13] how ridiculous would it be if i said
[23:15] well you know i just i think i'm going
[23:16] to try i'm going to play the guitar i'm
[23:18] going to lead song service today
[23:22] do you think i'd find my position
[23:25] what do you thought what do you all
[23:26] think
[23:27] you have to find well that's as
[23:29] ridiculous as someone getting up here to
[23:31] preach who's not called to preach
[23:32] amen amen praise god amen
[23:37] i mean each one has a position where you
[23:40] fit in perfectly amen
[23:42] each one of you brothers and sisters
[23:44] especially brothers and sisters all of
[23:46] us
[23:47] because not all the anointings here all
[23:49] the anointings with you too praise god
[23:51] we're all anointed of the holy spirit
[23:55] we can't be babies we've got to grow up
[23:57] in the manhood
[23:59] adulthood or womanhood
[24:00] for our sisters you got to grow up in
[24:02] the womanhood
[24:05] and you got to speak the truth and find
[24:07] where god has called you
[24:13] now jesus said few there be that find
[24:15] the narrow road so that means few are
[24:17] going to obey the five full ministry
[24:19] that means very few people will be
[24:21] mature christians and i see it more and
[24:22] more all the time
[24:24] more and more all the time
[24:26] and the way you know they're immature is
[24:28] because they don't deal with sin
[24:32] they let sin foster in their lives they
[24:34] just put they give sin a pass and say
[24:36] okay it's okay we'll just we'll just
[24:38] move on that's one way you know for sure
[24:41] someone's immature
[24:43] because jesus would constantly rebuke
[24:45] his disciples for their sins amen
[24:48] right he didn't let it hang around right
[24:50] he dealt with it
[24:52] so the more mature you the more mature
[24:55] you get the more you'll deal with with
[24:57] sin out of your camp and few people so
[24:59] this means most people
[25:01] that don't obey the fivefold ministry
[25:03] will be immature
[25:05] right they'll also be tossed like waves
[25:08] agitated just everything agitates them
[25:10] they're always fearful they're always
[25:11] there's oh there's always an emergency
[25:13] we talked about that one time remember
[25:14] brother different people we've seen
[25:16] everything's an emergence everything's
[25:17] got to be now where's the peace of god
[25:19] amen hallelujah
[25:22] where's the peace of god that passes all
[25:24] understanding amen that's what we should
[25:26] have praise god
[25:29] if you're in the midst of a trial just
[25:31] pray stop praying make your requests on
[25:33] unto god and watch god's peace come upon
[25:35] you amen
[25:39] if it don't come to you right away it'll
[25:41] pretty soon come upon somebody you love
[25:42] who's right around you amen and they'll
[25:44] help calm you down
[25:46] because we're our body and the help
[25:48] flows through the body praise god
[25:53] also those who reject the fivefold
[25:55] ministry of the teaching will be carried
[25:57] about which means driven by doubts
[25:59] hesitations they'll go from this opinion
[26:01] to that opinion they'll doubt whether
[26:02] this are these things true now we all
[26:05] have doubts right we all battle satan
[26:06] but i'm saying they live
[26:09] they live in this condition
[26:12] they're constantly tossed from that idea
[26:14] to that doctrine to back forth
[26:16] and they don't have the stability that a
[26:18] christian should have
[26:20] they're carried by doubts
[26:22] instead of the word of god
[26:25] and they are deceived
[26:28] because the bible said they're lying in
[26:29] wait to deceive they're false the false
[26:31] preachers are lying in wait to deceive
[26:36] okay so how many want to find the narrow
[26:38] road today
[26:40] how many believe you're walking on the
[26:41] narrow road
[26:42] amen
[26:44] that means you're mature
[26:46] you are coming into a unity with christ
[26:49] and the bride
[26:52] you're coming into a oneness of
[26:54] knowledge of the son of god you're
[26:55] coming into a complete man or woman
[26:59] you are growing into the measure of the
[27:01] fullness of christ for your life
[27:07] that's what the fivefold ministry is
[27:08] supposed to do
[27:10] and that's what jesus sent so you would
[27:12] do it hey
[27:13] hallelujah praise god
[27:15] all right
[27:16] now i'm going to exit i just want to
[27:17] make sure i i didn't preach that last
[27:19] week and i want to get that out to you
[27:20] was that helpful by god's grace
[27:24] so in other words there again those this
[27:26] is what our preaching and all the
[27:27] preachers this is what they're supposed
[27:29] to do they're supposed to perfect you
[27:30] which means equip you to give you the
[27:32] tools you need they're helping they help
[27:34] you do the work of your ministry so the
[27:37] preaching will help you find your
[27:38] ministry and undertake it
[27:41] the third thing it'll edify you to
[27:43] promote your growth you'll see yourself
[27:44] growing because oh when the brother came
[27:46] or when this was preached by the pastor
[27:48] it helped me grow as a christian
[27:51] right oh we all you need the faith we
[27:53] all agree we believe on what's the truth
[27:55] of god
[27:57] yeah we'll have little differences we
[27:58] might see things different but the word
[28:00] of god will bring us to a unity on the
[28:02] major doctrines for sure
[28:05] and we all come in the unity of the
[28:06] knowledge of the son of god or precise
[28:08] truth
[28:09] that you need
[28:10] to
[28:11] god god
[28:13] all right
[28:14] now that's just a little i just wanted
[28:15] to briefly
[28:17] preach that okay
[28:18] now you don't have to have your bibles
[28:19] out for this one but um
[28:22] i just want to go through some remainder
[28:23] here of these verses now these are all
[28:26] about jesus
[28:27] and his teaching
[28:30] and i said on wednesday night you know
[28:31] brother austin and lena were here and
[28:32] sister naomi and the family
[28:34] but we were showing
[28:37] i think it's surprising church if we
[28:39] realize jesus spent a lot of time
[28:41] teaching
[28:43] he would do miracles he would heal he
[28:45] would do all that but from the bible it
[28:47] looks like he spent the most of his time
[28:49] teaching
[28:53] constantly the bible said he was daily
[28:55] teaching with them in the temple so if
[28:58] if you were alive at that time i want to
[29:00] see god's messiah i want to see miracles
[29:01] well you might come into his meeting he
[29:03] might not be doing the miracle of
[29:05] healing he might be doing the miracle of
[29:06] teaching
[29:08] you might just sit and listen for a
[29:09] while and that's how a lot of people
[29:11] were they would just go for the miracles
[29:14] there was one group church listen i said
[29:15] this is there's one group they only went
[29:17] for jesus to uh
[29:19] multiply the bread and get food from
[29:21] jesus
[29:22] that's all they went for
[29:25] and then jesus rebuked him for that
[29:26] they only came to see america oh my
[29:29] we all want to see miracles but we ought
[29:31] to take miracles and correction and let
[29:34] jesus teach us how to live like him amen
[29:38] we got to take all of jesus amen i don't
[29:39] want just a part of jesus i want all of
[29:42] jesus amen
[29:45] same way
[29:46] we have to be today
[29:48] we have to take all of jesus the
[29:49] teaching and the preaching and the
[29:52] miracles amen
[29:55] i think we i think we're a surprise
[29:56] church aren't we we're surprised when we
[29:58] see
[29:59] jesus doing all this teaching
[30:01] it surprised me
[30:03] luke 13 22 and he went through the
[30:06] cities and villages teaching
[30:09] and journeying toward jerusalem
[30:11] then said one in him lord are there a
[30:12] few that be saved
[30:15] and he said unto them what did jesus say
[30:17] strive
[30:19] now this means to contend like you're
[30:21] running a race or fighting a fight
[30:24] i haven't seen too many of you fight
[30:25] other than maokai and i fight at
[30:27] taekwondo sometimes but
[30:30] i've seen maokai fight
[30:32] he's a pretty good fighter
[30:34] but that's what the body that's what
[30:35] jesus said fight to enter in at the
[30:38] straight gate in other words you're
[30:39] gonna have to fight the devil
[30:41] are there a few that be saved yes jesus
[30:44] says and if you want to be saved you've
[30:46] got to fight off those doubts amen fight
[30:48] off the opinions of man
[30:50] fight off all the deceiving of satan and
[30:53] lay a hold and battle until you lay a
[30:56] hold on the truth of god's word
[30:58] amen
[31:00] fight satan
[31:01] stay on the path right and fight satan
[31:03] off the path amen
[31:05] the devil's trying to get you off the
[31:06] path but you got to fight to stay on the
[31:08] truth i'm going to continue walking in
[31:10] truth praise god
[31:14] imagine if jesus visited your town what
[31:16] if he came right down to your street
[31:18] what would he be doing he'd be sitting
[31:19] there on the corner
[31:21] he'd be teaching everybody we'd stand
[31:22] around he'd be teaching them about the
[31:24] kingdom of god the kingdom of heaven is
[31:25] likened to a man
[31:27] who cast his net to the sea
[31:29] i came to see miracles jesus he said
[31:32] there's a time for miracles there's also
[31:33] a time to teach
[31:36] praise god
[31:37] he passed through and teach
[31:40] in their cities and their villages
[31:43] see how important teaching is
[31:47] now look at this i say to you
[31:49] many will seek to enter in and shall not
[31:51] be able isn't that amazing
[31:55] many will try to enter the straight and
[31:57] narrow the narrow road but not be able
[31:59] to enter in why because they don't
[32:01] receive the teaching of the word
[32:04] and he was on the way to the cross
[32:08] think about that many people are going
[32:09] to say let me in let me i want to walk
[32:10] the narrow way and he said they'll not
[32:12] be able to right reminds us of what the
[32:15] foolish virgin
[32:17] they go they come too late
[32:19] they should have prepared the oil
[32:20] beforehand
[32:21] right reminds us of that
[32:24] they're going to try but it's not the
[32:25] right time they should have done it
[32:27] earlier oh let's redeem the time church
[32:29] amen you are redeeming the time amen
[32:31] let's make the most of this morning
[32:33] praise god
[32:34] give god all your attention give god all
[32:36] your your love amen
[32:38] give god all your heart all your
[32:40] obedience amen all your efforts strive
[32:42] to walk the narrow road
[32:45] strive he said if you want to because a
[32:47] lot of people are going to try
[32:48] but they're not willing to strive
[32:51] they're not willing to fight for
[32:52] obedience
[32:54] see they get into the bad habits or they
[32:56] get into a foolish state like the
[32:57] foolish virgin
[32:59] right where they they no longer seek
[33:01] after the holy ghost they no longer seek
[33:02] after the face of god
[33:08] this is what we see in the scripture
[33:11] luke 19
[33:12] and he taught daily every day
[33:16] well let's go down it's friday let's go
[33:18] down and see what jesus is doing he's
[33:19] teaching today huh he was teaching
[33:20] yesterday and my dad said he was
[33:22] teaching on wednesday too and my mom
[33:24] said he was teaching on tuesday and
[33:25] monday too
[33:27] he was always teaching
[33:30] but the chief priests and scribes of the
[33:32] chief of the people sought to destroy
[33:34] him and could not find what they might
[33:36] do for all the people were very
[33:39] attentive to hear him
[33:40] now look at this church
[33:42] the elect you and i must be attentive to
[33:45] the holy ghost teaching us today
[33:48] and every day
[33:52] were very attentive
[33:54] that's why we don't
[33:56] uh get on our cell phones in the church
[33:58] i've been to churches we've been to
[33:59] churches with william
[34:00] they say oh get out your cell phone
[34:02] get a text and then the people and i've
[34:04] seen it they're no longer reading
[34:06] the bible now they're just texting
[34:07] friends they're just on their social
[34:09] media we saw that at the catholic church
[34:11] i saw this lady she had this whole scarf
[34:13] on and she was just on social media i'm
[34:14] like what this is
[34:16] this is
[34:17] supposed to be the house of
[34:18] god you need to be very attentive praise
[34:21] god that's why we don't say who wants a
[34:23] coffee in here now i might take one but
[34:26] that'd be wrong i'll take one after
[34:28] church right
[34:30] or let's pass around the pizza who like
[34:31] a piece of pizza while we're preaching
[34:32] the word of god
[34:34] ridiculous
[34:36] god deserves your full attention amen
[34:38] like austin he's got this nice wonderful
[34:40] job thank god for that amen but they
[34:41] don't let him do his phone on the job
[34:43] why because the job's important
[34:45] it's a hazard to have your phone on oh
[34:47] god
[34:47] it's a hazard to have your phone on in
[34:49] the house of god you might miss the holy
[34:51] spirit praise god
[34:53] amen
[34:56] it's a hazard to laugh and joke
[34:58] in the church because you might miss the
[35:00] holy spirit i'm talking about like the
[35:01] preaching of the word you know
[35:03] like hey did you hear that joke last
[35:04] night you see the browns game last night
[35:06] no they didn't play last night i'm just
[35:07] using that as an example
[35:09] just silliness
[35:11] but jesus when he went a place he
[35:13] demanded their attention praise god and
[35:16] he said they were not a little attentive
[35:18] they were very attentive that's what i
[35:19] like when all you're looking at me
[35:20] because i know the holy spirit's got
[35:22] your attention
[35:23] hallelujah
[35:26] see this is what if jesus was here
[35:28] that's how we'd be acting we'd have to
[35:30] give jesus all of our attention
[35:32] he said heaven shall pass away but my
[35:34] word shall not pass away
[35:36] take heed to yourselves listen any time
[35:37] your hearts be overcharged with
[35:39] surfeiting
[35:41] that means a hangover
[35:43] and drunkenness and cares this life and
[35:45] so that day come upon you unawares so
[35:48] jesus says overeating over drinking is
[35:50] going to be a battle in this day
[35:53] that's why we gotta fast right that's we
[35:54] gotta eat less you can't fast at least
[35:56] eat less
[35:58] right
[35:59] so you don't get caught up in the cares
[36:01] of this life
[36:02] for as a snare see it's a trap all this
[36:05] food all this fun it's a trap it's a
[36:08] snare it'll come on all them that dwell
[36:10] on the face of the earth
[36:14] watch ye therefore and pray always so
[36:16] while your friends and family are eating
[36:18] and feasting and probably gaining too
[36:20] much weight right
[36:22] you and i should just eat a little right
[36:24] and then we should pray and we should
[36:25] watch because the bible said then we'll
[36:27] be worthy to escape all things that
[36:30] shall come to pass and stand before the
[36:32] son of man
[36:33] hallelujah
[36:37] see the world overeat over drink we
[36:39] should be in the word in the word in the
[36:41] word
[36:42] hallelujah
[36:43] and in the in the day time he was doing
[36:46] what teaching in the temple
[36:49] and at night he went out and abode in
[36:50] the mount that is called the mount
[36:52] valves i'll show you a picture of it a
[36:53] little bit mount valves was just uh
[36:55] directly east of mount moriah where the
[36:57] temple was remember we looked at mariah
[36:59] and zion where we looked at that a few
[37:00] months ago
[37:02] there was a valley a kidron valley right
[37:04] right by uh mount moriah where abraham
[37:07] sacrificed isaac and everything or was
[37:08] going to
[37:09] but then that next mountain come up was
[37:11] called the mount of olives
[37:13] and so jesus would spend that time
[37:15] teaching and he'd take maybe a 10-minute
[37:16] walk and he'd walk up the hill and then
[37:18] he'd go sleep up there in the mount
[37:19] mount olives
[37:24] verse 38 and all the people came what'd
[37:27] they do
[37:28] early they got up early
[37:31] in the morning to him in the temple for
[37:33] to hear him
[37:35] they couldn't get enough of his word oh
[37:37] that should be you and i church that
[37:39] should be our testimony
[37:41] what'd you do last night dad well i was
[37:43] down there this isn't that young rabbi
[37:44] he taught all the day in the temple
[37:47] and i went home i got right to bed so i
[37:50] could get up early i go hear him teach
[37:52] again tomorrow this morning praise god
[37:56] i just can't get enough of this the lord
[37:57] jesus
[37:59] the son of man they called him praise
[38:01] god
[38:04] see they were so in tune with the holy
[38:06] spirit they would take his teaching in
[38:07] the temple they'd taken him out olives
[38:09] he was constantly telling the people
[38:12] this is how you keep the commands of god
[38:13] this is how you love the lord your god
[38:15] with all your heart all your soul all
[38:17] your mind all your strength
[38:22] then said pilate to the chief priest and
[38:23] the people i find no fault okay this is
[38:25] when he's been
[38:26] uh
[38:27] this is when he's been arrested and they
[38:29] were the more fear saying he stirth up
[38:31] the people teaching throughout all jewry
[38:34] beginning from galilee to this place so
[38:36] notice the wicked religious ones hated
[38:38] jesus's teaching
[38:41] and so will they hate our teaching if
[38:42] we're preaching what jesus preached
[38:45] i'm sorry if we're teaching what jesus
[38:46] taught and preached what he taught so
[38:48] will the world hate us
[38:50] did you see this two weeks ago in canada
[38:51] did you see this
[38:52] canada outlawed
[38:55] any speech against homosexuality
[38:57] transgenderism
[38:59] so christianity has been officially
[39:00] outlawed in canada
[39:02] and you know what those brothers do i've
[39:04] seen them i haven't talked to them but
[39:05] i've seen it they just don't preach on
[39:07] it or if they're going to get arrested
[39:09] so they wait till they get in the you
[39:11] know quietness after the livestream's
[39:12] over then they can talk and explain it
[39:16] in church guess what that might maybe
[39:17] come into our our nation too that was
[39:19] just two weeks ago
[39:21] look it up you can look it up it's all
[39:22] it was all over the news this last week
[39:25] it was so silent we didn't even hear we
[39:26] didn't even hear about the death of
[39:28] christianity or the outlaw of
[39:29] christianity in canada
[39:31] but it happened
[39:33] remember what's going to happen the
[39:35] united states government and the
[39:36] churches are going to unite to condemn
[39:37] what we believe
[39:40] they're not going to condemn our
[39:41] miracles they're going to condemn our
[39:43] doctrine
[39:45] right because doctrine is instruction
[39:46] this is how you should live it should be
[39:48] a man and a woman getting married not a
[39:50] man and a man
[39:51] that's in that's doctrine
[39:54] what are they going to try to do they're
[39:55] going to try to silence us but brother
[39:57] man said even if they try to silence us
[39:58] they may shut us down here but we'll
[40:00] keep having a ministry amen we'll find a
[40:02] way to preach to god's people amen we
[40:04] might have to drive to one another's
[40:05] house i'm not sure how it's going to
[40:06] happen at the end if we live to see it
[40:08] but they may silence the bride as far as
[40:11] publicly but she'll keep moving on
[40:13] praise god so keep learning from god
[40:14] she'll learn what to say in that hour
[40:17] she'll be made ready for the coming of
[40:19] her bridegroom
[40:22] what stirred them up his doctrine
[40:25] why's he got to teach him because he's
[40:26] teaching against us he's calling out our
[40:28] sins see that's why we got to call these
[40:30] people sins out
[40:32] pretty soon i'm going to teach an
[40:33] updated one about the false prophets
[40:35] because the bible said they had
[40:36] doctrines of devils i'm gonna show you
[40:37] some of their doctrines of devils
[40:39] there's two examples i shared with
[40:41] austin alina a couple weeks ago one of
[40:42] them is uh priests can't marry women
[40:45] that's called celibacy that's a doctrine
[40:47] of hell the bible says
[40:49] that's a doctrine of a devil preachers
[40:52] can't be married
[40:54] also the other one is uh
[40:56] you can't eat meat which they do all
[40:58] throughout you know the spring and
[40:59] everything like that
[41:01] that's a doctrine of the devil can you
[41:02] imagine that it's a devil trying to get
[41:04] people not to eat meat a devil
[41:06] that's okay if you're a vegetarian by
[41:07] choice but if it's if you're taking the
[41:09] man-made law and saying oh if you eat
[41:11] meat you're going to hell well now you
[41:12] just received a doctrine of the devil
[41:15] and there's many more like marrying
[41:16] people two or three times homosexuality
[41:19] right we talked about these
[41:23] so hopefully everybody can catch that by
[41:25] god's grace in john 3
[41:28] nicodemus came to jesus by night and
[41:29] said rabbi we know without a teacher
[41:32] come from god
[41:33] for no man can do these miracles that
[41:35] thou do us except god be with him so see
[41:37] the teaching and the miracles were
[41:39] inseparable
[41:41] nobody taught like jesus and nobody
[41:43] healed like jesus amen
[41:45] that's how we should have great teaching
[41:47] and we should have great miracles too
[41:49] praise god
[41:50] amen
[41:52] they're inseparable
[41:54] but our lives have to be lined up with
[41:56] the will of god we have to do the will
[41:57] of god in order to see the miracle we
[41:59] have to obey the doctrine in order to
[42:01] see the miracle of god
[42:03] because we're not babies anymore
[42:05] god's not gonna just you know do
[42:06] everything just to show us his love we
[42:07] know god loves us and now he wants us to
[42:09] mature
[42:10] he wants to see us stand in obedience he
[42:13] wants to see us
[42:15] choose the way of the master choose the
[42:17] way of jesus amen
[42:23] see they're inseparable
[42:25] john 6 no man can come to me except the
[42:28] father which has set me draw him and
[42:30] i'll raise him up at the last day
[42:33] as it is written the prophets they shall
[42:35] be all taught of god every man therefore
[42:37] that hath heard and hath learned of the
[42:38] father cometh unto me all god's children
[42:41] are taught of his spirit now here's what
[42:44] i read last sunday but i want you to see
[42:45] it i want you to see that brother braham
[42:47] said all god's children being taught the
[42:49] word of god is the evidence of the holy
[42:51] ghost
[42:53] and yes when you first get the holy
[42:54] ghost you have to have an emotional or
[42:56] some type of experience because every
[42:57] time a baby's born you see life enter i
[42:59] mean you can see the life right that
[43:01] baby's alive something happened to that
[43:02] baby
[43:03] right that baby's alive
[43:05] same thing when someone gets the holy
[43:06] ghost you have to see it and hear it the
[43:08] bible says
[43:10] but let's look at these
[43:13] quotes here churchill
[43:16] to further bring out what we've just
[43:18] said and to also use a scripture that
[43:20] should be born in mind as we talk about
[43:22] who it is that's baptized with the holy
[43:24] ghost don't we talk about that all the
[43:25] time we dropped out brother amen we talk
[43:26] about that who is baptized with the holy
[43:27] ghost don't we
[43:29] sometimes i wonder right
[43:31] people around this message who does have
[43:32] the holy ghost right we talk about it
[43:34] all the time
[43:36] and that's scriptural in galatians 4
[43:38] paul wondered i said he said do i have
[43:40] to come and labor again
[43:42] it seems like some of you weren't born
[43:43] again
[43:46] it's it's we must talk about who is
[43:48] baptized with the holy ghost he said but
[43:50] see what jesus says in john 6 45 it is
[43:54] written the prophets all they shall be
[43:56] all taught of god
[43:58] in isaiah 54 13
[44:01] it's taken from this and all thy
[44:03] children shall be taught of the lord the
[44:06] all of god are the children of god
[44:08] thus it is the evidence of being a true
[44:10] child of god he whom the spirit has come
[44:12] upon in indwells is again set forth as
[44:15] one taught the word by the holy ghost
[44:21] now you can begin to see why tongues is
[44:22] not the evidence of being baptized with
[44:24] the holy ghost it doesn't say in any age
[44:26] he that hath the tongue let him say what
[44:28] the spirit's saying that put tongues
[44:30] interpretation thereof prophecy etc
[44:32] aside as the evidence the evidence is
[44:34] hearing what the spirit says the spirit
[44:36] is talking amen yes the spirit is
[44:38] teaching that's exactly what jesus said
[44:40] he would do when he came john 14 26 he
[44:44] will teach you all things teach me today
[44:46] lord amen and bring all things to
[44:48] remembrance whatsoever i've said unto
[44:49] you and that is just what happened that
[44:52] is how the gospels were written praise
[44:53] god
[44:54] that's my prayer god when i don't have
[44:56] my bible in front of me remind me what
[44:58] you said amen
[45:00] tell me what to say praise god if i
[45:01] don't have my bible there i can't get
[45:03] out my phone lord i don't know what to
[45:05] say put the words in my mouth amen
[45:08] help me to be able to learn what to say
[45:10] to bring hope to people to bring healing
[45:12] to people to bring salvation to people
[45:14] praise god
[45:20] the men who wrote the bible he's talking
[45:21] about them they recalled in their minds
[45:23] by the holy ghost the very words that
[45:25] jesus spake that is why the gospels are
[45:27] accurate did you know that some of them
[45:28] wrote their gospels matthew mark luke
[45:30] and john some some of them wrote 20 or
[45:32] 30 years after christ left
[45:34] can you imagine
[45:36] go back 20 years i'm i'm 41.
[45:40] imagine if i go back to i'm 21 and try
[45:42] to remember what was it like when you
[45:44] went to play that football game at ohio
[45:45] state
[45:46] tell me all the details tell me exactly
[45:48] what your coach said to you i'd be like
[45:49] i have nothing i have nothing
[45:53] there's
[45:54] i can't remember anything about it
[45:55] but the holy ghost was so powerful on
[45:57] these men amen
[45:58] the holy ghost brought down they must
[46:00] have visions brother amen they must add
[46:02] visions they saw it again they heard the
[46:04] very words he said he said write this
[46:06] down the bible said the holy men of old
[46:08] were moved by the holy ghost amen god
[46:10] move us to speak the words of god to
[46:12] remember the words of jesus move upon us
[46:15] move through us help us be united
[46:17] vessels lord
[46:18] amen
[46:20] i can hardly remember what happened
[46:21] yesterday praise god or any conversation
[46:24] that happened you know last week
[46:26] but the holy ghost moves upon them and
[46:29] reminds them of what was spoken
[46:34] that's what happened a few i told
[46:35] brother this to brother austin a few
[46:36] months ago we had somebody try to come
[46:38] back to the church
[46:39] and we're out there talking the parking
[46:40] lot and i told this person i said you
[46:42] got to do three things in order to be
[46:43] invited back to church
[46:46] and i couldn't think of it i just kept
[46:47] waiting on the holy spirit
[46:49] i just kept talking
[46:51] yeah yeah
[46:52] i just kept waiting and all of a sudden
[46:54] i felt like heaven opened up and the
[46:56] three things came right down to me right
[46:58] at the very moment
[47:01] i said you got to have a job to come
[47:02] back i said you got to have an apartment
[47:04] to come back and you got to be
[47:06] supporting your children five children
[47:07] to come back
[47:10] and the very moment i said that that
[47:13] person said those very same words we
[47:15] said it in unison together
[47:17] see i'd forgotten about it but the holy
[47:18] spirit didn't forget about it amen i
[47:20] didn't hear you praise god and when i
[47:23] needed it the holy spirit brought it
[47:24] praise god
[47:27] and so that person hasn't met their uh
[47:29] hasn't met my requirements even though i
[47:31] invited them to come back anyway because
[47:32] they had two of them met but not one but
[47:34] they don't want to come back anyway
[47:35] that's fine
[47:36] but that's an example where i needed the
[47:38] word of god to remind me what i said
[47:42] so this person can keep the word of god
[47:45] and it came back at the very hour i need
[47:47] it man it happens all the time while i'm
[47:49] preaching too i can't remember a
[47:50] scripture all of a sudden there it is
[47:52] amen
[47:52] hallelujah
[47:54] he brings all things to remembrance
[47:57] he said that's how paul received the
[47:58] revelation paul said i did not receive
[48:01] the revelation of a man neither was i
[48:03] taught it but by the revelation of jesus
[48:04] christ he was taught by the holy ghost
[48:08] in every age we hear the same truth he
[48:10] that hath the ear
[48:14] to hear what the spirit say to the
[48:15] churches but only a spirit-filled man
[48:17] can hear the revelation of that age
[48:20] none other can no sir they cannot
[48:21] because exactly what paul said in 1st
[48:23] corinthians 2 6-16
[48:30] did you get that last thought
[48:32] i repeat every church age ends with the
[48:34] same admonition
[48:36] he that hath an ear
[48:38] let him an individual hear what the
[48:40] spirit say to the churches
[48:43] that's why brother amen i should be so
[48:44] discouraged how come people can't stay
[48:46] how come they can't hang around it's
[48:47] because i can't make them receive it
[48:50] i can preach it until i'm spitting or
[48:52] crying or shouting but i can they have
[48:54] to hear it themselves
[48:57] i'm just god's microphone right i'm just
[48:59] god's mic but it's god's voice they have
[49:01] to receive and they have to accept it
[49:03] and they have to they have to reject the
[49:05] voice of the devil right and then if
[49:07] they if they reject the voice of the
[49:08] devil they repent they receive god's
[49:10] word then they'll be with us praise god
[49:13] amen
[49:15] but only the elect will do it i'm so
[49:17] glad after all these years i'm god's
[49:19] elected amen i'm still standing i'm
[49:21] still hearing the voice of the spirit
[49:23] today praise god
[49:24] amen
[49:26] i can't force them to hear but i can
[49:28] decide i can decide to hear and i choose
[49:31] i hear it today holy spirit
[49:34] amen
[49:35] the bible said they went out from us
[49:37] because they were not a part of us
[49:40] because they weren't born again
[49:42] they're very proof you're still here is
[49:44] that you're born again praise god
[49:47] hallelujah
[49:49] see it's not based upon my feelings it's
[49:51] based upon the word amen
[49:54] that's the revelation of the word
[49:57] because my feelings betray me
[50:00] my feelings lie to me
[50:03] but the word of god will never lie it
[50:05] can never pass away praise god
[50:10] the spirit gives the word
[50:12] he has the truth for each age each age
[50:14] has its own elect and that elect group
[50:16] always heard from the word
[50:19] and received it proving they had the
[50:21] seed in them
[50:24] john 8 47 jesus said he that is of god
[50:27] heareth god's word you therefore hear
[50:30] them not because you're not of god amen
[50:33] every child of god will hear this
[50:35] message hallelujah
[50:37] they'll receive the water baptism in the
[50:39] name of the lord jesus christ amen now
[50:42] we see that god is one person and not
[50:44] three persons praise god
[50:46] they received that there was some type
[50:48] of fruit in the garden that was a
[50:50] natural fruit it was a it was an
[50:52] adultery fruit praise god they'll
[50:54] receive that because he that's of god
[50:56] hears god's word and they'll know after
[50:58] i get saved i've got to get sanctified
[51:00] and i need christ in me the hope of
[51:03] glory
[51:04] they'll receive that
[51:06] because that's what god's elect do they
[51:08] hear the word of god
[51:12] thank you jesus
[51:15] they refused the word jesus and his
[51:17] words for their days but the true seed
[51:19] received the word because they were of
[51:21] god
[51:24] i know it's lengthy on the quotes but
[51:26] these are special quotes that's why i'm
[51:27] preaching them two sundays in a row
[51:31] all thy children shall be taught of god
[51:34] the holy spirit
[51:35] jesus said the same thing in john 6 45
[51:38] being one with the word proves whether
[51:39] you are of god and spirit filled no
[51:42] other criterion
[51:43] but what are the tongues and
[51:44] interpretations the other gifts there
[51:46] are manifestations that's what the word
[51:47] teaches
[51:48] first corinthians 12 7 says but the
[51:50] manifestation of the spirit
[51:52] is given to every man to profit with all
[51:54] then paul names those manifestations
[51:58] now i ended last sunday with this
[52:00] the hellbound group could not learn
[52:02] from jesus to be taught to stop fearing
[52:07] in other words instead of faith they
[52:09] they took fear they couldn't learn how
[52:11] to have faith may god help us all to
[52:13] have faith
[52:14] they couldn't learn to just believe
[52:16] god's word they had to have unbelief
[52:18] they couldn't learn to stop doing
[52:20] abominable things
[52:22] they loved the abomination they couldn't
[52:23] learn it so they
[52:25] they basically sent themselves to hell
[52:28] they couldn't learn not to murder they
[52:29] couldn't learn how to forgive or have
[52:32] mercy they couldn't learn how to handle
[52:34] their sexual passions so god sent them
[52:36] to hell
[52:37] they couldn't learn to stop messing with
[52:39] sorcerers and demonic powers
[52:41] they couldn't learn to stop idolizing
[52:43] things
[52:43] they couldn't learn to stop lying like
[52:46] this
[52:48] but jesus said all those who hear my
[52:50] words are the children of god who can
[52:53] learn of me
[52:56] we should all confess that no matter how
[52:58] hard of the struggle we should all say
[53:00] i can still learn how to overcome this
[53:02] grief
[53:03] i can learn how to overcome this
[53:04] depression come on somebody yes
[53:07] i can learn to overcome this bad habit
[53:09] come on charge
[53:10] i can love
[53:12] you learner but because i've got a great
[53:14] teacher hallelujah amen
[53:16] a fool will not fail to learn this
[53:18] gospel amen hallelujah
[53:20] it's such an arrow and a fool won't air
[53:23] in this message
[53:27] hallelujah
[53:30] it's so plain
[53:32] i thought i'd add a few extra quotes
[53:33] because these are so awesome
[53:37] he said notice your absolute what's your
[53:38] absolute it's not brother branham it's
[53:40] the bible bible never said i'm the
[53:43] absolute above the bible he never said
[53:45] i'm the absolute equal to the bible he
[53:47] never said that he said i'm pointing you
[53:49] to the absolute
[53:53] he said oh i'm going to say something i
[53:54] just feel coming notice i feel very
[53:56] religious at this time
[53:58] because this is assurance notice your
[53:59] compass let me know what a compass is
[54:01] right you got them on your phone now you
[54:02] can get a compass on your phone
[54:05] your compass can only point to the north
[54:07] star that's the only place it can point
[54:09] if it's a true compass it'll strike the
[54:11] north star every time is that right
[54:13] then if you have the holy spirit it can
[54:15] only point to the word
[54:18] it'll never point to denomination it
[54:20] will never point to a creed it'll never
[54:22] point it away somewhere
[54:24] it'll point straight to the word
[54:29] brother jesse why do you believe this
[54:30] the word
[54:32] not because well my brother believes
[54:34] this amen
[54:35] or my my former pastor my first pastor
[54:37] brother brooks not because he says it i
[54:40] believe what the bible says praise god
[54:42] nothing wrong with that you know i said
[54:44] it could be anybody my mom
[54:46] i'm not going to tell you what my mom
[54:47] says i'm going to take what the bible
[54:49] says
[54:50] and you should say not even just because
[54:52] i said it it should be because the bible
[54:54] says it praise god amen
[54:56] i'm the voice you hear all the time but
[54:57] don't let me become common and don't let
[54:59] the bible become common either
[55:01] because i'm pointing you to the word you
[55:03] should say that's god's word that's not
[55:04] brother jesse's word that's god's word
[55:07] amen
[55:10] it'll never point you straight to the
[55:12] word i feel like shouting glory
[55:15] it's something inside of a man pulsating
[55:19] when you see your star setting out
[55:21] yonder jesus christ the word
[55:24] and you see the spirit that's in you
[55:26] won't let it move right or left that's
[55:28] the only one that can he come to take
[55:30] the things of god and show them to you
[55:32] manifest them jesus said see he'll do
[55:35] exactly the things that i say the holy
[55:37] spirit will reveal to you the things
[55:38] that's to come and show you ahead of
[55:40] time before it gets here
[55:42] i was praying yesterday i was praying
[55:44] lord i was fasting and praying a little
[55:45] bit i said lord show me please show me i
[55:48] hope you'll show me if the rapture is
[55:49] going to take place in my lifetime or
[55:50] not
[55:51] i'd like to know
[55:53] wouldn't you
[55:54] we've had a lot of people say it was
[55:56] going to happen their lifetime and they
[55:57] died
[55:58] i'd like to know praise god
[56:01] because i'm tired of all this guessing
[56:02] and all this this year is going to be
[56:04] the route i'm tired of that praise god
[56:06] so i'm just going to ask the lord i'll
[56:07] see what he says
[56:09] i'm waiting on the lord i don't know how
[56:10] to be manifested
[56:13] but i took time to ask the lord that you
[56:16] said you'd tell us things to come i said
[56:18] lord help me to understand the season of
[56:19] your coming
[56:21] so we're aware of it
[56:24] we see that he shows the things he takes
[56:26] the things that are god's and will show
[56:28] them to you
[56:29] i never asked to know the day of the
[56:30] hour
[56:31] i just said is it going to be my
[56:32] lifetime
[56:35] and he the holy spirit will reveal to
[56:37] you the things that jesus already said
[56:40] in other words he'll make plain the
[56:42] thing place that way over in a corner
[56:44] tonight because that's what we're going
[56:46] to use a little while making sure which
[56:48] positive sea then you know your north
[56:50] star which is the word to any christian
[56:56] you like that one is that you like that
[56:57] quote
[56:58] i love that one
[57:00] anything contrary to word look let me
[57:02] tell you something listen this closely
[57:03] this is the complete divine revelation
[57:05] of god his will and the coming of christ
[57:09] and everything lays right in this book
[57:11] completed brother and pat's on his bible
[57:13] and if anything draws you off of that
[57:15] throw that compass away because it's
[57:16] only a creed praise god
[57:18] it's a false impersonating compass i
[57:20] don't care if it's your mom or your dad
[57:22] or your brother or grandma or your
[57:24] famous preacher i don't care who it is
[57:26] this is the compass the word of god is
[57:28] the absolute praise god
[57:30] amen
[57:32] throw any man-made compass away just
[57:34] stick with god's compass
[57:36] i appreciate my brother i appreciate my
[57:38] sister i appreciate my family but i
[57:40] appreciate the lord most
[57:42] they have their ideas but i'm going to
[57:43] take the word of god
[57:50] see a creed is only a paper you're
[57:51] packing your in your pocket
[57:53] it's framed it's a creed find the
[57:55] compass that sets you to the word
[57:58] i'm going to skip that 7.
[58:01] and that's what christ is to you if you
[58:03] want to go to heaven i'm going to go to
[58:04] heaven
[58:06] if you want to be saved i'm going to be
[58:07] saved
[58:08] if you want to be filled with the holy
[58:09] spirit how do you want to be filled with
[58:10] the holy spirit
[58:11] if you want to be christ-like how do you
[58:12] want to be christian
[58:13] christ is your north star
[58:16] if you're lost don't try to take a creed
[58:17] he's your north star he's your way he's
[58:19] your direction then if you take him as
[58:20] your north star then that absolutely
[58:22] places the holy spirit your your compass
[58:25] the holy spirit is your compass and the
[58:26] compass will only point you to the north
[58:27] star and if you got the baptism of the
[58:29] holy ghost it can only point to you to
[58:31] christ and christ is the word that's the
[58:34] way to find your way back to god
[58:36] that's your way to find that narrow road
[58:38] hallelujah
[58:40] a straight road
[58:41] the word of god
[58:44] now i know all these false preachers
[58:46] they're like satan they're they're
[58:47] quoting the bible they're like they're
[58:49] quote it to jesus
[58:50] so also you've got to have the holy
[58:52] spirit discernment in your heart to know
[58:53] if that person's off the word or if that
[58:55] person's on the word
[58:57] like yesterday the jeffersonville church
[58:59] put out another article guess what they
[59:00] said they said that brother branham was
[59:03] the first to come to the full the
[59:05] fullness of adam again
[59:08] can you imagine that the bible says
[59:10] jesus is the there it is the last adam
[59:13] but they said brother brahma is the
[59:14] first to return to the full adam that's
[59:16] that's impossible
[59:18] the full the first adam had no sin
[59:21] brother graham sinned
[59:23] so right there it's so simple
[59:26] and they're basically exalting brother
[59:27] brahm equal to the first adam or equal
[59:30] to christ
[59:31] and it says and then they say that
[59:33] church says and then now you all have
[59:35] that same fullness of adam's status no
[59:37] we don't
[59:39] we don't we can't live a sinless life
[59:42] right
[59:45] and i'm going to write i'm going to
[59:46] write them my email today lord willing
[59:47] if i remember today or tomorrow i'm
[59:48] going to tell them you guys are off the
[59:49] word
[59:50] brother ramsay the last adam was christ
[59:54] it's impossible now can we speak to the
[59:56] mountain yes thank god we've seen it
[59:58] praise god but that doesn't make us
[1:00:01] fully like adam because adam had full
[1:00:03] control
[1:00:05] and he was kind he was always obeying
[1:00:06] the word of god he was con he just had
[1:00:09] that permanent anointing we don't have
[1:00:10] that praise god as far as everything we
[1:00:12] do is perfect all the time
[1:00:14] we have death inside of us the first
[1:00:16] adam didn't have death inside of him
[1:00:18] right he wasn't dying
[1:00:20] see it's so sly that devil's so so
[1:00:23] smooth
[1:00:24] it sounds so good but it's wrong
[1:00:28] it's making people think they're equal
[1:00:30] to adam you're not equal to adam as far
[1:00:33] as before he sinned you've sinned we've
[1:00:34] all sinned we've all fallen short of the
[1:00:36] glory of god amen
[1:00:38] now the blood can redeem us right and
[1:00:40] give us back the gifts that god has for
[1:00:42] us but we're all not going to be
[1:00:43] speakers and tongues we're all not going
[1:00:45] to be miracle workers like adam was
[1:00:48] adam could speak to this tree brother
[1:00:50] said he could move it now that's not in
[1:00:51] the bible
[1:00:52] but i don't know what things he
[1:00:53] controlled with nature but he obviously
[1:00:55] could control the garden and operate the
[1:00:57] garden
[1:00:58] right so we even got to take that back
[1:01:00] to the word
[1:01:02] see and we'll all have our gifts but
[1:01:04] we're not all going to be sinless on
[1:01:06] this side we're going to be sinless when
[1:01:08] we get the new body praise god a
[1:01:10] theophany amen and then a glorified body
[1:01:13] then we'll be sinless praise god then
[1:01:15] we'll be like adam praise god
[1:01:19] see it's so it sounds so good
[1:01:21] oh you're just like
[1:01:23] jesus has restored everything back the
[1:01:24] garden of eden brother amen just speak
[1:01:26] the word now
[1:01:28] right that's what that false preacher i
[1:01:30] showed you with his 24 false doctrines
[1:01:32] that's what he was saying to the to
[1:01:34] their to that church
[1:01:36] they were saying well you got the
[1:01:37] fullness of god in you and the angels
[1:01:38] are looking for you to operate the
[1:01:40] fullness of god well who wants to step
[1:01:41] up and be first to walk on water
[1:01:44] because you got the fullness of god
[1:01:45] who's going to be first
[1:01:46] and what everybody stood there like
[1:01:48] statues they didn't move
[1:01:50] because you can't you you can't do that
[1:01:52] it's ridiculous
[1:01:55] but see it's trying to put a spirit of
[1:01:56] bondage over the people a spirit of fear
[1:01:58] and in the same sermon he said tape
[1:02:00] churches and return ministry churches
[1:02:02] and fivefold are all the same that's
[1:02:04] heresy
[1:02:07] we're not the same as those heretical
[1:02:08] churches we stand for truth we have
[1:02:11] jesus doctrine amen the holy ghost
[1:02:13] brings us jesus words to our remembrance
[1:02:15] amen
[1:02:16] hallelujah
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:20] hallelujah oh i love this word amen
[1:02:24] some of y'all don't see it which is okay
[1:02:25] you don't have to see it but i see it
[1:02:26] all the time i hear this one i see that
[1:02:28] one i i check their website every week
[1:02:29] anyway because it's always filled with
[1:02:30] you know so i spilled something off the
[1:02:32] word
[1:02:33] i know it
[1:02:34] like it's automatic like they're just
[1:02:36] going to give me false doctrine every
[1:02:37] time i check their website every time
[1:02:39] it's automatic because they're not
[1:02:41] pointing us to the word they're pointing
[1:02:43] us to their own idea of a tape
[1:02:45] that's not what he said on the tape
[1:02:47] they're misinterpreting the tapes that
[1:02:48] they say are the absolute and infallible
[1:02:52] see that's what happens when your
[1:02:53] compass is broken
[1:02:54] they've got a man-made compass praise
[1:02:56] god
[1:02:57] and they're not using the compass of the
[1:02:59] holy spirit
[1:03:04] all right
[1:03:05] that's my weekly keeping our church
[1:03:07] clean from the
[1:03:08] uh
[1:03:10] tape church false doctrine teachings
[1:03:12] to the gifts of god new church the gift
[1:03:13] of god clean out the church
[1:03:17] all right sweep it up there all right
[1:03:18] dumb in the trash praise god
[1:03:21] we love the tapes we love brother
[1:03:22] brandon i listened to the tape this week
[1:03:24] while i was shoveling beautiful tape
[1:03:29] but they're they're going so far they're
[1:03:31] making the tapes infallible that's what
[1:03:33] they're there that's what their podcast
[1:03:34] said la i'm sorry their website said
[1:03:36] last week the tapes are infallible and
[1:03:38] they said the tapes are all powerful
[1:03:42] that's a lie
[1:03:43] brother ram said you find mix up on the
[1:03:44] tapes he said look in the bible
[1:03:47] but see they take a few quotes here
[1:03:49] there that make it
[1:03:50] you know that satan can see that he it
[1:03:51] makes it look like it that's the way but
[1:03:53] that's not what they're saying
[1:03:55] that's not what brother was saying
[1:03:57] the word of god is infallible the word
[1:03:59] of god is all-powerful
[1:04:02] see
[1:04:03] all right thank you thank you uh john 6
[1:04:05] 55 and the 57 and the living father has
[1:04:08] sent me and i live by the father who do
[1:04:09] you live by i live by jesus right so he
[1:04:12] that now look he that eateth me
[1:04:15] even he shall live by me look what he
[1:04:17] says
[1:04:18] and all these preachers by the austin
[1:04:19] can you imagine seventy preachers
[1:04:20] standing around brother austin jesus
[1:04:22] said if you eat of me you live of me
[1:04:25] this is that bread that came down from
[1:04:27] heaven not as your father should eat
[1:04:28] manna and are dead he that eateth this
[1:04:30] bread shall live forever and these
[1:04:32] things said he where in the synagogue
[1:04:34] with all the religious people around
[1:04:36] as he taught in capernaum
[1:04:39] you know he said it on purpose
[1:04:41] he said it to thin out the crowd
[1:04:45] and i hope we don't send out the crowd
[1:04:46] here
[1:04:46] [Laughter]
[1:04:50] but you know it's god's will god's will
[1:04:55] many therefore his disciples when they
[1:04:57] heard this they said this is hard
[1:04:59] preaching
[1:05:00] this is hard teaching who can understand
[1:05:02] this
[1:05:04] and he goes on to say they're just that
[1:05:06] my words are spirit you have to receive
[1:05:08] that my you have to receive my teachings
[1:05:11] that's life you have to eat me you have
[1:05:13] to receive my teachings
[1:05:16] when jesus knew in himself that his
[1:05:18] disciples murmured at it he said to them
[1:05:20] does this offend you
[1:05:23] what now he didn't say that in a nice
[1:05:24] way he said it in a rebuking way did
[1:05:26] this preach and hurt your feelings
[1:05:28] he said what if you see the son of man
[1:05:30] ascend up where he was before then would
[1:05:32] you believe it
[1:05:35] jesus wasn't always mr nice guy
[1:05:37] he'd rebuke the people especially these
[1:05:39] preachers he'd rebuke the preachers
[1:05:42] right because they're the ones
[1:05:43] influencing the people
[1:05:45] it is the spirit that quickens the flesh
[1:05:47] prophets nothing the words that i speak
[1:05:48] unto you they are spirit and they are
[1:05:51] life
[1:05:53] but there are some of you that believe
[1:05:55] not
[1:05:56] for jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:05:57] they were that believe not and who
[1:05:59] should betray him and he said therefore
[1:06:00] i said unto you that no man can come
[1:06:02] unto me except it were given of him and
[1:06:03] my father
[1:06:05] from that time brother look at this many
[1:06:07] of his disciples went back and walked
[1:06:09] with him no more when jesus started
[1:06:11] rebuking them about their false
[1:06:12] doctrines and talking about all these
[1:06:14] spiritual things
[1:06:15] that's when the people left and said i
[1:06:17] can't handle this they all left
[1:06:19] and then the bible said jesus went back
[1:06:22] so brother austin only had 12 people
[1:06:23] left in his church and then he said do
[1:06:24] you guys want to leave too
[1:06:27] it just reminds me of gideon doesn't it
[1:06:29] he had 22 000 then it went down to what
[1:06:31] uh thirteen thousand ten thousand or
[1:06:33] something like that they said that's too
[1:06:34] many the holy spirit said we just need
[1:06:36] three hundred
[1:06:38] he kept
[1:06:39] shaving it down there's too many here
[1:06:41] too much pride amen
[1:06:45] too much fraud you want to go too
[1:06:49] he wasn't some pushover
[1:06:52] he knew what he was doing
[1:06:56] then simon said lord to whom shall we go
[1:06:59] thou hast the words
[1:07:01] see peter knew it's the words
[1:07:03] it's the spirit behind the words amen i
[1:07:06] didn't know you
[1:07:08] and we believe and are sure thou art the
[1:07:10] christ the son of living god notice he
[1:07:12] never went into great detail he just
[1:07:13] said my words are spirit and life in
[1:07:15] other words you have to receive this
[1:07:16] spiritually
[1:07:19] he let all the carnal ones leave and
[1:07:21] that's what we got to do too right we
[1:07:22] can't beg people we can't force people
[1:07:24] to come back i know jesus word we're not
[1:07:27] it praise god amen
[1:07:30] because it lines up with the word of god
[1:07:35] oh i'm glad to be on the lord's side

[1:07:57] i'm stomping on the lord's side amen
[1:08:01] praise god let him go
[1:08:03] jesus said only the true elect can hear
[1:08:05] my teaching they'll receive it because
[1:08:07] they're children of god
[1:08:13] in john 7 he was at the feast of
[1:08:16] tabernacles
[1:08:17] what do you do he went to the temple and
[1:08:18] he taught the people
[1:08:21] they marveled how does this man know
[1:08:22] these things he never went to seminary
[1:08:25] he said my doctrine is not mine
[1:08:28] but his that sent me
[1:08:30] see he didn't claim i didn't get this
[1:08:32] for myself i got this from god
[1:08:35] right
[1:08:36] then he cried look as he taught now look
[1:08:38] see you can be a loud teacher
[1:08:41] if you're a teacher you don't have to be
[1:08:42] quiet all the time
[1:08:43] real genteel
[1:08:45] a real sweet and kind can i just teach
[1:08:48] you something real quick
[1:08:49] would that be okay everybody okay
[1:08:52] no jesus cried the bible said he lifted
[1:08:54] up a loud voice he said you both know me
[1:08:57] and you know whence i came from and i'm
[1:08:59] not coming myself but he that sent me is
[1:09:01] true whom you don't even know
[1:09:04] praise god that's some real teaching
[1:09:06] right there praise god
[1:09:08] i know where i come from you know upset
[1:09:11] from god but you don't know you haven't
[1:09:13] received it you keep blaspheming it and
[1:09:15] he was teaching them with a loud voice
[1:09:17] he wasn't ashamed he was bold praise god
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:21] that's our king amen that's our jesus
[1:09:23] amen
[1:09:24] he said but i know by the father
[1:09:26] for i am from the father and the father
[1:09:29] sent me
[1:09:31] so how they like that teaching did they
[1:09:33] like that a lot did they say amen
[1:09:35] did you get a standing ovation yeah
[1:09:37] thank you jesus
[1:09:38] no they said let's kill that guy
[1:09:41] he said i'm not a believer and they
[1:09:42] weren't
[1:09:43] they weren't believers
[1:09:46] see church
[1:09:47] some at some point if somebody don't
[1:09:48] hate you pretty soon something's wrong
[1:09:50] with your life
[1:09:52] especially me as a preacher i get told
[1:09:53] at least once a month if somebody hates
[1:09:55] me
[1:09:56] at least once a month on youtube
[1:10:00] if if our lives aren't rubbing the world
[1:10:03] the wrong way something's wrong with our
[1:10:04] lives
[1:10:06] right now i don't know how often it has
[1:10:08] to be i'm just saying i've experienced
[1:10:10] people hating me because i stand on the
[1:10:12] word of god
[1:10:13] but i didn't get this for myself i got
[1:10:16] the bible right here
[1:10:18] right he boldly taught them
[1:10:20] but they hated him they wanted to grab
[1:10:22] him and shake him and i just wish i
[1:10:24] could
[1:10:26] grab brother jesse by the necktie and
[1:10:27] really give him one
[1:10:29] that's what they want to do praise god
[1:10:33] now in john 8 jesus went out the mount
[1:10:34] of olives early in the morning he came
[1:10:37] again the temple and taught and came
[1:10:38] unto them and i'm sorry and the people
[1:10:40] came unto him and he sat down and taught
[1:10:42] them so spiritual hungry saints will get
[1:10:44] up early for a 10 am service to hear
[1:10:46] jesus's teaching
[1:10:50] where's the mount of olives it's right
[1:10:51] over here so here was uh here's mount
[1:10:53] zion over here right here's mount moriah
[1:10:55] that's where the temple was and here's
[1:10:57] the city of dave remember the pool of
[1:10:58] sloan
[1:10:59] uh i'm sorry the gihon spring remember
[1:11:01] david david's guys went in there that
[1:11:03] was beautiful i'm sorry joshua's guys
[1:11:05] yeah no david's guys those dave's guys
[1:11:06] yeah sorry dave's guy sorry
[1:11:09] so this was the mariah well there's this
[1:11:11] garden gets set there's a garden sent me
[1:11:13] where jesus prayed so jesus would teach
[1:11:14] in the temple then he'd leave out here i
[1:11:16] don't know which way you go out
[1:11:18] but he'd go up in here and he would
[1:11:19] either sleep up here but then in the
[1:11:20] morning he would he'd get up he'd pray
[1:11:22] to the father first and then he'd teach
[1:11:23] the people all day here's what it looks
[1:11:26] like today imagine saying with jesus
[1:11:28] look at these rocky places you look good
[1:11:30] i wonder jesus sit on one of those rocks
[1:11:33] the kingdom of heaven is like
[1:11:34] 10 virgins that went out to me to
[1:11:36] bridegroom
[1:11:37] five of them were wise
[1:11:39] five of them were foolish
[1:11:40] which one are you
[1:11:42] praise god he would just teach them
[1:11:45] and the people would just be the bible
[1:11:47] said they'd be very attentive
[1:11:49] and they listened to him
[1:11:50] imagine you know if i took the service
[1:11:52] outside we'd all get distracted by all
[1:11:54] the cars
[1:11:56] the cheering at the bar and how they
[1:11:57] cheering the bar you know with the
[1:11:58] football games
[1:11:59] we might be distracted like that and
[1:12:00] church no doubt there was distractions
[1:12:02] in their day too but the saints had
[1:12:04] their eyes locked on
[1:12:06] jesus it don't matter if we're in the
[1:12:08] temple it don't matter if we're outside
[1:12:10] it don't matter if there's birds singing
[1:12:11] don't matter if there's babies crying
[1:12:13] amen don't don't matter what's going on
[1:12:16] our focus is on christ and christ and
[1:12:18] the law alone and his word
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:23] i'm trying to get to the close here
[1:12:26] i didn't set my timer so i may be a long
[1:12:28] time today
[1:12:29] i'm already an hour and a half so here
[1:12:30] forgive me
[1:12:32] yep
[1:12:33] and they said to him where is thy father
[1:12:34] jesus answered you neither know me nor
[1:12:36] my father. they said where's your father
[1:12:40] if you know me you should have known my
[1:12:42] father also in other words i act just
[1:12:44] like daddy
[1:12:45] i act just like my dad
[1:12:47] hallelujah how many can say that i act
[1:12:49] just like my heavenly father
[1:12:51] we should be able to say that church
[1:12:57] these words fake jesus in the treasury
[1:12:58] as he taught in the temple
[1:13:00] and no man laid hands on him for his
[1:13:02] hours not yet come church the devil
[1:13:03] can't do nothing to us until it's god's
[1:13:05] time let me just repeat that praise god
[1:13:07] they they hated jesus they hated his
[1:13:09] preaching they hate his teaching but
[1:13:11] they could not harm him until it was
[1:13:13] time amen
[1:13:14] see church that's why we should be bold
[1:13:16] just stand on the word of god god will
[1:13:18] protect you unless it's his will to let
[1:13:20] you go through a trial just stand on the
[1:13:22] word be strong be bold for the lord thy
[1:13:24] god is with thee
[1:13:26] amen no man or woman will be able to
[1:13:29] stand before you all the days of your
[1:13:31] life joshua amen
[1:13:33] hallelujah
[1:13:34] just stand there
[1:13:36] and then if god wants you to go through
[1:13:38] some tests you'll go through some tests
[1:13:39] but then like the apostles you'll be
[1:13:40] there saying we're glad we got to
[1:13:43] partake in the sufferings of jesus
[1:13:46] they actually left from getting beaten
[1:13:48] and they said in acts chapter 5
[1:13:50] and they said we give god glory that we
[1:13:52] could suffer for his name's sake
[1:13:59] and look what he says i go my way you
[1:14:01] will seek me but you'll die in your sins
[1:14:03] what a what is what a sermon that would
[1:14:05] be
[1:14:07] i mean i don't think i've ever looked at
[1:14:08] anybody in sermon all these 17 years of
[1:14:10] preaching i say you're going to die in
[1:14:12] your sins
[1:14:14] but jesus did
[1:14:16] because jesus god let him know these
[1:14:17] people were going to be eternally lost
[1:14:19] so he could say that you're going to die
[1:14:20] in your sins
[1:14:24] see jesus was loving but he was also
[1:14:26] truthful
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:29] i'm trying to here bring this down let
[1:14:30] me see how many i got here
[1:14:32] oh yeah i'm getting there i'm pretty
[1:14:34] close here now
[1:14:37] and then said jesus unto them when you
[1:14:38] lift up the son of man then you shall
[1:14:39] know that i am he so when he's crucified
[1:14:41] when he's lifted up and that i do
[1:14:43] nothing of myself amen
[1:14:45] but as my father hath taught me i speak
[1:14:47] these things so before jesus could teach
[1:14:49] others he himself had to learn
[1:14:52] before you can teach others you have to
[1:14:54] learn
[1:14:56] like i was telling brother austin you
[1:14:57] know with his testimony god's taught him
[1:14:58] to overcome different different habits
[1:15:00] in his life well now he can teach people
[1:15:02] how to overcome them
[1:15:05] right because he's had a special a
[1:15:06] special testimony god had to bring him
[1:15:08] through all these things and brother now
[1:15:09] you can teach people now you can say hey
[1:15:11] i overcame that you come with me to
[1:15:12] church i'll show you how to overcome
[1:15:14] that
[1:15:15] praise god
[1:15:16] each one of us had different tests in
[1:15:18] our lives
[1:15:19] and now some of us are being tested now
[1:15:21] but god is testing us for our testimony
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:24] and then after we've learned the lesson
[1:15:26] then we can teach others amen
[1:15:33] he that has sent me is with me the
[1:15:35] father hath not left me alone we can all
[1:15:36] say that church for i do always now we
[1:15:39] can't say this for i do always those
[1:15:41] things that please him we can't say that
[1:15:44] you could say mostly i do those things
[1:15:46] that please him
[1:15:49] and as he spake these words many
[1:15:50] believed on him
[1:15:53] since the world began now john chapter 9
[1:15:55] this man was born blind right jesus
[1:15:57] healed him
[1:15:58] he said since the world began it was not
[1:16:00] heard that any man opened the eyes of
[1:16:01] one that was born blind if this were not
[1:16:03] of god he could do nothing if this man
[1:16:05] was not of god the answer said to him
[1:16:07] was thou off together born in sins and
[1:16:09] dost thou teach us and they cast them
[1:16:11] out look at this they were you couldn't
[1:16:13] even teach them anything
[1:16:15] these pharisees couldn't be taught by
[1:16:16] anybody
[1:16:17] not even a man who was born blind and
[1:16:19] i'm seeing colors can you imagine seeing
[1:16:21] colors for the first time in your life
[1:16:23] and trying to tell the pharisees the
[1:16:24] preachers about it they don't want to
[1:16:25] hear nothing about it
[1:16:27] see because they love their creeds more
[1:16:29] they love the word of god
[1:16:32] see and we at church we all need to have
[1:16:35] a teachable spirit as well
[1:16:38] church don't you think don't you think
[1:16:40] preachers can tell if if if i want to
[1:16:41] hear their sermon
[1:16:43] don't you think brother ben can tell if
[1:16:44] i want to hear a sermon or not of course
[1:16:47] sometimes i can tell if people want to
[1:16:48] hear my sermons or not
[1:16:51] right but we got to be teachable by the
[1:16:53] word of god
[1:16:55] and i know there's going to be hard
[1:16:56] times i know we all go through trials
[1:16:58] but we should repent quickly of them and
[1:16:59] say god give me a teachable spirit
[1:17:02] help me to overcome it or i can't
[1:17:04] overcome this i can learn this because
[1:17:06] i'm a child of god
[1:17:08] and i have a good teacher the holy
[1:17:09] spirit
[1:17:10] but the comforter which is the holy
[1:17:12] ghost
[1:17:13] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:17:14] shall teach you some things no he's
[1:17:17] going to teach you all things
[1:17:20] and bring what all things to your
[1:17:22] remembrance
[1:17:24] whatsoever i've said unto you
[1:17:27] and this is where we need to grow church
[1:17:29] we need to remember in our hours of
[1:17:30] trial that's the time to say lord give
[1:17:32] me the words that i need to say
[1:17:34] lord help me to teach me to say the
[1:17:37] right thing at this time
[1:17:39] keep waiting keep waiting on the holy
[1:17:42] spirit and he'll teach us the words to
[1:17:44] say because he said that's what the holy
[1:17:46] ghost is for to bring these things to
[1:17:48] remembrance
[1:17:49] now look what god left you aren't you
[1:17:51] glad god left his peace for you
[1:17:53] peace i leave with you my
[1:17:58] i give to you
[1:18:00] not as the world giveth give unto you
[1:18:02] let not your heart be troubled let
[1:18:03] neither let it be afraid praise god
[1:18:05] church we have the peace of god today do
[1:18:08] not be uh discouraged don't be upset
[1:18:10] don't be nervous don't be afraid god's
[1:18:13] peace is here today god's victory is
[1:18:16] here for us today praise god god's joy
[1:18:18] is here for us today praise god he
[1:18:20] didn't leave us you know uh uh he didn't
[1:18:22] leave us a discouraging attitude he
[1:18:24] didn't leave us depression he left us
[1:18:26] peace hallelujah
[1:18:28] he wants to teach us how to be peaceful
[1:18:30] praise god
[1:18:32] he wants to teach us to not be afraid he
[1:18:34] wants to teach us to not be troubled
[1:18:36] before things that we
[1:18:38] see he will teach us what we need to say
[1:18:42] in that hour
[1:18:49] i'm almost done i got let's see one two
[1:18:51] got a couple more
[1:18:55] here's our text okay refer back to our
[1:18:56] text right
[1:18:58] so jesus said i spake openly now look
[1:19:00] with jesus afraid of his teaching jesus
[1:19:02] hide anything from anybody no
[1:19:05] he said in secret i've said nothing that
[1:19:07] means that jesus remember he pulled his
[1:19:09] disciples aside and he would tell him
[1:19:10] the meanings of the parables that means
[1:19:12] he must have went and preached that
[1:19:13] later to everybody else because he said
[1:19:15] in secret i've said nothing
[1:19:18] right church
[1:19:21] in secret i've said nothing
[1:19:23] he said ask ask these people i'll look
[1:19:25] at the next one
[1:19:27] she said why are you asking me what i
[1:19:29] taught
[1:19:30] ask them what's heard me
[1:19:31] what i've said unto them behold they
[1:19:33] know not what i said and when he thus
[1:19:35] spoken one of the officers which struck
[1:19:37] stood by struck jesus with the palm of
[1:19:39] his hand saying answer the style of the
[1:19:40] pride priest so
[1:19:43] jesus answered to him now look at this
[1:19:44] he gets slapped can you imagine get
[1:19:45] slapped and then he says if i've spoken
[1:19:47] evil bear witness of the evil but if
[1:19:50] well why smidest thou me
[1:19:54] look at the temperance that jesus christ
[1:19:55] had
[1:19:58] he rebukes them they slap him he rebukes
[1:20:00] them again
[1:20:01] and asks him and
[1:20:02] then he asked him in kindness where have
[1:20:04] i done anything evil
[1:20:06] now that's real self-control that's real
[1:20:08] self-control the holy spirit right there
[1:20:10] getting slapped in the face and then you
[1:20:12] got to answer back nicely
[1:20:14] imagine if we got stopped in the face
[1:20:16] we'd say okay how many rounds is this
[1:20:17] going to be
[1:20:19] who's who's timing us
[1:20:22] or if you take off the belt
[1:20:24] whatever he got
[1:20:27] but jesus said if i've spoken evil show
[1:20:30] me
[1:20:30] what have i said i've hid nothing i've
[1:20:32] taught before everybody everybody's
[1:20:34] heard my teaching
[1:20:35] what they hate him for his teaching
[1:20:37] because it taught against their wicked
[1:20:39] hearts
[1:20:40] see that
[1:20:45] now look at acts chapter one now look
[1:20:47] even after jesus resurrected he kept
[1:20:49] teaching them for those 40 days he was
[1:20:51] with them
[1:20:53] the former treatise have i made oh
[1:20:55] theophilus of all that jesus began both
[1:20:58] to do and teach until the day in which
[1:21:00] he was taken up so see he taught that
[1:21:03] whole 40 days he would teach the
[1:21:04] disciples he never stopped teaching he
[1:21:06] was always teaching them church that
[1:21:08] must mean we have something to learn
[1:21:09] every single day
[1:21:11] you know at school they have a poster
[1:21:12] that says uh today's a good day to learn
[1:21:14] something new well that's they stole
[1:21:16] that from the bible
[1:21:17] right because jesus was teaching every
[1:21:19] single he'd be there every day teaching
[1:21:21] them something new church we should have
[1:21:22] that attitude let's come to church and
[1:21:24] say lord i can learn something new today
[1:21:27] that will help me in my walk with the
[1:21:29] lord i don't know it all
[1:21:31] i'm not a smart aleck i don't know
[1:21:33] everything i'm not god i'm not equal to
[1:21:35] god i don't know everything i need to
[1:21:36] learn something today it's january 30th
[1:21:39] 2022. i need to learn from you today
[1:21:41] lord
[1:21:43] i need you for this week
[1:21:45] because i don't know what's going to
[1:21:46] happen this week but i need your word to
[1:21:47] help me fight it
[1:21:50] now look after he was taken up after
[1:21:52] that through the holy ghost jesus gave
[1:21:55] commandments
[1:21:56] unto the apostles whom he had chosen
[1:22:00] and he showed himself alive by many
[1:22:02] infallible proofs
[1:22:05] now i showed this on wednesday i showed
[1:22:07] how the
[1:22:08] uh the catholic and protestants united
[1:22:11] back in 2014 it's been a while
[1:22:16] and they said uh it's not the doctrine
[1:22:18] that unites us it's the anointing that
[1:22:19] unites us that's a lie
[1:22:22] we got to have both both unite us
[1:22:25] miracles and teaching unites us
[1:22:28] right and they say don't worry about
[1:22:30] doctrine god will sort it out when we
[1:22:31] all get to heaven no god's using
[1:22:33] doctrine to sort us out right now
[1:22:36] because we hear heretics and the bible
[1:22:38] said avoid heretics which are men that
[1:22:40] teach their own ideas avoid heretics and
[1:22:43] just cling to the word of god
[1:22:45] so just like today deceivers will not
[1:22:47] accept
[1:22:48] true doctrine they're never going to
[1:22:50] accept it
[1:22:52] i'm going to close with this here uh
[1:22:55] get your bibles
[1:22:57] isaac 20. i want to close with this
[1:22:59] isaiah 28.
[1:23:05] i trust you learned something today by
[1:23:06] god's grace
[1:23:09] as i told you i i mean i've just been
[1:23:11] really refreshed to see how much jesus
[1:23:12] taught how much time like if he only had
[1:23:15] so much time he had 33 years what am i
[1:23:16] going to invest my time in the bible
[1:23:17] said at every city and he was daily in
[1:23:19] the temple constantly teaching the
[1:23:20] people so if christ did that i think we
[1:23:23] should live our lives like christ don't
[1:23:24] you
[1:23:26] learn something seek god's bible to
[1:23:28] learn something new
[1:23:32] isaiah 28.
[1:23:36] now look what god uses church god
[1:23:38] through isaiah uses the illustration
[1:23:41] how am i going to teach
[1:23:43] people doctrine
[1:23:45] how am i going to teach them to obey the
[1:23:47] word of god and he uses a very personal
[1:23:49] intimate
[1:23:51] symbol
[1:23:53] he uses a relationship between a mother
[1:23:55] and an infant
[1:23:59] in other words how can i teach brother
[1:24:00] jesse to obey
[1:24:03] me in this particular area of his life
[1:24:07] how can i teach brother so and so to
[1:24:09] receive divine healing
[1:24:12] how can i teach our sister
[1:24:14] to overcome depression
[1:24:16] how am i going to learn that
[1:24:18] you got to become like a baby you got to
[1:24:20] become like a child
[1:24:22] and you have to lay yourself in the
[1:24:23] presence of the holy spirit
[1:24:27] and you have to
[1:24:28] read the bible
[1:24:31] you have to receive the preaching you
[1:24:33] just got to sit there i know it's hard i
[1:24:34] know it's long sometimes like today
[1:24:35] sometimes it's long
[1:24:37] but you gotta just like a child you
[1:24:39] gotta get filled up praise god
[1:24:41] you gotta get filled up
[1:24:43] and you got to lay in the presence of
[1:24:44] the father amen in this case the father
[1:24:46] and mother god almighty he's both father
[1:24:48] and mother to us
[1:24:53] now he in verse 7
[1:24:56] isaiah said
[1:24:58] the priests and uh and prophets air
[1:25:00] because of wine in other words they're
[1:25:02] getting drunk and then they can't judge
[1:25:04] the word of god anymore because they're
[1:25:05] drunk right and of course we know people
[1:25:07] do drugs today and all kinds of things
[1:25:09] now verse 8 for all tables are full of
[1:25:11] vomit and filthiness so there is no
[1:25:13] place unclean so in the jewish churches
[1:25:15] they were drunk uh
[1:25:18] and
[1:25:18] the religion had become polluted and
[1:25:21] they might not have had physical vomit
[1:25:23] on the floor but god saw spiritual vomit
[1:25:25] everywhere i know that's a hard thing to
[1:25:27] say
[1:25:28] but that's what that's what god says
[1:25:30] remember in revelation 3 brother with
[1:25:32] the
[1:25:33] laodicean church jesus said because you
[1:25:35] love the things of the world i've
[1:25:37] vomited you out of my mouth
[1:25:40] see
[1:25:40] man-made religion makes christ sick
[1:25:43] and when people make him sick he spews
[1:25:45] them out of the body
[1:25:47] right they're no longer his mouthpiece
[1:25:48] they're no longer speaking for him
[1:25:52] now look at verse 9
[1:25:55] church whom shall god teach knowledge
[1:25:59] whom shall he make to understand
[1:26:01] doctrine how can i understand divine
[1:26:02] healing how can i understand the baptism
[1:26:04] of the holy ghost
[1:26:06] how can i understand how to be a better
[1:26:08] husband or a better father to my
[1:26:10] children
[1:26:14] them that are what wean from the milk
[1:26:17] and drawn from the breasts
[1:26:19] so you have to pick yourself you have to
[1:26:21] be so close to god like a toddler or a
[1:26:23] baby as close to their mother
[1:26:29] and what does that mean for us look at
[1:26:31] verse 10 for precept or command must be
[1:26:33] upon precept precept upon priests in
[1:26:36] other words bible verse upon bible verse
[1:26:38] upon bible verse upon bible verse
[1:26:41] okay so what's the milk of god the bible
[1:26:43] praise god
[1:26:45] you've got to have bible verse bible
[1:26:46] verse bible verse bible verse if you
[1:26:48] want to understand god's ways
[1:26:54] he said line up online line up online
[1:26:56] hear a little there a little for with
[1:26:57] stammering lips another tongue we speak
[1:26:59] to this people that was speaking at
[1:27:00] pentecost
[1:27:01] to whom he said this is the rest
[1:27:03] wherewith ye shall cause the weary to
[1:27:04] rest and this is the refreshing but ye
[1:27:07] would not hear but the word lord was
[1:27:09] unto them the believers precept upon
[1:27:11] precept precept them on precept line
[1:27:13] upon line line upon line here little and
[1:27:15] their little that they might go and fall
[1:27:17] backward and be broken and snared and
[1:27:19] taken let's stand to our feet
[1:27:23] true believers
[1:27:24] musicians can come true believers will
[1:27:27] place themselves in a position of
[1:27:29] intimacy with god
[1:27:34] and they will accept god feeding them
[1:27:36] command upon command
[1:27:39] right line upon line
[1:27:42] i showed you this remember i told you
[1:27:43] this a few years ago i had to learn with
[1:27:45] divine healing i just can't cast out
[1:27:47] every devil i can't just command someone
[1:27:49] to be healed i have to ask them first
[1:27:52] and i still have to remember this church
[1:27:53] i'm still trying to learn this lesson
[1:27:54] from years ago before you pray for
[1:27:56] anybody make sure you say have you
[1:27:57] confessed all your sins
[1:28:00] because if not you might be trying to
[1:28:02] drive away a spirit but yet god wants
[1:28:03] that there to correct them
[1:28:07] you might be going opposite of what god
[1:28:09] actually wants them to do
[1:28:12] and i admit as a preacher i'm still
[1:28:14] learning how to do that every single
[1:28:15] time
[1:28:16] and i need god's help to do that
[1:28:22] learning
[1:28:23] here a little there little
[1:28:25] hope you got a little bit today get a
[1:28:26] little bit today got a little bit on
[1:28:28] wednesday

[1:28:35] they're a little
[1:28:37] just lay in the arms of christ how many
[1:28:38] want to rest in christ's arms
[1:28:41] let's bow our heads
[1:28:43] and let's pray that church
[1:28:45] let's pray lord teach me your knowledge
[1:28:49] teach me your commands
[1:28:53] because that's what this is coming down
[1:28:55] to
[1:28:55] like we saw in canada this is coming
[1:28:57] down we know i don't know if it'll be in
[1:28:58] our lifetime but it's coming down to the
[1:29:00] last forbidding
[1:29:04] the law is forbidding our doctrine from
[1:29:06] the bible
[1:29:12] and we have to be so strong on the bible
[1:29:13] like jesus said you want to go away as
[1:29:15] well
[1:29:17] and we have to say
[1:29:19] we have the words of eternal life
[1:29:21] jesus christ has spoken to us the words
[1:29:23] of his life
[1:29:25] let's pray together heavenly father
[1:29:27] lord god we
[1:29:28] love you today i've gone long but you
[1:29:30] only got one service
[1:29:32] thank you god for the word of god that
[1:29:33] we've heard today amen i'm blessed i'm
[1:29:36] served by the holy spirit
[1:29:38] for all the children of god will hear
[1:29:40] the word of god today
[1:29:43] lord let us see ourselves like children
[1:29:45] lord god
[1:29:46] like we don't know it all
[1:29:50] where we can honestly say lord i want to
[1:29:52] understand your ways
[1:29:54] i want to understand your teachings
[1:29:59] i can still learn
[1:30:02] if i don't learn then i become rich and
[1:30:04] increase with goods and have need of
[1:30:05] nothing ah
[1:30:07] god we don't want to be vomited out
[1:30:11] of course we know we're sealed it will
[1:30:12] never happen but we want to take
[1:30:14] warnings as well
[1:30:16] the bible said approach lord your bible
[1:30:18] tells us to approach salvation with fear
[1:30:20] and trembling
[1:30:21] amen
[1:30:23] so lord help us to have this attitude
[1:30:26] of unteachable
[1:30:29] give us that deep meat to chew on like
[1:30:31] we said
[1:30:32] earlier every promise of god that's
[1:30:35] revealed
[1:30:36] is ours
[1:30:39] the right mental attitude to every
[1:30:41] revealed promise will bring it to pass
[1:30:43] but it's got to be revealed
[1:30:45] first
[1:30:47] thank you god for these truths
[1:30:49] thank you for
[1:30:50] holding us today lord
[1:30:52] thank you for holding us close lord god

[1:31:06] for all children will nurse from el
[1:31:07] shaddai
[1:31:09] all children of god will nurse from god
[1:31:13] and grow in grace and knowledge of the
[1:31:14] lord
[1:31:16] in jesus christ's name
[1:31:19] and the saint said
