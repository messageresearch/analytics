[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it's how that song thank you that's wrong I agree meaning in my life after I came to the Lord I'm going to show us a little a little bit because God had been doing too many great things in my life the most great everything that happened to me it was when he called me before he called me I was an unbeliever I persecute the Christians and I was trading in my country not to believe in God and in that way I spent too many years and for some reason it was it was in the devil hand you know so my thing was no good at all and I was a young man know the world like I am right now but the life has one meaning for me now value was before almost 6 years ago I came to this world and I have a great father a great mother I am very proud about them and they they did the best to me because I was a firstborn and they sent me to the school through with a lot of difficulties we want and really really poverty and to go from my house to the school we had to go to to the mall and my mommy carry me on her shoulders yes to make me go to the school clean I hope God give her a reward for that you know I will make it shorter because I want to listen something for my brother yes please forgive me in 1990 in 1990 we have a new government in my country so Nicaragua although although you know and at that time I don't have a job and only was something like a vagabond life I I don't miss it my father's house nobody obviously from town to town spend spend the life or living the life we call that but really really is killing the life you know and one day one day I found I found a woman and the highway waiting for the bus to go from one village to the village where I live I stop and I offer to her awry and and I give a ride to her to her house and after a few days I start to visit this lady and six month later she become to be my wife you know we don't know how God works just we know that he does and this is the point over here the she she wasn't message over ten years when I met her but she know that I was unbelievable so the less I want to talk about that it was a religion and so she never talked about religion to me and while we get married and her pastor he came to visit to her on the house and every time when I saw him after work I hate him yeah and I say what's going over here what this man is doing over here you don't have nothing to do why he don't have to go somewhere else and I thought what I thought that one might thought I never talked about that I just only thought about that and but every time when I saw that man on the street I just must say myself I hate this [Music] for some reason I mean this is the education that I get from my father's they training me to I will call training but I think it was a good seed that they plan on me it was reading books and through my whole life I've been reading I will read unreal more than five or six thousand books yeah when I went to the school I spend my free time and the library reading and reading and reading always before school and after school and I had the honor to share the same profession but I Jesse I am a teacher I never told you and I am AG unaccountable so but I never I never having a school a charge so I try never were like a teacher but it's a but it's a it's a good job I love it because I read a lot I read a lot too many I read too many books not this one and I went to the library in my country so I check all the books pretty much all of them read it and I remember also I I lost my job someday in John probably or june/july my wife has a book like this but all this altogether was ten message the spoken word was attendee yes stick together in one book and I don't I don't remember the name of the other ones right now I don't even think I remember but just one in particular the this message is spiritual food and the season and the reason why I remember that message it's because I had to use some pictures so please forgive me for this dollar is that my brain is almost blown out so I had to remember to the pictures and the third page and that book it was a picture and for somebody like me that never never want to learn about God and I started to read something because I had nothing to read I got this broken and the Turkish and that message spiritual food and the season with the speech it wasn't this way it was non decide it was very small in the cup of the book and and I look the picture and it was something like a supernatural open my eyes it was something that I cannot I just see the picture and move there move the page but the first time a sheriff and I I just say how god them came to me before I just start crying and I'd feel ridiculous I feel miserable or you can give to me it was like that in this picture I saw him I couldn't stop I was crying and crying probably for about an hour or something like that my wife was washing the clothes and she look at me she was a little scared something and I start to talk to her and I told him this is some strange I consider Jesus cry face over here and she start by a nose and she told me the first person the can see that's crazy and so that was the way how the Lord talked to me the first time this picture it was and I start to talk to her ask ask how how this is possible how a simple picture for me come talk to me in that way sit on me I'm going to call the pastor so he can explain to you much better and remember the man that I really don't like it here we come - with my best friend I love him he'll really pass away by he become to be my best friend we were good friends and he said explained to me what what the light was from those days you know because that this message the life today is led that the like we will hurt tomorrow but the light we got today must what we get gesture is from light to light from glory to glory you know and I want to share what I what I can see I I don't say sure this is what you had to believe no I want to share one how this come to me when I when I saw this picture I start to talk with that with the pastor I I start to go deeper and and some message they wonder my why have and and the pastor borrow me when it was a it is rising the song brother banner is talking about this picture in this way and goodness in this way well you'll turn the picture like this and look and you come and you can probably see it from the audience is Christ see his eyes look and here just a perfect that is Colby wearing the white wake of super supreme deity and judge on all heaven on earth can you see his eyes no his mom this is what I see before I read the message just turn the picture from from this way the white is supposed to be can you see it he's the supreme judge there is not there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message in the truth and there was a question for me this message is that true if something start burning in me it was something had to be more than that you know is literally I feel like I can touch God but the way how I feel it see see you see the dark his faith his birth and his eyes and knowledge he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand you know there you know the story and this and this came to make another question to me when brother Brandon say as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message will further on the second coming and that was something that start to to work over here you know and my pastor tell me take your time because and there is nothing I can do for you about that but God can do it he will reveal not now probably not now but he will do induces and their season is a there was a something like those were keep in mind always always always and something telling me if I didn't call you before you because it wasn't not your time you know and that message is spiritual foolin on the seasons that one day turning into the right look and there was Jesus Christ just a perfect as Hoffman ever draw him in the same way that I saw him and and after that I found on the message in this way say he's looking down you know he's looking down to the air you know and you know the rest of the story I want to make it shorter and but I start to see this picture he was the only one that I have in my hand and my wife had the seven seals book I start to read that book I had no revelation at all no I just want to read something but every word that I read it was graven in my heart and he talked about the pyramid those seven angels and I saw in this way the pyramid [Music] you know that's the way I saw the pyramid and he's talking about their that this message is a four equals about the explained about how they equal comply that is not become very higher or has a mission like eagles and you know has to be something special for equals so it's in this way that I saw the eagle [Music] and sevensee is wonderful show me that in this picture need the Lamb of God you know and it was some something supernatural you know I cannot explain to you it's only the way how the message came to me and well the face you know and I saw [Music] before you came in different way you know this is this is the only the way that this came to me grating something I want deeper and deeper and deeper about this this cloud this power really got all my attention and and I will when I I saw something on this the Seventh Seal well you know and the message sir what time is it oh this is a sign of the answer he's talking about the vision of angels and how they come and make a premium you know you know the story and but it was something supernatural that I saw over here and the Seventh Seal they missed the brother Brown say did you notice that one angel I say in there was I extreme in yoga he looking more to me than any of the rest of them you remember that they were in the constellation three on the side and one on the top and the one right next to me here counting from the left to the right keep that in mind counting from the left to the right will it be in the seven Angelo he was brighter meant more to me that the rest of them you remember I say he had the chest out like that and was flying is worth you remember like that and I say it picked me up lift lifted me up do you remember that here it is the one with the Seventh Seal the theme that I've been wondering all my life amen them other sealed meant a lot to me of course but oh you don't know what this has meant he said that the angel that he saw at the right side counting left to right what the seven anger the picture ladies it a nice lady's counting from left to right the seven angel was more brightly now it for me it's for me I can triple the burhan space over here this is a little bit lighter this teacher verified you put a little bit darker you will see much much better the picture and I say and this make a simple for me when he said that he will lift her up for these angels and he was in that constellation you know and what is what I understand for me that he sold his celestial body you know it was the most important for him because it he got that Seventh Seal revelation thing that everything he said all the other things that mean a lot for me but this was more important because it was everything on it and after I want to talk to them I was very hungry for the word of God but that's the way only how the message came to me and after that it's been days and nights reading the message days and nights and you will say like I have I was so crazy but a 2 or 3 o clock in the morning I just cry and I say look how I waste my time before you know it is really when I look to my past I feel like I feel so really bad but when I look to my present and I say how God rescued me I don't have any words to express my gratitude is this me like all the blood of Jesus I want nothing for me you know but now is a special meaning you know is was well and what the words say that we are buy it with expensive price when they had a talk with somebody over there in my country and they said even if I don't if I never commit scene I mean if I make a decision today for you my blood is not going to save you but it was a match it came to the glory just only that blood can rescue me I start to visit all the people that I hate before and the grace the grace of the Lord I had to accept that I was so bad but Lord gave me an upgrade to go over there on fixing all my problems and be humble and ask for pardon and Sabian's forgive me because I I say these and about you I thought this about you I forgive me because I hate you but now I mister loving you and it is a heart it's very hard it's not easy we know easy like I told to brother Jesse a couple weeks ago for the Christian is like a fish is very easy to swallow the bite we hook the heartiness take it out you know because all from inside has to come out and I I just wish that every team but I have burning me out you know out because brother Brandon saying it in the book adoption that just one of those kind of stop the work of the church you know and it was not too many message in 1990 and I start to visit different churches and my country looking for message I was not looking for fellowship I was looking for message I want to get more books I want to know more more you know and they you start to show me what they have and I said no I have that one I heard that one I heard that one no I don't have this one let me make a copy and I'm I start to make copy the message well I don't have and this hungry made me trouble to Central America all this country's all those countries I visit all the churches Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Costa Rica until I get like about 400 message I copied all of them and this was some kind of blessing for my the church him in my village because they don't have also it's a man of message and they start to make a copy there so it was it was such a blessing you know and in a few I feel like I was living in a different world after after I can't see anybody in my house my house was the most visit and we talk about the world every day every day every day and we had no time we will walk in the street and in the street started talking about the message at two o'clock three o'clock in the morning in the street and the people open the windows to see who are the people talking I never get tired I never get a girl gave me energy but so I make my family for my mom and my father we are eight brothers and sister now for the grace of the Lord we are millions we are millions around the world I don't I just make one but I think at the grace of the Lord now I want to share it there are miracles God they can make you know he's the miracle makers in 1992 I was 2 years 3 years after I came to the mercy I was baptized in November 4 1990 27 years ago now the trials came you know yes it's not easy it's not easy and that depends our about our fate you know if our faith is very weak probably we don't have enough trial you know but we don't have an enough restraint to fight but when we when our faith is getting higher they Lord want to test you what kind of fan you have you know how you are going to use it you know because faith like the brothers say this modified his power and 1992 my mom came sick and really really bad and she was in bed and I visit where and and I can see I can see that she was dying I can see that not too much time left for her and I say mom I know I am I never been a good ball for you probably I've been the worst and the family for you and I started to talk to her you know and ask forgive me for all the bad that I was and she told me don't worry don't worry my son I love you I already forgive you said Mother's has a hard you have no idea idea you know even the worst kid for mom is the best they have a heart so big and she get better and better so I don't have another choice the doctors the doctor told me you had to get ready because she's not going to make marry barely she can sir secondly two more months that's all yeah so I talked to the family start to get ready because I'm this she can die in any moment and something came to me it was like a desperation or maybe suka like a revelation something came to me and I called six more brothers from the church with me seven and I call them to pray for my mom you know and and they came to my house I have a I still have a friend the he don't believe in God he don't believe in God but he was talking with one of the brothers and while they were talking we couldn't I start to pay for my mom because they were talking and and that and I was like in a hurry you know I I can't tell him stop you know I just went to my mom's room I just see I pause and this over here like probably like a one hour later they finished and we came to pray for my mom which we call her but she dementia you know and just as you thought well this she's gone and I just concede it's been moving very very slow slow so we decide to to pray from my mom we tie our hands together [Music] all the seven brothers and we started to pray him for my mom after a few seconds it was some kind of power some kind of power like trying to pull out our hand trying to break the chain you know and we get excited with care I will cold scare you no I just remembered I say this war Holy Father give me a strand or keep this chain tie I remember that it was something strong when he stole minister really strong it I remember the roof of my house make an explosion a very big explosion I was scared I was afraid to open my eyes everybody was when they finished to pray we look to the roof everything was normal and I look my mom my mom has open she sit on the bed and I asked her how do you feel mom and she told me I'm okay where you called me say whether you call me and and I said what did what do you mean what do you call me you Sigma no I was nothing I was with my mom I was with my dad and that beautiful garden I she starts to tell me about flowers and house ISM and and I'd say wow my mom made as they my mom made it it was something we start crying you know and and one of the brother was the doctor was right there in the prayer line even after the pray he told me two more months it ray and it was sunk and I said wait a minute God God already gave me my mom I don't think it's going to be like this you know and too many question came to mind to me but the grace and mercy came again and the two months the doctors say God throw over there and the garbage and I have my mom for ten more years every year on those ten years my mom I had the opportunity to give it a message and she came to the message I got baptized and when she I think I think she made it I don't really sure she made it and I the only thing I can say is I eyes I have a hope I believe that me on the river I hope to see her again you know knowing these mortal bodies but in those glorified bodies than where I think when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain time he saw my mom you know and I think he saw me otherwise I couldn't be here in the message because this is the clue this is no way that's really that's really great is this no unfortunately my dad he died a couple years ago but he never want to come to the message and you know yes God knows why you know it's sometime like a human we want to do our best for our low ones that we don't know walk us bread and and that way I be I had too many trials in my life too many too many really really when I came to Christ and when I have more fight but what I have in the world you know but - God - God be the victory God without him now there's nothing we can do nothing we can do now years later year later my daughter my daughter has has a little child Christopher you know you know Christopher a story right the devil try to kill him even when he wasn't mom you know and what made possible Christopher still here is your prayers that you're praying yeah I get a great to God you know he born with that kind of sickness has over 200 seizures every day every day can you imagine more than 200 times every day biting his tongue bleeding he cannot eat he cannot drink every single day every single night and we pray for him we we pray her you know church we pray together I have some pictures brothers and and you know all those kind of MRI EKGs do you think that will make you happy as in Cleveland Clinic and take a blood samples every four hours it was really really scheming and nothing like he can eat also because they need the blood sample without food and I'm worth more and this picture is very particular is I had to say something about this after we pray we pray very hard for Christopher and one day one day in his room a man came to him I mean came to him and touched his forehead Christopher who is this he don't know the name at that time he was a couple years old that he start to say a man came to me and touch my father he he told me I I am here i am here and so we don't know how to do we don't know how to do yes we thought it was something about mental problems probably but the second time the second time the same person came to him and told you forehead again and told him you are here this time he say a man came to me and he looked like a my grandpa on those day on those day Ahamed big and for some reason I thought about that picture and I went to my house and took the picture and I gave it to him Asuna he saw the picture he says the member he came to me he came three times he came three times and we talked with brother Jesse and said trees / facial and I said this is my grandson Chris his name is Christopher kickers a dream with a person he said he looked like a his grandpa on those day I haven't shaved so I look like this that man came to my room in with his hand he touch my forehead and to me so on your heel and he told this transparent I ride away father he has a mission and I went to my house and I saw him the picture when see when he saw the picture he'd say is him with him he came to my room he touched my forehead with his hand and told me your heel I believe the Lord Jesus Christ reach to him that day thank you Lord Jesus and for the glory of God today Christopher's here grace mercy the faith in action the Braille in Exum I have no words to say thank you to you church for your

remember when we pray about him I remember the words brother Brandon received from the angel and told him he was sincere when you pray no matter what kind of sickness you will face even the cancer has to go out you know and I talk to them and say and just try go back to it in your memory you do something wrong fix it is nothing that can stop you clean your heart and everything will be done best medical report we had a medical I had a history from Christopher also my daughter's she don't write see it but I keep it because it's a testimony you know it's a testimony I come to now I think it's a couple more teachers oh I forgot to say something I listen right down over here when Christopher was really really bad in a bad shape I went to his house and I prayed for him um have I make the wrong prayer you know and I remember and I recognized you because this happened to me fast I say I said Lord heal him my days is almost over Lord take my life but let him leave and he came to to my house and we lay down in the bed that day this issue restoran me and I was their answer because I asked for that you know and I said it's something came to my heart and see how that is possible how that is possible you made the wrong prayer you know you King asked for life asking dead for you and that Sunday two days two or three day later brother Simon was over here and I came to talk to him and I tell him what happened I have those issue for two or four days and I told to brother Simon what happen and he prayed for me and for the glory of God that was the day last day I houses and he don't have anymore is it yet that does show me that I when I ask for something I had to do it in the right way you know I made a mistake and I pay for that yeah we had the pyramid now this is Samuel now today this is Samuel three days ago three or four days you know yes amazing okay now we can go to the next one this picture rather that's the picture that came to me in 1990 inviting ID I get that picture from the magazine only believe and and I read the magazine and I say oh I would like to be there someday I would like to be someday and and and I start to think about that talking with the pastor and all the brothers in the church and I said for me that lamb has to be anointing is like you know a nice talk about the Prophet that was buried long time ago and remember in the Bible that when they put in their body they throw him and he get life right away you know and I'm brother Billy poles tell a testimony about a lady her husband was a drunk I don't man she came to the tournament grabbed a little bit dirt and when he got drunk threw the dirt on him and say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the same anointing I wasn't that prophecies in this prophet because that's God and she he never don't get wrong again you know they anoint instill here and see so 27 years later 23rd year later the grace of the Lord put in my way my past brother Jesse we talked about to go to Jefferson bill maybe someday probably carry the three or four years ago or something like that we talked about probably someday go to here for something finally we wind I think it were two weeks ago in the world I was so excited really really excited and this is this is what was on my mind you know one want to see that Eagle like that when we went over there the eagle is not like this you know different now in that is in this way and what and I grab a little bit dirt and I carry with and I carry with me I have it you know I have it with me I'm not worshipping there with the ground or the land no you know no you know I do believe they are mountain that was on brother Brandon is the same annoyed and that is with us today you know he long chain he's the same yesterday today and forever and there is one more one last one more picture that one you know the Eagles I think we are getting ready for an eagle flag you know thank you brother Jesse thank you this is amazing how the Lord for this in your heart how he made possible all the things and we have a safe travel and I I feel myself like every place that I stopped when Jefferson bill it was in the same place that brother Brandon state especially when we get those red hot [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I appreciate his testimony wonderful praise the woman I'm gonna share that with other Simon I know he'll be really encouraged by that that was the last day you had a seizure amen amen isn't wonderful to see how God gets ahold of everybody praise the Lord you know everybody has their unique testimony and I love that how God showed brother Jose himself in the cloud there that was really beautiful and I was asking brother Craig about that I said you know what do you know about the cloud and you know you know believe the sign and all these people always attack the cloud and whether Craig said did you know the very first time brother Branham mentioned that life magazine was in the standing of the gap and at the end of that sermon God vindicated that cloud by raising brother away from the dead that's this I wouldn't looked it up this week that was this that was a sermon brother Wade died but I was talking about all these nervousness and complexes he said brother way you've got a complex and all these things and all these and then they pretty soon you hear him hush down and brother Branham says I call for that life in the name of Jesus Christ that's a brother Craig said see it was God indicating that there was life in that cloud that cloud represented the life of God God coming down to minister to his bride aren't you glad they meant that Christ come down aren't you glad the mighty angels with us healed Samuel Hill Christopher praise the Lord healed Jose it's the same God even not a different God it's the same God it's the Lord Jesus I remember Jose well the first time that I met that he showed me all those and I'm like okay I can see that I can see a lot better now it does especially the line the line you can see that really plainly that's really striking you know how Christ is the lion in Christ is the Lamb Christ is the eagle he's all the same praise the Lord he's in all and through all a men he's all in all praise God let's just think that is what will be dismissed here I he it's already 5:30 Eva Lord willing brother if God has you come back we'd love to hear the testimony of the Lord be willing but you heard you know some great things of his testimony this morning and and at lunch we heard a little bit too and I heard a lot of it yesterday so I got a I got a good portion of it yo you you'd enjoy it but if Lord give us another time I hope he will the Lord willing as we've talked about the message needs to go into a lot more nations you know seems like there may be some more time we have and so he came in 2012 now it's 2070 ho hopefully it's not five more years but hopefully our brother can come back before that and I know he can't go to every Church while he's here but when he when he can come in the area we're very glad to have him here and we're very thankful for the work he's doing for the Lord and may the Lord bless him as we
