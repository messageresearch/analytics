memory verse for this month so we'll go to ecclesiastes 12 after joshua 1. please ask or start with joshua 1. i'd like to continue to look at strength this morning joshua being very strong i like to look at strength again i never finished it from last sunday uh and then lord willing tonight we'll do another kids bible study if everybody would like to do that i told my johnny we'll just share the the private link with him if they like that by god's grace or if the children would rather have me stand up here and preach hard again i can do that too so we'll talk about that joshua chapter 1 please so glad i can say i'm one of them praise god amen thank the lord hallelujah let's just read verse six then we'll go to ecclesiastes 12 verse one joshua one verse six let's read that together on 3 1 2 3 be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for and inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them amen let's go to ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. in the text brother bang said this scripture reminded him of these little bible studies we've been doing with the children uh very very uh necessary scripture important scripture so we're thankful for god's grace [Applause] please ask 12 verse 1. before we read this i want to tell the the youth thank you for remembering the lord thus far praise god may you always remember the lord amen in your youth you will be so happy you will rejoice you will praise god um i just admire you know our children as i've said before they lived uh already living a higher life than i lived when i was at age way way way and way higher them being saved and sanctified some of them claiming to have the baptism of the holy ghost that's it's light years beyond me so i thank the lord for that but may you always remember youth may you always remember your creator and it will be well with you ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. let's just read that verse one together on three one two three remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them you know there's people like uh you know children there's people like my dad he doesn't have pleasure in life you know uh now i hope his testimony will change since i've spoken to him oh that's right in fact betsy told me last time that uh he has he's a total new outlook on life he's like he's happy remember that when emma was here did they say uh he's got a totally different outlook on life but for many years he said he doesn't even enjoy living so just something to keep in mind but remember if you serve the lord the bible says the joy of the lord is your strength amen praise god and that joy is a fruit of the holy spirit let's have one more word of prayer can't we by god's grace let's ask the lord to speak to our hearts today god bless you brother van gaal see you buddy happy black birthday brother we pray for you earlier so god bless were you 38 brother 39 39 oh my praise god praise god you look great buddy for 39. praise god let's pray and ask the holy spirit to help us here heavenly father we come as your children lord we're not the dogs anymore that was under the old covenant but lord now we're the children that sit at the table and receive the children's bread thank you lord although we would love crumbs although we would be a crumb hunters as brother adam said yet lord we're not we're not kept just to that lord god we're not uh we're not restricted to just crumbs we're here for a full meal lord god so i pray in jesus christ's name let the food of god that's placed before us may we receive it lord for we know you're always uh wanting to give it lord god we know you're you're the bread of life here today so father we receive your word we receive these songs we thank you for these songs we rejoice in what you've done may you speak to us today heavenly father may we receive your word and father let your anointing flow through our bodies lord our minds our souls may the word of god flow forth from our lips lord god that you might be glorified in our lives as faithful soldiers god we just want to be faithful to you today strengthen your people in jesus christ's name and the saints said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so i do have some quotes i want to share i'm going to start with a little meme that i found it's a good one well mostly good um i guess i think i'd change the words a little bit so i found this on youtube a few weeks ago and it says he looks like a warrior looks like joshua i think in my mind you know he might look like a joshua maybe i can zoom in there so he's got a great big army before him but he's standing there like a soldier i like this like failure is not an option i will not survive and hopefully youtube doesn't kick me off the youtube for showing this right like i did last time i will not just survive freedom is near i choose to thrive so it's a little rhyming poem here i will live for full force now i would say always on my knees as far as prayer right so i might change some of this i will smash the door if i can't find the keys but i might change that too because jesus is the door praise god and jesus gave us the keys of the kingdom i just like this uh illustration as soldiers and the fact that we don't have to live life afraid praise god we have to live life uh wondering you know what's gonna happen we have to worry about tomorrow the bible says it's already got enough sufficient evil of its of of itself we got to worry about today praise god we've got to overcome just today amen we got to be conquerors just today praise god and that's what we want to do by god's grace so let's look to the word of god here we're looking at i think it's part five and we'll try to preach god's word and uh and trust the holy spirit will meet every need here today i'm gonna have a need today praise god and the lord can meet that need through the word we're trusting him to do it i'm just looking if there's anything else i forgot here um i mentioned on wednesday that brother ben narad he kind of gave me a little opportunity to preach online so he has a he has a new youtube channel and so i preach for him 25 minutes on thursday night so it's just a little video on there i just preached on the three works of grace so i mentioned that i just want to follow up on that uh he's really going all in on the online stuff trying to evangelize so he's preaching at cams this morning by the way and he sends his greetings uh but anyways i like i like what he's doing he's just trying to get the word out um you know and i think that's an admiral thing to do like brother man said don't keep it to yourself right don't keep it to yourself share it with somebody amen if it's just a text if it's just a witnessing opportunity if you're just giving a book do something try brother said just try to get one soul saved amen try to get us all saved praise god i like that so let's look at part five here and i'm gonna skip past that because that was my notes leading into it i want to finish this idea here about only being strong and courageous we got through a few of those bless you and i want to keep going on this uh by god's grace so let me set a timer here i did wake up with a little bit of sore throat so just would you pray for me they gotta help me i gargle some salt water i think i swallowed way too much though i was i had quite a salty drink this morning a couple times there so if you just pray for me that god will strengthen me i don't i don't really don't want to get sick so uh let's let's remember this here you know remember there's three steps to strength uh it's first it's first relinquishing all your strength it's first saying god i have no strength right we all wanna the world tells you be strong and have a self uh have self esteem right that's that's what when i was growing up in the thing i don't know about you but i had all these classes about self-esteem you need to feel good about yourself and you're talented and you're strong and you all that you're smart and all these it was all self-esteem right that's what i had growing up i remember that we had all kinds of pictures and uh papers to color and things to cut out and it was all about building self but when we come to god it's exactly the opposite it's saying i have no strength but i can use your strength amen it's not it's not remembering anything good about me because there's nothing good about me amen it's about trusting in the goodness of god it's it's taking his strength and using his power using his word praise god that's the first step is realizing you and i have no strength and then we remember that god is always with us god is faithful he'll never leave us nor forsake us i'm glad it's written in both places amen because you might have had a hard time convincing me well brother just you're like joshua you might have had a hard time convincing me but when hebrews says i'll never leave you or i'll never forsake you amen and that gives me courage that god's with me today praise god just like he is joshua amen amen you know but we're very thankful but god gives us that promise he repeats it in the new testament see how he's the same yesterday today and forever amen thank god amen hallelujah and church we've just got to keep the commands of god we just got to obey and as we obey we constantly speak god's word we meditate on it whether it's through praising god like we did it in our worship today amen that's part of it water in the seed right water in the camel through your praise you've got to praise god and give thanks and everything and we've got to have a prayer life constantly talking to god amen and that through these through these methods we build our strength praise god we become stronger because remember the enemy keeps coming in like a flood praise god uh for a while you'll have it pretty good right but then there'll come a season when you feel overwhelmed and the church said never felt overwhelmed well i feel like it's a flood it's like a flood-like situation remember god raises up a standard in other words he raises up a banner against that in other words he said i'm coming with power to combat that amen even though it comes in like a flood there's going to be an army raise up amen that's going to be able to overcome the flood of challenges that come against us let us be encouraged amen in other words god promised to send an angel army to protect us amen hallelujah if we'll just call on his name and believe it amen hallelujah we've seen it over and over when enemy comes in like a flood god sends an army god sends strength god sends victory if we only call upon the lord amen we don't feel sorry for ourself we don't pity ourselves right but we we are strong in the lord and we speak the word and go forward amen now here's where we left off kind of left off on this i want to dig in this scripture a little bit more uh by god's grace because i saw how it uh kind of connected this morning he says this as you've received christ jesus the lord walk in him rooted and built up in him and remember we saw last week you're going both ways right uh our roots go down into the soil right but we're also growing up as a manifestation that we are a plant of god we're a tree of god remember i read that this week how jesus healed that blind man and jesus spit on his hands or spit on the dirt and rubbed his eyes and he said what do you see he said i see trees walking amen i think he did it again i think he spit again and rubbed it again he said now what do you see he said i see man amen i see him perfectly but he kind of got this initial he kind of got the spiritual view of mankind right the way god sees it we're all plants praise god and we're the wheat seed of god we're the children of god amen we're the trees of god we're the uh uh we're the field of the law of the lord amen we're the lord's harvest amen and so we're our roots go down deeper and we get built up and grow stronger and we we we're enlarged into heavenly places we're raised up we grow up into him as well we grow we grow down into him we get stable in him and we grow up into him as well glory and he said you were established in the faith as we've been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving praise god man always giving god thanks beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit so philosophy of course is the love of wisdom right but that's man's wisdom so we got to be careful we don't mix philosophy like this happened in the message a few years ago what was it they called it uh focus on the family so there's a couple preachers that have now fallen away from the message and and some preachers were taking some some teachings from focus on the family on how to raise their families and their families were torn apart and they've left the message and now focus on the family does sometimes do do good stuff right they do good stuff sometimes but the idea was they were taking fallot the preachers were taking philosophies that broke the word and one of them was oh it's okay let your children listen to rock and roll but brother ram said throw that trash out of the house even if you got to fight and argue this is what my mom used to you know we had like rock and roll she would like literally wrestle with us to try to get a you know we'd hold it like this like try to keep it away from our moms you know but pretty soon when we go to sleep she'd find a brother vegan and she'd throw it away she'd hide it you know but you know preachers in the message they've taken philosophy like well it's okay let them you know let them do the uh the evil things it's okay let them do a little bit but the bible says keep all the trash out of your house amen the bible says separate yourself from all unbelief amen and so the preachers that brought in this philosophy they corrupted their churches and their families and now they're paying the price of it right now vain deceit after the traditions of men so they took the traditions of of doctrines right instead of the holy spirit and instead of god's prophet amen right instead of uh after the rudiments of the world and not after christ okay so in other words if we want to keep growing deeper in christ and growing up into christ we can't take anything above the word boy it's so simple mine i tell you on the day of judgment it's going to be so simple it was all about just hearing the word obeying the word believing the word amen just stay with the word amen it's just that simple i mean if we want to grow and if we want to get deeper in love with god it's just so simple just stick with just the word amen praise god just stay with the word only praise god don't mix philosophy don't mix traditions of men don't mix any of these things in there just stay with the word oh it's so simple what a my what a witness it'll be on the day of judgment but now he talked about roots now jesus and this this morning i was reminded jesus spoke of roots so what was rooted jesus said he that received the seed in stony place is the same as he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it yet he hath no root not root in himself so there's got to be if you want to be a real genuine plant of god you've got to have good soil in your heart you can't have a stony heart right because there was there's the wayside which was off the beaten path and there was a seed that fell there there was four spots remember and then the the path this is the second path this is the stony path where you walk on right like our driveway's made it's got stones everywhere and we see plants grow weeds grow up in there every year right then they die right but jesus says this kind of the word fell on a stony ground and it had no root in itself right in other words it was not able to take root in good soil and it lasted for a while and jesus says in luke he said they believe for a while but when tribulation or persecution arises because of the world he's offended so in other words whenever the devil comes like this they give up instead of getting stronger in the lord amen hallelujah so instead of running into the battle they run away from the battle and they're cowards but we're not to run away from the battle we're to go right into it praise god amen they can believe for a while when there's no battle around when there's no demons around well who anybody can do that anybody can rejoice and shout and be happy and glory and cry when there's no devil around but let the devil come around then we'll see what you're made of amen i like that i like what the scripture says there anybody can believe for a while so in other words we got to remember tribulations coming persecution's coming offenses are coming in other words people are going to offend us right and offend the word but we've got to be ready to be stable and not let that overturn our hearts and our attitudes towards the word amen so being rooted means loving christ the word or truth so the bible said they had no root in other words they didn't have no soil the soil is the love of god is a heart that loves god amen that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love amen remember there's four kind of hearts right two of them the two there don't even have any love for god any real love for god right the wayside then nothing the stones not really love for god just joy they like the feeling of the lord which we all do but then the next two they do have love for god right and so the seed of god can begin to grow in their hearts and lives because they do have some love for god church foolish version the ones that are real virgins they got real love for god they love god but the thing is they start loving the things of the world do in other words we can't get too comfortable on this earth amen praise god don't get too comfortable and church many times god will send trials our way just to keep us uncomfortable and keep us longing for heaven praise god amen like a money disaster right or unexpected money expense that'll make you long for heaven a death in the family that'll make you long for heaven or a friend that dies or passes away that'll make you long for heaven right so i thank the lord that he puts all these things into our lives to remind us that this is not our final destination amen the sin soaked world i'm talking about amen but there's gonna come a kingdom the kingdom of the lord jesus amen that's the kingdom that's coming so being rooted means you're the seed of god is planted in your heart of love because remember the bible said the antichrist pope oh did you see this week he went to iraq what a what is what a statement that is the head of spiritual babylon went back to natural babylon for the first time ever that's the first time think about that the king of spiritual babylon goes back to his original roots and what's his message we're all one if that ain't the lie from hell right he met with all these muslim leaders and they're all talking about peace and the people say oh we've got hope we finally got hope after all the isis stuff yet the bible says that the the blood of all people will be the responsibility for all the blood is upon the catholic church so the pope's going there to say sorry about all the isis people but in reality the catholic church was behind the isis every murder goes back to the catholic church and i feel my voice i just can't go really high so forget it it's a little sore today but i don't know if you saw that this week he's spending i think he's there today having mass uh and then i said like this he's having a massacre there can i say like that he's having a massacre there a massacre of destroying the word and then he's heading back tomorrow to italy what a thing what a what a sign but now the pope he deceives them by letting them live unrighteous lives in those that perish because they receive not the love of the truth see that they might be saved so jesus or paul says you and i have have uh our faith is rooted and grounded in love in other words we have hearts of love for the word but the pope and his people do not they never receive the love for the truth in other words their hearts are stony hearts praise god the muslim hearts are stony hearts and it's going to take faith it's going to take love of god to give them a new heart it's going to take a miracle amen to give them a new heart so what the scripture says now remember faith works by love you have to start with love if we're ever going to have genuine faith we've got to start with loving jesus amen loving the word loving all that he taught all that he did we've got to love all of jesus amen see when we were saved we fell in love with the truth because jesus is the truth right amen and jesus so jesus said being rooted was an honest understanding patient and obedient heart now look at this church honesty will produce longevity in other words that that stony heart didn't last long because it wasn't really honest right because jesus says a good ground is the one that hears the word and understands it okay that's what that scripture means okay the bible doesn't contradict himself god does god is love and all these all these things we know and then it will bear fruit and bring forth some 100 60 30. praise god but remember the two kinds of seeds that the wayside the stony they didn't have longevity they didn't last very long because they were honest with god right they didn't really love the truth right but church you and i we've got to be honest with god and honest with our fellow man brother ramsay the way you know you love god is because you love each other amen praise god that's how we know so we got to be honest with each other that's the way we know we have good hearts hallelujah praise god now here's the scriptures now returning to this now the make-believer judas didn't have the soil right of true love for the truth in his heart how do you know because he secretly betrayed christ it was deceptive it wasn't truthful like he wasn't telling the truth right he hid the truth in other words he knew this whole time he loved money he loved all these things but he hid it from the brothers now i'm not telling all of you to tell your deepest battle to each other but sometimes it is good to confess your faults one to another right i'm not saying you got to tell everybody that i don't want to know vang and amens and jose's i don't want to jose i don't know all the details of i don't want to know all the details but if you can say brother jesse just pray for me i'm struggling or if i could i told amen remember brother amen could you pray for me i was battling a certain thing remember that that's because we get that's just because we get to talk more brother bang i'll tell you later jose i'll tell you later there's just certain times i go through seasons you know of different battles right but you know uh judas never admitted that you know it the bible said jesus knew his heart and said you don't care about the money remember when the woman was washing his feet he said you don't care about the money he said preacher's going to preach about this woman all around the world amen she did such a good act to me he said you don't care about the money i'm sorry you don't care about the money and giving it to the poor you love the you love the money right so he was deceiving others church let's not act any way when we come to church let's be honest when we come to church amen that's how you grow in strength before we're ever going to be strong we got to be honest with god amen we got to be honest with each other because when it came down for judas to resist satan could he do it no he he gave in to satan because he wasn't honest can you imagine three and a half years of miracles brother bang and he was he never got to the point where he went to jesus brother this is all you had to do brother he can you imagine this he just had to go to jesus after the prayer line say jesus can you forgive me of loving money that's all he had to do he just had to go to his pastor after everybody went through he said to go pastor can you forgive me of my love for money i just want to overcome this but he wasn't honest he was hearing the preaching and it tickled his ears you know he wasn't honest may god help us to be honest today amen that's a good heart again i don't need to know all the details of your problems that's not what i'm saying i think sometimes that hurts more than helps but just general you know i need to confess this to somebody i got to get this off my heart see there's a certain blessing to this to being an honest heart because the bible says there he had no root in himself he hung around for a while but he didn't have an honest and good heart see that here's where he says it but they that on the good ground or they which have a honest and good heart having heard the word i like this they keep the word man i wonder how many times jesus said thou shalt not steal and judas was like yeah right whatever right because he was eventually going to steal right he's actually going to take the money he was going to take the money and deceive christ he heard the word but he didn't keep the word that's why church every service is so important for you to keep your heart pure before god because we've all seen it we've all seen people hang around for years and then they can they're no longer strong enough how could you not be strong enough after years of hearing the word of jesus christ it's because the the ground the seed is good right the seed word is good but the ground's got to be are you good too they're let they let thorns grow up right they choke the word you can be so strong for so many years but if you start caring for the things of the world and pleasures and i skip this i skip my bible time there i'll skip my tithes there i'll skip going to church just just just little pleasures right oh my beatrice is like yeah she's seen it right we've all seen it they can seem so strong and and that plant can seem to be strong for so long but if they let they make compromises things will start growing up and i'm not saying they're not saved they might be saved but the ground wasn't honest right it wasn't a honest heart it was a pain it wasn't a patient it wasn't an obedient heart does everybody understand by god's grace because if we don't get this church it don't matter don't matter how much preaching we hear if we don't have honesty in our hearts we're never going to be strong we're never going to be strong because you got to start with the heart amen you got to start with the soil amen it's got to be good soil amen those other two kinds didn't even have good they didn't have soil they just had stone and wayside right we got to start with a good honest and understanding heart telling the truth praise god so important so important how are you doing today brother sister we'll be struggling with saying i'm doing good i'm doing good and we're not doing good and we might be struggling as and i understand you want a good confession i understand that too but if we are if we're lying through our teeth then that's that's sinful right we say well i'm doing good by god's grace i'm just fighting the battles that's that's fine too but the thing is let's win the battle praise god let's raise up and let's be strong and very courageous amen in the things of god praise the lord so if we want church if we want victory if we want to be strong we've got to start with honesty what is our honest condition before god like i preached that message to brother uh at brother ben's uh live stream there on youtube and facebook and a brother emailed me the next day and said i loved it it was just what i needed he said because i prayed at the end i said may god show you where you are on your journey egypt wilderness promise land he said i'm in the wilderness there i'm just about ready to take the promised land i said praise the lord that was my prayer i said just be honest with god like you should be able to tell i just left egypt like i can still see the things of the world i can still see the world uh as part as kind of connected to my life or we can say out in the wilderness man it's hot out here it's difficult out here but thank god i don't see egypt anymore praise god amen i'm getting blessings i'm getting manna every day praise the lord thank god for the heavenly manna amen but i don't really own anything i know i haven't really possessed much amen hallelujah or we should be able to see i possess the promises of god and i not only possess them i'm living in them amen i'm planting fruits here i'm living in it and i'm enjoying it and i've got freedom i've got something that i owe i'm possessing i'm doing what god's called me to do i know exactly where i live i've got a permanent address amen hallelujah we need an address in the promised land amen we need a title deed can i say it like that we need a title deed in the promised land this is what god called me to do this is where god wants me praise god joshua told me to go there amen and i listen to god's prophet joshua amen amen hallelujah thank the lord church thank the lord we got to start with honesty because remember the cares and pleasures is what's going to make the difference between the wise and the foolish right the difference is going to be the foolish care about worldly things and pleasures that distract us from the truth so the word when it fell among thorns they heard the word and they go forth and are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to completion or perfection now look their lives don't seem complete praise god how many know what i'm talking about you want you want to feel like i've accomplished what god wanted me to do how many want that feeling praise god that's what we want we want to feel like our lives has produced something that's that glorifies god amen we're going to feel like oh i didn't really achieve what i was supposed to be and the word got choked out and never really never really got to what i was supposed to be ah whether like my man said whether it's a holy ghost-filled farmer whether it's a holy ghost factory worker whether it's a holy ghost-filled housewife may god help us to understand what we've been called to be and bring forth the fruits of our lives amen the fruits of our ministry praise god i want to bring forth fruit as a teacher holy ghost fruit amen in that school praise god i'm going to bring holy ghost fruit in the factory for our brothers or in the landscaping job right you want to bring forth the fruit where they can see love and joy and peace and long-suffering and gentleness and goodness and kindness and all these they can see the fruits and they can benefit from those things praise god but if we let pleasures and we get too much interested in pleasures and cares of the world they won't find love they won't find gentleness right they'll find somebody that wants to bite their head off right where's all the patience brother where's all your patience sister see that's what we don't want praise god we don't want the foolish virgin we want a good heart praise god that's honest at all times and understands the word of god now church don't forget this now here the holy spirit is your strength let me know that amen now look what he says here now this was almost at that song whether amen was singing how deep how wide this is right in that portion that's a very good psalm we're named after the whole family heaven earth is named lord jesus christ that he would grant to you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man so what's your inner man your mind and your soul so paul says god will grant it to you god will give you the strength amen god will give you his power in your mind and in your soul that's something he wants to grant unto you according to the richness of his love god wants to give you a strong mind amen god wants to give you a strong soul that's sealed through the day of redemption praise god paul says this power is inward working power it's in the inner man praise god amen in other words i don't know about you but i want to feel it i want to feel i want to feel the the i've had this before i want to feel the words come to me and i just know they're from heaven amen praise god where i want to feel i just want to see the words come out because it's it's not i wasn't even planning on saying it but the word just spoke praise god amen because it's the power in the inner man amen the power works from the inside amen praise god so this is where god paul says god strengthens you in the inside that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith revelation or assurance that you being rooted and grounded in love now here that's where he says that you might know the depths the heights of love and the breath of christ and to know the love because it surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god paul wanted those ephesian saints there was 12 of them they got the holy ghost at one time ah what a service that was amen what 12 of them and what paul is telling them later i want you to be full with all of god's power amen on your body and your mind and your soul i want you to be filled with all that he can get to you amen like brother said he said i just he said i want the holy ghost from the top of my head down to the soles of my feet he said every fiber of my being amen every fiber is yielded to the holy spirit it's honest it's understanding it's good now i like this because he now unto him that's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think according to the power which is love that works in us god is going to do how many how many have seen it god has done more than what you've asked him to do amen so god wants to fill you with all the fullness so that he'll be able to do above all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us amen so in other words god is going to use his power to work in you and he's going to flow through you praise god and he's going to do more than what you asked through you praise god amen hallelujah so i just want to lay that scripture down there because it's it's so uh beautiful there be filled with all the fullness of god like brother man said i don't want to dip with the holy spirit he said i want to i want i want a baptism of the holy spirit praise god i don't want to sprinkle the holy spirit immerse me in it praise god amen i might call it a holy roller i might as well praise god they've already kicked me out they've already called me crazy they've already called me a devil they've already called me all these things i might as well be full of it praise god full of the holy ghost and power amen oh yes glory now here's one thing here's one here's the way we we don't we don't often like to think of strength in this way we always like to think of strength speaking the word praying for somebody and uh there's america well that's maybe that's me right oh there's a miracle god just did a miracle that's strength but there's another form of strength that works in us and is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we asked or thought and that's through that l word learning oh yeah we all get through high school right then we're done i'm done learning well if you're a christian you just started praise god you were wrong i couldn't wait till i got done with college too i couldn't wait oh my goodness now i got to go back next year i got to get six credit hours again i'm not looking forward to that but i want to grow in the things of god amen i want to learn from the holy spirit praise god that's what we've got to have we have the bible says here as you look at a few scriptures the way we gre stronger is by learning how to please god it's that l word right have we looked at this a few months ago not that i speak in respect of what of want for i've learned and whatsoever i state i am therewith to be content so paul he's a 50 some maybe 60 some year old man a couple years before his death he's saying i've recently learned no matter if i'm abounding or lacking if i got a lot or a little i've learned to be content that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me praise god it was a learning situation in order for him to get stronger he had to kick out some of his old previous thoughts in order to get stronger in the word right like one example is like my wife and i we never would have thought we could handle eight children but they just came like this brother bang so fast i mean i was thinking the other day i'm like how in the world did we get eight children you know what i mean like it just it just goes so fast right you just blink right and then they get older but like in our previous mind this is one area where i know i've grown you know god has shown me to be content no matter what state i'm in if god wants to send me more children i got to be more content in that praise god i don't want to rest i don't want to fight against the lord right right if god wants to make me richer that's easy to be content with that but if god wants to make me poor then we've got to learn to be content in that praise god he said no matter what state i'm in i've learned in other words god christ has given me strength to be content with whether i have a little or a lot i want to be strong brother jesse i want to be strong yes part of that strength is just being content in where god has you praise the lord because i know how to be a base he said humbled i know how to abound i know how to increase everywhere in all things i'm taught i'm instructed both to be full and hungry both to abound and to suffer need i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me like as i was saying a few weeks ago you know our church kind of now is going through a quiet season right we'd say quiet thank god we don't have much battles going on right now like right now our ministry is in what being priests unto god praying for other people many times right like when was the last time you guys were sick i mean thank the lord right thank god you know we haven't been sick lately i thank the lord for that god healed brother jose thank the lord but sometimes churches go through difficult seasons you know they're just battling in other ways so that means that means that this lesson is for us right now right because we're learning we're supposed to be able to receive christ's strength to be content in the season that we're in right now praise god amen because in every season of life jesus is trying to give us strength to be content in that season hallelujah thank the lord in church you better believe me you better believe me when i say this it's i'm learning that praise god right my wife knows me my whole life since i've been been a christian i just want to go from miracle to miracle or a big thing to big thing and i just want to go from big major thing major thing but you know what the lord has to teach me to be strong and be content when things are not like that praise god i've got to learn to do that see but i can do that through his strength imagine just remember this pause receiving strength as he sits there and chains brother man he's chained up but yet he's learned the lesson and christ like i said that this christ is pouring his strength into paul's heart and he's just sitting there in chains he's writing letters or having somebody scribe the letters for him and he's just raising his hand saying hallelujah thank you jesus i'm i'm content where i am i'm content in prison and i feel the strength of god pouring on me there was a during the republican national convention this story just come to my mind there was a american journalist who was abducted forget which nation it was it might have been iran now she eventually passed away but she lived as a slave and she was abused and she was hurt she lived like that for years i think it was three or four years and in her final letters brother bang she was getting you know beaten and all kinds of things i can't even mention but in her final year or final days and weeks her letters were this her letters were that she learned to be content in the state that she was in and she she felt christ's power more than she'd ever felt before while in prison it was that l baghdadi guy remember when trump had him killed that guy was the one abusing this american journalist and yet her testimony was i know what paul felt like because when he was in prison the strength of christ came to him right and then when and so when she was in prison no i don't know where she falls why is her foolish i don't know where where she ended up i know we know she started out foolish at least she started out there as far as wearing pants and cutting her hair and everything like that makeup and everything like that but somehow jesus was faithful to her in the prison and before she died she quotes these words and she says i can do all things through christ who strengthens me his strength was made perfect in my weakness amen that's sobering church that's sobering an american journalist woman being beaten and abused daily or maybe on a weekly basis was able to say i know what that scripture means i'm able to receive his strength now which one of us will say she wasn't strong which one of us would say that i wouldn't say i would say if she could keep her testimony in the midst of that devil beating her right there i said she's got some good ground praise god she's got some good ground and so that means church in the battles that we go through we ought to be able to be more than conquerors in christ jesus no matter the condition we're in no matter the state that we're in we ought to say jesus give me your power amen i can do this help me through it praise god in fact i'll only get through it as you give me your strength praise god a beaten woman can do it in a prison in an iraqi prison then we can do it here in satan's eden praise god i know that's sober but that's the truth i'll fail to find that video the parents are up there weeping and reading it but that's that was their testimony that jesus christ strengthened their daughter as a prisoner for all those years three or four years and a young woman this was an old woman who had no life left i mean she was a young 20s and she still found the power oh can we say it like this jesus christ is real praise god amen amen there was no iraqi uh a soldier that could keep out the holy spirit out of that place hallelujah they could try to to keep him out but the love of god was so great it came down to the very depths of her trial and jesus poured out strength to her to be a conqueror even in the midst of slavery we'll say it like that prisoner slavery what a testimony now i pulled this up from my my series on wisdom you remember that it was right when brother william got here the first time i was preaching on wisdom in 2018. he kind of made me laugh uh i wasn't using many quotes from brother brown when i was preaching that and uh when once i started using more brother brahms quotes he said he said i didn't know if you believed in brother branham at first i said well brother i said i've been preaching up to that point about 15 years you know i just can't quote brother branham every service you know i kind of need a variety and i don't blame him uh but that's that's why i remember that because of this outline i remember brothers uh william say that to me bless bless his soul we sure love him but i come across the scripture this or actually that was it late last night this morning how many want to be strong a wise man is strong yeah a man of knowledge increases his strength a smart man knows how to go to the gym and get bigger muscles what kind of fool would we be to go to the gym and actually get weaker you know you could do that you could overwork and then not eat good and not sleep good and you could actually get weaker you got a balance the workouts with the right diet and the rest i remember it i don't remember it much anymore but i used to remember that i used to be up 190 pounds you know 30 pounds lighter than i uh heavier than i am now but the bible says if you're wise you know how to increase your strength in the word of god amen the bible says if you faint in the day of adversity can i get to that picture again if your hands go down instead of up the bible says then you're not strong right your strength is small well i just can't i just can't fight one more fight right i just can't do it one more time the bible says we don't want strong i'm sorry we don't want weakness we want to get stronger as time goes on right we want our knowledge and our wisdom to build us up to know yes there is a way i can overcome there is a way out of this temptation there is a way for me to overcome the enemy praise god i can get stronger i can be a better christian amen i can be more loving praise god i can be more wise there's a way to do it and that way is in the knowledge of his word amen amen so wise men are strong right like think of the wise versions the foolish comments said give it to us what were they they were strong and said no you've got to get it yourself they didn't give it over right okay oh yeah sure sure mr devil so-and-so you can have you could have my oil no they were strong and said you got to go get it yourself see a man increases his strength in church as we know as the rapture approaches we've got to increase our strength in the things of god right so again when you increase your understanding of god's word that produces more strength to defeat the adversary praise god yes let's remember this this was so important to me because if we say because if we say church we're the wise version we should get stronger we shouldn't get afraid of these times we should get stronger during these times chronovirus shook us all up i admit it you know of course i talked about that but see but only for a while right because pretty soon the strength returns amen right pretty soon you get stronger and you know the battle and you know it's you know what's coming and you're able to approach it and you're able to speak to that mountain amen you're able to speak to that enemy you're able to drive satan away in the name of the lord that's right how am i doing on time all right i'm almost done here by god's grace i think i'm almost done no he says now remember this is a great message on divine healing well that's the same way with preaching divine healing or anything else he's talking about learning to swim and learning to walk those two simple things that's the prophet's illustration as you go along you begin to learn if you don't learn there's something wrong see you've got to learn you've got to learn how to accept god and what it really means and from this message this morning this is what we learned we've got to love god and the truth at the very depths of our being right that's the good soil and then the word that falls on it it can produce the right thing if we just keep any love for the world out of our hearts praise god got to learn like some great lessons for me have been learning how to deal with brethren like preachers especially over the years preachers that preach false doctrine preachers have accused me of things or preachers that have accused my loved ones of things you know that has been some of the greatest lessons i've had to learn i've had to learn how to be gentle and not fly off loose off the handle brother right i've had to learn how to be patient right and and listen to people and and meet with them face to face that's been some of the harder lessons to learn i just told you the one about you know i've had to learn to be more patient between the miracles or between the souls saved right think about when was the last soul that was really saved here that was really saved in our church they got baptized well the little ones yeah little ones so in between the last one well i think it was uh charis was the last one baptized right is that right karis i think so so look now we've gone a couple of years between soul save right but it's easy to get excited when somebody gets saved right it's easy when somebody gets healed like with bang's father and who is father but in between there the lord is teaching me patience praise god i've got to be able to learn in the midst of these uh lower times of these these times of of waiting i've got to learn to receive christ's strength for this hour amen praise god i'm learning church i'm learning and you pick up your bible this morning did you learn something this morning hopefully you'll learn something right now praise god by god's grace see if you're not learning something's wrong something's wrong with us now this is what i want to say too i want to learn don't you want to learn to be more obedient to the nine gifts of the holy spirit i preached on that over and over as the years go by but this is clearly an area where we can grow we've got to learn so that if god wants to send a tongue in here or an interpretation or a prophecy or a word of correction or a word of discernment we've got to learn to let that happen by god's grace right we've got to learn to accept that praise god we've got to learn to lay aside everything and be totally devoted to god amen see that's something that we can learn this is time to learn this is time to understand the things this is time to not just know to hear about the message but to make the message live praise god amen thank the lord now remember this i just he wanted to grow in understanding of the lord so he constantly prospered as long as he he thought and increased his strength in the lord now an angel may visit you after prayer to give you strength right because jesus was in the garden he said father let thy will be done but not mine now church let me ask you why do you think the angels strengthened him in the garden so so he could disobey the will of god or so he could obey the will of god see after prayer when we don't want to do something and and then you know that we pray and then we feel like we've got to do it we've just received strength praise god we if we went into that prayer asking god can i not do this do i have to do this and yet we get up from our knees and we're able to do it an angel visited praise god an angel there's been times like that i didn't want to go to meetings i didn't want to call people didn't want to face certain situations but i got on my knees and prayed and god gave me the grace to do it praise god amen and now i'm just really right realizing now it was an angel amen praise god what where did that strength come from the angel of god the messenger an angel appeared to him strengthen him now we might not even see it but we don't have to see it praise god because we know it's there by promise amen he encamps about those that fear the lord now look he had a look he got enough strength so he could do what pray more and being in agony he prayed more earnestly hallelujah praise god well jess i want to be stronger okay well if he gives you more strength that means you're going to pray more praise god see we we we might think it'd be speak the word or go lay hands on somebody but sometimes god gives us strength to pray more to pray more and this this was of course preparing to be arrested preparing to go be crucified strength just to accept what has happened i don't like what's happened maybe jesus is flesh was saying that no doubt i don't like this can this cup pastor me but then the angel strengthened him and said yes lord let thy will be done not mine amen the strength of the lord so many times church we're going to get stronger in prayer i'll tell you i feel it almost every sunday i come up here i do these prayer requests i start praying pretty soon i feel the strength of the lord i don't know about you it just i don't come up here feeling that way many times but as you just start praying the lord just gives you faith and strength and it just raises your faith praise god now what else build strength obeying god and waiting on god or build strength now that's the thing i don't like too much and i guess you you could all probably say amen but i'll say amen to that i don't really like waiting all the time but when you obey and wait you get stronger now this is a beautiful beautiful chapter i just listened this morning go if you go there sis let me encourage the sisters real quick i haven't read this one for years i don't think uh isaiah 30 verse 1. somebody was telling me message teenagers sometimes the girls that they're not living the message they'll burn their hair right somebody's telling me that they burn their hair because they know they know they can't cut it with the scissors right they know if they cut it with scissors it's against the word but they can burn it there's nothing in the bible against burning their hair so they burn their hair but look what the scripture says verse one now you gotta look at the type here woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with the covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin so god is rebuking israel in this case many of them moved down to egypt and he said you're taking a covering that's not my holy spirit what was there covering the government of egypt the bible if you read this chapter they went down to pharaoh and said pharaoh save us pharaoh save us and god's saying you took a man-made covering like those women got today over god's covering the holy spirit and you sisters when you keep all that hair and you don't burn your hair and you don't cut your hair that represents the covering of the holy spirit amen is oh you're under the cut you're covered by his love amen you're covered by his spirit praise god and you want all of his covering amen because the bible said your hair has given you for a covering see that now in this chapter isaiah is rebuking them but then he gives him great grace he says you need to get you need to return from egypt isn't that interesting god brought him out of egypt brother vang and they went back into the world just like abraham right we're all human right so isaiah is calling them out this is 7 13 713 years before christ let's see that's this let's do the math there 1500 moses brought them out so 5 6 8 800 years later 800 years after leaving they wanted to go back and god tells isaiah he said go tell him thus saith the lord the holy one of israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and confidence shall be your what shall be your strength how am i going to be stronger about jesse well according to this scripture the bible says when you the bible says when we rest in confidence and wait on the lord and just obey his promises yeah life might be easier down there with egypt my life might seem more prosperous but i'm going to hang on to god's promises i'm going to remain in the land amen i'm going to keep god's word the bible said in quietness and confidence you're stronger here than compromising in the world glory i'll be stronger staying in the promise of god yet being tested yet having less yet having a harder life amen i'll be stronger here in the word than i would be out there in the world now of course he said you would not now a few verses later he says god is gracious and god's going to bring you back and god did god did but see they were trusting they were trusting in those stimulus checks can i just say like that which i thank the lord for but i'm not trusting in it right i'm not like oh i love joe biden i'm going to vote for buying so he can send me 2 000 but then he only sends you 1400. like it matters right but the point is we're not trusting in the government right we're trusting in the god of god who made earthly government praise god the god who's above all government we're trusting in that but what does strength look like many times it's just quietness resting in the promise of god i'm going to wait right here i'm not going to run away i'm not going to forsake the word of god i'm going to stay right in my position i'm going to stay right where god called me i ain't going anywhere satan get satan is not going to cause me to flee i'm keeping the ground that jesus gave me and i'm going to stay here until he moves amen i'm not going gonna forfeit the blessings that he's given me i'm not gonna retreat right i i fought for every inch of this and i'm not giving satan one inch back amen praise god i didn't hear you but man we fought for all these almost 15 years brother let's not give the devil an inch amen hallelujah i was reading through my old uh articles malachi maokai had a dream in 2013 he said there was two ships you remember this buddy there was two ships it was right after one night we were dancing the bluegrass christian music it was the day after our let my wife and i our 11th anniversary now i had a dream i was reading through it on my dream document you know malachi said there was two ships he said one of them was upside down he said but our family in the church was in the bottom layer of the boat kind of reminds me of paul when paul was at that ship you know but he contacted the angel of the lord down there and maokai said he dreamed he said as the dream went on the the other the other boat was capsized he said but then we started dancing and praising god and worshipping god on the bottom of the boat and he said then the dream said the next night or the after the night the morning came and we looked out of the boat and the other boat was saved and whoever was in that boat was saved because of our worship in the midst of the storm in the midst of the darkness praise god amen amen that reminds me of paul and silas praying in the prison right reminds you of paul he hurt hears from the angel and he goes up there and says don't worry there's not one man going to lose his life go ahead and eat a little bit and now that should encourage us let's praise god amen let's be thankful let's be strong let's be uh quick to give him praise because he's with us amen and our ship won't sink let's let's take everything that we have let's keep all that we have because our lives will be used to save other lives just hang on church just keep praising god in the bottom of that boat amen just keep singing to the lord worshiping him giving him praise i like that dream i thought it was pretty scriptural praise god i'm not saying it is but it seems really scriptural to me like bro man said jesus in the ship right wake him up come on wake up jesus wake up we need you jesus amen it'll save us glory do you remember that dream now guy okay yeah that's why i wrote it down because i knew we both forget now this is one of the most one of the most beautiful quotes in the church age book i mean there's so many it's hard to say that now we're in the sumerian church age ephesus samurai second church age death was not the only seed of the false vine but even in the true vine there was creeping paralysis see we don't want to be paralyzed in our faith right and impotence you can't bring forth life right impotence is you can't bring any seed because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years of pentecost i like this here it is right here and no true believer is any stronger and spiritual healthy and alive than his knowledge of the word and adherence to the pure word of god as seen by multitudes of examples in the old testament no one is any stronger than their dedication to growing in knowledge and then obeying it praise god you'll never be any stronger you and i will never be any stronger until we get back to reading our bibles with a a joy to learn more knowledge and then go act on it praise god hallelujah how many want to be strong in the lord every time an old testament character falls like brother brahm says every time it's because they stop obeying the word and they stop seeking god they seek other things right uzziah sought the priesthood solomon sought the women instead of seeking after god praise the lord eve like we saw on wednesday eve sought the serpent instead of her husband right she desired him rather than her husband see our strength the true measure of our strength and how healthy we are spiritually is when we are gaining knowledge of the word we're understanding more and we're adhering to it we're obeying the pure word of god amen i'm almost done here i keep saying that oh i got 33 seconds left on my hour side i ain't going to finish in 33 seconds but uh i can i can get closer to finishing a thought here let's finish a thought yeah let's finish with the full armor of god here just as an encouragement to us uh how many love the lord today i just wanna i just wanna hear some amens there we go okay good good i hope i didn't offend anybody but if you don't actually if you're offended then the bible says and you need the right ground right if the word offends you you gotta get different ground praise a different soil you need a honest good heart praise god there's my hour so let me close you know maybe i'll save that here for the seat for tonight you're a different thought i wanted to save yeah let me go back to i'm gonna close with a different thought i'm not gonna do that let me close with this thought i started this last sunday yeah remember no man could stand before joshua if he if he and his church obeyed right bang we've seen it no one can stand before our church as long as we obey the word is that right jose that right all these years there's no devil that's going to take down our church what i mean in false doctrine or in sin there's no devil that's gonna take us into a worldly lifestyle as long as we obey the word of god remember there was two only two men we looked at this last sunday there's only two people that ever stood before joshua all the days of his life and the first one wasn't even his fault right the men of a.i killed those 30-some uh israelis now the gibeonites was his fault and also the bible said they didn't expel the gesturites so church says just remember this if he only had two losses if you only had two what were the reasons behind it the church members did and i'm putting myself in there too the pastor and the church members if we ever lose it's because we didn't confess all of our outward and secret sins before we try to do god a service right that's why they didn't that's why they lost that battle they just defeated jericho my they thought ah we're invincible right but then you know aiken didn't follow the commands of joshua he took the babylonian garment took the gold all that things he hid it in his house right he hid it in there and then when they went to go to the next battle they were defeated because all i love when god honors our prayers right thank the lord for that and he answers our prayers praise god but we've got to be dedicated to that not letting any bitterness rise up any roots a bit i'm sorry bitterness grow down rather roots of bitterness grow down we can't hide the worldly things in our lives you know one time there was how many people was that there's been three or four sisters that came into the message they don't go to our church anymore uh but after they left they you know i was talking to him and emailing and they said well i never got rid of the pants and the shorts that i had and i thought well that's exactly what i mean the reason they fell away is because they never got all the secrets sent out they still wanted to wear men's clothes right and the brothers that we've had you know come by and gone they they never got rid of their evil music they never really cleaned out all the way and they would tell me a few times well i'm going to delete all my songs i'm going to delete all my contacts and they never did yet i tell them to do that they know they need to do that they know the holy spirit tells them they need to do it praise god clean out your house amen and they don't do it and they wonder why they can't get the victory the next time because it's all got to be cleaned out of the house any secret sin has got to be dealt with praise god any secret sin it's got to be dealt with if we want a constant victory in the camp hallelujah thank you jesus i love it brother brahm says it's he said it's in the perfect walk having a perfect walk in other words just constantly obeying constantly confessing constantly obeying moving forward wanting to grow in the knowledge of god wanting to grow in the things of god and the third and the second one was actually joshua's fault he should have searched out those men's confessions and followed up on their stories because remember they said that they were giving nights but they were saying that i forget the actual story now i haven't read it for a few years i guess but they were making out that they were like wanderers and they you know uh like they didn't live in the promised land but they did live in the promised land they just didn't want to die and so they dressed up like they were old they had mold they got moldy bread and all these things to trick joshua and joshua didn't search out the matter like he should have right and that tells you and i we must search out and confirm all testimonies before we start making decisions right praise god the bible said he that answers a matter before he heareth it it's a folly and shame on to him and we're all guilty church i'm not putting anything on joshua i'm just as guilty right we're all just as guilty we all make mistakes but the thing is we got to learn from them i say like this joshua never made that mistake again amen praise god and even the you shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint musicians if you'll come here i'm gonna close with this one here many times it doesn't feel like it while we're waiting it doesn't feel like we're getting stronger but we are when we're waiting on god we're actually getting stronger with god and that's because we're not leaning off of his grounds we're keeping our land we're keeping our possessions amen we're continuing to dwell in our inheritance hallelujah can you put that quote back up there casey real quick i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to read that you know a couple years ago this song came out the reckless love of god how do you remember that song and you know there's a better word for it we'd probably say restless love of god right but did you know brother branham said that we can be reckless so don't feel bad if somebody ever saying that don't feel bad because about joshua in knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless in other words god would never leave him so joshua could be fearless he could be uh and we'd caught reckless as long as he was pointed the right way amen hallelujah he might break up against the hill that would knock him backwards but he was headed in the right way he might he might run into a hill right and knock him backwards he could be reckless he could just move forward in the things of god he said but god would never leave him so can the church of the living god be reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way that's why church sometimes brother bang when people come up here for prayer for healing or something i don't always feel fearless i'll say it like this i don't always feel the anointing like that time when the tanya came up and got healed and brother aaron got him i didn't really feel a tremendous anointing but you know what the you know where the ramp says we can be wrecked we can be fearless with it though we can be reckless we can uh we can we we know what we're to do and we're just supposed to do it because we know it's right amen and that's what i've seen in many cases like that you might not feel something special you might not feel the fire shut up in your bones but if you know god's called you to do it you can be reckless in doing it you can be fearless you can go ahead and do it because you know it's part of god's commission for your life so can the church of the living god be reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointed the right way and he said as i was with moses i'll be with you i will not fail you nor forsake you he never forsaken moses how many know moses made a lot of mistakes god never failed moses he did not fail joshua he will not fail us he'll be with us let's stand to our feet praise god sometimes church i know you probably look at me you you you probably think i'm like banging my head against the wall right but why can i do that because i can be reckless with it amen i might not feel anything i might not have a sign and wonder a miracle but i know jesus said preach and lay hands on the sick they shall recover amen i know paul said preach and be instant in season and odysseys and whether you feel like it or not he said preach the word amen be reckless with it right that's so that's the attitude we're supposed to have if god's called me to this and that's what god wants us to have right this attitude of no matter whether i feel it or not i know god's word is right and i'm going to obey god's word where does the bible ever say uh be afraid and run from devils where does the bible ever say that no the bible said be fearless praise god jesus think about this jesus said his holy his unholy ghost-filled apostles right his non-holy spirit filled apostles he sent them two by two as doves right amongst wolves my goodness as lambs brother bank against wolves he sent them out there he said you be reckless right [Music] you be fearless to the lambs don't take script don't take bag don't take money you go preach the word that's how those original missionaries were set up so what do we got to be scared of church [Music] the thing is if we've got a word from the lord we can be fearless with it let me want to be fearless failure is not an option i'm going back to my little meeting i will not just survive freedom is near i choose to thrive i will live full force always on my knees praise god jesus will open the door because he gave me the keys i just made that how many how many know he gave you the keys to the kingdom peter's not the only one to heaven right he's the one that started having that and then any other person filled with the holy ghost glory can pray for the sick and they shall recover amen hallelujah he's the first one to open the door to the baptist holy ghost and any gentiles that was born again he can pray for someone and they can be born again he can open the kingdom for that person let's be fearless today by god's grace that's what we want let's have a word of prayer i'm not going to ask you to raise your hands but i'm going to pray that god make each one of us fearless the church helped you and i to learn that even if it's quiet like like isaiah 36 even if there's not a big move going on or something that we can be strong and have confidence in god and rest in the word of god and grow stronger we're not the person in iraq but we are sometimes in a prison of our minds in satan's eating we need to trust god he will strengthen us amen he'll send his word in due season amen the very word you need to hear he'll send his word because he's faithful he'll send you strength hallelujah he's the almighty god he's the all-sufficient god he's the faithful creator amen hallelujah he's the ancient of days he's fought this battle before and now he's fighting for you praise god he's fighting in you he's fighting in me christ strengthening us in the inner man in the inner being let's pray together church you just pray and ask god to help you to be fearless and then when you're done praying for yourself you pray for somebody in the church
