[19:44] no hope for him to get better
[19:46] I said let's speak life into that I said

[33:43] let's read verse one together and after
[33:45] that I'll read some verses all by myself
[33:47] but let's just all put our voices
[33:49] together for verse 1 after there say
[33:52] Amen all right so let's begin on three
[33:55] one two three to everything there is a
[33:58] season and a time to every purpose under
[34:02] the heaven now I'll read verse two on
[34:05] time to be born and a time to die a time
[34:08] to plant and a time to pluck up that
[34:10] which is planted a time to kill and a
[34:13] time to heal a time to break down and a
[34:16] time to build up a time to weep and a
[34:19] time to laugh a time to mourn any time
[34:22] to dance a time to cast away stones and
[34:25] a time to gather stones together a time
[34:28] to embrace and a time to refrain from
[34:30] embracing a time to get and a time to
[34:35] lose here's where we're picking up
[34:37] tonight a time to keep and a time to
[34:40] cast away verse 7 a time to Rend and a
[34:44] time to sew a time to keep silence and a
[34:48] time to speak a time to love and a time
[34:52] to hate a time of war and a time of
[34:56] peace let's go down to verse 11 he hath
[34:59] made everything beautiful in his time
[35:02] also he has set the world in their
[35:04] hearts so that no man can find out the
[35:06] work that God maketh from the end I
[35:08] start from the beginning to the end they
[35:11] got as blessings of reading his word you
[35:13] may be seated
[35:14] praise the Lord we're just like to look
[35:16] at this thought here part 24 we look at
[35:18] the tenth and eleventh seasons and let's
[35:23] just quickly review I like to do that
[35:27] you know after I take a little break I
[35:28] like to review so you can switch up
[35:31] there Lydia will go through a few those
[35:32] review slides there it was in it kind of
[35:37] inspired to me brother Brad never said
[35:40] this specifically but brother Ram did
[35:41] say the moon represents the bride and
[35:44] the moon the moon goes through 28 days
[35:47] of its Lu lunar cycle different phases
[35:50] and then there's 20 a there's 14 sets of
[35:53] two so there's 28 different times and
[35:56] seasons and so it's very spiritual and I
[36:00] can see from the inspiration of the Holy
[36:02] Spirit that Christians go through these
[36:05] phases Salomon wasn't just writing you
[36:08] know by his it wasn't just guessing he
[36:11] was led of the Holy Spirit to write
[36:12] these seasons out and so we can clearly
[36:15] see there's a time - in that there's a
[36:18] natural there's opposite seasons and the
[36:21] natural where you'd born and die like
[36:22] brother branham but then there's
[36:24] complementary as well where you have to
[36:27] die before you're born again praise God
[36:29] and then the Bible said you have
[36:31] opposites of planting and plucking up in
[36:33] the natural but in the spiritual and
[36:36] complementary ministers plant the Word
[36:39] of God in our hearts right and then
[36:42] things could get plucked up to which
[36:44] that would not be a good thing unless
[36:46] you're getting all the weeds plucked out
[36:48] of your heart okay but there's a time to
[36:50] plant the Bible said pause planted I've
[36:52] watered but God gives the increase and
[36:55] there's seasons of that where you maybe
[36:57] you've never heard a certain thought
[36:59] before but a preacher will preach it and
[37:01] it gets planted into your heart amen
[37:03] or maybe there's a little season where
[37:06] you taken the wrong spirit and it's got
[37:09] to be plucked out like I was talking
[37:10] yesterday to a friend and he was saying
[37:13] how a man came and was at their church
[37:16] and he was praying over somebody in
[37:19] unknown tongues and we know that
[37:22] shouldn't be done because there's no
[37:23] interpretation well this person later
[37:26] got a depressive spirit because this
[37:30] person kind of they kind of and they
[37:32] didn't know it - later but they kind of
[37:33] dabble in the message you know they're
[37:35] hearing the message they're a little
[37:36] with the Pentecostals and then the voice
[37:39] of healing and they're all kind
[37:41] dabbling but yet they were allowed to
[37:42] come in the church and preach and and
[37:44] this individual this preacher prayed
[37:46] over this person twice in an unknown
[37:49] tongue and it was kinda like a
[37:50] denominational spirit but a spirit of
[37:53] depression came upon the individual and
[37:56] then this other one had to pray with
[37:58] them until it got off them amen
[38:01] so see that's an example of we've got to
[38:05] be careful what kind of spirits we
[38:06] receive amen we got to be careful to
[38:09] prove all things and you were really
[38:10] thinking aren't you really thinking hard
[38:12] aren't you you ought to we ought to
[38:14] prove all things by the word of God but
[38:16] this is the case where something was
[38:18] planted in the wrong way and it had to
[38:21] be plucked up by prayer because
[38:23] immediately after that preacher came in
[38:26] like that and mixing you know the
[38:27] message with denominationalism to come
[38:29] down with the Great Depression and it
[38:31] kind of went through the person's family
[38:33] to church we gotta be we have to watch
[38:35] we have to watch what kind of things we
[38:37] say amen to right you'll hear me when we
[38:42] have guest preachers in if I don't agree
[38:43] with something I'll just say they say
[38:44] huh or interesting I'll say okay or I'll
[38:47] say nothing at all if you don't hear me
[38:49] flat out a minute then you know I may
[38:51] not receive it because I don't want to
[38:54] take the wrong spirit praise God but see
[38:58] there's a season for that now and the
[39:00] person was talking to me saying why they
[39:02] have to happen and the Holy Spirit
[39:04] struck me I said it had to happen so now
[39:06] you can preach against that and help
[39:09] people to overcome depression amen right
[39:13] everything we go through there's a
[39:14] purpose for everything amen there's a
[39:17] purpose for every season the reason you
[39:19] go through hard times church is to that
[39:21] on the way out when you give victory you
[39:23] can testify to somebody else amen and
[39:25] you can be a witness that yes you can
[39:28] overcome this - here's how I did it
[39:30] praise God amen but there's a season for
[39:34] that of course there was a season for
[39:36] good and good planting like we talked
[39:38] about there's a season to kill and heal
[39:41] and the natural medicine you know
[39:43] medicine will kill the disease and then
[39:46] the body goes to healing itself or God
[39:47] will kill a life take a life like Saul
[39:50] or spare life like Hezekiah for 15 extra
[39:53] years
[39:54] but in the spiritual you know we have to
[39:56] kill evil influences and then healing
[39:59] begins praise God James said that church
[40:02] he said when your gather together you
[40:04] pray and he said you kill one another so
[40:06] killing is like a church battle it's a
[40:08] church split kind of but God always
[40:10] brings healing amen to those who will
[40:13] repent and there's a season where to
[40:15] break down and to build up and the
[40:17] natural like the breaking down of
[40:19] Jerusalem and the rebuilding and the
[40:23] Bible said there's a time to break down
[40:24] strongholds the Bible said casting down
[40:27] every stronghold right that you might
[40:29] build up a stronger testimony for the
[40:32] Lord hallelujah
[40:33] and then there's life events that are
[40:36] weeping and laughing sad and joyful but
[40:39] in the spiritual its weeping praying
[40:42] crying out to God for victory and then
[40:44] laughing when God answers your prayer
[40:46] like we just experienced amen glory
[40:50] thank the Lord
[40:51] and then mourning and dancing is like
[40:53] you know funerals or or dancing like a
[40:56] church like I danced a few last month
[40:58] around the church you know I just had a
[40:59] great I just the Holy Spirit struck me
[41:01] just as I had victory that day amen
[41:04] and I love that I love to have victory
[41:06] and I was praying for God for more
[41:08] revelation healings and God has done
[41:10] that so we thank the Lord for that but
[41:12] they also type ministries because Jesus
[41:15] said John the Baptist made you mourn but
[41:18] he said my ministry is like piping but
[41:21] you didn't dance so see a healing a
[41:24] great time of healing and revival and
[41:26] miracles is a time to dance amen
[41:29] it's a season praise God we thank the
[41:32] Lord for that hallelujah and then
[41:35] casting stones here in the natural it's
[41:38] like tearing down or building up
[41:40] structures it could be gathering stones
[41:43] to build a fence or something or casting
[41:46] them way to clear off ground in order to
[41:48] plant a good field and but the but in
[41:51] the spiritual it we represented your
[41:53] worship because Elijah gathered stones
[41:55] that were cast out and to repair the
[41:57] altar for true worship so see there's
[42:00] times that your worship gets kind of
[42:02] broken up your prayer life gets a little
[42:04] stale right you're feeding on other
[42:07] things around listen
[42:08] to the Word of God and you need seasons
[42:11] where you you you gather them together
[42:13] and you restore your worship praise God
[42:16] Amen that's right these are all seasons
[42:20] and where they brother ray you've been
[42:21] around 40 years right we talked about
[42:23] that right and so see he's been around
[42:25] Williams been around a long time and can
[42:27] you brothers raise your hand if you've
[42:28] been through some of these seasons is
[42:30] that right all right Fraser well I know
[42:32] I have to not only been around 20 years
[42:34] and so you see it was very inspired
[42:38] Salman was led by the Holy Spirit to do
[42:41] this amen now let me go back up here
[42:44] just go back to my notes here tonight
[42:46] because I'll just kind of go off memory
[42:48] now we're gonna get to here but the one
[42:51] time embrace and refrain from embracing
[42:53] the Bible said embrace wisdom right so
[42:57] there's times where you're really
[42:58] embracing the Word of God right and then
[43:02] there's times of course you're rejecting
[43:04] any temptation those are great seasons
[43:06] amen we're not and we're not embracing a
[43:09] lie or a doubt or a fear or struggle or
[43:12] anger or temper we're not going to brace
[43:15] that we're not going to embrace on
[43:16] jumping to conclusions we're going to
[43:18] embrace waiting on the Lord for wisdom
[43:20] amen waiting embracing of course there's
[43:23] a natural like a marriage you know if
[43:25] husband and wife are praying and fasting
[43:27] then they don't embrace during that time
[43:29] or church problems you know if someone
[43:32] is out front of the blood you don't call
[43:33] them brother you might not shake their
[43:35] hand Jesus said it might like just make
[43:37] them like a publican you know and don't
[43:38] don't talk to him because they're out
[43:39] front of the blood and then there's a
[43:42] season to get and lose and and that's in
[43:45] the natural you know you you you have a
[43:46] season of gaining then you have a season
[43:48] where it seems like all your savings are
[43:50] gone but in the spiritual it's a time
[43:53] where you get revelation or you might
[43:55] lose the joy of your salvation right
[43:58] because the man said David never lost
[44:00] his salvation he just lost the joy of
[44:02] his salvation so we see that now tonight
[44:07] let's look at keeping and casting away
[44:09] because in the in the natural it's it's
[44:12] similar or very similar to saving and
[44:15] giving this is more like a this is more
[44:18] like saving getting and losing is just
[44:19] kind of receive
[44:20] it but here we come there's another
[44:23] season where you you save it you're
[44:25] keeping it long-term
[44:26] how many could say men sometimes your
[44:28] your you're saving long term other times
[44:30] you're not you're just kind of you know
[44:33] I got was my wife and I were talking
[44:35] this this this family that's got more
[44:36] kids than we do and and they were my
[44:40] wife was talking to to them and and they
[44:43] were just saying this that you know
[44:44] they've had a season where they want to
[44:46] save but as soon as they get an increase
[44:49] a big bill comes up but the person said
[44:51] I've got a choice
[44:52] I can either be discouraged that I can't
[44:54] save or I can be happy and say thank you
[44:57] Lord that we don't have to go in debt
[44:58] because the money's already here and
[45:01] it's here to be taken amen all right
[45:04] that's exactly what we go through see
[45:06] their seasons where we can say but their
[45:08] seasons where we get it and lose it and
[45:11] we got a choice because it'll be happy
[45:13] and say praise the Lord I had it in
[45:15] order to pay the bill or we can get
[45:17] angry and say I can never get ahead that
[45:19] would be the wrong spirit because we got
[45:21] to recognize their seasons that we go
[45:24] through praise God as some of them are
[45:26] longer than others praise God like job's
[45:28] we know the Bible said Joe went through
[45:30] his boils for months we don't know how
[45:32] many months but he just said months he
[45:34] didn't say years he just said months and
[45:36] so his season of testing was rather
[45:39] short compared to like Joseph Wright who
[45:43] had to save for a 13 11 years in prison
[45:46] I was on eleven years with Potiphar and
[45:49] then two years in prison 13 total years
[45:53] he waited and then finally in the
[45:54] thirteen years God God God magnitude his
[45:59] gift and he entities he's magnified by
[46:01] Pharaoh but he only had to wait 13 years
[46:04] for it right and we are we got to we got
[46:08] to keep ourselves from getting bent out
[46:09] of shape or discourage we got to
[46:12] remember that lay maker song that even
[46:14] when I don't see it God's working amen
[46:16] hallelujah we gotta remember that so
[46:19] that's why it's so inspired for this
[46:20] time because we're at a time where it's
[46:22] a dry spiritual season right but I said
[46:25] that the tears are bringing forth their
[46:27] fruit and we're bringing forth our fruit
[46:29] and my man says in the church age you at
[46:32] the end of the
[46:32] we see you don't see a lot of change
[46:35] amen on the outside but there's great
[46:38] change going on the inside amen
[46:40] yes and that's what we're seeing we're
[46:44] seeing change on the inside we're seeing
[46:46] more love and receive more obedience to
[46:48] the Word of God in our lives amen
[46:50] hallelujah see those seasons and times
[46:54] that lasts longer than others we have to
[46:58] be thankful remember brother ham says
[47:00] God lets you go through these just to
[47:02] see how you're gonna respond is that
[47:06] right he just wants to see how you're
[47:08] gonna respond praise God
[47:10] if you're mature enough if you're ready
[47:12] to go on to the next test amen but you
[47:16] first gotta pass this test amen right
[47:19] see we we all go through these tests we
[47:21] all go through these times and God is
[47:24] with us in the midst of the test
[47:26] remember we saw it last week but later
[47:28] said God is not going to push you
[47:30] through a pipe and call you an overcomer
[47:33] right God gave you grace not save you by
[47:37] grace no effort of your own you just
[47:39] accepted it but there's the seasons
[47:41] happen so you can experience being an
[47:44] overcomer so he can let you make the
[47:47] choice not force you to do it but he can
[47:50] lead you to do it praise God because you
[47:52] asked him to lead you did you not when
[47:55] you became as one of you he took full
[47:57] responsibility for you like the key of
[47:59] David right that's where the key of
[48:01] David on the shoulder and in the in the
[48:04] Middle East weddings you know they put
[48:05] the veil the woman on the shoulder to
[48:08] represent she is under his
[48:09] responsibility and when you got saved
[48:12] Jesus took full responsibility for you
[48:14] amen and he's gonna lead you but he'll
[48:17] lead you but then he'll let you be the
[48:19] one acting on it praise God because
[48:22] mother have said God will force you to
[48:23] do any decision it's got to be your
[48:25] decision amen
[48:27] hallelujah you've got to die to self you
[48:29] got to die to the flesh you have to die
[48:31] daily yet the Crucified the human will
[48:35] you've got to mortify the deeds of the
[48:37] flesh amen this must be done and God
[48:40] wants us to be an overcomer but he also
[48:43] says if you want to reign with me you
[48:45] have to suffer with me
[48:47] right so the Bible says if you want to
[48:50] reign with him
[48:51] you've got to suffer with him so that's
[48:53] why many of these seasons involves
[48:55] suffering it's a suffering to lose
[48:57] it's a suffering to be rejected right if
[49:00] somebody rejects you we'll get to this
[49:02] one it's going to be as hard it's hard
[49:04] with that one these are hard seasons of
[49:07] war it's hard seasons of rejection is
[49:11] difficult but it's it's molding our
[49:14] character so that we can reign with
[49:16] Christ amen
[49:17] Christ is not going to let anybody sit
[49:18] up there on his right hand and left
[49:20] member remember James and John's mom
[49:22] said can my son said retina and Jesus
[49:25] said that's not given I can't give that
[49:27] that's prepared of the Father amen so
[49:31] the father is watching which of his
[49:32] children are serving me which of my
[49:35] children are making decisions to serve
[49:38] me amen
[49:39] they're all going to be saved but which
[49:41] ones are dying daily amen
[49:43] which ones are choosing to walk in
[49:45] obedience to the word that they've heard
[49:47] amen hallelujah praise God thank the
[49:51] Lord and so we see we come to this
[49:53] season where it's keeping in the natural
[49:57] you keep money but then there's a season
[49:59] you want to cast it away and invest
[50:01] right so there's long term savings or
[50:04] there could be a season of of giving it
[50:07] away of investing praise the Lord and in
[50:12] the spiritual from what I can see by
[50:15] scripture without having you know a
[50:18] brother branham a full sermon of brother
[50:20] band just focusing on this stuff but
[50:22] from gleaning from the scripture and the
[50:24] quotes it seems like you have a season
[50:26] where you've got to keep your confession
[50:29] and then there's seasons where we may
[50:32] struggle like the lose one we may lose
[50:34] the joy we may cast away our confidence
[50:38] but see we've got to go through a season
[50:40] where we failed praise God
[50:43] so we so we know and we can relate to
[50:45] others who may fail and to encourage
[50:48] them and say you know I fell short to
[50:50] him and I kind of lost my confidence and
[50:53] I kind of made a mistake but I had
[50:55] another season where it came back amen
[50:58] see because we are we are ambassadors
[51:01] right the Bowers that we're ambassadors
[51:02] of the Ministry of reconciliation there
[51:05] it is right there amen
[51:07] God reconciling we thought we died you
[51:10] know we we backslide daily we know that
[51:12] sometimes we go through further you know
[51:13] more extreme backsliding me we'd say
[51:15] little more than just daily but we got
[51:18] to remember that God's in the business
[51:19] of reconciling us to himself amen praise
[51:23] God where we may seem like we're so far
[51:25] from God but God allows those little
[51:28] seasons and it's a law of contrast God
[51:31] allows that so next time we'll choose
[51:34] the right choice and we'll stay closer
[51:37] to God and we'll alone for God's
[51:39] anointing we're longing for his love
[51:41] luring in yeah if we're far from God
[51:46] we'll learn to hate that feeling and
[51:48] what would it be closer to God all the
[51:49] time
[51:50] amen that's right and these are seasons
[51:55] that Solomon observed and was led by the
[51:58] Holy Spirit to ride a bicycle let's look
[52:00] at 10:11 tonight by God's grace let me
[52:02] set my timer and let's look at these two
[52:06] these two seasons here now proverbs 21:5
[52:09] the thoughts of the diligent tend only
[52:11] to plenteous nests but of everyone that
[52:14] is hasty only to want now see this is
[52:18] keeping or saving so our thoughts church
[52:21] we got a member of thoughts are going to
[52:23] be going towards we have to be diligent
[52:26] thoughts of a diligent are tending only
[52:28] to plenteous nests so we got a we got to
[52:31] have an attitude of thinking the Lord is
[52:33] going to provide for us we said all the
[52:36] time but it's true Jehovah Jireh we've
[52:39] got to put we got a train of thoughts to
[52:41] go right to that he's Yahveh Jireh we
[52:44] got to say Lord this has happened before
[52:46] I've I've lost before but but I'm gonna
[52:51] keep thinking that you're gonna provide
[52:53] because you're Jehovah Jireh Amen this
[52:55] may be the season where where it's cast
[52:59] away right and I I can't keep like I
[53:01] ought to but my thoughts are gonna
[53:03] remain that my god has provided great
[53:05] things but see when we're hasty when
[53:09] we're impatient Oh
[53:11] we think about is that all we think
[53:13] about is what we don't have remember the
[53:16] Bible what the Bible say the Bible said
[53:18] contentment with our godliness with
[53:20] contentment is a great game and so we
[53:25] know that we've we've reached a great
[53:27] level of Christian character but
[53:29] honestly climbing up that ladder of the
[53:31] cetera man
[53:32] you've reached a great level of
[53:33] character godliness when you when you
[53:35] have godliness and you're content with
[53:37] the things that you have and it might
[53:40] take a couple prayer meetings for you to
[53:41] get there but you can get there praise
[53:43] God
[53:44] it might take a little crying might take
[53:47] a few little more push play on the
[53:49] sermon but God can get you there but you
[53:52] got to be willing to get there praise
[53:54] God see what we have in our society is
[53:57] kind of like a it's like a pity spirit
[54:00] you know everybody wants to be pitied
[54:01] it's a we call in sports like a losers
[54:05] mentality like the Cleveland Browns I'm
[54:08] not gonna watch their games but they
[54:10] just lose and lose and lose all the time
[54:12] and and they the city just gets in a
[54:15] mindset we're losers we expect to lose
[54:18] same it but the Bible says expect to
[54:21] gain amen expect God to minister and be
[54:26] Jehovah Jireh
[54:27] expect the new season to happen amen and
[54:30] I guess they got some good free agents
[54:32] this year but it's all it's all
[54:35] spiritually it's all about our thoughts
[54:38] remember because we create an atmosphere
[54:40] with our thinking praise God and if we
[54:44] create an atmosphere of Dow and Lawson
[54:48] and I'll never have anything then how is
[54:51] God's were never gonna break through to
[54:53] our hearts amen where we could have
[54:55] faith and rise above and overcome that
[54:57] temptation not see it's like everybody
[55:04] everybody thinks you know somebody owes
[55:07] them something you know we don't you
[55:09] know God doesn't owe us anything he's
[55:11] the Bible said he's already done
[55:12] everything he's freely given all things
[55:15] that pertain to life and godliness amen
[55:17] he's already the Bible says in 2nd Peter
[55:19] chapter 1 that he's already given us
[55:21] every blessing amen
[55:22] every spiritual blessing has given my
[55:25] promise and we just have to believe it
[55:27] and keep like he said keep believing
[55:29] keep watering the seed or keep nursing
[55:31] like else Shadia keep believing and
[55:34] every spiritual promise will be given to
[55:36] us amen
[55:37] I'm not saying I'm the master of this or
[55:39] you may be this person the master of it
[55:41] but we've got to have the attitude like
[55:44] God is going to bless us and God is
[55:46] going to provide
[55:47] we can't meditate on the wrong things
[55:49] we've got to meditate on the right
[55:50] things see it's a season of keep I
[55:54] believe God's going to bring me a season
[55:56] of of blessing and and he's going to
[55:59] give me the things that I have need of
[56:01] for myself and my family praise God
[56:05] father send for he become as poor that
[56:09] deals with a slack hand but the hand of
[56:11] a diligent maketh rich he that gathered
[56:15] in summer as a wise son but he that
[56:17] sleeper than harvest is a son that
[56:19] causes shame so many times you see this
[56:21] with sinners or lazy Christians you know
[56:24] the reason they're struggling is because
[56:26] of their own effort right there they're
[56:29] not working like they ought to be and so
[56:32] there is a law or season of that that
[56:34] people can bring upon themselves you
[56:37] know we had some young people in our
[56:38] church a few years ago and and what we
[56:40] observed by watching some of them is the
[56:43] reason they couldn't get ahead is
[56:44] because they didn't work hard but church
[56:48] if you work hard God promises I bless
[56:50] you praise God amen
[56:52] some of these are brought upon ourselves
[56:55] and we got to make sure that we're being
[56:58] diligent we're thinking diligent
[57:00] thoughts God's going to provide God's
[57:01] going to provide but then doing all that
[57:04] we can do praise God so wisdom so there
[57:09] is there's a there's a season summer
[57:11] right so either gather than a season a
[57:13] summer is a wise son hallelujah so
[57:17] keeping or saving in the natural now
[57:19] here's a casting away in the natural and
[57:23] maybe you've gone through this lately
[57:26] I'll be honest I've been going through
[57:28] this a little bit lately
[57:30] queeny's 11:1 cast thy bread upon the
[57:33] waters for thou shalt find it after many
[57:35] days so see you may not have a lot of
[57:40] bread you know in those days bread
[57:43] wasn't very abundant you had to bake it
[57:45] daily that's why Jesus brought daily
[57:47] bread into prayer you know you had to
[57:50] bake it every day
[57:51] give us this day our daily bread and so
[57:54] here he's saying cast your bread upon
[57:56] the waters you know you're gonna lose
[57:58] here for little C's you're gonna cast it
[58:00] away but he promises that it will return
[58:04] after a few seconds one day
[58:09] what's the turnover gonna be many days
[58:13] ii of I mean I love when God does that
[58:17] we love when God does that one time I
[58:19] just heard a sermon I was I was studying
[58:21] a sermon I preached in the past to write
[58:23] the current book I'm on and I and I
[58:26] remember this testimony I tried to give
[58:28] somebody a certain hundred number a
[58:30] hundred couple dollars and they wouldn't
[58:32] take it I'm like come on I feel like the
[58:35] Lord to give me this and they wouldn't
[58:37] take it and the next day in the mail I
[58:39] got a check for that same amount and
[58:42] that proved to me like God was in that I
[58:45] was trying to help them out but because
[58:47] they wouldn't take it
[58:48] god bless me anyway you know people say
[58:52] you know don't rob me my blessing or
[58:54] something like that and that's true I
[58:55] mean we want to give everybody a chance
[58:57] to give right Paul said that I want to
[58:59] give you a chance to start fruit to your
[59:00] account in heaven but we also got to be
[59:03] humble enough to receive if it's a
[59:04] season to receive but that's one time I
[59:08] seen it where it came back after just
[59:10] one day but the Bible says here with a
[59:14] natural investing in mind you cast away
[59:16] you might not have a lot of savings but
[59:18] if you invest some the Bible said I'll
[59:20] come back many days after enough for
[59:24] what brother Brandon my brother Ram
[59:26] applies this to your words program
[59:28] always applies the scripture I think
[59:30] there's four quotes on it
[59:31] he always applies this to casting out
[59:33] good words about people he said if you
[59:36] or somebody say something good about you
[59:37] you say something good about somebody
[59:38] else they'll say something good about
[59:40] you cash your run upon the water it will
[59:42] return
[59:42] you as the brother said in Canada the
[59:44] other day said yes brother branham
[59:45] Buttered so that's about right you see
[59:48] if you're just gassing upon the water
[59:49] it'll return buttered that's the way so
[59:52] it comes back so you do unto others as
[59:54] you'd have them doing to use that's a
[59:55] good thing to live by no we had that
[1:00:00] this year you know financially our tax
[1:00:02] return was was way higher than it's ever
[1:00:04] been this is the highest one we've ever
[1:00:05] had for years I poured into you know
[1:00:07] paying tithes and offerings ever since I
[1:00:09] became a message believer now I've never
[1:00:11] missed one as far as I know and there
[1:00:13] would be years where my tax return I had
[1:00:15] to pay in you know and but it was neat
[1:00:17] to see it returned after many days amen
[1:00:20] but then all my expenses came up and had
[1:00:22] to pay off are all these other expenses
[1:00:24] but I said thank the Lord again because
[1:00:27] it does return amen it will return it's
[1:00:30] based upon seasons boy just as sure as
[1:00:33] that moon is going to get brighter right
[1:00:35] now it's dark but just as soon as it's
[1:00:37] going to get brighter each day first
[1:00:39] you'll get your days will get brighter
[1:00:40] Amen your see your bright seasons will
[1:00:44] return early man it's it's the Word of
[1:00:46] God it's written in nature it's written
[1:00:48] in the world
[1:00:49] it's written in our hearts it's written
[1:00:50] in heaven highly God's Way will not
[1:00:53] return Lord amen
[1:00:54] the light will return hallelujah see
[1:01:00] Cacharel on the water it'll return you
[1:01:01] someday so the right seed you'll reap
[1:01:03] the right crop if you sell the wrong
[1:01:05] scene you'll reap the wrong things you
[1:01:06] can't go east and west at the same time
[1:01:08] you either going one way or the other
[1:01:09] you're either pointed towards God this
[1:01:11] morning with all you've got looking to
[1:01:12] him or you're pulling the other way you
[1:01:14] think sometimes you're going right when
[1:01:16] you're going wrong but you can't go to
[1:01:18] the right and left at the same time he
[1:01:20] said if you're headed left you're going
[1:01:22] left and you'll come out left if you're
[1:01:24] headed right you'll come out right
[1:01:25] you'll keep right I'm sorry you can't
[1:01:28] keep from coming right it may seem like
[1:01:30] you're going wrong but you're going
[1:01:32] right follow the compass and the compass
[1:01:36] is the Holy Spirit this word he said now
[1:01:40] this is another quote and there'll be
[1:01:42] many many there that we didn't even
[1:01:44] think would be there speaking of heaven
[1:01:46] for you know it's at that time that I
[1:01:48] believe that the bread that we've cast
[1:01:50] upon the human troubled waters will
[1:01:53] return to us on that day when we see
[1:01:55] the effects of our testimony on people
[1:01:58] that we didn't understand their actions
[1:01:59] sort it will probably be there what a
[1:02:02] day that will be now that's what I'm
[1:02:06] hoping I'm trusting that as well for us
[1:02:08] search it'll be foolish virgin unless
[1:02:11] somebody heard our testimony and then
[1:02:14] they moved away and got saved and got
[1:02:15] filled with the Holy Ghost right that
[1:02:18] that could happen but for many like
[1:02:21] Abraham and lot like the Bible says
[1:02:22] that's the time we're living in
[1:02:24] Abraham's trying to call out lot the
[1:02:26] bride is just trying to get more foolish
[1:02:28] virgins say - now we know there's a
[1:02:31] group that needs to be filled with the
[1:02:32] holy ghost in the bride as well but just
[1:02:34] as Abraham's ministry was the same his
[1:02:37] family so are we trying to save the rest
[1:02:39] of the family of God and we know you
[1:02:42] know I know the church age go to or the
[1:02:43] first version or not you know truly that
[1:02:45] your God we know that because they're
[1:02:47] not born again they don't have the full
[1:02:49] status of sons and daughters they don't
[1:02:51] inherit rewards but they inherit life I
[1:02:53] know that too but remember jesus said
[1:02:55] blessed are you and come and inherit the
[1:02:58] kingdom prepared from the foundation of
[1:02:59] the world he said that the fish virgins
[1:03:02] in Matthew 25 now the effects of your
[1:03:05] testimony Church that's why you can't
[1:03:07] that's why I put your testimony
[1:03:08] everywhere you can put it on Facebook
[1:03:11] text it to your friends that don't
[1:03:12] believe send them a nice text sent them
[1:03:14] a letter
[1:03:15] put your testimony because you don't
[1:03:16] know the effects of your testimony
[1:03:19] it's like casting bread upon the water
[1:03:22] that's why I had to put that testimony
[1:03:24] on Facebook last night I've been kind of
[1:03:26] frustrated with Facebook lately you know
[1:03:28] but I still put it on there because I
[1:03:29] told brother Brian I said I wanted to
[1:03:31] encourage the faith of those people who
[1:03:34] are sick but it also has to be a witness
[1:03:36] against those who don't believe in
[1:03:37] divine healing and it may go and that
[1:03:41] testimony may have more effects and they
[1:03:43] say my if a little Church like brother
[1:03:45] Jesse's going to have a healing that our
[1:03:47] church can have it it may raise somebody
[1:03:50] else's bride he's 42 if a 42 of your man
[1:03:53] can be healed I'm 35 or I'm 36 or some
[1:03:55] at 42 year old can be healed I can be
[1:03:58] healed - amen he said it brings forth
[1:04:02] pleasant fruits and we'll see them on
[1:04:05] that day the wayward loved ones and
[1:04:07] relatives
[1:04:08] the wayward loved ones and relatives
[1:04:11] praise God
[1:04:12] now here's another about giving to the
[1:04:14] poor casting it away there's times and
[1:04:16] got to give it to the poor he have to he
[1:04:19] hath dispersed he that give it to the
[1:04:21] poor his righteousness in North forever
[1:04:25] church you know this right now the Bible
[1:04:28] said the breastplate of righteousness
[1:04:28] right you know you've got the full armor
[1:04:31] of God on when you're given to the poor
[1:04:33] well at least you got the breastplate on
[1:04:34] you probably got the word do but the
[1:04:38] Bible said a man that gives to poor
[1:04:40] people he's already got righteousness
[1:04:43] his righteousness endureth forever it is
[1:04:46] a righteous anointing in your life amen
[1:04:49] it's evidence of your righteous
[1:04:51] character you're doing what's right and
[1:04:54] that was in the Old Testament what about
[1:04:56] the new Amen well it's part of your
[1:04:58] armor the breastplate of righteous what
[1:05:01] does the wonders of breastplate protect
[1:05:03] your heart amen
[1:05:06] so what protects your heart
[1:05:08] righteousness amen when you do the life
[1:05:11] things it protects your heart you feel
[1:05:14] like you're saying Amen right you feel
[1:05:17] saying your heart in your heart you know
[1:05:19] I'm a child of God because the
[1:05:22] breastplate of righteousness for texts
[1:05:23] all Satan's attacks to touch your heart
[1:05:26] to make you feel like you don't belong
[1:05:28] and you're not a child of God that's why
[1:05:30] we got to do righteous things and ever
[1:05:31] feel like the righteous Amen that's
[1:05:35] right
[1:05:36] amen see it says it's the type all those
[1:05:40] armor pieces are types right when you
[1:05:43] put on the feet by minutes it when you
[1:05:45] put on the feet shot it means you're
[1:05:47] physically ready or spiritually ready to
[1:05:49] walk in any path of God in the nacho I
[1:05:53] can drive over there and help that
[1:05:55] person out I can go across the street
[1:05:56] and be a witness to my neighbor like
[1:05:58] last night I can do those things because
[1:06:01] my feet already but see that also means
[1:06:04] your feet are protected your spiritual
[1:06:07] path is protected hallelujah and so see
[1:06:12] your
[1:06:12] your feelings your emotions toward God
[1:06:14] they're protected when you're doing the
[1:06:17] righteous acts of God that's right now
[1:06:22] here we got to recognize opportunities
[1:06:23] let us not be weary in well-doing for in
[1:06:25] due season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:06:28] and as we have therefore opportunity so
[1:06:31] we got a church we got to look for
[1:06:32] opportunities and usually you know
[1:06:35] surprise you you know but but God will
[1:06:37] that God will show you when it's your
[1:06:38] opportunity to do something good you'll
[1:06:41] feel it you'll you'll say well it's
[1:06:42] opportunity I have it to give and I've
[1:06:45] been asked to give or I feel led to give
[1:06:47] but I'm at a hard season do I keep it or
[1:06:50] cast it away and the church said I don't
[1:06:56] get a whole lot of real shout on that
[1:06:57] one but because we're a battle of this
[1:07:00] flesh man amen
[1:07:01] but as we have therefore opportunity let
[1:07:03] us do good unto all men especially unto
[1:07:06] them who are of the household of faith
[1:07:10] so you got to recognize all this God
[1:07:12] wants you to do is recognize
[1:07:13] opportunities right now here's spiritual
[1:07:18] now here's where we just like we lose
[1:07:20] the joy here's where we cast away our
[1:07:23] confidence instead of keeping it brother
[1:07:25] and sister sometimes we go through a
[1:07:27] season where we just cast it away and
[1:07:30] the Bible says here that impatience is
[1:07:33] casting away confidence so you basically
[1:07:35] give up and you're no longer stead
[1:07:37] because patience means steadfastness
[1:07:38] you're no longer steadfast God's gonna
[1:07:40] answer I know it raised God God's not
[1:07:43] gonna fail me hallelujah he I'm patient
[1:07:45] he's gonna answer so that the opposite
[1:07:48] of that is casting it away Oh
[1:07:51] God's never gonna hear me I'm fending
[1:07:53] for myself I must upset God God's mad at
[1:07:56] me the Bible said cast not away
[1:08:01] therefore your confidence well I would
[1:08:06] Paul write this if Christians in a
[1:08:08] battle casting it away right he's
[1:08:11] writing Holy Ghost for Christians right
[1:08:13] the Hebrew Christians he's tell about
[1:08:15] Mel Kazik he's some about the promised
[1:08:18] land and the sword of the word you know
[1:08:20] discerning thoughts intentions are but
[1:08:22] he's got to inject this thought in here
[1:08:24] do not cast away
[1:08:26] confidence because every believer
[1:08:28] sometimes cast it away they go through a
[1:08:30] season where they doubt what God said
[1:08:35] that's not therefore we remember them
[1:08:38] racked up that $10,000 bill remember
[1:08:40] when he was in his evangelistic ministry
[1:08:43] and what'd he do he said I'm done but
[1:08:45] his his son Billy Paul and his wife his
[1:08:48] wife kind of had to have a I'm not gonna
[1:08:49] go there but his wife kind of had to
[1:08:51] help him to get back on the field he
[1:08:54] almost quit C because he was cast away
[1:08:57] his conference and church I just
[1:08:58] listened to a sermon this week where me
[1:09:01] too
[1:09:01] kept brother branham from quitting the
[1:09:03] field a second time I've heard one
[1:09:06] already now I heard a second time
[1:09:07] brother branham said I was about ready
[1:09:09] to quit I think it was in my new
[1:09:11] ministry program was talking about that
[1:09:13] and me too had to come up and say oh
[1:09:16] yeah there was but they have said I'm 50
[1:09:19] years old I have I feel like I haven't
[1:09:21] done anything for God and both man said
[1:09:23] his wife kind of rebuked him and he said
[1:09:25] he liked it a little bit she said don't
[1:09:28] you know all that you've done and don't
[1:09:30] doubt it you know God God used Moses at
[1:09:33] 80 God use Abraham 75 his wife had to
[1:09:39] encourage him see brother Ram was going
[1:09:42] to cut he was almost casting away
[1:09:44] confidence I've done nothing for God but
[1:09:47] church listen if you cast your to put
[1:09:49] your testimony out there if you go try
[1:09:52] to invite people to church if you tried
[1:09:54] to share about divine healing and
[1:09:56] miracles if you've done that you've cast
[1:09:58] the bread upon the water a man it will
[1:10:01] return it to you it does have effects
[1:10:03] you may not see it but don't cast away
[1:10:05] your confidence keep your confidence
[1:10:07] Amen hallelujah I'll be honest I went to
[1:10:12] that recently as far as with miracles
[1:10:14] and God knows my heart I've never said
[1:10:15] this before but at that one day I went
[1:10:17] and prayed for him that first grader my
[1:10:19] class had cancer I fasted all day and I
[1:10:22] preached twice in song led I think one
[1:10:24] of the times to and I was in my prayer
[1:10:26] cause of that morning I fasted all day
[1:10:28] and I took a prayer cloth of Brooklands
[1:10:30] and I prayed and and I didn't see a
[1:10:32] immediate miracle and I went through
[1:10:34] this I really battled this for a couple
[1:10:36] months there I was wondering am I ever
[1:10:38] going to see any miracles again
[1:10:40] it was a hard it was a hard season it
[1:10:44] was one of the hardest seasons this is
[1:10:45] these last few months and that's why I
[1:10:48] thank God for the anointing cuz when I
[1:10:49] get up here you probably don't see it I
[1:10:51] thank the Lord for that ask God to
[1:10:52] forgive me right but I go through
[1:10:55] seasons where it's like God are you ever
[1:10:57] gonna do any miracles again and have I
[1:11:00] failed you I'm checking my life god I
[1:11:02] know I fasted and pray and I know I know
[1:11:06] I cry out to God I spoke to them of that
[1:11:07] cancer I spoke to the cancer all these
[1:11:09] things and we started we started going
[1:11:11] through seasons where we we cast away
[1:11:13] our confidence but look if we just stay
[1:11:17] in the saddle Amen if we just stay at
[1:11:19] the post of duty God will do miracles
[1:11:21] again we've seen two miracles in the
[1:11:25] last three weeks
[1:11:26] that woman's eyesight got healed at Camp
[1:11:28] Search and God just here brother Brian
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:31] it's DS ins amen and I go through these
[1:11:35] two weary castle where my confidence I
[1:11:37] think I'm just a failure
[1:11:39] I'm no good wife I don't even preach am
[1:11:41] I even called to preach should I ever
[1:11:43] pray for a sick person again and we go
[1:11:45] through these seasons but the Bible said
[1:11:47] keep it don't cast it away hold on your
[1:11:49] confidence the Bible said you have need
[1:11:52] of patience that have you done the will
[1:11:53] of God you'll receive the promise what
[1:11:57] was God showed me I need some more
[1:11:58] patience thank you lord
[1:12:01] thank the Lord I do need it Church you
[1:12:03] need it I need it who doesn't need more
[1:12:06] patience that was when was that man that
[1:12:10] was January I think I wasn't prayed for
[1:12:12] him I don't think we saw America until
[1:12:14] last month June or May know it's early
[1:12:17] this month no it was SECAM invited me
[1:12:20] the first week of July no so we have to
[1:12:22] do miracles this month so we had I
[1:12:24] prayed in January February March April
[1:12:27] May so six months six months I'm
[1:12:29] struggling and Church I had a brother at
[1:12:33] Columbus I don't think I've shared this
[1:12:34] before maybe I have but the last time I
[1:12:36] preached in Columbus it was on an Easter
[1:12:38] Sunday and after the service we went up
[1:12:41] to the park for fellowship and his
[1:12:42] brother's name was Israel and he comes
[1:12:44] up and he's shaking he's just shaking
[1:12:45] I'm like well what's wrong sir he's way
[1:12:48] taller than me though I'm like what's
[1:12:49] wrong and he said he said I have to tell
[1:12:51] you something I said okay go on tell me
[1:12:53] the Lord he said while you were
[1:12:55] preaching he said the voice of God came
[1:12:58] to me and said I'm gonna use him for
[1:12:59] miracles and he said no no no he was
[1:13:02] talking about me he said that's not the
[1:13:03] voice of God he said it came stronger
[1:13:05] I'm gonna use him for miracles he said
[1:13:07] no no no that's not God he said the last
[1:13:09] time I was you're getting under the
[1:13:10] spirit and he just had to he just had to
[1:13:12] say that's God so he came up after he
[1:13:15] said he's I'm here to tell you God's
[1:13:17] gonna use you for miracles now we just
[1:13:20] seen - amen
[1:13:23] I'd like to do more we like to see more
[1:13:25] if it's God's will I got to make sure I
[1:13:27] say that if it's God's will
[1:13:29] because it's not it's not me it's not my
[1:13:31] word that God ever uses anybody for
[1:13:34] anything it's God just borrowing them
[1:13:36] like a microphone amen the microphone is
[1:13:39] no voice but gets God's voice speaking
[1:13:41] through the microphone amen
[1:13:43] and so that was what quite a few years
[1:13:45] ago now that was probably 2013 or 2014
[1:13:48] and so see I battled this you know from
[1:13:50] time to time I'm just trusting now that
[1:13:53] God will give me victory to keep my
[1:13:55] confidence amen the be paid she like
[1:13:58] mother have said and church is so hard
[1:14:00] for you and I but it's so hard for me
[1:14:02] but believes that if I pray for a
[1:14:04] hundred people tonight and they all die
[1:14:06] I pray for a hundred tomorrow I don't
[1:14:08] know if I'd have the patience right now
[1:14:10] to do that but I'd say after today on my
[1:14:15] last night but you see how that could be
[1:14:20] so I just prayed for one I didn't see
[1:14:22] America when I get called down the
[1:14:23] dumpster do I quit or what Oh God have
[1:14:28] mercy on me be patient with me but see
[1:14:31] it's times and seasons God's taking us
[1:14:33] through these things to build up our
[1:14:35] faith to help us a shine Rider amen to
[1:14:39] come to the fore leg but in said the
[1:14:42] false light amen before moon the full
[1:14:44] manifestation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:14:47] bride amen so what do we have need of
[1:14:51] what does brother Jesse have need of
[1:14:52] patience now you could anybody during
[1:14:56] this whole time anybody could have went
[1:14:57] off out up to my wife and maybe said in
[1:15:00] private now she probably I would have
[1:15:01] said it but does your husband ever need
[1:15:04] patience and she probably said yeah
[1:15:05] now you were to do that but but if
[1:15:08] anybody knows I need patience it's mrs.
[1:15:11] Smith over there but you know he's not
[1:15:14] projected I tried out you know hiding my
[1:15:16] battles you don't just try to get out of
[1:15:18] the anointing so your needs can be met
[1:15:19] it's not about me my needs being met
[1:15:22] when I'm up here it's about your needs
[1:15:23] being met my gift not for myself it's
[1:15:26] for you
[1:15:28] and so see it's it's it's this idea of
[1:15:32] spiritually casting away when we start
[1:15:34] doubting or feel like it's not gonna
[1:15:38] happen
[1:15:39] but the Bible said do not cast it away
[1:15:41] you're gonna be tempted in that season
[1:15:44] to cast it away but believe hang on to
[1:15:47] God's word believe God's Word see cuz
[1:15:51] after you hang on
[1:15:52] if you hang on you'll receive the
[1:15:53] promise Corey now what is this word mean
[1:15:58] here the confidence it means boldness
[1:16:00] and it's basically you know bonus so
[1:16:02] yeah confidence is bonus but think about
[1:16:07] the loans last time you just had bold
[1:16:09] confidence to believe God was gonna
[1:16:11] answer prayer or boldness the witness of
[1:16:14] somebody or boldness to pray for a sick
[1:16:17] person or bonus to go try to win your
[1:16:20] lovin to Christ that's what the Bible
[1:16:22] said don't cast away your boldness
[1:16:25] it's another synonym acidnam for now and
[1:16:31] this is what Paul after Paul preaches on
[1:16:33] the full armor of God we've been looking
[1:16:34] at that a little bit tonight just
[1:16:35] mentioning a bit the Bible said that a
[1:16:37] fully armored Christian is praying
[1:16:39] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:16:41] in the spirit and watching thereunto
[1:16:44] with all perseverance and supplication
[1:16:46] for All Saints and for me so he says
[1:16:50] pray for me you fully armoured
[1:16:51] Christians that utterance may be given
[1:16:55] unto me that I may open my mouth with
[1:16:57] confidence a man who had seen miracles
[1:17:03] right a man that had raised that boy
[1:17:07] from the dead puck was a publius of his
[1:17:09] name he raised that young man from the
[1:17:11] dead after preaching all night he raised
[1:17:12] a man that had raised somebody from the
[1:17:14] dead said pray for me Church so I can be
[1:17:16] more bold
[1:17:19] that I'll have more confidence in God
[1:17:20] that when I witness I'll be more
[1:17:23] confident now how many can relate to
[1:17:25] Paul a lot more I can I'll be on top of
[1:17:28] cloud nine after miracles give it a few
[1:17:31] weeks in a few battles that I'll be like
[1:17:32] what I even called of God or not should
[1:17:34] I sit down or what
[1:17:37] now card you wanna pass through the
[1:17:39] church no just my matters you know he
[1:17:45] said that I may open my mouth boldly to
[1:17:47] make known the mystery of the gospel for
[1:17:50] which I'm in boss ambassador in bonds
[1:17:52] that then I may speak boldly as I ought
[1:17:55] to this proves he wasn't speaking as he
[1:17:58] ought to it sometimes so he said pray
[1:18:01] for me brother raise it pray for me
[1:18:03] but they aren't pray for me that I'll be
[1:18:04] bold like I ought to be bold he see cuz
[1:18:08] they're seasons I cast away my boldness
[1:18:11] right because I'm frustrated I'm
[1:18:13] discouraged I'm depressed I'm defeated
[1:18:16] so sometimes I cast away my confidence
[1:18:18] but the Bible said keep your confidence
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:22] now this is beautiful right here though
[1:18:24] how is he gonna do it we need the
[1:18:26] prayers of the Saints Church if you need
[1:18:29] prayer come up here tonight if you need
[1:18:32] prayer at the end of the service don't
[1:18:35] sit back yes it isn't just like us we
[1:18:37] think we can we can we can do it I don't
[1:18:39] need your prayers I'm strong enough I
[1:18:41] can do it by myself and here's the first
[1:18:43] church age mess and you're saying yeah
[1:18:48] and he wasn't just a regular he was a
[1:18:51] fire he was a fireball in the hand of
[1:18:53] Christ a star in the hand of Christ
[1:18:55] which which brother have said where all
[1:18:57] of our lives are depicted there in that
[1:18:59] example we should all look and say my we
[1:19:02] need to be on fire like Paul we need be
[1:19:04] on fire like brother branham right so
[1:19:08] don't be ashamed if you're just lacking
[1:19:10] boldness you know that you don't tell me
[1:19:14] you're able to tell me or whoever the
[1:19:15] guests preach you have to tell him just
[1:19:17] say pray for me and just watch the Holy
[1:19:19] Spirit pray for you watch the Holy
[1:19:22] Spirit pray for you if a church age
[1:19:26] messenger who had more revelation than
[1:19:28] any of us so much so God had to put
[1:19:31] you know troubles in his eyes and you
[1:19:33] had to pack a doctor with them around
[1:19:36] all the time Luke I believe in divine
[1:19:39] healing doc can you put some more drops
[1:19:41] in my eye plea thank you sir
[1:19:43] all right let's preach now if a man like
[1:19:48] that could humble himself and say please
[1:19:50] pray for my bonus church let's humble
[1:19:52] ourselves - you know why cuz it's a time
[1:19:55] in season when I don't need those eye
[1:19:58] drops when he didn't need those eye
[1:19:59] drops he was brought preaching just as
[1:20:01] hard but when he he needed them you know
[1:20:02] and he needed a little bit he probably
[1:20:04] said preaching he's doing the best he
[1:20:06] can and he just knew I just I just got
[1:20:09] to get through this season amen I just
[1:20:11] got to endure a little bit longer and
[1:20:13] God's gonna bring me out praise God
[1:20:18] Hebrews 3 5 and 6 and Moses verily was
[1:20:21] faithful in all's house as a servant for
[1:20:24] a testimony of those things which were
[1:20:25] to be spoken after but Christ has a son
[1:20:28] over his own house
[1:20:29] whose house we are if see Judas is not
[1:20:33] gonna be part of the house of God
[1:20:34] because he did not hold vast the
[1:20:36] confidence but we have said he was
[1:20:38] generally justified genuinely sanctified
[1:20:40] but he also lit all out for money he
[1:20:45] said if we hold fast the confidence and
[1:20:47] the rejoicing of the hope firm
[1:20:49] unto the end amen were the house of God
[1:20:54] were the body of Jesus Christ if we just
[1:20:56] keep our boldness in confidence
[1:20:58] amen how do you learn other words but in
[1:21:02] William I believe I'm going to be in the
[1:21:04] rapture amen don't worry I got
[1:21:05] congressmen here that I'll be at the
[1:21:07] marriage supper of the Lamb we've got to
[1:21:10] keep that Amen we got to keep that
[1:21:12] confidence that we like it's a pray for
[1:21:14] me brother just pray for me sister
[1:21:16] so-and-so pray for me that I won't lose
[1:21:18] my confidence if you lose it for a
[1:21:22] little while don't we discourage you're
[1:21:23] not lost going to hell you're just going
[1:21:24] through a season to show you your
[1:21:27] weaknesses so that God can make you
[1:21:29] stronger because remember when Joe went
[1:21:32] forth through the fire he said I'll come
[1:21:33] forth as gold right amen
[1:21:36] later in the same chapter he repeats it
[1:21:39] take heed brethren lest there be in any
[1:21:40] of you an evil heart of unbelief in
[1:21:42] departing from the Living God
[1:21:45] but exhort one another daily while it is
[1:21:48] called today lest any of you be hardened
[1:21:50] through the deceitfulness of sin for we
[1:21:53] are made partakers of Christ if we hold
[1:21:56] the beginning of our confidence
[1:21:57] steadfast to the end amen
[1:21:59] to think of initially when you first
[1:22:01] receive that bonus or you first had
[1:22:04] confidence and any promise of God you've
[1:22:06] got to keep that confidence to the end
[1:22:07] and the church said praise God that's
[1:22:12] why it's good we go over these things
[1:22:13] see how this is the ordained of God see
[1:22:14] how this is the Holy Spirit here sees
[1:22:16] like bitterness and the Holy Spirit will
[1:22:18] rightly divide all the Word of God it
[1:22:21] can all be rightly divided if it's taken
[1:22:23] with prayer brother Graham said and
[1:22:25] meditated and rightly divided and
[1:22:27] examined and searched the Scriptures it
[1:22:29] can all be rightly divided but it's got
[1:22:31] to be done by the Holy Spirit seen next
[1:22:38] chapter seeing them that we have a great
[1:22:40] high priest that is passed in the
[1:22:41] heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold
[1:22:43] fast our profession that literally means
[1:22:45] your confession my brother man said he's
[1:22:47] the high priest of your profession for
[1:22:50] we have not an High Priest which cannot
[1:22:51] be touched with the feeling of our
[1:22:53] infirmities but was in all points
[1:22:54] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:22:57] so Jesus was tempted to kind of throw
[1:22:59] away his confidence he was tempted but
[1:23:02] he never gave in right he held his
[1:23:05] profession praise God let us therefore
[1:23:08] come boldly on the throne again that's
[1:23:10] my church even if we don't feel like it
[1:23:11] we've got to get bold when we pray now
[1:23:14] there's times you know like hand out to
[1:23:16] cry out you know and I look like you're
[1:23:18] drunk you know home crying and weeping
[1:23:19] but but the Bible said keep your covers
[1:23:22] hold fast your profession other words
[1:23:24] God I'm a blood bought Holy Ghost field
[1:23:27] say I'm a son of God Amen hallelujah and
[1:23:30] you're my father and I come to you by
[1:23:32] the blood of Christ in the name of Jesus
[1:23:34] I come boldly to the throne of grace
[1:23:36] that I may find mercy and help in the
[1:23:39] time of my need hold fast your
[1:23:44] profession hold fast your words don't
[1:23:48] cast it away but and I don't have quotes
[1:23:51] on here but brother I talk about this
[1:23:52] all the time people would come on the
[1:23:54] prayer line on the right hand side and
[1:23:56] get healed and they'd walk out
[1:23:58] and the disease would come back a few
[1:24:00] days later because under that anointing
[1:24:02] they could hold on to that confession
[1:24:04] well a prophet said I was healed praise
[1:24:06] God which that's glorious
[1:24:09] but the person has to believe in himself
[1:24:11] amen it's got to be more than just the
[1:24:14] faith of brother Branham and that's what
[1:24:16] he said he saw that many times he said
[1:24:18] they would walk out and then they would
[1:24:20] a few days later it would come back on
[1:24:21] the blindness or the epilepsy or
[1:24:23] whatever it was because they couldn't
[1:24:25] hold onto it they weren't professing it
[1:24:28] amen and so see we've got to make sure
[1:24:32] we keep our profession like the Bible
[1:24:35] says
[1:24:35] so Brougham saw this all the time yeah I
[1:24:41] can go faster this one here already
[1:24:45] already did my time but let me let me
[1:24:46] finish this I this was no shorter so let
[1:24:48] me go through the season here number
[1:24:50] eleven eleven season how many can say
[1:24:53] praise the Lord we can see the keeping
[1:24:56] in cast away can you see it in scripture
[1:24:57] clearly Hebrews lays that out
[1:25:00] try not to cast away your confidence
[1:25:02] because it's your profession that the
[1:25:04] high priest honors and that's when we go
[1:25:07] through seasons now let's go this one
[1:25:09] quickly here render so now in the
[1:25:13] opposite you either preserve clothes by
[1:25:15] sewing them or you dispose of them by
[1:25:19] renting them or ripping them right I
[1:25:21] give all seen up my wife and we do it
[1:25:23] when the socks wear out you rip them and
[1:25:25] use them for her rags my clothes always
[1:25:29] I keep my clothes as long as I can and
[1:25:31] finally I'll rip it yeah use it for
[1:25:34] something good to clean the windows or
[1:25:35] something like that and the opposite the
[1:25:38] Jews had a physical sign where if
[1:25:41] someone blaspheme door they're like
[1:25:43] jobber jovian blasting but if like like
[1:25:45] Caiaphas he run his garments you know
[1:25:48] when they thought Jesus blast him but he
[1:25:50] didn't but joy when he went through the
[1:25:52] suffering he lost his family he rent his
[1:25:54] clothes it was a sign of mourning so
[1:25:57] there's a natural season of that where
[1:26:01] they might run their clothes and then
[1:26:03] they have to fix it right or get a new
[1:26:05] garment now spiritually rend means to
[1:26:10] repent
[1:26:12] then so means to unite or join together
[1:26:16] and to me Church this is the season of
[1:26:20] the refilling of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:26:23] human spirit because I've said this
[1:26:24] before and everybody gave me a hearty
[1:26:26] Amen so I appreciate that but you cannot
[1:26:28] get sealed resealed in the Holy Ghost
[1:26:30] and then getting your soul cuz the Bible
[1:26:32] never says that you're sealed until the
[1:26:35] day of your Redemption so the time your
[1:26:37] body gets swallowed up your soul gets
[1:26:39] the the theophany on it if you die now
[1:26:43] you get the theophany but if you go on
[1:26:45] the rapture you get both the often and
[1:26:46] glorified body you get both amen but the
[1:26:50] Bible never says it's a refilling of the
[1:26:53] soul it's the refilling of the human
[1:26:55] spirit because the Bible said you
[1:26:56] renewed day by day if you but you gotta
[1:26:59] press in to get that right like we saw
[1:27:01] on Sunday night you take the kingdom of
[1:27:03] God not by laying back when you take it
[1:27:05] by force alright there you get you take
[1:27:08] confidence right you get confidence and
[1:27:09] you keep your confidence amen don't
[1:27:12] worry I'm gonna keep my revival today
[1:27:14] I'm gonna go get that word I'm gonna
[1:27:15] live that word today I'm gonna keep my
[1:27:17] revive I'm not gonna cast away my
[1:27:19] confidence glory now let's look at these
[1:27:23] thoughts eyes like I said I'll try to go
[1:27:24] this fast C natural sowing is done when
[1:27:29] the old peace is sewn on I'm sorry when
[1:27:32] the old peace is sewn on an old garment
[1:27:33] Jesus tells us this no man is foolish
[1:27:36] enough to sell a piece of new cloth on
[1:27:38] an old garment else the new piece that's
[1:27:41] filled it up taketh away from the old
[1:27:43] and the RET is made worse you don't put
[1:27:46] a nice new cloth on an old pair of jeans
[1:27:50] because it's just gonna make the rent
[1:27:52] worse it's not it's not gonna it's not
[1:27:54] gonna attach the way you want it to so
[1:27:57] you only sell an old piece of cloth on
[1:27:59] an old garment and you use new pieces to
[1:28:01] make a new garment right now barn says
[1:28:07] this and I'm just I'm not gonna read all
[1:28:09] this for times sake but barn says so
[1:28:13] Jesus is saying my new doctrines do not
[1:28:15] match with the old rights of the
[1:28:17] Pharisees because the Pharisees came up
[1:28:19] and said how come our disciples fast but
[1:28:21] yours don't and Jesus says you don't put
[1:28:24] old garment I'm sorry new
[1:28:26] our mitts on our new pieces on old
[1:28:28] garments in other words right you don't
[1:28:32] put you don't put the new message of the
[1:28:33] hour you don't build that upon the old
[1:28:35] denominational thinking Amen
[1:28:37] right that's what he's saying you can't
[1:28:41] start with a Pharisee foundation and
[1:28:43] build my doctrine on top of it because
[1:28:45] they're their doctrine is already it's
[1:28:47] man's interpretations its commandments
[1:28:50] of men and not the commandments of God
[1:28:52] so their foundation is already wrong so
[1:28:56] he says you can't take a new garment and
[1:28:58] put it with an old garment it's
[1:29:00] impossible see we only sew or unite all
[1:29:05] with old in the natural so we have to
[1:29:08] recognize there's a time to sew new with
[1:29:11] new right according to Jesus there's a
[1:29:15] season to unite new as new now here's
[1:29:19] natural the morning Jacob when he knew
[1:29:22] Joseph they thought he had died you know
[1:29:24] actually take him to Egypt sold to Egypt
[1:29:27] he run as clothes there's that's where
[1:29:29] natural closes like renting or mourning
[1:29:31] there's a season of mourning I like this
[1:29:35] one this is a good spiritual one now
[1:29:37] here's spiritual ready he said thus
[1:29:39] saith oh he said therefore also now say
[1:29:41] that the Lord turn he even to me with
[1:29:43] all your heart and with fasting with
[1:29:44] weeping with mourning see if they had to
[1:29:47] do that the Old Testament church don't
[1:29:48] you think we got to do that in the New
[1:29:49] Testament and rend your heart and not
[1:29:53] your garments and turn to the Lord your
[1:29:55] God for he's gracious and merciful slow
[1:29:58] to anger of great kindness and repent
[1:30:00] with him up eat praise God see when we
[1:30:05] run our hearts God is asking us to take
[1:30:07] whatever we had and rip it up amen
[1:30:10] right whether it's Netflix or whatever
[1:30:13] whatever temptation whether it's
[1:30:15] gambling and and trying to buy lottery
[1:30:19] tickets whatever you were investing in
[1:30:22] or meditating on or giving your time -
[1:30:24] you've got to rent that up and get
[1:30:26] totally rid of it and turn with all your
[1:30:29] heart to God that's real renting in the
[1:30:31] spiritual rip up any any evidence or any
[1:30:35] shred that I was ever involved that
[1:30:37] totally rented away now you've rent your
[1:30:39] heart
[1:30:40] and now you've turned to Lord your God
[1:30:42] and he's gracious merciful slow to anger
[1:30:45] a great kindness and he repents him of
[1:30:47] the evil that would have been brought
[1:30:48] upon you right ha ha oh my glory now
[1:30:52] spiritual sowing is commitment because
[1:30:55] the word put here means to sow and Jesus
[1:30:58] said them no man having put or sown his
[1:31:01] hands to the plow and looking back is
[1:31:03] fit for the kingdom of God see so God
[1:31:08] wants us to sow or unite are all of our
[1:31:11] efforts into doing his will and not to
[1:31:13] regret it and look back and say oh I
[1:31:15] wish I could go enjoy one more night of
[1:31:18] drunkenness one more sip if I could just
[1:31:21] have one more night of pleasure at the
[1:31:24] bar my so spiritual showing is full
[1:31:29] commitment without looking back and
[1:31:31] lusting for the things of the world
[1:31:34] here's another one teach me that way O
[1:31:37] Lord and I will walk in that truth unite
[1:31:39] my heart to fear and in other words let
[1:31:41] my heart be sewn to your heart in
[1:31:44] commitment amen that may be fully
[1:31:47] attached amen
[1:31:48] fully committed that's like the word
[1:31:50] cleave the word cleave means glue he
[1:31:53] said you leave your mother and father
[1:31:54] and you cleave to your your your Hut
[1:31:57] your your wife right so the same idea
[1:32:00] you get glued on you get sewed on you
[1:32:02] get connected to Jesus Christ amen
[1:32:05] unite my heart to fear your name this is
[1:32:09] a spiritual season now see rending and
[1:32:14] sowing are done simultaneously just like
[1:32:16] we saw in the spiritual you've got to
[1:32:18] die before you're born again these two
[1:32:20] seasons go very closely together because
[1:32:23] the next scripture after sowing Jesus
[1:32:25] goes to new wine and oil thank you Lord
[1:32:30] amen
[1:32:30] and no man putteth the new wine into old
[1:32:32] bottles else the new wine doth burst the
[1:32:36] bottle and the wine is spilled and the
[1:32:38] bottles will be marked but new wine must
[1:32:40] be put into new bottles
[1:32:43] you cannot put new wine or the Holy
[1:32:45] Ghost into an old dry stony heart
[1:32:50] a new heart first or justification oh
[1:32:54] boy
[1:32:56] job said behind my belly is as wine
[1:32:58] which has no vent it's ready to burst
[1:33:01] like new bottles the fermenting wine
[1:33:06] expands right a new skin will expand as
[1:33:10] the wine ferments but old dry skin it's
[1:33:13] already done expanding it can't move to
[1:33:16] the the moving of the holy spirit a
[1:33:18] church that's why is the longer we serve
[1:33:20] the Lord some of us who met here a while
[1:33:22] around the message the longer we serve
[1:33:24] the Lord we got to make sure our skins
[1:33:26] don't get dried out right we still got
[1:33:30] to be flexible a lot of times we see
[1:33:32] what's called the Solomon syndrome and I
[1:33:34] preach it all the time
[1:33:35] but people will start out on far more
[1:33:37] then they'll get cold on God
[1:33:38] they won't pray like they used to they
[1:33:40] won't repent like they used to they
[1:33:43] won't serve God like they used to and
[1:33:46] their hearts get really dry on God
[1:33:49] that's true but see when the person is
[1:33:53] born again yeah they may go through
[1:33:54] seasons where they cast away their
[1:33:55] confidence but God is going to help them
[1:33:57] expand as the wine expands ain't no way
[1:34:01] they'll go through a season where God's
[1:34:03] going to help me grow I've been in the
[1:34:05] message 20 years I've never seen this I
[1:34:06] mean this is 40 years I've never seen
[1:34:08] this God is helping you to grow to fall
[1:34:11] back in love with Jesus amen
[1:34:13] to expand to be able to change and
[1:34:16] rededicate your life and and grow closer
[1:34:18] to God you're able to be flexible with
[1:34:21] the Holy Spirit in other words the Holy
[1:34:24] Spirit can move you to live a closer
[1:34:26] life to Christ
[1:34:28] glory it's a season amen a season of
[1:34:32] renting up the old and sowing uniting
[1:34:35] your heart to serve God glory
[1:34:39] remember sowing and this one is the same
[1:34:42] idea according to Jesus now brother I
[1:34:45] said you can't put this revival on an
[1:34:46] old theology mix it up jesus said that
[1:34:48] in Saint Luke you can't put new wine in
[1:34:50] old bottles I also wonder what that
[1:34:52] statement was made why you can't put new
[1:34:53] wine in old bottles I come to find out I
[1:34:55] said look where we got a glass jug a
[1:34:57] bottle why couldn't I put one in those
[1:34:59] things they put new wine in it like we
[1:35:02] do right here
[1:35:04] here's our wine next time for communion
[1:35:06] we use glass right but he said I found
[1:35:10] out back in the days when Jesus was
[1:35:12] speaking of the bottles wasn't made of
[1:35:13] glass they didn't have the glassblowers
[1:35:15] in those days and there was made up of
[1:35:17] an animal skin and the animal skin have
[1:35:18] been tan and was sewed up or tied up and
[1:35:21] they put the wine the water the liquids
[1:35:23] in a skin bottle and then after the
[1:35:25] bottle becomes so old and so no wine and
[1:35:27] or anything it dried out the animal oil
[1:35:29] the skin left it and they got hard and
[1:35:31] stiff Church we don't want to be hard
[1:35:35] and stiff towards God praise the Lord
[1:35:39] hard we all know hard-hearted I'm not
[1:35:42] gonna help anybody out find an
[1:35:44] opportunity I'm not gonna help him out
[1:35:45] I'm looking out for myself that's a hard
[1:35:48] hard stony heart there right and I see
[1:35:52] what Jesus mean that if you put new wine
[1:35:54] unfermented wine into a bottle like that
[1:35:56] and that new one had life and it went to
[1:35:58] work and in fermented it would burst the
[1:36:00] bottle and that's the way you take the
[1:36:02] baptism the Holy Ghost and put it in an
[1:36:03] old dry formal cowhide it'll blow up as
[1:36:06] sure as the world you can't have it like
[1:36:08] that
[1:36:09] you try to take the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:12] Ghost as an old experience of some long
[1:36:14] drawn-out church experience it'll blow
[1:36:16] up as sure as the world but new line
[1:36:20] said Jesus goes in new bottles the new
[1:36:23] bottles has still the animal oil and the
[1:36:25] skins and it's flexible that's the way
[1:36:27] God Church must be for revival flexible
[1:36:30] so you got to be willing to change your
[1:36:33] normal routine and habits every morning
[1:36:36] I do this instead of this well you got
[1:36:38] to be willing to be flexible if you want
[1:36:40] revival every Friday night I do this or
[1:36:42] every Sunday night it you got to be
[1:36:44] flexible you got to be but you have to
[1:36:47] be able to be moved by the Holy Spirit
[1:36:48] amen you know you can put new wine which
[1:36:55] represents the word with the new old
[1:36:57] bottle and you'll read the word and it
[1:36:58] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:37:00] today forever that old bottle will go
[1:37:01] poof but no up I don't believe it
[1:37:04] Church we got to be careful that I don't
[1:37:06] believe God is gonna heal me I don't
[1:37:07] believe God's gonna answer my prayer God
[1:37:09] must've gave up on me I'd be careful not
[1:37:10] to blow up I just seen it like this too
[1:37:13] I had to be flexible on saronite when I
[1:37:15] prayed for that guy
[1:37:17] I took Lydia just Lydia and another girl
[1:37:20] we drove two hours to get there and we
[1:37:23] we left at two o'clock and I didn't get
[1:37:25] home till almost 12:30 a.m. and I was
[1:37:28] exhausted on Sunday but I still preached
[1:37:29] to sermons by God's grace but I had to
[1:37:32] be flexible in other words in years past
[1:37:34] I would never I hadn't a clue do to them
[1:37:36] in other words I had to be flexible to
[1:37:39] be able to administer to my daughter so
[1:37:41] she could go to the meeting and hear the
[1:37:42] preacher and have a good time but in
[1:37:45] being more flexible making sacrifice we
[1:37:47] got a greater reward ha ha ha Amen see
[1:37:50] that so I just I never thought about
[1:37:52] that so right now had to be flexible to
[1:37:54] make a sacrifice to take my daughter to
[1:37:56] a youth meeting tired worn out had to
[1:37:59] keep me awake while I drove home but
[1:38:00] then God heard the prayer of faith amen
[1:38:02] hallelujah Amen flexible like you've
[1:38:07] heard it I've heard it this week - I
[1:38:09] heard it where you know it's you've
[1:38:11] heard it heard it - if you want to get
[1:38:13] difference or results you got to do
[1:38:14] different things in other words we can't
[1:38:17] be down and discouraged all the time and
[1:38:19] expect a different result we've got a
[1:38:21] person in the kingdom of God we got to
[1:38:23] be flexible we've got a rent things up
[1:38:25] we got to get rid of things and just
[1:38:27] give ourselves wholeheartedly to God
[1:38:29] amen thank you lord
[1:38:31] he said the baptism the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:33] just as real today as everyone's proof I
[1:38:36] don't believe it
[1:38:37] and what do you do you spoil both bottle
[1:38:40] and wine can you imagine that church
[1:38:43] people's lives get spoiled because they
[1:38:46] won't be flexible to hold they get dry
[1:38:47] lives are spoiled and then the Holy
[1:38:50] Ghost that could have been poured on
[1:38:52] them that that a church service was
[1:38:54] spoiled because more people could have
[1:38:56] got the oil reminds me of that that that
[1:38:59] story with Elijah how he said he said
[1:39:01] get all the vessels because the oils
[1:39:04] poured out a pen I don't know you bring
[1:39:06] all the empty vessels while there's all
[1:39:09] your here praise God let's not let this
[1:39:11] go to waste amen let's not spoil this
[1:39:14] opportunity let's fill everybody that
[1:39:16] wants the Holy Ghost and you know Jesus
[1:39:18] going to fit everybody with the Holy
[1:39:20] Ghost that wants it before this rapture
[1:39:22] amen hallelujah amen
[1:39:26] but see many people like whose version
[1:39:28] they're gonna spoil all that
[1:39:30] one the opportunity to have all that
[1:39:32] wine but you and I don't let it spoil
[1:39:35] we can't let it spoil we've got to rend
[1:39:38] up anything that's getting in our way
[1:39:39] and we got a God say God you not my
[1:39:41] heart two more of the Holy Spirit amen
[1:39:45] ha ha he says you're you spoil wolf why
[1:39:49] didn't bottom line you're casting pearls
[1:39:51] before swine let's stand to our feet
[1:39:53] here your message is going to pieces and
[1:39:55] no one receives it I've just blown out
[1:39:56] up to us that's all there is to it but
[1:39:58] you get new bottles and put some new
[1:40:00] Holy Ghost wine in it and the world says
[1:40:02] it'll working alive in our hearts and it
[1:40:04] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:40:06] today and forever the line says I don't
[1:40:09] know the wine talks did you know that
[1:40:10] the wine talks oh it's that voice of God
[1:40:14] hallelujah
[1:40:15] he said the line says Jesus is the sea
[1:40:18] yes hey today forever amen that was the
[1:40:23] Y that was talking through us so that I
[1:40:24] said I rebuke the degeneration that was
[1:40:27] the wine talking the wine was talking
[1:40:32] through us amen
[1:40:33] the bottle says amen such as I brother
[1:40:40] Brian said amen and I believe it amen
[1:40:42] said Jesus Christ is wounded for our
[1:40:45] transgressions bruised for our
[1:40:46] iniquities with His stripes were healed
[1:40:48] just the same yesterday today forever
[1:40:49] the new bottle said amen it spreads out
[1:40:53] with new life both of them has kept and
[1:40:57] preserved so you can't put new wine into
[1:40:58] old bottles last quote on the day of
[1:41:00] Pentecost God had 120 brand-new
[1:41:03] Pentecostal bottles said it with their
[1:41:05] necks up oh is that how we ought to know
[1:41:07] each other's Amen now for us if we are
[1:41:10] together so we're saying God refilled my
[1:41:12] human spirit
[1:41:13] oh we just gotta have our next up next
[1:41:15] of our human spirit he said they all got
[1:41:18] their next up and when the Holy Spirit
[1:41:20] fell from heaven it filled those bottles
[1:41:22] and they all bounced all over the place
[1:41:24] preaching the gospel to be no world the
[1:41:27] clear that Jesus Christ was the same
[1:41:29] yesterday today and forever notice it
[1:41:31] I see they bounce around the world we
[1:41:33] just got to bounce around acronym
[1:41:35] Mansfield Church I know that guys
[1:41:38] bouncing around from one place to the
[1:41:40] next
[1:41:40] witness in and Brian and singing in
[1:41:43] pounding drums praise God haha hey man
[1:41:48] that's right Church that's right we got
[1:41:50] a bounce from one person it's because
[1:41:52] we're all filled up with new wine amen
[1:41:54] hallelujah well can I come to the here's
[1:41:58] the twelfth now we'll get to the twelfth
[1:42:00] next time not today I'm stopping now
[1:42:02] looks I can have some voice tomorrow
[1:42:05] 12:00 is to keep silent and then there's
[1:42:08] a time to speak that's gonna be a good
[1:42:10] one
[1:42:10] because we just talked about that with
[1:42:12] brother Branham speaking the word
[1:42:14] brother Branham said I never spoke those
[1:42:16] squirrels he said God spoke through me
[1:42:18] to speak those squirrels he didn't even
[1:42:20] take credit I've got closer brother
[1:42:22] Branham said he said I'm not the voice
[1:42:23] of God but RAM said any time a person is
[1:42:26] here he said it's not my voice it's his
[1:42:27] voice and today they're worshiping the
[1:42:29] boy saying brother branham's the voice
[1:42:30] of God Lee's voice of God well yeah in a
[1:42:33] way God speaking through his voice but
[1:42:35] brother Branham is not the voice of God
[1:42:37] the Lord is the voice of God amen
[1:42:39] because it's the one that says Jesus
[1:42:41] Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:42:43] forever but as I said we're all new
[1:42:47] brother SEZ at the 7cr listener this
[1:42:49] week we're all mutes he said there's no
[1:42:52] good in any man he said I don't care who
[1:42:54] he is and he says don't think I'm trying
[1:42:55] to be humble I'm not being humble we're
[1:42:57] all mutes like this and we've just got
[1:43:01] to yield ourselves and let God speak
[1:43:03] through us so a miracle happened all
[1:43:06] that did is proved that you finally
[1:43:08] showed up that I finally showed up baby
[1:43:09] so God could speak through me right
[1:43:12] Church that's right so there's a mole
[1:43:16] there's a season for keeping silent and
[1:43:19] to speak praise God
[1:43:20] let's serious bow our heads for a word
[1:43:22] of Prayer and then in a moment after we
[1:43:25] pray we're and lift up our bottles to
[1:43:27] heaven Oh
