========================================

freedom of the Holy Spirit don't you you know just the freedom to be bound by rules and religion yeah even the Walker family and the psylvia Saints said love how worship and love our song one of the Saints even noted you know they noted how we could take a song that doesn't sound good like millions of Miracles we can take a song that when they make it it doesn't sound good but then we can convert it into malor she plays you know I love how we can take words sound good it's a good tune I love how we can the Holy Spirit can sanctify the song Maybe that's how Sanctified s that's keep woring the pour out your heart before him I always want to be free in the Holy Spirit give God praise because he's worthy of all my praise he's worthy of your praise Hallelujah so let's read this together then we'll be uh be we'll have one more word of prayer before we approach the word of God here tonight God bless the live streamers let's read this on three one two three who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying great Grace unto it let's have a word of prayer let's bow our hearts one more time

things are different than usual Lord where someone might uh invite themselves Lord we just thank you God for the leadership of the holy spirit because we see you in it Lord God I remember Lord I believe you invited yourself to zaki's house one day Hallelujah so thank you Lord You're So merciful so gracious Lord God thank you for your kindness Lord and your love so father bless this reading of Thy word Lord thank you for your Prophet Lord thank you God for sending him with a message of restoration God May our hearts be established with Grace as the Bible says in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God we like to look at part four here tonight of the message of Grace got about 10 topics I like to preach on it's so hard to decide what to preach you know so I just wait on the Lord and look for inspiration um so I want to look at message of Grace part four I'm probably gon to need maybe one more part to finish up this uh uh series here then we'll get to the next one uh the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery and like I told you I've been studying on that I've been studying what brother Ram said about CI scoffield did you know CI scoffield was a part of Dwight Moody's Ministry I didn't know that he kind of he followed Dwight towards the end of his ministry and he followed the Dwight Moody Ministry he was another uh highly uh used man of God kind of contemporary to Charles finny Charles finny of course here in Ohio Oberlin Dwight Moody was there in Chicago and c i c I scoffield had a really bad past you know divorce and all these things but uh after he got converted you know God really used him in a tremendous way um but uh as I shared with you you I want to preach on maybe the Rapture next because that's the next one in the song um and it's a sudden secret coming Hallelujah and as I share with you I don't know if you went and saw that Tucker Carlson video or not but I watched or I listened to it at Double speed so I could get it real done done real fast because I basically know what they're going to say um and uh so they're against the pre-tribulation Rapture they think there's only one coming at Jesus but as I said last week there's at least three more there's the Rapture coming there's 144,000 coming and then there's the Armageddon coming there's at least three more comings of Jesus there could be more um so but but these people think oh there's only one and boy they would have to have quite a situation to tie all those scriptures in so I mean at so this is what they think at at the same event the dead in Christ is going to rise first and and then uh and then we'll be changed meet him in the air and then every eye will see him every eye will mourn uh and then you have uh then you have all the armies coming together against Jesus and then the 144,000 get the Holy Ghost all at the same coming that's a lot going on at one time and We Know by the Scripture it doesn't happen that way because you have three and a half years here three and a half years there you have all these things that have to happen uh but that's that's how sad it is now the reasoning behind that I'll just start with that the reasoning behind that is they uh they're afraid that people that believe in the pre-tribulation Rapture they're afraid the pre-trip people are going to take the mark of the beast because they're going to say well uh the Rapture hasn't happened yet so I still need to buy and sell so I'm going to take the mark of the beast now to me that's really that's really silly to me because anybody that's looking for the Rapture they know that the main component about missing the Rapture is not taking a mark so you can buy and sell right so to me it's it's just silly maybe a word I use is ridiculous it's just a ridiculous worry to have about why there shouldn't be a pre-tribulation Rapture and friends there like I said there's over six there's six types of it in the Bible I mean it's fully it's fully backed up by the scripture but that'll be my next sermon maybe Lord willing by God's grace but um I feel led to look into that by God's grace so last time we looked at uh we finished with Abraham I'm sorry last time we finished with Adam and Eve a couple Sundays ago take it back a few Sundays ago I think we're over in that room I'm not mistaken uh so tonight you know brother raham uses these characters in the message of Grace he starts with Adam and Eve Noah Abraham isra as a nation Moses David and the saved thief on the cross those are the characters he uses to express God's grace now he could have used any he could have used every character in The Bible right because every character needs Grace and the church said you need Grace I need Grace we all need Grace that's the only way we're going to make it by Grace brother R said repeatedly I'm just a sinner saved by grace Hallelujah uh there's people that came after brother Bram and said oh I I had this conversation with him in 1964 brother Bram Saidi no longer a sinner well sad thing is that's not on tape and I'm not going to put any weight on a man's word especially when he's off the word of God he's already off the word already preaching false Doctrine I'm surely not going to believe your so-called story about brother brandham if it's not on tape I'm GNA stay with God's word hallelujah brother BR said I'm a sinner saved by grace not fit to live remember he said that in seventh seal he said not fit to live and I'm not saying that to be humble he says that's facts so we're thankful for God's Amazing Grace so I want to start with Noah tonight because we already did Adam and Eve uh brother mam said the grace of God reached over in Noah's time remember our day is like Noah it's like Noah and lot right so today's a day just like Noah's day today is a day just like lot's day and you saw it right at the Paris Olympics like our brother pointed out there uh all this glorification of the homosexual agenda it's just like the days of Sodom right and it's only going to get worse he says Noah just an ordinary man he and his family but because Noah feared God how many fear God tonight you have a reverence for God in other words you know if you get off the word you're going to get spanked that's the fear of God right I'm not talking about you're afraid to go to hell although you know Paul said that he said I beat my body so I'm not a Castaway right so there there's we got to keep that in mind too that you know our flesh if we feed it it'll go farther than we want it to go right but he said Noah just ordinary man but because Noah feared God he believed God you can't fear God without believing Hallelujah so you have to believe then you'll fear God how can you fear something you don't believe in you've got to fear God Solomon said the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom now just to fear God you're beginning to have wisdom every everyone say beginning ready beginning once you fear God and you know God's in control and you know God's watching your every step and you're careful about how you live now you're just beginning to fear God hallelujah and maybe that's what Sunday's message was about the first love getting that back by God's grace Hallelujah he said and the fear of God Noah feared the Lord and he believed the Lord and that's what God honors is your faith in him we looked at that a few weeks ago remember how many want God to honor you but you've got to honor God first first I want God to honor me but I've got to honor God first Hallelujah and the best way to do that remember what the Bible say the best way to do that is Give in secret remember Jesus said if you let your left hand give without knowing what your right hand's doing right I might be cutting up a little bit but right and then God reward you openly fast and pray in secret and God will reward you openly the fastest or I'm sorry the easiest way to get honored by God is to do things in secret without telling people praise God that's the best way to start honoring God and you know God will honor you Hallelujah you know and I'm just going to share this just for your sake but you know when I first started that YouTube Ministry you know 11 years ago that's what I would do I would always fast and pray before all the videos and God has honored some of those videos you know God has used those to help people and strengthen people so that's why I found there's this key it's a simple key to unlock the door of God honoring you fast and pray Give in secret uh fast pray alms yep fast prayer alms it's a such a simple key put the key in the door open the door Hallelujah and God will honor you but we struggle with that sometimes right we battle with that we get busy we get hungry uh you know we get active right so we've got to remember that's the key to get God to honor you Hallelujah that's right he says then when the fear of God come upon Noah God called him by grace and saved him and his house because it was Grace that did it not because Noah was a great big handsomer man than all the rest of them so Austin's the the tallest in the church here right you know we so Noah wasn't the biggest handsomest man in the church he was just a humble farmer it's by Grace remember the only one the Bible describes like that or two of them are Absalon right and Saul and what did they turn out to do not much for God I don't even know if AB abson got saved I we know Paul I'm sorry we know Saul confessed at the end he stopped chasing David and he fought for Israel and and he died but he says not because Noah went to the best Church there was in the country I hope we have a good church I'm not we don't have to be the best but I hope we have a good church by God's grace Hallelujah not because he belonged to the best organization not because he could dress better he didn't have the best clothes not because he had more money than everybody not because he was some special person but because of the grace of God God saved Noah Grace saved Noah not his works but his grace and also saved his family hallelujah how many you remember that from the book of Hebrews let's go to Hebrews 11 remember that what it said about Noah he moved with the fear of God church that's what I think that's what why Sunday morning was so effective right you know put the fear of God in us brother our brother's talking about the Rapture could be any moment you know uh lockdowns and things uh you know the these things with the Olympics I I I hope it was a way to bring the fear of God back in our lives Hallelujah it's a good thing every now and then to do that that's why we got to return to our first love from time to time Hebrews uh 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet and that's what we've had we've had brother Brandon warn us of things not seen right the W woman ruling America one place he says it's a woman president another place he said it's not a woman it's a Catholic Church my opinion is probably the Catholic church but here we have something that could be pretty close it could be both some people say it's both it could be move with fear so see we got to have that Godly fear the flood's coming I'm talking about the tribulation the the tribulation is coming Hallelujah so we have to have that reality and then we got to move based upon that reality I do not want to be here when the tribulation strikes praise God so I'm going to move with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house so remember you had to spend some people say 70 years some people say 120 depends how you read the text but he spent decades preparing that Ark that's why we spend decades in the house of God hallelujah I spent almost two decades preaching from this Pulpit right here hallelujah and by God's grace if he lets me T I'll keep doing it praise God because I'm preparing salvation for my family amen I'm preparing salvation for this church Hallelujah remember that scripture from First Timothy uh preached the doctrine and it'll save you and then that hear you that that's that that's what Noah did Noah had the right Doctrine so it saved the people what was his Doctrine get in the ark Hallelujah he's a preacher of righteousness get in the ark and that's what I'm saying get in Christ Hallelujah each one of us need to get in Christ hallelujah how do you get in Christ let Christ in you Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah he said uh to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world see you know he wasn't condemning them but his actions because he chose the truth and he chose the right way it condemned everybody else but he was isn't saying I condemn you I condemn you I condemn you we should have love and compassion on Sinners right but the truth the true way will always condemn the false way that's all it's saying and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith he inherited the righteousness because he had the fear of God and he didn't want to die in the flood see church it's okay if you don't want to die in The Great Tribulation period amen that can be a good motivation sometimes Hallelujah the Bible said that it's it's moving with Godly fear hallelujah what do you think when the squeeze comes down what do you I mean you think you'll experience some fear of course right but our faith will o will supersede our fear Hallelujah because perfect love will cast it out Hallelujah right we're believing that by God's grace brother said it'll be the Supreme faith for the Supreme hour brother man makes that quote God will give us the Supreme Faith or the overcoming faith for the hour that we need to overcome Hallelujah just like every person down to the age uh Jesus had to have the Supreme Faith to go to the Cross right look at every Mo Noah had to have Supreme Faith to build an ark we've got to have Supreme Faith to go in the Rapture praise God and God will give it to us hallelujah because that's what we're preaching about we're not preaching about social issues or social justice we're talking about the word of God we're talking about the Rapture scriptures hallelujah we're talking about the grace of God we're talking about the Holy Ghost we're talking about a prophet of God hallelujah we're talking about the word of God hallelujah we Have No Agenda except God's agenda Hallelujah no Creed but Christ no uh no no law but love no book but the Bible and the church said Hallelujah that's right so that's Noah's testimony now you know Genesis chapter 6 but verse eight says but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord now that word found it's not like Noah's walking around and be like oh look what I found I found Grace you know here I I found this map or I found the blueprints on how to build Arc I just found it no it means to attain Noah attained Grace brother man said because he feared God it has to be a free more agency choice or else God is going to be accused by all those that died in the flood well you didn't you didn't give it to me Noah found it but I didn't find it so you're unjust no it's Freemore agency everybody had the choice they were warn for decades Hallelujah we've been warned for almost 60 years since brother went off the scene the the Rapture is going to happen so let's move with fear let's prepare to the saving of our families hallelujah amen the Bible said he that wins Souls is wise so just remember that this week try to win a soul to Jesus Hallelujah that's why I'm doing that event over there that's why I'm going to drive three hours and spend the money I'm going to buy them a meal and hopes that they'll listen to me talk about Jesus if they walk out well I was not I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision brother Austin Hallelujah because you want to win so Souls that's one thing you want to do is win souls so we might even take out an ad in the and put it in the the paper and just try to do this maybe once a year or something to try to get people to come hear the gospel and use whatever influence I have left in my life not much probably but uh I want to try to use that to try to point somebody to Christ hey look over here I'm following Jesus Christ you might know me as a former football player state champion or something like that but now I Want To Be A Champion for Jesus Christ Hallelujah in other words I want to win the race that's set before me praise God I'm going uh who who who will follow me I'm going to follow Jesus amen who will follow me to to go to heaven Hallelujah that's what we all should do but Noah found Grace he attained to Grace because he desired Grace and he feared God so we see the power free more agency and God's for knowledge and then plus Church here's a good sign the proof that he receive Grace was that he preached righteousness remember we read that a couple weeks ago what does Titus 211 say Titus 2:11 says Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness right and our brother brought up those uh Deeds of nicadan scriptures remember that it's it's it's so easy if we remember the scripture if that's a big if if we remember the scripture it's so easy to recognize false teachers their lives will get more ungodly Our Lives should get more holy that's how I always know I don't care if I known the person the message 20 years or one year that's how I know if they're off the word brother Austin they live a less Godly life they're not striving to be more holy they're striving to be Unholy allow more things in their life now I said this before we've all gone through it there are certain things you thought you never do that you might you might have done but if God shows you it's wrong just repent and go back to your first Works amen that's what we've had to do at our house you know we've had to have we have different restrictions about uh screen time and things like that we just changed it up a few weeks ago and we're seeing good results amen hallelujah like these Services we've had amen then you know you see you you see yourself make a mistake that's fine just say Lord forgive me I'm sorry Lord let me do the first Works hallelujah amen remember all things will work together for good to them that love the Lord you know because of the things we've learned in our home you know then I can go preach in Kentucky and see the great move of God and then even a bigger move there in Iowa by God's grace and then we can receive a move of God hallelujah who's still moved by God since Sunday everybody still moved by God everybody moved moved ever got their first love back Hallelujah I've noticed this week my mind's been on the Lord more even more than it was before Hallelujah I've grown in Grace and knowledge of the lord it's been wonderful by God's grace of course it's nice to have that Fellowship there too with the Saints but see Noah attained Grace in the eyes of the Lord because he feared God as soon as God spoke to him he went on to action on it see so you when God tells you something you need to act on it I need to act on the word of God that I heard then God will honor you Hallelujah and then church just like just like Noah he'll put you in the Hall of Fame of faith is that right all because you believed it you just believe what the prophet said you believe the word you acted on it and then God gives you righteousness and then God honors you Hallelujah that's true remember this man got drunk later on and the church said brother Jesse a drunk person can be in the Hall of Fame yes because they repented their drunkenness God put murderers in the Hall of Fame former former murderers former drunks that's a big word right there let's be former Sinners Hallelujah whatever sin we struggle with right let's make it a former sin Hallelujah God I'll put you in the Hall of Fame of Faith Glory I believe that with all my heart because remember he wasn't anybody special he wasn't the biggest guy he wasn't the most handsome guy he wasn't the richest guy he was a guy that feared God Hallelujah that's all we got to have is a desire to fear God and prepare for our family salvation right like my mom didn't do much right because she couldn't do much she didn't have a lot of money but she did prepare for our Salvation she took us to church she prayed for us every morning she prayed for us every night if we're out too late she'd come to our friend's house and say well I'm not leaving till my son comes out of there I don't care what they're doing I don't care whose house that is I'm and she'd honk she'd blow the lights on there they finally come out it might be 12:00 it might be 1:00 a.m. that's before cell phones now you got the cell phone now she can track them text them see you got to prepare if you're like brother man said if you're convinced then you'll be concerned I'm convinced I want to make the Rapture so I'm concerned about how I live my life amen Noah was convinced the flood was coming so he's concerned how am I going to save my family amen I'm convinced that tribulation is coming so I'm concerned how can I save as many as I can hallelujah what can I do to win a soul what can I do to save somebody praise God what can I do to invite the holy ghost in the church so everybody gets the Holy Ghost amen and everybody keeps the Holy Ghost can I say like that you know you never Le lose the seal but you keep your first love amen so let's take a lesson as brother Bram those are the lessons brother Bram gave us about the grace of God to Noah and then he quickly moved on to Abraham so I moved on to Abraham now I preached a lot on Abraham last year I know Austin liked it and I preach it over there remember I preached it there in PA and the brother Paul had been preaching on Abraham for months for four months he was preaching on Abraham's Covenant and I come in there I preach on Abraham I see them all look around like who told this brother well God told me but I didn't know he told me Hallelujah brother said we could call another character where God's grace was extended many of them we'll just speak of a few Abraham no special man you can see in his life he wasn't that special you I'll say like this I'm not very special either and don't think you're very special either because we're not special for all have fallen short of the glory of God none seeketh after God no not one came down from the Tower of Babel he was at the Tower of Babel perhaps come out of an idol Bunch his father that's actually scriptural he did come down in the land of Shar down there to dwell in the city of ER and while he was there God spoke to him by Grace not because he was different not because he was a better man but by Grace God called him the Bible clearly makes that known oh Abraham how he he says oh how Abraham tested God's patience remember that chart I gave there was like I think there was five red dots remember each one of those times he tested God's grace can I say it like this another Bible word you'll know is he frustrated the grace of God in other words God told him exactly brother Austin what to do but he did the exact opposite of that that's frustrating the grace of God or another word you might know is grieve that Grieves the grace of God right Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption right brother says he didn't say oh how handsome Abraham was oh how rich he was rich but that's not what brother R calls out he said oh how disob Beed he was at times to God and that's what we do too we see we know the message we know so much that many times when we sin like I told you it's an iniquity because we know we shouldn't do it but thank God he forgives all iniquities so thankful for that scripture without that scripture I'd be sweating Austin I already am sweating when I preach hard too but I'd be swea for my soul and always remember if God could save David from a murderous adultery then God can save us to the utmost Hallelujah he could save that man up there down there in Glenn in for after 52 years of of uh Lous living and if the grace of God can come to him in a moment and deliver him from uh from from suicide and and a filthy life like that and wash him up and make him the happiest man in the church at 76 years old surely he can save us as well Hallelujah throughout your mind battles you're you're not even out in the world you know you're trying to serve God you're doing the best you can if God can extend his grace to them God will extend his grace to us as well hallelujah amen the Bible makes that known oh how Abraham tested God's patience he he told him and said Abraham stay in this land don't you go out of it but as soon as the famine come Abraham run Abraham spoke of us brother raham says everybody say I am Abraham ready I am Abraham now everybody can say I am Sarah ready I Sarah because you might be Sarah Abraham spoke of us God took Abraham by grace and saved him and that's how he takes you by grace and how do we test his patience sometimes we test God's patience remember he's not upset with us but we can grieve his Spirit brother said how do we test his patience he said today we're up tomorrow we're down one day we believe the next day we're wondering wonder if God is going to I wonder if God is going to let me go the rest but at church oh yeah I believe glory to God hallelujah Look What the Lord Has Done Hallelujah I got a reason to praise amen God turned my grave into a garden the next day do I have a do I have a garden is there anything growing in my garden do I have the fruits of the Holy Spirit we're up and down brother said that's our experience like Abraham's experience we test God's patience he said today we're a Methodist tomorrow we're a Baptist now that's not us by God's grace today we believe in Divine Healing tomorrow the tummy a comes and we don't know whether we believe it or not that that applies to us but yet in the midst of all that God wants us to stay put he saves us anyhow if it wasn't the grace of God we'd all be gone sure God Saves Us by his grace I love brother I love this sermon it's a beautiful sermon in the message of Grace he continues he says Abraham was supposed to stay in that land but he went down to the Chans I'm sorry not the Chans the Philistines he went down there to sojourn to get out of the famine actually I think that's wrong I think he went to Egypt to get out of the famine so there's another one we can add to the list of not not every words thus sayi the Lord things was a little hard up in his country so he went down there to Journey down there with him now listen I like this phrase done exactly what God told him not to do Church there's times we do exactly what God said don't do that the holy spirit will say don't do that and just we'll just blow right through it and do it we'll just blow through the stoplight brother B calls it he said you could you might make it a couple times and one of these times you're going to get hit keep going through stoplights brother B said that's your conscience your conscious says don't do that he said if you do it anyway you just blew through the stoplight right and brother said Abraham did exactly what God said don't do was Abraham saved did Abraham still have the Covenant glory to God yes he did are you still saved do you still have the Covenant the blood of Jesus Christ of course are you still Abraham's seed Hallelujah you're still God's child but sometimes the flesh is rebellious I should say every day the flesh is re rebellious he said done exactly what God told him not to do but yet the grace of God appeared to him kept Pharaoh from taking his wife he could have lost his wife because of his own Disobedience to God but God had Grace on him Hallelujah see church we we make decisions we could lose something we could lose all this because of our own decision we could lose our reputation that's probably one that would impact us I could make a decision and lose my reputation as a preacher or whatever so could you but what keeps you the grace of God keeps you and then if you do make a mistake what brings you back the grace of God brings you back just like Abraham Hallelujah and when you think about Abraham what do you think of the bad or the good I think of the good don't you I think of the father of the faith my received a child at 100 years old Sarah Sarah was 90 I don't think of the bad stuff oh yeah he in the famine time he got scared and R that's not the first thing I think about him I think about the blessedness of Abraham that's how that's how you think about yourself think about the blessings God has given to you praise God the promises Hallelujah he said it's the grace of God when Abraham said it's my sister he lied about it but yet the grace of God held him because he repented he was willing to repent and anybody that's willing to repent the grace of God still goes for you the grace of God is searching for you so that goes for you backsliders this morning he says the grace of God is still looking for you if you'll just repent God's grace is sufficient how he took good old Abraham brought him back good old Abraham he took good old Malachi and good old Jesse and good old Christen and took good old AAA and good old Caris I use my family names here it's a good old lyia and he brings us back by his grace Hallelujah and remember Abraham was not saved by his Works he was saved by grace Abraham was saved by faith which is Grace and God saved AB Abraham because of his grace not because of his behavior he saved him because of his grace oh how good he was saved by grace and I want to just give you a simple example you might remember this brother said done Abraham done exactly what God said don't do was there another Prophet that did that there's lots of prophets that did that right David but the one I want to show you is brother brandham you remember this one brother Bram had a a dream about the three poles of his ministry he tells about this in the seventh seal I don't know why so many seventh seal quotes have been coming to me lately but God's grace and the angel said he said don't try to explain that he said this is the third third pole but I'll meet you in there he said the little tent room there's a big tent I'm sorry there's a big tent there's a little room he said I'll meet you in that little room now I believe that was God meeting brother brandom at brother what's the brother's house uh always forget his name brother R's neighbor I can't remember his name I'll think of it later anybody remember H Banks Woods there it is Banks Woods he's the one that was there when the brother spoke to the fish and it got his life back um and and uh so so I I believe God met brother brandom in that little room and then revealed the Seven Seals to him the third pole and there was no impersonation of that it wasn't a public show God met him individually in that room now I could be wrong on that but that's just my that's my best guess but said I was standing in the vision with a little baby shoe when he told me he said now make your first poll when you do the fish will run after the lure said then was your second pole because it's only a it'll only be a small fish he said then the third pole will get it and all those ministers got around me saying brother random we know you can do it Hallelujah brother random that's where I always get tied up with a bunch of preachers see I love people they want you to explain everything this that that's where I always get tied up to a bunch of preachers and I said well uh uhhuh I said well I don't know I said I understand I've understand fishing now I said now the first thing you do here's the way it's done you see all the fish around you got to jerk The Lure well that's exactly the tactics of fish and so I said jerk The Lure now you see where I jerk The Lure the first time now the fish takes after it but they were little ones and that's just like they they were catching so the ministers were catching little fish but God told Brother R you'll catch the big fish with the third pole so what does that represent that represents the Holy Ghost filled Saints right because few there be that find it fewer and fewer Christians are being saved all the time the big fish represents the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because it's a small group Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road he says and then he said I jerked it out and when I did I had a fish on it for the third pole he had a fish on it he said but it looked like a skin Over The Lure it was so little so just like the fish was just fit over the top of the lure like the the whole fish was full of a lure it was so small and then I was standing there and the angel said I told you not to do that sound familiar like like Abraham Abraham did exactly what God told him to to not do brother Ram did exactly the opposite what the angel Lord told him to do and Friends there's me there's me there's numerous cases of that I'm trying to get you to see the same Grace that was with brother brandom is with you Hallelujah in other words God's grace doesn't leave you after you make mistakes the gifts and callings of God are without repentance amen you always have your gift you always have your calling just repent make it right God's with you Hallelujah I've seen in my life amen I make mistakes I fall short we I come back to God God use me again Hallelujah I don't even deserve it Hallelujah I'm not worthy of it I'll do exactly opposite what he tells me to do but then he'll still have Grace on me and use me later Hallelujah that's a god of Grace Hallelujah but man said I started crying all all the L line was Tangled around me we went fishing a few earlier this month that boy I got the line I got it I got my line all tangled up I felt like brother Brandon and I was standing there crying with my head down like that I said oh God forgive me I'm a stupid person oh Lord forgive me and I had this line and the voice said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things now let them alone see remember brother BR was catering to the denominations he tells us that and as I was with Moses 1960 1960 I preach that to you when when the Joshua series remember brother R said he was majoring on the sign instead of the destination remember that that was a long time ago when brother Johnny and Sister Sarah were coming here remember that remember I had a sign uh signed to akan signed to signed to Cleveland there's all these signs brother Ram was majoring on the sign and said the destination in other words he was getting people to try in the prayer line this was the focus of it was the prayer line rather than just trying to get as many people healed as possible brother raham said I left thousands of people laying there without praying for them Hallelujah and he said God forgive me I measured on the sign instead of the destination and the church said church sometimes we major on the wrong things right sometimes can I just be honest sometimes we'll major on brother brandom too much emphasis on him sometimes we major on ourselves right sometimes we major on that preacher or that relative right we major on them instead of what we should major on on the right thing we should put the first things first Hallelujah we should stay humble Hallelujah brother told us he was trying to show the world that God could heal these uh the the hardest Miracles remember even in 1947 he tells us that uh when he had the first tapes he said I spent six months saying bring me the hardest cases and I'll prove that God's A Healer and God honored him but then the angel said you've been disobedient I never told you to do that so what I'm trying to show you is that there's Grace for brother brandom there'll be if there's Grace for the church age messenger there'll be grace for the rest of the church age Hallelujah if there's Grace for that star are in his hand there's Grace for the candlesticks Hallelujah am CU we're all drawing on the same oil Hallelujah every Church age pulled on the same oil that's what we're pulling on tonight the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so other words let let AC accept God's forgiveness that was some of the testimonies tonight right accept that God forgive you and then get the oil flown again and God will use you again hallelujah hallelujah that's right how many times have I seen that in my life my you can't teach the Pentecostal baby Supernatural things I know that I got family in Pentecostal churches I can't teach them Supernatural things it's the supernatural revelation of the B the baptism and hair length and makeup and pants and cross ring you can't teach him Supernatural things and the church said you can't even teach him Supernatural things like that any any dream they have is from God we ought to be more mature than that you try every dream amen you test every dream by the word of God I had a dream the other night Austin I was like fighting somebody from high school and I finally got him tied down and I tried to say some old joke now you think that was from God we were just playing around and I was like I was just it was a ridiculous dream but like you know you got to be careful now especially when your dreams involve God or Jesus right you gota be really careful it has to have has to have a Vindication from the word of God right so see we got to be able to learn Supernatural things spiritual things Hallelujah glory and then that seventh seal brother man said this third poll is coming up right so in March of 63 he said it's coming up right but he disobeyed God six months later in December he says the third poll has been Vindicated I'm sure you know what it is it's the opening of the word the speaking of the word right because he told the five test testimonies of speaking the word right squirrels storm uh Sunny Shimp uh his wife uh the tumor and then I forget the fifth one oh hady writes boys amen finally memorized all or finally got all five off there Hallelujah do just spoke the word wait wait for God to give you the word speak God's word hallelujah I've seen in my life I think three or four times now and uh Simon's seen it three or four times as well you speak the word when you're anointed by God God backs up his word so nine months later he says the third polls Vindicated he says but it won't be used in a great way until the council begins to tighten up we're see it tightening up aren't we that's right church and state coming together remember I'm going to preach this later when I get to the Rapture part but remember Noah is just one of six examples of Believers Escaping The Wrath of God Noah is one now he's a foolish virgin type but I want to let you know brother R uses him as a wise version type one time just so you know I'm gonna read it to you right now on the wings of a snow white dove less than a month before he died he said the ark was constructed once you were inside there's only one window in it and it was right in the top you couldn't look sideways you couldn't look no way but straight up that's the way the ark Jesus Christ is you can't look at the next fellow you can't look at brother Jess can't look at sister so and so you can't look at anybody else you got to look up you got to look to Jesus Hallelujah you can't look at nothing but Christ when you're in the ark because there's only one door and he's that door we talked about this morning Christ is the door Christ is the salt Christ is the water Christ is the light of the world Christ is everything he's the door of the Sheepfold Hallelujah he's the great Shepherd look to Jesus Hallelujah amen see brother says that's the way Christ The Ark Jesus Christ is so Jesus Christ is the ark yes so see that represents we can use it as a type of the Rapture normally it's a foolish versin type but brother M here uses it as we we must look up to Jesus only we must be in Christ then we then we uh bypass the tribulation period I'll say it like that Hallelujah he says you can't look to the next fellow you got to look straight at Christ 1 Peter 3:20 also remember Noah is the type of just being saved first Peter 3:20 which sometime were disobedient remember Jesus preaching to the souls that were lost there in the heart of the earth after the uh he died when Once the longsuffering of God weighed in the days of Noah remember most of those people Church were uh what was Noah Noah was 600 years old when the flood came most of those people were old people they now they were still young in their in one way way but they' been there for many years they've been warned for many many years they had plenty of times to repent you ought to feel thankful if you repented on Sunday Hallelujah and if you didn't repent on Sunday tonight's your night hallelujah amen get right with God Amen don't take any chances praise God that's right they waited the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing where in few that his eight Souls were saved by water the like figure so what is Noah type of the figure is even baptism does now also save us so just as the water saved Noah water baptism saves us not not the putting away the filth of the flesh not your behavior but it's the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ see it's the answer of your free moral agency yes I'll follow Jesus Christ yes I'll go be baptized because I've died to my will and I'm resurrected I'm a new person praise God and the answer of a good conscience proves I'm saved Hallelujah so Saints if the Devil comes to you tomorrow you can look at him and say Satan get behind me I was baptized I'm saved 1 Peter 3:21 says it Hallelujah say it's written Satan is that right Church what did Jesus do when Satan came to him did he do some miracle no he just said it's written I'm standing on the word the word has enough power of its own Hallelujah stand with God's word tonight Hallelujah give Satan the word test I heard a preacher say it it was really good he said the I no he's not a preacher I heard a man say on that video uh the Tucker C video that man said the Bible says resist Satan he will flee that means run so when you speak God's word Satan just doesn't go like well see you later he actually runs I don't want I don't have a lot of room to run in here I could jump in here he actually will flee that's how much he's afraid of the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he will flee remember he fell like lightning from Heaven Satan will flee oh my what a Change of Atmosphere we should feel when we confess our sins and we trust in the blood of Jesus Christ Satan should flee instantly and we should instantly feel the peace of God come back into our lives because he flees he don't hang around he flees if you resist him he will leave you hallelujah amen that's for somebody because that was in my notes Hallelujah I didn't plan to say that I thought it was a good thought but I forgot about it for my notes so Noah he found Grace he missed the wrath of God because of Grace Enoch that's that's our type real real type Esther it was coming for all the all the Believers all the Jews like all the Christians lot right he's a type of foolish virgin but look he he believed in God and so God had mercy on him he won't destroy the righteous with the wicked thank God we can be righteous through the blood of Christ and the Holy Spirit praise God see that proves that as you prepare your family to miss the tribulation period that proves you got faith just like Noah and that proves you're going to miss the tribulation because you're going in the Rapture hallelujah how many you believe that by God's grace it think about it it has to be us because nobody else is preaching it really certainly nobody else is living it right like we're trying to live it by the grace of God so see we have that answer of a good conscience toward God so brother Ram uses Noah as one type as the baptism of the Holy Ghost because we got to be he says in Jesus Christ The Ark another time uh Noah is used as salvation that's how we know we're saved okay I didn't do the other two the other Parable is the King's son Parable because remember all those who had the wedding garment stayed in the wedding right but The Man Without The Wedding garment there was weeping wailing and nashing of teeth outside the supper and the church said see they missed the wrath of God because they had on the righteousness of Jesus Christ amen don't you know you got the righteousness of Jesus Christ tonight praise God hallelujah and then the sixth and final one was the 10 virgins now I want to just go there real quick what was the uh I can't remember the reaction to them missing the were they just knocking maybe there wasn't any negative consequence Matthew 25 I think it's 13 oh he just says I know you not okay so there's no mention of weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth but there is that effect of Jesus will say I never knew you I don't know you you're not born again like brother like brother Paul said you haven't been in the bedroom with me I I I haven't become your the love of your life right Hallelujah but Jesus was the love of the life of the wise virgins he was their love of their life Hallelujah their greatest love what's your greatest love what's your greatest Joy certainly it's worshiping Jesus Christ Hallelujah nothing greater than that Hallelujah I've never seen anything greater that's why I keep coming back every Wednesday brother Austin every Sunday morning every Sunday night because there's nothing greater in this world than being in God's presence is there anything greater I was right here was there anything greater than praying for people I was so tired but I was kind of lean like this I was praying for Haven is there anything greater than praying and and crying and trusting in God and knowing that God is heing your prayer and then we stand up and pray then then Nia comes around and hugs me and he starts praying for me I'm like I'm going to pray for you too buddy thanks for thanks for your prayers Hallelujah is there anything greater than that where you feel the presence of God and you just feel like if I had the strength I could worship God all day there's sometimes I feel like I could preach four or five hours I think I really could I really could I could probably sing four or five hours too I've clapped so hard brother Austin until my hands have bled in Pennsylvania I didn't have a lot of wisdom in those days a lot of zeal but not a lot of wisdom but is there anything greater than that uh you know going to see some Monument the Grand Canyon what would be greater going to see the Grand Canyon or or going or or having the Holy Ghost visit you amen it's the greatest blessing we got because we fear God God comes and honors you hallelujah hallelujah I'm happy Glory I better finish up here by God's grace long preaching okay uh 48 that's pretty short sermon 49 minutes I know we got started late but let me go one more here I'll go one more yeah because there's only one more all right uh next brother Ram's next example so we've been through Noah Abraham his last example I'm sorry the last example I'm going to use for this service is Israel brother Braham said let's take uh Israel go to Deuteronomy 7:7 brother Braham uses this verse in the message uh the message of Grace if you haven't listened that I'd encourage You Have you listened to that brother message of Grace yeah amen amen uh 1961 yeah it's a great one if you have it it's it's oh I don't know that that's a good question buddy on my I I do the podcast it's it's purple on my podcast it's a if church if you haven't listened to that I really encourage you listen to to Really uh build your faith up because it's all about of course God's grace that's what we're saved by not you're not saved by works Sav by Grace Deuteronomy 7:7 so brother uses this verse here the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of people for you at the fewest of all people see in other words God didn't choose his love because you're better than somebody God didn't choose to love us because we're the biggest church somebody should say Amen on that I'll say amen amen verse eight but because the Lord loved you that's why I chose you he love you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his COV Commandments to a thousand generations and repe them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slacked to him that hateth him he will repay pay him to his face Thou shalt therefore keep the Commandments and the statutes and the judgments which I command to thee this day to do them so brother quotes this and he says God gave Abraham his promise I'm sorry God gave it to Israel he says he says if you will not associate with idolatry now he's using other verses in this chapter if you will not do these things if you'll stay away from all these Pagan ceremonies how many staying away from the Olympics if you'll do all these things then I'll bring you to a good land I'll take care of you I'll feed you I'll lead you I'll do all these things if you do such and such things if you'll love me if you'll keep my Commandments my statutes my ordinances I'll do all these things if you'll just do something and keep my Commandments and love me and brother said that God promising that to Israel is just like a husband to a wife now he goes into the home life just like a husband takes a wife and said honey I'll if you'll be a good woman I'll take care I'm sorry if if you'll be a good woman if you'll take care of the house if you'll be true to me if you'll keep my clothes clean if we have children if you'll be a good mother to them if you'll do these things I'll work till my hands bleed to make you a living if you'll do it so brother he shows an example of God's like a husband Israel's like the the wife he says that's what a husband does with his wife Hallelujah they agree to love each other Hallelujah but then but brother say but then think what if the woman turn turns wrong like Israel did lives lazy won't work won't do nothing he says then it takes Grace to keep that family together now look what brother brother is building this up he said this is what Israel did Israel should have kept the commands but they didn't but did but is is is Israel forever gone church out of the plan of God of course not he says how can I forget you he said you're engraved in the palm of my hands I died for you you amen and if he died for rebellious Israel and still loves them what about you who you're trying to obey him you've got you're born again you're not trusting in another blood of bulls and ghats you're trusting in the blood of God's own son Jesus Hallelujah surely he won't forget you amen he can't forget you Hallelujah you're his beloved now remember Romans nine always always remember that you're God's beloved I know Austin is God's beloved I know that that's been Vindicated to me brother I told that testimony Wherever I Go remember uh John beloved to the Lord Leah loved the Lord Austin loved to the Lord you're sitting right there in front of me brother brother Austin you're loved to the Lord hallelujah that's right he says if a woman turns lazy then it takes Grace to keep that family together oh God it taken the grace of Jehovah to keep his family together that includes us and that's the only way we're Jehovah's family today is because of the grace of Jesus Christ we'd all be gone but it's Grace oh Grace he says Grace Grace we shout Grace Grace unto the coming headstone unto the coming of the Rapture we're shouting thank God for Grace thank you Jesus for Grace Grace that you're coming to get us out of this world hallelujah amen he said but Israel didn't keep it they never did come to the the full promise not that generation the one that promised was made to they perished in the wilderness but God fed them God took care of them God loved them God moved them around why his grace in it his grace because of his promise his promise then the grace that went with his promise but they never did come to the full value of the promised land now look at that people can people can fail God's grace but he keeps giving them more grace doesn't the doesn't the rain fall on the just and the unjust that's great brother raham said and neither will the church now talking about us neither will the church come to its full value the grace of God holds us are we at the spot where we do we do we see the fullness of Pentecost in the bride yet not quite we need some paralyzed people to walk when I start seeing paralyzed people walk and blind eyes see then I'll know we're in the fullness of Pentecost right because you can't do nothing greater than Jesus hallelujah or a dead person raised after two days days or a day or something like that so we don't have it there we don't have it yet there but we have so much like I'll say like this remember compare our church like to the Corinthian Church I'm not suing Austin for anything and Austin's not suing me for anything they were suing each other a man was sleeping with his stepmother right they were arguing well I'm of brother Jesse no I'm of Donnie Reagan or I'm I'm of Cam Smith cam Smith's better than your my my pastor's better than your pastor I'm they were arguing about in the church look how you look how great I am and you know they were arguing about that and Paul says you're carnal you got divisions and factions among you those things shouldn't be he said we're all of Christ he said you should have been baptized in the name of the one that was crucified for you I'm glad I didn't baptized none of you he said some of you would have said I baptized you in my own name that's how carnal they were they were saying well I I could be baptized in Paul's name oh brother brandham baptized me or I I was baptizing in brother bram's name those were the problems in the church we don't have those problems thank God we don't have those problems if we did I might resign you might leave right because where's the Holy Ghost amen where's the spirit of God Church it tells us something the grace of God is here the Holy Ghost is here let's keep pressing into the things of God hallelujah it tells us we're making some progress by God's grace amen hallelujah he says this church must hasn't come to its full value yet he said but God wants to get a church that'll obey him a people that'll take his word and say it's the truth regardless of your organization now we we won't battle that he wants a people that will not say well I'm just as good as you are I'm Presbyterian I'm Methodist I'm Catholic I'm as good as you are that's not Grace that shows there's something wrong okay so's he's getting down into churches arguing now church for us we can't say well we're better than that church because they're the goat church or we're better than that church because they're a tape tape church only that's that's what I want I want you to get that you understand we can't pridefully say I'm better than the tape church or we're better we're better than those uh goat preachers we're the say they're the greatest of all we can't exalt ourselves in any way right that's why I took last last year and I specifically invited somebody from the goat group to come preach for us to show Fellowship to show that I'm not a part of the Deeds of nians that's what the nicadan did you just heard it preach diophy said we're not receiving John we're not receiving the preachers of that message because I've got a better Revelation than he's got see so see now if this may be the case if message people don't invite me back because what I believe they could have the Deeds of nicoladis if I if I'm preaching the truuth everybody seeing I'm trying to be humble if I'm preaching the truth and they don't invite me back they might have the Deeds of nicadan but I don't want the Deeds of nicadan do you understand now people are going to preach false Doctrine you know I'm not going to invite them I'm only going to preach the ones that are good in their groups the true preachers in their groups everybody understand and M church this is serious God said Jesus said I hate that I hate when people uh become denominational and they won't invite somebody just because they believe the truth and they don't have the truth so jealousy amongst preachers God hates that right so we can never exalt ourselves we're better than the tape people we're better than uh the goat people we are what we are because of the grace of God now do we believe we're right of course we believe we're right but we're not prideful about it and I don't think you are I'm just letting you know that's your warning that's what that's what Paul said Paul said God told him to warn us we don't we don't do the Deeds of nians and don't lose your first love hallelujah hallelujah but a person regardless that will read God's word and see that you've got to be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost they'll believe that they'll take it by the word they'll take the word exactly what it says so by I'm saying that's the kind of bride Jesus wants I'm gonna read it again because I read it kind of fast how many believe you got to be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost which is the same thing and how many believe you got to take the word exactly the way it's written brother man says then you're doing what God called you to do Hallelujah there's my hour my timer just went off let's stand to our feet by God's grace Mal can come how many are grateful for the message of Grace Hallelujah I'm thankful I love going through brother Ram sermons real like this I love it I catch things I never seen like that before like he said about Abraham done exactly what God Said not do it proves we all need the grace of God tonight Hallelujah you might even experience this you can play uh uh I pledge allegiance to the lamb go back in your memory there church I found this in my life I I'll be here like on a Sunday I'll rededicate my life to God and this happened many times over the years last I've been faster 18 years how many times over the years have I preached to get your first love back I mean you could and yet God sends his brother in and we have some of you have a real genuine experience but let's just be honest Monday did you probably battle something yeah did you probably battle something yesterday yeah battle something today yeah so what you got to keep doing keep repenting keep asking God for his grace but you can still say I got my first love because I want to do right that's how brother R said you know you got it you repent glory amen you repent I'm going to preach on this soon about 11 we just got to stop Sin from grow from growing you can't touch it like the Bible said touch not the unclean thing I'm going I'm going to keep preaching on that because that's the Warriors add ude now can I talk about this this is what God has showned me again like wow I have to be so militant against sin right remember brother Dennis come in here and preach on secret sin like we need reminders of that we go through Cycles remember brother Ram said there's always a cycle of life and death in the church age book so you start on fire get cool off a little bit get far away from God but then you get your fire back it happens again then it happens in 2023 then it happens in 20 24 it's going to happen Lord willing in 2025 and the church said but we have to thank God and say wow God you spoke to us on Sunday I had a real experience now Lord let me renew that tonight by God's grace and church we got to leave here I am resolved not to sin right I'm resolved to stay away from sin by the grace of God how many will do that let's pray father God I thank you for tonight Lord God coming off a wonderful weekend like that Lord God I just thank you for your holy spirit that we feel here tonight Lord I felt Lord the boldness of the Holy Spirit increase Lord as I ministered I thank you Lord for that I thank you for the grace you showed to Noah Abraham and Israel and that you showed to us because we all love we all need we all trust in the grace of

battle to keep that first love Tuesday and here we are Wednesday we battle for three days to keep that first love I don't want the people to be discouraged I want them to be encouraged because of the
