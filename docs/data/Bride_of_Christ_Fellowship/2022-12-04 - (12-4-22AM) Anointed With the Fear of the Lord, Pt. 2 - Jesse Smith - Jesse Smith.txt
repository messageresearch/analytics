========================================

I have a few uh quotes to show scriptures rather so let's look at part two here and uh see how far we can get by God's grace so we looked at I'm just going to do A Brief Review I promise it's just it's uh only a couple slide review Okay so so from Wednesday we saw how the fear of the Lord is all these things it was just amazing to see when you start lining it up what the fear of the Lord actually is it's your moral reverence so your moral honor for God in other words your honor of obedience so when when a person has the fear of the Lord they honor God with their moral decisions that means they're obeying the voice of the Lord praise God and I you know as I believe you know the more I thought about it all weekend and everything like that the more I think about it is the more I I think is that just to be saved you've got to have the fear of the Lord because the Bible says the beginning of wisdom right and then if you don't have wisdom you can't see the the mother Harlot sits on Seven Hills plus all the other gifts of the Spirit you know all the other aspects of uh the supernatural the Bible says the goodness of God leads us to repentance so what's good about God what's good about God is that he forgives us of our sins we're guilty of of sin but God forgives us and so the goodness of God leads us to repentance so we fear God we honor God we morally we we morally honor God and we say Lord your ways are right and you're and I'm repenting I'm uh and repenting is departing from Evil there it is praise God so the fear of the Lord is to depart from Evil the fear of the Lord is to hate evil and so a person can't even get saved unless they have the fear of the Lord so what does that mean it means that fear of the Lord is an anointing that can increase as we continue serving the lord Hallelujah you and I will never get to a spot where we say I'm I'm good on the fear of the Lord I don't need any more fear of the Lord right we'll never get to a spot on that um so we just want to revisit it I think it's timely as we've had all this uh all the results and I kind of want to show that at the end too brother random says when you're LED of the Holy Spirit you have to if you don't hear a voice or you don't see a vision from God he says you have to look at the results that your decision bears and so that's what I've always tried to do as a preacher I'm sure you two as a believer you know you make decisions and you fight you're you're trying to find the will of God the best you can but then you the nice part is you have hindsight you look back and say okay that was either the right decision or the wrong decision and when it's the right decision then you know you found the leading of the Lord you've you've had the fear of the Lord praise God for that decision and and if not well then you say praise God forgive me try me again next time I'll have the fear of the Lord for this amen and so that's what all of us all of us fail we all fall short of God's grace but God really loves us amen that's a beautiful song buddy I always mention one of the songs amen sings because it's always it's it's always uh timely by God's grace so the fear of the Lord is also your confidence in God we saw that the Bible said he that's in the fear of the Lord is confident in God hallelujah now to me church this I think this is the key I didn't have time to write this out but I think this is the key to more miracles because the Bible said Jesus could not do many miracles because of their unbelief right what is unbelief well doubt you know I don't believe the word but when we're confident in God then we know God wants to move amen so I feel like you know the more fear of the Lord and we I can prove this by the Bible uh the book of Acts especially the more fear of God we have the more God moves supernaturally in other words the more moral reverence the more we're honoring God with our decisions the more God moves in our life how many how many witnesses of that by God's grace amen the more you really make sure today I'm going to serve God today I'm really going to honor God today I'm going to meditate on the things of God today I'm really going to be focused on God today the more we do that the more we see God move in our lives and that's what the scripture tells us so it's plain it's true it's Vindicated by the Holy Spirit praise God and also the fear of God is your Refuge it's your place of safety praise God hallelujah fear is your starting place on your journey to getting the main thing right getting the wisdom of God it's so many things fear is your Fountain of Life hallelujah thank you Jesus fear is uh the anointing that you receive when you hate evil fear is your constant source of Happiness who would have thought fear brings happiness right but it's a different definition up here it's not the fear we normally associate with them I'm fearful of guns or I'm fearful of dogs I'm fearful of monsters or whatever you're whatever someone might be fearful of but it actually when you fear the lord it brings true happiness in your life and then we saw that fear is your conclusion about life's purpose have I accomplished my purpose in life the way you'll know is because you're walking in the fear of the Lord you're morally reverent to the things of God and church many times you know I think we just have to Humble ourselves and accept what God's purpose is for our life rather than the purpose we think we need for our lives right it's different many times than what we want it to be it's not about us it's about God hallelujah it's about God's choice who are we to tell to the uh the Potter Lord you need to make me like this you need to make my life like this no the the Potter has power over the clay praise God and Jesus has power over each one of our lives and so thank God for the fear of the Lord that we can come to our conclusion that my life when I when I obey God when I reverence his word then I'm fulfilling God's purpose I found the conclusion of the matter amen I found the conclusion to the mystery of my life I found it in the fear of the Lord It's so simple right it's just you know it's just kind of shocking how simple it actually is when we look at the scriptures here okay and then this was a good one too you know I think it kind of struck me while I was preaching fear of the Lord is taught by Grace when you receive God's gift receiving God's gift cause you to you know morally reverence God it causes you to honor God so fear is taught by Grace fear is not taught by legalism uh and of course the fear of God also teaches you reverence we saw that in Hebrews chapter 12. let us serve God acceptably with reverence and fear Hallelujah so thank God for Amazing Grace hallelujah how many want to be taught by Grace amen I don't want to be taught by the law uh the law of man or legalism I don't I don't want to be taught by human fear I want to be taught by the grace of God hallelujah to teach me the fear of the Lord praise God and of course we saw the Lord Jesus Christ was anointed with the fear of the Lord this is speaking of Jesus he come out of the stem of Jesse then David Solomon down all those Generations Messiah came out of the uh the tribe of Judah by God's grace and notice the spirit of Lord rests upon Him in all these ways and then the Bible said he shall make of him quick understanding in the fear of the Lord so Jesus was quick to fear the lord he was I'll say like this he was constant he was always fearing the Lord right and in the moments where he struggled what'd he do he prayed right he said he said he had that moment he said let this cup Pastor me right so he was battling with fearing the Lord you know Lord if it's possible take this cup from me but notice in the moments where he was struggling with the fear of the Lord Prayer is what got him through praise God prayer is what it's going to get you through praise God prayer is what is going to get me through it's going to get each of us through when we come to moments of our life when we don't maybe know the will of God or we don't we find it difficult to obey the will of God prayer and self-crucifixion you know dying to self mortifying the Deeds of the flesh uh taking up one's cross daily walking like Jesus walk will help us find the fear of the Lord and so Jesus was quick in the understanding in the fear of the Lord he understood this he was quick to obey he was quick to go to prayer Hallelujah God help us to be quick to go to prayer amen he will by God's grace now just I put a little thought in here between these verses so the fear of the Lord is an anointing that gives you spiritual discernment or spiritual eyesight and spiritual hearing because the Bible said Jesus would not judge after the sight of his eyes right Jesus could look at the Pharisees and say you're the cleanest physical people on earth you have the most beautiful clothes right your temple garments or your your Priestly garments they're the most beautiful garments but inwardly you're full of dead men's bones right so it is today no matter how big a church is or no matter how rich people are whatever money they spend on clothes a real spiritual person thank God we can look past the outside and we could look down into the heart right that's the spirit of the Lord the spirit of the Lord doesn't look upon the outward appearance just like God God doesn't look upon the outward appearance amen like like he told David right like Samuel told David God look at us at the heart Hallelujah and see even the hearing of the ears you know Jesus Jesus watch the Pharisees worship and he said they draw near to me with their mouth but their heart is far from me right that's why you know when we listen to like let's say a Hillsong song or a Bethel song or uh any any person put any name in there we can kind of hear their singing but to me they don't sing it with the real love like we sing it with Hallelujah that's right amen we can hear it but it just doesn't have the right ring to it praise God because we're hearing with more than just a natural one right so we got to take out there's any Little Rock and Roll we got to take that out if there's any like uh what do they call it when they make their voice all like that inflection they inflict their voice or they slur like you know how Lauren Daigle does the you know they they add this human element to it well we can hear that's just not really that doesn't glorify Christ that's exalting a manner that's exalting a woman so see the fear of the Lord and if you fear God you wouldn't make your voice sound like that it's not a performance it's a worship praise God and so Jesus just like the Pharisees you know Jesus just we can do the same thing we have the spirit of God to recognize well that doesn't sound exactly right they're saying all the right things but it doesn't sound right there's just there's something missing to it right and so thank God that we can see with spiritual eyes thank God that we can hear we're spiritual ears because blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they can hear praise God Amen this is an anointing of the Holy Spirit that Believers have but Jesus had it first notice in this story about ananias the fire and Peter Peter didn't see anything that looked wrong Right ananias comes and says I sold the land I want to give this and this and the amount and now look Peter's got the same Holy Ghost Jesus had praise God and he doesn't judge by what he sees naturally he judges by what he sees spiritually and the Holy Spirit showed him that ananias was lying to the Holy Ghost but everything on the outside looked good right it looked religious it looked very close to all the other worshipers who were selling their lands and giving the money to the early church and so we see the the the way we're going to have this spiritual eyesight is to stay in communion with God to stay in the fear of the Lord then we'll see past people's outward appearance and like I said this many times but how many people have we come in here and they leave out to a life of sin or a worldly life on the outside they dress holy on the outside it looks like it's right but then inwardly we find out later God net was never first place to begin with right or they they never really had the Holy Ghost to begin with OR they really didn't love the word like maybe they thought they loved the word see because but we see it with spiritual eyesight praise God we can see it and we're made aware of it and so we've got to have this anointing that Jesus had and Jesus had this anointing in it and it helped him to overcome praise God hallelujah that's going to help us to overcome as well praise God the anointing of the Holy Spirit now notice after this anointing when when when when when when the anointing on Peter moved in such a way it caused everybody else to have fear of the Lord so that's what I want to have as a leader of the church as a pastor I want to be under the anointing so God can do Supernatural through me and then that will raise the fear of everybody in the church praise God like I don't I don't think sister Naomi will mind sharing but I had a dream about sister Naomi a couple weeks ago and it discerned her life right we talked about it out there my wife had a dream I shared it with a friend this week and the friend received it as from the Lord um I didn't ask for the dream I just go to bed you know same way I'd go to bed every night you know um and and uh you know what we want is we want God to move through us you know we can't tell God how to move through us we've just got to be vessels that God can use and then God can use us in whatever way he wants to use us praise God but I feel like that and I know you do too when God does a miracle or God does any Supernatural through somebody it actually raises your fear of the Lord like it makes you want to be a better servant to the Lord that's that's great fear it says moral like in other words when you see God answer a prayer in the church it makes you want to live closer to God hallelujah amen thank God Amen and so this is the anointing of the Holy Spirit now we're constantly under the battle to keep this anointing on us praise God and that's what we daily Endeavor to do well the ram called it the greatest battle ever fought how many would agree with brother Brandon I agree it is without a doubt the greatest battle ever fought to keep your mind focused on the word of God to walk in the fear of the Lord praise God because we're living in laodicea where it's a lukewarm time and every almost everything we see in our phones and our interactions everything we see around us is making us look warm right it's trying to influ try to influence our minds and I didn't say you're so now let me clear that up again it tries to make your mind lukewarm amen not the soul and so everything is is trying to influence you lukewarm in the spirit lukewarm in the mind and don't meditate on God but we we have to break through that and we've got to take time to rub to rub the anointing on us praise God or ask the lord lord rub your anointing on us praise God that we can walk in the fear of the Lord praise God and then when we do that the great fear comes on all of us hallelujah it should spread in a good way praise God hallelujah now I just you know with this these six anointings I just want to revisit this again uh briefly uh Jesus had six anointings on that's a picture from uh Jesus of Nazareth that movie is like a six hour movie or something anyways I just love that movie about Jesus his hair is kind of long in that one I don't know if I'd say his hair was that long but the Bible said here he had six anointings on him or six we'd say attributes of the anointing of the Holy Spirit wisdom understanding counsel might knowledge and the fear of the Lord now remember I'm taking these notes now from 2018. so number six has at least three meanings it means Fallen man and Beast it also means the anointed man and it means measuring time for man right time time that man lives in okay so brother Brown said six is man's day brother random said six is the number of man and so uh beasts were made on the sixth day of creation right uh Jacob as a man served Laban for six years for cattle so we see man and beasts connected in six days of work for a man all right thank God for a day off on Sunday praise God for most of us not me that's okay that's my it's my calling in life uh Revelation 13 18 666. polygamy started in the sixth generation of Cain's descendants um Ahab and Jezebel's daughter reigned for six years before Joe Ash descended to the throne a Hebrew servant would serve for six years but seventh go free now I like this his worth was uh double a blessing I like that his worth was a double a blessing six years they would plant in the field right but then rest on the seventh but like this they got a double blessing on the sixth year see six is a good number some people only 666 is not a good number all the other sixes are good numbers if you're a believer praise God like uh one time Loris Loris you know in a in a funny way he was saying well 13 is not a good number brother Jesse you know it's a number of uh the beasts of Revelation I said well that's true brother I said but there's the other side you had the 12 apostles plus Jesus that's 13. that's a pretty good team there that's a that's an Unstoppable team if Jesus is on your team you're Invincible praise God but it's just showing the point that God works on both sides of the I'm sorry God works on the good side and Satan works on the bad side right Satan takes a number and he perverts it sixth thing the Lord hates proud look that's where we get like makeup and things and and fancy clothes lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood heart devising Wicked imaginations fit or feet swiftly run to Mischief false witness speaking lies and then sowing Discord among brethren it took a job six months to slay all the male which were Esau's descendants in the New Testament it was about the sixth hour when pilate presented Jesus before the Jews of course Fallen man crying away with him crucified there was Darkness from the sixth hour to the ninth hour so Darkness started in the sixth hour which would have been noon The Sixth Seal includes a six-fold wrath upon man earthquake some become Black Moon becomes blood stars fall to Earth how do you remember this servant anybody remember the sermon for a while ago slightly yeah I didn't remember all of it so it was fresh to me now measuring time a foot has two groups of six right six inches but six inches uh Solomon's Temple and the shoe bread had two groups of six as well the common measurements are in groups of six inches 18 inches 24 they're multiples of six thirty thirty six a day has 24 hours or four groups of six uh there's 12 months which is two groups of six time is measured in hours or 60 minutes and then there's 60 seconds in a minute so this all relates to man you can see the sixes the sixth day of creation now here we get to the good part here's where you and I come in praise God the anointed children of God hallelujah man was made in God's image on the sixth day and he was a holy man said he was made on the sixth day of course he had a holy Veil on him right he wasn't he wasn't a sinner Adam hadn't sinned yet Abraham interceded six times for a lot praise God hallelujah on the sixth day Manna would be twice as much to cover the seventh kind of went to that earlier six days the glory of the Lord in a cloud covered Mount Sinai amen and God called unto Moses on the seventh day six branches came out of the one Candlestick three on each side of course it's typed with the middle kennel type the seven Church ages Aaron's ephod had two stones one for each shoulder each had six names of the children of Israel so there you see again two and six shoe bread was two rows of six uh there are six Cities of Refuge the Bible said three on one side of Jordan and three on the Canaan side six days Israel ate unleavened bread for the feast on the seventh there was a solemn assembly see six days of unleavened six days of sanctification amen hallelujah Joshua went about Jericho for six days praise God Ruth was given six measures of barley praise God David did a service and sacrificed oxen every six steps Solomon's Temple has six steps with twelve Lions upon the sixth step so there's two groups of six again Esther was purified by six months of oil then six months of sweet odor she had to be anointed to come in the presence of the king amen hallelujah praise God the anointing the seraphims each had six wings and they were crying what holy holy holy they had anointing of God there's a six-fold blessing Moses is given to give to Israel to bless them to keep them shine upon them the grace upon them the countenance upon them and peace Gabriel had a sixth full visit Hallelujah to Daniel and what was the last one what was the sixth reason out of the six reasons what was the sixth one to anoint the most holy amen hallelujah oh the Bible's an aspired book hallelujah amen hallelujah thank God in the six months of Elizabeth's pregnancy Gabriel visited Mary to conceive the would-be God man Christ Jesus to bring out to conceive the anointed man the fully anointed man that was to come Hallelujah Jesus Miracle changed six pots of water into wine six days before the Passover Mary anointed Jesus's feet the four creatures each had six wings and they were the anointing for each of each of those ages Hallelujah we've got the Flying Eagle anointing thank God Hallelujah the woman at the well had six husbands right but she met the anointed man after that sixth one praise God and Peter went up to pray about the sixth hour then he was anointed to see a great vision praise God there were six men on Mount Transfiguration praise God there are six raptures amen and we go in number five we go in the Rapture of Grace amen hallelujah thank God Amen Israel gets number six praise God hallelujah I'm sorry the two prophets rather the full armor of God has six elements to it the loins gird about with truth the breastplate the feet shod The Shield of Faith the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit praise God the sixth Church age Messenger to Philadelphia was John Wesley he was under the man anointing the anointed man praise God the sixth Church age brother Adam spoke six squirrels into existence he said as a confirmation of his ministry a confirmation that he was God's anointed Prophet but Abraham said on the sixth one he said this will be the six times that you've confirmed it to me Lord the number of man six times I said you won't let me miss him praise God hallelujah amen thank the Lord amen now this applies uh I want to share with I wanted Chris to see this but I guess I guess Leah and uh let's be new to I'm sorry Lena sorry sister Selena Leah and Emma by God's grace but numbers have meanings and numbers mean a lot you know to all of us but to me 11 means a lot to me I feel like 11 is like the last call for me uh in 2002 right after I came in the message uh Bill Tyler now he don't go to message church anymore but he sent me a letter in the mail this is before cell phones and really before we most of us had internet access he said I want to show you the similarities to number 11 in your life well in football I was number 11. my weight when uh when he saw my uh the website was nine plus one plus one was 11. my current weight when I preach this was 164. if you add those up makes 11. I was 163 this morning so I went and drank a kombucha I'm probably 164 right now I was like ah I'm one pound under something's wrong with me I better go drink some kombucha the September 11th attacks made Simon go to The Message Bible say which allowed Bill Tyler to write this to me I received a message in the 11th month and I was born in the 11th month here's the letter he wrote me back in 2002 I'm not going to go through it but he just said I hope and pray that every time you look at your football jersey you'll rejoice in the Lord for the Simplicity of Salvation he's offered to you by his grace Hallelujah there's my picture when he saw it why y'all laughing [Laughter] yeah as many moons ago 2002. that's 20 years ago right 20 years ago yeah 20 years ago so that's what he saw on the website and he said oh I see all the 11s here and of course that's my number so every time I look about that I think God called me to be 11. now Jesus said there were 11th Hour workers so 11 is also the last call and so I realized that uh God called me to be the last one of the last workers praise God the 11th Hour worker and brother Adam says I mean all these quotes there's all these quotes but I'll just go to this one now the seventh Angel's message Revelation 10 7 is to open the mystery of the seals calling the eleventh hour Gentile workers and I'm Gentile to I'm not Jewish to receive the same pay that the first uh workers got by God's grace amen the evening time he says and then there has to be an evening time message and to receive the same thing they did at the beginning the evening time message is to restore back again to bring back that same thing again so Austin I don't know if you saw it but there's all the 11s that this brother recognized about my life many many years 20 years ago by God's grace uh 11th month I was born 11th month I received the message September 11th allowed Simon to receive the message my football number my weight my everything like that so it just kind of goes all together you just look for God in your life now back to Jesus's six anointings Jesus had the anointing of the Holy Spirit but it manifested in six different ways uh the first one was wisdom and they asked Jesus should we pay taxes or not to Caesar and he said give to Caesar what Caesar's but give to God what's God's that was wisdom it showed them what to do with their money and how to do it with their money right they didn't cheat God nor did they cheat Caesar right they they fulfilled or they satisfied both requirements and the people were saying which one we can only satisfy one but Jesus said do both praise God now understanding actually means discernment so when the Bible said Jesus was anointed with the spirit of understanding it meant the spirit of discernment and he discerned both nathanael's Godless Spirit and the woman at the well her sexual immorality was six men so Jesus was able to discern the spirits now Jesus had the spirit of counsel as well now he plainly says it himself I counsel thee and he's talking to us Amen in the laity in church age amen I'm counseling bride of Christ Fellowship to buy gold tried in the fire so by means to hold on to right because the Bible said we can buy it without money or Price amen the Bible says buy the truth and sell it not Hallelujah so his counselors you need to invest in the truth amen by the truth make sure you hang on of anything else hang on to the truth of God's word amen buy gold buy white raiment which is Jesus's righteousness live a holy life amen don't live by your righteousness it'll never work live by the righteousness of Christ amen and anoint your eyes which is with eye Salvage Holy Spirit here it is the sermon that's what he's saying counsel to get the understanding of the Lord I'm counseling you to do this take my advice to take take my counsel here and make sure you have these three also go to this one here you know this is uh I love Jesus I go to Luke 12. I just want to spend a little just a moment on this Luke 12 13. now before we go to this Jesus had the spirit of counsel and I want you to notice Jesus leaves the decision up to this man I'm going to say that again Jesus did not tell this man what to do Jesus left the decision up to him in other words Jesus was letting this man pass the test and the church said there's going to be times God doesn't tell us exactly what to do he's going to leave it up to us to see if we'll pass the test or not look at the scripture here Luke 12 13. Jesus does not tell him how it's all going to work out Jesus didn't tell him about the inheritance this large sum of money he was whether he was going to get it or not now this kind of relates to how we were talking brother right I just thought it was I just thought you know this was interesting it was beautiful and you would think here he's got the fullness of God in him right the fullness of God is in Christ and Jesus doesn't tell him the right decision Jesus just counsels him on his attitude towards the situation now you would think all God Of Heaven would tell you okay do this go say that go say that and you can get your inheritance no Jesus realized this was a test of this man's character like brother Brandon said God doesn't always tell His prophets what do you want what he doesn't tell them everything he doesn't tell them because you've got to have something you've got to overcome you know remember brother Diggs sermon tested for a testimony here this man is being tested for his own testimony he wants to see what are you going to do about it God steps back and say here it's your choice I'm going to give you some counsel but I want to see what are you going to do about it what's your choice going to be about it in this case are you going to covet after the money or you're going to wait on the Lord you have a choice church we have a choice you're either going to covet after things or you're just going to trust God Church let's trust God the holy spirit is here to counsel us to trust him now there now for certain situations there may be situation situations where God makes something so plain to you so clear to you you've got thus saith the Lord on it right there are times like that but I just want to show you there's times that God doesn't tell us what's going to happen he's actually letting us make our own choice and he wants to see what we're going to do about it so Luke 12 13. bless you and one of the companies said to him Master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me in other words give him a thus saith the Lord so I get my half of the money now what does Jesus say Jesus said yes sir I'll go rebuke him right away is that what he said no now could he have done that yes he could have said go get the money it's an officious mouth down there right Church because I got that money saved for you the fish swallowed it it's right there in the fish just like he did with Peter he could have spoken into existence but this was a test for the man not to be Covetous because Jesus was going to give him the right counsel praise God verse 14. they said to him man who made me a judge or divider over you right wow no really Jesus was the judge of all the universe but see we can tell Jesus knows the man's being selfish here he's coming with the wrong motive and objective because he just says well who made me the judge and ruler how do you know it's me how do you know I'm supposed to tell you verse 50 and he said to me take heed and beware of covetousness for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses end quote right that's the end of the story you know he doesn't Jesus doesn't say well here let me catch a vision from the father because I only do without which the father shows me let me get a vision from the father and tell you if you're going to get the money or not no it was a council session teacher sometimes we can't be discouraged if we don't get what we ask for we got it we got to be content with the wisdom and the counsel that God gives us because it may be God's test that we've got to pass right praise God all all the counts of the holy spirit gives this man is just beware that you're not a Covetous person I'm not going to force them to give you the money I'm not going to force you to get the inheritance I'm not going to force it to happen I'm not going to do what you ask me to do this time I'm gonna let you decide I'm going to let the events of this decision manifest if your spirit was right or not I'm not going to give you the direct answer on this one Hallelujah you would think my or if Jesus was really anointed he'd give me that inheritance right now no not exactly no he was fully anointed praise God Christ was fully anointed the fullness of the godhead bodily drought in him so but the spirit knew in this case God is going to test this man and he's going to say just give him counsel make him beware that he doesn't have a Covetous sinful heart see sometimes Church the voice of God is so gentle sometimes the voice of God is just saying be careful about your next step you know sometimes we think you know every service has to be like Wednesday night or you know or other services where God has dropped down and we feel the presence of God so strongly but there's times where we may just hear the counsel of God and it's still the same Holy Spirit not a different spirit this was not a weaker Jesus or a lesser it's the same Christ Hallelujah so in other words we have to be humble enough to accept the word of God in every situation and recognize God's spirit moving in every situation so I just thought that would be a blessing that really struck me this morning when I was studying I was like oh that's a beautiful thought that the holy spirit gives us counsel and sometimes he doesn't tell us exactly what to do so here we don't actually here we don't get any real like a wisdom direction do this do that go get the money here no it's just counsel beware that your heart doesn't become covetous Hallelujah so I wonder the next few Services here if God will just give us a beware sermon and that that would be fully annoying to the Holy Spirit just be aware not to do this beware not to let your heart get overcharged with the things of the world and it can be the same holy spirit that could heal the sick raise the dead give us a prophecy give us a dream amen hallelujah the same Holy Spirit would be able to give us the word of counsel that we have need of for the hour my this is what we all long to see praise God Amen we all enjoy when God moves in strength and mighty Deeds the Bible said he was mighty indeed and word before God Emma when she said she got the Holy Ghost in here didn't you say you felt a wind sister who has felt that wind in here hallelujah that's a beautiful day thank God Amen it's the might of God it's God's Mighty power blowing through his people amen hallelujah and we don't know when it's going to blow but I just suggest be here because it's going to happen sometime amen hallelujah because Christ is welcome here other churches he's kicked out of the church but Jesus is invited in here he's the guest of honor this morning amen Glory Jesus miracles his might was unparalleled and cannot be matched I don't care what anybody says they're not going to do any Greater Works than Jesus because it isn't them doing the Greater Works anyway it's Christ doing the Greater Works nobody's going to do greater than Jesus not a scripture on that in the Bible now his knowledge in John 7 they hear Jesus preach and they say how knoweth this man these things how does this man have the knowledge and the Bible said Jesus said I did not get my Doctrine from man I got my Doctrine from above so there was an anointing on Christ he didn't have to go to Bible school he just had to go in the presence of God and God would show him the knowledge of God the truth of God's word and the men marveled how does he know this how does he know it it's an anointing that makes you know it praise God and sixth and finally the fear of the Lord Jesus's moral reverence is unmatched as well no man would ever will ever serve God like Christ did he always pleased the father and the Bible said he even submitted himself to the death of the cross this was an anointing that was on him Hallelujah now I'm not going to spend much time on this but I started to see a little bit of similarities between the anointings and then the six uh pieces of the armor of God like I can see how wisdom is like a mind gird about with truth and I can see how might is like the spirit sword of the spirit right it's power and the shield of faith is like kind of like the fear of the Lord right because when you have the shield of Faith you're not getting hit by the enemy's darts amen you're not giving in to the sinful attacks the church said if you pull up your Shield you get you get attacked you you set yourself up to be infected with sin right but when you got the fear of the Lord you depart from Evil praise God now all the other ones so I I saw like four similarities I guess one two three yeah four similarities and I'm not really ready to preach that full thought but I think it's a beautiful thought praise God I do now like Jesus church we must Delight in God's word and I know you do because you sit through all these long sermons you sing all these wonderful songs with our brother praise God you wouldn't come here three times a week if you didn't Delight in God's word but what we have to remind remember is that we need to Delight in God's word every day and that's why we come here so to encourage us to do it every single day and church then there are times where even me all of us we maybe don't feel like coming to church I don't expect you to say Amen on that way there's sometimes I'm feeling sick or I'm really tired I really don't feel like coming I'd rather take a nap and call off can we get a substitute for tonight here foreign we all be like that at times but we must remember that that we need God's help to renew our strength we need God's help to remove renew our minds every day so that the word of God is more delightful than the next YouTube video right the word of God is more delightful than the next podcast or whatever we might Delight in or the next raise we get on the job you know or the next unexpected Financial blessing in which we blame God for but we got to make sure God's word is our number one divide praise God it's a joy of our life like I said that's why I started getting up at 4 30. now I'm getting up at four I'm just waking up at four every morning I want to make sure God's word is my delight now I like it too because it makes me go to bed earlier so I'll do like that praise God I want to make sure I say that Hallelujah I need to get better earlier now here's what it says about Christ Praise You the Lord blessed is the man that feared the Lord greatly in the commands Hallelujah his seed shall be Mighty on the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed wealth and riches shall be in his health and and his righteousness endureth forever of course this is speaking of Christ the seed of Christ the children of Christ would be blessed and they're Mighty in word hallelujah they're Mighty indeed amen but this also applies to the Natural man so I didn't get I didn't get time to look this up but Jonathan Edwards was a mighty preacher in the 1800s and they trace his descendants I shared it maybe last year but there was like uh like there was one vice president in his lineage there was like 50 preachers in his lineage there was like 40 lawyers and there was like a 30 University presidents in other words this man loved God so much the Bible said that he delighted so much in the word of God that the blessing went from him to the Next Generation and that's all we have responsibility for church is our lives and the Next Generation praise God I'm going to preach on David and Solomon Lord willing pretty soon Church David did most of the hard work he stored up all the stones all the iron all the wood he stored up all most of all these things and he didn't even live to see what he was storing up for church that might be us we might not live to see the Rapture but if we're faithful like David then our Our Generation after or the generation after that or of Generations on down the line if we're faithful then one of these Generations will will see the coming of the Lord they'll be blessed because of our dedication amen as we're blessed by our brother branham's dedication Hallelujah and Paul an iranius and Martin and Luther and Columbo Hallelujah Wesley and each one we're blessed because of previous generations staying true to the word of God but we've got to make sure the Commandments of God are our Delight Hallelujah so we're looking at the Delight and of course this David wrote this this is speaking of Christ blessed is the man that walketh not in the cons of the ungodly think of that Jesus never took a bad advice from anybody the devil said Bow Down and Worship me he wouldn't take the devil's advice God help us not to take the devil's advice oh get back at that person or I'll show you how to do this I'll show you I'll show you how to do this this uh this dishonest deal here God help us to take the counsel of Christ amen blessed is a man who nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sinneth than to see the scornful his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night oh constantly he's thinking about the word in the morning he's thinking about the word at noon time he's thinking about the word at night that's what we must be our Delight must be in the law of God hallelujah and he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leave also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper what a promise Hallelujah see Church remember I showed you that picture let me go back and show Emma because she could you see it on Wednesday night okay uh the the image that they give us in the Bible is uh the fear of the Lord is like a spring or a fountain of waters this is the gihan spring it's under uh Mount Zion it's under Mount Zion or Mount Moriah rather in Israel so Hezekiah uses spring lots of lots of saints use this spring and of course it's down and under here so this is going up to the Mount Moriah the Temple mount uh where's my other picture uh there it is so the Bible said the the fear of God is like this spring of water it's life but you can't but you're never going to have wisdom unless you stay planted in the fear of the Lord so this is the imagery of our life we're like the trees Christ was the Holy tree praise God Amen Christ was the tree that was planted by rivers of a living water he did not sit in the Council of the Pharisees just like we don't sit in the Council of Baptists or Presbyterian amen thank God I used to amen thank God I don't praise God but we sit in the Council of the Holy Spirit praise God and we pull from the fear of the Lord how many are you drawing from the fear of the Lord today praise God you're drinking in the power of the holy spirit in the fear of the Lord I'm gonna I'm gonna reverence God's word I'm going to keep God's word when you draw that in then you produce the fruits of the spirit Hallelujah that's a good visual there the only way we'll get to the wise life the only way we'll get to the principal thing wisdom is by drawing on the fear of the Lord drawing it in and make sure we're rooted and grounded in Christ's love amen glory amen rooted in gardening in Christ's love I can't promise I'll get to the right slide here thank you for your patience here yeah there we go so this speaks of both David also Christ and also us well we've got to keep the word of God in our mind all the time that's what I love about making YouTube videos or just being a preacher I've always got three or four different thoughts kind of turning in my mind you know this week I put out four reasons I don't have a Christmas tree I just put that up video I got some good feedback on that amen hallelujah also put out uh I could put a podcast out a solo one last week about these questions that a preacher asked me about brother Branham and so I was defending the message there got a lot of good feedback on that but that's what I love about being a preacher I I just I have to I have to stay with new fresh thoughts all the time I always got like three or four uh wheels turning you know I guess I guess it's like a vehicle yeah right I got four wheels turned on all the time so I always got like four thoughts I got four Series going right four or five series going at the same time uh but I love that because it just makes me meditate I'm always looking for a fresh thought I'm always looking for fresh Revelation praise God and my mind and your mind meditates on the things of God oh it's a blessing church it's such a blessing to meditate on the things of God why would we meditate on on on on on any sin why would he meditate on destruction why would we meditate on failure why would we meditate uh on hatred why would we meditate on these things when we can meditate on the word of God hallelujah the promises of God thank God Hallelujah my that's how I tell my children we were reading a about the church ages last night and I love reading about these men and women that gave their lives I love reading about Martyrs my because with pilot carp he was a hundred and they said part of the car weird they're going to kill you or kill all the Christians the polycarp has 100 year old man he stepped forward and said kill me now what a man of God right there I'd rather you take my life than take their lives and while he was walking and we read it a couple weeks ago while he was walking to the stake they said denounce Christ and die denounce Christ that was Christ and you'll live yeah live rather and he said I've served Jesus Christ for 80 some years and he has been he's done nothing but good to me how could I deny him in my last moment amen thank God Amen amen and they they lit the fire it wouldn't burn him right so then they stabbed him with the spear all the blood gushed out and put out the fire right and so then they uh they killed him and then they chopped him up burned them up and took all the ashes and threw it in the in the river because he was so much like Christ they didn't want his disciples to say that he raised from the dead because he was so much like Jesus a church that Inspire us that ought to inspire us no matter what we're going through we're not going to the stakes yet we're not being burned to Stakes God help us not to compromise on any word of God praise God these are our forefathers these are the ones that fear God and generations past let us make our Delight in the law of the Lord praise God if the law of the Lord kept them in their squeeze hour it'll keep us in our squeeze our amen Glory delight yourself right at Christ Fellowship in the Lord and he shall give Thee the desires of thine heart Delight means to be happy about be happy about the word now I know it cuts you sometimes but but after you apply that balm and Gilead then you're happy again that's what brother Adam said the word preaches like a sword when it chops you up or Cuts you up oh that hurt but then you pray say God forgive me and then God puts on the bomb of Gilead the healing ointment that helps you that helps your heart heal and then with love you can say thank you Lord even though I came to church and I was I was rebuked by the Holy Spirit I was corrected by the Holy Spirit I still love you praise God my delight is still in the law of the Lord amen be happy about the Lord and He Shall give thee desires of thine heart make Mary that's why we've got to have a dance service right here you got to make Mary I know church every time I've danced when I'm led by the Holy Spirit I have so much victory that next week a better victory in prayer there's something about it right it's victory dance is Victory praise God there's something about that when you make God your your Delight when you worship and thank God even when you don't see it it's an Act of Faith and it raises your faith it puts the anointing of God on you praise God and church don't forget God inhabits the Praises of his people praise God Hallelujah God lives in that praise God lives in those moments when you're just worshiping him like his child and thanking him for every perfect gift he's the perfect heavenly father he's given you everything you have need of he says make me your Delight praise God commit your way roll your way roll away all your burdens right commit your way unto the Lord roll it away Pat doesn't sound familiar cast your cares upon the Lord for he cares for you why would we hold it why would he hold on to all of our burdens why would he hold on to the cares of the world let's roll them away let's commit our way unto the Lord trust also in him be confident in him he shall bring it to pass Hallelujah he'll bring it to pass in his time and season God will move upon your request but again we've got to trust that God's decision for our life is better than our hopes and desires and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noon day so what is it about noon or what is it about the light it's powerful right it's bright it's going to get brighter out there we're going to reach the Pinnacle of the of the light today right and that's what the Bible says when you commit and cast your cares on the Lord commit your way to God then he makes your day he makes your righteousness like that Sunshine out there right now praise God hallelujah amen to that thank God that's exactly the truth make happy make Mary about the Lord he'll make you shine like the Noonday praise God hallelujah Darkness will not cover your life the light of God will cover your life amen that's when we Delight in the Lord we ought to be happy all day about the Lord praise God now I just want to you know with all those number sixes I showed you I just want to show you again you know we can never I've learned I can never limit God I've always got to be looking for more Revelation just when I think I might have something figured out then there's something else that throws me off and okay I don't know only God knows what I mean by that is that uh we cannot limit the Holy One of Israel cannot limit Jesus right God is Without Limits the Bible says now notice there's diversities of gifts but it's the same spirit every gift is a little different there are differences of administrations or services or Ministries in other words like brother man I said one Divine Healing Ministry is different from another right that means One Pastor might be different than another pastor there's diversities of operation different way they work different workings of the spirit but the same God that works all in all and the way to know it's God is if at first lines up with the word and then it has good results amen yeah that's right that's how you know if it's God but Ram actually said it like this he said first I'll show it in a moment he said first get in the spirit he said then get a revelation then look for in the word and then look at the results that it bears and brother amen shared that about getting the spirit a couple months ago right and you and your wife so it's the spirit that creates all these continents they're all complementary in other words one Christian is going to be happy for another Christian when they have their gifts operating right or when they're when they're serving in their Ministry one Christian is going to be so happy like when I see Austin singing and playing I bought on that guitar or we got on that guitar it just makes me so happy I couldn't be more happy praise God see a mouth guy play there you know just Lydia each one finding your little gifts of the kids singing a special our God is tremendous you know whatever when we're using our gifts we all Rejoice because all the gifts help one another they all complement each other they all build each other up it's the same Spirit same anointing praise God one Spirit operating in different ways but it all brings about the right results so I just made this just as a just as a simple visual there's one Holy Ghost right but he's got five preaching gifts why five why not seven well I don't know I can't limit God he's got six pieces of armor there are six anointings on Jesus why not seven I don't know all I know is I'm not gonna limit God there's one Holy Ghost but there's seven Holy Spirits the Bible said seven fires Before the Throne but right brother said that's one that's the Holy Spirit Ministry to each of the seven Church ages so it's the same Holy Spirit but God had to send uh a different little characteristic of it to every age right and what's our what's our experience for today be zealous and repent and say hot for Jesus and the church said don't be lukewarm this is not the time to be lukewarm delight yourself in the Lord amen be happy in the Lord praise God Amen be happy in the Lord Seven eyes of course Jesus said those seven spirits roaming the Earth Holy Spirit seven horns seven Powers seven Messengers seven attributes in the Statue of man and then there's the eighth charity why why eight I don't know brother I don't know sister I don't know brother I can't limit God how come there's nine fruits of the spirit and not seven I don't know God's got a different God can do whatever he wants praise God I'm just learning how much little I do know about God but I want to meditate I want to Delight in this word I want to think about it all day praise God all day all day and night no I've been trying to get down to the base place to close here I never set a timer okay well that's all right I rarely keep it anyway right if I should say that here Brad I never had to laugh on that yeah I want to add some more I didn't have enough time uh well you know I always get I just tell my wife you'll say sometimes like this during the studying it just flows flows flows I said hallelujah thank you God I have so much and sometimes I'm just like waiting on the Lord like I'm really trying to scratching my head I'm not sure which way to go with this so yesterday I was one of those scratching the head days you know but anyways I trust has been a blessing to you so far by God's grace I just felt like it maybe maybe it was different than that but that's you know can't trust your feelings uh the fear of the Lord has learned now this is ought to help us out a lot here this is a beautiful scripture now God's talking to Israel church but we know we can see the spiritual element to this what nation is there so great who hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord Our God in all things is in all things that we call upon him for now think about a church what church is there like our church is there any denomination of church like our church who has God so nigh unto them I believe answer is no on that why because we've been to other churches and we don't see God there we don't see God Discerning counseling we don't see just worldly Council sinful things so first of all consider how blessed you are because God Is So Close To You amen thank God Amen Jesus Christ is not outside of our church he's the welcome guest as we already said he's the Lord of this church he's the real pastor of this church amen he's the real evangelist in this church Jesus is but God had Moses tell the people only take heed to yourself see you can't force anybody to be saved he said you take care of yourself you live such a life you have such a life of let the light of God shine a Noonday amen through your life take heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thy thine eyes have seen don't forget all those testimonies God's given you Hallelujah all the times you've seen God move I know that's God be careful do not forget those testimonies lest they look they depart from your heart all the days of our life see we can't forget all those times God like we said with isolation God sometimes is going to isolate you just to see if you will you'll you'll trust him and just remember all the things he has done even when it seems like even when I don't feel it he's working you know I mean that's a good sign that's true that's true but there's times when you don't really see it or feel it and God wants you to in those times remember the good times well remember the times when God was moving strongly or more actively if you don't Church they're going to depart out of your life and that's when the Bible says you'll for you you'll forget you were even forgiven in second Peter chapter one if you don't do those statutory man if you don't live the gospel live under that anointing you're going to forget all those testimonies that God did in your life by God's grace he won't let us forget praise God I won't say me it's not that I won't let you forget it's the holy spirit that won't let us forget that's right he says and teach them to thy sons and thy Sons Sons especially the day that thou serves before the Lord thy God when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I'll make them hear my words now I forgot to bold this but that's why I wanted to bold just so you know that they may what learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children so I'm glad the Holy Spirit had me revisit this topic because it was greatly uh greatly thanks I guess over the numerous testimonies that we got because we should all know in our hearts today I'm here to learn to fear God more I want to fear God more so I don't forget about him in other words you should be here not to not to necessarily pick apart my mistakes I know you don't do that I'm just trying to give you an example you know we're here to learn of God Amen thank God Amen we're here to learn how to fear God how to morally reverence him that's why we're here how can I obey God more in my daily life how can I meditate on the things of God more and I found it getting up early reading praying singing you know when I wash dishes or whatever I just put on the music I just try to sing and give God praise and stay under that atmosphere standard that anointing by God's grace I need to learn I'm still learning I'm still learning how to fear the lord in my life and that's what God told Moses you tell those people remind them to fear God all the days of their life that they will learn to fear me and that they will teach their children teach the Next Generation how to fear God as well Hallelujah and of course church this is a choice you have to make every person today you're either going to leave out of here like brother Brian said to remind us of brother Adam's quote you're going to leave out of here a better Christian or worse right you can't say you can't say the same and the Bible says that in Proverbs one remember in Proverbs 1 lady wisdom is crying out uh to the streets and inviting anyone to come in and hear the word of God but the Bible said they turned her down so then in verse 28 then shall they call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but shall not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord they did not choose it they would none of my counsel they despise all my reproof a church I'll say it again like I said last Sunday I think if we're not mistaken a real child of God doesn't mind being corrected by the word of God if you tell them something they're wrong on or something they could improve a real child of God isn't going to get mad at you now they might in the flesh but once they get back in their soul they're going to thank you for it the Bible said they'll love you if you correct them Hallelujah every time brother Brooks had to correct me or anytime brother Craig had to correct me in a Bible study or anything I said oh praise the Lord I appreciate that thank you Hallelujah or even simple things like brother amen requested last year you know can you uh can you uh I think you said can you ask if you have a leading of the Lord right after the song service and so I've done that see now I try to model that as an example if I can learn then you can learn to we all can learn by the Holy Spirit and that's how we know we love each other the Bible says when we submit ourselves one to another right when we're patient with one another loving long-suffering praise God that's how we know we love each other the Bible said therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices that ought to encourages praise God if we're living the right way we know God's going to feed us the right fruit praise God if we're planting the right seeds hallelujah we're going to reap the right Harvest hallelujah amen that's what Paul said he said I he said I don't guess I have a crown he said I know I've got a crown of righteousness amen it's laid up for me and all those that love God's appearing praise God he's like I'm not guessing if I have any fruits he knew he had fruits of the spirit praise God he knew he had fruits and rewards that were laid up for him in heaven praise God I'm coming up on an hour so here let me set a five minute timer I'll try to close here Hallelujah yeah so here I think I'll close to this now let me escape real quick I think there was another thing I wanted to show yeah those are all just notes all right so bear with me here oh yeah yeah let me do this too I'm sorry I got a couple more things here okay now this is how we know God is talking to us if we don't hear a voice and even if your voice you got to check it by the word right brother Adam said I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life see in the spirit means if you're the Lord right because that's part of the Holy Spirit if we're going to live as Christians we have to be in his spirit so in his Spirit we have to be in his Spirit of Godly fear John was not talking about being in his own spirit I don't want to be in the spirit of Jesse Smith right that's that's going to fail me every time it's going to be discouraging it's going to be sad it's going to be whatever that would happen not brought about these Visions it had to be the spirit uh of God it had to be the spirit of God with us too or all of our efforts are in vain think about that all the efforts of uh denominations or even message churches is in vain unless they're in the Holy Spirit Paul said I'll pray in the spirit I'll sing in the spirit I'll live in the spirit how important is for brother amen a song leader to be in the Holy Spirit when he leads songs how important it is for me to be in the holy spirit before I preach the word of God Hallelujah if there is anything everybody's everybody say the word anything ready and if there's anything that will come to you that's good it must be first revealed by the Holy Spirit you must get a revelation from the spirit and then two you must confirm it by the word and three it will be made manifest by the results it bears as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous Revelations fresh from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit Glory so these are three easy steps right to know you're hearing God's voice this is a good way to know you're in the fear of the Lord well brother Jesse you know I'm in the fear of the Lord or even myself I'm in the fear of the Lord but this decision to make well here's what you do first get in the spirit get in the fear of the Lord or the joy of the Lord same it's the same spirit and then wait till God gives you a revelation but then you're not done oh I feel something I just thought of something oh this is not a dream right a vision or I heard something preach it was a revelation you're not done yet everybody say not done yet not done yet you're not done yet whatever comes to you we must test it by the word of God make sure it lines up line for line with the word of God here little there little right line upon line and then sometimes we won't know until after we make the decision and then we can see this was let of God or not let of God it's made manifest by the results that it bears Hallelujah and so for me you know as a pastor it's very easy for me to see this I'll come and preach something and then I'll look at the results that it bears in our lives that's what I love about being a pastor by the way hallelujah or just a preacher in general I can see the results now sometimes they're immediate sometimes they're not but over the course of you know years of ministry I can see the results your lives like rubber band said your lives are the proof of the ministry my preaching has produced by preaching by the word of God has produced the Amen in ahuah right or my children or each family here the preaching has produced the life that you live and so as a preacher I thank God for that I can look at the fruit of my constant Ministry but each one of us can look at the fruit of our decision making praise God and then we can know did we hear the voice of God on that we really hear the voice like that isolation I was driving home from Indiana and the word just came to me isolation just came isolation right and I saw the results that at Bower praise God hopefully it was a blessing to people I know it seemed like it was for what people said and so we have these steps by God's grace now I'm going to close okay so let's end with this summary here now I might have left some I know I left Proverbs too I remember Proverbs 2 on Wednesday the Bible said if you want to understand the fear of the Lord you have to cry out and lift your voice to God in church you don't it can be it could be in your car you can cry out to God any location any location cry out to God say God I need wisdom I need understanding I'm I'm asking you give me give me Grace to know which way to go give me Grace how to work this out how do I solve this and if you cry out to God the Bible said you'll find the fear of the Lord you'll find the knowledge of the Lord so fear is found through dedicated prayer right or just calling out to God fear is your anointing and the church said fear is your moral reverence and honor for God's word that's really what the word means morally reverencing God morally honoring God with obedience fear is also you're confident when you're obeying God's word you're not disobedient you have confidence in God if our hearts condemn us not amen we know we shall have what we ask for praise God fear is also your place of safety enough and that's funny to say that fear is your place of safety because we think of instantly human fear right but it's the fear of the Lord more obedience in other words obedience is your place of safety fear is your prerequisite sorry prerequisite for wisdom fear is your Fountain of Life fear is also your choice amen Hallelujah fears a conclusion about your life's purpose fear is your lesson you must learn I'm not sure how many more things fear could be I know there's more I didn't get to them fear is your path to Blessings and fear is your path to being praised by God because the Bible said a woman that fears the Lord shall be praised brother Graham said there's nothing more humans like than to hear their voice announced before people and recognize and this you know you don't have to say Amen to that but that's true that's why all the musicians like this to fill up the stadiums and oh Taylor Swift or Jay-Z like they love to hear their name called in front of people who doesn't but there will be no greater calling of a name right than the marriage supper the Lambs right when what the Bible says when we stand before the Judgment seat of Christ for rewards given out to us Hallelujah he that feareth the Lord she that fears the Lord shall be praised and Jesus is going to praise Us by saying well done well done good and faithful servant so fear is what a lot of things fear is foundational you need that at the beginning of your walk but I'm going to say fear is something you need even if you're a mature Christian without a doubt and I didn't even get to all the scriptures so there might be a part three all right let's stand in our feet musicians can come now just so you know you can
