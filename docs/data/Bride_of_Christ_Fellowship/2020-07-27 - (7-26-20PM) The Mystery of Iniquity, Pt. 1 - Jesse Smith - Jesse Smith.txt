bibles here let's go to second thessalonians chapter two if you would let's stand for the reading of god's word let's start at verse one i like to look at the other mystery another mystery rather i like to look at the mystery of iniquity tonight by god's grace i want to start these two mysteries the will of god and iniquity you know the scripture says the seventh angel is the finish the mystery of god so all these mysteries that are cause reason i will not be finished at the end time and thank god they are praise god ii thessalonians chapter 2. i want to read one uh one to eight let me read one to six and then we'll read seven and eight together by god's grace i'll read one to six now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand if it was at hand 2000 years ago where are we at today he said don't let anybody shake you up in your mind right because we know the day of christ is at hand verse three let no man deceive you by any means that's why we gotta be really careful what other preachers say right preachers friends family members we gotta be very careful don't do not let any man deceive you by any means for that day speaking of the day of christ shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that's called god or that is worship so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time see he has his time but church it's our time now praise god it's our time now it's the bride's time now to be united with christ now let's read seven and eight together one two three for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto god by raising our hand or raising our heart to heaven heavenly father we bow our heads in honor of you lord god you're our true headship dear god we look to you we bow our heads physically but we're looking to you spiritually god be our head be our headship guide us lead us lord direct us father strengthen us tonight as we look to your word lord anoint me to preach your word to receive it myself and also the people of god feed their hungry souls lord god and lord may you be exalted lord prepare us for thy coming as your mystery is finished and lord let us take the mystery and eat it lord god and let us become one with it lord as we digest it lord god and learn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and father we'll be giving you giving you all the glory in jesus christ's name and the church said amen god bless you being seated praise god the mystery of iniquity lord willing will look at this here forgive me about 40 minutes here and then we'll go switch over to the testimony by god's grace [Music] this is the opposite of the statue perfect man so the statutory for man is the mystery of godliness how we become and grow more like god so iniquity is the exact opposite how many people will grow to be more like satan because satan is the father of iniquity and so i thought it'd be important after we started or after we finished rather the status perfect man to show this mystery so this is a mystery which is something that's hidden that most people don't understand and in the book you know chapter 9 is the mystery of babylon chapter 10 is the mystery of iniquity so once we identify mystery babylon the mother harlot and the daughters and how rome is mother protestants daughters it once it makes you investigate how does this mother-daughter team attract its members because right now by numbers they have over 2 billion members catholics have 1.2 billion and then protestants are about 800 000 i'm sorry 800 million rather that's by the 2010 numbers uh how do they attract that many people two billion people in catholicism and protestantism they do it through the deceitfulness of iniquity because that's what the scripture says it's a deceitfulness now i want to read verse 10 in chapter 2 second thessalonians 2 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness the scripture says in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved verse 11 for this cause god shall send them a strong delusion that they shall believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now remember this morning i remember this morning god writes his laws in every human conscience the law of god is written in their conscience and then god manifests himself to every human being but the mystery of this is how how could god send people to hell he would do it because they they silence the voice of god in them right they silence the holy thirst of god within them and they purposely choose the pleasure of unrighteousness so see their lives they have to start out somehow having a holy thirst or some point they have to have a desire to know god and they know better they know better but they choose to hush that holy thirst and they choose to satisfy it with the unholy thing and so it's deceivableness so they're purposely deceived and church we all know what that's like right we've all purposely chosen the wrong thing sometime right if we're honest with ourselves when we've sinned it's because well we knew better most the time most the time we knew better so see we were deceived so the same thing applies here to those who are the workers of iniquity they know the truth but yet because they accept a lie they're deceived by it they accept that they're deceived and then if they don't escape that then the bible says they grow in iniquity they become more and more sinful and church the worst state the absolute worst state someone could be in is a state of strong delusion it's the reprobate mind in other words god has wiped his hands and he of that person and he no longer will deal with them we know that that's the absolute worst condition people could ever be in is they'd have a reprobate mind that god has disapproved of and he's wiped their hands of it and yet the bible says here that uh they loved it the bible said they had pleasure in unrighteousness god god hastened the day that everyone in our church cannot live happily in sin praise god in other words let me say this may the holy spirit convict us with such strong conviction that we can't enjoy sin for very long at all amen but the bible said they have pleasure in it they enjoy the iniquity so this is the opposite of where we should be growing in the stature of a perfect man so the roman catholic church and protestants as our sister karen and i were talking about methodists some methodist churches not all of them but some of them they're the ones who are propagating the iniquity by saying it's okay to enjoy this sin and so we accept this kind of sin the church so see they're propagating it they're spreading it to every nation and so that's how the mother daughter works the mother's the mother harlot you know she uh she started it but then it repeats in her daughters and it's absolutely the truth iniquity church means contempt which means you despise it to contempt and violation of the law wickedness so iniquity means you have a contempt for the truth of god's word so let's always be careful of our attitudes right because the even when david when david committed adultery the bible said he he had contempt for the word of god so david must have looked he must have knew the scripture not to take another man's wife but in that moment of passion he had contempt for that scripture and he said i don't care what it says i'm going to take bathsheba the bible said that nathan said he had contempt for the word of god in second samuel 12 mercy so iniquity is lawlessness it's purposely sinning despite knowing god's will because remember god writes his will his laws in our consciences church it's mentioned over 300 times in scripture if you look up the word iniquity over 300 times in the scripture it is a well covered topic in the scripture iniquity is listed again and again and again and paul says this mystery was already working around 50 a.d that was less than 20 that was less than uh 20 years after christ's resurrection it was already working now let me uh go to my definition of this mystery just so i can have it uh so you can hear it the revelation of the mystery of iniquity is the antichrist spirit fills and deceives the hellbound majority into blaspheming god's truth under the guise or mask of a sin-loving religious experience that's a lot of words there that's a lot in there but that's the revelation of it because there's only two spirits how many how many with me there's a holy spirit and then there's the unholy spirits now they take different names right they have different jobs you know the spirit of fear uh spirit of infirmity right all these different spirits but they're all the same nature right and so the antichrist spirit we would just say is just that wrong spirit the unholy spirit and that fills and deceives the majority of people and they blaspheme god's word and yet it allows them to have a sin loving experience while sitting in church and my prayer is this as you know it too god i don't care how small our church needs to be keep all the iniquity out of our church i don't care how small i don't care i don't care how small the church how big it gets what we want is we want all the sin out of our church and i'll be happy i can i can sleep at night praise god you can sleep at night we can have peace with god when we know our lives are clean and when we know the church is clean because church if our lives are not clean if the church is not clean then the bible says we're a lump of leaven leavened bread right that means we people won't get healed people won't get saved people won't be helped if there is unconfessed in the church the bible said it it uh it spreads like leaven remember paul said cut the leaven out kick it out of the church right purge the church i was pre i was reading about john wesley yesterday and he was known for purging people out of their churches he was known for that if someone wasn't living a sanctified life he took him out of the fellowship he said don't come back to get your life cleaned up that ought to help us examine ourselves so see this iniquity spirit this antichrist spirit was already working i forgot to set my watch now church here here we are two 000 years later but the spirit of iniquity mr of iniquity is going to head up in the antichrist person we know it's going to be a future pope if not this pope now for me i hope god carries a little bit so all my children can grow up and get the holy ghost and but if their names are on the book and the rapture comes they'll go praise god we just have to believe that because we don't have any other answers that's what brother that's brother adam's answer so see iniquity is a lifestyle then it's a habitual lifestyle of sin it's loving sin yet having a religious kind of testimony so church this honor we this ought to really help us examine ourselves praise god because all of us i can look out here everybody comes to church everybody is religious so we're getting into your habits right we have to get into our habits because that's what iniquity is bad habits it's purposely having contempt for god's word and not obeying it yet having a church experience remember the bible said lukewarm is way worse than cold right it's jesus says it's better to be cold than to be lukewarm right so we must remain on fire for god amen now i want to look at a few scriptures so occasionally if you could pull up a few uh genesis 15 16 please if you can pull that up there this shows the joshua led israeli army drove out the amorites once their cup of iniquity was full in god's eyes when the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full praise god and now could you pull up joshua 10 12. see what is god basing this on he's basing upon how much iniquity people have committed god's judgment is based he's measuring their judge their sins and when it gets to a certain amount where it's too much then he pours out the judgment joshua 10 12. then speak joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel he sent the sight of israel's son stand thou still upon the gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilent church this is when the amorites finally got defeated it was when joshua spoke something and the bible said god has never hearkened to a man before or after like joshua's voice amen god was using joshua to pour out the cup of iniquity god was saying i'm done they've had their chance and he's pouring out judgment see god is measuring iniquity look at church we're either going to be we're going to be filling up something right we're going to be filled with something either the holy spirit or are you full of iniquity that's the only way god can judge and that's that's how everyone's life is seen you're either filled with the fruits of god filled with the love of god the blessings of god or filling up with iniquity that's one example lot and his two daughters narrowly escaped god's fire and brimstone upon sodom and it was poured out due to the iniquity of the city that was in uh genesis 19 15. can you pull that up there i just kind of want to lay a little foundation here iniquity so amorites and now sodom and gomorrah iniquity genesis 19 15. and when the morning arose then the angels hastened saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city so homosexuality iniquity unconfessed and god judges it now the set now the strange part is or the maybe surprising part is jesus said it will be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrah with the iniquity of homosexuality than for the generation of pharisees and sadducees that rejected christ that's striking it'd be more tolerable for just violent homosexuals than it would be for the the religious people that turned down the mighty miracles of jesus christ aren't you glad you've accepted him praise god amen i'm so glad i'm on his side amen praise god that we shun iniquity we show the things of the world like i was telling sister karen i read the church age book yesterday brother brahm said shun the denominations like you shunned the plague and i thought coronavirus so i said it's okay to shun the chronovirus it's okay to quarantine right it's okay it's okay to wear a mask if you have to it's okay to uh get a test it's okay to keep your six feet if you were if you're shunning the plague he said you do that but we ought to shun that antichrist even more praise god even more praise god remember mystery babylon is destroyed in revelation 18 because her iniquities are remembered in heaven oh i'm so glad that the blood of jesus christ wipes out my sins in heaven praise god that there's no remembrance of them praise god see see church that should be our prayer god help me not to get the spot where i love to commit sin help me lord to not have pleasure in unrighteousness because they go from they go from iniquity to inequity right the bible says it plainly they go from deception to deception they go just further and further and it starts in the churches remember that parable jesus told that woman the woman slipped in three measures of leaven at the beginning but you didn't see it right the beginning you don't see the leaven of that woman that mother harlot you don't see the results of it till later and historically you know just by the history she slipped in the eucharist she slipped in the idol worship right at the beginning she then the trinity came a little late around 300 a.d that wasn't the first thing that was it started way before that but that eventually now look what they got and now look with every trinitarian church that loves the catholic the catholic system look look what it's produced now such iniquity but see the holy spirit produces righteousness amen amen it produces holiness amen it helps us to do the will of god amen amen now church we will commit sin a single acts of iniquity despite knowing better but we would we should always come to repentance and change our future behaviors can i give you an example here's a good example this is a good one joseph's brothers did they know better when they sold them out did they know they should not have sold their brother yeah they were grown men yet after they repented they never sold joseph again right they couldn't but then what the bible's saying revelation the bible said that all those 12 sons all had crowns in heaven you have 24 elders amen 12 of the apostles and though 12 sons of jacob praise god see they they committed iniquity they sold out their brother they wanted some of them wanted him to die but god was merciful they repented and jesus gives them crowns in heaven amen glory david committed iniquity by taking bathsheba he numbered israel but repented and he never repeated those sins paul said he committed evil sinful acts he hated that's what i like right there he hated he said that which i do i hate praise god and he says this assures believers jesus blood forgives all their trespasses so the same man that said when i want to do good evil's right there and i do things that i hate the same man who admitted to doing hateful things and sins the same man said but there's forgiveness to pardon us from all our transgressions thank god john assures the same and says confession of sins allows the faithful and just christ to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness praise god pull up isaiah 53 please isaiah 53 5 read 5 6 and 11. god looks down from heaven brother sister he looks down from heaven and all he sees is mostly iniquity he says what solution can i give for this world it's just covered in iniquity what solution can i give and he said i'm going to send my dear innocent sinless son to take all the punishment of all this iniquity all this hatred for the law of god i'm going to put all of it on him and then i'll make a substitution that all those who accept him will become righteous praise god oh my what a no wonder it's called the gospel amen no wonder it's called good news hallelujah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the times that we knew better and we still had contempt for the word of god the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes we are healed how many been healed by the stripes of christ amen oh we like sheep have gone astray we've turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all oh thank you jesus praise god all my iniquity all your iniquity was laid on jesus christ on the cross before you even knew it that's the best part before he even knew you needed it praise god it was already paid for hallelujah it makes it a free gift he doesn't have to go back to the cross again thank god he already took all that iniquity upon himself praise god that was god's answer christ on the cross was god's answer to our iniquity right our addiction to iniquity uh the depravity of our sin the depths of our our our wickedness christ is the answer praise god amen i hope the cross the old thing to us i hope it's a fresh real thing to us hallelujah the bible said he'd justify many by bearing their iniquities pull up acts 3 26. see anyone who's been delivered from an addiction which that was my first sermon i ever preached was about uh uh overcoming addictions over and over and over at the college there anyone who's ever been freed from addiction knows that it's an amazing experience it's like going from a slave to a free man it's like going from caged up to being totally free praise god that's what the bible said to the jews first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his own iniquities amen god sent christ to bless us and the blessing is the fact that we can leave our iniquities and walk in holiness glory that's why he was sent to deliver us forgive us of our iniquities and then help us to come out of our iniquities so to believe in jesus means we stop committing iniquities that's what believing in christ means we leave our iniquities behind the bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned but remember all nations the bible says are going to be guilty of living in iniquity let's look at go to revelation 14 18 acacia i just want to remind us of this i believe in praying for america as i told you i prayed for america more than i ever had before but eventually america is going to be fully given over to iniquity most of it is already revelation 14 8 let's look at these these say all nations and there fouled another angel saying babylon has fallen his fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication remember the bible said she was judged because her iniquities are remembered in heaven so through the roman catholic church through her religious uh teachings and through her daughters she spreads her fornication her idolatry her uh all of her evil works that she does she spreads it to all nations and they're all deceived oh we're religious we have churches and yet it's deception 18 3. can you pull it up honey revelation 18 3 and then revelation 18 23 revelation 18 3 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are wax rich through the abundance of her delicious delicacies now i don't have that all figured out how does the roman catholic church uh work with the economy i don't have that figured out brother branham i just heard him say this week he says it's because catholics own all the businesses now that may be true that's the best answer i could come up with but i don't have that all figured out but verse 23 18 23 this leaven goes as leaven does it spreads through the entire world and the light of the candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom christ and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee why because he christ takes her out of the world praise god christ raptures his bride right the bridegroom raptures the bride out so the voice of god is not heard anymore for thy merchants were thy great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived so i don't know if you caught that church but denominations they're sorcerers right they put a sorcery of sin on them that they to love sin like i saw my mom and dad i'll just get back back to my testimony i saw my mom and dad argue back and forth about sin and my dad would bring up things how the the church we were raised in was getting off the word now there was good people in there but they got off the word and pretty soon uh pretty soon they started letting people watch the wrong movies and by the time cam left and then they they got rid of their sunday night services and they just made fellowships where they watch football on sunday nights i mean just just licensing immorality right just trying to keep the people together and you can see how it spreads and it's it's a it's a type of witchcraft ma it's a type of somehow the evil spirits are spreading and and and putting a spell over people nigh through the witchcraft now that's something else i gotta like to study more on that by god's grace but the bible says uses sorceries evil spirits spells upon people through the churches so somehow as those ministers are preaching somehow they're laying down like a lukewarmness sorcery some type of lukewarmness and some type of sin loving message where they love to hear that message the bible says they'll have itching ears give us preachers that let us enjoy sin ah give us men of god with swords praise god amen not with the not with feathers to tickle ears that's not the kind of men we want we want men with swords amen amen to cut away this uncircumcised hearts praise god amen to cut away the worldly habits right the iniquity habits to cut those away and set us free praise god so the question comes which the confusion about iniquity is which actions lead to habitual iniquity and which actions lead to jesus officially calling somebody you are a worker of iniquity can you imagine that listen we're all we all we all have works right you all have a work you're working somewhere right some people different businesses but all of us work with works in our home and our friends in our church but jesus he gets so fed up with the lukewarm and these other ones that he says you're a worker of iniquity he assigns them a title they're so faithful to their iniquity he says that's all you work for oh my god help us to work for the kingdom of god so the question is the confusion is which actions actually lead to habitual iniquity that allows jesus to call people workers of iniquity do you know the scripture uses that 30 times 30 times it's mostly in the old testament where god calls israel workers of iniquity what they do set up idols they just brought the idols in they stopped doing the sacrifices to god oh let's let us enjoy the sacrifices of god church you get to come here and sacrifice to god to lift your voice and clap your hands and praise god and worship god let us be content with the sacrifice of god amen but the old testament those sacrifices they replaced sacrifices to god and they would worship idols so 30 times over 30 times the scripture says worker of iniquity how do you become a worker of iniquity that's what we'll get to the next few weeks lord willing well first they're led by false preachers so the preachers are first the leaders of iniquity uh go to second corinthians 11 13-14 acacia ii is 11 13-14 satan has to start somewhere and so most of the time he starts with the preachers and satan comes and he hides behind the pulpit and he looks so holy he looks so bright it looks so so pure how do you know it by their fruits you know them the fruits of the preachers lives that's why church many times i don't mind i'll bash certain doctrines preachers are preaching because i know it's not the preacher really it's satan where does satan want to get he wants to get where he can influence the people the most how does he do that through the local pastors that's why i believe that jeffersonville movement is a telling preacher pastors to sit down because pastor is the gift that affects most people if they can get that pastor to sit down play the taste what they do after they play the tapes they come up and inject their own ideas every word is thus saith the lord joseph's your pastor instead of your regular pastor now you're taking headship from someone who's not your pastor and that's the start of it remember it always starts small it always starts really simple small but then that that leaven grows and produces over years and decades it grows into something for such are false apostles deceitful workers seek workers watch people's works transforming themselves into the apostles of christ this happened all down through the church ages if you've read if you ever read the church ages lately they were saying we're apostles and and jesus said they're not they're liars they're not apostles and make no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of life church who is preaching behind the pulpits when they say it's okay for homosexuals to preach that's satan that is satan he's doing anything he can do to get behind the pulp and take control and try to influence the people but that's what they want to hear because if they didn't they'd walk out see but they love that they love the the world they love the big crowds and they love the uh the pleasures of unrighteousness so where does satan go he goes to the preachers gives them false doctrine satan transforms himself into a preacher behind the pulpit god help us they know the truth but they preach lies and they fight against the truth the scripture says they're more willing to believe lies rather than the bible truth praise god now i'm going to as this chapter goes on i might identify specific uh acts of iniquity because the bible defines them as you read the scripture the bible defines specific acts of iniquity and then in the book i say i say this you can you can choose which group to be a part of and in the book i go through different denominations and list their iniquities oh my and see so god's wisdom will help us to leave iniquity and the bible says in second timothy 2 22 that we will follow righteousness faith charity peace within that call on god out of a pure heart have you listened to some of these preachers you can hear them preach and talk and there's no purity in them there's no purity they're just reciting things you can can't you feel sometimes i'm talking about denominations you know you listen if you haven't listened to catholic priests listen to one soon you know most of them you don't hear the purity of a pure heart you hear like a political talk like brother man says you hear something else like for money right or prosperity you don't really it seems fake it doesn't even feel like is that real but church i want to have such sincerity that i can be honest before you i can be honest before god and that if there's something in our lives the holy spirit can deal with it and cut it off and get get rid of it so that we can walk before god in all pleasing manner the purity follow them that call on god out of a pure heart that really come to church and say in all purity lord i want to be closer to you not just say that but they really want to be closer to god pure that means they're going to go home tonight and do something about it amen praise god tomorrow morning they'll do something about it because it's a pure heart it's not defiled the bible says call follow them that call on god out of a pure heart praise god and so in the book now i begin with satan the father of iniquity to show where iniquity started jesus we saw he's the very epitome of godliness he is what it's his holiness right it's his faith his virtue he's the epitome of godliness but satan is the opposite the epitome of iniquity and he's leading billions into it imagine that church billions into it so here i got about uh five minutes here so let me just go through a few things about the the enemy here now this is the perfect chapter where i put serpent seed in here so i'm not gonna preach that most of ever all of us understand that uh but let's look at a few of satan's attributes here real quick now the word lucifer means lightbearer so he's one that bears light he possesses light so lucifer's name means light bear he holds the light look at that all god's angels are just reflecting his light god's light remember satan transforms himself into an angel of light but his lies enslave the souls in darkness ezekiel 29 says he began as the most bright beautiful angel he was equipped for music ministry in heaven he was the anointed cherub set by god to be covering around the throne uh michael and the other uh michael was probably the other cherub around god's throne because as moses had two cherubims there by the throne of god the bible said he was satan was perfect in every way until iniquity was found in him his heart was lifted up because of his brightness and his beauty so the whole beginning of iniquity starts where it starts in the heart of satan where does this mystery of iniquity start the very heart of the father of iniquity starts in his heart aren't you glad church you got a new heart ezekiel said you'll get a new heart new spirit and then my spirit praise god amen we need a new heart because our own heart was full of inequity but he looked at himself and said my i sure am bright i am beautiful look at this i'm really something is that how you look in the mirror in the morning that's not how i look in here but he said ma i am look how bright i am i imagine he just had a little more brightness than michael he was the perfect of all the angels the most beautiful of all the angels so his iniquity corrupted his wisdom he was very wise he was perfect in every way but his his iniquity corrupts wisdom now let's read isaiah 14 13 and 14. this reveals his wicked thoughts to exalt himself to be like god remember church i'm gonna go back to this that was the very lie of the serpent in the garden that was his lie to eve you're the absolute eve you're the absolute you can be like god you can know good and evil so see this battle about the absolute is brother brown the absolute is the message the absolute is god who's the absolute this battle is the same battle we've been fighting all along jesus christ is the absolute amount brother branham pointed us to the absolute praise god right the bible points us to the absolute bible is the absolute right but we know the absolute really is the spirit praise god and this is the word of the holy spirit on paper yes it's our absolute on paper no doubt about that but it's pointing to one person the the person who is the absolute jesus christ so isaiah 14 13 here's his wicked thoughts for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high may god grant all of us contentment you know americans want to aim high right americans want promotions americans want more more higher higher higher but we got to be very careful with those because satan's very the very thought of his iniquity was i need to go higher this position isn't good enough for me i look at i'm deserving of more i'm deserving to be like god this is the very thought of iniquity i need a place that's not mine i need a bigger i need better and his place was to be i want to be just like god the member church he said i will six times six six times in iniquity he said i will i will i will and this is completely opposite to christ who said thy will it's not the i will it's the thy will that god loves that's so that's the prayer church let's examine your prayers real for a moment if you're praying i want i want i want right let's change that to what what do you want lord what do you want give me what you want five more minutes here that's the prayer that's how the prayers have to change not what i want but what god wants because i will leads to iniquity thy will leads to godliness praise god amen jesus directly rebukes satan for regarding only his will rather than god's will in matthew 16 23 he said get thee behind me satan for thou art an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but for those that be of men satan loved the things of man satan loved the things of the world rather than the things of god and jesus rebuked him for it oh my my god help us to set our affections on things above praise god but satan loves the things of the earth i will i will i want i see more i see higher i got to go higher that's nothing wrong with desiring to do more for god i hope everybody understands that there's nothing wrong with when you see your talents increase nothing wrong with that but when it's selfish and when it's outside the will of god that's iniquity satan proves it there because his his heart was where iniquity first formed the first sin the first sin of the whole history right the first sin of all the universe was i will be like the most god i will exalt myself higher than where god has wanted me to go godliness with contentment is what church what is it godliness contentment is greek being content with where god has placed you revelation 12 shows satan's rebellion he led the first church split so how we treat one another is so important also he's given titles of a great red dragon old serpent devil satan accuser of the brethren on this text jesus said he's a liar and the father of lies he convinced a third of the angels to join his war against michael and the holy angels thank god michael's army prevailed praise god church let me say like this the truth will prevail don't get discouraged sometimes in my mind i wonder what is what's going to happen what's going to happen but church we know truth always wins amen you might have to wait a little bit longer but truth will prevail hallelujah and after losing the battle in heaven to michael the very next thing we do is seeing him deceive and beguile a virgin trying to pervert a virgin's life now church i just real quick just went through satan's characteristics these are some of his main characteristics and these same characteristics passed down to his children because we are the children of god but satan has his own children satan's children disregard god's will and they take their prideful heart now look they take a prideful heart they accuse others there's difference between just telling somebody you disagree with them and actually accusing them that's different violent look at the rights going on desiring promotion desiring worship from people and desiring positions that aren't yours praise god let's stand here musicians you can come here try to keep a little shorter so my wife can testify just a moment but i want to pray with you by god's grace i hope that's helpful church to see how satan how he let iniquity be formed in his heart he started thinking look how good i am look how bright i am look how beautiful i am look in other words like look how smart i am he started accusing others violent wanting promotion worship and position let's bow our heads for a moment let's take these next few minutes here's just a couple minutes let's examine our heart and make sure there's no pride in our heart make sure we don't want to accuse others unjustly make sure we don't want to be violent with our words desire promotions that aren't ours we don't want the praises of men or we don't want other positions that don't belong to us heavenly father lord we've preached your word lord [Music] thank you for this revelation lord god it's a great revelation and jesus said that the world can't receive this spirit of truth they don't want to but lord that's why we're here we want to and we rejoice in it dear god lord we are those that want to follow those that call upon god out of a pure heart help us to be pure lord today lord we all battle this at some time pride and accusing others and violence and promotions wanting praises of men and positions lord with our heads bowed i just pray god just purge us lord of any of these these iniquity works lord god lord go past the outer man go down to our spirit realm dear god [Music] go down into our hearts lord god [Music] we want to come to church we want to pay our tithes we want to sing and praise god we want to sing
