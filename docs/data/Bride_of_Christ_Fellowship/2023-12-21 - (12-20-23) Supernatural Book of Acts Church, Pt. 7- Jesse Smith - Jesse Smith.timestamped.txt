[0:05] preached the first part of that so I
[0:08] appreciate that reminder sister was
[0:09] really
[0:15] timely that's God that's God here see
[0:18] here staying in that word I love that
[0:20] stay in the word yeah that's awesome
[0:22] wonderful so I'd like to get back to
[0:24] that one and preach that so maybe we'll
[0:26] look at that Sunday uh Monday I put out
[0:28] the video on are there church ages you
[0:30] know
[0:30] so thinking about that this week of
[0:33] course they're T All Through the Bible
[0:35] um so that's been a good video
[0:40] there okay so I want to type this out
[0:42] here I just SE another U gift so now
[0:45] this would be the uh eighth out of nine
[0:48] gifts of the holy spirit we'll see it at
[0:50] the end of this chapter here uh the gift
[0:53] of knowledge operates through Philip's
[0:55] life and Ministry acts 8 verse1 we'll
[0:59] read that and then we'll have you see
[1:01] here actually let's just read it
[1:03] together just one verse let's begin
[1:04] there on three one two three and Saul
[1:07] was consenting unto his death and at
[1:11] that time there was a great persecution
[1:14] against the church which was at
[1:17] Jerusalem and they were all scattered
[1:19] abroad throughout the regions of Judea
[1:23] and Samaria except the apostles so we'll
[1:26] see later why the apostles had to stay
[1:28] in Jerusalem we'll see that later I
[1:29] think chapter 15 uh but may God add his
[1:32] Blessing to the read of his word may be
[1:33] seated praise
[1:47] God so I'm just going to review real
[1:49] quick by God's grace uh We've uh seen
[1:52] tongues interpretation in chapter 2
[1:53] verse 4 prophecy dreams and Visions
[1:56] mentioned in 2 17 and 18 we saw Doctrine
[1:59] and 242 we saw the miracle the lame man
[2:02] leaped and walked and had faith in his
[2:05] name so the miracle of faith and I'm
[2:07] sorry the miracle of the lame also the
[2:10] gift of faith in Acts three and acts 4
[2:14] in Acts 5 Peter has discernment of the
[2:16] LIE of ananas and saf and also in Acts
[2:19] chapter 5 the miracle or sign and wonder
[2:22] of the of the sick being healed in the
[2:24] shadow of Peter and other healing so the
[2:27] gifts of healing uh chapter 5 ver 21
[2:30] they taught in the temple again teaching
[2:33] in Acts 610 wisdom Steven's wisdom could
[2:36] not be withstood he was so wise uh he
[2:39] gave all the right words at the right
[2:40] time and then in here in chapter 8
[2:42] Philip will give the word of knowledge
[2:44] because the the unic asks uh who is this
[2:47] speaking of in other words I don't have
[2:49] understanding who is this speaking of
[2:51] and Philip preaches Christ unto him amen
[2:54] so now we're at already eight out of the
[2:56] nine gifts of the Holy Spirit uh here in
[2:58] the first eight uh chapters of the book
[3:01] of Acts praise God so uh verse one says
[3:03] Saul was consenting unto his
[3:06] death I'm not mistaken this is the first
[3:09] mention of St Paul uh in the entire
[3:12] Bible if I'm not mistaken and the word
[3:14] consenting is quite a word it means uh
[3:17] to approve together with others it means
[3:20] to agree to
[3:22] applaud so uh Saul had such an evil
[3:25] spirit on him it was like he was
[3:26] applauding the death of stepen this
[3:28] martyr and just it's amazing to think
[3:31] about how he can go from one extreme to
[3:33] the other but that's the power of the
[3:36] Gospel I love that I love that he was I
[3:39] love the change this is the change that
[3:41] Christ does and this is the proof of the
[3:44] gift of of of the Holy Ghost this is the
[3:47] proof of the book of Acts church when
[3:49] someone that hates the truth will then
[3:51] eventually love the truth praise God
[3:54] Amen someone will rejoice in Christians
[3:56] being mocked and made fun of but then
[3:58] becomes the one that is mocked and made
[4:00] fun of praise God it is proof of the
[4:03] power of the resurrected Christ amen he
[4:06] was consenting unto the their death uh
[4:09] the Bible
[4:10] says hallelujah and now I want to uh
[4:14] read this quote here because the Bible
[4:15] says uh in verse one then they were
[4:18] scattered so a persecution comes against
[4:20] the church I notice for the first few
[4:23] we'd say weeks or months or years of the
[4:25] church there's not really a persecution
[4:27] other than they were arrested twice
[4:28] remember we saw that they're arrested
[4:30] one time they're just arrested the next
[4:32] time they're beaten though beaten and
[4:35] arrested but now a great persecution
[4:38] comes and what does the persecution do
[4:41] it scatters them abroad except the
[4:44] apostles so the apostles kind of hide
[4:46] out in Jerusalem uh but all the other
[4:49] non- Apostles or many of the non-
[4:50] Apostles are scattered abroad and
[4:52] brother makes a statement in
[4:54] investments in 1963 I found this quote
[4:57] today of course I'd read it before
[5:00] he says uh sometimes he says the very
[5:03] facts of evidence that you failed he
[5:06] said uh he said how different the
[5:08] Pentecostal group is today from what it
[5:10] was in that day speaking of the day of
[5:12] Pentecost when they got the Holy Ghost
[5:14] they got rid of what they had to start
[5:17] the ministry remember earlier in chapter
[5:19] 4 uh they sold what they had in order to
[5:22] help out the Saints he says today we try
[5:26] to say we got millions he said and all
[5:29] like this here he said now that is right
[5:31] it sure is truth we call ourselves
[5:33] Pentecostal he said I said one time at
[5:35] one of the meetings I heard some of the
[5:36] preachers
[5:38] testifying he said uh I said you men I'm
[5:41] among you because I love you I think
[5:42] you've got something but I'm here to
[5:44] help you to do everything I can I hope
[5:46] you understand me tonight all you done
[5:49] was tell me about how many Cadillacs you
[5:51] got think about
[5:52] that he says and he said that man has
[5:55] got more Cadillacs than you could ever
[5:57] have tell about how to get rid of
[6:00] something they got of this worldly stuff
[6:02] and get something in their heart God's
[6:04] word to vindicate it amen he says there
[6:07] was a f little Pentecostal brother he
[6:08] may be sitting here now nothing against
[6:10] him he raised up and many of the
[6:12] businessmen sitting here knows this is
[6:14] exactly the truth he said but brother
[6:16] Bram that's where the great mistake was
[6:18] made so brother Ram says you know when
[6:20] they first got the Holy Ghost they sold
[6:22] what they had but these preachers are
[6:24] saying but now we got the Holy Ghost and
[6:26] we get more and and and one of those
[6:28] preachers was the rich preachers raises
[6:30] up and he says that was a mistake that
[6:33] they sold everything they had and
[6:35] brother said I said what mistake did God
[6:38] make amen hallelujah God doesn't make
[6:40] mistakes Hallelujah right in other words
[6:42] the early Apostles when they did this
[6:44] when they sold things to help out people
[6:47] but R says God wasn't making a mistake
[6:49] in the apostles amen amen and then the
[6:51] preacher said why those people that sold
[6:53] their goods and divided amongst the poor
[6:55] like Jesus told this rich man to do
[6:57] divided amongst the poor they made a
[6:58] mistake for as soon as a persecution
[7:00] arose they had no home to go to so that
[7:03] was the argument of the rich preachers
[7:04] see persecution came they had no homes
[7:07] to go to and brother says he said my
[7:10] brother you claim to be Pentecost and
[7:12] think that the Holy Ghost can make a
[7:14] mistake God's word ever Remains the Same
[7:17] amen amen he said well they didn't have
[7:19] any place to go so see this is just one
[7:22] perspective so the rich people look at
[7:24] this verse and say oh the the Saints got
[7:27] scattered see that was a mistake they
[7:29] had no place to go but brother Rand
[7:31] looks at it and sees persecution plays
[7:34] into the plan of God
[7:36] Amen difficult times in our lives trials
[7:39] in our life times we persecuted it's not
[7:42] a mistake of God God's using it for his
[7:45] glory hallelujah amen and brother tells
[7:48] us the purpose of
[7:50] this they said well they don't the
[7:53] apostles didn't have any place to go
[7:55] brother said that's exactly what God had
[7:58] them to do it for in other words God
[8:00] allowed persecution God will allow tests
[8:03] in our lives to get us to do something
[8:06] we wouldn't do on our own praise God
[8:10] hallelujah he said they went from place
[8:12] to place scattering the gospel they
[8:15] didn't have any place else to go see he
[8:18] said but he said but today we're so
[8:20] different amen so carinal M looks at
[8:22] this and said oh the poor Apostles they
[8:25] should have sold their their houses and
[8:27] they should have had more money and they
[8:29] wouldn't have to leave Jerusalem but
[8:31] brother R looks at it and says no this
[8:32] is God this is God scattering the word
[8:35] of God amen hallelujah look at verse two
[8:39] and devout men carried Steven to his
[8:41] burial and made great lamentation over
[8:44] him notice devout men devout men buried
[8:48] stepen what's devout mean it means uh
[8:51] reverencing God Pious
[8:55] religious so I I think we can go to that
[8:57] scripture how can two walk together
[9:00] except they be agreed when a man of God
[9:03] when a real man of God dies The Devout
[9:06] ones the religious ones the ones that
[9:08] are pure are saddened by it right
[9:11] Hallelujah so see devout people people
[9:14] that love the Lord people that have
[9:15] gifts people that believe in the Holy
[9:17] Ghost they all hang out together praise
[9:19] God right amen that's right the Bible
[9:22] said they went out from us because they
[9:24] were not of us hallelujah that's right
[9:27] so we know those of us who hang around
[9:28] here we're birds of the same feather
[9:30] Hallelujah we got eag feathers
[9:32] hallelujah amen dve feathers amen
[9:35] hallelujah amen because we stay with the
[9:38] word of God hallelujah amen nobody can
[9:40] drive us out because this is the truth
[9:42] of God's word amen amen in other words
[9:44] I'd rather stand with you than anybody
[9:46] else no matter how close to me or what
[9:48] family members might not agree with the
[9:50] word of God I'd rather stand with you
[9:51] because you stand with God HJ amen
[9:55] praise God Amen devou men hallelujah
[9:58] we're the ones that cared about
[10:00] stepen now notice Church those devout
[10:02] men would have saw they would have seen
[10:04] with their eyes saw holding the coats
[10:07] applauding yes kill him they would have
[10:09] seen that man remember they had trouble
[10:11] when he come back remember right we're
[10:13] going to get to that they had trouble
[10:15] receiving this preacher because they saw
[10:17] him stand right there again shows the
[10:19] power of the resurrected Christ
[10:22] hallelujah amen praise
[10:27] God and so notice great lamentation so
[10:30] Saints we understand this Holy Ghost
[10:32] filled people even though they know they
[10:35] they they would have heard that stepen
[10:37] saw Jesus right before he died even
[10:39] though they know he's in heaven it's
[10:41] okay for Holy Ghost filled people to
[10:43] weep and mourn over saints that they've
[10:46] lost hallelujah amen didn't Jesus weep
[10:50] at the the grave of Lazarus and how much
[10:52] Holy Ghost did Jesus have the
[10:55] fullness amen the fullness the full
[10:58] authority of the godhead bodily dwelt in
[11:00] Christ and he went for his friend so
[11:03] Church don't ever feel bad you know if
[11:05] you miss your friend ra says we we love
[11:07] God but sometimes we need god with skin
[11:09] on
[11:10] him sometimes you want to hug a brother
[11:12] or shake their hand or sister right
[11:15] sometimes you need god with skin on it
[11:17] so I just love how the Bible records
[11:20] these religious men these holy ghost
[11:21] filled men they wept over their friend
[11:24] their brother maybe their Mentor maybe
[11:27] their leader you know and some ways as a
[11:29] deacon and as a a miracle worker they
[11:32] wept over him and the Bible records it
[11:35] it's acceptable it's a Godly thing to
[11:38] weep at a man or a a sister a servant of
[11:41] God who passes away that's a good sign
[11:44] they a real Christian praise God
[11:48] Amen oh it's a beautiful story verse
[11:51] three and as for saw he made Havoc of
[11:54] the church entering into every house now
[11:57] listen this is how he would go into
[11:58] house
[11:59] mes and hailing men and women committed
[12:02] them to prison now the word Havoc means
[12:05] to dishonor to defile it means to ravage
[12:10] ravage it means to devastate or ruin so
[12:14] every house Saul would go into he would
[12:16] ruin the house I don't know if that
[12:18] means spiritually or
[12:20] naturally but this is a a man who would
[12:22] become the first church age messenger
[12:26] who was a prophet of God think about
[12:28] this my
[12:29] a man who is lifted up to the third
[12:31] heaven praise God and God said don't
[12:34] talk about it it's too holy now later
[12:36] John was allowed to talk about it
[12:38] because you can't get no higher Heavens
[12:39] than the Throne of Jesus and the church
[12:41] said amen so Jesus forbid Paul don't you
[12:44] talk about it but before that he was
[12:47] guilty of going into every house and he
[12:49] would blaspheme the name of the savior
[12:52] he would blasing them and he would Bring
[12:54] Havoc he would try to destroy their
[12:56] house anybody ever tried to destroy your
[12:59] your friendship with somebody your or
[13:01] your family
[13:02] relationships that's what Saul that was
[13:04] his full-time job I'm going to try to
[13:06] destroy this church destroy this family
[13:09] I'm going to try to bring fear upon them
[13:12] and God turns this man around hallelujah
[13:14] praise God this is the one that God
[13:16] chooses amen sometimes we you know the
[13:19] one God chooses wouldn't be our first
[13:21] choice but God has the right choice amen
[13:24] you got to trust God and remember this
[13:26] man then worked harder than all the
[13:28] other Apostles of course because his
[13:30] past would haunt him right right and
[13:33] then he would want to prove the Bible
[13:35] said uh I believe Peter said that we
[13:37] should make our calling an election sure
[13:41] he wanted everyone to know I'm a changed
[13:43] man hallelujah amen I'm not the saw I
[13:46] used to be I'm a new man Paul all old
[13:50] things have passed away all this has all
[13:52] passed away amen I used to destroy
[13:54] Christians homes but now I destroy the
[13:57] house of hell
[14:00] of Hell give to the name of
[14:03] [Applause]
[14:07] Jesus a man would tear down destroy a
[14:10] Christian family but then he would go to
[14:12] tell husbands love your wives as Christ
[14:15] love the
[14:16] church destroying the hold of Satan
[14:18] hallelujah amen this is a man of God but
[14:22] beforehand he was a a creater of Havoc
[14:26] he would destroy and devastate and ruin
[14:28] Christian homes and families it would
[14:30] seem like
[14:33] right and the Bible said he would hail
[14:35] them which means to drag now last time I
[14:38] laid hands on Malachi a couple Services
[14:40] ago he would drag them out of their
[14:42] homes to the prison drag them and the
[14:46] Bible said he did this in every house
[14:48] that he went into is that right that's
[14:50] what verse three says he would hail them
[14:53] men and women he would drag them men and
[14:56] women committed them to prison
[14:59] imagine he loved to see free people lose
[15:03] their freedom and become
[15:05] slaves imagine uh the children he'd
[15:09] probably take the adults right where
[15:10] would the children go he'd break up
[15:12] mothers and children and fathers and
[15:14] children and he would just be so happy
[15:16] afterwards he W he was against
[15:19] Christ he destroyed
[15:22] families so see how he'd be so motivated
[15:25] to never do this again he he would just
[15:28] have so much motivation I'll give
[15:30] everything I have I'll get whipped and
[15:31] look God and remember Jesus said I'm
[15:33] going to show him how much he must
[15:35] suffer for my name sake right because he
[15:38] brought suffering upon the people of God
[15:41] my goodness right and then God had him
[15:43] write the majority of the New Testament
[15:45] for us the holy words of God amen amen
[15:49] the words that we all be judged by this
[15:52] is the man Christ chose how many how
[15:54] many of you Christ chose the right
[15:56] guy let's go over to First Timothy
[15:58] chapter 1 this was in my notes there
[16:01] don't want to forget to read this I
[16:03] mentioned this over the years you know
[16:04] numerous times but I think I want to
[16:06] read it again just to encourage
[16:10] you 1 Timothy chapter
[16:15] 1 verse 11 according to the Glorious
[16:18] Gospel of the Blessed God which was
[16:21] committed to my trust so the gospel was
[16:23] committed to Paul the good news was
[16:25] committed to his trust even though he
[16:27] persecuted and jailed the people and
[16:29] applauded when stepen died about this
[16:32] gospel it was committed to his trust and
[16:36] I think Christ Jesus our lord who ha
[16:38] enabled me for Heath counted me faithful
[16:40] putting me into the ministry this man's
[16:43] faithful to
[16:45] Jesus yeah see church this is why some
[16:47] people have to have this is why Moses
[16:48] needed a burning bush experience this is
[16:51] why Paul had to meet Jesus in Arabia
[16:54] because he done so much evil Moses
[16:57] murdered a man right right I think the
[16:59] sight sound did a good job it was just
[17:01] this this weak old man and he murdered
[17:03] him like so Moses would not have felt
[17:04] good about
[17:05] it and how could he ever forgive himself
[17:08] amen sh how could he ever move past his
[17:11] failures God has a way of moving you
[17:13] past your
[17:14] failures I put that quote out today
[17:17] where uh brother said what a consolation
[17:19] to Joshua because God told Joshua as I
[17:22] was with Moses despite his failures I'll
[17:25] be with you hallelujah amen amen
[17:29] amen and that way I know even if I fail
[17:32] God won't leave me because he knows I'm
[17:34] trying
[17:36] Hallelujah and God's looking at your
[17:39] office or your position as a Christian
[17:41] that's what he's looking at but he's not
[17:43] looking at your failures cuz you confess
[17:45] them
[17:46] Hallelujah that's a Joshua commission
[17:49] and we're the Joshua church amen as God
[17:52] was with Jesus as God was with Paul as
[17:55] God was with Martin Luther John Wesley
[17:57] and we so God Is With
[18:00] Us amen God With Us the same way he is
[18:05] no different he's the same yesterday
[18:06] today
[18:08] Hallelujah that's the Joshua commission
[18:11] what a consolation
[18:13] Hallelujah Joshua could look and say
[18:16] praise God as God was with the murderer
[18:18] ter Prophet so he'll be with me praise
[18:21] God Amen God didn't leave him when he
[18:24] didn't circumcise his boys and he should
[18:26] have been killed by an Angel
[18:29] God didn't leave him
[18:31] amen church God God wants us to learn
[18:34] from our mistakes but he doesn't want us
[18:35] guilty over all of our mistakes amen he
[18:39] wants our mistakes to motivate us to
[18:41] Future
[18:43] obedience amen
[18:48] hallelujah God counted me faithful a man
[18:51] that wed havoc on the church a man that
[18:53] applauded the death of Christians that's
[18:55] who God chooses of course he repented
[18:58] verse 13 who is before a blasphemer
[19:01] again so Paul or Saul would blaspheme
[19:03] this Lord Jesus but then Jesus would
[19:05] look past it because God Jesus knew he
[19:08] had a purpose for this manen
[19:12] Hallelujah he would blashe he would call
[19:15] Jesus the devil be elab but God knew he
[19:19] did it as the Bible said in ignorance he
[19:22] was ignorant of it he just been taught
[19:25] the ways of the law the ways of the law
[19:27] he hadn't actually met him praise God oh
[19:29] Church it makes all the difference when
[19:30] you meet Jesus hallah I was raised in
[19:34] the chur I saw am for my mother but I
[19:36] hadn't met him but once I met him let me
[19:38] tell you I became a new man you became a
[19:41] new woman a new man because you met
[19:45] [Applause]
[19:47] Hallelujah just need to me US each one
[19:49] of your children all the te whoever it
[19:52] is each one just needs to meet
[19:54] Jesus it makes all the
[19:57] difference
[19:58] [Applause]
[20:00] amen he was a blasphemer no longer a
[20:03] blasphemer though who was a persecutor
[20:05] an injures and I obtained Mercy because
[20:07] I did it ignorantly in unbelief
[20:09] hallelujah thank God for Mercy amen how
[20:12] many can say tonight I obtained Mercy I

[22:32] and the grace of our Lord was exceeding
[22:34] abundant with faith and love which is in
[22:37] Christ Jesus this is a faithful saying
[22:40] and worthy of all acceptation that
[22:42] Christ Jesus came into the world what do
[22:44] you do to save Sinners of whom I am
[22:47] chief oh thank God amen hallelujah amen
[22:51] he said he's the chief of Sinners then
[22:53] he also said I'm the least of all the
[22:55] saints amen right Hallelujah
[22:58] look how he now look and think how great
[23:01] he was in the eyes of God but in his
[23:03] eyes he was the lowest of the low may
[23:05] God help us to always see ourselves as
[23:07] the lowest of the
[23:08] low if this man is a chief of Sinners
[23:12] and yet God used him in such a mighty
[23:14] way Hallelujah right that the Bible said
[23:17] he heal his prayers healed everybody on
[23:20] the island of Mita we'll get to that
[23:22] right every person that was sick the one
[23:24] with the bloody flux just the blood
[23:26] wouldn't stop flowing he lays hands on
[23:28] it and the blood dries up amen
[23:31] hallelujah yet the chief of Sinners he
[23:34] realized there's nothing good in me if
[23:36] anything is good in me it's going to be
[23:37] Christ May the Christ that's in Our
[23:39] Lives May It Flow out to others praise
[23:41] God Amen oh I love that yeah now church
[23:46] that's how we should see it Jesus Christ
[23:48] came into the world to save us
[23:50] sinners of whom we could say we are
[23:52] chief praise God verse 16 how be it for
[23:56] this cause I obtain Mercy that in me
[23:58] first now look first Jesus Christ might
[24:00] show forth all longsuffering for a
[24:02] pattern to them which should Hereafter
[24:04] believe on him to everlasting life now
[24:07] this is such a beautiful thing this is
[24:09] the I believe this is a proof text that
[24:12] Paul was the first church age messenger
[24:14] because brother Adam said Paul sets the
[24:16] pattern for all preachers to follow in
[24:19] other words every preacher is going to
[24:21] try to be like the Apostle Paul
[24:23] Hallelujah so diligent so dedicated so
[24:27] hardworking so humble amen I'm the chief
[24:30] of Sinners I'm not the greatest
[24:31] Christian of all
[24:32] time I'm the chief of all Sinners amen
[24:36] I'm the pattern the pattern of
[24:38] longsuffering God was very patient with
[24:40] me God waited a long time for me praise
[24:43] God right amen God waited 19 years until
[24:46] I finally surrendered till I laid down
[24:48] all my crowns of sports crowns or
[24:50] whatever my medals or whatever Pride I
[24:52] had 19 long years he waited but God was
[24:55] patient hallelujah amen amen God was
[24:58] patient Hallelujah Paul had to lay down
[25:00] all of his previous thinking all this he
[25:03] said oh I was a Hebrew of Hebrews I was
[25:05] the Pharisee of Pharisees I was the most
[25:07] legal of all the legalists but I was the
[25:10] pattern that God would show mercy on me
[25:12] and then God would show Mercy to all of
[25:14] us
[25:15] hallelujah amen that's the
[25:18] pattern he's the pattern if God was
[25:21] merciful with a man applauding killing
[25:24] Christians and bringing havoc and Destro
[25:27] destroy and ruining Christians homes if
[25:30] God will be merciful on that then God
[25:32] will be merciful on you and
[25:34] I that's the pattern amen God sent Jesus
[25:38] to save Sinners of whom you and I were
[25:41] pretty bad
[25:42] Sinners I guess I can't say Chief Paul
[25:44] said he's Chief and I'm not going to
[25:46] argue with the Bible but I must be like
[25:48] maybe one or two above him if he's the
[25:50] chief I'm of course I'll have no rewards
[25:52] near his because he had those three
[25:53] missionary trips and but I just want to
[25:55] be there praise God I just want the Holy
[25:57] Ghost I just want to be in the
[25:58] Millennium praise God I just want to be
[26:00] with Jesus am I'm the lowest of the low
[26:02] you know I just want to be with Jesus
[26:05] amen that's what I live for amen amen
[26:07] that's why we preach the gospel so he's
[26:09] the pattern notice a
[26:11] blasphemer but he did it ignorantly I
[26:14] told you this before I used to make fun
[26:15] of people that spoke in tongues when I
[26:17] was a teenager my brothers and I would
[26:18] Snicker and laugh we'd be like this I'd
[26:20] be going like this to cam and Sam like
[26:22] hear them right in the middle of it all
[26:25] and how many times did I blasting the
[26:26] Holy Ghost but God was merciful to me
[26:29] amen now I pray for God to speak in
[26:31] tongues now I pray God send us the
[26:34] tongue send us the interpretation give
[26:35] us America I want more of God I love you
[26:38] God I did it ignorantly I never would
[26:40] have done it had I met you before
[26:43] hallelujah amen
[26:45] amen that's the
[26:48] pattern pattern is unworthy unworthy
[26:50] dirty filthy Destroyer Destroyer but
[26:53] I'll make you a son and daughter amen
[26:56] that's the batter amen I'll forgive all
[26:59] your unbelief all your ignorance I'll
[27:01] forgive all that and I'll make you a
[27:03] real child of God hallelujah Hall
[27:07] he Lydia's got a lyia gave me a good
[27:10] thought this week I didn't get to it but
[27:11] after David brought the ark up the first
[27:14] time good good observation Lydia
[27:17] remember us touched it I just read it
[27:19] this week he died David's like how do I
[27:21] bring up the ark God's like go read the

[27:26] read the Bible sometimes
[27:28] I'm not put David down he's way more man
[27:29] a man of God than I ever will
[27:31] be but then the Bible said Lydia pointed
[27:33] out the ark went to a Philistines house
[27:37] and God blessed the
[27:40] Philistine I said a
[27:43] Philistine you know that's like uh
[27:45] Goliath people Goliath people right so
[27:49] this Philistine either he was a proelite
[27:51] to Judaism like maybe Uriah the hittite
[27:54] notice he's a prite but they still call
[27:56] him the hittite
[27:58] Hallelujah he ignorantly was a hittite
[28:01] but then he became a real believer
[28:02] praise God and he became a mighty man of
[28:05] God Amen I like this once the word of
[28:08] God once the ark once he had experience
[28:10] amen once OED Edom had experience and he
[28:13] was no longer this Philistine worshiping
[28:15] the Philistine Gods God blessed his
[28:17] house because the ark came in the house
[28:20] amen God had mercy God was showing a
[28:22] pattern of Mercy I don't care if you're
[28:24] Goliath's family I don't care if your
[28:26] Goliath's people if you love me I'll
[28:28] have mercy on you I'll bless your home
[28:31] amen CU that's the pattern amen we're
[28:34] all Sinners we all fall short we all

[30:34] us we we can't be discouraged you know
[30:36] about the gifts of the holy spirit
[30:37] that's kind of my purpose behind this
[30:39] because we are a continuation of the
[30:40] book of Acts right as long as we're
[30:42] trying in our best if we're doing our
[30:45] best to be like the book of Acts then
[30:46] God is pleased with us
[30:49] hallelujah right the the book of Acts
[30:51] covers 32 years according to uh
[30:54] Scofield so we don't know all that God
[30:57] did did but God did things over the
[30:59] course of our lives that were so
[31:00] wonderful right Hallelujah over the
[31:02] course of their lives so many wonderful
[31:04] things and how many of those one time I
[31:06] have to do this one of these servants

[31:08] them our our testimonies how it's just
[31:10] like the book of Acts hallelujah amen
[31:14] glory I look forward to that by God's
[31:16] grace but it's it's that simple that we
[31:19] are continuation who else is baptized in
[31:22] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[31:24] who else is fasting and praying and
[31:25] giving to the poor you know who else is
[31:27] doing that who else has the doctrine of
[31:29] the Apostles right amen hallelujah amen
[31:33] like I went last time I went through
[31:34] those 14 doctr that's just 14 there's
[31:37] way there's way more who else is keeping

[31:43] because of God's
[31:44] mercy hallelujah it's got to be us
[31:47] because we're the ones keeping the
[31:49] pattern all right amen hallelujah like
[31:53] brother I just heard brother say he said
[31:56] to if I ever saw a church uh that was
[32:00] more uh with the word he said I'd shut
[32:02] these doors down and we go support that
[32:04] church but he hadn't seen it if we'd
[32:07] find anything better we' go support it
[32:09] praise Goden and so we haven't seen
[32:12] anything better yet so we stay right
[32:14] here we we know it's going to be better
[32:16] it's going to be rapturing Faith that's
[32:17] going to be better God amen amen and
[32:20] also we must look for revivals in our
[32:21] church we must pray for revivals in our
[32:24] lives amen amen amen hallelujah amen you
[32:27] must look for those
[32:29] things and if there would ever be
[32:31] anything better we would just run and
[32:33] back it up immediately praise God amen
[32:35] amen verse
[32:38] four now that's look at the Havoc that
[32:40] Saul caused
[32:42] Havoc verse four therefore they that
[32:44] were scattered abroad went everywhere
[32:47] preaching the word of God scattering so
[32:50] when people get scattered they spread
[32:52] the
[32:53] message now I'm going to drop this
[32:55] thought on you I don't know if you ever
[32:56] thought about this
[32:57] when I first started preaching I was one
[33:00] of about six preachers in our church at
[33:04] Lima brother Brooks brother Craig
[33:08] brother cam brother Tim
[33:11] Myers brother Randy verton brother Simon
[33:15] did I say Simon again and
[33:20] myself talk about a church if we' have
[33:22] stayed together brother
[33:23] malol that been a real church or
[33:25] preachers
[33:27] is that right I think look at the gifts
[33:29] of God in that church right there and we
[33:31] were just you know all young in the
[33:32] faith we didn't know who's going to
[33:33] preach or not I I didn't know for sure
[33:36] you know right at the
[33:38] beginning but sometimes you know brother
[33:40] BRS and I have talked to they we talk
[33:42] wow I wish we really would have enjoyed
[33:43] that because I didn't know you know God
[33:44] was going to spread Us wish we really
[33:46] would have enjoy what we had there and
[33:49] then we we talked about it what if we
[33:51] all would have stayed together right
[33:53] what would that look
[33:55] like brother Brooks preach every Sunday
[33:57] morning you know then we rotate you know
[34:00] right but look at all the preachers
[34:01] there and that's just like the the book
[34:03] of Acts
[34:05] here God had to scatter them because
[34:08] they got 3,000 baptized on the first
[34:10] day I don't want 3,000 just at one
[34:13] church right amen
[34:16] hallelujah God wants to scatter the
[34:19] message praise God amen amen hallelujah
[34:23] but look what we got now because God has
[34:25] scattered the message
[34:28] say we got a lighthouse lighthouse we
[34:31] got a lighthouse in this dark
[34:33] leoan Wicked age we got a lighthouse in
[34:36] Napoleon amen a lighthouse in a amen a
[34:40] lighthouse in Massachusetts with brother
[34:42] Craig amen hallelujah got a lighthouse
[34:45] out in Iowa there was no Pastor out
[34:47] there they were streaming Jeff Jenkins
[34:49] church for years just streaming wish we
[34:51] had a pastor wish we had a pastor they
[34:53] kept praying for a pastor and brother
[34:55] Brooks came in there some I forget the
[34:56] super natural whether it was a dream or
[34:58] a prophecy and he said the Lord has told
[35:00] me to come here and it was Vindicated I
[35:02] forget all these different details but
[35:04] now there's a Ministry out there and now
[35:06] second church is kind of sprung out of
[35:08] there but now maybe they're coming
[35:09] together but God wants to spread this
[35:11] word
[35:12] amen thank God God didn't keep us all Li
[35:15] cuz now amen gets to hear the word of
[35:19] God do you too he one of
[35:23] us God has to scatter sometimes how do I
[35:27] leave my precious place but you must
[35:29] leave whoever God's called you to leave
[35:31] in order to serve God's purpose amen
[35:34] amen right amen
[35:36] hallelujah the very thing that might be
[35:39] dear to you like Isaac and Abraham the
[35:42] very dearest thing to Abraham was Isaac
[35:44] and God asked you to sacrifice that for
[35:47] me the very dearest thing to your life
[35:49] think about what's the most dearest
[35:51] thing you would say God please don't
[35:52] take that if you took that I'd really be
[35:55] hurting now for most of us supposed to
[35:57] be our family right our
[35:58] family but God said that's the thing I
[36:00] need to test you do you love me more
[36:02] than this right you love me more than
[36:05] that as much as I love my fellowship
[36:07] with brother Brooks he's a real man of
[36:09] God a real Pastor a real friend I he
[36:11] calls it the Buddy days I miss those
[36:13] buddy
[36:14] days right brother Craig just sitting
[36:16] and listening and teaching in Bible I
[36:18] take all these notes I love those days
[36:21] oh those are the Golden Days brother
[36:22] Bram says those Golden Days oh my
[36:28] but God had to do something else praise
[36:30] God God had to spread the word of God
[36:33] Amen and so see church we can't be
[36:35] discouraged no matter how small we are
[36:37] right because God set each one of us
[36:39] here amen I didn't ask to come here amen
[36:43] you didn't ask to come here God called
[36:46] you am God determined the bounds of your
[36:49] habitation God scattered you from
[36:51] wherever you started cuz God wanted you
[36:53] right here
[36:55] hallelujah so we must stay encouraged we
[36:58] must keep the fire burning amen we must
[37:00] keep looking uh at the book of Acts and
[37:02] said I'm trying to be like that with all
[37:04] my heart I want to be like that hallah I
[37:07] want the power of the Resurrection I
[37:08] want the doctr of the Apostles I want
[37:11] the faith the original faith that was
[37:13] given to the fathers hallelujah amen yes
[37:17] amen amen you had to scatter
[37:20] them Allelujah so see more scattering is
[37:23] more testimonies more ministry right
[37:27] brother say I preach maybe once a month
[37:29] or twice once every two months and here
[37:32] I preach as much as I
[37:33] want sometimes too much
[37:36] no I appreciate that brother he said no
[37:39] no thank you brother I appreciate it
[37:40] love
[37:42] you no you you are very loving people I
[37:44] I would have it no other way I need at
[37:46] least one break a month and I feel
[37:47] pretty good if I can get one break a
[37:48] month I feel good enough because the
[37:51] because the atmosphere is what refreshes
[37:53] me yes it's the atmosphere usually your
[37:56] songs buddy and then all the testimonies
[37:59] of people and the prayers afterwards it
[38:01] just brings the when the presence of God
[38:02] comes in and I start weeping and
[38:04] praising God or dancing like M like
[38:06] Sunday I'm dancing up here with a great
[38:08] testimony that brings refreshment praise
[38:10] God Amen it's the joy in the house of

[38:26] of the Lord is here I can feel in the
[38:31] atmosphere the victory of the Lord is
[38:34] here s that afterwards Hallelujah so
[38:38] more scattering means smaller groups but
[38:41] more Ministry more lives can be impacted
[38:44] amen the Bible said they preach
[38:47] everywhere this is what Jesus said he
[38:49] said go you into all the world and
[38:51] notice they wouldn't go on their own
[38:53] right God had to drive them yeah
[38:56] sometimes church we won't go talk to
[38:57] that person unless God drives us to talk
[38:59] to that
[39:00] person
[39:02] Hallelujah but see God's in it God's in
[39:04] everything amen God's in persecution
[39:07] God's in difficult times God's in
[39:09] scattering you to places I I didn't want
[39:11] to really go here didn't really know
[39:13] what I I didn't know what i' find
[39:15] Abraham when I went out Hallelujah but
[39:17] as I know is that he sent me praise God
[39:20] all I knows that he told me to go so I'm
[39:22] just obeying my heavenly father I'm a
[39:24] child of Faith just like Father Abraham
[39:26] praise God Amen I'm going out I don't
[39:28] know where I'm going I'm just going
[39:30] because he told me to go praise God Amen
[39:33] and I'll find out when I get there his
[39:34] purpose for
[39:35] me
[39:39] amen remember the Bible said you have no
[39:41] Greater Joy than to see your children
[39:43] walk in the truth now that applies
[39:45] naturally but Also spiritually because
[39:47] Paul had no children but he said all you
[39:49] Thessalonians he said you're my joy and
[39:52] my
[39:53] crown amen amen he said I he said I
[39:57] cherish you as a nurse cherishes her
[40:00] sick amen or a nurse cherishes her
[40:04] children so see the people Paul Had No
[40:06] Greater Joy than to preach the people
[40:09] and see them believe what he preached
[40:12] amen hallelujah church we get No Greater
[40:15] Joy than to see the word of God being
[40:18] received am the word of God being eaten
[40:21] the word of God as your daily bread
[40:23] hallelujah amen that's why I really
[40:25] encourage you she sent me these texts
[40:27] and I love those texts because she's in
[40:29] the word of God she sends me a quach
[40:32] from brother Brandon I like that sister
[40:34] not everybody has to do that but I like
[40:37] that she feels led to do that praise God
[40:39] I like that Cas is finished in that
[40:41] church age are you almost done with that
[40:42] church age book I'm very close very
[40:43] close oh you can taste it the victory of
[40:46] finishing the church age book that's the
[40:49] first book I read after the Bible amen
[40:51] that's been the foundation of my
[40:52] Ministry is that church age book just
[40:54] like Tim fruit Tim br after brother died
[40:57] they just sat in their house and read
[40:59] the church age book until God raised
[41:00] that church up now I don't know what
[41:02] God's going to do with me but what I'm
[41:03] saying is that I'm standing on the Bible
[41:05] revelations God gave to his Prophet
[41:07] because God will do nothing amen God
[41:10] surely will do nothing except he Reveals
[41:12] His secrets to his service the prophets
[41:15] hallelujah hallelujah I love that
[41:19] amen well we don't need a prophet we
[41:21] don't need a prophet nonsense God won't
[41:22] even do nothing except he shows it to a
[41:24] prophet first amen it's exactly
[41:28] right he scattered
[41:30] them brother ra said he scattered them
[41:33] and I'm coming down to close here let's
[41:37] see go to Matthew 13:47
[41:41] 1347 it's interesting I mentioned this
[41:43] uh scripture on Sunday I didn't even
[41:45] mean to
[41:47] but I you like that's why I inspired as
[41:50] I was studying
[41:51] today this quote came up from Brother
[41:54] brand about God scattering the the
[41:57] church I tell you church sometimes it's
[41:59] hard I don't get to see my mom on
[42:01] Christmas I don't going to see my dad on
[42:02] Christmas I miss my dad I cry about my
[42:04] dad I miss cam and Simon I now I get to
[42:07] see them more than anybody but I like
[42:09] that I kind of have control over that I
[42:11] can see them kind of if I just invite
[42:12] them anytime I want you know I I miss
[42:15] him but you know God scatters us for a
[42:17] purpose in that though we find God's
[42:20] purpose amen and God separating us from
[42:23] family separating us from friends God
[42:24] sending us here there God got we find
[42:27] God's will for our lives amen
[42:32] amen so acts uh Sor Matthew 13:47 sorry
[42:36] Matthew 1347 and again the Kingdom of
[42:38] Heaven is like into a net that was cast
[42:39] into the sea and gathered of every kind
[42:41] which when it was full they drew to
[42:43] Shore and sat down and gathered the good
[42:45] into vessels but cast the bad away so
[42:48] shall be at the end of the world this is
[42:49] the end of the world Parable the gospel
[42:51] will bring in all kinds of people like I
[42:53] said we've seen it now we don't know the
[42:55] end of some of the people that have left
[42:57] us but we know the current fruits
[42:59] they're
[43:00] manifesting
[43:02] right the angels are come forth and
[43:04] sever the wicked from among the just and
[43:06] shall cast them in the furnace of fire
[43:08] there shall be wailing and nashing of
[43:10] teeth here's what brother says brother
[43:13] said see that's the way it always goes
[43:15] the first few years of the the
[43:17] Pentecostal Church ausa Street it was
[43:21] wonderful right right away there was a
[43:24] persecution come in the second year and
[43:25] Scattered the everywhere third and
[43:27] fourth years they began to find the
[43:29] church just a little bitty groups there
[43:32] was like five men besides four or five
[43:34] women that was a
[43:36] church amen I'll read it again brother
[43:40] said it always goes that way and the
[43:42] church said am day of Pentecost 3,000
[43:46] adding adding adding all of a sudden
[43:47] persecution God scatters them everywhere
[43:50] they go from a big mega church right
[43:53] down to small little bitty groups that's
[43:55] how God always does does
[43:56] it amen hallelujah right God doesn't
[44:01] want you to trust in the numbers God
[44:03] wants you to trust in
[44:05] him God wants me to trust in him not in
[44:09] any other source God wants me to look to
[44:11] him God wants me to trust in him God
[44:14] wants me to know that he scattered me
[44:16] for a purpose amen amen just like the
[44:19] pattern of St
[44:21] Paul Paul cannot just stay in one place
[44:23] well let's just grow our ministry let's
[44:25] how great and see how great we can
[44:27] become no God had to send them out on
[44:29] three missionary Journeys as they went
[44:31] through and then he spent the last 10
[44:34] years of his life from prison to prison
[44:37] right from from uh house arrest to house
[44:39] arrest to prison and finally to prison
[44:42] in Rome that's how God orchestrated his
[44:45] life and he said I'm a pattern for all
[44:48] believers after me to show the long
[44:49] suffering of God how many thankful for
[44:52] God's mercy
[44:54] am man said see how it is this is
[44:57] testimony 1953 it's always that
[45:00] way God just sends out a great gospel
[45:03] net the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man
[45:06] he went to the Sea and threw in a net
[45:07] and when he drew the net in he had
[45:08] everything that wed up in the sea he had
[45:10] it in the net he had fish Turtles water
[45:13] spiders serpents he had everything now
[45:16] it's not our business as preachers to
[45:20] say this is fish and this is
[45:23] that right so it's not our business to
[45:26] say that so I got to be careful what I
[45:28] say right we just pull the gospel net
[45:32] and then it isn't long when you see a
[45:35] Revival go on many people get saved and
[45:37] praise the Lord but see some of the some
[45:38] of those are fish and some of them are
[45:40] we'd say
[45:42] turtles Right it isn't very long to you
[45:45] say well I didn't believe there was
[45:46] anything to it after all and here he
[45:48] goes running right on back into the
[45:50] puddle again now church we I'll just use
[45:52] this as example from this year this year
[45:53] we've had young men and young men
[45:56] dancing in the spirit with us and within
[45:57] a few months they're out in the world
[46:00] right aren't you glad you're still
[46:04] here it proves you are a rainbow
[46:07] trout Hallelujah whatever to call
[46:10] yourself it proves you're the right kind
[46:13] of catch for the gospel net praise God
[46:16] Amen never wered away I don't know he's
[46:19] a fanatic such fanaticism you know like
[46:22] a spider Car Land I didn't never like
[46:24] that to begin with
[46:27] you're not that kind you just Slither
[46:28] away like a serpent like some of these
[46:30] women do today right they walk like
[46:32] serpents or I guess they walk like pigs
[46:34] cuz they got the high heels you they
[46:35] walk like pigs walk and they walk away
[46:37] and say I didn't believe that in the
[46:39] first place he's a Holy Roller anyway
[46:41] you didn't do that because you're the
[46:43] right kind of specimen amen you're just
[46:46] what God wanted God made that net so it
[46:49] would catch you and God made that net so
[46:51] he would keep you in his
[46:54] arms amen I'm not walking away this is
[46:57] what I was born for praise God right I
[46:59] finally feel like I'm at home amen
[47:03] hallelujah I wonder ay into that Wonder
[47:05] into that there's got to be more there's
[47:07] got to be more I found more
[47:11] hallelujah amen I found what I was
[47:14] looking for praise God I found my
[47:16] heart's desire I'm SE I'm seated at the
[47:19] master's table praise God amen amen
[47:24] that's what that's what fishermen do
[47:26] they bring in the catch so it can go to
[47:28] the master's
[47:29] table and here we are sitting at the
[47:32] master's table feasting on the body word
[47:35] of the son of
[47:36] man oh
[47:39] Hallelujah that's how it always is that
[47:41] way
[47:42] Malachi Victoria that's how it always is
[47:46] God scatters the church right he sends
[47:49] out the net pulls it in and whatever is
[47:51] of god stays with
[47:53] God stays with the message message of
[47:56] the
[47:57] hour glory amen the preacher don't have
[48:00] the right to say this is fish this isn't
[48:02] fish he said it isn't very long to you
[48:05] say well I believe there's nothing to
[48:07] that anyway that old water spider you
[48:09] know plop plop plop told you that wasn't
[48:12] right after all well he goes back to the
[48:14] water PL PL see I knew brother Jesse
[48:17] wasn't right there I knew brother Aman
[48:18] wasn't right there I knew that sister
[48:20] was off the
[48:21] word that old serpent will start hissing
[48:24] and said I don't like the way they do do
[48:28] things I don't like how they run that
[48:30] church I don't like how they they preach
[48:31] I don't like how they pray I don't like
[48:33] how they sing or
[48:35] dance right on back to the water it goes
[48:38] let it go let it go now do we give
[48:40] warnings before they go sure do we try
[48:42] to text them and call them tell them
[48:44] come back sure we try but a snake's
[48:46] going to go back where it came from the
[48:48] snake ain't going to the master's
[48:49] table Master don't want snakes at the
[48:53] table but there's some fish in in there
[48:55] too God knows let me say like this few
[48:58] there be that find the master's table so
[49:01] most of the catch is the wrong kind of
[49:04] creature right but a few of them will be
[49:07] kept for the Master's care hallelujah
[49:10] amen the Master's desire God knows

[49:19] Nature amen hallelujah and God is the
[49:23] one who does the election and the
[49:24] calling and it's just our business to
[49:27] preach the gospel is that right God does
[49:30] the calling one plants another Waters
[49:34] and God takes the increase amen right
[49:38] let's read that as we get ready to close
[49:40] here they went everywhere preaching the
[49:42] word of
[49:43] God that's 1 Corinthians uh chapter
[49:47] three if I'm not mistaken I didn't have
[49:49] time I just thought about looking that
[49:50] one up here I guess I thought about it
[49:52] but I didn't have time to get to 1
[49:53] Corinthians chapter 3
[50:00] yep uh
[50:01] 35 so in verse yeah in verse three
[50:04] though Paul says they're carnal because
[50:06] there's strife and divisions and one
[50:08] saying well I'm of this preacher I'm of
[50:10] that preacher they were too much looking
[50:11] at preachers don't don't get me wrong
[50:13] the Bible said give double honor to
[50:15] preachers but these guys were arguing
[50:18] too much about
[50:19] preachers right right we just we give
[50:21] honor to like like I said you know I
[50:23] made a video about uh brother random uh
[50:26] give honor to him honors do there's a
[50:27] poem that a sister wrote in 1962 it's a
[50:29] beautiful poem there's nobody like our
[50:31] brother Bill I've made that YouTube
[50:32] video last week it's a it's a beautiful
[50:34] poem we thank God for our brother Bill
[50:36] brother Bill Billy Bram Hallelujah but
[50:40] that you just give honor you don't give
[50:41] worship right but you can give honor
[50:44] give double
[50:45] honor Hallelujah but see they arguing
[50:48] verse four for one while one sayith I'm
[50:51] of AP another I'm of Apollos are you not
[50:54] carnal m now it's not a sin to say I go
[50:56] to akan or I go to Sheffield or I go to
[50:59] De Mo Iowa that's not the sin that's not
[51:02] the way they were saying it they were
[51:03] saying it by Strife other words they
[51:06] were saying I'm a little more spiritual
[51:07] than you because I go here they're
[51:10] arguing about
[51:12] it brother said God does the calling
[51:16] amen one plants one Waters but it's God
[51:20] who gives the
[51:22] increase Hallelujah in other words you
[51:24] and I can't really save any Soul it's
[51:28] God giv the increase of the
[51:30] Soul all we can do plant water or the
[51:33] other illustration all we can do Saints
[51:36] is cast out the gospel net right let it
[51:39] sink in there when it looks like it's
[51:40] got some trying to pull it in but it's
[51:43] God who allowed those fish to come
[51:44] around and get caught in the net right
[51:47] it's God's net hallelujah amen amen God
[51:50] does the calling God does the
[51:54] increase Hallelujah
[51:55] verse five who that is Paul and who is
[51:58] Apostles but ministers by whom you
[52:00] believe now remember what's a minister a
[52:02] servant preachers have to be servants
[52:05] right I like when uh sister B just I'll
[52:08] say sister can I take out the trash or I
[52:10] already got the trash she'll say I say
[52:12] no no can I take out the trash please
[52:15] she'll be like okay something like that
[52:18] you know I just like that please let me
[52:20] be a minister praise God let me be a
[52:22] servant let me not become so prideful
[52:25] let let me just see if I can humble
[52:26] myself more praise God amen
[52:29] amen because this is the kind of
[52:31] preachers in the Bible they're the
[52:33] ministers who are we're just
[52:36] servants yes we should have faith like
[52:38] Stephen now Steph was a preacher we
[52:40] should have faith like Paul we should
[52:41] have faith like wonderful Faith but at
[52:44] the core we should be servants to the
[52:46] body of Christ
[52:49] amen who are they who's Paul and Apollos
[52:52] we're just ministered but yeah my
[52:54] brother Apollo said he knew the
[52:55] scriptures he was might in the
[52:56] scriptures that's true but that's just
[52:58] his ministry that he's just a
[53:00] servant in other words the way he serves
[53:02] God Is by memorizing the scriptures
[53:04] preaching the scriptures knowing all the
[53:05] script that's how he serves
[53:07] God he was born to memorize the
[53:10] scripture he was good at memorizing the
[53:12] scripture some of us aren't so good at
[53:13] memorizing the
[53:15] scripture that's right but that's okay
[53:17] that you weren't called to that you were
[53:19] called to minister in another way praise
[53:21] God Amen and God will be pleased God
[53:23] will accept you praise God as long as
[53:25] you been the pattern of God's
[53:27] longsuffering amen amen as long as you
[53:30] keep the pattern of God's word I'm
[53:33] serving God out of gratitude because I
[53:36] was a sinner but Jesus came to save
[53:38] Sinners Hallelujah of whom I was awful I
[53:41] wasn't the chief but I was awful and but
[53:44] because of that God had mercy on me and
[53:46] now I can live a new life in Christ
[53:48] Jesus hallelujah amen I'm here to be a
[53:54] servant I have planted Apollo water so
[53:58] Paul put the seeds of the original word
[54:00] is that beautiful the spoken words
[54:01] Original Seed he put the Original Seed
[54:03] he spoke the word of God wrote the
[54:04] written word in the Bible he planted and
[54:07] then Apollo come around and water that
[54:09] I'll just water
[54:10] that see church I can't do it all right
[54:14] brother Diggs can't do it all brother
[54:16] samel brownie can't do it all but we all
[54:19] play our special part amen Amen brother
[54:22] Samuel might have planted a seed here
[54:24] now I got to come watering praise
[54:26] God Living In God's Presence amen
[54:28] hallelujah Authority in the presence of
[54:31] God hallelujah amen and same thing I I
[54:33] planted some seeds out in Iowa about
[54:35] dancing now they got to water it right
[54:38] God come around and watered our dancing
[54:40] with brother Jim shoe he watered it I
[54:43] planted it he watered it but it's God
[54:45] that gives the incourage it's God that
[54:48] makes that word live
[54:51] Hallelujah that's
[54:54] right
[54:55] see we all see God is the one who gives
[54:57] the increase amen so we don't go pat on
[55:00] the back oh you're a good planter you're
[55:02] a good water you're the one that gave an
[55:04] increase no no it's actually God that
[55:05] gave the increase amen look at verse
[55:08] seven see I'm not done so that neither
[55:10] is he that planteth anything so see
[55:11] really we're all
[55:13] nothing right right because you can
[55:15] plant seeds all day but if they don't
[55:17] get the right conditions they'll never
[55:19] have an
[55:20] increase you can water your garden all
[55:23] day but if it don't get warm you ain't
[55:25] getting any
[55:26] increase Hallelujah so let's remember we
[55:30] have to work we have to do something for
[55:32] God we have to do our ministry but that
[55:34] doesn't make us anything other than just
[55:35] saved and grateful for the word of God
[55:38] right just make Us Faithful Servants
[55:40] just makes us
[55:41] ministers neither he that WTH but God
[55:44] that giveth the increase now he that
[55:46] planteth and he that WTH are one and
[55:48] every man shall receive his own reward
[55:51] according to his labor for we are labor
[55:54] together with God ye are God's husbandry
[55:56] ye are God's Building according to the
[55:59] grace of God which is given unto me as a
[56:00] wise master builder I have laid the
[56:03] foundation see plant the seed and
[56:05] another builth thereon but let every man
[56:07] take heed upon how he builth
[56:11] thereon now church I believe this fits
[56:14] also uh for a local
[56:17] ministry
[56:19] right so some of you you know some of
[56:21] you I I might be the first message
[56:23] preacher you ever heard right but
[56:26] so see I planted the water I'm sorry I
[56:28] planted the seed we got to have guest
[56:30] preachers come around and water that
[56:32] seed right first first preach I heard

[56:45] Craig to water I need brother Brooks to
[56:47] water I all and then and then in God's
[56:50] time it brings forth the increase and
[56:53] then Simon is one with brother
[56:55] Brooks I'm one with brother Craig we're
[56:58] all one with each other we're all one
[57:00] the Bible said we're all nothing but
[57:02] it's God who gave you the new life it's
[57:05] God who brought you to life amen amen
[57:08] amen amen it was Jesus who brought Paul
[57:11] to life amen amen it was Jesus said sa
[57:15] sa why do you persecute me praise God
[57:19] Amen God brought the God brought him to
[57:22] life hallelujah amen and want to close

[57:42] time remember even seven months into the
[57:46] Revival Charles parum came and Charles
[57:49] said oh uh he said there's there's not
[57:51] enough segregation here
[57:53] right he was a real he must have been a
[57:55] real
[57:57] Rascal and they kicked him out but it
[57:59] caused some people to get upset and
[58:01] leave the movement that was just seven
[58:03] months into
[58:05] it and then in in 2008 remember some of
[58:08] the women they they took they went to uh
[58:11] the man's office Seymour they stole all
[58:13] his addresses of his uh newsletter that
[58:16] he sent out and took them I think they
[58:18] went out uh I I think they went North to
[58:21] Washington they stole all his source of
[58:23] income because he was sending out he was
[58:25] he just needed help he couldn't afford
[58:27] that he didn't have a job he was a
[58:28] blinded a oneeyed blinded preacher he
[58:31] only had one eye he wasn't working he
[58:33] was just praying and preaching all the
[58:35] time so look at that two years in the
[58:38] Revival these great things happen what
[58:40] was God doing brother said God was
[58:41] scattering those preachers right don't
[58:45] keep it all here and say well we got it
[58:46] here we're never going to lose it well
[58:49] one thing for sure if you got the Holy
[58:50] Ghost you're never going to lose it amen
[58:52] in other words don't be like you got to
[58:53] stay in one spot follow the leadership
[58:56] of God hallelujah amen God had to
[58:59] scatter them out and he allowed trials
[59:01] to come in remember why those women left
[59:03] they they left because the preacher got
[59:05] married they said the Rapture is too
[59:07] soon we shouldn't get married and they
[59:09] called a false Doctrine ain't that
[59:12] something but see God allowed it to
[59:14] allow the message to be
[59:16] spread hallelujah amen they they hit a
[59:19] second surge they had a second
[59:22] Revival or was it it was a 1911 they had
[59:25] a second Surge and then lo and behold
[59:29] World War I started in 1914 and that
[59:32] caused many of the brothers to have to
[59:34] leave so really this this revival lasted
[59:37] seven years but there was three years in
[59:40] the middle from 1908 to 1911 where it
[59:43] died down so what can we learn here
[59:46] church we we're going to be on fire at
[59:49] times and other times we just have to
[59:51] get through some difficult Seasons right
[59:53] but I'll say like this Our God can
[59:56] restore amen hallelujah amen two
[1:00:00] wonderful years of Supernatural and then
[1:00:02] a decline for three years but then it
[1:00:04] raised back up for three more years
[1:00:06] praise God Amen all things are possible
[1:00:10] with God God had to spread them out they
[1:00:12] couldn't all just be at brother
[1:00:14] Seymour's church God wanted them to go
[1:00:16] to China right God wanted them to go
[1:00:18] across the sea to Germany Russia God had
[1:00:21] to send them out there God didn't want
[1:00:22] them all in one place God wanted others
[1:00:25] to hear the message that's our feet
[1:00:27] praise
[1:00:31] God
[1:00:34] hallelujah bless
[1:00:36] you how many enjoy the word of God
[1:00:38] tonight amen this is the book of Acts
[1:00:41] church and I'm thankful to be a part of
[1:00:43] it
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:45] hallelujah God had to scatter me out now
[1:00:48] church I never want to put I never I
[1:00:50] never want to put a period after what
[1:00:51] God is doing in my life until I cross
[1:00:53] the over side the other
[1:00:55] then I know he's done with me but said
[1:00:57] God won't let Satan take you or death
[1:01:00] even take you until he's fully done with
[1:01:02] you so while you're here you still got
[1:01:04] something to do amen so I never even
[1:01:07] even in myself I never want to put a
[1:01:08] peer and say well I'll always be an AC I
[1:01:10] hope I'm Bo here because I love all of
[1:01:12] you so much I know you love me and my
[1:01:14] family but I never want to put that
[1:01:17] there in case God is going to spread us
[1:01:18] out God's going to scatter us so we can
[1:01:21] go do some other work for the glory of
[1:01:24] God
[1:01:26] Hallelujah you never know remember
[1:01:28] brother uh Nathaniel SC told us it was
[1:01:30] last year at this time remember he said
[1:01:33] God put on my dad's heart to resign his
[1:01:35] Pastor after 40 Years of pastoring I'm
[1:01:40] at 17 and a half I'm not even halfway
[1:01:42] there and all of a all of a sudden he
[1:01:45] said you know brother brother Randy told
[1:01:47] told the testimony at cam church he
[1:01:49] asked God for different signs God gave
[1:01:50] him every sign and when he resigned
[1:01:52] Nathaniel it was on his heart to be
[1:01:54] become the pastor and now brother
[1:01:56] Randy's traveled over to Europe and he
[1:01:58] has all these testimonies of people
[1:01:59] being encouraged helping the ministers
[1:02:01] in other words God has a time and season
[1:02:04] for everything yes amen and church we
[1:02:07] are to be servants we're to be ministers
[1:02:11] amen and we're to work together as one
[1:02:13] to spread the
[1:02:15] gospel Hallelujah that people might look
[1:02:17] at Paul's life and say that's the
[1:02:19] pattern in other words God's going to
[1:02:21] forgive me of all my foolish ignorance
[1:02:24] amen God's not going to hold my past
[1:02:25] against me right I might have to suffer
[1:02:28] for my past but God is going to form
[1:02:30] Christ in me the hope of glory like Paul
[1:02:34] said even though he suffered he said it
[1:02:35] was Christ working in me mightily praise
[1:02:39] God I hope you can see that that God
[1:02:41] works in your life
[1:02:43] mightily he works in your life more
[1:02:45] mightily than denominational churches
[1:02:47] look at the Catholic church this week
[1:02:48] did you see what the pope said the pope
[1:02:51] put out the letter and he said all you
[1:02:52] priests you need to bless homosexual
[1:02:55] marriages he said but at the same time
[1:02:58] we're still we are still uh our our our
[1:03:01] Doctrine is still one man and one woman
[1:03:03] but we can bless homosexual marriages
[1:03:05] and you know what the preachers said
[1:03:06] about this they said this causes so much
[1:03:09] confusion and the church said who is
[1:03:12] Mystery Babylon what does Babylon mean
[1:03:16] confusion in the same letter God blesses
[1:03:20] homosexual marriages oh but yet we're
[1:03:22] still one man and one woman that's total
[1:03:25] confusion right and I was shocked I was
[1:03:27] listening to this pres I was listening
[1:03:28] to a presbyterian preacher read through
[1:03:30] the article that they put up and he's
[1:03:32] like this is so much confusion he said
[1:03:33] maybe some of our Catholic friends will
[1:03:35] come out and he kept using the word
[1:03:36] confusion aren't you confused confused
[1:03:38] confused I'm like Lord the Lord's like
[1:03:40] smacking me waking me up that's what
[1:03:42] Babylon is right it's confusion but not
[1:03:45] here we have the right divided word of
[1:03:49] truth it's is clear to me night and day
[1:03:53] God wants one man and one woman the rest
[1:03:55] is an abomination
[1:03:58] in notice she's the mother of
[1:04:01] Abominations the mother of all that but
[1:04:04] what do we have our mother is the New
[1:04:06] Jerusalem praise God in other words our
[1:04:08] motherland is
[1:04:10] heaven that's going to be my Mother's
[1:04:11] Day message I think but I'm going to
[1:04:13] preach on the future home I think so
[1:04:15] just don't probably forget about till
[1:04:16] I'll probably forget about it too how we
