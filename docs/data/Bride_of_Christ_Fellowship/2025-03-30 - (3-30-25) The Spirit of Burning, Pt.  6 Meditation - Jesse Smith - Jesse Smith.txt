========================================

there preach a little bit further I wasn't planning on that I was planning on doing a a different example of the spirit of burning but as I studied this morning just something opened up in a simple way and uh so I'm going to preach on uh the spirit of burning and our our subtopic will be meditation by God's grace Psalm 39 verse3 so I preached Psalm 39 on Wednesday and I was at home getting ready for bed I was listening to brother Simon's sermon and Simon was preaching out of Psalm 392 so I just like when I get a second witness sometimes it's nice to to get that by the grace of God Psalm 39 of course A Psalm of David seems to be that he wrote this while uh being chased down by his father-in-law let's read verse three we'll read that on three one two three my heart was hot within me while I was musing the fire burned then spake I with my tongue amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of Thy word you can be seated so as I thought further on this uh story here of David I I like to change you know what I what I kind of classify this as David had the spirit of burning to meditate on his service so I want to just shorten to that there's so much power in meditation that's kind of the thought that opened up again this morning as I was just studying um so Isaiah had the burning to put him into service Jeremiah had the burning to keep him in service keep him from quitting Copus and his friend had the burning to uh dissolve the doubt about their service and David had the burning to meditate on his service Hallelujah and we look how important this is you know um Psalm 39 you know I looked at some of the commentaries and uh this is a powerful chapter that even Jews and Christians have used over the years when you're going through times of mour and you're reflecting On Life's uh the the the fleetness how how life is fleeting the the quick movement of Life how many are surprised by how fast time moves I am constantly even a teenager can say Amen uh let alone grandfather or father mother Hallelujah but life is so fleeting and you know Believers down through the years have gone to this chapter to get encouragement when life seems like it's moving so fast or uh they're going through times of mourning because David was mourning here as we we saw he was crying out to God and he felt God's face and judgment was upon him because of the wrong things he said right he said some things he should not have said and uh he really made a vow really at the beginning of the chapter to watch what comes out of his mouth praise God and I'm sure we've all been there where we've said things we wish we wouldn't have said but we've got to live with our mistakes we've got to cry out to God and and then do better the next time by keeping a bridal Upon Our mou mouth praise God so David learned this a man after God's Own Heart could say things that he regretted he was ashamed of and that God was chastening him for it's as if God's face was so close to him judging him as you should not have said that kind of reminds us of how he numbered the people right and he just did wrong and he repented and all those thousands of people uh lost their lives of course that would that their own sin played into that but God just allowed David to make his mistake at the same time as they were God doesn't punish other people for other people's mistakes God is faithful Hallelujah but here this chapter is a uh it's a a chapter of meditation on how our life our human strength is so weak at times and yet despite that God's power is Sovereign in our lives we're so weak but we must remember God is strong hallelujah hallelujah that's what this chapter is about it gives Timeless wisdom about how we should humble ourselves repent and the importance of putting our hope in God because everything of this world the hope of it will fade away Hallelujah and the only thing you're going to take with you is your character hallelujah it's a beautiful chapter as we read verse three see his heart got hot when he was meditating on God now Church we're going to get there in just a moment but meditation is one of the hard things in this day remember it's prophesied it's thus sayith the Lord this is the day of greatest deception because Paul wrote it he said evil seducers will wax worse and worse so we have to be very careful the people around us that they're not seducing us into a a state of deception and especially happens at churches where they get seduced that everything's okay and everything's all right but we we know the Holy Spirit if we sin we know the holy spirit's going to chasen us and correct us hallelujah so what I mean is we can't let uh we can't let ourselves be deceived if we have sin in our lives it's got to be cleaned out praise God or we can never move on with God right we can't be seduced in thinking everything's okay if there's sin laying in our lives that hasn't been repented of Hallelujah that's the day that's the that's the temptation of the the deception of this day right uh they're rich and increase with Goods have need of nothing but Jesus said you need some eyes out so you can clearly see the spirit of judgment on your life amen you can clearly judge your own life is my life pleasing to God right now that's what we want to know praise God now I love this uh as as he's meditating what happens once the fire of God starts burning in his heart what happens verse four he says Lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that I might know how frail I am so the Holy Ghost Came Upon David and he said God I want to know how it's all going to end now with him it ended in peace right he was buried in the city of David and named after him and that's how his end was it was in peace he had established Solomon right Solomon was established ordain key his life ended in peace it didn't end by the hands of Saul although he thought it was remember we taught that the Bible said the the Bible said he thought in his heart Saul is going to destroy me but see God showed him that's not going to be your end I have Grace for you how many want Grace for the end of your life praise God I want Grace as well Hallelujah and David got Grace because he was a man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah and he said make me to know the measure of my days how long do I have Lord how long do I have help me to see how weak and frail I am help me to know that I might feel right strong right now I'm I'm 18 years old I'm 26 or 27 right is it 27 brother 27 27 28 okay sorry brother Mercy how old are you 27 amen these young young Brothers Hallelujah enjoy it but even in my whatever age I am help me to know how frail and how short life is because it's not going to last forever remember the Bible said it's like grass that grows up we're we're starting to see the grass come up right now but we just saw how it all withered away last November December withered away till it's brown dark brown then light brown and then then die breaks off and new life has to come forth help us to see the end of our days this is what this church this is what the Holy Ghost will move you to meditate upon how much time do I have left Oh Glory remember when brother R was leaning on his bed like this and he went beyond the curtain of time what was he meditating on oh there it is brother Jose he said Lord I'm 56 years old and I haven't I'm sorry I'm 50 and I haven't done anything for you yet and the church said he's already won a million Souls and he's just meditating sleeping on his bed Lord I haven't done anything for you and then he says he starts seeing his theophany separate from his physical body and he looked down and see it and what does the voice say keep pressing the reward is great for you Hallelujah Divine love is the only thing that'll get you there hallelujah amen I I didn't catch that till right now praise God Amen see meditating what how much time do I have left in my life what what can I do with the rest of my life how can I serve God in a way that would please him despite Church despite our weaknesses despite our human fra frailties and failures how can I give God the rest of my life Hallelujah and I say this with my honesty of all honesty of my heart it has been the privilege of my life to preach the gospel these 21 years by God's grace if I could go back brother uh brother Chris I would go back and I'd start preaching sooner if I had the choice because there I know the world can never satisfy us we'll never be truly happy the Bible says there's no peace to the wicked no matter how they present it with their red red carpets and all their extravagant uh events and everything and all their medals that they hold and trophies it's all vanity Hallelujah and there's only peace to those who are in Christ Jesus hallelujah it's the privilege of my life to crack open my bible every morning or get on my knees and say God bless this day I don't know how it's going to turn out I don't know what you have in store but help me today hallelujah amen you're my only hope Hallelujah that's what David says you're my only hope he says you made my days in verse five as a hand breath mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity surely every man walketh in a vain show we had a Bible study with a couple middle middle schoolers on Thursday and I showed them the verse there in Ecclesiastes chapter 2 where David said I gave myself uh all the permission to build everything I'm sorry Solomon I gave all my permission to build everything to get everything uh to give myself to even even to humor to women uh to riches i g I gave myself license to do everything and he said it all turned out to be vanity and how does a man who's regretted his whole life how does he end his life he ends it with Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and said to keep the fear of the Lord fear God and keep his Commandments for everything we do will come under the Judgment of God hallelujah but remember he'll forgive our mistakes right because there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus the only word he's going to give us and judge us is going to say Well done brother Nia good and faithful servant just be good amen just be good to people hallelujah amen just be faithful to Christ Hallelujah and this is what God offers a man who will just meditate he'll take time off to meditate and say Lord how much longer do I have I've only got a few more years or how much time do I have I'm frail I'm weak I feel like I can't do it anybody ever feel like that I can't do it by myself I got to have help Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost burned on David's heart verse 7 and now Lord what wait I for what am I waiting for I'm waiting for thee Hallelujah my hope is in thee God is going to have to make a way in the midst of My Crazy Life in the midst of the uncertainty of my life the only hope I have is if God steps in and he makes a way where there seems to be no way amen I I have no hope I see I'm weak I'm frail I can't do it by myself I failed so many times they said David said I could have said the wrong thing so many times I have no hope except God comes and helps me to tame my tongue or to to tame whatever desires or passions I struggle with throughout the day throughout the weeks throughout the years throughout the decades whatever I struggle with my only hope is Jesus Christ deliver me from all my amen Deliver Me From Myself Hallelujah Deliver Me From Myself he didn't even say enemies in this in this scripture Deliver Me From Myself make me not the reproach of the foolish and of course the rebukes in verse 10 remove remove thy stroke so see God was spanking him God was uh God was chastening him training him rebuking him take the rebuke away I'm consumed by the blow of thine hand I feel like I've had enough I feel like I've suffered enough for my mistakes God let uh let the mercies come new in the morning give me a fresh start for for your mercies are new Every Morning how many know Joy comes in the morning praise God and church this is a song it's actually a prayer in verse 12 as well hear my prayer oh Lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace and my tears so he was crying he was so concerned about how am I going to make it through he was crying Hallelujah and what's the Bible say God is nigh God is close to all those who are of a broken heart and a contrite spirit when you're crying when you're really sincere with God that's when God's near praise God he's not going to come near to the people say thank God I'm not like the Baptist thank God I'm not like the Lutheran thank God I'm like that message church thank God I'm not like that message church he comes to those who see their own Frailty and realize their only hope is in yielding to the Holy Spirit remember the Bible said it's not wise to judge oneself by other people right Paul said that in Corinthians we preach on that recently well kind of recently and so David gives us this uh testimony that whenever we stop to meditate on God's word it'll start to burn in our hearts that's why sitting down or maybe it's for you whatever is laying down however you read your Bible and talk to the Lord and then just stop and meditate however you do that the spirit of God will come on you and you'll feel his peace in that moment you'll feel his power you'll feel his burning sensation Hallelujah burning out all your worries Hallelujah burning out all your your cares Hallelujah burning that out and saying Lord I'm frail you're my only hope I need your help today amen amen and church if a man after God's Own Heart meditated on what's remaining of his service we should we should too do the same right we too should do the same because we claim to be a bride after the heart of Christ Our husband our spiritual husband the Lord Jesus Christ and remember the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 11 1-4 that we're to be a Chase virgin to Christ and they were the Corinthians were when they F when you first get saved and and you're forgiven you're clean as clean can be the word Chase means pure from carnality it means Immaculate ah clean you ever walk into a store and like you're like it's Immaculate in here you ever anybody ever heard that that's why I like going to the Apple Store you know it's Immaculate in here they just or you know Target or wherever you go you know if they keep it clean that's how you are before Christ Hallelujah but see then the enemy fights you with mind battles and we fall short but remember church as soon as we confess our sins he makes us Immaculate again Hallelujah immaculately clean praise God because what is this context about it's about losing mind battles let's go there Second Corinthians 11 because she was uh deceived in her mind so complexes mind Battle 2 Corinthians 11 I'm going to finish verse two I've espoused you to one husband Church you are engaged to Jesus Christ what a privilege Hallelujah you're engaged to the Son of God the king of Heaven Hallelujah the king of the Millennium the king of kings and Lord of lords that's who you're engaged to praise God I know a lot of you were excited when you got engaged the natural but we ought to be a lot more excited for our spiritual engagement praise God hallelujah it's eternal life he says verse three but I fear lest by any means as a serpent beg guiled Eve Temptation deceived through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that's in Christ see always keep it simple always keep your Christian walk simple before God right what what was Eve just don't touch it right that that was all Eve had to say or learn don't touch the fruit it's so simple but the deception got in there well you can touch it surely you won't die and you know God knows when you do it you know it'll be a different than what it's actually been said there's a different consequence to what you've been told no church sin it will always lead to death Hallelujah sin will always lead to death so see this is how we keep our spiritual cleanliness this is how we remain spiritually immaculate Hallelujah keep your mind on the Simplicity that's in Christ I love the seven Thunders I love the Seven Seals we know those are deep Hallelujah we know Revelation 10 is deep my wife and I were talking about this that this week there's a lot of scriptures that are pretty deep and there's times we'll go into those praise God but don't lose the fact that the gospel is a simple gospel the good news is simple praise God Jesus Christ died to save Sinners of whom you and I feel like we're the chief of them Hallelujah and then if he died to save us then we're saved praise God and we must keep our sins confessed Hallelujah and keep Jesus Christ as our only hope the word meditate in Webster's Dictionary means to engage in contemplation or reflection so reflect is of course to go back and think about what happened so when you stop to reflect on what happened what happened in my life that's a state of meditation reflection it also means to engage in mental exercise such as uh concentrating for the purpose of reaching a heightened level of spiritual awareness now the world perverts it with yoga and all this positive reinforcement I can speak this I can speak that I can speak that they can't speak nothing except deception praise God nothing but lies I should say they can only speak lies and deception Satan might give them you know Satan gave uh Satan could have gave Jesus all the kingdoms right he can give Satan can reward people praise God they can speak that into existence but it only leads to death but there is truth in the fact that we should meditate on the word of God and raise our spiritual condition if you read your Bible this morning it should have if you prayed this morning if you meditated this morning it should have raised your spiritual condition or maybe did it last night any time you spend with God it's supposed to give you a heightened spirituality so then you can walk away close the book walk away and be ready to take on life's uh challenges or maybe the joys of Life how many enjoy the the good seasons of life it's not all challenges it's not all briers hallelujah it's not all thorns we're to enjoy the good moments as well praise God but approach them with a spiritual mindset so Sinners pervert meditation but Christians are battled by Satan Satan tries to keep us from meditating Satan tries to keep us from meditation uh a third definition of meditation means to focus one's thoughts on to reflect and ponder over I do that often while I'm driving I'm it's been said too you do it while you're in the shower you know when you're just doing like just walking when you're just doing like regular mundane things it might be at work you know if you just got mundane tasks at work you know you can just do something quickly and while you're just doing this kind of uh monotonous work you start meditating see God can come to you wherever you are praise God as Samson pushed that uh uh that grinder as Samson went around the circle grinding again and again he just got down to meditate that was a time for him to meditate I meditate while I'm washing dishes like last night that's a good time of meditation I love I love those moments although I hate washing dishes I hate washing or you might say I hate laundry right we do but the fact is if we can get into some of that and but then bring Christ into it it'll it'll make it a lot better by God's grace I'm not saying make it fun not washing dishes is never going to be fun but I also often find that's a great time to meditate just I got brother brandom singing there you know I put that's my Saturday night routine just put on brother brandom and wash the dishes and think about all the joys of Christian Life and just a great time to meditate the fourth definition uh meditate means to plan or project in your mind to so make a a purpose make an intention I intend to do this tomorrow how many times we leave church and say I'm GNA I intend to do this tomorrow that's a good thing that means you reflected at church now may God help you to carry it out better praise God hallelujah so that's that's what meditation is you have an intent I've thought about the past and I'm intending now to do this so see how meditation should be an important part of every church service Hallelujah we should stop now of course there's going to be times we meditate more than others right we go through in difficult trials as as David was we're going through in times of uh testing Hallelujah when we go through times of Trials we're going to spend a little more time meditating during those times now church as you know there is a difference between prayer and meditation prayer is you talking right or God talking to you which you know for us it's not as much as maybe a prophet of course of course but prayer is when you're thanking God the Bible says that uh we give thanks we get when we praise God when we express praise or Thanksgiving or we make requests as Philippians 4 said make your requests knowto God oh God provide the need oh God forgive me oh God help me here next week oh God minister to that individual that's prayer Hallelujah when you're when you're offering praise confessing your sin giving thanks making requests in to God but remember prayer can be silent too can you pull 1st Samuel 11113 remember Eli thought Hannah was drunk because she was just praying silently and her just lips were moving now Hannah she spake in her heart so see there's times there there's times where we say God listen to my heart listen to my heart only her lips move but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she'd been drunk and she was drunk with the Holy Ghost praise God Hallelujah that's right just so just so removed from the natural thing she was just praising God P the Bible said she poured out her soul unto God now meditation knows different meditation is where you're thinking you're reflecting you're pondering about the past or making intentions for the future you know I got spring break coming up this week I got I'm doing a lot of meditation about what I can accomplish you this week a lot of plans now only half of them will probably come to pass but that's an example of you're just thinking deeply and reflecting on something to come now the world will tell you empty your mind right that's what uh some of these religions will tell you empty your mind and and the meditation with Christians is exactly opposite fill your mind with what God has done in the past hallelujah amen fill your mind with what God has already done and what God can do praise God what he may do or even what he has promised to do for example he's promised to never leave you nor forsake you he's promised no weapon that's formed against you shall prosper that's a promise Hallelujah so meditation is actually filling your mind with what God has done what God is doing and what God is going to do praise God most of us don't engage in this as much as we ought to and of course there's overlap how many ever had that in overlap you'll be praying and pretty then and then after you might pause and just think about oh I remember that I remember that that's that's a combination of prayer and meditation so just to kind of give us uh a little a little differentiation between prayer and meditation they should go together Hallelujah they should take place now why do we need it because there's so many things going on in our lives the Bible said in the last times it'll be Troublesome times there's so many troubles in the world there's so many cares there's so many things we care about because we have to have them to live physically right so we need to stop sometimes from uh well we need to stop every day I would say and meditate on the word of God because there's troubles that bring us fear right what does trouble make us feel usually fear h and things that we just can't control Hallelujah sometimes we all I mean uh sometimes we hear about people that are uh not I want to say the right word not a control but something else uh someone who just needs a lot of control I I don't like to use that word f re a k i don't like to use that so much especially not in the house of God but some people who just have they want to have so much control and church God allows us to have some control over our lives but there's so much he doesn't allow us to have control over and so in those moments we need to meditate on God and ask God to help us to Hope in him so we need meditation David needed meditation because he ran things were uncertain his life for years he had all these promises you're going to be king someday you're going to be great and you're going to do all these things and your uh your lineage is going to bring forth the Messiah and he's like how am I even going to survive everything around him was telling him it didn't look very good oh but he's only looking with the natural eyes may God give us spiritual eyesight Hallelujah like B said faith is uh faith is a long-term Vision when you when you're Anointed with faith you see a far ways off and you know God's going to bring me around this Hallelujah like that song set your wings uh set your wings to The Winds of Faith right God God will either uh he either take you through the mountain or around the mountain or over the mountain God's going to bring you through your trial praise God God that's right so we need meditation in our lives and we saw that's when David got the hope of God when he was meditating on the Frailty of his life now if you have your Bibles let's look at there's only church there's only 20 verses that say the word meditation so I was pleasantly surprised this morning we're not going to hit all of them um but I just want you to observe a few important things about the verses on meditation we're not going to go there but in Genesis 2463 the first time meditation is mentioned is when the prophet Isaac he goes out to meditate in the field at night time so think about this this is how a prophet ended his day he didn't want to end the day with all the fear about what could happen oh when is my wife going to come oh what when is my dad GNA pass away all these things he could have been wondering right his mom had already passed away he didn't want to end the day with fear in his house so he took a walk in nature and the church said amen he went for a walk at night time now you might go running in the morning that might be or walking in the morning whatever you do like I I met a pastor this weekend he's a trinitarian guy he likes to go running in the morning to clear his mind that's good I like that but the prophet Isaac and I say Prophet because he prophesied numerous things in the scripture he was definitely a prophet Abraham Isaac Jacob Jacob was a prophet as well they had Visions dreams God spoke thus sayith the Lord to them and it happened but he ends his day he closes out his day by spending some time in nature and then meditating just on the things of God at the evening time and when did Rebecca appear at the evening time what are we living in we're living in the spiritual end time it's a type of the Rapture Hallelujah so how does a Godly Man how does a Godly Prophet end the day he goes out in nature and meditates thinks about God now we all need help with that CU all I can think think about is just hitting the bed at the end of the day so I I need some help in my life but that's why we do Bible time at the end of the day so we can try to get our minds meditating on the things of the Lord so the very first example we have is a prophet who's waiting for his bride now that Isaac who does he type Jesus Christ right so we get this idea uh of the Lord Jesus is waiting for us hallelujah and it's she's going the bride's going to come he's going to Rapture her at just the right time praise God Jesus p Jesus always thinks good thoughts right remember Jeremiah 29 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you thoughts of Peace thoughts of goodness and not of evil to give you an expected end I appreciate those amens Hallelujah the second example is Joshua in Joshua 1 ver8 you know Joshua's like Lord Moses is dead the prophet's gone how do I get Victory he said meditate on the word of God day and night amen that and I told the brother like I told that Pastor we went over to a pastor's house a trinitarian pastor uh Thursday night and that's why his name is Joshua I said you got a great name brother Joshua that's and that's the only time God ever used the word success in the whole Bible was Joshua if you meditate on the word of God and you keep the commands you'll be a good success how many want to be a success Hallelujah that's what David was wondering how many years do I got left I'm a frail man what's my end going to be like what uh uh if it comes to my fure funeral how's it all going to end what's it all going to be like Hallelujah am I going to know that I was a successful preacher or Pastor are you going to know your successful mother or father or individual we all want to know am I going to be successful and God has the answer yes because you'll meditate on the word of God am you got to you and I have got to keep the word on our minds Hallelujah and keep it on our minds all throughout the day Hallelujah so look look at look at these names so far look at these names of men who had to meditate Isaac the promised son type of Jesus Christ Joshua the greatest military General in the whole Bible other than the Lord because he was following the the Lord of hosts the Lord Jesus Christ and then church the major writer guess who's the major writer meditation David a type of Christ so look at the men here that God uses to be those who which men would take time to go and meditate Isaac Moses I'm sorry Joshua David men that we know we know they're some of the greatest in the Hall of Fame of Faith Hallelujah that's right so the first time David mentions meditation of course is Psalm chapter 1 if you have your Bible let's go go to Psalms we're going to just spend some time in Psalms here I'm only 30 minutes into my message and I might have an hour left we'll kind of see how that goes we'll see Psalm chapter 1 very familiar as it ought to be verse one blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly don't let people don't let people give you the wrong counsel and don't take their counsel take the word of God nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful see don't don't don't make fun don't don't don't look at people with scorn look on them with Grace Hallelujah don't scorn people don't look down on them feel compassion for them I know it's hard church I know we've had a lot of bad politicians these last few years but I've had to battle scorn for them but I got to look at them with compassion verse two but his Delight so what is the Delight of the blessed man or the Blessed woman their Delight is in the law of the Lord I just love the word I just love the word and I got to share my testimony with that uh uh trinitarian pastor and it was just nice it was nice to reflect okay I was meditating that's right I just said I said I got saved to the chapel but then when my brother brought the message I told him I said I just fell in love with the word I just couldn't get enough I just wanted to and brother John and I John Graham uh we love the word so much brother bang we we asked brother Craig brother Craig can we take a copy of your notebook he had notebook with all his Bible studies can we make a copy of that I just want to go we going to go copy at the copy machine and so we did we copied his notes so we could just flip through and like oh this it's like treasure after treasure after treasure now we want to have that same love right now that we had back then and see how the enemy is trying to get us away from that you don't got to say Amen because you you're probably saying ouch but see how Satan tries to rob us of our first love just the Delight oh such a delight to hear the word of God Satan tries to make other things look so much more interesting or so maybe this will help me what's going to help you is meditating on the word of God that's the only thing that's going to help you and me I'm talking about myself is that we hope in the Lord and this was all brought about by what the spirit of burning the spirit burning inside of him saying oh God help me forgive me this all came about as he meditated and he realized the importance of remembering God remembering what he's done and then meditating on what he's going to do Hallelujah I think of how our church started you know in the in the homes there in John Graham's home and my home and then that first rental place we had where the ceiling fell through and if you would have told me uh that one day we'd be in a place like this I would have shouted and danced and scream dreamed all around the house praise God CU this is such a nice place compared to where we were you know just thinking about meditating God's going to do great God's going to take care of it eventually praise God I can trust God with my future and like the Bible says godliness with contentment is great gain help me to be content while I'm hoping in you Lord God whatever the current condition is help me to trust in God so David said this is how a blessed man is he meditates in the word of God day and and in his law doth he meditate day and night so see you got to start your day with Christ you got to end your day with Christ meditating on the things of God I mean I've known numerous people that go to bed listening to music or go to bed listening to brother Brenham and that's always been a great help to them Hallelujah so however if if there's ever any change you need to make in your life let's get our advice right here from the scripture from a man who knew how to meditate on God David said I'm doing it day and night and what shall he be like what's a blessed man like he's like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also doth not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now notice he's always got the fruits the fruits in his or her life they're always available for people to take and enjoy I'm going to go back to Thursday night with that uh trinitarian Pastor it was nice I got into an unexpected debate on the godhead and boy I was happy brother van I was like oh this is what I was born for Hallelujah I was like ask me bro ask me but you know what we got we got to the spot where he said well I believe you're a heretic now if I didn't have the fruits of the spirit I might have got from the table and I've never done this but slam the table and say honey let's go get the kids we're out of here he called me a heretic and I just smiled and said well yeah yeah that's fine I understand that I've been called a heretic a lot and I personally believe that all trinitarians are Heretics but I I believe you can be saved see I had some fruit out there that he could enjoy the the sweetness and the kindness of the Holy Spirit not getting upset well you don't believe it the way I do you're just a blind leosan organization denominational Jezebel whatever no God's people always have fruit that's hanging there that people can enjoy now is there a time to be mad yes Jesus shows us that but said that's actually the Pastor when Jesus took the cord brother R said that's the pastor cleaning out the church so I got a license to be mad sometimes and church so do you the Bible said be angry and sin not and the church said there's a time to be angry and that that can be a fruit of the Holy Spirit hating sin right that's a good fruit of the Holy Spirit hatred for sin that's the fear of the Lord reverence for God but also we want to have such fruits where if people you know condemn us or rebuke us right to our face we can just smile said next question please Hallelujah and then the brother said or the preacher said he woke up the next morning at 4:15 a.m. thinking about me and the godhead so I'm like all right I can't all right give me some emails here all right let's go because we've got thus saith the Lord we have thus sayith the Lord God is one person Hallelujah and see if we just meditate on that it was amazing as I just meditated all these things just kept coming back we just got to meditate on God that's where I like to see if I'm that that way I know I'm planted I'm planted if I know I've got fruits even for the people that might could call me a heretic to my face it's been a while usually I'm called heretic on the phone you know in the YouTube comments it's been a while since I've been called a heretic to my face that's okay I got the love of God hallelujah how great is the love of God Amen Psalm chapter 5 if you want to turn there verse one give ear unto my words oh Lord consider my meditation what a prayer God remember my prayer and remember what I meditated about you see you got to have we have both God hears our prayers and we also want God to remember Lord remember when I took those maybe those five minutes maybe it was 10 minutes maybe it was a half an hour and I just stopped to think about the good things of God how God has been so good to me church that's why I think you know you and I I think that's why we love testimony Services because it's just like meditating on oh what a great story sister shared what a great story brother oh it's like it's like a meditation time oh if God did that for him God did that for her God do that for you God can do that for me it's just like a time of meditation so who wants to have a testimony service tonight no you

prayers remember my meditation I'm in a desperate time my king and my God for unto thee will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in the morning right that's what he said day and night I'm going to meditate in the night and the in the early in the day how many times have I prayed that in my prayer closet Lord the Bible says you'll hear my voice in the morning and Lord I'm fulfilling the scripture today my voice you're going to hear this morning oh Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and I'll look up to heaven oh God I need your help from heaven today strengthen me I got a busy week coming up or I've got the busiest time of of the year for my job help me Lord God how many times have I prayed that recently we've just had so much going on at school and I've just I've just seen that every time even in my mistakes if I forget something as long as I put God first God allows everything to work out I get everything done just right on time by the grace of God because there's a time and season for everything and if you put God first God said I'll he said I'll make everything everything I'll give you everything that you have need of if you just put me first everything will be added unto you Psalm 19:1 Psalm 19:1 we'll just do a a tour through psalms here today the songs of a true man of God verse 11 moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there's great reward in keeping the word of God who can understand his Hees cleanse thou me from secret faults so of course A Psalm of David I can't even understand why I do some of the things I do and God keep me from Secret faults right in other words Lord convict me when I'm all by myself in secret and I sin convict me of that keep me from that it's easy to act holy around everybody here at church everybody looks all clean today everybody looks happy everybody's singing today it's easy to act holy around everybody else David knew I need God I need you to help me even when I'm all alone that's when I need it keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins AR those are arrogant sins when you're just so prideful keep me from arrogant prideful sins like Uzziah I'll just take my place as a I I can be a priest if I want to I've given God 60 years of service I can do what I want and he broke out with Leprosy keep me from arrogant sins we can't do whatever we want we have to do what God has called us to do whatever God wants us to do let them not have dominion over me hallelujah oh God help me not to become addicted to any sin God keep me from getting a complex that I can't overcome break down the strongholds in my life hallelujah amen keep me pure God then shall I be an upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression oh Hallelujah see church if we just invite God into our day every day it'll keep us from great big things that that would that other churches might hear about oh did you hear what happened in arran did you hear what happened in Napoleon did you hear what happened in albian God help us to live so close to you that we don't have any great transgressions for people to gossip about or even to share just as a fact for warning how's that done through God keep me from Secret sins keep me from addictions of sin that's how it's done let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer Hallelujah so he said help me to meditate on the things of God so so often we meditate on all the problems that might happen right so often we meditate even this week church I was woken up and uh all this fear came on me what was it um and I just had to lay there and just ask God to help me not to fear I forget what it was and it was just totally I didn't even expect it I just woke up and and all this fear came on me I just had to wait it out until I could get through it it like just like an attack something like I was going to lose everything you know just one of those feelings just comes on me at times and it hasn't always been this way hasn't always been this way I feel like I've been attacked by the spirit of fear so often these last few years but I've got to battle it I've got to overcome it and I've got to choose to meditate on what God's word says and not the fears of the future I think there's a song fears not my future if I'm not mistaken Psalm 49:3 Psalm 49:3 my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding understanding so in other words I'll meditate on the things that I understand see church if we don't meditate on what we understand then it might lead us to our imaginations to get some to imagine something bad going to happen what do I understand about God focus on what focus on that what do we understand about God's character that's what we need to meditate on and church we're going to have a few minutes of meditation at the end of the service okay so just prepare yourself I want everybody to be quiet I want you to Bow your head or what you can stand and raise your hands whatever you want to do but take a we're going to take a few minutes and just meditate on what God has done because if you haven't done it yet today you're missing out you're missing out on the peace that passes all understanding I don't want to miss out on that and that's how you become blessed right blessed is the man who does what meditates on the word of God verse 15 in uh chapter 49 but God will redeem my soul from the power of the Grave for he shall receive me so this was his meditation you know David could list all his problems I've got this problem that problem that problem if I talk to each of you I could say what how's it going you could tell me well this is a problem that's a problem I don't see how that's going to work out and David lists all his problems in some of these chapters but then he ends by saying but God is my hope praise God but God will redeem my soul I might lose everything I might lose my watch and I might lose my nice shoes or I might lose my glasses you might you might lose everything in life but as long as you don't lose your soul Hallelujah that's the most important thing commit your life into the keeper of your soul don't give your soul over to Satan or the pleasures of the world commit your soul unto Jesus Christ Hallelujah Psalm 63 look at the beginning a Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah this is not a time when it's a good time of life this is a time of uh cap or I'm sorry running from captivity this is a time of running from the law we'd say and he wasn't even guilty this is a time of distress verse one oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirst is for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is so see when you're on the run when you're going through distress that's when you'll really thirst for God right brother man preached that sermon called desperation was right after the token in 63 go uh brother B says it's human nature not to want to be in desperation nobody wants to be desperate so but we got to recognize when God brings us to that moment that's when we got to seek after God amen but said it's against human nature to get desperate unless there unless there are situations that bring you to desperation but he said when God brings that to you call upon God like David Hallelujah to see thy power and thy Glory as he's running from Saul so as I have seen thee in thy Sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life he's calling God this loving you're so lovingly kind while he's running from a murderer Hallelujah in other words the loving kind God allowed me to get in this awful situation that I think's awful must not be that awful if the loving kindness of God allowed me to get into it this guy's a murder he killed the priests he's a murderer he killed 80 people were innocent and now he's after me and he can still say God help us he can still say God you are so loving and kind your loving kindness is better than my life life because I'm about to lose my life now that's what he thought of course God rescued him but can we say that when we go through difficult times can we stop for a moment and say Lord uh things look awful they look Bleak they look uh tragic but your loving kindness is better than my entire life in other words if I live or die you're still the same loving God you're still kind to me you've been good to me that's one thing I know God has been good to me I don't deserve it you you don't deserve it either we don't deserve it but God has been loving to us so kind So Unworthy but his Mercy has extended to us because your loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee Hallelujah I like verse eight my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand up holdeth me God's holding me up and I'm following after God's word so what are you going to do this week brother Chris what are you going to do brother van this week I'm GNA follow after Christ I'm gonna get down in that church age book or you place whatever you want in there you see that I'm gonna follow I'm following where God's leading me Church God's leading me in the spirit of burning so I'm F I'm just following I did not choose to preach this series this is God that was the last thing I I mean I was trying to finish Corinthians look I had to take take take this pause and how much have I enjoyed Corinthians I've enjoyed it tremendously see but I'm following somebody I'm following the Lord Jesus Christ I'm following those blood bloody Footprints Hallelujah wherever he leads me that's where I'm going to follow where you headed this week well I'm going to head down into the church age book or the seven seal book I'm just following and I'm not following lightly I'm following hard I'm I'm giving all my diligence to follow the word hallelujah Psalm 77 verse 11 7711 I will remember the works of the Lord now here's here's here's here's what we're going to meditate on at the end I'll remember the works of the Lord surely I'll remember the wonders of old I will meditate also of all thy Work and the talk of thy doings thy way oh God is in the sanctuary who is so who is so great a God as our God that's what we forget many times how great God is you know uh on this point here I think I'll just share it now I remember the works of the Lord I'll surely remember the wonders of old so brother bang I told the testimony of your dad being healed down there in Junction City because I felt it tied in I felt God healed brother vang's dad in order to Grant him a a season of his life to have a changed heart because that's what they testified of God changed his heart in that season and then he went home and I said I said said that was that was a supernatural move of God and I said and then then I applied it to the man who had just had his life taken from him in front of his children I said this was his time to go but two years before this he repented and I baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he went through two difficult years but the last three months of his life starting in January a new friend came into his life and started giving him hope teaching him the scripture and and and his last text the night before he passed away was he was so excited about what God was going to do in his life uh he felt he was in the perfect will of God and this is something to remember if you love God and if you're chosen before the foundation World God will work it out so you'll be ready to go meet him when it's your time and he's gracious enough to extend your time if you're not ready when it's your time Hallelujah that's how great God is he did it with that woman who drown remember the young mother drown when brother said you owe me an understanding brother B said I shouldn't have said that he said God let me pout it out for three or four months pouted out like a baby God wouldn't answer me god didn't give me any Visions did God didn't get any any dreams so I went to the mother of that yeah I went to the mother of that young mother and she said oh that's right last year she almost drowned at a family function and her husband saved her and then between then between then in the time she actually passed away in the hospital she gave her heart to the Lord and was baptized by brother brandham and then brother BR said oh foolish how foolish I can be how foolish all of us can be but I'll remember what God has done I remember how God of old has been gracious and that he is God even in the midst of tragedy even in the midst of being chased down by a murderer like happened to David and like happened a couple weeks ago even in the midst of that you can see the grace of God that's what we need to meditate upon that God is God Psalm 10433 Psalm 10433 I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live see that's what that's that that's my plan that's brother Austin's plan he's going to keep singing keep making those songs here right Haven Haven that's your plan I'll sing as long as I live as long as God gives me breath to do it I'll song Lead praise God hallelujah I will sing praise to my God while I have my being my meditation of him shall be sweet so we should expect a sweet ending to the service if we're going to meditate on the Lord should be a sweet time oh God you've been so good to me you've done great works of old You' provided Time After Time After Time you've healed us Time After Time After Time I'm going to remember what you've done God I will be glad in the Lord I'm not going to be a sad Christian I'm not going to be a pouty uh complaining message believer I'm going to be glad believer I'm going be thankful for what God has done for me I'm sure that's how you want to be as well earlier in the chapter David rehearsed how Lord you sent the you you sent the waters for the Beast the fowl and the cattle and so the David knew if he's done that if he provides for all the beasts out there all the birds we all see those starlings think about that those huge swarms of Starlings God provides enough food for every single one of those starlings you you you would think those a starling like that all that group that would that would just ravish all these fields no there's plenty God has plenty to go around and the church said God's got plenty for you and I if we just trust him we have to trust almighty God he's God so he talks about this and then he says that then I'm going to meditate my meditation of him is going going to be sweet hallelujah how many know God is trustworthy amen Psalm 119 there are six mentions of meditation in Psalm 119 it is the longest chapter in the Bible so let's read those I'm about at an hour here so we're doing okay by God's grace Psalm 119:12 blessed art thou oh Lord teach me thy statutes with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth I have rejoice in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches I love the sermons as much as I appreciate the finances you gave me now I wonder how many can say that Hallelujah I enjoy the word as much as all the financial blessings God gives us I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways I will Delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget God's word I won't forget it as long as I live I won't forget it there is so this is my Bible that I've been working on for over a year I love you know some mornings I get done with my chapter and I'll go back to this is my little short this is my little checklist here or my little table contents of all my little bible studies I got in here I used to have them on those Post-it notes but I love just going back in I'm like oh that's right I forgot about that the Keys of the Kingdom and oh I forgot about that verse and it is so refreshing to just remember what I've already forgotten to I'll say it's so refreshing to remember the Revelation I've forgotten but we still have the promise no matter how much I forget brother Chris I've got the promise the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against my Revelation because it's not mine it's Christ's Revelation that he gave to us there is such a consolation there's such a refreshment oh that's right Nephilim and no man has ever seen God I use that this week with my trinitarian brother oh Psalm 119 oh I left lost my spot there let's go to verse uh 23 Psalm 11923 there's my hour Prince also did sit and speak against me but thy servant did meditate on thy statutes so when people speak evil about you just meditate on the word God will take care of it Hallelujah now I was thinking about that this week you know my some of the my hardest battles in the message have been some of my closest friends coming against me other people they have you know huge financial trials other people have health issues big- time health issues some people have marital issues uh some people violence like overseas Africa uh Congo we talked about that I mean some people have different battles I just thought well my this has been my battle that I've my main battle that I've had to fight over the years but church we don't get to choose our battles brother Ram says whatever God commits you to God commits you to some type of a certain battle so friends let's overcome by God's grace there's one thing I know that will help us all overcome from the love of God Amen right it's thus sayith the Lord we got to have Divine love if we want to make it over to the paradise of godah said God May commit you to death like John the Baptist uh God May commit you to suffering like St Paul where his eyes you know he couldn't see and then martyrdom he said whatever God commits you to it's God's prerogative It's God's purpose Hallelujah but the proof that God loves us is because he said so verse sorry 48 1948 I want to get my spot I know you're there hun I appreciate that Psalm 11948 I want to get back there okay my hands also will I lift up unto thy Commandments which I have loved and I will meditate in thy statutes first of all when was the last time some of us raised our hands because of the word was so good so that's on us we've got to lift our hands to God hallelujah and I will meditate see what you got to you have to open your heart and let God show you his word and then you'll fall in love with it Hallelujah and then when you fall in love with God's word it's easy to raise your hands hallelujah praise God glory to God 119 verse 78 here we see that the proud do not meditate on God's word let the proud be ashamed for they dealt perversely With Me Without a Cause but I will meditate in thy precepts see when people miss use you they pervert their ways before you the pr those are the proud people even when they mistreat you I'm still going to choose to meditate on God so see it's the greatest battle ever fought the Battle of your mind the Battle of your meditation I could say like that that's the greatest battle what will you meditate on what will you focus on David focused on God's word that's what's going to help us overcome verse 97 oh how I love thy law it is my meditation all the day what are you meditating about all day cyber trucks a joke Chipotle see we got to we got to recognize I we have to meditate on the word of God if something has come into our lives we have to recognize if we don't love the word something's come into our lives actually brother man calls it Idol if you love anything or meditate on anything more than God's word it is an idol the Bible says flee from idolatry run from it that's verse 97 yeah verse 98 uh thou through thy Commandments Hast made me wiser than my enemies not a pride but not to make us prideful for they are ever with me so his enemies are always surrounded him verse 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation think of that David David was wiser than all of his teachers because he just focused on the word of God that means sometimes teachers don't focus on the word of God but church if you focus on the word of God you'll be wiser than your teachers Hallelujah you know just like at school they'll try to teach you well it's okay for a a man to marry a man or a woman to marry a woman like they say no I'm Wiser than my teacher that's right right you guys are probably experienced that you're a lot wiser Hallelujah because you've heard the word of God verse oh did I read 99 yeah all the day meditate all the Day psalm 147 I'm sorry it's chapter 119 verse 147 same chapter I prevented the dawning of the morning now prevent is different than what it means today it means anticipate I anticipated the dawning of the morning and I cried I hoped in thy word oh God let something change this morning see the see the desperation God it's been an awful night it's been an awful day God made something change this morning in my life verse 148 my eyes prevent the night watches that I may meditate in thy word so so he's even looking forward to it my eyes anticipate I'm going have to be up watching all night or I've got a difficult night ahead of me that's okay I can choose to meditate on God's word all through the night Hallelujah see it all depends how you choose to invest your time in the midst of your trial are you going to invest it in meditating on the wrong thing or are we going to invest it I'm sorry invest it on meditating on the word of God when we go through trials that's our choice remember the pride of our hearts will CH will help us well I'm sorry the pride of our hearts will keep us from meditating it so if we humble ourselves we can meditate on the things of God Psalm uh okay that's the end of Psalm 119 those are all the verses there let's we're almost done here Psalm 143 verse 5 chapter 143 verse 5 Psalm 143:5 I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works all all the things he's done I Muse on the work of thy hands of course Muse is another word for meditate and Ponder consider so see how uh see how Isaac was fulfilling this he went out in nature and then he could he could see the hand of God he could experience God's love and mercy right he could see the creative power of God and he would just meditate on how great God is now Isaiah 33: uh 18 is a little difficult reading but let's read that it's the last time it's used in the New Testament as far as meditation Isaiah 33:18 I remember the oh sorry thank you thine heart shall meditate Terror where is the Scribe where is the receiver where is he that counted the towers this is actually a positive statement um the commentaries you know if you read the whole chapter this is basically saying you shall after this think of all the alarm and distress when the enemy destroyed the city saved the king shall reign in magnificence over all the nation this is Albert Barnes then enjoying peace and prosperity you shall recall the days of Terror and alarm and then sh and shall then ask with gratitude and astonishment where are they who cause this alarm Hallelujah so after you get after you get through a great trial you'll say why was I so afraid where's the person that brought all this trouble God has given me victory over my troubles Hallelujah and I'll meditate how did I get through that how what happened to my enemies God swept my enemies away praise God God swept all my problems away Hallelujah and I'll meditate on what God saved me from Hallelujah and there's twice in the whole new testament where the word meditation is used you probably remember this Luke 21:14 and 1 Timothy 4:1 15 been an hour and 10 minutes so I will'll finish up here pretty soon how many enjoying the word today amen we're to love God's precepts I love the word I love the scriptures I love it because there's there's truth there hallelujah it's God's word I'm reminded of what God has done and I know he'll do something similar again because he's the same yesterday today and forever settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what you shall answer this is when you get this is when Christians will be persecuted and thrown before judges and magistrates and this is this is quite a statement right because in my mind I want to get every everything for a debate I want to get it ready to go but Jesus says if you're going to be persecuted he said specifically don't meditate on that don't meditate on your answers just meditate on God don't meditate on what's going to win you the debate what's going to help don't meditate on that just keep your focus on how good God is church that's how it had to been isn't that how it had to been for Stephen to be able to say Lord hold this not to their charge think of that because the whole time he would have thought man these bunch of Sinners I'm his human mind could have thought uh they're going to be condemned to hell he didn't meditate on it he just let God let God give him that one chapter remember Acts chapter 7 is like one sermon of course he wasn't a preacher but it's one it starts out with Abraham goes all the way down to Solomon and then he says you're Circ you're uncircumcised of heart and ear and you resist the Holy Ghost then he said Lord lay it not to their charge there's no way he could have premeditated all that Jesus gave him the words to say at the right time in times when I've been accused or whatever more I don't meditate on what to say I just let and I you can't right you just wait on God and God will give you the words to say in that moment praise God hallelujah so when you go through a persecution you go when when you're placed before your enemies or anything like that remember the David said you made a table before me in the presence of my enemies there's going to be times you're sitting right across the table from an enemy and God ordained that table God brought you to that table so don't worry about about what you're going to say God will give you what to say at that time how many want Faith to trust in God Amen for when you're right before sitting right before your enemy God brought this together like Esther I always think of Esther a table with hmon she didn't have to meditate on what to say God gave her what to say and God will give you and I what to say in the presence of our enemies and the last one first Timothy 4:15 this is for preachers but as we saw with David it's really for everybody you can apply this to yourself as well because if you and I meditate on God's word all day we'll be blessed all day we'll have success in our lives spiritual success Paul tells uh Timothy the young Pastor meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them what reading preaching exhortation studying that thy profiting may appear to all we've all seen brother Brian's profiting have we not I hope sometime in your life you'll think well brother Jesse's growing in Grace yeah I could tell he studied and prayed or I can God really moved God really help me that's been my prayer that's what your prayer should be for your life too that people as you meditate on God people can see they just love the Lord so much it's it's so refreshing to be around brother so and so sister so and so so it's just great to be around them because they're meditating on the things of God and everybody can see they're growing like a real Christian should grow praise God Psalm 119 oh I'm sorry yeah let's go back to Psalm 119 I'm almost done yeah I'm not going to be able to get everything I have definitely have a part seven I have a whole another topic on the burning um Psalm 11959 now brother R preached numerous sermons on this I might even preach a little series on this as I I thought on my ways David said I thought of my ways and turn my feet unto thy testimony so again when you meditate and the spirit of God comes on you it'll give you the right direction to go see as I thought on as I'm pondered and meditated on my ways oh I've got to go this way my feet need to walk a different direction I've been walking the wrong way so now it's time to walk a different way how does that happen through meditation now sometimes God can give us a word from somebody but it's got to be real to you it's got to be real to me and it's real to us when we meditate on it and we realize okay this is what's happened now here's what needs to happen does everybody see that action comes after meditation so medit in meditation we have the spirit of judgment the spirit of burning and then action Hallelujah just like the a just like the the seraphim right they were in action right reverent uh the other one humble yes humble reverent in action so we see the same thing here action comes after we meditate the spirit of God Burns in our hearts gives us a a desire Holiness command to do the commands of God then we can step in a New Direction now look vers 60 I made haste and I delayed not to keep the commands and I gave that example when we were down there in Kentucky Malachi made it might have saw it one one young brother in particular came up confessed pornography but then he also confessed he said over the last few years I've stolen thousands of dollars from my dad I said you go tell him right now after this sermon and he did he did and the next day I preached on Dancing he was the only one with me dancing well I guess the pastor danc for a little bit but see he had a joy now all the guilt all the shame was gone and the church said amen Church you don't have to carry the burdens you don't have to carry your burdens from the past you just confess them you'll feel brand new you'll feel the spirit of burning right but first recognize the spirit of judgment I stole from my dad or I stole and then confess it make haste do do the repentance quickly and then you'll your feet will walk in A New Path that brother danced all over the church and it's on YouTube too you can watch it if you want you can see how I was dancing too Hallelujah see that's what the spirit of God does it'll make you act upon the word right now amen I want to keep the word now I don't want to put it off I want to do it now praise God because God's spirit is burning in my heart and life and I know what God's called me to do may God help us to know what to do last verse I read this uh this morning I finished Isaiah this morning Isa isia 661 what a book oh my goodness this is just a tremendous book so many promises Hallelujah there are Untold promises in Isaiah it's hard to explain Isaiah 66 the last chapter thus sayith the Lord verse one the heath the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest remember that uh God told that to Solomon and Steven also quoted that about Solomon really really where can God rest and you know where he can rest in your soul the god of Heaven who owns Heaven and Earth where does he want to rest he wants to rest in your soul that's where he wants to rest and that's what the Holy Ghost did on the day of Pentecost didn't the Bible say the fire did what what did it do it rested on each of them and I'll say this if you've got God's fire to rest then you ought to rest rest in the promises of God verse two for all those things hath mine hand made look at all these things God has made all the wood here all the fibers the metal God God's hand has made all these things have been sayeth the Lord but to this man will I look who's God looking to if God if God's foot stol is the earth God's Got His Feet God's got his feet all propped up there with the foot stol where's he looking at he's looking at these type of people even to this man that's poor and a contrite spirit sound like David in Psalm 93 I'm nothing I'm frail I'm weak who's God looking at the person who humbled himself and those who tremble at the word or they love the word so much they'll go obey it right now they don't put it off well I'll do it later when I this happens or that happens I'm going to obey God's word now let's stand to our feet musicians can come that song uh oh yes I love you my Lord with all of my heart you are my everything you're the reason I sing I I love you
