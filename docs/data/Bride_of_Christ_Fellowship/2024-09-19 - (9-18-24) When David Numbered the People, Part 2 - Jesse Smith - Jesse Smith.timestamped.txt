[16:17] amen amen praise God we're just do a a
[16:20] little sermon here we're going to do a
[16:21] followup to part one we preached on
[16:23] there Sunday uh when David numbered the
[16:26] people we'll preach a part two here so
[16:28] we'll start start in 1
[16:31] Chronicles 21 by the grace of
[16:46] God we'll start at verse uh
[16:49] 18 you know Sunday by God's grace we
[16:52] preach on part one uh that was a
[16:53] blessing to my heart I trust it was to
[16:55] other people as well um I spent most of
[16:58] my time in 2 Samuel 24 so I'd like to
[17:01] look at this parallel passage a little
[17:02] bit here tonight um in 1
[17:05] Chronicles
[17:08] 21 we'll start at Verse
[17:12] 18 so we'll just get right into the
[17:14] study here by God's grace we're not
[17:15] going to stand because then we have to
[17:16] adjust the uh uh the laptop here we're
[17:20] just live streaming off a laptop um but
[17:23] we give honor to the Lord of course
[17:24] through our prayers and our worship we
[17:25] give all honor to the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:29] I guess we'll just start at Verse 18
[17:30] here by God's grace uh then the angel of
[17:33] the Lord commanded Gad to say to David
[17:35] that David should go up and set up an
[17:37] altar unto the Lord in the threshing
[17:39] floor of ornan the jebusite and David
[17:42] went up at the saying of GAD which he
[17:45] spake in the name of the Lord so here he
[17:46] had thus sayith the Lord he had the name
[17:48] of the Lord from the prophet of God so
[17:49] let's have one more word of prayer we
[17:50] ask God to bless the the word of God
[17:53] father God bless this reading of Thy
[17:54] word thank you for the truth of the
[17:55] scripture Lord It's life-changing Lord
[17:57] It's prophetic
[17:59] Hallelujah Lord it's uh what we have
[18:01] need of It's Our Daily Bread Lord God
[18:03] we're thankful for that we need the
[18:04] daily bread today Lord as we want to eat
[18:07] the book lord we want to swallow this
[18:09] word up this Revelation Lord God that
[18:11] one day life might swallow us up Lord
[18:14] God in Victory so we're speaking of
[18:17] course of the Rapture Lord God as we've
[18:18] been looking at and so father uh bless
[18:20] this word here tonight in Jesus Christ's
[18:22] name
[18:24] amen amen so we looking at a few uh
[18:28] thoughts here out of this uh chapter 1
[18:31] Corinthians I'm sorry 1 Chronicles 21
[18:33] pardon me so verse 18- 19 uh we see the
[18:37] angel commanding the
[18:38] prophet and of course this reminds me of
[18:41] how prophets numerous times had specific
[18:43] angels to them you know we know uh Moses
[18:46] had an angel given unto him I believe it
[18:49] was in Exodus 22 and uh the Lord told
[18:54] Moses to honor this Angel respect this
[18:57] Angel and and the angel had a great
[19:00] activity in the ministry of Moses then
[19:02] we saw it in the book of Acts where St
[19:04] Paul had an angel uh that was the Bible
[19:08] said that he belonged to so that was his
[19:10] we'd say his guardian angel or the angel
[19:12] given to him for his life and his
[19:14] ministry that was the angel that met him
[19:17] uh in the bottom of the boat and told
[19:18] him that no men would lose their lives
[19:20] and that came to pass so the angel gave
[19:22] him a pro a prophetic word and that was
[19:25] thus sayith the Lord and it came to pass
[19:26] and of course brother bradam had an
[19:27] angel that with him or was with him by
[19:29] God's grace from 46 to the end of his uh
[19:32] life end of his life there by God's
[19:34] grace through 65 and so we see here that
[19:37] that just reminded me you know the angel
[19:39] Lord met with Gad the prophet Gad was
[19:41] the the major prophet of that day of
[19:42] course we know David was a minor Prophet
[19:45] um that's quite a thought because so
[19:47] many of his Psalms were prophetic he had
[19:48] many many prophetic Psalms course Psalm
[19:51] 22 of the of the crucifixion and uh you
[19:54] know numerous other uh prophecies there
[19:57] psalm 16 with the resurrection uh God
[20:00] would not leave uh his soul in Hell
[20:03] Hallelujah so the Lord Jesus Christ he
[20:05] would not suffer the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:07] to see corruption so so although he's a
[20:09] minor Prophet had some really major
[20:11] prophecies we might say uh by God's
[20:14] grace so we see this Angel here
[20:16] commanding the prophet of
[20:18] God and then he's told David is told
[20:21] with thus say the Lord to sacrifice on
[20:22] Mount
[20:23] Mariah um and we saw how that was a uh
[20:27] Mariah was a very special place and
[20:29] still is um we saw the history you know
[20:34] we we want to just briefly review that
[20:37] uh how it started there in Genesis 14
[20:39] with Abraham uh that's where uh the
[20:42] southern part of Jerusalem was where uh
[20:44] mzc God in flesh met Abraham of course
[20:47] we're Abraham's seed by faith in Jesus
[20:50] Christ Hallelujah and then Joshua
[20:53] couldn't conquer Mount Mariah uh but
[20:55] then David was able able to conquer it
[20:58] of course and he danced uh before the
[21:00] Lord as the ark came into the the city
[21:02] of David it was called uh by the grace
[21:05] of God joab got the victory um and
[21:07] became of course a leader there through
[21:10] that victory was given great uh rewards
[21:12] for his battle there uh then of course
[21:15] we know Solomon built the temple right
[21:16] there on Mount Mariah so this very uh
[21:19] this very threshing floor that David
[21:21] purchased became the location of uh
[21:25] Solomon's Temple and then of course
[21:27] herod's Temple right now it's the Dome
[21:29] of the Rock but uh the Dome of the Rock
[21:31] is there on the Temple Mount but we know
[21:33] Israel will get it back somehow by the
[21:35] grace of God the scripture tells us that
[21:37] they'll build uh the Temple of the Lord
[21:39] so they'll have that Temple back uh
[21:41] sometime in the future by the grace of
[21:44] God of course we know this uh is a
[21:47] special location we know the millennial
[21:49] Temple will be built built there and
[21:51] then of course the future home when it
[21:53] comes down from God out of Heaven it'll
[21:55] be called the New Jerusalem so of course
[21:57] Jerusalem is the city of Peace as uh mzc
[22:01] is called the king of Peace So it's
[22:04] God's City it's the city of the great
[22:06] king Hallelujah so it's a beautiful city
[22:09] and we're thankful you know for the the
[22:11] scriptures that we saw and we saw I just
[22:14] going to briefly review again here um
[22:16] how um we saw how God's anger was
[22:20] kindled against Israel and so God
[22:22] allowed David's uh desire to number the
[22:25] people to line up with uh God chasing
[22:28] hening the people and uh God works
[22:32] everything out for his glory we looked
[22:34] at how we're not to Kindle the anger of
[22:36] the Lord keep our lives free from Idols
[22:38] that's why I believe Paul said that and
[22:39] also St John said little children keep
[22:41] yourselves from
[22:43] idols and then uh Satan provoked or
[22:46] lured or enticed
[22:49] David David had the people numbered or
[22:52] his mighty or his men numbered his vant
[22:53] men numbered
[22:56] um and then uh it was course sworn by
[22:59] joab uh but then once David did this his
[23:02] heart smoted him and uh God gave him a
[23:05] choice of his punishment he chose the
[23:07] three days of
[23:09] pestilence
[23:10] um and David knew it's better to fall in
[23:13] the hands of a merciful god than sinful
[23:17] men uh the plague was uh carried out by
[23:22] the angel of the Lord he had the sword
[23:23] of the Lord and he started that Dan
[23:25] swoop down to beerseba then he came back
[23:27] up to Jerusalem
[23:29] and
[23:30] uh you know it was going to take a blood
[23:33] sacrifice in order to stay the plague
[23:35] the Bible said and that's when the the
[23:38] angel directed The the prophet to tell
[23:40] David to buy the threshing floor which
[23:43] later become the Temple Mount later
[23:45] becomes um you know Solomon's Temple the
[23:47] location of Solomon's Temple he buys it
[23:49] from ornan the
[23:52] jebusite and then it said the Bible said
[23:54] God was moved with compassion and God
[23:56] told the angel it's enough so uh the
[23:58] pestilence stopped right there at the
[24:01] Temple Mount right there at where the
[24:03] future Temple would
[24:05] be and so that's kind of where we're
[24:07] picking up here I just want to pull out
[24:08] a few more thoughts there uh by God's
[24:11] grace then we saw how there was at least
[24:14] 10 foreshadowings there's probably many
[24:15] many more uh but there's 10
[24:17] foreshadowings of the cross in the Old
[24:19] Testament it's a blessing to see that uh
[24:21] by the grace of
[24:23] God so uh I think we'll pick up right
[24:26] there in 1 Corinthians I'm sorry 1
[24:27] Chronicles 21 18 and
[24:32] 19 uh David went up to sacrifice uh in
[24:35] the name of the Lord now verse 20 says
[24:38] ornan turned back and saw the angel and
[24:41] His Four Sons with him hid themselves
[24:43] now ornan was threshing wheat so uh very
[24:47] interesting he's threshing wheat here
[24:48] and he sees the angel of the Lord and he
[24:50] and his sons hide themselves you know we
[24:53] get this idea of uh there's over 300
[24:56] sometimes the Bible says fear not or
[24:59] don't fear you know God is constantly
[25:02] telling the people not to fear so the
[25:04] spirit of fear is something we battle
[25:06] often and of course when the Angels were
[25:08] present or the presence of Jesus would
[25:10] appear to individuals in the Bible uh he
[25:12] would say fear not even after the
[25:14] resurrection of course the Lord would
[25:16] say fear not um so we get the same idea
[25:20] uh that the Lord is to be feared and
[25:22] when God uh manifests his glory his
[25:25] presence uh it's a fearful thing so
[25:28] ornan and his sons hide themselves they
[25:31] run from the presence of the Lord Of
[25:32] course that reminds us of Adam running
[25:34] from the presence of the Lord the
[25:35] presence of the Lord is a very sacred
[25:37] holy serious thing and Oran and his sons
[25:42] experience that they hide themselves uh
[25:44] we see that
[25:46] there and of course this is like when
[25:48] brother Bram you know first met the
[25:50] angel Lord uh he felt like very afraid
[25:54] uh in the presence of God and he said
[25:56] you he never got used to that and you
[25:58] you and I none of us would ever get used
[26:01] to that Holy sacred presence it's a
[26:04] presence that we can't get used to and
[26:05] thank God for that uh we don't want that
[26:07] to become common we don't want our love
[26:09] for God to become common uh we want to
[26:12] always respect the presence of the Lord
[26:14] hallelujah and so brother Ram says it
[26:16] makes us humble when we come into His
[26:18] presence so we see this same thing
[26:20] happening to Oran and His Four Sons they
[26:24] get humble in the presence of the Lord
[26:26] now verse 21
[26:30] uh and as David came to ornan ornan
[26:32] looked and saw David and went out of the
[26:34] threshing for and bowed himself to David
[26:37] with his face to the ground uh so this
[26:39] is not an act of worship this is an act
[26:41] of total humility oran's not trying to
[26:43] worship God I'm sorry or's not trying to
[26:46] worship David he's just in a real fear
[26:50] of the Lord a real reverential fear and
[26:53] he throws himself down at David's feet
[26:56] um because he's a servant of the
[26:59] Lord so we see ornan humbling himself in
[27:03] the presence of
[27:05] David and so this is kind of like a
[27:07] little correction I have for myself on
[27:09] um on Sunday you know next ornan offers
[27:14] David with all these sacrifices and uh
[27:18] on Sunday I think I said it wrong but
[27:19] here clearly we can see that ornan
[27:23] offers all these sacrifices because of
[27:26] his great respect for the angel of the
[27:27] Lord Lord right he saw the angel with a
[27:30] sword drawn and due to his fear and due
[27:32] to his respect for God he offers all
[27:35] these sacrifices that he already has
[27:36] right there ready to go so this was an
[27:40] act of reverence from ornan this was an
[27:42] act of his respect for the angel of the
[27:45] Lord uh to want to give David these
[27:47] animals to sacrifice so I want to make
[27:50] sure I corrected that uh by God's
[27:52] grace it was ornan being humble humbly
[27:56] offering David the opportunity to
[27:58] provide the
[27:59] sacrifices uh to the Lord due to the
[28:02] fear of the Lord and his respect for the
[28:04] angel of the Lord in verse 22 then David
[28:06] said to ornan grant me the place of this
[28:08] threshing floor that I may build an
[28:10] altar therein unto the Lord Thou shalt
[28:12] Grant it me for the full price that the
[28:16] plague may be stayed from the
[28:19] people and so David wants to pay the
[28:21] full price David doesn't want to
[28:23] discount on his
[28:25] sacrifice uh and Friends there's no
[28:27] shortcut cuts to Holiness right there's
[28:29] no shortcuts to the baptism of the Holy
[28:32] Ghost there's no shortcuts to getting
[28:34] your first love back brother Ram says
[28:36] how are you repented at the first time
[28:38] when you got your first love he said
[28:39] that's the same repentance we have to do
[28:42] to get our first love back and that's
[28:44] why it was so wonderful when brother
[28:45] Paul Griffin was here to see Souls
[28:48] tearing at the altar laying at the altar
[28:50] I was up there at the altar praying on a
[28:52] couple occasions came down there went
[28:54] left come back and spent time praying
[28:56] there um so we see there's no shortcuts
[28:59] it takes a Full
[29:00] Sacrifice um fully giving yourself over
[29:04] to the ways of God right fully returning
[29:07] uh to the Lord if we want our first love
[29:10] back and there'll be no Shortcuts To The
[29:12] Rapture right a each and every wise
[29:14] virgin had to have the extra oil each
[29:17] and every person in the parable of
[29:18] Matthew uh 22 of the parable of of the
[29:22] King's son the marriage for the King's
[29:24] son everyone had to have a white garment
[29:27] the man that did
[29:28] who came through the window or came some
[29:30] other way he tried to have a shortcut he
[29:32] tried to have a a partial sacrifice
[29:35] right a partial dedication but we're
[29:37] shown by David here and of course other
[29:39] scriptures that you must have a uh you
[29:40] must pay the full price right you must
[29:42] fully die out seek God daily Hallelujah
[29:45] die die out to yourself Die daily the
[29:47] scripture plainly tells us by the grace
[29:50] of God this is because Jesus Paid the
[29:53] full price for our sins uh he laid aside
[29:56] his
[29:57] splendor he was beaten un so un Merc
[30:00] mercifully uh that he said he didn't
[30:02] even look like a man the Bible say he
[30:03] didn't look like a man he looked more
[30:04] like a
[30:05] worm and so only a full sacrifice in
[30:09] David's case could stop the plague of
[30:12] course that's what Jesus's death was it
[30:15] was a Full Sacrifice to pay the full
[30:17] punishment for sin that's the only
[30:19] sacrifice that could stay uh the plague
[30:22] of sin upon Humanity where now in the
[30:25] New Testament now we can be New
[30:26] Creations in Christ Jesus
[30:28] uh under the Old Testament the blood of
[30:30] bulls and goats could never fully do
[30:32] away with sin so Jesus had to pay the
[30:34] full price uh he had to become a curse
[30:37] he had to become sin that we might be
[30:39] blessed and that we might be made
[30:41] Jesus's righteousness Hallelujah all
[30:43] through the sacrifice the full payment
[30:46] of sin uh placed upon God's sacrifice
[30:49] the Lamb of God the great Redeemer Jesus
[30:52] Christ and so only a Full Sacrifice
[30:55] could stay the plague from the city in
[30:57] David's time only a Full Sacrifice of
[30:59] Jesus Christ could take away all our
[31:02] sins and uh save us from a certain death
[31:06] right a certain judgment Jesus took our
[31:09] judgment so we can be pardoned by the
[31:12] grace of God hallelujah verse 23 and
[31:16] ornan said unto David take it to thee
[31:18] and let my Lord the king do that which
[31:20] is good in his eyes lo I give Thee the
[31:23] ax and also for burnt offerings and the
[31:25] threshing instruments for wood and and
[31:28] wheat for the meat offering I give it
[31:31] all verse 24 and the King said unto
[31:34] ornan nay but I will verely buy it for
[31:36] full
[31:38] price for I will not take that which is
[31:41] thine for the Lord nor offer burnt off
[31:45] offerings without
[31:48] cost so we as we said on uh Sunday David
[31:51] learned not to take anything from
[31:53] another man he took uriah's wife basba
[31:58] paid heavily for that lost four sons and
[32:01] uh so much more public shame because he
[32:02] did a private sin he had all this public
[32:06] shame and so David learned from that I
[32:08] don't take anything from another man uh
[32:11] My Sacrifice must be given from my heart
[32:14] from myself in this case from my purse
[32:18] right he had to pay uh the 600 600
[32:21] shekels of
[32:24] gold and so uh David learns David again
[32:28] has to tell him no I'm giving a Full
[32:30] Sacrifice I must pay the the cost for
[32:33] this sacrifice and church that that's
[32:36] what what it must be with us we must
[32:38] learn how to sacrifice we must learn how
[32:39] to sacrifice our time our finances our
[32:43] resources whatever we can sacrifice for
[32:45] other people we must learn to do that we
[32:48] can't let everybody else do all the
[32:50] sacrifice and we've got to step up we've
[32:52] got to give God a pleasing sacrifice
[32:54] when the time calls for sometimes the
[32:56] visit to the uh the hospital sometimes
[32:59] it's a visit to someone's house uh
[33:01] sometimes it's a financial thing
[33:03] sometimes it's consecrating uh shutting
[33:06] in with God you know before brother Des
[33:08] McBride came we had 30 minutes of prayer
[33:10] each each know of those days extra
[33:12] prayer uh sometimes uh God calls us to a
[33:16] total
[33:17] sacrifice uh so we must be open to that
[33:19] we must realize that if we want uh if we
[33:22] want to please God then we must give a
[33:24] total sacrifice David knew that uh in
[33:27] this case David knew he had to do that
[33:29] so God honored that by God's
[33:32] grace all right so verse 25 and 26 and
[33:35] so David gave to
[33:38] ornan for the place 600 shekels of gold
[33:43] by weight I just briefly tried to look
[33:46] this up and it seems like 600 shekels of
[33:49] gold in today's currency would be around
[33:52] $300,000 but that's not taking in uh you
[33:55] know the U the massive inflation so a
[34:00] pretty hefty cost and David didn't take
[34:03] out a loan for this he had this money uh
[34:05] ready to go ready to pay um so this was
[34:08] a very high cost he had to pay uh for
[34:11] this this land this Mount that would
[34:14] become of course uh the Temple Mount by
[34:17] God's grace so David paid it and then
[34:19] after he buys it verse 26 David built
[34:22] there an altar unto the
[34:25] Lord and offered burnt offerings and
[34:28] peace offerings and called upon the
[34:31] Lord I will just pause right there uh by
[34:34] God's grace two kinds of sacrifices
[34:37] David gives here uh burnt and peace
[34:40] offerings and just as a reminder of the
[34:42] five types of sacrifices in the Old
[34:44] Testament four of them were bloody one
[34:47] of them was not bloody uh the the
[34:50] sacrifice that was not bloody was the
[34:52] meal or meat offering and it also had a
[34:54] drink
[34:55] offering this was a sacrifice given
[34:58] for Thanksgiving for
[35:00] Provisions but the peace offering the
[35:02] sin offering the trespass offering and
[35:05] the burnt offering uh were offered with
[35:08] blood
[35:09] sacrifices just review those real
[35:11] briefly the burnt offering represented
[35:13] complete submission to God a
[35:15] rededication a total rededication to God
[35:19] uh that's what David did here so David
[35:22] was commanded by God he needed to give a
[35:24] burnt offering a total rededication back
[35:27] to God right he had failed he got
[35:29] tempted with pride no doubt to number
[35:31] the people and so he needed to
[35:34] rededicate his life to God not trust in
[35:37] man not trust in numbers but trust in
[35:39] the Living God as we're told not to
[35:42] trust in uncertain riches not to trust
[35:44] in Kings and leaders were're to pray for
[35:46] them but not trust in them or to trust
[35:47] in the Living
[35:49] God then David was told to give a peace
[35:52] offering which would be a a blood
[35:54] sacrifice as well and this was a
[35:56] sacrifice uh to give thanks for anything
[35:59] so it was a thanks Thanksgiving offering
[36:02] so this would be a gratitude offering
[36:05] here that the plague had been stopped a
[36:07] blood sacrifice uh in Thanksgiving that
[36:10] the plague had been stopped so those
[36:12] were the two um that David was commanded
[36:15] to offer and he offered
[36:17] it so uh there was two other kinds the
[36:20] sin offering was atonement for
[36:21] unintentional sins so notice this one
[36:24] wasn't um this one wasn't offered
[36:26] because uh it was more intentional right
[36:29] this wasn't an unintentional thing
[36:31] Israel you know needing to be chasen uh
[36:34] and and having 70,000 men killed uh that
[36:38] wasn't for unintentional it was for
[36:40] intentional then you have the trespass
[36:43] offering um this was atonement for
[36:45] intentional sins uh but the the level of
[36:49] sin that Israel must have been guilty of
[36:51] was such a high level that God called
[36:53] for the highest sacrifice the most
[36:55] sacred sacrifice uh which would have
[36:57] been the burn offering so God called for
[36:59] the burnt
[37:02] offering all right and so this
[37:05] represented total surrender to God the
[37:06] burnt offering God wanted his people
[37:08] totally surrendered separated from their
[37:13] idolatry and then uh finishing there
[37:15] verse 26 then God vindicates God accepts
[37:18] that offering so we can see how God
[37:20] accepted David's sacrifice but thank God
[37:24] God accepted the sacrifice of Jesus
[37:25] Christ because of course this is a
[37:27] forche shadowing David buying this
[37:29] purchasing this
[37:30] land as a type of God purchasing the
[37:34] whole world through the blood sacrifice
[37:36] of Jesus Christ and then God uh
[37:39] Vindicated Jesus's sacrifice right the
[37:42] sun wouldn't Shine for three hours uh
[37:44] the earthquake all the things that
[37:46] happened and then of course the
[37:47] resurrection um the Roman cenan saying
[37:50] truly this man was a Son of God God
[37:52] Vindicated it then of course he
[37:54] Vindicated with fire you know 50 days
[37:56] later on the day of panic praise God he
[37:59] Vindicated with the resurrection uh
[38:01] where the over 500 people saw Jesus at
[38:04] one time so of course God Vindicated
[38:06] Jesus's resurrection his death and
[38:09] Resurrection many many
[38:12] ways Allelujah so that was finishing
[38:14] verse 26 and then of course there's
[38:16] numerous other times God Vindicated
[38:18] sacrifices with literal fire uh it seems
[38:21] like from Hebrews 11 that God Vindicated
[38:24] Abel's sacrifice with fire and then of
[38:27] course turn down Cain's bloodless
[38:29] sacrifice because something has to die
[38:33] uh in order for God to vindicate a
[38:36] sacrifice uh there was at least three
[38:38] others so there's at least four uh
[38:40] sacrifices Vindicated by fire Gideon's
[38:43] sacrifice in judges 621 Gideon of course
[38:46] prepared the sacrifice on a
[38:48] rock instructed by the angel so again an
[38:51] instruction from an angel kind of like
[38:53] uh the angel instructed Gad to tell
[38:56] David the angel touched the offering
[38:58] with the tip of his staff and SP fire
[39:00] sprang up from the Rock and consumed the
[39:02] meat and the unleavened bread this was a
[39:06] sacrifice God Vindicated to prove to
[39:08] Gideon that he was to deliver them from
[39:10] the midnites but then remember he needed
[39:12] numerous other signs in order to give
[39:14] him the peace and the confidence to obey
[39:18] God so this shows us whatever we have
[39:19] need of God will give it to us in order
[39:22] to accomplish God's purpose in our life
[39:24] many of us I would say myself many of us
[39:27] some sometimes if God's calling us to do
[39:29] something great we need signs from God
[39:31] we need vindications from God if God's
[39:32] calling us to do something God works
[39:35] with Humanity uh God works with us
[39:37] whatever we have need of God will grant
[39:39] it to us just like Thomas needed to see
[39:41] the resurrected Christ uh whatever we
[39:43] have need of God will provide it for us
[39:45] so we can have faith and confidence uh
[39:48] that God's going to be with us and help
[39:49] us accomplish God's purpose in our
[39:52] life the next time was Elijah on Mount
[39:55] Carmel we'll get to this one here again
[39:56] in a little bit but um during his
[39:58] confrontation with the prophets of Baal
[39:59] Elijah prayed to God fire fell from
[40:02] heaven consuming his burnt offering the
[40:04] wood the stones even the water in the
[40:06] trench round about the altar remember
[40:08] Altar and remember Elijah did this by
[40:11] command so Elijah saw a vision in order
[40:14] to accomplish this that's why Elijah
[40:16] could mock the Bale prophets because he
[40:18] had already seen by Vision what God was
[40:20] going to do he already had thus sayith
[40:22] the Lord and then God consumed that
[40:25] remember that was to prove to Israel uh
[40:29] you can't go between two opinions either
[40:31] serve Baal or serve God and uh you know
[40:34] Elijah of course was standing there as
[40:37] God's Prophet at The Showdown and prove
[40:40] that God was with Elijah thank God God
[40:43] is with our Elijah God is with our
[40:44] Elijah uh the late Prophet brother
[40:46] William brandham Vindicated by the word
[40:48] of God by signs Miracles and wonders so
[40:51] we're thankful for that by the grace of
[40:53] God and then the the next one I'm
[40:55] talking about is uh the dedication of
[40:57] Solomon's Temple 2 Chronicles 7:1 at the
[41:00] dedication of the temple in Jerusalem
[41:01] fire came down from heaven and consumed
[41:03] the burnt offering and the sacrifices on
[41:05] the altar so much so that uh the priest
[41:08] couldn't even Minister that of course
[41:09] reminds us of when Moses dedicated the
[41:11] temple and then when Solomon D dedicated
[41:13] the temple God was so pleased with the
[41:16] sacrifice God was so pleased with the
[41:17] dwelling place he sent fire down to
[41:20] vindicate his
[41:21] sacrifice um you know we look for that
[41:23] as preachers you know I look for that uh
[41:25] in my life uh I want to see God bless uh
[41:29] you know uh my travels God God bless my
[41:31] Ministry there in akan God wherever God
[41:33] calls me you I always look for God to
[41:35] give a Vindication sometimes it's really
[41:38] wonderful pretty amazing other times
[41:40] it's just simple humble but we always
[41:42] look for God's Vindication Upon Our
[41:44] sacrifice so we appreciate that and we
[41:47] we thank we're thankful that God
[41:49] vindicates um uh what he's behind you
[41:53] know uh just as examples I went down to
[41:55] Kentucky this summer and Iowa and God
[41:57] truly
[41:58] Vindicated um that he had wanted me to
[42:00] go Minister there so I thank God for
[42:02] that of course we think of the Napoleon
[42:05] meetings there in April of
[42:07] 2023 uh how God
[42:09] vindicates uh times and seasons in our
[42:12] lives and to us that's our equivalent of
[42:14] fire falling from heaven where God God's
[42:17] spirit drops down and does wonderful
[42:19] Supernatural signs Miracles wonders the
[42:22] nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and we can
[42:24] all say praise the lord we were there I
[42:26] was there when the Spirit came
[42:27] Hallelujah so we're thankful for those
[42:29] moments that God has ordained in our
[42:33] life
[42:36] Hallelujah now just uh I did want to say
[42:39] something here getting back to the sin
[42:40] offering I just thought I might read
[42:42] this you know as I was uh as I Was
[42:45] preparing this sermon I had seen this
[42:47] note that I had about the sin offering
[42:51] um and it's been a while since I read
[42:53] this but uh if you uh want to listen to
[42:56] it's a very short
[42:57] there's a there's a sermon there's an
[42:59] audio recording called a private inter
[43:01] interview with sister Bruce and this
[43:03] interview sister Bruce Bruce has a heart
[43:06] condition she needs healing but she's
[43:07] also struggling with whether she's born
[43:09] again or not and so brother brandham uh
[43:11] counsels her it's a very short I think
[43:13] it's might even be just 10 minutes maybe
[43:15] less uh and while they're talking you
[43:17] can hear the congregation doing their
[43:19] song so brother BR sometimes would have
[43:21] private interviews right before he came
[43:22] out to preach and this is one of those
[43:24] times but as I was going through those
[43:26] offerings you know the burnt offering
[43:27] and the peace offering I was reminded
[43:29] this quote um and this is what brother
[43:32] Ram said about uh sister
[43:37] Bruce
[43:39] um I'll just read in paragraph five and
[43:41] six but before that uh brother Ram tells
[43:44] you know Sister Bruce Bruce kept saying
[43:46] I'm not worthy I'm not worthy I'm not
[43:48] worthy of God's healing I'm not I fail
[43:50] so much and brother Braham said think
[43:52] about me you know sis sister Bruce was
[43:55] just concerned about herself I'm not
[43:56] worthy about brother said think about me
[43:58] I'm not worthy he said alls I have to do
[44:01] is remember that Jesus uh called me to
[44:05] do this so I'm not trusting in my merits
[44:07] or my righteousness I'm just I have to
[44:10] remember in my mind I'm just following
[44:11] God's command and then God will honor us
[44:14] as we obey his commands and we stand in
[44:17] Jesus's stead brother R said I'm in the
[44:19] stead of Jesus what would I do if Jesus
[44:22] or what would Jesus do if he was here
[44:23] Jesus would lay hands on the sick right
[44:25] they'd recover like he did to Peter's
[44:27] stepmother or when he would cast out
[44:30] demons so brother Ram said you know I'm
[44:32] just as unworthy as you are sister Bruce
[44:34] uh but I'm just following Jesus's
[44:36] commands to lay hands on the sick and
[44:38] they shall
[44:40] recover um brother Ram said I believe
[44:43] you to be a genuine Christian
[44:44] woman sister Bruce says I make so many
[44:47] mistakes and I fail so many times I'm
[44:50] sure we can all relate to that we make
[44:51] so many mistakes we fail so many times
[44:54] brother Ram said that's why Christ had
[44:57] had to die so that you with your
[44:58] mistakes wouldn't be lotted to you see
[45:03] he took your mistakes your desire in
[45:04] your heart is to serve him sister Bruce
[45:07] said yes the ram said all right that's
[45:09] what he died for so you could serve him
[45:11] see your mistakes are not looked not
[45:14] lotted to you see he is your propit so
[45:18] he's your mercy seat right uh so the
[45:22] blood had to be placed on The Mercy Seat
[45:25] the the blood had to be on The Mercy
[45:26] Seat so the Judgment of God could be
[45:29] stopped brother said that's what Jesus
[45:31] is he's your mercy seat the wrath of God
[45:34] stops at Jesus so we don't we don't have
[45:37] to deal with God's Wrath because Jesus
[45:39] Paid for God's Wrath see brother man
[45:41] said he is your sin offering your sins
[45:45] are not known you're not a sinner before
[45:47] God remember like job God said job's a
[45:51] perfect man that was under the blood of
[45:52] bulls and goats how much more the New
[45:54] Testament believer Christ took your sins
[45:56] and became you or became he became sin
[46:00] Jesus did not become a sinner but he
[46:01] became sin because Jesus never sinned
[46:03] brother R plainly says
[46:05] that he says because your desire is to
[46:08] serve him so I just want to bring that
[46:10] in here you know no matter what
[46:12] condition we find ourselves in whether
[46:13] we're struggling or whether we're
[46:14] Victorious or uh if we feel like we're
[46:17] failing so many times remember Jesus is
[46:20] your sin offering so when we come to God
[46:22] we have to remember Jesus is our burnt
[46:24] offering our sin offering our trespass
[46:25] offering our drink offering our meal
[46:27] offering uh our burnt offering he is
[46:30] every offering he is our sacrifice right
[46:33] and we just come and we present
[46:35] ourselves we present our bodies as a
[46:37] Living Sacrifice Jesus is the true
[46:39] sacrifice to save us take all our sins
[46:42] away but then we lay ourselves on the on
[46:44] the sacrifice of God's or on the altar
[46:46] of God's sacrifice as well make
[46:48] ourselves a Living Sacrifice die to
[46:50] ourselves repent trust in God hallelujah
[46:55] and then we become a new creature our
[46:56] Minds get
[46:58] transformed I had a good question today
[47:00] from one of the Saints about can Satan
[47:02] uh know our can Satan read our minds and
[47:05] of course no Satan can't read our minds
[47:07] only the word is a discerner of the
[47:09] thoughts and tense of the heart and I
[47:10] thought this was excellent very
[47:12] excellent question um from one of the
[47:15] Saints there great question U but what
[47:17] we know is that Satan observes us right
[47:19] he uh he has divices he has traps lures
[47:23] plans like we've been reading there in
[47:25] the scripture
[47:27] so Satan you know and the demons can
[47:28] observe us and they can see what kind of
[47:31] state our our mind is in right they can
[47:34] see if we're overcoming or praising God
[47:36] uh but he can't he can't read our minds
[47:38] or read he can try to inject things into
[47:40] our minds but he can't know our every
[47:43] thought like God can God knows our
[47:45] thoughts but Satan can clearly see if
[47:47] our if you know through our words and
[47:49] everything uh if we're under the
[47:51] anointing of the Holy Spirit or the
[47:54] Bible said in Ephesians 4 neither give
[47:56] place place to the devil well where
[47:57] would where would a Christian give place
[47:59] to the devil in their mind or in their
[48:01] spirit so Satan or the demons can know
[48:04] if our mind is under the influence of an
[48:07] evil spirit like an unconfessed complex
[48:10] was an example I gave to one of the
[48:11] Saints on the text or any unconfessed
[48:14] sin if we've given place to the devil
[48:15] anywhere in our spirit well they can
[48:17] observe that they can't read our minds
[48:19] and our thoughts but they can clearly
[48:20] see okay wow this person this person is
[48:23] a Christian but uh they given over their
[48:25] conscience or their reason or their
[48:27] affection their
[48:28] imagination um they've given that over
[48:31] and another evil spirit has that place
[48:35] occupied so excellent question and so
[48:38] that's why we got to constantly uh
[48:39] confess our sins brother M said remember
[48:41] I plead constantly with the Lord Lord
[48:43] don't take your anointing off me brother
[48:45] Ram said I gotta I got to repent every
[48:46] hour he says why' he say that uh because
[48:49] the enemy right can see if we're giving
[48:52] into evil spirits or not or fighting the
[48:54] good fight of Faith or not he can see us
[48:56] through our up and downs and like that
[48:59] uh like like the saint asked there on on
[49:01] the text um you know it seems like when
[49:03] the enemy sees like we're we're down yes
[49:05] he'll try to influence other people uh
[49:08] to go to us and to to try to get us to
[49:11] fall deeper or get us to struggle more
[49:13] it seem like you know when it rains it
[49:14] pours you know uh when the enemy sees
[49:17] we're struggling then he'll s all these
[49:18] other things that try to discourage us
[49:20] so we have to cast down every
[49:22] imagination that exalts itself against
[49:24] the word of God and overcome
[49:27] the gates of hell and so the revelation
[49:29] of the holy spirit will overcome the
[49:31] gates of hell so excellent question I
[49:32] just thought I would share that there
[49:36] um no Satan cannot read our thoughts and
[49:39] our minds only the word can but the
[49:42] enemy can of course see if we've given
[49:45] over a place in our minds um to evil
[49:48] spirits or evil thoughts so great great
[49:52] question there by God's
[49:55] grace okay now verse 27 here 1
[49:58] Chronicles
[50:00] 21:27 so we're just thankful God answers
[50:03] right you know sometimes we pray and we
[50:05] wonder when is God going to answer other
[50:06] times we pray and God answers right away
[50:07] here in David's case God answered by
[50:09] fire he called upon the name of the Lord
[50:12] and God answered by
[50:16] fire verse 27 and the Lord commanded the
[50:19] angel and he put up his sword again into
[50:21] the sheath thereof so we get this
[50:23] picture of uh you know angels with
[50:26] swords and then putting the the sword
[50:28] away um this is a real picture right so
[50:32] we know there's angels that have six
[50:33] wings right there's angels with swords
[50:36] not all angels have swords but this is
[50:38] an angel with a sword and so God tells
[50:41] him it's enough put your sword away and
[50:44] the angel does that so the sword was not
[50:47] put away until uh the sacrifice was
[50:49] Vindicated from heaven so we get this
[50:52] idea you know sometimes troubles in our
[50:54] lives or tests in our lives are not
[50:56] going to stop until we really call on
[50:58] God really make a sacrifice right really
[51:01] devote ourselves unto God uh do we
[51:04] really want to be delivered from a
[51:05] complex do we really want our first love
[51:06] back it takes a real sacrifice
[51:08] especially if we've been giving into sin
[51:10] and Catering to the things of the world
[51:12] sinning uh living in any iniquity living
[51:15] in any unconfessed sin we have to give a
[51:17] real sacrifice a genuine sacrifice like
[51:20] the Bible says give a burnt offering Die
[51:22] daily um return to God we've been
[51:24] preaching on I will heal your back back
[51:26] slidings if we really want God's
[51:28] Vindication we got to give a real
[51:31] genuine consecrated sacrifice and be
[51:34] devoted unto God again Hallelujah the
[51:36] fear of the Lord we must hate evil
[51:39] depart from Evil and seek God then we'll
[51:42] understand the fear of the Lord again
[51:43] for our lives Hallelujah I like how all
[51:46] these recent messages are tied together
[51:48] uh by the grace of the
[51:50] Lord judgment cannot pass until the
[51:53] blood is shed and then God has received
[51:56] the the sacrifice that's verse 27 verse
[51:58] 28 at that time when David saw that the
[52:02] Lord had answered him in the threshing
[52:03] floor of ornan the
[52:06] jebusite then he sacrificed there okay
[52:09] so then he does continues to do
[52:11] sacrifices that became a very sacred
[52:13] spot for David because he'd heard about
[52:15] the 70,000 people dying and but when
[52:18] when he made that sacrifice when he drew
[52:20] nigh to God God Drew nigh to him and
[52:23] that place became uh a very special
[52:25] place of course still is to this day and
[52:28] forever will be eternally will be a
[52:30] special place God loves that place Mount
[52:32] Mariah Mount Zion uh Jerusalem the city
[52:35] of the great king that's the king's City
[52:40] Hallelujah so here we see uh this kind
[52:42] of reminds us you know of uh when when
[52:45] David wrote
[52:48] uh uh the psalm Psalm 51 you know after
[52:51] he'd s with basheba take not your Holy
[52:53] Spirit from me here we see that God
[52:56] accepts David Again David knew I he
[52:59] David could say yes I know God has
[53:00] accepted me God has accepted my
[53:02] sacrifice I'm back in fellowship with
[53:04] God he's forgiven Israel he's forgiven
[53:07] me of my pride of numbering the
[53:09] people and so this of course would have
[53:11] brought Joy back to David's life the joy
[53:13] of Salvation the joy of Victory the joy
[53:16] of his first Love U the renewal of the
[53:19] holy spirit in David's life so we see
[53:21] that verse
[53:23] 28 verse 29 for the Tabernacle of the
[53:26] Lord which Moses made in the wilderness
[53:29] and the altar of the burnt offering were
[53:31] at that season in the high place at
[53:34] gibian okay so we get this we get the
[53:36] reminder that um the burnt offerings
[53:39] sacrifices were done at gibian which if
[53:41] I'm not mistaken was north northwest of
[53:44] Jerusalem if I'm not mistaken I could be
[53:45] wrong on that um remember that from when
[53:48] I preached on the Joshua series um but
[53:52] uh David knew the sacrifices were done
[53:54] GI but here he sacrifices on the
[53:56] threshing floor or Mariah and God
[53:59] receives it okay but but he but he also
[54:02] knew that the sacrifices were to be done
[54:03] at Gian there verse 30 but David could
[54:06] not go before it to inquire of God for
[54:10] he was afraid because of the sword of
[54:12] the Angel Lord so here we get an
[54:14] understanding that David uh David was
[54:18] afraid to go to sacrifice at gibian
[54:19] because God had heard him right there uh
[54:22] and the angel of the Lord had met him
[54:24] there the prophet had told him to stay
[54:26] there so he didn't want to go anywhere
[54:27] to sacrifice he wanted to stay right
[54:29] there and continue to sacrifice do all
[54:31] his sacrifices right down there on
[54:32] Mariah because he knew God had has
[54:34] accepted in there he didn't know if God
[54:36] would accept him over there at gibian so
[54:37] he was afraid he was afraid of course
[54:40] seeing more people die who wouldn't be
[54:42] 70,000 people died 70,000 men died David
[54:46] didn't want to leave that place of
[54:47] worship he didn't want to leave Mariah
[54:49] he wanted to stay right there because he
[54:50] knew God accepted him there you we see
[54:52] that in our lives you know we want to
[54:53] stay where God accepts us right we don't
[54:55] want to leave position we don't want to
[54:57] leave uh where God's called us the gifts
[55:00] of the holy spirit in our lives you know
[55:01] we want to like brother Ben preached to
[55:03] us stay in your position you know we
[55:05] want to stay right there where God's
[55:06] called us to be uh and God will bless us
[55:10] uh when we stay there so we see David
[55:11] doing that David was afraid to leave
[55:13] because he didn't want to see any more
[55:14] men die he knew God had accepted him at
[55:16] Mariah he's going to stay right there
[55:18] he's not going to go to gibian he's
[55:19] going to stay right there and
[55:22] sacrifice all
[55:24] right so uh I'm at like about 54 minutes
[55:28] I'll go a few more minutes here by God's
[55:30] grace I thought you know as we're
[55:32] looking at Here Mount Zion you know we
[55:34] could look at the
[55:36] uh uh the three mountains or three
[55:39] showdowns brother brandom calls them Oh
[55:41] but before that yes David is David gets
[55:43] the fear of the Lord back so see he has
[55:45] this fear of the Lord right's he's not
[55:48] thinking I can go sacrifice anywhere he
[55:50] has the fear of the Lord he has this
[55:52] respect for God I'm going to sacrifice
[55:55] right here so again that tied in with
[55:56] how we looking at the fear of the Lord
[55:58] the last few Sunday nights at the church
[56:01] so David ends this story ends with David
[56:03] getting the fear of the Lord
[56:05] back okay so I want to um go back to the
[56:09] Mount Zion Showdown I just want to
[56:12] review this Lord willing you know Lord
[56:13] willing um I told you I want to get to
[56:15] the First Corinthians I do want to get
[56:16] to that eventually by God's grace but
[56:17] I'm having these other thoughts um and
[56:20] then i' like to get to um God in
[56:23] Simplicity God hiding himself in
[56:24] Simplicity revealing him the same
[56:25] according to song we've been preaching
[56:27] on and then the last one would be spoken
[56:29] words Original Seed well I thought this
[56:31] would tie nicely together as we're
[56:32] looking at Zion uh we look at um the
[56:36] three showdowns brother R taught us in
[56:38] in the spoken words Original Seed to be
[56:40] a good review as we uh as we approach
[56:43] that Lord
[56:45] willing so this is paragraph uh 432
[56:48] spoken word Original Seed March
[56:52] 1862 brother man so it's at this time in
[56:55] this country that the person will appear
[56:56] for it's in the scripture and it's thus
[56:58] sayith the Lord so again anyone saying
[57:01] uh there there was a internet Prophet
[57:04] who actually lives in Ohio who who is
[57:05] saying he was um he was the Elijah to
[57:09] this day he it's just so so ridiculous
[57:12] um he's going against uh this quote
[57:15] right here because brother said it's
[57:17] it's it's it's happening at this time in
[57:19] this country brother bam also said that
[57:21] in anoint anointed ones of the end time
[57:23] 1965 he said uh the Elijah Prophet is in
[57:28] America right now brother Ram said so
[57:31] his ministry so this person uh brother
[57:34] Ram said was thus sayith the Lord in the
[57:36] country at that time then brother BR
[57:39] says in the latter Reign there will come
[57:40] forth a Mount Carmel a showdown Bible
[57:44] fulfilled to the letter John the Baptist
[57:46] his messenger before his face that's
[57:48] what John the Baptist was in Malachi 3
[57:51] he said John the Baptist planted a
[57:53] former rain and was rejected by the
[57:54] churches the denominations the Pharisees
[57:56] and Sadducees in his
[57:58] day Jesus came and had the mount
[58:00] Transfiguration
[58:03] Showdown okay so now he's talking about
[58:06] two showdowns Mount Carmel with Elijah
[58:09] Mount Carmel the Old Testament and then
[58:11] Mount Transfiguration Jesus at a
[58:13] showdown with the religious people of of
[58:16] that
[58:17] day but with this one with Mount
[58:19] Transfiguration there's a forerunner
[58:21] John the Baptist and then there was
[58:23] Christ so now brother Ram takes this
[58:25] Mount Transfiguration with the
[58:26] Forerunner Elijah brother John the
[58:29] Baptist brother John the Baptist and
[58:31] then Jesus now he brings it to our day
[58:33] he calls it a Mount Zion Showdown the
[58:35] Forerunner would be brother brandham and
[58:36] then the coming of the of Christ would
[58:39] be next okay so we see
[58:42] this this Forerunner of the last days
[58:45] will sew or plant for the r latter rain
[58:48] just like John the John the Baptist
[58:50] planted for Jesus brother Brand's
[58:53] Ministry planted for the rapture
[58:56] Jesus will be the showdown between
[58:58] denominations and Creeds which is his
[59:00] word when he comes a showdown the
[59:03] Rapture of his bride I'll just pause
[59:05] right there I forgot to say this last
[59:07] Wednesday and Sunday but I don't know if
[59:09] anybody saw it but the pope uh came out
[59:11] last week and said every religion leads
[59:14] to God so that's this false doctrine of
[59:19] universalism um so this could take
[59:22] people in all kinds of crazy
[59:23] conspiracies but um it seems like
[59:26] uh the Pope here is saying that every
[59:29] religion leads to God no doubt I've seen
[59:32] the video he did say that he did say
[59:33] that but I'm what I was talking was
[59:35] referring to to some people's
[59:36] conspiracies about um you know how the
[59:40] Muslim faith perhaps came out of
[59:41] Catholicism it was set up by the
[59:43] Catholic church I don't know I'm not a
[59:45] conspiracy theorist a crazy one at all
[59:48] but um but the Bible does say every
[59:52] death every murder is accounted to the
[59:54] Roman Catholic Church in Roman or I'm
[59:57] sorry in Revelation chapter 18 so there
[59:59] has to be some truth to
[1:00:02] this um but anyways that point was uh
[1:00:05] not now the point I want to make is that
[1:00:07] the Pope I don't know if the pope really
[1:00:09] means that or not because there's a
[1:00:12] Council of Trent I made a video about
[1:00:14] that recently as well where the Council
[1:00:15] of Trent says um no one can be saved
[1:00:18] outside the Catholic church and the
[1:00:20] Council of Trent condemned Martin
[1:00:22] Luther's justification by faith so
[1:00:24] either the Pope doesn't agree with the
[1:00:26] Council of Trent which that wouldn't
[1:00:27] make sense or the pope is lying trying
[1:00:30] to deceive all these people to follow
[1:00:32] him to get him into the one world
[1:00:33] religion and of course that's what I
[1:00:35] believe um I believe the pope is just
[1:00:38] lying um not telling the the truth
[1:00:40] because he wouldn't go against the the
[1:00:43] tradition of the Catholic church it's
[1:00:44] even in their
[1:00:45] catechism um he wouldn't go against that
[1:00:48] so I just thought I'd share that if you
[1:00:49] hadn't seen that so this one world
[1:00:51] religion this uh this Unity of all the
[1:00:54] world's churches it's continuing of
[1:00:57] course it's going to only continue
[1:00:58] slowly it's just like a birth pain is
[1:00:59] going to slowly increase but just last
[1:01:02] week we had another sign of that where
[1:01:04] the pope is saying he's telling I think
[1:01:06] he was telling Hindus and other uh
[1:01:10] religions we're all the same religion so
[1:01:13] again thank God we've been warned thank
[1:01:15] God the Holy Ghost gave us thus sayi the
[1:01:17] Lord through brother brandham um that
[1:01:19] the Catholic Church rules at the end
[1:01:20] time according to Daniel's
[1:01:21] interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[1:01:24] and the iron and Clay is is the iron is
[1:01:27] Catholicism the clay is protestantism
[1:01:30] iron and clay in the feet of that statue
[1:01:32] so of course they're coming together
[1:01:33] more and more we're just going to see it
[1:01:34] more of course as uh the end continues
[1:01:38] to to draw
[1:01:40] nigh okay so I get back to the
[1:01:43] quote Jesus will be the showdown between
[1:01:45] the denominations and Creeds which is
[1:01:47] his word when he comes a showdown the
[1:01:49] Rapture of his
[1:01:51] bride okay so that's The Showdown is god
[1:01:53] with the Pope and all these churches or
[1:01:55] is there another group group that's the
[1:01:56] true bride of Jesus Christ well we know
[1:01:58] there's another group that's the true
[1:01:59] bride of Jesus Christ and they file a
[1:02:02] prophet of God brother William brandham
[1:02:04] who prophesy with thus sayith the Lord
[1:02:06] and again remember I got a video with at
[1:02:07] least six thus sayith the Lords that
[1:02:08] have come to pass a Vindicated true
[1:02:11] prophet of
[1:02:14] God so brother BR said the first was
[1:02:16] Mount Carmel that's the first Showdown
[1:02:18] three mountains right mount carel my
[1:02:21] mom's been there I haven't been there
[1:02:22] but my mom's been there the second was
[1:02:23] Mount Transfiguration my mom's been
[1:02:25] there
[1:02:26] um and the third will be Mount Zion now
[1:02:30] what's interesting is Mount Zion is just
[1:02:33] uh Zion is kind of like the old part of
[1:02:35] the city of Jerusalem here I guess
[1:02:37] there's an old and new part there but
[1:02:39] Mount Zion is kind of like the mountain
[1:02:41] to the west of Mount Mariah but they're
[1:02:43] very very close together and the Mount
[1:02:44] Mount of Olives is a little east of
[1:02:47] Mount
[1:02:48] Mariah um and but all of Jerusalem the
[1:02:51] all the the main mountains there are all
[1:02:53] called Zion just as one name so all
[1:02:56] three of those mounts uh kind of take
[1:02:58] the name Mount Zion so brother bah puts
[1:03:01] all those together and he says there's
[1:03:04] one more Showdown Mount Zion showdown of
[1:03:07] course this is the end of the Gentile
[1:03:09] dispensation the end of the times of the
[1:03:11] Gentiles there's a showdown between the
[1:03:14] denominations of course it'll be the
[1:03:16] Roman Catholic church and the uh the
[1:03:18] ecunemical move uh the worldwide
[1:03:21] economical move uh versus the true bride
[1:03:23] of Jesus Christ it's a showdown and
[1:03:25] Jesus is The Showdown who is Jesus
[1:03:28] really with well any church that breaks
[1:03:29] the word of God Jesus won't be with them
[1:03:31] he spewed them out of their mouth he's
[1:03:33] got to speak uh through the prophet the
[1:03:35] bride and the word right uh and the
[1:03:38] church right they'll all be saying the
[1:03:39] same thing brother brah said and what
[1:03:41] they have been said will already what
[1:03:43] they're saying will already have been
[1:03:44] said in the word of God that's why we
[1:03:46] believe every word of God hallelujah in
[1:03:49] the Bible we don't add one word to it we
[1:03:50] don't take one word away we only take
[1:03:52] the King James version uh because it has
[1:03:54] the full word of God no words taken
[1:03:58] away
[1:04:00] okay and so uh again we see the three
[1:04:03] showdowns Mount Carmel was a physical
[1:04:05] Mountain um Elijah was The Showdown with
[1:04:08] the the Bale
[1:04:10] denominations uh the second one was
[1:04:12] Mount Transfiguration a physical
[1:04:14] Mountain uh John the Baptist was the
[1:04:16] Forerunner who it was the former Reign
[1:04:18] rebuked
[1:04:19] organizations uh Jesus then would have
[1:04:21] been the latter reign of that The
[1:04:23] Showdown was was with the denominational
[1:04:25] spirit spirit and so for us Mount Zion
[1:04:28] is a physical Mount but it's also a
[1:04:29] spiritual Mount because Hebrews 12 tells
[1:04:32] us that we've already come to Mount Zion
[1:04:34] let's read that verse next here
[1:04:38] um we believe brother brandom was the
[1:04:40] Forerunner to this showdown he rebuked
[1:04:42] the organizations as well Jesus will be
[1:04:44] the latter rain rapturing Faith
[1:04:47] rapturing Grace we call it and to
[1:04:49] Showdown with denominations and
[1:04:51] Creeds okay so let's go to Hebrews 12 uh
[1:04:54] look at uh
[1:04:56] Zion to show how we've already come to
[1:04:58] that we've already come to uh the
[1:05:01] Heavenly Mount Zion in other words the
[1:05:03] Throne of
[1:05:06] God Hebrews
[1:05:17] 12:23 I'm sorry Hebrews
[1:05:20] 1222 but ye are come unto Mount Zion so
[1:05:23] we've already come to Mount Zion in one
[1:05:25] way we've other words the Throne of God
[1:05:26] right now Mount Zion is in heaven it's
[1:05:28] the Throne of Jesus Christ um but for
[1:05:32] the Rapture Jesus comes down and that's
[1:05:33] The Showdown he's coming down he's going
[1:05:35] to show who is the true bride of Jesus
[1:05:38] Christ right then the fire is going to
[1:05:39] fall life is going to swallow up uh the
[1:05:42] Believers right life is going to swallow
[1:05:44] up death our bod is are going to be
[1:05:45] changed we're going to go to meet him in
[1:05:47] the air Hallelujah that's the fire of
[1:05:49] The Showdown but we are come right now
[1:05:51] to Mount Zion unto the city of the
[1:05:53] Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an
[1:05:56] innumerable company of angels see
[1:05:59] because we're already in touch with the
[1:06:00] high priest Jesus Christ in heaven we've
[1:06:02] already come to Mount Zion but then uh
[1:06:05] Jesus Christ is coming down and so it's
[1:06:07] another Mount Zion Showdown and we can
[1:06:10] even say it like this it's the Mount
[1:06:11] Zion Showdown because the true bride
[1:06:13] will live with Jesus in the New
[1:06:15] Jerusalem the Heavenly Jerusalem right
[1:06:18] that's come down to earth Hallelujah and
[1:06:20] of course minister to Jesus there in the
[1:06:22] millennial Temple but also the holy city
[1:06:25] the future home the New Jerusalem it's a
[1:06:28] showdown to see who the true bride of
[1:06:30] Jesus Christ is and by God's grace will
[1:06:32] be there uh by the grace of almighty God
[1:06:35] because we live by every word that
[1:06:37] proceeds out of the mouth of God not a
[1:06:38] church Creed not a church bylaw our
[1:06:41] Creed is Christ the word
[1:06:43] hallelujah all right and then I think
[1:06:46] I'll close with this there's uh I
[1:06:48] preached this a couple years ago but
[1:06:49] there's five reasons David taking Zion
[1:06:53] which was led through joab types the
[1:06:56] Rapture I don't know if you remember
[1:06:57] this or not I'd forgotten about it I
[1:06:59] can't remember everything but that's why
[1:07:00] I'm glad I got these notes to go back
[1:07:02] and reference um five reasons David
[1:07:06] taking uh Zion types the Rapture it was
[1:07:10] a total time of
[1:07:11] unity
[1:07:14] um the unity of David's time was the
[1:07:17] same Unity as the beginning when uh
[1:07:20] Joshua's group was unified all 12 tribes
[1:07:23] were were United around David and we get
[1:07:26] that Unity according to the fivefold
[1:07:28] ministry in Ephesians
[1:07:30] 43 I'm sorry Ephesians 4:14 till we all
[1:07:33] come in the unity of the faith
[1:07:36] Hallelujah uh second it was defeating
[1:07:39] the Invincible stronghold at The
[1:07:40] Showdown David was was even mocked by
[1:07:43] the jebusites remember they said oh even
[1:07:45] a blind man could protect this Fortress
[1:07:46] we're so
[1:07:48] fortified
[1:07:50] um taking Jerusalem stronghold types the
[1:07:52] Holy Ghost filled Church conquering The
[1:07:54] Last Enemy death
[1:07:56] which has been a stronghold since the
[1:07:57] church was born death is swallowed up in
[1:08:00] Victory death is swallowed up in life so
[1:08:02] that's the second reason uh David taking
[1:08:05] Zion types the Rapture death is swalled
[1:08:07] up in life third the king didn't take
[1:08:10] the city but his wisdom through his
[1:08:12] servants
[1:08:13] did so David himself did not conquer the
[1:08:16] city joab did by using David's wisdom uh
[1:08:19] Jesus jesus' physical body doesn't
[1:08:21] defeat The Last Enemy uh for the Rapture
[1:08:24] but jesus' spirit his church defeats The
[1:08:26] Last Enemy because the bride has made
[1:08:28] herself ready so again a beautiful type
[1:08:30] there um Jesus comes out to meet us in
[1:08:32] the air but it's the Holy Spirit they in
[1:08:34] the church uh death is swallowed up in
[1:08:38] life Hallelujah and so the Servants of
[1:08:41] God uh have the spirit of the king
[1:08:44] Hallelujah D joab had the spirit of
[1:08:46] David right uh the leadership of David
[1:08:48] we have the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:50] to conquer death Hallelujah of course
[1:08:52] that's rapturing Faith that's a latter
[1:08:54] rain verse four this uh the secret to
[1:08:58] Victory joab took the stronghold through
[1:09:00] a secret passage the bride will have the
[1:09:02] secret things according to Deuteronomy
[1:09:04] 29:29 including the finished mystery of
[1:09:06] God Revelation 10:7 also secret prayer
[1:09:09] fasting giving of alms Matthew 6 vers 46
[1:09:14] and
[1:09:15] 18 John had to go take the little book
[1:09:18] and Jesus said we have to take the
[1:09:19] kingdom by force we have to actually uh
[1:09:22] go do these commands we're supposed to
[1:09:24] go fast go go pray go give alms we're
[1:09:27] supposed to take those and do them not
[1:09:29] just hearers only uh of the word of God
[1:09:32] but doers of the word of God so we have
[1:09:34] the secret to Victory just like joab had
[1:09:37] it and Fifth and
[1:09:39] finally um the victory ushered in the
[1:09:42] physical reign of the king priest so
[1:09:45] when David brought the Ark of the
[1:09:47] presence of God into Jerusalem after the
[1:09:48] unity and the defeat of the jebusites
[1:09:51] the visible shakina of Glory presence of
[1:09:54] Christ come comes into the church after
[1:09:57] the unity uh and the
[1:10:00] Rapture Hallelujah so that we get to
[1:10:02] live in the spiritual presence or the
[1:10:04] physical presence of Jesus Christ the
[1:10:07] King and priest and the Bible said we
[1:10:09] will be ever with the Lord amen so the
[1:10:12] victory ushers in US physically being
[1:10:15] with the King priest
[1:10:20] Hallelujah okay so I think we'll stop
[1:10:22] right there by God's grace we've been a
[1:10:23] little over an hour there uh was Malachi
[1:10:26] to come we'll close with a song here and
[1:10:28] a word of prayer hope that was a
[1:10:30] blessing here tonight Saints by the
[1:10:32] grace of

[1:10:43] don't know the day or hour um just Turn
[1:10:45] Your Eyes Upon Jesus here tonight and uh
[1:10:48] I love how these uh stories like David
[1:10:51] gives us so much Revelation on so many
[1:10:53] topics right all the way from the the
[1:10:55] anger of God kindled to the fear of the
[1:10:58] Lord to sacrifice of of giving yourself
[1:11:00] as a a Living Sacrifice un God getting
[1:11:03] your first love back and then the
[1:11:05] Rapture and then Mount Mariah the New
[1:11:08] Jerusalem the Heavenly Jerusalem the
[1:11:11] Millennium uh all these thoughts tied in
[1:11:15] together here just in one simple Bible
[1:11:17] passage so we're thankful uh God's word
[1:11:20] is eternal God's word is so deep and
[1:11:22] Rich uh can never get to the bottom of
[1:11:25] it it's such a blessing uh to hear the
[1:11:28] word of God and of course do the word of
[1:11:30] God let's pray that tonight that we'll
[1:11:32] be doers of the word joab had to go take
[1:11:35] the city we've got to take the word of

[1:11:39] God the violent take it by force as we

[1:12:28] servants that will have the secret
