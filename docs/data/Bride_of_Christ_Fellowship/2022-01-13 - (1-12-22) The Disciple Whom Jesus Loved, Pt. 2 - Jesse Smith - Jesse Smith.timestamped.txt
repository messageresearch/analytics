[16:09] bibles here tonight by god's grace we'd
[16:11] like to
[16:12] look at this thought i preached on
[16:13] sunday
[16:15] i just got part two here
[16:17] of the disciple whom jesus loved
[16:20] yes sir yeah sorry let's go to john
[16:22] chapter
[16:23] 20
[16:24] one verse 20.
[16:28] yes sir
[16:33] john 21 verse 20 and 21 we'll just keep
[16:36] it short here today a little shorter by
[16:38] god's grace
[16:43] so i know uh for sure naomi's family
[16:45] loves me because they come back after
[16:47] sunday's sermon so
[16:49] now we know for sure
[16:52] nature i know you love me now because
[16:53] you listen to me preach for two hours on
[16:55] sunday but also i preached two hours on
[16:57] sunday so it's a long sermon
[17:00] and youtube cut us off after 26 minutes
[17:06] it is a great great time great
[17:08] atmosphere and just a wonderful
[17:10] time in the presence of the lord
[17:12] and uh glad you guys had a great time at
[17:13] brother cams praise god
[17:16] hallelujah very thankful about god's
[17:18] grace
[17:19] john chapter 21 verse 20 and 21
[17:26] chapter 21 verses 20 and 21.
[17:31] so i just want to look at this jet it's
[17:32] just a general scripture where
[17:35] we hear about
[17:38] the writer of this epistle
[17:41] writing about himself not calling his
[17:43] own name but calling himself the
[17:45] disciple whom jesus loved
[17:49] i love that last song we sang you know
[17:52] i could have found a way to put the name
[17:53] jesus in there but i think jesus knows
[17:55] who i was singing to
[17:56] don't you don't you think jesus knows
[17:58] that we're singing to him
[17:59] our prayer is the lord remind us who we
[18:01] are when we fall short and when we
[18:02] struggle and we forget who we are remind
[18:05] us who we are in other words transform
[18:07] my mind daily
[18:09] that i can prove the perfect will of god
[18:11] and i can remember
[18:12] i'm just not a church member
[18:14] i'm not i'm just not one out of the i'm
[18:16] not one insignificant person out of 8
[18:18] billion but i'm a child of jesus christ
[18:21] i'm a child of god
[18:23] and i've been called to a high calling
[18:26] much higher than others by god's grace
[18:28] and all is that by grace that's all by
[18:30] grace it's not by works unless any man
[18:32] should boast
[18:34] as we heard on sunday part of it of
[18:36] course is
[18:39] those who are faithful to god
[18:41] come to god and so god can give them
[18:42] more rewards because god is a rewarder
[18:45] of them that diligently seek him so he
[18:47] saves us by grace but then he invites us
[18:49] to come anytime and the more we come the
[18:51] more blessings we get
[18:52] and the more rewards we'll get in heaven
[18:54] by the grace of god not that we're going
[18:55] for rewards but we want to do the
[18:57] father's work while we're on this side
[18:59] like like the bible jesus said you want
[19:01] to work while it's day because he said
[19:03] no man can work at night time in the
[19:04] tribulation
[19:07] praise god john 21 verse 20.
[19:12] okay
[19:13] so let's see if i can adjust that
[19:22] that be better is that that okay thank
[19:25] you how's that sound occasion for the
[19:26] live stream and sound okay all right
[19:28] yeah we've had a lot of youtube problems
[19:29] and i'm not sure what the problem is i
[19:31] don't know
[19:32] i don't know
[19:33] so we'll just we're trying something a
[19:34] little different tonight hopefully that
[19:35] works better
[19:36] i've had brother william has asked me uh
[19:39] for sermons why can't i find the sermons
[19:40] i've had other people paul's asked me
[19:42] why can't i find these sermons i say
[19:44] it's
[19:44] youtube's fault or my fault i don't know
[19:46] whose fault it is
[19:47] but it's somebody's fault
[19:49] it's probably gonna come back to me
[19:50] anyway so i'll take it it's my fault
[19:53] so
[19:54] hopefully this works out all right let's
[19:56] read verses 20 and 21 together
[19:59] then i'll read 22 myself so
[20:03] i'm sorry john chapter 21
[20:06] verse 20.
[20:08] then we'll all read verses 20 and 21
[20:10] together then i'll read 22.
[20:13] good question brother thank you
[20:16] all right let's read it starts with then
[20:17] peter so let's read verses 20 and 21
[20:19] together one two three
[20:21] then peter turning about seeth the
[20:24] disciple whom jesus loved following
[20:28] which also leaned on his breast at
[20:30] supper and said lord which is he that
[20:34] betrayeth thee
[20:36] peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord
[20:39] and what shall this man do
[20:42] now i'm going to read verse 22 jesus
[20:44] saith unto him if i will he didn't say
[20:47] he would he said but if i will if it's
[20:49] my will that john tarry till i come what
[20:52] is that to thee
[20:53] follow thou me in other words don't
[20:55] worry about how long people live
[20:57] don't worry about if you're going to
[20:58] live to see the rapture or not follow
[21:00] the voice of god how many could do i'm
[21:02] going to appreciate that tonight we all
[21:04] want to live to see the rapture but
[21:06] jesus is specifically saying
[21:07] specifically saying here don't worry
[21:09] about who's going to live to the rapture
[21:10] or not follow the voice of god
[21:13] praise god i'm going to follow that
[21:14] voice
[21:15] let's have one more word of prayer here
[21:16] heavenly father as we bow our heads we
[21:18] thank you god for this beautiful
[21:19] opportunity to be in your presence
[21:20] tonight and i just pray god you'd speak
[21:22] to us and help me to move aside that the
[21:24] holy spirit can preach lord i felt that

[21:51] that are listen on the archive but
[21:53] especially i pray minister to our local
[21:54] flock i pray in jesus christ's name and
[21:57] saint said
[21:58] amen god bless you as you're being
[21:59] seated praise god
[22:07] i'm going to set a timer for 45 minutes
[22:09] and maybe i can do that we'll see i
[22:10] don't know if it's possible but let's
[22:11] see
[22:13] uh
[22:17] i like to
[22:18] be mindful of time you know someone's
[22:20] got school tomorrow right girls
[22:21] someone's got school tomorrow
[22:23] first of all got us rest of us got in
[22:25] the home you know so
[22:27] uh
[22:27] let's look to the lord here tonight
[22:29] let's look at part two i don't know if
[22:30] i'll preach a part three or not kind of
[22:31] goes out tonight or see how tonight goes
[22:34] um
[22:36] but i hope by the end of this service
[22:37] church you know how much god loves you
[22:40] and i trust you'll understand how much
[22:41] god loves this church
[22:43] that's my prayer
[22:45] hallelujah
[22:47] so we read our texts here tonight i'm
[22:48] just gonna do a quick review from the
[22:49] two-hour sermon or the mayor
[22:55] long-winded sermon whatever
[22:58] so on sunday we looked at five
[22:59] scriptures
[23:00] where john says he was the disciple whom
[23:03] jesus loved
[23:05] and then we looked at uh how jesus loved
[23:08] all his disciples and the sisters
[23:11] in other words jesus did not have any
[23:12] favorites
[23:15] he loved martha
[23:17] mary
[23:18] lazarus
[23:20] all his disciples which included john
[23:23] so i kind of asked the question why
[23:24] would he call himself i'm the disciple
[23:26] jesus loved
[23:29] then we looked at how god's love is
[23:31] unquestionable no one here should ever
[23:32] question god's love for them i know we
[23:35] do that's why we're just saying that
[23:36] remind me who i am
[23:38] right we do but none of us should if we
[23:40] ever get down to praying about it and
[23:41] thinking about it and the battles
[23:43] between satan and and the word of god
[23:45] and ours the holy spirit our souls the
[23:46] holy spirit should get the victory that
[23:48] god loves us
[23:51] that's why we do memorials that's why we
[23:53] you know read the bible and pray because
[23:55] we must remember that god loves us very
[23:57] much
[23:58] he's interested in every part of our
[23:59] lives
[24:01] and i've just been reminded of that
[24:03] especially this week here and i'll
[24:04] explain why at the very end i'll explain
[24:06] something at the end where god truly
[24:08] reminded me this week that he hears all
[24:10] my prayers
[24:11] even just simple humble little prayers
[24:14] i'm not even you know
[24:16] on my knees or anything and god hears
[24:18] our prayers i love jesus praise god i i
[24:20] want you to love jesus with all your
[24:22] heart praise god
[24:25] then we looked at how jesus sometimes
[24:27] austin and lena jesus would sometimes
[24:29] leave his other eight decide or i'm
[24:31] sorry other uh nine disciples behind and
[24:34] then he would go out and he would work
[24:36] with peter james and john
[24:38] so it looked like jesus had favorites
[24:40] but he didn't
[24:41] those three just had special gifts that
[24:43] jesus wanted to use
[24:45] okay peter had the gift of faith
[24:49] john had the gift of love
[24:51] and then james had a gift of hope
[24:53] so faith hope and love
[24:56] that's in the bible these are the three
[24:57] greatest gifts of god but the greatest
[24:59] of these is let's all say together the
[25:00] greatest is
[25:01] love love is the greatest of all gifts
[25:03] that's what first corinthians 13 says
[25:06] there's these three faith hope and love
[25:08] but the greatest of these is love the
[25:10] king james calls it charity but it's the
[25:11] same thing
[25:14] and for one example brother austin you
[25:16] know uh
[25:18] when jesus raised jairus daughter from
[25:19] the dead he said get all these mourners
[25:21] out they would actually hire
[25:23] women to cry and mourn to help the
[25:25] family feel better you know after a
[25:27] funeral
[25:28] because just because the getting out all
[25:30] the emotion helped right you know
[25:32] if we don't if we don't mourn over
[25:34] uh sad things in our lives it gets it
[25:36] gets stuck in here right and eventually
[25:38] it's going to spill over on somebody
[25:40] so there is a lot of wisdom in getting
[25:41] all your tears and weeping and crying
[25:43] there's a lot of wisdom in that
[25:45] so they had they done that at jairus's
[25:46] house his little daughter died well
[25:48] jesus walks in there and he said this
[25:50] death or this is not a death she's just
[25:52] sleeping and everybody starts laughing
[25:54] oh jesus
[25:56] he's really crazy this guy and jesus
[25:58] said get out he said get everybody out
[25:59] except jairus daughter
[26:01] and these three peter james and john so
[26:03] he kicks them out of the house
[26:05] now that don't seem very like it was
[26:06] very nice but jesus had to do that and
[26:08] the bible said because they didn't
[26:10] believe
[26:11] they didn't believe a miracle was
[26:12] possible so see when a miracle happens
[26:14] you have to get all the unbelief out
[26:16] and you have to have just faith hope and
[26:19] love
[26:20] amen praise god
[26:21] and so jesus walked over and he he said
[26:24] rise he said uh he told his daughter
[26:26] rise and she rose
[26:28] well fast forward years later jesus
[26:30] already died rose went to heaven peter
[26:33] gets called to a house of a dead woman
[26:35] she's already dead her name's dorcas or
[26:37] tabitha
[26:38] and peter does the same thing peter
[26:39] hears them all crying peter says i
[26:41] remember what jesus taught me he had
[26:43] faith he kicked all them out and he went
[26:45] over to tabitha he said tabitha rise
[26:48] and she got up in the name of god in the
[26:49] name of the lord praise god
[26:51] so that's a good example of how jesus
[26:53] was teaching these peter james and john
[26:55] he was teaching them things they needed
[26:57] to know for their future ministries
[26:59] and they had special gifts but jesus did
[27:02] not have favorites
[27:03] because the bible said he loved them all
[27:06] he loved them to the end amen and that's
[27:08] what we're going to do we're going to
[27:09] love jesus to the end praise god if the
[27:11] end is this year for america we're going
[27:13] to love jesus to the end praise god amen
[27:16] if the end of our lives is next year the
[27:17] year after or five years down the road
[27:19] doesn't matter we're gonna love jesus
[27:20] all the way to the end
[27:22] i don't plan on stopping i don't i don't
[27:24] plan on giving up early i plan on giving
[27:26] him being faithful to death and faithful
[27:28] unto death praise god amen
[27:32] that's the kind of faith we have to have
[27:34] praise god
[27:36] faithful to death
[27:37] uh
[27:38] is different than faithful unto death
[27:41] faithful unto death means you're
[27:42] faithful knowing that you're gonna die
[27:46] faithful to death just means you're
[27:47] faithful till you die but we want to be
[27:49] faithful to either one we want to be
[27:50] faithful all the way
[27:52] pray
[27:55] god would have us die by martyr whether
[27:57] god would have us die a natural death or
[27:59] whether god would rapture us we want to
[28:00] be faithful to the end praise god
[28:02] because we know once the end comes it's
[28:04] just the beginning praise god hallelujah
[28:06] when the end of this life comes we step
[28:09] into the next life and that's an eternal
[28:10] life amen
[28:12] hallelujah the end here is just the
[28:14] beginning amen hallelujah praise god
[28:18] now we then we saw how god is impartial
[28:20] so god loves everyone but then he has to
[28:22] give rewards to those who obey his word
[28:26] and they become his beloved because but
[28:29] be he four knew beforehand that the
[28:31] other ones wouldn't choose him but the
[28:33] ones that would would and so he would
[28:35] love them with special love
[28:37] because the others would just fight
[28:38] against god
[28:40] and he would show them love but
[28:41] eventually the bible said he would turn
[28:43] on them the bible calls it reprobate
[28:45] mind
[28:46] because that's what the bible said the
[28:47] bible says jacob have i loved and esau
[28:50] have i hated
[28:51] so god foreknew and the bible the bible
[28:53] says in the book of romans the bible
[28:55] said god foreign knew that esau was
[28:56] going to be a renegade and he was going
[28:58] to be a reprobate so god tried to get
[29:00] him god
[29:01] tried to get him to repent but then
[29:03] eventually he turned a reprobate and
[29:04] then god fought against esau
[29:07] but god loved jacob because jacob wanted
[29:10] the blessing amen jacob wanted a new
[29:12] birth amen jacob one of the the
[29:15] inheritance praise god and he wrestled
[29:18] with an angel till he got it praise god
[29:20] that's what we need to do wrestle with
[29:22] god wrestle in prayer you know battle in
[29:24] prayer keep believing keep praying until
[29:26] you get the answer to your prayer
[29:29] amen
[29:30] glory
[29:34] now
[29:35] the next we saw how god loved job so we
[29:37] went through job's life now brother
[29:39] austin i'm just gonna i'm just gonna
[29:40] back up and show you and lean on this
[29:41] because i don't you probably never heard
[29:43] it and it might be a help to you
[29:45] job uh
[29:48] had probably the greatest test there
[29:50] ever was
[29:51] in the old testament i can't think of a
[29:53] greater one maybe joseph you know in
[29:54] prison like that i don't know
[29:56] um
[29:58] but if you remember the story of job you
[29:59] remember the story a little bit brother
[30:01] okay so job was a he was a godly man it
[30:04] was before the it was in the old
[30:05] testament about the days of abraham
[30:08] and uh
[30:09] job had
[30:11] how many kids did he have seven
[30:13] oh lots of kids okay i could maybe seven
[30:16] daughters
[30:17] with seven daughters i think
[30:19] okay ten kids and three of them were
[30:21] daughters is that what it was okay yeah
[30:22] anyways yeah lots of kids and he had
[30:24] lots of cattle i read an article one
[30:26] time and they said it was equivalent to
[30:27] about five million dollars today so he
[30:30] had five million dollars sit in his bank
[30:31] account because he was so rich
[30:33] but in heaven
[30:35] satan come up and said well you he only
[30:37] serves you because you bless him well
[30:39] let me back up
[30:40] all the devils had to come before god
[30:42] and present themselves and tell god what
[30:44] they were doing of course god knew what
[30:45] they were doing but god still makes all
[30:47] the demons come before him
[30:48] and god recommended job to the devil
[30:52] god said have you considered my servant
[30:54] job
[30:56] a man who's perfect a man whose
[30:58] integrity have you considered him and
[31:00] satan said well you protect he only
[31:01] serves you because he protects you
[31:03] early serves you because you're
[31:04] protecting him
[31:06] and god said that's he said fine he said
[31:08] no he said i'll prove to you
[31:10] that that job
[31:13] serves me because he loves me
[31:15] and he said go ahead he said touch his
[31:17] take everything from him and so satan
[31:19] left from the prince of god and he
[31:21] brought a whirlwind and tornado he
[31:23] destroyed all of his cattle
[31:26] he destroyed all of his house he let the
[31:29] house where all his kids were eating a
[31:30] meal together he let that house fall
[31:32] down satan destroyed that house and
[31:33] killed all job's family so job had
[31:35] nothing left except him and his wife and
[31:37] what did he say the bible said he got on
[31:39] his face on his knees in his face he
[31:41] said the lord gives and the lord takes
[31:42] away blessed be the name of the
[31:44] lord so he passed the test in other
[31:47] words even though he lost everything he
[31:49] passed the test
[31:50] well you know all the devils come back
[31:52] for another round
[31:53] and god said hey devil have you
[31:55] considered my servant job he does it
[31:56] again
[31:58] and he says well eye for an eye you know
[32:00] tooth for tooth he said he said a man
[32:02] will he said job will curse you to his
[32:04] face if you just if you take away his
[32:06] health
[32:07] and god said go but don't take his life
[32:10] in other words other words you can do
[32:12] anything to job just don't touch his
[32:13] life and the bible said instantly satan
[32:15] come down and he smoked job with sores
[32:19] and he had to take glass and cut his
[32:21] sores can you imagine taking glass
[32:24] to kind of get relief from your sores he
[32:26] would take glass and it was all over him
[32:28] from head to toe he lost all his hair he
[32:30] couldn't even sleep for months brother
[32:32] couldn't sleep for months
[32:37] and he got so skinny he's kind of like
[32:38] jesus he said my bones i can see my
[32:40] bones they're staring at me
[32:42] from this awful condition with the sores
[32:46] and after all these months he starts
[32:47] complaining to god and then
[32:50] a man came
[32:51] by lahu and came told him you're wrong
[32:54] and then job said i'm
[32:56] i i'm righteous god needs to come talk
[32:58] to me and god came down to talk to him
[33:01] so if you ever read job you need to read
[33:03] job
[33:04] god come down and never answer job's
[33:06] question he just said have you uh he
[33:08] said do you where were you when the the
[33:10] foundation of the earth was settled
[33:13] he asked him uh he asked him do you know
[33:15] where uh do you know where the
[33:16] storehouses of snow are
[33:18] you know where he said in other words
[33:20] you know do you know where i keep the
[33:21] snow
[33:22] and of course he asked job 60 questions
[33:24] and job couldn't say anything
[33:27] and after god left without answering his
[33:29] question the bible said job fell on his
[33:31] face and repented in dust and ashes and
[33:33] said i abhor myself therefore i repent
[33:36] and dust and ashes he said i spoke
[33:38] things i should not have spoke
[33:42] after all that god tells job's friends
[33:45] go job needs to pray for you and you'll
[33:47] be healed and then after joe prayed for
[33:49] them job was healed and god gave job
[33:51] double children and double finances than
[33:53] he ever did
[33:56] so in other words joe passed the test
[33:58] but the thing was god knew he'd passed
[34:00] the test
[34:02] hallelujah praise god amen
[34:04] now in heaven brother austin
[34:06] god told satan job is perfect but on
[34:09] earth god rebuked job all the time
[34:12] god rebuked him with 60 questions god
[34:14] rebuked him through elijah
[34:17] so we have to understand things are
[34:19] different in heaven and earth in heaven
[34:20] we've got a savior praise god in heaven
[34:23] we've got a lamb of god who takes away
[34:25] all of our sin amen
[34:27] and in heaven we're perfect praise god
[34:29] amen it's like we're a finished work
[34:31] already in heaven the bible said your
[34:33] theophany always beholds the face of the
[34:35] father which is in heaven amen
[34:38] in other words your spiritual body is
[34:39] waiting there for you in heaven it's a
[34:41] perfect body in other words god knows
[34:43] you're going to be a perfect being and
[34:45] god has a body for you to go and after
[34:47] this body dies you have a perfect body
[34:49] to go to and in god's eyes you're
[34:51] already complete you're already perfect
[34:53] amen but on earth sometimes we're
[34:56] failures
[34:57] on earth sometimes given sinful nature
[35:00] right we fall short of god's glory and
[35:02] we upset with god we see things about
[35:04] god we shouldn't say
[35:06] so god has to spank us on earth but in
[35:08] heaven he's like you consider my servant
[35:11] and you consider my servant beatrice
[35:13] she's perfect
[35:15] hallelujah you consider my sermon
[35:17] william he's perfect
[35:20] right and the uh god allows us to be
[35:22] tested god doesn't tempt us but he
[35:24] allows satan to test us or tempt us
[35:27] because he knows we'll pass the test and
[35:29] the bible says in first corinthians 10
[35:31] god will not give us a temptation that
[35:33] we cannot overcome but in every in every
[35:36] temptation there's an escape route amen
[35:38] there's an exit door in every temptation
[35:40] every room of temptation we come into
[35:42] god makes an escape door and that door
[35:45] is christ amen
[35:47] hallelujah
[35:49] but brother uh austin sister lena
[35:53] in heaven job was perfect but on earth
[35:55] he had a fear problem he was always
[35:57] afraid that sound familiar
[35:59] we all got it
[36:01] i had it when coleman first came out
[36:03] sometimes i get it still too like when
[36:05] is this nation gonna end are they gonna
[36:06] lock us up or you know sometimes we
[36:08] we battle that
[36:09] job had great fear
[36:12] elijah said job had iniquity iniquity is
[36:15] purposeful sin it's purposeful
[36:17] transgression against god even though
[36:19] you know the right commandments
[36:21] we all have iniquities
[36:22] we all do things wrong when we know we
[36:24] shouldn't
[36:26] so did job job was not just in other
[36:28] words he had pride he wasn't fair he
[36:31] wasn't treating god fair
[36:33] job was also a little lazy at times the
[36:35] bible said he was at ease
[36:38] so he wouldn't pray like he should and
[36:40] the church said
[36:41] he wouldn't read his bible like he
[36:42] should
[36:44] of course i don't know if he had a bible
[36:45] other than the stars
[36:47] i'm not sure about that
[36:49] also the bible said he was guilty of
[36:51] rebelling against god while he was in
[36:53] the trial how many times do we say the
[36:55] wrong thing in the trial
[36:57] like i don't deserve this
[37:00] yet we do
[37:02] right
[37:03] and we don't get as much as we deserve
[37:06] that's how merciful that's how loving
[37:07] god is
[37:09] so job had all these faults on earth
[37:12] brother sister but in heaven god said
[37:14] you're perfect because he sacrificed all
[37:16] the time amen
[37:17] because he hit a lamb he would kill the
[37:19] lamb he would kill the ox he would
[37:20] sacrifice and because he kept the
[37:22] promise because he kept god's command of
[37:24] sacrifice in heaven he was totally
[37:26] forgiven
[37:27] god said he's perfect
[37:29] and that was under the blood of bulls
[37:31] and goats what about us under the blood
[37:33] of jesus christ amen
[37:35] how much more are we perfect in heaven
[37:37] right now praise god
[37:40] because we don't have animal blood we
[37:42] have holy sinless son of god blood amen
[37:46] that totally abolishes all sin praise
[37:49] god hallelujah
[37:50] it sends it all away
[37:53] so don't feel discouraged on earth we
[37:55] get rebuked god spanks us that's
[37:57] supposed to happen but in heaven he's
[37:59] bragging on us
[38:00] amen
[38:01] he's bragging on us amen because he
[38:04] knows the sacrifices we're making the
[38:06] prayers the trust and the blood the
[38:09] the request for forgiveness he sees it
[38:12] and he honors it and heaven backs it up
[38:14] amen
[38:19] now
[38:21] also
[38:22] brother austin lena along with his
[38:24] problems he did a lot of good things on
[38:26] the earth too
[38:29] he lived for others he gave widows money
[38:31] so men that women that didn't have
[38:32] husbands and if you didn't have a
[38:34] husband those days you were like a
[38:35] beggar
[38:37] because a woman couldn't work
[38:40] fatherless he helped the fathers who had
[38:42] no dads in other words the beggars
[38:45] he loved his enemies he was good to his
[38:46] enemies even though they cussed him out
[38:48] or hated him or whatever he was still
[38:49] good to them
[38:50] he trusted not in riches although he was
[38:52] rich and that beautiful you can be rich
[38:54] and not trust in riches
[38:59] and then he helped strangers
[39:02] right that's what we should do help
[39:04] strangers
[39:05] and then he overcame mind battles he
[39:07] said i'm not going to look at other
[39:08] women i've made a promise in my mind
[39:10] look look how pure this guy was
[39:12] this guy meant business with god
[39:15] but was he human too
[39:18] yeah
[39:19] did he rebel against god sometimes yes
[39:21] he did
[39:22] he did
[39:24] but yet god loved him and allowed him to
[39:26] suffer so that he could be more pure
[39:29] after the trial
[39:31] how many know god's going to make you
[39:32] more pure after your trials
[39:35] there is a purpose for every suffering
[39:37] in your life it's going to make you love
[39:39] god more afterwards
[39:41] everyone
[39:42] everyone
[39:45] the bible said jesus learned obedience
[39:47] through the things he suffered so the
[39:49] more you suffer the more showing you
[39:51] you've got to obey the word of god
[39:53] obey the word of god
[39:58] then we looked at uh okay yeah i'll head
[40:00] back up so that's just a quick review of
[40:01] job now i preached just a couple sermons
[40:03] on job i may preach longer on that i
[40:06] really love that book
[40:08] i feel like there's so many more nuggets
[40:09] in there
[40:10] well then on sunday we looked at how our
[40:12] thankfulness for god's love we ought to
[40:13] be very thankful for the love of god
[40:16] everything we say do it should all be
[40:18] thanks for the love of god
[40:21] and then we close i kind of close kind
[40:22] of fast i'm going to go over this a
[40:23] little bit i'll just go over right now
[40:25] here
[40:27] now i'm going to slowly
[40:28] say what i said fast on sunday
[40:31] now some of you might have a hard time
[40:32] thinking sunday was fast but i did close
[40:35] fast
[40:36] so i got this from john piper a lot of
[40:38] these thoughts he's a preacher and of
[40:39] course i don't agree with him on
[40:40] everything but
[40:41] john he said john said jesus loved
[40:44] lazarus than his other disciples his
[40:46] other 11 disciples in all these verses
[40:48] so john is not saying
[40:51] he's excluding others from jesus love so
[40:53] when john would say hi i'm the disciple
[40:56] that jesus loves he wasn't saying jesus
[40:58] doesn't love you that's not what he was
[40:59] saying because jesus loved everybody
[41:02] the kids would sit on his lap right he
[41:03] said let the little kids come sit on my
[41:05] lap praise god
[41:07] i wonder if he said let me give you 10
[41:09] jumps tonight i wonder if he said that
[41:12] or maybe he just did five i don't know
[41:13] probably a lot of kids around there
[41:16] no he loved the kids
[41:18] yeah
[41:20] maybe he gave him fruits fruit strips or
[41:22] something like that
[41:23] raisins dried fruit you know
[41:26] he loved the kids he didn't say don't
[41:28] come to me he said let the little kids
[41:29] come to me
[41:31] but john had a close relationship with
[41:33] jesus
[41:35] uh and he so much so brother that he
[41:37] would lean into his bosom
[41:39] and think about the last time i hugged
[41:40] you
[41:41] now what if by the house when i hug you
[41:42] you would have tried to let go but i
[41:43] ought to hug you tighter i just want to
[41:45] put my head right there on your chest
[41:47] what would you have thought you want
[41:49] uh oh okay okay bro jesse all right yeah
[41:52] that's how we are with jesus right
[41:54] that's how john was with jesus
[41:57] jesus would just be sitting there he
[41:59] said let me come up and just hug into
[42:00] you
[42:02] i just love you
[42:03] amen praise god the disciple amen that
[42:06] love jesus amen the disciple and he
[42:08] called himself i'm the disciple that
[42:10] jesus loved
[42:11] look jesus never took no what about a
[42:13] lesson that is i didn't see that jesus
[42:15] will never turn you away from his bosom
[42:18] if you want to fellowship with jesus he
[42:19] ain't going to push you away just like
[42:20] john he's going to let you settle right
[42:22] in for some communion praise god
[42:25] hallelujah for some fellowship praise
[42:27] god you ever see jesus pushing john away
[42:30] hey don't you're not too close man you
[42:32] got germs you might have coveted
[42:34] you ever see him pushing him away
[42:39] of course if you're sick don't try to
[42:41] spread it to somebody on purpose
[42:43] but look we never see jesus turning him
[42:45] away but rather jesus just lets him rest
[42:48] there right there in his bosom
[42:50] john as long as you want to stay there
[42:51] buddy
[42:52] you can stay there
[42:55] thank you lord
[42:57] i love you
[42:59] i wonder if he felt i've only got a few
[43:00] more
[43:01] only got a few more weeks or
[43:03] months with him
[43:06] remember he was going to live till he
[43:07] was 95
[43:09] 100 maybe more he had all those years
[43:11] without christ
[43:12] if you were a disciple which one would
[43:14] you be
[43:15] john
[43:16] i don't know you'd want to lean in
[43:18] jesus's muslim praise god
[43:21] see they had a close relationship right
[43:24] peter even asked john he said john ask
[43:26] jesus and you're really there close he
[43:28] remember can you imagine that at the
[43:29] table john asked jesus who's the
[43:32] betrayer they were all asking am i lord
[43:34] said i said i
[43:36] so peter says
[43:39] i'll i'll go to a likely source i know
[43:41] where i can get the answer i'll get it
[43:42] from the one who leans in his bosom
[43:44] ah that's what it's like when people
[43:46] come to you say i know i want you to
[43:48] pray for me praise god i want your
[43:49] advice about the bible
[43:52] i want to know what you say about the
[43:53] bible see they know you you spend time

[44:23] of things going on we had a lot of kids
[44:24] that were just out of control and i
[44:26] would hear them screaming and mr capra
[44:27] would be carrying these kids
[44:30] out of the school you know and
[44:32] they were just out of control
[44:34] and there were times uh
[44:37] you know he was just really struggling
[44:38] but he looked across and he said he said
[44:40] you know i was sitting there talking
[44:41] with my wife at home and he said
[44:43] he said all of a sudden you came into my
[44:45] mind
[44:45] this was back in uh
[44:47] december i think it was
[44:49] and he said
[44:50] he said oh jesse the reason the devil's
[44:53] fighting us so hard is because jesse's
[44:55] starting to start he's trying to start
[44:56] bible club back up again
[44:58] [Laughter]
[45:00] and i just laugh i said well i said that
[45:02] might be it sir
[45:03] i said one thing i know is jesus wants
[45:06] the little children to come unto him
[45:08] amen
[45:09] i didn't hear you
[45:12] and i said jesus likes when little
[45:14] children get saved sanctified and they
[45:17] serve the lord all their life now of
[45:18] course i meant holy ghost filled too you
[45:20] know i just forgot to say that

[45:27] and peter had to go to john that guy
[45:29] that leans in his bosom there that guy
[45:32] john ask him ask him why didn't he just
[45:34] ask him
[45:37] because he knew john had this close
[45:39] relationship with christ
[45:43] also piper went on to say this
[45:45] also this phrase of calling yourself i'm
[45:47] the disciple whom jesus loved
[45:49] this shows that he was an eyewitness of
[45:51] all these things
[45:54] second this was john's way of saying his
[45:57] most important identity is being loved
[45:59] by god
[46:02] just like that i don't want you to call
[46:03] me brother jesse i mean you can
[46:06] don't look at me as a pastor
[46:07] don't even i don't even want you to look
[46:08] at me a friend
[46:10] i mean you will right i'm your brother
[46:12] i want you to look at me as a disciple
[46:14] that jesus loves praise god
[46:17] hallelujah
[46:18] that would be the greatest privilege you
[46:20] could ever give to me in my life that
[46:22] when you saw me
[46:24] that's a child of god right there
[46:26] god loves that man right there
[46:29] praise god isn't that what you want
[46:30] praise god people look at you and they
[46:32] see the grace of god on your life and
[46:34] they don't see any of your identity they
[46:36] just see god's love poured out on you
[46:38] amen
[46:39] hallelujah
[46:40] it's beautiful
[46:45] didn't paul say it is no longer i that
[46:47] lives
[46:48] but christ
[46:49] that lives within me
[46:53] praise god amen he said i don't live he
[46:55] said i don't live by my faith he said i
[46:57] live by the faith of the son of god
[47:00] which gave his life for me and died for
[47:02] me amen
[47:04] so when you look at me
[47:06] just see jesus
[47:08] just see a testimony of god's love amen
[47:10] just see a testimony of god's grace amen
[47:14] when you look at me just look just think
[47:15] of the blood of jesus christ
[47:20] what did brother graham call it just
[47:22] just he said call me a trophy of god's
[47:24] grace
[47:26] when you look at me just see a trophy
[47:28] jesus i'm jesus's trophy
[47:31] you're jesus trophy he fought the
[47:34] battles and you're the reward amen
[47:37] you're the reward that jesus fought the
[47:39] battle and he won hallelujah
[47:42] he didn't lose he won by death he
[47:44] defeated death and won and conquered
[47:47] death amen he took all the powers of
[47:49] death and he overcame that and you're
[47:52] the trophy praise god
[47:54] you imagine that's you but austin you're
[47:57] the one jesus holds up i defeated the
[47:58] devil here's my trophy you know how they
[48:00] kissed the trophy that's you that's
[48:02] that's you that's jesus kissing you
[48:03] brother austin
[48:05] this there's my trophy
[48:07] i'm a trophy of god's grace amen
[48:10] he fought the devil to defeat the devil
[48:12] and you're the reward you're the trophy
[48:18] hallelujah then we saw that john was
[48:21] speaking like paul when paul said i'm
[48:23] loved by christ because this is why i
[48:26] live christ's love
[48:28] for me controls me
[48:31] i'm constrained by the love of christ i
[48:34] am arrested i am imprisoned to the love
[48:36] of christ
[48:39] i can't get out of this love amen
[48:41] hallelujah i'm locked in i'm sealed in
[48:45] i'm shut in to the love of christ amen
[48:48] and there's no getting out praise god
[48:51] i'm sealed and i'm a prisoner for christ
[48:54] whatever he says that's what i do
[48:58] oh hallelujah
[49:03] so the revelation is that john knew how
[49:06] much god loved him which is why he
[49:08] called himself the disciple
[49:10] that jesus loved
[49:13] get your bibles let's read this uh
[49:14] maokai lydia can you read this for us
[49:16] luke 9 52. if you if you can get your
[49:18] bible let's read that so i flew through
[49:20] this so fast i didn't have time really
[49:21] to stop and preach it
[49:24] i was just trying to close and
[49:26] let everybody stand up and worship the
[49:28] lord and get their legs feeling a little
[49:29] better
[49:32] put smile on their face
[49:35] a lot of you were smiling already
[49:37] luke 9 52 lady doing read 52 53
[49:41] and 54.
[50:04] now can i read all the way to 54 then
[50:06] i'm sorry 56.
[50:07] but he turned and refused
[50:17] amen
[50:18] now in the scripture
[50:20] john and his brother james are called
[50:22] the sons of thunder now what do you
[50:24] think of when you think of thunder
[50:25] loud right yeah loud shaking yeah good
[50:28] good nature's shaking
[50:30] you get shaken up and you hear a lot of
[50:32] booming sound right they were called
[50:34] sons of thunder because of their zeal
[50:36] right john was so zealous if they won't
[50:39] receive jesus let's call fire down from
[50:41] heaven and destroy this whole city
[50:44] and jesus said you don't even know john
[50:46] you're going to be the disciple of love
[50:47] but you don't even know right now you
[50:48] don't even have any love right now
[50:51] you're filled with this uh too much zeal
[50:53] you got an angry spirit on you you gotta
[50:55] murder a spirit on you
[50:58] i didn't come to destroy man that's
[51:00] leader for the tribulation i come to
[51:02] save man's lives
[51:05] but see he had this reputation i'm a son
[51:08] of thunder i'm i got zeal i want god's
[51:10] power to show god's will to be done
[51:12] right now if not judgment and wrath
[51:15] praise god amen
[51:18] i saw a zealot like some people i don't
[51:20] know some preachers but i'm zealous you
[51:21] know
[51:22] mercy god have mercy on them
[51:24] uh yours truly is one of them probably
[51:28] but god has a way to soften them over
[51:30] the years
[51:31] god has a way of rolling those stones
[51:32] against that rough stone against another
[51:34] stone pretty soon it gets all smoothed
[51:37] out over the years praise god
[51:40] see jesus protected don from murder in
[51:43] other words or having a bad attitude
[51:46] right
[51:46] angry zealous uh
[51:48] wrathful attitude jesus saved john from
[51:51] himself right
[51:53] so see before the cross of christ in the
[51:55] upper room john had this murderous
[51:57] mentality this judgment mentality
[52:00] and he was not patient and did not have
[52:02] the divine love that he later was known
[52:04] for
[52:06] in other words he wasn't exercising love
[52:08] at that particular moment although that
[52:10] was his gift he wasn't exercising it
[52:14] how many know you don't always exercise
[52:16] your gifts the way you should
[52:19] you might use them for the wrong thing
[52:22] especially a preacher especially a
[52:24] preacher
[52:26] because they're up in public right
[52:28] if you're not a preacher well your
[52:29] mistakes are not broadcast over youtube
[52:33] and then people corn you and email you
[52:36] and make more videos about you
[52:40] which i don't want to make mistakes but
[52:42] i'm just likely to because i'm a human
[52:47] now i want you to notice this ephesians
[52:48] 2 says
[52:50] all of us had our conversation in times
[52:52] past in the lust of the flesh so before
[52:54] we're christians we were just living
[52:56] whatever made our flesh feel good we did
[52:58] it and the church said
[53:00] okay and the mind whatever your mind
[53:02] would make you feel good you just did
[53:03] that
[53:04] and we were by nature the children of
[53:06] wrath even as others sound like john
[53:07] doesn't it he was a child of wrath you
[53:09] want a wrath to fall on the samarans
[53:11] right
[53:13] but god
[53:14] who's rich in mercy for his great love
[53:18] wherewith he loved us so god looked on
[53:21] upon us as we were giving ourselves to
[53:23] sin and loving sin god had pity on us in
[53:26] his great love and he said they're dead
[53:27] in their sins but i'm going to send them
[53:29] my love and it's going to make them go
[53:32] from dead to alive
[53:34] because i have great love for these
[53:36] fallen humans i'm going to send them my
[53:38] love it's not a small love it's not a
[53:41] diminished love it's not a anything it's
[53:43] a great love it's a powerful love it's a
[53:46] sufficient love i don't know it's more
[53:48] than enough love
[53:52] hallelujah
[53:54] god's love is not lacking tonight
[53:57] it's our love that's lacking
[54:02] so even when we were dead in sins hath
[54:04] then he quickened us
[54:06] together with christ by grace you are
[54:09] saved
[54:10] so god saw all of us wandering around in
[54:12] our sins and our lusts and our our bad
[54:15] habits and everything
[54:16] and his great love said i'm going to
[54:18] save them
[54:20] i know they want to be saved he sent
[54:22] them he sent us his grace he sent us his
[54:25] love and now we go from dead to life
[54:30] we didn't even know we were dead while
[54:31] we were alive did we
[54:33] we didn't even know
[54:34] until we heard the real gospel and saw a
[54:37] real condition
[54:38] i don't want him but to be dead i want
[54:40] to be alive and so we repented and as we
[54:42] repented god poured out his love the
[54:44] bible said he shed it like he was
[54:46] stabbed on the cross he shed his love
[54:48] abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost
[54:50] amen hallelujah
[54:54] oh that's rich amen that's glorious
[54:58] god's great love quickened us to life he
[55:00] filled us with his love
[55:03] so we can endure our trials through love
[55:07] so the only thing that's going to hold
[55:08] us in the hard times is his love
[55:12] he said i need to put something in them
[55:14] so that when they have trials they can
[55:15] overcome the trials he said oh i know
[55:17] the perfect thing my love
[55:21] he could have put anything in there he
[55:22] could have put jewels he could have put
[55:24] diamonds he could have put medicine he
[55:26] could have put anything in there to heal
[55:27] our souls but he knew that wouldn't do
[55:29] it the money wouldn't do it but he knew
[55:31] love would do it and love still does it
[55:33] love will always help you overcome
[55:38] love for god
[55:40] hallelujah
[55:43] the bible says
[55:44] hope maketh not ashamed
[55:47] so when you're hoping for the rapture
[55:48] you're not ashamed of it
[55:50] because it makes you unashamed
[55:53] because the love of god is shed abroad
[55:55] in our hearts by the holy ghost
[55:57] which is given unto us
[56:00] anybody that's not expressing love
[56:01] probably isn't born again
[56:03] or if they're not expressing it they're
[56:05] in the midst of a complex a battle but
[56:06] give them a little bit time they're
[56:07] going to overcome they're going to show
[56:08] the love of god again
[56:11] but if they never show love if they
[56:12] never show the love of jesus christ
[56:14] they're probably not born again
[56:18] see with god's love in our hearts or
[56:21] john's heart john could endure the
[56:23] trials of life you remember the story
[56:25] he was boiled in oil
[56:28] and he didn't die all the other guys
[56:30] died that would bore on oil but not john
[56:35] i don't know why they didn't cut off his
[56:36] head why didn't they just cut off his
[56:37] head i don't know
[56:38] right you ever think about that just
[56:40] like i told you remember with moses
[56:41] moses walked in there with aaron all
[56:43] those times past those guards of see
[56:44] pharaoh and they never killed him
[56:46] see if god has a calling on your life
[56:48] the devil can't touch you
[56:50] oh i didn't hear i said something right
[56:52] there amen if god wants you to do
[56:54] something there's no devil in hell that
[56:56] can stop you praise god because you have
[56:58] a divine mission that was eternally
[57:00] planned out by god and god's going to
[57:02] make sure you fulfill it
[57:04] hallelujah
[57:07] no man can stop a real son or daughter
[57:09] of god
[57:11] satan might discourage you and try to
[57:12] get you upset you just stay in the love
[57:14] of god
[57:15] you're going to get the victory
[57:19] well oil didn't work
[57:21] so he said oh i'm getting rid of this
[57:22] guy he's a soothsayer
[57:24] so they strand him on the isle of patmos
[57:28] patmos is right here
[57:31] it's uh close to ephesus modern-day
[57:33] turkey these are some bible cities
[57:35] you'll be familiar with
[57:39] so there's athens you know
[57:43] all kinds of places there here's crete
[57:46] paul had ministry at crete
[57:48] so they they sent john out i'm tired of
[57:50] you john i'm going to send you out to
[57:52] the isle of patmos we don't even want to
[57:54] see you anymore
[57:55] you can go out there with a bunch of
[57:56] crazy devil worshipers and soothsayers
[57:59] that's what they did
[58:03] the wikipedia says that uh he was sent
[58:06] out to the isle of patmos at the in the
[58:08] late 1st century by the roman emperor
[58:10] domitian
[58:15] and the bible said in roman revelation 1
[58:17] 9 he was sent to the aisle that's called
[58:19] patmos for the word of god and for the
[58:22] testimony of jesus christ amen
[58:26] church in other words any time you're
[58:27] isolated any time you're stranded
[58:29] anytime you're persecuted
[58:31] for your faith it is for a testimony to
[58:34] the word of god and the testimony of
[58:37] jesus christ
[58:39] counted all joy the bible says when you
[58:41] go through trials and tribulations and
[58:43] persecutions for your faith shall be
[58:45] made stronger your faith will become
[58:47] like gold hallelujah
[58:49] the trial of your faith is more precious
[58:51] than gold the bible says
[58:59] the roman authorities banish him to
[59:01] patmos
[59:03] this was the common punishment
[59:05] for a number of offenses such as
[59:08] practicing magic and astrology
[59:11] the romans viewed prophecy as belonging
[59:13] to the same category where whether pagan
[59:15] jewish or christian anyone who tried to
[59:18] prophesy
[59:20] and especially about political events in
[59:22] those days would be banished because the
[59:24] romans didn't want to hear the bad news
[59:26] that was coming their way
[59:28] right
[59:31] so the romans would perceive any
[59:33] negative word or negative prophecy
[59:35] against them as a political threat and
[59:37] so they would banish the men i don't
[59:39] know what john said maybe john said
[59:40] something about rome i don't know
[59:42] but they got so tired of this guy and
[59:44] his prophecies that they sent him to the
[59:46] isle of patmos said look we did the isle
[59:48] of patmos he didn't complain
[59:51] he didn't quit he didn't give up on god
[59:53] he loved jesus all the way to the end
[59:56] amen just like jesus loved him all the
[59:58] way to the end he loved jesus all the
[1:00:00] way to the end praise god
[1:00:03] while he was on that isle of patmos all
[1:00:05] isolated the bible said he got in the
[1:00:08] spirit on the lord's day
[1:00:10] i wonder if he played his favorite song
[1:00:13] when the spirit of the lord comes upon
[1:00:16] my heart i will dance like david i
[1:00:20] wonder what song it was praise god he
[1:00:22] got the stomping and praising the lord
[1:00:24] and all of a sudden he sees jesus in a
[1:00:25] vision and he falls down like he's dead
[1:00:27] he said he touches him and he gets up he
[1:00:30] said write this in a book and send it to
[1:00:32] the seven churches the seven cities
[1:00:34] which will be seven church ages amen
[1:00:37] hallelujah
[1:00:40] he could have quit out there he could
[1:00:41] have gave up he could have committed
[1:00:42] suicide but he said i'm just instead of
[1:00:45] getting the spirit of death i'm going to
[1:00:46] get in the spirit of life amen
[1:00:49] hallelujah praise god
[1:00:52] we always have a choice there's always a
[1:00:53] way
[1:00:55] death or life you choose
[1:00:59] and beat unto you according to your
[1:01:01] faith
[1:01:06] all right i got uh six minutes on my 45
[1:01:08] boy
[1:01:11] a little surprised here
[1:01:15] now you would think the man who's called
[1:01:18] the disciple of love
[1:01:19] you think he'd understand a little bit
[1:01:21] about god's love right
[1:01:23] and if you ever read the book of first
[1:01:24] john it's only five chapters brother
[1:01:26] sister
[1:01:27] it's full of the love of god as soon as
[1:01:30] i thought about this subject i went
[1:01:31] right to the first john it's so full now
[1:01:33] you don't need your bible but i'll have
[1:01:34] some of you help me read this here
[1:01:36] john at the end of his life had such a
[1:01:37] revelation
[1:01:42] all right
[1:01:42] so let's start looking at the love of
[1:01:44] god in this book
[1:01:46] uh
[1:01:46] let's have
[1:01:48] nature you want to read this for me can
[1:01:49] you read
[1:01:50] that do a read off here
[1:01:53] okay
[1:01:55] here bye
[1:02:19] in him verily
[1:02:26] perfected
[1:02:28] hereby
[1:02:39] so
[1:02:40] john says here's how we know
[1:02:43] him if we keep his commands people that
[1:02:46] don't keep jesus commands do not know
[1:02:48] him they think they know him but they
[1:02:49] don't right
[1:02:51] if a man says i know jesus and don't
[1:02:53] they don't obey the commandments they're
[1:02:55] liars and the truth is not in them
[1:02:58] but whoever keeps the word
[1:03:00] truly in him the love of god will be
[1:03:02] perfected he'll come to a more perfect
[1:03:04] state of being a christian
[1:03:06] he'll become a mature christian praise
[1:03:08] god
[1:03:11] and hereby know that we're in him
[1:03:13] because we keep the commands of god
[1:03:15] keeping the commands is essential
[1:03:18] he that saith he's in the light and
[1:03:20] hateth his brother is in darkness even
[1:03:21] now
[1:03:22] that's why we don't hate anybody we
[1:03:23] don't hate anybody
[1:03:25] we feel sorry for them we try to correct
[1:03:26] them but we don't hate anybody we love
[1:03:28] them he that loveth his brother abideth
[1:03:31] in the light and there's none occasion
[1:03:33] of stumbling in him so as long as it
[1:03:35] gets this as long as you're walking in
[1:03:37] love you're not going to cause anybody
[1:03:38] to stumble and you're not going to be
[1:03:39] stumbling
[1:03:41] see if you just walk in the love of
[1:03:42] christ every day my i love the lord i
[1:03:44] love his people i love my enemies if you
[1:03:46] just walk in love all day you're not
[1:03:47] going to cause anybody stumble
[1:03:50] because you're so full of care for other
[1:03:52] people you're so full of of looking
[1:03:54] outward that you don't let sin get
[1:03:56] caught inward amen amen
[1:03:58] good you're so busy spewing out
[1:04:00] blessings amen you don't let anything
[1:04:02] corrupt form in your heart praise god
[1:04:05] you're not taking any evil because all
[1:04:07] you're doing is pushing out god's love
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:10] hallelujah he that hates his brothers in
[1:04:13] darkness
[1:04:14] and walketh in darkness and knoweth not
[1:04:16] whether he goeth because the darkness
[1:04:18] has blinded his eyes
[1:04:20] so someone living in hatred don't even
[1:04:21] they don't even know where they're going
[1:04:22] in life
[1:04:24] but those who have the love of god they
[1:04:25] know exactly where they're going
[1:04:27] we're walking up the king's highway
[1:04:30] amen hallelujah praise god
[1:04:34] love not the world neither the things
[1:04:36] that are in the world if any man love
[1:04:37] the world the love of the father is not
[1:04:39] in him
[1:04:41] so this clearly proves someone who loves
[1:04:44] the things of the world is not born
[1:04:45] again
[1:04:46] it's impossible
[1:04:48] right you can't be born again and love
[1:04:49] the things of the world you have to have
[1:04:51] the things of the world but you do not
[1:04:52] love them
[1:04:54] right
[1:04:56] for all that's in the world the lust of
[1:04:58] the flesh things your flesh wants the
[1:04:59] lust of the eyes things your eyes once
[1:05:01] and the pride of life
[1:05:03] is not of the father but is of the world
[1:05:05] and the world passeth the way and the
[1:05:07] lust thereof but he that do it the will
[1:05:09] of god abideth forever
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:15] now look at this now we're getting to
[1:05:16] god's love what manner of love the
[1:05:18] father hath bestowed upon us or given to
[1:05:20] us
[1:05:21] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:05:23] the very fact you can be called
[1:05:26] a son or daughter of god shows a great
[1:05:28] amount of love was poured out upon you
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:33] john's like what manner of love is this
[1:05:35] amen that us sinners us men and women
[1:05:38] who walked after the flesh and lust of
[1:05:39] the eyes and lust of the mind could be
[1:05:41] caught quickened first made alive though
[1:05:44] we were dead and now love other people
[1:05:46] love our enemies and manifest christ
[1:05:48] what kind of love is this this could
[1:05:49] only be god's love
[1:05:53] what manner of love is this
[1:05:56] therefore the world doesn't even know us
[1:05:59] because it didn't know him
[1:06:02] beloved
[1:06:03] now not not tomorrow now where there's
[1:06:05] ever ever say now ready now now we're
[1:06:08] the sons of god
[1:06:10] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:06:11] be as far as our next bodies but we know
[1:06:14] that when he shall appear jesus we shall
[1:06:16] be like jesus for we shall see jesus as
[1:06:19] he is
[1:06:21] so whenever we see jesus we'll have a
[1:06:22] body just like his that means i'll live
[1:06:25] just as long as he does amen
[1:06:28] that means act just like him praise god
[1:06:31] hallelujah
[1:06:32] now look at this
[1:06:33] every man that has this hope what to see
[1:06:35] jesus
[1:06:37] in him
[1:06:38] purifies himself now that's where a lot
[1:06:40] of churches fall short they don't get
[1:06:42] more pure they get more
[1:06:44] sinful
[1:06:46] even as jesus is pure
[1:06:49] how many hoping to go to heaven
[1:06:51] how many above that how many hope to go
[1:06:53] in the rapture and skip death
[1:06:55] everyone that has this hope you will
[1:06:57] purify yourself you will work to say
[1:06:59] i've got to be more pure i've got to be
[1:07:01] more like christ i need more of the mind
[1:07:03] of christ tomorrow amen hallelujah
[1:07:06] that's what i need amen
[1:07:08] if you have a hope for heaven purify
[1:07:10] yourself so there's no doubt you'll get
[1:07:12] there praise god hallelujah there's my
[1:07:15] 45 so give me a few more minutes here
[1:07:17] i can never stop on time
[1:07:23] i think out later let me make a note i
[1:07:25] may stop right here and uh
[1:07:28] let's see what i got left here
[1:07:33] well i may preach one more sermon on
[1:07:35] this okay i'm making each one
[1:07:41] we'll see
[1:07:42] um
[1:07:43] let's do this let's finish uh john yeah
[1:07:46] let's finish john
[1:07:47] and then i'll stop because i want to go
[1:07:49] back to leah i had some more notes on
[1:07:50] leah i want to revisit that but we'll
[1:07:52] have to get to that later
[1:07:53] okay little children let no man deceive
[1:07:55] you he that does righteousness is
[1:07:58] righteous
[1:07:59] even as he's righteous
[1:08:02] he that commits sin is of the devil
[1:08:05] for the devil sins from the beginning
[1:08:07] for this purpose the son of god was
[1:08:08] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:08:10] works of the devil
[1:08:12] now here's a beautiful scripture church
[1:08:14] this is for your soul
[1:08:16] this is for your soul not your flesh and
[1:08:18] not your mind
[1:08:20] whosoever is born of god whoever is
[1:08:22] baptized with the holy ghost does not
[1:08:24] commit sin wait what
[1:08:27] what what what'd you say
[1:08:29] john the one who loves he knows god
[1:08:31] loves god god loves him he said if
[1:08:34] you're born of god you don't sin
[1:08:37] for his seed
[1:08:39] what's the seed the holy spirit's the
[1:08:40] seed
[1:08:41] his seed remains in him so in other
[1:08:44] words you were a sinner until you got a
[1:08:45] seed and now that seed is a new life in
[1:08:48] you it's producing a new life and that
[1:08:50] seed cannot sin amen
[1:08:52] if that seed cannot sin it must be a
[1:08:54] different kind of life it must be god's
[1:08:56] own life amen
[1:08:58] which is the holy ghost praise god
[1:09:02] he cannot sin because he's
[1:09:04] born of god
[1:09:07] so when a person gets the holy ghost in
[1:09:08] their soul god doesn't even see them sin
[1:09:11] in heaven
[1:09:13] right but on earth is he going to
[1:09:14] correct you absolutely he's going to
[1:09:16] correct you
[1:09:18] but in heaven you have the seed of god
[1:09:20] you pass from death and the life you're
[1:09:21] sealed away in the kingdom of god until
[1:09:23] the day of your redemption
[1:09:26] how's that youtube sounding is okay
[1:09:28] all right thank you hopefully it didn't
[1:09:29] cut us off
[1:09:31] people are hanging on to the end here to
[1:09:32] catch the ending here
[1:09:35] in this the children of god are
[1:09:36] manifested the children of devil
[1:09:38] whosoever does not righteousness is not
[1:09:40] of god neither he that loveth not his
[1:09:42] brother
[1:09:44] so anyone who does wicked acts and then
[1:09:46] doesn't love his brother they're not
[1:09:47] born of god
[1:09:48] very plain
[1:09:50] you think how many think this guy
[1:09:51] understood what he's talking about this
[1:09:53] is the disciple whom jesus loved
[1:09:56] now brother brother austin here's the
[1:09:57] balance this scripture says we don't sin
[1:10:00] right
[1:10:01] but then earlier in the in the book two
[1:10:03] chapters earlier john said if we say we
[1:10:05] have no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[1:10:07] truth is not in us
[1:10:09] so see
[1:10:10] we got to be very careful with this the
[1:10:12] same guy two chapters said
[1:10:14] and then he says if you say you've not
[1:10:16] sinned you make god a liar
[1:10:20] and his word is not in you
[1:10:22] but see if you confess here it is if you
[1:10:25] confess your sins he's faithful and just
[1:10:27] to forgive you of your sins and to
[1:10:29] cleanse you from all unrighteousness
[1:10:32] so let me say like this you've got three
[1:10:33] parts right your soul and once it's born
[1:10:35] again can never sin again
[1:10:38] but this mind will sin and this flesh
[1:10:40] will sin
[1:10:42] so never say i don't sin in the flesh
[1:10:44] and the mind but you can say my soul
[1:10:46] doesn't sin
[1:10:47] hallelujah praise god your soul has a
[1:10:50] seed if it's born again it has the seed
[1:10:52] of the holy spirit that seed can never
[1:10:54] sin
[1:10:56] praise god
[1:10:57] that's what the thus saith the bible
[1:10:58] says amen
[1:11:00] but your flesh will sin and your mind
[1:11:02] will think the wrong thoughts and act on
[1:11:03] them and say things wrong but your soul
[1:11:05] will never agree with that
[1:11:08] and here you are trying to handle three
[1:11:10] parts of your being
[1:11:12] you're just trying to i'm just trying to
[1:11:14] talk about all the needs around the
[1:11:15] world like india all these i'm just
[1:11:17] trying to handle this guy right here
[1:11:18] sometimes i feel like that
[1:11:20] sometimes i'm trying to try to handle my
[1:11:21] mind all these mind battles and this
[1:11:23] flesh
[1:11:27] a couple more here
[1:11:30] this is the message you've heard from
[1:11:32] the beginning that we should love one
[1:11:33] another so what's the message jesus been
[1:11:34] saying this whole time love each other
[1:11:38] love each other
[1:11:40] not as cain who's of that wicked one so
[1:11:41] here's cain was a serpent seed he was of
[1:11:43] the wicked one and he slew his brother
[1:11:45] abel wherefore he slew him because his
[1:11:47] own works were evil and his brother's
[1:11:49] righteous
[1:11:50] marvel not ye my brethren if the world
[1:11:52] hates you so don't be surprised that
[1:11:53] people hate you now that you're a
[1:11:54] christian
[1:11:56] we got a lot of those praise god
[1:12:02] all right let me stop there i'm going to
[1:12:04] put a note here let's stand to our feet
[1:12:05] musicians can come but i'm not quite
[1:12:08] done i just want you to stand here okay
[1:12:10] live streamers love you all god bless
[1:12:12] you i'm going to share our beautiful
[1:12:13] testimony here as we close here
[1:12:17] let me put a note here that has stopped
[1:12:19] so right there's 50 minutes i stopped at
[1:12:21] 50
