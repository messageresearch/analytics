[40:08] sure nice place the grace of God yes yes
[40:17] sir in our area Lord God do some very
[40:28] how'd I do you know I might am I just
[40:31] sing a song I heard some very wonderful
[40:32] song specials god bless each and every
[40:34] one of them I think I usually sing just
[40:37] a little song you get get the nerves out
[40:39] of the way and then we'll get right over
[40:42] to to where we feel led to go today men
[40:45] I think I must sing a song my time to
[40:51] the message if we get there try not to
[40:53] be tremendously long today
[40:55] but my try sing that song if I can we
[41:09] are climbing Jacob's Ladder we are
[41:15] climbing Jacob's letter we are climbing
[41:22] Jacob's Ladder we are climbing Jacob's
[41:32] Ladder soldiers uh-oh Oh every round
[41:43] goes higher and higher for every round
[41:50] goes higher and higher every round goes
[41:57] higher higher soldiers of the orange for
[42:08] every victory is sweeter and sweeter
[42:14] every victory it's sweeter and sweeter
[42:22] victory gets sweeter sweeter soldiers of
[42:29] the cross
[42:31] oh ha oh yes now sinner
[42:35] do you love my son
[43:15] [Applause]
[44:13] [Music]
[44:19] see if we can get this thing started up
[44:22] [Music]
[44:24] okay let's see if we can put this up
[44:26] here go to Revelation six five you have
[44:28] your Bibles there we go praise the
[44:37] Living God
[44:39] you know sometimes that don't go through
[44:41] so when it does go through just makes
[44:44] you wanna rejoice all the more just
[44:49] trying to limit down some sermons a
[44:51] pastor that church over Napoleon but by
[44:53] the grace of God you preach a lot of
[44:54] sermons you just try to find God's mind
[44:56] I believe this would be a great blessing
[44:57] to you cuz a brother sister or one thing
[44:59] about it all is that when you when you
[45:01] see that the message is so tied in with
[45:04] the Word of God but there's nothing like
[45:08] it
[45:08] we see people nowadays though they'll
[45:10] run out of the message amen and and and
[45:14] a lot of people look at a prophet they
[45:16] look at this though and then perhaps
[45:17] just look at a quote but you see they
[45:19] never come to a place that they realize
[45:21] that the message and the word all those
[45:24] go together just right amen
[45:26] so today we want to just kind of bring a
[45:28] thought to you maybe inspire you a
[45:29] little bit if God would allow and we'll
[45:31] see I'm an inspirational preacher I've
[45:33] had a brother say one time he said I
[45:35] heard you were a nervous emotional
[45:36] preacher and didn't know how to quite
[45:41] feel about that too hadn't run the quote
[45:43] yet but I found brother Branham one time
[45:45] say he was a nervous emotional preacher
[45:46] so I kind of felt good about that after
[45:49] that but anyway I we just take what the
[45:52] Lord will give us and we just try to
[45:54] just allow the Holy Spirit to speak to
[45:56] his bride Amen brother says to remember
[45:58] it was his blood that purchased you oh
[46:02] what a great Savior we have amen
[46:05] so here I preached 50 sermons at the
[46:08] home church on the on the on the seals
[46:10] and pertaining to those things and we're
[46:12] gonna try to Bunch maybe four sermons
[46:14] into one here and maybe we're just
[46:16] moving into tonight if we can but I
[46:18] believe will be a blessing to you in
[46:20] Revelation six five you have your Bibles
[46:22] here if not we got it up on the screen
[46:24] up here it says here it says when he had
[46:26] opened the third seal I heard the third
[46:28] beast say come and see and I beheld and
[46:34] lo a black horse and he that sat on him
[46:36] had a pair of balances in his hand
[46:41] remember who that rider was that old
[46:44] stinkin devil and they mem
[46:47] and I heard a voice in the midst of the
[46:50] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[46:54] penny and three measures of barley for a
[46:57] penny and see thou hurt not the oil and
[47:03] the wine all right so I want to bring
[47:07] our attention to this as we get ready to
[47:09] pray who is your all in all this morning
[47:11] who is the one in the middle of your
[47:13] experience today who is the one that's
[47:15] going to see you to this rapture it's
[47:18] the Lord Jesus Christ now isn't he
[47:20] amen so notice as your prophet brought
[47:23] this who was that voice I heard a voice
[47:26] in the midst of the four beasts in the
[47:29] midst means middle before beasts
[47:31] protecting that lamb amen so it was the
[47:36] lamb speaking to his little church there
[47:39] wasn't it amen let's bow our heads for a
[47:41] word of Prayer we'll get right into this
[47:42] our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ
[47:45] Saviour God friend everything to us Lord
[47:50] here we have Oh God knowing that Lord
[47:53] there's not one of us even worthy to be
[47:55] in this room Oh God we're the elect
[47:57] would be found but yet Lord God you had
[47:59] predestinated us from the foundation of
[48:01] the world you O God we heard your voice
[48:04] and Lord we come after that oh god you
[48:06] truest God thank you Lord for in this
[48:09] our Lord as we see the challenges of the
[48:12] hour raising up against the world
[48:14] against the church against all who call
[48:16] themselves by the name of Christ then
[48:18] Lord you've given us onward oh god that
[48:20] would prevail over anything that the
[48:22] devil could bring Lord we're trusting
[48:24] today Lord that as we've read this
[48:26] scripture you'd add your blessings to it
[48:28] Lord and/or not just that but Lord as we
[48:31] hear the word of God may Oh God that
[48:33] word just settle deep in our lives God
[48:36] bring forth a little change in our lives
[48:38] our perspectives Oh God as so many times
[48:41] we see ourselves bound up Oh God
[48:43] thinking that we don't have a chance or
[48:46] maybe maybe we were just sitting there
[48:48] beaten up and bruised gone but Lord we
[48:50] have a word today that is greater than
[48:53] any challenge that this world could
[48:55] bring us O God we pray O God put us in
[48:57] thy word put us in a place oh god that
[49:00] this word is a greater
[49:01] than anything that seats before so gone
[49:04] we believe that you'll do it Lord
[49:06] and we're asking Lord he is certainly
[49:07] inspired Lord maybe Oh God we believe it
[49:11] as we move ourselves out of the way they
[49:14] oh you would come in the midst of this
[49:16] assembly we know by the very promise of
[49:19] your word that we're two or more
[49:20] gathered you say there you will be Lord
[49:22] so we realize right now that you're here
[49:26] right amongst just little common people
[49:29] here you are
[49:30] we were should be so we love you we ask
[49:33] you to have your preeminent way today in
[49:35] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[49:37] church said together they may be seated
[49:40] you don't happen to have a lapel D
[49:50] brother
[49:51] [Music]
[49:54] let's keep one my hand still today we're
[49:58] going to minister a little message
[50:00] called an oil and wine experience and
[50:05] maybe we'll just reach reach recap just
[50:08] a few things we'll get right into this
[50:09] remember brother sister the opening of
[50:12] the seals made this a new book to you it
[50:16] was the opening of the seals that was
[50:17] that God would begin to unravel the
[50:20] fullness of who he was to his church
[50:22] right amen he would take all those
[50:24] things that the Reformers and all these
[50:26] other men of God had probed at and what
[50:28] he would bring it to a place that what
[50:30] the entire word would be open to the
[50:33] church right and they meant as we see
[50:35] that God would anoint these things to
[50:37] start breaking forth to the believer we
[50:39] understand that their prophet would
[50:41] spend a night after night after night
[50:43] breaking these seals by the power of the
[50:46] Holy Ghost
[50:46] to the church amen now those sermons
[50:49] were actually preached brother sister to
[50:51] revolutionize your experience amen they
[50:54] were actually to turn your walk from a
[50:56] place of being a probing experience into
[50:59] an experience that would actually have a
[51:01] life Amen for very life of Jesus Christ
[51:04] expressing from it Amen hallelujah that
[51:07] no matter where you attorne you would
[51:10] find until the consummation or coming of
[51:12] Christ that God would be right
[51:14] drawling you closer and closer to a word
[51:18] experience that would see this coming of
[51:20] the Lord in it hallelujah
[51:22] so now we want to take this little idea
[51:25] of course in the white horse that devil
[51:28] he came in so subtle and then what then
[51:30] very carefully and very quickly he began
[51:33] to dismantle that little that little
[51:36] Ephesus church now didn't hear right
[51:38] amen and then whoa then he annexed this
[51:40] Antichrist she'd begin another move and
[51:43] he would begin as a red horse and he
[51:45] begin to kill the true Church of the
[51:47] Living God right amen I know your
[51:50] pastors preach on these things so we
[51:51] don't want to go too much but you know
[51:54] it ain't a crime brother sister to go
[51:55] back and get into the archives of your
[51:57] pastor sermons right amen so maybe it'll
[52:00] help there a little bit - amen
[52:02] he's a real man of God amen so now
[52:04] notice here that that second horse rider
[52:07] he would begin watch through them the
[52:09] move of Catholicism in the false word he
[52:12] began to destroy the true trail children
[52:14] of God right and little by little what
[52:17] that true church would be coming to a
[52:20] death right under you get all the way in
[52:23] the fourth seal there and you'd find
[52:25] that one yes was sitting in it with a
[52:27] pale horse but right before we see in
[52:30] that fourth church age the church coming
[52:32] to a nine hundred years of death right
[52:35] we would find that God he only did it so
[52:38] he could show a jet burial and a
[52:41] resurrection to the church right
[52:44] hallelujah so we see that here in the
[52:47] third seal that what we see that what
[52:49] God would allow this black horse rider
[52:52] bringing spiritual death he'd be selling
[52:54] endorses and pendants and all these
[52:56] things like that and what you'd begin to
[52:59] what bring an end to the sons of God
[53:04] killing them off remember what makes
[53:07] this so amazing brother sister they
[53:10] didn't even have the Word of God the
[53:15] Bible had been wanted moved by
[53:18] Catholicism into Jerome's Latin Vulgate
[53:21] a dead language
[53:25] they put the Bible in a dead language so
[53:29] that the common people couldn't even
[53:31] read the Word of God brother sister of
[53:33] that alone or to inspire us this morning
[53:37] hallelujah as we get our Bibles and we
[53:40] wipe off the the six day seven day dust
[53:43] you'll next Sunday service Omaha those
[53:47] people long for the Word of God
[53:50] hallelujah and they couldn't get it
[53:53] right because they've been brought into
[53:55] the dead movement of Catholicism but
[53:58] what we see that in the midst of that
[54:01] remember the promises at for Church ages
[54:03] that said that what it would be greater
[54:05] the works would be greater at the last
[54:07] and in the first OMA and we see what
[54:12] would begin to go on now I'm going to
[54:14] tie this in with a Bible by God's grace
[54:16] if we can I want us to tie that right
[54:18] back in in Revelation six it's now
[54:20] notice here that it was God's
[54:22] commandment here though that black horse
[54:25] rider would ride God restrained him you
[54:31] can't kill my children now I want you to
[54:37] think about this because brother sister
[54:40] there has never been a time in the
[54:43] Gentile dispensation that the church has
[54:46] been left without the oil and the line
[54:50] you know why it's not me that stopped
[54:53] it's not him after any of you that stop
[54:55] it it was Jesus Christ himself and when
[55:00] Satan tried to take it away Jesus Christ
[55:05] said oh no you don't
[55:08] there was a voice in the midst of the
[55:11] force four beasts that said a measure of
[55:13] wheat for a penny of three measures of
[55:15] barley for a penny and see thou hurt not
[55:18] the oil and the line it is been God's
[55:23] covenant to his charge Amen that they do
[55:26] not have to live in experience without
[55:30] the oil and law Satan tries to trick you
[55:33] he tries to keep you from it but brother
[55:36] sister if you
[55:38] watch this then you can have it I guess
[55:43] we better get in and define these things
[55:45] a little bit to see how important this
[55:47] really is to us now we know I'm not
[55:50] going to spend a lot of time here
[55:51] because we all know what the oil is
[55:53] right but the oil is what the oil is a
[55:56] type of the Holy Ghost Satan has never
[56:00] been allowed to touch your Holy Ghost
[56:03] remember your prophet said he can never
[56:06] go in there if he did he'd be called
[56:08] your brother
[56:09] he can't go into the place not his place
[56:13] you neither Kenny hinder the oil from
[56:18] being at the prominent position of your
[56:20] experience hallelujah
[56:23] isn't that something brother sister we
[56:25] don't have to sit here in this lay back
[56:27] and say all I wish I had it I wish I
[56:29] could have it remember Jesus told that
[56:32] devil see thou hurt not so the only
[56:38] thing you can come and do is come and
[56:40] Bluff you hallelujah brother sister
[56:45] that's what he'll do he'll let you come
[56:47] to the message I'll let you put on a
[56:49] skirt and you'll sit there and while
[56:51] you'll say okay it's illegal ISM and
[56:55] watch you'll start only judging your
[56:58] experience by the length of your skirt
[57:02] brother sister that's where the bible
[57:05] says they he is in the spirit is not in
[57:07] the law it's not a license to sin but it
[57:13] wants to point to you that watch that
[57:16] the experience of the Holy Ghost it
[57:18] places the word inside you that's the
[57:24] difference we're not legal if I thought
[57:27] about preaching ever this morning
[57:28] brother sister but there's so many of us
[57:30] we are actually you'll receive the Holy
[57:33] Ghost and then Satan will try to bring
[57:35] you right back to sanctification when we
[57:42] understand the scripture it tells us
[57:45] that the Holy Ghost was to set you to
[57:47] service
[57:50] we got the Holy Ghost brother sister
[57:52] it's time to serve God it's time to get
[57:57] a little boldness in you because you
[57:59] know you've received something amen
[58:01] you've caught something that is taking
[58:05] you from carnality and it's placed you
[58:07] into a desire for the word itself oh ma
[58:12] now this is where we really lose
[58:15] connection especially in this day
[58:17] because we realize that that the idea of
[58:20] Pentecostalism is so despised even in
[58:23] the message and I don't want to take it
[58:24] too far
[58:25] I wanna tell you right in the balance
[58:27] that God has it they meant now I want
[58:30] you to see so what Satan can't touch
[58:33] your Holy Ghost but I told you I want to
[58:35] take this back to the word because if
[58:37] you see how important this is to your
[58:38] experience then you'll begin to really
[58:41] say Oh God
[58:42] what is your worship that you desire of
[58:44] me now look at this in the fourth seal
[58:49] what I love about the seals is you can't
[58:51] just listen to the third seal and get
[58:52] the third seal you got to go to the
[58:55] fourth seal sometimes you got taken you
[58:58] dig down they'll say something about in
[59:00] the seventh seal hallelujah that's
[59:03] alright because we're a full book bride
[59:05] amen and we're a full message bride we
[59:09] don't just say well that's before the
[59:10] seals I don't have to follow that but we
[59:14] can look at the whole message and live
[59:17] under the progressive revelation of it
[59:19] amen now notice what your prophet says
[59:22] here he says now now the power of notice
[59:26] here I want to touch one he says now now
[59:28] the power of revelation brings
[59:30] stimulation to the believer for the
[59:33] power of wine natural wine is to
[59:35] stimulate hurt not the oil in the line
[59:41] brother sister we can be sitting here
[59:44] right now with all the ghosts but did
[59:47] you know that Jesus Christ didn't tell
[59:49] saying hurt not the oil and stop right
[59:52] there he said hurt not the oil and the
[59:57] line brother sister if you can catch him
[1:00:00] in a line today I'm not saying you're
[1:00:01] gonna jump
[1:00:02] move around ah but I'm telling you you
[1:00:04] at least put a smile on your face
[1:00:05] because the word was made to stimulate
[1:00:10] you hallelujah some of us we drink a
[1:00:14] little coffee in the morning and you get
[1:00:16] to a place I just like that coffee but
[1:00:19] you'll find out that you're like college
[1:00:21] stimulates you a little bit it takes you
[1:00:24] from a place you kind of feel a beat up
[1:00:26] in the morning I know I'm probably the
[1:00:28] only morning person here the good
[1:00:31] morning starts about 10 o'clock it's
[1:00:36] been a real long time since I've been
[1:00:37] there
[1:00:38] but anyway notice here it says see it's
[1:00:42] to bring a person that's all slum down
[1:00:46] to us stimulation when we come into the
[1:00:50] house of God brother sister you come in
[1:00:53] out in the house of God without a smile
[1:00:55] you're broken up you're maybe having
[1:00:57] some trials in life when you come and
[1:01:00] hear the word of God it is actually
[1:01:02] supposed to take you from that condition
[1:01:04] and place you into a spot that you are
[1:01:08] now back in the joy of God the word and
[1:01:14] the gathering of the church is to take
[1:01:17] away the slump in the bride you know a
[1:01:22] God could do in this building today if
[1:01:24] we leave a slump today it would put it
[1:01:28] so all things are possible right here
[1:01:33] hallelujah so now notice it says well
[1:01:35] then now there's a power of the
[1:01:37] revelation of the word give stimulation
[1:01:41] of joy to the believer stimulation of
[1:01:46] satisfaction the stimulation that it's
[1:01:50] vindicated it's proved it's called in
[1:01:56] the scripture as we want to refer to it
[1:01:58] as new why we always refer to it like
[1:02:04] that as these are drunk on new on
[1:02:06] alright on spiritual wine I think the
[1:02:10] best interpretation would be on
[1:02:13] spiritual Wow so
[1:02:16] Jesus Christ he never wanted the
[1:02:21] victory to leave your experience you
[1:02:24] know when you feel a little victory you
[1:02:26] can't get a little happy
[1:02:27] you see God move on one year request you
[1:02:30] start getting a little happy hallelujah
[1:02:34] we're doing a a Bible study a couple of
[1:02:37] about four or five months ago and a
[1:02:39] sister she had got a lump on herself and
[1:02:42] and we were doing a Bible study her
[1:02:45] husband had prayed for those still there
[1:02:46] and then on a Sunday night we had a
[1:02:48] little Bible say I felt late I said
[1:02:49] let's go healing and I started giving a
[1:02:51] healing Bible study I felt the Lord all
[1:02:53] over I didn't know why but it felt good
[1:02:57] and subtle Wednesday I had that sister
[1:03:00] come up she says I don't know if it was
[1:03:02] if it was my husband or then the
[1:03:04] scripture coming for but she said I came
[1:03:07] to a place on Tuesday was gone it
[1:03:12] disappeared in there it was Jesus Christ
[1:03:36] all the way eternity he is the same type
[1:03:40] of God amen so this is where we begin to
[1:03:47] look because I want you to see brother
[1:03:50] sister we should be a very stimulated
[1:03:53] people but it's not a very stimulating
[1:03:56] hour every brother I talk to you church
[1:04:01] attendance is down everywhere I see in
[1:04:06] the midst of my own church people once
[1:04:13] stood so strong now we don't even have
[1:04:16] enough power to even make it to church I
[1:04:20] got a sermon for it it's coming let me
[1:04:23] say not here nope right not here
[1:04:25] but there should be something that's so
[1:04:28] strengthens the believer hallelujah
[1:04:31] brother sister we should be in a place
[1:04:34] that we are so in love with Christ we
[1:04:36] can't wait for the church doors open
[1:04:39] that's not me making it up that's a
[1:04:41] quote from the messenger of this hour
[1:04:43] even because we get a victory here but a
[1:04:47] lot of times we miss the fact of what
[1:04:49] this is this is a place to come and get
[1:04:51] gassed up this is a place to come get
[1:04:54] refueled you're here right now not
[1:04:57] through a religious service you're here
[1:05:00] because he's here you're here because
[1:05:03] you believe he's here to work on you to
[1:05:07] change you to raise you up to watch a
[1:05:10] bring some satisfaction to your walk
[1:05:13] amen and you'll do it right through the
[1:05:15] foolishness of preaching home ah
[1:05:22] something I love it cuz Paul call the
[1:05:25] foolishness of preaching but that's so
[1:05:27] many times what we allow it to be oh
[1:05:30] it's just a foolish little thing when
[1:05:33] brothers sister it's the very way God
[1:05:34] ordained to speak to us
[1:05:36] ohana our main portion now I'm gonna
[1:05:41] deal with wine for just a little bit and
[1:05:43] so this in here because a lot of times
[1:05:45] we like to stay away from this the Bible
[1:05:48] says about line in judges 913 it says in
[1:05:51] the vine said unto them should I leave
[1:05:54] my one which cheer if God and man and go
[1:05:59] to be promoted over the trees just a
[1:06:01] little statement on line but notice that
[1:06:04] grow that wine itself it cheers up God
[1:06:07] and men you wonder why you're not so
[1:06:10] happy it might not be the oil you might
[1:06:14] have the Holy Ghost but what you've
[1:06:16] allowed Satan to take your line you've
[1:06:20] got some wine in your experience it's
[1:06:23] going to turn your own brother sister oh
[1:06:25] no you hear because God ordained it to
[1:06:29] cheer you up
[1:06:30] now I want you to notice this it's not
[1:06:33] just for your chair but it's something
[1:06:35] that cheers God
[1:06:38] how could that be how could something
[1:06:41] natural be that way oh I'm glad you
[1:06:44] asked brother sister we're gonna get to
[1:06:46] it
[1:06:47] notice again in Isaiah 65 verse a it
[1:06:51] says thus saith the Lord as the new line
[1:06:55] is found in the cluster and one sayeth
[1:06:59] destroy it not for a blessing is in it
[1:07:06] so I do for my servants sake that I may
[1:07:09] not destroy them all so notice when the
[1:07:14] grape is turning and is becoming one the
[1:07:18] idea will find in the scripture if
[1:07:21] someone says destroy it a little too
[1:07:28] happy you look a little bit too excited
[1:07:31] for the Lord Jesus Christ but that's not
[1:07:34] what the Lord said
[1:07:35] but words that destroy it not for
[1:07:38] there's a blessing with it a blessing
[1:07:42] with the line Oh hallelujah
[1:07:45] you know if the Bible says brother
[1:07:46] sister it says in Ephesians I believe it
[1:07:48] says it says be not filled with wine
[1:07:50] wherein a success but be filled with the
[1:07:53] Holy Ghost
[1:07:54] hallelujah we're not looking at taverns
[1:07:56] and and wine sections because brother
[1:07:58] sister that is only an impersonation of
[1:08:01] the real thing amen and I'll tell you
[1:08:04] what if those people can get to a place
[1:08:06] where they give them nicknames like wino
[1:08:08] and drunks because what it's the only
[1:08:11] thing that satisfies them and what
[1:08:13] that's all they can do is cling to the
[1:08:16] impersonation then what about the
[1:08:19] believer to the truth emulation of this
[1:08:22] word oh my I'm Tony brother sister I'm
[1:08:27] this a type of preacher help that's all
[1:08:28] right I started getting a little
[1:08:29] stimulating myself and I start getting
[1:08:31] happy I hope that's all right hallelujah
[1:08:34] and I'll tell you on if you start
[1:08:36] feeling that that the line isn't just up
[1:08:38] here and it's starting to move around
[1:08:40] it'll give you a little cheer today
[1:08:42] it'll give you a little blessing today
[1:08:44] because brother sister it is not a joke
[1:08:47] that he's here it is the altar
[1:08:51] truth that we're living in right now my
[1:08:56] god never done left me he left Jesus
[1:09:02] Christ at the cross took the Holy Ghost
[1:09:05] away so then when it could come down to
[1:09:07] you he say I'll never leave thee nor
[1:09:09] forsake thee you might feel lonely
[1:09:13] little bit sometimes but brother sister
[1:09:15] draw nigh unto Him and He will draw nigh
[1:09:18] to you oh ma let's continue with this
[1:09:24] getting ready to make a little turn it's
[1:09:27] good
[1:09:28] so it's 104 15 now it says here it says
[1:09:33] in wine that maketh glad the heart of
[1:09:36] man you see this look at naturally how
[1:09:41] much that the scripture says this place
[1:09:44] into your experience notice happy joyful
[1:09:48] happy so the line will make your heart
[1:09:54] glad and oil to make his face shine that
[1:10:01] Holy Ghost make your shine right up and
[1:10:03] you'll find it it's not shined up you
[1:10:04] got a smile on your face which
[1:10:09] strengtheneth man's heart now the
[1:10:12] connection today we're only making with
[1:10:15] oil and wine because of the seals but
[1:10:18] I'll tell you what brother sister you're
[1:10:19] going to find out that it's always bread
[1:10:22] oil and wine and there's a purpose for
[1:10:26] that bread the word oil the Holy Spirit
[1:10:31] and wine the stimulation that goes to
[1:10:34] the believer this is beautiful brother
[1:10:39] sister I hope we can connect let's see
[1:10:42] now if there is a connection in question
[1:10:46] answers on the Selah 103 assist wine is
[1:10:48] the end oil is connected together in the
[1:10:53] Bible in worship now this is going to
[1:10:59] turn this completely in your face now
[1:11:01] and for me it's
[1:11:03] second time it feels good notices oh if
[1:11:10] I would only stayed in the third seal I
[1:11:11] never would have found that but here the
[1:11:15] profit and moved on the Holy Ghost he
[1:11:18] speaks and says that oil and wine is
[1:11:20] connected together in Bible for worship
[1:11:24] so notice this as we get ready to read
[1:11:27] this when Jesus Christ said see thou
[1:11:32] hurt not the oil in line
[1:11:35] why was he saying that because oil and
[1:11:40] wine is directly connected to your
[1:11:43] worship I hope you're feeling all right
[1:11:54] Mary prophet he started preaching it you
[1:11:57] start getting all excited whoa that
[1:12:01] wasn't just 50 years ago brother sister
[1:12:03] that's he still does that he still does
[1:12:06] it I preached on Wednesday night on
[1:12:08] 144,000 brothers sister I have the Holy
[1:12:10] Ghost on me a half hour after service
[1:12:14] it's one of those feelings you couldn't
[1:12:16] get away from I like those I treasure
[1:12:18] those because I have plenty of
[1:12:20] experiences where that's not there and
[1:12:24] if God would choose to just rest on me a
[1:12:27] little bit I'll sit there and soak it
[1:12:29] all up in peace joy and happiness amen
[1:12:32] so notice here it says see and the line
[1:12:35] as we put that's where I got the idea of
[1:12:38] stimulation wine stimulates and wine is
[1:12:41] the anti-type of its natural from
[1:12:44] stimulation is a revelation
[1:12:48] what is one the stimulation of
[1:12:50] Revelation we hear the word of God it
[1:12:53] stimulates us by the revelation I'm
[1:12:56] gonna tell you if you're a Bible
[1:12:57] believer you love when the word opens up
[1:12:59] you absolutely love it amen
[1:13:01] now notice she says now just think what
[1:13:05] stimulates the church revelations
[1:13:09] you say you see what it is we don't just
[1:13:12] shout - shout we don't just dance the
[1:13:14] dance we don't just raise our hands to
[1:13:16] raise our hands but it's actually
[1:13:18] because we love him and we're stimulated
[1:13:21] by him the revealing or opening up he
[1:13:32] says now watch the oil and wine went
[1:13:35] together in sacrifice when together in
[1:13:38] church worship assembled together
[1:13:41] connected together alright
[1:13:44] now notice this as begin to move the
[1:13:46] idea here is that what wine and oil are
[1:13:49] connected perfectly to worship in this
[1:13:51] body hallelujah and what they go
[1:13:55] together in sacrifice and when we
[1:13:58] assemble together see why it becomes
[1:14:04] important because the oil wine is for
[1:14:08] you when you leave each other and the
[1:14:10] oil wine is when you come together let's
[1:14:19] go now in our Bibles we're going to run
[1:14:21] through the scriptures now run right
[1:14:22] with me if you can if not just stay
[1:14:24] right up here now notice what God does
[1:14:28] very early on in Israel here in
[1:14:30] Deuteronomy 7 13 now notice he commands
[1:14:34] his blessings upon them and it says and
[1:14:37] he will love thee and blessed me and
[1:14:41] multiply thee
[1:14:42] he will also bless the fruit of thy womb
[1:14:45] and the fruit of Island come like warm
[1:14:51] valois 9 oil the increase of thy con the
[1:14:56] flax of thy sheep in the land which he
[1:14:58] sware unto thy father's to give one of
[1:15:03] God's proof for his love to his church
[1:15:06] was that he would bless them and we see
[1:15:12] here as you read up there in the yellow
[1:15:13] it says that what he would give them
[1:15:16] proving his love to them he would give
[1:15:19] them oil and one and once again of
[1:15:22] course you see corn
[1:15:23] dude around me 11:14 it says here in
[1:15:33] Deuteronomy 11 14 it says then I will
[1:15:35] give you the ray of your land in his due
[1:15:39] season the first rain and the latter
[1:15:43] rain that thou mayst gather in thy corn
[1:15:48] and thou lie and thine oil so what God's
[1:15:53] blessing to his people was to fully
[1:15:57] provide for them in the natural and
[1:16:00] notice God in His ideas and in his
[1:16:03] predestined word written from the
[1:16:05] foundation of the world ordained wine
[1:16:08] and oil to be part of the blessings
[1:16:12] alright we'll try to go through this
[1:16:15] part quick notice in Joel 2 19 it says
[1:16:17] yea and the Lord will answer and say
[1:16:20] unto his people behold I will send you
[1:16:22] corn and wine and oil and ye shall be
[1:16:25] satisfied there with God says I'm gonna
[1:16:29] give you enough to make you satisfied
[1:16:32] brother sister we should be satisfied in
[1:16:35] our experience of Christ amen
[1:16:38] we should be satisfied so much that it
[1:16:40] should make us one more Joe 223 says be
[1:16:49] glad then he children of Zion rejoice in
[1:16:52] the Lord your God for he has given you
[1:16:53] the former rain and moderately and he'll
[1:16:55] cause to come down for the rain the
[1:16:57] former and latter rain in the first
[1:16:59] month and the floor shall be full of
[1:17:01] wheat corn and the fat shall overflow
[1:17:05] with wine and oil
[1:17:07] this is prophetic brother sister and I
[1:17:10] will restore to you the years that the
[1:17:14] locust has eaten the canker and the
[1:17:16] caterpillar and the Palmer my great army
[1:17:19] which I sent among you and ye shall eat
[1:17:22] in plenty as far as the all-in-one and
[1:17:29] corn is concerned we are a plentiful
[1:17:32] Church
[1:17:34] he promised not just in that hour but in
[1:17:37] this hour we would be satisfied
[1:17:44] hallelujah that's why brother sister you
[1:17:47] see we ain't P warmers around here we
[1:17:51] are participate in bringing the word
[1:17:53] forth amen hallelujah no preacher can do
[1:17:58] it by himself but it takes the entire
[1:18:02] body of Jesus Christ getting into a
[1:18:05] place yes Lord
[1:18:06] come Lord dwell here move on my request
[1:18:10] God I've got family members god I've got
[1:18:12] friends but I want to see this prosper
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:17] ma just take it a little bit farther now
[1:18:23] Deuteronomy 14 22 it says here that thou
[1:18:29] shall truly tithe all the increase of
[1:18:33] thy seed that the field bringeth forth
[1:18:36] year by year
[1:18:38] now we're talking about tithing and thou
[1:18:41] shalt eat before the LORD thy God in the
[1:18:45] place where she shall choose to place
[1:18:47] his name there the tithe of thy corn in
[1:18:49] the line and then oil and the first
[1:18:51] things of the hers and of the flocks
[1:18:53] that thou mayst learn to fear the Lord
[1:18:55] thy God always goddess didn't make you
[1:19:01] so that it's just you that has the corn
[1:19:03] and all and wine but he made it so he
[1:19:05] would give you enough so you could get
[1:19:07] it right back come on we said Oh God
[1:19:14] I've just got enough to make it another
[1:19:16] day when the Word of God says it brother
[1:19:20] sister in the Old Testament remember the
[1:19:23] old is only a shadow of the new we are
[1:19:27] living below our privileges brother
[1:19:29] sister because he has promised that we
[1:19:32] can have a moon now let's continue we're
[1:19:42] gonna get ready to turn this a little
[1:19:43] bit here
[1:19:45] I want you to see what your prophets say
[1:19:49] he said it's kind of connected with
[1:19:51] worship Testament God would want so they
[1:19:56] could tithe
[1:19:57] just so they were tired well I can't pay
[1:20:01] my house maybe you're lacking a little
[1:20:04] corn oil online he promised he would
[1:20:10] supply me nothing you got to do he
[1:20:14] promised he would supply hold him to his
[1:20:17] word now remember he said he would cut
[1:20:20] it off if you didn't serve Exodus 29 38
[1:20:28] now notice here it says and now this is
[1:20:31] that which thou shalt offer upon the
[1:20:33] altar two lands of the first year
[1:20:36] day-by-day continually the one lamb bow
[1:20:38] shall offer in the morning other land
[1:20:40] thou shall offer at evening now notice
[1:20:44] this a lamb in the morning a lamb in the
[1:20:47] evening it's a daily sacrifice God looks
[1:20:51] for this was the law that he provided
[1:20:54] for his children no ma and with the one
[1:21:00] lamb a tenth deal of flour with the
[1:21:03] fourth part of a hint of bean oil and
[1:21:06] the fourth part of a hint of wine for a
[1:21:09] drink offering and the other land thou
[1:21:13] shalt offer an evening and shalt do
[1:21:15] thereto according to the meat offering
[1:21:17] of the morning and according to drink
[1:21:19] offering thereof for a sweet savour and
[1:21:21] offering made by fire unto the Lord when
[1:21:24] God set forth Israel now notice God
[1:21:27] would bless them with corn oil and wine
[1:21:31] but notice these things were things that
[1:21:36] would cheer up not just man but God and
[1:21:41] God says if you want to please me he
[1:21:44] says give me a meat offering and a drink
[1:21:47] offering in the morning and in the night
[1:21:51] we don't just praise him oh god I prayed
[1:21:53] in the morning I gave you a little bit
[1:21:54] of love as good enough but we see that
[1:21:58] watch that that oil and wine it would be
[1:22:01] part of your daily sacrifice notice
[1:22:04] God's desire was for his church to be
[1:22:08] able to give him all in line every day
[1:22:13] this was the worship that he was looking
[1:22:17] for you got daily to that land amen
[1:22:22] then tell you what you give me a mean
[1:22:25] offering and a drink offering show me
[1:22:27] that you love me think about that now I
[1:22:38] want to show you something here Israel
[1:22:42] in their happy moments and their good
[1:22:45] times we see that they just be and they
[1:22:50] weren't in captivity and so forth but
[1:22:51] they be giving this sacrifice every day
[1:22:55] daily the blessings would come but then
[1:22:57] every time we see in the scripture they
[1:22:58] begin to what work with idols they begin
[1:23:02] to a lot to lose faith in God and well
[1:23:05] then we find that they would actually
[1:23:06] become a conquered people and no longer
[1:23:09] were they able to do their sacrifices no
[1:23:12] longer were they able to please God now
[1:23:15] I want you to see that how this is going
[1:23:18] to tie in with your life here as this is
[1:23:20] just something it really was a blessing
[1:23:22] to me and Deuteronomy 28 47 he says
[1:23:30] because thou service not the LORD thy
[1:23:34] God with joyfulness and with gladness of
[1:23:39] heart notice for the abundance of all
[1:23:44] things because notice because they
[1:23:53] weren't serving God and happiness
[1:23:56] because they weren't glad for all the
[1:23:59] blessings that God put in their lives
[1:24:00] isn't that something brother sister in
[1:24:03] the
[1:24:03] and of Laodicea we want more but are
[1:24:07] never satisfied only we've get this
[1:24:11] right they say they say a person's got
[1:24:13] four acres was he wanted he wants more
[1:24:15] land a person has got a decent call what
[1:24:18] does he want he was a nicer car a person
[1:24:20] that makes this much money or an hour
[1:24:21] when he finds out he can do that oh I
[1:24:23] want more money an hour we're never
[1:24:26] satisfied with what God gives us and
[1:24:28] we'll see someone that's got maybe a
[1:24:30] better job or whatever and then we'll
[1:24:32] start getting down on our experiment
[1:24:35] it's not a blessed Christian and what
[1:24:39] you want you base your experience oh
[1:24:41] look at that pastor he can get anointed
[1:24:45] and what you start losing your
[1:24:49] thankfulness for all the things God does
[1:24:52] you start losing your joy of your
[1:24:54] experience you know I think about this
[1:24:56] brother sister because I feel like I am
[1:24:58] constantly preaching and I know it's
[1:25:02] hard because I find it myself to people
[1:25:04] we sit here it's just so hard for us to
[1:25:06] get a smile on her face you know in my
[1:25:11] church I'll sing I'm so happy
[1:25:15] oh I'm so happy and I start saying I
[1:25:18] start smiling and everyone right when I
[1:25:22] sing that I usually sing for a reason
[1:25:23] cuz everybody's like wait a minute
[1:25:29] you're talking that Jesus Christ is
[1:25:30] preaching to you and alls you can do it
[1:25:33] or it's time to worship your God all you
[1:25:36] do so I start seeing
[1:25:45] so happy all of a sudden everybody's
[1:25:47] like hey baby
[1:25:50] it's like a brightening happens just in
[1:25:51] the song then we get done I feel have
[1:25:54] you don't ya that's like some Saul ways
[1:25:58] some sort of momentary satisfaction and
[1:26:00] then and then just after a few minutes
[1:26:03] everybody's just back down can I get a
[1:26:06] Amen thank you and my church they say
[1:26:11] how about mourn one come on now adore to
[1:26:14] God and then they all get excited I say
[1:26:16] praise Lord cuz that's what it is if I'm
[1:26:19] not preaching I realized the challenge
[1:26:20] in the in the landscape
[1:26:22] cuz satan is constantly ruling over
[1:26:24] trying to find us we've got to make it
[1:26:27] to a place brother sister that satan is
[1:26:29] not welcome in this room we have come to
[1:26:34] glorify Christ we have come to make him
[1:26:37] known we have come so a lot so that when
[1:26:39] souls come they can find the same joy
[1:26:41] peace and happiness that Jesus Christ
[1:26:44] has given us so notice what he does
[1:26:49] because they won't serve him happily Oh
[1:26:51] with joy therefore thou shalt shalt thou
[1:26:56] serve thine enemies which the Lord shall
[1:26:59] send against thee in hunger and thirst
[1:27:01] and a nakedness and one of all things
[1:27:03] just because you weren't happy to serve
[1:27:05] God well that's the Old Testament oh no
[1:27:07] it's not why do you think in the New
[1:27:09] Testament finally ringing you hear
[1:27:11] ringing Thanksgiving you're ringing joy
[1:27:18] the old is the new brother sister the
[1:27:21] new is in the old it's what it is I'm
[1:27:24] the Lord I changed not notice because
[1:27:28] they wouldn't serve God happy he give
[1:27:34] him hunger and thirst and nakedness in
[1:27:36] one of all things and he shall put a
[1:27:38] yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have
[1:27:42] destroyed thee now notice where this
[1:27:45] goes
[1:27:45] the Lord shall bring a nation against
[1:27:47] thee from far and from the end of the
[1:27:48] earth to Swift as the Eagle fly I
[1:27:50] thought we were supposed to be the
[1:27:51] Eagles flying will hear the seals all
[1:27:54] glory to God oh you know it says in
[1:27:55] Revelation there's a flying eagle
[1:27:57] hallelujah bunch of sad flying eagles
[1:28:02] we're not just feeted brothers sister
[1:28:05] you can change just go to the cross I
[1:28:09] can change but it just doesn't have to
[1:28:11] be a smile on Sunday or a smile after
[1:28:14] service we can change we control the
[1:28:17] atmosphere your prophet said we were
[1:28:19] masters of every circumstance so what we
[1:28:25] do he'd send the nation after my nation
[1:28:27] 50th verse of fierce constants which
[1:28:30] shall not regard the person of the oil
[1:28:32] nor shoo-shoo favor to the young and he
[1:28:34] shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and
[1:28:35] the fruit of thy land which until thou
[1:28:37] be destroyed notice so what does he do
[1:28:40] he's cutting off the blessings which
[1:28:43] also shall not leave thee either corn
[1:28:45] wine or oil notice what was the corner
[1:28:52] on line it was the very worship they had
[1:28:57] to God their worship would be destroyed
[1:29:01] before God I'm not just a preacher I'm a
[1:29:15] partaker hallelujah the oldest or the
[1:29:19] increase of like I and the flocks of
[1:29:20] sheep until he have destroyed thee just
[1:29:27] cuz you're not thankful for the things
[1:29:30] God gives you you'll sit there dead in
[1:29:34] the church see my smile for me please
[1:29:42] thank you cuz but notice it's the same
[1:29:50] thing I can read all this but I want to
[1:29:53] show you he says the same thing because
[1:29:56] that serves not the LORD thy God with
[1:29:58] joyfulness of gladness of heart for the
[1:29:59] abundance of all things
[1:30:00] therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies
[1:30:02] he repeats it
[1:30:08] at how this begins to turn on him
[1:30:12] Joel 1:8 he says lament like a virgin
[1:30:18] girded with sackcloth for the husband of
[1:30:21] her youth the meat offering and the
[1:30:25] drink offering is cut off from the house
[1:30:29] of the Lord the priest the most
[1:30:33] ministers mourn the field is wasted the
[1:30:38] land mourneth for the corners wasted
[1:30:41] though new wine is dried up in the oil
[1:30:43] languages their backslidings took them
[1:30:52] so far from God yes that he cut the very
[1:30:57] daily sacrifice of pleasing them and the
[1:31:01] priesthood could do nothing but sit
[1:31:04] there and more oh come on now ye are
[1:31:08] priests and kings what's the house of
[1:31:12] God as a joy to come up to the house of
[1:31:16] God as now your assembly been turned
[1:31:19] over and you find that all that lies in
[1:31:23] the house of God it's a house of
[1:31:25] mourning there's no joy in the house of
[1:31:29] God hardly a joy to come into the house
[1:31:32] of God and what was it just because we
[1:31:38] weren't happy with living in America we
[1:31:43] have so many blessings brother sister
[1:31:48] what the whole crop would waste over and
[1:31:53] it would cut off their very worship to
[1:31:55] God I'm gonna jump times sake started
[1:32:02] real late try not to end late notice
[1:32:05] cheer I want you to see this I got a few
[1:32:07] of these I want to run to you because we
[1:32:10] need to see these things perhaps you've
[1:32:11] heard them I pray the recap will be a
[1:32:13] little good for you then
[1:32:14] and Luke 10:30 it says in Jesus
[1:32:16] answering said a certain man
[1:32:19] down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell
[1:32:21] among thieves which stripped him of his
[1:32:24] raiment and wounded him and departed
[1:32:26] leaving him half dead oh my the Good
[1:32:30] Samaritan oh brother were deeper than
[1:32:32] this we're so much deeper and by chance
[1:32:37] there came down a certain message priest
[1:32:40] that way and when he saw him he passed
[1:32:43] by on the other side
[1:32:44] oh mama likewise another message Levite
[1:32:51] put in that message part hope that's now
[1:32:53] right but we're kings and priests
[1:32:55] brothers sister and he says and when he
[1:32:58] was at the place came and looked on him
[1:33:01] and passed by on the other side someone
[1:33:05] sick someone wounded someone half dead
[1:33:10] brother sister this is why we begin to
[1:33:13] what we see it brother sister that this
[1:33:17] orchestrates our entire experience and
[1:33:22] the crazy thing of it all brother sister
[1:33:25] is Satan can't do one thing to you but
[1:33:28] bluff you if you don't got all online we
[1:33:34] have laid it down so he passed my I'm on
[1:33:42] the other side 33rd verse but a certain
[1:33:45] Samaritan come on no Gentile as he
[1:33:50] journeyed came where he was and when he
[1:33:53] saw him he had compassion on him preach
[1:33:56] the whole series on compassion brother
[1:33:57] sister compassion is the ability to
[1:34:00] enter into another sufferings notice
[1:34:05] this Samaritan he wasn't some stones
[1:34:08] religious man as far as well I'm too
[1:34:12] good for you right I've heard people say
[1:34:15] so many times that the people in the
[1:34:17] message act like they're thoroughbreds
[1:34:18] and then they can't even witness nobody
[1:34:20] they can't love nobody it should not be
[1:34:25] that way
[1:34:28] cuz brother-sister if we can see
[1:34:31] ourselves in the book
[1:34:32] we're Samaritans in this hour amen Oh
[1:34:35] hallelujah
[1:34:36] we said oh well the prophets said that
[1:34:38] Jesus is a Samaritan right Jesus was a
[1:34:41] certain man right I'll tell you what
[1:34:44] who's Jesus's hands and feet today who
[1:34:48] did he say you're an ambassador you have
[1:34:51] the Ministry of reconciliation you are
[1:34:55] called brother sister to find those
[1:34:58] hurts those bruise those half-dead but
[1:35:05] look at this I want you to see that
[1:35:06] there's this characteristic you know it
[1:35:08] so well about the Samaritan he had
[1:35:13] compassion on him 34th verse and went to
[1:35:15] him and bound up his wounds pouring in
[1:35:22] oil and wine and set him on his own
[1:35:27] beast you see he had a beast as a power
[1:35:30] brother sister he didn't just have
[1:35:32] enough I could hardly stand up he was
[1:35:37] packing the Samaritan oil and one we
[1:35:41] wonder why the world is dying we were
[1:35:47] called to fulfill this you were called
[1:35:51] to help all those beaten and broken
[1:35:53] people but you know what what sets the
[1:35:58] Samaritan aside is he had oil and wine
[1:36:01] and a beast look at this look at this
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:06] set him on his own beast brought him to
[1:36:09] an inn and took care of him and on the
[1:36:12] morrow when he departed he took out two
[1:36:14] pence and gave them to the host and said
[1:36:16] on him take care of him and whatsoever
[1:36:18] thou spend this long when I come I will
[1:36:20] repay thee we can keep on giving Haven
[1:36:26] which now of these three thinkest thou
[1:36:29] was neighbor unto him that fell among
[1:36:31] the thieves
[1:36:32] remember your Bible said what that
[1:36:34] Satan's seek he seek to steal kill and
[1:36:38] destroy
[1:36:41] you see the crazy way these people are
[1:36:44] acting they've only been robbed of the
[1:36:46] devil we've got too rich of a word too
[1:36:53] rich of a God to be hindered and to be
[1:36:58] called robbed ourselves just remember
[1:37:03] you can take it back the law of the land
[1:37:07] your prophets said is to enforce a claim
[1:37:09] you can pray in such a way that Satan
[1:37:13] will have to give it back so notice what
[1:37:19] he says to them last verse and he said
[1:37:21] he that showed mercy on him then said
[1:37:24] Jesus and him go and do likewise the
[1:37:27] commandment to the children of God was a
[1:37:30] ye would go and do likewise notice I go
[1:37:34] just a little bit give me another 10
[1:37:36] minutes let's try to get this done he
[1:37:38] says the Samaritan this is according to
[1:37:41] the internet here found this wonderful
[1:37:42] the Samaritan poured oil and wine on his
[1:37:45] wounds then he bandaged them up notice
[1:37:50] it was common for travellers during that
[1:37:52] time period to carry a flask of oil and
[1:37:56] why notice this was a common sanitizing
[1:38:02] medicine the two were being together and
[1:38:06] poured on the wound the line was used to
[1:38:12] cleanse then why would watch it would
[1:38:17] kill the germs off of that person Oh
[1:38:23] hallelujah
[1:38:24] we had he run into the starboard sister
[1:38:26] you've got it a lot of times they're
[1:38:32] asking for a handout
[1:38:33] but brother sister we can give them a
[1:38:35] spiritual handout that is greater than
[1:38:38] any natural capability amen so what the
[1:38:43] line would cleanse and the oil to quell
[1:38:47] the pain so odd it would take away the
[1:38:51] hurt
[1:38:54] the auto was made to take all the hurt
[1:38:58] of that dead baton steal and kill
[1:39:02] destroyed experience way you could apply
[1:39:16] notice even today
[1:39:20] well what about Tylenol brother
[1:39:25] what about rubbing alcohol God's got a
[1:39:30] good way doesn't he even today the
[1:39:32] combination of the two elements are
[1:39:33] considered highly medicine all they're
[1:39:38] connected right with worship connected
[1:39:42] right with how you please God every day
[1:39:46] he said he'd keep giving it if you keep
[1:39:48] on loving it if you keep on thanking
[1:39:51] them for if you kept on a lot you kept
[1:39:55] on doing likewise hallelujah you were
[1:40:01] called one to move in experience
[1:40:06] unbeaten by Satan to bring forth oil and
[1:40:10] wine a stimulating experience you know
[1:40:14] so many times Roasters we try to witness
[1:40:16] but how happy are you in your witness
[1:40:20] god bless you know God sent a prophet
[1:40:24] and they look at you and say okay oh and
[1:40:31] you expect them how's the half-dead
[1:40:36] gonna help someone half dead you weren't
[1:40:45] called to be half dead
[1:40:46] you aren't called to be half effective
[1:40:49] you are called to what to carry the
[1:40:53] flash game you had the ability not just
[1:40:57] to lay some some oil on there but y-you
[1:41:00] could put them together and have a
[1:41:02] highly medicine or dose for this world's
[1:41:05] population
[1:41:09] and what it wasn't just medicine for
[1:41:13] someone else it was medicine for
[1:41:15] yourself
[1:41:18] [Laughter]
[1:41:22] come please bring it out with your
[1:41:23] prophet said he'll say just a couple
[1:41:26] sentences he'll say it's connected and
[1:41:28] worship it's connected with your
[1:41:29] sacrifice your sacrifice of praise is to
[1:41:34] be accepted with the oil and wine
[1:41:36] experience brother sister you can have
[1:41:39] it today look what he said he said you
[1:41:44] did lamb and of 57 you know I think
[1:41:45] these meetings are when we catch the
[1:41:47] sinner
[1:41:48] you know Jesus found a man one time in a
[1:41:50] parable was on the road from Jericho
[1:41:52] from Jerusalem to Jericho it showed he
[1:41:55] was backsliding I want to say this right
[1:41:59] now brother sister I got a brother that
[1:42:00] just just started come to my church
[1:42:02] about a year ago and his wife was always
[1:42:05] the one that served the message the the
[1:42:06] strong s'en he was always back so that
[1:42:08] always hope this is all right and his
[1:42:14] wife she finally turned on the message
[1:42:16] and walked off and he called me up he
[1:42:22] said I gotta meet you
[1:42:23] we met in a subway it's so ordained
[1:42:25] there's one person that was working
[1:42:27] behind the counter it was in the middle
[1:42:29] of this another big shopping mall no one
[1:42:30] come in until the end and we sat down
[1:42:33] and I've never had this happen on a
[1:42:35] little meeting counselling session we
[1:42:37] sat there and the Holy Ghost just fell
[1:42:39] down in the midst and he started weeping
[1:42:41] and crying I said you know he series
[1:42:42] like I can feel right there that brother
[1:42:45] gave His life back to God he's been
[1:42:47] serving God faithfully ever since and
[1:42:50] his wife has absolutely been tormenting
[1:42:52] him and you know brother Mike the one in
[1:42:57] the wheelchair
[1:42:57] the other ones gonna be walking pretty
[1:42:59] soon here and we talk like sons and
[1:43:01] daughters of God here brother sister you
[1:43:05] say how can it if you heard his
[1:43:09] experience 9 months ago I was up there
[1:43:11] minister on a Wednesday night and the
[1:43:13] Holy Ghost was there he got in his truck
[1:43:15] and started driving back in his
[1:43:16] wheelchair he said he hadn't felt his
[1:43:18] legs for eight or nine years he said all
[1:43:19] of a sudden he felt this
[1:43:20] he felt this anoint he come in the root
[1:43:22] coming in his car and then he said went
[1:43:23] all through his body and he felt his
[1:43:25] legs hadn't felt him for almost nine
[1:43:26] years hallelujah
[1:43:31] it's going to happen mark the Word of
[1:43:36] God hallelujah
[1:43:39] and this brother he started getting all
[1:43:41] sad about it he said and there's been
[1:43:43] like ten people who have these dreams
[1:43:44] that brother Mike's gonna walk he said
[1:43:48] you said brother camel I don't mean to
[1:43:49] lean on this but how come God gives this
[1:43:51] brother all these dreams and and I don't
[1:43:54] get nothing I said brother God must have
[1:43:58] knew that you were strong enough that
[1:43:58] you wouldn't need that but I said God
[1:44:01] can do it if that's gonna be something
[1:44:02] you need for your faith but technically
[1:44:04] you shouldn't need that anyway you
[1:44:06] should be looking at the word cuz I mean
[1:44:08] she just gets worse all time I said
[1:44:10] glory to God she's gonna break hard cuz
[1:44:15] you know what we doing the message we
[1:44:16] say yep they left the message I knew
[1:44:18] they were so procedure God's gonna bring
[1:44:22] this one brother sister so anyway it was
[1:44:25] just a couple of days after that and
[1:44:26] then two people in the church had dreams
[1:44:29] that she walked up in the church say God
[1:44:36] is that faithful and now all these
[1:44:39] little things are just happening we have
[1:44:41] to live in the reality of this word
[1:44:42] brother sister we've got to look at this
[1:44:44] and look right in the face of an
[1:44:46] impossibility and say o death where is
[1:44:49] your sting
[1:44:49] o mountain be thou removed just
[1:44:57] backsliders cuz we got oil on one plenty
[1:45:02] of it so notice he was back saying he
[1:45:05] met him on the road and the enemy had
[1:45:06] beaten him and robbed him and left him
[1:45:08] half dead that was physically alive
[1:45:10] spiritually dead your prophet he says
[1:45:14] the priests and the Levites so forth
[1:45:16] past him but the Good Samaritans Jesus
[1:45:18] taught it King picked him up poured oil
[1:45:21] and wine and take them to the end now no
[1:45:24] she said now there's the place I want to
[1:45:26] get you you he taken him to the end and
[1:45:29] said to the caretaker take care of him
[1:45:32] he
[1:45:33] a couple of pennies or whatever it was
[1:45:35] to pay his way and said now if he needs
[1:45:37] any more just go ahead and take care of
[1:45:40] him it'll I'll make it when I'll make it
[1:45:43] right when I come he says now your
[1:45:45] shepherds God give you the spirit in the
[1:45:47] word to take care of these wounded ones
[1:45:48] that's been brought in he types the in
[1:45:51] as the church says you can bring him in
[1:45:58] you can apply the oil and why some of us
[1:46:02] are looking at a flask right now doesn't
[1:46:08] have to be that way the devil took it
[1:46:11] from you well you can take it right back
[1:46:13] so if you need any more you'll take care
[1:46:18] of that when it comes to you to speed
[1:46:20] the Sheep now I want to get to one more
[1:46:21] place you see that I'm not just making
[1:46:23] these things up but God ordained these
[1:46:25] things to be in Scripture now notice
[1:46:27] when God fleed from Esau he came to a
[1:46:30] place called el Bethel how many know
[1:46:34] what Bethel means Beth ll God Beth the
[1:46:40] house Bethel means the house of God so
[1:46:45] in Jacob left and he fled from his
[1:46:47] brother's wrath he met God on a place
[1:46:50] where he seen angels descending and
[1:46:52] ascending run and we think we are
[1:46:57] climbing Jacob's Ladder and there he was
[1:47:03] there and he had that vision that dream
[1:47:05] upon him and what right after he he set
[1:47:08] the pillar up any poured oil over it he
[1:47:11] said this is El Bethel the house of God
[1:47:16] now when he actually came back on his
[1:47:20] way back from all those wanderings God
[1:47:24] comes to him in Genesis 30:1 5:1 he's
[1:47:27] got quite a group with him now why some
[1:47:29] kids and those who says and God said
[1:47:31] unto Jacob our eyes go to up to Bethel
[1:47:34] and dwell there and make there an altar
[1:47:38] unto God that appeared unto thee when
[1:47:41] thou fled us from the face of that of
[1:47:43] Esau thy brother and then Jacob
[1:47:46] sent him to his household and to all
[1:47:47] that were with him notice he's got to
[1:47:50] clean up put away the strange gods that
[1:47:53] are among you and be clean and trade
[1:47:56] your garments puts the whole house under
[1:48:02] the word yes come on sis you come back
[1:48:06] up to Bethel now you come up to the
[1:48:09] house of God third verse and let us
[1:48:13] arise almost done and go up to Bethel
[1:48:15] and I will make thee there an altar unto
[1:48:18] God God said you go that or make an
[1:48:22] altar there then that make you want to
[1:48:25] say better is one day in your courts
[1:48:26] than a thousand elsewhere who answered
[1:48:32] me in the day of my distress and was
[1:48:34] with me in the way which I went so here
[1:48:37] he does cleans everything out and starts
[1:48:40] heading to the house of God again he'd
[1:48:44] went by a different way but God called
[1:48:47] him back to the house of God notice in
[1:48:50] the night verse I want you to see this
[1:48:53] because I want you to notice this
[1:48:54] particular little thing that when Jacob
[1:48:57] was going he had an experience where he
[1:48:59] poured oil No Genesis 35 9 says and God
[1:49:03] appeared here in Bethel and unto Jacob
[1:49:06] again when he came out of but
[1:49:08] paddan-aram and blessed him and God said
[1:49:11] unto Him thy name is Jacob thy name
[1:49:14] shall not be called any more Jacob but
[1:49:17] Israel shall be thy name
[1:49:20] what's Israel me a prince with power
[1:49:23] with God
[1:49:30] God said unto him I am God Almighty be
[1:49:33] fruitful multiply nation in the company
[1:49:35] of nations shall be of thee and Kings
[1:49:37] shall come out of thy Lords and the
[1:49:39] language I gave Abraham and Isaac to
[1:49:41] thee I gave it and to thy seed and after
[1:49:44] thee will I give the land and God went
[1:49:46] up from him in the place where he talked
[1:49:48] with him and Jacob set up a pillar in
[1:49:52] the place where he talked with him even
[1:49:56] a pillar of stone and he pour a drink
[1:50:02] offering there on what was the drink
[1:50:06] offering why poured wine on it
[1:50:10] notice this is his offering unto God at
[1:50:16] the first he just laid some oil on there
[1:50:19] but after a while and what and coming
[1:50:23] back to his homeland brother sister
[1:50:25] we're coming back to the original word
[1:50:27] all the way it has been preached to us
[1:50:31] 50 years ago but we've got to eat this
[1:50:34] book because it has to manifest itself
[1:50:38] through us that's what's waiting on this
[1:50:42] rapture brother sister is that what
[1:50:44] we've got to allow this word to become a
[1:50:47] full revelation to us so he poured a
[1:50:54] drink offering their own and he poured
[1:50:56] oil their honor and Jacob called the
[1:50:59] name of the place where God spake with
[1:51:02] him of course there we realized he comes
[1:51:09] right back to the homeland now don't he
[1:51:10] now let's stand now brother sister I
[1:51:12] want you to see this that when we look
[1:51:15] at God the house of God God requires
[1:51:23] that when we go into the house of God
[1:51:27] that we can still bring him all in line
[1:51:37] he wants you to come to the house of God
[1:51:40] with an expectation
[1:51:42] god I can hear from you you are here you
[1:51:45] are going to stimulate my experience
[1:51:48] with the revelation of this word and God
[1:51:51] I brought my Holy Ghost that's why we
[1:51:53] come early we pray up we get ready we
[1:51:56] don't wait for the word that comes okay
[1:51:58] I've been laying here dead the whole
[1:51:59] time we come we know what the house of
[1:52:01] God is for we know what we're here to do
[1:52:04] and brother sister if ever there was a
[1:52:07] time we should be getting a good
[1:52:09] Samaritan mentality and saying God when
[1:52:12] I run into the half-dead backslidden let
[1:52:18] me be packin oil and wine that I can
[1:52:23] touch their wounds cuz why are you here
[1:52:29] today
[1:52:31] because almost all of us have had a tan
[1:52:35] experience with God where one day he
[1:52:37] found you half dead one day he found you
[1:52:41] back slid he found you completely in the
[1:52:44] world and then either he come along or
[1:52:50] he sent someone along the way to
[1:52:53] minister this message to you and when
[1:52:57] the message was ministered to you it was
[1:53:05] and you found yourself in El Bethel ever
[1:53:08] since and brother sister we weren't just
[1:53:15] to receive an experience to say okay God
[1:53:17] someone help me out
[1:53:18] I guess I'll come in the house of God
[1:53:20] now but we realized that we're mature
[1:53:22] soldiers today we should be look and say
[1:53:25] I've got my own line right here I'm
[1:53:27] heading out let's see if we can apply
[1:53:29] just in case there's someone long way
[1:53:33] see when we come into the house of God
[1:53:36] God Here I am here's my worship Lord
[1:53:39] hallelujah
[1:53:40] I brought my token today
