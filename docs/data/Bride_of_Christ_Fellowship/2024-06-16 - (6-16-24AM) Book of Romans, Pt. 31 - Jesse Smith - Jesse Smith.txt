TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I felt like you know last time we preached on the book of Romans I thought maybe I had one more sermon on it by God's grace so I just want to preach this I was studying on this the last few days and it really was blessed by the grace of God Romans 1 9 and 10 just want to see Paul's heart as a spiritual father look at Paul's heart here verse n says for God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayer so Paul would always remember all the churches right in their prayers we know he said the same thing to the church at Philippi he would always pray so in his daily prayers he's I pray in Philippi I pray for the Saints in Rome he always made mention of them remember God is storing up our prayers in vials up in heaven Hallelujah Paul said God's my witness amen so that's was a very serious statement he saying God knows I pray for you always amen verse 10 making requests if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you verse one for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift sounds like a good father to me Hallelujah a spiritual father right to the end that you may be established that is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual Faith both of you and me so one thing we see you know we often pray for people to have comfort you know when they lose a loved one but Paul said just being with the Saints brought him great comfort that's right if he could just spend time with the church he would be comforted and that would mean much that that would mean so much to him as a man a single man he's never been married right never had children but it would just comfort him so much to be able to see the Saints of course their faith would be lived out and he could spend time with them that would bring Comfort to the Apostle Hallelujah the prophet of God uh let's go to Romans 15:23 Romans 15:23 course read this a couple of weeks ago and we preached on chapter 15 let's just read verse 23 together we can on three 1 2 3 but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you so we see at the beginning of the book we see at the end of the letter Paul really wanted to be with these Saints I love it because I as I've studied I made a mistake I didn't think Paul made it to wrome well of course he made it to to Rome I forgot about it I love to see this God had a great desire in his heart to be with them and then God made a way he could be with them may God add His blessings to R's word you can be seated by God's face now verse 24 of chapter 15 we get a little more on this he said whensoever I take my journey into Spain I will come to you for I trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first I be somewhat filled with your company Hallelujah so we see that there in verse 24 Hallelujah so Paul's great desire many years as we said a few weeks ago you know there's desires we have you know and we don't get them fulfilled right away we've got to wait years and years and years uh for our desires to be fulfilled and some of them the Bible said in Hebrews 11 we won't even have those desires here uh we we made die we may pass away of course we know a Christian Never Dies Hallelujah death means separation Hallelujah we might be separated from this realm Hallelujah but we'll never die Hallelujah we never be uh eternally dead or eternally separated from God hallelujah when we leave this place the Bible said we're present with the Lord amen but if we know if we don't experience you know in this life the things we desire we know God will grant us that desire in the Millennium praise God cuz all wrongs will be made right there hallah hallelujah amen everything will be uh manifested there that God planned for us hallelujah all that he ordained for us will be uh granted there hallelujah amen but it was uh you know I love what Paul's prayer is you know I want to be I want to have a prosperous journey to get there and uh you know no doubt it was a prosperous journey we'll look at that in a little bit but maybe not what we would consider prosperous Hallelujah we how many always want the best right you want you want everything to go well you want everything to go smoothly we pray for God's blessing right we ask for his his Blessing and prosperity but God doesn't always give us what we want God gives us what we need praise God and God knows we have need of many times is we need to go through tests we need to go through trials Hallelujah right trials make us stronger the trials are more precious than that of gold amen your trials you go through are better than gold better than riches hallelujah amen and the Bible is plain on that so we rejoice in that that God would give us what we have need our father would give us what we have need of not what we want all the time amen hallelujah God is so gracious now I wish there was a way we got this big old screen here but I didn't have enough time to actually forgot about I wanted to bring the Apple TV and kind of hook up here but uh maybe uh this week by God's grace so um you know looking at the timeline of Paul's Ministry Paul was converted around ad. 34 so right after maybe a year after the day of Pentecost or maybe that same year Paul was converted of course on the road to Damascus and then I just thought it was you know very fitting you know that he had about 35 years of ministry brother brandham had about 32 years of full-time Ministry so I just thought it was interesting they had about the same amount of time both prophets of God the prophet to begin the church Age The Prophet to end the church age Hallelujah both had about the same number of years of ministry now brother randam of course was saved before 1933 but that's when he became a pastor in 193 3 and of course he died in 1965 so that's 32 years of full-time ministry right full-time we know there's quotations around full time because of course brother R was a Christian before that so Paul was a uh a prophet or Minister you know for around 35 years from 33 or 34 ad to about 67 or 68 ad and uh you know by history the first book he wrote was likely uh the letter to the Galatians around 47 or 49 ad somewhere around there the reason we know that is because in Acts 15 Paul goes to this Council of Jerusalem with Peter and James and they're asking all these questions well Gentiles are now getting the Holy Ghost what do we tell them to do do they keep all the commands and you know if you're a Bible reader they come up with four regulations right right that's what the Bible says and uh one of them and none of them are about circumcision right but in Galatians Paul's rebuking the Galatians because they've let circumcision creep back in right so we know we know Galatians was written before acts 15 Hallelujah because Paul if Paul if if if acts 15 would have already happened Paul would have said here's the four regulations right right but even you know uh I'm going to preach a sermon on this sometime soon the leaven of sin each of these churches was battling some type of Leaven right right even the Pharisees Jesus said Beware of the leav of the Pharisees right Hallelujah we know there was LE the next book I'm going to preach Lord willing is the book of First Corinthians there was LE in the Corinthian Church it was this idea that they didn't mourn over their sin I'm talking about awful sexual sin they didn't mourn over it in fact they were puffed up they were uh they were extremely defiant about it they were just uh uh they they were constantly trying to uh make themselves self-righteous they were uh what's the word I'm looking for they were trying to defend themselves you know they hadn't even mourned over this sin that was happening to the church and Paul said that's leaven amongst the church this inability to repent of sin but Paul you know wrote that letter to Galatians and and then he went on his first missionary trip and then his second missionary trip so the order Galatians he wrote that verse then he wrote the letters to the Thessalonians on his second missionary trip and then his third missionary trip he wrote the letters to Corinthians and then Romans which is what we've been preaching by God's grace so he wrote the book of Romans on his third missionary trip then he got arrested he either got arrested twice in Rome or once historians aren't for sure um and then it was either during his first arrest in Rome or his second arrest in Rome where he wrote What's called the prison Epistles that was Ephesians Colossians fiman and then first and 2 Timothy and Titus so again think about that just for a brief moment God allowed us to get thus sayith the Lord from the man of God while he was in prison most of us would think oh it's awful he's in prison oh how could God allow this there's no way this is the will of God when in reality it was completely the will of God Amen so just opening up our minds and our thoughts about you know why things happen to people and uh looks like maybe bad things are happening but remember friends God's behind everything Hallelujah God's Got A Plan he's got a purpose behind everything the heavenly father amen as as a perfect father as a a a blameless father he's allowed all these events of Our Lives now Paul made it to Rome and Paul made it to Rome because it was thus saith the Lord Jesus Hallelujah we say thus sayith the Lord but Paul got a thus sayith the Lord Jesus from the Lord Jesus Hallelujah in a dream it's in Acts 23:10 if you got your Bibles and when they arose I'm sorry and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain now Paul is right now being surrounded by Jews in Jerusalem and they want to kill him but God delivers him and God gives him wisdom to know oh if I if I if I mention I'm a Roman citizen then they can't they can't uh uh they can't execute me because they were breaking the Roman laws because the Roman laws were more important at that time than the Jewish laws of course because Rome was the uh governing power right but the Bible said in verse 10 fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them so Paul was literally going to be pulled apart by this mob this is the kind of Trials he went through and this wasn't once in a while this was very common Paul was constantly suffering and even my wife showed me a good verse the other day remember when Jesus and his Apostles they were walking through the field and they took some corn why' they take corn on the Sabbath why did they take corn at all because they were very hungry yeah God let his own Apostles get very hungry God was there in flesh and let them feel the pain of hunger that's right right so God could be with you in your darkest hour and you say well surely God's not here and yet God is there hallelujah amen God will let us uh God let Paul be beaten right many times and stoned and Shipwrecked and hungering often fastings often yet God was behind it all Hallelujah this ought to help us to trust God more amen that's what I love learning about Paul you know I don't know about you but I imagine he'd be our spiritual father Hallelujah almost every Christian Hallelujah he'd be like a spiritual Father Figure amen so they were going to pull Paul in pieces you can imagine the crowd was pulling out his arms and they were going to pull him apart but he Comm they commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him to the castle verse 11 acts 23:11 and the night following the Lord stood by him so imagine you're at night time I don't know if it was a dream or Vision but then he's maybe laying down or maybe he's chained up and he sees the Lord and the Lord says be of good cheer Paul now he was just surrounded by a mob almost pulled apart and the Lord said be of good cheer God help us to have a good attitude when we go through trials amen but see that's what I love if we don't Jesus will come and say be of good cheer amen he'll help us to be cheerful despite trials Hallelujah remember he's got soldiers he's sleeping around soldiers that's what they did in those days right they didn't have prisons all over the place so a Roman soldier would chain himself to you right if you were arrested so Paul sleeping by these Romans by at least one Roman soldier yeah chained to one of them so they don't get away right he don't get away and the Lord shows to him himself and he's standing there and he says be of good cheer for as thou H has test testify to me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at Rome hallelujah amen so he had thus say the Lord he was going to get to Rome amen now before this he'd already written a letter to them amen so isn't it awesome you know sometimes God you know you'll have a desire in your heart you'll not know if it's from God but then I like this Paul had this desire and the Lord came around and showed him this desire was of me Hallelujah in other words I put this desire in your heart hallelujah amen glory and then if God put in your heart God's going to bring it to pass Hallelujah John Gil said as Paul had bore a public and faithful witness to the person office and Grace of Jesus Christ at Jerusalem the Metropolis of Judea so it was necessary by the decree of decree of God and for the glory of Christ that he should bear a like testimony at Rome the chief City in all the world Amen I just it just struck me there God let Paul be a witness in the spirit spiritual center of the world as as a as a light but also as a as a a witness for or against whoever believed in the spiritual center of the kingdom of the world and then he set Paul as the same thing a light and a witness in the natural center of the world Hallelujah CH don't you know that's why God has Believers here in America right God's got to have witnesses in every nation right this was the richest nation of all right Rome and so God said I'm going to make you a witness there that's what God's done for us in America we must be Witnesses in the midst of this wickedness Hallelujah God needs a witness Hallelujah that's what he's called us to be to Bear witness to share your testimony in this city Hallelujah in this land amen amen then he said the Holy Spirit would signify that you'll not die at Jerusalem what a what a witness Hallelujah when God puts something on your heart and he comes around and vindicates it Hallelujah I love that amen now what Paul does now after this after this moment there in in Acts 23 Paul later set sail to stand trial in Rome in Acts 27 so remember he said Lord I just pray make my journey prosperous amen and so what happens on the journey the ship sinks your car breaks down your house burns down you lose a loved one right he praise for a prosperous Journey right and that that's what we all want we want life to go so smoothly life didn't go so smoothly for Paul all the time but I love this and even this moment right even this moment he's we went back and uh looked at acts 23 he's surrounded by soldiers Christ appears to him before he sinks on the boat Christ appears to him amen hallelujah God gives you all these visitations amen the Holy Spirit visits you the Holy Spirit pours out his blessings God speaks to you Hallelujah he's always there he allows you to go through it to make you a more humble Christian to make your character more solid Hallelujah cuz power without character is satanic Hallelujah but character that's tested and tribe is fit to rule in the Millennium Hallelujah remember Church they didn't eat food for 14 days you can go read that in Acts 27 yes when was the last time he went two weeks without a meal and Paul finally had to convince him take some meat because it's going to be all right hallelujah amen no man will lose his life on the ship Hallelujah this was a common uh this was a common thing in Paul's life tests trials sufferings starvation right you know all these all these trials that would go through right he prayed for prosperity and God gave him Prosperity just in a different way hallelujah how many would believe it it's more prosperous uh to have all the solders lives saved than to just have an easy trip Hallelujah right it's more prosperous that these these prisoners are saved Hallelujah their lives are spared that's more prosperous than to have all the the the the cares of the world or ease of Life Hallelujah in other words God sparing lives and God saving Souls that's more important than an easy life or enough food or enough money or a a big enough house or a fast enough car whatever ever you whatever the the the cares of Life are what's most important is Souls Hallelujah Souls getting them to repent of their sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then serve Jesus Christ right amen and overcome sin that's what's most important Hallelujah that's really being prosperous hallelujah it's to learn to love Jesus and to learn to love to hate sin Hallelujah that's what's Prosperity hallelujah amen that's what Paul and the angel visited member of the bottom of the ship and said not one man will lose his life Hallelujah everyone in the ship shall be saved hallelujah amen amen so this was his journey now he had all all his thoughts M I can't wait to make the CH trip to Rome he probably would not have maybe signed up for if he knew he was going to have to sink Hallelujah on a ship and the Bible said he Flo all night on a piece of wood yeah just lying there I see the same angel that was went with him in the ship was the same angel that was with him in the water hallelujah praise God amen amen and all this so he can have his great desire just to be with the Romans Hallelujah just to be with the Saints to see these people that he' written to and heard about remember their faith had gone around the world Hallelujah they were so loving they were so unified they were so uh uh they had such understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen amen this is how God sometimes answers our prayers some through the waters some through the floods some through great trials but all through the blood Hallelujah we'll go through many trials but the main thing is confess your sins Hallelujah believe in Jesus Christ Hallelujah learn every day to take up your cross and die to your desires hallelujah amen and become a disciple a learner of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen amen acts 28:1 through1 they land you're familiar with this probably they land on the island of Mita so where are all these prisoners all these prisoners on the boat are floating on on pieces of wood pieces of the ship and they all just drift over they all paddle over to the island of Mita that's where Paul you know they they instantly gather the wood Paul grabs the wood and a Viper comes out bites him you cast a Viper in the fire it burns up I like that that's what God does to all of our evil uh all of our evil spirits Hallelujah I like how he casted down the Viper that's the type of we must cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God and that sin will be abolished in the Holy Fire of God hallelujah amen it'll be taken care of hallelujah amen but we got to cast it off of ourselves Hallelujah don't let that Viper stay on you don't let that sin stay on You cast it off Hallelujah say I'm done with this Hallelujah I'm disconnecting this from my life amen hallelujah try not to clap love sorry L amen disconnect that it's death it's a serpent it's the devil Hallelujah disconnect that Sin from your life and throw it in the fire Hallelujah and they all thought oh this man's more not just a man he's a god Paul said don't do that don't worship me I'm just a sinner Sav by Grace Hallelujah I'm just given a a prophetic gift from the foundation of the world Hallelujah it was just it wasn't me it was God hallelujah so now we pick up if you have your Bibles acts 28:1 we want to pick up at acts 2811 so he's on the island of Mita it's just a little bit south of the part of Italy called Sicily it's like on the boot of Italy if you're not it's the it's the sou southwestern part of Italy and I had all the pictures ready I had everything to show I just forgot about that so sorry Paul was sailing of course from CRE uh in the sea of Arabia and uh the ship of course was uh sunk but they all swam to Mita now in Acts 2811 Mal you want to read that 11 and uh 12 and after 3 months we departed in the ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the aisle whose sign was cter in poock and landing at ccus we carry there three days amen so uh we can see that you know uh the people Mita love Paul in fact Paul prayed for uh many of the sick on the island came to him and they were healed hallelujah hallelujah that's how they knew he was a man of God God heard his prayers Hallelujah uh there was a there was a blood issue there was numerous diseases the Bible said they came to Paul Paul healed them Hallelujah and notice Church all the prisoners around would have seen that right right cuz Paul had he was a prisoner right he was chained to another and think of that man Hallelujah think of that prisoner who would have been privileged to be changed to a prophet of God oh God may we be changed to the prophet of God Amen may we be so connected to brother Ram's Ministry Hallelujah I'm not ashamed of it amen you know brother Rod took me to he and I went to Overland on Friday he said brother Jesse I just want to tell you he said what I admire about you is that you stand by brother brandom you're not ashamed of brother brandom he he's trying to stand behind his former Pastor pass away and he said that's what I like about you you stand behind brother brand you defend him I said well that's what Paul said Paul said don't be ashamed of me his prisoner amen I'm not ashamed of brother brandom Hallelujah the people that are accusing brother brand guess what they got all these fingers pointing back at them Hallelujah right it's easy to point out somebody else's mistakes why don't you take that plug uh plank out of your eye and look at your mistakes amen remember who's accused of the Brethren Satan is accused of the Brethren hallelujah amen oh we're grateful to stand behind God's Prophet amen amen so they they uh they stayed there I think 3 months and then when it became Springtime they left and went to Syracuse as Malachi read there sorry I got the wrong page there we go and then the 12 they landed at Syracuse and they stayed there 3 days hallelujah then in verse 13 they went from Syracuse up to regium which is a one- day travel and then they travel to patoli I'm not probably not saying that right but they're getting closer and closer as they're heading north west they're getting closer and closer to Rome where Paul had waited all these years amen hallelujah he waited all these years now look at verse 14 we found I'm sorry where we found Brethren so in pulio they found Brethren and were desired to T with them seven days and so he went toward Rome so notice they found Brethren amen they found Christians remember Paul's not alone he's got a group of prisoners with him right it was likely Saints who' heard and these are probably saints that had read Paul's letter to the Romans like wow I get to meet the man who wrote this inspired thus sayith the Lord Bible I get to me meet the man that wrote the Bible amen what a statement amen what an opportunity Hallelujah I get to meet the man who saw Jesus after he died and Rose Paul said I saw him last right Peter saw him first I'm sorry the women saw him verse then he went to Peter right and he said but last of all he was seen of me as well amen amen hallelujah and so they these Brethren found out they go to meet Paul so this uh so it's probably been six years since Paul wrote this letter and so six years after having this having the Scrolls of Paul and reading the book of Romans now they get to meet the man who wrote it Hallelujah and Paul's desire gets to be fulfilled now he's meeting Saints all these Christians around Rome Hallelujah God's given him his great desires hallelujah amen see Church many of our great desires you know sometimes we don't understand we might have to go through a lot of things in order to receive them that's right amen Paul waited at least six or seven years to get his great desire to meet the Saints Hallelujah but when he does it was a great blessing Hallelujah there's much comfort there amen am Hallelujah God game his heart's desire now I love what John Gil said he's a preacher from the 1800s he says Christians at pulio desired the Apostle Apostle and those that were with him to stay a week with them that they might have the advantage of a day of public worship together so they wanted him to stay seven days so he could be there on Sunday to preach the word of God Amen just like we're doing today amen isn't that your desire you know when we have guest preachers can't that's why I have guest preachers in on Sunday amen but if we can't get them for Sunday we'll get them for Wednesday amen we'll have to I I've seen cam do that they've called special meetings on Thursday and brother Randy SC has done that if they can only get a preacher for one day they want to have service with that preacher amen amen stay a weak and we can have the advantage of a day of public worship enjoy the Christian conversation but notice this all had to be granted by and this historian gives the name of Julius the Centurion so apparently the Centurion who was with them was Julius that was the one of the the leader of all the the Roman soldiers now this shows here uh this writer says this shows that he used the Apostle with great Civility and courteousness and was very ready to Grant him favors now this is awesome why would a Roman guard Centurion honor Paul's wishes today hey let's take a week off uh you know we're we're heading back we got orders to get back to bring all these prisoners but we'll we'll wait a week wow just for you Paul a I wonder why I wonder if Jesus appeared to them as well amen hallelujah this Roman centor would delay their trip they got orders strict orders but the Roman Centurion gave Paul favor you know why because he's a real Christian hallelujah amen I wonder if they saw the Lord as the Lord appeared to Paul see Church you'll get special favors if you're a real Christian we see amen get it all the time I like how Who Will Pray that's just a small example amen hallelujah pray that my husband can come to church I love it amen Church look for special favors God will give them to you praise God Amen because you're a faithful believer hallelujah amen God will give you favor in the eyes of people amen hallelujah and so they journeyed on towards Rome Hallelujah but they had a week off in order to have some Services Glory verse 15 and from then when the Brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as AI forum and the three taverns whom when Paul saw he thanked God and took courage amen so now they travel even closer to Rome now they're not too far from Rome we'd say and so Paul and the prisoners finally I'm sorry they're getting real close and Paul begins to see more and more of his desires fulfilled these Saints are hearing about him you know letters took a long time to travel they take months to travel in those days but yet God allowed enough time where the letters could get out and they could come see the servant of Goden heading to his final destination on this Earth at least for 2,000 years amen he he's he's coming back to the Earth amen hallelujah the dead in Christ will rise first hallelujah amen God but on his Earthly Journey here while living in this pest house we'd say or the body of this flesh Paul's walking his final Road think about that he's walking his final steps on this Earth before the Millennium Hallelujah and so Paul he gets to meet with these Saints and notice when he meets them what does he do he thanks God and he takes courage in other words imagine why would he be encouraged by these Christians because they no doubt heard his word and they kept the word of God hallelujah and then of course he's he's encouraged my I I prayed for many years I prayed for you every day for all these years and now I get to see you face to face hallelujah amen oh my what a blessing so he takes a moment thank you Lord that I could have my great desire fulfilled in my heart and I get to see the Saints from Rome Hallelujah and he took courage Hallelujah if all these Saints are praying for me if God gave me the desires of my heart I know I'm right the perfect will of God hallelujah I'm doing exactly what Jesus has called me to do amen amen Oh Glory verse 16 and finally the prophet's desires fulfilled after years of waiting there's a finally I like that amen amen Church you might wait many years but finally it's going to happen Hallelujah right we can say finally brother William has come back to akan Hallelujah finally after two years of waiting and church one of these days the finally is going to be a reality Hallelujah like finally Austin's back and finally their married Hallelujah that's what I said finally I'm married amen we're coming up on 21 years on Friday June's a pretty awesome month Hallelujah for lots of reasons finally we we dream we dream about things we pray for things we ask God for things he takes us through trials and and Dark Places and tests things we wouldn't ask for but yet finally we get a fulfillment to our desires amen Paul finally gets there in Rome in verse 16 amen and when we came to Rome the Centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the Guard so all the prisoners go to the captain of the Guard into the prison but not Paul Hallelujah but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him now Paul's Paul's crime was way less severe than these other prisoners right so it's likely because he had such a small uh charge against him he was allowed to live in a hired house right but he remained chained to the soldier right today they got those bracelets right thank God I've never worn them Hallelujah but if you have God's God's gracious amen but see they got those today to keep track of you those days they didn't have them so had to be chained to a Roman soldier now acts 28 verse 20 says he was chained look at verse 20 for this cause therefore have I called for you to see you and this speak with you because that for the hope of Israel I'm bound with this chain wow wow so he's he's bound right he is connected to a soldier right and there's all these stories I've heard over the years of how this Soldier probably got saved seeing the Holy Spirit he are the sick on Molita amen glory he would have saw Paul come up and say don't fret every man's life will be saved thus sayith the Lord amen amen that's right no doubt this man would have seen these men would have seen the power of God on Paul they would have seen thus sayith the Lord hallelujah amen I like what a preacher I heard a preacher say now here Paul in Rome now he gets a captive audience you know captive audience means they're listening to like you are all doing today nobody's sleeping nobody's uh throwing spit wids like they did in high school when I was in high school you know nobody's on their phone by God's grace you know but you're captive you're you're listening you're paying attention but here Paul had a different typee of captive audience the captive audience was the soldier who was like a captive to him amen amen praise God so see church God is going to put you in situations God knew the soldier that would be there God knew all this God orchestrates everything Hallelujah God's Great desire is to get us to hear the gospel accept the gospel and spread the gospel amen that's our great desire how can we do that Hallelujah this is the Great plan of God as we'll see don't forget because some of these things might be familiar to you as we read on here in verse 17 through 29 I'm not going to read these but Paul once he's there in Rome he's got his own hired house now and some people say you know some brothers paid for it maybe he paid for with his earnings we don't know but he calls all these Jews together once he's in Rome to testify about Jesus some believe and some don't just like today some of your friends will believe some of your family members will believe some won't right and Paul said this is a fulfillment of scripture he said most of these hearts of the Jews he said their hearts are waxed gross which means thick their hearts are thickened which means a callous got a calluses on your hands which means they don't feel their hearts don't feel the gospel like you do Paul felt the gospel Paul felt the cross of Jesus Christ Paul F felt the resurrection amen hallelujah he felt it yeah church that's what we got to be careful we got to feel the preaching of the Gospel we have to have a heart for Hallelujah that's why I enjoyed visiting Oberland with brother uh Rod there Charles finny was he was hated by most people in his day but he also won over a million Souls that's right and maybe his methods weren't exactly right but what he was doing he was bringing the people out of starch presbyterianism that's right right so we had to use different methods amen but God blessed him Hallelujah because he was he was trying to get he you know he had what was called a MERS bench and he would preach he would preach hell hot and Heaven high in other words he would say if you don't repent you can go to hell right repent of your sins and he would stop in the middle of service and he would say now whose soul is anxious that they need to get close to God and he would said come on up and sit on the they called it the anxious bench that's right so the first row was the anxious bench and then he would he would take his time and just in the first row he would you should see the pictures if you've ever seen a picture of Charles PNY you need to see it he was Ohio man hallah of course he moved to Ohio amen but he would just stare at them and try to convict them of their sins are you ready to repent and you're guilty of this You Must Escape hell and that's how he was so successful because the other method was just Presbyterians you know just behind the pulpit with their phds and llds just putting the people to sleep see their hearts were wax gross they didn't feel the gospel but vny made us feel it hallelujah amen in other words you need to feel the weight of your sin if you don't repent you will go to hell right Hallelujah and most of us are saved here so what I would say is if you don't repent you're going to suffer Hallelujah that's right even more than what you might sin will always find you out hallelujah amen and so the Presby would would uh would would belittle him oh he's got this mortar's bench and he lets sisters pray sometimes and all the all these accusations oh he stares at the people and his voice is really loud and they were blaspheming the Holy Ghost right as they sat in their their dead Presbyterian churches MH but what was he trying to do he was trying to get the people to not be so hard-hearted yeah but to be tender towards the gospel I've always appreciated that sermon God gave me about the red heer see if you touch anything dead you couldn't even get into the gate you couldn't even get in for seven days remember that in other words you couldn't even see you couldn't appreciate the blood sacrifice it meant nothing to you cuz you touch you touch dead stuffff I think I'm going to preach that down there to to the saints that maybe this Thursday on uh Junction City but that that's how it is church we got to be careful with that if we touch dead things if we're mingling with sin then the cross won't mean anything to us it becomes a dead religion it becomes dead to us and church we come in and out of it remember BR man says there's times I don't even feel like I'm saved right that's because we spend too much time in the flesh God help us to repent hallelujah we're still saved we still got the Holy Ghost we're still going to heaven but we're not living we're not being able to feel the gospel like we ought to amen I want people to look at me and say boy that guy's on fire Hallelujah not just while I'm preaching but while I'm at home amen while I'm at work while I'm out and about I want people to see that man's got a fire for Christ he's tender towards the gospel what does that mean church just being willing uh quick to pray just quick to pray for somebody at the store quick to pray for somebody if you get a text just bow your head and pray just re recognize God's presence in our lives amen not having a hard heart where you don't feel the needs anymore yeah Paul said they have he's quoting Isaiah 69 they have ears they can't hear they have eyes they can't see they can't see what's going on they can't hear the gospel their hearts don't understand he said and then because of that they won't get healed yeah which means a cure that's right see there's a cure for your sin problem all of us amen like I said letting that V or stay attached detach it amen separate yourself that's what the heavenly father said in 2 Corinthians 6 he said come out from among them amen separate yourself amen and I will be a God I'll be a father unto you amen oh Hallelujah God says I'll be a father but I'm calling you away from the worldly sins I'm calling you away from bad habens I'm calling you away from sin and Temptation amen amen amen he said they they won't receive the healing they their hearts won't be converted which means turned around or repenting see we have to recognize that our our lives have turned around my life was going in a certain direction but when the love of Jesus was showed to me I turned it around and I'm going in a different direction Hallelujah I'm pressing on towards the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen amen church we live in a wonderful time where the word of God has been restored let me just share this in that city of overin it's only an hour away from here it was started by Christians I think I showed it to my wife if you join that City it was a Christian City that's how it started if you joined it you had the sign of pledge I'm not going to wear tight clothing if you're a sister it's right there it's on the it's on the it's on the uh the charter you want to be a part of this time no tight clothes now here's the hard thing for me they would said no tea and no coffee wow cuz they said it was bad for your health but now scientists say it's good for you thank God Amen but also no tobacco use look they recognized it if you want to be a part of that now look that was that was uh the man anointing right brother said that was the third seal the anointing of the man and that was sanctification Hallelujah and you had to sign a charter and if you broke the law you had a fine right maybe jail time now look we live in a time of more grace we got more understanding right amen but I hope you think next time you drink that Diet Coke it's going to hurt your hurt your body amen don't do that don't get addicted to things like that if it's going to hurt you right right but look at the look at devotion that was just 150 years ago look at the devotion of these people they said to stay keep our body's healthy that we can serve god without distraction amen look at that I was blown away brother BR said in one place he said Charles Vinny uh could have been the greatest preacher since St Paul but he also said the same thing about Columba if you remember that from the church age book so these were some of the most I would say most humble men used by God because we don't like to call people great but they were greatly used by God I'll say it like that all that's verses sorry that's all the way down to verse 28 and 29 now verse 30 let's read 30 and 31 I want to make a few statements on these oh good I'm doing great on time amen verse 30 acts 28:30 yes Paul made it to Rome Hallelujah God gave him his heart's desire amen and Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all what a blessing that came in unto him now look he's chained up to a a guard all 24/7 I think think about that just using the restroom think of how his privacy is think how his privacy is violated right he's chained up to him 247 and you think my he's a prisoner he's got court [Music] but the Bible says he received all I love that Jesus opened a door that no man could shut Hallelujah any in other words anyone that wanted to hear the word of God could hear the word of God what did Paul call that man that Deputy that wanted to stop somebody from hearing the gospel he said oh Child full of sub subtility thou child of this of the devil the Bible say uh the sorcerer man he said you're a child of the devil you're trying to hinder somebody word of God but now God puts him in a place he's a prisoner amen but anyone who wants to hear the word of God in Rome can come right to him Hallelujah remember that list we read last Sunday of all those names in there Rufus and them Phoebe anyone who wanted to spend time yeah anyone who wanted a personal interview with the prophet of God could get a personal interview Hallelujah for two years amen for two years anyone who wanted to be with the prophet of God could be with the prophet of godh oh it's beautiful he received all that came unto him so if God opens a door no man can shut that door that's how we look at our jobs right God opens the door nobody can shut it if God wants me to have this job nobody's going to stop it right verse 31 preaching the kingdom of God the Dominion the rule of God true see God wants the rule rule your life right now that's what the kingdom is when the Kingdom's in you God rules your life amen you don't do what you want to do you do what the kingdom of God wants you to do amen right that's why I like you know uh Charles Fin and those guys they were just trying to give their people an understanding you got to be fully devoted to Christ amen right amen the kingdom of God has to rule your life and teaching he was preaching declaring and instructing giving teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no man forbidding him amen nobody could stop Paul's sermon if he want to preach all night he could preach all night Hallelujah he would have special services or prayer services he could have them nobody forbid him amen he had full Liberty of the Holy Spirit In Rome Hallelujah am oh my it's beautiful he enjoyed two full years now Church remember uh Acts 20 says he gave the Ephesians the whole counsel of God in three years so I believe it was possible also Paul gave the Romans the whole counsel of God because he was there two full years and this allowed Jesus and his promise to be fulfilled that Paul would bear record of him in Rome amen he could be there two years and teach the gospel hallelujah amen God did that Hallelujah so after these two years he was either martyred by Nero or he traveled to Spain in other nations and then came back to Rome historians are are not sure we we're not given the record right even the book of Acts it ends it doesn't say anything would happen it doesn't say anything about Paul's death that means Luke who wrote the book of Acts probably passed away shortly thereafter or that was the last or Paul was still there during that time we don't know exactly what happened to us now go to uh Philippians 1: Paul being arrested helped spread the gospel it looked like he'd lost all his freedom but what he did he actually gained more freedom in Christ because through this imprisonment he wrote these five or six Epistles maybe six or seven see God shut his God shut his life down am and it looked like oh the worst thing would be the worst thing that could happen was I'd be a prisoner not when you're a prisoner for Christ amen oh hallelujah amen amen remember how many you remember brother Levi remember Levi the former Amish guy how did he get saved in a prison in a prison glory amen and how did he hear the message another former message believer he was was here he was in that Sanctuary before he went to prison and I preached on Saul and he he come after me crying in that parking lot he said I'm Saul I You Preach my life today other words I knew the word of God but I got an evil spirit on me and it ruined part of my life and then that man went to prison to witness to brother Levi and now Levi they built that big church you you seen that church they got a big church down there it's an Outreach to the Amish so let's see what God does with it amen amen it's amazing God had his brother donate all this land and then all these message people come in and built this big huge church it's only 45 minutes south of us Navar Ohio God did that amen no wonder that man's so grateful he was in prison naturally and spiritually but Jesus got him out hallelujah amen Jesus broke the chains Hallelujah some men God have to get in prison to wake them up amen amen and give them a chance to sit still just sit there and listen to the gospel amen amen a't that beautiful praise God God some men are so rebellious which is okay that's part of their testimony God has to put them in there just so they'll be still for a few moments to hear the word of God so let let let in other words let's build into our lives moments every day where we can be still and hear God's voice amen let's not be too busy for Jesus Christ hallelujah amen that's not be too busy we can't even brother you don't even have time to spend with your heavenly father let's not be too busy to ignore our father on Father's Day right natural and spiritual this morning I sent my dad all these texts because I know he doesn't check them but they come I saw them when I was there all the all the texts come up and he has to swipe them away so I sent like five or six pictures of him and I when we were children when I was a child you know love you Dad praying for you on Father's Day Philippians 1:7 even as it is meat for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart amen that's where I want to be I want to be in the heart of a Preacher Hallelujah I want to be the heart of a Christian in so much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel you're all partakers of my grace so look Paul says listen I'm in bonds right now I'm in prison while writing this letter remember we preach this verse 12 Philippians 1:12 but I would ye should understand Brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather for the the furtherance of the Gospel amen amen now we wouldn't think that we wouldn't think a a shipwreck we wouldn't sh think being stranded on an island we wouldn't think being locked up with a prisoner for two years with no privacy we wouldn't think that would be further the gospel but God's ways are higher than our ways amen think about how the gospel came to you somehow it had to come to you in a certain way where you'd finally receive it praise God God might had to chase you across the country to get your attention amen but God will chase you down cuz he's a loving father amen God might have to send you away from your family like some rebellious people might have to send you across the state where you don't know anybody to get you sad to get you lonely so then he can show you his mercy and his love Hallelujah but God does things many times different than what we think but it's a furtherance of the Gospel now think how many people have in ACR now have heard the message because we're here right how many online around the world have heard the gospel see all these things happen for a furtherance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen oh don't be discouraged friends Hallelujah be happy in the Lord amen verse 13 so that my Bonds in Christ are manifest listen in all the palace and in all other places so Paul was in a hired house but all remember all those all those uh prisoners that were with him and all the guards they took this news of these miracles of Paul and it spread through the entire Palace in Rome amen right everybody heard about this man who stoed up there and said thus sayith the Lord amen not a soul will die of all these prisoners and and all these centurions thus sayith the Lord now maybe it wasn't as that dramatic you know maybe he's tired I haven't eaten for 14 days th say the Lord but see it impacted them so much Paul said see this everything works together for good and because I was arrested all these things because of all this now the gospel has spread and now these people have hope and but they're without excuse as well Hallelujah some will believe some won't but thank God God furthers the good news of Christ amen hallelujah amen all of the Roman Palace that includes Nero the leader of the Free World even he knew about the Gospel of Jesus Christ verse 14 and many the bre of the Lord waxing Confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear so remember all these brothers coming to see Paul right on his journey and they knew Paul was arrested then they they saw Paul at his hired house it just strengthened them they thought my if that man can Rejoice while being persecuted if that man can sit under that anointing and write a Bible yet being a prisoner that makes me confident that Christ is with me amen if he's faithful despite his trials I can be faithful in my light affliction amen see this didn't discourage them it actually encouraged them see how it's so beyond our thoughts what if one of us would get arrested for being a Christian like and they beat you one of us would be in jail that would discourage us but Paul said this actually encouraged and made them more bold Hallelujah you know why CU they knew Paul wouldn't recant of Jesus Christ not only am I do I want God's blessings for my life but I also want God blessing even if I I lose my Liberty in other words I want I just want what God has for my life I'm not just interested in the blessings God's not my earing boy whatever he allows I'll serve him anyway Hallelujah whether good times or bad times Hallelujah I'll still serve God because he's God hallelujah amen amen what do they call he wasn't some fair weather fan or fair weather Christian that's what they call him brother in U in America so like at a football game if your team's winning you'll go but if they're losing you won't go to the game they call you a fair weather fan you only show up in Good Times that's what Paul's Dre I'm not a fairweather Christian right if it's nice out there's no trials I'll go to church I'll be happy I'll see God I'll see no we got to be faithful Christians no matter the good times the bad times whether I'm on top of the mountain or whether I'm in the Valley God is God Amen he deserves Our Praise Hallelujah I know it's hard but church we just got to give him a sacri rice of Praise amen glory you know I looked back at a few of my sermons from a few weeks months ago when I was going through my darkest trials and I was like wow I I saw my God was able to anoint me and then some of you said God spoke to you like I'm going through my wor some of my hardest trials and yet God's able to use me that's what I love about God that's what I love about gathering together it's like an escape from the things of the world that's righten the Bible says remember we looked at it last week peer pressure nature we get we're supposed to flee evil right but in a way we get to flee all of our problems and come into the presence of God and spend time with God and God will pour out his blessings upon us amen oh my I love it amen this is my this is my refuge this my City of Refuge amen I can come into the house of God give him a sacrifice of praise and say God this is really hard but I give you a sacrifice and that's the kind God loves hallelujah amen thank you Jesus so made them more bold to see Paul chained to a prisoner but yet he's still preaching the gospel you know some people criticize preachers you know like I heard one time I heard two occasions there's a preacher in uh England in the message and he's in a wheelchair and he he's got like a disease and and uh I think it's muscular distrophy or uh it's either MD or Ms I can never remember the difference but he'll go to the pulpit and they got to come all he all he can really use is his hands in his mouth everything else is lost its ability to move he'll come to the pulpit and while he's preaching they have to somebody has to come by and wipe the spit that comes out of his mouth and I've heard people criticize that man I would say no I would try to encourage that man because he's giving God all that he has what if you had that disease right it's easy to criticize people when you're not going through the trial right that makes if that makes me think if that man can preach what can I do I got the whole use of my body what should I do I admire Faith like that people criticize and then another man I've been talking to he's blind n physically blind and people have criticized and say why don't you believe for your healing well why don't you believe for it have you ever been blind before I I take courage he just sent me a message this week he said brother Jesse I just wanted to send you a message of me singing and clapping because it's through your dance sermons that I'm able to clap now he's like singing I'm one of them just it's a seven minute long audio of him praising God he said brother Jesse that was just for you I said glory amen if there's anything I can do to help you praise God that God use me to do it Hallelujah he said me brother is it okay to really clap allowed for Jesus I said yeah but don't injure your daughter's he's not married though I said be careful sometimes Zales up our wisdom but look at this it made them more confident to see a preacher in Chains yet still happy about the gospel hallelujah hallelujah some preach Christ even of envy and strife that's the only reason that go to the pulpit was cuz they're envious of other people or they want to have Strife with other people blessed are the peacemakers for they shall see God Amen and some also of Good Will that's what I want to be I'm going to be a preacher of Good Will I want the best for every [Music] person now sometimes I got to attack some people by name know you know out in the interet internet land but I want to have Good Will towards all those who will repent amen and of course that's a warning for those people who got to call out it's a warning verse 16 the one preached Christ of contention not sincerely see there's a lot of insincere preachers supposing to add Affliction to my bond they were preaching against Paul see he's a prop he calls us a prophet but he's in jail he's chained up to a prisoner how could he be a real man of God but the other kind of love you love your brothers when they go through trials you try to feel Lord you try to feel something what are they going through have I ever gone through that right how can I criticize them how could I if I never gone through that how can I criticize them knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel so Jesus sent him in there to defend the gospel amongst the Roman Palace right to defend it to show that it's real amen it's a living it's a Living Word God is a living God hallelujah amen remember these men had they had power over their wives and children they could have them executed the men most of those men in those days the the the philosophers brother William you know this most of the men those days had uh little boys that they would abuse that was that was common they would just take them around with them and abuse them it was sick and Paul says he comes there he saids husbands love your wives yeah and yet these men are used to have they can get rid of their any wife they want they and have anything they want and Paul said love your wives as Christ loved the church give yourself for her they were used to just using them how they I me use this for my pleasure use this selfishly and Paul that's what the Bible said he turns the world upside down amen that's what the gospel does Amen turns your life upside down Hallelujah turn the culture upside down I heard a preacher say look at it now most of Rome now still believes in the marriage and wife of the husband wife marriage the way Paul set it up so who is more powerful Nero or Paul oh Paul was cuz he spoke The Words of Christ hallelujah amen here we are 2,000 years later we can see which man was more powerful which man really had power oh Church you got more power than you when the Holy Ghost is in you Hallelujah then all the leadership and the human government you've got more power in you to turn the trajectory of your family upside down and change Generations Hallelujah that's the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen amen like I said my dad left me but I'll never leave my sons I'll never leave you Malachi where's Z sleepy guy I'll never leave my sons and daughters cuz the the the my world's been turned upside down Hallelujah that's just one example all of us got those we have to take the way we were raised the way we're treated we got to turn everything upside down right women got to learn to submit and not to be the boss right and Men got to learn to love and not be a pushover is that right I mean and children got to learn not to be the boss children got to learn to be obedient the first time children Hallelujah turn it upside down amen yeah I know all your friends even as adults our friends I know they do that that that has nothing to do with us we're a holy nation we're A peculiar people hallelujah bought by the precious blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen we live completely different we live by the power of Christ am amen Verse 18 what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or truth Christ is preached there's my hour now this is quite an interesting statement I wrote this down in my Bible Christ has preached and there therein do I Rejoice yeah I Will Rejoice so Paul said whether preachers are insincere or sincere I just Rejoice that Christ is preach right but now what does Paul also say earlier 10 or 12 years earlier he said if a man Chang one thing about the gospel he's cursed isn't that something that that's what struck me brother yes I don't know about that one that's a good question in one place Paul says they're curse but here says but here he says well I Rejoice at least Christ is being preached yeah right and to me that means even if they're in a church with an insincere preacher insincere a contentious or envious preacher at least they had a chance to hear the name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen because where jesus' name is spoken Jesus could be there amen hallelujah he might come in there and rescue them hallelujah oh at least they get to hear the name of Jesus I love what verse 19 says for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer amen I know God's going to deliver me church and it delivered whether by life or death I know I'm going to be delivered Amen to the next verse verse 20 according to my Earnest expectation my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death amen amen see I'm going to be delivered you're going to pray for me he's telling the Philippians you're going to pray for me the Romans coloss everybody's praying for me and I know God's going to hear your prayer I'm either saved through death or I'm saved and I get to be a free man but either way I'm going to be saved oh what a mindset that is either way I love it either way I win yeah am because I'm fighting a battle that's already been one amen either way I win Paul says it later uh yeah vers 21 for to me to live is Christ and to die it's gain either way I gain brother William that's what Paul was saying amen whether I live I win the people get more preaching I get to be with them more comfort more love or I get to die I get to go be with Jesus amen oh my either way I win hallelujah amen and think about that if we live with that mindset either way I win whether the good thing happens bad thing either way God's going to be glor God's going to be magnified in my body amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord I was looking up to the clock but there's no clock one historian said this he's talking about the difference between Paul and Nero remember Nero eventually said you're going to die by execution Nero had the life of the Prophet his hands in one way but really it was in God's hands amen like Jesus said you have no power over me unless it was given to you of the father right and he said this is your hour this is the hour of Darkness do what you do he said do quickly told that to Judas right but it was for the whole the whole group Paul realized anything that happens it's all according to the plan of God because I'm called by God I'm a servant of God amen amen Christ is going to be magnified in my body yes this historian said one day men will name their sons Paul and and name their dogs Nero is that beautiful I've never seen a dog named Paul I've seen some dogs named Jesse though some people at school had some dogs named Jesse that's a bad name for a but look even in those days they could see who is the real man with power Paul's walking up there he's got all those scars on his back when he gets his judgment sentence he's in Chains and he's under the anointing of the Holy Ghost Nero stands there with all his gold on and his all his uh just all of his decorations on and a historian could look at that and say which is the real man of God who's the real man there who will have a lasting impact on the world St Paul amen hallelujah and when Nero had him killed he was more alive than he'd ever been before I love that thought Hallelujah he thinks he killed him but actually he's more alive than he ever has been Hallelujah he left this Earthly house here but he went to his Heavenly house a house Eternal in the heavens Hallelujah an eternal house prise God where that body will never die am oh yes Lord I just was listening yesterday to brother Ram in the fist seal brother talks about going down the current of time and he said I used to be afraid of death he said because I think I'd see brother Neville and he'd just be a white cloud floating there and he says I couldn't talk or shake his hand so he said I just Float by and say hi brother Neville and brother I wasn't scared of that I was afraid he said not that I was afraid to be lost but I was afraid I couldn't he said I couldn't hug him like a brother I couldn't he said all I've known was being a man he said so I was afraid I wanted to be like a man but then when brother went beyond the C of time he had an out of Body Experience Hallelujah because Paul said whether I was in the body or out of the body only God knows Ezekiel had Out of Body Experience amen Ezekiel left his body remember he was praying with the uh there's a river chabar he left it God picked him up by his spiritual hair and carried him over to Jerusalem Amen brother Randon comes out of his body he sees himself laying by his wife cuz remember he was laying like this he said boy I'm 53 years old I sure hope God will let me do something for him someday I haven't done anything for the Lord you ever lay like that in bed said God I wish I would do something for you can I do something for you Lord he said he comes up he sees his body down there he bit his finger no I'm awake but notice that was a spiritual finger from a spiritual body that's right right and then when he got over there he said the women came to him first he hugged them my precious brother my precious brother he said but there was no sex glands and then he said after that all he said his wife come up he said surely she'll say oh my husband she just said oh my precious brother hope he said well that's strange and then the men come running he said they all had white robes on same robes he said but they all have different hair colors some are blonde some are black hair some are brown hair he said they all were barefooted out there no wonder we like going Barefoot around outside and they said my precious brother my precious brother and he said I could feel them he said just like now except it was more real remember brother said he said the things that are unseen are more real than the things that we do see Hallelujah so Heaven is more real than this right here is more real I can really feel that right Heaven's more real than that Hallelujah and the Bible said it's not far from us hallelujah amen oh my glory and there's multitudes waiting over there and they're resting on the fact that we're preaching Paul's gospel amen amen glory they're resting on that that's right brother said when I come back I wish I could just make people go there that they wouldn't miss it he said but I just got to keep preaching the gospel y amen hallelujah what a testimony church that God has given to us amen I want to share this one uh thing I learned from the scripture very simple how many remember when I looked at Rufus last week remember Rufus Rufus was mentioned by Paul in Romans 16:13 he said salute Rufus he said chosen in the Lord L and his mother and mine also you ever do a study on Rufus if you got your Bible go to Mark 15:21 Case you could read that for us no pressure Mark 15:21 take your time I was just looking at some of these names and church if this is a real connection here this is a powerful story why would Paul call out Rufus and his mother right they're in Rome why would he call them out UHA they compel on Simon a sirenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of Alexander and Rufus to bear his cross Rufus Alexander so on the day Jesus Christ was crucified the weight got so heavy he fell to the ground and he couldn't bear his cross anymore and the Roman soldiers said you come carry his cross I love that song by great great bolts God have mercy on that man and who do he call Simon the Siran sir sirene is 500 miles from Jerusalem it's right at the tip of Africa in the sahare desert so he's a black man remember all those there were 17 Nations that would come in right like on the day of Pentecost sirene and Capia all these nations Rome Italy they'd all come in for these festivals and Simon the sirene was just there to worship Jehovah and his sons were with him Alexander and Rufus hallelujah praise God and Rufus is probably the same Rufus Paul greets there in Rome right so Rufus saw his dad come over and pick up the cross of Jesus and church now what do you think that did to him right and Jesus had they just have to beat Jesus along to walk but rufus's Dad is carrying the cross God help us amen amen to take up our cross and follow Christ hallelujah amen Rufus saw that Rufus saw his dad Carry the Cross all the way to the top and then no doubt they push him away get away and they laid Jesus down and they pound the nails that's why when I got the Holy Ghost that's why I saw the side view the pound the nails pound the nails and Rufus and Rufus little boy and Alexander his brother are there with his dad Simon the Siran watching and they lift him up and they see Jesus crucified I believe also Rufus probably saw him resurrected amen right cuz he would have been right there and he appeared under 500 at one time hallelujah praise God fast forward 30 years later Paul saying salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord he was chosen to see his dad Carry the Cross of the Messiah he was chosen to watch Christ crucified and then see him resurrected hallelujah amen and then Rufus would to saw that same Christ Living in St Paul hallelujah praise God the same Jesus I saw crucified Rufus would say I see him working through Paul why he's got the same message the same word the same Holy Ghost the same power amen no wonder Paul said greet him and his mother who's been a mother to me how could rufus's mom serve Paul because she knew Paul was preaching the same gospel that Jesus gave him oh praise God the same Jesus they saw crucified and Resurrected amen is that powerful praise God amen amen so can you imagine in the two years where Paul's receiving people they get to knock on the door yes come in it's Rufus and his mother God chosen Rufus my brother chosen in the Lord not just for salvation but to see salvation to see the cross to see the the nails go in to see him cry my God my God why has Thou forsaken me to see the the the sun go out to see the lightning and the earthquake to see all that no wonder Paul could say that's a chosen man in the Lord oh Church may God help us to see spiritually with our spiritual eyes to see the death barrial and resurrection of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen but this man had seen it Rufus had seen it with his own eyes I imagine Church what I imagine Rufus would to come there and said I encourage you my brother Paul stay true stay faithful to the word of God your arrest has been such a blessing to us because we've had two years all of us that want to see a sister Phoebe come in there they all come in there they get a time with the prophet of God imagine Rufus come in there and said Paul no matter what happens be ready to give your life like our savior did amen because I saw it with my own eyes I saw Jesus he would get slapped but he would not slap back I saw him get kicked and beaten but he did not hit back in other words Rufus could say Paul be ready to give your body as an offering unto God because Jesus was the Lamb of God the offering of God slain from the foundation world but had to be crucified for our sins Hallelujah imagine Rufus said I've seen it I've seen what it looks like you just take it take the abuse take it and be an offering for the Lord Jesus Christ because he became an offering for you oh yes Lord I've seen it with my own eyes I was chosen Glory I was chosen to see it with my own eyes imagine that word from Rufus is probably what Paul echoed when he said for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand yes Lord Jes these are his last words he wrote before he died I have fought a good fight I finish my course I have kept the faith Hallelujah henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all that also love his appearing how many love Jesus is coming back Hallelujah let's stand to our feet God gives us the right friend friends at the right time God sends us the people that we need to talk to the people that need to impact us God sends it at the right time God sends sermons at just the time we need them how many believe that God sends Our Guest preachers God will have me preach things trying to follow leadership of the Holy Spirit he sends it right at the right time and we need it by his grace Jesus as we our heads how many say Lord help me to give my life as an offering to Christ Lord Jesus and with this with this desire that it would further the gospel like Paul God Sease your hands let's have a word of prayer father God we thank you for today Lord God lord these are amazing words from an amazing man but only because Lord you are in him
