I like to look at the purpose series part 7 tonight I'm gonna try to keep a little shorter I was kind of sick yesterday because I just wore myself out all week you know so I just I told a man I said just shorten a song service a little bit and I'll try to short my preaching a little bit like this morning so I was almost I was sick and then just kept asking God to help me and then finally yesterday I came out of it and just thankful feel a lot better today by God's grace God is good Church God is good amen so I like to go to first Corinthians 4 1 and 2 and like to look at part 7 on this purpose series we're looking at the next metaphor that God gives for our lives remember we said on Wednesday from what I found I found for metaphor so far God's view of what our life is like like a race it's like a test and today when we look at tonight it's like a trust God has given us a trust as a steward something we've got to be accountable for and be responsible for I know a lot about racing and I know a lot about taking tests I'm a schoolteacher now Trust is a little bit of foreign to me you know I was born with nothing very little financial but of course learning to deal with that as time goes on so I'll try to use an illustration from school Lord winning but 1st Corinthians 4 1 and 2 but to read from there let's read a 3:1 together and then I'll read verse 2 1 2 3 then man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God are adverse to just myself moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful amen let's just bow our heads here again father Lord we just come reverently lord thank you for this word we just want to be faithful Lord God we know ultimately Lord all faithfulness is in you lord you're the faithful one Lord the Bible says Jesus Christ is the faithful witness Lord God thank you lord you lead in faithfulness help us Lord this service Lord to catch the mind of Christ Lord as we said this one let's receive it and become it father for your glory becoming more and more into thy image taking Lord full preeminence Lord may you take for that full preeminence in our lives in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you being seated there I'll try to take 45 minutes again like I did this morning and one little did you notice I went a little bit over or in about 55 minutes so I just I don't know why I just got to take five or ten more minutes but God is good and this thoughts been a real blessing to me I do have some quotes to show and some slides so I like to show those and I'll be taking like I said some thoughts out of the Purpose Driven Life it's been a really good book I'd encourage anyone to read this book just got to watch out for the Trinity suggestions there's only two of them it's a great book but I'm gonna preach a lot of it so you know I mean you don't want to read it you don't have to I tell you there's another book coming out you want to read that one no [Music] no but it will give you it like I said they'll give you a lot of good in-depth and I cite everything there's there's 32 citations in there so if you ever want to find anything I sit on you know eisah right here it's online and this gives you a good place to stand there son excited excited so let's look at part seven you know I stopped I stopped giving them you know different titles cuz they just there's so many different things I wanted to cover on each one but I do want to look at the stewardship today by the grace of Lord and I'm gonna need my calculator because I found out how much of modern-day talent is so let me pull down my calculator so I got it okay I just found it online there showed all this research with citations I'm like man that's a good so I think it'll open our eyes hopefully little more by God's grace so we did our text and we're looking at stewardship and so we looked at from Wednesday remember there's for metaphors God gives us of our purpose in life and we saw how it's a race where we'd like to run a race like I said know a little bit about that I was a four-time state champion in racing I was a two-time runner-up and rate three-time runner-up in racing so I know a little bit about racing God just gave me that ability you know brother man makes a statement he said if you're a runner he said you cannot break the rules he said you've got to abide by all the rules or you're gonna mess up but man said that's a proverb in life if you're gonna play the game you got to follow the rules and there's never one time I had a false start so God gave me a natural ability to race I always waited for the gun I was always a very patient runner and God was always with me in that but it was training it was everyday training I took one day off I took Sunday off you know we'd always take sunday off but you had to train every other day now most athletes do seven days a week now you know just to stay fresh or I'm trying to keep their flexibility but we saw that and Paul says you got to run a race with patience you gotta lay aside any weight that easily beset you so that shows we're not doing a sprint and we might do a sprint when the latter rain falls but right now it's a marathon it's a marathon because it's a patient race mag knows about marathons I don't know anything about a marathon I should ask man to prepare a few words for us because I know how much he likes to speak and I just did but just to kind of give us an idea of his training you know I know we talked about it briefly I'm not sure how dedicated and I'm not sure maybe over dedicated he was you know some people can over train I'm not sure which side he was on or maybe it was right down in the middle but a marathon is no joke and that's what we're running today by the grace of God and we just got the lay aside anything that's hindering because it's easy to be hindered by the Bible said that the sin that death easily beset us so we got a look at what it what easily trips us up in our walk with God is our impatience is it our anger is it our depression or you know what are we battling not ours but the devil's depression what did we battle that's what's the easy thing that we easily fall into that's what we got to lay aside we've got to get victory over that and then we saw how is a test and I got a few more things I want to finish up on a test I just thought this was a good thought while I was reading it I think the Holy Spirit quickened this to me I want to share a few more thoughts on the test as I was meditating on this you know church we have daily tests we have to pass and will you pass these each day there's a test for your flesh the Bible said crucify the lusts of the flesh and the affections they're up and church that's an everyday thing sometimes it's a multiple times a day thing right I mean you've got to crucify like us in the morning you want to have some sugar in the morning you've got to crucify that right if you're gonna stay healthy or if there's like a sensual temptation like with lusts or something that may happen in the morning brothers that could happen in the evening to I'm sure our sisters battle these things too but you could come multiple times like so there are daily tests you know constant tests with the flesh and then the spirit you've got to die daily and that it's not it's not an option like like it's not like well I can I don't have to test that today I'll have a day off of test there's no test today now you have that at school I the other some days I don't give tests believe it or not but Paul said there's there's no skips for that you have a test every day are you gonna die to your will or gonna live to your will it's a daily test no days off for this test right and I found Church the last couple weeks I've just found this when I've got up the very first thing I do after you know brush your teeth or you know go to the restroom or whatever you got to do I've just gone right to my knees trying to pray first and it's just been such a help to me the last few weeks I've been doing that and it's really really helped me to die daily whether I feeling it or not you know sometimes I'd wait till I felt like it but I've just found that's just the first thing you got to do just pray and die daily also you've got to eat the daily bread the word so you have to find some time to listen to brother Branham or you can listen to your pastor again or if you don't have this live stream you know stream another passion but it's got to be careful with other pastors because most of time God gives that pass through the food for their congregation but if it's something else you know I mean there's special one you won't listen to that's that's it's okay but you got to be careful because Satan can use that where you get discontent with what God's given your home church right you don't be stealing food from another flock so you gotta be careful with that but but what I'm saying like let's say you're letting the Holy Spirit to go listen to something and then you're tested on that later you know it could be so you got you just want to be you just want to make sure you eat daily that's a test and then the Bible said be renewed daily in the spirit of your mind so that renewing that renewing is like like the Transfiguration timeout Transfiguration Jesus was transfigured he went from a normal man to a man that looked like the sunlight and that's what the mind has to do your mind or your mind in the morning usually wakes up but you just got a dark mind maybe a negative outlook on life and you've got to stay in the word long enough so the light turns on amen you got to stay it you got to stay around long enough so yeah you know in your mind you got to keep saying with the word until you can pull up the shade and the light can shine through and now you got a good outlook on the day oh it's Monday but still gonna be a good day on Saturday you know it's Friday you know everybody excited about Friday or Saturday thank God for the weekend but on Tuesday Wednesday now my heart stays Thursday you know you gotta open that up and let our mind we transform and let the light of Christ shine in so see there's daily tests that we're not gonna be able to get away from we've got to pass them every day praise the Lord so you better study up you got tests every day you better study up better be ready teachers gonna give the test right she better be ready you better stay in the Word of God like you're doing today by God's grace I'm gonna sorry wrong book it's the one you guys to hear right here the Word of God so I just want to pass that along it struck me as I was reading like oh my that's right like this like a test and there's daily tests and we got to make sure we overcome them by the grace of the Lord now let's review I went back and I was going through the notes and I think I've got 300 slides now on this series so I was just looking at a few of them I like this thought from chapter 1 you're not going to discover your life's meaning by looking within yourself most the time because the Bible said your heart is deceitful now verse this is for like us someone who's either in the flesh they're saved filled with all the ghosts in their flesh they can still be deceived sometimes and not not away from Christ but they can still make mistakes but someone who's not even saved this is an awful thing to do because when their hearts deceitful above all things they base their decisions on their emotions or feelings so they're looking they're looking in themselves so what am I supposed to be and that's what you see people doing today what am I and people sad but people are saying am i a man or a woman they're looking inside their heart right which which bathroom am I supposed to go into not is that awful people but they're looking inside themselves and I just what shop should I play with boys toys or girls toys you know this is just this is just awful but this is what the Bible said the Bible says a fool has no delight understanding but that his heart may discover itself see they they want to discover something on the inside but if their hearts desperately wicked or deceitfully wicked they're gonna discover the wrong thing see a fool delights in the wicked desires of his heart they just they're looking in the wrong place they're looking in there deceitful wicked heart rather than looking in the holy true righteous Word of God we got to find our will we got to find our desire in the Word of God that's right I just thought I'd go back to these because we're all you know we're all on a journey right we're on the race we're on a marathon and we want to run the right race we want to run the right paths would it be awful bang when you're running if you took the wrong turn on the course and it added another 20 minutes to your marathon how long was your marathon was it like a two hours or oh my goodness bless your heart say you imagine like added another hour to two that you see you don't want to run the wrong race you want to run God's purpose for your life so he the he that trusts in his own heart is a fool so I'm not trusting in my own heart you know tonight you're not you and I aren't trusting in our own heart we're trusting on what the Word of God says this is a faithful witness to trust in is God's Word see a fool trust his feelings well just search your heart and see what you're supposed to do that's such bad awful advice you got to search God's heart name ahead until he reveals his heart to you that's why Dave was a man after not as David was not after a man after I'm after we know it's in David's heart lustin you know all those things that was in his heart but he was after the heart of God and that's what we've got to be after men and women after the heart of Jesus Christ so see I just wanted to go over those you know remember we're chosen in him before the foundation of world we hear that a lot but it's true that we should be holy so our main purpose is holiness which means we're separate we are separated away from the things of the world that's a holy life and so that's what we are we're predestinated to adoption according to the pleasure of God's will or intention now I want to go back over this again that this is still review just for one more minute having made in us the mystery of his will so Paul tells the Ephesians their mature church that they knew the mystery of God's will and brother man tells us he reads this and he says the mysteries will remember how we hung on that how many was here this morning let's see how many are we struck on that or stuck on that the mysteries will now it is not just a little thing so see I don't feel bad bringing this back up I don't feel bad at all reviewing this I hope you don't either this is not a little thing to preach on this is a major thing to preach on the mystery of God's will for your life he says see that it's a mystery God's wills and mystery each man has to seek out the will of God for his or her self God's mystery oh thank you Jesus remember Nathan told David his the will of God for his life he said God took you from the sheep coat to make you ruler of my people Israel remember Samson's purpose you're gonna begin to defeat the Philistines that was God's purpose for Samson's life to begin to defeat them Jesus purpose was to save God's people from their sins then he might destroy the works of the devil amen oh thank you lord see we got to stay with God in holiness and then we find the will of God for our lives now let's get to this I told you I was gonna review that was just a quick five minute review now let's look at trust this trust here thought and then I want to get to this tail amount let me pull that calculator down again yeah I was shocked how much a talent was with the inflation and everything so in this in this thought here let me uh I want to read this paragraph I wrote on the upcoming book not this book but the upcoming book which I'm already having our sister from Alabama so editing some of the chapters already it's gonna be 13 chapters but she's editing two of them now I want to read that I wanna read this quote from of the brand but a talent according to this site with inflation is a hundred sixty thousand eight hundred dollars now that that sounds right because listen this is Jesus asking you at the end of your life what did you do with the one towel now that's one Talent so see like in your lifetime yeah you got a poor money into your mortgage of your rent you don't see that money I mean you got a but there's a certain amount you get to spend on what you want to spend it on and so I could see over the course of let's say 70 years you divide that by seventy what is that 106 I mean I can do right now that's you know the Bible said that's two thousand two hundred or almost two thousand three hundred dollars a year you get to spend on yourself right now all your other money goes to bills and groceries and everything insurance so I think that that's right that's about right and that's one talent remember there's one talent I think two talents and then five talents so let's let's look at those real quick so two talents will be three hundred twenty-one thousand dollars and I'm sorry it's 32 320 $1600 it's almost three hundred twenty two thousand and let's do 168 zero times five that's eight hundred four thousand dollars so Jesus gives I mean that's a pretty good a lot of money almost a million dollars that you would spend on yourself and Jesus says you're gonna have to answer for that so let me move to this and I I don't really want to strain your eyes I don't really want to do that but this is the book this is the first chapter sorry I went the wrong way let's have a section on stewards of the mysteries it's really small I don't really mean to do that church I was just going to read it God's mysteries are so valuable that Paul said all ministers of the gospel were stewards of the mysteries of God the Deaf the Greek definition of Stuart is a manager or superintendent since I'm employed as but public school teacher my mind cannot help but compare the job of a minister with a school district superintendent so in our district that guy makes $160,000 a year yeah you can make a lot of money in education in both occupations the worker is a manager of someone else's resources as accountable for their actions the minister handles God's word and people while the superintendent handles the community's facility so here's what my superintendent he has to handle the facilities and the financial and human resources my school districts buzz it budget is 50 million dollars a year so my superintendent he's got to take 50 million dollars and decide how much goes to transportation how much goes to food how much goes to pupil services how much goes to regular classroom teachers special education he has all this money's got to be a manager of it and doubt and Tahlia tout - everybody give everybody the right amount of money that they need can you imagine me responsible for that sum of money 50 million how would you do it this year well I spent 50 million dollars this year but in reality the gospel ministers responsible much more than that because superintendent is earthly riches eventually perish but eternal life with Jesus Christ is never-ending the fruits of a faithful ministry will be believers who will live eternally with Jesus walking on streets paved with pure transparent gold see our super didn't he you know he repays our pot parking lot with asphalt that's his job but what we're doing is we're trying to get people to walk not on the earthly asphalt but on the heavenly asphalt transparent gold that's what I'm trying to get you to do right now give you the natural asphalt but take you up to the heavenly heavenly asphalt we're trying to get you to walk on that by the grace of God so see I I must be found faithful the Bible said I must be found faithful I faithfully teach uphold and rightly divide the truth for Jesus says the truth will set here's free from sin I hope I'm not gonna do this tonight but I wish I could take this this microphone and and pass it around and everybody could say what the ministry God's given us how many things that set you free from would that be great to hear that maybe set you free from doubt or skepticism or anger or bitterness or laziness or whatever it is would that be great to hear what the Word of God is done amen that's what it's supposed to do because the truth will always set you free the minister spiritual labor makes them worthy of not honor but double honor the Bible says if the minister give me a faithful steward of the mysteries of God all right because false doctrine right eats like a canker or gangrene that flesh-eating disease so false doctrine is gangrene but true doctrine is life and deliverance and victory we're familiar with that yeah Jesus gives the illustration a household manager represents a minister in Luke 12 Jesus says a faithful and wise steward is blessed by God because he feeds his household their portion of meat in their due season God's truths our spiritual meals full of life-giving vitamins David says about God's Word o taste and see that the Lord is good and sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb jesus said his meat was to do the will of God or the Word of God the Church of Jesus Christ must be healthy growing in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ yeah did you know the Bible said that being God's steward is a huge responsibility includes tests sometimes stewards become discouraged or suffer persecution because Saint noise attacks true stewards through false ones as the children of flesh will always persecute the children of the Spirit in Paul's stewardship he experienced much persecution and often requested prayer that he would preach God's mysteries with boldness so think of that even Paul said will you pray for me that I can be more bold the gospel will you pray that I could have more bonus if he was experiencing battles what about us if he needed prayer to be bold with God's mysteries how much more do we need them let's be honest hurts we all need to be more be more bold with the Word of God praise the Lord and just share about the message Paul needed that prayer we need that prayer as well Paul said praying for me that utterance may be given unto me and then that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery the gospel for which I am an ambassador in bonds that there and I may speak boldly as I ought to speak stewards they like Paul of all need our prayers that they may declare the mystery of God boldly so if you ever need anybody pray for you can pray for me and I definitely pray for you as well by the grace of the Lord does that helpful by God's grace I hope that's helpful to see how we're superintendents preachers our superintendents but of course we're all stewards we all have something that we have to take care of and let me read this quote from brother Branham now this is brother Branham beginning of God doesn't call man to judgment first before warning him he said we find out his nature was here to always warn a man before judgment God always warned to one a nation before judgment he always gives his warning a reminder too we have a responsibility we are responsible and God has put us here on the earth for a reason and that reason he's put us here for were responsible to him for that reason you should go to him and find out what he wants you to do and the church said we should go to God say God what do you want me to do he said if you don't if you went to work for a man he just give you a job on a ranch or something other you just went out of the barn and just set down out there and say well see you must go ask him what he wants you to do and then do it if you're working for a man find out what your duties is praise God and if anybody is gonna tell you what your duty is it's gonna be God I mean God's not gonna hide it from you well God what do you want me to do my life you think God's gonna hide that from you God will show you God will preach it to you time and time and time again - you get it right God wants you to get your purpose he wants to reveal the mysteries right because he told his disciples blessed are you the mysteries are given to you to know the kingdom of God he wants you to know and then if our life on Earth here and then we should go to the one who put us here and Lord what would you have me to do what must I do why am I here I like that because this guy this guy's question is what on earth am I here for I like that because that's what brother Branham said he course keep riding in from other brandman the BAM said the same thing why am I here what is my purpose in life but answer you should go to God and ask that what do you want me to do at church I'm just feel like I'm starting to find mine by writing a book like this you know honestly I just feel like maybe I'm starting to find more of my purpose in life I'm gonna see what God does in the next year this thirteenth year I want to see what God does and see if that if that's a way to strengthen the Bride of Christ or is that a way to to raise faith and save souls I don't know it feels like it feels like I'm letting the Holy Spirit to do something like that if it's to be a housewife or dishwasher look at these examples a housewife and a dishwasher but I like what brother BAM says whatever God wants you to do that you'd be the very best that you know how to do it no matter how little no matter how little is you must do it a dishwasher I want to be the best dishwasher I can be that's what a Christian would say right what am I here for I'm gonna be a a witness in the kitchen right at the restaurant when I was 16 and 17 I worked at a Chinese restaurant I was a dishwasher and I tried to be the best one I could be so I can make another extra money I won't get China dragon and I would sometimes I got to miss church you know because I like that back then I would one like that now I'd hate that now but I go there and wash dishes and that was I tried to the very best job I could and I got the I got to be around people and no doubt God wants a godly dishwasher right there once the kitchen to shine the light of God's love right there no doubt about it housewife dishwasher lados later he'll say farmer the trouble there's each one of us wants to do the next man's job we all want to pack the ball as you say you see now with me Church I don't know anybody else writing books amongst my friends cam doesn't write him brother Brooks doesn't write them Samuel doesn't write them by the gym doesn't write them so I feel like I'm not trying to take somebody's position I feel like I'm letting the Holy Spirit to do something like this like this watch here every little movement is there in its place now every part of it can't be the hands now I only look at the hands of see what time it is but if one of them little wheels in there gets out of order then that won't keep the right time and that's the way it is with people we bought the body of Christ has got to be in their position in harmony see and then we can look around and see what the time of day it is see then the world's looking to see what it is see but they're watching you and if you're just a little hair spring mainspring whenever you are you do the very best job you can at that is the is the little hair spring important yeah is the big mainspring important yes every single part is important this is the last one I think yeah it's less cool and now because we have responsibilities we've got to answer to God someday for every man that's come on the face of the earth has to answer to God for responsibility and to many of us a stewardship we have to answer for this responsibilities of stewardship that's been committed to us by God I don't care what it is I said a few moments ago a housewife then be a genuine housewife that's right and if it's to be a farmer be a genuine farmer whatever it is that God has put you to do you've got a stewardship to do that you've got to answer to God for because it takes all these things to do it praise God does that help a little bit no matter what God's called you to do we've got to do it with all of our hearts praise God every little part every big part everything is so important praise the Lord now before I get the goals in life I do want to read a few things out of here I was looking at it previously I want to finish this part now life on here is a trust before we get to goals in life I got about 20 minutes okay that's fine I want to wear myself out or you have I stared with stay with me here by God's grace so this is the third one life is a trust it's a race the other one it's a test yeah test and now it's a trust so to trust God's given us something now our time on earth our energy intelligence and opportunities relationships and resources are all gifts from God and he's entrusted to our care and management we are stewards or whatever God gives us this concept of stewardship begins with the recognition that God is the owner of everything and everyone on earth amen like when God gives us a paycheck really that whole paychecks God's right because he gave me the ability to go to work amen so giving 1/10 is just giving it to God that's just giving 10% of the hundred he's given back to you he lets you keep 90 God's really nice isn't he he's a real caring God isn't he you take 90 I'll take 10 what a loving God the Bible said the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof it's all God's and church this and we never really own anything on earth what do you really own what can you take with you it's not good only your character that's all you that's really all you own that's part of your spirit and soul but what you let God mold into your human spirit what you got with which nature you let God put in your soul whether it's a it's a Holy Ghost nature or it's a foolish virgin which is a dormant nature the seeds ever not quickened right in the soul you know whatever one it is that's what we're taking with us he says God just loves the earth to us while we're here it was God's property before he arrived and God will loan it to somebody else after you die you just get to enjoy it for a while all the good and the bad right we bought our house that well you know we bought it from the man who built it there's a lot of things we like about the house there's a lot of things we didn't like to see but he just we just he just loaned the house this really bought it you know and we got to put up with everything that he did in the house some good some not so good you gotta fix it but you know I've got time goes on we're gonna give the house to somebody else everything's all alone even your children the Bible said they're a heritage for the Lord praise the Lord they're really God's and this was from the beginning member Genesis 1 what did God tell him God said be fruitful and multiply and he says I'm putting you in the garden now this is a different version of the Bible but he says bring it under the control I'm putting you in charge he told Adam so see the very first thing was a trust I'm trusting you to take care of the garden the first job God gave to humans was to manage property praise God so we realized that let me move on here it's kind of like wait have you ever rented out a house or you know you get most of you stay in hotel rooms do you just trash a hotel room no cuz if you're you trash it what's gonna happen they're gonna take that down payment or whatever however you do it's not yours right the hotel rooms not yours but you still treat it good because you want to be a faithful steward of it you want to be in good condition when you move out that's how our lives are here right if god Terry someday this this might not be a church sanctuary anymore but we want to leave it in better condition than we found it and so far we have and our landlord appreciates that she tells me all the time how much he appreciates us we want to treat it better than what it was treated before because we're just stewards of it we just were just gonna have to answer and be accountable for what God has trusted in our care in other words Christians live to a higher standard than the world we should treat everything we should treat our was better we should treat this church better we should treat our cars better we should care more about the things that are given to us because that's what they were they were given to us praise God now I'm not saying to go to extreme and worship your car and wash her car so they come into church on Sunday that's what brother Graham did and he said I wasting God's time he said that's the only thing he stole from God was time on Sunday morning when he should have been in church before he was a Christian he was out there washing his car to Sunday morning he said that's the only thing I ever stole my life was God's time that's I'm not saying do that but I'm saying take good care of it because it's something God gave to you that's what I've tried to do with our van I told the Lord of Lord if you ever give me a new car again I'll take care of it I have taken here that I give it washes all the time I cleaned out this morning before church spraying it down and fixing the mats and you know the trash out there I got to take care of it I don't want to drive around a piece of junk that's just a natural act to what we should be doing spiritually as well cleaning out all the trash out of our lives maintaining our spiritual health right Christians live a higher standard that's right now like this in the parable of the talents in Matthew 25 let's go there if you got your Bible it's just about 10 more minutes here I know it's familiar but let's go back and read that that was like we said we looked at that dollar amount and c25 the the parables verse 14 to 29 okay yes I was yeah my memory serves me right amen that's good I thought maybe it was one town of three tailed five towns but it was one two five yeah verse 15 and unto one he gave five talents to another two to another one to every man according to several ability and straightway took his journey he gave one man a hundred and sixty-nine thousand dollars can you look that another man $320,000 and another man $800,000 all right are they men I'm giving you $800,000 I'll see you in 30 years you guys are coming back nobody I'd like to see what you did with my money how'd you invest my money brother can you imagine $800,000 invested make something of it the worst thing he could do is what go buried in the ground that's the worst thing you can do that's the worst thing I can do is take my $320,000 and go bury it and put putting a safe and lock it away in my bedroom I'll stuck it in my mattress that's the worst thing you can do with what God's giving you and remember what did God say about the man who buried his talent in the ground you wicked and lazy servant so see it's a wicked and lazy thing to do is to receive God's talent and then don't do anything with it don't try to make more of it so see what our christians christians have to be doers not just hearers I mean don't get wrong we'd love to come to church and hear the word of God but we have to do something about what we hear Christians are doers when I get to those quotes I'll remind you brother BAM said don't just drift around in life he said have ambition have a goal know what you're doing right and the greatest thing we can do with our money is basically give the tithes and offerings and support the missionary work that's the greatest thing we can do because missionaries the highest calling in the Bible the Apostles the highest calling in the Bible and if you help support them you're helping finish the Great Commission but I like this let's go to verse 21 I like I like what the author sentiment pull out three things if you and I are faithful and we invest that $160,000 we're gonna get a three-fold reward this was so beautiful I just thought it was real simple but real beautiful verse twenty-one his Lord said unto Him well done thou good and faithful servant did you catch you that's the first reward that's called affirmation he says God affirms that you did a good job I want God's affirmation don't you well done sister Naomi well done Lydia see how haha I feel so good if Jesus says it well done he affirms that you did what you were supposed to do so the first reward you get is Jesus affirming that you did his perfect will now the next thing where's 21 now it's been good and faithful servant I'm sorry now it's been faithful over a few things I'll make thee ruler over many things so the second thing after affirmation is promotion glory I like that God promotes him because you were faithful with this I'm gonna make you I'm going to promote you to something greater praise God so see it's not so important to be promoted in this life church it's not some to be promoted now it's important now to invest and be faithful and all the resources God has given to us because the real promotion comes later in fact the more promotions you get in this life the more temptations there are and the church said Amen right the more promotions you get the more I'm a pretty big guy I'm a big shot how much them I must be really good I must be and then the pride of life sneaks in there now be honest Church I watched some of my friends get promotions and every time it takes them further away from Christ well they'll start and here's I've noticed it but then they pretty soon they buy fancier clothes fancier house then they start doing the things of the world more watching TV shows watching movies doing things they never would have done before when they didn't have as much money or much promotion or less titles it seems like everyone my friends I've seen that they get promoted they just get instead of get more humble they get more worldly now nobody here you know I'm not talking about you brothers or anything like that or myself or anybody like that but my friends that I've seen that are not in this church every time they get a promotion I can I'll give you some examples afterwards if you want I think if you want to talk to me privately I'll give you some examples every time see because if we can't handle that Saint no use it as a temptation so the first thing is affirmation in heaven glory then promotion you were faithful on earth now see because your faith with this now make your rule over much my goodness if I can just handle this little church here right here if I can just be faithful with preaching three times a week here I wonder what God will do later on I can just be faithful with those seven little children right there I can just be faithful and faithfully love them and do Bible time and pray with them and love them and do all I can do feed them and take if I can just be favor of those I wonder what God will do later on in life I just got to be faithful affirmation well done promotion I'll make you ruler over much the third thing is celebration he said come and share your masters happiness let's read it enter thou into the joy of the Lord Laurie oh now it's time to be a celebratory kind of person now I was time to rejoice member the proverbs 31 woman this is what she lives for she rejoices in times to come praise God this is what she lives for and we're part of the proverbs 31 church praise God this is what we live for this is when we rejoice oh when we cross over there's rewards waiting for us if we can just be faithful stewards hmm now like with the says here how you deal with natural money is a reflection of how you deal with spiritual things and that's true he said most people fail to realize that money is both a test and a trust from God God uses finances to teach us to trust him and the church said on that one because you always feel like we don't have enough finances so what we have to do constantly trust in God I'm laughing cuz I'm going through it you go it's just right season sometimes the money's up sometimes it's down god uses this to trust to guess to trust him okay there's nothing sent me to meet my knees like either somebody's sick with cancer died or a money problem right because you feel like Oh am I gonna have enough or am I gonna be going in debt what's gonna happen you know for many people money's the greatest test of all like the rich young ruler money is the greatest test let's go to Luke 16 I'm almost done I got this says I got three minutes about probably take a few more over well I'll try to be done give me a minute here 1611 Luke 1611 and just so you know Church the last few years I purposely increased my tithes and offerings because I've had I just had questions like for example should I tithe on every gift I get I get lots of gift cards from the parents so I've had so many questions on that I just purposely increased my tithes and offerings just in case I want to be I want to make sure I cover my bases like Jacob said I will give you a tithe on everything I receive now Abraham didn't say Abraham gave ties from all the spoils but Jacob said if you're my god and if you bring me back to my land or my homeland my promise that I will tithe on everything that I received I'm just debating priest I get you know I try to get more than what I because I I just want to be faithful I've got to remember that's not my money that's not my money that's God's money I remember what you do with the physical money is what you do with spiritual gifts if you're faithful with money then you're favored with a spiritual talent or some of ability that's true because it says right here Luke 1611 now the 310 my mom always read this to me always my mom was always reading this to me she you know she quoted on the NIV or whatever but he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also much verse 11 if therefore he have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon or that means money who will commit to your trust true riches if you can't be faithful with unrighteous dirty paper and I say that are unrighteous dirty digital numbers on your bank account statement on the PNC app if you can't be faithful with that how you gonna be faithful with true riches and what's true riches faith yes so the Holy Spirit that's true riches right because the Bible said God has made the poor of this world rich in faith haha Aran hands right there amen the true riches our faith and faith is one of the gifts of the Spirit never see them if we can't be faithful with paper or electronic money how is God gonna give us spiritual gifts there's not 45 minutes that's why I love this and this was this was speaking to me church this was like coming off the pages like my this is I need this I need this in my life he said this is very important truth Christ Jesus says there's direct relationship between how I use my money and the quality of my spiritual life that's true that's true how I manage my money my worldly wealth determines how much God can trust me with spiritual blessings true riches that is right that's what he just said Luke 1611 if you can do the money right how can I give you true riches and there isn't don't you think that's why I've god bless brother Branham with his spoken word so many times because he just gave money away he could had all kinds of ties but he just I'll just take a little salary so God's God bless him with the spoken word right if you can be trustworthy with money you can be trustworthy with the Word of God how you manage your money determines how much God can trust you with spiritual blessings that's true he says let me ask you is the way you manage your money preventing God from doing more in your life can you be trusted with spiritual riches Jesus says everyone let's go to Luke 12:48 last one let's say an or fee I'm gonna get you out of here I try to keep my word here Luke 12:48 so life is a trust it's a race test trust next time we'll look at life is a temporary assignment is a temporary journey I'm just the pilgrim and stranger in this land my real home is in heaven the future home oh thank you Jesus praise God oh man Luke 12:48 but he that knew not and didn't commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes so look Jesus says there's gonna be people in heaven that they didn't know better but they still disobeyed so they'll get beat they'll get beat with less stripes they're ignorant foreign to whom suffer much as this is what my mom read to me yeah right here she always said to me Jessie - for whom so much is given much is required she always tell me that and I'm like what are you talking about and she was talking about sports because I had a reputation you know my wife could tell you more about that everybody knew me everybody in the town knew me so she said you got to watch your behavior because everybody's looking at you 48 for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required so the more you're given the more responsibility God wants you to have and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more remember brother grams friends told him I'd hate to have to answer for what you're gonna have to answer for remember Jack Moore told brother Branham that and that's my brother man who said he said it drives me to desperation then Oh God I'm desperate give me the word on marriage and divorce and God did amen lorry see that's what we need to do see God what if what's my purpose in life why am I here find it right true riches do that be faithful with that and then God will reward you and promote you later on in heaven that's I want to live my life don't you I don't mind having a small church I love like I love all you Saints I don't know nothing bothered me at all I feel so free up here I can preach be like I could preach you know brother Aaron said that when he first came here he says you act like you're preaching 200 people I said well that's right because I just love preaching I love Jesus Christ I love this word and if the whole world turns me down and we all say together I'll still be the happiest preacher in Akron because I know it's not about this this is all gonna pass away I just have to be faithful with the mysteries of God that's all gonna do I just have to be a steward brother bang of these New Testament mysteries it's all guy dude I said boldness preach them and truth and direct all of you to the cross of Jesus Christ to the baptism Holy Ghost that's all God do if I can do that one day Jesus will look at me and say well done you were a tiny little preacher with one town of preaching ability he says well done good and faithful servant now I'm gonna promote you now you're gonna get that big church you always wanted or you always thought you should have or wonder why you couldn't have a bigger Church there but you know you know to me I'm content here but what I'm saying is that God will promote us to more there's 50 minutes life is a test and a trust and the more God gives you the more responsible he expects you to be let's bow our heads do you feel like you're more responsible now than you were last year are you as careful with your money now as you were let's say five years ago in terms that's why the last few years I've noticed I haven't been as faithful so and I wasn't sure about things I just increased my tithes and offerings and I'm not bullying for ties an offering what I'm saying is Jesus there's a connection if you can't be faithful with them that's your money how can you be faithful with true spiritual gifts there's a direct correlation Jesus says it's a talent the parable is a natural talent $160,000 of your lifetime it's $2,200 [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] one thing's for sure I mean 50 minutes [Music] obviously that life is like a trust [Music] thing everybody here would want to be trusted for britches the word of the Lord with the spoken word I hope nobody would say no I don't really want to speak the word nobody here was here father it's true Stuart we all wanna be found believe how much greater greater resources Lord I believe did I preach your word faith said don't drift don't be a drifter have a gold life have ambition in life know what you're doing in fact I'll read it now Lord Lovat said you're going somewhere what are you threatening for get some ambition Christ Alan help us miss sail to our destination that Christ the each of our desert [Music] nor does

talents you give it just not do this [Music] I want to be a faithful student want to be affirmed by Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's be faith lord I pray for the Saints now Lord as I hope they're praying for me God give them boldness to share the mysteries hardly have any time to talk to anybody of your people not anoint them this week to be both open up doors to opportunities to share about the church they go to or what they believe if Paul needed prayer for boldness how much more do I see Jesus Christ help us Lord to be like lettuce I say like this more let us see your face

God thank you so glad Lord we can get this time sitting at the feet of Jesus burning gorgeous because I'm standing here does it mean um I'm exempt from that I've been spiritually City businesses I
