[22:18] good timing and you have the day off
[22:20] right brother all glory amen
[22:22] before I forget there's your Bible
[22:23] brother stuff right forget anybody else
[22:25] needs a Bible let me know if you don't
[22:28] have a Bible let me know and also I have
[22:31] five more acts of the Prophet books if
[22:33] anybody wants one of those so let me
[22:35] know that's how I feel that's my
[22:36] responsibility as pastor to get the
[22:39] Sheep whatever they have need of if you
[22:40] need an mp3 player
[22:41] I'll get you mp3 player
[22:42] need a Bible you need mp3s or whatever
[22:45] need a tablet to listen to message let
[22:47] me know that's my responsibility I need
[22:49] to get the sheep what they have need of
[22:51] so they can serve God so let me know I'm
[22:53] happy to do that by the grace of the
[22:55] Lord I think that's it for announcements
[23:02] to a really important prayer requests
[23:05] the first ones from Jose he said his son
[23:09] is in prison and hasn't had food or
[23:12] water for two days so we really need to
[23:14] cry out to Lord tonight that God would
[23:16] give him grace I'm not sure where he's
[23:17] at he told me a few weeks ago but I
[23:19] forgot but we just need to pray and ask
[23:22] God God knows the situation and God can
[23:25] bring him out God just brought that
[23:26] pastor out of Turkey after 18 months God
[23:29] brought that pastor and that pastor I
[23:31] was watching it last night on Fox News
[23:33] the only little youtube video and his
[23:35] wife saw a vision of his her husband
[23:39] praying for President Trump in the Oval
[23:42] Office and was announcing it beforehand
[23:45] but then he got in prison and then he
[23:47] comes out and he came to the White House
[23:50] to pray and laid his hands on President
[23:53] Trump and said may the Holy Spirit guide
[23:55] this leader now I don't know what's
[23:58] gonna happen like I said I haven't been
[23:59] a big fan of her president or any of the
[24:01] last few presidents but it was striking
[24:04] because his wife had the dream or vision
[24:06] and it came to pass and the man I saw
[24:09] him he laid his hands on and you could
[24:10] see it on the YouTube there he said may
[24:12] the Holy Spirit give this man wisdom and
[24:14] guidance I thought how striking and so
[24:18] if God allowed him in there for a reason
[24:19] perhaps God allowed Jose's son in there
[24:21] for reason to glorify God to do
[24:24] something but let's just pray tonight
[24:25] and believe with all of our hearts the
[24:27] God will bring Jose son out of there and
[24:29] I guess yeah he's really sick I guess
[24:31] he's passing blood and all kinds of
[24:33] things so we really need Jesus Christ to
[24:35] minister tonight to him and we'll lift
[24:38] up him in prayer also this brother from
[24:41] Central America I don't remember which
[24:43] country's from it his name is Emilio
[24:45] his granddaughter has been constipated
[24:47] and I said brother you know how are you
[24:49] doing water and everything and he said
[24:50] yeah he said just something's wrong I
[24:52] don't know what kind of health
[24:53] conditions they have but he said would
[24:55] your church lift up this
[24:56] little girl in prayer who's constipated
[24:59] and having a hard life
[25:00] I said yes our church will lift her up
[25:01] in prayer and believe that Jesus Christ
[25:03] can move I have a little testimony no
[25:07] yesterday I had a headache all day it
[25:08] just got worse
[25:09] I would felt like my head was gonna go
[25:11] out I just told somebody I was just
[25:14] speaking it in the name of Jesus Christ
[25:15] when I got home we were praying and I
[25:17] was speaking I was just quote and I said
[25:19] Jesus help me and by the time I went to
[25:21] bed it was gone I woke up today there
[25:22] was none at all I just want to thank the
[25:24] Lord for that it's the power of calling
[25:27] on his name and I was just saying I was
[25:29] just praying Jesus please that the
[25:31] stripes that you that you receive may
[25:34] that healing that you paid for come upon
[25:36] me and we've been reading through Christ
[25:38] the healer so it's all about divine
[25:40] healing so I thank God for my divine
[25:42] healing praise God so I surely needed
[25:44] that because sometimes in my past church
[25:46] I've had headaches for weeks it's just
[25:47] been two whole weeks at a time they
[25:48] never leave probably cuz I'm not
[25:50] sleeping enough or something like that I
[25:51] drink enough water I want to thank the
[25:53] Lord he gave me mercy last night so
[25:55] thank the Lord Jesus okay anything else

[33:34] great thoughts and a lot of wonderful
[33:35] things I do too want to just bring some
[33:37] of my thoughts to it like on the
[33:39] thunders and the seals I just kind of a
[33:41] remind the church what I what I am
[33:44] convinced by the scriptures about and
[33:46] also about the bride being awake and
[33:48] Christmas and all those things I kind of
[33:49] want to follow up on those things let

[33:53] appreciate all that's been preached but
[33:55] I'm the one that's laboring with you on
[33:57] the shepherd here and I'd like to give
[33:58] you my thoughts on that if you don't
[34:00] know it already so we appreciate all
[34:05] that's been preached like I said it's
[34:06] raised a lot of faith it's brought some
[34:07] wonderful messages I've been so blessed
[34:10] especially by that church age one and
[34:11] last week was so encouraging with
[34:13] brother Nathanael and we're so thankful
[34:15] brother Simon's labor what a what a what
[34:18] a labor in the kingdom of God to cover
[34:21] all those services so we're thankful for
[34:23] God's grace revelation 6:12 I just want
[34:32] to find the last one I preached on
[34:35] trying to find which part this was I
[34:37] don't know if I can find out I was gonna
[34:39] try to look real quick I don't think
[34:40] I'll find it but revelation 6:12 and I
[34:43] beheld and when he had opened the sixth
[34:45] seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[34:46] and the Sun became black as sackcloth of
[34:49] hair and the moon became as blood and
[34:52] the stars of heaven fell unto the earth
[34:54] even as a fig tree casteth her untimely
[34:57] figs when she's shaken of a mighty wind
[35:00] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[35:02] it is rolled together and every mountain
[35:04] and Island were moved out of their
[35:06] places and the kings of the earth and
[35:08] the great men and the rich men and the
[35:09] chief captains and the mighty men and
[35:11] every bondman and every free man hid
[35:13] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[35:15] of the mountains and said to the
[35:17] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[35:19] us from the face of him that sitteth on
[35:22] the throne and from the wrath of the
[35:25] lamb for the great day of his wrath is
[35:28] come and who shall be able to stand amen
[35:32] let's bow our heads for word of Prayer
[35:33] if you have a need on your heart why
[35:35] don't you make it known to the Lord here
[35:36] as we approach the Lord here tonight
[35:38] Heavenly Father my hands are raised Lord
[35:40] I have many needs Lord God and I asked
[35:43] Lord by your Holy Spirit you meet my
[35:44] needs nor administer to my soul minister
[35:47] to the souls and the minds and spirits
[35:49] of all the saints here Lord we're
[35:51] gathered in the mighty name of Jesus or
[35:53] we know all things are possible tonight
[35:55] Lord our faith is raised O God our faith
[35:57] is strong in you Lord so speak to us the
[36:00] Lord God continue to teach us the Lord
[36:02] God your word father and I ask God by
[36:05] your grace Lord that your spear would
[36:06] have preeminence here Lord you're the
[36:08] only holy one you're the only worthy one
[36:10] you're the only special one we exalt
[36:13] only you Jesus and father may we feel
[36:15] your presence and be benefited by your
[36:17] sweet spirit in Jesus Christ's name when
[36:19] the church said amen god I should be in
[36:21] C to praise the Lord I told my wife I'm
[36:24] gonna try to preach 45 minutes so I
[36:26] would see if I can do that I got a late
[36:33] night tomorrow night to you know some of
[36:34] these nights Wednesday and sword wear me
[36:36] out you know I have I will be workin 13
[36:38] hours tomorrow because I have
[36:40] parent-teacher conferences after work so
[36:42] you work a full day then I got
[36:44] conferences all night so I gotta watch
[36:46] my time tonight make sure I don't wear
[36:48] myself out so I want to get sick God
[36:50] knows I don't want to get sick I got too
[36:53] much to do for the kingdom of God to get
[36:54] sick I don't lay around and be sick I'll
[36:56] do something for Jesus with my life I
[36:58] don't do more and more for Jesus amen so
[37:01] let's look at this here the sixth seal
[37:04] which is part of our revelation series
[37:06] chapter 6 we'll look at this part too by
[37:10] God's grace I'm gonna be preaching a lot
[37:12] of quotes here from restraint would that
[37:14] what the Prophet says and I hope you'll
[37:16] be blessed tonight like I said if I have
[37:18] time I want to update you on a few
[37:19] things that are current events here now
[37:24] brother Branham says in the sixth seal
[37:27] he says and he begins by saying notice
[37:30] in the fifth and sixth seal there's no
[37:32] horse riders and there's no
[37:35] announcements and there's no beasts how
[37:37] many recognize that there's no horses
[37:39] and there's no beasts program says
[37:41] that's because the church ages are over
[37:43] and remember those four beasts for is
[37:45] the number of Earth right
[37:47] forced a number of all the deliverance
[37:49] all those fours and so that means the
[37:52] Holy Spirit was no longer ministering to
[37:54] the Gentiles on the earth there's no
[37:56] more fours there's no more beasts
[37:58] there's no more horse riders so in other
[38:01] words there's no more battle all that's
[38:03] going on on the earth is Satan is
[38:05] controlling the earth right during the
[38:07] Tribulation Period
[38:08] now of course Jesus has gone on brother
[38:11] branham said he Jesus will slip down
[38:12] from that marriage supper he'll slip
[38:14] down and reveal himself to the 144,000
[38:17] amen amen
[38:18] as the Holy Spirit is ministering to
[38:20] them after the two prophets have left
[38:22] the scene so we see that in the sixth
[38:25] seal there's no horse
[38:27] there's no beasts it's just the
[38:29] Tribulation Period and program said it's
[38:32] one of the long seals here notice how
[38:34] many verses it's one two three four five
[38:36] six verses which is interesting the
[38:39] sixth seal has six verses six is the
[38:40] number of fallen man but also the number
[38:42] of anointed man and so program calls
[38:45] it's one of the long seals quite a bit
[38:48] happens praise God and like what brother
[38:53] Branham says here he talks about how the
[38:54] the four powers were riding out they
[38:58] said to remember the whole thing is
[39:00] based upon two things one of them as an
[39:03] antichrist and the other is a Christ
[39:05] praise God and so we know the flying
[39:09] eagle is our Christ anointing for this
[39:11] day right and we know the Antichrist
[39:13] spirit is a pale horse rider today he's
[39:16] riding with spiritual death for the RAM
[39:18] said he'll take one more ride and that's
[39:20] when the mark of the beast is laid down
[39:22] amen when Satan fully comes in the pole
[39:24] brother Ram said he's taking one last
[39:25] ride that's when he lays his marked out
[39:27] upon this I'll say like this God
[39:30] forsaken earth because God is going to
[39:32] forsake the earth for all the times all
[39:34] the years they've forsaken him God is
[39:36] going to forsake the earth and let them
[39:38] cut them under the judgments of God
[39:39] that's exactly right
[39:41] I'm gonna have to see it said see it's
[39:43] either one of the other it's Christ or
[39:44] Antichrist well they have said there's
[39:46] no halfway Christians there's no drunk
[39:49] sober man there's no black white birds
[39:51] there's no sinner Saints you're either a
[39:53] sinner or a saint
[39:55] how many saints do we have here tonight
[39:56] you're either separated unto Jesus
[39:59] Christ as they say
[40:00] or you are still a sinner I'm glad to
[40:02] see that my life is separated in the
[40:04] Christ I'm thankful to see that I'm so
[40:08] soon in the Christ that's Satan's sealed
[40:10] out don't worry amen and then all my
[40:13] time all my free time all my love all my
[40:15] talents all my energy goes for the
[40:17] kingdom of God you're either born again
[40:21] you're not born again you either feel
[40:22] with the Holy Spirit or you're not
[40:23] filled with the Holy Spirit no matter
[40:25] how many sensations you had you ain't
[40:27] filled with the Holy Spirit
[40:28] you're not filled with it if you had
[40:31] been filled with it your life shows it
[40:33] goes right up to it see nobody has to
[40:36] tell anybody about it they see it
[40:38] because it's a seal amen hallelujah
[40:42] think about all the people that we've
[40:44] seen come in here and then say they had
[40:46] it but then fell away or thought they
[40:48] might have had it and then fell away but
[40:50] the whole time everybody can see it on
[40:53] somebody because it's a seal praise God
[40:55] your life is so sealed in a seals a mark
[40:58] and people can see if you're marked with
[41:01] the holy life or you're marked with a
[41:03] gospel life you're marked with a
[41:04] faithful life we should be marked with
[41:07] the power of Christ amen and now he says
[41:12] now these things were studying down the
[41:14] sixth seal is after the church is done
[41:16] gone these things are the Tribulation
[41:19] Period so just a reminder the fifth seal
[41:22] is a seal that takes place in the
[41:25] tribulation and so is the sixth seal the
[41:28] sixty of course is the Tribulation
[41:30] Period because remember in the fifth
[41:33] seals of tribulation seal as well
[41:34] because when the Jews cry out and say Oh
[41:39] have vengeance remember what did Jesus
[41:41] say Jesus says wait little season until
[41:43] your fellow servants your brethren must
[41:46] be killed so that they have to be killed
[41:49] during the tribulation period right
[41:51] 144,000 they'll be sealed in one place
[41:54] brother Branham says they'll give their
[41:55] lives in another place he says there
[41:56] there there spared but it looks like
[41:59] according to the fifth seal that some of
[42:00] them we're gonna have to give their
[42:01] lives I would think so
[42:04] so we know that has to be a tribulation
[42:07] seal after the rapture because Jesus
[42:10] tells them some of your brethren must be
[42:12] killed as well and
[42:13] the six yield now of course is the
[42:15] tribulation rapture program said the
[42:18] Eagle age though our age is coming to
[42:20] reveal and pick up these things and show
[42:23] them he said we find out in last night's
[42:26] service also which was the fish seal the
[42:28] great mystery opened with this seal
[42:30] which was absolutely contrary to my
[42:31] former understanding
[42:32] I was just presuming that it was right
[42:35] and then he talks about how he always
[42:37] thought the souls under the altar were
[42:39] the early Christians he said but we
[42:41] found out when the Lord broke the seal
[42:43] for us it's absolutely impossible it
[42:45] wasn't them
[42:46] for they were gone on to glory plumb on
[42:49] the other side amen
[42:51] so Brennan tells us that that's how it
[42:53] is and so brother Graham gain
[42:55] understanding through these seven seal
[42:58] sermons and remember first John 5:20
[43:01] says we know that the Son of God has
[43:04] come and has given us an understanding
[43:08] how many know that Jesus is in his son
[43:10] of God stage right now he was in son of
[43:14] man stage when he was on the earth as a
[43:15] prophet preaching and healing the sick
[43:18] but now Jesus is in the Son of God stage
[43:21] praise God hallelujah
[43:23] so right now we're we're offering
[43:26] prayers to the Son of God right and
[43:29] that's what Jesus is have you brought up
[43:31] on the scripture leave it up there Lydia
[43:32] if you can it's because because John
[43:34] says he the son of God has come he's
[43:37] already come and given us an
[43:38] understanding see the Holy Ghost has
[43:40] come and he's given us an understanding
[43:42] now son of man son of man already cave
[43:45] its son of God amen
[43:46] and the Millennium it'll be son of David
[43:49] praise God because they'll sit on the
[43:51] throne in the Millennial temple in
[43:53] Jerusalem and that's the City of David
[43:55] amen and you and I are we right there
[43:58] with him praise God how do you know
[44:00] you're married to the son of David ha
[44:02] hallelujah amen
[44:04] suppose that I gain the understanding
[44:07] and jeez and Paulette or John says the
[44:09] Son of God has come to give us an
[44:11] understanding praise God now we can see
[44:14] it now brother Branham now goes into the
[44:17] sixty I just hit a few of the highlights
[44:18] from the sermon as I've read through it
[44:21] of course and listened to him and
[44:22] listening to it this week now brother
[44:25] Branham says he notices any
[44:27] points out a specific verse notice every
[44:31] rich man is crying out in verse 16 for
[44:34] the mountains to fall on them
[44:36] can you imagine Donald Trump can you
[44:38] imagine Warren Buffett
[44:39] can you imagine Barack Obama these
[44:41] millionaires and Hillary Bill Clinton
[44:42] can you imagine all these millionaires
[44:45] saying rocks fall on us because the
[44:48] wrath of the Lamb is upon us amen that's
[44:52] how scary that's how much terror and
[44:56] wrath is going to be on this world that
[44:58] millionaires will realize there's no
[45:00] money
[45:01] I can't money can't get me away from
[45:02] this I'm going to go hide in a cave to
[45:05] try to get away from the lamb if only
[45:09] they'd realize that they've got a hide
[45:11] in Christ right now praise God that's
[45:14] the only way we're going to ever escape
[45:16] the wrath of God is to hide in Christ
[45:19] now I don't want to hide from him later
[45:21] I want to hide in him right now
[45:23] amen we must hide the Bible said our
[45:27] lives are hid in Jesus Christ wrote in
[45:32] look at these mighty men what have
[45:34] they done they've received the wine of
[45:36] the wrath of fornication of the harlot
[45:38] that's exactly the same class that drank
[45:41] her wine so all those who drink of the
[45:44] Roman Catholic Protestant church system
[45:47] they will receive the wrath of God
[45:49] they'll be the ones hiding in there
[45:51] they'll be the ones hiding in caves see
[45:54] we know we're not going to go hide out
[45:55] engage though we may have a minor type
[45:57] of persecution where the squeeze where
[45:59] it may have some type of persecution or
[46:01] a little persecution but it will be
[46:03] nothing compared to this amen because we
[46:07] have not far taken we don't partake of
[46:09] Catholic doctrine we don't partake of
[46:12] the Church of Christ doctrine or the
[46:14] Lutheran doctrine or the Methodist
[46:16] doctrine we partake of Jesus's doctrine
[46:19] amen but see because they partook of the
[46:23] wine of her fornication
[46:25] now they suffer the consequences and now
[46:28] they'll be in caves hiding out oh my
[46:32] mother have said
[46:34] it's doing these tribulation at the
[46:36] seven trumpets and seven vials and three
[46:39] woes and the woman in the Sun and
[46:42] casting out the devil the red dragon
[46:44] comes between these times during the
[46:46] Great Tribulation Period so I hope you
[46:48] catch his brother hand says as many
[46:50] times the trumpets and vials and woes do
[46:53] not sound until the Great Tribulation
[46:55] Period
[46:57] now that would strike yet if he if you
[47:01] if you know brother Rams clothes because
[47:02] earlier in brother Rams quotes he said
[47:04] the woes were the world wars
[47:06] so sometimes program says the war the
[47:08] woes the world wars but then other times
[47:10] he says the wolves don't take place to
[47:12] the Tribulation Period so what do we
[47:15] need brother Jesse we need the Holy
[47:16] Spirit to give us the truth if there's
[47:19] ever questions about quotes we leave it
[47:21] alone until the Holy Spirit gives us a
[47:23] vindication now I personally believe
[47:25] because I've been reading the scripture
[47:27] and the Holy Spirit's been speaking to
[47:28] me I really believe the woes were not
[47:31] the world wars because brother Brad
[47:32] never says it after the seals and he
[47:34] never majors on it he never causeth us
[47:36] said the Lord I believe all of those
[47:38] have to take place after the 144,000 are
[47:41] sealed and let me show you I go to
[47:43] Revelation chapter 7 because the Bible
[47:47] says it Revelation chapter 7 verse 1 2 3
[47:53] and after these things I saw four angels
[47:55] standing on the four corners of the
[47:56] earth holding the four winds of the
[47:58] earth and that the wind should not blow
[47:59] on the earth nor on the sea nor on any
[48:01] tree notice that Earth sea tree nothing
[48:05] gets hurt
[48:06] until after the 144,000 are sealed
[48:09] can you say men look at verse 2 and I
[48:12] saw another mighty angel ascending from
[48:13] heaven I'm sorry sending from the east
[48:15] having the seal of the Living God and he
[48:17] cried with a loud voice to the four
[48:18] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[48:20] earth and the sea saying hurt not the
[48:22] earth neither the sea nor the trees till
[48:25] we have sealed the servants of God in
[48:27] their foreheads oh isn't God so merciful
[48:31] amen God doesn't hurt to see the trees
[48:34] or the earth until his children have
[48:38] been sealed by the Holy Ghost that's how
[48:40] much God loves the Jews amen
[48:43] see that God's not going to let those
[48:46] Jews get destroyed
[48:48] that's not gonna let those trumpets blow
[48:49] until after his children are born again
[48:53] amen because look at the first trumpet
[48:56] go to chapter 8 look at the first
[48:58] trumpet in verse 7 8 7 revelation 8:7
[49:00] this is a to me this is how the Holy
[49:02] Spirit reveals the Word of God to me
[49:04] when brother Branham has you know two
[49:06] quotes that kind of contradict
[49:07] themselves we must but America the Holy
[49:09] Ghost will direct you to the word so
[49:14] sometimes he says the woes went were
[49:15] before
[49:16] sometimes the woes only happened in the
[49:18] tribulation period I believe the Bible
[49:19] plainly tells us the woes only take
[49:22] place during the tribulation period
[49:24] just look at verse 7 or chapter 8 and
[49:26] the first angel sounded that's the
[49:27] trumpet and there Flo followed hail and
[49:30] fire mingled with blood and they were
[49:32] cast upon the earth and the third part
[49:34] of the trees was burnt up and all grass
[49:39] was burnt up remember we read earlier
[49:41] God cannot hurt the trees until after
[49:44] the 144,000 are sealed you see that so
[49:48] to me the Bible has all the answers
[49:50] amen but they've said the Bible is the
[49:53] end of all arguments hey it is for me I
[49:58] hope it is for you amen I'm not taking
[50:01] anyone else's opinion now we take the
[50:03] prophets above everybody else's but
[50:05] every unit of theirs if it got in a
[50:06] reveal - we know it's revealed in the
[50:08] Word of God so just so you know sermon
[50:13] on that the timing of the tribulation
[50:15] next time Lord willing so that's a
[50:20] number that's after the seventh seal
[50:21] which is the day and hour which is the
[50:23] ending of the rapture at the ending of
[50:25] the Gentile dispensation and then
[50:27] shortly after that the trumpet the first
[50:29] trumpet blows and the trees are hurt but
[50:30] of course that has to be after the
[50:32] 144,000 are sealed amen
[50:35] alright next let's keep going here by
[50:42] the grace of the Lord now I want you to
[50:45] remember this brother Branham said he
[50:47] was trying to set up meetings to preach
[50:49] the trumpets in 1964 and he said he went
[50:52] into prayer and the Holy Spirit revealed
[50:54] to him why he couldn't he couldn't get
[50:56] the meat he couldn't he couldn't rent
[50:58] out the facility he couldn't get
[50:59] anything together and he
[51:01] his room he said this I went in to pray
[51:03] and I told the wife I'm going in and
[51:05] sincerely I knelt down before God to
[51:07] pray and he revealed to me seven seal
[51:13] and I've done preached it supernaturally
[51:18] glory see it's the hand of God the whole
[51:21] thing it pertains to Israel and we
[51:23] picked up that under the sixth seal you
[51:26] all have that how the persecution of the
[51:28] Jews so the trumpets didn't pertain
[51:31] anything to the Gentiles so God didn't
[51:34] have brother Branham preached a separate
[51:35] series on the trumpets because it didn't
[51:37] have to do with you and I Oh hallelujah
[51:40] that means we don't have to be on the
[51:42] earth when a third of the trees are
[51:44] destroyed we don't have to be on earth
[51:47] when all the mountains are overflow by
[51:50] water and all the millions of people are
[51:52] drowned and died and the third of the
[51:54] waters will turn to blood we won't have
[51:56] to be on the earth because it doesn't
[51:58] apply to us why because mercy applies to
[52:01] us amen salvation applies to us bloom
[52:05] suffering supplies us why because we
[52:08] believe in the blood of the Son of God
[52:10] amen
[52:13] that's God's grace to us the trumpets
[52:18] remember said God why can't I appreciate
[52:20] you said it don't even apply to the
[52:21] bride don't preach it to the bride
[52:23] you've already preached it under the
[52:24] sixth seal ha ha it's part of the
[52:28] tribulation don't spend your time
[52:30] worrying about that he said just
[52:31] preaching a couple sermons on don't
[52:32] spend your time on that because it don't
[52:34] even pertain to you amen hallelujah
[52:36] thank God for that
[52:38] and God had to reveal that to him glory
[52:43] see all these things were now we're
[52:45] studying right now is is after the
[52:47] church is gone these things in the
[52:50] Tribulation Period and I think it ought
[52:52] to be truly settled in every believers
[52:54] heart that this church never takes a
[52:57] tribulation period amen he says you
[53:02] could not put the church he said you can
[53:03] put the church in there but not the
[53:05] bride see the bride has gone on oh yes
[53:09] but RAM says again he said the bride he
[53:12] said but remember when these
[53:14] things happen in the sixth seal the
[53:16] bride won't be here
[53:17] just remember the bride is gone she
[53:19] don't have to go through any of it this
[53:21] is the time of tribulation or
[53:22] purification of the bride it's put upon
[53:25] her for her to go through it but not the
[53:27] bride he takes his sweetheart out of the
[53:30] way oh I'm glad I'm Jesus's sweetheart
[53:33] amen
[53:33] I know it might not look like it all the
[53:35] time I might not sound like it I
[53:37] certainly don't act like it all the time
[53:38] but because he loves me and forgives me
[53:41] he caused me a sweetheart
[53:43] neither did I treat my wife right all
[53:45] the time sometimes I treat my mistreat
[53:47] my children but at the other day when I
[53:49] we say we're sorry I'm still everybody's
[53:51] sweetheart amen and so are you right in
[53:55] your home and your family so are you the
[53:58] sweet one see because God is a God of
[54:00] forgiveness glory it's exactly right now
[54:06] remember in the church age but brother
[54:08] man tells us the same thing he says how
[54:10] do the church ages Church ages verse
[54:12] comes the seals so those two pertain to
[54:14] the Gentiles after the seal he said out
[54:17] of the seals come forth the trumpets and
[54:20] how the trumpets come the vials and if
[54:24] you know the Bible out of the vials come
[54:25] two woes okay so see brother Ham tells
[54:30] us the order it's Church ages seals
[54:32] that's for the bride then you have
[54:34] trumpets vials woes and that's in of
[54:37] course the church age book by God's
[54:39] grace now let's get back to the sixth
[54:41] seal he said the sixth seal we find out
[54:46] here that nature takes a tumble the
[54:49] earthquake the Sun went black and the
[54:51] moon wouldn't give its light and the
[54:53] stars shook and fail and why everything
[54:56] happens he right at the time of the
[54:58] opening of this sixth seal right after
[55:02] the announcing of those Jewish martyrs
[55:04] the martyrs had had to be finished he
[55:07] says now let go brother and says here he
[55:14] says now
[55:15] see we're right close into that hour now
[55:17] it could be just at any time because the
[55:19] church is just about ready to take its
[55:21] flight but remember when these things
[55:23] happen the bride won't be here just
[55:25] remember the bride's gone she don't have
[55:26] to go through any of it this is the time
[55:29] of tribulation he said on purification
[55:31] on the bride okay I already read that
[55:33] one his sweetheart he's a good
[55:35] sweetheart all the way I'm sorry I had
[55:36] that on there twice my fault
[55:38] amen but you believe that don't you that
[55:41] God is going to keep his bride from the
[55:44] the tribulation go to first
[55:45] Thessalonians 5 I'll just go there real
[55:46] quick Church there's no devil in hell
[55:50] that can tell me that we're gonna have
[55:52] to go through the tribulation period
[55:54] there's no devil in hell because 1st
[55:57] Thessalonians 4 ends with what the
[56:00] rapture the shout voice the trunk now
[56:02] immediately after the shot voice trunk
[56:04] look at chapter 5 verse 1 and remember
[56:09] there was no chapter divisions when Paul
[56:13] but for us to have shorter you know
[56:16] short of things to read look at verse 1
[56:19] but of the times and the seasons
[56:21] brethren you have no need that I write
[56:23] unto you now what times of what the
[56:27] rapture because you just got done
[56:28] talking about the rapture for you
[56:31] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[56:32] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[56:35] night for when they shall say peace and
[56:39] safety so see we know what the world's
[56:43] going to be saying at the time of the
[56:44] rapture they're gonna be saying peace
[56:46] and safety we need more peace on the
[56:48] earth let's get peace in the Middle East
[56:50] they've been saying that for years
[56:52] let's get peace in Syria let's get peace
[56:55] Iraq you know is get peace everywhere
[56:57] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[56:59] as travail upon a woman with child and
[57:02] they shall not escape but see he's
[57:06] coming as a thief to catch away that's
[57:09] that Greek is the word harpazo
[57:13] which means to snatch away he's gonna
[57:16] snatch away the bride is gonna escape
[57:18] she's gonna be snatched away from the
[57:20] day of wrath glory exactly right that's
[57:25] what the word means harpazo look it up
[57:27] means to snatch away quickly
[57:29] right before destruction right when it
[57:31] seems like it's the very last moment
[57:32] Jesus will take us away hey man I'll
[57:37] remember eating ah knows this yeah
[57:40] verse 4 but ye brethren are not in
[57:43] darkness that the day should overtake
[57:45] you as a thief so see we don't get
[57:51] overtaken as a thief we're not going to
[57:52] be calling Oh what just happened what
[57:54] just happened
[57:55] aren't you glad you know this you know
[57:57] the prophecy I wonder what's become of
[58:18] prophecy is in us because the Spirit of
[58:20] Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy
[58:22] or exactly right now look at that verse
[58:28] 4 verse 5
[58:31] you're all churn of the light and
[58:32] children of the day we are not of the
[58:34] night nor of the darkness therefore let
[58:35] us not sleep as do others but let us
[58:37] watch and be sober a church if you catch
[58:41] this right here are you and I sleeping
[58:44] right now yes or no
[58:45] oh now by the time we use that quote
[58:53] recently about is a right of way down
[58:55] over the whole earth no but let me tell
[58:57] you this bride numbers a Lake Borgne a
[59:00] scripture right there I'm not sleeping

[59:07] washed for what my eyes are all the
[59:09] matter I'm spiritually brush my teeth
[59:11] I've trimmed my lamp and I'm going out
[59:14] to meet a bride away no you see and see
[59:30] if we say I know something didn't mean
[59:32] this but if we say the bride's not awake
[59:34] well then brother Graham wasn't awake
[59:36] are you with me
[59:39] if you're born again you have to be away
[59:41] but what excited means that we all know
[59:44] it's not the latter rain yet because we
[59:47] know the latter rain will be rapture
[59:49] abate and we go the third bowl of food
[59:52] greater at the time of the latter rain
[59:55] but this is worse I'm speaking right now
[59:57] is big and God is moving in the third
[1:00:00] pole or I spoken two things the last two
[1:00:04] months and those words did it fall to
[1:00:06] the ground God let those words come to

[1:00:51] remembers who are awake today that are

[1:03:12] hath not appointed us to the Tribulation
[1:03:15] Period or wrath because that's the day
[1:03:17] of his wrath but to obtain salvation by
[1:03:21] our Lord Jesus Christ see God's
[1:03:24] appointing some people he knows he knows
[1:03:26] what their heart conditions are so he
[1:03:28] appoints some to the rapture I point
[1:03:30] these people are Jews they're 144,000 he
[1:03:33] said these are church members he's a
[1:03:34] Buddhist version
[1:03:35] these are worldly these are just you
[1:03:37] know Pharaoh's these are just Judas's
[1:03:38] all these things but he appointed you to
[1:03:42] be awake in this hour and you to escape
[1:03:45] the wrath of God
[1:03:46] hey man he appointed you
[1:03:50] that means if he appointed you you got
[1:03:52] something new for God praise the Lord
[1:03:55] Oh so does that help your hearts a
[1:04:01] little bit tonight does that help right
[1:04:04] after the wrath
[1:04:05] your passage Paul says you're not going
[1:04:07] to be surprised when the tribulation
[1:04:08] comes you're gonna be gone you're not

[1:05:22] a foolish virgin I'm a Judas nonsense
[1:05:25] I'm a blood wash Saint I'm a child of
[1:05:27] the King hey man like I said before the
[1:05:31] devil knows what kind of life I live he
[1:05:35] knows how we fast and pray and seek God
[1:05:37] and preaches word and live his word and
[1:05:39] do everything we can to please the
[1:05:41] Heavenly Father we stay a million miles
[1:05:44] away from any any temptations with money
[1:05:47] or women or pride or popularity we stay
[1:05:50] a million miles away from that and we
[1:05:51] just clean humbly to Jesus Christ I'm
[1:05:56] gonna cherish that old rugged cross and
[1:05:58] at the end I'll exchange of her crown
[1:06:01] that's right yeah next I wasn't really
[1:06:10] praying on preaching this that was a
[1:06:11] blessing praise God
[1:06:12] now let's go
[1:06:16] further now here a little bit further
[1:06:19] now brother have said I want to do
[1:06:21] something different I got let's see I
[1:06:22] got twenty minutes here okay let's just
[1:06:24] let's go through this next thought and
[1:06:26] now I want to close with some end time
[1:06:27] events to kind of help you see where
[1:06:30] prophecy is that okay now brother Adam
[1:06:34] says he sees at paragraph 138 in this
[1:06:38] sermon so it's this is a
[1:06:39] three-and-a-half hour sermon I think for
[1:06:42] three hours from Miranda I thought I'd
[1:06:45] be a little good to give the class a
[1:06:47] little something different tonight
[1:06:48] because it might be tiring just
[1:06:50] listening to me talking all the time so
[1:06:52] here's what he does he says now the lamb
[1:06:54] has the book in his hand and he's gonna
[1:06:57] break it
[1:06:57] he said let's look to Matthew 24 the
[1:07:01] lamb himself speaking but of AMSA I want
[1:07:06] you to hold your book like this so get
[1:07:08] your Bible and romancin hold it like
[1:07:10] this so he must mean this
[1:07:11] it's your Bible on Revelation six and
[1:07:15] then Matthew 24 he says hold your Bible
[1:07:20] like this so the only possible thing I
[1:07:23] think he could be doing is something
[1:07:24] like this hold your Bible like this you
[1:07:26] got it so we're gonna be flipping back
[1:07:28] and forth so brother Adam it says hold
[1:07:31] your Bible like that Matthew 24 in
[1:07:34] revelation 6 and program takes the
[1:07:37] beginning of this sermon to show how the
[1:07:41] sixth seal is the tribulation seal and
[1:07:43] program said every scholar knows the
[1:07:46] sixth seal is taught by Jesus in Matthew
[1:07:49] 24 let me understand that by God's grace
[1:07:54] the RAM said every scholar every person
[1:07:56] knows that he says so he said Jesus was
[1:08:01] giving the symbol form in Revelation six
[1:08:04] what what he said over here in the word
[1:08:07] in Matthew 24
[1:08:08] so revelation 6 and Matthew 24 go to
[1:08:12] this both on the Tribulation Period and
[1:08:14] program cause the sixth seal the
[1:08:16] judgment seal now he calls that the
[1:08:19] judgment or the tribulation seal but
[1:08:21] judgment seal all right now we're not
[1:08:25] gonna read it but in Matthew 24 verses
[1:08:27] one through three
[1:08:29] the disciples asked Jesus three
[1:08:31] questions the first when will one stone
[1:08:34] not be left upon another and Jesus told
[1:08:36] them that was when Titus came he said
[1:08:39] when you see when you hear it about
[1:08:40] Titus and the armies coming he said
[1:08:42] don't go back for anything he said run
[1:08:44] to the mountains remember that what
[1:08:47] should there be the sign of that coming
[1:08:49] and that was of course the six seals are
[1:08:52] right here in Chapter four now those
[1:08:53] were the signs of his coming to six
[1:08:55] seals and what shall be the sign of the
[1:08:57] end of the world and of course that's
[1:08:59] all the tribulation things in the sixth
[1:09:01] seal that's the end of the world okay
[1:09:05] so whether Adam says oh it's so
[1:09:08] beautiful
[1:09:11] said the what would you like a
[1:09:13] revelation so brother forehead of
[1:09:15] boundless revelation and it got him
[1:09:17] excited that the sixth seal is in
[1:09:20] Matthew 24 hopefully you shake yourself
[1:09:22] up a little not bit tonight and get a
[1:09:24] little more excited because it's
[1:09:26] stimulated brother Branham now the first
[1:09:29] seal is taught in Matthew 24 five and
[1:09:32] six okay who can read now who can read
[1:09:35] five and six for me I'm sorry no it's
[1:09:37] Matthew 24 four and five am i read
[1:09:39] verses 4 and 5 for me
[1:09:40] Aaron can read 24 4 and 5 and jesus
[1:09:45] answered and said unto them take heed
[1:09:47] that no man deceive you for many shall
[1:09:50] come in my name saying I am Christ and
[1:09:54] shall deceive many
[1:09:56] all right now brother Graham said this
[1:09:57] is exactly the first seal because the
[1:10:01] Bible said in chapter 6 I saw a white
[1:10:04] horse and he that sat I want on him had
[1:10:06] a bow and a crown was given unto him and
[1:10:08] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[1:10:09] so matthew 24:4 5 talks about a
[1:10:13] deceiving man which which a horse rider
[1:10:16] was the most deceiving the white horse
[1:10:18] rider because he's copying Jesus as the
[1:10:21] white horse rider and the church said
[1:10:23] you see that so go Rams he gets excited
[1:10:26] said my the first seal is Matthew 24 4
[1:10:29] and 5 amen
[1:10:32] now I said that he's Antichrist he said
[1:10:35] there's your first seal he says now the
[1:10:37] second seal is in rebel or Matthew 24
[1:10:40] verse 6 so Lydia can you read Matt
[1:10:43] 24 verse 6 and mauka have you read the
[1:10:45] next one in that perfect then if you
[1:10:56] read the the second seal verses 3 and 4
[1:10:58] revelation 6 numbers a red horse rider
[1:11:01] and he says power was given to him and
[1:11:04] sat thereon to take peace from the earth
[1:11:06] and they should kill one another and
[1:11:07] there was given unto him a great sword
[1:11:08] on the church said amen
[1:11:12] so matthew 24:6 is the second seal
[1:11:15] because it's all about war it went from
[1:11:17] white deception deceiving saying i'm the
[1:11:20] christ worthy anointed it went from
[1:11:21] white to a bloody red and so the sixth
[1:11:25] seal I'm sorry the chapter 6 is all here
[1:11:30] revelation 6 is also in Matthew 24 as
[1:11:32] well amen now the third and fourth seal
[1:11:36] are in the same scriptures if you if you
[1:11:40] notice there in verses 7 and 8 okay so
[1:11:45] the famines refer to the third seal in
[1:11:49] Matthew 4 7 and then the pestilences
[1:11:53] refer to the fourth seal which is death
[1:11:56] ok so the program teaches us the third
[1:12:00] and four seals are in Matthew 24:7 and
[1:12:04] verse 8 - liddie can you put 7 up here
[1:12:07] ok her nation shall rise against nation
[1:12:10] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[1:12:12] shall be famines not famines right there
[1:12:14] that's the third seal because remember
[1:12:16] he had a balance in his hand a penny of
[1:12:19] wheat for a barley right four measure
[1:12:21] barley and we know all the families that
[1:12:24] took place during the dark ages right I
[1:12:26] mean familiar with that I could pull it
[1:12:28] up in history all you have to go just
[1:12:29] for the encyclopedia all the famines and
[1:12:31] the potato famine all those who you
[1:12:33] probably remember those families but
[1:12:35] after this comma now comes the fourth
[1:12:40] one here the fourth because pestilences
[1:12:42] and earthquakes in diverse places so now
[1:12:46] we have pestilence in our day and
[1:12:48] earthquakes in our day right how many
[1:12:51] times do i turn on Google News and it's
[1:12:53] like all there's 48 there's 48 earth
[1:12:56] in the last three weeks or something
[1:12:58] like that there's earthquakes and
[1:13:00] pestilences and people remember the Horn
[1:13:03] of Africa from our each other some years
[1:13:04] ago the Horn of Africa is under constant
[1:13:06] pestilences not having enough food and
[1:13:10] then the pestilences of insects all
[1:13:12] these things so brother ham says the
[1:13:14] third and four seal are in verses 7 and
[1:13:18] 8 verse 8 says all these are the
[1:13:21] beginning of Sorrows
[1:13:23] now what's that remind you of church
[1:13:25] birth pains right the real the real
[1:13:29] birth pains are going to be under the
[1:13:31] tribulation period because that's going
[1:13:33] to bring forth a new day right this is
[1:13:37] these are just the beginning the things
[1:13:39] we've seen the famines the pestilence is
[1:13:42] and the earthquakes the things we've
[1:13:44] seen those are just the beginning of
[1:13:46] Sorrows those are not truly the birth
[1:13:48] pains all right now the fifth seal
[1:13:52] program says is matthew 24:9 2:13 salary
[1:13:59] then and then shall they deliver you up
[1:14:03] to be afflicted and shall kill you and
[1:14:05] you should be hated of all nations for
[1:14:07] my name's sake now that's actually in
[1:14:08] the scripture too the Bible says that
[1:14:10] all nations are going to gather against
[1:14:12] Israel during the Tribulation Period I
[1:14:14] appreciate before I don't have to
[1:14:15] memorize but the Bible says all nations
[1:14:17] will come against Israel and then shall
[1:14:20] many be offended and shall betray one
[1:14:22] another and shall hate one another and
[1:14:24] many false prophets shall rise and to
[1:14:26] see many and because iniquity shall
[1:14:28] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:14:31] but he that shall endure unto the end
[1:14:33] the same shall be saved
[1:14:37] amen so buh-bam reads that and he says
[1:14:41] see they would we're on the fifth seal
[1:14:43] now that was the other night they would
[1:14:45] deliver you up but try one another and
[1:14:47] so forth right so that is the fifth seal
[1:14:52] now the sixth seal let's get to this one
[1:14:55] here is verses 12 to 17 okay I guess
[1:15:02] brother Ram did it I'm sorry no it's
[1:15:03] verses 29 to 30 I'm sorry
[1:15:06] yeah it's Matthew 24:29 to 30 so there's
[1:15:09] big gap he stops at at verse 13 and
[1:15:11] verse 14 all the way to 28 there's a gap
[1:15:16] and so off to preach on those separately
[1:15:18] those must be to the Gentiles and that
[1:15:20] must be Titus as well we go to verse 29
[1:15:23] brother Ram now I goes to 29 mother ham
[1:15:28] says verses 29 and 30 are the sixth seal
[1:15:31] let's see if they're not immediately
[1:15:35] after the tribulation of those days
[1:15:37] shall the Sun be darkened and the moon
[1:15:39] shall not give her light is that sound
[1:15:40] familiar
[1:15:41] and the stars shall fall from heaven and
[1:15:44] the powers the heavens shall be shaken
[1:15:46] and then shall appear the sign of the
[1:15:49] Son of man in heaven and then shall all
[1:15:50] the tribes of the earth mourn and they
[1:15:52] shall see the Son of man coming in the
[1:15:55] clouds of heaven with power and great
[1:15:57] glory
[1:15:57] amen glory that's not the six see I
[1:16:01] don't know what is it talks about the
[1:16:03] Sun being black and the stars falling
[1:16:05] the earth shaking that's exactly the
[1:16:08] sixth seal and it took a prophet to
[1:16:10] catch that a man hallelujah now remember
[1:16:16] I'll finish with this because I got
[1:16:18] about seven more minutes but I'll
[1:16:20] probably go a little bit further than
[1:16:21] that remember brother Han says notice
[1:16:23] Jesus doesn't say anything about rapture
[1:16:28] symbols in chapter 24 why because there
[1:16:31] are no symbols because if Satan you get
[1:16:33] a hold of those symbols of ramesses he
[1:16:35] can do some damage with it you can try
[1:16:38] to see people and get them up get them
[1:16:40] deceived and going after different
[1:16:42] things like that so Jesus didn't give
[1:16:44] any symbols but brother Graham tells us
[1:16:47] that we that God gave him the revelation
[1:16:50] of the seventh seal he said it was the
[1:16:52] day in the hour of Christ's coming hey
[1:16:55] no man knows the day or the hour except
[1:16:59] the father hallelujah
[1:17:00] so there's no symbols also there's it's
[1:17:03] unknown you've just got to be ready
[1:17:06] hey man you just got to love Jesus now
[1:17:09] and not want to wait for a fire escape
[1:17:12] to get out of hell I don't want a fire
[1:17:13] escape out of hell I want a highway to
[1:17:16] heaven amen
[1:17:17] some people just want a fire escape to
[1:17:20] quickly slide down out of hell
[1:17:22] other tribulation I don't want to slide
[1:17:24] down I want to walk up like Enoch Laurie
[1:17:27] I guess we gotta walk up day by day not
[1:17:31] just a quick walk Enoch walked with God
[1:17:34] the Bible said Oh Graham said he walk
[1:17:36] with God so much that one day God said
[1:17:38] would you just like to come home with me
[1:17:40] tonight
[1:17:40] thank you brother you know quite a hold
[1:17:43] of daughter's life I gotta take a walk
[1:17:45] with the Lord but I'll see you in the
[1:17:46] rapture is my own interpretation for our
[1:17:50] day amen at some point we might have to
[1:17:53] tell the knowers of this day I'll see
[1:17:55] you sometime I won't see in the rapture
[1:17:57] but I'll see you at the white throne
[1:17:58] judgment glory by God's grace because we
[1:18:03] have to make sure we walk with the word
[1:18:06] we if the people other people don't walk
[1:18:09] with the word that's fine we're not
[1:18:10] gonna answer for them we've just got to
[1:18:12] answer for us in our church we've got to
[1:18:14] answer for ourselves and we've got to
[1:18:16] walk with the word that's why every
[1:18:19] night God lets you go home you leave
[1:18:21] your friends your co-workers your
[1:18:22] buddies your church members you leave
[1:18:24] all those and you've got to stare one
[1:18:26] person to face yourself because you're
[1:18:31] the one that's not an answer on the day
[1:18:33] of judgment now you have this it's not
[1:18:34] giving you mouth or you and dad are you
[1:18:36] and your best buddies saying there is
[1:18:38] going to be you and Jesus only and you
[1:18:41] gotta look yourself in the mirror every
[1:18:43] night say Who am I following what am i
[1:18:45] mine making myself ready for the coming
[1:18:47] of Jesus Christ am I excited about the
[1:18:49] coming is my life worthy of the gospel
[1:18:51] and you got to answer and say if it's
[1:18:53] not lord help me to be worthy of the
[1:18:55] gospel or if you are worthy say lord
[1:18:58] help me to stay where they keep me pure
[1:19:00] from all the ideas of man keep my mind
[1:19:03] only on the Word of God glory now will
[1:19:10] you bear with me here let me give you a
[1:19:11] few modern events here
[1:19:14] okay I'm give you a mean you do a few
[1:19:17] modern events here I want to start where
[1:19:18] to then I want to show you a video here
[1:19:20] it is I told you can we hook this up
[1:19:28] oh goodness
[1:19:35] that's alright brother take a good yarn
[1:19:37] shake yourself yeah that's right brother
[1:19:42] amen
[1:19:42] hey sometimes I get tired too I
[1:19:44] understand
[1:19:52] I told you months ago
[1:19:58] article 1 besides the Pope said to admit
[1:20:03] being part of the problem of covering up
[1:20:05] clergy sexual abuse and chili this was I
[1:20:09] didn't have the date on here okay
[1:20:15] here's where I told you Church I wasn't
[1:20:16] making this up where is it oh here it is
[1:20:23] look at that
[1:20:25] three dead all those a andis lorry load
[1:20:28] one of the accusers so the Pope went met
[1:20:31] with some accusers who were saying we
[1:20:32] were abused and chilly by all these
[1:20:34] priests so the Pope met with them in a
[1:20:36] private meeting and these are what the
[1:20:37] men came back and told the Los Angeles
[1:20:39] Times one of the accusers said he saw
[1:20:43] shift and Francis's attitude when the
[1:20:46] Pope told him that abuse is not a sin
[1:20:49] but corruption now I told you that and
[1:20:52] the Bible says that church is full of
[1:20:54] every unclean and hateful spirit hey I
[1:20:57] told you it's right there it's in loss
[1:20:59] this is Los Angeles Times I told you
[1:21:01] this is not something I made up and you
[1:21:05] see it today they released the names in
[1:21:07] the state of Washington on my wife on
[1:21:08] the article well I think I got a right
[1:21:11] here yeah Washington Catholic
[1:21:14] Archdiocese names 31 priests credibly
[1:21:17] accused of sexual abuse so just today 31
[1:21:22] names of priests were listed publicly
[1:21:26] and I think the list witness of a
[1:21:28] thousand children that had been molested
[1:21:31] and that was just from the 40s to the 96
[1:21:34] I think was 96 was that right what about
[1:21:38] all these people's sins so see I don't
[1:21:42] know how this is I don't know how it's
[1:21:44] gonna work
[1:21:44] remember these Protestants are going to
[1:21:46] unite and they're they're thinking it's
[1:21:48] going to be a good thing and they're
[1:21:49] thinking they're not going to unite to
[1:21:51] the Roman Catholic Church but eventually
[1:21:53] because of finances they're going to bow
[1:21:55] and then the the Pope will become the
[1:21:58] head of this organization this world
[1:21:59] council of churches but see there's no
[1:22:02] Wigan there's gonna be no excuse on the
[1:22:03] day of judgment a tree is known by its
[1:22:06] fruit
[1:22:07] everybody has an accusation against me
[1:22:10] doing anything evil you better come
[1:22:11] in private you better bring two or three
[1:22:13] lettuces but I stood here all these 12
[1:22:15] years I'll take an accusation after
[1:22:17] accusation and God has honored my life
[1:22:20] as being pure but not this church not
[1:22:24] this church this is the cage of unclean
[1:22:27] and hateful bird
[1:22:28] stay a million miles away from this I
[1:22:30] just want to show you that by God's
[1:22:32] grace is ever ever understand now I'm
[1:22:36] gonna switch over here let me pull
[1:22:38] something up here I I want to show you
[1:22:40] this brother Simon mention this this
[1:22:42] sermon I'll switch over in just a minute
[1:22:45] here buddy hold on uh uh sorry not buddy
[1:22:48] Lydia darling darling and I don't know
[1:22:54] if you saw this or not now this is a
[1:22:57] woman preacher this is the only time
[1:22:58] you're gonna hear a woman preacher in
[1:22:59] our church because I'm an exposed to
[1:23:02] relies now what I believe is lies I
[1:23:05] could be wrong but this is what brother
[1:23:06] Simon mentioned here's a woman its
[1:23:09] prophesy and let me pull it up here yeah
[1:23:16] let me switch over now Lydia here I want
[1:23:20] you to hear it from their own lips
[1:23:22] because I but Simon mentioned a couple
[1:23:25] of times anyone remember mention brother
[1:23:26] Simon mentioning this this woman
[1:23:28] preached a whole hour that's good that's
[1:23:32] good so she preaches a whole hour on the
[1:23:40] life of William Branham at some
[1:23:41] conference where it's a prophetic
[1:23:43] conference but I want to bring out some
[1:23:46] of the things that she says that are
[1:23:48] wrong and I want to just follow up on
[1:23:52] this so she's talking about the life of
[1:23:57] other random at the 46 minute mark so
[1:24:00] I'll skip ahead here after studying on
[1:24:03] William Branham she said the the Lord
[1:24:07] told her to go to youtube for a prophecy
[1:24:11] and the very first one was supposedly by
[1:24:13] of the organ player brother Branham that
[1:24:16] talked to brother Branham right before
[1:24:19] his death so again she's she's bringing
[1:24:23] this testimony
[1:24:25] of a man who said he knew brother
[1:24:27] branham but this is not on tape that's
[1:24:29] why it's so important that we only put
[1:24:32] confidence in with what's on the tape
[1:24:35] everyone understand because there's like
[1:24:38] a hundred people out there that knew
[1:24:39] brother Brennan they have all these
[1:24:40] revelations these special revelations
[1:24:43] but you never hear about it on the date
[1:24:45] so we got to be very careful how many
[1:24:47] want to be careful so this brother then
[1:24:53] now tell you that you know I can shock
[1:24:55] and share the video with you too
[1:24:56] this brother who said he was the organ
[1:24:58] player he said another season is coming
[1:25:00] he said this is what brother Graham told
[1:25:02] him God is going to take every move in
[1:25:04] history and put it all together in one
[1:25:06] Holy Spirit bomb now that doesn't sound
[1:25:08] like Bertram's language and he said he
[1:25:15] said that brother Graham told him that
[1:25:16] he's gonna drop this bomb a Holy Spirit
[1:25:18] bomb on the earth and primetime news
[1:25:21] will cover limbs coming back they will
[1:25:24] come to open fields all across America
[1:25:27] he said they will not beat or so they
[1:25:30] will not talk about the future they will
[1:25:31] create the future and then this woman
[1:25:39] goes on to say this let me say yeah let
[1:25:44] me go to the 51 she says that the the
[1:25:47] next revival will have greater works
[1:25:49] than what Jesus did and that's where I
[1:25:51] knew she was wrong brother Branham said
[1:25:54] you cannot do greater works than Jesus
[1:25:56] Christ never understand so she's taking
[1:26:00] this with a teaching on brother Branham
[1:26:01] I met programs organ player and he told
[1:26:04] me that program told this prophecy that
[1:26:06] the bride she doesn't call it bride she
[1:26:09] just calls it revival the bride is gonna
[1:26:13] have greater works than Jesus and
[1:26:15] brother have said you can't do greater
[1:26:16] works than Jesus so see what it's giving
[1:26:19] the people it's giving them a false hope
[1:26:21] it's prophesied falsely are you with me
[1:26:26] and we are supposed to accuse those who
[1:26:29] prophesy falsely say they're wrong it's
[1:26:33] not popular it's not fun but we have to
[1:26:35] do it so let me go to it it's been
[1:26:38] t1 mark there we go hopefully our
[1:26:42] Internet's up pretty good that we can do
[1:26:44] okay then when william branham walked
[1:26:47] the earth and way of brandon had the
[1:26:49] greatest ministry since jesus christ
[1:26:52] when he walked the earth and he's saying
[1:26:55] that the latter rain is going to be
[1:26:57] greater than the former rain and in that
[1:27:00] will be greater works than we saw when
[1:27:03] Jesus was on the earth right there
[1:27:05] that's a lie
[1:27:06] that's a lie you can't do who's gonna
[1:27:11] who's gonna how can you do any greater
[1:27:13] than creating fish and bread who can do
[1:27:15] anything more than that see the lies are
[1:27:19] there so once there's one line it you
[1:27:21] know there's more lies in it it's trying
[1:27:25] to produce and see they're tying in all
[1:27:27] these things we believe in the latter
[1:27:28] rain
[1:27:28] we believe in the former rain we believe
[1:27:31] in all these things we'll see how Satan
[1:27:33] it's gonna be so close it's not possible
[1:27:45] you can't do greater works than Jesus
[1:27:47] Christ because He is God you can't be
[1:27:51] greater than God and then she said this
[1:27:57] revival is gonna come out of Texas from
[1:28:00] their churches and she said it's gonna
[1:28:03] be greater than all the other revivals
[1:28:05] combined and she said it's gonna happen
[1:28:07] in 2018 so I'm watching now I see all
[1:28:10] their videos they would put out every
[1:28:12] week and I'm watching at the ends of
[1:28:13] them to see if there's a great revival
[1:28:15] because if not what was it it was alive
[1:28:18] from the pit of hell everybody almost
[1:28:21] all the churches do that well this year
[1:28:22] is gonna be the revival or this year is

[1:29:04] she said a billion they're gonna save a
[1:29:07] billion souls that's what they said I'm
[1:29:12] trying to find the times I wrote down
[1:29:13] the times on here
[1:29:16] she says that God's profits are going to
[1:29:19] be raised up in the area of
[1:29:20] entertainment like God wants anything to
[1:29:23] do with entertainment God is not God
[1:29:42] cares a lick about Hollywood
[1:29:44] bunch of devils in there bunch of
[1:29:47] prostitutes is that right and
[1:29:50] whoremongers have these evil dirty
[1:29:52] filthy nonsense God don't want to
[1:29:54] entertain anybody you got a worship
[1:29:57] Jesus entertain the Lord oh my I feel
[1:30:05] like a little righteous evening nation I
[1:30:06] guess tonight cuz I don't I'm not asleep
[1:30:09] I'm awake in Jesus Christ this ain't
[1:30:12] gonna fool me this ain't fooling Simon
[1:30:13] this ain't fooling none of us we see
[1:30:15] them through all through that because
[1:30:17] Satan can mother have said Satan cannot
[1:30:20] preach a sermon that's word by word all
[1:30:22] the word in other words you're gonna
[1:30:24] find one thing at least one thing wrong
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:31] it's gonna be all with the word not
[1:30:34] false prophecy not lies now you might
[1:30:36] mix up with Scripture but that's not
[1:30:38] what I'm talking about
[1:30:38] I'm talking about when you're speaking
[1:30:40] for God everything is gonna be right
[1:30:43] yeah hallelujah under the inspiration
[1:30:45] everything will be right because I'm not
[1:30:47] you speaking it's God speaking
[1:30:50] hallelujah now
[1:30:57] skip ahead she says she says their
[1:31:01] revival coming out of Texas is gonna be
[1:31:03] 90 set 90% better than the day of
[1:31:06] Pentecost
[1:31:07] she says Pentecost I'm sorry the 1946
[1:31:11] revival was the tithe of the rest of the
[1:31:13] revival so 1946 brother Rams ministry
[1:31:17] was only a tenth of what God was gonna
[1:31:19] do so we're gonna have nine times more
[1:31:21] than what for the brand of head I'm
[1:31:23] sorry Jesus said very few be the plan
[1:31:28] and then she said their move is gonna
[1:31:30] save 1 billion people let me skip add to
[1:31:33] that I'm so it's only 8:30 good all
[1:31:37] right let me skip ahead here this is
[1:31:38] that 56 there we go she's got paint on
[1:31:52] her face and all kinds of things it's
[1:31:53] not like this isn't hockey is it never
[1:31:57] gonna happen
[1:31:58] I'm just gonna go about building my own
[1:31:59] house I feel like the Lord is saying
[1:32:02] come back come back it's time it's time
[1:32:08] it's beautiful said any two years ago is
[1:32:13] about to be revisited on us and to be
[1:32:15] poured out and so he's saying to us get
[1:32:18] your lives right
[1:32:21] get yourselves right before me get rid
[1:32:25] of offense get rid of unforgiveness get
[1:32:29] rid of the things get rid of the
[1:32:30] judgment get rid of the things that will
[1:32:32] hindering us from walking in this kind
[1:32:35] of glory in this kind of truth there's
[1:32:42] an earth out there waiting for you to
[1:32:46] take dominion its groaning for the sons
[1:32:50] of God to rise up romo certain power
[1:32:57] because on the heels of this great
[1:32:59] providers is going to come some pretty
[1:33:03] horrible things but God is bringing in
[1:33:09] the greatest harvest
[1:33:10] that the world has ever seen over a
[1:33:13] billion souls will come into his kingdom
[1:33:15] a billion souls a billion souls there's
[1:33:19] only seven billion on the earth so a
[1:33:21] seventh of the world is gonna be saved
[1:33:24] jesus said very few will find this can
[1:33:27] you imagine it imagine having the adult
[1:33:28] audacity to lie and to say that out of
[1:33:32] your church is gonna spring forth a
[1:33:34] revival we're a billion souls are gonna
[1:33:36] be saved and then say you're do greater
[1:33:38] works than Jesus Christ Oh Satan's a
[1:33:40] slick liar isn't he he's slick and let
[1:33:46] them paint their faces and talk about
[1:33:47] being consecrated when they can't even
[1:33:49] wipe their face with one of those you
[1:33:50] know the hotels have those makeup wipes
[1:33:52] I wonder how many that she's passed by
[1:33:55] should have wipe your face off in those
[1:33:59] men - they do the same thing to get on
[1:34:00] the camera they paint all themselves up
[1:34:01] with JFK did that that's why he they say
[1:34:04] he won the election cuz he painted his
[1:34:06] face did you know that that's what they
[1:34:08] say he looks more healthy than Richard
[1:34:10] Nixon so he won the election Oh nonsense
[1:34:13] see they talk all the talk but there's
[1:34:16] no substance they talk about revival but
[1:34:20] there's not even cleaning out their own
[1:34:21] house to live right obey the Bible
[1:34:23] preach about William Branham but don't
[1:34:26] do what William Branham says we'll see
[1:34:28] we that's the difference between us we
[1:34:29] preach about William Branham and we do
[1:34:31] what he says hey man that's the
[1:34:34] difference between us
[1:34:36] hallelujah we just don't recognize a
[1:34:38] prophet we obey the Prophet now I missed
[1:34:43] the part where it says we can stand our
[1:34:44] feet we missed the part where it said
[1:34:46] about the 90% she says it was the
[1:34:50] tithing and there's that if you want the
[1:34:52] testimony there's the man supposedly
[1:34:53] that was the organ player for brother
[1:34:56] Branham and talks about this prophecy
[1:34:59] but that's not a real process I don't
[1:35:02] believe that was a real prophecy okay
[1:35:06] hope that's okay now please don't be
[1:35:08] stumbled that I played a woman preacher
[1:35:09] I played other things like that before
[1:35:13] just so you can see what kind of world
[1:35:15] we're living in and at the end she'll go
[1:35:18] down there and she'll say who come up
[1:35:19] here who wants to be pray for revival
[1:35:21] and you'll pray for me huh anointed with
[1:35:23] oil do all these
[1:35:25] who's really getting a revive you know
[1:35:28] the Bible says that they in the the the
[1:35:30] false prophets now she's already falsely
[1:35:32] prophesy right can every see that a
[1:35:35] billion souls will come out of their
[1:35:37] revival but the Bible says they'll
[1:35:41] promise them things they can never
[1:35:43] attain to that's what the scripture says
[1:35:46] let me pull it up real quick I want you
[1:35:50] to show that to you because when simon
[1:35:51] talked about that he shared it with me
[1:35:53] and i want you to see and this is now
[1:35:56] this is what brother simon thought which
[1:35:57] I thought was a good thought it shows
[1:35:59] that there are looks like some foolish
[1:36:01] versions who are trying to get the oil
[1:36:04] now know how sincere they are but at
[1:36:06] least they're talking about getting the
[1:36:08] oil does everybody see that they want
[1:36:10] the latter rain they want the oil but if
[1:36:12] they don't get the former rain they're
[1:36:14] not getting the latter rain amen
[1:36:17] what's the former eight the former rain
[1:36:19] is the teaching rain the teaching of
[1:36:21] brother Branham that God gave to it
[1:36:24] which is women don't preach women don't
[1:36:27] paint their face men no painter grace a
[1:36:30] real man doesn't let his wife preach and
[1:36:34] then she has pants on her other sermons
[1:36:35] you know hood you see that so it's
[1:36:40] showing us there is some kind of cost so
[1:36:43] move out there that once that oil that
[1:36:45] we've got to make sure we've got it
[1:36:48] brother Branham preached that he said he
[1:36:50] even in programs day he believed they
[1:36:53] were trying to get the oil but that did
[1:36:54] not stop brother Brad from preaching
[1:36:56] about the Holy Ghost and inviting people
[1:36:59] to get the oil Gordon he still do prayer
[1:37:03] lives he still bring him up to pray for
[1:37:05] the Holy Ghost and tell them to go in
[1:37:06] the room even though he thought they
[1:37:08] were seeking the Holy Ghost the booze
[1:37:09] version was he still encouraged the wise
[1:37:12] to get the oil it's exactly right so a
[1:37:16] lot ahead I'll keep doing the same thing
[1:37:18] if you're not burned again
[1:37:20] you better get burned again amen even if
[1:37:23] they're searching out and they don't
[1:37:24] feel there or they would need
[1:37:26] they're searching out this oil we can
[1:37:27] get the oil praise God
[1:37:29] there's no reason we shouldn't I think
[1:37:33] it about hanging the Bible says they
[1:37:34] promise them Liberty that's right Thank
[1:37:36] You Holy Spirit
[1:37:38] they promise them Liberty but they
[1:37:41] themselves are the servants of
[1:37:42] corruption there it is all right let's
[1:37:44] say praising already praise them oh
[1:37:45] there it is the Holy Spirit brought the
[1:37:47] words back to me in 2nd Peter 2:19 he's
[1:37:53] talking about Balaam and all these
[1:37:55] sinners sang it to me I'm sorry 2nd
[1:37:58] Peter 2:19 while they promise them
[1:38:01] Liberty is that what she's doing promise
[1:38:02] of all this Liberty and where we God's
[1:38:04] service will be the true church they
[1:38:07] themselves are the servants of
[1:38:09] corruption
[1:38:10] you know what sermon series that's right
[1:38:12] the wealth the wealth of the kingdom
[1:38:17] preaching out money all the money of the
[1:38:20] kingdom and then all the all the
[1:38:23] spiritual wealth - don't you see Church
[1:38:27] they want the prosperity of money that
[1:38:29] goes along with being Germany most last
[1:38:31] time you heard a sermon preached like
[1:38:32] that here the wealth of the message I
[1:38:37] condemn money and then people get mad at
[1:38:39] me and leave right I condemn people that
[1:38:45] like being richer i condemn all that and
[1:38:48] people get upset with me leave well
[1:38:51] praise the Lord that's that's that's
[1:38:52] fine with me
[1:38:53] that's fine with me see they promise
[1:38:58] them Liberty they make all these
[1:38:59] promises you're gonna save a billion
[1:39:01] souls you're gonna do all this come on
[1:39:03] church your ministry is going to be 90%
[1:39:07] more effective than will you bring
[1:39:10] that's what she's saying 90% more
[1:39:14] powerful than William Branham nonsense I
[1:39:17] just want one percent of his power I'll
[1:39:20] take whatever I can get lord I just want
[1:39:23] the same only goes because I know I
[1:39:24] preach the same worse I've seen some of
[1:39:28] the results in praise God
[1:39:30] oh ma thank God church for eyes that can
[1:39:34] see thank God for the ice out of the
[1:39:38] Holy Spirit in this hour we're not
[1:39:41] deceived by things like this all speak
[1:39:43] in tongues and let's get in our prayer
[1:39:45] language and speak in tongues and then
[1:39:47] you'll get then you'll get it now you
[1:39:48] might speak in tongues that's wonderful
[1:39:50] I know sister Naomi does thank God
[1:39:52] for her she's such an encouragement that
[1:39:53] she speaks in tongues because I never
[1:39:54] I've asked God to left me and he doesn't
[1:39:56] but maybe one day you will but I'm
[1:39:59] talking about how they push it as the
[1:40:00] evidence oh you'll get you talking
[1:40:03] tongues and then we'll get the latter
[1:40:04] rate then we'll save a billion souls and
[1:40:05] then we'll be in Hollywood who cares of
[1:40:07] looking about Hollywood I know what
[1:40:10] Hollywood we want wormwood to come amen
[1:40:13] and clean this off this earth off so
[1:40:16] that we can step upon the ashes and walk
[1:40:19] out with Jesus into the Millenium praise
[1:40:21] God that's only what I'm looking forward
[1:40:23] to is the purple hood hate to say like
[1:40:25] that but if you can't make people to
[1:40:27] repent what's God got to do he's got to
[1:40:29] wipe it clean they will repent they
[1:40:31] won't come to church they won't listen
[1:40:32] the Word of God they won't obey that God
[1:40:34] have your way and help us just to be
[1:40:36] pure before the Lord see what they do
[1:40:39] Church they make all these promises but
[1:40:42] they need themselves on the servants of
[1:40:44] corruption let me get my britches on and
[1:40:48] paint on before I come to preach this
[1:40:50] morning come on let me get a BMW so I
[1:40:55] wonder what the cars they drive off they
[1:40:57] look that up next what's their income
[1:41:00] from the church form hula man is
[1:41:03] overcome of the same is he brought in
[1:41:06] bondage and when a man or woman submits
[1:41:08] to the Jezebel spirit then they take on
[1:41:11] all the part then they are partakers
[1:41:13] with Jezebel because God said come out
[1:41:17] of her my people that you be not
[1:41:19] partakers so all these people that don't
[1:41:23] leave that church and come out against
[1:41:25] it
[1:41:25] they're partakers and they're guilty
[1:41:28] because they're not speaking against it
[1:41:31] and so are we if we're guilty we see sin
[1:41:34] if we see sin and don't speak against it
[1:41:36] we're guilty how many can say amen to
[1:41:38] that you see me in sin don't let me
[1:41:41] continue and said you need me afterwards
[1:41:43] with two or three witnesses or will man
[1:41:44] the manor or sister will bring my wife
[1:41:46] in there and we'll get into cleanup
[1:41:48] because there's no reason for us to walk
[1:41:50] and said when we have every promise that
[1:41:53] we need for life and godliness we can't
[1:41:58] say well God you didn't give me enough
[1:41:59] spiritual help here Orlando see yeah I'm
[1:42:01] driving out here I'm barely gonna live
[1:42:03] it the Bible said he gave us
[1:42:04] every promise we need to live godly on
[1:42:08] this earth
[1:42:09] hey man but maokai won't you come here I
[1:42:12] better stop there

[1:42:32] that over there and I did not remember I
[1:42:33] towards that I said soon as I listened I
[1:42:34] caught that huh you can't do greater

[1:42:38] done greater who's gonna go to heaven
[1:42:40] same with Jesus nice to meet you

[1:43:06] disciples remember when Jesus said that
[1:43:09] there was only 12 he was 13 and then
