Barve and then my niece there Allison are doing the Sunday school together now Allison does the projects the artwork projects and then lack of voice singing abilities or even lack of teaching abilities but we just want to be be a blessing see okay so we'll start here in 1st Kings 20 and verse 1 well read the scripture then we'll say a word of Prayer ok to convey the thought is the Lord even to me at first Kings 20 verse 1 and ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his hosts together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged Samaria and Ward against it and he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city and said to him and thus saith been a dad look what this king is saying is he the king is saying Koufax l'chaim my silver and thy gold is mine my wives also in thy children even the goodliest our mind and the kingdom of israel answered and said my lord o king according to thy saying I am thine and all that I have it's all yours but notice this is the first battle and notice for it takes place the compass Harry Deerling father Lord Jesus so we just love you Lord Lord is freshness the start is so fresh Lord to me Lord and I just really thrilled Lord and Lord Jesus or just decided to bring it forth children here and largest blessed service God Lord and or just to annoy me Lord accordingly in order the ears of the word as well God Lord and look we just want to magnify you and glorify your Lord and orders the angels the elders all around about that throne God or worshiping you Lord and others are crying of holy holy holy holy holy Lord day and night Lord Jesus or we want to be counted worthy of God or jek to even give you a praise God and we want to give you all the we cannot pray enough Lord we can't worship you we love you so much blessa social service called a name Jesus Christ amen now here King Ahab of Acts the King not a really good man a lure as the Provost at a lower caliber of a man to come as a king to Israel to lead the very children of God the very people of God but though the main thought at the end I wanted to convey the main thing is I want is I want to show you the end the end the very end result so today I liked her tonight I'd like to teach on real realization and if you could imagine what it would be like to be maybe God all-powerful all-knowing not a doubt has ever entered his mind he's never even known fear outside of Jesus Christ when he's at the cross there the Bible said it was in that time when he was said to a feared but that was in his flesh that was separated from the Holy Ghost then he appeared but outside of that he doesn't he knows no fear he's a lion a tribe of juda he he can do it all and if he was to convey a thought if there's always one thing he seems like if you read the scripture I've been seeing more and more scriptures ending like this so let's go in here a little a scripture reading here look at Deuteronomy 4 and 33 he says did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire this is what God came down to Moses Moses now approach God in the kind of way and approach it was because it was a holy ground why because God was there he says and then out of this bush that was burning in this fire that was culminating there's a voice come out of the fire start speaking to Moses revealing who he was Moses obviously blown away he was moved and touched by God coming down and meeting him in this kind of way and now here God is iterating things he said did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out in the midst of the fire as thou has heard and live or hath God a swayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of innovation by temptations and by signs and wonders by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to all the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes but now notice what God wants to become a here he says unto thee that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God there is only one person that was in before Genesis 1:1 and that was Jesus Christ right God Almighty the invisible one came and he was as he said Elohim the self existing when he dwelt all by himself with all these attributes coming forward the end he wanted to splay everything he golfs however you did he had it all he is everything he said that thou mightest know they he's the Lord he is God he says there is none else beside him so as God springs forth creation he brings forth creating everything from from the first seven days everything sprung forth out of that right he created the heavens and then there was the angels that the devil was there the Fallen Angels were there at the time all that so God had everything in motion he was creating one big story who's writing what is pistol like that and he wanted to show some things all right but after the fall took place in heaven now Satan his angels would come down and they were started the sons and daughters of God he reverted the race called the serpent that's not the original serpent the original serpent did not have a soul but now we have these men on earth the beasts modern movies that there are serpents may have now a soul so we see a perversion on the scene and as these I'll say this beings now mingling on the seat we can't we don't know who's who and as these things are to bring forth and come forth of them intermarrying and all those things the fall seed line will bring forth other thoughts of creation of God now start bringing forth this religion and that religion and as uh the last count I've heard it was like almost fifty thousand different denominations churches within the Christian ranking I'm not talking Muhammad and Muslims I'm just talking within the Christianity there's over fifty thousand now different styles or different branches different this or that alright so as he conveys this he says there is none else besides him so also here in Isaiah 45 verse five he says I am the Lord he says there is none else there is no God beside me i curtly now as not though thou has not known me that they may know from the rising and Sun from the going and for the West that there is none beside me he says I am the Lord and there is none else's one thing God wants to prove there's one thing God always wants to show is that He is God Almighty amen there is one God there's not three persons in the Godhead there's not four persons two persons there's only one person in the Godhead and that is just a great revelation it is coming this age I can't I can't I can't remember when I first heard it earlier in 2001 and I and it was just blow me away that there's that all the sports teaching is just grasp the entire world the whole religious realms this false teaching of Trinity but now here in verse seven he says now look what God says he says I formed the light I create darkness I make peace I create evil I do I the LORD do all these things right he's done at all he he's the one that set this thing in motion absolutely he says drop down he heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteous let the earth open pieces and let them bring forth salvation let righteousness bring up together I the LORD have created it Amen what he was trying to convey notice is the Book of Isaiah one two or three thousand years afterwards he is trying to convey that he is God even now after creation after all these things he's trying to get instilled in the people there is no on else there is no other God and this is after what the mighty delivered so Moses and and bringing all those things Abraham Jacob and Isaac and all those everything that God has done even to this point he was still trying to get this instilled in their minds that there is no other God there's one God hey man now let's continue reading here he says woe unto him that striveth with his maker well lord I thought you were this and I thought you were that God what God says is what he means he says let the potsherd strive with the pressures of the earth shall the clay see him to him that fashioned him what make us now or thy work he had he hath no hands woe unto him that hath said to his father what be get a sty or to the woman what has now brought forth in other words we don't have anything that the place into the mind of God God knows it all he's thought of all he's never had a new thought he'd never have an old thought he knows it he's eternal being so they're always with him he says thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel and his maker ask of me things to to come concerning my son's and concerning the work of my hands command ye me I have made the earth and created a man apart I even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their hosts of I have commanded and yet even at this time there are many false religions and beliefs about the stars and Bowl and the Moon and Mars and the wandering stars and that these are God's just traveling around and with Greek mythology Roman mythology all those things and yet God is trying to a to convey and to teach and to show that what I have done all this everything else is false there's only one God and he goes on and on even in verse he says he says for thus saith the Lord that created heavens God Himself that formed the earth and made it he has established that he is created not in vain but he formed it to be inhabited he says I am the Lord and there is none else now look what he says here I have not spoken in secret in other words he gave us this entire book out of all the religious books in the world the Koran you name any other religious book Eastern religion God still has his word here for us to learn from he did not leave this a mystery this this word has been here since what the oldest book they say is the book of Job and that was now written down and then start compiling after Moses and now we have the complete sixty-six books of the Bible right which is all we considered this the absolute infallible Word of God absolutely he says I've not spoken to speak secret and in dark in in a dark place of the earth I said not unto the seed of Jacob seeking me in vain I the Lord speak righteous I declare all these things declare the flare things that are right so here we know that the Word of God is true I'm spilled a foundation here all's well but notice the Book of Isaiah he continually reiterates and trying to tell these people and pound it into their skulls there is only one God he says tell me and bring them near me yay let them take counsel together who has declared this from ancient time who had told it from that time have not I the Lord and there is no God else besides me oh just God and a Savior there is no one else he's there's none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all ends of the earth Jesus for I am God and there is none else but remember at the end of this revelation at the end when there we when he says there's one God one God one God I am he I am he I'm he there's none else none else right what is the end result gonna be here in verse 23 he says I have sworn by myself the word has gone out of my mouth and righteousness and shall not return this is this is the whole thing that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear at the end when this thought this false doctor this false religion this crazy thing or back or whatever springs up religiously even even even even uh evolution you name any thought outside the Word of God he says but the end result will be that every that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear because every religion has a claim every every thought has a claim well this is gonna take place and this is gonna take place but in the end God will show who is the true not omnipotent potentate of all amen now let's continue on here by the grace of God now back to this here Brenna dad and he was attacking Israel he was he'd light up all his waters he camps Samaria and and of course you know he says all they call that you have a ham it's mine he has like well okay and this snapped well then wasn't the next thing we see out that after a ham says yes absolutely all that I have is mine he speaketh a ham he said I told you all your wife all your children all your gold silver everything house oh I'm gonna send guys to get it now no he's serious he's in cat me now he wants demands he wants all these things and a hams not having it now now look up her saying all the elders and all the people send him hearken not in him nor consent so at first he's like sure you know just to make peace just kind of mend things over you just just whatever but now when it came down to it was serious to where that King Brenna dad said I want it now I'm coming to get it hey HAP said I better not let this happen he says but now look look what takes place here yep yeah is a Backson king he's a heathen king as far as one the worse there and behold there came a profit on the ham king of Israel saying thus saith the Lord has now seen all this great multitude November 1/2 was serving other gods he married Jezebel he he was serving other gods and now death come into his camp to take everything take his life but now look what God says thus saith the LORD hath now seen all this great multitude behold he says I would deliver into thine hand this day and what was the end result and thou shalt note that i am the lord so at the end of this battle god was a had to know one thing i am the god not these other gods that you're worshiping he's but i am coming down to deliver a man absolutely we know about the story god comes down he defeats them then round out comes round two with king bennett well remember it took place in Samaria what fishes what the hills correct now we've been through all heard the story and the prophet came in to the king of Israel and said to him go strengthen myself and Mark and see what thou dost for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee and the servants of the king of Syria send him their gods or gods of the hill Hills therefore they are stronger than we but let us fight against him in the plane and surely we were stronger than they see one thing if any head that had not learned was that this is God now he is thinking or whatever he is surrounded a city where the king was asked Samaria and he lost the battle instead well there's a hill right there we lost the hill there gods must have power in the hill he said well he said let's meet him in the plane because whatever God they have probably will not be able to beat us there but now once a gun a year later returned Benna dad number the his Syrians and went to a to fight Israel and the children of number four but the Bible says the Syrians filled the country there's so many of you rounded up and there came a man of God and speaking the king of Israel said to him thus saith the Lord because the Syrians have said the Lord is God of the hills but he is not God of the valleys even though very god that created the valleys therefore I will deliver all the screep multitude in nine hand and ye shall know that I am the Lord you mean they have still did not learn that he was that this was God after that first battle in Samaria they won he still went and worshipped as false idols false gods but even now once again God is going to show his his king of his people that he is God not of just the hills but he's a God of the valleys a man he's a God of the good time than the gap gotta leave the tough times amen sure now let's continue on here look here I'm building up to something here and Exodus 6 and 5 now look what takes place here God is speaking you if you if you read the scripture and just type in these kind of these words here you'll see this runs all the way through he says and I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians kept keep in bondage and I have and I have remembered my covenant wherefore saying to the children of Israel I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under these burdens of the Egyptians and I will rid you out of their bondage and I will redeem you and you will redeem you with the stretched out arm and with great judgments and I'll take you for to me for a people and I'll be to you or God and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God so he let the Israelites become slaves for 400 years taking all those things they were laboring hard mortar for brick and all those things and bringing the straw and how they were mixed in how but at the end one thing he wants to show the people at the end of this mighty deliverance he wants the people to know that He is God no one else no Egyptian god when they the Israelites were with you in Egypt right there for those forty years they saw Egypt worship every single God that they're ever probably they could ever make up including pride cats but at the end God was going to show that Jehovah the great I am the eternal one He is God amen he says and I you shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Israel burns of the Egyptians Amen now let's continue on here and the Lord said to Moses see have I made the god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet thou shalt speak all that I command thee and Aaron thy brother shall speak in the Pharaoh that he sent the children Israel out of his land and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt but Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that I made lead that I may lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my own armies and my people and the children Israel out of the land of Egypt by great judgments and the Egyptians not only is this judgment or this Redemption this salvation this deliverance going to prove to Israel that he's God but Jesus also said he says he's and the Egyptians shall know that i am the lord because remember after that last death hit that last plague hit of death the word got out and all the nations around about even in the promised land as israel would start gathering and start moving start camping and informing the one church nation the work that the nations round about would hear about what their God did to Egypt and his brother Brooke said one time he says and they never Egypt never recovered they never did absolutely their pours poor can be why God went and wiped them out and if they didn't learn by then that Jesus Christ is God they never will until the end amen amen all's well now God always wants to make himself known some he reveals you're on this side many many others I think the God we know we know the mystery this is in fact program sentencer cheese book he says the Godhead was the greatest mystery we know and we know it he said that was the highest mister I came from the exact words but he said it was like the greatest revelation was the Godhead to know that there is only one God and not just one God but it was a God that could form a body a human body called Jesus that was perfect that was sinless and then that invisible God that can come and dwell inside of it and now he's become the complete man why did we come and flesh because the salvation would come in flash anyhow okay he says now bring me against my land that the heathen may know me so a lot of times Redemption delivers he God wants the even the heathen to know that his gut that Jesus Christ is gone a man now [Music] mister he said thou shall fall upon the open field for I have spoken to saith the Lord God and he said I will send a fire on Magog and among them that dwell carelessly in the aisles and they shall know that i am the lord so will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel Jesus and I will not let them pollute my Holy Name anymore and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord the Holy One of Israel behold he has come it is done saith the Lord it is the day that I have spoken we're up I have spoken so at the end of all things all the entire world know there is one God the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we're we getting this from as far as uh scripture in Psalms 46:10 it says be still and know that I am God he says I'll be exalted among the heathen I will be exalted Jesus Christ everything they go out and they get a job they make money all these things become wealthy and all that who gave that Jesus Christ absolutely God even allowed this age to bring forth cars nice lush vehicles we can ride around and who gave that to us that was God he allowed those things to be contacted and now made for smartboard he says hey all Kings shall fall down before him all nations shall serve Him that men may know that thou whose name alone is Jehovah art the most high over all the earth a man so the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth I glory when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in glory amen all the kings they shall praise thee O Lord when they hear the words of I all the kings a man I want that see what the Millennium it'll be obvious in the Millennium he's God his kingdom his government will be set up for 1,000 years and there'll be the throne there'll be the the bride the bride a 144,000 be the Chamberlain's to the bride there or however and and it'll all be set up and at certain times they'll be feasts at certain times will be this times that come up for worship and this and that is all gonna be set up around Jesus Christ no you on here notice here even in the Old Testament or New Testament wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow pieces of things in heaven and things of earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father how hard would it be for our politicians right now to do this for the wicked could you see I'll just say you see the pride the arrogancy of our government the world leaders our president right now occur one he is just saying thank God thank God thank God he's actually acknowledging that there is a God it's Jesus I don't know the condition of his heart or our past president he was not like that president before that was not like that but there's coming a time where everybody's gonna have to humble themselves now here's what I want to get to I don't know how long this will be but I want to bring this in to show you something here by the grace of God in Daniel there's Cobra Graham said he's a Dan the Book of Daniel is like the Book of Revelations in fact I want to show you let me let me fir let's go off target here real quick I want to show you something here in Daniel that's boss chapter no programs in the angel Burton seven thunders said he heard the same thing at John looking for a while but I think I found here Daniel 12 Daniel 12 verse 4 look what God says he says but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and now it shall be increased did you know that the end times now show me increase we can go up in the sky and fly and all those things then I Daniel looked and behold there stood another to the one on this side of the bank in the river and the other on the side of the bank of the river and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these things now look what it says and I heard the man clothed in linen that was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand in heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever and it shall be for a time and times and a half-dozen that sound like revelations 10 mighty you comes down with his hands he swears by himself the time shall be no more and when he shall have accomplished to the scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished now look at verse 8 and I heard but I understood not that is when Daniel heard the seven thunders but he never understood them and let me throw a little bonus a little hint in there Daniel never walk with Jesus Christ Daniel never heard Jesus Christ speak but when Daniel heard those thunders he understood now in Revelations 10 John is now caught up into the heavenlies and in the spear raptured up and type and he hears the seven thunders augur it never said he did not understand them when John saw revelation 17 that woman with all the harlots and and riding on the beast with ten horns and all those things in the waters and città the waters all those things John said he was amazed he said he said he was astonished at what he saw he did not understand he does this but when he heard those thunders and never said that amen now I'll go that far Daniel 4 verse 10 thus were the visions of my head in my bed I saw and behold a great behold a tree in the midst the earth and the height thereof was great and the tree grew and was strong in the height thereof reached unto heaven the sight thereof until the ends of the earth notice this what this would represent all the way to the end of time meema the leaves are fair the fruit there as much and it was much and it was meat for all and the beasts of the field has shadow on her and the fowls there dwelt in the boughs thereof and all the flesh was fed of yes right now look what look what he sees here he's he's seeing the vision he said it's all of these dreams or whatever and I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher notice how the Bible says hey watch her remember he's a heathen king and he sees something spiritual two beings come down he said a holy one he's in the nurses this one he says it's a watch notice the words he picked he said a watcher a watcher what is he what is he what is that identifying what was he picking out about this being what is he saying about this being he's a watcher a watcher has to have eyes amen and I saw in the vision my head upon my bed and behold a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven and he cried aloud and said thus and said thus hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from it in the fowls the air his branches nevertheless leave the stump of the room the earth even dying brass and all those things right so the Holy One says cut down this tree and there's a watcher watching everything heard it and he was watching but notice he says let his heart be changed from man's and let a beasts heart be given unto him what is a man the man said he's that there's a real man is like Christ he said Jesus Christ was the realist was the man of all men not brawny and strong and all this and that's like muscle rippling and all that but he was a man a character a character humble meek loving all the fruits of the spirit dwelling in that man but let his heart be change from man's from a man's and let a beasts heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him what is God showing here remember never never can either was that head of gold and as God used him to signify the start of the Gentile kingdom all the way out to the end he chooses Nebuchadnezzar as that first King a head of gold had the most glory the most powerful the most wonderful the most beautiful kingdom of all the rest he says let this King's heart turn into a beast and let seven times pass over him and we know that word that number seven always represents the seven church ages so what's gonna do what is what is God trying to show through this what are you trying to say now look he says this matter was by the notice you when the King first mentioned he says a watcher but now he says this matter is by the decree of the Watchers plural now just watch her but Watchers and the man by the word of the Holy Ones to the intent that the living may know and what is this hew down the tree that the living may know what that the most high rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever he will and so does the set it up over the basis of man he's going to do this to show that what he is God he's the King of Kings the Lord of lords a man now look what gill says this matter is by the decree of the Watchers plural that is the cutting down the tree what it is signified by was with the advice consent and a permission of the watchers by whom is generally understood angels not they were authors of this decree but approvers of it and we're ready not only to subscribe it but to so God came down with one of his Watchers and he told these Watchers he said take this tree now for seven sure changes amen you're catching it already why were they called Watchers superstitious man called Daniel one of his gods right and two men come down two feet and he said you're a watcher why because it has eyes and the appearance of the wheels and their works was like unto the color of the barrel and the four had one lightness and they four had one lightness and their parents' was their work as it were a wheel in the middle of the wheel when they went they went on their four sides they turned that when they went and as for the Rings they were so high that they were dreadful and the rings were full of eyes round about them for here's your watchers said they called the wheels the wheels he says because the Ark of the Covenant was in motion it but now it is set up in heaven and when the living creatures went cause them living creatures and the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up honestly God and all that was with him Ziqi Oh 10 11 when they went they looked upon their four sides they turned not as they went but by the place where whither the head look as they found it and he turned not they turned not as they went and their whole body their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full that they had they forehand so here is these beings these watchers and eyes all around for these these are the exact same feasts or living creatures notice as John was caught up now into heavenly at the time of the rapture look as he sees God and all his glory surrounded by the elders verse 6 and before the throne there was a sea of glass like in the crystal and in the midst of the throne round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before these are what the watchers the first piece was like a lion the second beast was a calf the fruit the third beast was like a man the fourth was like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings around about them and they were full of eyes within a man and they rest not day or night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and is to come a man showing what the beast these were the closest was to God and what they were worshiping holy man then when you get closer and closer to the present God you will worship amen because we see these are the closest right now to him even right now and they will not stop worshiping night and day amen yes sir praise the Lord and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who live forever look at the Prophet says here now notice they have eyes in the front and back within who are these I'm saying like this well just use the scriptural time term in Revelation for who are these beasts now we see it you'll call them living creatures but the Bible says here they call it beast he says now notice they have eyes and he's EQ one here in front in the back within let's just read that looky here let's see here I believe they spoke through their hear beasts for faces like an eagle wings full of eyes running without look and they flew and so forth and they had eyes within without and behind his spoke of their intelligence they know it was which is and which shall come they known all for they was right at the seat so close to they wasn't even human now I had never understood this or even seen this - I just was studying this here he says temple guards or not tumble guards the temple guards 144,000 but this is the mercy seat guard the throne guards the throne right up next to God he calls him what living creatures next thing - calm next thing to God standing there their intelligence they know what was which is and we shall come they had eyes without showing that they could see what it was to come watch eyes within knows everything now and eyes and back node which one was Watchers they could see all through time which was which isn't which shall come reflecting through the church ages he that was which is and shall come Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever these Watchers now now look what I if you look in the study in the in the in description and he has made into us kings and priests and we shall reign on earth and I beheld on what is mentioned here and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels I set round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and another of them was ten thousand times ten thousand ten thousand dollars right now I never knew this till just recently here and here in Revelations four it means a living creature not a beast but it's called a beast but it isn't same thing is it you won and what we just read there right okay but these are living creatures what are they he says they are not angels this Jesus I tell you what let's read in Revelations 5 and that's just what we read I heard the voice angels throne conjunction beasts and elders see and a conjunction they were not angels neither were they elders they are they were living creatures at the throne a totally different kind these living creatures not angels because it proves it right here this is a totally different kind of breed of creature these are not fair serums or cherubims this is something different now now there's three different categories here I hope you got this system down here now I want to show you there's three different categories three different species look now around the throne I had never known that these are absolutely separate different kind of creatures I had no idea and now look at the prophecies here's the throw now the first at this throne is the four living creatures outside of that there are 20 and around this is great host of he says see what I mean there every one different one from another there is angels there's elders and here is living creatures let's not leave that for a minute let's just hold it right there a minute living creatures what what are they if they're not angels they're not redeemed man like an outer would be what are they would you like to know here's my interpretation I hope it's right I believe it is they are God's guards his stroke and that's about as far as you went now these are going to now we're going to erase this in just a little bit you know they're not angels nor man they're not wild beasts they're creatures living creatures and a holy one came down to Nebuchadnezzar and a watcher which is one of these holy creatures or all four of them however you want to call it come down and this man said shoo down this tree the Watchers were watching everything note all about it the seven would be today than what they would take the the the heart of a beast for seven church ages and he says cut it down and the Prophet brought this out is Matthew Mark Luke and John correct right he said that these are actually the four Gospels is the protection of the holy spirit or the book of Acts right amen now what is the beautiful thing about this this is the seven churches like this the seven seals a brother asked me this one time said brother Simon what was the importance of the seals tell me what you know about the seals what is the main point of the seals I said well the first one was a white horse rider was brought forth to deceive the second was the red horse rider was that the kill to wipe out the Christian sixteen million killed understand and then the next one was to to uh to take the money the wealth of the world the other ones to bring for death right he said brother you got it all wrong I go what he said you missed the revelation of the seals I got what and I took it very humbly I was like of what the seven seals was about he said brother it was it only revealed the semi sea was only revealed not only he's not only the working of the Antichrist spirit but it revealed that God had a combating anointing for each one that would that would overcome it the revelation behind the seals was that God had something you see that's like I never thought that was pretty good and you know that's exactly what the problem said he says now notice as the Antichrist went forth he went forward on his feasts of ministry there God sent forth a beast to combat it Oh God had this all planned what one beast four beasts four seven Church ages Satan had four different types for seven church ages for what is the number of deliverance hey man I just got done with a job in Clyde Ohio setting these these big huge generators and there was for everything I was doing was for for for for you know forests is the number of deliverance how many beasts now watch he says then every time the Beast rode on his horse the Antichrist rode on his horse and on his beast to announce his ministry God sent his beast also and he was on that - announced to combat to it now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like the squad the Spirit of God raises a standard against a man every time the antichrist spirit rode out with a horse a horse a different kind of annoying thing what God would send us like this would send a living creature anointing defeated so when the enemy would have the Antichrist gods had a certain type of power out to meet him and he went out again is a right Horace berry color of all power another ministry God step one set another app another one after him to come combat it to hold his church all right you know these things now look here back to Daniel as the king Nebuchadnezzar tells Daniel this dream Daniel starts the interpretation he says he says King he is this tree the street trees as it is thou o King that are grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown in a three Stern to heaven and they didn't Dominion to the end of the earth and where is the King saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven and saying hew down the tree and destroy it look at verse 24 this is the interpretation or Kang and this is the decree of the Most High that has come up upon the upon my lord the king that they shall Drive thee from man who's they and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make the eat the grass the oxen and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven these are the Watchers so who's gonna bring this kingdom down for seven churches what is God going to use to bring the kingdom down seven churches look at this here and all this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar and at the end of 12 months he walked into the palace of the kingdom of Babylon and the King spake and said is not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom of my might of my power and by and for the honor of my majesty while the world was Word was yet in the Kings mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying O king Nebuchadnezzar to deed has spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be as the beasts of the field they shall make the grass as oxen seven times shall pass over thee the type here now look what it says if you notice what takes place as the Word of God went forth the decree of the Holy One of God Almighty comes down since your kingdom has departed notice there's four stages it's a Nebuchadnezzar the same hour was fulfilled a thing upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men driven a lion which is the strongest among beasts turneth not away for any sure the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed the secrets upon his servants the prophets the lion roars who'll not fear the Lord God has spoken who can but prophesy the God said your kingdom is a part of what the God has spoken woe unto you to desire the day Lord to what end is it for you for the day of Lord is darkness and not light as if a man did flee from a lion God sent that first lion anointing - what - run Nebuchadnezzar out of his palace into the wilderness notice lion anointing lion came and down now look here what it says in the first church age I know thy works and thy labour their patience and how thou cannot bear them which are evil I mean if this is a type of the seven churches which it is and that has tried them which say they are not which are apostles and are not and found them liars look a the prophet says now cannot spare them which are evil these Asians believe that God's people ought to be holy according to this verse they took steps to keep the body unleavened from sin a man they drove out the wicked what would that lion anointing a man praise be to God he says most evidently the EPOXI was already started seeing that enter into the church but they were obedient to the words of paul when they said put away put away the wicked from amongst them that lion anointing on that first church age ran the false out ran the sin out ran I'm free to the Word of God everything contrary to the Spirit of God ran it out and now we see what that lion anointing had run out Nebuchadnezzar as well they come out of the world and now that we're going to going to let the church enter among them they would not put up with the signature holiness wasn't a phrase to them or a figure of speech it was a way of life hey man he said no notice he says the Antichrist road first him teaching ministry now watch the one that went to meet him the lion the lion true true tribe of Judah which is the word when his false teaching went forth the true word went out to meet him and exposed him he said they are not a not true apostles and they're not true Jews amen now he said that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was a Living Word oh my like a living creature hallelujah he says in the tie and he says in the form was his form in the form of the lion I would you to riding out to combat that aim so the first thing judges Nebuchadnezzar drive him out a man running for chase him with that lion anointing and he's four and that first watcher did exactly that now the next thing to take place that that took hold of him was he did eat grass as an ox hmm what if her just runs it sure does lion now this has kind of two types here let's look at both of them here's a Balak talking with with mo heaven and all these things and they're looking at Israel and they're seeing Israel destroying everything every battle and more of some of the elders a minion now shall this company link up all around as an oxen lick a--the up the grass of the field so what will this false sure Oh Dominion that Nebuchadnezzar represents and falls Gentile church changes at both Gentile oxen anointing hit him and made him what eat grass notice now this is religious and Hebrews 5 11 and 12 13 14 notice if a true if you were truly religious if you're if you're son of God daughter of God if you're if you're saved what does the Bible set you will eat he says you will either milk or meat but this anointing hit this King and I was like that's when you refuse the truth you'll never have milk or meat again you able to eat right off the dust of the ground just like an animal but sons and daughters of God they'll take the milk and don't eat the meat just like Eagles amen absolutely now moving on in the same out of the single spilled upon Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did he grass like an oxen and his body was wet with the dew first anointing he was run out by the lion second he started destroying licking up the grass of the children of God like crazy and he would not but now notice and his body was [Music] [Music] as the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now has a little strength and has kept my word and has denied my name [Music] already mentioned how these strength was returning it was what this mist and the power of the Inquisition had wane people had left their homelands notice that Nebuchadnezzar quit eating at this time he was done eating licking the grass but now watching he was covered with Dew the people had left their homelands and demanded freedom worship the yoga the hierarchy was being broken the governments were fighting it was not wise to champion one segment against another in fact well-meaning but poorly led people are willing to wage war to defend perhaps the greatest show of strength the greatest show of strength of religion in this age was the fact that though France fell and revolution break Leslie and revival kept the revolution away from Great Britain and saved her to be an instrument of God in the hand of God for many wars the preaching of the word memories of the do shall come from haven't dropped on that body cover it the preaching of the word was never greater and that man age and that do just God using his Watchers you'll see the eyes living creatures the throne guards were sent to destroy us as sage and raised up his hordes of free thinkers as the originators of commies rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy where's God raise up mighty warriors of faith and the greatest works of Krissy's is the greatest works of Christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has his preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be all the doctrines of God they were identifying the Catholic Church's Antichrist before this message even though he says never has his preachers and teachers in math and never will he be the Spurgeon the Parkers the Clarence the Edwards the bunions the Muellers brenards the bars the bishops all came from this era they preached taught and wrote the word they glorified the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar he was driven from men lying anointed and if he eat grass as an ox the Ox anointing and his body was wet with the dew of heaven man anointing to his hairs were grown like Eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws notice this anointing at the end is so powerful it actually started a body change he started looking he was so close notice notice this anointing the ego anointing made the force look so close to an ego of mine and the Bible says in Matthew 24:24 their very elect shall not be deceived amen if it were possible worthy was he an eagle no more like a vulture hawk maybe kalkan she'll his hairs will grow like Eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws not an eagle but notice the anointing from that living creature was so powerful it started to take effect on your body see how comfy now that let ego anointing that is now that is what where's the Eagle anointing the rough is bringing what the prophet the Word of God the mistress now Justin what you're starting to get like we are getting ready for the flight man now at the end of these seven years or seven church ages what is the point what is God trying to see what is God trying to convey here at God God told the Holy One came down he was with his watcher it's always watch this you were down until the time of seven seven years be over the time of seven church agent know her for what to be know what is what does God trying to convey here and at the end of the days I had never can either lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and one day these evil people that are want to take over the world and destroy and kill millions upon billions upon billions they have the heart of the beast that is not even that is a [Music] revelation and at the end of the days I never can either lifted up my eyes in the heaven and my understanding returned unto me they're gonna have a revelation right they're gonna realize how evil they'd been he says and what and I blessed the most high and praised and honor to him that liveth forever and ever whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion his kingdom is from generation to generation what is it going to cause every knee every King every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord praise be to God and all the heavens the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his own will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants and none can stay his hand or say to him what does no one can mess with Jesus he is God he does as he pleases and he'll do what he does until he's done with it hey man and at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory my kingdom is mine honour and brightness returned to me and my counselors and my Lords sought unto me and I was established in my kingdom and actually excellent majesty was added unto me now I never Knesset November God did this all to the head of gold [Music] [Music] [Music] he was showing what God was showing at the end all these Kings would say Jesus Christ is the king of kings now I never can answer phrasing is off the honor and honor the king of heaven all whose works are truth in his ways judgment and those that walk and pride he is able to abase what will it be like that when that door shuts let's say the heavens are rolled away as a scroll what's that blew up in the sky what's that black in the night what if that all rolls away [Music] mine was the original and there is where the Antichrist came up in combat and he raised up another power we sent a power to meet it and then the last power brings down the Eagle to restore the children back to the original faith again of their fathers he says the Eagle then you notice there is no more beast that's all of it see this is all prophesied all the way back in Daniel in the Book of Revelations amen that's all over that's the end now you'll have to take now if you would have would take now revelation I'm be referring to it he says all the mysteries God revealed the eagle a man now let's stand it's been an hour just over an hour's stand stretched a little bit I know it was just a long teacher I'm sorry I just that's just how I built we're just hobos all right here now here's what I want to hit the saints of God as as the heathen will come to the revelation the realization that he is going and God would use his throne guards to break down these kingdoms if the seven churches these religious entity these religious leaders although God is using these annoyances to destroy him to prove they can't even mess with the strong guard the lone God and I remember those strong guards are what extensions are attributes of God himself not was the Lion of the tribe of you he is the lion tribe of Judah he was an oxen lay down his life a burden sacrifice he was the very wisdom of God he is he knows all it is he's also neatly oh he's a prophet he's a seer you can see at all he's wrote at all he knows it all and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and the true witness I put that in here just cuz he is the true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back there in Revelations 3 7 now you recall it does not mean true as in contrast with false Jesus as a richer deeper meaning by far it expresses perfect realization and contrast partially this came up in the Laotian churches perfect or real realization is coming now back in Philadelphia nage and the Lord was drawing nigh what great love that age manifested for him it reminds me of those words in 1st Peter 1:8 who whom whom having not seen you love and whom also you now not see yet believing you rejoice with unspeakable joy and full of glory with them we rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him as much as our limiting senses can let us but one day it will be face to face this is there that is for this age he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization complete realization how though he says we've been looking through a glass darkly but soon we'll be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him honestly like him Jesus our Savior divine isn't that wonderful we are completing him that is true he would not lie to us about it but one day we'll be changing the atoms we will put on immortality we were swallow be swallowed up in this life then we will realize realization I think on this we all know him as a provider I'm gonna have a job or has who gave us a job Jesus Christ every one of us has been sick and who was healed us in Jesus Christ we know him as so much as a friend when I was when I'm lonely I say Lord and you feel his presence come down you want to commune with him in a lot of time not even for his sake just for yours so you can feel comforted you know sometimes you need to gotten flesh sometimes needs to God one time I my apprentice had died and I was brokenhearted he was my little brother and I couldn't sleep at night I was praying in the woods I just I was a mess I got up one time at 3:00 in the morning what went down and read first John the entire book and God just said everything to rest just that book of love and just how it it just did something for my soul just calm to me and just settle me down and was able to write back to sleep battle anymore after that but we know God is a deliverer but we are look that kind of stuff is so minimal so tiny amount of information we know about him but when we get to the point when we get these bodies that we are going to realize we are really going to see all that he's about we're really going to get back and look at see how much he really loved us how much he cared for us how he washed our every step every question your past house in the world just when he was in world how many of us how old but there's a lot of things that happen they're in time I don't have but I did I have as you look back always can see how he kept us from making this decision no everything is going to be made [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay I know it's a couple sword for they met you guys song on your heart though he's the one and after Fifi Malachi struggle try to swap her with her we fought salamé struggle delivery I remember the four piece and said in Revelation 5 Amen up here I'll put them right on the spot so dressed ready for service will order god bless harvest look at that why don't you just it's the in season out of season [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
