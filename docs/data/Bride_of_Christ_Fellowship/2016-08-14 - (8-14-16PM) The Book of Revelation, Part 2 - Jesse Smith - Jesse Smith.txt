me Barack pause amen Jesus still amazes us praise God let's take our Bibles and stand if you came here by the grace of God to look like to look at the book of Revelation part two tonight you open up the chapter to please a revelation to chapter 2 I want to just take a familiar text out of here like to read verses four and five revelation to four and five last Sunday night was a real blessing to me just to see how the prophet taught at the book of Revelation it shows you how to get authority over Satan the revelations contained in the book of Revelation give you authority over Satan Satan hates that book so much their brother Graham said Jesus himself wrote the whole book of Revelation all by himself the only book that he wrote all by himself through the proper job other than Ellison the revelation book of symbols this week 9056 quite a short little but nice little message there and talks about this versus four and five now I want to look again it tonight it the Holy Spirit of course and how the Antichrist spirit it tries to deceive through thought the church age so we'll try to get a little bit further like I smell trying to keep it short again tonight by God's grace the same strength patience I'm sorry revelation 2 45 let's read it together let's read verse 45 together one two three let's begin now les I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thigh first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent let's have a word of Prayer of our heads if I mean on your hearts they can own up to God I will pray how many father we love to pray we love to read your word we love to sing these beautiful songs but for the lord for his gift their time you invest into that Lord is such a privilege it just reduces me to extend up here and sing i'm not a really of us a bunch of a song leader but to hear those songs and sing it renews my heart Lord and strengthened to me so much thank you for amazing grace my patient father Savior and friend Lord hallelujah Jesus we love you so much Lord take this word here tonight blessed it we read help us to overcome the Antichrist fear Lord Lord Lord our church in our homes our families going on our jobs as we walk in the spirit Lord God and door door just open up to us here tonight we ask all these things mean every need in Jesus Christ in every said amen god bless you mean see their praise God so I got another slide show here I want to show the corners again HK my to thinking system appreciate that so I want to again focus on and I'll bring the quotes back up I think was everybody was here last Sunday night when you were here at us is right I don't also when he look like office work so I have to review too much but we kind of last week we looked at some of the quotes by the brand of news there about the importance he hates to be exposed right members say hates the exposed and the Book of Revelations expose them for what he is a liar murderer all these things we showed how brother Branham said the hearts are only turned back through the revelations contained in the seven thunders which are the revelations contain the seven seals so we really need to know the seals well right because that's the rebel that's what the Thunder said those revelations containing the seals so God has really helped us to understand that it's one of my favorite they you know recently office when I share this real quick here as we get the part two but I told you a family member of one of the most famous preachers of that the message has been contacting you over and over and they said over the random plagiarize the seven seals from Clarence markets so I said enough of this I think i mighta thought this I hope I thought it up I went and I went online to Claire's Larkins books and I read all his chapters on the first seven seals well the seventh all the seven seals and I found a few key words that brother branham used but as far as the revelations only one out of the seven was the same thing for the Brandon preaches Larkin preached and these people are saying over and over again all those blaspheming right almost by seeing God's sacred name and his word of Revelation saying that brother man plagiarize it let me tell you this Clarence Larkin said all four of the first four horse riders are all future at the time of Armageddon he said that her and brother branham said they've already happened 2,000 years ago I mean how the church I don't know how people can be so delusional and so I run this w end up bad way in a humble way I wrote that person back and said six out of seven are completely different the only one that was the same as the fifth one about the Jews being the soldier Luella that's when that market actually got right by the Holy Spirit okay the seventh one market made nothing about it so I ran had more on that but she said with the date of our coming of the Lord so that is such a striking fitting I'm so glad the Lord happy preset back in 2009 i think i went through the seals because as soon as somebody said that my heart something my heart i clicked you know that the thirst for life you know that life that protects you and said that's you know that's not what there's no way brother branham did that if no way brother I'm talk with Clarence Larkin dude when I went and found it out I found them to be liars and I found these people to be liars and they're saying a brother man plagiarized the seven seals he did not play he tries to seven seals here's a few the same terms like about the seventh seal being the end of all things that's different ones like that but it was not plagiarized bankers my man said the Holy Spirit met him every day to reveal each seal to him praise God and said it was thus saith the Lord afterwards so it was I just want to share that real quick that that a lot of times people say these things but but you can't fool God's elect because God play something inside of here that's greater than that greater than deception that cannot be deceived amen now here's the quote out from last week I really wanted to just kind of go a little bit deeper I just felt led to go in this direction tonight I you know I started studying us on monday so these things I'm building in today was no started later earlier in the week Satan those are surely at the original Church of Pentecost with the power of God mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless amen I just want you to see that by the grace of the Lord there now let's look at this so the thought came to be like this how does the Antichrist fear coming to the church what did we learn from the book of Revelation that show the movement of the Antichrist fear well this is the first thought that came to me this was answer the king of my heart I have to look at the first three chapters over the first two and three chapters of Revelation chapter two and three bad about first one but the second third and then I would look at the for the first four seals because all those deal with the church age is that right right so that was the answer that came to my heart I this would be really something to see it through the scripture and then just take a few messages on it and brother also i'm still working on that sermon on symbols i got about twenty Sybil's the book of Revelation with what they mean so I'm going to preach yes so for you buddy and a little bit of less the church to you but because you got a question about well you know what are these symbols the Bible interprets all praise God so I was studying the leopard this week I was again the leopard and how Daniel saw in danger 7 and then John saw in Revelation 13 and so I was looking at well it's the leopard and what's the bear what's up I look like this week and we're trying to preach on that soon by the grace of the Lord all these symbols okay now recall so before we get to those church ages recall the message for each age was for both the true and false by how many realize that when Jesus is speaking of the Church of Ephesus in Smyrna and her demos and bio Tyra and all these things he's talking to both vines because both vines say they are the true church praise God and one of them is saved one of them's lost my goodness so he has to speak to both because both are claiming to be his bride that right doesn't the Catholic Church it claimed to be the the Queen of Heaven now they say Mary's be in heaven but they believe they're a part of that too they claim that but I heard it brother I wrote in the church age book that we're the Queen of Heaven the Bride of Christ is the queen of heaven because Christ is the kingdom happen and we're married to the king amen so let's read that I want you to see this quote because it's a real good quote here by the grace of the Lord when something just struck here how to vote stop here okay so let's look at this here on this little quotation I tried to make it a little bigger is that a little bit bigger to read I try to make it 50 hopefully a lot to do bigger next time I try to do a little bit bigger brother games it is such a great child I was I was really proud to have you done a good job on the tech now get you can teach me a few less I'm still trying to play with it and get the running out of funds still pretty small okay so chapter 10 from our studies we've already learned that much of the revelation is totally understood I'm sorry 20 misunderstood because we not formally known that the church spoken up and spoken to in this book does not refer to the bureau ecclesia the elect the body of Christ the bride but it speaks to the entire body and people were called Christians whether they may be true or merely nominal as all Israel is not Israel so all Christians are not Christians as it is that a great thought so when we read the book of Laodicea are we the ones that are rich and miserable poor blind and naked no aren't you glad I knew you when i read that sister ready for the awesome I did not see myself as a blind literacy walking around that's lukewarm I see myself as a burning fire hot Oh dios no Christian yes I got my mistakes nice body but when it comes out of the brain and seeking God and walking the spirit i believe on one of those on fire Christians amen if I'm not somebody coming to correct me show me round sin and I want to walk in the light as he's of Allah praise God so that's such an encouragement to me I know he's not speaking to me now i mighta been as a sinner I might've been flood but now my eyes have been enlightened praise God and that's not speaking to me anymore that's speaking of the Falls find the denomination's thing there or anyone caught with the spear of the nomination ilysm thus we learn that the church is made up of two binds the true the boss the two bonds are motivated by two kinds of spirits one has the Holy Spirit while the others in do with the spirit of Antichrist both claims had no to be known of God I velocity went to that Christian Fellowship number of United scope they claim to be a gun right so how do you know who's due by the word the only way you can know who's really Christian is do they keep the word because jesus said if you love me you keep a commander lyrics that that's the only way to know who's really who sick and welcome personally all the word but he can't keep all the word real adversity he impersonally the rapture harold camping right he tried to predicted hey that was not the spirit of christ that was the spirit of Antichrist he tried to predict the rapture 2014 right that was he tries to impersonate that but he can never be at a man he could never live it but we can live in a van the bride of christ lives the full word of god let's say it only impersonates it only way he knows who really lives the Word of God glory both purport to speak for gonna both believe certain very basic truths and differ on others so I felt like you're saying we believe in the cross like they believe in the cross right but when you talk to that they said well you can be sprinkled at Baptist now can we find one in the Bible brother have to be fined up of a sprinkling the Bible though we did a baptism 50 study this week that you never seen it you never seen sprinkling the Bible so the Bible is the standard we're judged by jesus said so and st. Paul said so you'll be judged by this work amen now like I like this look at it but since both bear the name of the Lord be called Christians and by such name bearing obviously claimed a relationship to him cause of marriage now god holds them responsible God's both responsible to him and therefore speaks to each now this church honestly this opened up the idea of how Jesus can block things off the book of life they are claiming to be his mouthpiece they are leaving I got life I'm a Christian all these things like that but if they add to the word take away Jesus will got their names off the book see because we don't know who the true boss is but the false is so deceptive because they're saying they're the true they're saying they're true were saying were true the only way to know is who's got the word Christ is the showdown between denominations and creeks are you with me Alleluia only way he knows the word we've got a prophet cut like you saw the middle of the houses he said the Sith Lord water baptism is only the name of Jesus Christ he said father son Holy Ghost are sprinkling is wrong I'll say that the Lord said that that's god that's got talking and that's God and that's just one small doctored think about the hundreds of others that we could go on but I hope we can see this this is why Jesus can bother name up there claiming to be his bride or then they transgressed through iniquity the Bible said because of iniquity I'd never knew that we further learned that these two vines would grow up side-by-side unto the end of the ages when both would come to maturity and both be harvested by hallelujah come on look at this next statement the first fight would not overcome and destroy the true bond haha hallelujah but then neither would the true by be able to bring the falsified into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ my so church listen if you're in a saving relationship with Jesus Christ tonight you must be the true mind haha yeah because you were taken out of the bows fine and it grafted into the true bond Amen Alleluia that's beautiful man they'll never be able to overcome us although we grow side by side and our branches in no sometimes will rub shoulders with them sometimes and the church that's why I don't know who cerfancy is that's why don't call people Surrency because the branch is all mixed together I'm not God now if God anoints me like Paul to call somebody child of the devil when I say it but until I am knowing it that way I don't know who to all I know is I was make myself ready praise God I was we washed at my last trip might that be set in order my life must be sent order by the Word of God he's done and then by fires burning bright that's all I could do and and try to call out into the gospel of Christ amen now I want to look at this here I preach this when I preached um the seven seals I think back in February or January I preachers just a message on the seven seals to rehearse it now the next picture shows the 4 horse riders but I want to review this because it ties in perfectly what we see as we read the first um I'm sorry has we read the second third chapter of Revelation so we want to again look at the evil progressive work of the four horse riders we want to look at that by the grace of the Lord I'll check in my notes there they had some other thoughts as I was listen to brother branham preach a revelation book of symbols i was taking out some mental notes here okay now this is a pretty descriptive picture my thought was a beautiful painting look at that that's pretty good if the white horse rider he's got a Harrow and no I'm sorry bono harrows red horse rider black horse rider with the balances and you got your pale horse rider now that right there is the same Antichrist sphere and four different forms it's one sphere how he worked throughout the 2,000 2,000 years of church ages ok that's the Antichrist spirit now I'm going to refer back to this so when you read the first four seals and you learn about the four horse riders it shows how Satan comes in with deception under the white horse rider right and then he starts killing others with your words or literally sadly and then he goes to death right I'm sorry to control everything check out them black the dark ages he started to control money in control powers and builds on Kingdom and then spiritual death sensing right that Fagan's progressive nature mercy comes by deception gets worse worse worse worse worse all the way to leads the spiritual death now what you do is listen this I don't know the exact quote but brother great have said death spiritual death had already entered into the beach in church age because Jesus offered the overcomers a tree of life my aunt Olivia that's in chapter 10 of the George a horrible so what I'm saying is that this spirit would work progressively over the church age it would also work any church age that's going to statement that's true his brother might have said that they had spiritually died some in the first original church any to be searching had backslidden so that my spirit came on and eventually they died spiritually all right Paula said it pause that they can be dead while they're alive Turk said that right so see this fear it works over the course unban owes the whole church age when it also battles individuals with any church age does that make sense this is a little deeper I know that's why I'm trying to just go slower like that I thought that was a glorious picture as far as saurons ha ebo an awful Satan is he deceives you I was a bluff and then then he kills influence that he tries to rule and reign with domain and then he kills you spiritually ah they got it from the power of the tree of life hey Ben the Word of God Christ Jesus amen now this way I talk about from Austin now the east for horse ride I got four play for horses that they're not as pretty as those horses because I I just got them all different pictures this is what I'm talking about austin since since Jesus resurrected here all right in here that's right there we've had 2,000 years of church ages and these four riders represent the four forms of the Antichrist here that would anoint these people and battle these Christians through the for ages praise God is that no compared everybody okay she the white horse he battled the episode church age and summer nuh and then the red horse battle part the end of summer de in the Peugeot most and a half of bacteria and then the black horse battled most of the authority saris Philadelphia and then the pale horses variety here in the limousine church eat his mother Graham said thus saith the Lord Pentecostal church organization is dead spiritual death he's preaching the fourth seal spiritual death has entered in the denominations that right so it's a very serious thing it's important thing so I wonder review that that the Antichrist fear works over the course of the church age would also individually in each church age and on an individual level and here's the slide you can see I change slides now because this is from that message back in january-february these four horse riders attempt to ride in the lives of individuals as well as writing in the church page okay and here's how it is the white horse rider is the deceptive introduction of sin and that the acceptance of sin that begins as a sin and ends as a fake authoring doctrine that's how that's how it always sit as Christians normally we will just a simple will be deceived or will accept some sin and look so wholly or it's just as deceptive it looks so right it feels so good it doesn't seem like it would be a problem force but that's how Satan deceives us it comes in as deception and then that sin if it's not repent enough it grows into a killing mentality it takes piece from our lives how many can say men that it happens to me when I get like a mine now so then peace will leave for my mind I peace anymore I got evil thoughts for this or this that I still appreciate critical spirit message but I haven't gotten to again that's what brother Brandon battle um I need would just criticize everything he said looked up the voice of healing he criticized the rivers there you look at the newspaper he criticized every ministry and I'd only do that church I want to end it on the build-up ministry right I don't want to discourage romance and I gotta get rid of that critical spirit so see that's how state comes in our lives first he deceives us right we let him in and then we start losing our Orbeez he takes piece from us that's good next we become concerned about ourselves on this case we would build our own Kingdom or build our own platform we've got our own ministry maybe that God hasn't called us to do but we just tried to establish our own it becomes a life of pride maybe a ministry of pride it's easy to see how this could attack preachers of course they go for wealth and influence and try to establish their own Kingdom in a local church which I'm not trying to do the context got here vote me out praise God be happy serving the Lord somehow is that about me I'm nothing we're all grown up and we need to subscribe dinner but uh that's how it advances that you become focused on yourself and it builds itself up and then impale is spiritual death now that's never happen any of us right that's never taking any bus that's why you're here tonight glory right that hasn't happen you haven't crossed the line for mercy in the judgment you haven't crossed that line but a spiritual death does take people and is it it's totally awesome so spiritual death of pale horse rider brother have said he'll take his last ride in the tribulation anointing the Antichrist person look up last ride in the fourth seal 1963 in March abundant he takes his last ride so he's riding now when he makes his final ride through the boat or the Antichrist during the Tribulation Period and he'll seek to control the whole world member and force everyone to take a mark in their hand or the forehead that's his final ride amen here's the examples here's an example of the white horse rider riding in deception with e is not in that perfect that's a perfect example Eve was the seed and the servants that you are not surely not right and what the scriptures say the woman Adam was not deceived but the woman being to see was in the transgression I member I fair shake and free what happened to offspring scape and let's read that the future Bob else read Genesis 3 then 4 though I know you read it but let's uh I want you to I want you to see it again because I keep saying that to you and I we've never run together okay thank you sir dennis is 315 now if you know the story they fall in verse 6 i'm sorry Keith balls and gives it to her husband and verse 6 as well as soon as this happened look at verse 13 and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled mean I didn't eat so she was totally to see and begat means to seduce she was seduced her morals were seduced Jackie thought it was right to partake of this fruit with the circle she was seduced verse 14 and what's the Lord saying right after she says this was the Lord saying and the Lord said unto the serpent because that has done this hour cursed above all the cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt go test each other he know today's my life verse 15 and output energy to repeat between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed seed beans offspring so he's already got offspring right and she's going to have some offspring to write that represented Christ it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel speaking of Christ Christ would smash the Serpent's head her authority over sin and death right and then he would be bruised he would die and brother just so you know that's one of the first prophecies of Jesus Christ in the Bible now there's foreshadowing also in Genesis to that speaks of Christ but that's that as soon as they said you can see it now here's two seats two seats go to proverbs 30 brother because i I've never show you this scripture it's okay i just want to reduce is that okay to everybody I just want him to see this out grace no this is a powerful revelation and it proves why Jesus had to become virgin birth because sin came through sexual contact geez have come by way of urgent that bypass waist in enter in the world to make a new perfect human race perfect by the blood through the Holy Ghost amen okay but Austin robbers 30 verse 20 can you read verse 20 breath brother so it is the way of an adulterous woman she Edith wiped her mouth and say if I had done no leakage amen so here's a simple eating is a symbol of what adultery so sexually i eating it so she eats fight from out and so I've done no wickedness but the Bible said it was a dull treat to see this symbolism there the symbolism that's why the Bob said she partook of the fruit doesn't say Apple right it doesn't say Africa right we talked about the heck is this fruit and here the Bible the Bible interprets itself so that the Bible says here's a woman eating a fruit and the fruit is adultery praise God so that proves it in the scripture and their course there's other scriptures to it on time for I want you to see that is this is how this is out sin end of the world she was deceived saying always deceives us usually right deceives us we think it's all this is okay this won't hurt my relationship with the Lord and it deceives us and that's Houston comes it as a white horse right now the next one I had an example I was a male p or each other this a while back about casting down altars of bayonne leave each one sermon on I never had time really to go back and minister on that but I like to order buddy but numbers 25 1 through 3 and Israel bowden Tim and the people began to commit horn with the daughters of Moab and they call the people in the sacrifice of their gods and the people that he and bow down to their gods so brother but this is talking about the church age as well but they had them deceived and trick that we're all the same right because they had seven up seven bullets that member of Balaam sacrifice and Moses anchored by seven bullets too and what I think was the piece of trumpets if i'm not mistaken for the sacrifice senator Tabernacles so beethoven personated Moses right and so they come here they're all to see and pretty soon sitting manifests itself through a sexual sin just like E and then 24,000 or maybe for the door Sarah thought maybe it's less than that but thousands of them died because of that okay now here's the red horse example that might happen your daily life you might get see what's in and then it might lead to something else here's where the Bible says it but I say music who Stroger is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment right remember this week we tell this a few weeks ago if you say um okay and whosoever shall say there's brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool should be need to help her remember the word fool there means godless were calling somebody a cerfancy or devil so if you call somebody a devil and they're not a devil you're a danger Hellfire and you'll have a cause for it danger Hellfire so words are very important are they not very important so that's example of the red the red horse the progressive power though of the NRA spear where you attack others and you have no cause to do it and just because you let's sit in and it deceive you and now it builds and multiplies and becomes more powerful right here's an example of the black horse as it as it manifests and grows bigger remember the black horse wants to control everything right so here Jesus says beware the second describes and desire to walk in long robes and love greetings the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts see they built their Kingdom you see that the black horse rider captured the wealth of all the kingdoms and control the economics and had their own kingdoms and so far so here once the Santa Christ fear progresses past just you know deception and and with the red with killing influence now that starts building its own Kingdom every sec that's one of the black horse here's another one the Bible said in John 9 22 if any man did confess he was the Christ he should be put out a synagogue that's I was telling you earlier brother Austin at lunch when Jesus came all the churches hated him all the established churches hated him and so he would go to the day the same thing would happen today because he's the same guy straight today in forever right and so that's what we see that's why the churches rejected brother branham like we talked about because he preached against their sin Jesus preach against their sin and they hated him but that's an example of the black horse progressing in people's lives they keep people they kicked you out of their church they don't want nothing to do with of it they're real Christian a real Christ believe now here's a pale horse example when lust has conceived unless of course the wife of course concede it gets bigger and bigger bringing for Sid and sitting when it's finished bringing bored death so that's the that's the whole for horse/rider is right there a nutshell right because lost starts the losses what get you deceive right that's what God even deceive a bob said she look at server and less of that first beauty that's true and then it brings for death so that just struck me right there there's the whole 44 horse riders in one scription right there amen father didn't because it's hard to lust deception and goes down to death glory we read this the end of those things is death so the fruit of sin is death right and here's the scripture read earlier this proves that the progression of the Antichrist spirit was already taking place in the first church age because Paul was the message of the first church age deficit searched she that lives in pleasures dead watch live amen she used to be a widow she used to serve God then she left the things of God for deception and she got so long from God but now she enters from the spiritual death see how see how the center that is see how powerful the Antichrist spirit is the only thing that could overcome him is the Holy Spirit and that's what we got again how did it again Corey now now I'm going to get into this some new stuff that was a review for Mac light in February so I thought I thought that was helpful that helpful I think it's a good review can only reach one sermon on and it was only like five minutes I want you to see that now church that's helpful now as you go throughout your week if you see deceptive where this if you see you're already in a bind and some cid well go back and find where that I let it get where did I let it get in and i watch the wrong thing not say the right thing now this is the wrong thing right what did I do wrong I make a wrong move on the job what did I do okay that's why we want to see that because it helps me in my life too so I can trace back i see all this is where i should have studied the word i should have did this I sure did that and you can see where sin entered it that's right okay now the new things here brother random said remember through the book of Revelation you can see how the Antichrist fear works there right so what I did is I read through all the seven churches the letters that cries wrote to them and then John right and I looked and saw what was the NFI spirit doing any church age so we'll have time to go through a little bit of this I won't be able to get through all seven because I didn't have enough time I'll spend all my time on the astronaut message for this morning I think it I don't think I only up to the fourth church age so pardon me on that but maybe we'll go no further we'll see so in Ephesus the Antichrist spirit would attempt to do what if you read it let's read it let's go there a revelation to remember if we can recognize how Satan works in the book of Revelation we can have authority over him praise God and we heard these things before but I wanted just to an overview of them to refresh with you because you know what you're never going to stop battling devil while you're here you're never going to stop battle so we need to pay attention so we never spiritual our spiritual mind listening here I've been focused on the lord here tonight Gloria now its first form piner this was our text that's why I chose to read this read his text rather nevertheless I have someone against thee because I was left I first love so what does he have against the church they love their first love November let me stop there who's he talking to he's talking to two bodies he's talking to The True Vine he's talking to the fall smart one of them will never repent but one of them will take a day yes sir first I remember from with our phone and what repent the true eyes will do that she will remember how she used to live her life how far she falling from that first walk and shall we bet and get back there and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of this place except thou repent remember what a brother Ram say about this weather man said Ephesus in a few short decades the church there was all scattered because they failed to repent and God took the church he scattered church right away that's right so no matter how hot on fire we are we got to keep feed that fire amen keep feed the fire he drove wood on the fire Deadwood right not living it bigger the desert could possibly be pretty Scott and he dead works and he did then ideas anything that's bad throw it on their keeper fiber all right now the second thing they would do is inject the deeds of the doc I'm sorry the deeds of the Nicolaitans now let's read about both of these because I just pulled some general quotes about these this is the me let me just say this this is an overview right for me to fully priestess I'd have to do like I did for landscape reach five service on the limousine church age at the end of last year and I have it just felt led to do that yet with the other six sure changes but I just felt really impressed to preach on layer to see I like you for each other once I just haven't done that but I'd like to now here's first love quotes also in that age the true church had lost its first love but that love was typify as the love of bride and groom at their marriage and early years of married life there was a cooling off of that I'm sorry cooling of that complete love and abandonment to God he's God so think about when you first gave your heart to the Lord do you have that first feeling of love and I'm a banded the things in the world and all I want it's Christ amen that's that's your first love totally abandon unto God a band of the things of the world and I'm living for Jesus Christ all my love complete love and I'm giving my whole life to Him Lord leaving its first love of the word of God was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was Pentecost where he's come so that's the importance of our first love we must be fully in love and fully committed fully abandon unto God amen glory now let's forget the diesel Nicolaitans this is one thing that ever preached on but I saw I was reading today I brother branham said Jesus hates those three things the decent Engel Aiden's of the doctrine acquaintance and a doctrine of Balaam as well he hates those three things now the church was in that first age already a fallen woman as say they got the e before Adam even now and Satan seduced the church the Bride of Christ before the marriage suffered the lab and what specifically was in her myth that caused the fall what the revelation 26 the DS and the Gladers already the first age had turned from following the pure Word of God I was keep going for more about the deeds they turned from God's demand of a church absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon God to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government amen to nikolaev ISM which is organizing a human government within the church which as all governments to legislate for the people in other words they make laws for the church right humans make laws instead of God making laws and if we make a law in better be in the scripture praise the Lord it's got to be in the scripture like we're talking about here Elaine right often the scripture says a mention of short hair that's what we have right but women don't have volume here that's not my fault that's the Bible's law praise the Lord so but nickel and ism is conquering the laity and they do that by making their own laws ruling over the people by human laws human government instead of the word of God they did exactly what Israel did they took the X expediency I'm human government instead of the word of the Spirit ok so there's another picture brother just so you can see it there so the white horse rider wrote in his main his main deception of that our was to get them to leave their first love cool them off well I don't fully devote your life to god you know have to go all that way to have to be a fanatic like you used to be cool off a little bit and also in inject oh I forgot should say deeds of the Nicolaitans Irish and take dr. that's the next age forgive me that should save deeds of the Nicolaitans my man I caught it time to take Stan remember the deeds was well it's just you know it's a good saying we should just we should try to them let's make a tradition on it let's just try to do that let's just do the things the way we want to do it rather than the Word of God and that caused the fall and jesus said if you don't repent that I'm taking the candlestick and the candlesticks represents the Holy Ghost the church takes it out of the church no holy ghost in the church thank god he's in the church event healing people answering prayer hallelujah speaking to us teaching us about glory edifying us amen Lauren I hope you can see that so this is what melanson if we can see how the Antichrist your work it will give us authority over safety other than that let's look at some murder now if you read this in somewhere let's go to chapter 2 verse 9 and then we read 9 and 10 aah babbles too much anything like that maybe have a reason so that gives me look breaking revelation 2 9 and 10 min okay you got that like you to 1910 I know thy works in tribulation and poverty thou art rich and another glass needs that which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan you none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some you interpreted that you maybe try ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I was a man so as I read that what are the two things that I cry spirits try to do he's trying to deceive through boss brother saying they're Jews and by the man said these are men that were actually juste saying they were original Christians they had the original teaching in the original doctrine of the original you know early Christian church like Paul and Peter and James John and different things like that they were just saying we're originals were just like those Jews but the who said Jesus that they're of a synagogue of Satan and the second thing Jesus it was fear not those things which you'll suffer so anybody would try to bring fear of suffering and trials fear he will try to get the bureau will you have to suffer you're gonna have to suffer loss and you're gonna have to have to have trials all these things alright so we see he tries to get you leave your first love right try to get you to take traditions omit to have men rule the church rather than the Holy Ghost then he tries to inject false brethren into the church to deceive the people and say they are apostles and say they are Christians and they're not and it also tries to inject fear into the church of suffering and trials now look let's read the quotes on the back this up now did you catch something here isn't that the same spirit right in the church today isn't there a group now the speaking of those that say they choose it or not isn't there a group that claims their original and true church and that salvation is found only in her who's that the Roman Catholic Church right don't they claim that they have the keys of the kingdom which they received from Peter don't they claim that Peter was their first pope and that he resided in Rome when there is absolutely no historical fact fort now isn't there a variation of this spirit among some message churches or you have to have this revelation on some fig programs going to come back and write different things if you're not part of our budget church or not on the rapture they say that they say you have to have our revelation you're not going to rupture so see there's variations of deception through the Antichrist spirit not neither assessor message believers message believe that Mike Dave hey oh the way to know by their works by their word right because jesus said I know the blasphemy when they say their juice but they're not we're actually straight from hell the Church of Satan he says that's what Jesus says in the message churches of those days here in the suburban church ain't right they say their message creatures but they're not because they make themselves there i'm the only way you got to believe my revelation you're not going to rapture oh my god help me God of all of us praise God it's not my revelation is the prophets revelations that right where's this president we're just repeating the prophets revelation that's all we're doing is sharing his revelation that he received from the Holy Spirit right he's that happen here let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches through the angel the church age and then it's echoed across all the ends of different locations and so forth is his revelations and he got through the Holy Spirit yes now here's the fear part say he's going to try and check fear and like we know we know the pagan Rome spirit Imperial payroll we know the sphere the pair of a robe is telling the back of the merica but ran says let's take the Lord it's good and America is going to persecute Christians but we're not to fear that praise God or not to fear that because we're told not to and amen every time the Lord uses those words fear not there's an engagement at hand which will involve great danger and suffering and deprivation now he does not say in a blood Kurt man or tribulations coming that would frighten one but like a mother was about to turn off the lights at jumping to a child lest he be frightened and he's got a mother love right now don't be afraid or the light will go out and will be dark but remember I'm here with you other than beautiful bodies that's how Jesus tells us about persecution to come he said it's going to get dark but don't be afraid I'm with you always I got to Scripture three scriptures uh prove that Hebrews 13 says for the Lord's that I'll never leave you nor forsake thee right Matthew 28 says Jesus says low I with you alway even unto the end of the ahj menon and then revelation 1 we see one standing like the son of man standing in the midst of the church age how to do you Alyssa the seven candlestick I don't know she said look there he is he always saves in the midst of the seven Church ages he never leaves he said it right in the middle of the events of the church hallelujah she got three scriptures that clearly say he's with you to the end of the church hitch Gloria had no no matter how dark it gets we have the confidence of God's promise that he will never leave us nor forsake glory so he says don't be afraid of man or what he can do to you this is all I was saying earlier remember friday night for those know so this was aa saying earlier a man was committing some domestic violence and I just stayed away what I should have done is I should have walked over there in the power of the Spirit and stood there but if I my sister buddy i was thinkin as he got a gun is he got a gun I think I'm not going to die tonight if I can advise is the night I got because I'm not even what it already been in call right brother venture called 911 I think I am I going on and I decided to stand like 200 or we just sit to attribute away in our heart and I was ashamed in that later I said Lord forgive me because when this becomes a reality you don't fear man because you're not fighting against their the spirit behind that bad so who would who would say with me like I'm saying I need more faith to rise up to be the challenge of the hour I say that I need more faith mean the challenge of the hour I want to share more about that so you do and because that's the area one who clearly see ma I need more thing I need more vain now I'm with you at my grace is sufficient for you when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you praise God not even in death are you defeated you are more than conquerors now for our benefit we were saying we pray right now man we prayed the car that's all I don't know with asking what did i do about distance I don't know pray we just prayed but look the promise of God the grace of God says we have nothing to fear i'm with you and you're more than a conqueror praise god and my brother and said you have trials to show where you're made of right so that trial showed me what I made up I got some more growing to do right there yeah right I had a lot more growing to do by God's grace and some thankful for that I'm ashamed of it and one way but I'm thankful for another week so I want to grow closer school or so I want to give a visual now okay remember the first tube left your first love that's how Satan we can get authority over that and say you can't make me lose my first club I'm going to keep doing the same thing because I've always done right I'm not going to take the DS with Nicolaitans I'm not going to say and run this church we're not the Holy Ghost run this church is we're going to pray for the Holy Ghost elitist church and we see somebody run it on their own creature traditions let's correct them especially with me come to me I'll be happy to take correction but now the only two Antichrist spirits trying to deceive the believers through false brethren saying they're Jews when they're not and their Holy Ghost own original Christian or not and try to bring in the fear of trials but what did God raised up churchy race up the Hawks anointed amen and oxidizing could not be afraid just go to slaughter right the Bible said we're like lambs being led to slaughter every day we die to ourselves remember realize that two kinds of crimes are given one profits given another car that's driven or striving for right the martyrs crowd is the crowd it's given they're given a crime just because their motors and they gave their life but we are given a crowd of our lives if we're not martyrs because we've tried to get said all these years all these funds all these weeks and everything and so we get a crowd of life because we've driven against it amen glory now I think I got Nick one mortar change baby Pergamos I think it's all the cooks like I liked you I listened to the whole chapter chapter 10 to resume the church ages but I didn't get the time to get all the quotes that I wanted Pergamos now that the end of Christ fear do he would attempt to deceive through false doctrine of Balaam and we mentioned that earlier remember it from number 25 we saw how bantam deceived Israel and the doctor of the Nicolaitans let's read I can get your Bibles here if everybody commuters revelation 214 and fifty maybe you can read that brother when you get a revelation to 14 and 15 is interesting there's two doctrines in their pilots for the strange and the program was the third church age they battle too awful the amount of doctrine so rather than 3 14 15 please I have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that pulled the doctrine of Salem who taught they like to cast a stumbling block you put 200 Israel sacrificed unto idols commit fornication so hats now also then that hold the doctrine of the depleted which being my date k mera thank you brother so again jesus said on verse 16 says repent or else I'll come to you quickly by again she was sort of my bad so remember again talking to both binds right true mine falls fire now notice in verse 14 the Bible said because thou has there there so there were some of these preachers of the doctor debate amongst a true vine right because thou hast been he said they are among you right and so they they had to repent and kick out the false doctrine which was a doctor available show that isn't just a moment here and then the doctor Nicolaitans was just advanced version of the deeds of Nicolaitans the deeds was human government human leadership rather the Holy Ghost leadership and now just be coming back or not become the unbending way while everybody's going to do the doctrine of the Nicolaitans this is just the way it's done if you're not we'll kill you right this is the third church age a black horse rider risen up I'm sorry red horse rider now let's look at the doctrine of Baylor this second step was a doctrine of Balaam we're in Balaam top failure to stumble the turn of Israel by a United meetings I read this earlier number 25 they United together first oh it's okay we're all the same church we're all just the same and it wasn't all right to unite like that they are the guests would do two more things contrary to the Word of God you recall that balak needed out to keep his kingdom he called on the most dominant spiritual figure the de balón Balon gave the advice that trapped and destroy Israel alright see now let me just stop him from home we should never want to see other people fall into sin Graham said if you want to see somebody go to hell he said you better get to go to repay I don't want to see any message person or message church or any preacher I don't want to see any of them fall I'm burdened for them I pray for the ones of all way I'm interacting with their family I invited the one of the families to for bible study no wonder they don't want to write I let me love these people with a certain kind of love oh we have my love we can love our enemies love anybody right but to my love but we should never want to see someone both because that's what the spirit of the doctrine of Balaam produced Baylin caught balak how to make other people stumble and sin and I'm just rude and biting them to a meeting brother Graham tells us they have a big feast we're all the same we all the same sacrifice ships having bullocks be upset bullocks and then they commit fornication and led to sexual sin other converse are not verse for the next quote it was first of all to suggest that they all get together and talk things over and eat together get things ironed out oh my goodness mercy Lord after all understanding each other goes a long way so be careful when we if we meet with other people to have a talk it out session we can never compromise we must stay on the Word of God we care wonder whose ground you go on Israel went on air I'm tired of a let's try right let them come on are drowned right let them come on argonne like Elijah said you come up here meet me I know we're supposed to be up here on Mount Carmel you come up and meet me up here haha for the showdown that's right once you accomplish that you can go from there the next step would be worshipping together and of course a little pressure from the host usually makes the guests go a lot further than they did it but also that's why I don't go to many other churches unless I know they believe the truth because that's how say in the seed Israel he invited them off of their church into another trick now they let me preach yes I'm going briefs there how appreciative you denominations says I've been the message but not many because they don't invite me uh but I know I don't let them come and preach here I one time I had a denominational man just give a testimony you might remember that Paul Jackson a black net there's a beautiful testily up just our God raised the dead I told him no pre-tested to see the test I thought it would really encourage the people and I wanted him to be amongst us it was a over church or the other church on their own water hood I want to be among so he still sending greeting cards we still have a contact advisable a bunch of my videos but you know he never got back together I was trying to reach out but notice we don't go over on their grounds enjoy their services they gotta come on our grounds enjoy our services praise God unless you feel love the Lord for example Jesus went into people's houses right that were sinners but jesus never said hey so we got to be careful to go on the devil's grounds if we start sitting we're not like Jesus then we got to leave that place praise god is he had a pot remember Heat number we talked about that everything jesus did got short of a vision remember all the compilers showing me that's what the Sun does or without a vision I don't do it so Jesus all vision to go next sinners house witnessed them win them to Lord preach repentance and then whenever more and he did it but he never said he never compromised and that's the danger of a young pitcher like you officer Christians like us going into pool halls or dance halls or bars because that's dangerous we might be tempted to go back into some type of the city right you see that so we don't want to go on their brows when you call them over to our grounds all right I'm always done here what would over for temperance okay go over here all right now that did it only happened that they're to God Church of the Old Testament what happened the Church of New Testament where there was an emperor who like bailon needed help to secure his kingdom and that was Constantine member Constantine about all the Christians over to stop first recursion let's just let's just convert the temples of our pagan gods into Christian churches they just took down the name of Jupiter and put up all or bar to this right and the hit if you know that that's history but if you look up the constitute the emperor of Rome and Constantinople and all these things like that he married church and state together it's all history nothing we made up its history and that's what happened in this church age they marry churches they they compromise that well we also be United we also might just worship together that's not God's idea God's idea separation separate yourself from all sin and stay separate from all sin that I can bless you I'll Olivia all right okay yeah this is my last one let's send her feet thus that which started as a deed in the first age was made a literal doctrine and so it is today so we're now talking about the doctrine of the Nicolaitans first it was the D well it's just the tradition we do we let men rule and let them make their own rules and so for like that Bishop still claimed power to control men and deal with them as they desire placing them where they will so I'm sure where they so will the ministry this denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul Barnabas or the work where do I have called them this is anti word Antichrist so when the people decide with their own idea about who's to lead them they get in trouble right right now let's read that next 13 let's get your Bible to illustrate a 10x30 now that needs to be balanced out with brother Graham statements how the majority of the people is the voice is the Holy Spirit in a church vote right that needs to be balanced out there so as long as the church prays and see Scott before voting we can be assured that the Holy Ghost spoke praise God we can be sure because that's what happened in Acts chapter 13 in church this I believe just from my person s alone God called me away from Lima right and I just felt my heart to start a church in 2006 by the bang we all felt let him go to do it all the start of the church in 2006 and they voted me in his pastor but we felt a leading of the Lord to do it and God has vindicated by saving souls and accurate right saving souls we haven't a nominated we have some fellowship with everybody we're not isolating ourselves and say we're better than every best to church we need it we need every message church we need their fellowship right we need we either love and that's why it's going to visit your friends and Indiana it's going to visit the same saliva it's awesome to do that that's why we never cut it off we're one body praise God we're no better than anybody so so far I look at our ministry sa minds to know the Holy Spirit crazy stuff we're not into this denominational thing because God is separated me separated us I love as I say needs to get on the past we're gonna have a patch to have a church until until you get one okay now first chapter 13 verse 1 now other was it out right now there were in the church that was Antioch certain prophets and teachers which like that has some profits in the church maybe we got some will see as Barnabas and Simeon that were called nigeria niue seus of Cyrene and banana which have been brought up with the hair of the Tetrarch and saw as they minister to the Lord they and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work we're too i called them there he's got you see that brother remember we talked about that yesterday about shutting in the church sometime on the weekend then we talked about that so they shut in and they start praying and fasting seeking God and one of the rise up and say thus saith the Lord separate Paul Marcus I've got to work for them to do this is how every church should be lat right here I should pray that's why I got friends to God send the right ministers my weight put a minister on my heart and comment bless us with the word of the Lord that's what we try to do by the grace of the Lord brother Brandon never go dancin in nineteen sixty he would lay out all of his invitations and just prey on them they were just lay their heads afraid and the brothers the managers would take those out and make a schedule for praise God in 62 against the spot where says these invitations but we haven't made of yeah if you let it stop right here and record all these patients or food for that that's the come later you're going to need this food later on right the vision of the table with the meats and I want to meet slit the vegetables all these things turnips and everything like that which was his servants on tape praise God now look at verse 3 and when they had fasted and prayed they laid their hands on them and they set them away so they've been set forth by the Holy Ghost departed onto solution from dense they sailed to Cyprus now why am i reading app because brother Austin and just so you know but I was in different ones like bank and Wendy when God places us in a church we stayed here on to the Holy Ghost sentence away right we need to know God sending us away if not Satan is going to get us because we're own sheep leaving the production protection of the fold and I've seen it happen to boss you have a different churches people even you don't think it's letting the Lord and turns out they fall away and leave the Word of God and get the life a sitting all these things like that it's awful but did they really pray fast about it did they really seek God for the leadership of the Holy Spirit this is how God runs the church you see that by the Austin this is how he runs it here by the leadership of the Holy Ghost we must be led of the Lord we must pray before we do things we must fast you must seek God before we find the answer before we make great decisions how many other lower amen praise God we don't look I got this i forgot to this yeah i had one more the third church age program host we just did that was the doctrine of Balaam and the deeds and doctrine of the Nicolaitans is helpful you understand it's a little more teaching on that side but brother have said you have to see how the Antichrist here works the book of Revelation to know how to overcome this is so beautiful I never even had to stop before I can see how they been taught it all the way through the church age sermons and the church cake book itself so I thought you'd like that by the grace of the Lord and I'm like in a tune so next time we'll do a Thyatira i'll call the quotes Jezebel's teaching and doctrine and then we'll do Sardis then religion displeasing works to file their garments Philadelphia the scene through line church members and the age of probably love they would lie that's how you can recognize the age they would lie they wouldn't tell you the truth ah and then later SIA lukewarm and no morning of God well Jess I've gone as far as I know I don't say that Lord I've gone as far as I can go out to go deeper in the Lord Jesus Christ praise God okay but sister you could maybe change it back to their song whenever let's bow our heads here I know was a little teaching but I thought it would be real good and helpful tonight to see that in the book of Revelation this gives us authority and power over Satan that is for Emily father we thank you for this word tonight lord I believe it was true of your profit wrote their board and if we can see how the Antichrist fear works and as he said if we can discern the two spirits in the framework of the church and withstand the Antichrist spirit if we could withstand sin it is deception and then going into deeds and traditions and madden rulership and we will be an invincible army hallelujah I'll interview and that's why we're standing today I believe we're experiencing that we've been invincible Lord as a body for these years and will continue to be only by the grace of the lord jesus christ giving us the wisdom and the power to discern the Antichrist sphere or we love you we thank you for that dear god bless these thoughts to our hearts to your Lord father maybe we haven't be grateful for these teachings that your proper game us help me just to say or the profit Center not me just to eat this open book and then Lord bring it in inspired way to the people as it inspires me mainly brought to the people with the same inspiration to be able to withstand Antichrist spirit and please the Holy Spirit and see moving our lives we thank you Lord for the holy presence that you bring us today maybe worship you now praise you as we close Jesus Christ's name Amen Prisca others are you let's see scrutiny God Baal fresh home riddim oh I won't you I go hey let's meet the wrasslin off-screen the Living God and they do a little bit crazed guy I want to pressure going key for the week where you have your first love maybe then the Lord on the ball yes mom all right you know I me a bad at that picture barring the abandoned the Word of God hallelujah you know turkeys don't pay for he always does it again daddy just because he stopped making his love known to us and makes us keep fall in love with it more and more again a van praise God ebay let's see no song here let's see now are worthy not worthy it's where the phrase that I just for sure that you're in your own place or you worthy tonight thank you for showing us the book of Revelation but now that we would be lost
