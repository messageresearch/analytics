[0:00] brother Brandon I'm sorry in the series
[0:01] on this song The Coming of the lord The
[0:03] Rapture mystery I want to look at a
[0:05] we'll probably take a few services on
[0:07] this one kind of review some things and
[0:09] hopefully bring out some fresh thoughts
[0:11] here by the grace of God so we look at
[0:14] uh the coming of the lord The Rapture
[0:16] mystery that's how that second verse
[0:18] ends the coming of the lord The Rapture
[0:20] mystery now I see God in Simplicity
[0:22] that'll be the next one Lord willing and
[0:24] that final one will be the spoken words
[0:26] Original Seed that's a six-h hour sermon
[0:27] so that's going to be a long series
[0:30] but I'm just joking we'll hit the
[0:32] highlights by the grace of God that's a
[0:33] very memorable sermon U if you know
[0:36] anything about that with a pick up your
[0:38] pen and WR portion so uh let's go where
[0:40] brother Ram brother Ram started in 1
[0:42] Thessalonians 5 vers1 I think that's the
[0:44] same text I took on Sunday night at the
[0:45] Bible study we looked at the Antichrist
[0:48] on Sunday
[0:50] night 1 Thessalonians 5 vers1
[1:00] brother raam's text was uh verses 1-5
[1:03] and then he said just look across he
[1:05] said geographically across your Bible
[1:08] across the page and then he read the
[1:10] verses on the Rapture the shout voice
[1:12] and Trump so we'll do that tonight I'm
[1:14] going to try to just keep the sermon
[1:15] short I said I'm going to try so I'm
[1:17] going to try by God's grace we kind of
[1:19] see how the uh poll goes here by the
[1:23] grace of the
[1:24] Lord I'm turning there so thank you for
[1:26] your patience
[1:30] 1 Thessalonians
[1:35] 51 I'll read 1 through four and then we
[1:37] can read verse 5 together but of the
[1:39] times and of the seasons Brethren you
[1:40] have no need that I write unto you for
[1:43] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:45] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:48] night for when they shall say peace and
[1:51] safety now don't we need safety with all
[1:52] this news coming out my goodness hasn't
[1:55] it just been more magnified the days of
[1:57] Noah hasn't it been
[1:58] magnified then sudden destruction cometh
[2:01] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[2:05] child and they shall not Escape but ye
[2:09] Brethren are not in darkness that that
[2:12] day should overtake you as a thief I
[2:14] love how the bible promises us and
[2:16] Escape praise God I'm very thankful for
[2:19] that we know sudden destruction is
[2:21] coming but he said You shall Escape
[2:24] Hallelujah there's Escape Hallelujah now
[2:27] verse uh verse 5 let's read that on
[2:29] three 1 1 2 3 ye are all the children of
[2:32] light and the children of the day we are
[2:36] not of the night nor of Darkness praise
[2:40] God may God add His blessings to the
[2:42] Ring of his word you can be seated
[2:44] there I also love verse 9 verse 9 is one
[2:47] of the most beautiful uh uh scriptures
[2:50] about the Rapture in fact if I'm not
[2:52] mistaken uh there's a pastor I know I
[2:54] listened to his sermons he quotes verse
[2:57] 9 every night before he goes to bed uh
[3:00] because he wants to be reminded of God's
[3:01] grace for God hath not appointed us unto
[3:04] wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[3:07] Lord Jesus Christ what a great scripture
[3:09] to quote before you close your eyes
[3:10] right God doesn't have wrath for me God
[3:13] has Mercy For Me amen hallelujah how
[3:15] many believe that by God's grace all
[3:17] because him all because God called you
[3:20] to grace you didn't earn Grace Jesus
[3:23] said you didn't you didn't go looking
[3:24] for me I came looking for you it's all
[3:27] by God's grace Hallelujah God's amazing
[3:30] Grace and we just got to let God have
[3:31] more uh uh have more uh I'd say
[3:34] leadership in our lives or have have
[3:36] more uh Authority in our lives uh we
[3:39] want to give God his way Hallelujah we
[3:41] want to give God the preeminence in our
[3:42] lives I'm looking for the right word
[3:44] there now uh on the same page in chapter
[3:47] 4 brother Ram then read verses 14 to or
[3:50] I'm sorry verses 16 to 18 and I guess I
[3:53] need to say this I'm preaching uh from
[3:55] the sermon the sudden secret uh going
[3:58] away of the of the church brother man
[4:01] preaches in
[4:03] 1958 because uh as you may or may not
[4:06] know I would probably guess you don't
[4:07] know uh because if you haven't done this
[4:09] study yourself and I'm not saying that
[4:10] to make you feel bad but if you just
[4:12] haven't done this study there is no
[4:14] sermon called the coming of the lord The
[4:16] Rapture mystery I looked okay uh we have
[4:20] uh 1 two 3 4 five six seven eight
[4:23] sermons with the word coming in it and
[4:26] none of them are that specific title
[4:29] okay uh but then there there are sermons
[4:31] like the great coming revival the the
[4:33] second coming the second coming of the
[4:34] Lord living dying buried Rising coming
[4:37] he preached that twice the oncoming
[4:39] storm the signs of his coming and the
[4:42] flashing red light of the sign of his
[4:44] coming right so in the song You Know The
[4:48] it's it's strange in that song they
[4:49] listed nine sermons well this one isn't
[4:51] the exact name of the title of the
[4:54] sermon okay so I'm just going to pull
[4:56] I'll just preach a few sermons on the
[4:57] Rapture that I think are the CL closest
[5:00] right okay so that's what I'm going to
[5:02] do now there also is no sermon called
[5:04] The Rapture mystery but there is a
[5:05] sermon called The Rapture from December
[5:09] 1965 there's only one sermon with the
[5:11] word mystery in it and that's Christ is
[5:13] the mystery of God revealed right from
[5:16] 1963 so whoever wrote this song You Know
[5:18] Kudos on writing the song but you know
[5:20] you got one title that's a little off
[5:22] you know it's not the exact uh title of
[5:25] a sermon just thought you'd be
[5:27] interested in that so uh we're on the
[5:29] six sermon I'm sorry there's eight
[5:30] sermons in this song we're on the sixth
[5:32] one we preached on the recognizing your
[5:34] Dan's message we preach on serpent seed
[5:37] we preached perfect Faith uh we preach
[5:39] the breach and we just preach the
[5:41] message of Grace eight sermons on the
[5:42] message of Grace how many enjoyed the
[5:43] message of Grace what a what a
[5:45] phenomenal series that was by the Holy
[5:47] Spirit praise God uh just thankful to
[5:49] the Lord for his mercy and the grace of
[5:51] God
[5:53] hallelujah so again there's no sermon
[5:55] that says the the the coming of the lord
[5:57] The Rapture mystery so this is the one I
[5:59] thought I would uh preach is from 1958
[6:01] the sudden secret going away of the
[6:04] church um and uh again he ended this one
[6:07] with a story like he did the message of
[6:09] Grace brother ended the message of the
[6:11] grace with that story of the King's son
[6:13] who was killed with a spear right and
[6:16] then they found the man who did it he
[6:18] was in
[6:19] prison um and then the king wanted to
[6:21] have mercy on him and because the man
[6:22] asked for Mercy remember the
[6:25] story he he went the king went and
[6:29] destroyed all the records and made this
[6:31] murderer his son and put his son's
[6:34] clothes on him and his ring on him and
[6:36] made him his own son that's that's our
[6:39] story
[6:41] Hallelujah for all have fallen short of
[6:43] the glory of God Amen there's none that
[6:46] seeketh God no not one Hallelujah I've
[6:49] never heard a preacher use that story
[6:50] before William have
[6:51] you there's another witness there see
[6:54] people like they like all these stories
[6:56] where it seems like well we didn't do
[6:57] we're that pure woman who never sinned
[6:59] right that's true in one way that's true
[7:02] in the soul amen but in the flesh and
[7:05] the mind we sin
[7:06] daily and we're we're unworthy in in our
[7:10] in our flesh and our in our minds praise
[7:11] God but that's why I love that story
[7:14] because it proves we're all guilty but
[7:16] God showed us Amazing Grace amen God had
[7:19] pity on us as a father pth his son so
[7:23] the Lord pth his children praise God
[7:26] thank God for pity amen hallelujah God
[7:28] showed pity on us amen
[7:30] so uh he ends this one uh with a story
[7:33] as well I'm going to set a timer uh so
[7:35] I'm going to set for 45
[7:37] minutes Hallelujah now I'm going to read
[7:39] brother am's opening prayer to this
[7:41] sermon again 1958 the sudden Seeker
[7:43] going away the church let us bow our
[7:45] heads in a moment for prayer Lord we
[7:47] like we say like those of old I was
[7:50] happy when they said unto me let us go
[7:51] to the house of Lord we can find no
[7:54] better place to be today than to be
[7:56] right here with the congregation of the
[7:58] Lord in worship can you find a better
[8:00] place to be would you rather be uh on a
[8:03] Wednesday night would you rather be down
[8:04] at the Applebees today where' you rather
[8:07] be the best place you could be is in the
[8:09] house of
[8:11] God though it may be raining outside now
[8:14] we got nice weather and there may be
[8:16] miseries and things but when we're in
[8:18] thy presence we have this smile of
[8:22] satisfaction that we know that you
[8:25] understand and are working everything
[8:27] just right for us amen
[8:30] he keeps praying we would ask this
[8:32] special blessing this morning on those
[8:34] who were unable to get through the
[8:35] service so I have to pray for those who
[8:37] are working tonight right brother Amen
[8:39] brother Vang probably brother Jose
[8:41] sister C is probably watching the kids
[8:43] tonight you know he says many perhaps
[8:47] would have come if the weather had not
[8:48] been so bad or they didn't have work but
[8:51] may they find consolation in reading
[8:53] your word and listening to ministers on
[8:57] the radio oh we've got one of those
[8:59] right it's called the internet
[9:01] now and programs that are designed for
[9:05] those people so look even Brother's Day
[9:07] those were the programs designed for the
[9:09] people that couldn't come to church
[9:10] radio read your Bible internet read your
[9:13] Bible and the church
[9:15] said that's what they're designed for
[9:17] that's why they're out there Hallelujah
[9:20] we would ask that you would especially
[9:22] bless those who who are in divine
[9:24] presence that are
[9:25] here for their effort coming forth this
[9:28] morning this evening to hear the word of
[9:30] the Lord and to minister to him in
[9:31] Psalms and in prayer and in Thanksgiving
[9:34] Hallelujah so brother mam said
[9:37] especially bless those who came to
[9:38] church right Hallelujah and we ask God
[9:41] that you will touch the bodies of those
[9:43] who are sick and needy and who are just
[9:45] waiting just now has come a long
[9:47] distance to be prayed for I'm sorry I
[9:50] made a note on my phone I want to pull
[9:51] it up real quick there it is
[9:53] okay yeah just made a note I just took a
[9:55] picture of it so I didn't have to scribe
[9:57] it all out again
[9:59] he says uh they've come a distance to be
[10:02] prayed for and we ask that you would
[10:03] just look upon us and speak to us that
[10:06] we who are here this morning should take
[10:08] inventory of our own situation and say
[10:10] search me said one of the prophets and
[10:13] try me and see if there be any evil in
[10:16] me now that's quite a
[10:18] prayer right to say God if there's any
[10:22] evil in me Purge it out of me amen right
[10:25] it's quite a prayer and then Lord in
[10:27] your searching if you find that there's
[10:29] evil in US Purge us Lord as we humbly
[10:32] confess our sins and our evil
[10:35] doings and he closed The Prayer by
[10:37] saying this and we ask that you remember
[10:39] us as we I'm sorry as you look at Jesus
[10:43] so he's praying to the father and he's
[10:44] saying look at us as you look at Jesus
[10:47] amen who died to be a pritu that means
[10:50] the wratht taker for our sins and our
[10:53] iniquity as we confess that we believe
[10:56] that he died for this purpose and rose
[10:58] again that we'd have the grand privilege
[11:01] of doing this this morning Grant it Lord
[11:03] and speak to us through thy written word
[11:06] as we wait further to hear from you in
[11:08] the name of Jesus we pray amen so that
[11:11] was brother Ram's opening prayer now
[11:13] friends tonight I'm not going to get to
[11:15] the mysterious part of the Rapture in
[11:16] this sermon I imagine I'll get it to in
[11:18] part two or part three now the fun part
[11:21] which I'm excited to preach now fun I
[11:23] should say fun the exciting part I'm
[11:25] excited to preach is the part where I
[11:27] told you this summer that
[11:29] Tucker Carlson did an interview with a
[11:31] country singer who was a worldly country
[11:34] singer or now he's a Christian country
[11:35] singer if that's a thing I mean might be
[11:38] and uh and he went on there and he told
[11:40] Tucker there's no such thing as a
[11:42] pre-tribulation Rapture so I'm excited
[11:45] to I I'll probably show you the I don't
[11:47] think I'll show you the videos in here
[11:48] but I'll show you the the screenshots of
[11:50] it and I'm excited to preach on that and
[11:52] you know what he attacked brother
[11:53] William he attacked the Scofield bible
[11:55] my my Bible I took it personal
[11:59] do you know church this is the Bible
[12:01] that brother Ram had when the angel of
[12:03] the Lord met him in
[12:05] 1946 he said I'm taking nothing in there
[12:07] he told he told ma he said honey if if I
[12:09] never come back he said if God don't
[12:11] answer me you're going to be a widow I'm
[12:12] going to die waiting in that cave until
[12:14] God answers me why I'm seeing these
[12:16] Visions what's happening my preachers
[12:17] are telling me it's the devil but I
[12:19] don't understand it it looks like God's
[12:20] doing doing something I'm going to die
[12:23] I'll die in there trying waiting on God
[12:25] to answer that's what he told his wife
[12:27] and the only thing he took in there was
[12:29] this Scofield
[12:30] bible Hallelujah a prophet of God Amen
[12:34] and God answered that Prophet am glory
[12:36] to God Amen now Scofield wasn't perfect
[12:39] he's a trinitarian as you know but he
[12:40] had a lot of things right and for me
[12:44] personally I love him because he had
[12:45] those 11 New Testament Mysteries but I
[12:46] found another I found
[12:48] 12 so Scofield means a lot to me brother
[12:51] William it's his inspiration brother R
[12:54] preached serves this the end time and
[12:56] then in that sermon I saw oh there's
[12:58] only 12 called mysteries in the entire
[13:01] Bible and brother R come to finish the
[13:04] mystery of God hallelujah so to me this
[13:08] Bible means a lot to me and I'll
[13:09] eventually get to that uh scoffield part
[13:11] maybe Sunday uh maybe next Wednesday by
[13:14] God's grace we'll see how the Lord leads
[13:16] and of course we'll get to the shout
[13:17] voice Trump that's kind of the mystery
[13:19] behind the Rapture other than the timing
[13:22] of the Rapture all right now what's
[13:25] interesting now look how humble brother
[13:26] Ram is when he preaches this and this if
[13:28] you receive this this will help you
[13:30] appreciate a preacher who maybe uh
[13:32] didn't have enough time to study the
[13:34] night
[13:35] before look what brother Ram says he
[13:37] says I want to take a text for this
[13:39] morning the sudden secret going away of
[13:41] the church let me announce it again
[13:43] because I haven't had very much time to
[13:45] premeditate on any
[13:48] comments but just
[13:51] Hing this is what I love about brother
[13:52] BR he's so
[13:54] honest he said I hurried to get the
[13:57] sermon ready and I hurried into service
[13:59] this morning well why brother bradam
[14:02] let's find
[14:03] out he said we were out late yesterday
[14:06] and never got in last night till real
[14:09] late so he was out with his family doing
[14:12] something and rushing down here this
[14:14] morning and church I've been to I drove
[14:17] by his house it's only like a it's not
[14:19] even a mile from the church but he's got
[14:22] a rush down there to church you been
[14:24] there probably don't remember but you
[14:26] know we W remember all the details but
[14:30] he but this just came to my mind so I
[14:32] didn't get a chance to study last night
[14:33] necessarily I just rushed in here I
[14:35] heard in here and I just wrote down some
[14:37] thoughts he said but just maybe later I
[14:40] might catch something that would do
[14:41] someone some good and I love this
[14:44] subject the sudden secret catching away
[14:46] the
[14:48] church so this is how he starts the
[14:50] sermon what a way to start the sermon it
[14:53] wasn't I prayed and fasted all day and I
[14:55] I studied all week at the library like
[14:57] he did for Daniel 70 weeks he studied at
[14:58] the library all week for those sermons
[15:01] all
[15:01] week he said he shut in uh for a whole
[15:04] week before he preached the uh uh the
[15:06] seven Church ages and then he did shut
[15:09] in for nine straight days for the Seven
[15:11] Seals but this one he just says I had to
[15:13] rush in I was out late didn't get a lot
[15:15] of chance uh to study and premeditate so
[15:19] I like how brother random is so honest
[15:21] Hallelujah and lets me know even a
[15:23] prophet Glory even a prophet don't his
[15:25] time schedule doesn't always work out
[15:27] perfectly but what does he do does he
[15:29] Sher the duty and say well somebody else
[15:30] better preach no if it's his calling if
[15:33] it's his time the Bible said God will
[15:34] help you in season and out of season
[15:37] amen ought to be encouragement to you
[15:39] well I didn't have enough time to fast
[15:40] and pray last night well that's okay you
[15:43] can still pray for the sick just pray
[15:45] with a sincere heart you won't always
[15:48] have uh all the time you want to do
[15:51] something right you won't always do now
[15:53] always try your best always try your
[15:55] best to give time to reading prayer uh
[15:57] but but but don't uh but don't don't
[16:00] neglect your duty don't neglect if God's
[16:02] called you to pray for somebody or
[16:03] witness somebody don't don't neglect
[16:05] that just because you're in a hurry or
[16:07] is a busy time of life Hallelujah that's
[16:11] why Paul said be instant in season out
[16:13] of season how many times have I come
[16:15] here not a lot of time to study now
[16:17] today I had a lot of time I studied all
[16:18] week and had over an hour and a half to
[16:20] study so it's been a good study by God's
[16:22] grace I've enjoyed it amen I'm looking
[16:23] forward to preaching amen I'm not
[16:25] rushing in here know some nights I do
[16:27] some especially on Wednesdays uh but not
[16:29] not not recently I've had a lot of time
[16:31] of course the summer took plenty of time
[16:33] to study and preach and pray all these
[16:35] good things but just showing the balance
[16:38] hallelujah it's a good thing now brother
[16:41] R goes to the next thought the next
[16:42] thought is about the sick that are in
[16:43] the church he says uh this is an unusual
[16:48] thing to speak a subject like this when
[16:50] I come down to minister to the sick so
[16:52] it's supposed to be a prayer for the
[16:53] sick service he said but there's a
[16:55] greater sickness Than Physical
[16:57] sickness so he's going to pray for the
[16:59] sick but he's going to preach on the
[17:00] Rapture because he wants them to be well
[17:03] spiritually before he prays to make them
[17:05] well physically
[17:07] amen
[17:08] hallelujah and it's much more essential
[17:12] that we be well for this great event
[17:15] that just fixing to take place if if it
[17:17] was just fixing to take place in 1958
[17:20] what about today praise God he thought
[17:23] it was just fixing to take place
[17:26] Hallelujah
[17:30] and look what he look what he'll say
[17:32] here that it would be even to be asleep
[17:34] in the Lord or dead as we would know it
[17:37] it's better to be ready I'd rather be a
[17:39] sick man ready with the Lord than be a
[17:43] well man not ready to go with the
[17:45] Lord see Church no matter where we find
[17:47] ourselves you know lyi Mal they're
[17:49] listening let's get make sure you're
[17:50] right with the Lord while you're sick
[17:53] okay everybody should realize that
[17:55] whether you're whe whether you're sick
[17:57] or well make sure your soul is right
[17:59] with Christ
[18:02] Hallelujah if you're backsliding with a
[18:04] major sin by God's grace get right
[18:06] Hallelujah as we preach on Sunday if
[18:08] you're backl in a major way get your
[18:10] thoughts right Hallelujah get your get
[18:12] your thinking right get your anointings
[18:14] back Hallelujah get the spirit of God
[18:16] back on you amen am Hallelujah don't
[18:19] walk in Disobedience don't turn and go
[18:21] the other way in your thoughts keep your
[18:23] thoughts on the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[18:25] the sweetest Fellowship you'll have all
[18:26] day
[18:27] Hallelujah so think about
[18:31] God that's right he says but however it
[18:35] may be God is so willing that we will
[18:38] both be ready and well soul and body so
[18:43] brother God's willing we want to be
[18:45] healed physically and be ready
[18:47] spiritually and then he quotes the
[18:49] scripture uh Psalm 103 for he forgives
[18:52] all of our iniquities and all our diseas
[18:54] and heals all our diseases he died for a
[18:57] compound purpose amen I've always been
[19:00] blessed by that brother maybe brother
[19:01] William can help me later on but I think
[19:03] it's in Mark chapter 8 how Mark quotes
[19:07] Isaiah 53:4 can you pull that
[19:10] up Jesus was healing the multitudes he
[19:13] was doing Miracles he was multiplying
[19:15] bread and fish uh he was casting out
[19:18] devils and and and and Mark says Jesus
[19:22] did all this in fulfillment of Isaiah
[19:27] 534 surely he hath borne our griefs so
[19:31] even before Jesus died they were
[19:34] beneficiaries of his future crucifixion
[19:37] that's right right before the sacrifice
[19:40] was even made they were already drawing
[19:42] dividends on God's promise
[19:45] amen that I don't understand that but
[19:48] it's true praise God they're already
[19:51] drawing Ben benefits on a promise that
[19:54] actually hadn't been uh carried out in
[19:55] the literal sense
[19:59] getting benefits of a future
[20:01] promise I feel like that's where we're
[20:03] getting we got the Holy Ghost we got the
[20:06] down payment amen we're drawing benefits
[20:08] on the body change the adoption to it
[20:11] the EMP the Redemption of the body
[20:13] praise God we're already drawing benefit
[20:15] brother say when you get healed
[20:16] physically that's a sign that you'll be
[20:18] in the Rapture that's right because your
[20:20] body's already experienced the down
[20:22] payment of what you got in your soul
[20:24] praise God your body gets healed because
[20:27] you're already going to get a body
[20:28] changeed
[20:29] amen Oh Glory I love it
[20:32] amen by he says he's already bore your
[20:35] Greece and carried our sorrows so those
[20:37] are your mental mind battles right there
[20:38] the
[20:40] Sorrows he's already carried your mind
[20:43] battles far away your backslidings right
[20:48] and yet we did esteem him stricken
[20:50] smitten of God and
[20:51] Afflicted and one of those words is
[20:53] either that one that one means both
[20:55] physical and mental pain and stress I
[20:58] don't I don't have the notes in front of
[20:59] me I'm kind of just shooting off the hip
[21:01] I'd say like that you know just going
[21:02] from memory because I just read it this
[21:03] week I was like oh my goodness that's
[21:05] right they were drawing benefits on a
[21:07] promise that actually hadn't been
[21:09] purchased yet you know by the sacrifice
[21:11] of Jesus
[21:12] Christ right just like you know like I
[21:14] told you God can do whatever he wants
[21:16] Enoch was raptured before Jesus you know
[21:19] 4,000 years before
[21:21] Jesus you can be raptured under the
[21:23] blood of bulls and
[21:25] goats see because the sacrifice doesn't
[21:27] limit God's power God can do whatever he
[21:30] wants praise God God can still forgive
[21:32] him with the blood of bulls and goats
[21:34] and God could show a Rapture because you
[21:36] can't stop God's plan
[21:38] amen it's impossible pra God can do
[21:40] whatever he wants amen and if Enoch was
[21:42] raptured on the blood of bus and gos
[21:44] then let us believe he's going to
[21:45] Rapture us under the blood of his son
[21:47] Jesus Christ the Holy Blood of the Son
[21:49] of God the Messiah
[21:51] hallelujah oh gives us a good a good
[21:54] consolation doesn't it brother William
[21:56] we got a good I'm just going to call you
[21:57] lot tonight okay brother
[21:59] brother Austin doesn't make you feel
[22:00] good brother I don't want you to shout
[22:02] too loud of a sleeping little child
[22:03] there though I mean sometimes they sleep
[22:05] through it you know I've had plenty of
[22:07] things plenty of time that happened to
[22:08] me now he goes on to the next thought he
[22:11] says now now he's starts breaking into
[22:13] the Rapture so he talks about you know
[22:15] uh that first how he's busy then he
[22:17] talks about um making sure your body's
[22:20] your Soul's right first even if your
[22:21] body's sick and then he breaks into how
[22:24] people their attitudes their bad
[22:26] attitudes towards the Rapture he said
[22:28] says when I was thinking on today on
[22:29] this subject people live today as though
[22:32] just before the coming of the Lord Jesus
[22:34] if he was going to send a host of angels
[22:36] down to all the newspapers or us uh
[22:39] social media accounts right
[22:43] x uh if he's going to send a host of
[22:46] angels down to all the newspapers or
[22:48] social media accounts for today and for
[22:50] a year or so announc it throughout all
[22:51] the world in the newspaper that on such
[22:53] and such a date Jesus will arrive
[22:56] brother R said that's how most people
[22:58] think think they're going to get a
[23:00] warning in every newspaper or on every
[23:01] social media right post better get ready
[23:04] for the Rapture better better get better
[23:06] get ready for the
[23:07] Rapture and he thinks they'll they think
[23:10] they'll have to broadcast it by the
[23:12] radio and put it on the televisions and
[23:14] everywhere just the day and just the
[23:17] hour that he was coming that's the way
[23:19] people live today isn't that right they
[23:23] people will live in sin because they
[23:25] think well I'll hear about the Rapture
[23:27] before it comes and then I can conf rest
[23:28] my sin and get ready to go in the
[23:30] Rapture no that's not how it works and
[23:33] the church
[23:34] said you can't live in sin and expect to
[23:37] go meet the sinless one you ain't going
[23:40] to go meet the sinless one unless you're
[23:41] trying to live sinless I said trying
[23:44] Hallelujah that's right you got to try
[23:47] you got to cast down everything that
[23:48] exalts itself against the word of God
[23:50] you got to try you got to try to live
[23:53] holy praise God God sees your efforts
[23:55] remember Peter twice said all diligence

[39:08] uses he says you know when he seen that
[39:10] God was going to have a righteous church
[39:12] and the things he was going to do the
[39:13] enemy used the same strategy he's got a
[39:15] church so Satan has a church and he's
[39:18] got a people that's very religious
[39:19] aren't they how many know a good
[39:22] Catholic that's very religious right a

[39:32] religious he says and they're just right
[39:34] on the toe as religious people because
[39:36] he knows that Christ Church is the same
[39:40] way but remember church I'll say like
[39:43] this they're ever learning but never
[39:45] able to come to the truth what is the

[40:05] knowledge about stories and history and

[40:08] but they don't get the truth thank God
[40:10] for the truth we've got the truth amen I

[40:51] in a moment twink of an
[40:53] eye right he says
[40:57] got Satan has his own church now brother
[40:59] R breaks into the story he spends about
[41:01] five or 10 minutes on this story how
[41:02] many know about Pearl
[41:04] Harbor 1941 December 7th a day that will
[41:09] live in
[41:10] infamy it's the day where the United
[41:12] States was attacked by
[41:14] Japan it started started uh the United
[41:18] States getting into the War World War II
[41:20] and then World War II but what I read
[41:23] was 35 to 65 million people died
[41:28] just in that war
[41:29] alone now brother R breaks into the
[41:32] story because he's talking about the
[41:33] sudden secret coming of the Lord and He
[41:36] brother Ram wants us to be
[41:40] ready brother raham uses this he says I
[41:42] was just reading on the sudden attack of
[41:45] Pearl
[41:46] Harbor that wasn't no exactly unknown
[41:49] attack how many know that there was
[41:52] numerous warnings even months in advance
[41:54] that the Japanese were planning a
[41:56] surprise attack
[41:57] now they did some of them I read one
[41:59] where they did send some of the ships
[42:00] out to sea just in case there would be
[42:03] attack but other than that there wasn't
[42:05] much
[42:06] done they they thought oh it's not
[42:08] really possible it's not likely they're
[42:11] going to attack
[42:12] us another problem was they had to
[42:14] translate some of the the codes they got
[42:17] the the Japanese codes but they didn't
[42:19] took them so long to translate them my
[42:22] goodness you know I I don't you don't
[42:25] don't you think church if they had have
[42:26] been praying
[42:27] if they had been seeking God don't you
[42:29] think God would have helped them to know
[42:30] unknown
[42:31] tongues don't you think God could have
[42:33] gave him interpretation God God knows
[42:35] all
[42:36] languages the article brother R said I'm
[42:39] sorry the article brother R read it said
[42:41] that most of those people most of the
[42:43] soldiers were on leave to go out to
[42:45] parties and party on a Saturday
[42:48] night and they had had numerous warnings
[42:51] you know just Japanese are coming all
[42:54] this information there's a surprise
[42:55] attack coming sometime
[42:58] and brother Braham read a story and the
[43:00] captains let most of the men go out now
[43:03] there are many still on the ships right
[43:05] especially if you know about the USS
[43:07] Arizona Lord have
[43:09] mercy but you know there was there was a
[43:11] lot of people still on duty and on
[43:13] station but a lot of them just went out
[43:15] to party the night
[43:18] before brother said there was threats
[43:20] from uh the Japanese in the water and in
[43:22] the
[43:24] air and there was a time for they were
[43:26] exactly in line for the invasion but
[43:28] they ignored it on the
[43:31] whole brother said that's the way it is
[43:34] today with the church the church is in
[43:37] line for judgment now not the
[43:39] bride but they're ignoring the coming of
[43:41] the Lord so that you can't so he says so
[43:44] that you can't blame him no one's going
[43:47] to blame God because God's sending
[43:48] warning he's sending preacher after
[43:50] preacher Allelujah or sermon after
[43:52] sermon right all even these signs with
[43:54] Israel and and Hamas these are all war
[43:58] right the devil is trying to attack
[44:01] God's people you can see it
[44:04] plainly said you can't blame them now
[44:07] brother said he read one story where uh
[44:10] they were in a Tavern or a
[44:13] bar this is the story he reads he said a
[44:15] man went down and uh a soldier sat down
[44:18] he's off duty and the bartender said hey
[44:20] do you hear the rumor he said no I don't
[44:22] believe I did he said uh there's
[44:23] something about a Japanese Fleet coming
[44:25] this way then he said young beautiful
[44:27] girl silly girl bounces up and sticks
[44:30] her foot up on the bar so can you
[44:31] imagine she's got a skirt on you
[44:34] imagine she's showing off
[44:36] her nudity yes that's right yes and she
[44:40] said oh you gloomy headed warts don't
[44:42] you know that we're here for to have a
[44:44] good time and not not talk about
[44:47] war he said isn't that just the way the
[44:49] world's saying today about the coming of
[44:51] the Lord you old-fashioned fogy back
[44:53] numbers what makes you dress and act the
[44:55] way you do

[52:02] Hallelujah where am I trying to get to
[52:04] oh here's what I want
[52:05] say
[52:07] 755 was the first wave there was
[52:10] actually two waves of attack from the
[52:12] Japanese they sent out the second wave
[52:14] one hour
[52:17] later it began on a Sunday morning when
[52:19] they should have been at church but you
[52:21] know most of those guys were not a
[52:22] church most of those women were not a
[52:25] church 300 153 Japanese
[52:28] planes led to the destruction of I'm
[52:31] sorry the death of over
[52:34] 2,44
[52:35] people in one Sunday morning what a
[52:38] rebuke on the nation there's my okay oh
[52:41] yeah I'm almost done I'll close probably
[52:43] after this story
[52:44] here now the US was able to recover a
[52:46] little bit they only shot down 29 of
[52:48] those 353
[52:50] planes now what's sad is
[52:53] 1,177 of them were all aboard the
[52:55] Arizona of the USS Arizona and that over
[52:58] a thousand people died in one vessel one
[53:01] ship so almost half of those people were
[53:04] people were men and soldiers that were
[53:06] drowned or uh exploded on the USS
[53:11] Arizona 68 civilians there in Pearl
[53:16] Harbor were killed because of these uh
[53:20] attacks and like I said just as soon as
[53:23] uh the the first attack stopped the
[53:25] second wave came
[53:28] all because they didn't heed the warning
[53:31] all because they weren't praying and
[53:33] looking at the signs they weren't
[53:35] watching and praying and the church said
[53:39] you know the same thing happened kind of
[53:40] on September 11th 2001 I remember that I
[53:42] was in class and on my way back I
[53:44] remember there was something I forget
[53:46] what was happened at had a 7:45 class I
[53:48] always had 7:45
[53:50] classes and it was only like a 50-minute
[53:52] class I was on my way back and when I
[53:55] got to the house the guys are like Jess
[53:56] sit down yeah I heard like fire sirens
[53:57] going off on the W walk home I'm like
[53:59] what's going on this kind of weird you
[54:00] know and as soon as I got in the house
[54:02] the the other guys's like sit down look
[54:03] at this on the
[54:05] TV the first plane hit the uh North
[54:08] Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46
[54:11] a.m. 17 minutes later the second plane
[54:14] struck the South Tower
[54:17] 2,750 people died in New York City there
[54:19] was a message person well I'm sorry he
[54:21] was a sinner he was working there he
[54:23] backed from the message church after he
[54:25] saw that he came back to the message and
[54:28] he saw he said it was a conspiracy
[54:30] theory I'll just say it like that it was
[54:33] set
[54:34] up and that brought him back it also uh
[54:37] helped him to uh his girlfriend helped
[54:40] them to make up and get married now they
[54:41] have a happy family because he was
[54:43] living in
[54:45] fornication 2,750 people so more di more
[54:49] people died at World Trade Center now
[54:51] that seems wrong but that this is what I
[54:53] got off of Britannica so I don't know if
[54:54] britannica's wrong forgive me
[54:57] 184 people died at the Pentagon when the
[54:59] Pentagon was struck and then 40 people
[55:02] died in Pennsylvania out in the field
[55:03] where that third plane
[55:06] landed church this is what happens when
[55:10] people don't take heed to
[55:12] warnings right now nobody's perfect I'm
[55:15] not putting any shame on anybody I'm
[55:17] just making a point brother Ram draws
[55:18] this as a
[55:19] lesson this is how the enemy is going to
[55:21] try to attack a surprise attack but
[55:24] nothing's a surprise for God
[55:29] am and the thing to do Church Our Lives
[55:32] is say God strengthen me strengthen me
[55:35] so when the next trial comes the next
[55:37] snare comes I'll be ready to overcome
[55:39] I'll be ready for it
[55:41] amen right and I found that with all of
[55:43] our trials in our life it seemed like
[55:45] God beforehand would always give me a
[55:46] scripture to warn me if I just pay
[55:48] attention if I if I just pay attention
[55:52] like Simon text me on a Monday he said
[55:54] just he said uh the devil's just
[55:56] threaten us threaten us within a week
[55:57] I'd got threatened with money
[56:00] things like I I forgot that's right
[56:02] Simon warned me I had you know I said
[56:04] amen to it but I didn't really pray
[56:06] about
[56:07] it if only I would have prayed a little
[56:09] more praise God but the point is God
[56:11] gives us
[56:12] warnings but preach a sermon God always
[56:15] sends warning before
[56:19] judgment brother Ram said if you won't
[56:21] heed to warning there's only one thing
[56:24] left that's judgment if there ever was a
[56:27] time this America was ever at its lowest
[56:29] e it's right now now think about what it
[56:31] is now all these years later goodness
[56:34] gracious he
[56:36] says it's indifference toward the gospel
[56:39] the gospel's been preached from Shore to
[56:40] Shore signs and wonders have been
[56:42] performed great Miracles have been done
[56:44] they continually go in there revry
[56:45] drinking ignoring making fun of
[56:50] Christianity brother Braham said out of
[56:51] the 200,000 pulpits in America I'm sure
[56:54] we have a lot less than that now all
[56:55] these churches is closing what we need
[56:58] today is those pulpits is prophets of
[57:00] the Lord who's not afraid to blast out
[57:03] God's Thunderbolts of judgment upon this
[57:05] generation of sinful people that we're
[57:08] preaching to amen what do we need we
[57:11] need people preaching the judgments of
[57:13] God this is what God's going to do get
[57:15] ready get ready to escape Hallelujah you
[57:18] can escape Hallelujah if you're willing
[57:21] to get ready praise God Amen that's what
[57:24] brother R says we need Thunderbolt BS
[57:26] preaching God's Thunderbolts I love it
[57:28] when The Thunder Rolls while I'm
[57:29] preaching amen not here tonight yet but
[57:32] I love when that happens he says we need
[57:34] Thunderbolts to give out the warnings
[57:36] like Isaiah Isaiah said a wicked
[57:39] generation oh how he did condemn that
[57:42] generation and tell them the oncoming
[57:45] judgments he said but too many of our
[57:47] ministers are afraid to say these things
[57:50] I'm not I've always preached the Rapture
[57:53] is going to rescue us from the awful
[57:54] tribulation period now it's not going to
[57:57] get awful really to the second
[57:59] half right because the first half they
[58:01] can't lay down the mark during the first
[58:02] half because the 144,000 got to be alive
[58:04] to get the Holy Ghost and you know the
[58:07] 144,000 won't take no mark of the beast
[58:09] and go to hell because they're going to
[58:11] get the mark of God the Holy Ghost
[58:13] amen there's going to be pressure before
[58:15] the Rapture about this Mark but it's not
[58:17] going to be po it's not going to be uh
[58:19] actually uh pushed out to the people to
[58:21] the second
[58:22] half remember not one trumpet can blow
[58:25] till the the seal has been sealed in the
[58:27] foreheads of the 144,000 Hallelujah
[58:31] Revelation 7:3 people need to read their
[58:33] Bibles they say the trumpets have
[58:35] already sounded they need to read their
[58:36] Bible they're ignorant of the Bible they
[58:37] got to read the Bible amen I'm being a
[58:39] little harsh but you know I'm saying
[58:40] maybe it wake somebody up sometimes you
[58:42] need a good rebuke to wake you up how
[58:43] many can say Amen to that I need it too
[58:46] brother sometimes I need somebody to
[58:47] just whip rebuke me into my face or
[58:49] rebuke something you know get a good
[58:51] reminder
[58:54] Hallelujah he said they're scared to
[58:56] give a direct witness of warning for
[58:58] would mean some of their jobs I'm glad
[59:00] that if this church closes down I still
[59:01] got a job by God's grace another words
[59:04] I'm not afraid to preach you because oh
[59:05] I'm going to get less ties or I'm I'm
[59:07] not going to have money I got enough
[59:09] money to thank God I got enough money to
[59:10] feed my
[59:12] family I don't care if anybody come if
[59:14] you want to leave you want to come or go
[59:15] you can come or go whatever you want to
[59:16] do I'm here to preach God sent me to
[59:18] Aran praise God a preacher sent I didn't
[59:22] ask to come here God sent me here amen I
[59:25] didn't even know existed brother William
[59:27] they said akan wants to give you a full
[59:29] scholarship where's akan where's that
[59:31] what how do you pronounce that Acron
[59:34] what I didn't even know it was on the
[59:37] map amen like where is that place I
[59:40] didn't ask to come here God sent me here
[59:43] amen God sent you here hallelujah praise
[59:45] God he said but some of that would mean
[59:48] their jobs if they preached too hard
[59:50] they have to leave their pulpits he said
[59:52] perhaps take another stand at some other
[59:55] Church chur or something but it's just
[59:56] too bad we got those kind of people in
[59:58] our pulpits I'm glad we don't
[1:00:00] amen we need men like John Wesley of the
[1:00:03] early Reformation Martin Luther we need
[1:00:05] some people like Paul who's willing to
[1:00:07] give it all and to surrender their
[1:00:09] themselves even it means separation from
[1:00:10] this life as a witness of the true
[1:00:12] Gospel of Jesus Christ did you know John
[1:00:15] Wesley was kicked out of every church
[1:00:17] early in his ministry every church he
[1:00:20] had to go preach in the
[1:00:21] fields and then there was mobs that
[1:00:24] would come and try to beat him up and
[1:00:25] break up is he he got beat many times
[1:00:28] and he have to just you know run away
[1:00:29] and get away from the mobs beat him up
[1:00:31] and all he was preaching was you can
[1:00:33] leave live a Sanctified
[1:00:35] life you can actually live by the power
[1:00:37] of God you can live a clean life unto
[1:00:40] God and all these other guys are
[1:00:42] serpents and
[1:00:43] Vipers they're a brood of vipers well no
[1:00:46] wonder they kicked them out of their
[1:00:47] churches he's calling them serpent seed
[1:00:51] Hallelujah same thing happened to Martin
[1:00:52] Luther Martin Luther stood stood there
[1:00:54] and said he said the shall live by faith
[1:00:57] and I think it was the Council of vers
[1:00:59] if I'm not mistaken but the the the
[1:01:02] leader there of the church it might have
[1:01:03] been the Pope I don't remember but he
[1:01:05] condemned him and they were taking him
[1:01:07] out they were arresting him but then
[1:01:09] some of his supporters did a pretend
[1:01:12] kidnapped they broke in kidnapped him
[1:01:14] they dressed him up like a
[1:01:17] knight Hallelujah Soldier he's a real
[1:01:20] Soldier he's a pretend Soldier there but
[1:01:22] he's a true champion of the Gospel
[1:01:24] hallelujah amen and and during that time
[1:01:26] when he was under
[1:01:27] arrest when he wasn't on the night Duty
[1:01:30] or as a night he would go there and
[1:01:31] translate the Bible from Greek into
[1:01:33] German and that helped bring us a Bible
[1:01:37] too that's 1519 if I'm not mistaken we
[1:01:40] got the King James in
[1:01:41] 1611 God knows what he's doing church
[1:01:44] God if if God's got a job for you he's
[1:01:46] going to save you from arrest amen or
[1:01:49] like Paul he might use you when you're
[1:01:50] arrested to write the Bible or we won't
[1:01:52] write the Bible but you know God has the
[1:01:53] purpose for everything Hallelujah
[1:01:55] God is in control we saw that with
[1:01:57] Daniel Shadrach Meshach and Amo even in
[1:01:59] the midst of Babylon God's spirit was
[1:02:01] mightily with them why because God's not
[1:02:03] a respector of person if you call on God
[1:02:06] God will answer you
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:10] hallelujah and we know Paul's testimony
[1:02:13] of suffering Shipwrecked five times
[1:02:15] beaten three times 39 strip or 29
[1:02:19] Stripes was
[1:02:20] it 39 39 Stripes each time Hallelujah
[1:02:25] out in the sea many nights and days he
[1:02:27] would get robbed all the time Paul would
[1:02:30] get stuck up and robbed what do they
[1:02:32] call it now when you get uh
[1:02:35] robbed what is it
[1:02:37] called mugged yeah you get mugged or you
[1:02:40] know pulled up or stuck up what do they
[1:02:41] call I forget you get mugged Paul would
[1:02:44] get mugged all the time give me your
[1:02:45] money give me your money you mean God
[1:02:47] would let his Prophet get mugged
[1:02:50] yes you mean God would let his Prophet
[1:02:53] get whipped on the back and bleed and
[1:02:55] almost die and get stoned but God healed
[1:02:58] them from the Stone Church God does
[1:03:00] things that we're not always aware of
[1:03:02] sometimes we have to have confidence
[1:03:04] church as this Rapture ears or as we get
[1:03:05] closer to death whichever one it is we
[1:03:07] got to have confidence God's in every
[1:03:09] detail of Our Lives amen amen he and his
[1:03:12] grace is sufficient in our weakness
[1:03:15] Hallelujah he's letting things happen so
[1:03:18] we'll learn to trust in
[1:03:21] him if he could trust think about that
[1:03:23] 39 times brother if he could 39 times
[1:03:27] they ripped his skin off his back 1 2 3
[1:03:29] 4 and then that happened a couple times
[1:03:32] if he can trust Jesus in the midst of
[1:03:34] that why can't we trust God in the midst
[1:03:36] of our
[1:03:38] Trials of course we can Church let's
[1:03:40] just be more let's be more sincere
[1:03:42] praise
[1:03:48] God he says what he said today education
[1:03:51] and societies and little he says
[1:03:53] frenetico delicate things I don't know
[1:03:54] what fral means uh delicate things of
[1:03:57] societies in their own feelings has took
[1:03:59] the place of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:04:01] church see people don't want the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost they just want their feelings to
[1:04:04] feel good I tell you you'll feel really
[1:04:07] good if you get the Holy Ghost amen you
[1:04:09] get the right feelings amen hallelujah
[1:04:12] what we need today he says it a second
[1:04:14] time what do we need today he said what
[1:04:16] we need today is to cry out to America
[1:04:18] is a godsent god-filled men he didn't
[1:04:21] say man good glory there it is I'm going
[1:04:23] to go send that to Jeffersonville he
[1:04:25] said what do we we need God filled men
[1:04:27] because they say it's a one- man message
[1:04:29] I'm sorry we got quotes there's one man
[1:04:31] yeah there's one Prophet there's one
[1:04:32] messenger but then there's all the
[1:04:34] fivefold ministry under him he said we
[1:04:37] need god-filled men filled with the
[1:04:39] power of the Holy Ghost who's not afraid
[1:04:41] to cry out against that thing that's
[1:04:43] wrong and warn the people of the
[1:04:46] oncoming judgment let's
