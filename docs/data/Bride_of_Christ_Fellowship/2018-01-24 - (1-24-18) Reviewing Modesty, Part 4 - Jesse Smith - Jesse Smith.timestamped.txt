[4:06] a man will start with a little bit of
[4:09] prayer so I have a few prayer requests
[4:13] here tonight and we have a psalm special
[4:15] praise the Lord brother happy about that
[4:20] okay so I have two requests the first
[4:26] one is for brother John on Sunday he was
[4:30] limping a little bit and I told him I
[4:33] told him before we would pray for his
[4:35] hip it's still really bothering him you
[4:37] see him limping around and he and I were
[4:40] talking recently and just seems like if
[4:42] God doesn't intervene it's only gonna
[4:43] get worse and he's gonna need a total
[4:45] hip replacement so we really got to pray
[4:47] for our brother
[4:48] that God will do a miracle so let's pray
[4:50] that God will bring healing and do
[4:52] something supernatural by God's grace
[4:58] also Austin's mother Stephanie is kind
[5:03] of battling some sickness so she didn't
[5:06] ask for prayer but I said would you like
[5:07] us to pray for you and she said I'd like
[5:09] that
[5:10] so let's pray for her by the grace of
[5:15] Lord the other prayer request tonight

[41:35] [Music]
[42:25] [Applause]
[42:28] [Music]
[42:37] like to look at reviewing modesty again
[42:40] tonight I think this is part for the
[42:43] grace of Lord and I'd like to take a
[42:48] text here just a moment I think its
[42:50] first Peter 3 let's go to first Peter 3
[42:51] I think I'll take my text here I like to
[42:56] look at Christian liberties tonight
[42:57] there's three Bible defined Christian
[42:59] liberties and I want to look at jewelry
[43:02] again we covered that this summer but I
[43:05] think I just want to revisit excite read
[43:07] some more scriptures on it so I want to
[43:08] review that it's not on the mics no no
[43:13] but forgive me I thought it was on
[43:16] excuse me thank you
[43:20] so let's look to this here tonight first
[43:24] Peter chapter 3 verse 1 yeah I'm
[43:31] learning you know like I've been doing a
[43:32] lot of reading and learning about
[43:34] different things and trying to balance
[43:38] it all by God's grace so trying to
[43:40] rightly divide the word of the Lord and
[43:43] tonight we look at this topic and some
[43:46] areas here and I'll trust me a blessing
[43:49] to you first Peter 3 verse 1 would read
[43:56] down 1 through 4 and I think we'll just
[43:59] have a word of Prayer after verse 4
[44:04] likewise you wives be in subjection to
[44:06] your own husbands and if any obey not
[44:09] the word they also may without the word
[44:12] be won by the conversation of the wives
[44:15] while they behold your chaise
[44:17] conversation coupled with fear whose
[44:21] adorning let it not be that outward
[44:22] adorning of plaiting the hair and the
[44:26] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[44:29] but let it be the hidden man of the
[44:31] heart and that which is not corruptible
[44:33] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[44:36] spirit which is in the sight of God
[44:38] great price
[44:40] that's just about heads and word of
[44:42] Prayer you have a need on your heart
[44:43] just make it on into God here tonight
[44:45] how many father Lord you are awesome you
[44:48] can move the mountains Oh God Lord you
[44:51] keep us in the valley you hide us from
[44:53] the rains and storms Lord and you give
[44:56] us a foundation a rock Lord our lives
[44:59] being built upon the rock of the Word of
[45:02] God thank you Lord for this rock we
[45:04] stand in your grace tonight Lord we're
[45:06] standing on your side as we sang Lord
[45:08] God we're happy to stomp and wave and
[45:11] sing and clap on your side Lord God I
[45:14] pray Lord tonight you'll speak to us
[45:16] through thy word anoint me Lord anoint
[45:18] your people Lord Jesus with the sweet
[45:20] Holy Spirit dear God and give us such a
[45:23] balance in the word Lord and help us
[45:25] rightly divide the word it might be Lord
[45:27] a better Christians as we leave this
[45:29] place later on the father will give you
[45:31] all the praise and glory in Jesus Christ
[45:33] name
[45:34] the church said Amen God that she's
[45:36] being seated praise God so this is part
[45:48] 4 I think we did part three on Sunday
[45:51] night by God's grace I kind of want to
[45:57] update just real quick on the book I'm
[46:00] writing here I finished chapter five yet
[46:02] actually today so now I got 25,000 words
[46:06] here so far and I think I got three more
[46:09] chapters chapter six someone knew the
[46:11] fashion history all the way down as far
[46:13] as I can do it chapter 7 I want to do
[46:16] all the questions and answers from you
[46:18] the YouTube videos some of the
[46:19] interesting questions answers then
[46:21] chapter 8 I want to do just the
[46:22] conclusion and show how everything we
[46:26] believe is not just our idea it's
[46:28] actually the perfect will of God because
[46:30] Paul said you can prove the perfect will
[46:32] of God and so but what do you need to do
[46:35] that church need a transformed mind our
[46:37] minds have to be transformed washed
[46:39] change enlightened our minds have to be
[46:42] totally illuminated by the truth of the
[46:44] Holy Spirit and then you can prove the
[46:46] perfect will of God
[46:47] so we're grateful for this opportunity
[46:50] now chapter 5 I just called a jewelry
[46:53] makeup tattoos and hi
[46:54] I just caught it that so we'll see if
[46:57] that changes let's start if we can now
[46:59] now that we read our scripture here
[47:01] let's make a few comments the emphasis
[47:05] for Christianity is the inward adorning
[47:09] of the Christian that's the whole
[47:11] emphasis that Paul's getting at Peter
[47:13] our text is Peter tonight the most
[47:15] important thing you can put on is Christ
[47:18] on the inside the character of Christ
[47:21] the responses of Christ the attitudes of
[47:25] Christ the most important thing to put
[47:28] on every morning is Christ him head upon
[47:31] your thoughts and your words your
[47:34] thoughts and your your actions and and
[47:36] everything you say and do that's the
[47:38] most important thing you can be dressed
[47:40] up in is the character of Christ the
[47:44] scripture does say though we our focus
[47:47] should not be on the plating of the hair
[47:49] which we was we learn was expensive
[47:51] hairstyles sometimes wrapped with gold
[47:54] and the hair and the wearing of gold or
[47:58] the putting on of expensive apparel so
[48:02] we we know more emphasis should be
[48:05] placed upon the inward than the outward
[48:09] and so I think that's I think that's a
[48:11] very practical application if we spend
[48:13] more time in the morning getting ready
[48:16] naturally then spiritually learn maybe
[48:18] we can do something about that maybe we
[48:20] can say well I need to spend more time
[48:22] with the Lord or I need to I need to
[48:24] dress up my spirit I need to adorn my
[48:28] spirit with more holiness or more
[48:30] meekness we need to spend more time
[48:33] dressing up the inward man than the
[48:35] outward man I know it's a race for me
[48:37] every morning it's a race I like to get
[48:39] up and and I like to race and get
[48:41] everything ready outside and then I like
[48:43] to go just rest it at the Bible rest at
[48:45] the computer as I study and then get on
[48:47] my knees and pray I like to spend I like
[48:49] to get all that done rush to get that
[48:51] done so I can get right to prayer and
[48:53] spend most of my free time with the Lord
[48:55] that's what I like to do by the grace of
[48:57] the Lord because I found if I did the
[49:01] opposite I was rushing too much if I
[49:03] just went right to prayer and study
[49:06] I felt like then I was I was sobered and
[49:08] you
[49:08] I would rush and I'd be late to work and
[49:10] I didn't want no I don't want to do that
[49:12] so I found I'll just rush and get ready
[49:15] and then I get into the fellowship with
[49:17] the Lord now you remember of course
[49:21] first Timothy 2:9 where the Bible
[49:24] plainly teaches that we must have the
[49:27] adornment of the Holy Spirit and I want
[49:31] to now look at Christian liberties I
[49:32] mentioned this little bit on Sunday and
[49:35] I want to make sure I go through this so
[49:37] let's start it with first Corinthians 8
[49:39] if you have your Bibles there let's go
[49:40] to first Corinthians 8 and we look at
[49:43] all three that the Bible names the Bible
[49:46] names three errors of Christian Liberty
[49:47] I'm gonna throw jewelry in there as a
[49:49] fourth because I believe jewelry fits
[49:51] the definition of a Christian Liberty so
[49:57] let's go to first Corinthians eight
[50:02] there are two chapters dedicated
[50:05] completely to Christian Liberty in the
[50:07] Bible and first Corinthians eight is one
[50:09] of them
[50:10] I know Christian Liberty is not really a
[50:15] shout and maybe sermon I don't know if
[50:18] I'll be shouting tonight at the
[50:19] Christian liberties as I was on Sunday
[50:21] you know with putting all demons under
[50:23] our feet you know but it's important and
[50:27] you're gonna see it's important because
[50:28] it affects our attitude how we think
[50:30] about others and how we treat others and
[50:35] it can be very important too if we're
[50:36] causing people to stumble then it's
[50:37] extremely important that we make sure we
[50:39] know our Christian liberties first
[50:42] contains eight verse eight I just want
[50:43] to start with that one so I'm defining
[50:45] Christian Liberty as this it's a carnal
[50:47] earthly action that's not a sin but at
[50:51] the same time they don't make us any
[50:53] more spiritual so it's just an action
[50:56] you do and it doesn't make you more
[50:57] spiritual but it's not it's not a sin
[51:00] either so first Corinthians eight eight
[51:02] now hide you and read that buddy okay so
[51:14] here's an area of this is one example
[51:16] meat if you eat meat you're no better if
[51:20] you don't eat meat you're no better
[51:22] it's just it's a it's an it's a neutral
[51:24] so liberties are like neutrals you're
[51:27] not going to get any closer to God by
[51:28] doing this but if you don't do it you're
[51:29] not gonna get any closer to God
[51:31] there's just areas of human life and
[51:34] decisions that we are given that we have
[51:37] to make next the main thing now let's go
[51:43] to Romans 14 where we flip him back
[51:44] between first Corinthians 8 in Romans 14
[51:46] I imagine for the first few minutes kind
[51:49] of going through some scriptures here
[51:51] Romans 14 6 now this is where we're
[51:57] going to get a little bit in the
[51:58] attitude that we have we got to we got
[52:01] to have the right attitude towards
[52:03] people that may do things differently
[52:04] than us and remember this is again on
[52:07] liberties where it's not a sin it's not
[52:09] a sin to make certain decisions so
[52:12] Romans 14:6
[52:14] liddie you can read that for us okay you
[52:31] see the pattern
[52:32] both people if one person eats meat they
[52:34] say thank you Lord for this burger thank
[52:36] you Lord for this steak the other person
[52:39] doesn't eat steak said thank you lord
[52:41] thank you Lord to see the Liberty is you
[52:46] have freedom on either side now notice
[52:49] the Bible didn't say well I give thanks
[52:51] but I hate that person who doesn't eat
[52:53] meat thank you Lord and I'm I could eat
[52:56] meat but I hate that person who doesn't
[52:58] act like me both people so whichever
[53:01] side you're on you can say praise the
[53:03] Lord
[53:04] now we're gonna get to the observance of
[53:06] Holy Days which i think is really
[53:07] applicable for our church in the message
[53:10] especially with Christmas and Easter
[53:12] because a lot of people on the side of
[53:14] no Christmas they just you know if you
[53:16] celebrate Christmas you're a pagan and
[53:20] you know and it depends which parts
[53:22] right it's just like with wine and meat
[53:24] it depends on what you do on that day
[53:26] because you can just like with jury you
[53:29] can go overboard or you can have the
[53:31] wrong spear with jewelry you can have
[53:32] the wrong spirit trying to celebrate
[53:35] Christmas
[53:36] you have the wrong spirit observing this
[53:38] day so we got to make sure we have the
[53:40] right spirit now whatever you do with
[53:46] the Liberty you must make sure it's done
[53:47] in faith in other words you have an
[53:50] assurance in your heart that this does
[53:51] not hinder your walk with God and that's
[53:54] in Romans 14:23 I'll read that one and
[53:57] he that doubted is damned if he eats
[54:00] because he eateth not of faith for
[54:04] whatsoever not of faith is sin now this
[54:08] is this is a Liberty now if you have a
[54:09] Liberty and you can go either way then
[54:12] you have to be fully persuaded in your
[54:13] mind it's okay that I do this it's okay
[54:16] that I don't do this now these things
[54:18] don't apply to the Word of God like
[54:22] smoking that's that's not a Liberty
[54:24] that's a clear sin in the Bible like
[54:27] cussing it like adultery or fornication
[54:29] or evil this doesn't apply to that
[54:32] because you should be condemned if you
[54:35] do one of those right you should feel
[54:37] the conviction you should feel a
[54:39] short-term condemnation because that's
[54:42] what the Bible said there's no
[54:43] condemnation to them they're in Christ
[54:44] Jesus you should feel a slight
[54:47] condemnation of slight conviction until
[54:50] you confess and get it right now it
[54:56] seems like and now since we're there
[54:58] let's go to verse 22 right above it it
[55:00] seems like in these areas of Liberty if
[55:02] you have any concern that this might
[55:04] cause somebody to stumble the thing you
[55:06] should do is do it when no one else is
[55:08] around that's what verse 22 hostile
[55:11] faith have it to thyself before God see
[55:17] happy is he that condemneth not himself
[55:18] in the thing which he allows me so as we
[55:22] get to these three areas meet holy days
[55:26] and wine which I've had two questions on
[55:29] wine lately which I thought was really
[55:30] good it's good to have those questions
[55:31] I've been studying on that a little bit
[55:33] this week
[55:33] and there's any question if there's any
[55:36] question well this person might this
[55:38] person might stumble if I do this then
[55:39] the thing to do is do it all by yourself
[55:41] in your own home so you don't cause
[55:44] somebody to get weak praise God that's
[55:47] the thing to do
[55:49] have it between you if you have faith in
[55:51] it but yet you might call somebody
[55:53] stumble and join with you and God just
[55:55] you two don't cause somebody's stumble
[55:58] because of pride well I don't care I
[56:01] don't they should be stronger than that
[56:02] well now you've got the wrong spear now
[56:04] you're not a servant now you're making
[56:06] yourself a lord and the Bible said we
[56:08] should all serve one another in fact
[56:10] none of us are great unless we're
[56:11] serving other people praise God now go
[56:16] to Roman's 15 1 we then that are strong
[56:19] ought to bear the infirmities of the
[56:21] weak and not to please ourselves so this
[56:23] is right after Christian liberty chapter
[56:25] oh I'm so strong in the faith I'm such a
[56:27] mature Christian well then your job
[56:30] according the Bible's not to please
[56:33] yourself with your liberties then your
[56:36] job is to make sure you're pleasing
[56:37] other people you would think the OP 0
[56:40] I'm such a mature person I can do
[56:43] whatever I want no ma'am no sir now it's
[56:47] just the opposite if you're so mature
[56:48] now you should be more sensitive to the
[56:51] needs of other people you should be more
[56:53] sensitive
[56:54] how is my behavior impacting sister
[56:56] so-and-so or brother so-and-so the more
[56:59] --mess the more mature and spiritual you
[57:01] are the more you care about how others
[57:03] are influenced through your life amen
[57:08] it's not oh I can get away with this or
[57:10] I can do this and I don't care what
[57:12] anybody says you should care what people
[57:13] say you should care what people think
[57:16] about your liberties in Christ amen then
[57:20] every one of us please his neighbor for
[57:22] his good to edification for even Christ
[57:26] please not himself but as is written the
[57:29] reproaches of them that reproached thee
[57:30] fell on me so who did what did Christ do
[57:33] to Christ serve himself or serve others
[57:34] of course Christ served others alright
[57:40] so now we can see that now there's main
[57:41] text romans 14 the whole chapter and
[57:44] romans
[57:45] i'm sorry first corinthians 8 the whole
[57:48] chapter can we have the younger people
[57:51] read again Elijah Rebekah Lydia and
[57:53] Malachi you guys can you guys read stuff
[57:54] it's okay yeah Bibles okay
[57:57] alright we appreciate your participation
[58:00] okay there's three air
[58:02] food is the first area holydays and wine
[58:05] those three areas let's look at those
[58:07] three areas of Liberty tonight so let's
[58:11] go maokai you've read right Elisha can
[58:13] you read romans 14 - okay so the first
[58:28] idea with eating is vegetarians versus
[58:32] meat-eaters you know that's the first
[58:33] idea and of course you know the Bible
[58:37] said you can do one or the other you
[58:38] know but you have to be careful it
[58:40] doesn't cause people to stumble now the
[58:42] way meat eating would cause when the
[58:44] stumble was interesting in the days of
[58:47] the Bible so certain first Corinthians
[58:49] eight in the days of paw at least in the
[58:51] city of Corinth there must have been
[58:53] restaurants or public places where they
[58:55] serve food and they must have had idols
[58:57] or totem poles standing up and when the
[58:59] owners of that restaurant or whatever
[59:01] public setting it was when they killed
[59:03] the animal and and cook the meat it was
[59:05] almost as if they were offering it to
[59:07] sacrifice because that's what the
[59:09] scripture says it's so strange but they
[59:12] must have had that type of atmosphere so
[59:15] 1st Corinthians 8 verse 4 and then Lydia
[59:17] why don't you read 4 and 5 risk on the
[59:22] ends 8 4 and 5 all right Rebekah do you
[59:45] want to read verse 6
[1:00:07] okay so we Christians know there's only
[1:00:09] one God all these idol worshipers there
[1:00:11] they're just worshipping Devils is what
[1:00:14] they're doing there's no there's only
[1:00:15] one God now verse 7 howbeit there's not
[1:00:19] every man that now it's for some with
[1:00:21] conscience of the idol unto this hour
[1:00:22] eat it as a thing offered unto an idol
[1:00:25] and their conscience being weak is the
[1:00:28] file so there the file when they're
[1:00:29] worshipping or they're eating this food
[1:00:32] that was offered to this idol so see
[1:00:34] their muscles better than some type of
[1:00:35] social setting where they would actually
[1:00:37] sacrifice and then this food this meat
[1:00:40] is for this idol then they go eat it
[1:00:42] there must been some type of public
[1:00:43] worship ceremony verse 8 but meat
[1:00:46] commendeth us not to God eating meat
[1:00:49] doesn't get us any closer to God for
[1:00:52] neither if we eat are we better than
[1:00:53] either if we eat not are we the worse
[1:00:54] but take heed lest by any means this
[1:00:57] Liberty of yours become a
[1:00:58] stumbling-block to them that are weak so
[1:01:02] the more mature you get the more you
[1:01:04] care about we Christians and your
[1:01:07] influence so for us in this case it
[1:01:09] would be what the younger children right
[1:01:11] are those of us who just came in the
[1:01:13] message recently or something like that
[1:01:14] we want to be very careful about weaker
[1:01:17] Christians verse 10 for If any man see
[1:01:21] thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in
[1:01:25] the idols temple so there must have been
[1:01:27] a time where a Christian was sitting in
[1:01:28] idols that I don't know how that could
[1:01:30] be possible but it must have been like I
[1:01:32] don't know I must had a restaurant on
[1:01:34] the side or something I don't know what
[1:01:36] but the Bible says shall not the
[1:01:38] conscience of him which is weak be
[1:01:40] emboldened to eat those things which are
[1:01:42] offered to idols and through thy
[1:01:44] knowledge shall the weak brother perish
[1:01:46] for whom Christ died so an a weaker
[1:01:49] Christian is in the height of a temple
[1:01:50] sees a stronger Christian the stronger
[1:01:53] Christian eats the meat that's offered
[1:01:55] to the idol and it causes this weak
[1:01:57] Christian to stumble and then perish
[1:02:03] look at that verse 12 but when you sin
[1:02:06] so against the Brethren you wound their
[1:02:08] weak conscience ye sin against Christ
[1:02:12] wherefore if meat make my brother to
[1:02:14] offend I will eat no flesh while
[1:02:16] the world standeth lest I make my
[1:02:18] brother to offend so the lesson I get
[1:02:21] here is I don't want to be in an idols
[1:02:23] temple for us I don't want to be in a
[1:02:25] bar right I don't want to be in a sports
[1:02:29] bar either
[1:02:30] I don't wanna be sitting at the table at
[1:02:32] Applebee's and saying give me another
[1:02:33] iced water and give me some of that you
[1:02:37] know I just don't want to be around it
[1:02:40] because whatever reason I don't know how
[1:02:42] this could be possible but Christians
[1:02:44] and Paul's they would eat meat in the
[1:02:46] idols temple and you could cause a
[1:02:48] brother to stumble doing that now I'll
[1:02:51] say another one sporting event that's
[1:02:52] why I don't go to NFL basketball NBA we
[1:02:55] have a LeBron James so close but I could
[1:02:57] care less I don't want to be there
[1:03:00] shouting and then the next guy over
[1:03:02] there he's got alcohol his arm around me
[1:03:04] saying yeah you know what fellowship
[1:03:07] does light have a darkness and what if I
[1:03:11] come home smell like alcohol
[1:03:12] I got alcohol spit all over what kind of
[1:03:14] testimony is that are you running to me
[1:03:17] at you know at that at the gas station
[1:03:19] and I've got my cab stuff 100 I'm
[1:03:21] smelling like alcohol and what kind of
[1:03:23] testimony is that well over the pastor
[1:03:26] does that well I can go do that but then
[1:03:29] when you're there you see those dancers
[1:03:31] at halftime with no clothes on and you
[1:03:34] stumble and get weak and parish whose
[1:03:36] fault is that it'd be my fault so see we
[1:03:42] care mature Christians care what the
[1:03:45] weak Christian see they want to be the
[1:03:49] example they want to show them
[1:03:51] watch me this is how you live your life
[1:03:53] in other words like Paul said follow me
[1:03:56] as I follow Christ
[1:03:59] we care about our example ok so buddy
[1:04:03] can see that now that's food so you can
[1:04:05] see whether it's you know vegetarian
[1:04:08] carnivore whatever you are it's ok what
[1:04:12] vegetarians do can't say thank you Jesus
[1:04:14] for this vegetarian meal and the meter
[1:04:16] says thank you Lord for this wonderful
[1:04:18] snake both people should be thankful we
[1:04:20] shouldn't look across one another and
[1:04:22] say oh you hypocrite or you sinner you
[1:04:25] know and my wife helped me out too with
[1:04:26] the meat remember I said I'll meet about
[1:04:28] bloody meat we talked
[1:04:29] that my wife told me that they they they
[1:04:32] usually hang the meat and all the blood
[1:04:33] comes out beforehand so that red the red
[1:04:36] blood there's not really the blue the
[1:04:38] blood the Bloods all come out that's
[1:04:40] just like the raw meats color so is that
[1:04:42] right honey did I say that right okay so
[1:04:45] you have to worry about eating a rare
[1:04:46] steak Church so thank you darlin thank
[1:04:50] you I always liked rare steaks I kind of
[1:04:52] I was concerned about that but she would
[1:04:55] know more about food preparation and I
[1:04:56] would I don't even know about that okay
[1:05:00] let's go to Holy Days now if you have
[1:05:02] any questions about food liberties let
[1:05:04] me know afterwards or send me a text
[1:05:05] anybody have any right now anybody have
[1:05:07] any questions about food liberties okay
[1:05:10] now those are the area's vegetarian and
[1:05:12] then meat and then where you eat your
[1:05:15] food and the association with your food
[1:05:18] I think we can see a lot of wisdom in
[1:05:20] that okay go to Romans 14 five and six
[1:05:24] back to Romans 14 the next area is
[1:05:27] observing Holy Days now here's where it
[1:05:29] gets sticky oh this person does
[1:05:31] Christmas and this person does Easter
[1:05:33] they called Easter and Easter is a pagan
[1:05:35] word I said and it might might be true
[1:05:38] but with brother branham you know caught
[1:05:40] it Easter and and God didn't convict him
[1:05:42] well then we got a tape we got to take
[1:05:44] that to thought you know we got to
[1:05:45] consider that Romans 14 five and six why
[1:05:51] don't man can you read that for me five
[1:05:52] and six raise the Lord so there's
[1:06:20] Christian's at mine this day is so holy
[1:06:23] this day so special and they go to extra
[1:06:25] lengths to say this day I'm really gonna
[1:06:28] make this a holy day and other
[1:06:31] Christians can be just as diligent
[1:06:32] saying every day's the same every day I
[1:06:35] serve the Lord every day is a
[1:06:36] consecration every day and this brother
[1:06:38] can say thank you Lord this is today is
[1:06:40] just like yesterday
[1:06:41] it's Easter but it's just like the day
[1:06:44] before Easter hallelujah but this person
[1:06:46] over here saying why we're so
[1:06:47] consecrated for Easter
[1:06:48] I haven't you know eat no meat and all
[1:06:51] these things and and he should be just
[1:06:53] to be able to say thank you Lord and
[1:06:54] thank you for my brother and sister
[1:06:56] that's worshiping here too yeah so it's
[1:06:59] both can both esteem the law both give
[1:07:03] thanks to the Lord it's important to
[1:07:05] have both kinds it's an area of Liberty
[1:07:12] now as I said earlier the Bible said
[1:07:16] let's go to Colossians 2:16 and 17 may
[1:07:18] we have Elijah read this one Colossians
[1:07:20] 2:16 and 17 like I said earlier I've
[1:07:23] been you know emailing people about
[1:07:24] Sabbath days and everything like that
[1:07:26] and I felt like God give me a a real
[1:07:30] good scripture but this is the one where
[1:07:31] it says Colossians 2:16 and 17 where
[1:07:35] Paul says holy day Sabbath days that was
[1:07:38] all shadow of what was to come
[1:07:42] and that was Christ Christ was who was
[1:07:44] to come amen
[1:07:45] he's alive amen cautions to 15/16 so I'm
[1:07:50] sorry sixteen and seventeen so Elijah
[1:07:52] can you read 16 and 17 thank you amen
[1:08:11] so don't let people judge you so how do
[1:08:14] you do that you got to go talk to them
[1:08:16] if they're judging you you got to go
[1:08:18] talk to them don't let them judge you
[1:08:20] because in this day it was a big deal
[1:08:22] because it was the it was the transition
[1:08:24] from Judaism into Christianity from law
[1:08:28] by works by the law of the Spirit right
[1:08:31] the grace but yet you know with by
[1:08:35] walking by the law of the Spirit you
[1:08:36] hate sin right you cast out anything
[1:08:38] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:08:40] of God and so we're in this transition
[1:08:42] and Paul said don't let them judge you
[1:08:45] about holy days that means you have to
[1:08:48] go to them and you humbly say you know
[1:08:50] please don't look down upon me I'm
[1:08:52] serving the Lord you can't judge me all
[1:08:55] these days we're typing of the works of
[1:08:58] Christ the Sabbath day was the rest to
[1:09:01] your soul right Sabbath the Sabbath day
[1:09:04] represented physical rest but that
[1:09:06] represented one day we're gonna rest
[1:09:08] from our works and we're going to accept
[1:09:10] Christ works amen by the baptism of Holy
[1:09:13] Ghost and now Christ will work through
[1:09:15] us we're gonna rest from our works and
[1:09:17] Christ is gonna work through us hey man
[1:09:19] so don't let people judge you in these
[1:09:21] areas of Liberty you got to go talk to
[1:09:23] them and say please don't look down upon
[1:09:24] me for these things and that's what I'd
[1:09:27] say that's what I'm learning here with
[1:09:29] with Christmas especially Christmas
[1:09:31] that's a big one where people get all
[1:09:33] upset if you celebrate Christmas now
[1:09:35] that we let's make that an area of
[1:09:37] Christian Liberty we have to make that
[1:09:40] area of Christian Liberty but can it
[1:09:42] easily go overboard
[1:09:43] yes well Graham warned about giving
[1:09:45] gifts and that can become a commercial
[1:09:47] or competitive spirit well I've got to
[1:09:50] get amen $25 because he got me $20 and
[1:09:53] now it's come competition and now it's I
[1:09:58] got to give back and I was just trying
[1:10:00] to say that money you know he just gone
[1:10:03] too far
[1:10:04] God loves a cheerful Giver not an
[1:10:06] arrogant giver or a disgruntled Giver
[1:10:09] God doesn't love a disgruntled Giver and
[1:10:12] then anything with a lie like Santa
[1:10:15] Claus God is never in a lie right so God
[1:10:18] can never be in Santa Claus so there's
[1:10:20] certain things you got a judge each one
[1:10:22] a mistletoe
[1:10:24] hanging above for people to kiss under
[1:10:26] would that be a godly thing to do of
[1:10:28] course not because we don't encourage
[1:10:30] especially if they're not married don't
[1:10:31] encourage fornication right you don't
[1:10:34] you don't want to model that for your
[1:10:35] children because they might not be
[1:10:38] married and they might try to go to a
[1:10:40] party and do something like that you
[1:10:42] want a model holiness but like in our
[1:10:45] family that's our this is our conviction
[1:10:46] we don't put up a tree
[1:10:48] that's I just don't sit for me that just
[1:10:50] my my conviction
[1:10:52] some people might and I've said it like
[1:10:54] this before if you can put that tree up
[1:10:56] and that makes you think of Christ go on
[1:10:58] ahead I'll be thankful for that
[1:11:01] Wow that tree makes them think of Christ
[1:11:03] and my home I put up a manger scene we I
[1:11:05] don't but the children do there's one
[1:11:08] that's a real toy little tykes one and
[1:11:10] then there's a real nice one I think my
[1:11:11] wife likes but that makes me think of
[1:11:15] Christ I can do that in my conscience
[1:11:18] but either way and then we give our get
[1:11:20] our children three gifts you know a toy
[1:11:22] a book and then clothes right is that
[1:11:25] right okay and just to try to limit it
[1:11:28] so it doesn't become oh I want more
[1:11:30] that's it then then they get up then
[1:11:33] they get a greedy spirit like all of us
[1:11:36] grown up maybe well that's all I got
[1:11:38] this year I should have got more than
[1:11:40] that you know right why didn't I get
[1:11:42] this and instead of just being happy
[1:11:44] you've got something so these are that's
[1:11:48] what I believe I can a that's where it
[1:11:50] takes a Christian Liberty but people
[1:11:52] over here work you know worship in
[1:11:54] saying thank you Lord you know the all
[1:11:55] these presents remind us of Christ thank
[1:11:57] you Lord we ought to say thank God even
[1:11:59] I'm thankful those people don't worship
[1:12:01] thank the Lord anyway but the trouble is
[1:12:04] over here you know trouble is over here
[1:12:07] when you just you you're disgruntle with
[1:12:09] everybody that made me take some of the
[1:12:11] Liberty the people over here say I'm not
[1:12:13] going to worship or I don't believe
[1:12:15] that's worship but thank the Lord anyway
[1:12:17] they're still faithful Christians now if
[1:12:19] they're sinning if they're sitting and
[1:12:21] offending them now the one that's
[1:12:23] offended has to go make that right or
[1:12:25] they're going to develop a root of
[1:12:27] bitterness right or a judgmental spear
[1:12:29] or a critical spirit see don't let don't
[1:12:33] let no one judge you in your liberties
[1:12:35] that's what I see those are the most
[1:12:37] easily
[1:12:38] easily seen areas of Liberty that I've
[1:12:41] seen serving the Lord these last 20
[1:12:44] years or so almost 20 years
[1:12:45] yeah 99 so 19 years been serving the
[1:12:50] Lord so that's that one okay so any
[1:12:52] questions on that any questions on holy
[1:12:54] days that's what I can see
[1:12:57] okay now let's drink go to drinking wine
[1:13:02] where did I put that scripture forgive
[1:13:11] me oh I think it's Romans 14 21 yeah
[1:13:14] believe it's Romans 14 - I'm sorry oh I
[1:13:22] put it on the previous page that's where
[1:13:24] it was okay yeah Romans 14:20 fun
[1:13:27] forgive me who wrote this book anyway
[1:13:32] Lord forgive me for heavens at 1421 okay
[1:13:42] Lydia might you read that case are you
[1:13:44] able to read to just okay
[1:13:48] Lydia 14 21 that's okay okay so wine
[1:13:59] drinking wine is somewhat an area of
[1:14:03] Liberty now I did I've been reading some
[1:14:06] researcher different preachers who are
[1:14:08] pulling different historical things
[1:14:11] about wine so I think Sunday I said
[1:14:14] something wrong it seems like wine today
[1:14:17] is the very same as it was then wine is
[1:14:20] fermented juice of crushed great grapes
[1:14:23] and it's an alcoholic beverage that can
[1:14:25] lead to intoxication okay so I think I
[1:14:29] was reading it wrong so forgive me what
[1:14:31] I said on Sunday now there is evidence
[1:14:34] though that in the New Testament the
[1:14:36] wine was two parts wine one part water
[1:14:39] so there are some evidence on that I'm
[1:14:41] still studying this out this topic is in
[1:14:43] progression okay so it's still an open
[1:14:45] topic I don't have all the answers like
[1:14:48] I like to have enough time this week
[1:14:52] but here's what I found it it seems like
[1:14:54] wine always had moderation all the way
[1:14:58] through the Bible because we find
[1:15:01] Melchizedek in Genesis 14 Melchizedek
[1:15:05] his way to congratulate Abraham after
[1:15:07] winning who what was it
[1:15:08] give him a own wine now that's natural
[1:15:12] wine
[1:15:12] he gave him natural wine his way to
[1:15:16] congratulate and what was that that was
[1:15:18] a pre figure of when Abraham's seed get
[1:15:20] the victory in the rapture and Jesus
[1:15:23] will serve us oil wine Rightmove wine
[1:15:25] for communion but what did we see
[1:15:30] Abraham was a type of the bride Noah was
[1:15:33] a type of who foolish version what he
[1:15:36] stumble with he got drunk on wine so
[1:15:39] Abraham could handle wine with
[1:15:44] moderation but the foolish virgin get so
[1:15:50] that's just interesting to see that
[1:15:52] there's wine all through the Old
[1:15:54] Testament fact there's over two hundred
[1:15:56] thirty three verses on wine in the Bible
[1:15:58] and you have wine on both so you have
[1:16:00] scriptures on both sides some are
[1:16:01] positive of course the others are
[1:16:04] negative when they deal with excess of
[1:16:06] wine now brother Branham said then this
[1:16:10] is where I was wrong brother Branham
[1:16:12] said the New Testament wine has to be
[1:16:13] intoxicated I'm sorry has to have the
[1:16:16] power to toxicated because he said new
[1:16:18] wine has got life in it he says because
[1:16:21] if you put old wine I'm sorry you put
[1:16:23] new wine in old bottles they burst so
[1:16:27] they may have had a little water in them
[1:16:29] but they still had growing power the
[1:16:31] fermenting power in them but brother
[1:16:35] Graham said this building up said oh
[1:16:36] I'll just take a social drink it won't
[1:16:38] hurt anyone but the Branham said it's
[1:16:40] sin the real eagle knows it's sin he
[1:16:42] says so I believe it is sin to drink in
[1:16:46] public I believe that is a sin because
[1:16:50] of all the eyes watching you think about
[1:16:52] if you're out let's say just out to eat
[1:16:54] with you and your wife or you and your
[1:16:55] hubby
[1:16:55] and this waitress brings you both a tall
[1:16:58] glass of wine and you get the talk and
[1:17:01] say oh you're a Christian what church
[1:17:03] you go to
[1:17:05] and here you are this big old glass of
[1:17:07] wine chugging it with your dinner you're
[1:17:11] gonna drive home after drinking that
[1:17:12] wine which you might have a level of
[1:17:17] alcohol blood alcohol content
[1:17:18] what kind of testimony is that it's not
[1:17:22] really good testimony I'll say like this
[1:17:24] if you wanna drink wine the privacy your
[1:17:25] own home that's between you and God but
[1:17:28] it better be between you and God only I
[1:17:30] don't I don't drink wine in my own home
[1:17:33] the reason is because I know my flesh
[1:17:36] might start liking it and I don't want
[1:17:37] to get addicted the second thing is I
[1:17:40] don't want my children to see me
[1:17:41] drinking wine at home I only want them
[1:17:43] to see me drinking wine in the house of
[1:17:45] God I could I have the liberty I could
[1:17:49] but at much if my children aren't safe
[1:17:51] yet or filled all the ghosts yet they
[1:17:53] could backslide and they could start
[1:17:55] sneaking some of the alcohol because
[1:17:59] they see daddy drinking it okay so
[1:18:02] that's why I don't drink it in public
[1:18:04] the only well public of restaurants I
[1:18:05] drink in public you're right here oh
[1:18:07] yeah you do too right we do that
[1:18:10] together but it's a sin to do it
[1:18:13] publicly I believe that it is a sin just
[1:18:15] like the meat if someone eating meat
[1:18:17] just meat just hamburger if that could
[1:18:22] cause somebody to go overboard and then
[1:18:24] spend more time at the idols temple I
[1:18:25] don't know how it happened and then get
[1:18:27] caught up in sin and be lost and then
[1:18:29] you're kind of a fort how much more
[1:18:31] easier could someone get addicted to
[1:18:33] alcohol right alcohol ruin my wife's
[1:18:36] family growing up because of her father
[1:18:39] drinking alcohol it ruined the whole
[1:18:41] family it destroyed the whole family and
[1:18:42] it's still destructive today so see we
[1:18:47] must consider the weaker Christians
[1:18:49] right the younger Christians we must
[1:18:51] consider them and not cause anybody
[1:18:53] stumble whether Scriptures about the
[1:18:56] blessing of alcohol yes there are there
[1:19:00] is also many people that abstain from
[1:19:01] John the Baptist abstain from it Solomon
[1:19:03] I'm sorry Samson abstain from it the
[1:19:05] Rechabites the Nazarites and the
[1:19:08] Levitical priests and the temple can
[1:19:10] never drink any wine because they were
[1:19:12] holy unto the Lord now Jesus drank wine
[1:19:16] on the church this is the thing I'm
[1:19:17] wrestling with right out
[1:19:19] right now Jesus drank wine because the
[1:19:22] Bible said John the Baptist came not
[1:19:25] eating not drinking but Jesus came
[1:19:27] eating and drinking so the way I look at
[1:19:30] it now it seems like Jesus only drank
[1:19:32] wine with his disciples that's what it
[1:19:34] seems like to me because I can't find
[1:19:35] any scripture where he had wine with
[1:19:37] sinners you let me know if I'm wrong
[1:19:42] that's what I see it right now so in
[1:19:44] other words Jesus only had wine at
[1:19:46] communion or at fellowship with his
[1:19:49] disciples that's what I can see from the
[1:19:51] scripture I can't see any other way
[1:19:54] remember Jesus is the example so Jesus
[1:20:00] drank wine so that's why and at the
[1:20:01] Lord's Supper he gave bread and wine he
[1:20:05] actually drank he said I won't drink of
[1:20:07] this cup of wine with you until we drink
[1:20:08] in a new in my father's Kingdom
[1:20:12] so one sip of wine which we take we take
[1:20:16] one sip of wine now I'm gonna watch you
[1:20:17] guys make sure you take a sip time not a
[1:20:19] chug you understand what I'm saying if
[1:20:23] Jesus had it they shared the cup
[1:20:25] remember they passed the cup they shared
[1:20:26] a cup if Jesus Christ God in flesh could
[1:20:31] handle a drink of wine I can me here not
[1:20:34] sin then we can do that too we can't let
[1:20:37] that be a source of condemnation or
[1:20:41] anything you know the Bible said that
[1:20:44] you know the Bible said wine Cheers God
[1:20:46] and man did you know the bat was in that
[1:20:48] wine Cheers God and man wine made God
[1:20:54] happy because it was making man happy
[1:20:57] right so like a communion or like
[1:21:00] Abraham can you imagine you just whipped
[1:21:03] four nations and you're all tired and
[1:21:07] worn out you know you're the leader you
[1:21:08] just trained all these men and you come
[1:21:10] home and there's Melchizedek Oh God in
[1:21:12] flesh and what does God give you he
[1:21:15] gives you a hug you know my son and then
[1:21:17] he gives you a wine and he's so tired he
[1:21:19] takes a little drink of water you see
[1:21:22] how that would be a blessing how that
[1:21:24] would cheer God and man oh we just got
[1:21:26] the victory and God refreshed me with a
[1:21:28] little wine there's no way we're ham got
[1:21:32] drunk though because he
[1:21:32] a lot so he wasn't uh he wasn't no
[1:21:35] equality he was Abraham see he was
[1:21:37] Abraham right
[1:21:39] he's Abraham he's a father of faith so
[1:21:42] he took Oh baby drink of wine said
[1:21:44] praise Allah praise the Living God
[1:21:45] Melchizedek this is my high priest you
[1:21:47] know thank you for the oil wine so see
[1:21:50] it has ability to cheer God and men
[1:21:53] I don't you think God's happy when you
[1:21:56] take wine at communion don't you think
[1:21:58] God's happy because you're representing
[1:22:01] that I'm in drinking in the life of
[1:22:03] Jesus Christ oh that's my son that's my
[1:22:07] daughter they're drinking that wine and
[1:22:09] it's given them some type of a little
[1:22:12] bit of stimulation and it's representing
[1:22:16] what the Holy Spirit does to a heart
[1:22:18] that loves Christ I don't know about you
[1:22:20] but I like drinking that wine I like
[1:22:21] doing your mind again I feel a little
[1:22:23] simulation when I drink the wine of
[1:22:24] communion and it reminds me that's what
[1:22:27] the Word of God is supposed to do amen
[1:22:30] it's exactly right the Bible said wine
[1:22:34] makes the man's heart glad that Psalms
[1:22:38] 104 15 the priest would get white
[1:22:43] off-white offerings drink offerings when
[1:22:45] offering sacrifices God wanted God
[1:22:47] wanted that poured out for him because
[1:22:51] as the power to give life has the power
[1:22:53] to stimulate you now of course all that
[1:22:56] was foreshadowing the new wine they got
[1:22:58] on the day of Pentecost amen that's the
[1:23:01] most important wine no we can get and if
[1:23:03] you like drinking natural wine more than
[1:23:04] that wine something's wrong with you I
[1:23:06] like the Holy Ghost Rider a lot more
[1:23:09] than that amen I cash out or cry or pray
[1:23:12] intercede I get more stimulation of that
[1:23:15] just by drinking a little wine down here
[1:23:16] I get a lot more stimulation from seeing
[1:23:20] God move and bless and bring people to
[1:23:22] repentance or tears or victory or
[1:23:24] healing I get a lot more joy out of the
[1:23:25] new line than I do just the natural line
[1:23:28] and if you're not that way something's
[1:23:30] wrong with you because then it's more
[1:23:33] natural instead of spiritual yeah so
[1:23:37] this the
[1:23:37] this pastor quotes dictionaries
[1:23:40] encyclopedias that said in the New
[1:23:41] Testament wine was probably cut to parts
[1:23:43] water I'm sorry two parts water to one
[1:23:45] part wine that's really watered-down
[1:23:47] wine that's what this one so I'm gonna
[1:23:50] search this out I'm gonna try to get
[1:23:51] more on that especially before I put in
[1:23:52] the book I don't want to put in the book
[1:23:54] without really searching it out okay and
[1:23:57] then of course we know the New Testament
[1:23:58] Scriptures about be not drunken on wine
[1:24:02] but be filled with the spirit okay
[1:24:04] Ephesians 5:19 Paul says do not be drunk
[1:24:08] on wine so Jesus would a particular wine
[1:24:11] at just with his disciples here
[1:24:13] communion he wouldn't have been he would
[1:24:15] you went on it got a little tipsy you
[1:24:17] can you imagine God getting tipsy off a
[1:24:19] little wine no it's just that initial
[1:24:21] drink that initial stimulation to kind
[1:24:24] of give you a little stimulation to wake
[1:24:26] you up and give you a little feeling of
[1:24:28] the power of life and wine to start
[1:24:31] making you think about the power of the
[1:24:32] Holy Ghost amen
[1:24:33] that's that's right amen okay that's
[1:24:37] that next area that was the area of
[1:24:40] third area of Liberty I'm gonna make
[1:24:44] sure I didn't forget anything yeah so I
[1:24:46] mentioned this on Sunday night John the
[1:24:48] Baptist came neither drinking wine nor
[1:24:49] strong drink so why it is like natural
[1:24:51] wine we have today the juice from the
[1:24:52] grapes strong drink is like vodka and
[1:24:55] what's some other ones no no no no I
[1:24:58] don't know too many alcohols vodka
[1:25:01] what's some other hard drinks liquor
[1:25:02] yeah liquor that's all I know if I were
[1:25:07] to the store I saw okay I know that name
[1:25:09] but I can't name him now because I don't
[1:25:12] have any interaction with them now my
[1:25:13] wife cooks with different ones we got to
[1:25:14] buy from the store you know and I don't
[1:25:16] I don't do anything like that
[1:25:18] now remember why though can be used for
[1:25:21] medicines sake because Paul told Timothy
[1:25:22] try little wine for your stomach's sake
[1:25:25] and you're often infirmities so that's
[1:25:28] where you'd use it for medicine I don't
[1:25:30] recommend you going out to the story on
[1:25:31] buying wine and then you feel bad you
[1:25:33] drink a little wine I don't know I don't
[1:25:34] know I would say seek the doctor first
[1:25:37] that's a ho dude because again you might
[1:25:40] get in a bad habit well every time a
[1:25:41] little tired I'll take a little how cool
[1:25:42] pretty soon you'll be addicted to
[1:25:43] alcohol
[1:25:45] remember there's little weak eyes
[1:25:47] watching you
[1:25:48] raise god there's weak little eyes
[1:25:52] there's weak little ears hearing what
[1:25:54] you say about these things all right let
[1:26:00] me know if you haven't remember now the
[1:26:01] Bible says clearly drunkards will not
[1:26:04] inherit the kingdom of God it's
[1:26:06] impossible you cannot be a drunk and
[1:26:08] inherit the rapture it's impossible so
[1:26:12] that's how far we got to stay away from
[1:26:13] wine and member Paul said Paul said I
[1:26:19] will not drink wine here let's go back
[1:26:21] to first contains eight I won't drink
[1:26:22] wine or eat meat or do anything as long
[1:26:25] as the world stands if I would offend
[1:26:28] anybody so that's first Corinthians 8
[1:26:31] verse 13 that's quite a statement
[1:26:35] as long as this world is standing I'm
[1:26:37] not going to eat meat around the wheat
[1:26:40] Christian who might see me eating meat
[1:26:41] you know in the idols temple I won't
[1:26:43] drink any wine around a weak Christian I
[1:26:45] won't do it as long as this world is
[1:26:48] standing guess what this world's gonna
[1:26:49] stand a long time right this is just
[1:26:53] gonna get a fiery burning on the outside
[1:26:55] and then God's gonna start all over you
[1:26:56] know walk out the ashes of the wicked
[1:26:58] the millennia I'm starting the
[1:26:59] millennium this world's gonna stand a
[1:27:01] long time that means Paul said I'm
[1:27:03] forever dedicated to not causing weak
[1:27:06] Christians to stumble that's right first
[1:27:09] corinthians 813
[1:27:10] how about Rebecca can you read that one
[1:27:12] I think it's I think that's it your turn
[1:27:14] is that okay amen thank you I will eat
[1:27:30] no flesh while the world stands if
[1:27:32] there's any question I'm gonna call
[1:27:34] somebody stumble I just won't do it I
[1:27:36] won't do it bless you
[1:27:39] now the main thing is not to judge one
[1:27:43] another I've kind of gone through that
[1:27:44] so I think I'm gonna skip past that but
[1:27:45] I have a whole paragraph on Christians
[1:27:47] should not judge others and the Bible
[1:27:50] said the only thing you should judge is
[1:27:51] yourself judge yourself that you're not
[1:27:56] causing other people to stumble
[1:27:58] that's what we should judge so shouldn't
[1:28:00] say oh I can't believe they know they
[1:28:02] put up a tree or I can't believe I can't
[1:28:06] believe they don't even celebrate
[1:28:07] Christmas what kind of Christian are
[1:28:08] they don't judge just be thankful just
[1:28:13] give thanks if they've hurt you go talk
[1:28:15] to them about it
[1:28:18] okay next all right let's go to jewelry
[1:28:20] now this is when I have the most
[1:28:22] scripture on jewelry now let me say this
[1:28:27] clearly jewelry is not called a liberty
[1:28:30] in the Bible but I feel like it is this
[1:28:32] is my understanding I told you the three
[1:28:35] that are literally called Liberty's
[1:28:37] right holy days meat and wine those are
[1:28:39] literally called areas of Liberty but
[1:28:43] jewelry seems like it because you have
[1:28:45] you have scriptures on the good side
[1:28:47] where believers wear jewelry and then
[1:28:51] you have sinners who wear jewelry at the
[1:28:52] same jewelry so that goes to show too
[1:28:56] that there's a spirit it depends what
[1:28:58] spirit you have right you can you cannot
[1:29:01] wear any jewelry and have the right
[1:29:02] spirit you can also not wear jewelry to
[1:29:04] have the wrong spirit or you could wear
[1:29:07] jewelry and have the right spirit or you
[1:29:09] can wear jewelry and have the wrong
[1:29:10] spirit so it kind of depends which side
[1:29:13] you're on now let me say this clearly
[1:29:16] jewelry should be worn and it must be
[1:29:18] inexpensive unless it's like a wedding
[1:29:20] ring because that's the modern-day dowry
[1:29:23] right in the old days that a member saw
[1:29:26] he wanted a dowry for his daughter for
[1:29:29] David what he asked for 200 force or 100
[1:29:31] foreskins of the Philistines
[1:29:32] well usually would have been money but
[1:29:35] he wanted David to die in battle so he
[1:29:36] said make it 100 foreskins of the
[1:29:38] Philistines and all that money in this
[1:29:41] case the foreskins but in the regular
[1:29:42] case would have been money goes to the
[1:29:44] father of the bride well what happened I
[1:29:47] think just over time is that instead of
[1:29:49] that money going to the father the
[1:29:50] father just said you put it on her
[1:29:51] finger you know just give that ring to
[1:29:53] the the wife there that's what I think
[1:29:56] that's what it seems like happening in
[1:29:57] the Western culture now I know different
[1:30:01] cultures have dowry still
[1:30:03] and that's alright that it's their
[1:30:06] freedom that's a custom customs are okay
[1:30:09] as long as you don't break the Word of
[1:30:10] God but if you do wear our jewelry most
[1:30:14] jewelry should be inexpensive and it
[1:30:15] should be worn in moderation
[1:30:17] remember the emphasis should be on the
[1:30:19] inward jewelry the inward character the
[1:30:22] inward adorning more than the outward
[1:30:24] adorning expensive jewelry should be
[1:30:28] avoided unless it's like a wedding ring
[1:30:29] because brother Graham said wedding
[1:30:31] rings are okay how many know that the
[1:30:33] Graham said a wedding ring is okay he
[1:30:35] said you Nazarenes I heard it today
[1:30:37] he said you Nazarene is used to not
[1:30:38] baptize a woman if she had a wedding
[1:30:40] ring on he said shame on you the
[1:30:43] Nazarenes would have baptized a married
[1:30:45] woman if she had a ring on you got to
[1:30:46] take that ring off before you can be
[1:30:48] forgiven you got to take that ring off
[1:30:49] before you can be saved
[1:30:51] come on a rings gonna keep you from
[1:30:53] being saved no got to read your Bible
[1:30:56] that's it you got it now don't get me
[1:30:59] wrong can a ring good a ring be an idol
[1:31:01] of course of course good earrings be an
[1:31:06] idol of course could any jewelry be an
[1:31:09] idol can my watch mean I don't yes any
[1:31:11] item of jewelry could become an idol to
[1:31:13] a person it depends what the purpose is
[1:31:17] behind that so let's start with rings so
[1:31:24] go to
[1:31:25] let's just go to Genesis 41 42 so my
[1:31:29] weight maokai and i join you ready rings
[1:31:33] it start with rings god accepts certain
[1:31:35] kinds of rings now since I've already
[1:31:39] said wedding rings there's no scripture
[1:31:42] where God says don't put on the wedding
[1:31:44] ring or thou shalt not wear a wedding
[1:31:46] ring the Bible never says that so we
[1:31:49] clearly have the Liberty to wear ring
[1:31:50] and there's three people that wore rings
[1:31:53] in the Bible that we're good people
[1:31:54] the first one is Joseph son of Jacob the
[1:31:58] second one is Mordechai uncle to Esther
[1:32:03] and the third one is the prodigal son
[1:32:05] they all wore rings and nobody ever God
[1:32:09] ever removed them for that now do you
[1:32:11] know why they warm didn't remember they
[1:32:14] had stamps on them they were seals
[1:32:16] so they would put they had like a little
[1:32:18] seal on it like a little carving that
[1:32:20] was like the Kings signature or the
[1:32:23] power authority now to put that in ink
[1:32:25] and then they stamped that that was so
[1:32:28] it was like a more of a business thing
[1:32:29] but did God hate them because they were
[1:32:32] rings of course not of course not to God
[1:32:35] hate people they were writing wedding
[1:32:36] rings of course not there's no scripture
[1:32:39] that says that does God hate when a
[1:32:40] woman paints her face and cuts her hair
[1:32:42] yes
[1:32:42] God hates that that breaks the Word of
[1:32:44] God when a man gets drunk and customs
[1:32:48] and beats his wife does God hate that
[1:32:50] you better believe God hates that so
[1:32:54] it's got to be rightly divided so
[1:32:56] Genesis 41 42 malachi once read it he's
[1:33:07] a type of christ type of christ ester
[1:33:10] two three and four okay when you turn
[1:33:13] there we have Elijah read Esther - I'm
[1:33:16] sorry Esther eight two and three forgive
[1:33:18] me I'm all nervous forgive me I'm a
[1:33:22] little nervous because like I said I
[1:33:23] I've just been doing a lot of writing
[1:33:25] and I'm trying to cover the whole
[1:33:26] chapter but working on for two weeks now
[1:33:28] Esther eight two and three pardon me
[1:33:42] okay and Mordecai is a type of 144,000
[1:33:47] right he gets restored after Haman is
[1:33:50] destroyed glory and he puts a ring on
[1:33:53] and God never said don't put the ring on
[1:33:55] you shouldn't put the ring on it's for a
[1:33:57] purpose it had meaning it was part of
[1:33:59] authority and of course the wedding ring
[1:34:02] represents your vow your promise you're
[1:34:04] never gonna break your promise you know
[1:34:07] how to I was working with a couple this
[1:34:09] week and the couple was really stressed
[1:34:10] out one of the couple and they said
[1:34:11] maybe we should just take some time off
[1:34:13] and and have the husband or wife move
[1:34:16] out for a couple weeks and I said
[1:34:17] absolutely not and I said you should
[1:34:21] never do that the Bible said if you have
[1:34:23] wrath don't let the Sun go down upon
[1:34:25] your wrath that's just making room for
[1:34:28] someone to me oh well I
[1:34:29] just met somebody new because I'm not
[1:34:32] living with my wife or husband anymore I
[1:34:33] said absolutely not don't do that
[1:34:36] remember that vow you promised in front
[1:34:40] of God in front of everyone you promised
[1:34:43] never leave them nor forsake them that's
[1:34:45] what was what it comes down to you might
[1:34:47] not have said those words but that's
[1:34:48] really what you said now in the case of
[1:34:53] if like a woman's being beaten should
[1:34:56] she leave yet brother Ram I heard him
[1:34:57] say that today separate yourself he said
[1:34:59] or if a woman is cussing and cussing out
[1:35:02] a man who's serving God and she's not
[1:35:04] saved and he just can't handle it and
[1:35:06] all the maybe she dresses him moral and
[1:35:08] maybe she's having adulteries and he
[1:35:10] wants to separate he can separate
[1:35:11] himself there but he cannot marry again
[1:35:14] do you understand that Church the woman
[1:35:16] cannot marry again if she's already
[1:35:18] married they tend not to marry they
[1:35:20] cannot do it again because they're bound
[1:35:21] as long as the other person is alive but
[1:35:25] there are sins that are so serious if
[1:35:27] you have to separate yourself the Bible
[1:35:29] says you can live in peace live in peace
[1:35:30] if you can't separate yourself you're
[1:35:32] not under bondage to serve that person
[1:35:33] but you cannot marry another all right
[1:35:37] now this is the pretty striking one nose
[1:35:40] rings you know nose rings in the Bible
[1:35:42] do you know Rebecca Warren nose ring in
[1:35:44] the Bible yeah
[1:35:47] Genesis 24 47 let's go there the Bible
[1:35:49] said the ring was on her face and
[1:35:51] earring on her face not head face and if
[1:35:56] you look up the Hebrew meaning for this
[1:35:57] earring its nose ring so Eliezer when he
[1:36:01] went to get Rebecca
[1:36:02] he had bracelets for her rings earrings
[1:36:07] and a nose ring now we're getting down
[1:36:11] to some real nitty-gritty here I see all
[1:36:14] your faces yeah here here it is with
[1:36:20] jewelry jewelry for a Christian can
[1:36:23] never mark the skin permanently damage
[1:36:26] the skin cut the skin or pierce the skin
[1:36:29] so whenever nose rings she had on it was
[1:36:32] a slide on or clip on or something
[1:36:35] because you'll never find a scripture
[1:36:37] and that I can say that all the way
[1:36:39] through the Bible you'll never see God
[1:36:40] allowing someone to pierce their skin as
[1:36:42] a Christian
[1:36:43] or Jew or mark it scratch it or make it
[1:36:49] bleed or cut themselves you never see
[1:36:52] that
[1:36:52] so whatever jewelry all she has it was
[1:36:55] jewelry that could just be slid on or
[1:36:56] whatever however however you did it
[1:36:59] because that's the pattern of God and
[1:37:01] whose temple are you
[1:37:03] you're the temple the Holy Spirit amen
[1:37:06] remember which persons cut themselves in
[1:37:10] the Bible the maniac of gather wood cut
[1:37:12] himself with stones right the four
[1:37:15] hundred priests avail they cut
[1:37:17] themselves and say Bale hear us you know
[1:37:18] there's Elijah here I see Russ they're
[1:37:20] cutting themselves the only time God's
[1:37:23] people cut themselves was circumcision
[1:37:25] that I can find and then God stopped
[1:37:30] that in the New Testament so now I can't
[1:37:32] find anything in the Bible for the new
[1:37:33] testing where God ever causes people to
[1:37:35] cut their skin pierce their skin mark
[1:37:38] their skin or make themselves bleed ever
[1:37:41] understand that God has that pattern he
[1:37:44] never the only people that would have
[1:37:46] the big earrings right were the slaves
[1:37:48] the Bible said the slave that wanted to
[1:37:51] just you don't want to go free oh I just
[1:37:53] love my master I love being ordered
[1:37:54] around by my master what kind of hurt
[1:37:56] what kind of that person have to be
[1:37:58] insane I just want to just I just want
[1:38:01] to serve my master and just work for
[1:38:03] them I don't want to I don't wanna work
[1:38:04] for myself I don't want my old land I
[1:38:06] know what my own house and God said take
[1:38:07] that man down to the temple and put it
[1:38:10] all through his ear that's the only
[1:38:12] person that God that would be a believer
[1:38:14] that God said put a hole in their hear
[1:38:17] somebody that's so I don't know what the
[1:38:20] word to use but somebody that's so out
[1:38:22] of their mind they love slavery more
[1:38:24] than they love freedom and they remember
[1:38:27] they didn't want to hear the gospel
[1:38:28] trumpet of freedom the Jubilee trumpet
[1:38:33] that's only person that's the only
[1:38:35] believer that God would ever say put
[1:38:37] something through their body see that's
[1:38:40] right okay new tongue rings can do nose
[1:38:42] rings nothing that goes through the body
[1:38:44] because that's a sign that you've turned
[1:38:46] down your freedom because that be
[1:38:50] permanent W everyone would know this the
[1:38:51] person couldn't leave layer and say oh
[1:38:53] you know I do want to go free now no
[1:38:55] you're permanently
[1:38:56] art God God never permanently marks any
[1:39:01] real believer except when they wanted to
[1:39:04] be a slave the rest their lives that's
[1:39:07] why we shouldn't have tattoos and all
[1:39:08] these things
[1:39:10] does that help I got the grace okay now
[1:39:15] I think you know the prodigal son I
[1:39:16] don't think we need to read that but you
[1:39:17] remember he he said put a robe on him
[1:39:18] kill the fatted calf put a ring on his
[1:39:21] fingers give him authority so it had a
[1:39:23] meeting why would Jesus say don't wear
[1:39:26] white at wedding rings but he tells a
[1:39:27] story about a man wearing a ring okay if
[1:39:30] he's against rings he's against all
[1:39:31] rings right but you see God God likes
[1:39:36] rings now Lydia can you read Genesis 24
[1:39:40] 47 this is the nose ring of looks like
[1:39:42] Rebekah at a nose ring on earring upon
[1:39:57] her face not her head her face and that
[1:39:59] Hebrew word means nose ring
[1:40:01] now go to Isaiah 3:21 this is a text
[1:40:09] that has nose Jules nose jewels for the
[1:40:14] Hebrew nose jewels as they have 321
[1:40:22] anybody got it
[1:40:24] okay can you read it but okay yeah
[1:40:32] that's a really short Scripture sorry
[1:40:35] but if you if you read chapter 3 God
[1:40:38] starts out the chapter rebuking Israel
[1:40:40] and then he narrows in on the daughters
[1:40:42] design remember that he narrows in on
[1:40:44] the daughters design and church I
[1:40:45] counted it
[1:40:46] they had 21 accessories 21 outward
[1:40:50] accessories bonnets head head turbans
[1:40:54] earrings nose rings they had high heels
[1:40:58] because they were mincing the Bible's
[1:40:59] they're mincing as they go shorter steps
[1:41:01] they're mincing as they go they're
[1:41:03] tinkling of their feet think of think of
[1:41:05] think good think ooh all kinds of ankle
[1:41:07] jewelry all kind so in the day of there
[1:41:10] Judgment what were they adorning they
[1:41:12] were focusing more on the outside than
[1:41:14] the inside but member Rebecca had a nose
[1:41:16] ring
[1:41:17] temporary she had bracelets she had
[1:41:20] earrings but yet all these of her
[1:41:24] descendants had the same things but they
[1:41:26] had more then more adornment so they
[1:41:30] went overboard with it and in chapter 4
[1:41:33] out of here I read Isaiah chapter 4
[1:41:34] let's go there it's a really short
[1:41:35] chapter but God said he's gonna destroy
[1:41:37] all that foolishness of the women out of
[1:41:39] Israel and the remnant that would be
[1:41:41] left would be holy so there is a
[1:41:45] striking judgment against these
[1:41:47] daughters of Zion with their 21
[1:41:49] accessories on striking so see there's
[1:41:55] the balance you have a godly woman to
[1:41:56] Rebekah remember they prayed Oh let her
[1:41:58] be the mother of thousands and millions
[1:41:59] the Bible said she was such a godly
[1:42:02] woman a type of the bride of Jesus
[1:42:03] Christ who had these bracelets now the
[1:42:07] other idea too is that they might have
[1:42:08] only worn them at the time of engagement
[1:42:10] or wedding that's another thought I've
[1:42:12] read in some of the historians maybe
[1:42:14] they had these bracelets and nose ring
[1:42:15] and earrings but they only wore at the
[1:42:17] time of their engagement or a wedding
[1:42:20] that was another thought because it was
[1:42:22] kind of like money so this I got a
[1:42:24] little more to study on this you know
[1:42:25] because a lot of times they didn't have
[1:42:27] the same currency so the countries would
[1:42:29] they have to trade with something so
[1:42:31] this was like money to them this jewelry
[1:42:37] okay yeah
[1:42:41] Isaiah 4 sorry this is a short chapter I
[1:42:45] read it myself on Tuesday yesterday and
[1:42:48] in that day seven women shall take a
[1:42:50] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[1:42:52] bread and wear our apparel only let us
[1:42:54] be called by the name to take away our
[1:42:56] reproach in that day shall the branch
[1:43:00] the Lord be beautiful and glorious and
[1:43:01] the fruit of the earth shall be
[1:43:03] excellent and comely for them that are
[1:43:04] escaped of Israel to the escaped ones
[1:43:06] and this should come to pass that he
[1:43:08] that is left in Zion and he that
[1:43:09] remained in Jerusalem shall be called
[1:43:11] holy even every one that is written
[1:43:13] among the living in Jerusalem when the
[1:43:16] Lord shall wash away the filth of the
[1:43:19] daughters of Zion
[1:43:21] see God said they have 21 accessories on
[1:43:25] I'm gonna wipe away their filth
[1:43:27] to see the to much jewelry
[1:43:30] / it was a sign of a moral heart yeah
[1:43:34] right
[1:43:35] pride and that's what they had that
[1:43:37] haughty spirits they were prideful they
[1:43:39] stretched out their necks they went
[1:43:41] mincing as they go can you picture these
[1:43:42] I'm an awful one D you be the picture
[1:43:45] but they had their bottoms that's what
[1:43:47] high heels making you they stick out
[1:43:48] your bottom then they could push out
[1:43:49] your chest to get your center of balance
[1:43:52] right to make a stretch out your neck
[1:43:54] and God said this filthiness is gonna be
[1:43:58] wiped out of Israel and when the Lord
[1:44:02] shall wash away the filth of dollars of
[1:44:04] Zion and shall purge the blood of
[1:44:05] Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
[1:44:07] spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
[1:44:09] burning and the Lord will create upon
[1:44:11] every dwelling place of Mount Zion and
[1:44:13] upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by
[1:44:15] day and the shining of a flaming fire by
[1:44:17] night fro upon all the glory shall be a
[1:44:20] defense all right now the Bible said
[1:44:29] they had wanton eyes that means
[1:44:31] wandering lustful flirt Falaise so can
[1:44:34] you picture them what are they they're
[1:44:35] modern-day harlots right modern-day
[1:44:38] prostitutes they're trying to tempt men
[1:44:39] with their eyes they're stretching out
[1:44:42] their necks they've got all kinds of
[1:44:44] jewelry on all kinds of all kinds of
[1:44:47] accessories on too much and they had
[1:44:49] prideful hearts look at us and see the
[1:44:51] whole time Isaiah was saying repent
[1:44:53] repent they had a prophet there just
[1:44:56] like we've had amen a prophet saying
[1:44:58] repent and they rejected the Prophet and
[1:45:00] they dress themselves up in their day of
[1:45:02] judgment just like Jezebel instead of
[1:45:06] humbling themselves in day their
[1:45:07] judgment they put more emphasis on the
[1:45:09] out words than the inward okay so nose
[1:45:14] rings
[1:45:14] so see nose rings you got a good one got
[1:45:16] a bad one see see how there's a balance
[1:45:19] there must be some area of Liberty then
[1:45:22] and there is but if someone walks in
[1:45:26] here with a nose ring I'm not going to
[1:45:27] say anything but if they ask me about it
[1:45:29] I'm gonna tell them this it was
[1:45:31] temporary it wasn't through the skin and
[1:45:33] did not shed blood it did not make a
[1:45:34] mark
[1:45:35] a pearly mark because God put permanent
[1:45:37] marks upon slaves that rejected freedom
[1:45:39] that's what God did and even God put a
[1:45:42] natural mark on Cain number that he said
[1:45:45] go out for the presence of Lord you're
[1:45:46] gonna be mark I can't bear this he said
[1:45:48] you gotta bear it anyway right he said
[1:45:51] you'll bear it we saw it let no man kill
[1:45:53] you any man that kills you
[1:45:54] you know you'll be cursed seven more
[1:45:55] times to see permanent marks on the skin
[1:46:00] and body are not usually a sign of
[1:46:02] righteousness okay there's my hour so
[1:46:05] I'll give me five minutes I'll just find
[1:46:07] a place to close necklaces and bracelets
[1:46:12] I got that earrings and then high heels
[1:46:16] and tattoos I got those left let's just
[1:46:22] do high heels since we're that let's
[1:46:23] just do that one okay Isaiah chapter
[1:46:25] three let's do that
[1:46:25] Isaiah 3:16 Moe over the Lord said
[1:46:30] because the daughters of Zion are
[1:46:32] haughty that means prideful that means
[1:46:36] they went their way instead of God's way
[1:46:38] their ideas and their passions are more
[1:46:40] important than God's Word and walk with
[1:46:44] stretched forth necks and wanton eyes
[1:46:47] flirting eyes walking and mincing that
[1:46:52] short steps mincing means short little
[1:46:54] steps and making a tinkling with their
[1:46:57] feet therefore the Lord will smite with
[1:47:01] a scab the crown of the head of the
[1:47:03] daughters of Zion and the Lord will
[1:47:05] discover their secret parts in the day
[1:47:08] the Lord will take away the bravery of
[1:47:10] their tinkling ornaments about their
[1:47:11] feet and that why women like to wear
[1:47:13] high heels makes them feel more powerful
[1:47:16] they're so powerful in their eye heels I
[1:47:19] know what happens at my school when I
[1:47:21] hear that walking down the hall I'm like
[1:47:23] Oh who's coming down now to talk to me
[1:47:26] because it in pot they feel empowered
[1:47:29] what do they feel they feel a lot manly
[1:47:32] they feel power because I make noise
[1:47:34] when I move and I'm somebody to be
[1:47:36] recognized and that's it that is the
[1:47:38] complete opposite of modesty modesty
[1:47:41] means pushing attention away
[1:47:43] that's totally immodest drawing
[1:47:46] attention to yourself
[1:47:49] now my shoes make noise when I walked
[1:47:52] down the hallway because they go squeak
[1:47:53] squeak squeak squeak squeak but it's not
[1:47:56] tinkle tinkle tinkle tinkle tinkle you
[1:47:58] look at me I've got power I'm somebody
[1:48:02] important I'm somebody special no you're
[1:48:03] not you're just like all the rest of us
[1:48:05] all right it's pride its pride and God
[1:48:11] said I'll judge you for that
[1:48:13] the pride now let me close with a few
[1:48:16] more thoughts on high heels so of course
[1:48:19] the words high heels are not in the
[1:48:20] scripture but clearly mincing is in
[1:48:24] Scripture which is what high heels
[1:48:25] produce and the stretched forth next I
[1:48:27] was looking at a few pictures from some
[1:48:29] medical journals online you can look up
[1:48:31] medical journals and they show how it
[1:48:33] makes women put their bottoms out their
[1:48:35] chest forward and it makes them stretch
[1:48:37] forth their neck that's exactly what it
[1:48:40] does Church and that's what scientists
[1:48:42] and researchers are discovering but God
[1:48:45] already told us about it thousand two
[1:48:46] thousand years ago three thousand years
[1:48:48] ago sorry three thousand years ago
[1:48:50] because the Bible said there's nothing
[1:48:52] new Under the Sun it's already been done
[1:48:55] it's just the same demons in a little
[1:48:57] different perversion it's the same exact
[1:49:00] thing now and I found
[1:49:09] articles and I talked to brother Scott
[1:49:11] Walker I don't know if he and his family
[1:49:12] are watching if they are god bless you
[1:49:14] but I called him on the phone I said
[1:49:15] brother you're a podiatrist so he knows
[1:49:18] all about the feet he's a foot doctor I
[1:49:20] said what do you know about high heels
[1:49:22] and just kind of paraphrase he said in
[1:49:25] every book I've read all the books say
[1:49:26] that it's the absolute worst thing a
[1:49:29] human can put on their feet and yet they
[1:49:34] still do it because they're insane
[1:49:38] they've got demons there they're
[1:49:41] destroying the body that God gave them
[1:49:43] and the articles I read said this they
[1:49:46] said high heels puts excess stress upon
[1:49:49] the foot bones and ultimately leads to a
[1:49:51] change in the musculoskeletal system if
[1:49:55] you wear them long enough now as
[1:49:57] watching a few youtube videos and these
[1:49:59] women were Jewish they converted their
[1:50:01] proselytes to Judaism and they were from
[1:50:04] Brooklyn they got these Brooklyn accents
[1:50:06] and every day and they're just rejoicing
[1:50:07] all my back doesn't hurt anymore because
[1:50:09] I stopped wearing high heels oh my legs
[1:50:12] don't hurt my ankles don't hurt anymore
[1:50:14] because I stopped wearing high heels
[1:50:16] you're damaging your own body because it
[1:50:20] throws off your center of gravity and
[1:50:23] then the second one I found was an
[1:50:26] article that proves that men are more
[1:50:29] attracted to women in high heels because
[1:50:32] of what it does it pushes out it changes
[1:50:34] it changes the curvature of your spine
[1:50:37] and it pushes out the bottom more and
[1:50:41] pushes out the front more and it
[1:50:44] stretches forth their necks it does that
[1:50:47] and then I think it was 85% of men from
[1:50:49] their study found a woman in high heels
[1:50:52] to be more attractive
[1:50:54] now that's an unconverted man right now
[1:50:58] the flesh of a man of course all the men
[1:51:01] know this your flesh is attracted to it
[1:51:03] but when you get down to your soul you
[1:51:04] say that person that woman's filled with
[1:51:06] demons she's trying to loves mother
[1:51:09] Graham said every program said every
[1:51:11] healthy red-blooded man when he sees a
[1:51:13] sexually dressed woman he said something
[1:51:16] passes over you and brother's you can
[1:51:17] say men but you don't have to you can't
[1:51:20] help it when a man sees a woman who's
[1:51:22] sexually attractive something
[1:51:23] passes over him because it's in his
[1:51:25] genes to do that he's made to reproduce
[1:51:27] by the RAM says that's what history
[1:51:30] that's what medical science says - he
[1:51:32] can't help it but brother have said you
[1:51:34] can help looking back a second time a
[1:51:36] man you can't help if I didn't mean to
[1:51:39] look at it but you can help the next
[1:51:41] time and that's where you need the power
[1:51:43] the Holy Spirit to look the other way
[1:51:45] and maokai witnessed the power of the
[1:51:47] Holy Spirit on memmer Monday maokai
[1:51:49] we're in the barber shop he's getting my
[1:51:51] old haircut off you know and we have a
[1:51:54] TV and there usually it's nice things
[1:51:55] but they had a news on and they showed
[1:51:58] two women doing sexual dances at a
[1:52:01] basketball game it was a dance-off now
[1:52:04] they're fully clothed maokai what did i
[1:52:06] do when that came on everybody starts
[1:52:08] laughing the whole barbershop what did i
[1:52:10] do I looked down and I got all serious
[1:52:14] because I knew if I looked at it I'd
[1:52:16] start laughing too because my flesh
[1:52:19] would instantly react to it I saw the
[1:52:23] first thing when they started dancing as
[1:52:24] soon as I saw it and I don't even know
[1:52:26] Malik I was looking at me
[1:52:27] I wasn't trying to put on for Malik I'm
[1:52:29] trying to be I knew it was wrong the
[1:52:31] Holy Spirit in me told me to put my head
[1:52:33] down they don't look at that see because
[1:52:38] I I've been around long enough I know if
[1:52:40] I look a second time or look a couple
[1:52:42] seconds I'm gonna laugh at it I'm gonna
[1:52:45] get attracted to it because it's sin
[1:52:47] that dwells inside Jesse Smith and I'm
[1:52:49] my own worst enemy I hate you but yet I
[1:52:52] love you there's times I hate and that
[1:52:55] was all the times I hate you hombre I'm
[1:52:58] bringing you under subjection put your
[1:53:01] head down and I did and I'm so happy I
[1:53:04] didn't even know maokai was watching me
[1:53:06] but I got the car he said daddy I saw
[1:53:08] how you put your head down I just said
[1:53:09] thank you Jesus
[1:53:10] see because Christ lives the life if
[1:53:14] you've got Christ in you you live the
[1:53:16] life all the men are laughing the women
[1:53:18] are laughing they're all laughing and
[1:53:19] then it got real quiet because I think I
[1:53:21] think they saw me put my head down and
[1:53:22] the woman women cut my hair changed the
[1:53:25] subject he said oh oh so how did your
[1:53:27] preaching trip go down in North Carolina
[1:53:29] and he got real quiet out of that you
[1:53:33] see because Christ wants the Holy Ghost
[1:53:35] to be on display wherever
[1:53:37] you go you're the only Christ that
[1:53:39] people are gonna see let's say on our
[1:53:42] feet here by God's grace so high heels
[1:53:46] should be avoided get and get shoes that
[1:53:49] have the least amount of heat on them
[1:53:51] here's mine that's the most I'm gonna do
[1:53:54] right there men to women get the lowest
[1:53:57] heel you can possibly get because it's
[1:54:00] gonna help you physically and
[1:54:01] spiritually the higher you are the more
[1:54:04] likely that spirit can get on you of
[1:54:07] what pride of drawing attention to
[1:54:10] myself and you're gonna hurt your body
[1:54:12] at the same time the temple the Holy
[1:54:15] Ghost every love the Lord it's kind of
[1:54:22] one of the I'm done that's sin I want
[1:54:29] you understand Church this is all
[1:54:30] written this is all spoken and this is
[1:54:32] all written with the love of God you
[1:54:36] know I've read a few books coming up
[1:54:37] buddy I wrote a few books on this
[1:54:39] subject and like I said what I love
[1:54:41] about the message and brother brands
[1:54:43] message is that it always went back to
[1:54:46] the Bible and I've showed you just a few
[1:54:48] topics I didn't get to earrings I didn't
[1:54:51] get to tattoos and I didn't get to know
[1:54:59] maybe that was it Oh necklaces embraces
[1:55:03] I didn't get to that but there's a
[1:55:05] balance on those there's a balance on
[1:55:08] those the by you know the Bible said in
[1:55:10] Proverbs that let the let the grace of
[1:55:12] God but I'm sorry keep the instructions
[1:55:16] your mother and father and I said let
[1:55:17] them hang upon your neck as a necklace
[1:55:19] unto the Lord God uses the necklace as a
[1:55:23] sign of grace this is a sign that the
[1:55:26] grace of God is upon me I am honoring my
[1:55:29] mother and my father
[1:55:32] so Burnham says if your husband got you
[1:55:34] a little necklace you wanna wear
[1:55:35] necklace he said that's okay you see
[1:55:38] don't you love how God balance the word
[1:55:40] for us it's such a beautiful balance
[1:55:42] it's such a bails and our absolute is
[1:55:46] the scripture
[1:55:51] as we pray here just think about your
[1:55:53] life I think some of the most important
[1:55:55] things for us church is this we don't
[1:55:57] judge other people don't judge other
[1:56:00] people just thank God that they're
[1:56:01] serving God if it's one of these areas
[1:56:04] of Liberty the next thing is judge
[1:56:06] yourself make sure you're not causing a
[1:56:09] weaker Christian to stumble is that
[1:56:13] helped by God's grace and whatever you
[1:56:16] do take it back to the word take it
[1:56:18] right back to the word that's your word
[1:56:20] test that's the absolute is the Word of
[1:56:22] God and I think we'll be all right by
[1:56:25] the grace of the Lord I want people to
[1:56:28] be saved because of my life not perish
[1:56:30] because of my liberties because I don't
[1:56:33] understand how to you know strengthen
[1:56:34] people or things like that
[1:56:36] I want to strengthen people all the time
[1:56:38] I don't want to make people weaker I
