[19:41] forward to hearing the testimony so

[20:33] anything like that but those are the
[20:35] three prayer requests or anything else
[20:36] that the Saints need prayer for tonight
[20:39] NEADS tonight anything we're forgetting
[20:42] okay nothing remember oh yes sir I saw
[20:45] my brother-in-law Dustin Sammy just keep
[20:48] him in prayer and he said he said don't

[21:10] day before I got hurt he said honey I
[21:11] need four to six months off just to have
[21:14] some time off and then he got hurt the
[21:16] next day the doctor said you have six
[21:17] months off now here gonna be in a
[21:18] wheelchair so he said he said he
[21:20] believed that was an answer to prayer
[21:22] because his his is a employer was
[21:25] working him to death he said and he just
[21:27] wanted some time off with the family so
[21:29] he said be careful what you asked for
[21:31] that's what he told me so we must be

[35:07] Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord
[35:09] God where your love is there is no fear
[35:11] Lord God for perfect love casts out all
[35:15] fear or take this moment tonight Lord
[35:18] God and the greatness of your power and
[35:20] your glory Lord yet Lord the Bible said
[35:24] to be the foolishness of preaching to
[35:26] save them that believe Lord so let the

[35:30] through the power of the Holy Spirit
[35:31] dear God and Lord just break your word
[35:34] to your people father may each one of us

[35:48] able Lord God so help us to be willing
[35:51] Lord and help us to be listening Lord

[35:56] help us to believe with faith in our
[35:58] hearts Lord Jesus guide us Lord you said
[36:01] you guide us into all truth we trust you
[36:03] to do that tonight Lord bless your
[36:04] people for coming out
[36:05] Lord physically to the house of God
[36:07] tonight be with those livestreaming Lord
[36:09] in different places may they sense your
[36:11] presence may they focus on You Lord God
[36:14] may they meditate upon the promises Lord
[36:16] and may you give them what they have
[36:18] need of tonight Lord God will not leave
[36:19] empty for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[36:22] name and the church said Amen god bless
[36:25] you be and see the praise guy look at
[36:31] different direction than we went on
[36:32] Sunday morning I was real blessed to see
[36:35] different people encouraged by the
[36:38] message Sunday that really blessed me
[36:40] I'd like to take this thought though
[36:41] Jesus always said fear not that's my
[36:43] topic Jesus always said fear not
[36:47] that's my topic tonight the prophet of
[36:49] God said that in testimony in Los
[36:52] Angeles Jesus always said fear not do
[36:57] not fear
[36:59] if you do then God can't work with you
[37:02] if you do believe then God can work with
[37:06] you how many want God to work with them
[37:07] amen so one look at this thought here
[37:10] that's my subtopic as Jesus said always
[37:14] fear not amen
[37:17] so I felt kind of as I was studying and
[37:19] preparing I kind of felt led to go that
[37:20] direction we're gonna be reading a lot
[37:22] out of the Gospels tonight and look at
[37:25] the many times jesus said fear not and
[37:27] look at as we look at that look at every
[37:30] situation and see how it applies to our
[37:33] lives because we are constantly dealing
[37:35] with fear how many would raise your
[37:37] hands say I battle with fear often you
[37:40] know it's something natural that's
[37:42] inside of us you know the natural fear
[37:45] when something bad happens usually our
[37:47] our instinct inside of us is fear but
[37:49] there's such a thing called a spirit of
[37:51] fear which is a demonic power that can
[37:55] come upon someone and anoint them the
[37:57] Bible said people can give a place to
[37:59] the devil in their minds and they also
[38:02] can think of as fear and they become
[38:04] prisoners to fear that's all they can
[38:06] think of that's all they can experience
[38:09] is fear because the Bible said fear has
[38:12] torment and we don't want to be
[38:14] tormented we want to be free in Christ
[38:16] today praise God and Jesus offers us
[38:19] that freedom from fear if we're willing
[38:21] to believe his word amen
[38:23] so I want to look at this thought and we
[38:26] want to look at how fear is our greatest
[38:30] hindrance I want to read some quotations
[38:34] again from the prophet of God from
[38:35] brother Graham's quotes he said there
[38:38] has been the greatest thing that I found
[38:40] him unchristian people throughout the
[38:42] entire world has been fear they're
[38:46] always afraid when a little sickness try
[38:49] they're afraid next he says one of the
[38:56] greatest curses on the church today is
[38:58] fear everybody's scared to death it's
[39:02] always what's going to happen who it's
[39:05] gonna happen to what's going to happen
[39:07] but Jesus said when the fearful sights
[39:09] come lift up your head and rejoice for
[39:12] your Redemption draweth nigh amen the
[39:17] Prophet said again the greatest thing
[39:19] that I find against the church tonight
[39:20] is fear everybody's scared to death
[39:23] about something but he says what are you
[39:26] scared about if a man's born again he
[39:28] should be happy and carefree and singing
[39:32] up here and testifying back there amen
[39:35] how many how many like the walk around
[39:38] their house singing and testifying of
[39:40] the Lord you've got to create the
[39:42] atmosphere of faith in our homes you
[39:45] know it's been neat to see what we've
[39:46] been doing the youth group with the kids
[39:47] and it's been neat to see each week they
[39:49] get caught somehow singing to God while
[39:51] they're cleaning their room or singing
[39:53] to God while they're passing out the
[39:55] clothes or the laundry it's the need to
[39:58] see how each child is able if they can
[40:00] get in the channel of God to create the
[40:03] right atmosphere and children does it
[40:05] make a difference in your lives when
[40:06] you're singing does it make a difference
[40:07] you feel different don't you and your
[40:09] singing God's praise and you have faith
[40:11] in God's Word it creates the right
[40:13] atmosphere we don't want to create the
[40:15] spirit of fear it allow them to come
[40:17] upon us we want to create the atmosphere
[40:18] of faith around us amen you know Sunday
[40:21] night after church I went home and I
[40:23] started getting some burping I was
[40:24] constantly burping and it's that feeling
[40:26] I get when I'm gonna throw up and I
[40:29] feels feeling awful but I was also
[40:30] having a burden for a certain but I knew
[40:33] was struggling so I went up to my room
[40:34] and I was just praying on my knees and I
[40:38] just kept burping and I thought I don't
[40:39] like this I feel like I'm gonna get sick
[40:40] and something faith just rose up inside
[40:44] of me and I just spoke to that sickness
[40:46] and I said in the name of Jesus Christ
[40:48] I'm just sitting there praying on my bed
[40:49] you know my knees I just said and the
[40:52] name of Jesus Christ I command this
[40:53] sickness to leave and I just started
[40:56] giving God glory just you know whisper
[40:58] and saying thank you Jesus I know you're
[40:59] gonna touch me I know and I was I wasn't
[41:01] planning on doing that it just kind
[41:03] came to me and God is my witness within
[41:05] a matter of five or ten or fifteen
[41:07] minutes all the pain and left and I've
[41:09] been burping for a while like a couple
[41:11] hours I'm thinking oh here we go I'm
[41:12] gonna get sick I don't want to throw up
[41:14] I don't want to get sick the kids just
[41:15] got over it a few weeks ago and I some
[41:17] just came upon me to speak the word and
[41:19] within a matter of minutes God took over
[41:21] so that's my testimony of hearing the
[41:24] Word of God and and remembering I'm not
[41:26] to fear to get sick I'm to have faith
[41:28] against that and I spoke the word
[41:30] against it and I just this week
[41:32] experiencing the power of the word how
[41:35] many know there's life and speaking the
[41:36] Word of God we there's power of life and
[41:39] death in the tongue so I was so stirred
[41:41] up from Sunday that I went home and that
[41:43] sickness couldn't get to me because of
[41:45] God's Word and I'm so grateful for that
[41:47] I just want to make sure I testify to
[41:49] that and give God the glory amen
[41:52] very thankful for God's mercy praise the
[41:55] Lord I want to read a few more quotes
[41:57] about how fear is such a great hindrance
[42:03] let me let's look at a few more here by
[42:05] the grace of the Lord he says this we
[42:14] find out over the world there's a great
[42:16] fear setting among all the peoples in
[42:19] this Atomic Age when it's just ready for
[42:23] anything to happen so here's the thought
[42:26] of the Atomic Age and how many ever hear
[42:28] about North Korea you hear about North
[42:29] Korean almost every week on on the news
[42:31] how they might get a missile a few years
[42:33] ago you remember it was Iran the prime
[42:36] minister of Iran well he's got a nuclear
[42:38] he's got a nuclear and so there's all
[42:40] these things that Satan uses to try to
[42:43] get people to be afraid and get them to
[42:46] fear and those can be uh those can be
[42:49] real dangers but we've got to put all of
[42:52] our faith and confidence in God's grace
[42:54] and in God's power we can't let
[42:56] ourselves get fearful we must be full of
[42:59] faith amen
[43:01] we must not let fear bring us down now
[43:09] what to read another here by the grace
[43:10] of Lord
[43:14] he said all the nations are scared to
[43:16] death there's they said there's some
[43:20] atomic bomb somewhere we know science
[43:23] has developed mechanical things at any
[43:24] moment without warning the whole world
[43:26] can go to pieces and the world is scared
[43:29] but he says I'm not scared of the world
[43:32] going to pieces there's going to be a
[43:34] thousand year millennial reign after all
[43:37] of this is over so God's Word cannot be
[43:40] defeated people are scared about the
[43:42] world blowing up or the world being
[43:44] destroyed that's impossible because the
[43:46] Bible said God is gonna burn it over
[43:47] with fire and then started anew and then
[43:50] have a thousand years of peace after the
[43:52] tribulation so God's Word cannot be
[43:54] defeated people create all these mount
[43:57] in the fearful images well we have to
[43:59] all fly to Mars or we have to all do all
[44:01] these things but the Bible never says
[44:02] that the Bible says we're gonna live on
[44:04] the earth in a period of peace where the
[44:07] lion lies down with the lamb praise God
[44:10] where the children will lead a serpent
[44:12] the Bible said America likes to catch
[44:14] him but in the but when Jesus restores
[44:18] all things he'll lead the Bible said the
[44:20] general lead the Serpent's with the
[44:22] string or with a leash they'll lead the
[44:24] Serpent's around and there'll be no hurt
[44:25] the Bible said they will not destroy or
[44:28] hurt in all my holy mountain God is
[44:31] gonna restore this earth he's gonna
[44:32] renovate this earth but people are
[44:35] scared of things that aren't even
[44:36] possible according to God's Word aren't
[44:39] you glad you know God's Word amen people
[44:41] fearing about all these things happening
[44:43] if they would just look to the Bible the
[44:45] Bible tells us the end the Bible tells
[44:47] us how this world finishes and we're
[44:49] glad to know it amen and we want to
[44:51] share it with all those we can share
[44:52] with all those that have a heart to hear
[44:54] we want to share it with them now he
[44:57] says this again in this is in Waterloo
[45:00] Iowa he says this we find this great day
[45:05] that we're living one of the most
[45:06] blessed days of all the times for those
[45:09] who are ready to meet God so how many
[45:13] ready to meet God if you're ready to
[45:15] meet God it's one of the most blessed
[45:16] days to live in he said but it's one of
[45:19] the most fearful and dreadful hours
[45:22] facing the unbeliever his destruction at
[45:26] and so this is the day where it's the
[45:30] most blessed hour if you're a Christian
[45:32] what's the most fearful hour if you're
[45:34] an unbeliever so the world is going to
[45:37] be afraid but we're not to be afraid
[45:39] we're to have hope in the Lord now let's
[45:41] go back to Revelation 21 verse 8 I want
[45:44] to revisit this scripture from Sunday we
[45:46] looked at this scripture on Sunday
[45:48] morning I want to revisit this
[45:49] revelation 21:8 and this is fully backed
[45:54] up by Scripture I you know even
[45:55] preparing today I found a lot more
[45:56] scriptures that can support this this
[46:01] thought that we looked at on Sunday
[46:02] morning remember jesus said that
[46:04] somebody can be lost by just this
[46:06] obeying one command that's what Jesus
[46:08] said about the rich young ruler he kept
[46:09] all the commands but he told the rich
[46:11] young ruler go your way sell everything
[46:13] that you have and come and follow me he
[46:15] turned it down and the Bible said later
[46:17] that he was lost right the Bible says
[46:20] that for later on he built all the big
[46:24] barns and everything like that and then
[46:26] the Bible said later he was caught and
[46:28] he went down to hell so he just
[46:30] disobeyed one word he loved though
[46:32] pleasures of the world he loved money
[46:34] more than he loved God and because of
[46:37] that it kept him from being saved
[46:38] because he served Mammon rather than
[46:41] rather than serving God
[46:42] revelation 21:8 let's look at that
[46:44] scripture again I just read verse 7
[46:47] because it's a great promise to you and
[46:48] I he that overcometh shall inherit all
[46:51] things and I will be as God and he shall
[46:55] be my son but the fearful the
[46:59] unbelieving the abominable the murderers
[47:01] the whoremongers and sorcerers and
[47:04] idolaters and all Liars shall have their
[47:07] part in the lake which burns with fire
[47:09] and brimstone which is the second death
[47:12] how many feel that's a pretty serious
[47:14] Scripture my goodness someone can go
[47:19] sadly someone will go to hell because
[47:22] they're just fearful because they let
[47:24] that sin overtake them and they choose
[47:27] to serve fearfulness and obey
[47:29] fearfulness rather than accepting the
[47:30] grace of Jesus Christ that's right jesus
[47:34] said they will he said I've come that
[47:36] you might have life here let's go that
[47:38] let's go to John chapter 3 verse 16 we
[47:40] all know
[47:40] John 3:16 but afterwards Jesus said many
[47:44] will not come to him because they loved
[47:46] the world more than they loved the Word
[47:48] of God so we must love the word more
[47:52] than we love anything else John 3:16
[47:56] this is the famous scripture for God so
[47:59] loved the world that He gave His only
[48:01] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[48:02] him should not perish but have
[48:04] everlasting life now now Jesus goes on
[48:07] to show what belief in God actually
[48:08] looks like for God sent not his son into
[48:11] the world to condemn the world but that
[48:14] the world through him might be saved he
[48:17] that believeth on him is not condemned
[48:19] but he that believeth not is condemned
[48:21] already because he hath not believed in
[48:23] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[48:26] now here's verse 19 and this is the
[48:29] condemnation so we're going to people be
[48:31] condemned and go to hell this is the
[48:33] condemnation that light is come into the
[48:36] world and men love darkness rather than
[48:39] light because their deeds were evil and
[48:43] everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[48:45] light neither cometh to the light lest
[48:46] his deeds should be reproved but he that
[48:50] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[48:52] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[48:55] wrought in God praise the Lord don't you
[48:59] love that look at the promise of God
[49:00] Jesus said the reason people will go to
[49:02] hell is that they love the pleasures of
[49:04] the world more than they love God we
[49:08] must love God with all of our heart soul
[49:10] mind and strength amen
[49:12] we've got to make sure we love God with
[49:15] all that we have and leave no doubt to
[49:18] anyone that we love God more than
[49:20] everything else hallelujah now so see
[49:25] people can fall in love with fear more
[49:28] than they fall in love with God
[49:29] and how does that possible the Bible
[49:32] said they're so they'll serve fear more
[49:34] than they'll serve God you see it all
[49:37] the time with with drugs you know you
[49:41] see people you see drugs take people
[49:42] down in the road why you know why would
[49:45] they choose to do that they choose to
[49:47] serving drug they're choosing to serve
[49:49] drugs more than they serve the Word of
[49:50] God let me know God's word has power to
[49:53] deliver from drugs I mean
[49:54] that I've been delivered from numerous
[49:56] addictions different drugs God has
[49:58] delivered me from that you can use
[50:01] another one like greed people choose to
[50:04] serve money rather than serve God so if
[50:07] the Bible says something though they'll
[50:09] reject what the Bible said and they'll
[50:10] choose rather to make more money that's
[50:12] serving money and loving money more than
[50:15] serving God right just like drugs or
[50:18] alcohol relationships you can put any
[50:20] sit in there anything that makes someone
[50:23] a disobey God's Word can cause them to
[50:28] be lost and Jesus said that they won't
[50:30] come to the light because they love sin
[50:32] more they love righteousness amen I hope
[50:36] that's just painting a clearer picture
[50:37] for us tonight by the grace of God we
[50:40] must love to come to the light huh me
[50:42] love to repent huh me love to feel clean
[50:44] before God huh me love to come and and
[50:46] draw closer to God and feel like you're
[50:49] forgiven amen
[50:50] it's such a great feeling to feel
[50:52] forgiven to feel clean to know that you
[50:54] confess all your sin you've left the sin
[50:57] behind in your life and you're moving
[50:58] forward in Christ Jesus amen that's a
[51:01] Watts called walking in faith a man
[51:03] walking in the spirit
[51:04] hallelujah now that's uh I just
[51:07] something I want to lay down there by
[51:09] the grace of the Lord now the Prophet
[51:12] says this as well brother Ram said this
[51:17] he said everything is don't fear he said
[51:22] Jesus always said fear not let struck me
[51:25] when I heard that that Wow
[51:26] Jesus constantly said fear not and I
[51:29] knew angels always said fear not there's
[51:31] 71 scriptures that say fear not in the
[51:33] Bible angels always say fear not and
[51:36] Jesus was constantly telling the Saints
[51:38] to not fear and so brother Ram just kind
[51:41] of he gives us an overview and says
[51:43] everything is don't fear how many can
[51:47] relate to that in every trial of your
[51:49] life many times it'll come down to just
[51:51] not fearing because you have to you and
[51:54] I can't deliver ourselves from Satan's
[51:56] traps but it's God who's going to
[51:58] deliver us and so we must wait for God
[52:01] to deliver us I'm understanding that you
[52:03] know if you're sick you must wait for
[52:04] God to heal you praise the Lord so
[52:07] everything revolves around this thought
[52:09] of everything is don't fear everything
[52:11] is believed in every trial we must
[52:14] believe hallelujah because fear really
[52:18] is unbelief it's a form
[52:20] it's unbelief we're scared gods I got to
[52:22] keep his word now let's start going
[52:25] through the scriptures now I tried to
[52:26] put these in order of Jesus's ministry
[52:29] the best that I could but I was going
[52:30] you know Matthew Mark Luke and John
[52:32] trying to put these in order I did the
[52:34] best I can
[52:34] you got your Bibles go to Luke chapter 5
[52:36] this is the first time I can find Jesus
[52:39] saying fear not it's right when he's
[52:41] calling his apostles his 12 apostles
[52:44] Luke 5 verse 8 Luke 5 verse 8 now as we
[52:51] go through these stories compare it to
[52:55] your life compare it to where you are
[52:57] right now
[52:58] let's look at this you can also look
[53:00] back at your life and see well where has
[53:01] this ever happened in my life hey men
[53:03] hallelujah now this is the miracle of
[53:07] the draw of fishes when Jesus was first
[53:11] calling his disciples all right now this
[53:16] at the lake Jenna Sarah and verse 1
[53:19] Matthew 5 1 well let's go down to verse
[53:21] 4 Jesus was teaching the people on the
[53:24] ship now verse 4 now when he left
[53:26] speaking he said Simon launch out into
[53:27] the deep and let down your nets for a
[53:29] drop and Simon answering said under the
[53:32] mass under him master we have toiled all
[53:35] night and have taken nothing
[53:37] nevertheless at thy word I will let down
[53:40] the net never had a real hard night I'm
[53:44] not sleeping I've had a few not too many
[53:46] I know my wife said a lot of hard ones
[53:48] with the children long hard nights or
[53:51] I've had this many times I get up and
[53:53] there are certain stresses in the church
[53:55] or certain stretches stresses in the job
[53:58] or problems and I can't go back to bed
[54:00] it's 1 a.m. it's 2:30 3 4 I can't go
[54:03] back to bed because of the pressure and
[54:05] so Peters been up all night and he's
[54:09] washing the net saying well we had a
[54:10] hard night nothing game in and Jesus
[54:12] says we'll go back out they already came
[54:14] in and he says go back out it's kind
[54:17] like you get home from work and the Lord
[54:19] would say we'll go right back
[54:21] you're not done and it's hard for Peter
[54:24] and he says fine at your word Lord and
[54:27] that's a good lesson right there even
[54:29] we're at our weakest times
[54:30] let's obey God's Word he said
[54:33] nevertheless he said okay Lord at your
[54:35] word I'll believe it even when we're
[54:37] tired god help us to obey the Word of
[54:39] God now verse 6 you know the story when
[54:42] they done this they enclosed a great
[54:45] multitude of fishes and their net break
[54:47] and they beckoned on their partners
[54:49] which were in the other ship that they
[54:51] should come and help them and they came
[54:52] and filled both the ships so that they
[54:54] began to sink when Simon Peter saw it he
[54:58] fell down at Jesus knees saying depart
[55:00] from me for I am a sinful man Oh Lord
[55:03] look Peter recognizes I'm sinful just by
[55:07] doubting just by just by Oh bang with a
[55:12] bad attitude you can I say like that
[55:13] sometimes we obey we don't feel like it
[55:15] and Peter recognizes that as sin doesn't
[55:19] the Bible say we should have a cheerful
[55:20] attitude we should cheerfully obey the
[55:23] Word of God how many want to be cheerful
[55:26] when they obey the Word of God oh yes I
[55:28] want to when I hear the word I don't
[55:30] want to disagree with it
[55:31] or grumble under my breath and say well
[55:33] I guess I'll do this because the Bible
[55:35] said so god loves a cheerful obey her
[55:38] amen he loves a cheerful Giver
[55:39] he also loves someone that will
[55:41] cheerfully obey the Word of God that
[55:46] should help us church if we have to fit
[55:48] to have a bad attitude and grumble to
[55:49] obey God's Word god help us to humble
[55:51] ourselves god help us to humble
[55:54] ourselves now look at he says this verse
[55:58] 9 for he was astonished all that were
[56:00] with him at the draw the fishes which
[56:02] they had taken and so was also James and
[56:04] John the sons of Zebedee which were
[56:05] partners with Simon and Jesus sent Simon
[56:08] fear not from henceforth thou shalt
[56:11] catch men so this is interesting you
[56:15] know there they're all nervous you know
[56:16] their boats are gonna looks like their
[56:18] boats are gonna sing cuz they have such
[56:19] a blessing God has blessed their
[56:21] business so much but he tells Peter
[56:23] don't fear boys because you're not
[56:26] enough to worry about catching natural
[56:27] fish you're gonna be called for
[56:29] spiritual fish amen which is more
[56:32] valuable natural fish or spiritual fish
[56:34] we must win souls by God's grace amen
[56:38] this nation's been so down but there's
[56:40] still got to be somebody out there we're
[56:41] still here there's somebody we can
[56:43] witness to praise God let's have a heart
[56:45] to witness by God's grace now that's the
[56:48] first one now if you go down to verse 26
[56:51] they they come to the end of the day
[56:53] they've had they had and the Bible said
[56:56] they say we've had a strange day seeing
[56:59] all these miracles was a strange day
[57:00] verse 26 and they were all amazed and
[57:02] they glorified God and were filled with
[57:04] fear saying we have seen strange things
[57:06] today so the power of God brought a
[57:09] great fear upon them and verse 27 and
[57:14] after these things he went forth and saw
[57:16] public and named Levi sitting at the
[57:18] feet of customi sending them follow me
[57:20] so you see where this is that Jesus has
[57:23] to kind of put fear in the hearts of
[57:25] these apostles to show them that he's
[57:27] God and then they'll follow him see
[57:31] Jesus has to prove his power to them to
[57:34] convince them to leave everything and
[57:36] follow how about with you to God have to
[57:37] do that for you did he have to show you
[57:39] his power and his glory he and that's
[57:42] what we need Church the beginning of
[57:44] wisdom is what fear it's grace that
[57:47] taught our hearts to fear right and
[57:49] grace our fears relieved amen God needs
[57:54] someone that will fear him if he's to
[57:56] lead them if they don't fear God then it
[57:58] will do no good then they won't want to
[58:00] follow Jesus but we must fear God first
[58:03] and then follow in his word amen so see
[58:07] that he starts calling them one by one
[58:08] he's he's done son he's done a
[58:10] miraculous thing and he now has caused
[58:13] fear to come in their heart a good godly
[58:15] fear in their hearts that's the first
[58:18] time I could find Jesus saying fear not
[58:20] now go to Matthew 10 verse 16 here's the
[58:23] next time he's going to send out his
[58:27] apostles to preach two by two Matthew 10
[58:32] 19 I'm sorry ten sixteen parmie
[58:43] now put yourselves in their position
[58:45] you're gonna go out to buy to you and
[58:49] someone else are gonna go into a town
[58:50] that has never heard the gospel they've
[58:53] never heard that there's a prophet in
[58:55] Galilee but you're the one to introduce
[58:57] them and they've just done Pharisee or
[59:00] sad you see or Herodian they had never
[59:03] seen the power of God they've never
[59:05] heard about this rabbi but you're the
[59:07] one who's gonna bring the message of the
[59:10] hour to this this city right all the
[59:14] this is how Jesus sends them out and I
[59:16] look what he says in verse 16 behold I
[59:19] send you forth as sheep in the midst of
[59:20] wolves she's didn't beat around the bush
[59:24] he told them you're gonna be like sheep
[59:26] amongst wolves be therefore wise as
[59:31] serpents and harmless of doves then he
[59:34] tells me to watch out in verse 17 verse
[59:36] 17 said beware of men for they will
[59:40] deliver you up in the council's and they
[59:42] will scourge you in their synagogues
[59:43] who's usually Jesus biggest critics is
[59:46] that the sinners or the church members
[59:47] the church members who's the ones that
[59:50] crucified Jesus the church members right
[59:54] the Jews of his day were shouting
[59:56] crucify him crucify him
[59:57] and number pilot gets convinced well I
[1:00:00] better get I'm fearing the Jews I better
[1:00:01] give in and give them to Jesus
[1:00:03] it was the church members that killed
[1:00:05] Jesus right and the Bible said the mark
[1:00:09] of the beast at the end time will be a
[1:00:10] false Christian Church the Bible said to
[1:00:13] be a false Christian Church that'll
[1:00:15] deceive people and you cannot buy or
[1:00:18] sell so it's connected to your bank
[1:00:20] accounts right it's connected to the
[1:00:23] ability to buy groceries you cannot buy
[1:00:25] or sell without the mark of the beast
[1:00:26] right we know that that's parts the end
[1:00:30] time it's a false Christian religion
[1:00:32] that peoples of the world will be sucked
[1:00:34] into and will take the mark of the beast
[1:00:36] and we'll be damned by taking the mark
[1:00:38] of the beast so it's a false deception
[1:00:41] of churches right and what is that mark
[1:00:44] of the beast what 666 you remember that
[1:00:46] 666 is the title of the Roman Pope
[1:00:49] vicarious Phil I de remember that in
[1:00:52] Latin he's called Vaqueros Felidae which
[1:00:55] means instead of the son of
[1:00:57] and if you add up the caressed feel that
[1:00:59] day the Latin if you added up with the
[1:01:01] Roman numerals equals 666 so at some
[1:01:04] point the Pope of Rome will be the
[1:01:06] Antichrist and you can see it now
[1:01:08] because he exalts himself above the word
[1:01:10] his word is above the Word of God you
[1:01:15] say give me example well Jesse I love to
[1:01:16] the Pope said that we should pray to
[1:01:19] Mary and there's not one scripture in
[1:01:21] the Bible that says we should pray to
[1:01:22] Mary can anybody find one there's not
[1:01:24] one right the Pope says that we should
[1:01:27] pray to Mary I saw his tweet he said I
[1:01:29] remember I showed it to you if he makes
[1:01:30] it ever raised you're a few remember
[1:01:31] that didn't remember that okay the
[1:01:32] children okay you guys remember that the
[1:01:34] Pope said if you don't pray to Mary and
[1:01:35] if she's not your mother
[1:01:36] you're an orphan well there's nuts not
[1:01:38] in the entire Bible the Bible said we
[1:01:41] pray to one person who drew prayed to
[1:01:43] Christ the Bible said there's one
[1:01:45] mediator between God and man the man
[1:01:47] Christ Jesus and I've read the Catechism
[1:01:50] of the Catholic Church I've almost read
[1:01:51] all of it and they say when the Pope
[1:01:53] speaks from the seat of the Basilica of
[1:01:56] st. Peter's Basilica in Rome he's
[1:01:58] infallible right and so no matter what
[1:02:02] he says whether it's in the Bible or not
[1:02:03] whatever he says is his truth it's
[1:02:08] infallible it cannot fail and the Bible
[1:02:10] said the Antichrist will exalt himself
[1:02:12] above the word of God
[1:02:13] he'll send the Temple of God saying that
[1:02:15] He is God so church we must pray for
[1:02:18] people to come out of those systems the
[1:02:20] people aren't bad people but the system
[1:02:22] is a deceptive system that is if the
[1:02:25] system adds to the Word of God
[1:02:26] how many can say amen to that it adds to
[1:02:28] the Word of God it absolutely does
[1:02:30] remember the Catechism calls it calls
[1:02:33] Mary the mother of God and there's not
[1:02:35] one scripture in the Bible where Mary's
[1:02:36] called the mother of God it calls Mary
[1:02:39] the mediate ryx there's not one
[1:02:40] scripture in the Bible where it's called
[1:02:42] where she's called Mediatrix you see so
[1:02:45] this is what Jesus found out - jesus
[1:02:48] said beware of men for they will deliver
[1:02:51] you up to the council's it's going to be
[1:02:53] religious people that actually persecute
[1:02:56] the true Christian and the true
[1:02:58] Christian is one who believes the Word
[1:03:00] of God amen let's keep going verse 18
[1:03:03] and ye shall be brought before governors
[1:03:05] and the Kings for my sake for a
[1:03:07] testimony of them for the end the
[1:03:08] Gentiles but when they
[1:03:10] deliver you have take no thought how or
[1:03:13] what ye shall speak for it shall be
[1:03:15] given you in the same hour what ye shall
[1:03:17] speak you know I had this Sunday I had
[1:03:20] this happen to me Sunday somebody came
[1:03:23] by and was talking to me and I don't
[1:03:27] know if you saw I don't know who's out
[1:03:28] there
[1:03:28] somebody not in our church somebody just
[1:03:30] come by and said something awful about
[1:03:33] real loud in front of everybody about
[1:03:34] somebody else in our church and I was so
[1:03:37] shocked but I was still under the
[1:03:40] anointing of the Holy Spirit and they
[1:03:42] said this person is so awful this I said
[1:03:45] you want to go talk to him and I didn't
[1:03:47] even think about it the Holy Spirit just
[1:03:50] brought it right to me I said you want
[1:03:52] to go talk to him and the person got
[1:03:53] real quiet and then drove away shortly
[1:03:55] after they were this person was
[1:03:57] bad-mouthing someone in our church right
[1:03:59] in front of them and I didn't know what
[1:04:02] to say but the Holy Spirit brought it to
[1:04:04] me and I didn't laugh at it I didn't
[1:04:06] agree with her because that's gossip
[1:04:07] right that's bad-mouthing people that's
[1:04:09] hurting somebody's but I experienced
[1:04:11] this on Sunday
[1:04:12] this person badan out of somebody just a
[1:04:14] few feet away and I said you want to go
[1:04:16] talk to him right there oh and they said
[1:04:18] oh he's here I said he's right there I
[1:04:22] didn't agree with that gossip I didn't
[1:04:24] agree with that but the Lord gave me
[1:04:27] what to say in that hour and I
[1:04:28] appreciate that by God's grace I
[1:04:30] appreciate that it was so striking it
[1:04:32] just in churches just like that it just
[1:04:33] came out I didn't have to think about it
[1:04:35] just came out right because that's why
[1:04:37] that's why Jesus gave you the spirit
[1:04:39] it'll give you what to say in the hour
[1:04:42] you need aren't you thankful for the
[1:04:43] Holy Spirit hey then it'll give you what
[1:04:45] to say in that hour we're not to gossip
[1:04:47] we're not to swear we're not to speak
[1:04:49] evil we're not to fear and the Holy
[1:04:51] Spirit gives us the power not to do it
[1:04:53] Amen that's right Church Alleluia amen
[1:04:56] I love to see that happen in my life
[1:04:58] he's just like you we'd love to see it
[1:05:00] happen in our lives we can go under the
[1:05:02] anointing of the Holy Spirit how do you
[1:05:04] look at verse 24 it is not you that
[1:05:06] speaks but the Spirit of your father
[1:05:08] which speaks in you that's what we need
[1:05:10] more of God speaking through us now
[1:05:14] lugia verse 21 and the brother shall
[1:05:15] deliver up the brother to death and the
[1:05:17] father the child and the children shall
[1:05:19] rise against their parents and cause
[1:05:20] them to be put to death and you should
[1:05:23] be hated of all men for my
[1:05:24] namesake but he's an endure to the end
[1:05:26] shall be saved
[1:05:28] remember he's still talking to his
[1:05:30] disciples when they persecute you in
[1:05:33] this city flee to another so see Jesus
[1:05:36] and tell them to be martyrs did he at
[1:05:37] the beginning he told them to run from
[1:05:39] evil at the beginning his disciples he
[1:05:42] and say die you know give your lives as
[1:05:44] a sacrifice he said go to the next city
[1:05:46] they persecute you flee away in other
[1:05:49] words keep preaching the gospel amen
[1:05:51] I like that he should not have gone over
[1:05:54] the cities of Israel to the Son of Man
[1:05:56] become the disciple is not above his
[1:05:59] master nor the servant above is Lord it
[1:06:01] is enough for the disciple that he be as
[1:06:03] his master and the servant as his Lord
[1:06:05] if they have called the master of the
[1:06:07] house Beelzebub how much more shall they
[1:06:09] call them of his household and we saw
[1:06:13] this with Jesus right they call Jesus
[1:06:14] Beelzebub because of all the
[1:06:16] supernatural and so then they hated his
[1:06:18] disciples right because he was doing the
[1:06:21] same thing Jesus was now here's where
[1:06:24] does verse 26 fear them not therefore
[1:06:29] these are people that are going to kill
[1:06:31] the disciples right they're gonna kill
[1:06:34] them they're gonna try they're gonna
[1:06:35] drag them into courtrooms and Jesus said
[1:06:37] you're like sheep in the midst of wolves
[1:06:38] he said fear them not for there's
[1:06:42] nothing covered that shall be not
[1:06:44] revealed in here that should not be made
[1:06:45] known amen don't fear people try to
[1:06:49] speak evil against you if people would
[1:06:51] persecute you say evil for you against
[1:06:53] you as being a Christian jesus said fear
[1:06:55] them not how many appreciate our Lord
[1:06:58] amen remember our titles Jesus always
[1:07:01] said fear not before he sends out his
[1:07:04] preachers to these these religious
[1:07:06] people that are gonna hate the truth he
[1:07:08] knows they're gonna hate the truth he
[1:07:11] says be ready to run right be ready to
[1:07:14] run and don't fear the men you have to
[1:07:17] run but don't fear them keep preaching
[1:07:19] the Word of God hallelujah now I'm gonna
[1:07:22] go down to verse 28 Malachi and fear not
[1:07:25] them which kill the body but are not
[1:07:27] able to kill the soul but rather fear
[1:07:29] him which is able to destroy both soul
[1:07:31] and body in hell and this week I was
[1:07:35] watching more videos about Isis and I
[1:07:37] watched some pretty graphic
[1:07:38] videos I didn't know they're gonna be
[1:07:39] that graphic but it showed you know
[1:07:40] people being murdered by the the Isis
[1:07:43] and it just kind of struck my heart as I
[1:07:45] read this about about Jesus you know and
[1:07:48] what jesus told his disciples here we
[1:07:50] have Christians that are willingly dying
[1:07:51] today to Isis and they give their lives
[1:07:54] over and Jesus said fear not those who
[1:07:57] can kill your body because they can't
[1:07:59] touch your soul
[1:08:00] so I appreciate don't you appreciate
[1:08:02] that Christians my such rugged
[1:08:05] Christians of such pure faith they're
[1:08:07] able to give their lives over and die
[1:08:10] for the name of Jesus Christ because
[1:08:11] they're more scared of God than they are
[1:08:13] men but see their fear for God is not a
[1:08:16] UH it's not a bad fear it's a holy fear
[1:08:18] praise God and you see that you see and
[1:08:22] that's the kind of faith we want praise
[1:08:23] God our country doesn't have much
[1:08:25] religious persecution yet we know it's
[1:08:26] coming because the Bible said it will
[1:08:28] come but we don't have that yet but we
[1:08:31] should pray for those who are being
[1:08:33] persecuted for the Saints in Thailand in
[1:08:35] prison have you prayed for them have you
[1:08:37] prayed for the Saints in Iraq and Iran
[1:08:39] and Saudi Arabia that are in prisons we
[1:08:42] should be praying for those individuals
[1:08:44] but see Jesus says don't fear those who
[1:08:47] can destroy your body fear those who can
[1:08:50] or fear Him who can destroy your both
[1:08:51] your body and soul in Hell amen this is
[1:08:55] a great word for Jesus to give to his
[1:08:57] his disciples go to verse 29 Malachi if
[1:08:59] you can are not two sparrows sold for a
[1:09:02] farthing and one of them shall not fall
[1:09:06] on the ground without your father now
[1:09:11] this is a either 1/4 of a penny or 1/2
[1:09:14] of a cent depending on which time period
[1:09:17] are not two sparrows sold for a farthing
[1:09:20] a quarter of a penny or a half of a cent
[1:09:23] so the value of these sparrows are very
[1:09:26] little and G and God Jesus says God
[1:09:29] knows every time one of those bird dies
[1:09:30] and how much more valuable are you than
[1:09:34] those birds praise God look at verse 30
[1:09:37] but the very hairs of your head are all
[1:09:39] numbered
[1:09:41] Hawkins hallelujah he tells them don't
[1:09:43] fear
[1:09:44] I've even numbered the hairs of your
[1:09:46] head you're more valuable than the birds
[1:09:48] don't fear what man shall do to you
[1:09:51] first
[1:09:52] 32 therefore whosoever therefore shall
[1:09:55] confess me before him him will I confess
[1:09:57] also before my father which is in heaven
[1:10:01] Luca verse 34 think not that I am come
[1:10:04] to send peace on the earth I came not to
[1:10:06] send peace but a sword
[1:10:09] now what Jesus says I'm going to send
[1:10:11] this sword where does he send this sword
[1:10:13] the next verse tells us Malachi verse 35
[1:10:15] the next verse tells us for I am come to
[1:10:17] set a man against variance against his
[1:10:19] father and the daughter against his her
[1:10:22] mother and the daughter in law against
[1:10:24] her mother-in-law so Jesus says when the
[1:10:27] real gospel comes it will sometimes
[1:10:28] divide families but we must stay with
[1:10:31] Christ in his word amen we must stand
[1:10:34] with Christ more than father more than
[1:10:37] mother more than brother sister we must
[1:10:39] stand with Jesus Christ that's the sword
[1:10:41] that's going to come but we must love
[1:10:45] Christ more than anything else that's
[1:10:48] right verse 36 a man's foes shall be
[1:10:52] they of his own household jesus said
[1:10:54] this is what you're gonna cause you know
[1:10:57] and as a man that's hard to do right you
[1:11:00] know and I'm when we seen you know the
[1:11:02] yang family come in you know and we sing
[1:11:05] the grand family come in and to come
[1:11:07] into the Word of God you know in this
[1:11:09] day it's hard when families are torn
[1:11:11] apart but jesus said that has to happen
[1:11:13] the word is going to cause that and it's
[1:11:17] not it's not really to divide families
[1:11:19] as it is to unite the family of God amen
[1:11:22] that's what's actually happening when
[1:11:24] when some people won't believe and
[1:11:26] others will believe those that are
[1:11:27] believing actually being United to the
[1:11:29] body of Christ amen
[1:11:30] they're being united to Christ and this
[1:11:33] is the sword that Jesus said that was
[1:11:35] going to come when these two by two
[1:11:37] preachers go to every city there have to
[1:11:39] divide houses and those that will
[1:11:43] believe shall be saved
[1:11:45] amen now I don't want to finish there's
[1:11:48] a lot going on in this chapter but I
[1:11:49] want to skip to the next one let's go to
[1:11:52] Matthew 14 22 let's skip ahead to this
[1:11:53] one I just thought I'd spend more time
[1:11:56] on that one because that was really
[1:11:57] there's some really striking things in
[1:11:59] there I want to make sure I preached
[1:12:02] most of them you heard but I just want
[1:12:04] to bring it make it a refresher to you
[1:12:06] Matthew 14 22 we're looking at fears
[1:12:10] Jesus always said fear not constantly
[1:12:14] saying fear not before he sends out his
[1:12:16] disciples he says fear not now here this
[1:12:18] is Jesus walking on the water where
[1:12:21] Peter walked on the water
[1:12:23] 14:22 most of us know the story Jesus
[1:12:27] sends his disciples across the sea and
[1:12:29] said I'll catch up to you later I'm
[1:12:31] gonna go in the mountain and pray right
[1:12:33] but then in verse 24 the waves begin to
[1:12:37] be tossed there's a great storm verse 25
[1:12:40] jesus comes in the fourth watch of the
[1:12:42] night which remember would have been
[1:12:44] let's see 6 to 9 would've been the first
[1:12:46] watched nine to twelve would've been the
[1:12:47] second watch 12 to three would have been
[1:12:50] the third watch so this is sometime
[1:12:52] between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. in the morning
[1:12:54] they're rowing and I've never done that
[1:12:58] I've never gone on the boat at 3 a.m. in
[1:12:59] the morning but these disciples are out
[1:13:01] at 3 am sometime between 3:00 a.m. and
[1:13:03] 6:00 a.m. the last watch of the night
[1:13:06] it's real dark at that time isn't it
[1:13:08] real dark on the waters and the storm
[1:13:10] picks up and they don't have Jesus but
[1:13:14] in the fourth watch Jesus went out unto
[1:13:17] them walking on the sea between 3 and 6
[1:13:20] in the morning when the disciples saw
[1:13:22] him walking on the sea they were
[1:13:23] troubled saying it is a spirit and they
[1:13:25] cried out in fear so they see a man
[1:13:28] walking to them on the water and they're
[1:13:29] scared all it's a spirit it's a ghost
[1:13:31] it's a ghost verse 27 but straightway
[1:13:35] Jesus spake of them saying be of good
[1:13:37] cheer it is I be not afraid
[1:13:41] amen so in the very early morning hours
[1:13:45] when they're perplexed with fear thou
[1:13:48] lictors they have to twofold of fear
[1:13:50] they're fearful of the storm but they're
[1:13:52] also fearful of this body walking
[1:13:55] towards them but Jesus speaks the word
[1:13:58] and said be not afraid he said be of
[1:14:01] good cheer hallelujah it is I amen verse
[1:14:07] 28 and Peter answered him and said lord
[1:14:08] if it be if it be thou bid me come upon
[1:14:12] the water and he said come now look how
[1:14:14] quickly this is a good example for us
[1:14:16] look how quickly we can shift from being
[1:14:18] scared to
[1:14:20] the faith from scared to being full of
[1:14:22] faith look how quickly Peter before
[1:14:24] Jesus comes is all scared but when Jesus
[1:14:27] gets there now he's full of faith you
[1:14:28] ever experience the the back and forth
[1:14:31] nature of being a human being first
[1:14:34] you're scared and you're full of faith
[1:14:36] he starts walking on the water full of
[1:14:39] faith and the Bible said when he saw the
[1:14:41] wind boisterous in verse 30 he was
[1:14:44] afraid and beginning to sink he cried
[1:14:46] saying lord save me and immediately
[1:14:50] Jesus stretched forth his hand and
[1:14:52] caught him and sent him oh though of
[1:14:53] little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
[1:14:57] and when they were coming to the ship
[1:14:59] the wind ceased now that's a good lesson
[1:15:00] for us right instead of being tossed to
[1:15:05] and fro like sea his faith was tossed he
[1:15:08] was first scared and then he's got faith
[1:15:10] and then he starts doubting instead of
[1:15:13] being tossed back and forth we must be
[1:15:15] fully persuaded amen
[1:15:17] we must keep the faith we must keep the
[1:15:19] the confession praise God we must not
[1:15:23] doubt what we've already heard the Lord
[1:15:25] say and how many like to read your Bible
[1:15:27] hear what the Lord tells you amen you
[1:15:29] can read the Bible and hear the same
[1:15:31] voice of the Holy Spirit speak just like
[1:15:33] Peter did amen
[1:15:34] and it can speak to your life today
[1:15:36] hallelujah it can speak but we must obey
[1:15:40] it we must not doubt it we must have
[1:15:41] faith in the promised Word of God amen
[1:15:46] alright that's the next time that's
[1:15:48] that's the third time so we've did the
[1:15:51] miracle with the fish we've done the
[1:15:53] sending out of the twelve and Peter
[1:15:55] walking on water the next one is a girl
[1:15:58] being raised from the dead in let's go
[1:16:02] to Luke 8:50 they have of course two
[1:16:04] parallel passages which means they have
[1:16:06] the same story in different books of the
[1:16:08] Gospels Jerry says daughter raised from
[1:16:12] the dead we just listened to it on
[1:16:13] Lamplighter yesterday yesterday on our
[1:16:15] drive home we listened to Titus comrade
[1:16:18] of the cross on the way home that was a
[1:16:20] beautiful story I just caught the end of
[1:16:22] exhausts and there's something else on
[1:16:23] the drive home but in the story you know
[1:16:26] the story Jarius you know his daughter
[1:16:28] dies he goes to Jesus and begs Jesus
[1:16:31] that Jesus comes to his home
[1:16:34] now you remember the story jesus walks
[1:16:36] in and everybody's crying and moaning
[1:16:37] and he said aw Jairus she's dead and
[1:16:40] Jesus looks and says she's just sleeping
[1:16:42] and they start laughing him to scorn and
[1:16:45] Jesus said get these people out of here
[1:16:47] praise God Jesus knows this girl's not
[1:16:50] gonna rise from the dead if people are
[1:16:52] fearful and afraid so he's got a kick
[1:16:55] out nice as we can say it Jesus has to
[1:16:58] kick out the unbelievers the people that
[1:17:01] won't believe he's got to kick them out
[1:17:04] and say get them out Jairus we only want
[1:17:06] believers in here amen
[1:17:07] sometimes God has to do that for us amen
[1:17:10] sometimes there's times people won't
[1:17:11] come to church or there's people that
[1:17:13] maybe leave early sometimes there's a
[1:17:15] reason for that and sometimes not every
[1:17:17] time but sometimes it's to make sure
[1:17:19] there's only people here that have faith
[1:17:21] amen because doubt would have hindered
[1:17:24] this woman from raising from the dead
[1:17:26] that's like when I told you the story
[1:17:27] when my grandpa prayed for his wife my
[1:17:30] grandmother Julia and she raised from
[1:17:32] the dead at the Wasi on Fulton County
[1:17:33] Hospital he only had the doctor in there
[1:17:37] him his pastor and a deacon there was
[1:17:40] only four people in there and the doctor
[1:17:41] agreed to pray with them the doctor
[1:17:44] bowed his head and prayed I think that
[1:17:45] was a night I don't remember in 1968 or
[1:17:47] and I remember what year that was but my
[1:17:49] Uncle Roger had just been born and my
[1:17:53] grandmother Julia died and they all had
[1:17:55] to agree in prayer
[1:17:56] there was nobody down there they didn't
[1:17:57] believe everybody believed and my
[1:17:59] grandfather said the pastor they just
[1:18:01] joined hands and prayed they touched her
[1:18:02] body in five minutes you know it started
[1:18:04] to get a little warm in a few more
[1:18:06] minutes she was breathing a few more
[1:18:09] minutes she was up and she was awake and
[1:18:11] my grandfather spent the rest of his
[1:18:13] life saying Oh hallelujah
[1:18:15] has a Spanish dialect you know he'd say
[1:18:17] how do you think of Jesus you know God
[1:18:19] raised my wife from the dead and he told
[1:18:21] that testimony everywhere he went
[1:18:23] amen that God still raises people from
[1:18:27] the dead but see you can't have unbelief
[1:18:28] there you've got to have faith there the
[1:18:31] first time I cast out demons in South
[1:18:33] America remember the story I told it I
[1:18:34] was all scared but then something
[1:18:36] dropped down from heaven I felt it come
[1:18:37] upon me I just felt something coming
[1:18:39] upon me and it said love casts out
[1:18:41] demons and at that moment I was no
[1:18:44] longer scared this woman was just
[1:18:45] staring straight ahead and talking like
[1:18:47] a
[1:18:47] come on zombie or something like that
[1:18:49] and I looked at her and I talked to
[1:18:51] these brothers I said there's too many
[1:18:53] there's all these kids they're all kind
[1:18:54] of scared as teenagers looking at us all
[1:18:56] kind of scared like oh the preachers
[1:18:57] gonna try to cast out the demon and you
[1:18:59] know I noticed that so know what I did I
[1:19:01] told her I told two other people and a
[1:19:03] pastor I said let's take her behind this
[1:19:05] house and let's go pray for let's get
[1:19:07] away from the crowd amen
[1:19:10] I just had such something came down upon
[1:19:13] me it was the Holy Spirit I know that it
[1:19:15] can I know that now and I had I said
[1:19:18] there's no way we're gonna be able to
[1:19:19] pray for this Dina possessed girl she's
[1:19:20] a stairs right ahead and making noises
[1:19:22] and could hardly talk and understand her
[1:19:24] we had to take her behind the house and
[1:19:26] this and God is my witness we join hands
[1:19:29] and I said let's pray for this demon to
[1:19:32] leave and as soon as I said that she
[1:19:34] started kicking and fighting all those
[1:19:36] things I just bowed my head I prayed in
[1:19:37] the name of Jesus Christ say in the
[1:19:40] blood of Jesus Christ is against you
[1:19:41] this is God's God's daughter she started
[1:19:43] screaming and fighting we just held on
[1:19:45] to her and the devil threw her down to
[1:19:47] the ground we just kept praying all of a
[1:19:49] sudden she just let go and I kinda like
[1:19:51] passed out and I later read in the Bible
[1:19:54] that's exactly how Jesus cast them out
[1:19:56] hey man how are you it's exactly how
[1:19:59] Jesus and their like we got a patter on
[1:20:01] the cheek and said how do you feel she
[1:20:02] said I feel better
[1:20:03] I said let's praise the Lord and we
[1:20:06] started and then it happened a few days
[1:20:07] later I was praying for a girl and she
[1:20:09] bit me on the arm before she fell down
[1:20:11] the ground and before the demon was cast
[1:20:13] out and so see these things have to
[1:20:17] happen you have to be away from fear and
[1:20:20] yet be full of faith that's how these
[1:20:23] things happen there can't be any fear
[1:20:25] you can't have any doubt jesus said that
[1:20:27] in Luke 8:50 let's read that Luke 8:15
[1:20:31] so those are two stories where everybody
[1:20:34] around was full of faith there was no
[1:20:36] fear and then God moved on the scene
[1:20:40] look 850 but when Jesus heard it you
[1:20:44] answered him saying fear not believe
[1:20:46] only and she shall be made whole all's
[1:20:50] you got to do Jesus says is believe you
[1:20:55] cannot fear you must believe only how
[1:20:58] many want to believe only amen
[1:21:01] I found that to be true I know that's
[1:21:04] the truth Jesus proved it the Bible
[1:21:06] proves it if we only can get rid of all
[1:21:08] the fear and just believe all things are
[1:21:10] possible then the belief amen
[1:21:13] that's the that's the fourth time there
[1:21:15] the fourth example I've given how am i
[1:21:17] doing on time okay I got 10 more minutes
[1:21:18] let me set my timer
[1:21:19] I just wanna preach about an hour are
[1:21:22] you enjoying this tonight by God's grace
[1:21:23] Jesus always said fear not always fear
[1:21:27] not fear not in every situation whether
[1:21:29] sending them out whether dealing with
[1:21:30] sickness or death or healing he always
[1:21:33] had to get the fear out first before he
[1:21:35] could do any miracle all right now the
[1:21:38] next one is John 619 let's go there John
[1:21:41] 619 I'm sorry I'm sorry I already
[1:21:45] retired read this one
[1:21:46] yeah I'm sorry we gotta read this is a
[1:21:48] parallel passage the one we already read
[1:21:49] pardon me are you read that one yeah I'm
[1:21:53] sorry my fault let's go the next one
[1:21:57] here by God's grace let's go to mark
[1:21:59] 1032 this will be encouraging for you
[1:22:01] and I mark 1032 mark 1032 this isn't
[1:22:11] necessarily a miracle but this is Jesus
[1:22:13] bringing comfort to the people
[1:22:18] mark 1032 I want you to see how Jesus
[1:22:24] come first watch how he comforts them
[1:22:25] because God might be comforting you
[1:22:27] tonight the same way there might not be
[1:22:29] anybody here a demon-possessed I don't
[1:22:31] see anybody demon-possessed in here I
[1:22:32] don't see anybody may be dying and thank
[1:22:34] God you know that that God's blessed us
[1:22:36] where we don't have those troubles but
[1:22:37] this is definitely one thing we can pull
[1:22:39] away and say this is true we need all
[1:22:42] the other times for when people are sick
[1:22:43] or dying or close to death
[1:22:46] we need all we need all the scripture
[1:22:47] for that but tonight this might be one
[1:22:49] that was really for us mark 10:30 - and
[1:22:52] they were this disciples they were in
[1:22:54] the way going up to Jerusalem and Jesus
[1:22:56] went before them and they were amazed
[1:22:57] and as they followed they were afraid
[1:23:00] and he took unto the again the twelve
[1:23:04] and began to tell them what things
[1:23:06] should happen unto him now verse 33 1033
[1:23:14] so I got the room yeah saying behold we
[1:23:16] go up to Jerusalem and the Son of man
[1:23:18] shall be delivered under the chief
[1:23:19] priests and the scribes and they shall
[1:23:21] condemn him to death and she'll deliver
[1:23:22] him to the Gentiles and they shall mock
[1:23:25] him and shall scourge him and shall spit
[1:23:27] upon him and he shall and shall kill him
[1:23:29] in the third day he shall rise I don't
[1:23:33] know if you caught that there but the
[1:23:34] thing is they're going up to Jerusalem
[1:23:36] and they're all scared and so what does
[1:23:38] Jesus do to help them in their fear he
[1:23:40] tells them what's going to happen in
[1:23:42] other words he foretells the future
[1:23:44] would that encourage you I wonder what's
[1:23:47] gonna happen I wonder what's gonna
[1:23:48] happen Jesus says I'm gonna tell you
[1:23:50] what's gonna happen in other words I'm
[1:23:51] gonna prophesy and I'm gonna tell you
[1:23:53] the future hallelujah glory don't you
[1:23:57] like that Amen Jesus in order to comfort
[1:24:00] them says let me tell you the future and
[1:24:02] the Bible said the Spirit of Jesus
[1:24:03] Christ is the spirit of prophecy
[1:24:05] hallelujah thank you Lord they're going
[1:24:10] up there all afraid he tells them the
[1:24:12] future the future should comfort us
[1:24:14] praise God because Jesus tells us what's
[1:24:16] going to happen amen all right now
[1:24:20] go to Luke 1231 let's go to Luke 12 31
[1:24:24] Matthew Mark Luke Luke 12 31 I hope that
[1:24:30] was a blessing Luke 12 31
[1:24:40] Jesus had just in Chapter 12 he just
[1:24:42] warned the of 11 of the Pharisees gave
[1:24:45] the parable of the rich few fool which
[1:24:49] is actually the rich young ruler for
[1:24:50] that we talked about earlier went to
[1:24:52] hell because of his love for money he
[1:24:54] kept all the other commandments but he
[1:24:55] just didn't keep the commandment about
[1:24:57] riches he loved riches and so the Bible
[1:25:00] said he was lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:25:03] because he loved money more than he
[1:25:05] loved God how awful how sad is that Luke
[1:25:08] 12 31 but rather seek ye first the
[1:25:13] kingdom of God and all these things
[1:25:15] shall be added unto you fear not little
[1:25:19] flock for as your father's good pleasure
[1:25:21] to give you the kingdom Amen in that
[1:25:25] beautiful promise we must put God's
[1:25:27] kingdom first above everything above our
[1:25:29] jobs above our families above our homes
[1:25:31] got seeking God and doing God's will
[1:25:34] must be first and then he promised
[1:25:37] everything will be added to you don't
[1:25:39] fear I'll give you the kingdom and the
[1:25:41] Kingdom is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:43] amen the power of God the believer if
[1:25:46] you just seek God first and put him
[1:25:49] first the kingdom of God will come to
[1:25:51] you it's a promise amen
[1:25:53] now let me show you a couple where fear
[1:25:56] hinders here's a few where fear hinders
[1:25:59] the people let's go to we're already in
[1:26:01] Luke let's go to mark 9:31 mark 9:31
[1:26:06] let's go there mark 9:31 and 32 Jesus
[1:26:17] always said fear not we're seeing this
[1:26:19] all the time he tells everybody fear not
[1:26:20] fear not no matter what situation
[1:26:22] whether just a beginner whether your
[1:26:25] disciple being sent out whether there's
[1:26:27] sickness in the home every time it's
[1:26:28] don't fear don't fear have faith in God
[1:26:31] amen
[1:26:32] mark 9:31 for he taught his disciples
[1:26:39] and said then the son of man is
[1:26:41] delivered in the hands of men and they
[1:26:43] shall kill him
[1:26:44] and after that he is killed he shall
[1:26:46] rise that third days this is a parallel
[1:26:47] passage what we read earlier
[1:26:48] look at verse 32 but they understood not
[1:26:51] that saying and
[1:26:52] were afraid to ask him so here's
[1:26:55] something we want to learn from Jesus
[1:26:56] preaches the word and they're scared to
[1:26:59] ask in the meaning of that we don't want
[1:27:02] to be scared to ask God though what his
[1:27:04] word means right we want to come to God
[1:27:06] in prayer when I say lord help me to
[1:27:08] understand this they should have went to
[1:27:10] Jesus and they should have asked him
[1:27:12] right that's why we should be afraid if
[1:27:15] you have a question for me
[1:27:16] come bring a question I love questions
[1:27:17] if you hear another preacher preach
[1:27:19] something we shouldn't be afraid to go
[1:27:21] ask them because fear has torment right
[1:27:24] so the disciples here because they're
[1:27:27] scared to ask they can get themselves in
[1:27:29] a spot of torment they get them spot
[1:27:31] their selves in a spot where it's
[1:27:33] uncomfortable they don't enjoy serving
[1:27:35] the Lord because they're under fear all
[1:27:37] the time we and the Bible says that
[1:27:40] especially preachers should be ready
[1:27:42] always to give an answer for the hope
[1:27:44] that's what inside of them I remember
[1:27:45] that first Peter 3:15 but sanctify the
[1:27:50] Lord God in your hearts and be ready
[1:27:52] always to give an answer for those for
[1:27:55] the hope that you have within you praise
[1:27:56] God but see they were scared to ask you
[1:28:00] and I can't be scared to ask remember we
[1:28:03] like the Bible said there's no there's
[1:28:05] no love and fear right fear has torment
[1:28:08] we don't want to sit back in me torment
[1:28:09] well I don't know what this means I
[1:28:10] don't know what that means
[1:28:11] we should pray ask God and then go to
[1:28:13] the vessel that God sends us to we don't
[1:28:15] want to stand back and say well I'm just
[1:28:17] gonna be led by fear we don't want to be
[1:28:19] fearful we want to go to Christ and ask
[1:28:21] him amen God does not give the spirit of
[1:28:24] fear God didn't want them to be fearful
[1:28:26] God does not give the spirit of fear now
[1:28:30] then here's the next one
[1:28:32] Matthew 21 26 this is an interesting one
[1:28:35] about the Pharisees the primary remember
[1:28:38] this one where Jesus doesn't answer
[1:28:40] their question because they're afraid
[1:28:42] they're afraid of the people the
[1:28:44] Pharisees are afraid of the people and
[1:28:46] they're afraid that they would deny that
[1:28:48] John was a prophet they're afraid of
[1:28:50] what the people would do to them if they
[1:28:52] if they denied John was a prophet
[1:28:54] Matthew 21 26 remember this story
[1:29:03] now in verse 25 I'm sorry I'm just gonna
[1:29:06] go to 25 you have to the baptism of John
[1:29:08] whence was it from from heaven or from
[1:29:10] men so they asked Jesus what authority
[1:29:13] to have to teach these things and he
[1:29:14] said well let me ask you a question
[1:29:16] I like how God turns it around on them
[1:29:18] let me ask you a question there is
[1:29:21] trying to catch him in something wrong
[1:29:22] right with his questions he said the
[1:29:25] baptism of John wasn't from God or was
[1:29:27] it for men and these were men that
[1:29:29] wouldn't obey the prophet of God John
[1:29:31] the Baptist these are religious church
[1:29:32] members that wouldn't obey the spirit of
[1:29:35] Elijah hey they wouldn't obey the spirit
[1:29:38] of Elijah right oh my look what they
[1:29:41] said in verse 25 and they reasoned with
[1:29:42] themselves saying if we say from heaven
[1:29:44] he will say this why did he not then
[1:29:47] believe him verse 26 but if we shall say
[1:29:51] of men we fear the people for all hold
[1:29:55] John as a prophet so see they didn't
[1:29:59] want to admit that they feared the
[1:30:01] people right so here's the Pharisees are
[1:30:04] in a state of fear look what Jesus says
[1:30:06] because they're in a state of fear verse
[1:30:07] 27 and they answered Jesus that we
[1:30:10] cannot tell and he said well neither
[1:30:12] tell I you by what authority I do these
[1:30:15] things right see that they're scared of
[1:30:19] what the they're scared of what the
[1:30:21] people will think so Jesus says well I'm
[1:30:23] not going to answer your question if you
[1:30:24] don't have enough courage to state what
[1:30:26] you really feel I'm not going to answer
[1:30:28] your question so see Jesus will let
[1:30:31] people sit in fear if they don't want to
[1:30:33] obey the Word of God because Jesus is
[1:30:35] calling us out the Bible says he that
[1:30:37] the Sun sets free is free indeed Jesus
[1:30:40] wants that make his people free but if
[1:30:42] these religious people just want to sit
[1:30:44] there and don't want to know the Word of
[1:30:46] God and don't want obey God's prophet
[1:30:47] they didn't obey John the Baptist Jesus
[1:30:49] said fine then let them go there I can't
[1:30:51] help them because they're scared of the
[1:30:53] people and they're just trying to keep a
[1:30:54] position because it's all about money
[1:30:56] for some of these right it's all about
[1:30:58] money they just want to keep their stats
[1:30:59] their status in the community they want
[1:31:01] to keep their their paychecks you know
[1:31:04] they wanted to keep their homes and for
[1:31:06] some religious people they won't come
[1:31:07] out into the truth because they're
[1:31:10] scared about money they're scared of
[1:31:11] being rejected by the people you see
[1:31:14] that so geez
[1:31:15] leaves the nurses I'm not gonna answer
[1:31:17] your question I'm gonna let you stay in
[1:31:19] your fear because you're fearing to obey
[1:31:21] the prophet of the hour aren't you glad
[1:31:23] we've been Jo BAE the prophet of the
[1:31:24] hour amen let me close now there's my
[1:31:28] timer that was ten minutes so let me
[1:31:29] find my place to close here all right
[1:31:34] cause I still got a lot left I may have
[1:31:36] to finish this next Wednesday I might
[1:31:40] have to finish your next Wednesday let's
[1:31:45] close with this
[1:31:48] Romans four to four maokai let's just
[1:31:51] put these up here real quick I just want
[1:31:52] to go of this we've I preached on this a
[1:31:54] few years ago but I want to show how to
[1:31:55] get in love with God so faith can
[1:31:58] operate it starts with Romans 2:4 if we
[1:32:03] know how many what faith to operate in
[1:32:04] their lives I want that to out of walk
[1:32:06] and if there's something I want to walk
[1:32:07] in my home and the school or a church
[1:32:09] and if there's a fearful thing I want to
[1:32:12] have faith in that situation I don't
[1:32:13] want to be scared I don't have faith
[1:32:15] that you know God sent me here to help
[1:32:17] out the situation to be a man of faith
[1:32:20] not a man of fear I don't to be a man of
[1:32:21] faith
[1:32:22] here's how you get faith in your heart
[1:32:25] so you can operate God can operate
[1:32:27] through us now I'm gonna skip down here
[1:32:29] know not knowing that the goodness of
[1:32:32] God leads us to repentance so the first
[1:32:35] step in getting full of faith is
[1:32:37] remembering of how good god is we must
[1:32:39] remember how much God loves us right
[1:32:41] because goodness when you remember how
[1:32:44] much God loves you then you can repent
[1:32:46] because you know God's gonna forgive you
[1:32:48] right we're not we're not scared of
[1:32:50] going to hell that's what happens people
[1:32:51] get scared they get caught in their sins
[1:32:53] they think God can never forgive me God
[1:32:54] could ever give me but the Bible said we
[1:32:56] the goodness of God will lead you to
[1:32:58] repentance when you hear how much God
[1:33:00] loves you that should make you want to
[1:33:02] repent amen when you see how much mercy
[1:33:04] God has had upon your life to heal us or
[1:33:07] bring the word to you or help you or
[1:33:09] love you or provide for all your needs
[1:33:11] that seen the love of God should make us
[1:33:13] want to repent of our sins and in our
[1:33:15] mistakes that's how God works with us so
[1:33:18] first we must recognize how good God is
[1:33:21] to us and then we'll repent of our sins
[1:33:24] the next step is Jude 120 now I go to
[1:33:27] Jude 120
[1:33:29] the first step is repentance if you sin
[1:33:31] against God in any way remember how much
[1:33:33] God loves you how good god has been to
[1:33:35] you repent of that sin and jude 1:20
[1:33:40] says this you're getting good maokai
[1:33:42] good work buddy getting good on the
[1:33:43] computer there I always tell him all the
[1:33:45] time I'm proud of him he does a lot of
[1:33:47] he keeps up with us real good but ye
[1:33:49] beloved now look what it says building
[1:33:51] up yourselves on your most holy faith
[1:33:53] praying in the Holy Ghost how do you get
[1:33:57] more faith brother Adam for the Hosea
[1:33:58] how do you get more faith you pray in
[1:34:00] the Holy Ghost I just pray the same old
[1:34:03] prayer routine Hilma Hail Mary Mother I
[1:34:05] mean some people can pray that I'm not
[1:34:07] making fun of them I'm just saying if
[1:34:08] they pray the same thing and it's not
[1:34:10] really from the heart it doesn't have
[1:34:12] any effect just like we can pray we can
[1:34:14] just come here and pray I can pray here
[1:34:16] but if there's no heart if there's no
[1:34:17] sincere in it the Spirit of God won't
[1:34:19] bless my prayer we have to pray in the
[1:34:21] Holy Ghost and that's how you build
[1:34:24] yourselves up in holy faith amen so
[1:34:27] church there's a reality behind that we
[1:34:29] need to pray until our faith rises but
[1:34:32] the first step is confess your sin know
[1:34:34] how much God loves you God's love will
[1:34:37] lead you to repent and then you pray
[1:34:39] until your faith is built up hallelujah
[1:34:43] and then next Scripture okay I'm sorry
[1:34:45] 21 Malachi so you pray and the Holy
[1:34:48] Ghost and keep yourselves the love of
[1:34:50] God don't hate anybody don't get mad at
[1:34:52] anybody love and love your enemies love
[1:34:54] those that say evil things against you
[1:34:56] keep yourselves and love of God looking
[1:34:59] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus and
[1:35:00] eternal life so first see how much God
[1:35:03] loves you wants you to repent repent of
[1:35:05] that then pray in the Holy Spirit pray
[1:35:07] with God's Spirit upon you until your
[1:35:09] faith rises keep yourself in the love of
[1:35:12] God first John 4:18 now Kai first John
[1:35:15] 4:18 a little bit faster if he puts up
[1:35:18] their force looks like I said I need to
[1:35:21] close my times already up first John
[1:35:23] 4:18 so if you've done all that there is
[1:35:28] no fear in love that's why Jesus would
[1:35:31] always say fear not don't fear don't
[1:35:33] fear nothing can be done if people are
[1:35:35] afraid there's no fear in love but
[1:35:38] perfect love casts out fear
[1:35:43] right so this is the step this is step
[1:35:46] number two love cast out off here the
[1:35:48] first step is recognize God's goodness
[1:35:49] and pray building up your faith step 2
[1:35:52] when you're full of that love and faith
[1:35:54] that will cast out all the fear in your
[1:35:56] heart because fear hath torment he that
[1:35:59] feareth is not made perfect in love
[1:36:01] now our flesh might be fearful but we
[1:36:03] got to have faith in our hearts because
[1:36:05] sometimes our flesh you can't help but
[1:36:06] your flesh is just going to be scared
[1:36:07] but if your mind is all if your mind is
[1:36:11] clear from all fear you can stand there
[1:36:13] on the Word of God and know what's gonna
[1:36:15] happen
[1:36:15] amen perfect love casts out all fear now
[1:36:20] look at verse 19 this goes along with
[1:36:22] the previous scripture look at verse 19
[1:36:24] Malachi says we love him why because he
[1:36:27] first loved us so that goes back to that
[1:36:30] first step you have to remember how much
[1:36:31] God loves you we must remember how much
[1:36:34] God loves me praise God then repent of
[1:36:36] my mistakes and then pray in the spirit
[1:36:39] until our faith is built up and then
[1:36:41] that faith will cast out all fear amen
[1:36:44] hallelujah
[1:36:46] and then the last scripture let's stand
[1:36:48] on our feet Galatians 5:6 now I can put
[1:36:50] up there the last scripture then faith
[1:36:52] starts operating by love yep
[1:36:57] Galatians 5:6 thank you sir this is how
[1:37:00] it's done this is the Bible teaching on
[1:37:01] faith and fear for in Christ Jesus
[1:37:04] neither circumcision availeth anything
[1:37:07] nor uncircumcision right here but faith
[1:37:10] which works by what what does faith work
[1:37:11] by love faith works by love so if you
[1:37:16] gots it in your heart let's go back
[1:37:18] again you gots in your heart remember
[1:37:20] how much God loves you repent confess
[1:37:22] your sin as you pray build up your faith
[1:37:24] believe God's promise then cast out all
[1:37:27] the fear now once all the fears out now
[1:37:30] your faith can operate now if you get
[1:37:32] sick now you can speak to that sickness
[1:37:34] right or now if somebody's sick you know
[1:37:37] now once all this is out your hearts
[1:37:39] pure pure before God now you can go pray
[1:37:41] for the sick person and trust God's
[1:37:43] gonna heal them you can have faith how
[1:37:45] many believe that by God's grace that is
[1:37:48] the scripture Jesus always said fear not
[1:37:54] praise the Lord I want to just close
[1:37:58] with this brother Craig I was watching
[1:38:01] his testimony in 1999 brother Brooks
[1:38:03] preached a sermon on the sermon title
[1:38:06] was Jesus never preach a funeral because
[1:38:10] he go into every funeral and raised the
[1:38:12] dead he never reached a fever that's
[1:38:17] awesome and brother Craig tells the
[1:38:19] testimony I forget what month it was was
[1:38:21] in 1990 must been in the spring or
[1:38:22] summer or winter because they went
[1:38:24] outside and all of a sudden brother
[1:38:26] Brooke stopped and he said I feel that
[1:38:29] too close so they stopped there he's
[1:38:31] outside shaking hands is that Bible
[1:38:33] believers where where I was married my
[1:38:35] wife and I were married this was what we
[1:38:38] got married 2000 weeks this was four
[1:38:39] years before we got married and brother
[1:38:41] Craig said he went over to brother
[1:38:42] Brooks's house which is right next to
[1:38:44] the church he just reading his Bible
[1:38:45] studying all of a sudden here's a big
[1:38:47] bang outside the church he looks out the
[1:38:51] window and there was a car accident two
[1:38:53] cars collide at that corner right there
[1:38:55] where the church is Spencer bill Road I
[1:38:57] forget the other one I forget the name
[1:38:58] of the road and brother Craig he sees it
[1:39:02] and he's caused the brother Brooks his
[1:39:03] wife and he says call 9-1-1 there's an
[1:39:06] accident and they said and this is on
[1:39:08] the tape and this was also in the
[1:39:09] newspaper in Lima brother Craig has the
[1:39:11] article this was in the newspaper in
[1:39:13] Lima 1999 they went out and the
[1:39:15] situation and there was a an Indian man
[1:39:18] and his wife and they were Muslim and
[1:39:20] the Indian man is laying there and
[1:39:23] brother Craig said there's blood coming
[1:39:24] out of his face

[1:39:28] first pulse and he's dead she says she's
[1:39:31] screaming crying said there's no there's
[1:39:32] no there's no pulse and brother sun
[1:39:35] brother Craig's testimony
[1:39:36] there's no pulse this was just what all
[1:39:39] these 18 years ago brother Craig said
[1:39:42] the people in the church just heard a
[1:39:43] sermon that Jesus never preach a funeral
[1:39:46] he said they just go around there real
[1:39:48] humbly they just started praying just
[1:39:49] whispering dear lord have mercy and
[1:39:52] brother Josh for his twin brother you
[1:39:54] remember Josh for the song leader I
[1:39:55] donno if you member him his twin brother
[1:39:57] was going to church there at the time he
[1:39:59] said he felt that dead man's spirit and
[1:40:01] soul come down and enter back in the
[1:40:04] body and all of a sudden the man's eyes
[1:40:05] open
[1:40:07] and they raised him up and he was alive
[1:40:09] and they just started praising the Lord
[1:40:11] glorifying God and it was in the
[1:40:12] newspaper you can watch it on the
[1:40:14] testimony they have the picture of the
[1:40:15] man on the newspaper he had no pause his
[1:40:18] wife checked he's a nurse no pause
[1:40:20] they prayed God brought him back to life
[1:40:23] and the man wasn't even a Christian and
[1:40:25] that's how much power God has but see

[1:40:34] girls they there's out there praying and

[1:40:42] last few years that have died on the
[1:40:43] jobsite and God has eventually brought
[1:40:45] them back to life God is the god of
