[26:22] Wednesday I'm just gonna need some time
[26:26] here we'll bring at least one service
[26:28] break a toxic 24 verse 35 says heavens
[26:45] and earth shall pass away but my words
[26:49] shall not pass away and here on the

[27:11] God Lord no just enter into the minds of
[27:14] the people God or the suffering overseas
[27:16] cops yes where I live day by day god no
[27:20] we're just waiting reading waiting for
[27:22] the living how the week on you God
[27:25] reading for both the persecution or
[27:27] these these things Lord they can be
[27:34] trouble very very quickly God when we
[27:38] have a space free time and every single
[27:46] more give us a revelation is real last
[27:51] our work a quick short work revelation
[27:56] testifying everyone yes you know they
[27:59] were just the bestest those services you
[28:01] might have not taught this yet though
[28:03] it's no pressure we got just real simple
[28:25] thought a couple things Jesus Christ he
[28:35] prophesied as in the days of Noah so
[28:39] shall that is a son can be man as in the
[28:43] days of lot so shall the Son of man be
[28:45] and the last you know we've been the
[28:48] message now 1415 years and we've seen a
[28:53] lot of the same things that we see it
[28:57] know as they SC in the last day amen but
[29:04] I like what says Jesus said there he
[29:06] said heavens and earth shall pass away
[29:07] but my words shall never pass away
[29:12] Genesis 1:1 where the where God created
[29:15] the heavens of the earth and the Bible
[29:17] says the word the God started speaking
[29:20] and one of his first sentences was let
[29:23] there be light and as that like my
[29:26] fourth the logos came forth out of the
[29:29] Father and now he is a father and now
[29:31] the son is standing before them and the
[29:32] father come down then and dwelt within
[29:34] the son and through the son of through
[29:37] that logos all of creation came through
[29:40] amen and through the logos the voice of
[29:43] God would speak right through that light
[29:45] to be create the Sun in the moon the
[29:48] heavens all of creation came out of this
[29:50] and uh as it was spoken behind those
[29:55] wordsworth faith it would have the faith
[29:58] of a man it was not a face of Karl face
[30:01] is not a face them or even a hope but it
[30:04] was a faith it was the face of the
[30:05] creature the faith of God himself
[30:08] so it was a faith of Jesus Christ amen
[30:11] and if there is a man that we could call
[30:13] faith it would be Jesus Christ a lot of
[30:17] my men in the world leading girls faith
[30:20] but the amen but he says my words shall
[30:36] never pass away so when he speaks
[30:39] something the word goes sport those
[30:42] vibrations
[30:43] however they come out of a spirit the
[30:46] God is God the spirit God the Father
[30:48] however those words comes forth out of
[30:51] his his spirit self through migration
[30:54] they always accomplish what they go war
[30:58] to what they're spoken to they
[31:00] accomplish amen Isaiah 45 chapter 45 22
[31:08] says look unto me and be saved all the
[31:11] ends of the earth he says for I am God
[31:13] and there is none else she says I have
[31:16] swore by myself he says the word has
[31:18] gone out of my mouth he says he says in
[31:21] righteous
[31:22] and shall not return what return bad boy
[31:26] they might even nobody speaks will take
[31:29] place yes then powerful things about
[31:35] prophecy is that God knows he's the
[31:39] author and finisher of our faith he
[31:41] knows the end from the beginning is the
[31:42] out the Omega the first and the last
[31:45] he's all those things and what he knows
[31:47] it's going to take place he speaks it
[31:49] and and when it comes the past then we
[31:54] know that God has spoken they meant to
[31:57] do that it's all my man it's all by
[32:00] teaching us write her back in the day
[32:02] when I was a big Larry Bird fan brother
[32:03] Jesse was the Magic Johnson's Pantheon
[32:05] right only between us
[32:07] he's all magical all birds I was big
[32:13] into Larry Bird and Lady Bird was title
[32:14] on the court and he saw Xavier McDaniel
[32:17] it was a last-second shot and he had two
[32:19] or three seconds left for beating for
[32:21] five and living for him walk down and
[32:23] told these Avery says you're gonna guard
[32:25] me and I'm going to get the ball right
[32:26] here and I might hit this shot and I'm
[32:29] gonna win this game
[32:29] Xavier is like bring it and I love that
[32:34] about it I just love this area C is
[32:36] dysphasia the south-facing zone
[32:38] abilities thanks eliminated and he said
[32:40] that in his memoirs he says I get a
[32:43] charge from say from tell some I'm gonna
[32:45] do something he said then I do it I sure
[32:49] not really they had the involved pass
[32:51] the bird because the cocoa mask goose
[32:53] write that same location turns around a
[32:55] jumper and that's right as I Amen but
[33:04] that's one thing I like about proxy is
[33:07] when God says something he doesn't know
[33:17] everything must be just right
[33:20] absolutely yeah sure he says now that
[33:23] Isaiah 46 verse 8 he says remember this
[33:27] and show yourselves bad he says bring it
[33:30] again to my know he's transgressors
[33:31] remember the former things of all he
[33:33] says he says for
[33:35] god there's miles I am God as there is
[33:37] none like me amen
[33:39] he says declaring what his remembers I
[33:41] declare the in from the beginning he
[33:44] says and the ancient times the things
[33:45] that are not yet done he's the same my
[33:48] house or so stand and I shall do all my
[33:51] that he says remember these things I'm
[33:52] speaking to you he says because of the
[33:54] future you're going to see him come to
[33:55] pass his word and the word is just as
[34:04] good as the man's words only as good as
[34:08] himself absolutely then sometimes I make
[34:11] promises to do this to do that I come
[34:13] off short when they don't call access
[34:16] loot because I'm not God but when God's
[34:19] peace you can bet on a mentally amen now
[34:25] Isaiah 55 verse 8 now how could he do
[34:29] this he says from my thoughts are not
[34:32] your thoughts neither are my are your
[34:35] ways my ways so the way we think
[34:37] something how to take place is totally
[34:40] contrary to the way that God sees some
[34:42] this thoughts are so much hotter
[34:44] absolutely yes he says he says say the
[34:48] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[34:50] the earth so my ways are higher than
[34:52] yours of my austin you were so he
[34:54] compares it from natural to spiritual he
[34:57] says look he says this natural earth
[34:58] that short boss he's looked up because
[35:01] you can't even tell her out of him he
[35:02] said then that's how I back off so
[35:07] that's it
[35:09] he's this love is all sir wavy I we
[35:12] could even imagine it will not
[35:13] understand you only until we receive
[35:15] that body and that isospeed with our
[35:17] husband we can embrace him and talk with
[35:19] him and be with it for all eternity
[35:21] that's we will start to know all the
[35:27] wonderful things of truth and facts
[35:30] about Jesus Christ and sometimes we get
[35:32] a little boys how are you here if we
[35:34] hear it or a little something in our
[35:35] heart or a billion all it goes but when
[35:37] we actually get to know him that's what
[35:39] whew that's that's what I'm talking
[35:41] about right there there's you got to
[35:43] spend time
[35:44] my ass he says glory that's who I cannot
[35:48] wait for that
[35:49] hallelujah he says for as the rain comes
[35:51] down the snow from Havanese and return
[35:54] not bitter but water the earth making it
[35:57] bring forth of the bud then it may give
[35:59] seed to the sower and bread to the eater
[36:01] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[36:05] of my mouth he says it shall not return
[36:07] unto me void they might be a man
[36:10] everything he says will take place he
[36:13] says but he shall accomplish that which
[36:15] I please and it shall prosper in the
[36:17] thing whereto I sent it yes absolutely
[36:21] so when he speaks the very word and
[36:24] nowaday was this type for nowadays they
[36:26] have heat-seeking or computer guided
[36:28] missiles they sent forward this thing is
[36:32] they said I went right here they should
[36:33] order that beacons then pulls that
[36:36] missile right to an absolutely and then
[36:38] the same way as the Word of God we speak
[36:40] something about this something for that
[36:42] person or this place when he's speaking
[36:44] about it because goes out forever and in
[36:47] circles and it hits absolutely my hand
[36:49] yes but it must is the right time the
[36:51] right time again that's right
[36:55] now he's you know accomplish that which
[36:57] I please in a press so shall prosper in
[36:59] the thing whereto I sent it a man that's
[37:02] right yes but now look what he says here
[37:04] in front of the stage of the ministry
[37:06] Jesus now when we come here and all
[37:08] remember that we live here in three
[37:09] dimensions now we're going to cover
[37:12] these dimensions that you went over them
[37:13] before mum just in truth right has he
[37:15] says we live hearing these three
[37:16] dimensions he's I don't know whether I
[37:17] came to them or not one of them is like
[37:20] he says the other is matter Tommy do you
[37:22] remember what the third is a little bit
[37:23] of tongue here
[37:24] he says whoa he's is Adam time he that's
[37:27] right he's now we have a nice manner and
[37:29] time that's the first three dimensions
[37:31] that we lived in more than her out there
[37:34] like matter in time he says and those
[37:37] cut and our five senses contact them
[37:40] dimensions and our sites contact the
[37:43] light and our feelings matter and so
[37:44] forth he says he says but we had contact
[37:47] through five science now to what the
[37:49] fourth dimension right he says as it was
[37:54] because they're coming right through
[37:55] this building right now comes pictures
[37:57] and voices Arabia
[37:58] a television he's in our senses do not
[38:01] pick that up
[38:02] so he's breaking this down for the first
[38:05] time when I come to the message I
[38:06] understand these dimensions sure I've
[38:08] heard of I size dimension I heard of
[38:10] other dimensions of this dimension but
[38:11] here now when he comes in truth I would
[38:13] understand exactly what these dimensions
[38:15] are amen he says he says so that's the
[38:19] radio waves of the pictures all these
[38:21] other things when we speak to one
[38:23] another we see our we see our mouths
[38:25] move we see we hear each other but do we
[38:28] see those words know that Edison said it
[38:30] two dimension and then now we're able to
[38:32] pick those up in a zoo because that's
[38:35] within the three dimensions yes he said
[38:37] now the fifth dimension is where the
[38:38] sinner unbeliever dies and goes to the
[38:40] fifth dimension is what kinda he's a
[38:42] horrible dimension and that's he types
[38:45] that dimension with a man falls asleep
[38:47] he's in between there and it goes into a
[38:49] nightmare he says he entered into the
[38:51] fifth dimension
[38:52] absolutely he says now when a christian
[38:56] died as he goes into the sixth dimension
[38:58] is what the altar right underneath the
[39:00] throne of golf correct he says I think
[39:01] God is in the seventh dimension eighth
[39:04] man that's right no he says you know
[39:07] that the infinite God I said to the
[39:09] Phoenix oh they coming down he's just
[39:10] like television is coming he's coming he
[39:15] says it's coming Christ is right here in
[39:17] the building now so he say he says the
[39:20] dimensions are here right now that word
[39:22] got into an egg and forth exist in human
[39:25] Jesus Christ is right here right now the
[39:28] area and another quote of Ingary later
[39:30] he says he says when we get to the other
[39:32] side of the millennium and start to
[39:33] under they understand these things in
[39:35] this great a movie of our lives is paid
[39:38] out before Jesus and he's I wonder off
[39:41] all the dimensions will be opened up and
[39:43] we'll be able to see that Jesus Christ
[39:44] was there the entire crazy one that I'm
[39:49] dealing with these dimensions remember
[39:51] when the word comes for let me read this
[39:55] here he says Jesus and now you know he
[40:02] says the voice never dies it never dies
[40:05] nicely in 20 years if they can
[40:08] progressively have now they probably
[40:10] have that they'll be able to
[40:12] the literal voice of Jesus Christ when
[40:14] he was on the earth in 20 years from
[40:17] them so they might be able to make
[40:19] tithing devices that could pick up all
[40:21] these voices he says because the voice
[40:24] has never died the Word of God never
[40:26] will always stand Shores whoa you cannot
[40:30] you cannot die this is because God and
[40:32] the word are the same he says the seeker
[40:36] he says then because it's drop it's like
[40:39] dropping a petal in the pond he says and
[40:41] the little waves they finally fade away
[40:43] out of your sight but science claims
[40:45] they go back for one bank the bank to
[40:47] bank across the seats with others back
[40:49] in 40s if they never died neither does
[40:50] the world that you speak he says no
[40:52] beats when the day of judgment and no
[40:54] idea where safety on you nobody's gonna
[40:56] wait from a minute laure man order seems
[41:00] for the very word of God that we speak
[41:02] is now caught in one Pope he says he's
[41:04] caught in the ether so it's caught in
[41:07] this little round here that we live in
[41:08] and these words bounce off these walls
[41:10] of how many servers are not bouncing off
[41:13] these walls of apprecia this
[41:14] congregation and those sermon on cries
[41:16] off on the day of judgment and condemn
[41:21] and you say yes I await Amen or you say
[41:24] look you heard that's enough to say well
[41:27] I did not hear hearken to the moans come
[41:29] on all right all right so all these
[41:32] things are going forth and all these
[41:33] things and as I was coming up with this
[41:36] kind of thought I read a quote that this
[41:37] thought came to me and I was thinking on
[41:41] it and I was thinking on it I was
[41:42] thinking on it and I thought about all
[41:43] the things that God has spoken in this
[41:45] day how everything must come to pass
[41:48] yeah and I thought about the importance
[41:50] of his word and we read that member in
[41:52] John 6 3063 said he says and these words
[41:55] have life that is what Jesus Christ
[42:01] spoke what God spoke from Genesis 1 all
[42:04] the way and the words of God of speeding
[42:06] they entered into this ether into this
[42:09] realm yes and they have life they have
[42:13] through the spirit and they are
[42:14] quickening power within them yeah Carrie
[42:17] they must carry an anointing with it
[42:20] if says something something has to
[42:22] happen but it has to write for wait for
[42:24] the right person timing it has those
[42:27] things coming to play literally but now
[42:30] I was thinking about to see how far this
[42:34] year I was thinking about this quote
[42:38] here he says now notice modern a current
[42:42] happenings that we have notice modern
[42:46] happenings that we have we look at the
[42:48] scientific age that we live in push what
[42:50] age yes Jesus and yet people have less
[42:53] time to pray than they ever did you know
[42:55] all these modern times they used to set
[42:57] all night and listen to a sermon now we
[43:00] just can't do it we haven't got the time
[43:01] you do do you see it he says you see
[43:04] it's just in your head we think we
[43:06] haven't got time to do it but we have
[43:09] and as I was moving on he says but
[43:12] modern Japanese happenings in the
[43:16] forerunner of spiritual habits so we
[43:19] sing as God's word went forth and the
[43:21] end times must be like this ten times
[43:23] wispy like this the end times are like
[43:25] that that these modern happenings are
[43:28] our effects of what was spoken about the
[43:31] spiritual right
[43:32] remember what does Christ's word cop
[43:34] aside it's always about the spiritual
[43:37] thing here in his bride yeah
[43:39] but the church is about the rapture it
[43:41] prophesized mostly of those good things
[43:45] but he does add in the horrible things
[43:48] yes sir yes sir he says it's a
[43:53] forerunner of spiritual happenings and
[43:55] remember by that happens our modern
[43:58] happenings are he says he says they're
[44:02] warnings of forerunners of spiritual
[44:05] happenings
[44:06] so every thing we see take place must
[44:10] there must for run a supernatural hey
[44:13] baby
[44:13] yes absolutely the modern and the
[44:17] natural and spiritual exactly is
[44:19] happening accompany the other only
[44:22] improved over the other each thing has
[44:24] happened in the natural and the next
[44:25] thing that happens is an equipment and
[44:27] he likened us to uh Luther Wesley and
[44:32] to the street yes and he was bringing
[44:35] these things in how no there was a
[44:37] horse-and-buggy age right and then when
[44:40] Weston come on and he happens the
[44:42] Wesleyan aged the manatees what strength
[44:44] Lawrence was now the car we had in the
[44:46] beginning of horse and buggy
[44:47] what horse knows what horsepower he said
[44:50] but then what he comes out to the this
[44:54] age of Wordsworth a the car and I was
[44:56] brought in which he said was Wesley's
[44:58] eight he says that we have a car is
[45:00] about the same size a little bit bigger
[45:02] but there's more horses and absolute
[45:05] have been educated sixteen horses he
[45:08] says over sixteen pounds he says then
[45:09] that sixteen horses were mixed more
[45:11] horses than that he's continually
[45:13] getting better better not at the end of
[45:15] that age he says we moved all amount of
[45:18] the Wright brothers brought in airplanes
[45:19] right right he said now that's is it he
[45:24] said and that's the same kind of vehicle
[45:26] but now Waco he can go even faster and
[45:28] farther and has even more horsepower
[45:31] than all those brackets shoot all the
[45:33] way up and think about the horsepower
[45:35] behind that yes to lift the one day it's
[45:38] fun machine absolutely we're Space
[45:41] Shuttle he said how he likened that to
[45:44] us the just an earthly momentum and then
[45:48] getting stronger he's a Luthor Wesley
[45:51] and the Pentecost she says and the
[45:53] Pentecostal Jewish treaties and that's
[45:55] when they took flight in the spirit yes
[45:57] he says and all those ties he says they
[46:00] represent the the conditions of the
[46:02] people in the churches someone a state
[46:04] earthbound just barely gone all right
[46:09] those whirling in the spirit eases
[46:11] don't these be Pentecostal that leaves
[46:14] me somewhat spiritually airplanes not
[46:18] good enough anymore he's as we got to go
[46:19] up into space
[46:20] absolutely right breakthrough in the
[46:23] atmosphere actually goats we're guys
[46:25] it's a minute he's s for the prize
[46:32] like that now here's the quote I hit
[46:35] that ugly oh he says when anything when
[46:37] anything happens on earth it is a worry
[46:41] to us that something is fixing that
[46:43] happen from heaven yes when anything
[46:47] look at your newspapers don't weather
[46:50] look at your heads Ivy's right look at
[46:53] the things that taking place and three
[46:55] of them caught my attention that I've
[46:56] been looking at and I want to hit those
[46:57] today Lord women by God's grace he says
[47:01] he said when that happened to you
[47:02] something is fixing to happen what man
[47:06] does on earth fight but man does on
[47:08] earth fighting his achievement he says
[47:10] is something that God is fixing to do by
[47:12] his achievement to the church oh hi
[47:16] there's three times I popped in my head
[47:18] right away he said now we look when we
[47:22] see we come from horse and buggy to
[47:23] automobile airplane he's at the church
[47:25] the church God has been able in the
[47:27] spiritual line to achieve from
[47:29] justification you lose the second
[47:31] occasion Wesley Matthews oligos now he
[47:33] says he is a tight shadow achievement
[47:35] what God has been able to do he says he
[47:39] allows the natural to do it first that's
[47:42] right so he shows us naturally something
[47:46] first before happened spiritually praise
[47:49] God
[47:50] but it's because spiritually it's
[47:51] already done and it's coming it was what
[47:54] a word of God spoken and when it's
[47:56] spoken is the annoying thing of that
[47:58] word is affecting this earth so it's all
[48:11] about this I say that 7:14 the greatest
[48:19] thing to ever strike the earth the
[48:25] greatest prophecy Isaiah 7:14 therefore
[48:31] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[48:34] right behold a virgin shall conceive and
[48:39] bear a son and call his name Emmanuel
[48:42] and I was thinking
[48:43] what naturally took place before this
[48:49] their history has to record something or
[48:54] somebody to forerun this
[48:57] yes who who could live that kind of life
[49:03] who had this kind of testimony who was
[49:06] recorded in history to live like this
[49:09] right oh my I'm a real story I followed
[49:16] one man 100 he was born in July 13 Leo
[49:26] 100 BC before Christ I hate to tell you
[49:32] what he died now this is this person
[49:36] here breezed this to similarities in the
[49:38] story form and you'll be able to pick
[49:40] him up once upon a time a great man
[49:44] living who his initials were JC Jesus
[49:48] Christ he was born quite poor and lived
[49:52] among the common people even though he
[49:55] was a descendent from the great
[49:57] foundation of foundational King Romulus
[50:01] 14 days he says his aunt his mother my
[50:08] mother's man in Jesus was named Maria or
[50:11] Mary some claimed him for a miraculous
[50:15] birth by cesarean section just like
[50:19] Christ envisioned mysterious birth when
[50:22] he was still young he was almost killed
[50:24] by the tire sulla and Christ was almost
[50:27] killed by hearing his D is DS gaining
[50:31] significant fame during the early part
[50:34] of his public career when he was
[50:36] operating in the province just north
[50:37] called Delaney and cry started in
[50:42] Galilee everywhere he went he was
[50:45] accompanied by his faithful 12 lick
[50:50] doors for lectures or disciples he all
[50:55] he spoke in Proverbs
[50:56] often for example he said I came I saw I
[50:59] conquered
[51:02] he was also close to permiss us woman
[51:07] named Cleopatra Jesus was close to Mary
[51:11] Magdalene and a righteous and probably
[51:15] man named Nicodemus of myth Nia what
[51:20] Christ was close to Nicodemus son Ben
[51:22] Bethany eventually in his faith
[51:26] forced him to take a momentous decision
[51:28] and cross the Rubicon
[51:30] or the Jordan River on the way he was
[51:34] tested at and perform miraculous deeds
[51:36] and a city called Court of corneum for
[51:42] corneum well Christ was cat for
[51:47] Capernaum yes he says then he was
[51:50] operational in the capital Rome in
[51:54] crisis operation temple jerusalem there
[51:59] had been a similar man who he was close
[52:02] to with and had a similar problem a
[52:05] career eventually though Papa or John
[52:09] the Baptist was beheaded by an Egyptian
[52:12] and the head presented to him the exact
[52:16] isaiah 14 was a most powerful scripture
[52:20] that hung for 800 for how many years it
[52:23] was around the earth waiting yeah but
[52:25] God said he says I'm gonna bring a
[52:27] natural man to live it so close he was
[52:34] kind to the Cecilia or the blind the
[52:37] Claudia the lame or the metalia the
[52:40] disfigured just like Christ he was so
[52:43] righteous that the common people started
[52:45] calling by the Greek name Christo's
[52:50] after operating in the capital while his
[52:53] popularity was noticed by a jealous
[52:55] governing body the Senate or the saint
[53:01] he was accused of having ambitions on
[53:04] becoming the key he was betrayed by
[53:25] someone very close to him
[53:28] Decimus or judas right Decimus was a
[53:32] longtime supporter friend and fellow
[53:34] diner the night before who literally led
[53:37] him by the hand to the Senate because he
[53:40] told him brother you're gonna be the
[53:43] king
[53:44] we're gonna make you the king hmm the
[53:51] crowd is forced to choose between this
[53:54] will give away Brutus or Barabbas and
[53:59] him a powerful name named populist Letta
[54:04] puss-puss pilot Washington hands clean
[54:07] to the matter
[54:07] he knows kill on March 15 wearing the
[54:11] crown of grass as he went into the
[54:14] Senate Christ toward the crown of thorns
[54:18] right before it killed he is stabbed
[54:21] between the ribs by someone named
[54:23] Cassius long Gnaeus stand Grady between
[54:26] the ribs just like Christ on the cross
[54:28] right there in blood and water flowed
[54:32] his blood his body was displayed to the
[54:35] people on a crucifix Christ's right his
[54:42] followers were devastated he says as
[54:46] predictions from all around the world
[54:48] had said that a savior and a king of the
[54:51] world when he bore around this time so
[54:56] he ascended into heaven became a God he
[55:00] took the place in pantheon and the son
[55:02] of god the son of Uecker this was none
[55:07] other julius caesar who was the one man
[55:12] that caught the anointing or the
[55:14] Effects of the anointing of that
[55:16] prophecy and had to live it like Christ
[55:19] this is the closest one of your fine Wow
[55:25] there's many other things in addition
[55:28] when Julius Caesar was assassinated the
[55:30] story was that the Scot the sky darkened
[55:34] Josephus records Marc Anthony sang of
[55:37] the murder for the sake of which we
[55:40] suppose that it was the son turned away
[55:41] his night from us as unwilling to view
[55:44] the horde crying they the assassins were
[55:47] guilty as in the case of Caesar
[55:52] we need the elder forty Gnaeus and
[55:58] protracted eclipses of the Sun occurred
[56:01] such as one after the murder of Cesar
[56:04] the dictator and during the anti warmest
[56:06] follows almost the whole the whole world
[56:08] whole years continuous gloom we talk the
[56:15] brightness of the Sun was darkened which
[56:17] all through the year grows very pale and
[56:19] shined not whereby a day but little heat
[56:23] this natural sign followed that natural
[56:26] sign where of the air was rather cloudy
[56:30] and dark by reason of the heat and they
[56:32] could not bring forth calling her earth
[56:34] to bring forth but raw and unripe fruit
[56:40] which Ronald afford could be frightened
[56:46] think about think about the indictment
[56:52] of this generation it has the second
[56:54] crucifixion of Christ I a nice day a man
[56:58] has not the rapture taking place because
[57:00] the fruits not there why because there's
[57:01] a second crucifixion and the Sun went
[57:03] down yes sir yes sir
[57:07] Maggie bandulus even the god Caesar fell
[57:11] to the seen unspeakable wearing in
[57:13] of the world
[57:14] probies brought darkness and forsook the
[57:17] earth he even thought it was a god up in
[57:20] there for took took the Sun from the
[57:21] earth the light Virgil the Sun to pity
[57:25] Rome when Caesar died
[57:27] his shining face and dim dusty red and
[57:31] that impious and pious generation feared
[57:34] eternal night they thought it would
[57:36] never go away because they killed see
[57:39] they thought he was going to be the
[57:42] Messiah the great one notice not even in
[57:47] Israel not even in Jewish time that was
[57:50] that was Gentile that was Rome expecting
[57:54] a world leader of great when to arrives
[57:56] same anointing that the Jews are looking
[57:58] for the whole time right where is this
[58:00] Messiah amen
[58:03] I tried to fight others in history and I
[58:05] thought about Martin Luther because who
[58:07] would be the next great one Martin
[58:09] Luther he changed everything by one man
[58:13] that was close to Martin this man was
[58:16] spiritual - his name was John Wycliff
[58:19] giant Wycliffe was born in the 1300s he
[58:24] was raised up let's see here in the
[58:28] column of the world that says what the
[58:29] waters would soon be stirred by Wycliffe
[58:31] which and they would G would join the
[58:33] fray England must plunged into a hundred
[58:35] years war with France this struggle was
[58:39] waged because some Englishmen were tired
[58:41] of the outrageous taxes had to pay the
[58:44] church because the Englishman lived on
[58:47] church property at that time the banking
[58:49] on one third of all the property in that
[58:52] area and the people were so tired of
[58:55] paying taxes living on his working that
[58:57] wife slit rose up and started publishing
[59:00] thesis is and papers against the
[59:02] Catholic Church saying let this profit
[59:05] and free give it back to the people this
[59:07] and that set us free from these
[59:09] businesses right but then as Martin
[59:11] Luther T Wycliffe freed what he wanted
[59:16] to property God's property 312 loser
[59:19] what he had the God's people through the
[59:24] doors let us freeze if you're not able
[59:27] to have
[59:27] it's tiresome a man hangs one of the
[59:31] first people call the Pope Antichrist
[59:33] they make sure I dad that's right that's
[59:36] what I'm saving that for runner-ups now
[59:38] he's got the Martin Luther was born
[59:43] almost 200 years later than 1400 now
[59:48] what about our day surely who's the next
[59:53] great one after that would be our
[59:55] prophet yes yes sir
[59:58] there had to be unnatural and I'll show
[1:00:03] you there was another person ater as
[1:00:04] well it was called the year of miracles
[1:00:09] and March 1905 Einstein came up with all
[1:00:15] his popular science theories all his
[1:00:18] popular science facts that he put
[1:00:23] together or other common theories
[1:00:25] actually there were theories and they
[1:00:27] still hold up so hold today someone
[1:00:29] disprove some this neck but he's had
[1:00:31] this popular quantum theory of light
[1:00:34] that was in 1905
[1:00:36] we know the 1906 1909 Azusa Street
[1:00:39] revival the pillar of fire a fire was
[1:00:41] seen the light was seen above their
[1:00:43] buildings they met and then in 1909
[1:00:45] well there's a little man born on April
[1:00:49] 60s and there's a little light came
[1:00:50] through that window there tumble over
[1:00:52] the crib of that cabin absolutely it's
[1:00:54] right and that was what he was showing
[1:00:56] what I said was gonna see life
[1:00:58] open up to understanding and what the
[1:01:00] light came now even the lowest
[1:01:03] absolutely rather to this the real
[1:01:08] Elijah had to have a forerunner that was
[1:01:10] faith yes
[1:01:13] now his name was John Alexander Dowie
[1:01:20] born March I'm sorry May 25th 1847 died
[1:01:25] March 9th 1907
[1:01:29] see how close everything just mingled in
[1:01:31] right there he was a he attacked
[1:01:35] churches and he believed that he was the
[1:01:36] newest spiritual leader what and he
[1:01:38] called his church he went out to
[1:01:39] we Illinois's just 40 miles south of us
[1:01:42] Chicago there and set up a church called
[1:01:44] Bloods I am absolutely mom's liner
[1:01:46] something like that he says he was
[1:01:48] drawing people by the thousands but
[1:01:50] there's some major cracks in the
[1:01:51] spiritual foundation as of now his
[1:01:54] personality and of his family he began
[1:01:57] to envision a new church similar to the
[1:01:58] Catholic Church where he was the Pope he
[1:02:01] says at night in 1896 he organizes the
[1:02:04] Christian Catholic Apostolic Church in
[1:02:06] Zion my goodness went back to that and
[1:02:08] 1901 he founded the Zion city about 40
[1:02:11] miles from Chicago he was owner of all
[1:02:13] the property and the tenants leased the
[1:02:15] land they built their houses on their
[1:02:17] savings went into design thing my
[1:02:19] goodness the same yes he said that
[1:02:22] things began to crumble and now we get
[1:02:24] cleared himself Elisha the restorer or
[1:02:30] Elijah the third first Elijah then John
[1:02:34] the Baptist and himself he walked around
[1:02:38] dressed in an Old Testament light priest
[1:02:41] outfit and him 9 in 1907 here was the
[1:02:47] false right before the truth was born I
[1:02:50] caught the same anointing about zion.t
[1:02:52] talked about that setting up the church
[1:02:54] he he would be what the spiritual
[1:02:55] spokesman absolutely but now that was
[1:02:58] this that was the spiritual false right
[1:03:01] who is the natural just like Christ just
[1:03:05] like Christ and Julius Caesar yes who
[1:03:09] was who was the natural this man was
[1:03:14] born in 1809 the dream was born in 1909
[1:03:19] he was born in a log cabin
[1:03:21] yeah just like our prophet he was born
[1:03:24] Kentucky just like I promised membership
[1:03:41] it's earnings he was elected to Congress
[1:03:48] in nineteen eighteen forty six he says
[1:03:51] well what do you brand was commissioned
[1:03:53] by an angel like this our prophet died
[1:04:02] in 1965 Lincoln was assassinated by a
[1:04:08] group of Jesuit followers Catholics the
[1:04:12] kind of struck for the random pieces
[1:04:13] that killed him had three Catholic
[1:04:15] voices he says both these men had their
[1:04:18] faces carved in mountains well rush for
[1:04:20] a sunset mountain baby bear and as me
[1:04:23] and sister Wendy we didn't fight
[1:04:25] together we flew there separate to that
[1:04:26] meeting a couple years ago and we're in
[1:04:28] some BTO canyon and we're looking at the
[1:04:30] white sword and the rock and looked at
[1:04:32] the Eagles on Eagle Rock and looking
[1:04:34] down where the heater was look directly
[1:04:36] across the canyon and there's a face
[1:04:39] that brother branham right there in the
[1:04:40] rocks I thought that was more
[1:04:43] graphically and he's looking at that
[1:04:46] away in his mouth open like he's
[1:04:47] preaching the gospel that there has to
[1:04:54] be so and lived the exact same light you
[1:04:57] live that flute yeah
[1:04:58] click guard Opie Jesus Christ McDonald I
[1:05:00] live this kind of life and no one else
[1:05:02] did dad and the same type like he'd had
[1:05:04] enough someone yes amen and what it was
[1:05:08] Abe Lincoln what freed the slaves he
[1:05:11] said the campus

[1:05:49] face that rock aye I have a go huntin
[1:05:51] here oh that was so powerful yes sir
[1:06:07] it's amazing
[1:06:09] the first Christ and the crucifixion and
[1:06:13] when this God Himself come down in now
[1:06:16] in a prophet and what a crucifixion had
[1:06:19] to follow again yes he said that today
[1:06:22] we're taking some man's word which is a
[1:06:24] lie he is what he is what do they do
[1:06:25] they cook Morales a murder and said the
[1:06:27] son of God as the day of the first
[1:06:30] crucifixion he says any type marabous to
[1:06:32] what he's taking some man's word which
[1:06:35] is a lie and the way of death a murder
[1:06:37] which is a false word a false not he
[1:06:41] says he says and refusing to take the
[1:06:43] way I would like God's Word I condemn
[1:06:44] this generation he's a Zion diet in the
[1:06:47] world or that they're wrong he's they're
[1:06:49] guilty of crucifixion he said they're
[1:06:51] trying to crucify the spirit they call
[1:06:55] for revival everywhere here you're how
[1:06:58] are you going to everybody when the word
[1:06:59] self can't work through the people I'd
[1:07:02] like someone to answer that but what are
[1:07:04] they crucified they could not crucify
[1:07:06] the spirit so what does the price they
[1:07:10] take the denominations and their Creed's
[1:07:12] and instead of the word and that
[1:07:14] crucified his word and makes his word of
[1:07:17] no effect of the people so what was
[1:07:19] crucified was the effects of the word
[1:07:21] yes yes that's why we see a lot of
[1:07:24] religious
[1:07:25] don't even have any healing because that
[1:07:27] healing portion of the scripture that
[1:07:28] was given was crucified all right they
[1:07:31] can't enter into it because it was
[1:07:32] already dead
[1:07:33] they kill it that church comes it right
[1:07:35] brother right and when they kill the
[1:07:37] influence of what just natural or
[1:07:39] spiritual revelation there's no work
[1:07:41] there's no more of this work that's
[1:07:43] coming and they kill revelation right
[1:07:45] there right I remember it came that away
[1:07:50] the crucifixion of Christ that did that
[1:07:53] affect of the disciples of our own
[1:07:55] absolutely it'll affect us the same way
[1:07:59] it has a thickness right but remember as
[1:08:03] a crucifixion came they those people had
[1:08:05] to wait on God and get in one Accord and
[1:08:08] then what the word came for the yes amen
[1:08:13] where is our book of Acts where is it
[1:08:15] it's coming we have to get in one core
[1:08:16] raised up man
[1:08:18] amen how are those thinking about our
[1:08:20] modern times the Prophet SAW is the
[1:08:24] Anointed One the end times
[1:08:26] why would there be anointed ones at the
[1:08:29] untyped because the word said their
[1:08:45] Creflo Dollar keen ejects all these
[1:08:47] false anointed ones are riding up but
[1:08:49] that's not the true one they're getting
[1:08:51] in the way they're for murders and false
[1:08:53] forward I was really coming a maybe bad
[1:08:56] idea
[1:08:57] and as I'm reading the headlines today
[1:08:59] or not stable in this last year or so
[1:09:03] and program studies of these natural
[1:09:05] things show surge things coming that's
[1:09:08] right at the end of this year is going
[1:09:13] to take place something phenomenal it is
[1:09:17] the world's first human head transplant
[1:09:23] the 1st Corinthians 2:16 is for we have
[1:09:27] known the mind of the Lord that he may
[1:09:29] instruct him but we have the mind of
[1:09:31] Christ what is it the anointing that was
[1:09:34] that were
[1:09:35] so that we have the mind of Christ with
[1:09:36] heaven in the first days it has the
[1:09:38] heaven in this last and God is showing
[1:09:41] now there are these are science men
[1:09:42] they're tuning the science things and
[1:09:45] when the word says that what we must
[1:09:47] catch the light of God the more time
[1:09:48] know what that word is affecting them
[1:09:51] and now they was a transplant head and
[1:09:53] that's the carnal personation of God
[1:09:55] giving back to church the might of all
[1:09:57] right yeah absolutely
[1:10:04] and another thing I start seeing me
[1:10:07] rise up is all this talk of cannibalism
[1:10:09] through television and movies they're
[1:10:12] pushing cannibalism so hard right it is
[1:10:17] unreal if you just don't run and just
[1:10:19] look at some of these trailers they're
[1:10:21] putting out it's all about cameras what
[1:10:25] is this Genesis 9:3 it says every moving
[1:10:32] thing that liveth shall be meat for you
[1:10:33] even the green herb have I given you all
[1:10:36] things but flesh to the lights are up he
[1:10:38] says wishes the blood that he shall not
[1:10:40] eat so he says man you're not eating
[1:10:44] blood because what we know from the
[1:10:46] biggest 1711 the knife is in the bride a
[1:10:49] baby oh now why would this Noren team be
[1:10:52] hitting them about eating people eating
[1:10:54] this eating that blood and flesh and all
[1:10:57] that stuff remember the four beasts
[1:11:02] around the throne yes
[1:11:04] the lion the Ox the man and the eagle
[1:11:07] yes in numbers 23 24 it says behold the
[1:11:13] people shall rise up like a great lion
[1:11:15] and so lift up himself as a young knight
[1:11:17] he shall not lie down until he eats the
[1:11:19] prey and drink the blood of the slain so
[1:11:23] that lion anointing can eat the blood
[1:11:25] that's why Christ said he says eat of my
[1:11:27] flesh drink in my blood because what
[1:11:29] that first church hymns that pure church
[1:11:31] that book of Acts church could eat the
[1:11:33] literal blood of Christ a food which is
[1:11:35] what tonight they have direct communion
[1:11:37] and the pure blood or the Spirit of God
[1:11:41] Oh Joe 40 15 songs 106 20 it says the
[1:11:49] axe would eat grass the Ox always eats
[1:11:54] grass yes and it solves one of 450 knees
[1:12:02] and why the biggest glad the heart of
[1:12:04] man he says and they could order making
[1:12:07] his face to shine and a heart and that's
[1:12:08] right and bread which strengthens the
[1:12:10] man's heart in the scriptures man he
[1:12:13] shall live by that shall not live by
[1:12:15] bread alone but by every word of God man
[1:12:18] eats what the bread in the oil I'm sorry
[1:12:21] the wine yes but then we get the job 39
[1:12:25] verse 27 he says dusty Eagle bound up at
[1:12:29] thy command and make her nest on high
[1:12:31] heat Wells the device on the rock upon
[1:12:33] the crazy larog in the strong place from
[1:12:35] whence she seeketh the prey and her eyes
[1:12:38] behold far off and her young ones sucked
[1:12:40] up the blood all those four feasts that
[1:12:44] surround and protect the what the Holy
[1:12:46] Ghost church only the first in the last
[1:12:48] can drink the blood or the literal life
[1:12:50] of Christ the Holy Ghost yes rise gonna
[1:13:09] freakin it shows what that this age the
[1:13:12] anointing of that is affecting this
[1:13:15] games because the Bible said of us in
[1:13:16] Luke 17 35 says where crews body is
[1:13:19] there the yes sir
[1:13:35] Truman and then of course in the last
[1:13:39] five years this has been always control
[1:13:42] transgenderism did this take place and
[1:13:46] last day I can't imagine right actually
[1:13:51] mutilate only did that technology to
[1:13:53] mutilate themselves and may
[1:13:54] in chemicals and this is going beyond
[1:13:57] that transgender what does that
[1:14:03] represent what anointing from God is is
[1:14:07] that similar to second Corinthians 3:17
[1:14:16] he says now the Lord is that spirit and
[1:14:20] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:14:22] Liberty verse 18 but we all with open
[1:14:26] face beholding in a glass the glory of
[1:14:29] the Lord are changed into the same image
[1:14:31] from glory to glory even as the Spirit
[1:14:34] of the Lord amen and then the first John
[1:14:37] 3 once and behold what manner of love
[1:14:40] the father has bestowed unto us that we
[1:14:42] should be called the sons of God
[1:14:43] therefore the world knoweth not because
[1:14:45] it knew not him behold now we are the
[1:14:47] sons of God and it does not yet appear
[1:14:49] what we shall be but we know that when
[1:14:52] he shall appear we shall be like him and
[1:14:56] then we shall see him as he is what is
[1:14:58] this transgender movement sense of God
[1:15:01] we are going to be moving into such a
[1:15:03] state just like John the Baptist just
[1:15:06] like Christ himself they will be
[1:15:07] confusing you as someone else
[1:15:09] amen amen there's actually what the
[1:15:13] fullness of what the masculine side God
[1:15:15] will be made manifest one more time
[1:15:17] through the bride a man is speaking one
[1:15:20] of the body teams absolutely oh yeah
[1:15:22] speaking out and it is the rising of Sun
[1:15:25] 65 you've all heard this quote he says
[1:15:27] and as he the being the groom the bride
[1:15:29] has to come forward because as part of
[1:15:31] him it can only be the manifestation of
[1:15:34] the fullness of the revelation any other
[1:15:36] he spoke up of the bride
[1:15:38] it can only manifest if it does
[1:15:40] something different from the groom it
[1:15:41] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[1:15:44] his flesh and bone of his bone he's his
[1:15:47] life he says of his life he's a power of
[1:15:49] his power he is him
[1:15:59] something like humans affected now the
[1:16:01] loss and they're trying to switch over
[1:16:03] because but it's they're only a carnal
[1:16:05] personation absolutely and that goes all
[1:16:15] the way back to John 17:11 he said now
[1:16:17] I'm no more in the Lord and these are in
[1:16:18] the world I come to the Holy Father keep
[1:16:21] through thine own name those who know
[1:16:23] it's given me that they may be one as we
[1:16:25] are one
[1:16:26] he's living he says that they all may be
[1:16:28] one the Father are in me and I indeed
[1:16:31] that they may also be one in us that the
[1:16:35] world may believe that thou has sent me
[1:16:37] amen other than him and glory and the
[1:16:40] glory which thou gavest me I gave them
[1:16:43] the day may be one even as we are one
[1:16:47] God so we're seeing these things these
[1:16:50] natural types thanks God the rapture is
[1:16:52] going to happen this age because why
[1:16:55] we're seeing these things transgender
[1:16:57] we've seen the head transplants were
[1:16:58] seen and there's probably 10 or 15 more
[1:17:00] things I'm trying to study out but man
[1:17:02] these things are pointing directly
[1:17:03] they've only been getting in I mean
[1:17:06] recently ever yes study what's going to
[1:17:08] take place in the stars
[1:17:09] I think it's next month or the month
[1:17:10] after that there's a headship switchover
[1:17:13] is taking place absolutely he's coming
[1:17:17] this is the season this is the hour now
[1:17:24] but now how do we how do we get from
[1:17:27] being a cannibal how did we get from one
[1:17:29] of the scientists guys we had November
[1:17:31] what was God a beginning and Genesis 1:1
[1:17:33] he was gone he was it was the Creator he
[1:17:37] was the source or the power or the voice
[1:17:42] of everything everything came from him
[1:17:44] but when his word went forth there must
[1:17:48] be someone to receive him we have to
[1:17:55] help
[1:17:55] absolutely and the only way you can
[1:17:57] actually receive of the transmitters you
[1:18:00] have to be ready getting to that channel
[1:18:02] that's your day yeah we find ourselves
[1:18:12] in 2017 how did you know you're gonna be
[1:18:14] born we didn't know we were before here
[1:18:15] we're still going to be alive at this
[1:18:17] time absolutely right so why do you just
[1:18:19] have to view ourselves this thing of
[1:18:21] them as a receiver get into the spirit
[1:18:24] and catch the word that was not supposed
[1:18:26] to be performed in this day yeah he said
[1:18:31] I would not come back boy we just have
[1:18:33] to be able now to receive it
[1:18:34] great job baby Matthew 13 uses that
[1:18:37] crowd sees both receive the right seat
[1:18:41] into the right round it receives in
[1:18:43] there that's right even now he says
[1:18:53] always remember except the voice that
[1:18:55] followed me that said follow me you
[1:18:58] always come out right
[1:19:00] I believe you I got competency just
[1:19:02] always remember that Jesus that voice is
[1:19:05] alive in the earth tonight just the same
[1:19:09] as every voice in every word we we spoke
[1:19:12] is still alive got em mercy he says when
[1:19:14] the boy shows out onto that Etherwave in
[1:19:17] the air he says he says you got a
[1:19:19] transmitter here that picks it up he
[1:19:20] says you are the transmitter that sends
[1:19:22] it out I'll take the station he doesn't
[1:19:24] pick it up hey men talk about the word
[1:19:26] God he says that Jesus was the
[1:19:28] transmitter of God's Word
[1:19:30] he was the triune God manifested in one
[1:19:32] man he was complete God complete man
[1:19:35] yes and the transmitter said he that
[1:19:39] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:19:41] that sent me has eternal life so all of
[1:19:44] you have two moons saints of God is
[1:19:47] perceived the Word of God
[1:19:48] hey man just a couple scriptures it'll
[1:19:51] be done first that's only 2:13 for this
[1:19:56] cause also thank me God without ceasing
[1:20:00] because when you receive the Word of God
[1:20:03] she heard of us you received it not as
[1:20:05] the word of men he says but it is
[1:20:09] but as it is that's true the Word of God
[1:20:12] which effectually worketh anew in all
[1:20:13] that the after so how how do you say
[1:20:16] always you have to do is be the receiver
[1:20:18] of that word of God that one fourth hey
