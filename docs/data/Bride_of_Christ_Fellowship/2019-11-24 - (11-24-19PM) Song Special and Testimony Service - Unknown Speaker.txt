then [Music] odd let's do Stan when Christ shall come with Oh may I [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm gonna do just a couple testimonies first the first ones wanna kind of almost feel silly sharing I thought well we should never feel silly about sharing a testimony we had had trouble with these mice in our house and had traps set and normally we catch them we thought we had plugged up the spots in the house where they were getting in well these were like I'd hear him in the kitchen behind the laws and then they were up in the drop ceiling above our bed and I was hearing a running around like doing laps in the ceiling one night it woke me up and I was getting nervous about it because I thought well it's winter and I can tell there's more than one and I was afraid that there would be mice babies and then it would be really hard to get rid of them and it just came to me like I hadn't prayed about it so I prayed about it just a couple days ago and in the middle of the night when I was thinking about it and I just lord please help us get rid of these mice because I don't want him in the house and multiplying when winter's coming and they don't want to go back outside and so I thought I would have to reset these traps and maybe put him up in the ceiling or do something like that and this morning I went down in the one room where we always catch them because it's all kind of open and they were both caught and I'm so happy because they weren't they had it been freshly set or anything and they've been sitting there for weeks like the whole time we kept hearing these up in the house and so I it hit me then like I prayed about that and so I wanted to give God thanks for it because I appreciate him in the little things you know even like that so I was so thankful and then I also wanted to share just how in October I really battled a lot of sickness and I had gotten sick to my stomach and then ended up all month any time I would eat I would have really severe stomach pains for like two or three hours afterwards and it wasn't really connected to anything I was eating but it would be so bad I'd be in bed like almost in tears and I really struggled with that for it to go on so long because I felt like you know Lord I have to care of my family you know Jesse's very busy with work and then all his things afterwards and I don't like relying on my children to run the home and so I'd struggle feeling like God why I believe he was a healer and I've seen you kill other people why am I going through this and I try to take care of myself and do the right things why am i struggling and in it just got to where I was starting to understand where I feel like God sometimes needs to bring us and I know myself like through these through those times where we don't hear him answer we don't see him answer right away because it's it's in those times where I need to learn to wait on the Lord and to be patient and just to let him do it in his time in season and and through that child to like I really felt the prayers of the saints and and just seeing how like the love that some of you showed me checking in on me and stuff like it meant so much to me and so I could see also how through my child God was using it for my good and and right now where I'm reading in the scriptures like I'm in Psalms right now and I'm reading through Psalms where where the psalm writer is struggling and there it's not tied up neatly at the end you know in some of those Psalms you're seeing the human emotion and I'm I'm now reading these and I feel like I relate to that like I just felt that last month and so I'm even thankful for that because it's made the Bible you know I can I can relate to that more now through that struggle so in all things God really does work it's for our benefit and so I just thank you again offer your prayers to as our family's been sick because it it is a trial you [Music] I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me all my days I've been held in your hand from [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes I will of a good [Music] [Music]
