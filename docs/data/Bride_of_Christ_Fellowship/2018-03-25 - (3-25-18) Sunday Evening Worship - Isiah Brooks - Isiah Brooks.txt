real to us by by us sister windy so you go get the downloads for me anyway you're gonna get him we thank the Lord for His goodness and its grace I've had a wonderful fellowship with the Saints this evening and we appreciate our brother for having us here sister Whitney I'm always it's always good to see saints of God brother John and you know brother bang and all we for the bang looking married now and we appreciate him and his wife and for the Adam and his wife just thank you for your hospitality amen as we stand we're going to turn ask you to turn with us to Psalms 89 in Psalms 55 Psalms 89 you must realize tonight that we are witnesses of the word and you know we would love to have a large church more people coming but you and I must also know that we have been ordained to preach a message at a time where the earth has been or the the world in itself has been plowed over seven times we are living in what we called the gleaning time the cleaning time is when there's only a few left over it's very difficult to find true seed in this day hours think I was telling brother Jesse they said I know who I was talking with but you know a lot of times I get fish on the hook but to try it when you try to reel a man seemed like the line break up all you're getting right close to the boat and they get away but nevertheless we've got to continue to work till Jesus come we are privileged you know it's so easy it would have been easier perhaps if we had lived in a time where the revival was fresh and people coming in and we see all kinds of miracles and signs and wonders but I want you to understand that even then a lot of those people didn't stand they fell away but when you got the word that you actually living by the word itself and you don't see all of the great miracles even though you know that they are possible they're here you don't see them but we are living in a time but we're living in a faithless generation we're living in a time where there's only a few Bible says as it was in the days of nor as it was in the days of lot it was only a few they actually made it and think about this people of God you are of those few you're standing at a time where all our position is against you you don't see God in the way that they saw God you know but the greatest place where you see him is in your personal lives you see yourself overcoming you see yourself gaining victory that you know that you yourself would be it would be impossible for you to do you see yourself standing when you've seen many fall away you see yourself in love with God in a way that there is no quitting there's no giving up no matter how many times you trip no matter how many times you fall you find yourself standing again that's the grace of God to us that's a that's a covenant that God made with us being fulfilled and I am happy to be part of that whew and you must understand that that it takes a lot when I say take a lot I tell the church at home there at our church we've got a small group and you know you know we don't have anything fancy I think sister wait sister Whitney's been to our church and we've got curtains that she teased me she took my calling beyond the veil but in the spirit of it all we realized that man we're so blessed they have as many as we have yeah Enoch walked by himself you know not even his family walk with him and brother Branham said a man that one day Enoch saw his family say bye-bye you know I've seen that quote somewhere brother but my point my point is Enoch was determined to go even if no one else would and that's the kind of attitude we must have you know and so as we turn to the scriptures i wanna i i'm trying to assure you of something that your journey is not in vain psalms 89 27 to 37 also i will make with him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth my mercy will i keep for him forevermore and my covenant shall stand fast with him his seed also will i make to endure forever and it's throne as the days of heaven if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgment if they break my statutes and keep not my commandment then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquities with stripes nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail not yours his faithfulness his faithfulness to his word and to his covenant he will not suffer to fail Amen my covenant will I not break no after the thing that is gone out of my mouth no altar excuse me the things that is gone out of my lips once I have sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David his seed shall endure forever and it's thrown as a son before me if it shall be established forever as the moon and as faithful witness is heaven so low that means to meditate on this I really want you to think on this because in this you can see if there is no failure in God there's no failure in us right I was there fifty five ten and eleven one of my favorite scriptures I love this scripture I see something that I don't know what everybody else sees it but I used to one thing my mom when she lives she loved flowers and things and I was her gardener I went out there to plant the seeds and make sure the flowers grew and fertilized them and and it really became a beauty for thing to me to see those flowers and plants grow up like that and I truly said I really miss doing those kind of things I was there 55 10 and 11 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returned it not thither but watereth the earth and make it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it my the would like let's have a word of Prayer father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray father God that you were blessed a service in a special way give us what we stand in need of the Lord will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated surely God is good to us one thing I love about God is that when his word goes out he cannot alter it you know how we have seen in times where you may buy outfit or something and you know it fits at the beginning and then you may gain way to lose weight and then you have to make some alterations well God never has to alter anything every every word of God fits you and I perfectly oh I think about it now it doesn't matter how young and how old somehow the garment always fit and I think about how God's Word captures so many characters people who are so different in in their ways and their behaviors you know whether it's I was talking to Jesse about this whether you're born on the under the Aquarius side or the Gemini sign or the Arias sign or whatever sign or whatever month you were born in understand the word fits us all it doesn't matter where we're we vary in our behavior when it comes to the natural things but it's the soul where the Word of God has been placed and we you and I must understand that God has promised us now you know what a promise is see we can fail in our promises we can say oh I promise you I'll be there or I promise you out by this I promise you our sin those those songs but we fail in those things we have good intention but because we're you and we we can so easily become distracted God is never distracted God you know I don't know how he does it but I think about just the number in here I mean we're not talking about the trillions of people or beings of people that's on earth but I think about the time that all of us have needs and God can hear all of our prayers and God can answer every one of our prayer and still be on time never late ever late and and you think to yourself you said what do you mean brothers I'm saying the promise is sure and when we talk about a problems we talk about an express assurance of which of which on which expectation is is to be based in other words we we know his promises sure and as we were talking over the lunch table you know we are expecting a man that that translation we're expecting that rapture huh we've never seen a rapture before but we it has been explained to us what one is we have never seen a translation before but we know what it is and we are in expectation because God promises one we're looking for him and we're expecting it to win happen to us right when somebody base of promise will give you a promise you know it we understand that our promise is not based upon law our promise is unconditional y'all know what I'm saying it means I'm going to do for you even if you don't do for me I understand I'm gonna love you that's that's a covenant it is one that we got because we have because Abraham had that unconditional covenant and Abraham had a promise that God renege on his promise did he fail in his promise no every promise he gave Abraham he did it is that right it was so unconditional you know when I read in the scripture where Abraham lied to that King and then God got on the king and said if you don't restore the man's why I'm gonna kill you on Abraham he caused it but Abraham lied to me Lord but you see you've never seen it anywhere in the scripture where God got on Abraham for lying instead God rewarded Abraham he went into Egypt and he came out of Egypt with more riches than he did when he went in it doesn't to the natural mind it doesn't make sense but you must understand in the eyes of God Abraham was justified as though he never seen in the first place hallelujah but God let it be written there so you can see his love toward Abraham and know that the love that he had my Abraham it's the same lovey helper you he was already accepted why because in the beginning the Bible said abraham believed God and God counted it for righteousness holy in other words Abraham not only believed the message that God gave him but received the message that God gave because he believed the message that God gave him circumcision the Undercity it's that God even Charles Abraham as a father faith because he was one of those people who could look beyond what he saw and call those things that be not as though they were and that's how the bride is we are ordained we made that way we cannot help it you said what do you mean it's like a person it meant like like Malik ah who who's who's gifted and playing oh y'all hadn't seen nothing yet Amen but the gift is there you can see it and once that gift is cultivated you know and continue in it he's going to be so good and you forget about the day he started out right because that's the way it is and guess what he cannot help that he can hear music and some of us can hear music and we can't tell whether we in the key of C or a but but it is a gift understanding and that's how it is with Abraham seed it is a gift that we have a faith that can go beyond a denominational faith we can see something and not worry about because we know that God is able see is something it's just an assurance that we have once you receive the seed oh I love this because the scripture says the just in one place you said the just shall live by faith then in another scripture says the just shall live by his faith hallelujah God defines the faith that he's speaking of and the scripture also says when the Son of Man comes shall he find the thing there's only one faith and that is the face of God by faith God created the heavens in the earth by faith y'all see what I'm saying God created all things both say and then God comes along and give us that faith and what is the faith faith is not a thing faith is a person by faith Jesus Christ who was God spoken word who was God's seed created everything we looked at him but a man said he was like the logos that light that light that came out of God and you know and that's where I don't understand how in the world of God you can see the creation and you can see the power of God and you can see the move of God and you don't know how to dance well brother and I said that little pillar fire danced they let there be and all the things that are happening he started dancing around oh my god what was it it was judge I of the word what what I really loved and I'm showing you these things because you know I don't know how this morning message after had I took this message I actually preached about two or three services Amen at home about the will and you know kill the will and all that kind of stuff and you know I some of the people you know instead of being lifted they were kind of you know down you know because they saw and I tried to confessed it in my own thoughts my own will have got me in trouble many a times hallelujah and you know a lot of times you don't even know that you got a little stubborn that's going with you until our position comes and you don't feel like doing whatever it is you're supposed to be doing right it takes God people yeah understand this thing is not based upon our our doing as his doing even though listen you know we live right before before God why not because we're afraid of Hell no we live before him because we tried to show him our appreciation for what he's already done for us I don't live right to go to heaven see the seed in me cannot see it hold her y'all give me the seed in me that cannot share so God ain't looking at this looking at the sea I'm covered by the Lord so are you but I lived righteously not because Oh Lord I'm going to be condemned the Bible said there is no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and once the Spirit of God is in you you walking after him though you make mistakes there's no condemnation is that the word that's the word but I confess you know some every ever try to feel condemned when you know you're done wrong and it's just like it's just not there because what it is is you got two worlds you're working with one world you're sending heavenly places the other way are you living here right but this world knows that you're free there's really no condemnation because you've been justified but in this world you want to feel bad because you've done wrong I don't know whether I'm explaining it or not but my whole point is you want to make things right with God even though you know it's already made right am I making sense pastor but my point is you know this is me I'm speaking of me sometimes that feels so free and Oh protect it too sometimes you know it looks like Lord you know I didn't mean to do it and let me bring it that this is what I'm trying to say sometimes you want to feel so bad till at least you bring a little bit of repentance you want to do some action Lord Lord Lord you know but it don't always come like that and maybe I'm wrong sometimes I when I confess I know I'm so forgiving till I don't have to put on an act or show before God I've already confessed it I meant what I've confessed am I supposed to feel some great remorse let me move on my point is I don't know how sometimes because I know I'm forgiven and when you come to a place and you know you've already been accepted in the beloved even I'm saying you've come to a perfect faith and you know you've already you now standing in heavenly places in Christ Jesus it's kind of hard for me to say it but I can't remember Abraham ever asking God Lord forgive me just the thought you and I must understand Amen you can't be saint and sinner you either saint or you're sinner you can't be holy and unholy you either holy or unholy you understand me you can't be a black white bird or a white black bird you got to be one or the other who are you my my thing is that we have such an assurance that every sin against us has already been paid for everything brother man said we have been so justified as though we've never done it in the first place now I'm not saying a true Saint a true saint of God you will never go outside willfully doing wicked things but when you come short you already covered have you ever pray before and before you can even finish asking God to forgive you he's already answered your prayer there have been times when my walk was not straight and God still answered my prayer ha it was a covenant an unconditional covenant that God gave to us amen and sometimes we fear when we ought not to fear never say were seen are you trying to preach hypocrisy no I'm not I'm trying to say that he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty hallelujah God don't want us walking around with our head hung down hallelujah he wants us to walk in victory is that right brother Adam said we backslide every day huh now are you gonna live like a carry on like a backslider do you know you're gonna go through all that moaning and groaning are you gonna rejoice because you know you're free you know that the blow has recovered hallelujah and all when you say god I didn't mean the door boom is done hallelujah don't have to have a priest or anything because the Bible said that the blood of Jesus Christ was share for you once and for all oh god don't run can you imagine how busy Jesus would be amen of every time we made mistake he's running back and forth from the altar the blood is laying there but you saw all where's the blood it's only on top what Oh - my heart and your heart hallelujah whoo and as long as the blood is laying on the heart the heart cannot be judged or condemned put it that way am I right or wrong see God's plan remains unbroken for us it cannot be broken if you've been chosen to be bride there's nothing you can do to break it there's an think I can do to break it mmm it's a confidence it's an assurance a blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory design right because the Bible said whom God justified he's already glorified hallelujah he didn't say nothing about sanctification because sanctification comes with the justification if you're truly justified you live a sanctified life a man not sanctified life listen is this the truth the Bible tells us that brother brother limpin is where he says in the future home he said in the future home he said when when when the earth has his baptism of fire it's going to burn all the demons away from it he said and that is a type of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost huh so when the Holy Ghost comes in your soul I talk about your flesh in your spirit I said when the Holy Ghost comes in your soul there is no demon in your soul whatever dog that was in your soul God burns it out now when it comes to your spirit Satan can anoint you there Satan can anoint your flesh but he can never make a trueborn against the lever disbelieve the word ever never no matter how many that's why when you say Lord forgive me you saying Lord you wrong I'm wrong you're right it's just quick is easy and you say well what do you mean that's what keeps us free that's what keeps us in a place of not having condemnation the the power to say I'm sorry Lord forgive me you're right I'm wrong that keeps you free as I say that throughout the day young attorney it's a constant staying in pray are constant you know you're yielding a constant of surrendering amen to the will of God and the only way I can do that is to see myself wrong and see him right and because of that God keeps me right keeps us right hallelujah you can't see listen brother branham said if it wasn't for the blood we would all be dead right now remember the time he saw that oh that lady in the in the little sandwich shop purple nails and purple hair and you know dressed like a little whatever and he condemned the Lord while you let such stuff exist on the earth whoo you know if we forget where God brings it brothers from sometime hallelujah and you must understand that that you know it was easy for him to say that because he forgotten God said ho time for a conference come behind the doorman let you see some things hmm and he saw God and showed him the woman's problem God showed William Brown of his sins showed him his condition and showed him he was worthy of death himself had it not been for the ring of the blood hallelujah come a prophet of no prophet he was a sinner saved by grace hallelujah so are we and the same covenant he lived under it's the same covenant we live under let me say like this the Bible said can any man add a cubit to his stature the answer is no no Lord how will it be more faithful that's a good desire but you cannot be more faithful ain't our God give you faithfulness God I want to be more holy you cannot be more holy there's no such thing really amen holiness is a perfect state you can't be more of a a perfect right because there's no such thing is more perfect you understand me amen but when we say Oh Lord I want to be like you I want to be more like you that's a different state you can't be more like him until he grants it everything that you obtain in the spiritual realm is given by God God I want more faith faith is a gift you can't even get it until God give it you understand but the Bible tells us we have not because we ask not hallelujah and the Buffs world let me say well I don't ask God one time and he done it one time they also is a parable in the scripture of opportunity keep knocking until he answers the door God want to see how much you really wanted and how desperate you are to obtain it but in the process of our growth let me say it like this David was the anointed of God a man after God's own heart David has such a covenant with God that he messed up how many times he paid for it I don't want you to think that you're not gonna pay for whatever you do every sin he says listen you go out the way I'm going to put my ride on your butt I ain't gonna destroy you right so that's why it's so good come on y'all knows the truth well how much of a spanking a child will get if immediately when they do row and they come run to you and say buddy I did this and I'm so sorry I did it hardly ever but if I catch it where you don't done something wrong and you didn't tell me right then that's when you get your spanking and your spanking is really about the idea that you didn't tell me you did the thing I had to go search around who broke the pot you know amen so that's how it works even in God's Way when the man is ready to repent and ask for sorrow God's grace and mercy is there Oh somebody help me so you see what I'm saying it's not we have a win-win situation first of all he promised it I love the way brother branham illustrates this and he says they laughed and at Sarah and I'm Abraham and Sarah when they said it was gonna have a baby the mall folks coming in there said you know God done promised me a baby and you know we could you know and I'm sure they say you know something's wrong with them y'all don't pay him too much attention you know but the nevertheless they believe God in spite of all oh I'm gonna make a rapture oh this is what I love about this because God waited not only big till our Sara was dead he waited to Abraham couldn't produce nothing dared Abraham he laughed one time she laughed and believes that God would have destroyed her but she couldn't because she was a part of him that's why I'm so important the whole ego those of you got our own egos God can't destroy you even though you might laugh even though you might come up with some unbelief somewhere God cannot destroy you is that the word Amen he says listen you seal to the day of your return she and every train riding smooth huh you're gonna go with some bombs you gonna go over some grids you're gonna go through some tunnels you gonna ride a man and at the same time you're gonna come to your destiny and you'll be all right I love it the way God packs her sister he packed that word in us to make sure that whenever we bumped and hit something we don't rattle solid hallelujah that's what they say with any guy in a solid brother solid a minute that's the way I like it because when you see that the word is solid no cracks in it nothing can break it or destroy or alter it it just you just get a linen ride it hallelujah and you look at this thing well what do you mean brother Brooks listen if Abraham the Bible said abraham believed God and that believe was counted unto him as righteousness hallelujah and then God comes along and gives Abraham a circumcision gave it to him and let me tell you something just like God did get Abraham he's gotta be faithful to his promise that's what I read he cannot fail he can't say he couldn't fail David he can't fail you and then because we are Abraham's seed hallelujah Lord listen I'm standing on your promises I can't produce it no more than Abraham and Sarah could produce hallelujah you've got to operate on me you've got to change me in order to produce this Jesus Christ I can't producing like I am I need a supernatural hand in this right whew you show brother Bruce he said I need some strength God prophet said that Sarah nursed on the rest of Australia she received her strength he received she received her strength from him hallelujah it's all right it's all right to receive strength that's why he's a shout yeah he was there because he knew you was gonna need strength right amen and he knew you said well what do you mean brother let me go down to Jesus and I love this because Jesus amen was there at Calvary and he's there praying and he needed strength what not the god part the man part he needed strange and sometimes we need strength the solid is solid the Bible said that the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak sometimes the flesh is just weak and Lord we need strength how do you get strength go down on your knees and pray is that right because that's how Jesus received his strength Lord not my will but thine will be done and when he's submitted to God then an angel was dispatched and strengthened him because a lot of times that's all God needs from you it's submission and surrender once we submit his Orenda he will send us what we need is that all right listen Amen brother I'm talking about Sarah he said all what a beautiful type I'm worthy worthy of death when we sin but God cannot kill us because he would see we are part of Christ that's our grace because we are in union with Christ isn't that a beautiful thought union with Christ so therefore our sin when we do them we ought to quickly confess them that they're wrong see what I'm saying because God will take our life right but the blood answered in our place and God just can't cross the blood Amen wrong but he he would judges he would kill us but he can't Kaustubh learn oh and here we are in these last day we are in thee like the preacher said the culmination of all things we are in the zenith we are at the peak of a of Satan's Edom hallelujah we are at the darkest time of all history and God chose you God chose you because he knew that there is something in you that can win the battle hallelujah you and I have been ordained to outshine the doggy's hallelujah we are the stars Amen in this dark atmosphere hmm you think about it how difficult it is for us when all of the churches have gone whirling hallelujah think about how difficult it is for us Amen when we see the apostasy z' of the church when they when they call in right wrong and wrong right and yet you're standing for that which is righteous you're standing for that which is holy you're like Elijah and then you're standing up on Mount Carmel hallelujah you have a showdown now hallelujah and then not just because there that you have bear worship us but now Israel a bear worshipers hallelujah did you not know that these Christians who are called Christians are Bear worshipers everybody that believes in the Trinity they are worshiping bail hallelujah did you not know brother Branham said they are out there worshipping the devil and don't even know it because the only way you can worship God is in spirit and in truth that's what you ought to always thank God for your pastor because he's doing everything to keep you in the truth of the word hallelujah think about it Elijah he had to climb that mountain go up that mountain and at the time he gets up there now he's got a battle hallelujah you go tell those male worshipers we're gonna have a showdown here and we're gonna prove whose God is God I'd like that brother uh uh I'm looking at that third pool on this side and remember look we're gonna show who's God is God is that right brother branham's here at the Mount Zion showdown is when the bride of Jesus Christ is raptured death will show you whose side you belong and that'll sell you so show the church they were on the wrong side hallelujah amen a larger crime that melting fixture on the top of the mountain and after all of that he said hey ham I'm gonna have a little grace on you you better pack up and get down real quick because it's going to rain but I want you to show the power of the seat think about it now he was a Elijah he's a seed of God but I want to show you that when the streets try on during that time and that pool Amen when when God anointed Elijah he outran the chariot hallelujah don't you understand Amen when that anointing Coghlan at third Pope's fully gets into swing we won't have to worry about nothing because of the seed that's in you God Jesus Christ will like a flower will open up in his fullness and we'll see God in a way we've never seen him before hallelujah we don't have to worry about these automobiles and all of this electric stuff and digital stuff that can find us wherever they want to find that they can't find us if we're hiding in another dimension Lauren area is that right that's what David said amen in Psalm 27 he shall hide me in a secret place he hardly it is prevailed Oh somebody help me you and I must understand that if Jesus walk through the crowd will be able to walk through the crowd if Jesus walked through the world will be able to walk through the wall hallelujah we won't have to try every what we are made out of that right will speed up in their slow down whoo I would have loved to see that old man out riding that chariot down the mountain hallelujah God is so good to us we have word let us never be ashamed of who we are don't be ashamed brother branham let me say it like this you know I I try to be cautious because I don't want nobody to think I'm worshipping him but I'm not ashamed of the name you understand me I'm not ashamed of the name I'm not ashamed of what he what he did for us but I want to be careful because my God is jealous I want to make sure I salt Jesus Christ higher than the name William Brennan you see them saying Amen because I want God to know that I would have a revelation it wasn't Elijah it was the God behind the elijah is that right amen think about it we've got such power in in our genes we don't know what to do with him hallelujah but if John was able to withstand being bald three days in oil you and I are two that's power Oh y'all come on come on that's powerful holiday dude I can't even hardly stand hot water to hit me more or less oil boiled three days in a pot of oil what was that the Holy Ghost hallelujah the Holy Ghost had infiltrated every fiber of his being amen in the oil listen limitation when you got fire only inside that fire would join with any other fire is that right it's the truth your fire and God is fire put fire with fire it's just become a bigger fire hallelujah and so we realize by God's grace I'm trying to assure you people we don't have to worry don't let the Satan put such a worry on you and oh my god how am I do this and how am I do that God never told us of worry and understand worrying is a lack of faith it's the absence of faith right so when you got when you were in it oh my god but I believe God no you don't you don't believe God when you whirring I'm sorry you just don't you're trying to but you're not right because when you work when you have faith you spend like the Rock of Gibraltar hallelujah they're not varying you you're not double minded but when you worry you double minded Lord I believe you oh well our own well yes Lord you're just too intro but faith is solid hallelujah hey man the delecate do nothing with faith hallelujah yeah I understand me so we look at this thing you should all other Brooks you know what we supposed to be doing and this is what the devil has taken away from us revelation 22:17 says and the spirit and the bride say come that's our ministry we supposed to be inviting people in this time this is our hour of evangelism this is our hour of saying come come come but the devil God is also busy we don't have time to witness but our job for the Lord is to say come whosoever will let him come where do you think this is going to take place at the wild salvation today of salvation for the Gentiles will be over it's got to be now oh we don't we know we're not going to get a whole group of people if we do it reeling from the Lord but my point is there still some out there because we haven't been translated do what you can do people get out there as the bride not as a church but as a bride and know that the people know we believe Hebrews 13 and eight Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah I got some people I've got to work with when I get back home this man is dying any men but I'm trying to get to him his wife I had to come this way cuz I believe if God can conquer death in the Old Testament he conquered in the New Testament and he can conquer today I just don't believe if a man really trust God God I have mercy on you is that right I've heard listen to the blood prophet of God many times he's a now if God will heal you will you surrender your heart to the Lord will you give your life to God if God should heal you he said now I can't promise that he will but if he would right see that's what we we should approach people you see them in wheelchairs and things like this he said well I know about miracles I've seen them I know they're real and I'm not saying God will do it for you but one thing for certain you don't want to go leave this life a man without God on your side you won't be crippled here being crippled in hell you say well you shouldn't say it so rough you better say it rough sometimes you have to say it rough it meant to get daily teach you to jog them a little bit I don't try to O Lord not to offend people being so light on them and everything else and then something happen to him then I'm the one feeling guilty because I feel like I wasn't strong enough when I said what I said you understand me Amen I don't want nobody to die on me because I didn't tell them everything and sometimes you may not get but one chance right you put the meat on the hook you don't know how much it's going to nibble on it might take the whole the meat and the whole hook right but you trying to tell the fish you're trying to give the fish a little nibble nibble off that hook all the day without taking that hook but you want him to take the hook so how do you do that you had to look behind the me or whatever hell's you fix you with ain't God good to us listen here's John with with with will notice he said you will notice that John had addressed himself to the Christians and the brother in tribulation I love that because you know what everybody said when we John types the bride but we don't want we don't want we don't want to see the two relation but tribulation came with John the bride y'all understand me when he was out on the Isle of Patmos it was not easy for him he had a time of constant tribulation when they couldn't kill him they put him on an hour patmos and that's when he received the revelations of Jesus Christ so you got to understand that your tribulations whatever trials you going through is a journey for you and that journey will take you closer to God's revelation and will for your life you said that's not true but that's exactly what happened to Joe Joe was a righteous man that God the Word of God said he was a perfect and upright man is that right amen but his trials and tribulation took him where God needed him to be is that was only a sheet and it was there only a sheep is when he got closer to God because God unveiled to him that he was going to be in the resurrection he said I know the skin wounds eat up my fresh in my flesh shall see God can you imagine when Jesus rose from the dead and John Shawn said that's the man you talking about a Jubilee oh my god I know that dimension that they were in couldn't hardly wait to release them because they were tearing it up yeah I gotta get up out of here oh my god listen I'm almost done I was gonna preach it on but I want you to see a special class of people brother Branham says so he said you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work is in the future ages then I will mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation and we will fail to get it or we would fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take an operation of the Holy Ghost that makes this book makes this book can be revealed to anyone to make this book see it can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people so you got to understand you're not just people you now you're hand-picked you know God has set you aside I could remember when I was a boy in most of the reality problem anyhow when I was a boy we used to play marbles y'all know about marbles Jesse says no but down in the country we played marbles and you had a bag of my order was the prettiest little glass bottle of brown balls it was the prettiest we called him cat eyes and all kind of things you know and then we got the big one called the bomb you know that was your that was your big you know you take that one and you break it up like that with a back and then scatter it all out well you know every little boy had his special that he would used her you know knock it out and ring and all that and that's what you out of God you that special marvel that he uses to knock Satan out of the ring see you had a lot of marbles but this one was special and that's the way God has used us and and I look at this thing and we we worry sometime we threaten we say Oh a lot but don't you understand he saved the best wine for last the first shall be last you God's greatest secret weapon outside of Jesus himself huh Oh y'all gettin quiet don't you understand we're the ones that would defeat Satan in the end we were beasts come on Satan has been able to hold people in this dimension how long he couldn't hold Jesus right he couldn't hold Moses nor Elijah but now God has created a people that would defeat his hole all together hallelujah I don't mean just getting up out of the grave I mean there be those who won't even go to the green and you think about that what was God doing happiness he was just sowing the seed for this day ooh what's nice just powerful to me and you think about you sure what what do you mean but other books that life in you that God is quicker than you has it's far more powerful than you can imagine if God said that that power will amen and you can speak the world and your existence and go live on it I don't think he was just talking because this is just a small portion of time for eternity we got a lot more to do and God is not explaining to us what it all is but I believe that God don't put creation ability in you for the purpose of just having it there God is not a God of vanity and at some place in that eternity you're not gonna be doing things just like God did and you say brother Brooks you really going far with it but I'll tell you this he didn't let Lucifer being a creator and if it was God's Word listen brother I said God is not God is omniscient he's omnipresent he said but he's not everywhere like we think he is he said because now God is a person and he said God will never go back to being what he used to be my cuz now he's got children he's in you he's in you he could remain he could remain where he was but he's now he's got a family hmm why would God put oh Lord let me say it like this and maybe I'm stepping out too far but let me say it like this you've heard me say this before now I'm just pricking your thought just making sure you think about these things because that's what I see that's what I see it may be I'm beyond myself and I won't say I say these are my words let me say it can I drop some words on you uh when you was in the womb of your mother you had hands you had feet you had eyes you had now and you didn't need none of that to live you lived off for her you didn't have to walk she walk for you you didn't have to clap your hands or anything she did that for you but those things that the way you was created wasn't for the belly it was for the world you were created that so you can do something here so when you're born again supernaturally you're born in the womb of the earth or in this world supernaturally not for this place but for the place to come see by faith God created see that's the first thing he did remember I said like this among the Jewish tradition and culture they said to kill a man is to kill a universe you know how because of the seeds that's in him that'll never be planted that'll never grow think about what band Adam has created all of this all these seeds all over where one man it becomes eternity itself you understand me infinity almost because of one man one tree that they said you can count the apples in the tree but you can't count the seeds in the Apple right how it goes but you know you know what I'm saying so you say well what do you mean brother books to have a son mean it continues it continues it continues it continues amen even even the even among thee the customs of the world where they didn't believe in God but they believed in having sons because sons continued the seed is that right amen you saw that in the law with Judah didn't give his sons to it tomorrow right amen but my sister arm I didn't marry into this family to become childless hallelujah and if you're not gonna give me your sons I'm going to the original one who I loved it I loved it cuz she went to the original and then she brought forth seeds of Judah now you tell me that ain't God how you hear me because she knew Amen that somehow if I could get to do to God will anoint my desire and give me an impregnation I'm sure she didn't know she was gonna have twins but at the same time God rewarded her because of her faith am I making sense so my point is God will continue eternally and he will ever be eternal nothing can stop him because after this is over there will never be another multiplication of sons and that's why the Bible said there was a number that no man can know oh I wish I could tell you like I see it but I tell you one thing you'll see one day you're gonna see me up then you say well brethren I remember that I thought [Laughter] but I found out you're right I got me a planet over here a universe over here you are a young man brother hallelujah but my point is if God says ye are gods you cannot be a God without what mmm creation and see the truth of the matter is God will not share your glory his glory with anyone but the Bible says I saw the bride descending with the glory of God she didn't have her own glory he was her glory hallelujah and you know and I know that every man shares his glory with his wife and his wife and he are not to their one am I making sense oh because I won't to understand this is just the beginning this is just the beginning I have not seen is it not hurt you got to understand this is just the beginning and to miss heaven for this you got to be out of your mind you got to be out of your mind that's like trading me a penny for a million I'll give you a million dollars with my penny ticket no I'm keeping my opinion brother I like the color of it uh uh you know what I'm saying it doesn't make sense that the training is not it just doesn't make sense but when you see what God has given you eternal life let me taste I'm God there will never be a boring and I'm a closing just a minute one more thought this okay i'ma close with Isaiah 59 19 through 21 there's so much I wanted to say but i'ma cut it short he said so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and its glory from the rising of the sun when the enemies shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turned from transgressions in Jacob saith the Lord now I want you understand that he's working with the bride of Jesus Christ and he also Amen is telling you that the Redeemer see God would rise up a standard you know it ain't us me understand it is the God in us that's rising up a standard and and not of people don't even think we're standards now but sister brother you're the standard but everything else has been so perverted and looking like all kinds of stuff you are the standard when I look at you I look at our sisters I'm looking at real men and women you understand me you don't even you look what I'm just being me but you don't understand you're the standard you got God set you here as a testimony of what a man and a woman supposed to look like right you are standard and no matter what people's gonna look at you and make and they're gonna notice it because they're conscious is gonna show them that you're right even though they don't want to do it they know you're right but they don't want to do it they will is in the way I know I'm a hurry up cuz I we love the Lord amen and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them turn the transgression and the Jacob said the Lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of our mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of that CC said the Lord from his fourth end forever that means that you can't get away from him cuz when God seals himself in he's in amen when he says I'll never leave you nor forsake you he actually put himself in there he said I can't leave me not forsaken because I've sealed in here hallelujah and I will be with you always and that's why the delegate oh you feel so lonely and God knows because I'm a sensitive person he attacks me with that a lot you know and because you got a lot of people around you doesn't mean that you can't be lonely sometimes Amen you are lonely when people are all around why because there's certain needs or certain things that you desire to have but there's not you know what I mean that kind of person or whatever and you said well Lord you know what must I do and then God says well remember me I'm always with you and sometimes God allowed those lonely feelings Amen for us to turn to him so that he can become a friend hey that's Stan I want be my friend I need him as my friend I know he's my Savior and you know in sharing one more thing in closing if you could know your origin you know you came from God you go back to God right for example well let's say I use use something in comparison yes let's use these two bottles even though they you know they both olive oils but let me see this oil or this bottle is have a different origin maybe it came from Africa maybe it came from India I don't know but my point is though these olive oils look the same they're not they came from two different origins so therefore they're different species or different brand I'm not making sense if I came from this oil if I came to this oil and and and somehow in other words if I came from this oil I can't I can't return to this bottle because this is not where I came from if there was a returning of the oil I must return to the oriole I came from right so let's put it this way one of these bottles represents God and the other one represents Satan do Satan have children yeah oh yeah oh yeah Judas was one of the top once a minute and you and does God have children well all of God's children came out of his bottle and if it's going to ever be refilled it must be filled with the same substance that came out of there in other words I can't feel that's put let's say that's still using oil cuz it's pretty bad but if I got a water in here I can't come from this oil and put it in this bottle of water cuz it'll never mix but if I came from oil that means if I put the oil in here you'll never know I'll blend right in there right so what I'm trying to say is Satan's children is water and when they go back they must return to what they came from their origin is water you can't put the water in the oil it won't fit it won't blend so when you know you came from God why are you worried about going back here you can never go to hell if you came from God if you truly sons and daughters of God you could never go to hell well you say well the sons of God saw the daughters of men and they always lost they were sons of God because they were made in the image of Adam but in their souls that were serpents God had to give them recognition because of what they look like their appearance y'all understand me so you said what do you mean don't you realize the Bible said that the serpents shall bruise the head and the the heel and and in God's each to bruise the head and who was that that's right and who was the Serpent's those religious men they look like men but God called them serpents and that's what it is today you got serpents that look like men that literally look like sons and daughters of God preaching in the pulpit and everything else you said how would their preacher that daddy used to preach Satan preached the first sermons and to Eve 2nd one anyway he proceeded and his children are preachers but they all preach a lie so you got to understand don't fear if you know that you came from God there's only one place you can return and back to ass back to God you should all brother Brooks what are you what are you trying to say well remember brother man said that man died a drunkard and he was saved saw a man fail God and he was saved hallelujah Solomon Dada idolaters and he was saved hmm David had so much blood on his hand but he was saying yeah it's all my goodness what are you talking about Peter Amen tada Jesus Christ three times and he would say Judas did not him and cursed him one time betrayed him when tiny and was lost y'all hear me see those who come from God go back to God those who came from the devil go back to the devil we are here to express the angelic or the power of God that stood with God in the beginning and those who came from Satan are those fallen angels who are here to express what the Fallen Angels did from the beginning mm-hmm that's good stuff to me I don't know who I'm bragging on me I'm bragging of God like the Dave said it's sweeter than the honey in the comb let's pray I know we're tired thank you for your your attention father we come before you lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord you've been so good to us O Lord we just love you we love your services we love being in your presence we thank you now we pray that you bless the church tonight Lord assure them that the way has already been made this it can't be altered and you said by your word Lord that this it was finished before the foundation of the world it's already completed even though we go through these things even though the children of Israel amen went through the wilderness and everything that was already settled before they even denied God Lord God knew what was going to happen they knew he was they would murmur than complain he knew that they would learn and complain he knew that they wouldn't enter in even when they started out but they had to fulfill those things and those thoughts that was in his mind Lord and he knew those who would come out as conquerors he knew Joshua and Caleb before the foundation of the world father even so God you know us you knew what time we would come the battles we would fight the battles we would in the ones we would lose and father you saw our total victory in your dear son Jesus Christ that's why he had to come he had to die for us he had to live for us he had to share his blood for us he's our hero Lord he is our victor hallelujah because of him hallelujah we can rally like the Israelites did and run out of the Philistines Lord after the Goliath was killed and farther you destroyed the works of the devil Lord when you went down to hell you took the keys of death hell and the grave you came back hallelujah with the head of Goliath in your hands showing hallelujah that victory had been accomplished you led captivity captive Lord and gave gifts unto me father we are free creatures new creatures birth Lord under the Seventh Seal hallelujah oh yes a new creation Lord a creation of God himself thank you Father for being so real to us thank you for loving us the way you do Lord bless this assembly Lord may it prosper spiritually may it prospering growth Lord whatever the hindrances are if there are any we bind the devil right now in the name of Jesus Christ and Satan we command you to take your hands off of this assembly I don't care where you may be hiding the Lord Jesus know where you are and right now I bind you right now I speak prosperity in this place though I speak Lord Liberty in this place Lord in the name of Jesus Christ let your will and perfect will be done father oh that would be save in this area I pray Lord that you would draw them Lord but you said if we lift you up you would draw all men unto your Lord if there are seas out there I pray father God that you are not these people hallelujah not your children Oh God that they would witness and not be ashamed of God hallelujah whether they are received or rejected there will become the talk of this place blessed him now give them grace strengthen them Lord make them one because in unity there is strength Lord God help right now in your hands [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey you just keep on praying and the Lord will answer you he hears your prayers you know I love the fact that Kunia is praised so much it went up before God as a memorial hallelujah whoa the monument almost stack don't stack those that you know the Lord amen amen amen see anybody got a song we're saying one more and then we'll give it over to the pastor okay hang in there I heard somebody maybe just me country to it no sad good they will be spoken for time man I shall be eatin sweet yeah so I trust that you won't go out there and say brother Brooks made a new doctrine I was just giving you my thoughts and how I levitated on God's Word and when I meditate on God word it just takes me places you know I believe that what it's all about sometimes God opens up things to you and you said well well well it's in there if you could see it if you can't see it it's not in there God's Word is spiritual and sometimes it's out to be spiritually it has to be not sometime all the time it has to be spiritually discerned and remember sometimes God will tell you secrets things that he won't tell somebody else sometimes I feel bad because I'm thinking well did I tell a secret but you don't have to believe all of the extra I'm not trying to add to the word or take from it but I just say consider consider some of the things I've said and and you'll see that you can't make this it this is not on it this is the beginning of something far far more beautiful than we can imagine and I'm expect a ssin first of all to get rid of that thing you know the devil and that's alright cousin out in Arizona they won't even call his name they say what what you would call it something like that what you what you would call it as um y'all knew him come on what you call it oh my god what how they say it but anyway there's no Nate no power in his name it's really as a sad situation Lucifer is a sad situation and all of his followers you know because you know we know that this is the only day that we have seen the world fall elusive er with their eyes open because they really believe that he's God and they really believe that Jesus Christ was defeated you know that's last Pope we got there said Jesus made a mistake by allowing himself to be crucified no he did that's the greatest thing he said he could have ever done I'm so glad he did that for me aren't you glad amen if I passed with command dismissed or whatever he needs to do appreciate you having me I'll be back in another year or so much forgive me that's y'all pray for me please pray for me I need that to stop that's a little weakness of mine please pray for me I need that to stop verse God in other words we see tinnitus God sees as a finished finished product just like God's all job is a finished project he's perfect you know we battled so much with the flesh we forget sometimes the god season is finished profit a man that's it a spotless bride with no blemish there's no sin I mean it's just a beautiful thing bless it is a man when the Lord will not impute iniquity what a blessing that's just good Lord Ralph always boggles your mind how could God how could Abraham make the mistake and then the king pays for it was Abraham was elect God knew Abraham was later gonna train shows mommy's important position that's the point of a church God saw what Abraham was gonna be by the end he struggled struggle here here there but God kept blessing him blessing because God saw was inside of him that real seat of faith aren't you glad you got faith inside of you he [Applause] might be the despised might repeat the rejected now but by the grace of God in heaven we're gonna be the Queen in heaven I praise the Lord Amen hallelujah praise the Lord Amen that's just the promise of God and we appreciate our brother coming thank you brother for coming all the way here it was perfect timing I was sick I'm tired my family's worn out
