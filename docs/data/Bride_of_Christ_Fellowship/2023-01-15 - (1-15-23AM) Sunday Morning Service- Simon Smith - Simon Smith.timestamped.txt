[41:26] yeah it's USBC
[41:29] all right
[41:32] better so I learned that I have a little
[41:34] another Port here in the old
[41:37] computer
[41:38] that will work I don't know
[41:43] this will help
[41:50] see if this works here by God's grace
[41:52] have everybody feeling good this morning
[41:56] you know my life is maybe much like your
[41:59] own
[42:00] run yourself ragged all week and push
[42:03] and push and
[42:06] up late tired
[42:08] doing things staying up too late not for
[42:11] you know
[42:12] batteries and just doing Pride burn the
[42:15] candle both ends and just
[42:17] uh you know so
[42:20] we were asked my wife I was so tired
[42:23] so we're gonna we're gonna press on here
[42:26] by God's grace so okay here we go all
[42:27] right that's good all right praise the
[42:29] Lord so
[42:31] let's turn to John 15 by God's grace and
[42:34] we'll uh this just been on my heart here
[42:37] I saw just a couple things you know
[42:44] I'm just trying to think of you know
[42:46] waiting for some inspiration to strike
[42:48] on what the Lord would have me to teach
[42:49] and
[42:50] uh this is a
[42:52] been burning on my heart again here
[42:54] recently and
[42:57] I just wanted to kind of reiterate on
[42:59] these things
[43:01] foreign
[43:05] 15
[43:07] 5
[43:10] through 7 we'll say these that will read
[43:13] these scriptures if we stand here just
[43:16] reading the word of God and it's um kind
[43:20] of comes as a conviction here as well
[43:22] you know
[43:23] putting more emphasis on the word of God
[43:25] and those sort of things
[43:27] because these words are not just words
[43:28] These Are Spiritual
[43:30] words so
[43:34] let's see here in John 15 5 he says I am
[43:39] the vine he says ye are the branches
[43:42] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[43:45] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[43:47] without me ye can do nothing amen isn't
[43:50] that the truth if a man abide not in me
[43:52] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[43:55] withered and Men gather at them and cast
[43:57] them into the fire and they are burned
[44:00] if he abide in me and my words abide in
[44:04] you
[44:05] ye shall ask what ye will and it shall
[44:08] be done unto you
[44:11] so let's say a word of Prayer
[44:14] dearly father Lord Jesus Lord we love
[44:16] you so much Lord bless the Lord the
[44:18] hearers Lord of this little study God
[44:20] lord and Lord God we pray Lord to
[44:22] resonates Lord through our souls Lord
[44:25] through our minds and our hearts God
[44:26] lord and Lord Jesus Lord we certainly
[44:29] love and appreciate you Lord for calling
[44:31] us Lord to this message Lord to this
[44:34] revealed word in this hour Lord Lord if
[44:37] we think back to uh what we could have
[44:39] been or where we could be right now
[44:41] without your Amazing Grace and salvation
[44:44] Lord
[44:45] makes me tremble Lord God and just
[44:48] a terrifying thought God but Lord God
[44:50] you have preserved us Lord into Thy word
[44:53] Lord and brought us to a full salvation
[44:55] God and we're so thankful for those
[44:57] things Lord
[44:59] and we're just blessed to hear the word
[45:00] God help me to get beside myself Lord
[45:03] just uh speak whatever he had placed in
[45:06] my mind here Lord God we love you so
[45:07] much in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[45:10] you may have your seats
[45:24] I noticed there's a like a row missing
[45:26] here a little bit you guys were closer
[45:28] last time
[45:33] now that's why you take seats out of
[45:36] churches so you can dance
[45:39] and it kind of gathers you together even
[45:41] more a little bit you just gets the
[45:42] everything a little more happier in the
[45:44] family and uh sister who sorry uh for
[45:47] your loss there and brother Jesse's
[45:50] mention that in the back and that's just
[45:51] a tremendous loss and
[45:53] May Lord bless brother Amen brother Vang
[45:57] um
[45:58] and you
[46:00] may God give you strength in this hour
[46:03] if there's anything you would need let
[46:04] us know and we can
[46:06] do what we can there we're Living Waters
[46:08] Tabernacle to help this assembly as well
[46:10] whatever it would take we will try by
[46:13] God's grace

[46:32] that pushed through
[46:35] so yeah this morning I'd like to I'd
[46:38] like to speak on this here by God's
[46:40] grace he says I am the vine and you're
[46:42] the branches he that abideth and me and
[46:43] I in him the same bringeth forth much
[46:45] fruit and without me you can do nothing
[46:47] saints of God and that's why we need uh
[46:50] to be walking with the Lord you know and
[46:53] uh
[46:54] it makes you wonder you know how the
[46:56] Lord in Genesis
[46:58] um and I believe is Genesis 3 there and
[47:00] how God sealed up he sealed up the
[47:03] garden he sealed up the tree of life he
[47:05] sealed it with the cherubims and and you
[47:08] know he said he said if you could just
[47:09] get back to this tree you would uh live
[47:12] forever you know Adam and Eve I'm sure
[47:14] longed in their hearts to see to get to
[47:16] a time where they could maybe God would
[47:18] ReStore in their age in their day in
[47:20] their lifetime
[47:21] hoping that the Lord would do something
[47:23] because they came from Perfection and
[47:25] they went to corruption now and those
[47:28] sort of things and they're leaving and
[47:30] although I'm sure dreaming that maybe
[47:32] that they would still be have a chance
[47:34] at not dying and yet we find within
[47:37] seven generations there Rises up a man
[47:43] he did not die
[47:47] but the promise was that if you get back
[47:49] to the tree of life you live forever and
[47:51] here was a man that somehow
[47:53] something must have taken place
[47:57] and the beautiful thing is about the
[48:00] word of God and and those sort of things
[48:02] is that you know the the word of God was
[48:04] in the mind of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[48:06] Christ from the foundations of the world
[48:10] and the Word was all there and not only
[48:12] that but the lamb now let me give you
[48:15] the lamb was slain from the foundations
[48:20] of the world so Enoch nonetheless
[48:24] prophesied being a prophet was able to
[48:27] tap into some kind of Revelation there
[48:30] and he knew that it was already finished
[48:32] even before it started
[48:35] and saints of God whereas we are as the
[48:37] prophet God would say he says we're
[48:38] waiting for that rapturing faith that we
[48:41] that rapsing Revelation as we see these
[48:44] things coming so and this might be a
[48:47] simple topic but I I really believe this
[48:49] is coming
[48:50] um
[48:51] rapidly as I was on a certain job site
[48:55] and uh we want to want to teach on and
[48:58] just kind of speak on this for a moment
[49:00] the the absolute
[49:03] and uh
[49:04] that's a very important topic and
[49:08] and it kind of got something got brought
[49:10] right to me I was in a in a Job trailer
[49:12] there a parts trailer there maybe we
[49:15] call like a tool crib or whatever and
[49:17] getting some material for my
[49:21] the thing that uh your dad told me to do
[49:23] I was working for your dad for a moment
[49:25] there and uh we were trying to uh find
[49:29] some locate some material and then here
[49:31] was another man there and
[49:34] he started striking up a conversation on
[49:37] cane seed line
[49:41] and yeah he looked at me and he's a fine
[49:43] gentleman a very kind and sweet and
[49:47] um
[49:48] he loves the Lord to the best he knows
[49:51] how and he mentioned something to me he
[49:54] says he's because I've I think we've
[49:56] spoken to him before on these things and
[49:58] he said Simon he says can a cane seed
[50:01] line make it to Heaven if they repent
[50:03] and I said well
[50:05] I said according to scripture you know
[50:07] God bless you according to scripture uh
[50:11] the only way someone can get to heaven
[50:13] is if they repent correct and I said
[50:16] well brother I said I've got a video for
[50:18] you you need to watch and we at home we
[50:20] just start making trying to help the
[50:22] help brother Justice work here in Akron
[50:24] making a uh and we did a servant Seed
[50:26] video and I sent that to him
[50:28] and this brother here he's a very
[50:32] Catholic very heavy Catholic uh they're
[50:35] waiting for the third revelation of the
[50:36] Fatima which is supposedly their secret
[50:38] the Catholic secret revelation of God
[50:41] blessed sisters of what is coming here
[50:43] and what is to be released to the
[50:45] Catholic church and to bring forth and
[50:46] Usher in something tremendous for them
[50:48] so uh they're waiting on those sort of
[50:51] things
[50:52] um
[50:52] so I had sent that video to them and I I
[50:55] it was a couple years or maybe a year or
[50:57] so plus I recorded that and I'd
[51:00] forgotten at the end that I had actually
[51:01] to I had brought forth the Catholic
[51:04] church and sort of those things at the
[51:06] end there and he comes up to me the next
[51:08] day and he said Simon and he was kind of
[51:11] right there and he said Simon you know
[51:13] you hammered the Catholic Church pretty
[51:15] heavy there and I said well brother I
[51:16] said
[51:18] did you look at St Peter's Basilica is
[51:20] that not built in the form of a serpent
[51:23] or a snake is it not crowned and then of
[51:27] course having my phone on me real quick
[51:28] I pulled up the audience Hall and I said
[51:30] what does this look like and he says
[51:32] that looks like the mouth of a of a
[51:34] snake I said exactly and that's directly
[51:37] right next to Saint Peter's Basilica as
[51:40] well so here we say we have two
[51:42] architectural buildings that were
[51:44] designed to look according to those sort
[51:47] of things I said brother no you've got
[51:49] to explain those things first
[51:51] and I think obviously the service seed
[51:54] study will clear up anything to do with
[51:56] eternal life and that seed line and as I
[52:00] mentioned John the Baptist said who has
[52:02] warned you to flee from the wrath of God
[52:05] and he said he said what did John the
[52:07] Baptist tell them I said he said bring
[52:09] forth fruits for repentance right amen
[52:12] so
[52:13] but as we're talking in there he
[52:15] mentioned something very interesting and
[52:18] he said he said Simon he says we've got
[52:20] to come together and I said what do you
[52:23] mean and he said and he brought forth
[52:25] this scripture right here now I remember
[52:27] where Tony Palmer had mentioned this and
[52:30] it was prophesied when in 1965 dealing
[52:34] with this thing he says remember this
[52:36] great thing would come he said the
[52:38] invitation will come to this great
[52:40] church and all these things and the
[52:42] whole world is going to be given this
[52:44] opportunity to come in and now notice
[52:46] what and the prophet of God broke this
[52:49] down saints of God this is not something
[52:50] that's mysterious this is right here
[52:52] this was not spoken in private this is
[52:54] not many times what when we first come
[52:56] in the message we use the church age
[52:58] book as just witnessing as a track we
[53:00] just gave it to people their dollar a
[53:02] piece and we just bought 100 or 200 at a
[53:04] time and just passed them out to
[53:05] wherever we met and what no that thing
[53:07] was what laying in here
[53:09] and he said he said what did God say he
[53:11] says I will keep thee from the hour of
[53:13] Temptation which shall come upon the
[53:14] world to try them which in other words
[53:16] there's a Temptation coming to give in
[53:19] right and as he said and the prophet of
[53:21] God broke it down by Revelation this is
[53:23] exactly how this is going to work
[53:26] he says the Temptation exactly like the
[53:28] Temptation Of Eden it will be a very
[53:30] inviting proposition held up in direct
[53:33] opposition to God's commanded word but
[53:36] now notice what are they going to pull
[53:37] from they're going to pull from this
[53:39] right this was exactly what the prophet
[53:41] of God said he said he says now notice
[53:43] Christ said he says neither pray I for
[53:45] these alone but then for all true which
[53:47] also or which Shall Believe on me
[53:49] through their word he said that they may
[53:52] be one as thou father are to me and I
[53:54] and thee that they may also be one in us
[53:57] that the world may believe that thou has
[54:00] sent me right
[54:01] he says in the glory which thou gaveth
[54:04] me uh I have given them that they may be
[54:06] one even as we are one he said Simon he
[54:08] says we've got to come together and be
[54:11] one and as I stood there all these
[54:14] things are running through my mind
[54:18] the running now what was he using he was
[54:20] using the scripture he was using what
[54:23] the absolute and he brought forth this
[54:27] scripture
[54:29] and it's this obviously obviously these
[54:32] things are familiar in our minds why
[54:33] because these are very important
[54:36] indications these are pinpointed ways
[54:40] that the the prophet of God was by the
[54:42] spirit of God what was able to pinpoint
[54:44] this way that the way and the scripture
[54:47] and the way this thing was going to come
[54:48] about right and he you and it just blew
[54:51] my mind this man here would use the
[54:53] exact same scripture and I called him
[54:55] out I said brother now that is true in
[54:57] one sense
[54:58] but there's also another sense in which
[55:01] it's untrue even though it be the word
[55:03] of God but what I was like this what is
[55:05] the absolute right now notice what he
[55:08] says here he says
[55:10] and I told him and I and I almost buy
[55:12] the best my memory could handle is I
[55:15] tried to reiterate what this was being
[55:16] Spoken Here I said it'll be so
[55:18] enlightening so very right and
[55:21] life-giving as to fool the world and
[55:23] what are they going to use to fool the
[55:25] world he says uh only the very light
[55:27] will not be fooled the Temptation will
[55:29] come as follows the economical move I
[55:30] said saint I said brother I said this
[55:33] thing's going to come down to this
[55:35] and I asked him one question I said what
[55:37] is salvation what is Salvation And he
[55:41] says well it's in Jesus I said that's
[55:43] exactly right
[55:46] I said someone who is saved must be
[55:48] saved by who the Lord Jesus Christ and
[55:51] Christ Alone Now notice what are they
[55:55] going to say
[55:57] they're going to use this scripture he
[55:59] says that we might become one he says
[56:01] and it's going to look like what this is
[56:03] going to bring Salvation to the entire
[56:05] world
[56:07] but I said it I said now remember when
[56:10] this uh when this opportunity this this
[56:12] this decision time comes upon the face
[56:15] of the Earth that people will have to
[56:17] look at this we'll have to hear this and
[56:18] they're going to have to make a decision
[56:20] and they're going to think they're going
[56:22] to think in their minds that by joining
[56:24] up
[56:25] or entering into this Council or this
[56:27] economical move he says that that will
[56:30] be salvation to them but I told them I
[56:33] said it'll be Jesus Christ and Jesus
[56:35] Christ alone and that is it you cannot
[56:38] add or what take away right absolutely
[56:41] so though they're going to use the same
[56:43] scripture or pulled from what the very
[56:45] absolute of God uh um they're going to
[56:49] have the wrong interpretation right
[56:51] right now these things are done now of
[56:53] course uh in these in this instance here
[56:56] I was kind of uh kind of Blown Away by
[56:59] by this moment here and it made me think
[57:01] about going back to the absolute because
[57:04] now remember uh now let's just roll some
[57:08] scriptures here and let's look at what
[57:10] the word of God says he says now Heaven
[57:11] and Earth will pass away he says but my
[57:15] words shall not pass away right so
[57:18] what's the as we sat there in Lima one
[57:20] time and brother Brooks through this
[57:22] trick question you know and he said the
[57:24] scripture and he says where is the
[57:26] safest place in heaven on Earth or on
[57:29] God's word you know in me being a young
[57:31] Christian I was thinking wow man
[57:33] Heaven's Heaven's pretty safe if Jesus
[57:36] is up there but then it was revealed
[57:38] obviously he says but my word shall
[57:40] never pass away because because why
[57:42] heavens and earth shall be remade new
[57:46] amen sure uh they're going to change
[57:48] actually things are going to take a a
[57:50] renovation amen sure but the word of God
[57:53] stands silent now notice in Revelation 7
[57:56] or John 17 16 he says he says they are
[57:59] not of this world even as I am not of
[58:01] this world sanctify them through thy
[58:04] truth he said what he says Thy word is
[58:07] true saints of God
[58:10] this is the absolute right
[58:14] the Bible is absolutely the true
[58:18] standard of this day and things of God
[58:19] if you go to any any house like this any
[58:21] sporting event uh I'll say like this if
[58:25] we had to pick in this if we had to pick
[58:27] in this assembly right here what would
[58:28] be the absolute of piano playing would
[58:30] it be young Malachi's it would be young
[58:34] uh lydias or Emmys or however you want
[58:36] to say it who well who who can play this
[58:38] better and who can play that better and
[58:40] this and this and we would maybe have a
[58:41] discussion and whatever and somebody
[58:43] vote for a brother of Malachi some might
[58:44] vote for Lydia or Emma or however you
[58:46] want to say it but something people say
[58:49] well there has to be an absolute the
[58:50] saints of God the I'll say like this who
[58:52] plays with us like this the anointing of
[58:55] the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost
[58:57] and is playing through that individual
[58:59] no matter what kind of talent or this
[59:01] and that if as long as the Holy Ghost
[59:03] playing I'll say that's an absolute amen
[59:07] because what we can do nothing without
[59:10] him Amen in everything we do whether in
[59:12] word or deed must be done in the name
[59:14] name of Jesus Christ amen and we want to
[59:17] pack and keep that anointing with us
[59:19] amen sure absolutely now notice this
[59:23] knowing this first
[59:25] that no Prophecy of the scripture is of
[59:29] any private interpretation
[59:32] just as they took this right here
[59:38] what does this mean
[59:42] what exactly is the interpretation is
[59:45] the interpretation of this is that at
[59:47] the end everything's going to be in
[59:49] Chaos on the earth and what then one
[59:51] man's going to rise up and try and solve
[59:53] all and we'll solve all the problems and
[59:55] he says we need a one-world church and a
[59:57] one world government and we need this
[59:58] and this and this and then hey let's
[1:00:00] join up is that the interpretation of
[1:00:02] what Christ is saying absolutely not
[1:00:07] that is not the interpretation see
[1:00:10] he says all scripture is given by the
[1:00:13] inspiration of God and is profitable For
[1:00:15] What doctrine for reproof for correction
[1:00:18] for instruction and righteousness what
[1:00:21] does the doctrine instruction and
[1:00:22] teaching reproof is to provide proof or
[1:00:26] conviction absolutely he says
[1:00:28] Corrections straightening up again or
[1:00:30] our reformations see all these things
[1:00:32] that's why we read the Bible that's why
[1:00:33] we believe the word because what these
[1:00:35] things keep us in the straight and
[1:00:37] narrow path amen sure he said not only
[1:00:40] and also for what instruction which is
[1:00:42] training and chastisement amen
[1:00:44] absolutely anybody ever get spanked by
[1:00:46] the Lord
[1:00:47] absolutely many many times here I have
[1:00:50] absolutely I'm very familiar with his
[1:00:53] the Lord's uh leather belt there maybe
[1:00:55] by God's grace yeah
[1:00:57] and he he swings hard and he loves it he
[1:00:59] loves you but it hurts then second
[1:01:03] Timothy uh 3 and 17 he says that the man
[1:01:06] of God may be perfect thoroughly
[1:01:08] furnished unto all good works that's why
[1:01:12] all this is for so what you may be
[1:01:14] perfect ready to do the very work or
[1:01:16] will of God absolutely sure amen now
[1:01:20] um so notice here now notice uh in
[1:01:23] second Peter 1 and 20 knowing this first
[1:01:25] and no Prophecy of the scriptures of any
[1:01:28] private interpretation
[1:01:31] there we have it he says for the
[1:01:32] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[1:01:34] will of man but by holy men of God's
[1:01:36] fake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:01:38] Ghost now here's one thing I'll say this
[1:01:40] where the Catholic church has continued
[1:01:42] on
[1:01:43] they believe their early church fathers
[1:01:45] were also led to the Holy Ghost to what
[1:01:47] add their opinions and their scriptures
[1:01:49] and those sort of things and they count
[1:01:51] that as scripture actually their
[1:01:53] scripture is above what the holy Canon
[1:01:56] of God the holy red and that's that's
[1:01:57] exactly what but now if you study you at
[1:02:00] chinikui Charles shinikui he says they
[1:02:02] kept saying he's like well which which
[1:02:04] Scholars do we read which one's this he
[1:02:06] says they said what is is uh uh
[1:02:09] authorities his teachers his professors
[1:02:12] said read them all so what did Chinook
[1:02:14] we do China we read them all and he says
[1:02:15] and he come back to the professor he
[1:02:17] says none of them agree on anything
[1:02:20] so what is right
[1:02:23] and he said he says I was like no he
[1:02:25] says when I went into the library one
[1:02:26] time technically was given special
[1:02:28] privileges to watch the library over a
[1:02:30] break one time and he went into the
[1:02:32] section of what forbidden books and he's
[1:02:35] going to these secret forbidden books
[1:02:37] and lo and behold he finds one of these
[1:02:41] and his spiritual appetite was so hungry
[1:02:44] he says I must eat of this forbidden
[1:02:47] book and he started he went to them I'm
[1:02:48] sure it was a corner a dark looted and
[1:02:50] he fund made me a dark room a little bit
[1:02:51] little candle and got the whack the wick
[1:02:53] all trimmed and he lit it and turned the
[1:02:55] oil on got it going and he started
[1:02:57] reading the word of God and he said he
[1:02:58] says in those moments I felt such joy
[1:03:01] and peace and Harmony but he felt also
[1:03:05] conviction because he disobeyed his uh
[1:03:07] his leaders right
[1:03:09] so after that weekend or that break
[1:03:12] he went and confessed to the to the
[1:03:14] hierarchy there and they said what are
[1:03:16] you doing reading the Bible he said he
[1:03:18] says I don't know but after reading it I
[1:03:20] felt so clean and so pure he says and he
[1:03:24] asked him he says why is this in the
[1:03:26] Forbidden the books
[1:03:28] he said we don't need it when they say
[1:03:31] we don't need it he says well we have
[1:03:32] the holy church fathers to read and he
[1:03:34] said which one is right you know and
[1:03:36] they of course he could tell by what
[1:03:38] their response they have read them
[1:03:40] themselves they never read them
[1:03:42] and even though they didn't know how to
[1:03:43] answer him
[1:03:44] and he had put them on uh he had I was
[1:03:47] like this he had stopped their mouths
[1:03:48] for many times trying to find what was
[1:03:51] the truth now and dealing with this now
[1:03:54] what what we all know the Bible is the
[1:03:57] absolute that's absolutely correct I
[1:03:58] mean there's there's no doubt in our
[1:04:00] minds but I want to look exactly what
[1:04:02] the prophet of God said here as well
[1:04:04] he says now not trying I'm not trying to
[1:04:07] usurp Authority or something like that
[1:04:09] he says you see a man or anything with
[1:04:11] two heads in it but it doesn't uh know
[1:04:13] how to go God never give two heads to
[1:04:16] his church he never oh sorry about that
[1:04:18] uh he never uh
[1:04:21] um uh did it it's one head he always
[1:04:23] doubt in every generation and we studied
[1:04:25] through the scriptures there's always
[1:04:26] been one individual that he deals with
[1:04:28] because you get two of them he says you
[1:04:30] get two opinions and it has to come from
[1:04:32] one final absolute he says in my
[1:04:34] absolute is the word he says the Bible
[1:04:37] amen
[1:04:38] see so we see that the Lord the prophet
[1:04:40] God said his absolute was the Bible his
[1:04:43] standard was the scripture his standard
[1:04:46] was what the the revelation of this
[1:04:48] absolutely sure now he says it means
[1:04:51] just what it says the Bible says it's of
[1:04:52] no private interpretation if it says it
[1:04:55] it says it's black it's black and white
[1:04:57] is white that's just what it is it's the
[1:04:59] ultimate he says it's the absolute and
[1:05:02] every man that's born of the spirit of
[1:05:05] God is tied to that see now I love these
[1:05:08] quotes now whenever the prophet of God
[1:05:10] he ties the Holy Ghost of baptism or
[1:05:14] being born again or those sort of things
[1:05:16] to something we had better keep our eyes
[1:05:19] and Minds onto that amen praise me to
[1:05:22] God because what when he says that I
[1:05:24] believe the inspiration will strike
[1:05:26] because these are something that the
[1:05:28] spirit will feed on this is something
[1:05:30] he's pointing he says look at what the
[1:05:32] Holy Ghost loves look at what the spirit
[1:05:34] of God loves amen any what is the Holy
[1:05:36] Spirit what points to the Bible why
[1:05:39] because the Holy Spirit
[1:05:41] wrote this
[1:05:44] this is the Holy Ghost words right here
[1:05:46] this is his interpretation I was like
[1:05:48] this is his Revelation given to us
[1:05:50] absolutely I love that he says and no
[1:05:53] matter nothing will separate him from it
[1:05:55] he's tied to the word because it's
[1:05:57] Christ and Christ is the word
[1:06:01] and Christ cannot lie about his word for
[1:06:03] he is that word amen absolutely sure he
[1:06:07] said now notice here in the absolute he
[1:06:09] says and there's one star that never
[1:06:11] changed there's one thing that can never
[1:06:13] change that's God God cannot change so
[1:06:15] if God cannot change his word cannot
[1:06:18] change he says his Bible cannot change
[1:06:21] and if a man is born of the spirit of
[1:06:23] God with Christ in him see I love these
[1:06:26] quotes right here these are very
[1:06:28] important absolutely because what he's
[1:06:30] pointing what to the very spirit that
[1:06:33] wrote this the very spirit that was in
[1:06:34] Jesus Christ when Christ spoke what he
[1:06:37] only spoke what with the father gave him
[1:06:39] to speak absolutely and that is the
[1:06:41] Father's words amen that's the Holy
[1:06:43] Ghost words right there sure that is the
[1:06:46] creator the same one that spoke the tree
[1:06:49] and the land and the grass he said he
[1:06:51] also spoke this Bible into existence
[1:06:54] absolutely sure
[1:06:56] he says it punctuates every promise with
[1:06:58] an amen that is right certainly yeah
[1:07:02] I really I really love those quotes he
[1:07:05] says no now notice here
[1:07:07] now here's the danger
[1:07:09] because it's coming down to one final
[1:07:11] thing this is all coming down to one
[1:07:13] culmination of one choice and what do we
[1:07:16] do if you look uh and I I kind of
[1:07:18] hammered this a lot back home and uh
[1:07:20] sister Emma Nelly I'm sure heard this uh
[1:07:23] about almost in every service
[1:07:24] billerbrand blast organization
[1:07:28] he blasted every every sermon listen and
[1:07:31] see what he says about uh adding your
[1:07:33] own spin to something or your own
[1:07:35] interpretation to something or this or
[1:07:36] that and man's leadership outside the
[1:07:39] Holy Ghost just just listen to what he
[1:07:41] preached he says now he says Now Eve God
[1:07:43] bless you now when Eve went away from
[1:07:45] the word she went away from her mate and
[1:07:47] when the church goes away from the word
[1:07:49] to denominations she rejects and commits
[1:07:52] fornications with the world of uh man's
[1:07:55] Wisdom rejecting the authority of the
[1:07:57] word of God see that's why we've got to
[1:07:59] walk tight to this amen if it's not in
[1:08:01] the scripture run from it if it's in the
[1:08:03] scripture then hold tight to it
[1:08:05] absolutely now if you don't now even if
[1:08:07] it's in the scripture we've got to want
[1:08:09] rightly divide these things amen and
[1:08:13] then then by the rightly dividing asking
[1:08:15] the holy spirit for leadership for
[1:08:17] guidance on how to what is he trying to
[1:08:19] convey here in this scripture what he's
[1:08:21] trying to say here in this passage right
[1:08:23] here in this chapter in this paragraph
[1:08:25] absolutely what Lord Jesus what are you
[1:08:27] trying to expressed to me today
[1:08:29] absolutely
[1:08:31] he said that sound clear and they said
[1:08:33] amen he said the Bible said committing
[1:08:35] spiritual fornications any word in the
[1:08:37] Bible That's rejected or if any uh
[1:08:40] self-interpretation is put to it it's
[1:08:43] absolutely rejecting and committing
[1:08:45] adultery against the against the god
[1:08:47] that is your husband my I see so
[1:08:50] look at the careful walk we must walk we
[1:08:52] must what tread very Softly As we walk
[1:08:55] in this life in this land that we're
[1:08:57] living absolutely as we live by what the
[1:09:00] scripture absolutely sure now
[1:09:04] now why I kind of want to show you right
[1:09:06] here now notice how the prophet of God
[1:09:07] kept saying and there's many many quotes
[1:09:09] he's dealing with the Bibles the
[1:09:10] absolutely say the Holy Ghost is the
[1:09:12] absolute the Holy Ghost is the North
[1:09:14] Star the Bible is the North Star
[1:09:16] those are the typos and those sort of
[1:09:18] things he's always point to the word of
[1:09:20] God right
[1:09:22] but as we if we as we've seen uh many
[1:09:25] are leaning heavy on the words of the
[1:09:28] prophet and that and that's nice and
[1:09:29] those are very good like I like these
[1:09:30] quotes here and like we said here of the
[1:09:32] spirit of God and those sort of things
[1:09:34] but we've got to be careful when we
[1:09:36] listen to everything right absolutely
[1:09:38] when you listen to a study by me you
[1:09:40] better make sure I'm teaching from the
[1:09:43] scripture and bringing forth the correct
[1:09:45] Revelation right sure now why is this so
[1:09:48] important let's just give me a quick
[1:09:50] example is that okay
[1:09:54] and questions and answers
[1:09:56] will
[1:09:57] all born again Believers go in the
[1:10:01] rapture
[1:10:02] now don't don't read it
[1:10:04] don't read it
[1:10:06] let me ask you will born-again Believers
[1:10:08] go in the rapture
[1:10:11] yes
[1:10:12] I've got news for you
[1:10:15] obviously you guys don't have the
[1:10:16] revelation of the hour now this was in I
[1:10:18] believe in 64.
[1:10:21] we're all born again Believers go in the
[1:10:24] rapture no just the remnant
[1:10:33] now what if some young newbie
[1:10:35] hears the Revelation for the Malachi or
[1:10:38] when the sisters go out witnessing and
[1:10:40] uh uh brother Austin goes witnessing
[1:10:42] however and they said hey come hear the
[1:10:44] word come here the message I already
[1:10:45] come here and they're like wow this is
[1:10:46] amazing and they they get the they get
[1:10:48] the message app whatever they say man
[1:10:50] but who's going to make the Rapture and
[1:10:52] they type it in and this quote comes up
[1:10:54] and he's like
[1:10:55] hmm
[1:10:57] so what's the difference
[1:11:01] and that's where he needed to call
[1:11:03] Pastor Jesse
[1:11:05] or really get into prayer fasting
[1:11:08] now no knows what the prophet God he
[1:11:10] says no just the remnant just the
[1:11:13] remnant not all born again Believers
[1:11:15] what
[1:11:19] he says and the Bible said and the rest
[1:11:22] of the Dead live not a thousand years
[1:11:23] and they that was raised and separated
[1:11:26] the sheeps and it goes not all not all
[1:11:28] he says it three times
[1:11:30] but every every word be established by
[1:11:32] twos and Friends
[1:11:37] he says not all born again will go into
[1:11:40] according to scripture
[1:11:45] well is that is that true
[1:11:48] we know the prophet was probably
[1:11:51] thinking about a million different
[1:11:52] things and
[1:11:53] we we know exactly what he did he did he
[1:11:56] didn't say it correctly right
[1:11:58] absolutely now remember he struggled
[1:11:59] early in the 60s about being born again
[1:12:01] and uh being the new birth and although
[1:12:05] he thought they were separate things
[1:12:07] but if you search at the last thing he
[1:12:10] gave us was what the church age book in
[1:12:12] that church age book it's revealed that
[1:12:14] the being born again and being converted
[1:12:17] and those sort of things being baptized
[1:12:19] with the Holy Ghost for one and the same
[1:12:25] absolutely but Jesus said you must be
[1:12:27] born again to enter in the kingdom of
[1:12:28] God
[1:12:31] now look at this now listen let me tell
[1:12:34] you how crazy this looks you read that
[1:12:37] completely not true
[1:12:39] the very next the very next question
[1:12:43] what is the evidence that a person is
[1:12:45] really filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:48] what is the evidence of the person
[1:12:50] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:53] when the Holy Ghost has come he will
[1:12:55] show you things that come see he'll be
[1:12:57] perfect man-mades won't do it he is the
[1:12:59] word and when he and the Holy Ghost is
[1:13:01] come he will identify himself with you
[1:13:05] in the scripture and that is the true
[1:13:06] sign of the holy spirit because it is
[1:13:08] the word
[1:13:10] and yet before
[1:13:11] he was unable to identify the scripture
[1:13:14] the true interpretation of the scripture
[1:13:16] so the brother Graham have the Holy
[1:13:17] Ghost
[1:13:18] makes you well to the to the to the new
[1:13:21] ones they would be a
[1:13:23] I wonder
[1:13:25] okay that was wrong and then now he's
[1:13:27] saying he doesn't have it
[1:13:31] so what's the absolute
[1:13:34] the word of God absolutely see it man
[1:13:37] can go off the seventh angel messenger
[1:13:40] could go off
[1:13:41] just for a break now he could get right
[1:13:43] back the next question and hit it
[1:13:45] perfect absolutely
[1:13:48] absolutely and I didn't I didn't get the
[1:13:50] chance to search this I don't know if
[1:13:51] the Holy Ghost corrected him later or
[1:13:53] not or whatever sometimes the holy he
[1:13:54] said no he said something feels wrong
[1:13:55] and no no the Holy Ghost is correcting
[1:13:57] me what did I say something wrong is he
[1:13:59] he doesn't say that later on
[1:14:01] so even the spirit of God did not
[1:14:03] correct that now notice here
[1:14:06] what is the main thing here
[1:14:08] at the same time came the disciples
[1:14:10] under Jesus saying who is the greatest
[1:14:12] in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus
[1:14:13] called a little child on them to set him
[1:14:16] in the midst and said verily saying to
[1:14:17] you except you be converted and become
[1:14:20] as little children ye shall not enter
[1:14:22] into the kingdom of heaven
[1:14:25] is that not what the scripture says what
[1:14:27] is being converted what what means what
[1:14:29] being born again receiving getting
[1:14:31] filled with the Holy Ghost getting
[1:14:32] baptized with fire all those sort of
[1:14:35] things and now notice what Jesus also
[1:14:37] said Jesus in John 3 says Jesus answers
[1:14:40] into verse saying to you except a man be
[1:14:42] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:14:47] God
[1:14:48] now what's the interpretation of this
[1:14:51] he cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:14:58] forever I was saying to you except the
[1:14:59] man be born of water in the spirit he
[1:15:01] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[1:15:03] that which is born of flesh is flesh and
[1:15:07] that was born of the spirit is Spirit
[1:15:09] see see the difference here there's a
[1:15:11] night and day difference right here
[1:15:16] looky here
[1:15:18] first faith comes by hearing hearing the
[1:15:20] word of God and then the believer hears
[1:15:22] it recognizing acts on it the carnal man
[1:15:25] would hear it and sat like this here
[1:15:27] well here the sound of it but never here
[1:15:31] means to understand it look at it
[1:15:33] accepting uh looking at something but
[1:15:35] but to but to see it is to understand it
[1:15:38] except the man be born again he cannot
[1:15:40] see or understand the kingdom of God
[1:15:46] now this is where
[1:15:49] so except the man be born again he
[1:15:51] cannot understand or see or understand
[1:15:53] the kingdom of God
[1:15:55] now this is very important here
[1:15:58] being born again
[1:16:01] guarantees you number one the rapture
[1:16:04] but it also guarantees you the
[1:16:07] understanding of what the spirit would
[1:16:09] have to say in the scripture dealing
[1:16:12] with what not only your day but all the
[1:16:14] days before that have come and gone sure
[1:16:16] and especially in this day and when so
[1:16:20] much Revelation was given to us
[1:16:22] absolutely sure now let's continue on
[1:16:24] here I want to I want to show you this
[1:16:26] um
[1:16:28] and this is where I think a lot of
[1:16:30] things I hear so many things going off
[1:16:32] and it makes me so uh nervous
[1:16:35] now notice here this is the laosian
[1:16:37] church age and notice what the what the
[1:16:40] Bible Jesus said there in Matthew or
[1:16:42] sorry in Revelations 3 he says and
[1:16:43] anointing eyes with eyes sad that thou
[1:16:46] mayest see
[1:16:48] the same thing that wasn't being born
[1:16:50] again he says and he does not say that
[1:16:52] you have to buy this as I say have no
[1:16:54] sir there is no price tag to the Holy
[1:16:57] Spirit
[1:16:59] he says he says receiving the Spirit by
[1:17:02] The Works law by hearing of Faith
[1:17:03] Galatians 3 2. he says without the
[1:17:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never
[1:17:07] have your eyes open to the true
[1:17:10] spiritual revelation of the
[1:17:14] absolute
[1:17:16] now this is the absolute but it takes
[1:17:18] the Revelation to understand the
[1:17:21] absolute amen thousands and thousands of
[1:17:24] millions of people have read this Bible
[1:17:27] but but because they've never been born
[1:17:29] again they've never been able to enter
[1:17:31] into the true revelation of what this
[1:17:34] was and that comes by what being led
[1:17:36] being taught by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:17:39] absolutely he says a man without the
[1:17:42] spirit is blind to God and his true
[1:17:47] how many of you got family members
[1:17:49] friends who go to church and yet they
[1:17:52] can still not see the baptism in the
[1:17:54] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:59] the only difference between us and Them
[1:18:03] is that what God has taken we have what
[1:18:05] entered and received the baptism the
[1:18:07] Holy Ghost and what God has opened these
[1:18:09] things up the very importance of it
[1:18:15] absolutely
[1:18:17] now
[1:18:19] let's continue on here in Revelations 2
[1:18:21] 3 here they had the ear
[1:18:24] now this is just uh I just found this uh
[1:18:27] this year actually this this thought and
[1:18:30] it just cleared so much up for me it
[1:18:32] really helped me
[1:18:34] I've stated this before
[1:18:36] I believe it was here and at home in in
[1:18:39] Revelations two and three
[1:18:42] seven
[1:18:43] carnal men were sent
[1:18:47] and Holy Ghost filled men at the same
[1:18:49] time the Holy Ghost filled new creatures
[1:18:51] but still had that carnal nature they're
[1:18:53] still men they were still sinned and
[1:18:55] battle those things just like us we're
[1:18:57] what the uh the similar nature
[1:19:00] still battling these things right here
[1:19:01] the effects of the world battling demons
[1:19:03] but battling Satan himself those sort of
[1:19:05] things
[1:19:09] but when it came down to the last part
[1:19:11] of every Church age it says what he that
[1:19:13] has an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:19:15] of saith in the churches there's not one
[1:19:17] Church age where this verse is not
[1:19:19] mentioned
[1:19:21] so this is when Jesus said verily verily
[1:19:24] or he'd say John John or Peter Peter he
[1:19:28] was what trying to draw some attention
[1:19:29] with what repetition amen but now here
[1:19:31] God in the Holy Ghost God himself Jesus
[1:19:34] Christ is saying what he that hath and
[1:19:36] here he says that seven times ma he says
[1:19:39] this seven times he the hath an ear he
[1:19:42] sent one one Angel out and at the end of
[1:19:44] the Angel's message you say he that has
[1:19:46] an ear
[1:19:47] hear what the spirit said understand
[1:19:50] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:19:56] this is just
[1:19:58] this has been new to me this this
[1:20:00] thought right here has been new I've
[1:20:01] been chewing on this for about a year
[1:20:02] now
[1:20:03] every single age has the same same
[1:20:06] admonition to the people of every age he
[1:20:10] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:20:11] spirit saith but it is an absolute but
[1:20:14] it's absolutely impossible for all men
[1:20:16] to hear what the spirit
[1:20:18] goes for the prophet so through the
[1:20:19] Angels what the angel says or what the
[1:20:22] spirit says he says what the spirit says
[1:20:24] to the different ages
[1:20:27] and directly after this the prophet of
[1:20:30] God brings out four scriptures he ties
[1:20:32] us to four scriptures what is the
[1:20:35] interpretation what is the Revelation
[1:20:37] between what of he that hath an ear let
[1:20:40] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:20:42] churches
[1:20:44] what does that mean what does it mean
[1:20:47] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:20:49] churches what does that mean
[1:20:52] and then when I read this scripture
[1:20:54] here's the four scriptures he uses right
[1:20:55] here
[1:20:56] First Corinthians 2 6-16 Matthew 13 13
[1:21:00] through 16 John 8 42 John 8's obviously
[1:21:03] a heavy hitter uh 42-44 and John and
[1:21:07] Matthew 16.
[1:21:08] 17.
[1:21:11] this is the difference everything is
[1:21:12] coming down to this
[1:21:15] who goes in the Rapture all that are
[1:21:17] born again
[1:21:19] if you are born again you're going up
[1:21:22] amen absolutely if you've been baptized
[1:21:24] with the Holy Ghost you're going up if
[1:21:26] you become what a new creature in Christ
[1:21:28] you're going up if you've been converted
[1:21:30] what you are going up absolutely if you
[1:21:32] received a new birth if you have Christ
[1:21:35] and you living and while you are sealed
[1:21:37] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:21:39] are going to make this rapture
[1:21:41] I just listed you five things you can do
[1:21:44] to make the Rapture now notice but I
[1:21:47] love what this says he the hath and ear
[1:21:50] let him hear what the spirit
[1:21:52] say it
[1:21:54] how be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:21:57] that are perfect
[1:21:59] yet not the wisdom of this world nor the
[1:22:02] prince of this world that come to not
[1:22:03] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:22:06] mystery so the the wisdom of God is a
[1:22:09] mystery you can't figure it out it takes
[1:22:11] one the Holy Ghost to open these things
[1:22:13] up to be a revelation a revelation is
[1:22:16] something like uh it'll just strike and
[1:22:18] it's just like whoa I've never seen that
[1:22:20] and it draws you it actually becomes I
[1:22:22] was like this they used to feed the the
[1:22:24] children
[1:22:26] potatoes and and steak and meat and all
[1:22:29] that what because they say it what
[1:22:30] sticks to your bones but you get a
[1:22:32] revelation that thing actually sticks to
[1:22:35] you you'll be working and all of a
[1:22:37] sudden it'll come right back up when you
[1:22:39] start thinking about it and thinking
[1:22:40] about it thinking about you're like my
[1:22:41] Lord that is so powerful thank you Jesus
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:45] he says not not yet yet not the wisdom
[1:22:48] of the world nor the prince of this
[1:22:49] world that come to not but we speak the
[1:22:51] wisdom of God in the mystery even the
[1:22:53] hidden wisdom which was for which was uh
[1:22:56] which God ordained before the world to
[1:22:58] unto our Glory which none of the princes
[1:23:00] of this world knew but hey if or had
[1:23:02] they had known it they would not have
[1:23:04] crucified the Lord of Glory
[1:23:06] and he goes on he says but God is
[1:23:08] revealed to us by his spirit for the
[1:23:10] spirit searches all things now what was
[1:23:12] revealed by who revealed it the spirit
[1:23:14] of God revealed it
[1:23:17] now here we go this is beautiful for
[1:23:20] what man knoweth the things of man saved
[1:23:22] the spirit of man which is in him even
[1:23:25] so the things of God knoweth no man but
[1:23:27] the spirit of God
[1:23:31] to catch the correct revelation of the
[1:23:35] word of God and the placement of where
[1:23:37] we are in this day in this hour it will
[1:23:40] take a direct revelation of God right
[1:23:43] now where are we
[1:23:44] are we 18 20 years away from the Rapture
[1:23:47] are we 100 years from Rapture are we
[1:23:49] right on the cusp of this thing
[1:23:51] I believe the Holy Ghost will what show
[1:23:54] us these things and is showing us these
[1:23:56] things
[1:23:59] now we have now we have received not the
[1:24:02] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[1:24:04] is of god that we might know the things
[1:24:07] that are freely given unto us of God
[1:24:10] the only way you can receive free things
[1:24:13] or free Revelations or these the
[1:24:15] Salvation uh this leadership is what is
[1:24:17] if you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:19] Ghost that is only it you can go sit
[1:24:22] under the greatest teacher or preacher
[1:24:24] in this message right now and not catch
[1:24:25] a thing
[1:24:29] you'll hear it and it'll go
[1:24:31] it won't even matter
[1:24:33] because it all depends on the spirit
[1:24:36] right there the spirit of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] he says which things we also speak not
[1:24:40] in the words of man's Wisdom teacheth
[1:24:43] but which the Holy Ghost teaches
[1:24:46] there we go
[1:24:48] who's the teacher here it is the Holy
[1:24:51] Spirit
[1:24:52] comparing spiritual things with
[1:24:55] spiritual but notice what he says in
[1:24:57] verse 14 he says but the natural man
[1:24:59] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[1:25:02] of God
[1:25:07] this is what makes me wonder so much
[1:25:09] about as uh I'm sure you know the uh I
[1:25:13] do have you I push heavy on those uh
[1:25:17] the Deeds of Nicolaitans the doctrine
[1:25:19] Nicolaitans balamism and then Jezebel
[1:25:23] those are very very important things to
[1:25:25] catch the revelation of
[1:25:28] he says but the natural man receiveth
[1:25:30] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:25:31] they are foolishness unto him neither
[1:25:34] can he know them because they are
[1:25:35] spiritually discerned but he that is
[1:25:37] spiritual judge us all things
[1:25:42] yet he himself is Judge of no man for
[1:25:45] hath known the mind of the Lord that he
[1:25:47] may instruct him but we have but he says
[1:25:49] but what we have the mind of Christ amen
[1:25:52] and say to God if you have the mind of
[1:25:55] Christ and what the spirit of God has
[1:25:57] Abode Abode with you and you've abided
[1:25:59] with him what he's going to show you and
[1:26:02] lead and guide you into all true
[1:26:06] absolutely now
[1:26:12] in a hole in the hole
[1:26:15] putting these verses together we see
[1:26:17] that there is only one group of people
[1:26:20] and that a very special group of people
[1:26:22] who are able to hear what the spirit
[1:26:24] says in each age
[1:26:27] but when I've heard this message saints
[1:26:29] of God how many message Believers have
[1:26:30] fallen away
[1:26:32] well when you hear this message you've
[1:26:33] heard from geophany how many have fallen
[1:26:35] away
[1:26:38] that doesn't make any sense
[1:26:42] it's always been what a there was a
[1:26:46] Revival in the 40s 50s and 60s
[1:26:49] and there's always been twins
[1:26:51] and there's always been a church called
[1:26:53] out of a church
[1:26:55] it's going coming down to what
[1:26:57] individuals amen who are what want to be
[1:26:59] sold out fully moving what is his
[1:27:02] brother Jesse said moving into the book
[1:27:03] of Acts and Performing those things
[1:27:06] amen sure
[1:27:09] he says uh and that'll be a very special
[1:27:11] group people are able to hear what the
[1:27:13] spirit says in each age it is one
[1:27:15] special it is one special group that
[1:27:17] receives the Revelation for each age he
[1:27:21] says that group is of God because the
[1:27:22] group cannot hear he says because the
[1:27:24] group that cannot hear of God that group
[1:27:27] that can find and does hear what the
[1:27:28] spirit is saying and receives the
[1:27:30] Revelation thereof is that group
[1:27:31] described in First Corinthians 2
[1:27:34] 16-18 see very very powerful
[1:27:38] and this is what worries me
[1:27:41] people are saying the message is the
[1:27:43] absolute
[1:27:45] there's not one quote yes I'm here found
[1:27:47] a quote where it said Bill Graham said
[1:27:48] the message is the absolute
[1:27:52] so they're not saying what the prophet
[1:27:53] said they're not saying
[1:27:55] what Malachi 4 said
[1:27:58] they're not saying that the problem show
[1:28:00] me the quote I just typed in last night
[1:28:02] I couldn't find anything you know what
[1:28:03] he continually said he said the Bible is
[1:28:05] the absolute he said the Holy Ghost was
[1:28:07] the absolute
[1:28:10] this is dangerous danger Russ
[1:28:21] get your Bibles out here let's go to
[1:28:22] John 6.
[1:28:24] remember this this is coming into play
[1:28:32] here's the Revelation I don't have this
[1:28:34] I'm just kind of pulling this right here
[1:28:35] I don't have this on my notes in John 6.
[1:28:40] now these were believers
[1:28:49] whenever they come looking for Jesus
[1:28:50] Jesus crossed over the sea and they
[1:28:52] crossed notice they went through Great
[1:28:54] Lengths to find him
[1:28:57] disciples crossed Jesus crossed
[1:28:59] they're on the other side of this this
[1:29:01] body of water and they're like where's
[1:29:03] Jesus the Bible said they've gotten
[1:29:05] ships and went and found him
[1:29:09] that that costs that was a sacrifice
[1:29:15] now notice
[1:29:17] verse 25 John 6 25 and when they had
[1:29:20] found him on the other side of the sea
[1:29:22] they said unto him Rabbi whence came as
[1:29:24] thou hither
[1:29:26] Jesus now notice he calls him out
[1:29:28] exactly calls him out Jesus answered
[1:29:30] them very very saying to you ye seek me
[1:29:32] not because ye saw the Miracles but but
[1:29:35] because you were fit you'd eat the
[1:29:36] Loaves and were filled labor not for the
[1:29:38] meat which pairs us for uh but for that
[1:29:41] meat which endures unto everlasting life
[1:29:43] which the son of man shall give unto you
[1:29:45] for him hath God the Father sealed
[1:29:48] then said unto him what shall we do that
[1:29:50] we might work the works of God
[1:29:54] Jesus answers unto him this is the work
[1:29:56] of God that ye believe on him whom he
[1:29:58] hath sent
[1:29:59] they said therefore unto him what signs
[1:30:02] show us thou then that we may see and
[1:30:04] believe thee what does thy Work did not
[1:30:06] Jesus just feed them in a miracle fed
[1:30:10] thousands and multitudes and yet they
[1:30:12] still did not believe this was God or of
[1:30:15] God
[1:30:17] and yet then they great made huge
[1:30:19] sacrifice they pushed
[1:30:21] and crossed and paid a fee and had to
[1:30:24] who knows what that was could have been
[1:30:25] dangerous back then traveling over that
[1:30:28] sea and however whatever
[1:30:30] now notice what did they say next in 31.
[1:30:33] our fathers did eat Manna in the desert
[1:30:37] as it is written notice they quote
[1:30:39] scripture he gave them bread from Heaven
[1:30:43] to eat
[1:30:45] now what did now that was scripture
[1:30:47] right they pulled from the absolute but
[1:30:50] what was the Revelation behind it
[1:30:55] oh they had the word of God they knew
[1:30:57] the word of God but what was their
[1:30:58] interpretation of that scripture
[1:31:01] when it says when it says what
[1:31:04] he who's he
[1:31:06] Jesus called them out
[1:31:09] what did Jesus say Jesus said to him
[1:31:11] very I said to you Moses gave you not
[1:31:14] that bread
[1:31:15] even though they used the scripture when
[1:31:18] they said he gave us bread from Heaven
[1:31:20] they were talking about Moses the
[1:31:22] prophet of God the prophet did this and
[1:31:25] the prophet did this let me tell you
[1:31:26] something Jesus Christ has done
[1:31:28] everything
[1:31:30] if that was not true why would the
[1:31:32] prophet at the end of his age says man I
[1:31:34] haven't done one thing for the Lord
[1:31:36] Brother Brandon you better get busy
[1:31:40] and he went back on the field
[1:31:43] absolutely why because who like I'll
[1:31:45] never forget brother Jessica's preaching
[1:31:47] and said who gave you that breath in
[1:31:49] your in your lungs and your in the air
[1:31:51] in your mouth to breathe God gave that
[1:31:54] to you
[1:31:56] you're sitting here breathing through
[1:31:57] your nostrils in your mouth who gives
[1:31:59] you the ability to breathe right now and
[1:32:01] keep your keep yourself alive
[1:32:04] can you do it no it's the Holy Ghost God
[1:32:06] himself forgives life and he takes life
[1:32:10] Jesus called them out he says he says
[1:32:12] Moses gave you not that bread from
[1:32:14] heaven but my father giveth you that
[1:32:16] true bread from Heaven amen praise be to
[1:32:18] God
[1:32:19] look at that he discerned now notice it
[1:32:21] took what a discernment of the father to
[1:32:24] call it out
[1:32:26] Jesus said oh that's a good scripture
[1:32:27] and he didn't move on no he called it
[1:32:29] out
[1:32:31] well I'll just some people say well I
[1:32:33] just got to cover their sins and this
[1:32:34] yeah and sometimes when it seems to God
[1:32:36] there's a time when you got to call it
[1:32:37] out amen you got to call Sin Sin that's
[1:32:40] the wrong interpretation of that
[1:32:42] scripture amen
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:46] I'm sure I'm sure Jesus's disciples
[1:32:48] could say wow they he they use the
[1:32:50] scripture that's that's he gave them
[1:32:51] bread from Heaven absolutely
[1:32:53] they knew they know their litters they
[1:32:55] know who they know who deals but but
[1:32:56] Jesus knew their thoughts and intents
[1:32:59] and what they meant amen they were
[1:33:01] leaning that entire feeding of the word
[1:33:04] what on the prophet of God or that that
[1:33:06] man it was on to the prophet Moses
[1:33:09] ah absolutely
[1:33:12] he says they are the ones who have the
[1:33:14] spirit of God they're the ones that are
[1:33:16] born of God they are baptized into the
[1:33:18] body of the Lord Jesus Christ by his
[1:33:20] Spirit they are baptized with the Holy
[1:33:22] Ghost amen absolutely now
[1:33:25] let's see here
[1:33:28] let's continue on here he says now
[1:33:29] notice here in the Smyrna Church age he
[1:33:31] says to further bring out what we've
[1:33:33] just said is also the scriptures that
[1:33:35] should be born in mind as we talk about
[1:33:37] who it is that baptized that is baptized
[1:33:39] with the Holy Ghost we see what Jesus
[1:33:41] says in John 6 it is written in the
[1:33:43] prophets that they shall all be taught
[1:33:46] of God
[1:33:48] the only way you can have the Lord Jesus
[1:33:50] Christ teach you is if you want you have
[1:33:52] been born again of the Holy Spirit
[1:33:55] that is when the teacher himself then
[1:33:58] begins revealing and showing you what
[1:34:00] the spiritual aspects of many many
[1:34:03] things
[1:34:05] he says he says now but turn to Isaiah
[1:34:08] 54 13 went forth this is taken and it
[1:34:10] reads and all thy children shall be
[1:34:13] taught of the Lord and and the the all
[1:34:16] of God are the children of God he says
[1:34:18] thus it is that evidence of being a true
[1:34:20] child of God he whom the spirit has come
[1:34:22] upon and indwells is again set forth as
[1:34:25] one is taught by the word by taught the
[1:34:27] word by the Holy Ghost
[1:34:33] the revelation
[1:34:35] I'll say it like this
[1:34:39] and my pastor cam had said something
[1:34:42] back home
[1:34:43] and it was teaching on a certain subject
[1:34:45] and Yoni said he said and that subject
[1:34:48] to that subject matter was in The Book
[1:34:49] of Revelations
[1:34:52] he goes what's the name of that book
[1:34:53] again
[1:34:54] [Laughter]
[1:34:56] the revelation
[1:34:59] of Jesus Christ
[1:35:02] so before Jesus ascended
[1:35:05] he did not have the revelation of
[1:35:08] anything in the Book of Revelation
[1:35:12] but what does it say in Revelations 1 1
[1:35:14] . uh let's just read that real quick I
[1:35:16] want to read that Revelations 1 1.
[1:35:19] where did Jesus have to get the
[1:35:21] Revelation from
[1:35:25] this was completely hid what in the
[1:35:29] father
[1:35:31] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:35:34] gave unto him
[1:35:38] are we reading that correct
[1:35:40] so even the perfect one the sinless one
[1:35:43] the Spotless lamb had to wait from
[1:35:46] Revelation had to wait what was the
[1:35:48] Revelation everything contained in this
[1:35:49] in this book right here revelation
[1:35:51] this is a so if this is a book of
[1:35:54] Revelation therefore the only way to
[1:35:56] understand that book would be by what
[1:35:58] revelation
[1:36:00] why listen to the I listened to seals
[1:36:02] one and one through seven and I read the
[1:36:04] church age book but do you have the
[1:36:06] revelation of what was being said there
[1:36:11] you can read it I'll tell you what I
[1:36:13] read it was not until the third time I
[1:36:15] read that church age book did I catch
[1:36:17] the revelation of the Deeds of
[1:36:18] Nicolaitans
[1:36:19] it laid there
[1:36:22] and I called my pastor and guess what he
[1:36:25] was hot on the same Trail reading that
[1:36:26] tree and I said brother did you read
[1:36:28] this he just yes I said what about this
[1:36:29] he's yes I said me too I said this is
[1:36:31] crazy he says yes absolutely I said why
[1:36:33] did we see this before I said I don't
[1:36:34] know what's going on here I don't know
[1:36:36] I'm not sure let's continue reading okay
[1:36:40] because now we're seeing for the first
[1:36:43] time
[1:36:44] for me
[1:36:45] five years ago I started seeing what the
[1:36:48] Antichrist Spirit would do in little
[1:36:51] form in the original Church
[1:36:55] what was what was the spirit that made
[1:36:57] the church cold formal and Powerless it
[1:37:00] was the Antichrist Spirit through those
[1:37:03] deeds and just that little bit of
[1:37:05] getting away from the true Revelation
[1:37:07] the true revelation of the church just
[1:37:10] that little bit of getting away from
[1:37:11] what the pastors what the Bishops were
[1:37:14] supposed to really be doing what they
[1:37:16] were what their job was getting away
[1:37:18] from that caused the entire fall
[1:37:22] from the book of Acts
[1:37:24] that's clear as day
[1:37:27] absolutely clear as day
[1:37:31] this is a serious matter
[1:37:36] I don't even
[1:37:37] I will never forget when those things
[1:37:39] jumped out in my my eyes
[1:37:42] and I believe was like a form of I said
[1:37:43] just
[1:37:45] that's the problem because when I was in
[1:37:47] denomination you know really just
[1:37:49] actually left it uh don't tell me God
[1:37:51] before I did what was it what was what
[1:37:53] was the reason about Jess
[1:37:55] tongues tongues is not the evidence of
[1:37:57] the Holy Ghost why why did you leave
[1:37:58] brother
[1:38:00] because it's not the Everest of the Holy
[1:38:01] Ghost
[1:38:04] he said he said so I came he said I
[1:38:06] can't agree with this I was like okay
[1:38:07] you know and me I was just kind of I was
[1:38:09] just fighting for Jesus I wasn't even
[1:38:11] caring about doctor at the time and just
[1:38:12] as a student doctor and he's like oh I
[1:38:13] gotta go I was like I was like
[1:38:15] okay
[1:38:18] but the Lord brought us all back
[1:38:19] together
[1:38:23] amen just grew up you know just always
[1:38:26] grew a little faster than me if you
[1:38:28] notice by now all right so and a little
[1:38:30] bit longer too absolutely sure
[1:38:32] natural perfectly
[1:38:34] now now
[1:38:36] he was the revelation
[1:38:39] it wasn't until a year or maybe a little
[1:38:41] less later that I catch Revelation that
[1:38:43] man that that is not correct
[1:38:47] correct and you know what the feeling I
[1:38:48] got for the just left and I started
[1:38:50] seeing things wrong I said there's
[1:38:51] something wrong here
[1:38:56] I started praying in the closet
[1:38:59] and when the Lord started you know what
[1:39:01] I in the uh the middle 2000 teens right
[1:39:04] there
[1:39:05] the same feeling came about me and said
[1:39:07] something's wrong in this message what
[1:39:10] is it and I jumped back in the church
[1:39:12] age book and there it was laying right
[1:39:16] there
[1:39:19] and I believe was the same Holy Ghost
[1:39:22] leading us further out of the desert
[1:39:25] further out of what denomination and
[1:39:27] figure out the organization I'll say it
[1:39:29] like that organizational Spirits
[1:39:31] absolutely
[1:39:32] sure same feeling and what did God do he
[1:39:35] just opened it up and cracked it open
[1:39:36] and said
[1:39:38] there it is
[1:39:40] I see the quotes we took the quotes Dove
[1:39:43] back into the absolute
[1:39:44] found here found here diatropius
[1:39:47] trifests or whatever they're this and
[1:39:48] this and this and this and how how uh
[1:39:51] diotrophes would not even allow John to
[1:39:53] come and preach because he wanted more
[1:39:55] of the preeminence
[1:39:58] oh
[1:39:59] wait John the disciple Jesus loves
[1:40:03] John the one that penned four what five
[1:40:07] books or four books in the Bible then
[1:40:09] just to subscribe to the last one I say
[1:40:11] like that or scribe to Five I'll silly
[1:40:16] thank you Lord
[1:40:19] that man the one to walked with him the
[1:40:21] one that laid in the bosom of Jesus at
[1:40:24] the Last Supper and they didn't want him
[1:40:25] to come preach oh my
[1:40:28] something was wrong
[1:40:30] my
[1:40:31] what kind of a mentality what kind of
[1:40:33] attitude
[1:40:34] was that man under delusion I was like a
[1:40:36] strong delusion
[1:40:38] he said now you can begin to see why
[1:40:40] tongues is not there you go evidence of
[1:40:42] the being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:43] it does not say in any age that he that
[1:40:45] hath a tongue let him say what the
[1:40:47] spirit is saying notice notice what he
[1:40:49] said he that has a tongue let him say
[1:40:51] what the spirit saith
[1:40:58] or does it say he that hath the uh the
[1:41:01] the angel
[1:41:02] say what the Angels saith don't say that
[1:41:04] he that hath an ear
[1:41:06] hear with the angel doesn't say hear
[1:41:08] what it doesn't hear what the Angels
[1:41:10] said to say that he says hear what the
[1:41:11] spirit says
[1:41:13] that puts tongues interpretation thereof
[1:41:15] and prophecy Etc aside as the evidence
[1:41:17] the evidence is hearing what the spirit
[1:41:19] says the spirit is talking yes to the
[1:41:21] spirit is teaching amen
[1:41:24] amen see
[1:41:26] you've got to always take everything
[1:41:28] back to the scripture
[1:41:30] and then ask the Holy Ghost to for a
[1:41:33] full revelation of it
[1:41:35] sure
[1:41:37] now
[1:41:38] I'm at literally almost right before one
[1:41:40] hour here so give me a little bit longer
[1:41:42] here by God's grace he says in this
[1:41:45] Revelation he tells us what the now
[1:41:47] notice what why why is the Book of
[1:41:49] Revelation so important
[1:41:50] I was like this why are the four
[1:41:55] bugs important why are the four horse
[1:41:57] riders important why are the deeds and
[1:41:59] the claytons the the doctrines this
[1:42:01] doctors that why are those so important
[1:42:05] why do I blast those all the time
[1:42:07] look at this
[1:42:09] have you ever noticed how Satan hates
[1:42:11] two book of two books of the Bible more
[1:42:13] than all the others
[1:42:15] what's he what is what is evolution
[1:42:18] is a direct opposition to the book to
[1:42:22] Genesis 1 1.
[1:42:26] they're standing there teaching children
[1:42:30] the one of the greatest lies ever taught
[1:42:37] and they get them pumped up with all
[1:42:39] this space stuff and this and that and
[1:42:41] there's life out here there's life their
[1:42:42] Bible says there's only all living came
[1:42:44] from Eve
[1:42:47] that's a simple scripture
[1:42:49] have you ever noticed how Satan hates
[1:42:51] two books of the Bible more than others
[1:42:52] through liberal theologians there it is
[1:42:56] and pseudoscientists there it is
[1:43:00] he is always attacking the Book of
[1:43:02] Genesis and Revelation why we know why
[1:43:05] he attacked Genesis
[1:43:09] but why would he take revelation
[1:43:12] the last book
[1:43:14] in both these books we find Satan's
[1:43:18] origin
[1:43:21] his awful ways and his destruction
[1:43:25] well we know in Genesis is is origin is
[1:43:28] this where what is the origin in the
[1:43:30] Book of Revelation
[1:43:33] because remember
[1:43:35] there's Shadow and type
[1:43:37] the first bride fell
[1:43:40] the second bride fell by what
[1:43:44] Deeds of the Nickelodeon
[1:43:48] that is the revelation
[1:43:54] and then on and on and on
[1:43:58] one defilement of the wife brought forth
[1:44:00] what twins
[1:44:02] and then what came forth next
[1:44:05] a disagreement a fight in the field or
[1:44:08] the world
[1:44:09] and then what a Slaughter
[1:44:12] and then then comes what the mark of the
[1:44:13] beast
[1:44:15] it shows the origins
[1:44:18] Old Testament New Testament Origins
[1:44:21] and they're one and the same and God and
[1:44:24] Satan hates it so much that his what his
[1:44:27] actions and deeds are exposed
[1:44:29] and they're brought forth right and here
[1:44:31] in this they are age
[1:44:34] you know no other age knows what those
[1:44:35] things are
[1:44:36] no other age
[1:44:39] go on YouTube and just type in the deeds
[1:44:42] and the claytons
[1:44:44] hey the the Apostle or the the
[1:44:48] Nicholas
[1:44:50] or this and this or there was another
[1:44:51] group or this tribe or that tribe it
[1:44:53] goes it's insane
[1:44:55] we have the true revelation
[1:44:58] that is why he attacks them he hates to
[1:45:00] be what exposed
[1:45:03] and in those books he is exposed for
[1:45:06] exactly what he is Jesus said about
[1:45:09] Satan he has no part of me and I have no
[1:45:11] pardon him he says the devil would like
[1:45:13] to prove that different but he cannot so
[1:45:15] he does all he can to destroy confidence
[1:45:17] in the world
[1:45:22] he destroys what confidence in the word
[1:45:32] but when the church disbelieves Satan
[1:45:34] and believes the spirit's revelation
[1:45:37] believes the spiritual revelation of the
[1:45:39] word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:45:41] against her
[1:45:44] now why does he hate a revelation why
[1:45:47] isn't he so against Revelation it is
[1:45:50] because the entire Canon of God's word
[1:45:52] and God's church is soundly built upon
[1:45:55] revelation
[1:45:57] once we understand by spiritual
[1:46:00] Revelation what this is and what this is
[1:46:02] and what can this do we know in the
[1:46:05] scripture how to rightly divide it and
[1:46:07] we can find it here we can find it there
[1:46:10] we can find it here and this and what
[1:46:11] now it rings true that Revelation oh
[1:46:14] well brother uh brother brahm's absolute
[1:46:16] was uh or the rebel the absolute is the
[1:46:19] message well
[1:46:21] I'll say like this how do we know the
[1:46:22] prophet's Revelation was correct
[1:46:27] because he proved it and he ran it from
[1:46:31] Genesis to how many times I take this
[1:46:33] thing from genes to Revelation
[1:46:34] Revelation Genesis Genesis Revelation he
[1:46:36] brought all the way through he preached
[1:46:38] a thinking man's filter
[1:46:40] you can't bring a lie all the way
[1:46:43] through the scripture or the absolute
[1:46:45] see this thing's written this is a
[1:46:48] mystery book
[1:46:51] all right
[1:46:53] let me let me just jump we're going into
[1:46:55] 105 here let's let's jump I want to jump
[1:46:57] to something here
[1:46:58] and I want to show you something here
[1:47:01] you know this is very important here
[1:47:05] I have to dedicate more of my life to
[1:47:07] this
[1:47:08] more of my energy
[1:47:10] spiritual rewards storing up spiritual a
[1:47:14] treasure right here okay you read and
[1:47:17] take feed the Holy Ghost right
[1:47:19] now let me show you something here
[1:47:23] look at this
[1:47:25] now if there is an absolute if there is
[1:47:28] absolutely if there was a standard so
[1:47:30] important to God
[1:47:32] and there was something so precious to
[1:47:34] God
[1:47:36] and this was the only way to him and to
[1:47:39] eternal life
[1:47:40] would not he protect it
[1:47:43] he would put fire around about it he
[1:47:46] would put everything that if you go past
[1:47:48] this you're dead
[1:47:50] you're in big trouble
[1:47:54] people will miss eternity because
[1:48:00] of these things right here
[1:48:03] adding
[1:48:04] notice if any man shall add unto these
[1:48:07] things God shall add unto him the
[1:48:09] plagues that are written in this book
[1:48:13] now this is November what was it the
[1:48:15] book of the Bible
[1:48:17] the revelation of it
[1:48:19] the revelation of the Bible
[1:48:22] well brother the Bible says this yeah
[1:48:23] but what does it mean
[1:48:25] what is the correct Revelation add
[1:48:27] anything to the revelation of Jesus
[1:48:29] Christ
[1:48:30] which covers the entire scripture the
[1:48:31] whole Bible is a revelation of Jesus
[1:48:33] Christ it is it is it is he says and if
[1:48:37] any man shall take away
[1:48:39] take away from the words of this
[1:48:41] prophecy God shall take away his part
[1:48:43] out of the book of life out of the holy
[1:48:45] city and from the things which are
[1:48:46] written this book
[1:48:48] how important is this very very
[1:48:50] important this proves right here the
[1:48:52] Bible is the absolute
[1:48:55] because this is also recorded what I
[1:48:57] believe in Psalms or in Proverbs and
[1:48:59] also in Deuteronomy 4 the exact same
[1:49:01] thing is spoken
[1:49:06] now notice
[1:49:09] have you ever seen some of these
[1:49:10] brothers here
[1:49:13] that have dealt with
[1:49:15] Bible translations
[1:49:18] the living Bible by Kenneth Taylor
[1:49:23] the popular press May note of author
[1:49:25] Kenneth Taylor's loss of ability to talk
[1:49:27] Time Magazine 1972 mysteriously halfway
[1:49:31] through the fair paraphrase they must
[1:49:33] have been speaking with them
[1:49:33] interviewing Taylor lost his voice and
[1:49:36] still speaks in a horse whisper
[1:49:39] this is the guy that rewrote
[1:49:42] the Bible
[1:49:44] a psychiatric psychiatrist who examined
[1:49:47] him
[1:49:48] suggested that the veil The Voice
[1:49:50] failure was Taylor's psychological
[1:49:52] self-punishment for tampering with what
[1:49:54] he believed to be the word of God
[1:49:57] hmm
[1:49:58] a new version oh let's read new versions
[1:50:00] of the Bible God took away his ability
[1:50:03] to speak
[1:50:05] New American Standard Version
[1:50:07] also silence was Philip shaft
[1:50:11] collaborator of the new Greek committee
[1:50:13] and the director of American Standard
[1:50:15] Version which formed the foundation for
[1:50:17] The New American Standard Version
[1:50:20] he says and the living Bible
[1:50:23] paralleling Taylor's pathology shaft's
[1:50:26] son found the same frog in Philip
[1:50:28] Sharp's throat even as early as 1854 as
[1:50:32] a warn warning was given his voice was
[1:50:34] so affected that he could not speak in
[1:50:36] public as so to be heard
[1:50:38] finally by 19 or 1892 the power of
[1:50:43] articulation speech was
[1:50:45] gone
[1:50:49] adding and taking away from the
[1:50:52] scripture
[1:50:53] how many billions of people have read
[1:50:55] this version and missed it
[1:50:58] how many billions have read that Bible
[1:51:00] the living Bible and missed it
[1:51:07] 19 or 1893 still as his buddy would say
[1:51:12] he was derived from the power of speech
[1:51:14] up in Pride to his death could not speak
[1:51:18] new Greek Testament new Greek texts
[1:51:21] shaft himself writes uh uh SP whatever
[1:51:24] that is
[1:51:25] often the new Greek text which proceeded
[1:51:27] and strongly influenced the Westcott and
[1:51:29] revision of tregolis uh Chef writes he
[1:51:32] was certainly scarce able to speak
[1:51:36] audibly so once again here another
[1:51:38] record saying this man lost his ability
[1:51:41] to speak Russ got horse westcott's
[1:51:44] biography cites that in 1854 he was
[1:51:46] quite inaudible
[1:51:49] and by 1970s voice reached few and
[1:51:51] understood by even still fewer
[1:51:55] God is not playing around with these
[1:51:58] these men are in grave danger the Bible
[1:52:00] Jesus would say danger of Hellfire
[1:52:07] how many books how many words in the
[1:52:09] Book of Revelation in the Revelation
[1:52:10] Jesus Christ that they change
[1:52:12] and then when they change a word changed
[1:52:14] its meaning or revelation
[1:52:21] that's how careful we are to be carrying
[1:52:24] the word of God this is history this
[1:52:27] isn't even this ain't the message
[1:52:28] this is just history right here all
[1:52:31] history right there recorded
[1:52:34] B.J Phillips tells in his own biography
[1:52:37] the New Testament in Modern English he's
[1:52:39] the author of The whatever that new
[1:52:40] version of Bible
[1:52:42] I was still doing a fair measure of
[1:52:44] speaking in schools intrusions until the
[1:52:46] late summer of 1961 then sudden then
[1:52:49] quite suddenly my speaking writing and
[1:52:52] communication powers
[1:52:54] stopped
[1:52:56] notice many many men who've tampered
[1:52:59] with the word of God in revelation God
[1:53:01] took their ability to speak if you mess
[1:53:03] with God's words he's going to mess with
[1:53:05] your
[1:53:10] I was not in panic but I was certainly
[1:53:12] alarmed and then a few weeks rest
[1:53:14] brought no improvement I canceled all
[1:53:17] speaking engagements for the rest of the
[1:53:18] year age 55 the success of the price of
[1:53:22] success the title of autobiography the
[1:53:24] price of success
[1:53:26] was that Godly success was that the
[1:53:29] kingdom of God's success or was it the
[1:53:31] success what of a worldly man amen an
[1:53:34] unconverted natural man trying to handle
[1:53:37] something that's what's spiritual
[1:53:41] was he did he hear the spirit say what
[1:53:43] the spirit said to the churches
[1:53:45] not even close
[1:53:48] he didn't have to hear all he had to do
[1:53:50] was read the end of Revelation
[1:53:52] and he would have had the warning but he
[1:53:54] read past it
[1:53:56] he did not take heed he did not take it
[1:53:58] now notice most of these things take
[1:54:00] place what after the fact
[1:54:02] they did not realize
[1:54:04] what they were doing in fact he
[1:54:06] continued what teaching in schools and
[1:54:08] in churches he thought he was doing the
[1:54:11] will of God
[1:54:13] and then when judgment Struck it was too
[1:54:15] late
[1:54:18] the speech was uh Sphinx syndrome can be
[1:54:21] happening can happen even to a Believer
[1:54:23] and I notice they try and bring it back
[1:54:24] to the scripture but remember Zacharias
[1:54:26] will smoke what a dumb because what he
[1:54:29] disbelieved the word of God
[1:54:32] oh my there it is
[1:54:37] man
[1:54:38] now hmm interesting huh
[1:54:42] let's stand here by God's grace
[1:54:44] Malachi 2 10. having another one father
[1:54:47] hath not God created us all that's what
[1:54:50] they're saying we're all one we all
[1:54:51] believe the same God
[1:54:52] why do you deal treacherously with every
[1:54:54] man against his brother by profaning the
[1:54:57] Covenant of our fathers
[1:54:59] Judah hath dealt freshly and an
[1:55:01] Abominations committed in Israel and in
[1:55:03] Jerusalem for Judah professed or sorry
[1:55:05] profane the Holiness of the Lord which
[1:55:07] he loved and has married the daughter of
[1:55:09] estranged God sounds like denomination
[1:55:12] sounds like Trinity sounds like who
[1:55:13] knows what you want to say it the Lord
[1:55:16] will cut off the man that doeth this the
[1:55:18] master and The Scholar
[1:55:21] you start profaning or doing things
[1:55:23] contrary to the word of God he'll even
[1:55:26] cut the master and the scholar off
[1:55:28] it does not matter do you have the
[1:55:31] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:55:34] amen
[1:55:40] as we all have a
[1:55:42] it's kind of got just a little little
[1:55:44] short little study there just on the
[1:55:46] absolute I hope you're able to see
[1:55:48] the importance
[1:55:50] of the sincerity uh the Holiness and
[1:55:54] reverence we must approach with reading
[1:55:55] the word of God and making a judgment
[1:55:58] call on the word
[1:56:02] you know even Christ himself had an
[1:56:04] absolute
[1:56:06] what was Christ's absolute
[1:56:08] he was he was led like a lamb
[1:56:12] God used him for three years
[1:56:14] and then they come down to one final
[1:56:16] final moment
[1:56:19] he knew his Destiny was to die
[1:56:21] for a sacrifice for all Humanity right
[1:56:25] you know the prophet of God said Jesus
[1:56:26] Christ looked at one scripture and had
[1:56:28] faith in it and this became his absolute
[1:56:33] the prophet God said he says and Jesus
[1:56:35] come to that moment he said and he had
[1:56:36] one absolute he spoke with one scripture
[1:56:38] what that God was faithful what he says
[1:56:42] for he will not leave my soul in Hell
[1:56:44] neither will thou suffer my Holy One to
[1:56:46] see corruption and Christ held on to
[1:56:49] that
[1:56:51] and about the fourth day
[1:56:54] Christ when the Holy Ghost came down the
[1:56:57] spirit of God came down and resurrected
[1:56:59] the sun resurrected that body what and
[1:57:01] what he right now he becomes what the
[1:57:03] Lord of lords and King of Kings amen
[1:57:05] what God now changes permanent residence
[1:57:07] in his body
[1:57:11] God in flesh Lord
[1:57:16] amen
[1:57:18] and when a woman goes out and lives with
[1:57:20] another man or a man with another woman
[1:57:21] when they're married to them they are
[1:57:23] defiling their own flesh and when a
[1:57:25] person says that he is a Christian and
[1:57:27] will absolutely deny the scripture being
[1:57:30] right
[1:57:33] you say the message
[1:57:37] the scripture the revelation of the
[1:57:39] scripture he's committing adultery
[1:57:42] against the body that he claims to be in
[1:57:45] see it's it's it's a mark of the
[1:57:47] Antichrist so much that we're deceive
[1:57:49] the elect if possible
[1:57:53] so let's say a word of Prayer
[1:57:56] let's just raise our hands and think on
[1:57:58] these things
[1:58:01] Tommy would say we just want to follow
[1:58:03] the lord better and better
[1:58:06] lore
[1:58:08] though earthquakes may happen
[1:58:11] fire may run Ablaze
[1:58:13] this may happen that may happen but Lord
[1:58:16] help us Lord to hear the voice of your
[1:58:19] spirit
[1:58:21] Lord Jesus Lord we want to hear that
[1:58:23] still Small Voice and Lord we know it'll
[1:58:27] be the still Small Voice or your your
[1:58:28] words your spirit speaking to us because
[1:58:31] Lord it'll Echo back into the scripture
[1:58:34] Lord is this you if this is your word
[1:58:37] Lord and it is Lord It'll point back to
[1:58:40] the Bible and Lord God though maybe a
[1:58:42] verse we may not understand or a
[1:58:44] direction or instruction we may
[1:58:46] understand Lord but Lord you give us the
[1:58:47] Revelation on that hour that day
[1:58:51] surely Lord
[1:58:53] the darkness is forming over the earth
[1:58:56] once again
[1:58:59] Lord I wonder if it's almost as dark
[1:59:00] lord as when you Saul in Genesis 1 1
[1:59:04] Darkness cover the Deep
[1:59:07] no data without form and void Lord and
[1:59:09] how dark it was when you and the Holy
[1:59:11] Ghost you came as as your light
[1:59:14] and Lord you became the
[1:59:17] brewed the Earth God or to bring forth
[1:59:19] life
[1:59:20] Lord now Lord right now Lord you're
[1:59:22] looking on this Darkness
[1:59:26] a land where there's no faith you said
[1:59:28] Lord when the son of man comes really
[1:59:30] find Faith Lord
[1:59:32] that faith is through equal Lord to
[1:59:36] revelation
[1:59:41] of the word Lord is such a great way and
[1:59:45] a great manner
[1:59:47] with such a higher level God
[1:59:50] a greater tear Lord God lord your full
[1:59:53] measured Lord God lord to a full
[1:59:55] revelation of the very mind of Christ
[1:59:58] place it in a storm the Lord may we
[2:00:01] weigh every word that's being preached
[2:00:03] into all
[2:00:05] Lord every word that comes in our minds
