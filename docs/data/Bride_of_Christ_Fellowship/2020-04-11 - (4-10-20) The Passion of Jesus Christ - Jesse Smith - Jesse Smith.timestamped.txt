[30:01] other the standing take our Bibles here
[30:03] tonight by God's grace you know one of
[30:08] my daughters I think it was Haven or
[30:09] Karis ask me why they call it Good
[30:11] Friday Daddy and they were so sad that
[30:13] Jesus died and I said it was sad for him
[30:15] but good for us praise God
[30:17] thank God very sad for him great
[30:22] suffering but yet the Bible said he had
[30:25] joy for the joy that was set before him
[30:28] he was suffering totally completely as a
[30:32] man but yet inside of his soul there was
[30:34] some joy present hard to explain it's a
[30:38] paradox as brother Branham said all
[30:40] God's promises and his purposes are
[30:43] paradoxes but thank God for His mercy
[30:45] let's go to let's start with our memory
[30:48] verse rather Philippians four seven and
[30:50] eight and then we'll get to our text out
[30:52] of Acts chapter one so Philippians four
[30:59] seven and eight like to greet everybody
[31:03] here by God's grace good to see the
[31:05] Saints in the house the Lord tonight
[31:06] praise God and greet all the saints live
[31:08] streaming I trust everybody is thankful
[31:19] for God's protection upon their family I
[31:21] was texting brother Jim schumake from
[31:23] Pennsylvania and a couple other brothers
[31:26] and they said no one in their churches
[31:28] has had the virus so we're very thankful
[31:29] for that the only one I know of would be
[31:31] BCF or the Chad lambs Church it was
[31:35] reported to have a couple cases but
[31:37] we're thankful for God's mercy and his
[31:40] protection and we'll just keep trusting
[31:43] in the Lord to keep us healthy
[31:45] oh yeah sir brother Brooks did send his
[31:47] greetings he sent me a text today the
[31:49] brook sends his greetings or willingness
[31:51] if
[31:52] they open up the states by then we'll
[31:53] have him at the end of the month in May
[31:55] we'll see we had to cancel to preachers
[31:58] so far brother Matthew McLeod and
[32:00] brother Gino from New York he said he's
[32:04] actually he's in New York he said he's
[32:05] actually seen a couple people died he
[32:07] didn't say if there were church members
[32:08] or not but he lives right there in the
[32:10] heart of New York he says they've had
[32:12] he's had to go or they've had to hear
[32:15] about some funerals of some people they
[32:16] know so it's it's you know of course
[32:20] it's in certain places more than others
[32:22] so let's just remember as we pray later
[32:26] let's remember them continue remember
[32:27] them in prayers we did earlier
[32:29] Philippians four seven and eight let's
[32:30] read these scriptures together ask the
[32:33] Lord to write these upon our hearts
[32:34] Philippians 4:7 let's read it on three
[32:37] one two three and the peace of God which
[32:41] passeth all understanding shall keep
[32:43] your hearts and minds through Christ
[32:45] Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things
[32:49] are true whatsoever things are honest
[32:53] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[32:55] things are pure whatsoever things are of
[32:59] good report if there be any virtue and
[33:03] if there be any praise think on these
[33:06] things praise God let's go to Acts
[33:08] chapter one verse three I just want to
[33:10] read one scripture out of here
[33:13] did I skip a line on that memory verse
[33:15] okay forgive me I thought I was trying
[33:18] to close my eyes and try to remember the
[33:20] next coming words so forgive me
[33:23] acts 1:3 I'd like to speak on a very
[33:27] simple topic the passion of Jesus Christ
[33:29] so we want to look at this one scripture
[33:31] of course that's where the movie gets
[33:33] its title from Acts chapter one verse
[33:36] three
[33:39] what a strange English word for us
[33:43] passion passion but the word means
[33:46] suffering Acts chapter one verse three
[33:51] let's read that together one two three
[33:52] to whom also he shewed himself alive
[33:56] after his passion by many infallible
[33:59] proofs being seen of them forty days and
[34:03] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[34:07] kingdom of God let's have one more word
[34:08] of Prayer if you ever need on your heart
[34:09] let's make it known unto God
[34:10] let's pray again for the Saints there in
[34:12] New York and those impacted Heavenly
[34:15] Father we love you Lord God we
[34:17] appreciate these scriptures we're in a
[34:18] meditate on things that are pure good
[34:20] holy of good report honest and true
[34:23] we're meditating on those things Lord
[34:26] and as we think about our friends in New
[34:27] York we just pray God Lord that you'll
[34:29] protect them bring healing to those that
[34:31] are sick and afflicted Lord God we know
[34:33] you're a healer we know Lord you'd love
[34:35] to do the supernatural prayer you'd
[34:37] manifest yourself in that way be with
[34:39] brother Gino Lord
[34:40] associate pastor there and brother the
[34:44] lead pastor there brother Avon Lord God
[34:47] just help them Lord there in the midst
[34:49] of a great trial so Lord I pray you
[34:51] raise up a standard by the blood of
[34:53] Jesus Christ father bless us here
[34:55] tonight as we look to you for communion
[34:56] Lord we know communion means to talk
[34:59] with Lord and so we're gonna talk with
[35:01] you Lord here at the mercy seat here at
[35:04] the presence of God and or just bless us
[35:07] here in your divine presence meet every
[35:08] need I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[35:10] and the Saints said Amen god bless she's
[35:13] been asleep praise God I don't know if
[35:18] you notice it but we got a new container
[35:20] and wine there it's our last once after
[35:21] that we have to start buying them
[35:23] brother Kim gave me a good link he has
[35:24] to buy his now cuz the brother that used
[35:27] to make them he's no longer in the
[35:28] message he left the message brother I
[35:30] don't wanna name his name yeah I got to
[35:32] be more careful anyways the homemade
[35:35] wine that we bought
[35:36] that's from 2010 so that's 20 yup so
[35:38] that's 10 years old rather we bought
[35:40] those you know ten years ago so after
[35:43] that but the cam gave me a good Jewish
[35:44] company that makes wine and I think it's
[35:48] made according to the Jewish laws so
[35:50] after that we'll get that and also
[35:52] tonight we'll be having separate cups
[35:53] for everybody just so no one's concerned
[35:55] about germs and everything we want to
[35:57] use wisdom and we want to do what's
[36:00] right praise God so I want to look at
[36:02] this thought here tonight
[36:03] the
[36:04] of the christ' a passion of Jesus Christ
[36:07] rather and we're using a couple of
[36:10] references I found the article here from
[36:14] a doctor just to kind of go through the
[36:16] medical aspects of the crucifixion
[36:18] I watched fear for videos on it this
[36:20] week and kind of just just sobering to
[36:23] see what all Christ went through but I
[36:26] want to start by first looking at the
[36:27] word passion and the Greek it means it
[36:32] means suffering vexation afflicted it
[36:36] can mean bad plight so the scripture
[36:39] says to him also he showed himself alive
[36:41] after his passion and so Jesus Christ
[36:46] suffered a great passion a great
[36:48] vexation and a great suffering it's
[36:53] interesting they you know chose the word
[36:55] the the interpreters of the Hebrew and
[36:58] Greek rather the Greek when they wrote
[37:01] this in the King James Version I think
[37:04] it kind of is a appropriate word because
[37:07] we know Jesus had the joy that was set
[37:09] before him and it was his passion now
[37:12] this is a different word different
[37:13] definition of passion like we would say
[37:15] in a passion enthusiasm we know Jesus
[37:17] did have that yet enthusiasm to do the
[37:20] will of God praise the Lord no matter
[37:22] what the father asked him he was willing
[37:24] to do it I remember as we'll get to
[37:27] tonight we looked at Scripture later he
[37:29] said he taught his disciples at the Last
[37:30] Supper he said with desire have I
[37:34] desired to have this food with you so
[37:37] Jesus had a great love and a great
[37:38] passion to be with his disciples one
[37:42] last time before his going away but we
[37:46] know he came back in a great way praise
[37:48] God by the Holy Spirit and so we see
[37:52] that this is mentioning Christ's passion
[37:55] and then he gave many infallible proofs
[37:57] well I wanted to run that word passion
[38:00] down through the New Testament and I
[38:01] just pulled out a few scriptures Matthew
[38:04] 16 Jesus is telling Peter he's got the
[38:08] keys of the kingdom he's gonna build the
[38:09] church upon the revelation of who he is
[38:11] as we said on Wednesday night that
[38:14] revelation is the absolute praise God
[38:17] the revelation is the spirits revealing
[38:21] of God's truth to you and I brother man
[38:24] said upon this absolute I'll build my
[38:26] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[38:28] prevail against it amen
[38:30] I'll tell you it's been prevailing these
[38:31] last 21 years in my life praise God
[38:33] since 1999 amen this this revelation of
[38:38] Jesus Christ has been preserving me and
[38:42] helping me overcome the gates of Hell
[38:44] praise God
[38:45] amen so we thank the Lord for that he
[38:48] said but from that time in Matthew 16:21
[38:51] forth Jesus began to shew unto his
[38:54] disciples how that he must go unto
[38:56] Jerusalem and suffer many things of the
[38:58] elders and chief priests and scribes and
[39:01] be killed and be raised again the third
[39:04] day
[39:05] and that's when Peter took him and shook
[39:07] him and said he rebuked him and said be
[39:09] it far from thee Lord this shall not be
[39:11] unto thee and of course Jesus said get
[39:14] behind me Satan
[39:15] because he knew it was his purpose in
[39:18] life to take the cross to take the shame
[39:21] he knew he was the Lamb of God to take
[39:23] away the sin of the world praise God
[39:24] just as John the Baptist knew it and
[39:26] announced it he said that's the Lamb of
[39:28] God he takes away the sin of the world
[39:30] so he showed how he must suffer notice
[39:33] many things had to suffer many many
[39:37] beatings as we'll see in a moment many
[39:40] slaps and many whippings and spinnings
[39:43] and he suffered many things and he had
[39:46] to do it in order to take the full brunt
[39:48] of sins punishment in matthew 17 12
[39:53] Jesus tells Peter and John he said but I
[39:56] say anew that he lies has come already
[39:57] and they knew him not speaking of John
[40:00] the Baptist but have done unto him
[40:02] whatsoever they listed likewise shall
[40:05] also the Son of man suffer of them
[40:08] interesting Jesus is again saying look
[40:11] how John the Baptist was killed he said
[40:13] I must suffer as well I must have a
[40:15] passion as well a vexation suffering of
[40:19] them and notice it was the same spirit
[40:20] that killed him right the same Roman
[40:22] spirit right with Herod and his Herodias
[40:25] that same spirit on Pontius Pilate then
[40:28] upon the Jews the same spirit and church
[40:31] say like this it's the same spirit we're
[40:32] battling today praise God that religious
[40:36] spirit right that loves to exalt man's
[40:38] ways and and man's greed above the
[40:41] things of God and wants to have a self
[40:44] righteousness to try to make it to
[40:47] heaven and and and declare themselves
[40:50] righteous but there's only one
[40:52] righteousness and that's through the
[40:53] will of God that's through repentance
[40:55] that's through water baptism that's
[40:58] through the the gospel of Jesus Christ
[41:00] I'm thankful to be a gospel preacher
[41:02] amen we're preaching good news tonight
[41:04] praise God that Christ died for the
[41:07] sinners the righteous for the
[41:08] unrighteous I'm glad to be a gospel Holy
[41:11] Ghost field preacher amen
[41:12] the good news of God is being preached
[41:15] tonight praise God hallelujah it's a
[41:17] great gospel Jesus uses us again he's
[41:21] talking to his disciples now in Luke 17
[41:23] 24 he said for as though this is the
[41:26] second coming this is the rapture for as
[41:28] lightning that lighteth out of the one
[41:31] part under heaven shine ahthe under the
[41:33] other part under heaven so also shall
[41:35] the Son of Man be in his day did you
[41:38] guys all have a bad storm in Akron on
[41:40] was it Monday night or was it Tuesday
[41:42] night we had an awful storm we drove
[41:44] just one mile up the road there was
[41:46] proud there was probably 10 or 12 trees
[41:48] just ripped right out of the ground and
[41:50] they were without power for two days it
[41:53] was just it was just awful storm out I
[41:55] don't know how was it bad for you guys
[41:56] up here it was awful but that was a
[42:00] lightning storm I think the girl said
[42:01] there was a lightning storm and there
[42:02] was hail and everything and Jesus likens
[42:05] his coming to the swiftness of lightning
[42:07] the second time it's gonna be like
[42:10] lightning like the Bible said in a
[42:12] moment of twinkling of an eye but Jesus
[42:15] says in verse 25 but he says first must
[42:19] he suffer many things and be rejected of
[42:23] this generation praise God
[42:25] so there was a suffering first before
[42:29] the lightning coming there was a slow oh
[42:32] my imagine imagine jesus's flesh wish
[42:36] wished his death could have been
[42:38] lightning but instead it was a slow
[42:40] drawn-out process not like lightning not
[42:44] like lightning
[42:45] but slow and draw it out and he said I
[42:48] must suffer many things but he said the
[42:51] second coveting is like lightning praise
[42:53] God amen oh thank God hallelujah that
[42:57] what will be changed will be ready we
[42:59] must be ready at all times amen and
[43:02] we'll be ready cuz it'll come like
[43:03] lightning thank the Lord
[43:05] Luke 22 15 jesus said he's sending them
[43:09] with desire have I desired to eat this
[43:11] Passover with you before I suffer for I
[43:17] say unto you I will not anymore eat
[43:19] thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[43:21] kingdom of God
[43:23] so again Jesus keeps mentioning the
[43:26] suffering the suffering and we know he's
[43:28] called the suffering servant praise God
[43:31] Jesus Christ the suffering servant so he
[43:34] said I want to have one last communion
[43:36] with you praise God I know one last meal
[43:39] with you before I suffer and he did
[43:42] after he died and rose again he he's
[43:45] reminding the disciples in knew 24 he
[43:48] said o fools and slow of heart to
[43:50] believe all that the prophets have
[43:52] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[43:55] these things and to enter into his glory
[43:59] praise God hallelujah so what came first
[44:03] first came suffering then comes glory
[44:05] same for you and I praise God we want to
[44:08] see the rapture but I imagine there
[44:10] first must be suffering and then glory
[44:12] praise God Amen hallelujah we notice for
[44:16] Israel suffering right the suffering of
[44:19] the the martyrs during the Holocaust and
[44:22] all down through the ages they're
[44:23] blinded they must suffer but then comes
[44:26] the glory praise God the Bible said I
[44:29] read it this week Zechariah 13 they must
[44:31] suffer first all nations will come
[44:33] against them the Pope's going to break
[44:35] the covenant they must suffer first but
[44:37] then comes the glory a fountain is going
[44:40] to break forth a fountain will open in
[44:42] the house of David praise God amen it's
[44:45] the desert spiritually now for the Jew
[44:47] it's a desert but in that day after the
[44:50] two prophets are raptured Jesus reveals
[44:52] himself and a fountain opens and then
[44:55] they can weep and cry from house a house
[44:57] just like you and I we
[44:58] cry for Jesus today Bray's God amen why
[45:01] could the fountains open for us amen we
[45:04] sang about earlier
[45:06] the fountain is open in the house of God
[45:08] today amen but one day that fountain
[45:11] will open for them praise God suffering
[45:14] first and then the glory later praise
[45:16] God that's the reason people don't get
[45:18] born again in churches whether it's
[45:19] Methodist Baptist message Presbyterian
[45:21] they don't die enough to self praise God
[45:24] they don't die out through prayer they
[45:27] don't want to be born in a born-again
[45:28] enough they still want to hold on to the
[45:31] things of the world right
[45:32] they have foolish desire still but a
[45:35] Christian in a real Holy Ghost filled
[45:36] believer before that time of being
[45:39] filled is able to die out and sell out
[45:41] right like sell out in order to have the
[45:44] pearl of great price amen oh thank you
[45:46] lord amen it's a it's a level of
[45:49] suffering praise God it's a level of
[45:51] dying no it's a level of a pain and
[45:54] sanctification praise God
[45:56] as far as dying out to your own will
[45:59] thank the Lord
[46:01] so he says art Christ to have suffered
[46:03] these things and enter into his glory
[46:06] not Church the look at that during his
[46:09] whole ministry he's telling them I'm
[46:10] going to suffer they just don't catch it
[46:12] they don't get it right none of us would
[46:13] have got it either but he kept reminding
[46:15] them I have to suffer I'm gonna suffer
[46:18] great things but afterwards I'll be
[46:19] glorified they didn't catch it till
[46:21] afterwards so much so that Jesus is
[46:25] right there
[46:25] resurrected trying to tell them he's
[46:27] trying to remind them of what he said
[46:29] praise God my look how merciful Church I
[46:33] say like this
[46:33] look how merciful God was in his first
[46:35] coming and I'll say like this if he's
[46:37] merciful the first coming he'll be
[46:38] merciful the second coming praise God in
[46:41] other words will cuts the revelation for
[46:43] the rapture at the right time praise God
[46:45] and if we die beforehand will surely
[46:47] catch it on the other side for the dead
[46:49] in Christ will rise first amen the voice
[46:52] of the resurrection the same voice that
[46:54] called Lazarus Lazarus come forth will
[46:56] call all the dead in Christ bride call
[46:59] them forth and they'll be raised first
[47:01] hallelujah thank the Lord
[47:05] now there's a beautiful
[47:07] scripture I want to
[47:11] well we're almost there but in Luke 24
[47:13] 45 then he opened their understanding
[47:16] that they might understand the scripture
[47:17] I can relate to that
[47:19] I remember reading my Bible for 18 years
[47:21] my mom dragging me to church and I
[47:23] didn't understand any of it I had no
[47:24] understanding but when I finally
[47:26] repented at the athletes and action
[47:28] conference it seemed like it just
[47:29] started to all make sense Ray's God it's
[47:31] like he just opened my understanding
[47:33] that when the message come it was like a
[47:35] total explosion praise God an explosion
[47:38] of Revelation through the Holy Spirit so
[47:40] Christ opens our understanding that we
[47:43] might understand the scriptures verse 46
[47:46] and he said thus it is written and thus
[47:48] it behaved or was necessary for Christ
[47:52] to suffer it believed him it was
[47:54] necessary for him to suffer and to rise
[47:56] from the dead the third day and that
[47:59] repentance and remission of sins should
[48:01] be preached in his name praise God among
[48:05] all nations beginning at Jerusalem
[48:09] hallelujah now if you have your Bibles
[48:11] let's go to acts 3:18 I just want to
[48:14] read this and I want to I just want to
[48:15] give like a a real fast list of all
[48:19] these prophecies that Jesus fulfilled
[48:21] because there's a list of them here
[48:23] brother and I think does that and the
[48:25] message what is it traction on the
[48:27] mountain he lists all these scriptures
[48:29] that were fulfilled and I found another
[48:32] list I want to read those as well so
[48:35] acts 3:18 thank you good kitchen but
[48:39] those things which God before had showed
[48:41] by the mouth listen of all his prophets
[48:44] that Christ should suffer he hath so
[48:49] fulfilled the member church this even
[48:52] includes God the prophet because God was
[48:54] the first one who prophesied of Jesus's
[48:56] death right he said the serpent will
[49:00] bruise his heel but Jesus will bruises
[49:02] had amen so the very first one who
[49:05] talked about the suffering Messiah was
[49:08] God himself amen
[49:09] God prophesied that as the god prophet
[49:12] the capital P right prophet God prophet
[49:16] prophesied to Adam and Eve but the Bible
[49:18] said all these prophets prophesied that
[49:21] Christ should suffer praise God
[49:24] now let's go through a quick list here I
[49:26] want to just go through a quick list and
[49:28] you can see all the all the prophecies
[49:32] David and Psalms 41 said that Jesus
[49:36] Christ would be betrayed by a close
[49:38] friend we know that was Judas and then
[49:43] zechariah 11 said that a price will be
[49:45] paid to Judas for betraying Jesus look
[49:48] so here we have David and Zechariah in
[49:50] 1113 said the amount would be money
[49:54] thirty pieces of silver zechariah then
[49:58] said he'd be forsaken by his disciples
[50:00] right as a sheep scattered from the
[50:03] shepherd David then said there be false
[50:05] witnesses against Christ in Psalms 27 12
[50:08] and Psalms 30:5 11 then Isaiah so now we
[50:13] got three right got Isaiah Zechariah and
[50:16] David Isaiah said he would not open his
[50:18] mouth to defend himself against the
[50:20] false accusations
[50:21] that's what acts 3 says there it says
[50:26] all the holy prophets spoke of his
[50:28] suffering Church we get betrayed by one
[50:31] friend and we feel like the end of the
[50:32] world is gonna end
[50:33] great Jesus will not only betrayed by
[50:36] Judas but all disciples forsook him his
[50:40] very closest ones forsook him the Bible
[50:44] said all we like sheep have been
[50:46] scattering then none of us would have
[50:48] let another women none of the women Rowe
[50:51] went through all that now they were
[50:53] there at the cross when he was crucified
[50:54] but where were they all the other times
[50:57] so all we like sheep would have
[51:00] abandoned him I and yet he knew it but
[51:04] yet he did it for the glory and the joy
[51:06] that was set before him praise God amen
[51:09] he was going to prove that there was
[51:11] nothing good in man there was nothing in
[51:13] man to save himself he needed help he
[51:15] needed help from the Savior praise God
[51:17] he needed help from God spirit because
[51:19] man's spirit was insufficient and so
[51:22] godly and every man and woman fall short
[51:24] of God's glory in order to forgive him
[51:26] and give him an internal power an inner
[51:29] man power that came on the day of
[51:31] Pentecost amen
[51:32] dori and there Peter would say don't
[51:36] crucify me like my
[51:38] Lord make me crucified upside down he
[51:42] was so in love with Jesus and so one to
[51:44] be like him and knew how little he was
[51:46] compared to Jesus I was looking at that
[51:49] today you remember there was two
[51:51] messengers to the the New Testament
[51:53] Peter was the messenger to the
[51:55] circumcision the Jews Paul was the
[51:58] messenger to the Gentiles the Gentile
[52:00] dispensation - of some of the biggest
[52:03] failures we'd say but listen we would
[52:06] have failed - but Peter said I'll die
[52:09] with you I'll never forsake you and with
[52:11] enough matter a few hours he's cursing
[52:14] and denying that even knows Christ yet
[52:17] God said I'm gonna choose him he's gonna
[52:18] he's gonna take the gospel to the Jews
[52:21] amen see God had to choose somebody that
[52:24] would fail but then someone that would
[52:26] accept pardon amen someone that it would
[52:29] accept forgiveness and someone that
[52:31] would accept the Holy Spirit because he
[52:32] knew his spirit wasn't strong enough he
[52:35] tried but he wasn't able to do it so he
[52:37] knew he needed the Holy Spirit and God
[52:39] sent him the Holy Spirit amen
[52:41] and then Paul was on the other spectrum
[52:43] he hated Jesus he would drag him off he
[52:46] would drag him to jail and try to get
[52:48] him blasting blasting blaspheme he would
[52:51] do such that you would say such awful
[52:52] things he would hold coat so Christians
[52:54] could die and yet God said I'm gonna
[52:57] choose him a man
[52:58] he's kicking against the pricks he's
[53:00] just hurting himself but I know deep
[53:02] down in that heart he wants truth amen
[53:04] he wants righteousness he really wants
[53:07] to live right
[53:07] he's got zeal but zeal for the law wait
[53:09] till you get the zeal for the gospel
[53:11] praise God he'll go on three missionary
[53:14] trips the greatest missionaries there
[53:15] ever was a men survived all those
[53:17] shipwrecks and took the beatings met
[53:19] numerous beatings thirty-nine forty
[53:22] stripes save one five times I believe
[53:24] endured all that for the gospel sakes
[53:27] and he said I bear my body the marks of
[53:29] a Christian a man a man said the only
[53:31] thing I can do is bear the marks in my
[53:33] vocal cords that's about medicine he
[53:36] said I'm happy to do that praise God if
[53:39] we can't do anything else let us give
[53:41] whatever we can energies our bodies
[53:43] let's bear our bodies the marks of Jesus
[53:45] Christ
[53:46] whatever God calls us to give
[53:49] so look at these these are the ones that
[53:52] God chose mine what a choosing but now
[53:59] let's get back to more of the prophecies
[54:00] memory God's prophesied in genesis 3:15
[54:03] isaiah said he'd be scourge in isaiah 50
[54:08] verse 6 david said his body would be
[54:12] brutalized and so did isaiah in psalms
[54:15] 22 in Isaiah 52 Isaiah 53 of course
[54:19] we'll get to that just a moment the
[54:20] beautiful chapter on Jesus's crucifixion
[54:24] that's why I told camera one time I made
[54:27] camera I kind of did a will and I sent
[54:28] the cam a couple of years ago I said if
[54:30] I die and have a funeral make sure you
[54:32] play make sure you read Isaiah 53 praise
[54:35] God that's the greatest scripture amen
[54:37] because we were woo he was wounded for
[54:40] our transgressions but with His stripes
[54:41] we are healed amen
[54:43] it paints all of us as little sheep that
[54:46] run away but God's mercy draws them all
[54:48] back together and heals them praise God
[54:51] our own sins curse us our own sins
[54:54] separate us from God but God in His love
[54:57] he said but his Messiah will see his
[55:01] seed praise God he will see his sheep
[55:03] return amen he'll give them life he'll
[55:05] give them fountains of waters I'm one of
[55:07] those praise God I ran from the shepherd
[55:10] but I came back by his grace I heard his
[55:12] call and he gave me the Living Waters
[55:14] amen
[55:15] that's right Psalm 69 said there would
[55:21] be shame reproach and dishonor and his
[55:23] adversaries would howl on him like dogs
[55:27] I saw him 22 and Zechariah says his
[55:32] hands and feet would be pierced Isaiah
[55:35] 53 he'd be numbered with the
[55:36] transgressors Psalm 22 and 109 said the
[55:40] observers would shake their heads at him
[55:42] Psalm 22 seven and eight he'd be reviled
[55:46] and mocked by the crowd and intercession
[55:51] for sinners and those killing him yes we
[55:53] see that Psalm 22 they'd part his
[55:56] garments and cast lots for his clothes
[56:00] the Bible said
[56:02] this that his bones stared at him on the
[56:04] cross Oh picture that on the cross he
[56:06] can barely lift his head his bones
[56:08] beneath are staring at him now none of
[56:10] them were broken right because the word
[56:12] couldn't be broken hey Laurie
[56:14] the word couldn't be broken but his
[56:17] bones were so exposed as he stood there
[56:20] now they I'm gonna read a little bout
[56:22] the description there but he must have
[56:24] been looking down and see his ribs
[56:25] exposed and perhaps maybe even his femur
[56:29] there his bones were just exposed and he
[56:32] says my bone stare at me Psalm 38 said
[56:38] his family and friends would observe his
[56:40] crucifixion Psalm 22 said he was
[56:42] forsaken by God Psalm 22 said his side
[56:46] would be pierced Psalm 69 said they give
[56:49] him vinegar to drink some 31 said he
[56:53] would commit my spirit under the father
[56:55] into thy hands I commit my spirit
[56:58] Exodus 12 43 in Psalms 34 said none of
[57:01] his bones would be broken praise God
[57:05] he'd be buried in the tomb of a rich man
[57:07] Isaiah 53 he'd be resurrected a man in
[57:10] Psalm 16 hallelujah praise God and his
[57:13] ascension to the Father's right hand
[57:15] Psalms 68 18 praise God thank the Lord
[57:20] now I just want to go through this I'm
[57:24] not sure if I ever went through this
[57:26] with you but I just want to go quickly
[57:28] through this did you ever think about
[57:32] the night he was arrested about what
[57:35] hours that he experienced all this
[57:37] trouble I went back and I saw I was
[57:39] listening to some of these teachings and
[57:41] I thought nah I never even thought about
[57:42] that so according to history in the
[57:47] Hebrew history this one reference says
[57:49] that Jesus started the Passover at 6:00
[57:52] p.m. on the Thursday night
[57:55] and it lasted till about 10:00 p.m. so
[58:00] of course that would include you know
[58:01] he's washed all their feet he started
[58:03] given the communion as well he said with
[58:05] desire of desire to do this and at some
[58:08] point Judas he said go do what you have
[58:09] to do and he gave him the SUP and he
[58:11] left and the Bible said after about ten
[58:14] o'clock they started making their way to
[58:16] the
[58:16] garden of gethsemane and the Bible said
[58:18] they sang hymns and that's where Jesus
[58:20] on their way there is just a few short
[58:22] meters maybe 50 meters away they were
[58:25] singing it Jesus at some point stopped
[58:27] singing and he starts preaching about
[58:28] John 14 16 and 17 he start preaching
[58:32] about the Holy Ghost he's God amen and
[58:35] then John 17 he said he said I'll be one
[58:39] you'll be one you'll be in me I ain't
[58:41] you and I in the father praise God he
[58:42] talks about the oneness of God amen
[58:45] through the Holy Spirit some in his last
[58:48] words of sermons were about the Holy
[58:50] Spirit it wasn't to the crowd it was to
[58:53] the elected a man here's to the elect
[58:55] apostles praise God given that less just
[58:59] word fulfillment and promise about the
[59:01] Holy Spirit praise God and now we read
[59:04] it today and we see in that very text
[59:06] where Jesus gives us the evidence of the
[59:09] Holy Ghost because the Holy Spirit will
[59:11] make you speak in tongues no the Holy
[59:13] Spirit will make you shout no the Holy
[59:15] Spirit will guide you into all truth of
[59:17] God's Word
[59:18] amen you ought to have some emotion when
[59:21] you get born again something has to
[59:23] happen praise God but after that the
[59:25] Holy Spirit as proof will guide you
[59:28] deeper into the things of God into the
[59:30] Word of God amen
[59:32] ah so he gets there according this he
[59:37] about 10:00 p.m. he makes his way over
[59:40] there to the garden and he tells the
[59:42] three here I'm gonna go pray you stay
[59:44] right here watch with me and he goes
[59:46] prays three times and this is where his
[59:50] suffering starts it's the great drops of
[59:52] blood as he prays now this condition is
[59:55] called FEMA to hydrosis and maybe one of
[59:58] you can correct me on if I pronounced it
[1:00:01] it's where the capillary blood vessels
[1:00:04] feed the sweat glands they rupture
[1:00:07] causing them to express blood it's seen
[1:00:10] many times in soldiers or people
[1:00:13] suffering that are on the brink of death
[1:00:15] and they they have so much pressure that
[1:00:18] they start sweating blood and so Christ
[1:00:21] was doing this why because he was
[1:00:22] bleeding three times his father if it's
[1:00:25] possible let this cup pass from me
[1:00:27] I'm Church we just said it he had joy he
[1:00:30] knew
[1:00:30] the victory that was going to come he
[1:00:33] got it showed him you know the son of
[1:00:35] David ministry and sitting on the right
[1:00:36] hand of God
[1:00:37] he had joy for that but it was hard for
[1:00:40] his flesh to want to go through that you
[1:00:41] and I it's it's hard to miss a meal too
[1:00:44] fast right it's hard to to suffer but
[1:00:49] Jesus was so as flesh was so upset with
[1:00:54] this that he starts sweating blood it's
[1:00:56] from extreme physical or emotional
[1:00:58] stress the Bible said he was looking
[1:01:04] that we must look to Jesus the author
[1:01:05] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:01:07] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:01:09] cross he sprang to East Franken somebody
[1:01:12] else take this and the father of course
[1:01:14] would say no brother man says like the
[1:01:17] Dove came down and had a conference he
[1:01:19] called the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:01:20] conference amen and the dog came down to
[1:01:23] meet with the lamb one more time and
[1:01:24] said you've got to do this and he
[1:01:27] received strength he said why I have
[1:01:28] enough strength to endure it he said
[1:01:31] because the Bible said I've got to
[1:01:32] endure the cross I just got to get
[1:01:35] through it I've got to endure it for
[1:01:37] their sake amen praise God so that's
[1:01:42] where the agony starts about 10:00 p.m.
[1:01:44] and memory keeps going back and he finds
[1:01:47] him sleeping he says you couldn't watch
[1:01:49] with me one hour
[1:01:50] you couldn't pray one hour he says go
[1:01:54] ahead and sleep the rest is coming Judas
[1:01:57] is coming now he's arrested about
[1:02:00] midnight according to this timeline now
[1:02:04] I I don't like staying up late you know
[1:02:06] I don't especially after fellowshipping
[1:02:08] and so Jesus he's had a very small meal
[1:02:11] there for communion and now it's
[1:02:14] midnight and he gets arrested and church
[1:02:20] where he goes next he goes to the house
[1:02:24] of Anna's now anise was the
[1:02:25] father-in-law to Caiaphas the high
[1:02:27] priest
[1:02:28] so anise was the previous high priest
[1:02:31] now what they did church the Jews broke
[1:02:34] all the laws all their laws said they're
[1:02:37] not supposed to have trials at nighttime
[1:02:39] because bad things usually happen at
[1:02:41] night right so in new
[1:02:44] in in in crus and rejecting their
[1:02:46] Messiah
[1:02:47] they broke their own laws right and
[1:02:51] church we should see the same we should
[1:02:52] see the same in our lives if we're doing
[1:02:54] things we know are wrong god help us to
[1:02:56] see that we're doing wrong praise God
[1:02:58] every every warning was there they broke
[1:03:02] this they broke that they broke that
[1:03:04] meeting after meeting after meeting they
[1:03:06] kept breaking all these rules and
[1:03:08] traditions that they had she's arrested
[1:03:12] in his first trial probably takes place
[1:03:14] about 1 a.m. and then he goes to
[1:03:19] Caiaphas now when he was at Caiaphas
[1:03:21] house that's where Peter was out in the
[1:03:23] court and my mom's been there my mom
[1:03:25] sent me pictures there and talked to me
[1:03:26] about that she just went to Israel a
[1:03:28] couple months ago as I told you and she
[1:03:31] said they have a there was a hole in
[1:03:33] Caiaphas's room where they would throw
[1:03:37] prisoners because that's why they could
[1:03:38] have trials there and so this is where I
[1:03:41] remember that Caiaphas rips his robe and
[1:03:44] he one gets him to say that he's the
[1:03:46] Messiah and Caiaphas says it's blasphemy
[1:03:49] well they start slapping and beating
[1:03:51] Jesus write to me let me just read a
[1:03:55] little bit about that so a Caiaphas
[1:03:57] house the Bible says in mark 1416 they
[1:04:02] begin to spit on him and to blindfold
[1:04:04] him and beat him and to say to him
[1:04:08] prophesy and the officer struck him with
[1:04:10] the palms of their hands now this this
[1:04:14] is interesting this doctor who wrote
[1:04:16] this article said when you're
[1:04:18] blindfolded it's even worse to get hit
[1:04:20] on the head and it's worse trauma
[1:04:23] because you can't roll with the punches
[1:04:25] you can't kind of see where they're
[1:04:26] coming from so you have no way to kind
[1:04:28] of brace yourself at all so the trauma
[1:04:30] is way worse when you're blindfolded and
[1:04:36] so Jesus gets beaten and smacked and his
[1:04:39] beard hairs ripped out by the Jews his
[1:04:43] own people his own children we'd say
[1:04:46] mine and so he's beaten and thrown in
[1:04:50] the the hole and Caiaphas's house until
[1:04:54] about 6 a.m. because Pontius Pilate
[1:04:57] would start have
[1:04:59] trials like at 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. so on
[1:05:03] Friday at 7:00 a.m. he comes before
[1:05:05] Pontius Pilate and says oh this is he's
[1:05:09] done nothing wrong he sends him off to
[1:05:10] Herod and Herod mocks him
[1:05:13] I remember we showed us a couple years
[1:05:15] ago Herod actually had more respect for
[1:05:18] John the Baptist than Christ that's what
[1:05:20] a lot of people have today they
[1:05:22] reverence brother Branham more than a
[1:05:23] reverence Jesus Christ we should honor
[1:05:26] all men and the Bible said give double
[1:05:28] honor to those who labor in the Word of
[1:05:30] God like brother random we do but we
[1:05:33] don't give worship and we give our
[1:05:34] greatest love and devotion to Jesus
[1:05:36] Christ because he's the absolute praise
[1:05:38] God amen but Herod respected the
[1:05:42] messenger more than the message praise
[1:05:44] God in church I found the quote this
[1:05:46] week where brother Bram said he said
[1:05:48] that you've got to pay attention the
[1:05:49] message he said if you focus on the
[1:05:51] messenger God will take the messenger
[1:05:53] off the scene so I wonder if that's why
[1:05:55] God took brother Brandon off the way he
[1:05:56] did was to get the people to see it's
[1:05:59] not about a man thank God for the man
[1:06:00] every man has a purpose he prevailed his
[1:06:02] purpose we thank God for that but the
[1:06:04] idea is not to get focus on a man the
[1:06:07] idea is to let Christ increase amen let
[1:06:10] the Word of God increase and we don't
[1:06:11] struggle with that here but you know
[1:06:13] some people do it's a great temptation
[1:06:14] these days so about 7:00 a.m. he comes
[1:06:18] before Pontius Pilate sent him off the
[1:06:20] hare at about 7:30 that's what I was
[1:06:23] looking at my watch a smart like mine
[1:06:24] it's seven o'clock this morning this is
[1:06:26] when Jesus would have been before
[1:06:27] Pontius Pilate I was just trying to
[1:06:29] relate to that what would that feel like
[1:06:31] sleeping in a hole in Caiaphas's
[1:06:34] if he could have slept right being
[1:06:35] beaten and the bruising the facial
[1:06:38] trauma if he even could have slept
[1:06:41] through that in a hole for at least five
[1:06:44] hours maybe more after being beaten and
[1:06:47] have a trial there right in Caiaphas's
[1:06:49] house and of course he remember he saw
[1:06:51] he saw Peter run before that trial
[1:06:54] member he looked out the crew three
[1:06:56] times he ran away and Jesus knew he was
[1:06:59] getting alone so Herod then says I can't
[1:07:06] do anything he sends them off to Pilate
[1:07:07] again about 8 a.m. and this is where
[1:07:11] Pilate for the next hour
[1:07:12] or so he tries to talk to Jesus and
[1:07:14] Jesus stops talking and then Pilate he
[1:07:18] makes he says I'm gonna wash my hands of
[1:07:19] this he keeps hearing the Jews crucify
[1:07:22] him crucify him crucify him he says who
[1:07:25] do you what we have this tradition you
[1:07:26] up gravis and they they say we want were
[1:07:28] BRABUS Jesus's own people crying out for
[1:07:33] his blood one of the saddest pictures
[1:07:37] the Biden brother Graham brings it out
[1:07:38] from the Bible there they crucified him
[1:07:41] the holiest place the holiest people the
[1:07:44] worst death and the most sweetest
[1:07:45] wonderful perfect human being praise God
[1:07:48] what a paradox my but God had to do it
[1:07:52] and so from 8 to 9 he's on triad night
[1:07:56] around 9 o'clock is where he says take
[1:07:58] him and scourge him and crucify him now
[1:08:02] let's go through this the scourging here
[1:08:06] now Jesus was beaten so bad isaiah 52:13
[1:08:10] and 14 he said his visit was so marred
[1:08:13] more than any man from his form more
[1:08:15] than the sons of men now church here's
[1:08:16] what I believe happened Jesus said in
[1:08:19] Luke 22 Jesus said fine he said arrest
[1:08:22] me that's fine he said this is your hour
[1:08:24] and the power of darkness so what I
[1:08:26] believe church no man could ever been
[1:08:28] beaten like Christ so jesus knew this is
[1:08:31] the hour of darkness so I imagine all
[1:08:33] those demons just started filling those
[1:08:35] Roman soldiers with demonic power and
[1:08:38] beating him more and even those Jews
[1:08:40] that were beating him they beat him so
[1:08:42] much where no man had ever looked like
[1:08:44] this that's what the Bible says he was
[1:08:48] beaten and you couldn't even see the
[1:08:51] visit of a man if I was a demon remember
[1:08:54] that said he looked like a worm he said
[1:08:55] I consider myself a worm hardly a man
[1:08:58] because he hardly looked like a man
[1:09:02] jesus said this is your pop this is your
[1:09:05] hour and the power of Darkness and yet
[1:09:09] he stood
[1:09:09] why did she stood there he stood there
[1:09:10] for you and I Church let me say this he
[1:09:13] stood there for his bride he also stood
[1:09:15] there for catholics nothings
[1:09:17] Presbyterians Pentecostals brace God he
[1:09:20] stood there for the bank's of blind and
[1:09:21] Jews as well praise God Amen he stood
[1:09:26] there and he took it for all those that
[1:09:29] would repent of their sins and be honest
[1:09:31] and sincere before God he stood there to
[1:09:33] take it all praise God that he might
[1:09:35] inherit all praise God he would inherit
[1:09:37] all power and every throne in every
[1:09:40] nation and rule them with a rod of iron
[1:09:42] he stood there to do that for our sakes
[1:09:44] praise God thank the Lord so then he's
[1:09:48] flogged by the Roman guards it was that
[1:09:50] they had whips which had leather thongs
[1:09:53] on them were 18 to 24 inches long these
[1:09:56] whips and they were they had bits of
[1:10:02] metal and bone in glass embedded in the
[1:10:05] leather whips and a prisoner was usually
[1:10:08] frogged 39 times 39 times and then they
[1:10:15] said we'll be merciful we won't give you
[1:10:17] a 40 will give you 39 that was their
[1:10:19] form of mercy imagining it and whipped
[1:10:21] 39 times with bones glass and metal
[1:10:25] that's what our Lord went through how
[1:10:28] many love the Lord today praise God
[1:10:30] how many thankful he took that for us 39
[1:10:34] times and I watched that I just watched
[1:10:36] a little bit of the passion just those
[1:10:38] in that section and those men and you
[1:10:40] can see you could picture how they would
[1:10:42] just enjoy that because the power of
[1:10:44] darkness was upon them
[1:10:45] Satan was there too poor brother and
[1:10:47] said is Satan or as brother Mannis said
[1:10:49] as Jesus carrying the cross
[1:10:51] Satan was right there watching him like
[1:10:53] a bee ready to sting him with the sting
[1:10:54] of death so no doubt Satan was there too
[1:10:57] they captured on the movie where Satan's
[1:10:58] right there watch him get beat up 39
[1:11:01] times getting whipped over and over with
[1:11:02] rods and then with this cat of nine
[1:11:04] tails with the the glass and the metal
[1:11:07] and the whips this was the power of
[1:11:10] darkness coming up upon the Lord history
[1:11:15] says they might have even used an iron
[1:11:17] rod to beat the prisoner because there
[1:11:21] so cruel member Turks Romans didn't
[1:11:24] invent the crucifixion they didn't
[1:11:27] invent it they just perfected it the
[1:11:30] spirit of Rome would watch and they
[1:11:32] would one of the videos I watched last
[1:11:34] night said they had this this mile long
[1:11:37] stretch where they put all the crucified
[1:11:38] people so can you imagine they said I
[1:11:41] think was 800 Malakai I think we're
[1:11:43] listening to it last night anyways they
[1:11:45] had you know maybe 400 on this side 400
[1:11:47] on that side unless one stretcher Road
[1:11:49] of course Jesus was at Gao Gotha the
[1:11:51] skull but roll was known for crucifixion
[1:11:54] they perfected it and you know just a
[1:11:57] couple hundred years after that
[1:11:58] Constantine outlawed it in honor of
[1:12:01] Christ he out loud out lava the
[1:12:04] crucifixion but it reached its height
[1:12:07] during Jesus's life in order to fulfill
[1:12:10] the scripture and so from 9:00 to 12:00
[1:12:19] he gets crucified there at 12:00 the
[1:12:24] Bible said darkness goes over the land
[1:12:26] it was midnight in the middle the day I
[1:12:29] love that song brother Donnie Reagan
[1:12:30] church sings at midnight in the middle
[1:12:31] of the day but the band said God and
[1:12:35] everyone or God was forsaking his son
[1:12:38] and the whole earth was having a nervous
[1:12:42] prostration all the earth had to
[1:12:44] recognize that a day just when an
[1:12:46] innocent one was being slain unjustly a
[1:12:50] completely innocent person now I'm
[1:12:54] skipping ahead a little bit here but
[1:12:59] through the
[1:13:00] urging the victims back was usually
[1:13:02] shredded and exposed the underlining
[1:13:04] muscles and the skeletal structures
[1:13:08] remember they're tied up there and
[1:13:10] they're just beaten mercilessly there's
[1:13:12] a group of five men five soldiers one
[1:13:14] one was like the leader watched over the
[1:13:16] other four just took turns slicing and
[1:13:20] crushing our Lord like a rose right like
[1:13:23] we seen that song like a rose he was
[1:13:25] crushed for us severe blood loss and
[1:13:30] dehydration were happening to the Lord
[1:13:32] his bones were staring at him after the
[1:13:37] scourging the Bible said the soldiers
[1:13:39] beat him again a second time with their
[1:13:41] hands and with a read as if it wasn't
[1:13:43] enough and then they put on him the
[1:13:47] crown of thorns of course Christ had not
[1:13:50] eaten anything since the night before
[1:13:52] now it's around 9:00 9:00 to 12:00 here
[1:13:54] this three-hour process of scourging and
[1:13:57] then having him carries on cross to Gaul
[1:14:00] Gotha so now he's getting this severe
[1:14:05] dehydration and cardio respiratory
[1:14:07] failure this was all to fulfill Isaiah
[1:14:10] fifty verse six I gave my back to the
[1:14:13] spiders and my cheeks to them that
[1:14:14] plucked off the hair I hidden out my
[1:14:17] face from the shame and the spitting oh
[1:14:20] if he put up with this we can put up
[1:14:22] with our little trials can't wait that's
[1:14:24] what I love I love this time every year
[1:14:25] we get to be reminded look at what he
[1:14:27] suffered I can go through my little my
[1:14:29] light afflictions as Paul says these are
[1:14:31] just such light afflictions such light
[1:14:33] burdens he gave his back his cheeks his
[1:14:37] face he gave it for you and I praise God
[1:14:42] and the crucifixion the Persian started
[1:14:46] it around 300 BC perfected by the Romans
[1:14:49] as we said the cross Eddy
[1:14:55] was probably 75 to 125 pounds as he
[1:14:58] carried it down the way of suffering I
[1:15:01] forget the actual word for it the I
[1:15:03] can't remember it there's a certain
[1:15:05] pathway where they walk where the
[1:15:08] Crucified would walk yeah that's right
[1:15:11] and the victims of crucifixion were
[1:15:14] typically stripped naked and their
[1:15:16] clothes divided by the Roman guards that
[1:15:18] was done to fulfill Psalms 20 to 18 they
[1:15:20] divided my garments among them and for
[1:15:22] my clothing they cast lots totally naked
[1:15:26] and crucified they offered Jesus a
[1:15:31] mixture right on the cross but he turned
[1:15:33] it down why because he had to bear all
[1:15:36] of our suffering praise God he could
[1:15:39] take no wait out there in other words
[1:15:40] there was no shortcut let me say like
[1:15:42] this search our lives there'll be no
[1:15:44] shortcuts of suffering in order to have
[1:15:46] christ-like character praise God we all
[1:15:48] want to skip him right we all want to
[1:15:50] skip the the hard times and we don't
[1:15:52] want it we just want everything to
[1:15:53] happen now but that's not the way God
[1:15:54] works many times God takes us through
[1:15:56] long years of suffering in order to
[1:15:58] produce real godly character praise God
[1:16:01] amen he didn't take any of that vinegar
[1:16:04] and gall there said I must bear it all
[1:16:09] he didn't take any relief for our sins
[1:16:13] the Bible said in first Peter 2:24 who
[1:16:16] his own self bore our sins in his own
[1:16:19] body on the tree that we being dead to
[1:16:21] sins should live unto righteousness by
[1:16:24] whose stripes you were healed a man
[1:16:26] beautiful praise God
[1:16:28] because he suffered we should live so
[1:16:31] holy because of his suffering that he
[1:16:33] experienced we should be dead to sins
[1:16:36] because he died for us praise God and
[1:16:39] after that the victim was placed on his
[1:16:42] back with his arm stretched out and
[1:16:43] nailed to the cross bar these nails were
[1:16:47] about seven to nine inches long and
[1:16:48] they're placed between the bones of the
[1:16:50] forearm they're the radius and the ulna
[1:16:52] and the small bones of the hand this
[1:16:57] would keep the
[1:16:58] person on the cross and it would also
[1:17:00] sever the largest nerve called the
[1:17:02] median nerve and this severing this
[1:17:06] nerve is a medical catastrophe
[1:17:09] it brought burning pain destroyed the
[1:17:13] nerve and permanent paralysis of the
[1:17:16] hands so after the nails went through
[1:17:19] there he never moved his hands ever
[1:17:20] again until he got raised from the dead
[1:17:22] / he's God and then he showed you they
[1:17:24] showed Thomas these are my hands praise
[1:17:26] God hallelujah thank the Lord all the
[1:17:33] scripture were fulfilled and it was
[1:17:35] perfectly placed up the nails were
[1:17:38] perfectly placed so no bone was broken
[1:17:43] then his feet were nailed to the cross
[1:17:46] now this is an interesting thought but
[1:17:48] his feet were at a 45 degree angle kinda
[1:17:51] that's the 90s that's 45 it's usually
[1:17:53] that's usually not that way on the
[1:17:54] movies usually it's just feet her
[1:17:55] straight down but his feet were proud or
[1:17:58] legs were probably at a 45 degree angle
[1:18:01] and as you know he'd have to bear all of
[1:18:06] his weight with his thighs and then any
[1:18:09] of us let's you know who may be after
[1:18:11] church at your own house who would like
[1:18:13] to try to sit like this who likes to sit
[1:18:15] like this for like even one minute we
[1:18:17] had to do that in track when we were
[1:18:19] younger that's paint that's awful oh
[1:18:20] yeah Christ had a worse angle than that
[1:18:23] because at least we had a 90-degree
[1:18:24] angle he's at a 45 and the Roman way to
[1:18:30] do it was to put a little a small wooden
[1:18:35] seat by their feet so they could have
[1:18:37] something to sit on and this would
[1:18:38] excuse them a little bit of relief and
[1:18:41] allow them to live up to nine days so if
[1:18:44] they put that little piece of wood is
[1:18:46] like a little triangle piece of wood
[1:18:47] that their feet could rest on if they
[1:18:49] could put that feet under there they or
[1:18:51] that piece of there they live up to nine
[1:18:53] days but of course Jesus wasn't gonna
[1:18:55] last that long because he took the most
[1:18:57] awful beating that they'd ever could
[1:18:59] give yeah history said people live for
[1:19:04] five six seven eight nine days crucified
[1:19:07] hanging on the cross animals would get
[1:19:09] him it was just awful way to die
[1:19:18] in church you know once the once he was
[1:19:20] hanging up there his shoulders would
[1:19:22] come out of socket and the doctors say
[1:19:26] that the arms would then be six to nine
[1:19:29] inches longer than normal the wingspan
[1:19:30] would go out they can't feel his hands
[1:19:33] anymore and then out of the sockets
[1:19:37] that's why they had to have not just
[1:19:39] nails but they had ropes around him as
[1:19:41] well too because the arms get longer
[1:19:44] all right goodness
[1:19:46] pretty soon and as you know it's
[1:19:50] constant up and down constant up and
[1:19:52] down the heart is beating faster because
[1:19:55] it needs more oxygen and so the body's
[1:19:57] working harder but can never get enough
[1:19:59] oxygen
[1:19:59] pretty soon the heart begins to fail the
[1:20:02] lungs collapse and they fill up with
[1:20:04] fluid which is course why Jesus said I
[1:20:07] thirst
[1:20:08] this combination of all these things
[1:20:11] caused the death of the victim they
[1:20:15] suffocate to death
[1:20:16] oh it's also called severe cardiac
[1:20:20] stress and in this crucifixion a victims
[1:20:25] heart can even burst the muscles wood
[1:20:27] and tissues were just burst that's why
[1:20:32] it's called a cardiac rupture that's why
[1:20:34] many people say Jesus died of a broken
[1:20:36] heart
[1:20:37] it's very possible of course we know
[1:20:39] that Jesus gave up the ghost right he
[1:20:43] had to release his own spirit he knew
[1:20:44] the time and he to the right moment when
[1:20:46] to do it but it's very possible that his
[1:20:49] heart just burst
[1:20:55] now when the Romans wanted to speed it
[1:20:57] up you know they would break the legs of
[1:20:59] the victim right but in this case they
[1:21:00] come to Jesus and he's already dead at 3
[1:21:02] o'clock because before they came he said
[1:21:05] it is finished he gave up the ghost the
[1:21:08] other victims there they had had their
[1:21:11] legs broken in order to die for the
[1:21:13] Passover so all this from 6 p.m. now to
[1:21:18] 3 p.m. the next day the most awful hours
[1:21:21] anyone could experience and he did it
[1:21:25] search for you and I for the joy that
[1:21:26] was set before him praise God this is
[1:21:29] the passion this is the suffering of the
[1:21:32] Lord Jesus Christ now I know you're
[1:21:37] probably familiar with that but I just
[1:21:37] want to go through that I thought that
[1:21:38] was just a beautiful detailed list of
[1:21:42] what our Lord went through what we're
[1:21:46] willing tomorrow we'll look at all the
[1:21:49] tomorrow I want to go through all the
[1:21:51] offerings that he fulfilled the waters
[1:21:53] of separation the five offerings the
[1:21:55] feasts Jesus fulfilled all those in one
[1:21:58] act and on those short minutes there
[1:22:00] they'll show ours he fulfilled all the
[1:22:02] scriptures by himself praise God go to
[1:22:06] Isaiah 53 let's uh let's look at Isaiah
[1:22:09] 53 then we'll get ready to finish up now
[1:22:17] I want to go over these it's been a
[1:22:18] couple it's been a year or two since I
[1:22:20] went over the numerology but I want to
[1:22:22] go back over the biblical numerology of
[1:22:24] Isaiah 53 just briefly so I'm just kind
[1:22:29] of brought that back to my memory Isaiah
[1:22:32] 53 such a beautiful chapter there are
[1:22:35] four metaphors in Isaiah 53 he has a
[1:22:39] tender plant in verse two he's as a root

[1:28:41] we get to communion Philippians chapter
[1:28:43] 2 how did he endure we talked about the
[1:28:48] joy but here's another simple thing how
[1:28:51] did he do it how did he go through the
[1:28:54] passion how did he go through the
[1:28:55] suffering Philippians 2 verse 5 this is
[1:29:07] the same thing job experienced in his
[1:29:09] trial Abraham Peter all trials are to
[1:29:15] bring about this attribute flip ian's
[1:29:17] 2:5 let this mind be in you which was
[1:29:19] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[1:29:21] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[1:29:23] equal with God
[1:29:24] I like this verse 7 but made himself of
[1:29:28] no reputation and took upon him the form
[1:29:31] of a servant and was made in likeness of
[1:29:35] men here it is verse 8 and being found
[1:29:38] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[1:29:41] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:29:46] death of the cross how did he endure
[1:29:49] such suffering the nails the slaps the
[1:29:55] beating how do you endure through
[1:29:57] humility humility in the
[1:30:01] Greek is assigning a lower rank to be
[1:30:05] ranked below others who are honored and
[1:30:08] rewarded to humble yourself by humble
[1:30:13] living to depress yourself to have a
[1:30:18] modest opinion of oneself how is he able
[1:30:22] to endure all the physical pain and
[1:30:24] suffering the beatings whippings a
[1:30:27] casting in the in the pit he was able to
[1:30:30] her by humbling himself putting us above
[1:30:32] him
[1:30:33] I wondered tonight can we put others
[1:30:36] above ourselves heading into this Easter
[1:30:39] weekend who can we put above ourselves
[1:30:41] you know who Jesus wants us do at most
[1:30:42] our families and friends in our church
[1:30:45] remember the Bible said when you have an
[1:30:46] opportunity to do good do good
[1:30:48] especially to those of the household of
[1:30:50] faith let's stand to our feet praise God
[1:30:54] how did he do it the attribute of
[1:30:57] humbling himself how can we become more
[1:31:02] like Christ humbling ourselves placing
[1:31:06] other people above ourselves the holy
[1:31:11] one the high holy one became lower than
[1:31:16] you and I in order to save us in order
[1:31:19] to redeem us praise the Lord thank you
[1:31:23] Jesus now as we prepare for communion
[1:31:27] here let's take our Bibles here tonight
[1:31:29] let's go to first Corinthians 11 doesn't
[1:31:41] that just make
[1:31:42] grateful for all that Christ has done
[1:31:45] such a reminder that was his passion
[1:31:48] that was his suffering he kept telling
[1:31:51] them about it the prophets wrote about
[1:31:53] it for 4000 years they wrote about all
[1:31:55] these things and he endured all of it
[1:31:57] for you and I by humility he humbled
[1:32:02] himself
[1:32:03] may we see like jobs he said I repent
[1:32:06] when job got to the NDS and I repent in
[1:32:07] dust and ashes I abhor myself every
[1:32:12] example of a believer going through a
[1:32:13] trial is to keep us humble is to help us
[1:32:16] to try to find can we look to somebody
[1:32:18] else can we serve somebody else can we
[1:32:20] help somebody else instead of ourselves
[1:32:23] 1st Corinthians 11 why don't we just
[1:32:34] have her
