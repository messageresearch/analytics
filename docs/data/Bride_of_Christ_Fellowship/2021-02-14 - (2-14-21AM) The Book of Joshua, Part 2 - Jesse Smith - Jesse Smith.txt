ourselves ready for thy coming lord god make us ready today i pray in jesus christ's name amen joshua chapter 1 series on the grace of the lord trust your encourage this week of the lord hope you had a good week my god's grace i'm so faithful god is so good i don't really you know we don't really celebrate valentine's day ourselves but any day you want to show somebody some love that's a good day love everybody here and love you with the love of jesus holy love right selfless love may god help us to serve each other praise god that's real love if we can serve one another here today and every day praise god so uh lord willing we'll go to uh joshua chapter one i just want to read that first verse and then we'll read the memory verse that my wife had for this month james chapter seven but i started joshua i'm just drawing a lot of strength from joshua i see uh of course the types we looked at last week we'll review them quickly again today but you see the types and i hope you see yourself as a joshua type of person praise god if you don't open by the end of the service you will because he was a warrior and uh today we're gonna look at lord willing unless the holy spirit would somehow direct me otherwise we're gonna look at his life before joshua chapter one so what does his life talk about what do we learn about him in exodus you know that's exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy what do we learn about this man in these previous books leading up to what we read in the book of joshua so i like to look at his life here leading up to the time that he took the promised land joshua 1 verse 1 not so hard to just you know decide which ones to read let's read that together one two three now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of none moses's minister saying now you know now let's go to james chapter five we'll get to it by god's space 5 7-8 for god righteous upon the tables of our hearts here as we read it let's read it on three one two three be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husband and waited for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your hearts with the coming of the lord amen god bless you may god has blessings look at part two here today by god's grace there's a couple of current events i'd like to share with you eventually i'm just trusting the holy spirit to help me the wind to say it it's got a few things i'm not sure how much you paid attention to for some weeks i pay better attention than others to the news cycle but a couple of things i want to just bring to your attention this week more in the spiritual realm not really politics but more in the spiritual realm just a few things that were really uh shocking this week or uh showing the conditions of the age okay so let's uh that's a picture again of uh the river jordan would have been overflowing like that really heavy waters when joshua took the land uh the holy spirit helped him divide the waters just like it did moses amen as i was with moses he was with joshua as well i hope i can say it like this as god was with brother branham i trust god is with us as well amen thank god i know his word is with us we know his powers with us praise god and i think it's a beautiful type we'll get to this maybe at the end but it's a beautiful type the bible ends the book of deuteronomy by saying moses was a great man and no one was going to reach his status so in other words however great joshua was he was never going to quite reach the attainment of moses would that sound familiar brother brahm had such an anointing he was a star in the hand of god and the bride will never quite reach his level of faith but the thing is we'll still have great escapades of faith praise god amen we'll set up great testimonies to share about the power of god but will never quite reach his revelation or his gifts or his power and so i find a lot of i find a lot of consolation in that fact we'll get to it eventually in deuteronomy 34 where god had to tell joshua he said he said you're next he said but but moses my servant there's none like him amen let me say this there's been no preacher in our day like brother branham amen amen but by god's grace we have the same holy spirit with us and god still meets our needs he helps us he strengthens us and we're grateful for the living god among us amen thank god so let's look at part two here today uh by god's grace this is part three now this is part two i just got the wrong date on there that was yeah that was from wednesday i changed my i changed my what i was gonna preach i was gonna save it for this thing so i just want to just say this too i feel like our recent services were divine appointments we've had brian and then we had shang and different ones come and i just felt like they were divine appointments because in both cases i got to talk to each one individually about the word of the lord i don't know about you but i live for those moments well maybe i hope i understand what i'm talking about i live for the moments when i can look somebody in the eye and tell them thus saith the lord from the word of god so with uh with our brother brian or not brother yet our friend brian were able to give him i was able to speak to him exactly thus saith the word of god you need to repent and get right and all these things he said i'm not ready yet i said but i gave my card and said you called me when you're ready i'm still waiting for that call i don't know if it'll come but those are the moment church that we live for last week when shane was here who invited him to church god bless you sister isn't that awesome that you know just isn't it a joy to invite somebody to church i think it's just such a joy to do that don't you and it's such a greater joy when they come right because we invite people and say oh we like got a home church you know but it's very rare that they come nowadays and that's all right but i got to address him after the service after people were filing out i got to address him and tell him i got to tell him thus saith the lord denominations are going to take the mark of the beast and i said thus saith the lord i said you better pray your church leave that denomination or you better get out of that church the church i don't know about you but to me those are the most valuable moments in life where i get to take thus saint the lord from brother branham and i get to share with an individual and you should i don't know if you saw but you should have seen him hug me last sunday i felt like man i don't get too many hugs like this uh and i don't know you know since then what's i don't know i know some things have been said bang was telling me some things were said but uh those are divine appointments because you you know we don't get too many visitors here most churches don't anymore right most people are hiding out because of chronovirus and most people get set in their ways but i just want to tell you i thought it was such a divine appointment and the bible said the spirit and the bride say come that's all we can say has come right but the father told us he said all that the father gives to jesus will come amen we don't know who's going to come but i've got great consolation in my heart now all i've got to do is say come all i got to do is invite them i gave out to my books to one of the workers at our house this week so i'm really happy to be able to witness to him and try to share what god has done and uh so we're just thankful for god's grace and we just want to we want to recognize those divine appointments i did i have a failure in this week yeah i have one although i make a mistake god's not going to leave me amen right because how many mistakes did moses make well we could start counting right here right all these mistakes he made but did god ever leave that man go sir is god going to leave you no sir amen right he said as i was with moses so will i be with you and i said we'll get to eventually one of these sermons we're going to get to if you listen listen to it if you haven't lately from september 11th 1960 as i was with moses brother adam he goes in there and he explains in the message how he has failed god for for sorry for 12 years with his gift of discernment for 12 years he failed god but yet he said i'm ready to leave this desert i'm ready to go forth and take the land and the reason i'll just share with you a little bit before you go to set the reason he failed because because he would he would bring up the patients and let each one of them get a discernment rather than just for praying for all the people slowly he would just stand there he'd wait there until the gift operated and brother branham said how cruel that was when people out in the audience needed brother graham to pray for them as well he said he would pray for six or eight he would lose all of his energy and then he couldn't pray for the rest of him brother graham said that was so he said how cruel look it up if you got the app look up how cool program says i failed god he said but i'm ready to go forward so he said no matter how many come through he said i'll just pray for them briefly he said there'll still be some discernments but i'm not going to let them just stand there and pull the sermons out while everybody else doesn't get prayed for he was going to make sure he prayed for all the people amen now talk about that talk about admitting talking about being humble to admit that you failed god with your gift the church of god never left them after that if god so honored many of his prayers what about you and i god is still with us amen hallelujah this is that whatever you haven't done this week we've done it lately as i was with moses i was just i listened to it again this week over and over well what a great message that is wouldn't encourage me to know that though we fail though we make mistakes god will never leave us he'll never forsake us praise god amen now so let's briefly review these four applications i promise i'll go briefly here unless the holy spirit does something the first one is you and i crossing joy represents our new birth our third work of grace being born again for every individual that's why i was saying we should have some part of us that feels like wow i feel like joshua i feel like god has just parted everything out of my life and i'm able to go into the baptism of the holy ghost god has done this god has stood up every obstacle praise god god has made every obstacle stand up so i can possess my inheritance amen so we should have this this idea this feeling like wow we're like joshua's generation we're going into the land praise god and we're the ones possessing the land amen now the second and now oh yeah i want to add this in here too we read this last week but i kind of went over it quickly hebrews 4 8 says for jesus had given them rest then he would not afterward have spoken of another day in other words if joshua really gave israel rest then why did david speak of another rest right because david was about 500 years after after joshua if if finally god was going to give them rest through joshua and they're in the land and there they have a sabbath every saturday they don't work every saturday if that was the rest then why would david 500 years promise another rest amen he said there remained therefore a rest to the people of god so the other day was david speaking of rest that came as a result of jesus's resurrection amen because 500 years the holy spirit anointed david to say that therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices my flesh shall also rest in hope david david was born in the promised land amen he died in the promised land he lived every day of his life almost i don't know he spent most of his life in the promised land but he said i still know there's another rest amen he said my for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption now you bible readers know acts chapter 2 peter quotes this and he's talking about jesus for david's feet concerning jesus right i foresaw the lord always before my face for he's on my right hand that i should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope he said but because i will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption amen amen so the hebrew writer recognizes that david was looking for rest 500 years after joshua supposedly gave them wrath amen so the rest he was talking about was the rest in your soul the rest from trying to earn salvation and working at yourself and the rest in knowing that god has given you salvation and god by the holy ghost in you is working in you amen amen it is not i that liveth but christ that liveth in me amen amen oh that's glorious there's another one too he says david says it on multiple occasions it said oh that i had wings like a dove for then i would fly away and be at rest why would david need to fly away and be at rest if the saturday sabbath was the rest or if living in canaan was the rest why would he seek to desire rest because there was a greater rest amen go low then when i wander off and remain in the wilderness sea loud so we know that david was speaking of another rest there's something greater that he was pressing toward amen it was greater than possessing a certain property it was greater uh than just passing through jordan it was greater than not working on saturday or sunday praise god it was the it was the blessing of never working again amen being at rest in god's promises amen amen in your soul praise god the second application was brother adam was entering his third poll because we know he was already born again the third application was brother adam was like joshua and we are like caleb seems like the third whole type i mentioned that last week with recent healing in the church healings rather like a third poll type of ministry moving into the spoken word praise god now i want to now here's where i'll do some more i will do some fresh quotes on this the fourth application was brother brandon was like moses and the holy ghost today is like i joshua i got these a little bit out of order here so forgive me let's redo this again you remember this uh the spiritual joshua takes what moses the prophet said acts on it joshua didn't sit around and quote moses all day and said he had his own relationship with god and fought as a warrior possessing the land through god's power amen now this is uh here's some new quotes now here's a new uh a new application well i should say it's a similar application that i preached last week i was listening to this message about three times this week the great warrior joshua now look at this type this is a beautiful type moses a type of the church organization who brought the law and so forth failed now why did he fail glorifying himself in the stead of god now look at this type what a beautiful type oh my it's so powerful did you ever see that jose brother said moses was like the church or the nominations of his day they they were they were powerful for a while but they ended up glorifying themselves so god had to raise up with joshua brother branham amen hallelujah praise god is that right he says he said so is the church today trying to see who can build the biggest church that's why we're not interested in anything in the natural churches praise god right we don't get interested in that that's a church or that's a man trying to glorify themselves who can get the best dressed select or crowd who can get the mayor of the city and all the celebrity in the church that's what the program is today as the baptist said a million more and 44. i don't care a million more of what that's it right there yeah when you get a bigger church what are you getting are you getting more uh denominational people are getting more people filled with the holy ghost we want souls that are born again amen except they're born again they'll stay on fire they might have a few a few hard seasons but they'll stay on fire because they're constantly guiding some more truth amen oh i'm tired of seeing people in and out and sometimes on fire sometimes not he want everybody on fire praise god amen hallelujah i've been on fire for all these years my goodness that's what we expect everybody if they say they're born again then stay on fire amen amen prove it by your life stay dedicated with god chop out every sin out of your life and say pure before god almighty amen amen i know there's a time too i was telling this is my wife sometimes i feel like the bible says hezekiah the bible said god left hezekiah for a season to test him so sometimes the anointing may not seem as as as strong on you how many can ever how many could say man that kind of relate to that there are some seasons where may the anointing you might do the same thing you might pray and read your bible as much or more but it doesn't seem like that anointing comes faster that's okay god's just pulling off his anointing to test you because he's got to do that to everybody he's got to test them to see uh if if they lose that feeling a little bit of that feeling they still stay devoted to me and it's a good thing god does that too because then you may just you just be addicted to feelings rather than the word damn i didn't hear you right god left him for a season god left hezekiah for a season and remember church he failed that one he failed right after god healed him of his death near death disease instead of getting stronger he got more loose hezekiah got more loose and he invited those ambassadors from bound lines you can look at all god's stretchers you can look at all these things but what the bible say don't cast your pearls before slime he got too loose with the treasures of god and we know what happened uh he just had an awful end to his life hezekiah so i just want to encourage you just stay stay devoted to god you're gonna learn that from joshua today just stay devoted let me say this stay on your knees stay in the word stay in church stay praising god keep god at the forefront of your life and god will reward you but it'll really prove if you're born again or not amen that's what it's for because that's what we see in our day many say they are he said you might have more see that's what it doesn't matter how many people are in the church our church or any church it doesn't matter how many are there it matters how many of them are born again oh that's encouraging amen i'd rather have one one filled with the holy ghost one of god's power than a thousand well we'll see what this time brother adam can represent joshua like he said in the pick up your pen and right experience denominations could not take the church into the promised land the baptism of the holy ghost that's proof because i can look at my my family i can look at the church i was raised in they never took us in the promised land it took god calling us out of the denomination so simon could get born again cam can get born again i could get born again betsy could get bored again god had to call us out of that denomination because the denomination is no longer the mouthpiece of god but we're blessed because god is speaking to us the spirit and the bride saying come amen hallelujah you won't find the the denominations as the mouthpiece of god but you'll find it here if we're obedient to the word of the lord amen i just didn't expect all this boldness here so bear with me here i didn't expect this it's not how many we can get to the church it's how many we can get in christ to believe and submit themselves find their position and stand like the rock of ages at their post of duty and ready ready for what the rapture praise god amen and ready for any gift any supernatural move just be ready there so god can use you well i hope god just settles everybody in here tonight and just you or let you know what to do the great crisis we're at cadence barney look at this he said we're at katy's barnett in 1955 the churches couldn't go over in the holy ghost so god had to send a prophet to take him over amen that old now that old ministry was effective right it was effective and it's day brother said god used to use seminaries in church i tell you if you haven't studied church history study it i forget was it martin no it was iranians iranians built schools and seminaries and he taught all these men and one of those men that came out was martin his nephew and martin cast out devils heal the sick and iron and that man was a mighty man of god amen so schools can be good for a while but then they became places of stagnation when they denominated they got the man's idea they became the bible said tables full of vomit and god had to move out of there praise god but for a while god used them but then god draw the people out of there because it was a dead system praise god now he says we're at cadence barnea and he says there's now this is skipping ahead now in five years later there's a lot of great types in here but we'll bypass some of them for instance moses was the church age that brought them to sinai to their theology of last night and for some reason they don't have they don't have september 10th message so they just have september 11th i went and looked so they must have lost that recording so now i don't know how that happened he said moses was not permitted to take the children of israel over the promised land because he had failed so this would mean that philadelphian age was the anti-type of moses which it was a great open door was it not that was the age of the open door where missionaries like william carey went to india and won millions of souls david livingston went uh all through africa preaching the gospel they just had all these open doors amen jesus said i've opened the door for you philadelphia brotherly love ah brotherly love drove them to the to be missionaries brotherly love will drive us to witness to our friends and our neighbors amen oh brother we'll do it praise god so philadelphia brotherhood typed moses but then god in the next age god had to send a messenger a prophet to take them in to the promised land amen oh thank the lord and the church organization's denomination has failed they'll not take the church over god will raise up a new system an inner denominational system by the power of god that'll take the church into the promised land organizations the denomination that's messing up each one after their own theology each one after their own way of thinking but god will take his holy spirit and will raise his joshua that will take the church to the promise with no denominational strings tied anywhere but will take his church over moses had failed he was the lawgiver joshua was called of grace and he took the church on praise god isn't that beautiful i just love that now here before i go on here let me this maybe this would be an appropriate time let me go through some news here real quick this week was just a a stirring week of a couple of events now i'm not going to say the man's name because you can see it on the screen but this man uh passed away last summer in the uh summer may 2020. i'm pretty sure if you ever heard of this preacher he was an apologist which means he was he would argue and uh so he would argue christian arguments about uh you know major questions like why do people suffer and everything like this i don't know if you saw it this week but this week or last week uh after the man passed away uh then his ministry investigated all his cell phones that he had and uh and they interviewed all the people around him and this man this ministry to this man who he was just an intellectual man right no miracles in his ministry just intellectual trying to argue and reason christianity from a human logical standpoint now well i'm missing a few of them and a few of them i thought that's pretty good and a few of them i'm not like i said i don't even know what this guy is saying and so intellectual i can't even understand what he's saying what came out this week after the investigations that went through that this man had so many uh immoral sexual relationships around the world 24 million dollars pouring in a year into his ministry when he died people called him uh like a next billy graham but this week it's coming out that that all this money corrupted his life he would uh he he owned massage uh what do they call massage spouse he owned numerous of them that's where he would go to do evil acts i'm just going to kind of leave it like that and everybody looked at him as this mighty intellectual person he was so snarted and so many people accredited him with you know helping them understand life's questions that may be true but as they've examined his life he chose to live in iniquity can i say like this his life looks like a judas iscariot life i'm not saying it was but it looks like it because years and years of records and phone calls and texts with numerous women and numero all around the world he would go to thailand and different places and go there to write a book but yet engage in all kinds of immorality church i'm thankful for one thing i'm thankful for the power of the holy spirit praise god amen amen the power that will drive a man to crucify the lust of the flesh and the affections thereof amen see if you just have an intellectual faith that's why these people are far away from the message because they never got genuine faith in their soul and if they did they never let it grow right and we've gotta let these uh we gotta let the word of god grow in our lives to the holiness pushes out all the worldliness praise god amen and the fruits of the spirit are contrary to the things of the flesh so we see that these preachers live many will live lives of luxuriousness with millions of dollars i said god keep me from that keep me humble praise god keep me living a life of integrity praise god so this came out this week he was married the whole time but yet had all he had two daughters and all these things but he had all these other women on all i think he had like eight cell phones now over the years so he can keep his his lives straight now church that to me looks like a worker iniquity now i don't know i don't know what jesus will say but it looks like he might say something like this you might have done great things supposedly but did i ever know you that's the question could someone really know jesus can jesus really know them if they're doing the will of flesh instead of the will of god amen supposedly help so many people but then hurt so many in the process so see this is an example of how the holy spirit i love bill branson's example praise god they would offer him millions and he turned it down i heard it on tape it's actually on that tape uh it's that as i was with moses brother rams said the latter rain movement that moved up to canada and now it had millions of dollars for years they came to brother graham and he said they tried they said that he said they said let's build a memorial for you and let's start a denomination and brother said i'm not looking for a memorial i'm looking for the coming of the lord amen and that move went up into evil things like abuse as well and all kinds of false prophecies look at that look at a man he's offered that these men try to offer we'll make a denomination just for your name we'll make it you know we'll make it right after you but god will give him the power of the holy spirit to turn that down and say i'm not looking for that i'm looking for jesus christ amen today praise god that we won't sell out for anything we'll just keep the humble simple gospel message we'll preach it and we'll live it praise god amazing now the second one i'll get to here i don't know if you saw it i used to be big into sports that's why i'm sharing this one i don't watch any sporting event i haven't watched a sporting event well other than my brother's football games live my brother's one brother my brother-in-law that was back in 2006 i think on tv i haven't watched the game since uh 2002 the national championship when ohio state beat florida that was the last game i watched i felt condemned the whole time because i already knew the message at that point but all these people that can watch the games and think they're right with god i think they're bachelor that's my opinion anyways i don't know did you see this week they interviewed the quarterback that won the super bowl before he won the super bowl so i'm gonna try not to use that and they asked him how do you keep doing this and he said i've married a witch but she's a good witch did you see the pepperoni and i think about all the people the message i know numerous people the message in churches that watch the super bowl and it's already been proven every performer at halftime is a satanist it's already been proven i can show to you if you want i'll send you a link every one of those musicians from michael jackson all beyonce bruno mars and this one was some person called the weeknd they're all satanists you can prove it they say it their lyrics they say in their personal life all of them even katy perry they've all come out and said i've sold my soul to the devil see they're marked oh they got the mark of the beast but we got to seal the holy ghost praise god amen and yet churches that say we got the seal they go to that for pleasure now let me tell you they're facts they're not born again they'll go watch satan's now not just the musician well i don't watch the halftime show well now the winning quarterback is married to which and they he said where my wife's involved in witchcraft uh we didn't say which guy he said but my wife gives me these stones for healing and she has me set up an altar at my locker every time before the game and and uh says all these mantras before the games i just kind of want to shock you a little bit and i want to encourage you that we are in the right over here praise god we are in the right we're in the holy ghost shutting these things let us not be let's not compare ourselves to message churches let's be like the early church praise god that shunned evil and shunned all these things and lived separated unto god like he said separate me paul barnabas for the work that i've called them to do praise god amen that about blew my eyes out of my sockets this week nice to like that guy i used to like that team i used to be my team before he was there i used to like drew bleds i don't know if some of you know that but that used to be my favorite guy when i was in high school well then this new guy come and he married a witch and he admits it i can share the link if you want it was interesting too because they were trying to they were speculating these preachers were trying to speculate is that why all those guys got hurt on the other team because they put curses on them and that's how they won the game i don't know but one thing we know is that demons are behind them demons are taking more control demons are gathering their groups together politically athletically financially the demons are gathering the tares together but christ is bringing forth the wheat into his garner hallelujah he's matured thank god those are the two things i thought i'd share with you that with this movie striking to me this week i'm glad what i'm saying is i'm glad god called me out because i would have been all into that that was my bread and butter in life you know so i'm very thankful for god's grace blessings you know i used to like intellectual preaching a little bit you know before the message came to me so i can see how i can see church how god is protecting me from all these things i i uh i can tell how he's hiding me under the shadow of his wings hallelujah he said how often he would have gathered you and hovered you onto yourself see that's what they rejected it but we've received it we're gathered under jehovah's mighty wings and we're resting under the old and new testament praise god amen thank god all right let's look at joshua for a few minutes here verse one now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of none moses is minister saying so minister is a servant so this really struck out to me brother adam calls uh joshua the great warrior and he was amen but before he was a warrior he was a servant before you'll be a mighty prayer warrior before you'll be a a warrior in the prayer lines or whatever god's called you to be before that you and i have got to be servants first i just read it this week where jesus said i didn't come to be served i came to serve and to give my life as a ransom for many amen and he said the greatest among you will be the servants amen amen those that are serving other people those that want to help other people and just be a blessing to other people the servants are the greatest among us so god help us to be servants praise god it's a beautiful picture and i again i'm going to say this about brother abraham that they criticized brother they criticized brother graham he can't remember all the things about the seven major visions and maybe i'll preach this on wednesday i've been going through the seven major revisions it's my next youtube video they criticized brother you know he changed this and said this about the seven major visions and church i think i've said this before brother branham was not a pampered scholar a pampered uh computer technician like so many men are today program didn't have the luxury to sit behind a desk all day like people today and just click click click and that's their job he was out there praying for the city he was making sick calls he was out there resting and praying all day so he could preach to the congregations he was a man that was laboring he poured every ounce of his heart and soul to pray for the sick and these people criticized him for not being able to remember some details about things that took place 20 30 years ago yeah may god have mercy on these people he lived most of his life in visions let me ask you this what what's the oh what's the first dream you remember or what's the second dream you remember anybody tell me all right sorry i shouldn't say that out loud why don't you tell me out loud but do you think i'll just say like this rhetorical question do you think you can tell me more details about the dreams you had 20 30 years ago or less probably less right and they'll criticize brother well he said this about fdr and then he said this about stalin and he said this and it wasn't exactly the same and these men know nothing about prophecy they never said they never even prayed for a sick person brother johnny they never even seen a miracle in their lives really they never even really spoke with thus the lord many of them have never even preached one sermon or got behind the anointing or or who knows they've never hold week long services and revivals like he studied and fasted and prayed for eight days in a row for the seven seals they've never done that and they're criticizing god's spirit i i say let's encourage god's servants amen what are they they're just spirits of criticism they're critical spirits praise god you think in those old honky tonk kentucky hills can i it's a honky tonk okay and those are maybe it's not a good word to say you think in those old kentucky hills they had scholars that were waiting in 1933 when brother around they had scholars waiting they're all educated brother man was a seventh grade educated man do you think he had scholars waiting there to record they didn't have recorders they could afford that and he's trying his best to remember by the holy spirit the bill graham said you think you sweat it out he said i swear it out way more than you swear to that god makes them wait for thus saith the lord god makes them wait for this [Music] i'm standing with joshua praise god amen i'm saying with joshua hallelujah a minister a servant now who knows the first mention of joshua they just left egypt and they're out in the wilderness and all of a sudden these amalekites come up the first battle after the tokens applied they applied the yeah and they left egypt and the very first thing that comes up they all looked at moses most we got the amla kites on the way the first mention moses says joshua get ready you go choose some warriors we're going to battle tomorrow because now if somebody asked you to lead an army brother johnny how long would you want to prepare well even how long would you want to prepare to go find a battle today well we're going to go uh we're going to go up and we're going to invade canada how many days would you like how many years would you like to do this but moses says tomorrow joshua hit some men we're going to go we're going to go to defeat avalyn oh sure boss that sounds good yeah most of us church if we're honest we want to be ready to do that but the first mention we see is joshua he's asked to quickly assemble an army overnight i have a hard enough time assembling a sermon overnight let alone i guess it is a battle but not really like the same natural battle he said and lead him so he was a warrior strong confident in god so moses had already recognized in just a few weeks after maybe it was in egypt too maybe moses was watching joshua he's a mighty man i like he's a strong man he's a brave man he has the leading of the lord amen i can see the holy spirit that's all me it's cut on him too praise god and somehow after they leave these 2 million people out and their first battle comes moses says i'm going to choose joshua jehovah is salvation good choice moses jehovah is our salvation having said he's still our salvation today praise god he's still your salvation today it will be your salvation this week he will deliver you joshua's with you praise god he's with you in the capture he was there the whole time sitting there in the camp and he's just waiting to be called on but he was a servant first a servant first and then god called him well now you become the leader of the army you were a servant now i'm raising you up to general well how can i do this moses notice he doesn't know look what the scripture says then came amalek and followed israel and refered him and moses said choose out amen and go out and fight with amla tomorrow i will stand on top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand i'm gonna stand up there you go fine i'm gonna stand up there on the hill and i'm gonna hold the ride of god oh i imagine joshua said amen moses hey i saw you stretch that rod across that land amen i saw that i heard about the round right you heard on wednesday i heard about the rod being thrown down before pharaoh i heard that rod's got power i've heard you've got faith in god i heard that rise is supernatural surely yes i'll go out and fight because i know god is with you he's given you signs miracles and wonders and god is with us amen amen so joshua did as moses said unto him did he argue did he complain did he run away from the camp church no he went and did that which the prophet told him to do amen and fought with amulek and josh and moses aaron and her went up to the top of the hill i like that he's up on the hill and he's got his arms out like this so all josh had to do is look up and say ah the cross i see the cross and it's on the rock of revelation and as long as that crosses the arms rough they got their victory amen as long as the cross was proclaimed that's why the bible said the preaching of the cross is salvation to us we just had to look and as long as those brothers did their part as long as aaron and her held up moses's hands all that time then the people would get victorious oh and that's what brother said if you can just hold up your preachers in prayer and i'll say like this if you can just hold up your brothers and sisters in prayer we'll get the victory hold them up in prayer keep battling keep looking to the cross amen keep looking to jesus look at the victory amen i get to defeat god's army because even you know that we can't nobody can stop us praise god nobody can defeat god's army because we've got the cross of jesus amen amen hallelujah as long as everybody holds themselves up in prayer as long as everybody's praying and believing and looking to the cross we'll get the victory amen now just interesting these amalekites were the descendants of esau jacob and esau two twins see that always that evil spirit that oil that that will always come back to fight you in other words that anti-christ spirit is always going to be there to battle you but don't worry we've got god's word on our side praise god we've got the round of god praise god the rest of the round of god was the name of jesus because it was the power of god amen don't worry that's where that spiritual twin is going to try to rise up and fight against us but we'll overcome him because we're on god's side and i like what he says next remind joshua so they got the victory and the bible said he said discomfort with the edge of the sword what's the sword the word of god amen the joshua spoke the word he fought with the word and got a great victory and the lord said write for a memorial in a book rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of hamlet under heaven so god told josh to remember this because he had to pass it down to king saul and king hezekiah who would finish the work praise god i i know you're with me but church if we don't see the rapture in our time you better believe i'm going to pass down this thus saith the lord about the former latter reign i'm going to pass it down to the next generation praise god because that's how they're going to overcome that reign is rapturing faith praise god stay under the teaching ring like we saw on wednesday right said that teaching reign sarah was visited by two angels the former reign that discerned and then the latter rage that brought the body change amen did you see that on wednesday that was glorious i never seen him before genesis 18 the angel came and discerned like brother ran to serve that was the former reign the former visitation and then the lateran came in genesis 21 when the lord visited sarah according to the times and seasons according to the time of rapturing life amen oh that you got the body change oh thank god see that's our job church remember how we got the victory how did you get victory over the temptations in your life and you and i have to pass that to the next generation we may not see the rapture but we've got to pass it on to the next one because it's thus saith the lord somebody glory somebody is going to have death swallowed up in victory oh my i may not be the one that feels you know jeremiah felt it like fire in his bones right but we're gonna have more than that praise god we're gonna have like fire just engulf all of us and give us a brand new body in a moment i would tweak the light somebody is going to see death swallowed up in life hear me man but if it doesn't joshua you pass it down to the next generation brother sister you pass it down tell them somebody is going to conquer death somebody won't have to go to funeral service somebody will conquer and defeat them because death has lost its state amen amen hallelujah saul started it as a guy finished it destroyed that esau seed antichrist that twin antichrist seed the second mention shows his servant's heart again moses wanted the young general with him josh was closer to moses than the 70 elders because he said the lord said come up to me in the mouth and i'll be there i'll give you the tables of stone. and joshua rose up in his servant i like that don't you he knew he wasn't the top man right he wasn't the major guy he wasn't the top god but he was going to do everything he could to support that servant of god oh thank you lord and moses went up in the mount of god i know the scriptures up here but you know the 70s stopped at a certain location but josh when moses went a little higher hey to get the revelation amen and the bible says we're seated in heavenly places we've gone higher than denominations can go praise god we've gone higher because we're the joshua praise god we go up higher and we get the revelation that other people don't know anything about i thought i'd get a couple amens out of that one glory we don't get the law in stone we get it written on the fleshly tables of our hearts hallelujah glory that's good the third mention shows that he could discern sin just by the sound of the people as soon as they come down they got the tables who's the first one that speaks up joshua this don't sound like the holy ghost this sounds like a whirling party who picked that up first joshua she said this is the noise of war in the camp [Music] they said it's not the voice moses is not the voice of them that shout for mastery he's the voice of the net cry for being overcome but the noise of them that's seeing you out here so see joshua picked it up it wasn't a natural war it was a spiritual war they were worshiping that idol right so see that means true worship will always sound different than the false gods amen our churches are yes you've heard it how you hear it on youtube right when you listen to good stuff and the sound of the praising afterward doesn't really sound like praise it sounds like oh good good song that's not that's the wrong sound praise god amen we're not here to exalt man we're not here to exalt women we're here to praise jesus christ amen it has a different sound hallelujah listen to brothers prayer eyes sometimes you hear the real sound of worship amen you hear the noise in the camp of deliverance a praise a victory of thanksgiving of joy of peace there's a sound to it amen that's why i can do my shout in the church too i want to make sure it's the right sound praise god it's the sound of praise it's the sound of worship coming up before god that's what we need today amen joshua could pick that up right away doesn't sound like it doesn't sound like these people are really worshiping today oh my thank god amen thank god church if you're worshiping jesus in spirit and in truth i'm about at my hour here so let me see i've got a whole lot of preaching today fourth mentioned i love this one shows his desire to see god moses remember he got all the directions to build the the the tabernacle like in exodus 21 22-35 but here they finally set it up in exodus 33 and moses took it pitched it without the camp a far off from the camp and called it to the table that i'm trying to tabernacle the foundation and it came to pass when everyone would stop the lord went out of the tabernacle the congregation which was without the camp notice where he set it up did he set it right outside their tents no if they wanted to meet with god they had to leave their common everyday life and then to physically make a little journey to go out and worship god see because god likes to see who's gonna sacrifice who really wants to worship i like this god wants to see who really wants to see god that's what we got today anybody can come to any message church you can do that but the question is are you seeking god did you come to see god did you come to receive of god were you hungry for god joshua was out there constantly moses even left the tabernacle but joshua lived out there grace god joshua stayed out there seeking the lord that's what we've got to do continue to seek god all the time look what the bible says 11 lord speaking of moses face to face as a man speaking under his friend and he turned again into the camp so moses moses was going there brother amen he'd go right in the house of holies and he'd get face to face with god and he would leave out but joshua he couldn't go in the holy spirit but he would just stay there and seek god all the time he was just seeking after god's presence why he was a servant he was humble he wanted to make sure he knew the will of god he wanted to constantly seek the lord he departed not out of the tabernacle but he wasn't a priest so he couldn't go into the holiest i'm sure the holy place so he spent all that time in the outer court can you imagine that all that time out there in the outer court where there's sacrifices and pray that's what we do amen right we praise god we worship god he spent all this time he didn't like to leave he liked to stay in that atmosphere oh may god help us to stay in that atmosphere what did he learn from joshua warrior he's quit the battle he stayed in god's presence amen he loved to seek god this is what i found out about holy ghost real people all these things they're servants they want to stay in the in the presence of god they want to keep seeking god they want to know god better can i say it like that they want to know him better oh praise god the fifth mention he had zeal for moses but here he got corrected so see joshua was a perfect this is kind of like the moment where peter gets directed by jesus you know different places now joshua the son of none the servant of moses one of his young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them these were the men that were trying to help out moses remember moses has prayed and complained said god you what are you making me father over two million people remember he complained so what god do god said go down there to the tabernacle i'll take my spirit i'll divide it on 70 others and joshua said no no but moses said unto him envious thou for my sake joshua he said would god that all the lord's people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit upon them so this is one time joshua had to learn he was so zealous for moses he didn't understand that god wanted that blessing god god wants everybody to be a prophet in other words god wants all of us to have the holy ghost going through our lives amen right because bob said not all prophesied and i don't speak with tongues not all due healings but god wants his spirit flowing through all of our lives he wants everybody anointed amen so this is the one time we see joshua has to be corrected now and we know he made a mistake with the gibby knights as well right jimmy knights dressed up like they were all defeated and they tricked joshua joshua he paid for it we'll get to that he regretted that he couldn't take back his word of the lord that he spoke i want you to see that he was out so zealous for moses that he didn't understand the plan of god now there's a scripture there oh yeah mark 9 39 let me read that that's a good scripture this was uh jameson fawcett and brown and brother graham did use this commentary a little bit i have a few quotes on that mark 9 39. and this kind of goes back to what we said with these preachers falling away but look at verse 39. now remember they tried somebody who was casting out devils and wasn't following the disciples verse 39 but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle my name that can speak or lightly speak evil of me see that's what all these this is what all these uh the false anointed ones of the end times watch their words they never say anything evil against jesus but they got closet sins they got secret sins that they indulge in right and that's the danger here because most of all most of us we're not going to see any outward sins right like i told you the first one is usually people stop coming to terms that's usually the first indicator that they're really going to backslide the power says gather more she said they approaching well if you pull off and gather less that's a good sign you're not physically drawing hopes of god that's a good sign you're not spiritually drawing closer to god but here this is what they'll do they'll use the name of jesus always speak highly of that but then they will hide their sins and so we must see how this is why people can do it people can do miracles they can speak wonderful things of god have all kinds of uh acts that are great acts and help people but then they can forsake that anointing and they can go off to the evil spirit anointing as well thank god for the holy spirit because it's the spirit of truth truth what is the truth god help us always speak the truth admit the truth be honest praise god that's what we need to be in this day the spirit of truth because like that preacher i was saying they asked them new times are you doing this he flat out denied it and got angry so you watch when people get angry you watch many times it's a good sign they might not be right with god they get angry about you if you're trying to correct them about something and they get angry instead of humble watch that spirit watch that spirit i know don't get wrong jesus didn't flip over the money table the money changed he did it in anger we know he never said but watch humans right watch humanity today when they get mad that you're trying to ask them a little question or ask them uh about some integrity or things like that you see it all the time with children don't you yeah i see it all the time in school with children you try to correct them and they get mad or they get why are you getting mad if you're so innocent why are you getting mad about it i see that all the time that's usually how i know the ones that's upset the one that does sin the sixth mention shows joshua's faith in possessing the promised land he was one of the spies moses picked him him and caleb were two of the twelve and they went over and they saw the evidence of the land and they come back and this chapter opens but they're all upset they're all sad they're all screaming saying let's raise the captain up we don't want moses anymore let's face up a new prophet oh god is that what they got today but the bible said joshua and caleb search the land they rent their clothes they were so heartbroken look what god has done see joshua knew joshua knew god helped us defeat the amalekites we went through the red sea we we've got manna reigning down from heaven how can god be against us god is for us amen he read his clothes and say can't you see if god he says it like this he said if god delights in us god has blessed us he'll bring us into the land and give it to us a land was flowing with milk and honey church don't we know there's so many great blessings ahead of us can i say like that either way either way natural spiritually god's gonna protect us right but either way spiritually especially there are so many blessings ahead of us praise god if this crossing over represent the third floor there's so many more blessings waiting there praise god amen and if you're not born again there's so many blessings ahead of you oh there's so many victories ahead of you praise god oh it's not the time to quit it's not the time to be fearful it's not the time to give up it's time to go forward speak his word and go for it oh my thank you lord because god delighted you that's the question yes he does because he called me by grace saying that i didn't go looking for him he came looking for me he delights in me praise god he delights in you he delights in all his people praise god so there are the two voices he's one of the two voices that rises up the sixth mansion shows his faith in possessing the land he said only rebel not against the lord just don't transgress the word just keep the word neither fear the people that don't be afraid and keep the word amen for they are bred for us their defense is departed from them and the lord is with us hear them look hear them now look what he's saying we're just going to eat these guys up we're going to eat them up and spit them out look at the language god uses here they're just food to us we're just going to consume them church that's how we got to see all of our battles it's just going to be a victory we're going to devour it by the power of god amen whether it's a family situation whether it's a personal situation these battles that are before force they're there so we'll overcome that praise god but the rest of the church wanted to stone them with stones right there's a few message believers in the church that believe it everybody else went to stone oh my and the glory lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of israel thank god for his glory amen thank god his glory appears and answers our prayers amen he amen doubtless you shall not come into the land concerning which i swear to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jeffer and joshua the son of nun but your little ones which he said should be afraid then will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised now look at you need to catch that church the older generation was saying oh our children are just gonna they're just gonna be destroyed that's what people say today or our kids will never take the rapture our kids can never overcome cell phones or our kids can never overcome this god turns around and says the very ones you thought would be wimpy or weak they're the ones that's gonna take it praise god because the bigger the challenge the bigger the victory with joshua praise god amen these parents ought to be happy here today amen we should be happy and thankful that the god who brought us out is going to bring our children from canada praise god amen the greater the giant the greater the victory in god's eyes amen the bigger they are the harder they fall praise god that's right how about tell the story i'm not going to it's kind of it's kind of a cardinal story for my football games i think i'll pass them out it's very similar to get a much bigger opponent we meet them just kind of similar story like but he says they were scared for their children how the children are going to overcome oh god's still here see our god never checks out right the world their gods come and go their anointing comes and goes my anointing doesn't come and go my anointing is in the soul and it's in my soul to the day of redemption praise god i might not feel it out here but friends it never leaves when it's in here praise god pretty soon we'll come around to it right this this doesn't leave praise god our god is with us he said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age but as for you oh generation lorem did call them intellectual giants like we just had an intellectual giant fall he said as for you they'll fall in the wilderness the seventh mention is joshua showing he and caleb are the only two left two out of two million or one out of a million how many believe you're one out of a million today i believe that the eighth mention is joshua asking moses i'm sorry moses is asking god to set joshua as a leader now look at here joshua had some of moses's honor but not all and he became like a shepherd to israel moses prayed and said god would you anoint joshua that he can be a shepherd he can go before the people come in because the people need a leader praise god amen he said will you do that now like i said some of the honor because nobody was going to touch moses that was god's servant he was the meekest man on earth that's right that's a big portion now that this also includes the part where moses sinned against god and moses like god will you give me a second chance to go over and god said don't talk to me about that anymore god was so upset that moses glorified himself that even when moses asked a second or third time god said don't talk to me about that church may god help us to always be humble right and not magnify ourselves not try to show off but just be humble and just do what the word says amen now i think there's 15 mentions here okay i'm going to skip ahead i'm closing with this i'll just get past those that told y'all not to preach today okay so as i was with moses let's let's close with this verse five said there shall not any man be able to stick all the days of thy life once the servant once the faithful servant who constantly sought god brothers and sisters we need to constantly seek god once this faithful servant who all the time just stayed at the church he just said he just wanted to stay at the church and just be in god's presence just see god all the time study god's word pray ask for wisdom once that servant finally got there and got in place and got his position the holy spirit said no man will be able to defeat you all the days in your life now we know what happened right he had one mistake there with the gimme nights but every time he got back right with god nobody could stand before him right doesn't that apply to us as well praise god what man or what woman is going to defy or stand before and defy and overcome the bride of jesus there won't be a woman you believe that he said as long as you stay with the words as long as you meditate on the things of god and do it day and night no man or woman will be able to stand before you all the days of your life what a promise church in other words sounds like somebody's invincible praise god amen because with god all things will be possible you're only invincible because you're obedient to god right no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life that's real to me right because last year billy paul joseph branham rod bergen and it wasn't me but it was the word i saw the word that no one could stand above and deny this word praise god nobody can overcome it nobody can bring something against the real revelation of jesus christ amen nobody can defeat that right because it is the it is the all-powerful it's the living sharp sword of god's word that discerns the thoughts and intents of the hearts praise god amen glory he said as i was with the prophet so would i be with you i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong we're going to go over this one of these sermons coming up morgan this is this phrase is said about 10 times in the bible moses tells joshua over and over be strong and be of good courage don't be weak and discouraged don't be weak i'm gonna have to keep repeating it to you too because i need it too moses says it like five times be strong and courageous because god is with you praise god don't be afraid there's nothing to fear joshua thank god he said you're gonna divide this people he said but just meditate on the word no one will be able to withstand you or stand before you all the days of your life that proved it to me i remember when i was so nervous writing joseph amelia i remember i remember shaking i remember shaking right here i shook right here before that debate i remember that and i've had some i've had some meetings with people that left the church where i was shaking and praying and fasting before too but in the presence of the holy spirit no man or woman has been able to stand in the presence
