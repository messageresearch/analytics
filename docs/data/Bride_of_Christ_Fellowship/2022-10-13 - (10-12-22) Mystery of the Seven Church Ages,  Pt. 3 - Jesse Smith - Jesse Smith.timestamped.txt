[0:00] kind of just preach on some foundational
[0:02] truce but I don't I don't see Randy and
[0:05] I don't see Jeannie that's okay
[0:09] [Laughter]
[0:11] all right let's go to Acts 2 38 now
[0:16] well I think you're like a home person
[0:18] sometimes brother you know you
[0:20] celebrated your 70th birthday and 40th
[0:23] anniversary with us I mean you're
[0:24] starting to feel like family around here
[0:25] brother
[0:28] Hallelujah
[0:29] we're all family by the blood praise God
[0:31] Amen Revelation 1 verse 20. I think I'll
[0:34] just continue on the series then and you
[0:36] know Lord willing uh Sunday out I've
[0:38] been doing a little bit of teaching here
[0:39] I'll try to maybe get back to some
[0:40] preaching and I've got some different
[0:41] thoughts and
[0:43] you know kind of raised our faith I'd
[0:44] like to get back to like I said miracles
[0:46] and you know just go through those and
[0:48] they always seem to raise my faith and
[0:50] we'll just kind of see how the Lord
[0:51] directs
[0:52] by the grace of the Lord Revelation 1
[0:54] verse 20. it's our
[0:56] continue on part three on the mystery of
[0:58] the seven Church ages by God's grace
[1:04] it's a great lesson especially for our
[1:06] young ones you know I think
[1:09] you know one of the greatest studies I
[1:10] ever did was on the seven Church ages
[1:12] and then on the Seven Seals and it has
[1:15] it has formed and shaped my Christian
[1:17] Life
[1:18] because when all these false teachers
[1:20] come around and say oh the church age is
[1:21] wrong the Seven Seals that's actually
[1:23] what I go back to
[1:25] as just a confirmation I was right
[1:28] brother Rand was right because his
[1:31] teaching was straight from the scripture
[1:33] agree with history so this is the
[1:35] foundation so I'm so thankful our young
[1:37] ones also Austin Alina you know can hear
[1:40] these messages and I just I'm very
[1:43] thankful for them and I'm sure they're
[1:44] good Refreshments for our Saints who've
[1:47] been on the uh the battlefield for many
[1:49] years by God's grace I know it's a
[1:51] blessing to me as well so
[1:52] praise God of course you know the
[1:55] message is under attack but we're
[1:57] defending it by God's grace amen
[1:59] so Revelation 1 verse 20.
[2:04] Revelation 1 verse 20.
[2:07] it's been a wonderful week as well you
[2:09] know the Lord has poured out a couple
[2:10] blessings you know I was I was praying
[2:12] for a little bit of
[2:14] um you know help you know and two
[2:18] individuals in particular from different
[2:19] states you know sent some help for our
[2:21] church so it was a real blessing
[2:23] you know so we can help out you know our
[2:25] Saints and then uh just you know small
[2:27] little love offerings but it's a great
[2:28] blessing and so uh I almost started
[2:31] crying when I opened those kind of
[2:32] letters I'm like I just prayed for this
[2:33] you know
[2:35] like it's just God's grace to me so
[2:38] just reminds me how much he loves me
[2:39] praise God and how much he loves you too
[2:42] because I'm no bit I'm no different than
[2:43] you that's not what I mean I just meant
[2:45] I know I had individual prayers in God
[2:47] uh you know answered so if those two are
[2:50] listening you know God bless those two
[2:51] sisters
[2:53] um just for their kindness and
[2:54] generosity to help out the Saints by
[2:56] God's grace
[2:59] so let's read this here tonight uh on

[4:57] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[4:59] said amen God bless you as you're being
[5:01] seated praise God
[5:05] yeah like I said I was hoping we'd had
[5:07] you know a visitor or something like
[5:08] that but uh you know a returning visitor
[5:10] rather and that's okay so we'll look at
[5:13] this thought here uh tonight how's the
[5:16] audio seem honey so far seem okay all
[5:18] right praise God we had better audio on
[5:19] Sunday someone thank brother bang for
[5:21] that he'd come in and
[5:22] he changed some things there so
[5:25] thanks to brother bang if he's listening
[5:27] hopefully hopefully it keeps going good
[5:30] by God's grace so last week we looked at
[5:33] uh the seven Church ages and we kind of
[5:35] saw let's say our Focus was the biblical
[5:37] evidence for the Seven Stars and the
[5:39] Seven golden candlesticks
[5:41] um especially looked at how the Angels
[5:43] were human preachers and how the Bible
[5:46] backs that up
[5:47] so tonight we're here by God's grace
[5:50] we'll look at let's look at the three
[5:52] applications for the seven letters so if
[5:53] you have your Bibles handy I might call
[5:55] and somebody to read if you look ready
[5:56] or look like you're turning your Bible I
[5:58] might call you to read it no pressure I
[6:00] don't want to pressure anybody to read
[6:01] except my own children I am going to
[6:03] pressure them praise God because they
[6:05] need some pressure in their lives I'm
[6:06] sure
[6:07] uh but anyways let's look at three
[6:09] applications you know
[6:11] um one of the great mysteries about this
[6:12] topic the seven uh letters is does it
[6:15] apply prophetically or is it was were
[6:17] these letters just to seven Gentile
[6:20] churches around 80 95 or 80 100 we know
[6:24] the Revelation uh was that there's three
[6:26] applications they apply uh to that those
[6:30] individual seven churches literally and
[6:33] then they apply prophetically to the
[6:34] seven Church ages and they also apply
[6:37] individually to your life okay so we'll
[6:39] look we'll look at these hopefully here
[6:41] tonight uh and hope it'll be a blessing
[6:44] you know I was kind of preparing just
[6:46] you know trying to prepare my heart and
[6:47] I was just listening to this chapter
[6:48] while I was driving to work and driving
[6:50] home and I was just like wow God really
[6:52] uh anointed me to write a book because I
[6:54] don't feel like I could do that right
[6:55] now you know and so whenever God calls
[6:57] you to do something you look back later
[6:59] and said it was God's spirit that led me
[7:01] to do that
[7:03] to think that I would uh if I right now
[7:05] would say okay I'm going to write a 832
[7:07] page book right now I don't think I
[7:09] could do that right now
[7:10] and whatever God has called you to do
[7:12] you know um it takes the leadership of
[7:14] the Holy Spirit praise God so I thank
[7:16] the Lord you know that he anoints us and
[7:19] it's his strength praise God not my
[7:21] strength and not your strength it's his
[7:23] strength praise God Amen that gets us to
[7:25] do God's will praise God is God it is
[7:28] Christ in us hallelujah always causing
[7:30] us to Triumph amen
[7:32] now let's look here these seven letters
[7:34] literally apply to the Christians around
[7:36] 80 95. okay and there are uh scripture
[7:40] confirms this because both the Ephesus
[7:43] the cities of Ephesus and laodicea had
[7:46] established churches okay so
[7:49] um Ephesians 1 verse one I'll probably
[7:51] be flipping through here and then
[7:53] Colossians 2 verse 1.
[7:55] and then Colossians 4 13-16
[7:58] it's clear from the Bible that these
[8:01] churches were established right so
[8:03] Ephesians 1 verse 1 says Paul an apostle
[8:06] of Jesus Christ by the will of God to
[8:07] the Saints which are at Ephesus and to
[8:10] the faithful in Christ Jesus of course
[8:13] Paul wrote this around 64 A.D Paul wrote
[8:16] this letter so this church was still
[8:18] there about 35 years later it was still
[8:22] there and so the Holy Spirit bless you
[8:24] brother uh told told John right or Jesus
[8:28] told John write a letter and send it to
[8:30] the church at Ephesus so it's still
[8:31] there
[8:32] praise God Colossians 2 verse 1.
[8:36] you can see how there was uh scriptural
[8:39] support that these churches were still
[8:40] in existence Colossians 2 verse 1. for I
[8:44] would that ye knew what great conflict I
[8:46] have for you and for them at laodicea
[8:48] and for as many as have not seen my face
[8:51] in the flesh so here's a scripture again
[8:52] where
[8:53] Paul says there is a church in laodicea
[8:56] praise God and he has great Conflict for
[8:59] them so he has a great burden for them
[9:01] that's how we should feel about the
[9:03] Saints in our church that's how we
[9:04] should feel about the churches around us
[9:05] we should have a great conflict we
[9:06] should have a great love for them praise
[9:08] God we should love all the churches
[9:10] around us praise God in Colossians 4 13.
[9:14] through 16. this is a for I bear him
[9:18] record that he hath a great Zeal for you
[9:19] and them that are in laodice there's
[9:21] another record there's a church in
[9:22] laodicea and then in hieropolis
[9:25] Luke the Beloved Physician and Demus
[9:27] greach you salute the brother and which
[9:28] are in laodicea and nymphis and the
[9:32] church which is in his house isn't that
[9:34] something Church
[9:35] as long as people are gathering in a
[9:37] house the Holy Spirit recognized there's
[9:39] a church in that City
[9:40] isn't that beautiful Church never have a
[9:43] complex we have to have some big
[9:44] building or some big denomination or
[9:46] some big structure God is not looking at
[9:48] that God's looking at the quality of the
[9:50] worship praise God he's not looking at
[9:52] the quantity
[9:53] Hallelujah that's why you know really
[9:55] our church probably started around uh
[9:58] 2003 when Tim Meyer started these uh
[10:00] College meetings on Saturday nights
[10:02] that's really when there was a church in
[10:04] Akron praise God
[10:05] and so here we are you know all these
[10:07] years later and now we got actually
[10:08] you're renting a little space but God
[10:11] recognizes wherever two or three are
[10:13] gathered and where there's a people that
[10:14] are called out for Jesus Christ there's
[10:16] a church right there praise God
[10:18] beautiful beautiful thought there from
[10:20] Paul
[10:21] a small Humble Church
[10:23] in a house so think about that the
[10:26] churches you know the churches in China
[10:28] that are getting persecuted the churches
[10:30] in Saudi Arabia that are being
[10:31] persecuted or Kenya wherever they are
[10:34] those small little churches wherever
[10:35] they are the holy spirit's right there
[10:36] and dealing with them praise God and
[10:39] he's he's guiding their Pastor every
[10:40] Wednesday and every Sunday to preach the
[10:42] word of God Amen just like here praise
[10:44] God no different
[10:46] The Same Spirit giving them the same
[10:47] Revelation through the word of God
[10:49] hallelujah Faithfully uh feeding the
[10:52] sheep and we encountered a privilege
[10:53] tonight that we can come feed on the
[10:55] word of God tonight hallelujah it's a
[10:57] real privilege that we can gather around
[10:59] because those were individual cities
[11:01] with individual churches and Jesus
[11:03] Through Paul recognized them that they
[11:06] were genuine churches even as small as
[11:08] house churches praise God also the
[11:10] Church of laodicea was still there in
[11:12] the 4th Century which was
[11:15] over 200 years after the Book of
[11:18] Revelation was finished there was still
[11:19] a church in laodicea so all the history
[11:23] Bears record that these letters did
[11:25] apply to those local churches
[11:28] right and of course Jesus letters he he
[11:31] complimented some of the churches and
[11:33] then some of them he he rebuked praise
[11:34] God the seven churches says we'll get to
[11:36] those here down through history by God's
[11:38] grace now what's what's what's what
[11:41] struck me as amazing was when I was
[11:43] writing this book uh John's letters
[11:45] actually seemed to be the final call to
[11:47] some of these churches
[11:49] because remember all the Asian churches
[11:51] which were turkey churches uh churches
[11:53] churches in turkey at that time have
[11:55] rejected Paul by the end of his ministry
[11:57] which was 8067.
[11:59] so uh if you can pull that up second
[12:01] Timothy 1 verse 15 occasion and thanks
[12:03] for doing that with uh uh Jen on your
[12:05] lap there I appreciate that that can't
[12:07] be easy
[12:08] second Timothy uh one verse 15.
[12:11] this thou knowest that all they which
[12:13] are in Asia be turned away from me of
[12:16] whom are Phi jealous and homogeneous now
[12:20] of course this is hyperbole not every
[12:23] single person in Asia had turned for
[12:25] Paul because Paul still had friends in
[12:26] Asia like onesimus right and some of
[12:28] these saints that we've heard about you
[12:30] know through the book of Colossians but
[12:31] he he gives this idea the churches are
[12:34] quickly falling away from me
[12:37] and so Jesus had John write this letter
[12:39] 35 years later kind of like a final call
[12:43] send this letter out to the the Ephesus
[12:46] Church the Samaritan Church the pergamos
[12:48] the fire tier in church send these out
[12:50] as kind of like a final call
[12:52] uh to see if they'll repent because
[12:53] remember Jesus tells every Church age
[12:55] you've got to repent
[12:57] he tells everyone you've got to be an
[12:58] overcomer praise God I'm looking for
[13:00] Overcomers amen he's still looking for
[13:02] Overcomers today praise God
[13:05] that's the main call if you could
[13:06] summarize it what does Jesus want you to
[13:08] do overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[13:10] the word of your testimony praise God
[13:12] so this is like Jesus's final call to
[13:16] many of these and notice that was 35
[13:17] years that's almost a generation
[13:20] almost a generation so from the time
[13:22] Paul goes off the scene one more
[13:24] generation passes and Jesus sends a
[13:26] final letter
[13:28] right through John he sends a final
[13:30] letter to each of the seven churches and
[13:32] they have one more chance to repent
[13:34] isn't God gracious Church
[13:36] that even after 40 years or 50 years God
[13:39] will still cause a man to repent and get
[13:41] his heart right with God Amen kind of
[13:45] like God sent us to Kathy subic's mom
[13:46] there we got the baptizer she was 89
[13:49] years old carried down to the water just
[13:50] months before she would die
[13:52] God Richard Mercy imagine decade after
[13:54] decade you know the thing about that the
[13:57] teens the 20s the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s
[13:59] but then the 80s she gets a chance to
[14:01] hear the message and get baptized in the
[14:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ months
[14:05] before she dies amen that's Mercy
[14:07] hallelujah amen thank God Amen Jesus is
[14:10] full of Second Chances amen hallelujah
[14:14] for many many chances
[14:16] so Jesus gives these churches these
[14:18] seven churches one more chance to repent
[14:21] after they'd already heard Paul's gospel
[14:23] amen beautiful thought there so see they
[14:26] literally applied because they were
[14:27] literal churches there and they got
[14:29] literal letters from Paul they got
[14:31] literal letters from John and of course
[14:33] the later see in church lasted a lot
[14:34] longer of course they probably back said
[14:36] uh now let's see how they're prophetic
[14:38] so if you got your Bible uh Revelation 1
[14:41] verse 3.
[14:44] I guess these were just kind of
[14:45] foundational here Revelation 1 verse 3
[14:47] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[14:49] hear the words of this prophecy
[14:52] so we know this is a book of Prophecy
[14:54] it's foretelling events are going to
[14:57] happen over the next 2000 years so we
[15:00] see that in verse 3 verse 19 repeats it
[15:02] says write the things which thou has
[15:04] seen and the things which are and the
[15:06] things which shall be Hereafter it is
[15:08] undeniable this is a prophetic book
[15:10] Hallelujah
[15:12] so John was addressing the current
[15:15] spiritual conditions of those seven
[15:16] churches in his lifetime yet he was
[15:19] foretelling future conditions Hallelujah
[15:22] now let me give you three examples one
[15:24] of them this uh you may not be familiar
[15:27] with but I'm going to give there's three
[15:29] clear-cut examples it's undeniable that
[15:31] these seven letters in Revelation uh
[15:34] prophesied of future events
[15:36] okay the first was Jesus warned the
[15:38] church in Smyrna that have tribulation
[15:40] 10 days but must be faithful unto death
[15:44] and that was in Revelation 2 verse 10.
[15:47] so you pull that up there hon
[15:49] so Jesus tells the Church of Smyrna you
[15:52] be faithful to death in other words
[15:54] you're going to die
[15:55] you are going to die for your faith but
[15:57] be faithful and and know that you're
[16:00] going to give your life as a testimony
[16:01] for Christ
[16:03] amen
[16:04] fear none of those things which Thou
[16:06] shalt suffer now look he's telling them
[16:07] you are going to suffer
[16:09] but don't fear the suffering praise God
[16:12] don't fear I'm letting you know and this
[16:15] was what this was 200 years in advance
[16:17] I'm letting the future Generations know
[16:19] you're going to suffer some of you are
[16:22] going to get cast into prison you're
[16:23] going to be tried and you should have
[16:25] tribulation 10 days be faithful unto
[16:28] death not until right but unto death
[16:31] praise God in other words accept that
[16:33] God wants you to die as a martyr except
[16:35] that this is your testimony you get the
[16:38] martyrs Crown amen
[16:40] brother said you get a crown for a
[16:42] martyr or crown for daily striving
[16:44] either one you get a crown
[16:46] eternal life there's a Martyrs crowd and
[16:48] there's a crown for daily striving in
[16:50] other words daily overcoming amen like
[16:52] like what you've got to do praise God
[16:53] daily getting the victory through our
[16:55] Lord Jesus Christ now give thee a Crown
[16:58] of Life brother Adam says that's a
[16:59] martyr's crown praise God
[17:03] now I don't uh I'm not sure how familiar
[17:05] we are with this one but uh go to
[17:07] numbers 14 34. honey if you would
[17:10] one day can symbolize a year in the
[17:13] scripture
[17:15] now okay why don't you read that one can
[17:16] you read that before go ahead
[17:27] amen so Israel got 40 years for each of
[17:31] those 40 days
[17:33] okay so the the punishment was for each
[17:35] day one year
[17:36] so a day can represent a year Ezekiel 4
[17:39] verse 5 and 6. Lydia why don't you read
[17:41] that when you get a chance Ezekiel 4 5
[17:43] and 6. so we have numerous Witnesses one
[17:46] day can symbolize a year
[17:51] where I've laid upon you the years of
[17:53] their iniquity according to the number
[17:55] of the days 390 days so shut up bear the
[17:58] iniquity of the House of Israel a one
[18:00] that has to accomplish them lie again on
[18:02] my right side and thou shall bear the
[18:04] iniquity of the house of Judah 40 days
[18:05] I've pointed thee each day for a year
[18:09] all right great job thank you each day
[18:11] for year so I'm also remembering uh
[18:16] yeah okay no that's that was times
[18:17] that's a different one I was thinking of
[18:18] Revelation 12 but it said time times and
[18:20] half a time that was time not the word
[18:22] day but thank you I appreciate that now
[18:25] Jesus said I'm giving you a warning of
[18:28] 10 days now there's one of two
[18:30] applications for this literally by
[18:32] History either it was the ten
[18:34] persecutions on the on the anti-nician
[18:37] church that means the church before the
[18:38] Nicene Council which was around 325 A.D
[18:43] with Constantine or it was diocletian's
[18:46] 10-year persecution
[18:49] okay so beginning with Nero the Roman
[18:52] Emperor and ending with Diocletian there
[18:54] were 10 major persecutions from 64 A.D
[18:58] to 303 A.D
[19:00] okay
[19:02] so that's what that was it was either
[19:03] that one the 10 major persecutions from
[19:05] 64 to 303 or
[19:09] uh Jesus was warning them of a
[19:11] decade-long or 10-day decade-long
[19:13] Christian persecution by the Roman
[19:16] emperor Diocletian from 303 to 313.
[19:21] and then Constantine actually was
[19:22] credited with bringing an end to this
[19:24] madness which that's why there's some
[19:26] confusion was he good or bad well he was
[19:28] likely bad
[19:29] but are we glad the persecution ended
[19:32] yes
[19:33] now let me read a little bit about this
[19:35] about how he brought this uh on
[19:39] Diocletian here
[19:42] this 10-year period was Rome's longest
[19:45] and bloodiest persecution of Christians
[19:48] Christians were hunted strips of their
[19:50] rights brutalized and killed
[19:54] uh it was believed uh he uh Diocletian
[19:57] was upset because Christianity was
[19:59] monotheism and not polytheism so that
[20:02] went against all the Christian all the
[20:04] Roman uh religions and holidays right
[20:06] Christianity was considered to be a
[20:08] strange foreign cop that
[20:10] destabilized the Empire so for the sake
[20:13] of unity he tried to get all the Romans
[20:16] sharing a common face so he thought
[20:18] death was the best way to do that kill
[20:20] off anyone who descends
[20:23] and then he and he thought also if
[20:25] Christianity was officially tolerated
[20:26] the Wrath of the Roman gods would be
[20:28] stirred up
[20:30] okay so here's how he did it
[20:33] um beginning February 23rd 303
[20:36] the first order he gave was destroying
[20:38] the newly built church and its library
[20:41] of sacred writings
[20:43] in one of the cities in Asia Minor
[20:47] after that attack he issued the first of
[20:50] four edicts denying Christian Believers
[20:52] their rights including their right to
[20:54] assemble for worship
[20:55] so first he attacks churches by
[20:57] destroying them and then he says you
[20:59] can't gather anymore sound familiar like
[21:01] the squeeze right we've heard brother
[21:02] Adam say brother said the the uh this
[21:06] one world government is going to shut
[21:07] down your churches so we can't worship
[21:09] anymore
[21:10] he said one day they'll shut them down
[21:11] they'll boycott real churches now unless
[21:14] you take the unless you agree to to to
[21:17] be a part of that right now the mark
[21:19] won't come down but they'll they'll
[21:20] agree to become a part of it before the
[21:22] Mark is laid down the churches will
[21:26] so he destroys churches and then he uh
[21:28] takes the next step
[21:30] my you cannot worship
[21:33] and then after that you can't worship
[21:35] now you're ordered you must participate
[21:37] in sacrificial rights to Rome's pagan
[21:40] gods he's going to make sure you go to
[21:42] their religious festivals if you aren't
[21:43] there
[21:45] uh you can expect torture or death can
[21:47] you imagine that
[21:48] torture death
[21:50] so there were gonna there was going to
[21:51] be a head count at their Pagan Festival
[21:53] so they had some really awful Wicked
[21:56] festivals
[21:57] with all kinds of wicked acts and if you
[21:59] don't show up to that they're going to
[22:01] hunt you down and kill you you got no
[22:03] church to go to they're burnt down in
[22:04] their clothes are locked up and now
[22:06] you've got to physically go out and
[22:08] worship with them at these uh Wicked uh
[22:11] festivals
[22:13] now two years later it says
[22:16] uh
[22:19] I'm sorry here now let me get back to
[22:22] this here
[22:26] yeah I'm not going to read that part but
[22:27] anyways the next 10 years are filled
[22:30] with all the worst forms of death I
[22:32] think I'll just stop it right there but
[22:34] you can see how the government issued it
[22:35] out first right they they destroy the
[22:37] writings they destroy the Bibles right
[22:39] they destroy the worship you can't
[22:41] worship anymore and then they start
[22:43] physically hunting them down
[22:45] all right and Jesus though by his grace
[22:48] warned them and said don't fear that now
[22:50] my if you think uh if you if we think we
[22:53] got something coming we can trust the
[22:55] Lord that the Lord will give us courage
[22:56] and help us to overcome fear if any of
[22:59] that would ever happen in our time
[23:00] praise God we can have courage because
[23:02] if they did at church and some of them
[23:04] didn't even have the full revelation we
[23:06] have in the Samaritan Church age right
[23:07] and if they could stand Hallelujah if
[23:09] they could take the anointing of God and
[23:11] stand and give their be faithful unto
[23:13] death that we can do the same praise God
[23:16] because we can see how the American
[23:17] government now of course is against
[23:19] conservative Christians I mean it's so
[23:21] obvious it's painfully obvious uh no
[23:25] but we know prophecy says it's going
[23:27] that way we don't know when but prophecy
[23:29] says brother Adam said thus saith the
[23:30] Lord he said this nation will exercise
[23:32] the same power that the Roman uh ancient
[23:35] Rome exercised with their persecutions
[23:37] so this diode equation type of spirit is
[23:40] coming back to America
[23:42] but we're going to be we're going to be
[23:44] on the other side we will not join with
[23:45] them we'll be on the other side
[23:48] many Holy Martyrs died but thanks to
[23:50] Jesus's warning 200 years in advance
[23:52] they had the attitude and they knew they
[23:56] must be faithful unto death and so the
[23:58] Bible said and the Bible records it even
[24:00] more the more people that died the more
[24:02] Christianity spread praise God Amen the
[24:05] more you tried to put out the fire you
[24:07] just fan the flames and the Flames grew
[24:09] hotter praise God
[24:11] because people would see those those uh
[24:13] those Martyrs they would see that and
[24:14] then they would they would they would
[24:15] Escape their homes and they would spread
[24:17] the faith they would they would secretly
[24:19] gather or they would move away and they
[24:21] would have this Freedom they would
[24:22] spread the gospel it's always Fanning
[24:24] the Flames Hallelujah this church cannot
[24:26] be stopped Hallelujah
[24:28] Hallelujah they've never been able to
[24:30] kill the Christian church and stop it
[24:32] it's impossible to stop and praise God
[24:34] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[24:36] it amen Hallelujah that's the first
[24:39] reason
[24:41] undeniable history that these seven
[24:43] letters are historic the second one
[24:45] Jesus foretold the open door age
[24:48] the uh to the Church of Philadelphia in
[24:51] Revelation 3 we're not going to read it
[24:52] but this was from 1750 to 1906. they the
[24:56] world saw the greatest missionary
[24:57] efforts through men like William Carey
[24:59] in India and David Livingstone in Africa
[25:03] Hallelujah these men Hazard their whole
[25:06] lives some of them learn multiple
[25:07] languages
[25:08] some of them I think if I'm not mistaken
[25:10] William Carey lost his wife
[25:12] and became a widow because of the
[25:14] diseases in India yet they uh he built
[25:17] all these schools maybe scores of
[25:18] schools and churches his influence is
[25:20] still going on today
[25:22] Christianity is there and the real
[25:24] Christians are there because of William
[25:25] Carey's efforts to be a missionary
[25:28] praise God oh think of that think of the
[25:30] rewards these people are going to get
[25:32] sacrificing their lives leaving their
[25:34] homes you know going off with no money
[25:37] just trusting God learning languages my
[25:40] forsaking everything and going for
[25:43] Christ Jesus said you'll receive a
[25:44] hundred fold in this world and in the
[25:46] world to come praise God
[25:49] undeniable
[25:50] that there was an open door and we'll
[25:52] get to this eventually but the open door
[25:54] means that no man could shut it in other
[25:56] words this was the age when the Pope's
[25:58] power was waning
[26:00] his power was weakening no longer were
[26:02] the world leaders you know obeying
[26:04] everything he said his power is
[26:05] weakening uh Napoleon Bonaparte was the
[26:08] uh I'm not saying I'm not sure if I'm
[26:10] saying that right but he was a famous
[26:11] one who defied the Pope
[26:13] and then it was just a sign it was a
[26:15] signal he's no longer in control but but
[26:18] Jesus was doing that Jesus was shutting
[26:20] their door Hallelujah and he was opening
[26:22] the door missionary work praise God
[26:23] hallelujah thank God Amen
[26:27] undeniable those are two historical
[26:28] events the third one
[26:30] the final one is the lukewarm condition
[26:33] of the final Church of laodicea which
[26:37] represents today's churches falling away
[26:39] from the faith putting Jesus's Spirit
[26:41] outside their churches praise God
[26:44] remember brother Simon was here and he
[26:45] was showing he was showing some history
[26:47] about how this has to be the laodicean
[26:50] church age because of all the advances
[26:52] in science right all these advances all
[26:55] these blessings and yet people do not
[26:56] grow closer to God you would think with
[26:58] all these blessings like a washing
[27:00] machine
[27:01] with fast food places right
[27:04] you don't you don't have to be a farmer
[27:05] not everybody has to be a farmer with
[27:07] all these benefits of living in this age
[27:09] running water
[27:10] you don't have to have to go out to the
[27:12] outhouse
[27:13] Hallelujah in the middle of winter can
[27:14] you imagine that guy's walking out there
[27:16] to use the restroom in the middle of the
[27:17] night in the wintertime snowstorm with
[27:20] all these blessings all the rich and
[27:22] increases good you would think people
[27:23] want more of God but it's actually
[27:25] produced the opposite effect in most
[27:26] people now in us it's produced a Hunger
[27:29] for More Of God Amen because we see it's
[27:31] it's blessings but it just doesn't bring
[27:34] fulfillment it doesn't bring life it
[27:36] just brings uh more longer natural life
[27:38] but we still see the Holy Spirit uh
[27:41] moving amongst us and we desire more
[27:43] spiritual life praise God we realize
[27:45] there's more to life than clothes
[27:46] there's more to life than natural
[27:47] blessings the real life is Faith in
[27:50] Jesus Christ Our Lord
[27:52] amen
[27:53] but Simon proved I can't remember the
[27:54] actual fact but he listed a beautiful
[27:56] fact about the Industrial Revolution and
[27:58] how it it totally changed life for
[28:02] everyone oh yeah it was the uh it was
[28:04] the uh age span
[28:06] I think before that it was like 30 or 40
[28:08] years your lifespan was estimated think
[28:11] about that I'd already be dead if it
[28:14] wasn't the Industrial Revolution I'd
[28:16] already probably have uh you know
[28:17] diseases and die
[28:19] but once Industrial Revolution it turned
[28:21] the age to 75 or was it 80. I mean you
[28:24] would think with all these outstanding
[28:26] blessings Richard increased with Goods
[28:28] that more people would be interested in
[28:29] serving God but it has the opposite
[28:31] effect when people love the God of this
[28:33] world more than the god of Heaven ah but
[28:36] thank God the god of Heaven he didn't
[28:38] stay in heaven his spirit is there yes
[28:40] but he come to live in your soul praise
[28:42] God the god of Heaven come down to earth
[28:44] amen to live in a tabernacle of Flesh
[28:47] hallelujah oh my thank you Jesus
[28:49] Hallelujah
[28:50] so it's clear we're in the laodicean
[28:52] church age Jesus spirit is outside the
[28:55] majority of churches they no longer
[28:57] speak for him
[28:58] because they're speaking for lgbqt
[29:01] rights and all these things
[29:03] they're speaking for rights of Sinners
[29:04] rather than the the truth of the word of
[29:07] God they're not speaking for Jesus
[29:08] Anymore for if you speak for Jesus
[29:10] you'll say what the holy spirit says
[29:12] amen
[29:14] now again remember this laodicean
[29:17] condition prompted Jesus to say in Luke
[29:20] 18 verse 8 can you pull it up there look
[29:22] at the words of Jesus
[29:26] we ought to be encouraged that we find
[29:28] Faith among each other because Jesus
[29:30] says when I return will I even find
[29:32] faith on the Earth that's what I like
[29:34] hearing your testimonies you keep
[29:35] sharing your testimonies Church you keep
[29:37] sharing them by God's grace I don't know
[29:38] if we'll have time for sister who is on
[29:39] Sunday or not you know but
[29:41] that's uh I just got more emails about
[29:43] that this week thank you for Austin and
[29:44] Naomi's testimonies I got those emails
[29:45] this week people just thanking me for
[29:47] those
[29:48] uh it's such an encouragement they
[29:50] needed to hear that praise God
[29:52] Jesus says when I come will I find faith
[29:55] on the earth or will it be a lukewarm
[29:56] condition where I spew the churches out
[29:59] of my mouth and they're not even talking
[30:00] for me they're not even speaking Faith
[30:02] oh my but if the word of God is in you
[30:04] it will speak Faith praise God
[30:06] because when you hear the word it puts
[30:08] faith in your heart praise God and the
[30:10] word of God is not you even in your
[30:12] mouth Hallelujah amen
[30:16] so there's three clear-cut
[30:18] undeniable examples now are there more
[30:20] yes there are more that's what the rest
[30:21] of the chapter is about because I go
[30:23] through each Church age and I show all
[30:25] the historical events but not all of
[30:27] them but as many as I could find that
[30:28] validate Jesus was Pro Prof I'm sorry
[30:32] prophesying to the next two thousand
[30:34] years
[30:35] all right now now this one's good for us
[30:37] here let's see how the seven letters
[30:39] speak prophetically to us today
[30:42] they speak prophetically to us
[30:46] okay so the first example is a
[30:48] Revelation 2 4. I mentioned this briefly
[30:50] on Sunday but I didn't get to it
[30:53] every honest Christian knows and if
[30:55] you're honest tonight you might whisper
[30:56] an amen
[30:57] or you just might say ouch or you might
[30:59] shout amen but every honest Christian
[31:01] knows you know what it's like to lose to
[31:03] leave your first love
[31:06] that first feeling that first I can
[31:09] still remember wow I feel like my eyes
[31:11] were like this big when I heard serpent
[31:12] seed you know wow we stayed up till 12.
[31:15] listen to a two-hour long sermon you
[31:17] know about Serpentine I didn't have any
[31:18] trouble with that it was just I wasn't
[31:20] going to sleep I was Wide Awake My Soul
[31:23] my heart my eye my mind was just blown
[31:26] away
[31:28] and all I want to do after that is
[31:29] listen to sermons praise God
[31:31] different than denominational thinking
[31:32] right
[31:34] Jesus said as many as I I'm sorry
[31:36] nevertheless I have this against thee
[31:37] you've left your first love
[31:40] so see these letters also speak to every
[31:43] individual
[31:44] so not just those churches you know 2000
[31:46] years ago and not just prophetically but
[31:49] they also speak to you and I oh I love
[31:51] it a threefold three three is perfection
[31:53] Hallelujah there it is amen I was
[31:55] waiting for that one I just seen it
[31:57] right now Perfection God is always
[31:59] perfected in threes amen
[32:01] so you can see how this this these
[32:03] letters are perfect amen they speak to
[32:05] the individual they speak prophetically
[32:07] to the age and they spoke to those
[32:08] individual churches in other words you
[32:10] can't limit God God's word is eternal
[32:12] amen his ways are past finding out
[32:14] Hallelujah
[32:15] amen and the Beautiful part is the next
[32:18] verse Jesus tells you how to return to
[32:19] your first love
[32:21] do your first works
[32:23] so in other words you change some habits
[32:25] you're no longer doing the same things
[32:26] you used to do when you first started
[32:28] serving God
[32:29] and that applies to brother Jesse as
[32:30] well applies to all of us
[32:34] and it shows Church Jesus can have
[32:36] something against us
[32:39] right when we leave our first love when
[32:41] we don't make the word of God or worship
[32:43] or the house of God when we don't make
[32:45] it the best part of our day or the best
[32:47] part of our life we actually leave
[32:49] behind and we actually leave that love
[32:51] behind and we're actually loving
[32:53] something else and now Jesus has has
[32:55] something against us can I say like this
[32:57] the Bible calls it a grievance because
[32:59] you've grieved the Holy Spirit or I've
[33:01] grieved the Holy Spirit now we don't
[33:02] want to let's make this grieving as
[33:04] short as possible praise God
[33:06] Hallelujah but the Bible said grieve not
[33:08] offend not so Jesus gets offended at
[33:11] times when we backslide in our minds
[33:14] I'll say like that
[33:16] and this is a help this is prophetic
[33:18] this lets us know that Jesus knows
[33:20] wherever we are in our journey with him
[33:22] he knows right where we are and he wants
[33:24] us to return and he wants us to get back
[33:26] and he wants us to get our first love
[33:27] back he wants us to love him praise God
[33:30] and your life will never be what it
[33:33] should be until you do love him with all
[33:35] you have
[33:36] I got a text from South Africa yesterday
[33:38] and I couldn't reply but the brother
[33:39] watched my report uh overcoming porn
[33:41] video he's like this was a blessing I've
[33:43] struggled this for years I'm not married
[33:45] and that's the trouble I can't afford a
[33:47] wife and all these things
[33:48] he said well God forgive me he says and
[33:50] can you explain this through the Bible
[33:51] how can God forgive somebody who
[33:53] constantly follows in something like
[33:54] this I said well I don't know I can't
[33:56] say for sure but the Bible said lot
[33:58] vexed his soul by the things he saw and
[34:00] heard yet he was a righteous man
[34:03] now I'm not I'm not saying it's okay to
[34:05] do this I don't even know what he's
[34:06] doing but he just use that word
[34:07] pornography I don't know
[34:09] I'm just saying
[34:11] there can be a real Christian who can
[34:13] have a real problem and if he or she
[34:15] doesn't watch their eyes the gates to
[34:17] their soul think about that the gates of
[34:19] the Soul
[34:21] and they don't stop Evil coming in there
[34:23] the only effect is that they live in
[34:25] torment
[34:27] I said you become uh you become a slave
[34:30] to it you become it's a stronghold as
[34:33] the Bible says it's a complex I said
[34:35] it's just like the house Jesus said if
[34:37] you let that porn in and those devils
[34:39] are going to come in they're going to
[34:40] tie up all your faith all your joy all
[34:42] your love all your victory
[34:44] now you're still you still want to serve
[34:47] God but you can't until you let Jesus in
[34:50] and he kicks all those Devils out praise
[34:51] God
[34:52] Hallelujah is that right
[34:56] amen and I said yes God can forgive you
[34:57] and I said the real thing is to pray
[34:59] until you hate that sin because once you
[35:01] hate it brother you ain't going back to
[35:03] it praise God
[35:05] Hallelujah
[35:06] that's the reality of it
[35:10] that's 30 minutes okay so in every in
[35:13] every complex I've had that's what I've
[35:14] had to pray I'm sure you as well
[35:16] you know it's wrong I know it's wrong
[35:19] but we still do it sometimes
[35:21] so our prayer if we can't get Victory
[35:22] our prayer has to be Lord help me to
[35:24] hate this sin because when you hate
[35:26] something you will not let it hang
[35:28] around
[35:29] I hate the smell of skunks right
[35:32] I ain't gonna let that hang around
[35:34] I hate when uh what's that one book I
[35:38] hate when stink bugs get in the house I
[35:39] can let them hang around
[35:41] you think I'm gonna let something uh
[35:43] that I hate hang around
[35:45] or how about dirty diapers you know Zion
[35:48] was having diapers you know you think
[35:49] we're gonna let something we hate if we
[35:51] hate that church we're going to do
[35:52] something about it praise God oh it's a
[35:55] it's a righteous Indian Nation it's a
[35:57] holy hatred praise God and it's a love
[35:59] for Holiness praise God
[36:02] so that's been that's what I found in my
[36:03] life when I've had complexes or battles
[36:05] or strongholds I've had to pray even
[36:07] through you know days and weeks Lord
[36:09] help me to hate this and once I hate
[36:11] this I know I'll get the victory praise
[36:13] God and that's what I found praise God
[36:15] that's what I'm trusting this brother
[36:16] will find as well again I'm not I'm not
[36:19] saying it's ever right to sin it's never
[36:21] right to sin and I don't know if the
[36:22] brother saved or not but I'm just saying
[36:24] he has a desire to still serve God so
[36:26] there must be something real there
[36:28] says when you no longer have a desire he
[36:31] said then then you won't but as long as
[36:34] there's a desire to do what's right
[36:35] God's still working on you praise God
[36:39] see everybody knows what it's like to
[36:41] leave their first love
[36:44] think about how much you love your car
[36:46] when you first got it or your first cell
[36:47] phone
[36:48] right
[36:49] or your husband or wife
[36:52] right let's be honest right your first
[36:55] love
[36:56] right but then things come in
[36:58] Trials come in the tests of Life come in
[37:00] and what do you do you gotta labor to
[37:02] bring that first love back
[37:04] and I'm not talking about loving your
[37:05] phone anymore I'm talking about your
[37:06] spouse now because we don't want to love
[37:08] our phones and things like that but I'm
[37:10] just saying it's easy example see you
[37:11] think you think such good of something
[37:13] and then it loses its value
[37:16] okay now that's the one example now
[37:19] second one is Smyrna
[37:21] the one we just read Jesus says uh well
[37:24] I'm sorry let me pull it up it's
[37:26] Revelation 2
[37:28] 9 and 10.
[37:31] yeah I guess we did read this already
[37:33] yeah Jesus said I know your Works uh
[37:34] fear none of those things which Thou
[37:36] shalt suffer and I'll give you the Crown
[37:38] of Life okay yeah so this one
[37:41] plainly tells us do not fear suffering
[37:47] Hallelujah so whatever God would allow
[37:50] you to suffer now this is a some this
[37:51] can be a tough one to swallow
[37:53] right especially if God would allow us
[37:55] let's say to lose a loved one thank God
[37:57] he spared us from that I mean real close
[38:00] loved ones
[38:01] but or how about lose ability to walk
[38:03] like brother Mike McCloskey think about
[38:05] that
[38:06] if you lost ability to walk would you
[38:08] still serve God would you suffer with
[38:10] all that pain would you still serve God
[38:12] or would you drown it away in alcohol
[38:15] right so see how I see on this letter it
[38:17] just literally can apply to the
[38:19] individual no matter what you'll suffer
[38:21] don't fear because God is greater than
[38:23] it praise God
[38:25] Jesus is greater than the suffering
[38:26] praise God and there's no way anybody
[38:29] here could suffer any more than Jesus
[38:30] Christ did praise God
[38:32] because he didn't even look like a man
[38:35] he called himself a worm not even not
[38:36] even a man
[38:39] and so that scripture you can see now
[38:41] first love and fear not suffering those
[38:44] can literally apply apply to you and I
[38:46] when we leave our first love and when we
[38:48] suffer it literally applies to your life
[38:50] the individual and we can draw strength
[38:53] I don't have to fear I can cast down
[38:55] fear I can have the spirit of power love
[38:58] and a sound mind praise God
[39:00] that's right
[39:02] third Holy Ghost filled Saints from all
[39:04] ages have benefited
[39:06] from laodicean's warning about
[39:08] lukewarmness
[39:10] and the church said
[39:13] and this warning goes to the it helps us
[39:15] individually because it's a warning to
[39:19] not let ourselves get lukewarm this kind
[39:20] of goes with the first loved one right
[39:22] kind of goes with that
[39:23] and to constantly strive to be on fire
[39:26] for Jesus's sake
[39:28] praise God so this scripture goes right
[39:31] to the heart of the believer like
[39:32] brother Williams talking about those
[39:33] prayer lines where preachers would come
[39:34] up and and talk to the people oh you're
[39:37] lukewarm and oh you know it's your fault
[39:39] you're lukewarming and you know whether
[39:41] those are right or wrong you know that's
[39:42] it's it's it's each situation you gotta
[39:45] look at it individually right
[39:46] if the person was really filled with the
[39:48] Holy Ghost or not you have to look at
[39:49] that individually but all of us can
[39:51] relate to that we feel our desire to
[39:54] serve God cooling down and we just got
[39:56] to add a nice dry log got to put a dry
[39:59] log in that fire and stir that fire up
[40:01] praise God
[40:02] all of us can relate to that
[40:04] that's why Peter and Paul both say You
[40:08] must stir up your minds
[40:11] see you've got to literally challenge
[40:13] your mind get your mind off the things
[40:15] of whatever like technology or world
[40:18] events I guess they could help you some
[40:19] spiritually but whatever is taking your
[40:21] mind away from God you got to uh you got
[40:24] to force your mind to think on the
[40:26] things of God and Stir It Up and mix it
[40:29] up praise God get it moving get your
[40:31] thoughts churning on the word of God
[40:33] you've got to do that nobody else can do
[40:35] that you've got to Stir It Up praise God
[40:39] or else you're going to become lukewarm
[40:41] Stir It Up syrup means to Kindle up
[40:43] inflame one's mind in the Greek
[40:47] okay so pull up second Timothy 1 6.
[40:50] and then we'll go to Second Peter 1 13.
[40:54] the both both these men of God both
[40:56] these prophets now Paul was the major
[40:57] one both these prophets say stir up your
[41:00] minds
[41:02] by way of remembrance
[41:04] wherefore I put thee in remembrance that
[41:06] thou stir up the gift of God which is in
[41:08] thee by the putting on of my hands
[41:09] praise God now this is a good example
[41:11] leave that out there this is a good
[41:12] example I think one time sister Naomi
[41:14] asked about that about having certain
[41:16] services for certain gifts like how
[41:18] brother bran would have services for
[41:20] healing what was he doing he was
[41:23] preaching on an hour or two on the same
[41:25] topic just a new angle he was trying to
[41:27] stir them up God Is A Healer
[41:30] God can do anything this is what a lot
[41:32] of preachers do today which is it's
[41:33] encouraging this is like preaching not
[41:35] really teaching it's trying to stir them
[41:37] up don't you know God helped Israel
[41:39] cross the Red Sea don't you remember how
[41:40] God did that right all these don't you
[41:42] know God was the fourth man in the fire
[41:44] and God will stand with you in your fire
[41:46] you know I mean just these these type of
[41:48] these type of sermons
[41:50] stir you up help you remember that God
[41:53] is faithful God is good and just you've
[41:55] got to stir up there's a gift of God in
[41:57] you there's something in you that
[41:58] believes for Divine Healing amen there's
[42:00] something in you that believes in
[42:01] prophecies like your dream you had this
[42:03] week brother that was prophetic maybe
[42:05] you can share a testimony sometime with
[42:07] the Saints
[42:08] he had a dream and then it actually
[42:09] literally come to pass exactly the way
[42:11] it was
[42:13] Hallelujah Glory
[42:17] and so you got to stir that up in other
[42:19] words God just move me give me a
[42:21] prophecy or give me a dream or or or
[42:23] give me a word of wisdom give me you
[42:25] know God wants you to do that God wants
[42:26] you to draw close the member of the
[42:27] Bible said covet the best gifts amen
[42:30] amen hallelujah God that's the way to
[42:32] get back on fire say God I need a
[42:35] miracle amen hallelujah I need something
[42:37] I need a touch I need something special
[42:39] I need you to move I don't want to be
[42:41] lukewarm I want to be on fire amen
[42:45] moving some new logs praise God move
[42:48] them back get the fire burning get it
[42:50] hot praise God stir your mind up don't
[42:52] remain feeling this way get on fire for
[42:54] God
[42:55] oh hallelujah praise God
[42:59] and for me that's usually the morning
[43:00] that's when I can get stir up my fire
[43:01] praise God I get that time with the Lord
[43:04] the prayer the Bible study the
[43:06] scriptures the meditation that's a great
[43:08] time to stir up your mind for the Lord
[43:11] Jesus Christ
[43:12] Hallelujah
[43:14] uh II Peter 1 13. honey would you get
[43:17] that second Peter 1 13.
[43:20] yeah I think it me as long as I'm in
[43:22] this Tabernacle to stir you up by
[43:23] putting you in remembrance what Jesus
[43:24] say to get your first love remember
[43:26] repent return
[43:28] right very it just goes right along with
[43:30] it second Peter 3 verse one honey
[43:32] chapter 3 verse one
[43:34] see how these can apply literally to our
[43:36] lives it's so beautiful
[43:39] this Second Epistle beloved I now write
[43:41] unto you in both which I stir up your
[43:43] pure Minds by way of uh by way of
[43:47] remembrance now we get a little clue in
[43:48] here if our minds got are going to be
[43:50] stirred up they got to be pure first
[43:53] God can't stir up an impure mind
[43:56] is that right
[43:57] the mind of thinking has to be pure and
[44:01] how does it happen by the transformation
[44:03] of the renewing of your mind amen
[44:06] Hallelujah
[44:08] so there's three ways I just gave you
[44:10] three ways these and of course there's
[44:12] many more these letters apply literally
[44:15] to the individual how many appreciate
[44:16] that by God's grace
[44:17] you can just see it plainly anyone with
[44:19] any Christian honesty or sincerity well
[44:21] yeah sometimes I lead my first love I
[44:24] need I need to overcome fear of the
[44:27] sufferings I go through
[44:28] and I need God to help me be stirred up
[44:30] all the time
[44:31] Hallelujah thank the Lord
[44:34] now
[44:36] also I put this little uh paragraph in
[44:38] here churches today and all throughout
[44:41] the last 2000 years have gone through
[44:43] this Ephesus to kind of lay out to see a
[44:45] cycle because it's kind of like a cycle
[44:47] you leave your first love remember the
[44:49] church ages you leave your first love
[44:51] right uh they lose some the middle of
[44:54] the churches they lose some Revelation
[44:55] and then God brings restoring it back
[44:57] it's kind of like the seasons right it's
[45:00] like the seasons
[45:01] uh maybe fall uh winter and then spring
[45:05] and summer praise God it blossoms out
[45:08] so we can see some Cycles in here
[45:12] and Ephesus really represents the best
[45:14] condition of a church
[45:16] right
[45:18] it has to because that's how the church
[45:20] started
[45:21] the first love
[45:23] praise God so in other words that's why
[45:25] I think brother can preached a series on
[45:27] that you know going back to Ephesus I
[45:28] thought that was a good that was years
[45:29] ago now I could probably find it on
[45:30] YouTube but maybe not
[45:33] but uh that's a desire we always want to
[45:35] go back to absence in other words we
[45:36] always want to go back to our first love
[45:38] that first love that we had that feeling
[45:40] we had to serve God at the beginning
[45:41] praise God oh yeah that's right
[45:44] then and laodicea would be one of the
[45:47] worst
[45:49] right uh just because of the warnings
[45:51] remember Jesus doesn't compliment
[45:53] anything in this church age
[45:56] he just says the ones that really love
[45:58] me will be zealous to repent
[46:00] and they can be hot there's clues in
[46:02] there and they will overcome
[46:04] but he doesn't compliment the whole age
[46:06] because it's just a very cold age
[46:07] there's very few people that really want
[46:10] to love Jesus Christ repent of their
[46:11] sins have Zeal to repent there's very
[46:13] few thank God I'm one of them praise God
[46:15] but now I got to live it I got to repent
[46:17] every day too
[46:18] amen I got to be zealous to repent if
[46:21] not I'm not living the uh the
[46:23] requirement for my church age praise God
[46:26] that's why I Repent every day
[46:27] praise God
[46:29] that's what I've seen created me a clean
[46:30] heart
[46:31] Hallelujah oh God
[46:34] and he does church he does how many can
[46:35] say Amen to that every day God creates
[46:37] in you a clean heart
[46:39] so this is you know the Ephesus to
[46:41] laodicea is a cycle of from from best to
[46:44] probably the worst
[46:45] where Jesus can't even give a compliment
[46:48] remember the Philadelphia Church ate
[46:50] Jesus it was almost all compliments you
[46:51] remember that there was really no rebuke
[46:54] in the Philadelphia Church hey John
[46:56] Wesley do you know he was five foot one
[46:58] who's five foot one in here Lydia what
[47:00] are you
[47:02] stand up 054 okay so John Wesley was the
[47:05] church age messenger and he was probably
[47:06] this tall
[47:09] I read that five foot one and he was
[47:12] stoned on numerous occasions and God
[47:14] would raise him up just like Saint Paul
[47:18] and he preached them to some days he
[47:19] would preach eight times in one day
[47:20] eight sermons you could take a seat but
[47:23] just okay so imagine Little John Wesley
[47:25] in your church
[47:28] Little John Wesley preaching the word of
[47:30] God that's God's star for this age
[47:32] a man full of fire he finished this
[47:35] sermon praise God I'm gonna go preach
[47:36] another down on West Market Street
[47:38] is that right
[47:40] yeah he write it get on his horse hop
[47:41] down there preach sermon number two for
[47:43] the day I think there's a court brother
[47:44] said he was up by six or five a.m every
[47:46] morning preaching
[47:48] because you have to preach six or seven
[47:50] or eight he just spent his all his time
[47:51] riding around preaching now there were
[47:53] some problems in his life he wasn't
[47:54] perfect
[47:55] there were some relationships that he
[47:57] had that were kind of questionable
[47:59] he had a wife but he was never around
[48:00] her then he got kind of close with some
[48:02] Christian sisters and so there were some
[48:03] questions about but as far as we know he
[48:05] he must live holy but there was just
[48:07] some questions about it
[48:09] so I'm just I'm just letting you know
[48:11] because there's you know questions about
[48:12] brother Graham's life
[48:14] he wasn't human well no kidding
[48:17] I'm sorry no he was human I'm sorry no
[48:18] kidding sorry he was human sorry no
[48:21] kidding which one of us aren't human
[48:24] and if I went through all these people's
[48:26] lives that are uh uh if I went through
[48:28] their life like they go through brother
[48:29] random's life what do you think I'd find
[48:31] in their life
[48:32] if I had recordings of all their
[48:34] thoughts and all their words in their
[48:36] home what do you think I'd find oh I
[48:37] think I'd find some Dracula I think I'd
[48:39] find some AC DC like they they already
[48:42] made it on I think I'd find a lot more
[48:43] than that
[48:45] praise God you know this week they put
[48:47] out uh that that attacking side put out
[48:50] a podcast brother William and they said
[48:52] there's more hope for Judas Iscariot
[48:54] than brother Branham
[48:55] can you imagine
[48:57] what what condition would you have to be
[49:00] in to say that and I'm like these guys I
[49:02] almost stopped it but I'm like well I'll
[49:03] finish listening to it what condition
[49:05] are these people in I'm like have you
[49:07] even listened to brother Graham's sermon
[49:08] lately
[49:09] and then I turned brother random on and
[49:11] he's pleading with the people repent
[49:12] like like we heard on Sunday
[49:14] he pleased with them for 34 minutes
[49:16] repent stand up get the Holy Ghost he
[49:18] said oh if you didn't get that time
[49:19] let's try it again is that a man who's
[49:22] trying to sell out the gospel that's a
[49:23] man who's trying to get the gospel into
[49:25] Souls hallelujah amen
[49:28] delusion the Bible's going to be a
[49:30] strong delusion
[49:32] and they'll call God three persons and
[49:35] they'll sprinkle and baptize babies
[49:38] that's what they talked about on the
[49:39] podcast it's okay to do that we
[49:41] shouldn't argue about that we shouldn't
[49:42] let that divide the Church of God I'm
[49:44] I'm just about going crazy you know
[49:47] I just like to listen to it because it
[49:48] makes me aware what they're saying but
[49:50] it also makes me more confident that
[49:52] what we believe is the Bible truth
[49:54] somebody has to receive the finished
[49:56] mystery of God and somebody has to
[49:58] finish uh the Great Commission praise
[50:00] God somebody's got to take it around the
[50:02] world and we're doing our part praise
[50:04] God
[50:04] and I got emails and text approvement
[50:06] amen
[50:07] we're changing the world one believer at
[50:09] a time in our humble little way just
[50:11] like other churches are it's not just us
[50:13] any real church is doing that
[50:17] they're they're preaching and their
[50:19] prayers are going out and it's impacting
[50:21] praise God it's changing lives it's
[50:24] spreading the truth the mystery of God
[50:26] is finished the Revelation is here what
[50:28] you need to defeat Satan is here praise
[50:30] God hallelujah
[50:33] we've been doing it now for all these
[50:35] years amen
[50:36] Hallelujah I'm a witness praise God
[50:39] there can be Overcomers in laodicea
[50:41] praise God Jesus will find faith in me
[50:44] all when he comes to this earth praise
[50:46] God he'll find it in you as well praise
[50:48] God
[50:51] a tree like I told that brother I said a
[50:52] tree is always known by its fruit
[50:55] see but if you to know the fruit you got
[50:57] to go hang around the tree a little bit
[50:58] right that's why I listen to him too
[50:59] brother William I like to hear the
[51:00] fruits I like to I like to know what
[51:02] fruits they're giving out
[51:05] saying Judas Iscariot has more chance
[51:07] than brother Branham these people
[51:10] they you know as all I can say is may
[51:12] God have mercy on them
[51:14] for they don't know what they're doing
[51:16] they don't know what they're saying
[51:19] what about all the people that got
[51:20] healed what about me it transformed my
[51:22] life I know it's right because it's the
[51:24] Bible you 'd be different if I preach it
[51:27] and it didn't happen but I appreciate
[51:28] and it works Hallelujah
[51:31] I preach it and then people get saved
[51:34] they get saved they get filled with the
[51:35] Holy Ghost praise God
[51:37] it has a real impact if you love Jesus
[51:40] and really love Jesus this word has to
[51:42] work praise God
[51:44] it has to take an effect praise God
[51:46] nobody can convince me otherwise I know
[51:49] it's right I know it's real I've seen it
[51:51] living I see it living today I'll
[51:53] continue seeing the gospel continue to
[51:55] live in real Believers because the
[51:57] Angels said go tell in this Temple all
[51:59] the words of this life praise God
[52:02] it is alive Hallelujah
[52:06] we used to sing that song in Sheffield
[52:07] it's the life behind the name that makes
[52:10] the demons tremble it's the life behind
[52:14] the name that makes the proud heart
[52:17] humble it was God who divides the plan
[52:20] that in all things like a man he will
[52:24] live so he could give to us the life
[52:27] behind the name hallelujah praise God
[52:30] Amen
[52:32] it's the life of Jesus Christ that makes
[52:35] a fear Devils Tremble When you pray in
[52:37] the name of the Lord amen Hallelujah
[52:41] they leave
[52:42] because it's the life behind the name of
[52:45] Jesus Christ
[52:46] makes the demons move
[52:49] it's exactly right praise God
[52:53] Hallelujah
[52:56] thank the Lord
[52:58] well I just thought I'd lay that in
[53:00] there and I like when I get a little
[53:01] inspiration there like that I like to
[53:02] like a little fire like that you know by
[53:04] God's grace
[53:05] Hallelujah
[53:09] Let's uh I guess we'll go a little bit
[53:10] further here I got a couple more minutes
[53:12] let me go to I'll go to eight how about
[53:13] I go to eight and then everybody got
[53:14] enough time to pray and they want to
[53:16] pray or need prayer afterwards we can
[53:17] pray and sing we're gonna get chances to
[53:19] sing and Worship the Lord
[53:22] all right now brother random told us and
[53:24] let's get your Bibles here and go to
[53:25] Hebrews 13 7-8 brother amen maybe you
[53:27] can read that Hebrews 13 7-8 the next
[53:30] section is how did Brother Ram choose
[53:32] the star Messengers
[53:35] how did he choose him he told us
[53:38] and I love this brother Ram didn't
[53:40] choose him by his desire he first found
[53:43] the pattern in the word of God
[53:46] he calls this the Keystone in the Bible
[53:48] I mentioned that a few weeks ago the
[53:49] Cornerstone of the Bible is Hebrews 13
[53:52] 7-8 Lord Brother can you read that for
[53:54] us
[54:03] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[54:05] today and forever say praise the Lord
[54:07] Kelly praise now we always just hear
[54:09] verse 8.
[54:11] but if we we can't ignore verse seven
[54:13] because if you look at it in context we
[54:16] know Jesus is the same but what he's
[54:18] what is he the same about healing yes
[54:20] but in context context is actually about
[54:23] God will send a man of God to preach the
[54:26] word of God to help you live the
[54:28] Christian Life
[54:30] they'll speak to you the word of God
[54:33] follow their faith consider the end of
[54:35] their conduct
[54:37] what is the fruit of their life and I
[54:40] hope by God's grace you can see good
[54:42] fruit in my life praise God I trust you
[54:44] do or else you would have left already
[54:45] Hallelujah
[54:47] and this is what is the same about Jesus
[54:50] forever
[54:51] I'm always going to send one man to
[54:53] preach the word of God hallelujah
[54:55] so like he does it one man to a church
[54:57] right of course one man to the age and
[54:59] then out of that messenger comes all
[55:01] these other men to their individual
[55:03] churches praise God
[55:06] but this is how brother Branham
[55:09] chose the Seven Stars as he would read
[55:12] through history remember they were way
[55:13] different Larkin didn't even choose
[55:14] Messengers but brother braham's choices
[55:16] were way different than Charles Taze
[55:18] Russell
[55:19] if I'm not mistaken Uriah Smith I don't
[55:21] think he chose Messengers either no he
[55:24] didn't he didn't because I studied him
[55:25] recently I still want to make some
[55:26] videos on on him but I've kind of been
[55:28] slow on videos it's been a kind of a
[55:30] difficult first or last few weeks of
[55:32] work here we're getting
[55:34] some
[55:35] sad things happening on the in the
[55:37] classroom but we'll make it by God's
[55:38] grace thank you brother amen
[55:40] so brother says
[55:42] God and his ways are unchanging
[55:46] so if you know God is the same and he
[55:48] never changes then you you'll always be
[55:50] able to find all the reading history or
[55:52] even today you'll always be able to find
[55:54] who's the man of God because he'll be
[55:56] most like Jesus Christ
[55:58] he'll be most like Saint Paul
[56:01] praise God
[56:02] if you follow their faith then you'll
[56:06] see God work very similar in your life
[56:08] too praise God
[56:10] thank God Amen
[56:12] it's also Ecclesiastes 3 14 and 15.
[56:15] uh
[56:17] I know that whatsoever God doeth it
[56:19] shall be forever
[56:21] nothing can be put to it nor anything
[56:23] taken from it and God doeth it that men
[56:25] should fear before him that which hath
[56:28] Ben is now and that which is to be hath
[56:31] already been
[56:33] which is to be hath already been and God
[56:35] required that which is past so God
[56:38] requires this church to be just like the
[56:40] book of Acts Church
[56:41] right Malachi 3 Verse 6 says for I am
[56:44] the Lord and I change not
[56:47] so program chose the Stars by looking at
[56:50] all the history and which seeing which
[56:52] preacher was most like Jesus Christ
[56:55] which preacher was most like Saint Paul
[56:58] Hallelujah
[57:00] so God always has and always will choose
[57:03] one man
[57:05] to lead and influence the rest of the
[57:07] church age after God has revealed his
[57:10] word there's one major leader who
[57:13] teaches all the other local leaders
[57:16] uh read second okay put up second
[57:18] Timothy one I'm sorry II Timothy two one
[57:21] and two second Timothy two one and two
[57:23] thou thou therefore my son be strong in
[57:26] the grace that is in Christ Jesus and
[57:29] the things that thou has heard of me
[57:30] among many witnesses the same commit
[57:33] thou to who Faithful Men Who Shall be
[57:36] able to what teach others also
[57:39] Paul said whatever you've seen in my
[57:41] life whatever you've seen that's holy or
[57:43] the word I taught you teach it to other
[57:45] men that they might be faithful with it
[57:47] because God's going to use them when I'm
[57:49] gone God's going to use them to go
[57:51] minister to other people praise God
[57:54] Hallelujah I think how many people have
[57:56] we ministered to through YouTube how
[57:58] many people have we ministered just in
[57:59] the local Akron Ministry
[58:02] member Church there was no church here
[58:04] before brother Tim and I got here
[58:06] there's no church here
[58:08] right the word of God wasn't here the
[58:10] message wasn't here
[58:12] but thank God Hallelujah God sent us
[58:14] over here and now the message has come
[58:17] to the city of Akron praise God the
[58:20] truth has come there is a lighthouse
[58:22] praise God there are witnesses uh real
[58:24] Witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus
[58:26] Christ and the restoration of the Bride
[58:29] tree praise God
[58:30] Hallelujah
[58:32] in other words the the bride that she
[58:34] was at the beginning is the bride she'll
[58:36] be at the end praise God oh Hallelujah
[58:39] and how does he do it by one man one man
[58:42] to the age
[58:44] whether it's a hundred years 220 150 200
[58:47] 300 you choose one man to sound to give
[58:50] the main Revelation and then he teaches
[58:52] others and gives it out to the rest of
[58:53] the people
[58:55] and that man is the star in Jesus's nail
[58:59] scarred hand as I told you tonight
[59:00] they're not always big men brother man
[59:02] was a small man what was he 5'4
[59:05] I think it was five five program was a
[59:07] short man John Wesley 5-1
[59:10] these weren't like Great Men by Society
[59:14] they were they were they were not uh oh
[59:16] handsome or they're the wealthiest or
[59:18] anything like that they were men that
[59:20] had a burden for the word of God there
[59:23] are men that were on fire for the
[59:25] preaching and the healing power and the
[59:27] resurrection power of Jesus Christ
[59:28] praise God
[59:31] and you look at their life and line it
[59:32] up next to Paul line up to Jesus who is
[59:35] closest that has to be the messenger to
[59:37] the age
[59:40] God has always done one
[59:43] in the Old Testament you had Seth
[59:44] leading the way
[59:45] Cain killed Abel so God raised up a man
[59:48] Seth
[59:49] he come along he he was laboring there
[59:52] until Enoch came
[59:54] and then when Enoch left the scene God
[59:55] raised up and Noah praise God hallelujah
[59:59] God raised up but Noah a preacher of
[1:00:02] righteousness Hallelujah
[1:00:04] now though they'll call us legalists but
[1:00:06] really we're righteousness
[1:00:09] right
[1:00:10] we're not adding to the word of God we
[1:00:12] are I'm a preacher of righteousness
[1:00:14] we're Believers in righteousness
[1:00:17] Hallelujah and then Noah influenced his
[1:00:21] age right after him came Abraham Moses
[1:00:25] Joshua so many others you got David
[1:00:27] Solomon
[1:00:28] I'm sorry I'm sorry before that you had
[1:00:30] Anthony all these judges praise God uh
[1:00:33] jeffna down to Samson and then God
[1:00:36] raised up a Samuel A David a Solomon
[1:00:39] praise God all the kings praise God and
[1:00:41] the Bible said while that godly man was
[1:00:43] there they'd experienced Revival
[1:00:45] all the idols will be driven up church I
[1:00:48] believe today by God's grace we don't
[1:00:49] have to have any Idols in our life we
[1:00:51] can be free from Idols we can have one
[1:00:53] objects in Worship the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:55] praise God
[1:00:56] and if we got that then we've got
[1:00:58] Revival I don't care what anybody says
[1:01:00] hallelujah because there's many times to
[1:01:02] Revival praise God I've got the church
[1:01:04] age Revival the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:07] Ghost praise God
[1:01:08] still going on after all these years
[1:01:10] amen still going on when the items are
[1:01:13] torn down you've got Revival sister
[1:01:15] praise God
[1:01:16] Hallelujah
[1:01:19] what'd John say
[1:01:22] dearly beloved keep yourself from idols
[1:01:25] don't let anything
[1:01:27] become more important than loving the
[1:01:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:31] don't Place anything is that deserving
[1:01:34] more of your time more of your affection
[1:01:37] more of your attention
[1:01:39] don't let anything
[1:01:41] have the place that Jesus has in your
[1:01:43] life
[1:01:46] God always has one man
[1:01:49] think of all the kings down there oh my
[1:01:51] Josiah
[1:01:52] these Kings of great revivals Uzziah at
[1:01:55] least at the beginning
[1:01:56] Hezekiah we looked at that on Sunday
[1:01:58] wasn't that beautiful on Sunday praise
[1:01:59] God not because I said it because the
[1:02:01] Bible says it
[1:02:02] he laid his request before God
[1:02:06] same thing happened in the New Testament
[1:02:08] each messenger came on the scene
[1:02:11] at the beginning of the church age with
[1:02:13] the purpose of bringing Revival to the
[1:02:14] people
[1:02:16] and then in the later Church ages
[1:02:17] Philadelphia
[1:02:19] I'm sorry Sardis Philadelphia God brings
[1:02:23] restoration to the church

[1:02:35] the grace of the Lord
[1:02:38] so what does that mean Jesus Christ is
[1:02:40] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:02:44] praise God
[1:02:47] Church let's make sure tonight there's
[1:02:48] no Idols in our heart
[1:02:52] let's make sure if our minds are not on
[1:02:54] fire let's stir them up tonight praise
[1:02:56] God
[1:02:57] I found just takes a little a little
[1:02:59] prayer meeting a little talk with Jesus
[1:03:01] makes everything all right that song is
[1:03:02] it's so primitive but it's so true
[1:03:05] a little talk with Jesus say Lord help
[1:03:08] me to hate this
[1:03:09] or help me to despise this
[1:03:12] like I told you one brother in the Lord
[1:03:13] told me he was about a certain sin
[1:03:16] and he said he said Lord I I feel like
[1:03:18] help us against this sin
[1:03:20] he said Lord make me so busy so I forget
[1:03:23] about it and he said his work picked up
[1:03:25] he was working so much people
[1:03:27] volunteered him for jobs he couldn't
[1:03:29] turn down
[1:03:30] and he said Thank You Lord I'm so busy
[1:03:32] now I don't have time to fall to this
[1:03:34] certain sin
[1:03:36] I thought what a beautiful prayer it's
[1:03:38] kind of like Lord test me if there's
[1:03:40] anything wrong in my life test me now
[1:03:41] you're asking for trials right
[1:03:42] he's asking
[1:03:44] for hardships he's asking for a harder
[1:03:47] life and church I think that's very
[1:03:48] commendable
[1:03:49] Lord do whatever you need to do to take
[1:03:52] sin out of my heart
[1:03:54] any Idol that I've allowed in my life
[1:03:56] break it down
[1:03:59] please don't let me bow to the idol of
[1:04:02] fame or the idol of greed or the idol of
[1:04:04] lust right all these things I I I know I
[1:04:07] know I say those every week right every
[1:04:09] week I say those fear and anger and
[1:04:12] wrath and bitterness I see him every
[1:04:13] week
[1:04:14] but it's true if we're not careful we'll
[1:04:17] bow down to bitterness we'll worship
[1:04:20] that
[1:04:21] that will become the prime motivation of
[1:04:24] our life
[1:04:27] but may the motivation of our life be
[1:04:29] the grace of Jesus Christ
[1:04:31] God's grace in our lives
[1:04:34] aren't you glad you're being a church
[1:04:35] tonight by God's grace
[1:04:37] Hallelujah you know I thought like I
[1:04:38] said I thought we'd have some visitors
[1:04:39] and maybe go over some of the
[1:04:41] foundational things but this is very
[1:04:43] important as well how many can say Amen
[1:04:44] to that

[1:04:55] same like I love that song he's saying

[1:05:10] me we don't have to do that
[1:05:11] we can leave here knowing Jesus and sin
