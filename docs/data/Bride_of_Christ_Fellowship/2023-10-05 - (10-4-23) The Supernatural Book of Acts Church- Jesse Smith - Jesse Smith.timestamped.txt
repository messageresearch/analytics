[2:12] amen God bless you as you're being
[2:13] seated praise
[2:16] God okay so I set the timer there I'm
[2:19] not going to forget here tonight I know
[2:20] it's a school night but I also want to
[2:22] get in the Holy Spirit praise God by
[2:23] God's
[2:24] grace so I want to look at the
[2:26] supernatural book of Acts church I was
[2:29] also studying I I was telling you I kind
[2:30] of want to preach a lot on uh brother
[2:32] brandom's Ministry because I haven't i'
[2:34] I've been led to preach on the the
[2:37] teachings of brother brandom not so much
[2:39] on the life story of it there's and
[2:42] there's a purpose behind that uh because
[2:44] we know I I we know we don't want to go
[2:47] too far on Stories We want to stay right
[2:49] in the middle of the road praise God we
[2:50] want to preach the word and yes we want
[2:52] to know about brother Ram's life uh but
[2:54] we know I know I don't know about you
[2:56] but I know of too many churches that go
[2:57] too much on stories and they don't get
[2:59] enough word of God in them so I've I've
[3:02] sought to try to find the balance uh but
[3:04] today in the last few weeks I've been
[3:06] studying on um that book generation
[3:09] brother bram's granddaughter wrote that
[3:10] book with the help of you know numerous
[3:13] Witnesses but maybe next Wednesday I'll
[3:14] start that series I want to start a
[3:16] series on uh a supernatural generation
[3:19] and I want I want to read some of those
[3:20] uh testimonies we can play the audio
[3:23] numerous of those people in those books
[3:25] their their testimonies are right on
[3:26] tape for example brother wayy died right
[3:29] in the the church and then he was raised
[3:31] up by by the prayer from brother brandom
[3:33] and the Saints there in 1963 it's just a
[3:36] tremendous testimony there um so and
[3:39] then you know the there's numerous
[3:40] people that were there when the pillar
[3:42] of fire uh came on the back wall it was
[3:44] the back left wall if you're at the
[3:46] platform it was the back left wall of
[3:48] the church so for us for you guys it be
[3:50] the back right wall um numerous people
[3:52] were there saw it it's on tape you can
[3:55] hear the people screaming and shouting
[3:56] and and worshiping uh so many
[3:59] Supernatural things happen I'd like to
[4:00] share some of those stories I believe
[4:02] that will build your faith as well
[4:03] praise God I find myself the more I read
[4:05] that the more I think about supernatural
[4:07] things is God moving here is God moving
[4:09] there where where is God moving we want
[4:11] to be right in position when God wants
[4:13] to move praise God so I just thought I'd
[4:16] start these uh series here and let's
[4:18] start with the supernatural uh book of
[4:20] Acts Church you know we're going to
[4:22] start in Acts chapter
[4:24] 2 and you know in Acts chapter 1 Jesus
[4:26] Promised the power in verse 8 he said ye
[4:28] shall receive the power power after that
[4:31] the the after that the Holy Ghost is
[4:33] come upon you and you shall be Witnesses
[4:35] unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea
[4:37] and Samaria and unto the uttermost part
[4:40] of the earth Hallelujah so according to
[4:42] Jesus the Holy Ghost gives power for
[4:44] gifts power for Supernatural but also
[4:47] power to be a testimony to be a witness
[4:50] no matter where you live right whether
[4:51] it's in the United States or whether
[4:52] it's India or Africa or Australia
[4:55] wherever you live you have power to be a
[4:57] witness praise God you can live the
[4:59] message wherever you go right people
[5:01] will know he's different she's different
[5:03] they're living a different life because
[5:04] they have the power of God in them and
[5:07] church I believe as brother R said from
[5:08] time to time God will show Supernatural
[5:10] power in your life power to heal your
[5:12] sicknesses amen power to foretell the
[5:15] future power to discern Spirits
[5:17] Hallelujah all the power of the nine
[5:19] gifts of the Holy Spirit and I like what
[5:21] brother BR said you know the book is
[5:22] called um The Acts of the Apostles but
[5:25] brother said it's the acts of the Holy
[5:27] Ghost in the apostles how many how many
[5:29] of us know that that we have no acts of
[5:31] ourselves worth writing about right if
[5:33] you had the acts of Jesse or the acts of
[5:35] Lydia or whoever they wouldn't be worth
[5:37] writing but if the acts of the Holy
[5:39] Spirit In Our Lives then it's worth
[5:41] something worth writing praise God it's
[5:43] something worth remembering hallelujah
[5:45] it's something worth telling the story
[5:47] about praise God when God comes and does
[5:49] an act in our lives praise God now
[5:53] remember Church they were assembled
[5:55] together for fear after Jesus
[5:57] crucifixion John 12 I'm sorry John 20:
[6:00] 19 then the same day at evening being
[6:03] the first day of the week when the doors
[6:05] were shut where the disciples were
[6:06] assembled for fear of the Jews came
[6:08] Jesus and stood in the midst and saith
[6:10] unto them peace be unto you now we don't
[6:12] know how long this fear lasted right but
[6:16] we know over the next uh we over the
[6:18] next 50 days you know Jesus would uh
[6:21] would show himself to them I'm sorry for
[6:23] 40 days right he'd show himself to them
[6:26] uh and We Know by the last 10 days the
[6:28] last 10 days out of those 50 days
[6:30] 120 people gathered up into a room and
[6:33] we're not told of any stirring or
[6:34] anything like that there was no real
[6:35] move of the Holy Spirit imagine waiting
[6:37] for 10 days waiting for the Holy Spirit
[6:40] to move now that encourages me because
[6:43] we can wait as long as God wants us to
[6:44] wait praise God we got to obey the word
[6:47] stay in prayer stay in worship stay in
[6:49] the word and wait for God to move how
[6:51] many content to wait on God hallelujah
[6:53] they had to wait on God and God finally
[6:56] moved praise God but none of that time
[6:58] was wasted the Bible said they were in
[6:59] one place in one Accord they were
[7:01] praying no doubt they were having
[7:03] Fellowship praise God hallelujah there's
[7:05] no time wasted if you're in the timeline
[7:07] of God hallelujah your life's not wasted
[7:09] the years aren't wasted right the only
[7:12] wasted time is Wasted Years in
[7:14] sin right but even those can be redeemed
[7:17] praise God hallelujah remember six
[7:19] months of ministry John the Baptist was
[7:21] greater than all the years that Abraham
[7:23] served God because no man was born
[7:26] greater than John the Baptist six months
[7:29] now that's quite a thing to say 6 months
[7:31] is greater than 175 years of Abraham
[7:33] that's what Jesus said so how many
[7:35] believe Jesus CU it's the qu it's the
[7:38] quality rather than the quantity as
[7:40] we've said many times but notice they
[7:42] were assembled together for fear but as
[7:44] they as they stayed together in
[7:46] Fellowship the fear faded away and Faith
[7:49] started prevailing Hallelujah brother R
[7:51] tells us now brother R dramatizes and he
[7:54] says you know he said maybe about three
[7:56] or four days in you know James and John
[7:58] they looked at to each other and said
[7:59] well we think we got it we should go
[8:01] preach right now right but brother R
[8:03] said Peter would come up and say no
[8:05] let's wait Jesus said there's got to be
[8:07] power we got to have a supernatural
[8:09] power and yes we have maybe H happiness
[8:12] or fellowship or whatever but we need
[8:14] some power right so no doubt there was
[8:17] questions amongst the group but when God
[8:19] came there was no more question amen
[8:22] church that's how it is for your life
[8:23] that's how is for my life when God comes
[8:25] on the scene nobody wonders about it
[8:27] praise God because God vindicates his
[8:30] word right and it's as simple as even
[8:33] the uh the unic who's reading his Bible
[8:35] right who you know who is this about you
[8:37] know Isaiah 53 who is this servant and
[8:40] then God sends Phillip and he says do
[8:42] you know who you're reading about no but
[8:44] I want to know can you tell me who this
[8:46] is so it's as simple as God answering
[8:48] your questions praise God that reveals
[8:52] God's presence in your life Hallelujah
[8:54] and how many know his presence has been
[8:55] with you all day praise God all day it
[8:58] never leaves you he never forsakes you
[9:01] but at some point the fear starts to
[9:04] leave and so I encourage us no matter
[9:07] you know I know I often I shouldn't say
[9:08] often but sometimes I battle fear about
[9:10] you know the squeeze and uh who wouldn't
[9:12] right everybody's human right uh but you
[9:15] know we we got to be encouraged no
[9:17] matter what we battle God is going to
[9:18] bring us into the condition where faith
[9:21] is our supreme power amen right because
[9:23] we'll have the Supreme faith for the
[9:25] Supreme hour Hallelujah and so here the
[9:28] church had fear but God moved them to
[9:31] Faith over the course of 50 days oh my a
[9:34] lot can happen in a month and a half and
[9:36] the church said a lot can happen right
[9:39] look at Sarah's life a lot could happen
[9:40] in one year right nine months she
[9:44] there's no way she laughs at God she
[9:45] lies to God's face and within a year
[9:48] she's holding Isaac hallelujah oh my and
[9:51] laughing God made her to laugh God made
[9:53] her to believe the promise of God
[9:55] hallelujah a lot can happen in a short
[9:57] time like we saw with Samson these last
[9:58] few services
[10:00] now in the church age book brother BR
[10:01] says remember this Christ in the true
[10:04] true church is a continuation of the
[10:07] book of
[10:08] Acts all right so that's why I said
[10:10] earlier you and I are continuing the
[10:12] book of Acts it's not a separate book
[10:14] it's a continuation but this book isn't
[10:16] written on paper this book is written in
[10:18] heaven amen hallelujah think about that
[10:20] brother Ram's life would be in the book
[10:22] of Acts but so would
[10:24] yours hallelujah our humble little life
[10:27] right we'd be one of those small little
[10:29] uh small little churches there in the
[10:30] book of Acts we'd be one of those small
[10:32] churches that Paul went and visited him
[10:34] and Barnabas and then and then you know
[10:36] uh him and Mark and they make little
[10:38] trips and they go around strengthening
[10:40] the CH the churches right because that's
[10:42] what Paul said we started churches let's
[10:43] go see how the Brethren are doing oh I
[10:46] like that don't you like when I love
[10:48] that like last time uh who was here
[10:50] brother Diggs or somebody yeah brother
[10:52] Diggs last time he was here he said I
[10:55] just want to tell you uh you all have a
[10:57] great uh worship service because you
[10:58] really worship God and you really pull
[11:00] on the word that's like a that's like a
[11:03] report coming from a man who travels
[11:05] around the world and gives us a good
[11:07] report amen we're not a backlin and
[11:10] lukewarm Church we're a church that
[11:11] loves Jesus amen we're a church that
[11:13] loves to worship and even with a small
[11:15] group you can feel the presence of God
[11:17] that people love God and they want more
[11:19] of God praise God like brother R said
[11:22] you give people a choir and then they
[11:23] stop singing right right sing for me no
[11:27] you're the choir I'm the choir
[11:29] hallelujah amen I there's nothing wrong
[11:32] with the choir but I'm saying you know
[11:33] if you let that come up come up if you
[11:35] make that too much of a thing if if we
[11:37] make song specials too much then the
[11:39] people don't have a song right we got to
[11:42] have let the people have a song
[11:43] everybody's supposed to have a part in
[11:45] this worship Hallelujah
[11:48] everybody now brother said the
[11:50] Antichrist spirit is is is shown in the
[11:52] Book of Revelation that it would come
[11:55] and defile the church making it lukewarm
[11:57] formal and Powerless
[11:59] that's what the Antichrist does he said
[12:02] Revelation exposes Satan revealing his
[12:06] Works he said uh Satan fights it he
[12:09] cannot stand it he knows if the people
[12:12] get the true revelation of the true
[12:14] church and what she is and what she
[12:17] stands for and that she can do the
[12:19] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[12:21] Army that's a beautiful quote hallah
[12:23] it's one we've heard many times over the
[12:25] years but it's true Satan hates the Book
[12:27] of Revelation I'll say like this no
[12:29] doubt he hates the book of Acts too
[12:31] right he doesn't like the book of Acts
[12:34] because it shows what The Church Must Be
[12:36] brother Ram said Common Sense tells you
[12:38] the book of Acts is the church in action
[12:41] and our action should be like the book
[12:42] of Acts amen hallelujah absolutely right
[12:46] and so church we that's what we do we
[12:48] get a true revelation of the word and it
[12:50] helps us withstand evil spirits in our
[12:53] lives
[12:55] hallelujah thank God church God has
[12:57] blessed us with the ministry I I can't
[12:59] remember the last time we had a a
[13:00] minister in and we felt like a demon
[13:02] power was trying to get into the church
[13:04] right I can't remember last time God has
[13:05] really blessed
[13:06] us right but brother Brooks told me in
[13:08] over in Lima when we were going there he
[13:11] said a brother came in and he tried to
[13:13] quench the Holy Spirit and said we get
[13:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[13:17] sensation and it cooled the church down
[13:19] it was the Antichrist trying to get into
[13:22] the church but I like brother Brooks he
[13:23] withstood that spirit amen and that's
[13:26] why he preached so much on worshiping
[13:28] and raise your hand hands and you know
[13:29] that's what the church battled the
[13:31] Antichrist tried to cool them down but
[13:33] the Holy Ghost will trying to stir you
[13:34] up praise God is that
[13:37] right see the Antichrist makes you weak
[13:40] powerless uh trapped in sin but God
[13:44] makes you hate sin praise God God makes
[13:47] you love the word of God God makes you
[13:49] hungry for the Holy Spirit praise God
[13:52] hallelujah I can understand why brother
[13:54] Brooks did that because that's what his
[13:56] church was value and the brother turned
[13:58] out he's already left the message that's
[14:00] right I forgot about that he already put
[14:02] a big video out there and he just
[14:04] misunderstood all brother Ram's uh
[14:06] situations but the Holy Ghost reveals it
[14:09] to us praise God why because we know
[14:11] brother Ram pointed us to the Bible amen
[14:14] hallelujah and the brother forgot to
[14:16] read the rest of the quote brother R
[14:18] said it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:19] without sensation but it's Christ in you
[14:22] performing the same works that Christ
[14:24] diden now that's the Holy Ghost we need
[14:26] amen hallelujah
[14:30] see brother ra is saying he means
[14:31] without you have to speak in tongues
[14:33] that's what he's saying you don't have
[14:35] to have the same sensation but you got
[14:37] to have the same Life of Christ we want
[14:39] the works of Christ we want the power of
[14:41] Christ the testimony of Christ we want
[14:44] Jesus amen remember the leyan church
[14:48] will lock Jesus out and Jesus is
[14:50] knocking saying can I get in the service
[14:52] Church May the door be open today so
[14:54] Jesus comes into this service praise God
[14:57] is that right we can't get weak and
[15:00] lukewarm and cool off we got to stay hot
[15:02] for Jesus amen hallelujah amen glory
[15:06] amen amen but said we'll be an
[15:09] invincible Army now I said there's a
[15:10] balance to this the entire Church of
[15:13] Christ will always be Invincible
[15:15] Army but what he means is each
[15:17] generation has a choice will either be
[15:19] Invincible or will become lukewarm but I
[15:22] got news for the devil right we we've
[15:24] all we've all shown him with our lives
[15:26] we will be Invincible by the power of
[15:28] God amen hallelujah amen it doesn't mean
[15:32] we we does that doesn't mean we uh we
[15:34] never sin it doesn't mean we never
[15:35] struggle but the in other words the
[15:37] message will keep living on in our lives
[15:40] amen we will not denominate we not let
[15:43] the Antichrist spirit in here we'll let
[15:45] the Holy Spirit have free
[15:47] course amen
[15:51] hallelujah he says if they can get a
[15:54] true Revelation and by God's spirit
[15:56] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[15:58] Spirit Satan will be powerless before he
[16:01] will be as definitely thwarted today as
[16:03] when Christ with stood his every effort
[16:05] I'm sorry every effort to gain power
[16:07] over him in the desert yes Satan hates
[16:09] Revelation but we love it I'm G to say
[16:12] it again we love
[16:15] Revelation oh you never heard a sermon
[16:17] like that before and God will send
[16:18] somebody in here or your pastor whoever
[16:20] and you'll hear something oh I never
[16:22] seen it like that before it's God's
[16:24] revelation to us we love moments like
[16:27] that amen
[16:30] Hallelujah we love it with true
[16:33] Revelation Our Lives the Gates of Hell
[16:36] cannot Prevail against us but we will
[16:38] prevail over them
[16:40] Samson Hallelujah that's right brother
[16:44] said the true church will always try to
[16:47] be like it was in the book of Acts
[16:49] that's exactly right will always try to
[16:53] power in our lives well what if
[16:54] somebody's sick what would they do in
[16:55] the book of Acts lay hands on
[16:57] them right
[16:59] that's what they would do pray for them
[17:00] if somebody's arrested what would they
[17:02] do start a prayer chain that's something
[17:03] we got to do praise God hallelujah right
[17:06] we got to be if somebody doesn't have
[17:08] food we got to feed them Hallelujah no
[17:11] matter whatever they did in the book of
[17:13] Acts that's what we got to do praise
[17:15] Goden look to the book of Acts and try
[17:17] notice he says try to be like that is
[17:19] any church perfect no was even the book
[17:22] of Acts Church perfect no they weren't
[17:24] perfect but they had the power of God
[17:26] there amen they were the alpha Church
[17:28] and brother is trying to say when Jesus
[17:30] comes down as The Headstone as he uses
[17:32] this illustration all the time when this
[17:34] this uh when this uh pyramid comes down
[17:37] it has to match perfectly the the the
[17:39] top of the Earthly pyramid and so so he
[17:42] says the ministry of Jesus has to look
[17:44] just like the book of Acts church at the
[17:46] end time our ministry has to look just
[17:49] like Jesus's Ministry and Jesus said I
[17:52] always do that which pleased the Father
[17:54] and Jesus said I only do what the father
[17:56] shows me praise God Amen I want to
[17:58] preach a sermon on that I had that idea
[17:59] this week I want to preach a sermon on I
[18:01] only do what the father shows me see
[18:04] because we got to rely in other words
[18:05] it's he's either going to show you in
[18:06] the word or show it to you by memory or
[18:09] show it to you by some sermon or
[18:11] something right we only do what the
[18:13] father shows us praise God
[18:16] Amen oh it's beautiful see we've got to
[18:20] try to always be like the book of Acts
[18:24] Church brother said denominations he
[18:27] said they try to prove they have it all
[18:29] or they have enough he said yet is that
[18:31] the truth compare this 20th century
[18:34] Church to the first church go ahead do
[18:37] that where's the power he said where's
[18:40] the
[18:42] love where is the purified church that
[18:45] withstood sin and walk with faith
[18:47] towards Jesus where is the Unity how
[18:50] many questions is this one two
[18:53] three four he said where's the purified
[18:56] church that withstood sin and walk with
[18:58] faith toward Jesus where is the
[19:00] unity you can't find it now I would say
[19:03] we can find it praise God we got love we
[19:06] got Unity we got power at times right
[19:10] but God never told us how often he'd
[19:11] heal God doesn't heal all the time God
[19:13] doesn't heal every time praise God he
[19:16] said if if this church today has all it
[19:19] needs why were they crying out for more
[19:21] of God in the book of Acts that was Acts
[19:23] chapter 4 I read it a few Wednesdays ago
[19:25] it might have been last Wednesday I
[19:26] can't remember why were they crying out
[19:29] for more of God as though they didn't
[19:32] have it all and yet they had far more
[19:34] than what the churches have today what a
[19:38] question if this church if the if if
[19:41] we're the greatest Christians of all
[19:43] time which I never said we were that's
[19:46] what they
[19:47] say if that's true why aren't they
[19:49] crying out for more of God hallelujah
[19:51] why aren't they feeding the sick
[19:53] Hallelujah right sorry why aren they uh
[19:56] uh feeding the poor right why aren't
[19:59] they getting locked up in jail and see
[20:01] I'm not being locked up either I'm just
[20:02] saying I'm not but I'm not the one
[20:04] calling myself the greatest of all time
[20:06] they're the ones calling themselves the
[20:07] greatest of all time see but this ought
[20:11] to make us a h give us a great reminder
[20:13] that we need to constantly ask God for
[20:16] more of God's word more of his Spirit we
[20:18] got to be hungry for more of God
[20:20] hallelujah and like I said it don't take
[20:22] an hour and a half sermon brother
[20:25] Jesse thought I'd get a few more amens
[20:27] on that one no it's okay Peter preached
[20:30] for five minutes and the Holy Ghost fell
[20:32] cornelius's house amen it don't take a
[20:35] long time Hallelujah and I'll tell you
[20:37] I'm content if I see the spirit of God
[20:39] fall and I can't preach anymore we'll
[20:41] close up and we'll worship amen we'll
[20:44] just worship till you run out of steam
[20:45] amen I can hear I can hear it when your
[20:47] celebr starts running out of steam I can
[20:49] hear
[20:50] it I can I get some of those medes I can
[20:53] by the third song fourth song I can all
[20:55] right we better stop this and give them
[20:57] a chance to cool down
[20:58] but sometimes it just keeps going right
[21:01] if it's a remember the Napoleon service
[21:03] remember uh three years ago when Cam and
[21:05] brother Brooks were here that was that
[21:06] was a another four or five hour service
[21:08] there if I'm not mistaken I could go
[21:09] look it up it just went from one song to
[21:11] the next the hearts are on fire the
[21:14] minds are all Ablaze Hallelujah the
[21:16] sincerity is returned amen we recognize
[21:19] the presence of Christ hallelujah amen
[21:22] Revelation has struck us
[21:23] amen and that was a service when Emma
[21:26] felt the wind of the Holy Spirit come to
[21:27] the church
[21:28] now somebody else felt it was it you
[21:29] sister who somebody else once yeah once
[21:34] uh people have heard angels in here
[21:37] hallelujah you know it's supernatural
[21:40] there are angels here praise God he
[21:42] camps around you because you fear God
[21:45] hallelujah amen these were men of
[21:48] sacrifice or women of sacrifice as
[21:51] well
[21:53] Hallelujah now the Bible said they
[21:56] Hazard their lives for for the name of
[21:58] Jesus Christ would you put that up
[21:59] therea it's acts
[22:02] 15:26 men that have hazarded their lives
[22:06] for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[22:08] now with all due respect there have been
[22:09] some message preachers that have got
[22:11] arrested right and I that that's a real
[22:14] sign of service towards God when you're
[22:16] willing to get arrested for the Gospel
[22:17] of Jesus Christ but there's more than
[22:20] just that they didn't die they got out
[22:22] of jail most of them but the disciples
[22:25] and the apostles they didn't get all out
[22:27] of jail
[22:29] and the ones I know of the message they
[22:30] never got
[22:31] beaten but the apostles got beaten they
[22:34] got whipped 39 times that's just on one
[22:37] whipping right remember Paul had that
[22:39] was it five times or three times Thrice
[22:41] I think it was Thrice Thrice
[22:43] yeah and remember His you know we're not
[22:46] going to go through his resume but I
[22:47] went through that when William was here
[22:48] I remember vividly when he's like oh we
[22:50] just did a bible study on that over the
[22:52] zoom call and you came and preach at
[22:53] that that next service so I remember
[22:55] that uh that was a red letter Day by
[22:57] God's grace just given the Vindication
[23:00] but Paul had all those sufferings and he
[23:02] said am I not an apostle who's really
[23:05] suffered for the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[23:07] that's who the true Servants of God are
[23:09] praise God Amen
[23:11] Hallelujah so we need to cry out for
[23:14] more of God remember we're a
[23:16] continuation in the book of Acts and cry
[23:18] out for more
[23:20] revelation we need more Revelation
[23:22] because that's what will overcome the
[23:24] Gates of
[23:25] Hell hallelujah it's exactly right
[23:28] right and we always have to try to be
[23:31] like the book of Acts how many want to
[23:33] be like the book of Acts amen go to Acts
[23:35] 2 43 case would you pull that up there
[23:38] acts
[23:45] 243 the Bible said and fear Came Upon
[23:48] every soul and many signs and wonders
[23:50] were done by the apostles when their
[23:52] 3,000 were saved and they went from
[23:55] house to house fear Came Upon on the
[23:58] people that's respect for
[24:00] God that's this idea I'm watching
[24:03] everything I say and do all day because
[24:05] I know God's
[24:06] around right the fear of God so the
[24:10] early church had a fear of God
[24:11] everything they said everything they did
[24:14] it was important because they knew they
[24:15] wanted to please Jesus hallelujah
[24:19] amen now Church you know as far as
[24:23] numbers you know I I don't know if the
[24:25] Rapture will be like the 3,000 that g
[24:27] that God saved on the day of Pentecost I
[24:28] don't know if it'll be anything like
[24:29] that I don't know but we do know fewer
[24:32] and fewer people will be saved that's
[24:34] what Jesus said few there be that find
[24:36] it and then Paul said evil seducers
[24:39] shall wax worse and worse deceived and
[24:41] being deceived and Jesus said he said
[24:44] the love of many shall wax cold so
[24:47] there's less love less PE there's few
[24:49] people being
[24:51] saved right uh there's more deception
[24:53] than ever but we've got to be the light
[24:55] in the midst of Darkness we've got to be
[24:57] the salt of the earth in a taste of
[25:00] society praise God Amen I believe we are
[25:03] praise God hallelujah and as brother bam
[25:06] said who would despise a day of small
[25:08] things remember where I preached out of
[25:09] that out of was it
[25:11] Zechariah if I'm not
[25:13] mistaken yes there's less being saved
[25:15] but this is God's will for this day it's
[25:18] not the age of an open door it's the age
[25:21] of being hot in the midst of Leonia
[25:24] amen hallelujah it's the age of getting
[25:26] eyes out it's age of getting white rment
[25:29] it's the age of getting spiritual gold
[25:31] time tested Faith Hallelujah that's the
[25:34] age that it is where few people be saved
[25:37] hallelujah it's the age of restoration
[25:40] remember brother Ram said in Look Away
[25:41] to Jesus 63 he said my ministry will
[25:44] drop down because prophecy has to catch
[25:46] up to what's already
[25:48] happened he said he said my Ministry is
[25:50] not going to get greater it's going to
[25:52] get less known and hasn't that happened
[25:54] was that man right or not that man was
[25:57] right hallelujah praise
[25:59] God see so we see there's less and less
[26:02] but that shouldn't discourage us from
[26:04] praying for Revelation for being a
[26:06] continuation of the book of Acts Church
[26:09] Hallelujah for waiting on God for
[26:11] trusting in God and remembering that our
[26:14] lives have to match the book of Acts
[26:15] praise God
[26:19] Amen thank the Lord we're all waiting
[26:21] for the latter rain but until then let's
[26:22] enjoy the former rain that's the way I
[26:24] believe it I do enjoy that don't you I
[26:27] enjoy being taught by the message of
[26:29] this hour the Bible revelations God gave
[26:31] to brother bradam Hallelujah and the
[26:34] Bible said 1 Corinthians 12:31 covet
[26:36] earnestly the best gifts and yet show I
[26:40] unto you a more excellent way now last
[26:41] Wednesday we did a good job well that's
[26:44] my that's my humble opinion we were
[26:46] praying for miracles what are we praying
[26:47] for the greater gifts now the greatest
[26:50] gift seem to be prophecy because it will
[26:52] bless more people that's what we're
[26:53] going to have to pray for tonight only
[26:55] been preaching let's see been preaching
[26:57] 25 minutes already ah that clocks
[27:00] wrong but see there's a we got to pray
[27:02] for that we got to pray we have to
[27:03] earnestly covet that we got to have
[27:05] times where we called to God not just
[27:07] when we're sick not just when we're
[27:09] things are tight financially while we're
[27:11] well while things are going good we got
[27:14] to call out to God
[27:16] hallelujah just things that that are
[27:18] going good that don't mean things are
[27:19] going good right that don't that don't
[27:21] mean spiritually everything's going good
[27:23] praise God we got to call to God the
[27:26] Bible said call upon God while you can
[27:28] Hallelujah call Isaiah says that call
[27:31] upon him while he's near
[27:33] Hallelujah and it's not the
[27:36] tribulation Hallelujah am and so
[27:41] the uh these early Apostles had the Holy
[27:44] Ghost and testimonies and it brought
[27:46] great fear upon the people oh yeah
[27:48] brother Paul Jackson texted me and said
[27:50] people were still talking about the
[27:51] sermon last week in the service amen see
[27:54] the Holy Ghost makes a difference it
[27:55] makes all the difference amen that's
[27:57] that's all it is it's the Holy
[28:00] Ghost and I hope you know I hope in two
[28:02] weeks we'll be talking about what God
[28:03] preached through brother
[28:05] Diggs glory and the church said remember
[28:09] that service oh that was wonderful you
[28:10] know another uh it's like the Theo I
[28:12] always use the Theo because that's the
[28:13] most recent one you know oh remember
[28:15] that time what a time what God does
[28:18] hallelujah God
[28:20] moves uh acts 5 verse5 after ananas and
[28:23] Safa died the Bible said they gave up
[28:25] The Ghost and great fear Came Upon all
[28:27] them that heard these
[28:30] things
[28:32] right now church that's what that's what
[28:34] God is restoring us back to he's
[28:36] restoring us back to a real fear of
[28:39] God right I prayed that before Lord
[28:42] don't let any sin come in that door am
[28:46] praise God am and I think that's why
[28:48] God's given us Grace with all these good
[28:50] preachers amen as far as I know now we
[28:53] had preachers at the beginning that have
[28:54] left the message but they never left any
[28:56] of their stained do Doctrine they're
[28:58] false Doctrine by God's grace but great
[29:01] fear what would that look like today
[29:03] like when brother di when brother dig
[29:05] says uh pre people don't want to uh they
[29:08] don't even want to worship think about
[29:10] is great fear upon a church that doesn't
[29:12] want to
[29:13] worship how about is great fear on a
[29:15] church that just chews their nails all
[29:17] the
[29:18] service or sleeps and snores and drools
[29:21] down their chin is
[29:22] that no it's okay for
[29:26] Zion but not for
[29:28] us now we all get tired don't get wrong
[29:30] sometime like when Ben was here last
[29:31] time I was really tired you know I was
[29:33] really tired that day it happens to all
[29:35] of us but I'm saying the early church
[29:37] with the fire of God on fire zealous for
[29:40] God there was great fear on them praise
[29:42] God they really respected God and that's
[29:46] what God's bringing us back to
[29:48] hallelujah
[29:49] amen but I've also seen it it goes in
[29:52] years as well because I I think our
[29:54] greatest time of Revival was 2010 to
[29:57] 2012 that's what from my records that's
[30:00] what I can
[30:01] see right that was the most miracles on
[30:03] my list I wrote them down there that's
[30:04] the most miracles on our list it was
[30:06] just three years 10 11 12 three years of
[30:10] just blessing after blessing but I love
[30:12] what God said I'll restore sayith the
[30:14] Lord
[30:15] amen I told you there's different
[30:17] churches like ones in Louisiana and even
[30:19] Ohio that are experiencing revivals but
[30:21] their pastors have preached for 40 or 50
[30:23] years and they've seen it go up and down
[30:26] for 10 years 20 years 15 years and
[30:28] churches go through revivals like that
[30:31] so it you know I I'm saying this not to
[30:33] discourage anybody but just to let you
[30:35] know church has church have to go
[30:36] through trials all of us got to go
[30:38] through the Hall of critics amen right
[30:41] if every service was a great Revival we
[30:43] wouldn't appreciate this the quiet
[30:45] humble Services right right we'd run out
[30:48] of we would probably ruin our vocal
[30:50] cords which some preachers probably
[30:52] already have maybe they'll never get it
[30:55] back uh you know we
[30:57] we'd have all kinds of uh you know we'd
[30:59] expect God you know to be there every
[31:01] time but what if God pulls himself back
[31:03] like Hezekiah to test us would I would
[31:06] we doubt we're saved you know see that's
[31:08] why we need a revelation that we're
[31:10] saved we need a revelation that we have
[31:12] no condemnation come on church we need a
[31:15] revelation that the blood of Jesus
[31:17] Christ perfects us hallelujah whether
[31:20] rain or shine for better or worse as the
[31:22] vow say for the marriage amen for rich
[31:24] or poor the blood of Jesus Christ he's
[31:27] made a covenant and we are his bride
[31:29] we've got his wedding band of unmar
[31:31] Grace amen
[31:33] hallelujah we belong to him and he
[31:36] belongs to us praise
[31:38] God like brother R said it's a law of
[31:40] contrast if you never were sick you
[31:42] never know the blessing of being
[31:44] well you wouldn't know a good woman
[31:46] without the the lowness of a prostitute
[31:48] out there in an akan you got to have you
[31:52] got to have the
[31:53] contrast and it just it's just been more
[31:55] real to me every Church goes through for
[31:57] this we just got to keep moving on with
[31:59] God Amen because God sayith God I will
[32:01] restore he said right that's not my
[32:03] words Brother Martin that's God's words
[32:05] amen I'll restore all those what months
[32:09] all those years oh come on somebody all
[32:12] those years that have been that have
[32:15] passed by and you missed the move of God
[32:17] or we struggled through we're learning
[32:18] how to overcome I'll restore all those
[32:20] years we'll get all the blessings of all
[32:22] those years poured and and given back to
[32:25] us praise God we'll get them restored
[32:28] back any years that that Wen as great as
[32:30] they could have been or as good we'll
[32:31] get those back if we just follow on to
[32:34] know the Lord that's what the Bible says
[32:36] in Hosea I don't have the verse right in
[32:38] front of me but the Bible said if you
[32:39] follow on to know the Lord he will find
[32:42] you he will return to you amen
[32:47] hallelujah people can't raise their
[32:49] hands they can't even sing they just
[32:51] need the choir to sing where's the fear
[32:52] of God in that they can't say Amen to
[32:55] the word of God right can't come up and
[32:58] pray for somebody I mean I've been to
[32:59] I've been to numerous message churches
[33:01] my goodness I'm not going to name them
[33:02] but I preach my heart out I'm sweating
[33:05] and crying and one or two people come up
[33:07] and the whole church just sits there and
[33:09] don't even come up to pray for these
[33:12] people you got
[33:14] teenagers between hell and heaven and
[33:17] nobody comes up to pray for them right
[33:19] what's wrong with these
[33:21] people they're they're they're
[33:23] lukewarm they're miserable naked uh and
[33:27] have need of nothing they don't have a
[33:28] need of a holy ghost filled Saint in the
[33:30] church something's wrong with that
[33:32] praise
[33:33] God hallelujah so after I preached hour
[33:36] and a half or maybe two hours if I'm a
[33:38] guest
[33:39] preacher then I'm the one who's got to
[33:41] go up and labor and I'm the one who's
[33:42] got to pray them through through which
[33:44] is okay but how come we got all these
[33:46] people that say they're filled with the
[33:47] Holy Ghost and don't have a care to pray
[33:48] for this person at the altar something's
[33:51] wrong that's not the fear of God the
[33:54] church said I didn't play to preach that
[33:57] tonight that kind of came out so it
[33:59] could could mean something it may not
[34:00] mean nothing I'm not God but great fear
[34:03] Came Upon them
[34:05] church if we say we're the book of Acts
[34:07] Church we've got to strive with all we
[34:10] have to be the book of Acts
[34:13] church now here's something brother man
[34:15] said I thought was very striking in the
[34:16] church age book remember that Moses was
[34:18] born for a certain work but he could not
[34:20] do that work until he had received the
[34:22] gifts which would enable him to do that
[34:25] work he had to go out in the desert and
[34:27] wait there God had an appointed time so
[34:30] I want to read this to show you you know
[34:31] some of us wonder what are the gifts and
[34:33] you know my life and all these things
[34:34] church God has an appointed time amen
[34:39] hallelujah think about Simeon and Anna
[34:42] remember they were old servants in the
[34:44] temple when Jesus was born all those
[34:48] years they were not wasted praise
[34:51] God Elizabeth right and her husband
[34:54] Zacharias all those years no children
[34:57] children right it wasn't a waste Anna
[35:00] was a a widow all those years no husband
[35:02] she just served god with prayer and
[35:04] fasting all those years but then she
[35:06] gets to see God's salvation
[35:09] hallelujah oh there's no Wast of time in
[35:12] God Amen serve God reverently faithful
[35:17] ex Express to God your desires
[35:19] Faithfully serve him and he'll give you
[35:21] the desires of your heart praise God
[35:24] Amen
[35:25] absolutely but some of those gifts
[35:27] didn't operate to the very ends of their
[35:29] life right but I love this Moses Mo now
[35:33] of course the burning bush represented
[35:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost if I'm not
[35:36] mistaken I could be wrong on that there
[35:38] could be a different type in there maybe
[35:41] when he come down with the face glow
[35:43] maybe that represent the Holy Ghost I
[35:44] don't know I actually don't know I have
[35:46] to go search the quotes for the types we
[35:49] can see lots of types in
[35:51] there okay now I think I got those are
[35:54] my original notes I wanted to make sure
[35:56] I preached there
[35:57] those are some good
[35:59] quotes very important quotes to show how
[36:02] we are a continuation but we've got to
[36:04] desire more of God's power and when the
[36:07] Holy Ghost comes great fear comes upon
[36:10] the people they'll be very reverent to
[36:13] the Holy
[36:16] Spirit now Acts 2 verse4 says and they
[36:20] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[36:22] began to speak with other tongues as the
[36:23] spirit gave them utterance so according
[36:26] to my understanding the Holy Ghost
[36:28] filled their souls and they started
[36:29] speaking in tongues they didn't
[36:31] understand so they they ran out in the
[36:33] streets and declared they're trying to
[36:35] declare the wonderful works of God and
[36:37] all these 17 Nations heard the gospel in
[36:40] their own languages that's the best that
[36:43] I can understand right Supernatural so
[36:45] Supernatural wind Supernatural fire I'll
[36:47] say like this Supernatural Unity as well
[36:51] because they were all in one place and
[36:52] notice they weren't arguing about who's
[36:53] the greatest preacher like they were
[36:55] before see there were just saying Jesus
[36:57] promis it Jesus promis it may God help
[36:59] us this weekend to to claim the promise
[37:01] of God Jesus you promise Jesus you
[37:04] promis bless the youth amen pour out
[37:06] your spirit Hallelujah visit our church
[37:08] we need Miracles we need the spirit
[37:10] poured out we have great fear towards
[37:11] God
[37:13] hallelujah amen meanings are not done in
[37:16] vain people don't travel all these
[37:18] hundreds of miles in vain brother
[37:20] brother digs doesn't travel in vain
[37:22] hallelujah amen there's a
[37:25] purpose Hallelujah
[37:27] they're out into the streets a
[37:29] supernatural move of God it was noise
[37:31] abroad it was noisy brother said
[37:32] wherever there's God there's noise right
[37:35] right but the other side of it sometimes
[37:37] God does great things and there's no
[37:38] noise like the planets uh revolving
[37:41] around the solar system right or was it
[37:44] discs which one was it was disc or I'm
[37:46] just kidding that's a
[37:49] joke and then later on they speak in
[37:52] tongues prophesy and G and the Bible
[37:54] said you they'll dream dreams and
[37:56] they'll have Visions praise God Amen oh
[37:59] God may we go to bed asking God for a
[38:01] dream or vision and then wake up with
[38:03] the satisfaction that God spoke to us
[38:06] praise God amen amen just having just
[38:09] living under that expectation praise
[38:13] God I know when I had that one dream of
[38:15] brother Ram it moved me more to prayer
[38:17] than ever
[38:18] before because I thought have I
[38:20] disappointed your brother brm have I
[38:21] disappointed then God had to use Brother
[38:22] Ray to come in there and give me a a
[38:24] better understanding why don't you ask
[38:27] God he said brother brother brother
[38:28] brand said why don't you ask
[38:31] God I thought I had but apparently I
[38:33] hadn't some type of rebuke but God
[38:37] speaks to us
[38:38] church and then 22 God approved Jesus by
[38:42] Miracles wonders and signs that's what
[38:45] approves people's lives is the signs
[38:47] wonders and miracles that fill their
[38:50] lives that was Jesus's Vindication
[38:54] Hallelujah and then Peter says say God
[38:56] shed forth this which you see and hear
[38:59] so when the Holy Ghost Falls people will
[39:01] see it and people will hear it amen the
[39:05] r said a woman never rarely had a baby
[39:07] without any pain I guess there are a
[39:09] couple my wife could probably tell of
[39:11] some other friends that maybe had a baby
[39:12] without any pain but in most cases under
[39:15] normal circumstances and normal
[39:17] women you can see it and you can hear
[39:21] it
[39:23] right and that's exactly what the new
[39:25] birth is you can see something's
[39:27] happening you can hear something's
[39:29] happening amen glory and you're not
[39:32] ashamed of it you don't care who's
[39:34] around because eternal life is around
[39:37] amen eternal life has come around and
[39:40] it's lived in your soul praise God Amen
[39:44] you're not ashamed of eternal life
[39:46] that's what you wanted your whole life
[39:48] amen that's right that's right
[39:51] Hallelujah you wanted eternal life you
[39:53] wanted power you want to be a witness
[39:55] you want to change you want the the love
[39:56] of God and when it comes how could you
[39:58] be quiet praise God amen
[40:01] amen how could I ever walk away from the
[40:03] one who saved my life
[40:05] amen
[40:07] hallelujah and after they got baptized
[40:09] they were gladly hearing the word and
[40:12] God added to their church and they
[40:14] Fellowship gladly you didn't have to beg
[40:16] him to come to
[40:17] church I'm glad I I don't have to beg
[40:19] any of you to come to
[40:21] church Hallelujah they like hearing from
[40:24] the preachers they like asking the
[40:25] preachers questions that's why I'm glad
[40:27] you guys asked me questions and the
[40:29] Bible said they had many wonders and
[40:31] signs done by the apostles how am I
[40:34] doing all my time okay about 40 minutes
[40:36] or
[40:37] so hard to believe that now I want to
[40:40] read these quotes just in as
[40:41] encouragement
[40:44] here brother Ram says this in why 1959
[40:47] is that I don't know if that's my fault
[40:50] yep it's probably my
[40:52] fault that was definitely me sometimes I
[40:54] just try to screw these in make him a
[40:57] little more steady I guess I don't know
[40:58] I'm not a not an audio guy he said until
[41:01] that man gets all those human-made
[41:03] psychology beat out of him by the holy
[41:06] spirit this man said a denominational
[41:09] man's got to get all of his man-made
[41:11] ideas beat out of him like gold getting
[41:13] beaten right like a precious metal
[41:15] getting beaten not like a parent beating
[41:18] a child not like that not like that at
[41:21] all shouldn't beat your children anyway
[41:22] you ought to have enough wisdom not to
[41:23] beat them got to apply the rod but don't
[41:26] beat them there's the difference like I
[41:29] told you I used to use the bamboo now my
[41:31] wife does such a good job I haven't had
[41:32] to do it for a while so these younger
[41:33] ones are really lucky they didn't have
[41:36] to uh they're really lucky they must
[41:38] have learned from their older siblings
[41:39] right
[41:41] guys no pain no gain they
[41:44] said I only got spank One Time by my dad
[41:47] that was really awful he said uh but he
[41:50] gets you got to get psychology beat out
[41:52] of them by the Holy Spirit and lay there
[41:54] until they're rotten to their own ideas
[41:56] and then they'll receive the Holy
[41:59] Ghost you got to lay there get beat and
[42:02] R out I'm so tired of this I'm so tired
[42:05] of this old life I want a new life
[42:07] praise God Amen that's what they did at
[42:10] Pentecost
[42:12] Hallelujah that let the Holy Spirit beat
[42:14] all their man-made Creeds all the
[42:16] Pharisee and sadducee and herodian and
[42:19] and and and the scribes and all their
[42:21] nonsense beat out of them you don't have
[42:23] power we don't have power we'll know and
[42:25] we've got power power
[42:27] hallelujah
[42:29] amen we'll know when we got power
[42:31] hallelujah it's exactly
[42:35] right the no birth the new birth sorry
[42:37] is no different from any other birth
[42:39] it's a
[42:41] mess that's why brother R said you don't
[42:43] come up and shake a preacher's hand and
[42:44] you're born again no sir you got to have
[42:47] a
[42:48] mess you ought to seen what mess I was
[42:50] in when I got it and brother Ram said
[42:52] every once in a while I like this it
[42:55] comes upon me me again I get messy again
[42:58] with
[43:01] it he said I cry and boohoo and I carry
[43:05] on until I guess I don't look very good
[43:07] to look at but I got something on the
[43:10] inside of me that's taking me on and on
[43:12] and on and on and on he said ah I can go
[43:16] on and on into October of 2023 and I can
[43:19] go into 2024 however many years the Lord
[43:21] tell I've got power to go on Hallelujah
[43:25] that's exactly right
[43:26] because it keeps coming on me amen glory
[43:29] it keeps anointing me it keeps humbling
[43:32] me it keeps uh uh pushing out any
[43:34] man-made ideas any any sin it keeps
[43:37] driving all that out and keeps me humble
[43:39] in his presence praise
[43:43] God he said it's new life I don't care
[43:46] what it looks like I want to know what
[43:47] it is that's the main
[43:51] thing brother said in identify with
[43:54] Christ 1959 no no one can receive the
[43:56] Holy Ghost without being something
[43:59] happening to them he said they'll see
[44:01] the
[44:02] results Hallelujah that's right the Holy
[44:05] Ghost brings
[44:07] results you are a new person
[44:11] Hallelujah the old things have passed
[44:13] away behold All Things become
[44:16] new
[44:19] Hallelujah brother raham said I'll stand
[44:21] with you someday in the Judgment bar or
[44:23] the day of judgment he said I'll never
[44:26] answer the Creed I'll answer to the
[44:28] Bible there's no place in the Bible
[44:30] where they ever receive the Holy Ghost
[44:32] without having aemotion speaking with
[44:34] tongues shoutings praising of God and
[44:36] prophecies and
[44:38] manifestations they never did just walk
[44:40] up and shakes hand with the preacher and
[44:42] walk
[44:43] away how many times have I seen that
[44:46] over other churches people come up for
[44:47] the Holy Ghost and they can't even cry
[44:49] they can't even shout I'm sorry
[44:51] something has to happen right all I can
[44:53] do is cry with all my heart and it never
[44:56] fails when the person's ready to be born
[44:58] they're
[44:59] born because the Holy Ghost that's on me
[45:02] is also on
[45:03] them Hallelujah now don't get me wrong
[45:06] I'm I'm very I'm very cognizant of the
[45:08] fact that there's a time and season to
[45:10] be
[45:11] born right you only get certain animals
[45:13] at certain times of the year right you
[45:15] only get a human after nine months of
[45:17] waiting you
[45:19] know very cognizant of that as well but
[45:22] people have to be able to open
[45:23] themselves up keep coming for the Holy
[45:25] Ghost keep praying and then when it
[45:27] comes everybody will see it everybody
[45:29] will hear it it'll give you power
[45:31] Hallelujah and our experience has to
[45:33] match the book of Acts that's what I
[45:35] told those girls when we left Napoleon
[45:37] right I said If ever anybody felt like
[45:39] they' been to the book of Acts that was
[45:41] a service for these young ones here
[45:44] right is that right girls we're
[45:47] screaming shouting crying
[45:49] running praying for the sick
[45:53] dancing if there ever was a time that
[45:55] that that that you could say I would I
[45:57] could kind of understand the book of
[45:58] Acts that ought have been it praise
[46:01] God Amen I was just glad to be there
[46:03] when it happened
[46:04] amen
[46:06] hallelujah brother said you cannot
[46:08] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:10] without having an experience when it
[46:15] happens and when you believe and are
[46:18] made up of the instructions of the holy
[46:19] spirit it's love joy peace longsuffering
[46:22] goodness the fruits that it Bears out
[46:24] into the holy spirit with a fiery
[46:26] experience notice that fiery experience
[46:29] comes down and lights that candle the
[46:31] soul am then you haven't received the
[46:34] Holy Ghost you've got to have the
[46:36] experience to have the Holy
[46:38] Ghost oh I love it praise God last time
[46:41] I was at uh well not the last time but
[46:43] one of the last few times I was there in
[46:45] Junction City I felt I felt led to
[46:48] preach to them on the baptis of the Holy
[46:49] Ghost I might told you the testimony and
[46:51] five people come up afterwards uh there
[46:54] was a couple people that cried but five
[46:55] people come up and say I've just was
[46:57] praying for the baptism of the Holy
[46:58] Ghost I just had questions about the
[47:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you preach
[47:02] exactly what we were uh praying for and
[47:05] the one sister the night before had just
[47:06] stayed now listen a teenage girl stay at
[47:09] the altar till midnight seeking the
[47:10] baptism of Holy Ghost and she didn't
[47:12] receive it but she was so encouraged the
[47:14] next day the preacher preached about it
[47:17] now that's love for
[47:19] God when was the last time any of us
[47:21] laid at this altar or laid at your chair
[47:23] for till midnight and then still got
[47:25] enough courage I'm going to come back
[47:26] and keep seeking God
[47:28] Amen that's Faith amen that's love and
[47:33] she was raised in the message right so
[47:35] we got no excuse whether you're raised
[47:37] in it or you're not ra raised in it what
[47:39] matters is you love God you're hungry
[47:41] for God and you want an experience
[47:43] hallelujah amen amen where am I at at my
[47:46] time I just keep forgetting okay all
[47:47] right
[47:51] 45 they asked brother brandham in
[47:53] questions and answers part 2 64 at the
[47:55] inst of receiving the holy ghost or the
[47:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost is there a
[47:58] difference does a person speak with
[48:00] tongues if not always what manifestation
[48:02] is known well could you imagine a mother
[48:04] giving birth to a baby and not knowing
[48:06] it she'd have to be unconscious not to
[48:09] know
[48:11] it neither can you receive the Holy
[48:13] Ghost without knowing it amen so where's
[48:15] the S where's the thing without
[48:16] sensation where does that quote line up
[48:18] now amen you see that's they they
[48:21] misinterpret the
[48:22] quotes they instead of taking the quotes
[48:24] back to the Bible praise God take every
[48:27] quote back to the Bible everything back
[48:29] to the scripture and then you're sure
[48:30] get thus sayith the
[48:32] Lord we got th say the Lord
[48:35] amen he said there's something takes
[48:38] place in you see there's something that
[48:40] changes you your whole system your whole
[48:44] spiritual system is made new again I'm
[48:47] not the same Jesse Smith I
[48:49] was I'm full of love I'm full of power
[48:51] I'm full of these fruits of the Holy
[48:52] Spirit I'm full of God's
[48:54] spirit
[48:56] and you become a new creature in Christ
[48:58] as the Bible puts it a new creation in
[49:00] Christ you know
[49:04] it Hallelujah and the church
[49:06] said now let me find a place to close
[49:08] here I'm already at 45
[49:11] minutes I'm GNA go and read this one
[49:14] uh I was going to say this for next week
[49:16] but I may preach it again sometimes
[49:19] quotes are good to used twice in a
[49:21] row brother Ram said let me tell you if
[49:25] you want the devil stirred up just start
[49:27] preaching Divine
[49:31] Healing and okay brother show us that by
[49:34] the Bible brother would say okay sure
[49:35] I'll be happy to he said Peter preached
[49:38] on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 Souls
[49:39] were saved and Satan never even
[49:42] moved look at that look in the Bible did
[49:44] Satan ever attack him in Acts chapter
[49:47] 2
[49:49] no now was it wonderful yes isn't
[49:54] salvation the greatest miracle the
[49:55] church said right so the greatest
[49:58] Miracle Satan doesn't get he doesn't
[50:00] move too
[50:01] much right he says but the couple days
[50:06] afterwards he healed a man at the gate
[50:08] called Beautiful who is lame and all
[50:11] hell turn loose on
[50:13] them that's right the devil don't like
[50:16] to see God display his
[50:19] power now we know which is the greater
[50:21] power the soul healing but the devil
[50:23] hates it when God shows his healing and
[50:25] miraculous power in the
[50:29] natural right but how many you know
[50:31] after you get the Holy Ghost well I know
[50:32] sister who knows it I know it I mean we
[50:33] all know it how many knows after you get
[50:35] the Holy Ghost the Devil comes and
[50:36] fights you right sometimes they'll fight
[50:38] you right at the door when you
[50:40] leave right but we overcome by the blood
[50:43] of the lamb and the word of Our
[50:44] Testimony I mean how many times have I
[50:46] preach I'm praying for people and the
[50:48] Devils figh me right here and then God
[50:50] still heals
[50:52] them it don't matter where the battle is
[50:54] all it matters if is if Christ is in the
[50:56] battle because if Christ is in the
[50:58] battle he's the Victor praise God oh
[51:02] thank God
[51:04] Amen like keep when I prayed for Johnny
[51:06] remember that testimony Johnny had that
[51:07] big swollen foot I don't know if you
[51:08] remember that he's walking here like
[51:10] these big old guy
[51:11] 66 he's like the Lord just told me if
[51:14] you curse it he's going to heal me well
[51:16] I didn't God didn't tell me nothing God
[51:18] told him that and I had a hard time
[51:20] praying I had a hard time believing that
[51:22] because my faith wasn't there that's a
[51:23] pretty big foot
[51:26] right and I don't know what's going to
[51:28] go on I who I don't know who's going to
[51:29] get healed or who's not all I know is we
[51:31] got to find the will of God well I said
[51:32] brother if that's your Revelation then
[51:33] I'll agree with you have you confessed
[51:35] your sin yes well then let's pray I
[51:37] curse that thing with all my heart but
[51:39] don't you know I was having mind battles
[51:40] the whole time
[51:42] too right then but we talked right after
[51:45] said well brother I appreciate your
[51:46] faith he said I'm already feeling
[51:49] better he said the next day he said it
[51:51] was 90% back to
[51:53] normal right but see the devil right
[51:55] there he's he's always going to be
[51:57] fighting he's always going to try to get
[51:58] that punch in but we forget our feelings
[52:00] and we focus on the word praise God we
[52:03] cast down anything that exalts itself
[52:06] against the word of God we believe God's
[52:08] word we press on and Jesus Christ is the
[52:10] mighty conqueror amen let's stand to our
[52:13] feet by God's
[52:15] grace the devil don't like to see God
[52:17] and display his power musicians can come
[52:19] here he thinks he's got a lot of power
[52:21] but he's finished amen our Christ is
[52:24] predominant
[52:26] amen take the initiative don't let him
[52:29] push something on
[52:32] you don't let him push something on you
[52:37] and the church
[52:39] said see there's times the enemy comes
[52:41] he's trying to get something on us but
[52:42] we got to push against that say I'm not
[52:45] accepting that I'm pushing back in the
[52:48] name of Jesus Christ amen church I'm
[52:51] looking at an invincible Army here
[52:54] tonight amen
[52:55] I love that I get to preach to an
[52:56] invincible Army every service praise God
[52:59] the devil won't he can't stop you and
[53:01] you we're not bragging it's it's humble
[53:03] he can't stop us because greater is he
[53:05] that's in us than he that's in the world
[53:07] it's just God's promise am it's not by
[53:11] my might not by my power but by the holy
[53:14] spirit will we struggle yes when we go
[53:16] through trials will God give and take
[53:18] away yes but the church keeps marching
[53:20] on praise God I love it I I love this
[53:24] and I share this when we had the
[53:25] Napoleon Services afterwards I love that
[53:28] I could be in a service I wasn't
[53:29] preaching but brother Brooks preached
[53:31] and the Holy Ghost fell and I'm so
[53:32] thankful in my generation I could preach
[53:34] and the Holy Ghost could fail or fall
[53:36] like that and so the Next Generation has
