[24:02] four and five revelation to four and
[24:05] five last Sunday night was a real
[24:10] blessing to me just to see how the
[24:12] prophet taught at the book of Revelation
[24:15] it shows you how to get authority over
[24:17] Satan the revelations contained in the
[24:21] book of Revelation give you authority
[24:23] over Satan Satan hates that book so much
[24:27] their brother Graham said Jesus himself
[24:30] wrote the whole book of Revelation all
[24:31] by himself the only book that he wrote
[24:34] all by himself through the proper job
[24:35] other than Ellison the revelation book
[24:38] of symbols this week 9056 quite a short
[24:40] little but nice little message there and
[24:43] talks about this versus four and five
[24:48] now I want to look again it tonight it
[24:50] the Holy Spirit of course and how the
[24:52] Antichrist spirit it tries to deceive
[24:56] through thought the church age so we'll
[24:58] try to get a little bit further like I
[25:00] smell trying to keep it short again

[25:18] therefore from whence thou art fallen

[25:33] word of Prayer of our heads if I mean on

[25:36] will pray how many father we love to
[25:39] pray we love to read your word we love
[25:41] to sing these beautiful songs but for
[25:42] the lord for his gift their time you
[25:45] invest into that Lord is such a
[25:46] privilege it just reduces me to extend
[25:48] up here and sing i'm not a really of us
[25:50] a bunch of a song leader but to hear
[25:52] those songs and sing it renews my heart

[26:13] walk in the spirit Lord God and door
[26:16] door just open up to us here tonight we
[26:18] ask all these things mean every need in
[26:19] Jesus Christ in every said amen god
[26:22] bless you mean see their praise God so I
[26:26] got another slide show here I want to
[26:28] show the corners again HK my to thinking
[26:31] system appreciate that so I want to
[26:37] again focus on and I'll bring the quotes
[26:39] back up I think was everybody was here
[26:42] last Sunday night when you were here at
[26:43] us is right I don't also when he look
[26:45] like office work so I have to review too
[26:47] much but we kind of last week we looked
[26:50] at some of the quotes by the brand of
[26:52] news there about the importance he hates
[26:56] to be exposed right members say hates
[26:58] the exposed and the Book of Revelations
[26:59] expose them for what he is a liar
[27:02] murderer all these things we showed how
[27:05] brother Branham said the hearts are only
[27:08] turned back through the revelations
[27:09] contained in the seven thunders which
[27:11] are the revelations contain the seven
[27:13] seals so we really need to know the
[27:16] seals well right because that's the
[27:18] rebel that's what the Thunder said those
[27:20] revelations containing the seals so God
[27:22] has really helped us to understand that
[27:23] it's one of my favorite they
[27:25] you know recently office when I share
[27:27] this real quick here as we get the part
[27:29] two but I told you a family member of
[27:32] one of the most famous preachers of that
[27:33] the message has been contacting you over
[27:35] and over and they said over the random
[27:37] plagiarize the seven seals from Clarence
[27:38] markets so I said enough of this I think
[27:40] i mighta thought this I hope I thought
[27:42] it up I went and I went online to
[27:44] Claire's Larkins books and I read all
[27:46] his chapters on the first seven seals
[27:48] well the seventh all the seven seals and
[27:51] I found a few key words that brother
[27:52] branham used but as far as the
[27:54] revelations only one out of the seven
[27:57] was the same thing for the Brandon
[27:58] preaches Larkin preached and these
[28:00] people are saying over and over again
[28:02] all those blaspheming right almost by
[28:05] seeing God's sacred name and his word of
[28:08] Revelation saying that brother man
[28:09] plagiarize it let me tell you this
[28:11] Clarence Larkin said all four of the
[28:13] first four horse riders are all future
[28:15] at the time of Armageddon he said that
[28:17] her and brother branham said they've
[28:19] already happened 2,000 years ago I mean
[28:22] how the church I don't know how people
[28:23] can be so delusional and so I run this w
[28:27] end up bad way in a humble way I wrote
[28:31] that person back and said six out of
[28:33] seven are completely different the only
[28:34] one that was the same as the fifth one
[28:36] about the Jews being the soldier Luella
[28:37] that's when that market actually got
[28:38] right by the Holy Spirit okay the
[28:41] seventh one market made nothing about it
[28:43] so I ran had more on that but she said
[28:45] with the date of our coming of the Lord
[28:47] so that is such a striking fitting I'm
[28:50] so glad the Lord happy preset back in
[28:52] 2009 i think i went through the seals
[28:54] because as soon as somebody said that my
[28:56] heart something my heart i clicked you
[28:59] know that the thirst for life you know
[29:01] that life that protects you and said
[29:03] that's you know that's not what there's
[29:05] no way brother branham did that if no
[29:06] way brother I'm talk with Clarence
[29:07] Larkin dude when I went and found it out
[29:09] I found them to be liars and I found
[29:12] these people to be liars and they're
[29:13] saying a brother man plagiarized the
[29:16] seven seals he did not play he tries to
[29:18] seven seals here's a few the same terms
[29:20] like about the seventh seal being the
[29:23] end of all things that's different ones
[29:25] like that but it was not plagiarized
[29:27] bankers my man said the Holy Spirit met
[29:29] him every day to reveal each seal to him
[29:32] praise God and said it was thus saith
[29:33] the Lord afterwards so it was I just
[29:37] want to share that real quick that that
[29:38] a lot of times people
[29:40] say these things but but you can't fool
[29:42] God's elect because God play something
[29:44] inside of here that's greater than that
[29:46] greater than deception that cannot be
[29:48] deceived amen now here's the quote out
[29:51] from last week I really wanted to just
[29:52] kind of go a little bit deeper I just
[29:54] felt led to go in this direction tonight
[29:57] I you know I started studying us on
[29:58] monday so these things I'm building in
[30:00] today was no started later earlier in
[30:02] the week Satan those are surely at the
[30:04] original Church of Pentecost with the
[30:05] power of God mark 16 in action is the
[30:08] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[30:09] all else is false it has to be now
[30:13] remember this Christ in the true church
[30:15] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[30:17] but the book of Revelation shows how the
[30:20] Antichrist spirit would come into the
[30:22] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[30:26] formal and powerless amen I just want
[30:30] you to see that by the grace of the Lord
[30:31] there now let's look at this so the
[30:35] thought came to be like this how does
[30:37] the Antichrist fear coming to the church
[30:39] what did we learn from the book of
[30:41] Revelation that show the movement of the
[30:44] Antichrist fear well this is the first
[30:46] thought that came to me this was answer
[30:48] the king of my heart I have to look at
[30:50] the first three chapters over the first
[30:52] two and three chapters of Revelation
[30:53] chapter two and three bad about first
[30:54] one but the second third and then I
[30:57] would look at the for the first four
[30:59] seals because all those deal with the
[31:02] church age is that right right so that
[31:07] was the answer that came to my heart I
[31:08] this would be really something to see it
[31:11] through the scripture and then just take
[31:13] a few messages on it and brother also
[31:15] i'm still working on that sermon on
[31:16] symbols i got about twenty Sybil's the
[31:18] book of Revelation with what they mean
[31:20] so I'm going to preach yes so for you
[31:21] buddy and a little bit of less the
[31:23] church to you but because you got a
[31:25] question about well you know what are
[31:26] these symbols the Bible interprets all
[31:28] praise God so I was studying the leopard
[31:30] this week I was again the leopard and
[31:32] how Daniel saw in danger 7 and then John
[31:34] saw in Revelation 13 and so I was
[31:37] looking at well it's the leopard and
[31:38] what's the bear what's up I look like
[31:40] this week and we're trying to preach on
[31:41] that soon by the grace of the Lord all
[31:43] these symbols okay now recall so before
[31:50] we get to those church ages recall the
[31:53] message for
[31:53] each age was for both the true and false
[31:56] by how many realize that when Jesus is
[31:58] speaking of the Church of Ephesus in
[32:00] Smyrna and her demos and bio Tyra and
[32:02] all these things he's talking to both
[32:04] vines because both vines say they are
[32:07] the true church praise God and one of
[32:10] them is saved one of them's lost my
[32:13] goodness so he has to speak to both
[32:15] because both are claiming to be his
[32:17] bride that right doesn't the Catholic
[32:20] Church it claimed to be the the Queen of
[32:23] Heaven now they say Mary's be in heaven
[32:25] but they believe they're a part of that
[32:26] too they claim that but I heard it
[32:28] brother I wrote in the church age book
[32:30] that we're the Queen of Heaven the Bride
[32:31] of Christ is the queen of heaven because
[32:33] Christ is the kingdom happen and we're
[32:35] married to the king amen so let's read
[32:38] that I want you to see this quote
[32:40] because it's a real good quote here by
[32:42] the grace of the Lord when something
[32:43] just struck here how to vote stop here
[32:46] okay so let's look at this here on this
[32:49] little quotation I tried to make it a
[32:51] little bigger is that a little bit
[32:52] bigger to read I try to make it 50
[32:53] hopefully a lot to do bigger next time I
[32:56] try to do a little bit bigger brother
[32:58] games it is such a great child I was I
[33:00] was really proud to have you done a good
[33:02] job on the tech now get you can teach me
[33:04] a few less I'm still trying to play with
[33:07] it and get the running out of funds
[33:09] still pretty small okay so chapter 10
[33:13] from our studies we've already learned
[33:15] that much of the revelation is totally
[33:17] understood I'm sorry 20 misunderstood
[33:19] because we not formally known that the
[33:21] church spoken up and spoken to in this
[33:23] book does not refer to the bureau
[33:25] ecclesia the elect the body of Christ
[33:27] the bride but it speaks to the entire
[33:29] body and people were called Christians
[33:31] whether they may be true or merely
[33:33] nominal as all Israel is not Israel so
[33:36] all Christians are not Christians as it
[33:38] is that a great thought so when we read
[33:40] the book of Laodicea are we the ones
[33:42] that are rich and miserable poor blind
[33:44] and naked no aren't you glad I knew you
[33:49] when i read that sister ready for the
[33:51] awesome I did not see myself as a blind
[33:53] literacy walking around that's lukewarm
[33:55] I see myself as a burning fire hot Oh
[33:59] dios no Christian yes I got my mistakes
[34:01] nice body but when it comes out of the
[34:03] brain and seeking God and walking the
[34:06] spirit i believe on one of those on fire
[34:08] Christians amen if I'm not somebody
[34:10] coming to correct me show me round sin
[34:12] and I want to walk in the light as he's
[34:15] of Allah praise God so that's such an
[34:17] encouragement to me I know he's not
[34:20] speaking to me now i mighta been as a
[34:22] sinner I might've been flood but now my
[34:24] eyes have been enlightened praise God
[34:26] and that's not speaking to me anymore
[34:27] that's speaking of the Falls find the
[34:29] denomination's thing there or anyone
[34:31] caught with the spear of the nomination
[34:33] ilysm thus we learn that the church is
[34:36] made up of two binds the true the boss
[34:38] the two bonds are motivated by two kinds
[34:41] of spirits one has the Holy Spirit while
[34:43] the others in do with the spirit of
[34:44] Antichrist both claims had no to be
[34:48] known of God I velocity went to that
[34:49] Christian Fellowship number of United
[34:51] scope they claim to be a gun right so
[34:54] how do you know who's due by the word
[34:55] the only way you can know who's really
[34:58] Christian is do they keep the word
[34:59] because jesus said if you love me you
[35:01] keep a commander lyrics that that's the
[35:03] only way to know who's really who sick
[35:05] and welcome personally all the word but
[35:07] he can't keep all the word real
[35:10] adversity he impersonally the rapture
[35:12] harold camping right he tried to
[35:13] predicted hey that was not the spirit of
[35:15] christ that was the spirit of Antichrist
[35:17] he tried to predict the rapture 2014
[35:19] right that was he tries to impersonate
[35:22] that but he can never be at a man he
[35:25] could never live it but we can live in a
[35:27] van the bride of christ lives the full
[35:29] word of god let's say it only
[35:31] impersonates it only way he knows who
[35:33] really lives the Word of God glory both
[35:37] purport to speak for gonna both believe
[35:40] certain very basic truths and differ on
[35:43] others so I felt like you're saying we
[35:45] believe in the cross like they believe
[35:46] in the cross right but when you talk to
[35:50] that they said well you can be sprinkled
[35:52] at Baptist now can we find one in the
[35:54] Bible brother have to be fined up of a
[35:56] sprinkling the Bible though we did a
[35:58] baptism 50 study this week that you
[36:01] never seen it you never seen sprinkling
[36:03] the Bible so the Bible is the standard
[36:05] we're judged by jesus said so and st.
[36:08] Paul said so you'll be judged by this
[36:09] work amen now like I like this look at
[36:13] it but
[36:14] since both bear the name of the Lord be
[36:17] called Christians and by such name
[36:20] bearing obviously claimed a relationship
[36:22] to him cause of marriage now god holds
[36:25] them responsible God's both responsible
[36:28] to him and therefore speaks to each now
[36:31] this church honestly this opened up the
[36:33] idea of how Jesus can block things off
[36:36] the book of life they are claiming to be
[36:39] his mouthpiece they are leaving I got
[36:42] life I'm a Christian all these things
[36:43] like that but if they add to the word
[36:45] take away Jesus will got their names off
[36:47] the book see because we don't know who
[36:50] the true boss is but the false is so
[36:53] deceptive because they're saying they're
[36:55] the true they're saying they're true
[36:57] were saying were true the only way to
[36:59] know is who's got the word Christ is the
[37:01] showdown between denominations and
[37:04] creeks are you with me Alleluia only way
[37:07] he knows the word we've got a prophet
[37:09] cut like you saw the middle of the
[37:11] houses he said the Sith Lord water
[37:12] baptism is only the name of Jesus Christ
[37:15] he said father son Holy Ghost are
[37:17] sprinkling is wrong I'll say that the
[37:19] Lord said that that's god that's got
[37:21] talking and that's God and that's just
[37:23] one small doctored think about the
[37:25] hundreds of others that we could go on
[37:27] but I hope we can see this this is why
[37:30] Jesus can bother name up there claiming
[37:32] to be his bride or then they
[37:34] transgressed through iniquity the Bible
[37:35] said because of iniquity I'd never knew
[37:38] that we further learned that these two
[37:41] vines would grow up side-by-side unto
[37:44] the end of the ages when both would come
[37:46] to maturity and both be harvested by
[37:48] hallelujah come on look at this next
[37:51] statement the first fight would not
[37:53] overcome and destroy the true bond haha
[37:56] hallelujah but then neither would the
[37:59] true by be able to bring the falsified
[38:01] into a saving relationship with Jesus
[38:03] Christ my so church listen if you're in
[38:08] a saving relationship with Jesus Christ
[38:09] tonight you must be the true mind haha
[38:12] yeah because you were taken out of the
[38:14] bows fine and it grafted into the true
[38:17] bond Amen Alleluia that's beautiful man
[38:21] they'll never be able to overcome us
[38:24] although we grow side by side and our
[38:26] branches in
[38:27] no sometimes will rub shoulders with
[38:30] them sometimes and the church that's why
[38:32] I don't know who cerfancy is that's why
[38:33] don't call people Surrency because the
[38:36] branch is all mixed together I'm not God
[38:38] now if God anoints me like Paul to call
[38:40] somebody child of the devil when I say
[38:42] it but until I am knowing it that way I
[38:44] don't know who to all I know is I was
[38:47] make myself ready praise God I was we
[38:49] washed at my last trip might that be set
[38:51] in order my life must be sent order by
[38:54] the Word of God he's done and then by
[38:56] fires burning bright that's all I could
[38:59] do and and try to call out into the
[39:02] gospel of Christ amen now I want to look
[39:05] at this here I preach this when I
[39:08] preached um the seven seals I think back
[39:11] in February or January I preachers just
[39:15] a message on the seven seals to rehearse
[39:17] it now the next picture shows the 4
[39:19] horse riders but I want to review this
[39:21] because it ties in perfectly what we see
[39:24] as we read the first um I'm sorry has we
[39:26] read the second third chapter of
[39:28] Revelation so we want to again look at
[39:31] the evil progressive work of the four
[39:34] horse riders we want to look at that by
[39:36] the grace of the Lord I'll check in my
[39:39] notes there they had some other thoughts
[39:41] as I was listen to brother branham
[39:42] preach a revelation book of symbols i
[39:45] was taking out some mental notes here
[39:48] okay now this is a pretty descriptive
[39:50] picture my thought was a beautiful
[39:51] painting look at that that's pretty good
[39:54] if the white horse rider he's got a
[39:56] Harrow and no I'm sorry bono harrows red
[39:58] horse rider black horse rider with the
[40:01] balances and you got your pale horse
[40:04] rider now that right there is the same
[40:09] Antichrist sphere and four different
[40:11] forms it's one sphere how he worked
[40:15] throughout the 2,000 2,000 years of
[40:18] church ages ok that's the Antichrist
[40:21] spirit now I'm going to refer back to
[40:24] this so when you read the first four
[40:26] seals and you learn about the four horse
[40:28] riders it shows how Satan comes in with
[40:31] deception under the white horse rider
[40:33] right and then he starts killing others
[40:36] with your words or
[40:37] literally sadly and then he goes to
[40:40] death right I'm sorry to control
[40:43] everything check out them black the dark
[40:46] ages he started to control money in
[40:48] control powers and builds on Kingdom and
[40:49] then spiritual death sensing right that
[40:53] Fagan's progressive nature mercy comes
[40:55] by deception gets worse worse worse
[40:57] worse worse all the way to leads the
[40:58] spiritual death now what you do is
[41:01] listen this I don't know the exact quote
[41:02] but brother great have said death
[41:05] spiritual death had already entered into
[41:08] the beach in church age because Jesus
[41:10] offered the overcomers a tree of life my
[41:13] aunt Olivia that's in chapter 10 of the
[41:16] George a horrible so what I'm saying is
[41:20] that this spirit would work
[41:22] progressively over the church age it
[41:24] would also work any church age that's
[41:27] going to statement that's true his
[41:29] brother might have said that they had
[41:30] spiritually died some in the first
[41:32] original church any to be searching had
[41:35] backslidden so that my spirit came on
[41:38] and eventually they died spiritually all
[41:40] right Paula said it pause that they can
[41:43] be dead while they're alive Turk said
[41:45] that right so see this fear it works
[41:48] over the course unban owes the whole
[41:49] church age when it also battles
[41:51] individuals with any church age does
[41:54] that make sense this is a little deeper
[41:56] I know that's why I'm trying to just go
[41:58] slower like that I thought that was a
[42:00] glorious picture as far as saurons ha
[42:03] ebo an awful Satan is he deceives you I
[42:07] was a bluff and then then he kills
[42:10] influence that he tries to rule and
[42:12] reign with domain and then he kills you
[42:15] spiritually ah they got it from the
[42:18] power of the tree of life hey Ben the
[42:20] Word of God Christ Jesus amen now this
[42:23] way I talk about from Austin now the
[42:24] east for horse ride I got four play for
[42:26] horses that they're not as pretty as
[42:28] those horses because I I just got them
[42:30] all different pictures this is what I'm
[42:32] talking about austin since since Jesus
[42:34] resurrected here all right in here
[42:36] that's right there we've had 2,000 years
[42:39] of church ages and these four riders
[42:41] represent the four forms of the
[42:44] Antichrist here that would anoint these
[42:46] people and battle these Christians
[42:48] through the for ages praise God is that
[42:51] no compared everybody okay she the white
[42:55] horse he battled the episode church age
[42:58] and summer nuh and then the red horse
[43:01] battle part the end of summer de in the
[43:03] Peugeot most and a half of bacteria and
[43:05] then the black horse battled most of the
[43:08] authority saris Philadelphia and then
[43:11] the pale horses variety here in the
[43:13] limousine church eat his mother Graham
[43:15] said thus saith the Lord Pentecostal
[43:17] church organization is dead spiritual
[43:19] death he's preaching the fourth seal
[43:21] spiritual death has entered in the
[43:22] denominations that right so it's a very
[43:26] serious thing it's important thing so I
[43:29] wonder review that that the Antichrist
[43:31] fear works over the course of the church
[43:33] age would also individually in each
[43:35] church age and on an individual level
[43:37] and here's the slide you can see I
[43:39] change slides now because this is from
[43:41] that message back in january-february
[43:43] these four horse riders attempt to ride
[43:46] in the lives of individuals as well as
[43:49] writing in the church page okay and
[43:52] here's how it is the white horse rider
[43:55] is the deceptive introduction of sin and
[43:58] that the acceptance of sin that begins
[44:02] as a sin and ends as a fake authoring
[44:05] doctrine that's how that's how it always
[44:07] sit as Christians normally we will just
[44:10] a simple will be deceived or will accept
[44:13] some sin and look so wholly or it's just
[44:16] as deceptive it looks so right it feels
[44:17] so good it doesn't seem like it would be
[44:20] a problem force but that's how Satan
[44:22] deceives us it comes in as deception and
[44:26] then that sin if it's not repent enough
[44:29] it grows into a killing mentality it
[44:31] takes piece from our lives how many can
[44:33] say men that it happens to me when I get
[44:36] like a mine now so then peace will leave
[44:39] for my mind I peace anymore I got evil
[44:41] thoughts for this or this that I still
[44:43] appreciate critical spirit message but I
[44:44] haven't gotten to again that's what
[44:46] brother Brandon battle um I need would
[44:49] just criticize everything he said looked
[44:50] up the voice of healing he criticized
[44:52] the rivers there you look at the
[44:53] newspaper he criticized every ministry
[44:54] and I'd only do that church I want to
[44:56] end it on the build-up ministry right I
[44:58] don't want to discourage romance and I
[45:02] gotta get rid of that critical spirit so
[45:05] see
[45:05] that's how state comes in our lives
[45:07] first he deceives us right we let him in
[45:11] and then we start losing our Orbeez he
[45:15] takes piece from us that's good next we
[45:21] become concerned about ourselves on this
[45:23] case we would build our own Kingdom or
[45:26] build our own platform we've got our own
[45:28] ministry maybe that God hasn't called us
[45:29] to do but we just tried to establish our
[45:31] own it becomes a life of pride maybe a
[45:34] ministry of pride it's easy to see how
[45:36] this could attack preachers of course
[45:38] they go for wealth and influence and try
[45:40] to establish their own Kingdom in a
[45:41] local church which I'm not trying to do
[45:43] the context got here vote me out praise
[45:45] God be happy serving the Lord somehow is
[45:48] that about me I'm nothing we're all
[45:50] grown up and we need to subscribe dinner
[45:52] but uh that's how it advances that you
[45:55] become focused on yourself and it builds
[45:58] itself up and then impale is spiritual
[46:01] death now that's never happen any of us
[46:02] right that's never taking any bus that's
[46:04] why you're here tonight glory right that
[46:07] hasn't happen you haven't crossed the
[46:09] line for mercy in the judgment you
[46:10] haven't crossed that line but a
[46:12] spiritual death does take people and is
[46:15] it it's totally awesome so spiritual
[46:20] death of pale horse rider brother have
[46:22] said he'll take his last ride in the
[46:24] tribulation anointing the Antichrist
[46:26] person look up last ride in the fourth
[46:28] seal 1963 in March abundant he takes his
[46:31] last ride so he's riding now when he
[46:34] makes his final ride through the boat or
[46:35] the Antichrist during the Tribulation
[46:39] Period and he'll seek to control the
[46:41] whole world member and force everyone to
[46:43] take a mark in their hand or the
[46:45] forehead that's his final ride amen
[46:49] here's the examples here's an example of
[46:52] the white horse rider riding in
[46:54] deception with e is not in that perfect
[46:56] that's a perfect example Eve was the
[46:59] seed and the servants that you are not
[47:02] surely not right and what the scriptures
[47:05] say the woman Adam was not deceived but
[47:07] the woman being to see was in the
[47:09] transgression I member I fair shake and
[47:11] free what happened to offspring scape
[47:13] and let's read that the future Bob else
[47:15] read Genesis 3 then 4 though I know you
[47:18] read it but let's uh
[47:19] I want you to I want you to see it again
[47:20] because I keep saying that to you and I
[47:22] we've never run together okay thank you
[47:25] sir dennis is 315 now if you know the
[47:32] story they fall in verse 6 i'm sorry
[47:36] Keith balls and gives it to her husband
[47:39] and verse 6 as well as soon as this
[47:42] happened look at verse 13 and the Lord
[47:44] God said unto the woman what is this
[47:45] that thou has done and the woman said
[47:47] the serpent beguiled mean I didn't eat
[47:49] so she was totally to see and begat
[47:51] means to seduce she was seduced her
[47:53] morals were seduced Jackie thought it
[47:55] was right to partake of this fruit with
[47:58] the circle she was seduced verse 14 and
[48:01] what's the Lord saying right after she
[48:04] says this was the Lord saying and the
[48:05] Lord said unto the serpent because that
[48:07] has done this hour cursed above all the
[48:09] cattle and above every beast of the
[48:11] field upon thy belly shalt go test each
[48:13] other he know today's my life verse 15
[48:14] and output energy to repeat between thee
[48:17] and the woman and between thy seed and
[48:19] her seed seed beans offspring so he's
[48:22] already got offspring right and she's
[48:26] going to have some offspring to write
[48:28] that represented Christ it shall bruise
[48:30] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[48:33] speaking of Christ Christ would smash
[48:36] the Serpent's head her authority over
[48:37] sin and death right and then he would be
[48:40] bruised he would die and brother just so
[48:43] you know that's one of the first
[48:44] prophecies of Jesus Christ in the Bible
[48:46] now there's foreshadowing also in
[48:49] Genesis to that speaks of Christ but
[48:50] that's that as soon as they said you can
[48:53] see it now here's two seats two seats go
[48:56] to proverbs 30 brother because i I've
[48:57] never show you this scripture it's okay
[48:59] i just want to reduce is that okay to
[49:00] everybody I just want him to see this
[49:02] out grace no this is a powerful
[49:05] revelation and it proves why Jesus had
[49:08] to become virgin birth because sin came
[49:10] through sexual contact geez have come by
[49:13] way of urgent that bypass waist in enter
[49:16] in the world to make a new perfect human
[49:18] race perfect by the blood through the
[49:21] Holy Ghost amen okay but Austin robbers
[49:27] 30 verse 20 can you read verse 20 breath
[49:28] brother
[49:31] so it is the way of an adulterous woman
[49:34] she Edith wiped her mouth and say if I
[49:37] had done no leakage amen so here's a
[49:41] simple eating is a symbol of what
[49:44] adultery so sexually i eating it so she
[49:47] eats fight from out and so I've done no
[49:49] wickedness but the Bible said it was a
[49:51] dull treat to see this symbolism there
[49:54] the symbolism that's why the Bob said
[49:56] she partook of the fruit doesn't say
[49:58] Apple right it doesn't say Africa right
[50:00] we talked about the heck is this fruit
[50:02] and here the Bible the Bible interprets
[50:04] itself so that the Bible says here's a
[50:06] woman eating a fruit and the fruit is
[50:08] adultery praise God so that proves it in
[50:13] the scripture and their course there's
[50:14] other scriptures to it on time for I
[50:15] want you to see that is this is how this
[50:18] is out sin end of the world she was
[50:20] deceived saying always deceives us
[50:22] usually right deceives us we think it's
[50:25] all this is okay this won't hurt my
[50:26] relationship with the Lord and it
[50:28] deceives us and that's Houston comes it
[50:30] as a white horse right now the next one
[50:35] I had an example I was a male p or each
[50:40] other this a while back about casting
[50:42] down altars of bayonne leave each one
[50:45] sermon on I never had time really to go
[50:47] back and minister on that but I like to
[50:48] order buddy but numbers 25 1 through 3
[50:52] and Israel bowden Tim and the
[50:54] people began to commit horn with the
[50:56] daughters of Moab and they call the
[50:58] people in the sacrifice of their gods
[50:59] and the people that he and bow down to
[51:01] their gods so brother but this is
[51:04] talking about the church age as well but
[51:06] they had them deceived and trick that
[51:08] we're all the same right because they
[51:09] had seven up seven bullets that member
[51:12] of Balaam sacrifice and Moses anchored
[51:14] by seven bullets too and what I think
[51:15] was the piece of trumpets if i'm not
[51:17] mistaken for the sacrifice senator
[51:19] Tabernacles so beethoven personated
[51:23] Moses right and so they come here
[51:25] they're all to see and pretty soon
[51:28] sitting manifests itself through a
[51:29] sexual sin just like E and then 24,000
[51:34] or maybe for the door Sarah thought
[51:35] maybe it's less than that but thousands
[51:38] of them died because of that okay now
[51:41] here's the red horse example that might
[51:43] happen your daily life you might get
[51:45] see what's in and then it might lead to
[51:47] something else here's where the Bible
[51:49] says it but I say music who Stroger is
[51:51] angry with his brother without a cause
[51:53] shall be in danger of the judgment right
[51:54] remember this week we tell this a few
[51:56] weeks ago if you say um okay and
[52:01] whosoever shall say there's brother raca
[52:03] shall be in danger of the council but
[52:06] whosoever shall say thou fool should be
[52:08] need to help her remember the word fool
[52:10] there means godless were calling
[52:11] somebody a cerfancy or devil so if you
[52:14] call somebody a devil and they're not a
[52:16] devil you're a danger Hellfire and
[52:18] you'll have a cause for it danger
[52:20] Hellfire so words are very important are
[52:22] they not very important so that's
[52:25] example of the red the red horse the
[52:27] progressive power though of the NRA
[52:29] spear where you attack others and you
[52:31] have no cause to do it and just because
[52:33] you let's sit in and it deceive you and
[52:36] now it builds and multiplies and becomes
[52:38] more powerful right here's an example of
[52:42] the black horse as it as it manifests
[52:47] and grows bigger remember the black
[52:49] horse wants to control everything right
[52:51] so here Jesus says beware the second
[52:53] describes and desire to walk in long
[52:54] robes and love greetings the markets and
[52:56] the highest seats in the synagogues and
[52:58] the chief rooms at feasts see they built
[53:02] their Kingdom you see that the black
[53:04] horse rider captured the wealth of all
[53:06] the kingdoms and control the economics
[53:08] and had their own kingdoms and so far so
[53:10] here once the Santa Christ fear
[53:12] progresses past just you know deception
[53:16] and and with the red with killing
[53:18] influence now that starts building its
[53:20] own Kingdom every sec that's one of the
[53:23] black horse here's another one the Bible
[53:26] said in John 9 22 if any man did confess
[53:31] he was the Christ he should be put out a
[53:32] synagogue that's I was telling you
[53:34] earlier brother Austin at lunch when
[53:36] Jesus came all the churches hated him
[53:38] all the established churches hated him
[53:41] and so he would go to the day the same
[53:44] thing would happen today because he's
[53:45] the same guy straight today in forever
[53:46] right and so that's what we see that's
[53:49] why the churches rejected brother
[53:50] branham like we talked about because he
[53:53] preached against their sin Jesus preach
[53:55] against their sin and they hated him but
[53:57] that's an example of the black horse
[53:59] progressing in people's lives they keep
[54:02] people they kicked you out of their
[54:03] church they don't want nothing to do
[54:04] with of it they're real Christian a real
[54:05] Christ believe now here's a pale horse
[54:08] example when lust has conceived unless
[54:11] of course the wife of course concede it
[54:13] gets bigger and bigger bringing for Sid
[54:15] and sitting when it's finished bringing
[54:17] bored death so that's the that's the
[54:18] whole for horse/rider is right there a
[54:20] nutshell right because lost starts the
[54:23] losses what get you deceive right that's
[54:25] what God even deceive a bob said she
[54:27] look at server and less of that first
[54:29] beauty that's true and then it brings
[54:32] for death so that just struck me right
[54:34] there there's the whole 44 horse riders
[54:36] in one scription right there amen father
[54:39] didn't because it's hard to lust
[54:41] deception and goes down to death glory
[54:46] we read this the end of those things is
[54:48] death so the fruit of sin is death right
[54:52] and here's the scripture read earlier
[54:54] this proves that the progression of the
[54:57] Antichrist spirit was already taking
[54:59] place in the first church age because
[55:01] Paul was the message of the first church
[55:03] age deficit searched she that lives in
[55:05] pleasures dead watch live amen she used
[55:09] to be a widow she used to serve God then
[55:11] she left the things of God for deception
[55:13] and she got so long from God but now she
[55:15] enters from the spiritual death see how
[55:17] see how the center that is see how
[55:20] powerful the Antichrist spirit is the
[55:22] only thing that could overcome him is
[55:23] the Holy Spirit and that's what we got
[55:25] again how did it again Corey now now I'm
[55:29] going to get into this some new stuff
[55:31] that was a review for Mac light in
[55:33] February so I thought I thought that was
[55:35] helpful that helpful I think it's a good
[55:36] review can only reach one sermon on and
[55:38] it was only like five minutes I want you
[55:40] to see that now church that's helpful
[55:42] now as you go throughout your week if
[55:44] you see deceptive where this if you see
[55:46] you're already in a bind and some cid
[55:48] well go back and find where that I let
[55:50] it get where did I let it get in and i
[55:52] watch the wrong thing not say the right
[55:54] thing now this is the wrong thing right
[55:55] what did I do wrong I make a wrong move
[55:58] on the job what did I do okay that's why
[56:01] we want to see that because it helps me
[56:03] in my life too so I can trace back i see
[56:05] all this is where i should have studied
[56:07] the word i should have did this I sure
[56:08] did that and you can see where sin
[56:10] entered it that's right
[56:13] okay now the new things here brother
[56:17] random said remember through the book of
[56:20] Revelation you can see how the
[56:22] Antichrist fear works there right so
[56:25] what I did is I read through all the
[56:26] seven churches the letters that cries
[56:28] wrote to them and then John right and I
[56:30] looked and saw what was the NFI spirit
[56:33] doing any church age so we'll have time
[56:35] to go through a little bit of this I
[56:36] won't be able to get through all seven
[56:38] because I didn't have enough time I'll
[56:39] spend all my time on the astronaut
[56:41] message for this morning I think it I
[56:43] don't think I only up to the fourth
[56:45] church age so pardon me on that but
[56:49] maybe we'll go no further we'll see so
[56:51] in Ephesus the Antichrist spirit would
[56:53] attempt to do what if you read it let's
[56:56] read it let's go there a revelation to
[56:59] remember if we can recognize how Satan
[57:02] works in the book of Revelation we can
[57:03] have authority over him praise God and
[57:06] we heard these things before but I
[57:08] wanted just to an overview of them to
[57:10] refresh with you because you know what
[57:11] you're never going to stop battling
[57:12] devil while you're here you're never
[57:15] going to stop battle so we need to pay
[57:17] attention so we never spiritual our
[57:20] spiritual mind listening here I've been
[57:22] focused on the lord here tonight Gloria
[57:27] now its first form piner this was our
[57:29] text that's why I chose to read this
[57:31] read his text rather nevertheless I have
[57:36] someone against thee because I was left
[57:37] I first love so what does he have
[57:39] against the church they love their first
[57:41] love November let me stop there who's he
[57:44] talking to he's talking to two bodies
[57:46] he's talking to The True Vine he's
[57:49] talking to the fall smart one of them
[57:51] will never repent but one of them will
[57:54] take a day yes sir first I remember from
[58:01] with our phone and what repent the true
[58:03] eyes will do that she will remember how
[58:06] she used to live her life how far she
[58:08] falling from that first walk and shall
[58:10] we bet and get back there and do the
[58:14] first works or else I will come unto
[58:16] thee quickly and will remove thy
[58:18] candlestick out of this place except
[58:21] thou repent remember what a brother Ram
[58:23] say about this weather man said Ephesus
[58:26] in a few short decades the church there
[58:28] was all scattered because they failed to
[58:31] repent and God took the church he
[58:33] scattered church right away that's right
[58:36] so no matter how hot on fire we are we
[58:39] got to keep feed that fire amen keep
[58:41] feed the fire he drove wood on the fire
[58:43] Deadwood right not living it bigger the
[58:47] desert could possibly be pretty Scott
[58:48] and he dead works and he did then ideas
[58:52] anything that's bad throw it on their
[58:54] keeper fiber all right now the second
[58:57] thing they would do is inject the deeds
[59:00] of the doc I'm sorry the deeds of the
[59:02] Nicolaitans now let's read about both of
[59:06] these because I just pulled some general
[59:08] quotes about these this is the me let me
[59:11] just say this this is an overview right
[59:13] for me to fully priestess I'd have to do
[59:15] like I did for landscape reach five
[59:17] service on the limousine church age at
[59:19] the end of last year and I have it just
[59:22] felt led to do that yet with the other
[59:23] six sure changes but I just felt really
[59:25] impressed to preach on layer to see I
[59:27] like you for each other once I just
[59:28] haven't done that but I'd like to now
[59:31] here's first love quotes also in that
[59:35] age the true church had lost its first
[59:37] love but that love was typify as the
[59:40] love of bride and groom at their
[59:41] marriage and early years of married life
[59:44] there was a cooling off of that I'm
[59:48] sorry cooling of that complete love and
[59:50] abandonment to God he's God so think
[59:54] about when you first gave your heart to
[59:55] the Lord do you have that first feeling
[59:58] of love and I'm a banded the things in
[1:00:01] the world and all I want it's Christ
[1:00:03] amen that's that's your first love
[1:00:07] totally abandon unto God a band of the
[1:00:09] things of the world and I'm living for
[1:00:11] Jesus Christ all my love complete love
[1:00:14] and I'm giving my whole life to Him Lord
[1:00:18] leaving its first love of the word of
[1:00:20] God was revealed to us as having fallen
[1:00:22] from its origin which was Pentecost
[1:00:25] where he's come so that's the importance
[1:00:28] of our first love we must be fully in
[1:00:32] love and fully committed fully abandon
[1:00:35] unto God amen glory now let's forget the
[1:00:39] diesel Nicolaitans
[1:00:41] this is one thing that ever preached on
[1:00:42] but I saw I was reading today I brother
[1:00:45] branham said Jesus hates those three
[1:00:46] things the decent Engel Aiden's of the
[1:00:50] doctrine acquaintance and a doctrine of
[1:00:52] Balaam as well he hates those three
[1:00:54] things now the church was in that first
[1:00:58] age already a fallen woman as say they
[1:01:02] got the e before Adam even now and Satan
[1:01:06] seduced the church the Bride of Christ
[1:01:08] before the marriage suffered the lab and
[1:01:10] what specifically was in her myth that
[1:01:12] caused the fall what the revelation 26
[1:01:15] the DS and the Gladers already the first
[1:01:18] age had turned from following the pure
[1:01:22] Word of God I was keep going for more
[1:01:24] about the deeds they turned from God's
[1:01:28] demand of a church absolutely dependent
[1:01:31] upon him depending entirely upon God to
[1:01:34] fulfill his word from start to finish
[1:01:36] apart from human government amen to
[1:01:40] nikolaev ISM which is organizing a human
[1:01:44] government within the church which as
[1:01:46] all governments to legislate for the
[1:01:48] people in other words they make laws for
[1:01:53] the church right humans make laws
[1:01:55] instead of God making laws and if we
[1:01:58] make a law in better be in the scripture
[1:02:00] praise the Lord it's got to be in the
[1:02:02] scripture like we're talking about here
[1:02:03] Elaine right often the scripture says a
[1:02:05] mention of short hair that's what we
[1:02:07] have right but women don't have volume
[1:02:09] here that's not my fault that's the
[1:02:11] Bible's law praise the Lord so but
[1:02:15] nickel and ism is conquering the laity
[1:02:17] and they do that by making their own
[1:02:19] laws ruling over the people by human
[1:02:22] laws human government instead of the
[1:02:24] word of God they did exactly what Israel
[1:02:27] did they took the X expediency I'm human
[1:02:30] government instead of the word of the
[1:02:31] Spirit ok so there's another picture
[1:02:35] brother just so you can see it there so
[1:02:38] the white horse rider wrote in his main
[1:02:40] his main deception of that our was to
[1:02:44] get them to leave their first love cool
[1:02:46] them off well I don't fully devote your
[1:02:49] life to god you know have to go all that
[1:02:50] way to have to be a fanatic like you
[1:02:51] used to be cool off a little bit and
[1:02:55] also in inject oh I forgot should say
[1:02:57] deeds of the Nicolaitans Irish and take
[1:02:59] dr. that's the next age forgive me that
[1:03:01] should save deeds of the Nicolaitans my
[1:03:03] man I caught it time to take Stan
[1:03:06] remember the deeds was well it's just
[1:03:08] you know it's a good saying we should
[1:03:10] just we should try to them let's make a
[1:03:11] tradition on it let's just try to do
[1:03:13] that let's just do the things the way we
[1:03:15] want to do it rather than the Word of
[1:03:17] God and that caused the fall and jesus
[1:03:21] said if you don't repent that I'm taking
[1:03:23] the candlestick and the candlesticks
[1:03:24] represents the Holy Ghost the church
[1:03:26] takes it out of the church no holy ghost
[1:03:29] in the church thank god he's in the
[1:03:30] church event healing people answering
[1:03:32] prayer hallelujah speaking to us
[1:03:34] teaching us about glory edifying us amen
[1:03:38] Lauren I hope you can see that so this
[1:03:41] is what melanson if we can see how the
[1:03:43] Antichrist your work it will give us
[1:03:45] authority over safety other than that
[1:03:50] let's look at some murder now if you
[1:03:53] read this in somewhere let's go to
[1:03:55] chapter 2 verse 9 and then we read 9 and
[1:03:58] 10 aah babbles too much anything like
[1:04:03] that maybe have a reason so that gives
[1:04:04] me look breaking revelation 2 9 and 10
[1:04:12] min okay you got that like you to 1910 I
[1:04:17] know thy works in tribulation and
[1:04:20] poverty thou art rich and another glass
[1:04:23] needs that which say they are Jews and
[1:04:25] are not but are the synagogue of Satan
[1:04:28] you none of those things which thou
[1:04:31] shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast
[1:04:33] some you interpreted that you maybe try
[1:04:35] ye shall have tribulation 10 days be
[1:04:38] thou faithful unto death and I was a man
[1:04:42] so as I read that what are the two
[1:04:44] things that I cry spirits try to do he's
[1:04:47] trying to deceive through boss brother
[1:04:48] saying they're Jews and by the man said
[1:04:51] these are men that were actually juste
[1:04:53] saying they were original Christians
[1:04:55] they had the original teaching in the
[1:04:57] original doctrine of the original you
[1:04:58] know early Christian church like Paul
[1:05:01] and Peter and James John and different
[1:05:03] things like that they were just saying
[1:05:05] we're originals were just like those
[1:05:06] Jews but the
[1:05:08] who said Jesus that they're of a
[1:05:09] synagogue of Satan and the second thing
[1:05:12] Jesus it was fear not those things which
[1:05:15] you'll suffer so anybody would try to
[1:05:17] bring fear of suffering and trials fear
[1:05:20] he will try to get the bureau will you
[1:05:22] have to suffer you're gonna have to
[1:05:23] suffer loss and you're gonna have to
[1:05:24] have to have trials all these things
[1:05:27] alright so we see he tries to get you
[1:05:30] leave your first love right try to get
[1:05:32] you to take traditions omit to have men
[1:05:34] rule the church rather than the Holy
[1:05:35] Ghost then he tries to inject false
[1:05:39] brethren into the church to deceive the
[1:05:41] people and say they are apostles and say
[1:05:45] they are Christians and they're not and
[1:05:47] it also tries to inject fear into the
[1:05:50] church of suffering and trials now look
[1:05:53] let's read the quotes on the back this
[1:05:55] up now did you catch something here
[1:05:58] isn't that the same spirit right in the
[1:06:01] church today isn't there a group now the
[1:06:03] speaking of those that say they choose
[1:06:04] it or not isn't there a group that
[1:06:06] claims their original and true church
[1:06:08] and that salvation is found only in her
[1:06:10] who's that the Roman Catholic Church
[1:06:12] right don't they claim that they have
[1:06:16] the keys of the kingdom which they
[1:06:17] received from Peter don't they claim
[1:06:19] that Peter was their first pope and that
[1:06:22] he resided in Rome when there is
[1:06:23] absolutely no historical fact fort now
[1:06:27] isn't there a variation of this spirit
[1:06:29] among some message churches or you have
[1:06:31] to have this revelation on some fig
[1:06:33] programs going to come back and write
[1:06:35] different things if you're not part of
[1:06:37] our budget church or not on the rapture
[1:06:39] they say that they say you have to have
[1:06:41] our revelation you're not going to
[1:06:42] rupture so see there's variations of
[1:06:45] deception through the Antichrist spirit
[1:06:48] not neither assessor message believers
[1:06:50] message believe that Mike Dave hey oh
[1:06:53] the way to know by their works by their
[1:06:56] word right because jesus said I know the
[1:07:01] blasphemy when they say their juice but
[1:07:02] they're not we're actually straight from
[1:07:04] hell the Church of Satan he says that's
[1:07:07] what Jesus says in the message churches
[1:07:10] of those days here in the suburban
[1:07:11] church ain't right they say their
[1:07:13] message creatures but they're not
[1:07:16] because they make themselves there i'm
[1:07:18] the only way you got to believe my
[1:07:19] revelation you're not going to rapture
[1:07:21] oh my god help me God of all of us
[1:07:24] praise God it's not my revelation is the
[1:07:26] prophets revelations that right where's
[1:07:28] this president we're just repeating the
[1:07:30] prophets revelation that's all we're
[1:07:32] doing is sharing his revelation that he
[1:07:34] received from the Holy Spirit right he's
[1:07:38] that happen here let him hear what the
[1:07:39] Spirit says to the churches through the
[1:07:41] angel the church age and then it's
[1:07:42] echoed across all the ends of different
[1:07:45] locations and so forth is his
[1:07:46] revelations and he got through the Holy
[1:07:48] Spirit yes now here's the fear part say
[1:07:55] he's going to try and check fear and
[1:07:57] like we know we know the pagan Rome
[1:08:00] spirit Imperial payroll we know the
[1:08:02] sphere the pair of a robe is telling the
[1:08:04] back of the merica but ran says let's
[1:08:06] take the Lord it's good and America is
[1:08:08] going to persecute Christians but we're
[1:08:10] not to fear that praise God or not to
[1:08:14] fear that because we're told not to and
[1:08:16] amen every time the Lord uses those
[1:08:20] words fear not there's an engagement at
[1:08:23] hand which will involve great danger and
[1:08:26] suffering and deprivation now he does
[1:08:29] not say in a blood Kurt man or
[1:08:31] tribulations coming that would frighten
[1:08:33] one but like a mother was about to turn
[1:08:36] off the lights at jumping to a child
[1:08:37] lest he be frightened and he's got a
[1:08:40] mother love right now don't be afraid or
[1:08:43] the light will go out and will be dark
[1:08:45] but remember I'm here with you other
[1:08:49] than beautiful bodies that's how Jesus
[1:08:52] tells us about persecution to come he
[1:08:54] said it's going to get dark but don't be
[1:08:56] afraid I'm with you always I got to
[1:08:59] Scripture three scriptures uh prove that
[1:09:00] Hebrews 13 says for the Lord's that I'll
[1:09:03] never leave you nor forsake thee right
[1:09:05] Matthew 28 says Jesus says low I with
[1:09:09] you alway even unto the end of the ahj
[1:09:12] menon and then revelation 1 we see one
[1:09:16] standing like the son of man standing in
[1:09:18] the midst of the church age how to do
[1:09:20] you Alyssa the seven candlestick I don't
[1:09:22] know she said look there he is he always
[1:09:24] saves in the midst of the seven Church
[1:09:27] ages he never leaves he said it right in
[1:09:30] the middle of the events of the church
[1:09:31] hallelujah
[1:09:33] she got three scriptures that clearly
[1:09:35] say he's with you to the end of the
[1:09:36] church hitch Gloria had no no matter how
[1:09:40] dark it gets we have the confidence of
[1:09:42] God's promise that he will never leave
[1:09:45] us nor forsake glory so he says don't be
[1:09:50] afraid of man or what he can do to you
[1:09:52] this is all I was saying earlier
[1:09:53] remember friday night for those know so
[1:09:55] this was aa saying earlier a man was
[1:09:57] committing some domestic violence and I
[1:10:00] just stayed away what I should have done
[1:10:02] is I should have walked over there in
[1:10:04] the power of the Spirit and stood there
[1:10:07] but if I my sister buddy i was thinkin
[1:10:09] as he got a gun is he got a gun I think
[1:10:12] I'm not going to die tonight if I can
[1:10:13] advise is the night I got because I'm
[1:10:15] not even what it already been in call
[1:10:16] right brother venture called 911 I think
[1:10:19] I am I going on and I decided to stand
[1:10:20] like 200 or we just sit to attribute
[1:10:22] away in our heart and I was ashamed in
[1:10:25] that later I said Lord forgive me
[1:10:26] because when this becomes a reality you
[1:10:30] don't fear man because you're not
[1:10:31] fighting against their the spirit behind
[1:10:33] that bad so who would who would say with
[1:10:37] me like I'm saying I need more faith to
[1:10:39] rise up to be the challenge of the hour
[1:10:40] I say that I need more faith mean the
[1:10:44] challenge of the hour I want to share
[1:10:45] more about that so you do and because
[1:10:48] that's the area one who clearly see ma I
[1:10:51] need more thing I need more vain now I'm
[1:10:57] with you at my grace is sufficient for
[1:10:59] you when you pass through the waters
[1:11:01] they will not overflow you praise God
[1:11:05] not even in death are you defeated you
[1:11:08] are more than conquerors now for our
[1:11:09] benefit we were saying we pray right now
[1:11:11] man we prayed the car that's all I don't
[1:11:13] know with asking what did i do about
[1:11:14] distance I don't know pray we just
[1:11:16] prayed but look the promise of God the
[1:11:21] grace of God says we have nothing to
[1:11:23] fear i'm with you and you're more than a
[1:11:26] conqueror praise god and my brother and
[1:11:29] said you have trials to show where
[1:11:30] you're made of right so that trial
[1:11:32] showed me what I made up I got some more
[1:11:34] growing to do
[1:11:35] right there yeah right I had a lot more
[1:11:38] growing to do by God's grace and some
[1:11:40] thankful for that I'm ashamed of it and
[1:11:43] one way but I'm thankful for another
[1:11:44] week so I want to grow closer school or
[1:11:46] so I want to give a visual now okay
[1:11:48] remember the first tube left your first
[1:11:50] love that's how Satan we can get
[1:11:52] authority over that and say you can't
[1:11:54] make me lose my first club I'm going to
[1:11:56] keep doing the same thing because I've
[1:11:57] always done right I'm not going to take
[1:12:00] the DS with Nicolaitans I'm not going to
[1:12:02] say and run this church we're not the
[1:12:04] Holy Ghost run this church is we're
[1:12:05] going to pray for the Holy Ghost elitist
[1:12:06] church and we see somebody run it on
[1:12:08] their own creature traditions let's
[1:12:10] correct them especially with me come to
[1:12:12] me I'll be happy to take correction but
[1:12:15] now the only two Antichrist spirits
[1:12:17] trying to deceive the believers through
[1:12:18] false brethren saying they're Jews when
[1:12:21] they're not and their Holy Ghost own
[1:12:22] original Christian or not and try to
[1:12:24] bring in the fear of trials but what did
[1:12:26] God raised up churchy race up the Hawks
[1:12:28] anointed amen and oxidizing could not be
[1:12:31] afraid just go to slaughter right the
[1:12:34] Bible said we're like lambs being led to
[1:12:36] slaughter every day we die to ourselves
[1:12:38] remember realize that two kinds of
[1:12:40] crimes are given one profits given
[1:12:42] another car that's driven or striving
[1:12:44] for right the martyrs crowd is the crowd
[1:12:47] it's given they're given a crime just
[1:12:49] because their motors and they gave their
[1:12:50] life but we are given a crowd of our
[1:12:53] lives if we're not martyrs because we've
[1:12:55] tried to get said all these years all
[1:12:57] these funds all these weeks and
[1:12:59] everything and so we get a crowd of life
[1:13:01] because we've driven against it amen
[1:13:03] glory now I think I got Nick one mortar
[1:13:10] change baby Pergamos I think it's all
[1:13:14] the cooks like I liked you I listened to
[1:13:16] the whole chapter chapter 10 to resume
[1:13:19] the church ages but I didn't get the
[1:13:21] time to get all the quotes that I wanted
[1:13:23] Pergamos now that the end of Christ fear
[1:13:26] do he would attempt to deceive through
[1:13:30] false doctrine of Balaam and we
[1:13:33] mentioned that earlier remember it from
[1:13:34] number 25 we saw how bantam deceived
[1:13:37] Israel and the doctor of the Nicolaitans
[1:13:40] let's read I can get your Bibles here if
[1:13:42] everybody commuters revelation 214 and
[1:13:46] fifty maybe you can read that brother
[1:13:47] when you get a revelation to
[1:13:49] 14 and 15 is interesting there's two
[1:13:50] doctrines in their pilots for the
[1:13:52] strange and the program was the third
[1:13:54] church age they battle too awful the
[1:13:57] amount of doctrine so rather than 3 14
[1:13:59] 15 please I have a few things against
[1:14:01] thee because thou hast there them that
[1:14:04] pulled the doctrine of Salem who taught
[1:14:06] they like to cast a stumbling block you
[1:14:09] put 200 Israel sacrificed unto idols
[1:14:12] commit fornication so hats now also then
[1:14:16] that hold the doctrine of the depleted
[1:14:18] which being my date k mera thank you
[1:14:21] brother so again jesus said on verse 16
[1:14:23] says repent or else I'll come to you
[1:14:24] quickly by again she was sort of my bad
[1:14:26] so remember again talking to both binds
[1:14:28] right true mine falls fire now notice in
[1:14:33] verse 14 the Bible said because thou has
[1:14:37] there there so there were some of these
[1:14:41] preachers of the doctor debate amongst a
[1:14:44] true vine right because thou hast been
[1:14:46] he said they are among you right and so
[1:14:49] they they had to repent and kick out the
[1:14:51] false doctrine which was a doctor
[1:14:54] available show that isn't just a moment
[1:14:56] here and then the doctor Nicolaitans was
[1:14:59] just advanced version of the deeds of
[1:15:01] Nicolaitans the deeds was human
[1:15:03] government human leadership rather the
[1:15:04] Holy Ghost leadership and now just be
[1:15:06] coming back or not become the unbending
[1:15:08] way while everybody's going to do the
[1:15:10] doctrine of the Nicolaitans this is just
[1:15:12] the way it's done if you're not we'll
[1:15:13] kill you right this is the third church
[1:15:15] age a black horse rider risen up I'm
[1:15:17] sorry red horse rider now let's look at
[1:15:22] the doctrine of Baylor this second step
[1:15:25] was a doctrine of Balaam we're in Balaam
[1:15:27] top failure to stumble the turn of
[1:15:29] Israel by a United meetings I read this
[1:15:31] earlier number 25 they United together
[1:15:33] first oh it's okay we're all the same
[1:15:35] church we're all just the same and it
[1:15:38] wasn't all right to unite like that they
[1:15:41] are the guests would do two more things
[1:15:43] contrary to the Word of God you recall
[1:15:45] that balak needed out to keep his
[1:15:47] kingdom he called on the most dominant
[1:15:49] spiritual figure the de balón Balon gave
[1:15:51] the advice that trapped and destroy
[1:15:53] Israel alright see now let me just stop
[1:15:58] him from home we should never want to
[1:15:59] see other people fall into sin
[1:16:02] Graham said if you want to see somebody
[1:16:03] go to hell he said you better get to go
[1:16:05] to repay I don't want to see any message
[1:16:08] person or message church or any preacher
[1:16:10] I don't want to see any of them fall I'm
[1:16:12] burdened for them I pray for the ones of
[1:16:14] all way I'm interacting with their
[1:16:16] family I invited the one of the families
[1:16:18] to for bible study no wonder they don't
[1:16:20] want to write I let me love these people
[1:16:23] with a certain kind of love oh we have
[1:16:25] my love we can love our enemies love
[1:16:27] anybody right but to my love but we
[1:16:30] should never want to see someone both
[1:16:32] because that's what the spirit of the
[1:16:34] doctrine of Balaam produced Baylin
[1:16:36] caught balak how to make other people
[1:16:38] stumble and sin and I'm just rude and
[1:16:40] biting them to a meeting brother Graham
[1:16:41] tells us they have a big feast we're all
[1:16:43] the same we all the same sacrifice ships
[1:16:45] having bullocks be upset bullocks and
[1:16:47] then they commit fornication and led to
[1:16:49] sexual sin other converse are not verse
[1:16:52] for the next quote it was first of all
[1:16:56] to suggest that they all get together
[1:16:58] and talk things over and eat together
[1:17:00] get things ironed out oh my goodness
[1:17:03] mercy Lord after all understanding each
[1:17:07] other goes a long way so be careful when
[1:17:11] we if we meet with other people to have
[1:17:13] a talk it out session we can never
[1:17:15] compromise we must stay on the Word of
[1:17:17] God we care wonder whose ground you go
[1:17:19] on Israel went on air I'm tired of a
[1:17:22] let's try right let them come on are
[1:17:24] drowned right let them come on argonne
[1:17:27] like Elijah said you come up here meet
[1:17:29] me I know we're supposed to be up here
[1:17:30] on Mount Carmel you come up and meet me
[1:17:32] up here haha for the showdown that's
[1:17:35] right once you accomplish that you can
[1:17:39] go from there the next step would be
[1:17:41] worshipping together and of course a
[1:17:43] little pressure from the host usually
[1:17:44] makes the guests go a lot further than
[1:17:46] they did it but also that's why I don't
[1:17:48] go to many other churches unless I know
[1:17:49] they believe the truth because that's
[1:17:51] how say in the seed Israel he invited
[1:17:54] them off of their church into another
[1:17:57] trick now they let me preach yes I'm
[1:17:59] going briefs there how appreciative you
[1:18:01] denominations says I've been the message
[1:18:03] but not many because they don't invite
[1:18:04] me uh but I know I don't let them come
[1:18:08] and preach here I one time I had a
[1:18:09] denominational man just give a testimony
[1:18:11] you might remember that Paul Jackson a
[1:18:13] black net there's a beautiful testily up
[1:18:15] just
[1:18:15] our God raised the dead I told him no
[1:18:17] pre-tested to see the test I thought it
[1:18:20] would really encourage the people and I
[1:18:21] wanted him to be amongst us it was a
[1:18:24] over church or the other church on their
[1:18:26] own water hood I want to be among so he
[1:18:28] still sending greeting cards we still
[1:18:30] have a contact advisable a bunch of my
[1:18:32] videos but you know he never got back
[1:18:33] together I was trying to reach out but
[1:18:36] notice we don't go over on their grounds
[1:18:38] enjoy their services they gotta come on
[1:18:40] our grounds enjoy our services praise
[1:18:43] God unless you feel love the Lord for
[1:18:45] example Jesus went into people's houses
[1:18:47] right that were sinners but jesus never
[1:18:49] said hey so we got to be careful to go
[1:18:52] on the devil's grounds if we start
[1:18:53] sitting we're not like Jesus then we got
[1:18:55] to leave that place praise god is he had
[1:18:59] a pot remember Heat number we talked
[1:19:00] about that everything jesus did got
[1:19:02] short of a vision remember all the
[1:19:03] compilers showing me that's what the Sun
[1:19:05] does or without a vision I don't do it
[1:19:07] so Jesus all vision to go next sinners
[1:19:10] house witnessed them win them to Lord
[1:19:12] preach repentance and then whenever more
[1:19:13] and he did it but he never said he never
[1:19:16] compromised and that's the danger of a
[1:19:18] young pitcher like you officer
[1:19:19] Christians like us going into pool halls
[1:19:21] or dance halls or bars because that's
[1:19:25] dangerous we might be tempted to go back
[1:19:27] into some type of the city right you see
[1:19:29] that so we don't want to go on their
[1:19:31] brows when you call them over to our
[1:19:32] grounds all right I'm always done here
[1:19:36] what would over for temperance okay go
[1:19:40] over here all right now that did it only
[1:19:44] happened that they're to God Church of
[1:19:45] the Old Testament what happened the
[1:19:47] Church of New Testament where there was
[1:19:48] an emperor who like bailon needed help
[1:19:51] to secure his kingdom and that was
[1:19:52] Constantine member Constantine about all
[1:19:54] the Christians over to stop first
[1:19:55] recursion let's just let's just convert
[1:19:57] the temples of our pagan gods into
[1:19:59] Christian churches they just took down
[1:20:01] the name of Jupiter and put up all or
[1:20:03] bar to this right and the hit if you
[1:20:06] know that that's history but if you look
[1:20:08] up the constitute the emperor of Rome
[1:20:10] and Constantinople and all these things
[1:20:12] like that he married church and state
[1:20:13] together it's all history nothing we
[1:20:15] made up its history and that's what
[1:20:17] happened in this church age they marry
[1:20:19] churches they they compromise that well
[1:20:21] we also be United we also might just
[1:20:23] worship together that's not God's idea
[1:20:25] God's idea separation separate yourself
[1:20:27] from all sin and
[1:20:29] stay separate from all sin that I can
[1:20:30] bless you I'll Olivia all right okay
[1:20:37] yeah this is my last one let's send her
[1:20:39] feet thus that which started as a deed
[1:20:42] in the first age was made a literal
[1:20:44] doctrine and so it is today so we're now
[1:20:47] talking about the doctrine of the
[1:20:49] Nicolaitans first it was the D well it's
[1:20:51] just the tradition we do we let men rule
[1:20:53] and let them make their own rules and so
[1:20:55] for like that Bishop still claimed power
[1:20:59] to control men and deal with them as
[1:21:01] they desire placing them where they will
[1:21:04] so I'm sure where they so will the
[1:21:06] ministry this denies the leadership of
[1:21:08] the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul
[1:21:10] Barnabas or the work where do I have
[1:21:13] called them this is anti word Antichrist
[1:21:17] so when the people decide with their own
[1:21:20] idea about who's to lead them they get
[1:21:22] in trouble right right now let's read
[1:21:27] that next 13 let's get your Bible to
[1:21:29] illustrate a 10x30 now that needs to be
[1:21:33] balanced out with brother Graham
[1:21:34] statements how the majority of the
[1:21:37] people is the voice is the Holy Spirit
[1:21:39] in a church vote right that needs to be
[1:21:42] balanced out there so as long as the
[1:21:44] church prays and see Scott before voting
[1:21:46] we can be assured that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:48] spoke praise God we can be sure because
[1:21:52] that's what happened in Acts chapter 13
[1:21:58] in church this
[1:22:01] I believe just from my person s alone
[1:22:02] God called me away from Lima right and I
[1:22:05] just felt my heart to start a church in
[1:22:07] 2006 by the bang we all felt let him go
[1:22:09] to do it all the start of the church in
[1:22:11] 2006 and they voted me in his pastor but
[1:22:16] we felt a leading of the Lord to do it
[1:22:17] and God has vindicated by saving souls
[1:22:19] and accurate right saving souls we
[1:22:21] haven't a nominated we have some
[1:22:22] fellowship with everybody we're not
[1:22:23] isolating ourselves and say we're better
[1:22:25] than every best to church we need it we
[1:22:27] need every message church we need their
[1:22:29] fellowship right we need we either love
[1:22:31] and that's why it's going to visit your
[1:22:32] friends and Indiana it's going to visit
[1:22:34] the same saliva it's awesome to do that
[1:22:36] that's why we never cut it off we're one
[1:22:38] body praise God we're no better than
[1:22:41] anybody so so far I look at our ministry
[1:22:43] sa minds to know the Holy Spirit crazy
[1:22:45] stuff we're not into this denominational
[1:22:48] thing because God is separated me
[1:22:50] separated us I love as I say needs to
[1:22:53] get on the past we're gonna have a patch
[1:22:54] to have a church until until you get one
[1:22:58] okay now first chapter 13 verse 1 now
[1:23:03] other was it out right now there were in
[1:23:05] the church that was Antioch certain
[1:23:07] prophets and teachers which like that
[1:23:09] has some profits in the church maybe we
[1:23:12] got some will see as Barnabas and Simeon
[1:23:15] that were called nigeria niue seus of
[1:23:17] Cyrene and banana which have been
[1:23:20] brought up with the hair of the Tetrarch
[1:23:21] and saw as they minister to the Lord
[1:23:24] they and fasted the Holy Ghost said
[1:23:27] separate me Barnabas and Saul for the
[1:23:29] work we're too i called them there he's
[1:23:31] got you see that brother remember we
[1:23:34] talked about that yesterday about
[1:23:34] shutting in the church sometime on the
[1:23:36] weekend then we talked about that so
[1:23:39] they shut in and they start praying and
[1:23:41] fasting seeking God and one of the rise
[1:23:43] up and say thus saith the Lord separate
[1:23:45] Paul Marcus I've got to work for them to
[1:23:46] do this is how every church should be
[1:23:48] lat right here I should pray that's why
[1:23:51] I got friends to God send the right
[1:23:52] ministers my weight put a minister on my
[1:23:54] heart and comment bless us with the word
[1:23:57] of the Lord that's what we try to do by
[1:23:59] the grace of the Lord brother Brandon
[1:24:00] never go dancin in nineteen sixty he
[1:24:03] would lay out all of his invitations and
[1:24:04] just prey on them they were just lay
[1:24:07] their heads afraid and the brothers the
[1:24:09] managers would take those out and make a
[1:24:10] schedule for praise God in 62 against
[1:24:14] the spot where says
[1:24:15] these invitations but we haven't made of
[1:24:16] yeah if you let it stop right here and
[1:24:18] record all these patients or food for
[1:24:21] that that's the come later you're going
[1:24:23] to need this food later on right the
[1:24:24] vision of the table with the meats and I
[1:24:27] want to meet slit the vegetables all
[1:24:28] these things turnips and everything like
[1:24:29] that which was his servants on tape
[1:24:31] praise God now look at verse 3 and when
[1:24:36] they had fasted and prayed they laid
[1:24:38] their hands on them and they set them
[1:24:39] away so they've been set forth by the
[1:24:41] Holy Ghost departed onto solution from
[1:24:44] dense they sailed to Cyprus now why am i
[1:24:46] reading app because brother Austin and
[1:24:48] just so you know but I was in different
[1:24:49] ones like bank and Wendy when God places
[1:24:52] us in a church we stayed here on to the
[1:24:54] Holy Ghost sentence away right we need
[1:24:57] to know God sending us away if not Satan
[1:25:01] is going to get us because we're own
[1:25:03] sheep leaving the production protection
[1:25:05] of the fold and I've seen it happen to
[1:25:07] boss you have a different churches
[1:25:09] people even you don't think it's letting
[1:25:10] the Lord and turns out they fall away
[1:25:12] and leave the Word of God and get the
[1:25:13] life a sitting all these things like
[1:25:14] that it's awful but did they really pray
[1:25:17] fast about it did they really seek God
[1:25:19] for the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:21] this is how God runs the church you see
[1:25:23] that by the Austin this is how he runs
[1:25:24] it here by the leadership of the Holy
[1:25:26] Ghost we must be led of the Lord we must
[1:25:29] pray before we do things we must fast
[1:25:31] you must seek God before we find the
[1:25:33] answer before we make great decisions
[1:25:35] how many other lower amen praise God we
[1:25:38] don't look I got this i forgot to this
[1:25:40] yeah i had one more the third church age
[1:25:44] program host we just did that was the
[1:25:45] doctrine of Balaam and the deeds and
[1:25:47] doctrine of the Nicolaitans is helpful
[1:25:51] you understand it's a little more
[1:25:52] teaching on that side but brother have
[1:25:54] said you have to see how the Antichrist
[1:25:55] here works the book of Revelation to
[1:25:57] know how to overcome this is so
[1:26:00] beautiful I never even had to stop
[1:26:02] before I can see how they been taught it
[1:26:04] all the way through the church age
[1:26:05] sermons and the church cake book itself
[1:26:07] so I thought you'd like that by the
[1:26:08] grace of the Lord and I'm like in a tune
[1:26:11] so next time we'll do a Thyatira i'll
[1:26:13] call the quotes Jezebel's teaching and
[1:26:16] doctrine and then we'll do Sardis then
[1:26:18] religion displeasing works to file their
[1:26:20] garments Philadelphia the scene through
[1:26:23] line church members and the age of
[1:26:25] probably love they would lie that's how
[1:26:27] you can recognize the age
[1:26:28] they would lie they wouldn't tell you
[1:26:30] the truth ah and then later SIA lukewarm
[1:26:34] and no morning of God well Jess I've
[1:26:37] gone as far as I know I don't say that
[1:26:39] Lord I've gone as far as I can go out to
[1:26:40] go deeper in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:42] praise God okay but sister you could
[1:26:45] maybe change it back to their song
[1:26:47] whenever let's bow our heads here I know
[1:26:49] was a little teaching but I thought it
[1:26:51] would be real good and helpful tonight
[1:26:53] to see that in the book of Revelation
[1:26:55] this gives us authority and power over
[1:26:57] Satan that is for Emily father we thank
[1:27:00] you for this word tonight lord I believe
[1:27:05] it was true of your profit wrote their
[1:27:07] board and if we can see how the
[1:27:09] Antichrist fear works and as he said if
[1:27:11] we can discern the two spirits in the
[1:27:15] framework of the church and withstand
