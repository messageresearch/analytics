[0:00] so this has always been like a question
[0:02] in my mind but i think through the
[0:03] scriptures i found my answer by god's
[0:05] grace but it's got four kinds of
[0:07] revivals tonight if you would let's go
[0:09] to a verse here that might help us here
[0:11] let's go to psalm
[0:13] 138 verse 7. so on 138 percent we'll
[0:15] just read one verse
[0:17] here by god's grace we'll try to
[0:18] conserve the time
[0:21] but we're willing
[0:29] psalm 138 verse 7.
[0:34] this is my as i said it's my next
[0:36] youtube video i've been working on this
[0:37] one and
[0:38] writing the script and extending it out
[0:40] a little bit so i found four types of
[0:42] revival if you find it a couple more let
[0:43] me know about god's grace but there's at
[0:45] least four kinds of revivals here
[0:49] and this would help this would be like
[0:50] more like a message question like why
[0:52] did brother graham say this
[0:54] how many kinds of revivals are there has
[0:55] the bride had a revival yet so let's
[0:58] look at this here tonight joseph be a
[1:00] blessing to you
[1:01] and help you by the grace of god
[1:05] psalm 138 verse 7.
[1:09] we have of course a psalm here and it's
[1:10] talking about he's asking god he's
[1:12] trusting god to revive him in the old
[1:14] testament he was asking god for a
[1:16] revival so which revival would this be
[1:19] this would be a revival where in the
[1:20] human spirit
[1:21] praise god
[1:23] sure
[1:24] you couldn't have uh holy ghost-filled
[1:26] souls
[1:27] it wouldn't be a revival of the flesh
[1:29] right there are scriptures that talk
[1:30] about the revival of flesh if a person
[1:32] dies the bible said if they're raised up
[1:34] they're revived that's the king james
[1:36] version word
[1:38] there's at least four kinds actually
[1:39] that's five counts now there's at least
[1:40] five kinds of revival i forgot about the
[1:41] flesh
[1:42] so if we can let's read this here on
[1:44] three ready one two three though i walk
[1:47] in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive
[1:50] me thou shalt stretch forth on hand
[1:53] against the wrath of my enemies and thy
[1:56] right hand shall save me god bless you
[1:58] maybe see that may god his blessing to
[2:00] read his word
[2:02] yeah so that just showed me there's five
[2:04] there's a revival of the flesh speaking
[2:06] of the lord jesus christ at least five
[2:08] different kinds of revivals i want to
[2:10] look at this here tonight so here's the
[2:12] here's the quote in question
[2:15] in the third seal brother graham said
[2:16] the bride hasn't had a revival yet see
[2:19] there's been no revival there no
[2:22] manifestation of god to stir the bride
[2:25] yet see
[2:26] we're looking for it
[2:28] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[2:30] back there to wake her up again
[2:33] he will send it he promised it now watch
[2:36] he says
[2:38] now she was dead speaking of course to
[2:39] the church
[2:41] okay now recently i preached all the
[2:43] seven thunders i think i had a question
[2:44] on it on sunday did i not i think i had
[2:46] a question on sunday
[2:47] i'll bet you all right good to see you
[2:48] sir uh
[2:51] so you know what i believe about the
[2:53] seven thunders i believe when brother
[2:54] graham preached the first seal and he
[2:56] gave us the state of the lord that was
[2:57] the first thunder
[2:58] of march of 1963 i believe the
[3:01] revelations on the second seal were the
[3:03] second thunder third and all the way
[3:05] through and remember church each seal
[3:07] has three aspects to it you have the
[3:09] reality form you have the revelation
[3:11] form and you have the symbol form praise
[3:13] god
[3:14] and so the seventh seal
[3:16] is the one that's mysterious brother and
[3:18] says he has revealed it and then one
[3:19] place he says he hasn't opened it yet to
[3:20] us
[3:21] okay so that's because there's no symbol
[3:23] for other than their silence in heaven
[3:25] for the space of half an hour
[3:27] okay of course that he taught that in
[3:28] one place he taught the silence in
[3:30] heaven meant jesus christ's body left
[3:32] heaven and went down to meet the saints
[3:33] in the air he taught that in one place
[3:35] so that's the way i believe it of course
[3:36] there's other thoughts on that and
[3:37] that's just the way i can see it through
[3:39] the scripture
[3:40] uh so that's the symbol the revelation
[3:43] form is that the the seventh seal i
[3:46] believe is the literal day and hour of
[3:48] the rapture of the bride of jesus christ
[3:49] that's what i believe there's numerous
[3:50] quotes on that of course there's other
[3:52] quotes on the other side of that that's
[3:54] the one that i believe fits the
[3:55] scripture
[3:56] and the last one is the reality form of
[3:58] the seventh seal that's the part that's
[3:59] unknown that hasn't opened up yet
[4:02] because no one knows the day of the hour
[4:04] that will not open up the father keeps
[4:06] that a secret until he tells the son to
[4:08] go down and get his bride amen praise
[4:10] god
[4:11] so
[4:12] uh it's mysterious yes it is mysterious
[4:14] but if you look to the scripture you'll
[4:15] certainly find the answer praise god and
[4:18] the mystery of god is finished in this
[4:19] hour praise god i believe that so the
[4:21] question is what does program mean the
[4:23] bride hasn't had a revival yet in the
[4:25] third seal well there's at least two
[4:26] things it could mean
[4:28] uh it could mean he was referring to the
[4:30] bride hadn't had those seven seals open
[4:32] yet to her it could mean that
[4:35] or it could mean
[4:36] uh the bride hasn't had the latter rain
[4:39] yet rapturing faith now according to the
[4:41] the context of the quote it looks like
[4:43] rapturing faith
[4:44] but it's a little bit mysterious so
[4:46] we'll get to that eventually but let's
[4:47] start in the bible praise god how many
[4:49] want to guess how many times the word
[4:51] revive is in the entire king james by a
[4:53] version of bible
[4:54] any children
[4:57] 13 really close 15
[4:59] yeah
[5:00] really close the word revive is only in
[5:02] the scripture 15 times 13 in the old
[5:04] testament and then two in the new
[5:06] testament so let's look at the
[5:07] highlights now
[5:09] most of them in the old testament deal
[5:10] with how a dead a dead person was
[5:13] revived back to life so when in the
[5:14] cases where the person was dead and then
[5:17] restored to life like in case of elijah
[5:19] and different ones in the scripture
[5:20] their bodies were revived also samson
[5:23] got his he was revived when he drank the
[5:25] water and got his strength back you know
[5:27] after battling off the philistines right
[5:30] uh with the jawbone of a donkey there so
[5:33] his human strength was revived but
[5:36] there's numerous scriptures that speak
[5:37] of the revival of the human spirit and
[5:40] so in the old testament that's the only
[5:41] revival they could have
[5:43] as far as spiritually the revival of the
[5:45] human spirit right so let's look at ezra
[5:48] 9. malacca can you hold it up here i
[5:50] don't have any slides today i had a busy
[5:51] week this week you know with uh
[5:53] my wife in the hospital not the hospital
[5:55] but the medication there
[5:57] uh ezra 9 verses 8 and 9 please
[6:00] four kinds of revival actually i could
[6:02] not change it to five kinds here's at
[6:03] least five times
[6:05] there's probably more by god's grace but
[6:06] for the sake of this little teaching
[6:08] here tonight
[6:09] ezra 9 8 the bible says and now for
[6:12] little space grace has been shown from
[6:15] the lord our god to leave us a remnant
[6:17] to escape and to give us a nail in his
[6:19] holy place that our god may lighten our
[6:22] eyes and give us a little reviving in
[6:25] our bond thank you lord right see what
[6:27] was the revival the revival was they
[6:29] were
[6:30] slaves in babylon
[6:32] but god moved it upon the king right to
[6:34] let some of them come back a little
[6:36] remnant in fact all that wanted to come
[6:38] back could come back amen and that's
[6:40] what we got today all those who want to
[6:42] come back to the day of pentecost can
[6:44] come back amen they will come back i'll
[6:46] say like that all the brides holy
[6:48] ghostfield things will come back to the
[6:49] day of pentecost experience praise god
[6:52] they'll know that this is that that joel
[6:54] spoke of amen amen when they get the
[6:56] holy ghost they'll say this is that
[6:58] praise god and the bible said peter says
[7:00] this which you now see and hear god has
[7:03] shed forth abundantly upon his children
[7:05] praise god amen he poured out his fear
[7:08] and when god pours out his spirit
[7:09] something happens to the person you can
[7:11] see it and hear it it's wine it's oil
[7:14] it's new life praise god it's eternal
[7:16] life amen
[7:17] i don't know your praise god it's the
[7:19] life that comes forth something has to
[7:21] happen when eternal life comes in amen
[7:24] oh glory thank you jesus praise god so
[7:27] but their revival was reviving for we
[7:30] had no temple we were uh we were uh
[7:32] slave people in babylon but now we've
[7:35] got a church now we got a church
[7:36] building amen and that was their little
[7:38] revival he called it little revival
[7:40] praise god because it was not as big as
[7:42] solomon's temple which they all
[7:44] witnessed that right the glory but they
[7:46] even believed the glory of the latter
[7:48] would be greater than the former of
[7:49] course speaking of the millennial temple
[7:50] praise god but zerubbabel's temple was
[7:52] much smaller right remember when they
[7:54] built this removal's temple and they put
[7:55] the capstone on with and crying grace
[7:58] grace the
[7:59] older generation was weeping because
[8:00] they said oh this ain't even close as
[8:02] big as the days of solomon but the
[8:04] younger group was rejoicing because they
[8:06] never seen a temple before and now they
[8:08] had a temple church so let us choose to
[8:10] be happy that god's doing something in
[8:12] our midst praise god let's let's see the
[8:14] spiritual aspect of that today we don't
[8:16] have a mega church but we got a church
[8:18] we got a place to worship amen and jesus
[8:20] is still the same he's still here today
[8:23] amen praise god
[8:25] we must rejoice whenever god doesn't
[8:27] move praise god as for rejoicemen they
[8:29] had a little revival if we've got just a
[8:31] little bit of number of revival we
[8:33] should rejoice on that praise god
[8:35] not be discouraged not be afraid uh not
[8:38] fear praise god but rejoice that god has
[8:41] given us a little revival praise god
[8:44] now i'm talking about the revival of the
[8:45] soul praise god
[8:47] that's what i'm talking about praise god
[8:49] amen now psalm 85 6 male 1 okay psalm 85
[8:52] 6
[8:53] and then that's right before the text
[8:55] that we read psalms 85 6.
[8:58] four kinds or five kinds of revival that
[9:00] was just a fresh one there with the
[9:01] resurrections of the bodies
[9:03] will thou revive us again that thy
[9:05] people may rejoice in now you're here we
[9:08] can relate to this sometimes we come to
[9:10] church we don't feel like rejoicing
[9:11] right sometimes we get up in the morning
[9:13] we don't feel happy
[9:15] right so see how see how the old
[9:17] testament can really help us out here
[9:18] praise god we get the spot where we
[9:20] don't feel we really enjoy the songs
[9:22] anymore it's not really rejoicing uh
[9:24] then we start criticizing well i could
[9:26] do better or this person would do better
[9:27] if they were there you know instead of
[9:29] rejoicing there's a little bit of a loss
[9:31] of enthusiasm so he says a great prayer
[9:34] i know you'll revive us again so we can
[9:37] rejoice again praise god
[9:39] i know you'll stir us up again i know
[9:41] you'll get out of the cobwebs of
[9:42] unbelief and frustration and fear and
[9:44] doubt i know you'll clean all that and
[9:46] you'll give us life again we'll feel
[9:48] excited again we'll be encouraged again
[9:50] god's the god of revival praise god
[9:54] hallelujah praise god amen thank you
[9:56] jesus yeah it happens every time i come
[9:58] to church
[9:59] without a failure every time it always
[10:02] happens when we come to church
[10:04] we rejoice in the lord praise god and
[10:05] again i say rejoice okay now all right
[10:07] we read our text i'm skipping that one
[10:09] uh go to isaiah 57 15. i believe that's
[10:12] the one brother dennis mcbride uses i'm
[10:13] not mistaken
[10:15] and he kind of slipped up on brother cam
[10:17] last friday when i was studying i i saw
[10:19] a live a live stream pop up and like
[10:21] cam's having service on the friday night
[10:22] and so denniston pride was driving up to
[10:24] preach in michigan so he slipped by cams
[10:25] and cam's like let's have a service
[10:29] i thought that was pretty
[10:30] powerful hallelujah for thus save the
[10:32] high and lofty one that inhabiteth
[10:34] eternity whose name is holy i dwell in
[10:36] the high holy place with him also that
[10:39] is of a contrite that's repented
[10:41] repentant and humble spirit to revive
[10:44] the spirit of the humble
[10:46] and revive the heart of the repentant
[10:48] ones so we know this should shine light
[10:51] if we want to be revived we've got to
[10:53] humble ourselves we've got to repent and
[10:56] we've got to ask every every day god
[10:57] forgive me revive me let me feel life
[11:00] again let me feel encouraged again
[11:02] praise god even
[11:04] i repent of my uh whatever my
[11:06] discouragement or my depression or or my
[11:09] my lusts i repent of my greed i repent
[11:12] of my my fear i repent of all that god
[11:15] revive me praise god i humble myself in
[11:17] church that's where we'll find god in
[11:19] the place of humility right amen that's
[11:22] where we find him humbling ourselves
[11:24] like that song in your presence that's
[11:26] where i belong that's where i'm strong
[11:28] praise god seeking your face touching
[11:30] your grace in the back of the rock amen
[11:33] repenting of our sins hosea 6 uh verse 1
[11:36] and 2 maokai can't preach this one years

[12:04] he can build you back up again right get

[12:15] your hands to the clay you can mold it
[12:16] you know i'm not gonna go through that i
[12:18] haven't studied that a long time so i
[12:19] couldn't do it justice but i know

[12:22] potter's house
[12:25] that's where you see god amen
[12:27] god putting water on our minds and our
[12:29] hearts and and molding us but sometimes
[12:31] church he's going to break us down so he
[12:33] feels defeated we feel we feel hopeless
[12:36] and then he'll inspire us and then some
[12:38] blessing will come out from god amen
[12:40] some blessing will come out of our our
[12:42] dark despair and he'll start building us
[12:45] up again and we'll see well god had to
[12:47] break me in order to build me up to make
[12:50] me something new praise god
[12:52] to make me something that i wasn't and

[13:15] through tearing us through breaking us
[13:16] down through tests and trials praise god
[13:19] jesus learned obedience through all the
[13:21] victories
[13:22] no jesus learned no beings through the
[13:24] things he suffered amen

[13:28] reserved from suffering in order to obey
[13:30] absolutely not

[13:33] have to be broken down in order for god

[17:01] speaking too soon
[17:03] i've heard thy speech and was afraid oh
[17:05] lord revive thy work in the midst of the
[17:08] years in the midst of the years make
[17:10] known in wrath remember mercy
[17:14] he was crying out for wrath if you're in
[17:15] chapter one he's crying out for wrath
[17:17] and see that's what the holy spirit does
[17:19] it comes down and humbles you and asks
[17:21] instead of asking for wrath it asks for
[17:23] mercy glory amen hallelujah in other
[17:27] words he didn't see god's word remember
[17:28] in chapter two god assured him
[17:31] he says write down the vision make it
[17:34] sure make it plain praise god so that
[17:36] they that see the vision can run with it
[17:38] amen
[17:40] praise god because that vision will tear
[17:42] it i'm sorry the mission will come but
[17:43] it will not tear it it will be fulfilled
[17:45] praise god
[17:47] look just about the time habakkuk starts
[17:49] complaining god has to remind him i'm
[17:50] just about ready to fulfill my word
[17:52] praise god
[17:55] just about the time we start down if god
[17:57] is going to answer our prayers that's
[17:58] when
[18:03] [Applause]
[18:10] [Applause]
[18:19] and strengthens us praise god wonderful
[18:21] hallelujah
[18:23] just like he did in habakkuk amen
[18:25] he did that all down through the ages
[18:26] he's still doing it today yeah
[18:29] we think god's forgotten about us oh no
[18:30] he's right on time amen amen he's right
[18:33] on time he might have to break us down a
[18:34] little bit that's what he's got to do
[18:37] he's got to break us down and humble us
[18:38] we think we know all about it
[18:40] we think i'm ready for the rapture and
[18:42] uh yeah i'm ready for this promise to go
[18:44] from fast
[18:45] no we're not quite ready for it
[18:47] we need more humility
[18:50] we need more patience
[18:52] we need more temperance as i'm finding
[18:54] out right
[18:56] we're finding it out be temperate in all
[18:58] things the bible says
[18:59] true now with that habakkuk 3 verse 2
[19:02] that's the end of revival scriptures in
[19:04] the old testament now of course remember
[19:05] you have some about dying and then
[19:06] reviving
[19:08] now in the new testament there's only
[19:10] two i'm not going to read them ones in
[19:12] romans uh one's in corinthians the first
[19:14] one is the law revived
[19:16] and i sin so paul was speaking about
[19:18] when he lived under the law he said he
[19:20] would sin and then he said
[19:22] he would hear the law and then sin would
[19:23] revive in him and he wanted to go
[19:24] against the law right your flesh
[19:27] the bible says the flesh is enmity
[19:28] against the holy spirit yes it is the
[19:30] flesh doesn't want to obey the word of
[19:32] god no but you got to bring it under
[19:33] subjection right so when paul hear the
[19:35] word sin would revive and say i don't
[19:37] want to believe that i don't have to do
[19:38] that right that's why church even after
[19:40] he's a christian that's why he said o
[19:41] wretched men that i am oh yeah
[19:44] how many you can how many can you relate
[19:45] to that sometimes you feel like a
[19:46] wretched person yeah
[19:48] yeah at least at least at least seven
[19:50] times a week
[19:52] how many days in a week i'm sorry
[19:54] so every day i feel like wretched man
[19:56] right we see our humanity you know i can
[19:59] so relate to paul oh wretched man that i
[20:00] am but thanks be to god who gives us the
[20:02] victory
[20:04] we always give
[20:08] [Music]
[20:14] and so the other one was jesus his
[20:16] resurrection is called a
[20:19] uh revival
[20:19] body revived
[20:21] okay now in the hebrew the word revive
[20:24] means to quicken to refresh to restore
[20:26] to life to cause to grow
[20:30] uh to to restore one's health okay so we
[20:34] see all these definitions now i told you
[20:36] there's four there's probably these five
[20:37] revivals now there's probably even more
[20:40] the fifth one that i found was just the
[20:41] body after it dies it can be revived
[20:43] like jesus's body was revived and anyone
[20:45] else who was raised from the dead so now
[20:47] there's five okay so again the question
[20:49] is
[20:50] has the bride had a revival yet
[20:53] okay that's the question but let's first
[20:55] go through there's uh there's quotes on
[20:58] at least uh now there's gonna be quotes
[20:59] on these five kinds of revival but we're
[21:01] just going to go through the four i'm
[21:02] sure i can find one find one about a
[21:04] body being revived from the dead i'm
[21:06] sure like with the boy in finland right
[21:08] sure dead revived sir i'm sure we could
[21:10] find one like that yeah but i'll go
[21:12] through four because that's what i was i
[21:14] was planning for
[21:15] okay so there's at least four kinds of
[21:16] revivals
[21:19] let's get back to um can you pull that
[21:21] scripture in first chronicles of my
[21:22] people which are called by my my name
[21:24] will humble themselves and pray
[21:26] can you search for those
[21:29] brother words
[21:29] even quotes that for america did you
[21:30] know that
[21:31] but we know the other side of this so
[21:33] let's look at the first kind of road the
[21:34] first revival is a national revival
[21:37] okay thank you good job
[21:39] good see when you become a teenager look
[21:41] how you go open levels
[21:42] you just went up another level now
[21:44] program quotes this as well if my people
[21:46] god's people which are called by my name
[21:48] shall humble themselves see that
[21:49] contrite there
[21:51] right good try and pray and seek my face
[21:53] instead of seeking facebook or seeking
[21:55] instagram right or seeking movies or
[21:57] seeking entertainment or seeking sports
[21:59] instead of seeking that seek my face
[22:01] amen
[22:03] and turn from their wicked ways
[22:06] then i will hear from heaven so god
[22:08] tells you i will listen to you if you
[22:10] turn away and stop listening to other
[22:12] things
[22:13] i listen to you if you listen to me
[22:15] praise god
[22:16] amen
[22:17] then i'll hear from heaven and will
[22:19] forgive their sin
[22:20] and i'll heal their heal their land
[22:22] now this is still true for israel
[22:25] and see that little group remember i
[22:26] sent that video to brother william
[22:28] there's ethiopians still coming to
[22:30] israel jewish
[22:31] jewish men and women
[22:33] still coming to israel today the 144 000
[22:36] is not there yet but they're on their
[22:37] road yeah they're on their own all these
[22:40] years i mean brother a few years ago i
[22:42] got another uh video where the the tribe
[22:44] of manasseh i forgot i think they were
[22:45] in germany if i'm not mistaken
[22:48] russia i think they were russia i had a
[22:50] video about the sons of manasseh
[22:52] returning to israel so we got manasseh
[22:55] and different groups coming back the 144
[22:58] 000 are still coming back praise god and
[23:00] they have this promise look at israel we
[23:02] i got pictures from israel before 1948
[23:06] and pictures from today it was a total
[23:08] wasteland right yeah oh yeah but now
[23:10] that they're calling on god they're
[23:12] making their prayers you should see them
[23:13] dance those women get in a circle and
[23:15] they dance around like this those
[23:16] israelite women and they those men get
[23:19] on their shoulders and they praise the
[23:20] lord and they got their shawls on those
[23:22] are real believers amen yeah and god is
[23:25] here in their prayer and god's poured
[23:26] out blessings naturally they're they're
[23:29] exporters of all these foods and patents
[23:31] they're one of the most smartest
[23:33] countries in the entire world praise
[23:35] why because some of them are humbling
[23:37] themselves seeking their faces whitening
[23:39] god hasn't wiped usa off the map yet
[23:41] because of your prayers right amen
[23:44] because of my prayers amen god sees our
[23:46] prayers god sees us as individuals
[23:49] seeking his face we've been holding
[23:50] ourselves and god is blessing us praise
[23:52] amen
[23:54] boundaries come
[23:55] so the first revival is a national
[23:57] revival
[24:00] now brother graham talks about the
[24:01] united states will never have a national
[24:03] revival i believe that
[24:06] i do not pray for a national revival but
[24:08] i do pray for little victories
[24:11] praise god
[24:12] true lord plainly says with thus saith
[24:14] the lord a national revival will not
[24:16] take place
[24:18] why because in the book of revelation
[24:20] chapter 13 verses 11 through 18 a beast
[24:24] rises up out of the land with two horns
[24:26] right oh yeah right yeah
[24:28] and that's the american buffalo that's
[24:30] right
[24:31] right
[24:32] talks like a land comes up live like a
[24:34] lamb but then starts talking like a
[24:35] dragon
[24:37] right and that's where all these
[24:38] presidents say oh they go to these
[24:40] united nations mean like i want to
[24:41] president trump when he he was at the
[24:43] united nations he said now we're the
[24:44] most greatest and powerful country there
[24:46] ever was and we're going to defend
[24:47] ourselves we're building our military
[24:49] greater than ever was then they give
[24:51] away 80 billion of it to afghanistan
[24:54] awful move
[24:56] doesn't really matter anyway it's not
[24:57] about natural powers it's about
[24:58] spiritual powers
[24:59] but the point was american presidents
[25:01] bragging about how great they are they
[25:03] speak like a dragon
[25:05] we're the great ones and see we're great
[25:07] all the friends have done that they're
[25:08] talking about how we're the greatest
[25:09] country and they all do it yeah and so
[25:11] this beast rises up and the mark of the
[25:13] beast will come out of this beast out of
[25:15] the land that's right
[25:17] christ god said there can be no national
[25:19] revival
[25:21] because america is the beast out of the
[25:24] land now brother man says in jehovah
[25:26] jair in 1961
[25:28] now look sodom was sinners they were
[25:30] perverted just like the world is today
[25:32] great portions of this nation is
[25:34] completely gone is that true here we are
[25:37] over half the states in this union are
[25:39] completely gone they'll never come back
[25:41] new york california you name it
[25:43] massachusetts
[25:44] some of these places where it's democrat
[25:46] strongholds they're totally gone they're
[25:48] never going to come back
[25:50] all the all the honest people left most
[25:51] of the house people left all the
[25:52] conservatives left they're completely
[25:54] gone
[25:57] right we've got people i've heard people
[25:58] say they went to california
[26:00] and they said they didn't even look like
[26:01] america
[26:03] right and they they leave california
[26:04] they come back and they say it's going
[26:05] to be back in america
[26:07] because california is
[26:09] almost like a third world country you
[26:10] know just turning into awful conditions
[26:13] but rather said this nate portion of the
[26:15] nation is completely gone
[26:18] he said we're being honeycombed with
[26:19] communism and everything
[26:21] he says if you put a righteous president
[26:23] in every county in the whole united
[26:25] states and still be gone she'll never
[26:27] rise again thus saith the lord
[26:30] 1956 she made her fatal move now
[26:33] she took well on her way about three
[26:35] months ago that was in 1961. okay so
[26:38] that's why church we don't pray for our
[26:39] national revival in the united states
[26:42] but paul says we are to pray for our
[26:44] governments right and for people to be
[26:46] saved right right praise god
[26:50] praise god paul said that first timothy
[26:52] two can you pull up through america
[26:53] first timothy two verse one through four
[26:55] i exhort therefore first of all
[26:57] supplications prayers intercessions and
[26:59] giving thanks be made for who
[27:02] all men
[27:03] that's why i pray for our president
[27:04] right i pray for all of them
[27:06] mainly to repent all of them
[27:09] all of them praise god
[27:13] i'm supposed to pray for the president
[27:15] yes you are yeah
[27:17] yeah bible said all men
[27:20] see what does that take humility
[27:22] right because you think oh there's no
[27:23] way they're going to repent well they
[27:24] might not but you're still supposed to
[27:25] pray for them
[27:26] because you and i don't know the
[27:27] beginning from the end
[27:31] for kings and all that are in authority
[27:33] all ever say oh
[27:34] all that's authority
[27:36] when was last time you prayed for
[27:38] nancy pelosi
[27:41] i prayed the other night i said god help
[27:42] them repent or god remove them from
[27:44] office
[27:45] i don't know we'll see it's in god's
[27:46] hands i'm just i'm just i was like a new
[27:49] church is make my request known unto god
[27:51] right and god let's let god do what he
[27:53] wants to do right
[27:54] now there'll be times church where we
[27:55] get the mind of christ like when we got
[27:57] the mind of christ to pray against roe v
[27:59] wade
[28:00] what did we get there other people
[28:02] wouldn't even pray for what have we got
[28:04] we got the mind of christ to pray for us
[28:05] amen
[28:06] amen they thought oh there's no way to
[28:08] be overturned that's okay we kept
[28:09] praying i kept crying at this altar
[28:11] right here i keep asking god being with
[28:13] god and then pretty soon after 49 years
[28:15] glory almost a jubilee praise god right
[28:17] before the jubilee it gets overturned
[28:19] why because god hears the prayers of his
[28:21] people praise god
[28:23] and not every time but sometimes we are
[28:25] able by prayer and the heart of god to
[28:28] touch the mind of god to have the mind
[28:30] of christ to feel the heart of god oh
[28:32] god help us to pray like that praise god
[28:34] help us to be so close to god we can
[28:36] feel his heartbeat amen
[28:40] others say well i don't even pray for
[28:41] the nation but yet we were that's right
[28:44] what's different we got the mind of
[28:45] christ for that one amen that's true i'm
[28:47] not condemning everybody else i'm just
[28:48] saying we got the mind of god we might
[28:50] miss it another time
[28:51] but that's one time for sure we got the
[28:53] mind of christ
[28:54] [Music]
[28:56] oh thank you jesus
[28:59] why do we pray church verse 2 that we
[29:01] might lead a quiet and peaceable life in
[29:03] all godliness in honor true right amen
[29:06] paul said pray for a peaceful life yeah
[29:09] that you can live honestly you don't
[29:10] have to steal you don't have to lie you
[29:11] don't have to cheat yeah right
[29:14] verse three for this is good and
[29:15] acceptable in the sight of god our
[29:16] savior who will have now this doesn't
[29:18] mean he will but he wishes he would have
[29:20] all men to be saved and come to the
[29:22] knowledge of the truth so god god
[29:23] desires everybody to be saved amen so
[29:25] who does he need he needs believers that
[29:27] will pray for some people no he needs
[29:29] believers that will pray for all people
[29:32] i'm going to read the scripture praise
[29:33] god amen did we just read the scripture
[29:35] did it say pray for all men
[29:39] you yeah church sometimes we battle just
[29:41] to pray sometimes we battle just to pray
[29:43] for ourselves
[29:45] you see but the bible says make
[29:47] supplications make intercession that's
[29:49] why it's become the house of god and
[29:50] pray because this is a house of prayer
[29:52] amen we want to make it always just the
[29:54] house of singing and preaching but
[29:55] church this is the house of prayer amen
[29:58] hallelujah
[30:00] it's more than singing and preaching
[30:01] it's a house of prayer hallelujah amen
[30:04] so glad we caught the mind of christ for
[30:05] that glory
[30:07] other people spank against it i know
[30:08] everyone's would make any comments on
[30:10] youtube why are you praying for that why
[30:11] are you praying for that one i said well
[30:13] because i feel out of the lord to pray
[30:14] for that
[30:16] it wasn't my leading it was god's
[30:17] leading amen i love when god comes
[30:19] around and vindicates you like that
[30:21] praise god
[30:22] people doctor speak against you
[30:24] criticize you like god comes around he
[30:26] shows who's right praise god hi
[30:29] he shows you really pray through about
[30:30] it
[30:31] there you go
[30:34] so see church we have verses to pray
[30:36] within our nation for souls to be saved
[30:41] i know there's no national revival i
[30:43] know that
[30:45] all right but i have prayed ezekiel 9 6
[30:48] malachi i'm sorry zego nine four i've
[30:50] prayed this and you've seen me do it
[30:52] those you've been around
[30:55] ezekiel 9 4.
[30:59] no i wrote down the wrong one
[31:04] there it is oh yeah okay thank you buddy
[31:07] the lord said unto him go through the
[31:08] midst of the city through the midst of
[31:09] jerusalem and set a mark on the
[31:11] foreheads of who the men that signed
[31:14] when was the last time you cried over
[31:16] sin i'm not talking about your sin i'm
[31:19] talking about somebody else's sin right
[31:22] that's what moves the heart of god yeah
[31:24] and he says that's the one the writer
[31:26] with the ring horns gonna see
[31:28] the holy spirit entith amen
[31:32] hallelujah god's going to send somebody
[31:34] to mark all those people in jerusalem
[31:36] who are sighing crying against all the
[31:38] wickedness in the land
[31:40] yeah
[31:41] see church you got to be burdened for
[31:42] some sinner
[31:43] right that's true
[31:45] you got to be burned for hot fest
[31:48] i got to be burning for my
[31:49] co-workers
[31:51] all right different ones i can call
[31:52] their names right i got to be burdened
[31:54] for them when i see that when i see
[31:56] anyone doing abominations we got to be
[31:58] burdened for them we got to have a real
[32:01] sincere prayer i'm going to leave that
[32:02] by god's grace yes
[32:04] now the part where we get tested is how
[32:05] many times have i shouting pride for my
[32:07] parents
[32:08] and yeah i don't see a lot of moving
[32:09] that's okay god still sees it
[32:12] it might just be like we're talking
[32:13] about earlier we're about ready to give
[32:14] up and then hopefully god's going to
[32:15] come around
[32:16] god's going to come around and encourage
[32:18] us amen he's going to revive us amen in
[32:20] the midst of the years amen
[32:22] glory i'm waiting on it
[32:24] praise the lord it's all god's will it's
[32:26] all god's time
[32:31] ezekiel i love this one i recorded this
[32:33] one for months by the way i wrote this
[32:34] on a card i had my prayer clauses he go
[32:36] 22 30. and i sought for a man among them
[32:40] where's a real man in the church today
[32:43] god said i'm looking for a man
[32:45] that should make up the hedge
[32:48] and stand in the gap but before me for
[32:52] the land so god is standing here and the
[32:55] land is sinful here god says i need
[32:56] somebody to come stand in the middle and
[32:58] plead with me yes
[33:00] god forgive the land have mercy on the
[33:03] land god said where's anybody who's
[33:05] gonna come and intercede for the sinners
[33:07] that's what in jesus christ is saying
[33:09] yesterday today and forever it's our
[33:11] duty to pray amen amen
[33:14] hallelujah
[33:16] and god he's looking for somebody saying
[33:18] the gap that i should destroy
[33:20] i found how many
[33:22] in the days of ezekiel he found nobody
[33:24] that would pray for the country
[33:26] shame on those people that would not
[33:27] pray for individuals in the country oh
[33:30] i didn't say national revival i said
[33:31] individuals now i said kings and leaders
[33:35] and
[33:35] all men the bible said
[33:38] see that not a national revival but for
[33:41] individuals right
[33:43] that's good look at verse 31. therefore
[33:45] have i poured out my incarnation upon
[33:47] why because nobody was interceding for
[33:49] them right
[33:51] see church god may have allowed this
[33:52] current administration to get in here to
[33:54] make people pray right
[33:56] to wake them up from their slumber i
[33:58] know this i know this current conditions
[34:00] are waking me up from i've been sharing
[34:01] it with my financial sermons these
[34:03] current conditions are waking me up
[34:06] right
[34:06] just attempt just being more temporary
[34:08] being more strict about finances
[34:12] could it be this is a wake-up call for
[34:14] god's people to pray more
[34:16] we'll find out pretty soon the midterms
[34:18] and then the next presidential election
[34:19] we'll find out
[34:20] [Music]
[34:22] oh don't forget yours brother said he
[34:24] liked
[34:25] eisenhower
[34:27] don't forget he was the president who
[34:28] was baptized when he was in office as a
[34:30] presbyterian remember that
[34:32] he went into office and brother brown
[34:34] said he liked him he would have voted
[34:35] for him if he could have ran again but
[34:37] he got baptized when he was in office
[34:39] brother said i like that guy there's
[34:40] nothing wrong with liking good men
[34:43] if they're good men or women
[34:45] right
[34:47] if you were the days of deborah would
[34:48] you like denver being a judge in the
[34:50] politics or not
[34:51] look what she did she got the holy ghost
[34:53] on her she prophesied we're going to go
[34:55] destroy and israel got the victory man
[34:58] a woman just come on george you can say
[35:00] man hey amen
[35:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[35:03] whatever they were in a backseating
[35:04] condition so god had used somebody he
[35:06] raised up a prophetess named deborah
[35:08] praise god that's right true and that
[35:11] king the israel king brother he said i
[35:13] won't even go unless you go
[35:17] oh my goodness praise god yeah
[35:20] that's the power of
[35:21] can i say it that's the power of a
[35:23] spirit-filled woman praise god that's
[35:24] right praise god
[35:26] when she's got the holy spirit on her
[35:28] and she's anointed that man follows her
[35:31] that's right
[35:34] yeah church i understand you gotta see
[35:35] some of those faces not jesus
[35:37] but that's how it wasn't that a day
[35:40] so what is god saying
[35:42] i want to find somebody who will stand
[35:44] the gap between god and a sinful land
[35:47] bless the lord and i'll if i don't find
[35:49] it then i'll pour out wrath that's why
[35:51] time is going on the bible says god has
[35:52] long suffering he's still saving souls
[35:54] why
[35:56] that's right this year lena was baptized
[35:59] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[36:01] brother austin was re-baptized this year
[36:03] that's why that's part of the reason why
[36:04] 2022 had to happen
[36:06] that's part of the reason why the
[36:08] rapture couldn't happen last
[36:11] god it was year suffering he's still
[36:13] saving souls amen
[36:15] when austin shared a message with her
[36:16] she's like do you want to go she's like
[36:18] yes i'm down let's go praise god there
[36:21] was nothing in her heart to deny the
[36:23] word of god she said let's go let's live
[36:25] in the word of god amen
[36:27] [Applause]
[36:28] and who was praying for them the whole
[36:29] time charis
[36:31] acacia haven putting repair requests in
[36:34] every single week for them right and
[36:36] you're all witnesses is that right right
[36:38] you all witnesses praise the lord man
[36:40] see god is long suffering he wants
[36:42] somebody that'll stand together and cry
[36:45] out for sinners cry out for salvation
[36:47] that's what god loves amen
[36:50] hallelujah
[36:53] now church there's there's message

[36:56] revivals i hope i hope so

[39:18] it again
[39:21] amen
[39:22] now do it again bless the name of the
[39:24] lord bill says wait what 20 years or so
[39:27] or more for a revival
[39:28] that's what brother bill told me
[39:30] he said he saw his wife's theophany he
[39:32] told me that last time we seen him
[39:33] praise the lord he was sitting there and
[39:35] he heard his wife's voice and he said he
[39:36] saw his wife writes theophany in the
[39:38] kitchen
[39:38] wow
[39:40] she passed away a couple years ago
[39:43] how are you believing in revival
[39:44] amen
[39:45] there's the first revival there'll be no
[39:47] national revival but we're supposed to
[39:49] pray for souls to be saved anyway
[39:52] and god has vindicated it by answering
[39:54] our prayers about roe v wade
[39:56] absolute vindication
[39:59] absolute
[40:01] second uh kind of revival
[40:04] now this may be the one that will help
[40:06] you friends
[40:08] this is the one that helped me by the
[40:09] way the second type of revival is that
[40:12] the church age revival
[40:14] so what i mean by that there's seven
[40:15] church ages
[40:16] brother brahma was the messenger of the
[40:18] seven church age his ministry brought a
[40:20] holy ghost baptism revival
[40:23] i went to the church yes sir
[40:26] every one of those messengers was a
[40:28] stall
[40:30] in the hand of jesus christ praise god
[40:33] and each man would preach his message
[40:35] and brother and said that message would
[40:37] sound out from the messenger breakdown
[40:39] and he would teach faith amen and then
[40:41] they would go out and they would teach
[40:43] faithful men and spread like wildfire
[40:45] praise god amen went from one to the
[40:47] other to the next and spread and this is
[40:50] the revival that we have right now
[40:52] praise god praise god amen praise god
[40:55] we still have the revival from brother
[40:58] branham's ministry because it's the
[40:59] revival of the soul praise god
[41:04] like brother amen said when he came up
[41:06] here for the holy ghost and when you got
[41:07] the holy ghost when amen come up here
[41:09] sami just laid his head and my amen said
[41:11] that hand felt like it was three times
[41:13] bigger so one very gentle three
[41:15] simon's little hand felt like it was
[41:17] this big
[41:18] right well the
[41:19] and screaming and crying and praising
[41:21] the lord
[41:22] he's never been the same since amen it
[41:24] started a revival where in his soul
[41:27] praise god
[41:28] amen praise the lord
[41:34] amen
[41:38] now the quote to back this up to help
[41:40] you is from harvest time 64. there's
[41:42] lots of them but william won't be from a
[41:43] brother sure will be familiar with this
[41:45] brother and said what day are we living
[41:47] in we've had a 15-year revival how many
[41:49] can say amen to that amen he said one
[41:51] organization raised up none they tried
[41:53] to get me to make an
[41:55] organization brother graham on your
[41:57] ministry
[41:58] now not me i ain't talking about me i'm
[42:01] talking about the message of the hour
[42:03] the message of the day
[42:05] right you'll hear about him say it many
[42:06] times yeah
[42:08] god has given us a revival and it's been
[42:10] going on 15 years and it hasn't died
[42:12] down what's he talking about he's
[42:14] talking about the baptism of the holy
[42:16] ghost revival the message that god gave
[42:19] that star was burning praise god amen
[42:22] and just like the candlestick praise god
[42:24] just let each one each candlestick was
[42:26] pulling on the same oil
[42:28] it's the same oil the same battery the
[42:30] same experience the same life the same
[42:33] joy the same victory the same
[42:35] forgiveness it's the same praise god
[42:38] amen amen
[42:42] hallelujah but i said you cannot
[42:44] denominate this revival you cannot
[42:47] denominate this church because it's the
[42:49] life of jesus christ and it won't
[42:51] compromise it won't denominate it'll
[42:54] keep living and growing getting greater
[42:56] and greater

[43:47] then he has a quote the bride hasn't had
[43:49] a revival yet what do you do with those
[43:51] quotes
[43:52] what do you do we got to go to the
[43:54] scripture
[43:55] if you go to the scripture you find each
[43:57] church age messenger
[43:59] he said what the spirit said to the
[44:00] churches that's right
[44:02] right and then paul paul said the things
[44:05] that i've learned from jesus i've talked
[44:07] to faithful men often yeah that they
[44:09] might teach others oh yes
[44:11] and that's how the word talks about it
[44:13] in great length in the church age book i
[44:15] didn't have time to get the quotes i was
[44:16] going to get the quotes he goes to great
[44:18] lengths to show how god reveals the
[44:20] message to the messenger and then he
[44:21] teaches the group next to him and then
[44:23] the group after that the next generation
[44:25] praise god amen amen hey man

[44:52] came us
[44:54] right i got the holy ghost from brother
[44:55] brooks's ministry
[44:57] he ordained me and approached amen
[44:59] let's just remove what three generations
[45:01] removed praise god
[45:02] from brother ready and i'm preaching the
[45:04] same thing by the way
[45:06] i don't care what these people say i'm
[45:07] preaching the right message praise god
[45:09] amen praise god they can worship the
[45:10] tapes all they want but i will not bow
[45:12] down to any demonic deity spirit i will
[45:15] only worship the lord jesus christ
[45:18] i appreciate the truth but the things
[45:20] point me to the king of kings the one
[45:23] person the eternal person the king of
[45:25] kings who is the absolute and his name
[45:27] is not tape his name is jesus christ
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:39] eternity
[45:44] [Applause]
[45:52] no no although i thank god for the tapes
[45:54] yeah yeah yeah
[45:56] they they really point me let's just
[45:58] like this quote this quote points me to
[46:00] the scripture that's right amen what
[46:01] revival can take place from a seven
[46:03] church age messenger and go on 15 years
[46:06] it has to be the light of the age yeah
[46:09] it actually the message to the church
[46:10] age angel yeah that's good that's right
[46:13] that's good
[46:15] oh like that now you're getting it good
[46:17] i had to get it too it took me a long
[46:18] time yeah get it church get it
[46:21] hallelujah
[46:24] so see
[46:25] now for those people that say the bride
[46:27] hasn't awakened what about recognizing
[46:29] your dangerous message 1964.
[46:31] brother adam says every ministers are
[46:33] complaining everywhere fast pray fast
[46:35] pray yeah he said they have not
[46:36] recognized the awakening of the brain
[46:38] right
[46:40] right so one earlier a year earlier he
[46:42] said he said the bride
[46:44] hasn't had a revival and now he says the
[46:46] bride's awake that's it hallelujah
[46:49] that's it so see we have these quotes
[46:52] and we gotta take all the quotes back to
[46:54] the word praise god see the bride is
[46:56] awakened in the bible the bride is
[46:58] awakened or the foolish or the foolish
[46:59] and wise are awakened when the shout
[47:02] goes out the bridegroom's coming jesus
[47:04] coming get up trip your lips go out to
[47:07] meet jesus christ praise god amen amen
[47:10] surprise and awaken praise god yeah
[47:12] everybody says she's been in revival for
[47:15] 15 years amen
[47:17] if you go back 15 years from 1964
[47:20] all right what's that
[47:21] 15
[47:23] 64 54 49 that's a long time
[47:27] that's way before the quote on the third
[47:29] seal where he said the bride hasn't had
[47:30] a revival yet so see he's talking about
[47:32] a different kind of revival in my
[47:34] opinion he's talking about the latter
[47:36] rain the bride hasn't had the latter
[47:38] rain yet but she'll get it praise god
[47:41] ah but we need first the revival of acts
[47:43] chapter 2 repent be baptized and you
[47:46] shall be filled with the holy ghost amen
[47:48] i believe that's revival you need first
[47:51] praise god and then yes that last
[47:53] revival is coming the bride is revival
[47:55] it'll be a refilling of the holy ghost
[47:57] praise god
[47:59] a lot of science miracles and wonders
[48:00] praise god it'll be the third poem or
[48:02] the opening of the word in the broader
[48:04] it'll be jesus christ in the world
[48:06] preparing her to rapture her off the
[48:08] earth
[48:12] amen
[48:13] that's his name so you got to make the
[48:15] quotes fit yes
[48:17] that's right and if you do that that's
[48:19] this is this is what you come to
[48:20] different kinds of revivals right
[48:23] so the third kind of revival is the
[48:25] bride's revival i call it the latter
[48:27] rain
[48:28] right
[48:29] if you it's the only way to make it make
[48:31] sense right
[48:32] right right
[48:35] so the second the third revival we're
[48:37] talking about is the latter rain
[48:39] it's future it hasn't happened yet right
[48:46] i've even heard you know wonderful
[48:47] preachers today saying we're in the
[48:48] latter rain now impossible no the map
[48:51] says that it can't happen until the
[48:52] squeeze happens
[48:53] that's what brother branson yeah he said
[48:55] you won't see it used in the great waves
[48:56] comes down right this ain't no sweet
[48:58] search no no right we're not physically
[49:01] be wrapped of anything we're not we got
[49:03] actually we brought up too much food
[49:05] right
[49:06] in the church
[49:08] right
[49:10] we're not being tested yet no
[49:12] we're not this ain't this ain't coming
[49:14] down to a scrubbing squeeze yet no
[49:17] see
[49:20] so see when brother says she hasn't had
[49:21] a revival yet
[49:24] he's got to be referring
[49:26] to the latter rain because brotherhood
[49:27] says in the latter rain will come a
[49:29] mount carmel showdown
[49:30] but the second forerunner of christ
[49:32] which is his ministry will
[49:35] sow for the latter rain so brother adam
[49:37] planted for the latter rain that's right
[49:39] hallelujah former rain right he planted
[49:42] he planted for the former or for the
[49:44] latter rain
[49:45] jesus will be the showdown between
[49:46] denominations and creeds that's why
[49:48] church we got to know our bibles more
[49:50] than denominations of the bible
[49:52] because this is a showdown who really
[49:53] believes the bible that's right that's
[49:55] the showdown
[49:57] and with with the renewal i'm sorry with
[49:59] the rest of the word will come
[50:00] restoration of power
[50:04] praise god amen because we got restored
[50:06] word we'll have the restored power
[50:08] praise god
[50:10] we've seen god's power this last year
[50:12] we've seen god heal people
[50:14] we've seen god answer prayers like that
[50:16] right we've seen god open up the windows
[50:18] of heaven
[50:20] and for our blessings we can hardly
[50:21] receive
[50:22] that's right
[50:24] hallelujah
[50:25] that's right church
[50:29] he said jesus will come back to back up
[50:32] his word and take his bride in the
[50:34] rapture the first showdown was mark
[50:36] mount carmel second was not
[50:37] transfiguration the third will be mount
[50:39] zion
[50:40] remember mount zion was the one david
[50:42] nobody ever conquered nobody never
[50:44] conquered zion
[50:45] so david became king of hebron and when
[50:47] he was becoming king of all jerusalem he
[50:49] said whoever goes into zion
[50:52] whoever
[50:53] uh whoever conquers this he said i'll
[50:55] make him rule over my army wasn't it
[50:57] joab
[50:58] how'd you get in there he got him
[50:59] through there through a secret passage
[51:02] didn't jesus say when you pray go in the
[51:04] secret place
[51:05] how do you conquer in some
[51:07] insurmountable obstacles through the
[51:09] secret place amen
[51:11] that's right
[51:12] i love that
[51:14] how do you get victory over
[51:15] insurmountable odds humble yourself
[51:18] that's right do the secret find the
[51:20] secret way
[51:21] find a secret place where you can get
[51:23] through and you can break through the
[51:25] barriers and get the victory and if you

[54:57] right so when romans says we need a
[55:00] refilling of the holy ghost for the
[55:01] rapture he's talking about in the mind

[55:29] first feeling will come back that's what

[56:12] the bible says
[56:13] sure the former ladder rain joel 2 says
[56:16] are going to come
[56:17] like in the first month that means as it
[56:18] was at the beginning sure yeah so we're
[56:21] getting the holy ghost like we did the
[56:22] first time it's going to be like the
[56:24] same way
[56:27] what a day that will be
[56:32] when i look upon his face the one who
[56:34] saved me by amazing grace
[56:37] then he takes me by the head
[56:40] and leads me through the promised land
[56:43] what a day glorious day
[56:46] i just want him to take my hand in the
[56:47] air i kind of want to feel what it's
[56:48] like you know i'm walking on air
[56:52] i don't know if i get a chance but you
[56:54] know all the saints will be there i'll
[56:54] be in the very back you know but maybe
[56:56] i'll get a chance to come up to the
[56:57] front and shake his head after paul and
[56:59] the saints and all the disciples
[57:01] hallelujah amen amen
[57:05] so this is a fourth kind of revival the
[57:07] one we can have every single day this is
[57:09] the one the new testament writers were
[57:10] writing about this daily revival of the
[57:12] money that's right sure
[57:14] sure don't get tired of doing good
[57:15] habits
[57:16] just get a revival with those habits oh
[57:19] praise god say lord make the bible
[57:21] reading feel new again yeah lord make
[57:23] the prayer laws that feel fresh again

[57:36] strengths
[57:40] help me jesus
[57:42] i love it amen but i have taught this
[57:45] thing how can i overcome 1963.
[57:49] he said i want to take my subject this
[57:50] morning how can i overcome now i chose
[57:52] this because that i think it's at a time
[57:54] we should never let the spirit of
[57:55] revival die that's right whoa what do
[57:58] you mean brother what do you mean you're
[57:59] going to lose your salvation your soul
[58:01] that's not what he's talking about no
[58:04] you cannot the bible says your soul is
[58:06] sealed unto
[58:08] the david
[58:09] look up the word seal sometime in the
[58:11] bible you'll never see you lose your
[58:13] seal let me see no
[58:15] no just so you got an idea it could be
[58:17] such an easy search there's only 32
[58:19] verses in the whole new testament take
[58:20] your bible tomorrow morning if you have
[58:21] anything planned to study and take your
[58:23] bible concord to type in seal and just
[58:25] read all the verses about see i
[58:27] challenge you you'll never find a verse
[58:29] that says you lose your seal
[58:31] because it is god's glory it is god's
[58:33] permanent mark on your soul right god
[58:36] comes down he comes past the body and he
[58:38] goes past the mind and he goes deeper
[58:41] deeper down that rider with the inquirer
[58:42] by the way
[58:44] he takes that penalty of the holy spirit
[58:46] and he writes thus saying the lord on
[58:47] your soul he marks you your gods for all
[58:50] time and all eternity praise god amen
[58:53] yes
[58:54] praise god
[58:56] i seal you i stamp you i permanently
[58:59] mark you i permanently brand you you are
[59:02] god's property you're the bride of jesus
[59:04] christ praise god you're oh you're over
[59:06] every devil in hell you're sealed
[59:08] nothing can shake you nothing can stop
[59:10] you you're sealed to your redemption
[59:12] praise god amen amen one day you'll get
[59:15] a mind and a body that matches your soul
[59:21] will get the same amount of soul the
[59:23] soul that cannot sin will give us a mind
[59:26] that cannot sin a body that cannot save
[59:28] then we'll be just like him when we see
[59:30] him
[59:43] we should never let the spirit of
[59:44] revival die he's talking about in your
[59:46] mind
[59:47] [Music]
[59:48] we got to keep a revival constantly
[59:50] revived every day now look at the verse
[59:52] he says yeah paul said he had to die
[59:58] you finished a quote for me
[1:00:00] i didn't know you got a memory
[1:00:03] paul said he had to die daily that
[1:00:05] christ could live
[1:00:07] yes
[1:00:08] and we must never let that revival die
[1:00:11] within us
[1:00:13] to see program taught this he taught all
[1:00:15] of all these quotes about rival there's
[1:00:16] hundreds of quotes about rival sure but
[1:00:18] the one that struggles people well the
[1:00:20] bride doesn't have everybody
[1:00:21] oh have you had a revival going on in 15
[1:00:23] years people struggle with that but they
[1:00:25] got to go back to the word of god
[1:00:27] when you go back to the word of god the
[1:00:28] soul is sealed it's revived one time
[1:00:31] that's right i challenge anybody show me
[1:00:33] where the soul loses it's sealed it
[1:00:36] can't lose its seed oh
[1:00:37] no that's the whole point of it a
[1:00:39] permanent mark your robbery he bought
[1:00:42] you with the price he's claiming you as
[1:00:44] his he will not lose one christ
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:50] the son of man will not lose one of this
[1:00:53] praise god
[1:00:54] it's impossible praise god because they
[1:00:56] came out of this mind they're foreknown
[1:00:58] right i challenge anybody show me a
[1:01:00] verse where you lose your seal that's
[1:01:02] not where the real that's not where the
[1:01:03] refilling refilling happens that's in
[1:01:05] the human mind right
[1:01:07] oh glory i feel good now hallelujah
[1:01:14] see what you got to see what scripture
[1:01:15] is about random use when he talks about
[1:01:17] revival when he talks about seal to the
[1:01:18] day of your redemption
[1:01:20] see
[1:01:21] you never see it there's four you can't
[1:01:23] really see that there's at least four
[1:01:24] maybe five revivals the flesh that's
[1:01:26] dead can be revived raised from the dead

[1:05:20] again
[1:05:21] no no ephesians 1 13 after you heard the
[1:05:23] word of truth you were sealed with that
[1:05:25] holy spirit of promise i
[1:05:28] said pull up second corinthians 1 22
[1:05:29] this is the one i always forget it's
[1:05:31] always like that hidden gem it's that
[1:05:32] hidden verse about the sealing of god
[1:05:36] who have also sealed us
[1:05:38] doesn't say many times
[1:05:40] sealed us and given the earnest of the
[1:05:43] spirit in our hearts praise god
[1:05:46] sealed us
[1:05:48] sealed quickened it's always one time
[1:05:51] but then he says renew your mind day by
[1:05:53] day every day renew your mind
[1:05:55] transform die daily
[1:05:58] my soul wait
[1:05:59] look how confused they would be you were
[1:06:01] dead your soul was dead and it's
[1:06:02] quickened and then you got your soul's
[1:06:03] got to die every day that's all we know
[1:06:06] no it makes no sense no
[1:06:08] no
[1:06:10] your soul was dead had no life in it
[1:06:12] you're baptized with the holy ghost now
[1:06:13] you saw his life and it's alive
[1:06:15] forevermore
[1:06:17] it's the spirit of christ amen amen
[1:06:20] that means your nature will always say
[1:06:22] amen to the spirit of christ amen to the
[1:06:24] word of christ amen
[1:06:27] that's right
[1:06:32] the token 1964 this is february
[1:06:35] brother ram said
[1:06:36] if god ever healed you you live long
[1:06:38] enough you're going to get sick again
[1:06:40] yeah
[1:06:41] yeah that's right but if one time you
[1:06:43] take that token you've had it forever
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:47] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:06:49] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[1:06:50] redemption that's good not to the next
[1:06:52] revival you all see no no
[1:06:55] no
[1:06:57] you got emotionally worked up no but
[1:07:00] you're dead and your life is hitting
[1:07:02] christ through god and you're sealed by
[1:07:04] the holy ghost if you are once baptized
[1:07:06] in that holy spirit now you can
[1:07:08] backslide that's true but you can't get
[1:07:10] away from that seal you're sealed into
[1:07:12] it praise god that's it there it is
[1:07:15] there it is
[1:07:16] one time you're sealed forever you're
[1:07:19] sealed eternally in the soul
[1:07:21] but then you backslide in your mind
[1:07:23] every day that's why paul said renew
[1:07:25] your mind every day read your bible
[1:07:27] every day
[1:07:29] or listen to it at least
[1:07:31] it's better if you're not driving then
[1:07:33] you're distracted by driving
[1:07:35] lit read it in your home praise god
[1:07:38] isn't god worthy of some time in the
[1:07:39] morning when you wake up and be worthy
[1:07:40] to spend time with her sure of course oh

[1:08:01] you'd be surprised how many people think
[1:08:02] you can be resealed and baptized yeah
[1:08:04] and again and again
[1:08:06] that goes against this quote yeah you're
[1:08:07] not sealed to the next revival let's

[1:08:12] i'm only seeing once praise god amen

[1:08:47] if i get something quick in that mission
[1:08:48] this is my note this is my last quote on
[1:08:50] the notes the god might have different
[1:08:52] numbers
[1:08:56] yeah he says now the soul of man is not
[1:08:58] the body of man it's the soul the soul
[1:09:00] is something that's the nature of the
[1:09:02] spirit yeah so body spirit but inside of
[1:09:06] the spirit deeper is the soul that's it
[1:09:10] and then he says we are dead this
[1:09:13] scripture plainly tells that we're dead
[1:09:15] and our lives are hitting god through
[1:09:16] christ sealed there by the holy spirit
[1:09:19] praise the lord
[1:09:21] now it wasn't your body who died it
[1:09:23] wasn't your spirit that died no
[1:09:26] oh so now we know where we're dying
[1:09:28] we're dying
[1:09:29] to unbelief in the soul right
[1:09:34] it was the nature of your spirit that
[1:09:36] died or your soul
[1:09:38] see the nature which is the soul right
[1:09:40] the nature of your soul is god if you're
[1:09:42] born again
[1:09:45] anything that begin has to end so
[1:09:48] therefore the only way you can have
[1:09:49] eternal life is to have the life that
[1:09:51] never did begin
[1:09:56] let's stand to our feet
[1:09:58] musicians can come
[1:10:06] praise god
[1:10:07] how many can see there's lots of
[1:10:09] different kinds of revivals sure
[1:10:11] i wasn't even thinking of more and i
[1:10:12] forgot them now now that i was preaching
[1:10:13] other things but i was thinking of a few
[1:10:14] more revivals actually
[1:10:17] for church there's at least five
[1:10:18] revivals
[1:10:20] and the one i'm asking you is the will
[1:10:22] get the one renew your mind today
[1:10:26] renew your mind
[1:10:28] get motivated in your mind i'm going to
[1:10:30] do this for the lord
[1:10:32] i'm going to i'm going to seek the face
[1:10:33] of god yeah
[1:10:35] i'm going to draw closer to god true
[1:10:40] like i preach on the the uh
[1:10:44] the double portion a couple weeks ago
[1:10:46] first one went in on the double portion
[1:10:47] but man said if you've got a double
[1:10:48] portion he said you'll have double the
[1:10:50] effort
[1:10:51] now think about that for me
[1:10:54] what effort did you give to seek god's
[1:10:56] face today if you got a double anointing
[1:10:57] brother ramp said you'd do double than
[1:10:59] what you did today that's right and the
[1:11:00] church said hey
[1:11:02] man hallelujah
[1:11:04] i know i go on this every service i i
[1:11:06] got to i gotta give you fired up
[1:11:08] it's my job yes it is to point you to
[1:11:11] the word to lead you to green pastures
[1:11:14] where is the green pasture going to be
[1:11:15] when you're feeding on the word
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:18] right where's the still water is going
[1:11:20] to be when you're in his presence it's
[1:11:21] right man
[1:11:23] the stillness is the sweetness of the
[1:11:25] holy spirit right beautiful
[1:11:28] yes it is glory amen

[1:11:43] revivals

[1:13:19] for sunday
[1:13:21] i found a good thought from a i actually
[1:13:23] caught a good thought from a baptist
[1:13:24] preaching like oh my goodness i've never
[1:13:25] seen that thought before so i'll give
[1:13:27] you a little preview okay all right
[1:13:29] preach no more on sunday lord willing if
[1:13:31] the lord chairs
[1:13:32] i'm going to show all the different
[1:13:34] descriptions the bible gives well this
[1:13:36] is a beautiful thought
[1:13:37] all the descriptions gifts
[1:13:40] of the judas is scared group
[1:13:43] they're called
[1:13:44] castaway they're called shipwrecked
[1:13:48] they're called reprobate yeah they're
[1:13:50] called falling away they're called
[1:13:51] apostates oh yeah
[1:13:53] the bible says they turn back right
[1:13:55] there's all these now church the
[1:13:56] beautiful part is that will never be us
[1:13:58] because
[1:14:00] [Applause]
[1:14:10] as hebrews says amen but we are those of
[1:14:13] those who keep the faith and press on
[1:14:16] and we the bible said we receive the end
[1:14:18] of our faith
[1:14:20] [Applause]
[1:14:21] we receive the end of it praise god amen
[1:14:24] i'll give you a little taste there okay
[1:14:25] there's your little forte society
[1:14:28] oh it's a beautiful thought i never
[1:14:29] heard i've never seen that thought
[1:14:30] before
[1:14:31] and it's perfect brother says this was
[1:14:33] the group that had the name on the
[1:14:34] lamb's book of life but had it blotted
[1:14:36] out
[1:14:39] for all these reasons and gives so many
[1:14:41] they were they were planted but then the
[1:14:43] bible says in jude they're uprooted
[1:14:45] they're plucked up by the roots
[1:14:47] yeah
[1:14:49] so instead of remaining planted in the
[1:14:50] word planted in church planted in
[1:14:54] prayer instead of reigning planting in
[1:14:57] those they uprooted that and then i'm
[1:14:58] not going to be playing with that
[1:14:59] anymore but the bible said the believers
[1:15:01] is planted by rivers of living water
[1:15:03] amen oh leave one amen
[1:15:07] glory
