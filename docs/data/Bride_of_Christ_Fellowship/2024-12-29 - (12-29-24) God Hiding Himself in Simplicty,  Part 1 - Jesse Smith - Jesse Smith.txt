========================================

all those message songs here so we looked at recognizing your day we've looked preached through recognizing your day serpent seed perfect Faith the breach the message of grace and the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery so today I want to start God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same Hallelujah just a beautiful uh sermon here brother R preached it's a three-hour sermon as you turn there Matthew 11:25-26 if you haven't listened to it I would encourage you to do it this is the Sunday morning service of the Seven Seals uh week long uh services that they had by God's grace this was also a dedication uh service here for the newly constructed brandham Tabernacle and I'm going to show you pictures I'm going to show you Lord willing today videos of when Jose brother Aon and I and brother William went to brandham Tabernacle in 2018 so my it's hard to believe four five six almost seven years ago brother hard to believe uh but we're thankful for God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah Matthew 1125 and 26 I'll read 25 and then we can all read 26 together by God's grace if you're there say amen amen at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee so he's praying I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast reveal them unto babes now let's read verse 26 1 2 3 even so father for it seem good in thy side amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated praise God let's get this ready to go casa that way I don't have any uh problems here let's see if this will work here by God's grace I'm going have to adjust okay perfect perfect so some of you sarpong girls get to see Grandpa beatric gets to see husband on the slideshow today by God's grace he's looking good he's looking real good by God's grace Jose's looking really good too young strong handsome healthy by the grace of the Lord thankful for all God's blessings Hallelujah so I just you know I just thought it'd be good to revisit this here and um look at this sermon here it's a three-hour long sermon U brother BR takes about the first hour and he dedicates it to uh talking about the Tabernacle it's been under construction and let's see if uh so that's this is before the construction there in 1963 that's what the brandom Tabernacle looked like uh by the grace of God uh brother R said people made fun of it and said it's just a garage and all these things like that but uh God was with them Hallelujah let people make fun let people criticize let people say whatever they want if God's with you who can be against you Hallelujah God's with you you're more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus Hallelujah and God has always uh even in the days of of Ezra Nehemiah you know God said don't despise the day of small things right so there's days of great things like we'd say the Open Door Church age the sixth Church age of uh Philadelphia that was a day of great things brother B said the greatest sermons The Greatest preachers the greatest books that were ever written some of the biggest churches like brother rod and I went down to Oberlin there uh L summer and uh Charles Fin's church was a massive Church beautiful church it's one of the most beautiful churches I've ever had the honor and privilege to step into uh just beautiful seats everything was uh the pulpit was beautiful everything I should have brought pictures of that I forgot to bring that maybe next time uh brother mam said Charles finny was a mighty man of God right here in Ohio right here in Ohio uh because he preached he said he had one of the greatest revivals since St Paul right here in Ohio so I'm thankful God placed me in Ohio I can have some of that Revival by God's grace I do have it Hallelujah but it's a it was a day of small things uh we'd say uh because it's the end of the church age right and Jesus said it's going to get fewer and fewer uh till uh the gospel goes around the world and then the last one gets saved the last one who wants the Holy Ghost we'll get the Holy Ghost praise God and then Jesus will come he'll snatch arazo he'll snatch away his bride and then pour out the wrath of God I put out a video about that yesterday about the order of events for the uh Great Tribulation period so it just it's humbling by God's grace it's it's humbling to think about what uh God's going to uh bring upon this unbelieving world so we should be thankful that God's revealed the truth unto us babes such as would learn we're spiritual babies Hallelujah in one way other words we can't compare to our great father we never will be able to compare to our great father as far as his infinite knowledge his grace and his power his ways are past finding out Hallelujah and so in in our sight we should always be humble we should always be like a little children that that can uh learn from the Lord that want to know more about God hallelujah so we read our text there of Jesus of course praying and he had just got done rebuking all those cities that had rejected him he said it'll be more tolerable on the day of Sodom a bunch of hor mongering sodomites it'll be more tolerable for them they'll have a a less punishment on the day of judgment than the people that maybe weren't sodomites but rejected the ministry of Jesus Christ amazing truth there I don't know how to explain that also I know it's an amazing truth that this gospel have must have been so powerful uh that even people that would live we'd say s uh normally uh nice lives uh holy lives yet they would get a worse punishment than even homosexuals because they rejected the word of God it should encourage us to receive the word of God today Hallelujah every Miracle God does every truth he gives us we should receive it and say thank God for it amen and say God give me more of it hallelujah we're not going to be like Leo DEA where we we don't have any we don't have any more need of anything we should we should uh we should not have that attitude we should have an attitude where I need more of God I'm hungry for the things of God I desire the things of God hallelujah Glory so the first hour will be a dedication if you get a chance to listen to it he has a he reads some scripture we'll get to it probably the next service here and then uh he starts preaching a he says I'm only going to preach for an hour but he preaches two hours so that's pretty good that's what I say when I say I'm going to close I usually need about 30 more minutes brother B said I'm going to close he G gave one more hour of preaching Hallelujah so I like that uh the first hours dedication and then in two hours sermon that was in the morning and then in the evening he preached the breach between the church ages and the Seven Seals which I already preached that to you by God's grace it was kind of in that order of the song so we got it on the YouTube if you'd like to listen to that so he begins here um in God hiding himself he begins by thanking brother Neville he said good morning friends I certainly deem this one of the highlights of my life to be in the Tabernacle again this morning to see its beautiful structure and the Order of the children of God setting in his house today so brother Ram this is the picture brother had in his mind all these years uh before 19 March of 1963 early 1963 remember he left Jeffersonville uh in December I'm sorry um it would have been December no it would have been January 1st of 1963 he left there was gone three months and then he came back in March so he'd been gone three months January February March three and a half months because he gets there on the 17th of March 1963 and in 3 months time they had a tremendous transformation as we'll see it by God God's grace you'll see it uh what they did is they expanded uh that way I think it's to the north side of the church I've been there numerous times now they expanded it by 30% and they finished the construction in March of 1963 and brother man said I was so astonished when I got here yesterday and seen the looks of the building I never dreamed it would be this way and brother uh brother we've been there brother Jose we never dreamed it right we got to experience uh what brother BR never dreamed uh his church would look like by the grace of God I encourage you I encourage everybody to go to brandom Tabernacle if you haven't been there I would encourage you to try to get there by God's grace you'll be blessed you'll be see you you'll see I'm going to show it today you'll see the Simplicity you'll see the humility of Christ makes you appreciate the Lord and all that God has done through brother Brandon's Ministry he said I never dreamed I saw the blueprints uh and I just seen a little room sitting on the other side so brother saw the blueprints where they would just draw another uh they'd have another room over here on the side he said but I never imagined he said I find what a beautiful place we're sitting in I'm grateful to almighty God for this beautiful place and then he says this morning I'm bringing greetings from my wife and my children who long to be here at this time for this dedicational service a week of consecration to Christ now we've never done that at our church I've never uh felt the leading of the Lord to do that but perhaps I will in the future they had Services Sunday to Sunday every day two on the first Sunday two on the last Sunday that's quite a a number of services right and he called it a week of consecration but he said my children are in school and it's hard to get away uh so think about this think about this uh the Seven Seals was fulfilling I believe Revelation 10 1:7 God was stepping down and revealing the open book through the Seven Seals and brother Braham didn't feel L the Lord to have his wife and children come to the revelation of the Seven Seals isn't that something his wife and children stayed in Arizona for school purposes while brother alone came to do that so I just want you to to see what a emphasis brother brandham placed on education now of course he balls out if youve listen to any sermons lately he balls out doctors of divinity and PhD scientists because Mo most of the time they try to they try to discourage your faith in God right that's why brother R balls out education and Science and all these things but in in but in his in his daily actions with his family education was very important CH church let me say this we we should give our children the best education we can because they never know you'll never know how God's going to use it don't slack on education if you slack as parents if we slack on education that shows our children our attitude towards learning and then how are they going to learn when they get on a job and they got to go to maybe they got to go to trade school how are they goingon to what's their attitude going to be it's probably going to be a lazy attitude if we slack on educating our children but look at brother B's example I left my children I you know and he tells us later revelation 10 1-7 is history it's already it's going to be fulfilled in this week but yet his wife and children have the important duty of staying true to their educational foundations Hallelujah and this wasn't just something brother Ram did once numerous times if you L listen to the message brother Ram would do this later on the same year at the end of 1963 uh brother Ram's preaching Look Away to Jesus that's a powerful message on on the uh the third poll and the squeeze that's the sermon brother man preached the longest on The Squeeze he talks about the five times the third poll was used but he says this and Look Away to Jesus he says I'm going home tomorrow so this was a Sunday he said I'm going home on Monday so he won't be here for the New Year's meeting but we're remembering you I believe there'll be a meeting here on New Year's night that's right a watch Service as they always have a New Year's night we'd like to stay but we just can't get back in time to get the kides in school and my wife has got to wash up their clothes you know how it is so any parent with children knows how it is brother Ram couldn't stay for the watch Night Service at Brenham Tabernacle at the end of 1963 CU they had to wash clothes and get ready for school and the church said see we only hear sometimes we only hear one side of brother Ram sermons on on on school or education how come we don't hear this side well you hear it if you're a real child of God hallelujah like somebody sent me a uh a quote this week where brother baham said um brother Braham said something about how Sunday school isn't in the word of God and it's not right you don't you don't see the early church uh starting Sunday school look up Sunday school does anyone see Sunday School in the book of Acts no And so there's times brother man is bringing out he's being a little critical of it and it's not in the word of God that's because denomination sometimes place too much on that but then other quotes uh he tells the parents he said it's a sin just to take your children to Sunday school and the brother texted me and said why is it a sin to take your children to Sunday school I said keep reading the quote brother R said it's a sin just to take your kids to Sunday school and you don't go to Sunday school Hallelujah in other words brother said there was he knew families that would just drop their kids off for Sunday school and leave and go to the grocery store or just go home and do something in other words everybody needs to learn the word of God hallelujah adults children everybody should be in the house of God hallelujah so you got you got quotes on both sides and then in this sermon brother B says I've been criticized we don't have rooms for Sunday school he said but now we got them see the devil is always going to find something to criticize the people of God on for years they said oh just a small little building they don't have Sunday school rooms what kind of a how could this man be a prophet they couldn't afford it Hallelujah said we had to have all these people move in when all these people he said most of our church isn't even from Jeffersonville he said God had to send people into Jeffersonville just so they could build on to the church and afford a little better building praise God oh but see if God wants to do something wait on the Lord God will provide every need every need every every penny every dollar if God's going to do it God will provide it Hallelujah that's right so see here's just two quotes So for the Seven Seals and then later on the year the end of uh 1963 the watch night services brother Brandon missed services to get the kids ready for school Hallelujah remember there's that that great quote brother Ram says he says after to if you want it you can add you can text me later like Jose always does that's good good job Jose brother man says it he says I wish I didn't have to send my children to these evil high schools I'm just paraphrase it he said but you know what no matter if we were in high school or my children were out on an Indian Reservation he said whatever's inside of them is going to come out Hallelujah got the balance right brother says oh there's awful things at the high school but then he says there's also awful things out there on the Indian Reservation see I've seen this week people have tried to they you ever seen it they try to move off grid there's this young uh generation of you young married couples their whole their whole desire life is to move away from all the electricity and and yet somehow they move away from electricity then they post internet videos I don't understand that that's hypocrisy they say they want to get out from the grid but then they get back into the grid right so they try to get off the grid but then they want to be a part of the grid to make money but brother says no matter where you are sin's going to find you out think about Cain and Abel there was hardly any sin really I mean that's was the very beginning and what happened murder still came out of that and their parents were Adam and Eve their parents could tell them about the the pillar of fire uh the logos the spirit of God God talking I was talking face to face with God's logos and even that wasn't enough so it depends on what seed you are amen thank God for the seed of God today Hallelujah you ought to Rejoice if you got the seed of God and how you know you got the seed of God brother said you want to do everything according to the word of God the spirit of God will never lead you outside of the Bible brother R said it over and over again the spirit of God will always lead you to the Bible not away from the Bible Hallelujah so this was common brother Ram often dedicated his uh schedule to when his children were in school then he goes into talk talking about his friends he says I appreciate friends everywhere but there's something about old friends no matter where you make new friends it's still isn't the old and brother R starts crying thinking about the old friends he had at brandom Tabernacle all those years ago he said no matter wherever I'd roam this spot will always be sacred how many know what I'm talking about Hallelujah when we first started our church there uh on water and the other roads even up there where Jose used to live what was the name of that road brother you remember MO Drive God bless you you got a good memory brother those places sometimes I drive by there even waterl Road there's that that Village Discount sometimes I drive by there and I just say thank the Lord those are sacred places to me God met me there God heard my prayers there God healed the sick there uh that's where some of my children got saved those are sacred places hallelujah amen any place where God meets you it's kind of like Jacob you want to set up an altar Hallelujah let's set up an altar let's worship God God's met me Hallelujah God's been with me he's been faithful Hallelujah so these are sacred places where God meets you and brother bam said for about 30 years ago in a Muddy Pond bed I dedicated this piece of ground to Jesus Christ and it wasn't nothing but a mud bed so if you've ever seen uh you know that the brandom Tabernacle there right now it's all flat and everything but before that this was there was a pond there a mud Pond and brother raham tells us there was lies growing out of it he said that's this was all a pond that's the reason the streets out of cader there the road had to go around to get away from the pond that was there and here there used to be lies Pond Lies come up remember this is also the same place where brother brandom saw a vision of Jesus Christ when he was a little boy remember when he was a little boy his dad was making him pack uh uh all the water for the the wine and the whiskey and everything like that one time he stopped right here and this is where he saw Jesus Christ in a sage field down here by the pond this is the first time amen where he saw Jesus Hallelujah and he passed out and and he woke up uh in the morning you know so he was he was basically sleeping all night because he saw the Lord Jesus right here amen that's a shame to see what they've done to it but uh God had foretold God and church if you look at it a lot of times the the children of prophets get off the word of God in the Bible right a lot you got to look at the Bible because Satan is attacking them so hard he points all his guns as we said he points all of his guns on the family of the Prophet so we got to be in prayer of course continue to pray I continue to pray for them brother Bram said uh he said there would be lies Pond Lies come up here the LI is a very strange flower though it's though it's born in mud it has to press its way through the mud and then through the waters and slime to get itself up to the top to show its beauty Glory hallelujah amen and I think this morning that's a whole lot of what's happened here that since that time a little Pond Lily has pushed itself and when it got to the top of the water it spread its wings forth its little pedals went out and it reflected the lily of the valley so brother said there was lies on this Pond where the church was and it reminded him of the lily of the valley in the scripture which we'll get to so here's the current brandom Tabernacle so it was expanded so basically this section right here was added on this whole section on the the we'd say for us it's the left side or the North side I believe of the building here so that's the current bream Tabernacle today so when you walk in right in the front there's a small little vegetable you go to either side off to this side is the mother's room uh I forget what's off to the side there I don't remember that one and then after that you both sides move around to the sanctuary you have the sanctuary here long sanctuary and then the back then you have we'll show it to you the baptismal room uh and then the uh the communion room where we got the bread and the wine the baptismal and on the very far back right side is the pastor's study very simple Church very humble Church by the grace of God hallelujah but to me it's a sacred Place Hallelujah because the word that came out of this church has transformed my life and I'll say like this it's changed my destination Hallelujah because in my mind I was determined to go a certain way with whatever church but when the message came to me it changed my destiny and now I'll take my way with the Lord's despise for few Hallelujah people can despise me whatever want but I've got a Bible I know what the Bible says and I know the Bible is thus sayith the Lord hallelujah so people can say whatever they want Hallelujah now I don't know if these were the lies or not church I just typed in Indiana Pon lies that's all I typed into the internet and this is what came up so perhaps this was the lies so perhaps brother Ram saw a pond of Lies like this and brother Ram said your life is like a lily you start off your life in sin in the mud and muck of sin but you you've got to grow up pretty you want to show everybody uh the beauty inside you right I'm not talking about the natural I'm talking about the Christ in you and so you've got to grow up you got to grow into God and pretty soon you you'll break the top of the water but you're not done yet you still got a blossom you still got to Blossom and and then give out your fragrance give out your beauty in this case to all the the flies that would pass by or the Birds uh that would help pollinate this or the bats whatever it may be the different Wildlife that would need this you got to you got to Blossom and express your love to God and then people coming by people in your life can say wow that's a real Christian Hallelujah I enjoy fellowshipping with brother so- and so I enjoy fellowshipping with sister so and so why because you've expressed the beauty of Christ and the Beauties out there it's just for other people to enjoy amen the beauty of your life is just for other people to enjoy the life that you live for Christ so people can look at that person say that's a real if I ever met somebody that really loves God it's that brother or sister hallelujah hallelujah now if I show you when I next I'll show you the picture of the lily of the valley so look now look at this study this and you've probably seen these on ponds before you know if you go to different ponds and uh even Parks you know you'll see different lies growing up and brother Ram said it was lies but he said it reminded him of lies of the Valley now these are much smaller plants but they can go pretty tall If You Ever Seen The Lily of Valley so these are very small pedals okay so brother R he's just making a connection there was lies on the pond and it reminded him of the word lily of the valley Hallelujah and so the Indiana water lily and the lily of the valley they're not even in the same plant family totally different families they're only share the name Lily because of their appearance and Beauty so somebody you know who was over in Jerusalem or whatever uh who you know whichever Englishman came to United States and then they saw Pond Lily you know they say oh that's beautiful like a lily they just gave it the name of the Lily but it's not even actually in the family of the lily of the valley it's just given the name Lily Hallelujah because of the beauty and its appearance Lil of the valleys are much smaller of course now the Bible uses the lies 15 times eight of them are in the Song of Solomon so this one right here Song of Solomon 2:2 and a lily among Thorns so is my love among the daughters Hallelujah so these lies were uh they were so uh what's the word I'm looking for uh they were so versatile that's the word I'm looking for Glory these lies could grow anywhere they could grow in the forest they could grow in the valley they could grow amongst thorns and that's the way a Christian is hallelujah a Christian can can be around non-christians and still give off the beauty of the Lily the valley Hallelujah no matter where you grow they grow all over the place lies of the valley even grow in Aran Ohio praise God they grew up they grow in Liberty Center Ohio Hallelujah they grow all over the place and that's what the thing about the Lily the valley they'll grow almost anywhere praise God so the first time it's recorded where Solomon says as the Lily among Thorns so is my love so so Solomon found his wife there the shulamite Solomon found her remember he he was he was just riding by in his car and all these women and men are working the fields they're just you know the peasants of the world but he saw this one beautiful woman and he said you're like the Lily that grows amongst all of these Thorns I wish Lily was here she could hear her name about 50 times in the sermon hopefully she's streaming by God's grace Lily have a beautiful scriptural Name by God's grace Hallelujah and that's what Solon said it's like I'm just riding along there's Thorns everywhere there's maybe rose bushes or just thorns and there's a beautiful lily of the valley in the midst of all this pain and suffering that's what Christ is to us Christ is our Lily the valley amongst all the Thorns of this life and that's what you can be to those who need it to Sinners around you you can be a lily of the valley as well Hallelujah among Thorns that's what I try to be I try to be as a teacher in the public school I try to be a lily amongst all the Thorns right all the evil influences kids will tell me I watch this and I'll say oh I'm so sorry you watch that those things break my heart heart you know I just try to influence them in any way I can to be a lily to be sweet uh to give off the right fragrance to show the Beauty and the character of Jesus Christ Hallelujah amongst Thorns Song of Solomon 6 verse2 my beloved has gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the garden and to gather the lies so Salon would go down and he'd pick out these lies just for his wife there's a good tip for Mali when he starts cing a girl here by God's grace pick her some beautiful flowers and they say where's Solomon oh he's down there picking the lies of the valley he's picking them he going to have all these they look like beautiful Bells don't they like golden bells or white Bells you know he's down there picking them because they're so beautiful I'm going to start looking for these coming up here in Spring by God's grace see if they grow around us so they were so beautiful that even a king would go out looking for these beautiful flowers Hallelujah now I know after this I'm going to get a good text from my wife explain to me where I miss taught about the lily of the valley so thank you hun if you're watching I know you'll help me I'm just basing all this on my internet research here I don't have any experience in Jerusalem I don't have any experience really with Pond llies other than seeing them Hosea 14:5 says I will be as the doe unto Israel he shall grow as the Lily and cast forth his roots as a Lebanon because remember lies in the valley grew anywhere so uh God said grow as a lily does so wherever you're planted grow there stay planted in Christ and grow up and show your beauty right there in was it Garfield High School is that what high school what is it Garfield High School yes sir uh Middle School sister Anna you right there in the Middle School you grow up amongst all these Thorns you grow up and you show the beauty of the lily of the valley Hallelujah that's we're going to see all these all these parts have have symbolism behind them grow up wherever you are understand God placed you there for a purpose Hallelujah like when we were at the state championship game a few weeks ago I got I love those times I got to testify about Jesus about five times I walk out there feeling like I was in a church service because I don't get influence and I saw three or four of my older friends and I went up to each one I think I told you this already but I tapped him on I said do you serve Jesus each one I felt like I was a witnessing machine right there by God's grace and I even told the one guy his name is Andy I said Andy I'm a preacher now and his eyes got be you're a preacher CU in high school I was no I was not a servant of the Lord at all I was a very Wicked person he said you're a preacher I I said yes I'm a preacher I preach sometimes three sometimes five days a week and his eyes got really big I said I love Jesus and this is what I want to be I want to be a I want to be a testimony I want to show forth the character of Jesus Christ the righteousness of Jesus Christ praise God I want to grow up wherever God planted me and I want to show the people the character and the expression the beauty of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen Matthew 6:28 and why take you thought for Rond why you worried about the new clothes consider the lies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin so it's effortless growth it's not straining oh I hope to grow now I hope I can grow I hope I can be beautiful someday no you just say planted where you are just taking the sunlight the water just taking what God has already provided for you and you're going to grow up into a beautiful Christian praise God am that's right they don't toil these lies they don't toil and fighting and everything like that try to be white try to be have a good fragrance try to grow they just grow Hallelujah so that brother M uses rest for that he said we have to rest in Christ and not let not let anxieties get to us we have to rest in the forn knowledge the sovereignty of God if God planted me here he's going to feed me he's going to take care of me he's going to make sure I grow to be what he called me to be hallelujah amen amen you know my wife was telling me uh we've talked about this we've had so many people leave our church and then we talk to them later and they're so thankful they got to come to church here just for a few years or a few months and uh just enjoy the beauty of the spirit of God that that we feel amongst each other so our friends from Texas right now they're here we don't know how long they'll be here but we want to be we want to show the character of Christ as long as they're here we want them to know there's people that really love Jesus amen there's people that really have the character of the lily of the valley Jesus Christ Hallelujah I hope they're here forever by God's grace we hope so but Jesus says consider the lies they don't toil they don't spin other words a Christian life is not a bad life it's the best life my wife shared a podcast with me you know what the new this is I'm going to get into marriage here about family you know what the re you know what the real research on marriage says the happiest marriages are Christians who are dedicated but the man has the biggest influence over the marriage if that man really loves God if he spends time with his family if he spends time with his children and he can listen to his wife and take advice when before he makes the decision if if he can spend time with his family those are the happiest marriages and those marriages last much longer they always say oh uh Christian marriages they divorce just as much as uh the the Sinners no they don't not with the happy Christians I'm talking about the real Christians Amen in other words there's two kinds of Christians and this is a study Church these people don't even know the message but yet they say there's two kinds of Christians devoted and nominal that means in name only that's like the foolish virgin right in other words if you just take the stats of the Holy Ghost filled people they're married the longest and they're happiest praise God Hallelujah and the the biggest indicator on if that family is going to be happy is if the man truly loves God because he's a leader Hallelujah all the research shows that Christians are the happiest why because it's a lily it's it's a beauty right uh the man has to show the be of course the woman too but I'm talking about the leader as Christ the man represents Christ he's got to be the leader he's got the one that shows the love of God to the rest of the family praise God hallelujah I'm going to preach more on that eventually by God's grace I feel this might be the this podcast and the research might be the nudge I can finally get to write that book on family I've been wanting to right I wrote one chapter but I never picked up after that I've just been kind of waiting for inspiration uh by the grace of God lies uh grow in valleys in the field they grow among Thorns uh they can be cultivated to grow in gardens and uh God's blessing was spoken he'll grow as the Lily so when lies grow up uh it's a sign of God's fruitfulness lies grow rapidly and commonly so they spring up everywhere all these beautiful testimonies Hallelujah they spring up everywhere now here uh let's look at some of these symbols here a lily is a sweet and fragrant flower with a strong scent this is typical of Jesus Jesus gave himself for an offering and is sacrificing to God for a sweet smelling Savor so this types Jesus Jesus hallelujah it's fragrant it's got a beautiful smell and all your worship to God all your songs all your ties and offerings all your love for God everything you do to give God glory it's a sacrifice it's a spiritual scent that goes up to heaven amen your prayers are as incense Hallelujah is that right Hallelujah so these are beautiful uh flowers just to smell and lean in and enjoy the fragrance and that's what your life is supposed to be Hallelujah the Lily is white and very beautiful it exceeds all other flowers for whiteness it's the whitest white you're going to see on a plant this is because of course uh the white is a picture of the purity of the righteousness of Christ remember Revelation 19 uh the Bible said in Revelation 19 uh that the righteousness is like white fine linen Hallelujah so this is Purity Hallelujah and the Bride of the Lamb will be clothed in white Revelation 19:8 Hallelujah so this represents Jesus who knew no sin the white represents Purity and this is what Christ gave for us Christ gave us a testimony a pure testimony he always did that which pleased the father a lily is very fruitful one root may put forth 50 bulbs 50 fold that's a really good increase 50 fold amen 50 times that amount I was looking at Bitcoin I think Bitcoin went up 130% this last year right so that's only like one and that's only like one and a half it's not even one and a half times it but this is 50 times this is how much more fruitful Jesus is than even Bitcoin Hallelujah the Lily is one of the tallest of flowers and yet look it hangs its head down everybody noticed that look how humble it is it's one of the tallest but it hangs its head in humility this is a picture of of Jesus because the Bible said he humbled himself and took upon him the death of the Cross right and remember the wheat seeds what do the wheat seeds do in Harvest they bow their heads church we ought to Bow ourselves we ought to submit ourselves to the leadership of the Holy Ghost Jesus said it was of him being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in the light less a men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross Hallelujah so he humbled himself that he might die for you and see that's our question today who are you dying for who are you living for today most of us if it's our husband or wife right our families that's who we're supposed to serve like we tell the PE young men when they get married once you get married you're no longer living for yourself you're living for your family so that's how a Christian most often expresses his love uh for Jesus his whole service now is to take care of his wife his children he's supposed to Humble himself and take care of them remember a man that won't provide for his own is worse than an Infidel and an Infidel says there's no God an Infidel won't worship God an Infidel will blashe the Holy Ghost but the Bible says a man that comes to church and won't provide for his own is worse than that God help us to provide for our own praise God God help us to see who are we here sent to serve who am I to serve Hallelujah I just find it amazing whenever strange or whenever uh difficult things happen God always provides always provides I've just seen God always step in God supernaturally does this God supernaturally does that God supernaturally does that there's been people overseas that have needed uh offerings and I'll say well I don't have it right now I said but you pray and if God sends me unexpected money then I'll send it to you and it's happened a number of times God hears the voice of people who are really crying out and really need something from him and the last thing the Lily has many medicinal qualities it could be used to restore a lost Voice Hallelujah the voice of the Bride it could help give you strength if you're fainting it's good for the liver and help helps dropy because the Lord Jesus Christ is the great physician and he's fully capable of curing all disease diseases and maladies of the Soul so consider this a beautiful type of the Lord Jesus Christ how many consider that today amen let's see what I got next after here okay yeah I'm going to get to this in a moment okay this is the picture taken on that uh dedication morning when uh you seen the picture probably brother R brother R's getting the Cornerstone and he's laying in the Cornerstone on the day uh they laid the foundation of the Tabernacle this was taken right after that and there's brother BR look a 21y old brother BR 21 or 22 that's what he looked like doesn't he look so full of hope so hopeful for the future he hadn't even gone out yet this is in the 1933 if I'm not mistaken maybe 34 it was going to still be till 1947 that he actually went out and preached with his gift with his uh three with his two gifts the angel said and then the third poll came later so he's going to spend the next 13 or so years pastoring shepherding the little flock we'd call it by God's grace can I zoom in there no I okay I thought I could zoom in I can do it on my other one but just look he's hugging his Bible I don't know who that is but look they're hugging the Bible these are all Saints the and some of these people were there at the Ohio river that we where I baptized Jose he want to be re-baptized at the Ohio River 2017 brother I saw it on my I was going through the old pictures yesterday brother Jose just said I want to be re-baptized where brother BR baptized where the pillar of fire came now I said yes sir I'll do that I cut my foot on some piece of glass though but I I didn't get any infection by God's grace that's a beautiful day so a lot of these people came out of that Revival when the Holy Spirit came down and was visible there and uh it said as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ so your message will forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and these are some of the faithful Saints of course that could misw work you know I don't know when they had the day but do you remember also the story too brother baham said his wife hope this is before he's even married he was a pastor before he was even married married the Bible said a pastor should be married though and have children so we preached on that a little bit by God's grace I was telling that brother Simon brother Simon is aware of that but see this is before that and remember Sister hope uh even after they got married they would walk around and they would pass out little tracks to see if you want to donate to the building of their church now I I don't think I'd go that far in fact I've never done that I've never asked anybody uh there's one time a brother in church here I think it's brother Adam yeah he want to do a uh he want to do a building fund so we started a building fund and uh I think maybe got a couple hundred do in there over the course of a couple years and then when they left and I asked him he said oh just donate it back to the church if I'm not mistaken so you know some people if they have a desire to build God will send it if if they want to build by God's grace if God's in it God's going to send it by the grace of God I appreciate people that want to build a house for the Lord but it's got to be at the right time and season Hallelujah and this is the time they had it uh by God's grace they had the right time and season there to start building that uh the the original Tabernacle the one I showed you at the beginning Hallelujah so after brother R talks about the lies there at the pond he says may this house long stand may it be fully dedicated to God the Tabernacle itself was dedicated in 1933 but thinking this morning it'd be very good thing a small service of dedication again and especially to the people who with their love and Devotion to Christ has made this all possible so brother wants to thank all the people that worked hard to renovate the Tabernacle and bring it to the place where it was there in March of 1963 brother am again says I'm greatly appreciative to the congregation to speak these words in behalf of our good Brethren here who dedicated their services brother Banks Woods our Noble brother Roy Roberson many others with unselfishness and singleness of heart has put months in constructing this place to the way it's been stayed here to see that it was built just right so brother Bram thanked the people that had put their efforts into building the renovated brandham Tabernacle and don't you know God keeps track of that as well I believe God will bless brother Adam for wanting to have a a a building fund but God's also going to bless those people who actually partake in building the church how many remember Moses built a tabernacle remember some of the names in there God wrote down their names so we would remember God's Gonna bless those people how many remember bezel a holab was those were the two main Builders of Moses's Tabernacle and God records their names oh Church May our names be recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life for what we've done for this church hallelujah or whatever church God started you out whatever Church God's going to call you for in other words do something for the church help the church because God sees what you're doing Hallelujah so brother Banks and brother Roberson they had the ability they were construction workers they had the ability uh to hire the right men find the right men they were Trustees of the church and they had the right men that were in the right position to make the renovation the best it could possibly be in the days of Solomon hyim of Ty Tyrie and then the king of Tyrie was also named hyam so two men by the name of hyam helped Moses build uh I'm sorry helped Solomon build his Temple uh here's the one Aden Iram was also uh one of the main men skilled Artisans and stone cutters in other words God remembers everyone who invested any little effort into the kingdom of God into the house of God and it's very beautiful brother is mentioning names just like Moses mentioned name just like Salomon mentioned names God sees all those who want to benefit the house of God hallelujah and church what's beautiful about Moses and Solomon and even Bram Tabernacle here all these efforts of these men allowed the Holy Ghost to fall in the services did you understand that all these men worked for months it was yeah it was nine months Cam's preached out here numerous times Moses had to Moses labored nine months to get the Tabernacle and that types Jesus is the Tabernacle of God how long does a baby uh grow in the womb nine months so Moses's Tabernacle took nine months just like the birth of our Lord amen hallelujah after nine months it was finished and then remember the Holy Ghost fell and Moses and Aaron were outside just glorifying God the same thing happened I think it was seven years Solomon built his Tabernacle or Temple and what happened at the end the Holy Ghost fell but Church don't forget what also has to happen the blood had to be applied to every part of the Tabernacle Aaron had to sprinkle blood on everything in the outer Court everything in the Holy Place everything in the holiest of holies the blood had to be applied to the entire church and then the fire fell Hallelujah God help us to have the blood applied to every part of our Lives amen and then the fire can fall here praise God it does fall here like I told you even last two Wednesday nights ago I was I felt like God's spirit just poured out on me at the end of service I was so refreshed I got to give God a sacrifice of praise I'm weeping praising God I didn't care who is watching I enjoy the freedom and liberty of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I love those moments where God will pour out a special blessing on you and God will vindicate that was that sacrifice was accepted Heaven accepted the sacrifice all the preparation all the work God sees it God will bless it and and then God will vindicate it hallelujah amen like we have these different Brothers come in here brother Simon brother uh Brian when I see their sermons come along and discern situations Hallelujah then I know God has received our sacrifice Hallelujah that's right when I see people get in the prayer line oh thank God God has Vindicated the word of God all the labor every service is important praise God every effort every effort you give God will honor it but the blood had to be applied to every part of the structure whether it was Tabernacle or whether it was Temple brother man then says brother wood Bank Woods made a uh he made a Pulpit the one he'd always wanted I'm going to show it to you a little bit here then brother says there's no way there's no words to express my feeling about the new Tabernacle there's just no way to do it but God understands May each of you be rewarded for your contributions and all that you have done to make this place what it is in the way of a building a house of the Lord and then he says I like to say these words the building as beautiful as it is inside and out he says I don't see how it could have been any better than what it is a perfect job then brother B even talks about the sound system but noticing even in a flat building like this there's no rebound to the accoustics they're in the ceiling different ways no matter where I stand it's just the same every room is constructed that the speakers are in them and you can make it any way you wish to hear I believe it was the hand of almighty God who did these things how many believe that brother man's talking about how you could go in the nursery and you could move uh the volume so the women the sisters with children could still hear the sermon brother Ram said God Almighty did that who set up ours it was mostly brother Vang right I didn't do it so brother brother in other words God hope hopefully he's watching or on the archive God anointed brother V to run the wies so everybody could hear the word of God no matter where you are Hallelujah God did that I still like to do something too if brother van listen just because I I don't think of it I don't think of it till I'm actually preaching but it would be nice at some point to do some Bluetooth where we could have speakers even in the bathrooms just real light where people could still hear the worship still hear the sermons remember at Lima well nobody remember here yeah no one remember here just brother brother Vang and my wife but even in Lima where I first got ordained and uh we first made our home Church even in the bathrooms you could still hear the sermon I really like that because then you don't feel like tempted to get on your phone or tempted to think about other things I like that so maybe that's something we can do for 2025 but it was almighty God who did all these things think about that brother man said it was almighty God that gave us this Pulpit it was almighty God so the sisters can hear the preaching in uh in in the nursery Church don't you know it's almighty God whenever you want to do something for somebody that's God leading you to do it praise God amen CU it's not an act of selfishness it's an act of service and that's why we're here to serve other people praise God hallelujah that that's what we should look Lord how can I be of a better service to your kingdom how can I serve your people better how can I be a better servant because Lord I know you're watching all my uh all my actions I want to use all my gifts for the kingdom of God hallelujah I'm almost ready for that video but let me read this now he said we started off on a mud floor sawdust here by old coal stoves now my dad and mom when I first was born my first house I lived in hogate we had a wood stove and I remember my dad cutting the wood and putting it in there but they had old coal stoves back in 1933 and a mud floor think think about how we how blessed we are church I've never been in a mud floor church every church I've ever even in South America they all had concrete on them by that time they'd all had concrete on look how humble this started dirt floors worshiping Hallelujah and then he says uh he said when they were fixing the Bram Tabernacle they had to add uh they had to add some Rafters they said he said those old stoves used to set on those Rafters that went across and they caught fire and it burned back maybe two or three feet why it didn't burn down only God had kept it so you ever see go in your garage remember in our garage maai the rafters up there so the Bram Tabernacle had a a stove and it was so hot it set the wood on fire but it had only partially burned the rafters that were holding up the building and brother R said these people wondered how did this place not burn down and brother Ram said God kept it up Hallelujah and then after burning off all the weight of the Tabernacle laying there why did it not fall in only the hand of God so brother B recognizes our start was so humble but yet God wouldn't let it fail oh that ought to be an encouragement to us no matter how hard your struggle is no matter how humble it starts God if he if God's in it God will not let you fail Hallelujah I can't fail no more than God can fail because God's inside of me Hallelujah God's guiding me he's leading me praise God you know when we did we we renovated our house in 2018 it was the same the same year I was looking through our pictures when we went to Bram Tabernacle we we hired an electrician named Tom Shumway and I remember he said well we got to we got to run some new electric wires I remember he went up there he caught up in our ceiling he come down he said Jesse he said I hate to tell you this but your house should have burnt down many times because the wiring the electric wiring in your house was with extension cords think about that the heater the air conditioner the appliances the dishwasher the stove everything was running on extension cords he said the guy who wired this was only using using extension cords your house should have burnt down I said it's only God's grace that kept us alive I had Sons and Daughters of God in the house so it couldn't burn down amen and we had we had numerous problems with electricity before it was totally replaced so I can say the same thing who kept us Malachi and L's not here in when they were little babies who kept us almighty God kept us from burning down praise God it was God With Us God's in us hallelujah God's for us hallelujah no man can be against us if God is for us Hallelujah brother man said I pray that this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristics of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in May It Be consecrated as a place of worship for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty so let's go through the video now hopefully I can do this without messing it up here okay eyes get real big am I gonna mess it up let's see okay got some pictures there from yesterday went to the zoo okay there's brother William okay 2018 now this is of course before uh we went to the BR Tabernacle that's shi's C sh shi's candy store those are Red Hots brother Bram loved Red Hots and Red Hots were part of the third poll that's why we took a picture of it uh the owner of this his name is sunny Shimp he was dying of cancer and uh brother and they have a testimony hanging up on the wall you can see it he was dying and brother BR walked in there and he saw a vision he said thus sayith the Lord he said God's going to heal you they thought he was going to die he said but you'll again sell me Red Hots what a thus sayith the Lord and after he got well and everything brother R kind of snuck in there he'd say I like some Red Hots and he said oh yeah the kids love them he looked up and he said oh brother brandom and he says look thus sayith the Lord is now fulfilled that's how accurate the Visions were so that's why brother William is smiling this is a part of a vision and they're still making Red Hots to this day all right now that that's Shimp you can see shimps in the back shimps candy store there's brother Bam's uh grave there God's grace the pyramid shape there's a handsome guy right there now there there it is there's there's the Cornerstone dedicated 1933 Bram Tabernacle and I loved it even when we remember we announced we're going uh remember brother William's like make sure you dress up I love that they just see it's a sacred Place think about that for all these 60 some years he's heard brother BR he's heard about the brand Tabernacle he's heard it but now he can say I've heard about it but now I've seen it Hallelujah I've seen a sacred place where God met his Prophet hallelujah oh I love it amen I love it yeah there's Jose there's the eagle oh and the sword sorry I got to skip ahead all three of us there the sword of the king brother had that now that's a wag wheel that was part of brother Ram's dream brother Ram said he saw a his family was in a wheel his family was in a carriage and the Wagon Wheel broke he said that' be a sign for you to go out west so brother Ram always kept that and this is Joseph's house Joseph bram's current house in well as far as I know um they got it gated off because they get so many visitors there to they try to discourage people but that uh uh that reminded brother brandom of the vision to go out to Arizona so he can meet the seven angels and then preach the revelation of the Seven Seals that old broken Wagon Wheel by God's grace yeah there's brother R's house and then the Wagon Wheel oh now it's Joseph's okay now that's important because that's the middle school where brother Brandon preached um marriage and divorce just this humble little middle school and that that's where he said thus sayi the Lord on marriage and divorce there's only one way to divorce and remarriage that's unconfessed fornication on behalf of the woman right given thus sayith the Lord right there at that location these are these are special places now we didn't go in we just took it outside uh by God's grace okay now I just want to show this because this is what the next part when you walk like I said when you walk right in the front doors they have two signs enter into the house of the Lord reverently in prayer and meditation so see when you walk church when you walk into those doors you should get in here to pray you should get in here to read your Bible I tell my little girls to yeah flip to the page you want to take notes on but don't flip so many pages just get right to the page because people are here to pray and meditate on the things of God don't whisper to your neighbor because we're trying to pray hallelujah we're trying to be reverent uh we want to meditate on the things of God we want to talk to God lord I need to hear from you today God speak something that would bless my soul today encourage me today heal me today speak to me today Hallelujah we want to hear from God hallelujah amen so there's one of them and then the mothers with babies only Z to two years old that's the mother's room there here's another one so they have two they have two signs please do not talk be reverent pray study or meditate so they have two signs just Med this is your time to hear from God that's why I tell my girls and all the young girls too you know when you come in here it's time to talk to God don't worry about everything else pray meditate on the things of God this is where God meets with us praise God hallelujah it's not a time to talk it's not a time to now afterwards brother Ram would tell greet the people shake their hand but later brother Ram say if you want to have a conversation walk out there he said talk anything you want in the parking lot as long as it's holy and good sometimes I'll tell the brothers hey let's go in my office let's talk in there by God's grace those are all hanging up right there when in Bram Tabernacle when you walk in now look at that look at that picture of Jesus brother had that hanging up in there all those years look how long the hair is on Jesus and the man there he told us a Catholic gave this to brother brandom a Catholic person they wanted to donate to brother bram's church and brother BR said okay I'll take that it's still hanging up today Hallelujah and we don't know how long Jesus's hair was but that's the picture has been hanging there for many many years right when you walk in okay now that's when you go to the left side so if you walk in on the left side there's actually three rows like this there's one row two row rows three rows right there is a pillar of fire picture Houston 1950 you got the Lord Jesus Hoffman's head there above it you have be still know that I'm God and there's brother Ram's uh Pulpit there that's the piano you have chairs and back there for the ministry so that that's all it is is so like in here we have one row right where one set of chairs there at brandom Tabernacle you got three sets one two three okay so there's a little closer view there you can see oh yeah on the other side is a picture let me go back there on the other side is a picture of brother brand I think I it's on here later okay so there's a picture just a painting of brother brandom uh right there's the uh seven Church agents we'll show that in a little bit there that's really all they got they don't have a lot in there is that brother William praying I think that's brother William praying right there about God okay so we're walking up to the pulpit there it was a prayer meeting they only do a onour prayer meeting now and it has to be absolutely silent there's a crucifix you saw that there's two crucifixes of the Lord Jesus Christ on both those pillars now this is the uh uh the feet washing room but it was actually overflow back in 201 uh 18 they'd have so many people come there to set people here but this is actually the feet washing room normally the feet washing room for the Sisters I think yeah sisters and then there's a communion room and they did because they had so many people brother R said they used to do one cup like we do one cup because we have a small Church uh but if anybody's sick remember we'll go to individual cups but they had so many people it took so long they moved to doing individual cups for communion we got towels and everything over for water baptism as well off that's the plate for the bread let me skip ah head here so there's the wine okay now right behind this is the water baptismal it's directly behind the pulpit this got to pull away the curtain and then there's the baptism that's where brother Loris was baptized Lis was baptized there by Brother Willard Collins he was the pastor after brother Brenham I'm sorry after Orman Neville passed away just a humble little baptismal there all right this room I think was the brother's room yeah this brother's room to prepare for water baptism we got to exit there brother could get out the back towels for water baptism he was telling a story okay now then the last thing is brother bram's office just look at how humble his desk is here and his uh his office is just so so humble there's that painting remember a brother named Stephie painted that and brother said I wish I had the money he said you're such a good artist I'd send you to college so you could really develop your your painting skills that was in 1964 if you want to look look that up so people that say brother Ram is against education they just don't know all the quotes right they're just being critical because they probably don't have an education which I mean you don't have to have an education but God can use it it's a beautiful poem brother Orman Neville read that poem our precious brother Bill clock Elijah and then that's the woods look at brother Ram's desk there they they try to keep it in the same order it was uh some statues Bibles chairs you know what I got I'll just say like this I got criticized even this morning on a YouTube comment like why do you talk about brother Ram so much if you lived in the days of Moses wouldn't you talk about Moses if Moses brought you out of the Red Sea wouldn't you remember Moses a little bit brother BR brought me out of denominationalism church he brought me out of the blindness of thinking it's okay to get drunk and women preachers okay and crossdressing is okay women cutting hairs he brought me out of this bondage of Egyptian bondage so people just they're they're just man said the human mind just wants to criticize but I want to show it to the young people just see how humble look there's wood wood you know Wood Walls just a very humble beautiful sacred place so yeah there's his a desk now if you don't if you got a desk just real small look there's just six drawers or seven I'm sorry three three one just a small little little you a tissue box and of course Joseph put that in the phone water because Joseph would study here too he had his Bible always laying open on his desk just a lamp just a real look at this chair simple chair this is how a prophet of God was set up his church and he said this is one of the most beautiful churches in all America he says see why cuz it was it was home for him the people had dedicated their lives to supporting this this ministry so that the word of God could be preached he said from here came forth the word of God Amen just so simple yeah honor to yeah so it's on tape in 1964 if you want to hear that poem there's oh yeah there's that beautiful uh do I have this scope I don't think this is the dedication one no I got it at home well that's the letter I showed you where brother Ram wrote his he said dear God and he writes his letter of dedication he said may I preach this word and may I make it real to this generation uh he said uh his unworthy servant so again beautiful prayer of dedication there brother B gave okay so now we're leaving the study back out in the sanctuary there's the organ I'm not mistaken few seats there there's yeah there's a crucifix on both of the pillars there up at the platform The Altar and there's the there's the pulpit he always wanted another picture of the two crucifix there the Lord Jesus here's the Hoffman's head brother Jose you still know that I'm God brother will okay now that this is important too originally the word Elijah brother Bram said put Elijah under that seventh star and it's on tape you can hear I think it's 1962 right after he preached the church ages he said but somebody come by he even names the brother he said he said brother he said don't put my name there he said I have nothing to do with that look how humble brother R was and later we know that was he was the seventh Church age messenger but this is hanging up as well the seven Church ages but originally he wanted Elijah under there not his name but we know we can put it we can put brother bram's name in there of course and there's a painting of brother Brandon ping of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah now that's important because that's that's uh that's the do doors and windows of the woman's Nursery the S the mother's nurs and this is where the pillar of fire appeared and made those uh seven circles with the shadows and lights right here is where it appeared said it right here that was in uh 1961 yes June of 1961 right after he finished preaching the seven Church ages of course now was probably it was the same area but now the church had expanded that way in 1963 but that's where the Holy Ghost that's that's why I made I made sure I take a picture that's on tape too you can listen to that on tape I played it here before the church people are screaming crying they're shouting Pillar of Fire showed up right there in seven circles it's on tape hallelujah what what do the Bible say we're not following cunningly devised wives fables Hallelujah God has visited this generation Hallelujah that's right church that's right and we know because it lines up with the word of God praise God is that the end that's the end okay all right so I think that's my last all right so let me bring this down to a close here by God's grace how many enjoying this so far I thought it'd be a little different you get to see the Bram Tabernacle if you haven't been there look what brother Ram saying about it but then he says as beautiful as this is what's important is the beauty of the character of the people hallelujah so I want to give me a few more minutes here we'll close up by God's grace now brother Bram says I'm going to pick up he says now in the dedication service of the original Cornerstone being laid a great vision came he says and remember brother had multiple Visions on that morning not long ago I preached to you I I went over the seven major Visions again remember that that's a vision brother Ram had on that June morning 1933 the morning of the dedication The Voice also said um remember 2 Timothy 4 so let's go there 2 Timothy 4 and this was extremely prophetic it was he the holy spirit said write down verses 1-7 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine see Paul is giving a charge to the young Pastor Timothy preach the word because God will judge you by what you preached how many believe preaching is important it's what we're judged by I'm going to be judged by what I preach hallelujah thank God we got the word of God verse three for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine now look at the brandom Tabernacle today the time had come 25 well I would say by I think it was 19 I can't remember the date it's I'll look on the website but it was in the late 1960s or early 1970 70s they uh adopted the wrong pastor and this pastor didn't preach as much he started playing tapes only and that's that was their first step on the way outside of the bible message when they got a pastor that he would just teach a a maybe an hourong Sunday school he would sit down he would press play and just let the church sit there and listen to a machine brother abam said machines weren't ordained to preach the gospel he said men were called to preach the gospel Hallelujah but look the Holy Spirit told him there will come a time when they won't endure sound Doctrine you won't be able to teach them simple things out of the Bible Hallelujah but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears why do people not want a pastor today so they have nobody to tell them that they're wrong right see because the people don't want a pastor so they can just itch their ears and they can just have a a tape or whatever they want so no so that they don't have any uh they don't have any correction right they don't want to be corrected they just want to live how they want to live but God said I'm charging preachers to preach the word tell them the truth hallelujah amen that's right look at verse four they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables they'll believe fables old wives tales instead of the word preacher he says verse five Timothy the pastor but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of evangelists make full proof of thy Ministry that's interesting he was called also to evangelism I've been teaching on the fivefold ministry also on line and remember even Paul told Timothy he said a pastor must be apt to teach how many remember that scripture 1 Timothy 3 so a pastor has to have a gift of a pastor to preach but also teach the word of God so here Timothy shows Timothy has more than one gift he has a pastoral gift and he has an Evangelistic gift now remember there has to be separate times for that though right if a pastor is going to leave a church and evangelize it either can't be for a very long time or he's got to let uh somebody else he's got to put another Pastor in charge while he's gone Hallelujah Glory verse six for I'm now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I fought a good fight I finished my course I have kept the faith Hallelujah so surely the Holy Spirit told Brother Bram write this put it in the Cornerstone of the brandham Tabernacle but we know brandham Tabernacle is not kept sound Doctrine 24 plus lies but we got to make sure we don't believe lies we're not responsible for brandom Tabernacle we're responsible for bride of Christ Fellowship responsible to be lies in the church brother manam said many of you might have wondered a few minutes ago why I was so long coming out this morning to preach my first Duty as I come into the new church I married a young man and woman standing in my office that office we just saw with the the study desk may it be a type that I'll be a loyal minister to Christ to get a bride ready for the ceremony of that day I loved how brother R tried to see typ and shadows in his life and church remember in 1965 I think it's the message of shamed brother said I'm out here in Arizona he said uh I feel like I wasted five years of my life he said God have I done something wrong remember in M church he said I'm just going to open my bible Lord and you I'm going to point to something and you just show me uh show me what my purpose is in this life remember what he did Church remember what he went to who remembers anybody remember Genesis 24 he said he pointed Genesis 24 he said it was elaser the model servant the model servant from Abraham to get a bride for Isaac amen hallelujah is everybody okay today glory and that's what Jesus that's what Jesus here Jesus is the type of Isaac Hallelujah and brother R's the type of elaser he had to go out to Arizona he had to go out and continue to evangelize to try to find a bride to get the bride ready to go meet Isaac the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why we're here today praise God because brother random went to Lima Ohio I'm here today Hallelujah people asked me all the time how'd you hear the message brother Jesse how'd you hear it I went to Lima Ohio where brother Ram preach numerous sermons in in Lima Ohio Hallelujah and then Orman Neville he would go up and preach and he they started preaching in a little Barn up there in Lima Ohio and eventually turned into the church that I first got to hear the message in hallelujah amen thank God so that's why brother Ram was sent he was sent as a prophet a messenger Hallelujah glory to God a seven Church age messenger he was also meant as a elaser to prepare the people to marry Jesus Christ Hallelujah now he says this he said now let us do as we did at the beginning we started the first dedication of the church I was just a young man my 21 22 years old when we laid the Cornerstone it was before I was even married I always wanted to see a place correctly in order for God to be worshiped see with his people we can only do that not by a pretty building but by a consecrated life is the only way we can do it now I'm going to close with this here let's get your Bibles ready let's go through some scriptures on the house of God 1 Peter 4 you can uh actually in case you want to pull those up there 1 Peter 4:17 I'm sorry 17 and 18 I want especially our young people to see this as well by the grace of God so s church we got to make sure we constantly renew our attitude toward the house of God hallelujah remember you'll be judged by what you do with this word that I preach and all the preachers that preached to us will be judged by the word of God that we've heard 1 Peter 4:17 and 18 for the time has come that judgment must begin where at the house of God this is where judgment starts amen hallelujah am this is where our lives are judged in other words is it good fruit or is it corrupt fruit it's judged right here in the house of God and remember Paul told Timothy you'll stand before Jesus Christ before the quick and the dead you'll stand before all the raised that are raised from the dead and you'll stand there and you'll answer for what you preach out of the Bible Hallelujah and church you'll answer for what you did with it hallelujah amen remember the Bible said the Pastor I have to give an account of everyone's life that sat under me whether it was for good or whether it was not for good so the Bible says make sure you live a life where the pastor can give an account of your life with joy let's read verse Verse 18 then we'll go to that verse in Hebrews 1 or Hebrews 13 yes and if the unrighteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear see there's going to be people even in the message that are barely saved think of that they're barely saved those are the ones that going to have to die in the tribulation period but they're barely going to be saved because they live too close to the world see we got to be like Abraham Liv so far from the world that we don't even see it Hallelujah we don't we don't play around with the things of the world we don't flirt with the world like Samson flirted with Delilah we don't flirt with those things we only love Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's right see judgment starts right here in other words your attitude toward the word will show what your experience is going to be on the day of judgment remember the Bible says we can have boldness on that day how could we be bold on the day of judgment because we receive God's word we let God's word judge our lives right now Hallelujah Hebrews 13 I think it's verse 17 if I'm not mistaken honey think about that all those people in the days of Moses all those two million people that died there around two million people they'll all have to stand before Moses and Moses will give an account of their lives verse 17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so I'll Stand every Pastor will stand in the presence of Jesus and have to give an account we're either going to give an account with Joy or with grief so what should we do obey the word of God and remember this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever go to verse 7 Hebrews 13:7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of the Lord whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation or their conduct what does their life turn out to be verse eight Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so this is God's uh constant uh plea to the people follow those that are preaching the word of God follow their faith hallelujah amen follow their faith watch how they live their lives look at the end look at the good fruit that comes out of their lives follow that praise God just like Moses just like all the leaders right Joshua amen all these Godly men down through the years follow their lives hallelujah it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Glory now a few more verses here if we could let's go to Psalms yeah we'll just go right over to Psalm 7713 I Shar this with a brother I can't remember who it was but they were asking me why do we come to church because in church is where you find the way of the Lord Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life well some people say well as long as I have Jesus I know the way but there's another verse that says it's in the sanctuary the people that I see loving Jesus Christ the most they're the ones that are most dedicated to the house of the Lord for sure it's not even close not even close thy way oh God is in the sanctuary who is so great as God a God as our God where's God's way brother Claude brother Patrick what are you g to do after high school what way you g to take you're going to find it in the sanctuary Malachi he's 18 he's going to find his way where you going to find your way in the sanctuary worshiping Jesus right like like like we heard Mary lay at jesus' feet hear the word of God and the word of God is like a lamp unto your feet it's a light unto your path is that right amen hallelujah you know it's I know it's Elementary church this is more of a beginning but we need it by God's grace we need to remind us I was just so blessed I listened to this sermon a couple times yesterday uh God hiding himself I was so blessed I'm like oh this a good refresher need to go through this I thought it'd be good to show the pictures of when we went by God's grace w we have so many good memories by the grace of the Lord Psalms uh 89:7 Psalms 89:7 and see now here's where we get this idea brother R say you you young people don't talk in those days don't pass notes I'll say like this don't text in church either right don't text each other in church now no one does that here but in other words don't distract people from worshiping we'll get to that maybe uh next Sunday by God's grace don't distract people from worshiping help them worship and the best way you can do that is medit and talk to God for yourself we don't want to distract people from worship remember people are worshiping and praying uh people are trying to seek God they got questions for their life they might be sick and we got to help them to get in the presence of God so they can hear the voice of God think about think about remember Wednesday night brother Jose gave those testimonies on how God has recently healed him now how could God do that because nobody here was grieving the Holy Spirit but remember if somebody had aching type of sin or something like like that then maybe God wouldn't have healed our brother but I want to encourage you stay true to God because God would be pleased enough to answer his prayer he said while I was praying for him the pain left him Hallelujah remember that why because God was respected in our service we showed God respect we showed him our love we meditated on him we gave him praise we honored him we're trying to hear his voice God is greatly to be feared in the Assembly of the Saints and to be had reverence of all them that are about him that's why that's why brother BR had those two signs read your Bible pray be quiet right study meditate please no talking right that's why we do it by God's grace Psalm 96 verse6 here's another one too some people say I'm weak some people say oh my life is I love how brother Brian preach uh I'm damaged goods remember he said that about the woman with the alabaster box I'm damaged goods the world has beat me up or the world I've given myself to the world I've I've damaged my life but the Bible said here honor and Majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his sanctuary if you need to be strong come to church Hallelujah if you need some strength come to the sanctuary meditate a little bit pray to God talk to God listen to the word God will strengthen you Hallelujah if you feel like you're damaged goods lay in his presence and God will show you you're a beautiful thing to him you're his son you're his daughter you're his child he died for you praise God Amen and if he started a work in you he's going to be faithful to finish that work hallelujah amen you're his beloved hallelujah amen you're his beloved as it were salmon went out and picked Lies Of The Valleys for his wife that's what Jesus he GES brother said he visits us and gives us gifts of the holy spirit he answers our prayer he does healings he does discernments he does signs Miracles and wonders why because of his love for us hallelujah he's given us gifts right brother Patrick he healed you as you testified on Wednesday night why that's his gift to you praise God Amen Hallelujah so what can I give to him Amen Let me Give My Worship Hallelujah let me give my service let me give my effort let me give my Zeal let me give my time let me give my praise let me give my whole heart to Jesus Christ amen hallelujah if you want to be strong if you want to be a beautiful thing or if you want to be a beautiful character Christ come to the house of God and give God reverence and he'll surely do it couple more I got Isaiah 56 go to Isaiah 56 where did I write it down I think it's Isaiah 567 yes yes Isaiah 567 now we're coming up and I just felt led to say this we're coming up on uh sickness season where people get sick and of course we'll pray for you when you're sick of course remember if you miss church you got to go back and listen to it you got to listen at least to brother brandom but you want to stay with our services to see what the the Holy Spirit would speak to the church because like my wife said even like I told Brother McBride and brother uh uh the brother Griffin Paul Griffin and I told brother Brian and brother Simon I said God specifically spoke to our lives through these sermons only God could have done that Hallelujah so we're coming up on this season here especially our brothers who work Wednesday night you know brother amen works Wednesday night brother Vang uh Jose sometimes works on if you're not in church make sure you feed upon the the word of God because strength comes from the word of God on Wednesday nights hallelujah amen all these blessings come from hearing the word of God in other words we need it now more than ever praise God as we go into a new year we need it now more than ever verse seven even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer so can you have joyful Joy while you're praying of course that ought to make you joyful the fact that I can talk to the Eternal God creat I can talk to him and brother said he'll talk back amen you talk to God God will talk back to you praise God their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people let me give you testimony I just telling my wife about a financial need and while right after we talked to my wife I think it was Friday I got a text from a man who's Fallen this year into he was a false prophet and he fell into adultery it was all over the internet I mentioned him a couple weeks ago I preach on it he reached out to me and said I want to donate to your ministry give me your link to your church I said I don't have one but my wife noticed it look I was just talking about how a financial need come up and I could have been I felt like I was being tempted of the devil to accept offering from a false prophet but what did God do I've been praying I was in the and oh yeah this week I've been reading on I finished uh Daniel uh Ezekiel I finished that and I started back on Jeremiah and it's all about false prophets and Israel getting away from God into idolatry and warning about false pastors and all these things so I had all these things on my mind and so it was a Temptation I was just I was just telling my wife about a financial need and here comes a false prophet can I give you some money I said no thanks I don't want your money I'm glad we don't have links online to give amen it was a Temptation I could have said oh we could I just I just had that need come up Hallelujah but see what was it God puts our minds on the word of God don't don't uh cater to false prophets don't even give them any time you'll know them by their fruits Hallelujah you know that's what these false prophets do they go from one Church they give a financial offering and because the wow we got a nice offering well then I'll accept him in other words they buy your friendship you need to love Jesus Christ so much nobody can buy your friendship nobody can buy your compromise because you don't compromise amen hallelujah that just I didn't plan to preach that but it just kind of come to my mind for mine house should be called a house of prayer for all people so that's why I was saying to our young people my children all the children remember when you come in here this is the place where adults they may have a hard week children but you can pray and you can create a real good atmosphere where the adults can hear from God and same thing for adults you might have had a good week but come in here come in here reverently so people can hear God they can talk to God they can joyfully pray and they can lift up worship and they can honor the God who sent them here praise God hallelujah one more um uh now this one I got to look up it was behaving yourself you know how to behave yourself yes 1 Timothy 3 yes I'm sorry 1 Timothy 3 last verse now in the next ver uh few sermons when I get back to this series here 1 Timothy 3 it's end of the chapter I think it's uh 15 14- 15 brother R's going to go through all these specific examples here of how we can be reverent in the house of God bless you first Timothy 3 Let's do 34 yes these things I write unto thee hoping to come to thee shortly now what was he writing he was about requirements for pastors these are requirements pastors have to meet and then deacons and their wives too pastors and pastors wives deacons and deacons wives verse 15 but if I car long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God let's say Living God can we living God this is the church of living God which is the pillar and ground of Truth anybody been to the local uh the city hall lately where they have courts what do they have outside they got a woman holding the balances right and she's got a blindfold on because uh justice is blind right now most most times today it's corrupt you can pay off a judge if you're a Democrat or whatever if you're a millionaire you can pay somebody off but Paul is saying if anybody is going to be treated right if there's ever going to be a place where there's truth it's in the house of God we are the Pillar of Truth we're the foundation of Truth truth if anybody ever finds any truth in the world it ought to be right here hallelujah right here hallelujah you're the pillar and ground of the truth that's why we got to keep this a reverent Atmosphere by the grace of God we got to keep a reverent attitude towards the things of God strength is here beauty is here God's here he answers prayers here amen Joy is here hallelujah there's so much to here it's right here for us which is the pillar and God of Truth okay and now back up to 1 Timothy 3 verse two what should a bishop what should a pastor be blameless the husband of one wife Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach so all these things this is this is the behavior the pastor and if the pastor models this then you can follow that Hallelujah remember we just read it in Hebrews 13 you follow the faith of those preaching the word of God you follow Simon's faith brother Brian's faith my Faith the men of God that God has called to lead the church you follow their faith and this is the character that they have Hallelujah not given to Wine no Striker not greedy a filthy looker but patient not a brawler not covetousness I'm sorry not Covetous one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity for for a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God how Hallelujah verse 6 na novice left he lest being lifted up in Pride he fall into condemnation of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them that are without so go to Copley and see what my uh reputation is in copi as a teacher go ask him go in the school ask the principal about me right Hallelujah that's right he says lest he fall into reproach uh of the snare of the devil there's a snares we preached on last week how many stay out of the snares this week I was thinking about that did you stay out of the snares this week Hallelujah no complexes no self-pity right no depression you stay out of the snares of the Devil stay away from the lust stay away from the pride and you'll be right the Satan won't be able to trap you you'll overcome every snare praise God we saw the Eagles yesterday at the zoo they were all caged up I felt remember that story I told Brother BR said he s saw the eagle fly up and hit his head I felt bad for those poor Eagles but at least they're alive right they'd be dead if they're out in the wilderness by God's grace look at deacons now now I'm the only Deacon in our church so let's how how a deacon would be likewise must a deacons be grave not double tonged not given to much wine not greedy a filthy luer who have I ever begged for money here have I begged anybody for money here have I gone out to any of the uh Sinners out there and beg the Sinners for money no and even like this have I compromised and taken money from false prophets no I don't want it I even turned people down they had full-time jobs made a lot of money I even turned them down don't come to our church because they had unconfessed sin at other churches I've even turned down ties that way because it's not about the money it's about Jehovah Gyra praise God he'll provide hallelujah it's about keeping the church clean that's what it's about that's right what does he do verse n even a deacon he holds the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience so see a deacons got to have a revelation of the message of the hour he's got to hold that mystery the revelation of the godhead right all the 12 New Testament Mysteries he's got to hold that in his head he has to remember the mystery of God and let these also first be proved then let them be I'm sorry then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things let the deacons be the husbands of one wife that's why these people say oh there's such a thing as deaconesses there's there's women deacons in the church no I'm sorry the Deacon is the husband of one wife these people it's just the same Greek word the same word for Greek uh is uh the same Greek word for Deacon is like a business person and the Bible said Phoebe Paul said help Phoebe with her business so they say see same Greek word uh she's a deacon I'm sorry this is the requirement for a deacon just because it's the same word doesn't mean a woman can be a deacon you have to look at the context of the scripture let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own house as well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus let's stand to our feet ma Malachi musicians can come Victoria

keep doing this even after I finish this series now the spoken word Original Seed that's over a six-h hour sermon so I might have like 28 or 30 parts in that sermon alone but see church if you're pulling on God's word God will give you what you have need of I've always found it over 18 years I found that no matter what I preach it really don't matter I mean it does matter as long as I obey God
