[0:07] so I felt like you know last time we
[0:08] preached on the book of Romans I thought
[0:09] maybe I had one more sermon on it by
[0:11] God's grace so I just want to preach
[0:13] this I was studying on this the last few
[0:15] days and it really was blessed by the
[0:17] grace of God Romans 1 9 and
[0:23] 10 just want to see Paul's heart as a
[0:26] spiritual father look at Paul's heart
[0:29] here verse n says for God is my witness
[0:32] whom I serve with my spirit in the
[0:34] gospel of his son that without ceasing I
[0:37] make mention of you always in my prayer
[0:40] so Paul would always remember all the
[0:43] churches right in their prayers we know
[0:45] he said the same thing to the church at
[0:49] Philippi he would always pray so in his
[0:51] daily prayers he's I pray in Philippi I
[0:54] pray for the Saints in Rome he always
[0:57] made mention of them remember God is
[0:59] storing up our prayers in vials up in
[1:01] heaven Hallelujah Paul said God's my
[1:03] witness amen so that's was a very
[1:06] serious statement he saying God knows I
[1:09] pray for you always amen verse 10 making
[1:13] requests if by any means now at length I
[1:16] might have a prosperous journey by the
[1:19] will of God to come unto you verse one
[1:24] for I long to see you that I may impart
[1:26] unto you some spiritual gift sounds like
[1:28] a good father to me Hallelujah a
[1:31] spiritual father right to the end that
[1:33] you may be
[1:36] established that is that I may be
[1:38] comforted together with you by the
[1:40] mutual Faith both of you and me so one
[1:43] thing we see you know we often pray for
[1:44] people to have comfort you know when
[1:45] they lose a loved one but Paul said just
[1:48] being with the Saints brought him great
[1:50] comfort that's right if he could just
[1:52] spend time with the church he would be
[1:55] comforted and that would mean much that
[1:57] that would mean so much to him as a man
[1:59] a single man he's never been married
[2:00] right never had children but it would
[2:02] just comfort him so much to be able to
[2:03] see the Saints of course their faith
[2:06] would be lived out and he could spend
[2:08] time with them that would bring Comfort
[2:10] to the Apostle Hallelujah the prophet of
[2:12] God uh let's go to Romans
[2:21] 15:23 Romans 15:23 course read this a
[2:24] couple of weeks ago and we preached on
[2:26] chapter 15
[2:36] let's just read verse 23 together we can
[2:38] on three 1 2 3 but now having no more
[2:41] place in these parts and having a great
[2:45] desire these many years to come unto you
[2:49] so we see at the beginning of the book
[2:51] we see at the end of the letter Paul
[2:53] really wanted to be with these Saints I
[2:55] love it because I as I've studied I made
[2:57] a mistake I didn't think Paul made it to
[2:58] wrome well of course he made it to to
[2:59] Rome I forgot about it I love to see
[3:02] this God had a great desire in his heart
[3:04] to be with them and then God made a way
[3:06] he could be with them may God add His
[3:08] blessings to R's word you can be seated
[3:10] by God's
[3:19] face now verse 24 of chapter 15 we get a
[3:22] little more on this he said whensoever I
[3:24] take my journey into Spain I will come
[3:26] to you for I trust to see you in my
[3:28] journey and to be brought on my way
[3:31] thitherward by you if first I be
[3:34] somewhat filled with your
[3:36] company Hallelujah so we see that there
[3:38] in verse 24 Hallelujah so Paul's great
[3:41] desire many years as we said a few weeks
[3:43] ago you know there's desires we have you
[3:46] know and we don't get them fulfilled
[3:48] right away we've got to wait years and
[3:50] years and years uh for our desires to be
[3:54] fulfilled and some of them the Bible
[3:55] said in Hebrews 11 we won't even have
[3:57] those desires here uh we we made die we
[4:00] may pass away of course we know a
[4:01] Christian Never Dies Hallelujah death
[4:04] means separation Hallelujah we might be
[4:06] separated from this realm Hallelujah but
[4:08] we'll never die Hallelujah we never be
[4:11] uh eternally dead or eternally separated
[4:14] from God hallelujah when we leave this
[4:16] place the Bible said we're present with
[4:18] the Lord amen but if we know if we don't
[4:21] experience you know in this life the
[4:23] things we desire we know God will grant
[4:24] us that desire in the Millennium praise
[4:26] God cuz all wrongs will be made right
[4:29] there hallah hallelujah amen everything
[4:30] will be uh manifested there that God
[4:33] planned for us hallelujah all that he
[4:34] ordained for us will be uh granted there
[4:37] hallelujah amen but it was uh you know I
[4:40] love what Paul's prayer is you know I
[4:42] want to be I want to have a prosperous
[4:43] journey to get there and uh you know no
[4:47] doubt it was a prosperous journey we'll
[4:48] look at that in a little bit but maybe
[4:50] not what we would consider
[4:52] prosperous Hallelujah we how many always
[4:55] want the best right you want you want
[4:56] everything to go well you want
[4:57] everything to go smoothly we pray for
[5:00] God's blessing right we ask for his his
[5:02] Blessing and prosperity but God doesn't
[5:05] always give us what we want God gives us
[5:07] what we need praise God and God knows we
[5:09] have need of many times is we need to go
[5:11] through tests we need to go through
[5:13] trials Hallelujah right trials make us
[5:15] stronger the trials are more precious
[5:17] than that of gold amen your trials you
[5:20] go through are better than gold better
[5:23] than riches hallelujah amen and the
[5:25] Bible is plain on that so we rejoice in
[5:27] that that God would give us what we have
[5:29] need our father would give us what we
[5:31] have need of not what we want all the
[5:32] time amen hallelujah God is so gracious
[5:35] now I wish there was a way we got this
[5:37] big old screen here but I didn't have
[5:38] enough time to actually forgot about I
[5:40] wanted to bring the Apple TV and kind of
[5:41] hook up here but uh maybe uh this week
[5:44] by God's
[5:45] grace
[5:47] so um you know looking at the timeline
[5:49] of Paul's Ministry Paul was converted
[5:51] around ad. 34 so right after maybe a
[5:54] year after the day of Pentecost or maybe
[5:56] that same year Paul was converted of
[5:58] course on the road to Damascus and then
[6:01] I just thought it was you know very
[6:03] fitting you know that he had about 35
[6:05] years of
[6:06] ministry brother brandham had about 32
[6:10] years of full-time Ministry so I just
[6:12] thought it was interesting they had
[6:13] about the same amount of time both
[6:15] prophets of God the prophet to begin the
[6:17] church Age The Prophet to end the church
[6:19] age Hallelujah both had about the same
[6:22] number of years of ministry now brother
[6:24] randam of course was saved before 1933
[6:27] but that's when he became a pastor in
[6:29] 193 3 and of course he died in 1965 so
[6:32] that's 32 years of full-time ministry
[6:35] right full-time we know there's
[6:37] quotations around full time because of
[6:39] course brother R was a Christian before
[6:40] that so Paul was a uh a prophet or
[6:44] Minister you know for around 35 years
[6:47] from 33 or 34 ad to about 67 or 68
[6:52] ad and uh you know by history the first
[6:55] book he wrote was likely uh the letter
[6:58] to the Galatians
[7:00] around 47 or 49 ad somewhere around
[7:03] there the reason we know that is because
[7:06] in Acts 15 Paul goes to this Council of
[7:09] Jerusalem with Peter and James and
[7:11] they're asking all these questions well
[7:13] Gentiles are now getting the Holy Ghost
[7:14] what do we tell them to do do they keep
[7:16] all the commands and you know if you're
[7:18] a Bible reader they come up with four
[7:19] regulations right right that's what the
[7:22] Bible says and uh one of them and none
[7:25] of them are about circumcision right but
[7:27] in Galatians Paul's rebuking the
[7:29] Galatians because they've let
[7:30] circumcision creep back
[7:32] in right so we know we know Galatians
[7:35] was written before acts 15 Hallelujah
[7:38] because Paul if Paul if if if acts 15
[7:41] would have already happened Paul would
[7:42] have said here's the four regulations
[7:45] right right but even you know uh I'm
[7:47] going to preach a sermon on this
[7:48] sometime soon the leaven of sin each of
[7:51] these churches was battling some type of
[7:53] Leaven right right even the Pharisees
[7:56] Jesus said Beware of the leav of the
[7:58] Pharisees right Hallelujah we know there
[8:01] was LE the next book I'm going to preach
[8:03] Lord willing is the book of First
[8:04] Corinthians there was LE in the
[8:06] Corinthian Church it was this idea that
[8:09] they didn't mourn over their sin I'm
[8:11] talking about awful sexual sin they
[8:14] didn't mourn over it in fact they were
[8:16] puffed up they were uh they were
[8:20] extremely defiant about it they were
[8:23] just uh uh they they were constantly
[8:25] trying to uh make themselves
[8:28] self-righteous they were uh
[8:30] what's the word I'm looking for they
[8:31] were trying to defend themselves you
[8:33] know they hadn't even mourned over this
[8:35] sin that was happening to the church and
[8:37] Paul said that's leaven amongst the
[8:40] church this inability to repent of sin
[8:44] but Paul you know wrote that letter to
[8:45] Galatians and and then he went on his
[8:47] first missionary trip and then his
[8:49] second missionary trip so the order
[8:52] Galatians he wrote that verse then he
[8:54] wrote the letters to the
[8:55] Thessalonians on his second missionary
[8:57] trip and then his third missionary trip
[8:59] he wrote the letters to Corinthians and
[9:00] then Romans which is what we've been
[9:02] preaching by God's grace so he wrote the
[9:04] book of
[9:05] Romans on his third missionary trip then
[9:08] he got arrested he either got arrested
[9:09] twice in Rome or once historians aren't
[9:11] for
[9:12] sure um and then it was either during
[9:16] his first arrest in Rome or his second
[9:18] arrest in Rome where he wrote What's
[9:20] called the prison
[9:23] Epistles that was Ephesians Colossians
[9:27] fiman and then first and 2 Timothy and
[9:31] Titus so again think about that just for
[9:33] a brief
[9:34] moment God allowed us to get thus sayith
[9:37] the Lord from the man of God while he
[9:39] was in prison most of us would think oh
[9:42] it's awful he's in prison oh how could
[9:44] God allow this there's no way this is
[9:46] the will of God when in reality it was
[9:48] completely the will of God Amen so just
[9:51] opening up our minds and our thoughts
[9:52] about you know why things happen to
[9:54] people and uh looks like maybe bad
[9:56] things are happening but remember
[9:58] friends God's behind everything
[10:00] Hallelujah God's Got A Plan he's got a
[10:02] purpose behind everything the heavenly
[10:04] father amen as as a perfect father as a
[10:08] a a blameless father he's allowed all
[10:11] these events of Our
[10:14] Lives
[10:17] now Paul made it to Rome and Paul made
[10:20] it to Rome because it was thus saith the
[10:22] Lord Jesus Hallelujah we say thus sayith
[10:25] the Lord but Paul got a thus sayith the
[10:27] Lord Jesus from the Lord Jesus
[10:29] Hallelujah in a dream it's in Acts 23:10
[10:32] if you got your Bibles and when they
[10:34] arose I'm sorry and when there arose a
[10:36] great dissension the chief captain now
[10:38] Paul is right now being surrounded by
[10:39] Jews in Jerusalem and they want to kill
[10:42] him but God delivers him and God gives
[10:44] him wisdom to know oh if I if I if I
[10:47] mention I'm a Roman citizen then they
[10:49] can't they can't uh uh they can't
[10:51] execute me because they were breaking
[10:54] the Roman laws because the Roman laws
[10:56] were more important at that time than
[10:57] the Jewish laws of course because Rome
[10:58] was the uh governing power right but the
[11:02] Bible said in verse 10 fearing lest Paul
[11:04] should have been pulled in pieces of
[11:05] them so Paul was literally going to be
[11:07] pulled apart by this mob this is the
[11:10] kind of Trials he went through and this
[11:11] wasn't once in a while this was very
[11:13] common Paul was constantly suffering and
[11:17] even my wife showed me a good verse the
[11:18] other day remember when Jesus and his
[11:20] Apostles they were walking through the
[11:21] field and they took some corn why' they
[11:24] take corn on the Sabbath why did they
[11:26] take corn at all because they were very
[11:28] hungry yeah
[11:30] God let his own Apostles get very
[11:34] hungry God was there in flesh and let
[11:37] them feel the pain of hunger that's
[11:40] right right so God could be with you in
[11:43] your darkest hour and you say well
[11:44] surely God's not here and yet God is
[11:46] there hallelujah amen God will let us uh
[11:49] God let Paul be beaten right many times
[11:51] and stoned and Shipwrecked and hungering
[11:54] often fastings often yet God was behind
[11:56] it all
[11:57] Hallelujah this ought to help us to
[11:59] trust God more amen that's what I love
[12:01] learning about
[12:03] Paul you know I don't know about you but
[12:04] I imagine he'd be our spiritual father
[12:06] Hallelujah almost every Christian
[12:08] Hallelujah he'd be like a spiritual
[12:10] Father Figure
[12:12] amen so they were going to pull Paul in
[12:15] pieces you can imagine the crowd was
[12:17] pulling out his arms and they were going
[12:18] to pull him apart but he Comm they
[12:20] commanded the soldiers to go down and
[12:22] take him by force from among them and
[12:23] bring him to the castle verse 11 acts
[12:26] 23:11 and the night following the Lord
[12:29] stood by
[12:30] him so imagine you're at night time I
[12:33] don't know if it was a dream or Vision
[12:34] but then he's maybe laying down or maybe
[12:36] he's chained up and he sees the Lord and
[12:39] the Lord says be of good cheer Paul now
[12:42] he was just surrounded by a mob almost
[12:44] pulled apart and the Lord said be of
[12:47] good cheer God help us to have a good
[12:50] attitude when we go through trials
[12:52] amen but see that's what I love if we
[12:54] don't Jesus will come and say be of good
[12:56] cheer amen he'll help us to be cheerful
[13:00] despite trials Hallelujah remember he's
[13:02] got soldiers he's sleeping around
[13:04] soldiers that's what they did in those
[13:06] days right they didn't have prisons all
[13:08] over the place so a Roman soldier would
[13:10] chain himself to you right if you were
[13:13] arrested so Paul sleeping by these
[13:15] Romans by at least one Roman soldier
[13:18] yeah chained to one of them so they
[13:20] don't get away right he don't get away
[13:21] and the Lord shows to him himself and
[13:24] he's standing there and he says be of
[13:26] good cheer for as thou H has test
[13:29] testify to me in Jerusalem so must thou
[13:31] bear witness also at Rome hallelujah
[13:35] amen so he had thus say the Lord he was
[13:37] going to get to Rome amen now before
[13:40] this he'd already written a letter to
[13:41] them amen so isn't it awesome you know
[13:44] sometimes God you know you'll have a
[13:45] desire in your heart you'll not know if
[13:46] it's from God but then I like this Paul
[13:48] had this desire and the Lord came around
[13:50] and showed him this desire was of me
[13:52] Hallelujah in other words I put this
[13:54] desire in your heart hallelujah amen
[13:57] glory and then if God put in your heart
[13:59] God's going to bring it to pass
[14:05] Hallelujah John Gil said as Paul had
[14:07] bore a public and faithful witness to
[14:10] the person office and Grace of Jesus
[14:12] Christ at Jerusalem the Metropolis of
[14:15] Judea so it was necessary by the decree
[14:18] of decree of God and for the glory of
[14:20] Christ that he should bear a like
[14:22] testimony at Rome the chief City in all
[14:24] the world Amen I just it just struck me
[14:26] there God let Paul be a witness in the
[14:28] spirit spiritual center of the
[14:30] world as as a as a light but also as
[14:34] a as a a witness for or against whoever
[14:38] believed in the spiritual center of the
[14:40] kingdom of the world and then he set
[14:42] Paul as the same thing a light and a
[14:44] witness in the natural center of the
[14:46] world
[14:47] Hallelujah CH don't you know that's why
[14:49] God has Believers here in America right
[14:51] God's got to have witnesses in every
[14:53] nation right this was the richest nation
[14:56] of all right Rome and so God said I'm
[14:58] going to make you a witness there that's
[14:59] what God's done for us in America we
[15:01] must be Witnesses in the midst of this
[15:02] wickedness Hallelujah God needs a
[15:05] witness Hallelujah that's what he's
[15:07] called us to be to Bear witness to share
[15:09] your testimony in this city Hallelujah
[15:11] in this land amen
[15:14] amen then he said the Holy Spirit would
[15:16] signify that you'll not die at
[15:18] Jerusalem what a what a witness
[15:20] Hallelujah when God puts something on
[15:22] your heart and he comes around and
[15:23] vindicates it Hallelujah I love that
[15:26] amen now what Paul does now after this
[15:29] after this moment there in in Acts 23
[15:33] Paul later set sail to stand trial in
[15:36] Rome in Acts
[15:37] 27 so remember he said Lord I just pray
[15:40] make my journey
[15:42] prosperous amen and so what happens on
[15:45] the
[15:47] journey the ship
[15:49] sinks your car breaks
[15:52] down your house burns down you lose a
[15:55] loved one
[15:57] right he praise for a prosperous Journey
[16:01] right and that that's what we all want
[16:02] we want life to go so smoothly life
[16:04] didn't go so smoothly for Paul all the
[16:06] time but I love this and even this
[16:09] moment right even this moment he's we
[16:11] went back and uh looked at acts 23 he's
[16:14] surrounded by soldiers Christ appears to
[16:16] him before he sinks on the boat Christ
[16:19] appears to him amen hallelujah God gives
[16:22] you all these visitations amen the Holy
[16:24] Spirit visits you the Holy Spirit pours
[16:26] out his blessings God speaks to you
[16:29] Hallelujah he's always there he allows
[16:31] you to go through it to make you a more
[16:33] humble Christian to make your character
[16:35] more solid
[16:36] Hallelujah cuz power without character
[16:38] is satanic
[16:40] Hallelujah but character that's tested
[16:42] and tribe is fit to rule in the
[16:44] Millennium
[16:48] Hallelujah remember Church they didn't
[16:49] eat food for 14 days you can go read
[16:52] that in Acts 27 yes when was the last
[16:55] time he went two weeks without a meal
[16:57] and Paul finally had to convince him
[16:58] take some meat because it's going to be
[17:01] all right hallelujah amen no man will
[17:04] lose his life on the ship
[17:06] Hallelujah this was a common uh this was
[17:08] a common thing in Paul's life tests
[17:11] trials
[17:12] sufferings starvation right you know all
[17:15] these all these trials that would go
[17:17] through right he prayed for prosperity
[17:20] and God gave him Prosperity just in a
[17:22] different way
[17:23] hallelujah how many would believe it
[17:25] it's more prosperous uh to have all the
[17:28] solders lives saved than to just have an
[17:31] easy trip Hallelujah right it's more
[17:33] prosperous that these these prisoners
[17:35] are saved Hallelujah their lives are
[17:37] spared that's more prosperous than to
[17:40] have all the the the the cares of the
[17:42] world or ease of Life
[17:45] Hallelujah in other words God sparing
[17:47] lives and God saving Souls that's more
[17:50] important than an easy life or enough
[17:53] food or enough money or a a big enough
[17:56] house or a fast enough car whatever ever
[17:59] you whatever the the the cares of Life
[18:01] are what's most important is Souls
[18:05] Hallelujah Souls getting them to repent
[18:07] of their sins and be baptized in the
[18:10] name of Jesus Christ and then serve
[18:12] Jesus Christ right amen and overcome sin
[18:15] that's what's most important
[18:16] Hallelujah that's really being
[18:19] prosperous hallelujah it's to learn to
[18:21] love Jesus and to learn to love to hate
[18:23] sin Hallelujah that's what's Prosperity
[18:26] hallelujah amen that's what Paul and the
[18:29] angel visited member of the bottom of
[18:30] the ship and said not one man will lose
[18:32] his life Hallelujah everyone in the ship
[18:35] shall be saved hallelujah amen amen so
[18:39] this was his journey now he had all all
[18:41] his thoughts M I can't wait to make the
[18:43] CH trip to Rome he probably would not
[18:46] have maybe signed up for if he knew he
[18:48] was going to have to sink Hallelujah on
[18:50] a ship and the Bible said he Flo all
[18:53] night on a piece of wood yeah just lying
[18:56] there I see the same angel that was went
[18:59] with him in the ship was the same angel

[19:22] so unified they were so uh uh they had
[19:26] such understanding of the Gospel of
[19:27] Jesus Christ amen
[19:30] amen this is how God sometimes answers
[19:33] our
[19:34] prayers some through the waters some
[19:37] through the floods some through great
[19:39] trials but all through the blood
[19:42] Hallelujah we'll go through many trials
[19:44] but the main thing is confess your sins

[20:15] wood pieces of the ship and they all
[20:18] just drift over they all paddle over to
[20:20] the island of Mita that's where Paul you
[20:22] know they they instantly gather the wood
[20:24] Paul grabs the wood and a Viper comes
[20:26] out bites him you cast a Viper in the
[20:29] fire it burns up I like that that's what
[20:31] God does to all of our evil uh all of
[20:33] our evil spirits Hallelujah I like how
[20:35] he casted down the Viper that's the type
[20:37] of we must cast down anything that
[20:39] exalts itself against the word of
[20:42] God and that sin will be abolished in
[20:45] the Holy Fire of God hallelujah amen
[20:48] it'll be taken care of hallelujah amen
[20:50] but we got to cast it off of ourselves
[20:52] Hallelujah don't let that Viper stay on
[20:54] you don't let that sin stay on You cast
[20:57] it off Hallelujah
[20:59] say I'm done with this Hallelujah I'm

[21:31] prophetic gift from the foundation of
[21:33] the world Hallelujah it was just it
[21:34] wasn't me it was God
[21:36] hallelujah so now we pick up if you have
[21:38] your Bibles acts 28:1 we want to pick up
[21:41] at acts
[21:43] 2811 so he's on the island of Mita it's
[21:46] just a little bit south of the part of
[21:48] Italy called Sicily it's like on the
[21:50] boot of Italy if you're not it's the
[21:52] it's the sou southwestern part of Italy
[21:54] and I had all the pictures ready I had
[21:55] everything to show I just forgot about
[21:57] that so sorry
[21:59] Paul was sailing of course from
[22:02] CRE uh in the sea of Arabia and uh the
[22:05] ship of course was uh sunk but they all
[22:08] swam to
[22:10] Mita now in Acts
[22:12] 2811 Mal you want to read that 11 and uh
[22:15] 12 and after 3 months we departed in the
[22:18] ship of Alexandria which had wintered in
[22:20] the aisle whose sign was cter in poock
[22:22] and landing at ccus we carry there three
[22:25] days
[22:26] amen so uh
[22:29] we can see that you know uh the people
[22:31] Mita love Paul in fact Paul prayed for
[22:34] uh many of the sick on the island came
[22:35] to him and they were healed hallelujah
[22:38] hallelujah that's how they knew he was a
[22:39] man of God God heard his prayers
[22:42] Hallelujah uh there was a there was a
[22:44] blood issue there was numerous diseases
[22:46] the Bible said they came to Paul Paul
[22:48] healed them Hallelujah and notice Church
[22:50] all the prisoners around would have seen
[22:51] that right right cuz Paul had he was a
[22:54] prisoner right he was chained to another
[22:56] and think of that man Hallelujah think
[22:57] of that prisoner who would have been
[22:59] privileged to be changed to a prophet of
[23:01] God oh God may we be changed to the
[23:04] prophet of God Amen may we be so
[23:07] connected to brother Ram's Ministry
[23:08] Hallelujah I'm not ashamed of it amen
[23:11] you know brother Rod took me to he and I
[23:13] went to Overland on Friday he said
[23:16] brother Jesse I just want to tell you he
[23:17] said what I admire about you is that you
[23:19] stand by brother brandom you're not
[23:20] ashamed of brother brandom he he's
[23:22] trying to stand behind his former Pastor
[23:23] pass away and he said that's what I like
[23:25] about you you stand behind brother brand
[23:27] you defend him I said well that's what
[23:29] Paul said Paul said don't be ashamed of
[23:31] me his prisoner amen I'm not ashamed of
[23:33] brother brandom Hallelujah the people
[23:35] that are accusing brother brand guess
[23:36] what they got all these fingers pointing
[23:38] back at them Hallelujah right it's easy
[23:41] to point out somebody else's mistakes
[23:42] why don't you take that plug uh plank
[23:44] out of your eye and look at your
[23:46] mistakes
[23:47] amen remember who's accused of the
[23:49] Brethren Satan is accused of the
[23:51] Brethren hallelujah amen oh we're
[23:54] grateful to stand behind God's Prophet
[23:56] amen amen so they they uh they stayed
[23:59] there I think 3 months and then when it
[24:01] became Springtime they left and went to
[24:02] Syracuse as Malachi read there sorry I
[24:05] got the wrong
[24:07] page there we go and then the 12 they
[24:11] landed at Syracuse and they stayed there
[24:13] 3 days hallelujah then in verse 13 they
[24:16] went from Syracuse up to regium which is
[24:20] a one- day travel and then they travel
[24:22] to
[24:24] patoli I'm not probably not saying that
[24:26] right but they're getting closer and
[24:28] closer as they're heading north west
[24:30] they're getting closer and closer to
[24:32] Rome where Paul had waited all these
[24:34] years amen hallelujah he waited all
[24:37] these years now look at verse
[24:39] 14 we found I'm sorry where we found
[24:42] Brethren so in pulio they found Brethren
[24:45] and were desired to T with them seven
[24:47] days and so he went toward
[24:50] Rome so notice they found Brethren amen
[24:54] they found Christians remember Paul's
[24:56] not alone he's got a group of prisoners
[24:58] with him right it was likely Saints who'
[25:01] heard and these are probably saints that
[25:03] had read Paul's letter to the
[25:06] Romans like wow I get to meet the man
[25:09] who wrote this inspired thus sayith the
[25:11] Lord Bible I get to me meet the man that
[25:14] wrote the Bible
[25:15] amen what a statement amen what an
[25:18] opportunity Hallelujah I get to meet the
[25:21] man who saw Jesus after he died and
[25:24] Rose Paul said I saw him last right
[25:27] Peter saw him first I'm sorry the women
[25:29] saw him verse then he went to Peter
[25:31] right and he said but last of all he was
[25:33] seen of me as well amen amen
[25:36] hallelujah and so they these Brethren
[25:38] found out they go to meet
[25:41] Paul so this uh so it's probably been
[25:44] six years since Paul wrote this letter
[25:47] and so six years after having this
[25:49] having the Scrolls of Paul and reading
[25:51] the book of Romans now they get to meet
[25:53] the man who wrote it
[25:54] Hallelujah and Paul's desire gets to be
[25:57] fulfilled now
[25:58] he's meeting Saints all these Christians
[26:01] around Rome Hallelujah God's given him
[26:03] his great desires hallelujah amen see
[26:06] Church many of our great desires you
[26:08] know sometimes we don't understand we
[26:10] might have to go through a lot of things
[26:12] in order to receive them that's right
[26:14] amen Paul waited at least six or seven
[26:17] years to get his great desire to meet
[26:19] the Saints Hallelujah but when he does
[26:21] it was a great blessing Hallelujah
[26:24] there's much comfort there amen am
[26:27] Hallelujah God game his heart's
[26:29] desire now I love what John Gil said
[26:31] he's a preacher from the
[26:33] 1800s he says Christians at pulio
[26:37] desired the Apostle Apostle and those
[26:39] that were with him to stay a week with
[26:41] them that they might have the advantage
[26:42] of a day of public worship together so
[26:45] they wanted him to stay seven days so he
[26:46] could be there on Sunday to preach the
[26:48] word of God Amen just like we're doing
[26:51] today amen isn't that your desire you
[26:53] know when we have guest preachers can't
[26:54] that's why I have guest preachers in on
[26:56] Sunday amen but if we can't get them for
[26:58] Sunday we'll get them for Wednesday amen
[27:00] we'll have to I I've seen cam do that
[27:02] they've called special meetings on
[27:03] Thursday and brother Randy SC has done
[27:05] that if they can only get a preacher for
[27:06] one day they want to have service with
[27:08] that preacher
[27:10] amen amen stay a weak and we can have
[27:14] the advantage of a day of public worship
[27:16] enjoy the Christian
[27:19] conversation but notice this all had to
[27:21] be granted by and this historian gives
[27:24] the name of Julius the Centurion so
[27:27] apparently the Centurion who was with
[27:28] them was
[27:29] Julius that was the one of the the
[27:31] leader of all the the Roman
[27:34] soldiers now this shows here uh this
[27:38] writer says this shows that he used the
[27:41] Apostle with great Civility and
[27:43] courteousness and was very ready to
[27:46] Grant him
[27:47] favors now this is awesome why would a
[27:50] Roman guard Centurion honor Paul's
[27:54] wishes today hey let's take a week off
[27:57] uh you know we're we're heading back we
[27:58] got orders to get back to bring all
[28:01] these prisoners but we'll we'll wait a
[28:02] week wow just for you Paul a I wonder
[28:06] why I wonder if Jesus appeared to them
[28:08] as well amen hallelujah this Roman
[28:11] centor would delay their trip they got
[28:13] orders strict orders but the Roman
[28:16] Centurion gave Paul favor you know why
[28:18] because he's a real Christian
[28:20] hallelujah amen I wonder if they saw the
[28:23] Lord as the Lord appeared to Paul see
[28:26] Church you'll get special favors if
[28:27] you're a real Christian we see amen get
[28:30] it all the time I like how Who Will Pray
[28:32] that's just a small example amen
[28:34] hallelujah pray that my husband can come
[28:36] to
[28:37] church I love it amen Church look for
[28:40] special favors God will give them to you
[28:42] praise God Amen because you're a
[28:44] faithful believer hallelujah amen God
[28:46] will give you favor in the eyes of
[28:48] people
[28:50] amen
[28:52] hallelujah and so they journeyed on
[28:54] towards Rome Hallelujah but they had a
[28:56] week off in order to have some Services
[28:59] Glory verse 15 and from then when the
[29:02] Brethren heard of us they came to meet
[29:03] us as far as AI forum and the three
[29:08] taverns whom when Paul saw he thanked
[29:10] God and took courage amen so now they
[29:15] travel even closer to Rome now they're
[29:17] not too far from Rome we'd
[29:19] say and so Paul and the prisoners
[29:21] finally I'm sorry they're getting real
[29:23] close and Paul begins to see more and
[29:26] more of his desires fulfilled
[29:29] these Saints are hearing about him you
[29:30] know letters took a long time to travel
[29:32] they take months to travel in those days
[29:34] but yet God allowed enough time where
[29:36] the letters could get out and they could
[29:38] come see the servant of
[29:40] Goden heading to his final destination
[29:43] on this
[29:45] Earth at least for 2,000 years amen he
[29:48] he's he's coming back to the Earth amen
[29:50] hallelujah the dead in Christ will rise
[29:53] first hallelujah amen God but on his
[29:55] Earthly Journey here while living in
[29:57] this pest house we'd say or the body of
[29:59] this
[30:00] flesh Paul's walking his final Road
[30:04] think about that he's walking his final
[30:06] steps on this Earth before the
[30:08] Millennium
[30:09] Hallelujah and so Paul he gets to meet
[30:12] with these Saints and notice when he
[30:13] meets them what does he do he thanks God
[30:16] and he takes
[30:17] courage in other words imagine why would
[30:19] he be encouraged by these Christians
[30:21] because they no doubt heard his word and
[30:23] they kept the word of God
[30:25] hallelujah and then of course he's he's
[30:27] encouraged my I I prayed for many years
[30:29] I prayed for you every day for all these
[30:32] years and now I get to see you face to
[30:34] face hallelujah amen oh my what a
[30:37] blessing so he takes a moment thank you
[30:39] Lord that I could have my great desire
[30:42] fulfilled in my heart and I get to see
[30:44] the Saints from Rome
[30:46] Hallelujah and he took courage
[30:48] Hallelujah if all these Saints are
[30:49] praying for me if God gave me the
[30:50] desires of my heart I know I'm right the
[30:52] perfect will of God hallelujah I'm doing
[30:55] exactly what Jesus has called me to do
[30:57] amen amen
[30:58] Oh Glory verse 16 and finally the
[31:02] prophet's desires fulfilled after years
[31:04] of waiting there's a finally I like that
[31:07] amen amen Church you might wait many
[31:08] years but finally it's going to happen
[31:11] Hallelujah right we can say finally
[31:13] brother William has come back to akan
[31:15] Hallelujah finally after two years of
[31:18] waiting and church one of these days the
[31:20] finally is going to be a reality
[31:24] Hallelujah like finally Austin's back
[31:26] and finally their married Hallelujah
[31:28] that's what I said finally I'm married
[31:30] amen we're coming up on 21 years on
[31:33] Friday June's a pretty awesome month
[31:36] Hallelujah for lots of reasons finally
[31:39] we we dream we dream about things we
[31:40] pray for things we ask God for things he
[31:42] takes us through trials and and Dark
[31:44] Places and tests things we wouldn't ask
[31:47] for but yet finally we get a fulfillment
[31:49] to our desires amen Paul finally gets
[31:53] there in Rome in verse 16 amen and when
[31:56] we came to Rome the Centurion delivered
[31:57] the prisoners to the captain of the
[31:59] Guard so all the prisoners go to the
[32:01] captain of the Guard into the prison but
[32:04] not
[32:05] Paul Hallelujah but Paul was suffered to
[32:09] dwell by himself with a soldier that
[32:14] kept him now Paul's Paul's crime was way
[32:18] less severe than these other prisoners
[32:20] right so it's likely because he had such
[32:22] a small uh charge against him he was
[32:25] allowed to live in a hired house
[32:28] right but he remained chained to the
[32:32] soldier right today they got those
[32:34] bracelets right thank God I've never
[32:36] worn them Hallelujah but if you have
[32:39] God's God's gracious amen but see they
[32:42] got those today to keep track of you
[32:44] those days they didn't have them so had
[32:45] to be chained to a Roman
[32:49] soldier now acts 28 verse 20 says he was
[32:52] chained look at verse 20 for this cause
[32:55] therefore have I called for you to see
[32:57] you and this speak with you because that
[32:58] for the hope of Israel I'm bound with
[33:01] this chain wow wow so he's he's bound
[33:07] right he is connected to a
[33:09] soldier right and there's all these
[33:12] stories I've heard over the years of how
[33:13] this Soldier probably got
[33:15] saved seeing the Holy Spirit he are the
[33:17] sick on Molita amen glory he would have
[33:20] saw Paul come up and say don't fret
[33:22] every man's life will be saved thus
[33:24] sayith the Lord amen amen that's right
[33:27] no doubt this man would have seen these
[33:28] men would have seen the power of God on
[33:31] Paul they would have seen thus sayith
[33:33] the Lord hallelujah amen I like what a
[33:35] preacher I heard a preacher say now here
[33:38] Paul in Rome now he gets a captive
[33:40] audience you know captive audience means
[33:42] they're listening to like you are all
[33:44] doing today nobody's
[33:45] sleeping nobody's uh throwing spit wids
[33:48] like they did in high school when I was
[33:49] in high school you know nobody's on
[33:52] their phone by God's grace you know but
[33:54] you're captive you're you're listening
[33:56] you're paying attention but here Paul
[33:58] had a different typee of captive
[33:59] audience the captive audience was the
[34:02] soldier who was like a captive to him
[34:04] amen amen praise God so see church God
[34:08] is going to put you in situations God
[34:09] knew the soldier that would be there God
[34:11] knew all this God orchestrates
[34:13] everything Hallelujah God's Great desire
[34:16] is to get us to hear the gospel accept
[34:18] the gospel and spread the gospel amen
[34:22] that's our great desire how can we do
[34:23] that
[34:25] Hallelujah this is the Great plan of God
[34:29] as we'll see don't forget because some
[34:31] of these things might be familiar to you
[34:32] as we read on here in verse 17 through
[34:36] 29 I'm not going to read these but Paul
[34:38] once he's there in Rome he's got his own
[34:39] hired house now and some people say you
[34:42] know some brothers paid for it maybe he
[34:43] paid for with his earnings we don't know
[34:45] but he calls all these Jews together
[34:47] once he's in Rome to testify about Jesus
[34:51] some believe and some don't just like
[34:52] today some of your friends will believe
[34:55] some of your family members will believe
[34:57] some won't
[34:59] right and Paul said this is a
[35:01] fulfillment of scripture he said most of
[35:04] these hearts of the Jews he said their
[35:06] hearts are waxed gross which means thick
[35:09] their hearts are thickened which means a
[35:12] callous got a calluses on your hands
[35:15] which means they don't feel their hearts
[35:18] don't feel the gospel like you
[35:21] do Paul felt the gospel Paul felt the
[35:25] cross of Jesus Christ Paul F felt the
[35:28] resurrection amen hallelujah he felt it
[35:31] yeah church that's what we got to be
[35:32] careful we got to feel the preaching of
[35:34] the Gospel we have to have a heart for
[35:38] Hallelujah that's why I enjoyed visiting
[35:40] Oberland with brother uh Rod there
[35:43] Charles finny was he was hated by most
[35:45] people in his day but he also won over a
[35:47] million Souls that's right and maybe his
[35:50] methods weren't exactly right but what
[35:51] he was doing he was bringing the people
[35:54] out of starch presbyterianism that's
[35:56] right right so we had to use different
[35:58] methods amen but God blessed him
[36:01] Hallelujah because he was he was trying
[36:03] to get he you know he had what was
[36:04] called a MERS bench and he would preach
[36:09] he would preach hell hot and Heaven
[36:13] high in other words he would say if you
[36:16] don't repent you can go to hell right
[36:19] repent of your sins and he would stop in
[36:22] the middle of service and he would say
[36:23] now whose soul is
[36:25] anxious that they need to get close to
[36:27] God and he would said come on up and sit
[36:29] on the they called it the anxious bench
[36:31] that's right so the first row was the
[36:33] anxious
[36:36] bench and then he would he would take
[36:38] his time and just in the first row he
[36:40] would you should see the pictures if
[36:42] you've ever seen a picture of Charles
[36:44] PNY you need to see it he was Ohio man
[36:46] hallah of course he moved to Ohio
[36:48] amen but he would just stare at them and
[36:51] try to convict them of their sins are
[36:52] you ready to repent and you're guilty of
[36:54] this You Must Escape hell and that's how
[36:58] he was so successful because the other
[37:00] method was just Presbyterians you know
[37:02] just behind the pulpit with their phds
[37:04] and llds just putting the people to
[37:07] sleep see their hearts were wax gross
[37:09] they didn't feel the gospel but vny made
[37:11] us feel it hallelujah amen in other
[37:14] words you need to feel the weight of
[37:16] your sin if you don't repent you will go
[37:18] to hell right
[37:21] Hallelujah and most of us are saved here
[37:23] so what I would say is if you don't
[37:25] repent you're going to suffer Hallelujah
[37:26] that's right even more than what you
[37:29] might sin will always find you out
[37:33] hallelujah
[37:35] amen and so the Presby would would uh
[37:38] would would belittle him oh he's got
[37:40] this mortar's bench and he lets sisters
[37:42] pray sometimes and all the all these
[37:46] accusations oh he stares at the people
[37:48] and his voice is really loud and they
[37:50] were blaspheming the Holy
[37:52] Ghost right as they sat in their their
[37:55] dead Presbyterian churches
[37:58] MH but what was he trying to do he was
[38:01] trying to get the people to not be so
[38:03] hard-hearted yeah but to be tender
[38:05] towards the
[38:06] gospel I've always appreciated that
[38:08] sermon God gave me about the red
[38:10] heer see if you touch anything dead you
[38:13] couldn't even get into the gate you
[38:15] couldn't even get in for seven days
[38:17] remember that in other words you
[38:18] couldn't even see you couldn't
[38:20] appreciate the blood sacrifice it meant
[38:22] nothing to you cuz you touch you touch
[38:24] dead stuffff I think I'm going to preach
[38:26] that down there to to the saints that
[38:28] maybe this Thursday on uh Junction City
[38:31] but that that's how it is church we got
[38:32] to be careful with that if we touch dead
[38:34] things if we're mingling with sin then
[38:35] the cross won't mean anything to us it
[38:38] becomes a dead religion it becomes dead
[38:41] to us and church we come in and out of
[38:43] it remember BR man says there's times I
[38:45] don't even feel like I'm saved right
[38:47] that's because we spend too much time in
[38:48] the flesh God help us to repent
[38:50] hallelujah we're still saved we still
[38:53] got the Holy Ghost we're still going to
[38:54] heaven but we're not living we're not
[38:56] being able to feel the gospel like we
[38:58] ought to
[39:00] amen I want people to look at me and say
[39:02] boy that guy's on fire Hallelujah not
[39:04] just while I'm preaching but while I'm
[39:06] at home amen while I'm at work while I'm
[39:09] out and about I want people to see that
[39:11] man's got a fire for Christ he's tender
[39:13] towards the
[39:14] gospel what does that mean church just
[39:16] being willing uh quick to pray just
[39:19] quick to pray for somebody at the store
[39:21] quick to pray for somebody if you get a
[39:22] text just bow your head and pray just re
[39:24] recognize God's presence in our lives
[39:27] amen
[39:28] not having a hard heart where you don't
[39:31] feel the needs anymore yeah Paul said
[39:35] they have he's quoting Isaiah 69 they
[39:37] have ears they can't hear they have eyes
[39:39] they can't see they can't see what's
[39:41] going on they can't hear the gospel
[39:43] their hearts don't understand he said
[39:46] and then because of that they won't get
[39:47] healed yeah which means a cure that's
[39:51] right see there's a cure for your sin
[39:53] problem all of us amen like I said
[39:56] letting that V or stay attached detach
[39:59] it amen separate yourself that's what
[40:01] the heavenly father said in 2
[40:03] Corinthians 6 he said come out from
[40:05] among them amen separate yourself amen
[40:08] and I will be a God I'll be a father
[40:10] unto you amen oh
[40:14] Hallelujah God says I'll be a father but
[40:17] I'm calling you away from the worldly
[40:19] sins I'm calling you away from bad
[40:21] habens I'm calling you away from sin and
[40:23] Temptation amen amen amen
[40:28] he said they they won't receive the
[40:29] healing they their hearts won't be
[40:31] converted which means turned around or
[40:35] repenting see we have to recognize that
[40:37] our our lives have turned around my life
[40:39] was going in a certain direction but
[40:41] when the love of Jesus was showed to me
[40:43] I turned it around and I'm going in a
[40:45] different direction Hallelujah I'm
[40:47] pressing on towards the mark of the High
[40:50] Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[40:52] hallelujah amen
[40:54] amen church we live in a wonderful time
[40:56] where the word of God has been restored
[40:58] let me just share this in that city of

[41:03] it was started by Christians I think I
[41:06] showed it to my wife if you join that
[41:08] City it was a Christian City that's how
[41:10] it started if you joined it you had the
[41:12] sign of pledge I'm not going to wear
[41:14] tight clothing if you're a sister it's
[41:18] right there it's on the it's on the it's
[41:19] on the uh the charter you want to be a
[41:22] part of this time no tight clothes now
[41:25] here's the hard thing for me they would
[41:26] said no tea and no coffee
[41:30] wow cuz they said it was bad for your
[41:32] health but now scientists say it's good
[41:34] for
[41:37] you thank God Amen but also no tobacco
[41:41] use look they recognized
[41:43] it if you want to be a part of that now
[41:46] look that was that was uh the man
[41:48] anointing right brother said that was
[41:51] the third seal the anointing of the man
[41:54] and that was sanctification Hallelujah
[41:57] and you had to sign a charter and if you
[41:59] broke the law you had a
[42:01] fine right maybe jail time now look we
[42:05] live in a time of more grace we got more
[42:07] understanding right amen but I hope you
[42:10] think next time you drink that Diet Coke
[42:12] it's going to hurt your hurt your body
[42:13] amen don't do that don't get addicted to
[42:16] things like that if it's going to hurt
[42:17] you right right but look at the look at
[42:21] devotion that was just 150 years ago
[42:23] look at the devotion of these people
[42:25] they said to stay keep our body's
[42:27] healthy that we can serve god without
[42:29] distraction
[42:31] amen look at that I was blown
[42:35] away brother BR said in one place he
[42:37] said Charles Vinny uh could have been
[42:39] the greatest preacher since St
[42:42] Paul but he also said the same thing
[42:44] about Columba if you remember that from
[42:46] the church age book so these were some
[42:47] of the most I would say most humble men
[42:50] used by God because we don't like to
[42:52] call people great but they were greatly
[42:54] used by God I'll say it like that
[43:00] all that's
[43:03] verses sorry that's all the way down to
[43:05] verse 28 and 29 now verse 30 let's read
[43:08] 30 and 31 I want to make a few
[43:10] statements on these oh good I'm doing
[43:11] great on time
[43:13] amen verse 30 acts
[43:17] 28:30 yes Paul made it to Rome
[43:19] Hallelujah God gave him his heart's
[43:21] desire amen and Paul dwelt two whole
[43:24] years in his own hired house
[43:27] and received all what a blessing that
[43:32] came in unto
[43:35] him now look he's chained up to a a
[43:39] guard all 24/7 I think think about that
[43:42] just using the restroom think of how his
[43:44] privacy is think how his privacy is
[43:47] violated right he's chained up to him
[43:51] 247 and you think my he's a prisoner
[43:54] he's got court
[43:56] [Music]
[44:01] but the Bible says he received all I
[44:03] love that Jesus opened a door that no
[44:06] man could shut
[44:08] Hallelujah any in other words anyone
[44:10] that wanted to hear the word of God
[44:12] could hear the word of
[44:14] God what did Paul call that man that
[44:16] Deputy that wanted to stop somebody from
[44:18] hearing the gospel he said oh Child full
[44:20] of sub subtility thou child of this of
[44:23] the devil the Bible
[44:24] say uh the sorcerer man he said you're a
[44:27] child of the devil you're trying to
[44:28] hinder somebody word of God but now God
[44:30] puts him in a place he's a prisoner amen
[44:32] but anyone who wants to hear the word of
[44:34] God in Rome can come right to him
[44:36] Hallelujah remember that list we read
[44:38] last Sunday of all those names in there
[44:40] Rufus and
[44:41] them
[44:43] Phoebe anyone who wanted to spend time
[44:46] yeah anyone who wanted a personal
[44:47] interview with the prophet of God could
[44:49] get a personal interview
[44:51] Hallelujah for two years
[44:55] amen for two years anyone who wanted to
[44:58] be with the prophet of God could be with
[44:59] the prophet of
[45:02] godh oh it's
[45:05] beautiful he received all that came unto
[45:08] him so if God opens a door no man can
[45:10] shut that door that's how we look at our
[45:12] jobs right God opens the door nobody can
[45:14] shut it if God wants me to have this job
[45:15] nobody's going to stop it
[45:19] right verse 31 preaching the kingdom of
[45:22] God the Dominion the rule of God true
[45:26] see God wants the rule rule your life
[45:27] right now that's what the kingdom is
[45:29] when the Kingdom's in you God rules your
[45:31] life amen you don't do what you want to
[45:33] do you do what the kingdom of God wants
[45:35] you to do amen right that's why I like
[45:38] you know uh Charles Fin and those guys
[45:40] they were just trying to give their
[45:41] people an understanding you got to be
[45:43] fully devoted to Christ amen
[45:46] right amen the kingdom of God has to
[45:49] rule your
[45:50] life and teaching he was preaching
[45:53] declaring and instructing giving
[45:56] teaching those things which concern the
[45:58] Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no
[46:02] man forbidding him
[46:04] amen nobody could stop Paul's sermon if
[46:07] he want to preach all night he could
[46:08] preach all night Hallelujah he would
[46:10] have special services or prayer services
[46:12] he could have them nobody forbid him
[46:15] amen he had full Liberty of the Holy
[46:17] Spirit In Rome Hallelujah am oh my it's
[46:22] beautiful he enjoyed two full years now
[46:24] Church remember uh Acts 20 says he gave
[46:28] the Ephesians the whole counsel of God
[46:30] in three years so I believe it was
[46:33] possible also Paul gave the Romans the
[46:35] whole counsel of God because he was
[46:37] there two full
[46:39] years and this allowed Jesus and his
[46:43] promise to be fulfilled that Paul would
[46:46] bear record of him in Rome amen he could
[46:49] be there two years and teach the gospel
[46:52] hallelujah
[46:54] amen God did that Hallelujah so after
[46:58] these two years he was either martyred
[47:01] by
[47:02] Nero or he traveled to Spain in other
[47:05] nations and then came back to Rome
[47:07] historians are are not sure we we're not
[47:09] given the record right even the book of
[47:11] Acts it ends it doesn't say anything
[47:12] would happen it doesn't say anything
[47:13] about Paul's death that means Luke who
[47:16] wrote the book of Acts probably passed
[47:18] away shortly thereafter or that was the
[47:20] last or Paul was still there during that
[47:21] time we don't know exactly what happened
[47:24] to us now go to uh Philippians 1:
[47:32] Paul being
[47:34] arrested helped spread the
[47:40] gospel it looked like he'd lost all his
[47:42] freedom but what he did he actually
[47:44] gained more
[47:46] freedom in Christ because through this
[47:49] imprisonment he wrote these five or six
[47:52] Epistles maybe six or
[47:55] seven see God shut his God shut his life
[47:58] down am and it looked like oh the worst
[48:00] thing would be the worst thing that
[48:01] could happen was I'd be a prisoner not
[48:03] when you're a prisoner for Christ amen
[48:06] oh hallelujah amen
[48:09] amen remember how many you remember
[48:11] brother Levi remember Levi the former
[48:13] Amish guy how did he get saved in a
[48:17] prison in a
[48:19] prison glory
[48:22] amen and how did he hear the message
[48:24] another former message believer he was
[48:26] was here he was in that Sanctuary before
[48:28] he went to
[48:29] prison and I preached on Saul and he he
[48:32] come after me crying in that parking lot
[48:33] he said I'm
[48:34] Saul I You Preach my life today other
[48:38] words I knew the word of God but I got
[48:39] an evil spirit on me and it ruined part
[48:41] of my
[48:42] life and then that man went to prison to
[48:45] witness to brother Levi and now Levi
[48:47] they built that big church you you seen
[48:49] that church they got a big church down
[48:50] there it's an Outreach to the Amish so
[48:53] let's see what God does with it amen
[48:54] amen it's amazing God had his brother
[48:57] donate all this land and then all these
[48:59] message people come in and built this
[49:00] big huge church it's only 45 minutes
[49:02] south of us Navar
[49:05] Ohio God did that amen no wonder that
[49:08] man's so grateful he was in prison
[49:11] naturally and spiritually but Jesus got
[49:14] him out hallelujah amen Jesus broke the
[49:16] chains Hallelujah some men God have to
[49:19] get in prison to wake them up amen amen
[49:23] and give them a chance to sit still just
[49:25] sit there and listen to the gospel amen
[49:29] amen a't that beautiful praise God God
[49:32] some men are so rebellious which is okay
[49:35] that's part of their testimony God has
[49:36] to put them in there just so they'll be
[49:38] still for a few moments to hear the word
[49:39] of
[49:42] God so let let let in other words let's
[49:45] build into our lives moments every day
[49:47] where we can be still and hear God's
[49:49] voice amen let's not be too busy for
[49:51] Jesus
[49:53] Christ hallelujah amen that's not be too
[49:57] busy we can't even brother you don't
[49:58] even have time to spend with your
[49:59] heavenly father let's not be too busy to
[50:02] ignore our father on Father's Day right
[50:04] natural and
[50:05] spiritual this morning I sent my dad all
[50:07] these texts because I know he doesn't
[50:09] check them but they come I saw them when
[50:11] I was there all the all the texts come
[50:13] up and he has to swipe them away so I
[50:16] sent like five or six pictures of him
[50:17] and I when we were children when I was a
[50:18] child you know love you Dad praying for
[50:21] you on Father's Day Philippians 1:7 even
[50:25] as it is meat for me to think this of
[50:27] you all because I have you in my heart
[50:29] amen that's where I want to be I want to
[50:30] be in the heart of a Preacher Hallelujah
[50:32] I want to be the heart of a
[50:35] Christian in so much as both in my bonds
[50:38] and in the defense and confirmation of
[50:40] the Gospel you're all partakers of my
[50:42] grace so look Paul says listen I'm in
[50:43] bonds right now I'm in
[50:45] prison while writing this letter
[50:48] remember we preach this verse 12
[50:50] Philippians 1:12 but I would ye should
[50:53] understand Brethren that the things
[50:54] which happened unto me have fallen out
[50:55] rather for the the furtherance of the
[50:57] Gospel amen amen now we wouldn't think
[51:00] that we wouldn't think a a shipwreck we
[51:04] wouldn't sh think being stranded on an
[51:06] island we wouldn't think being locked up
[51:08] with a prisoner for two years with no
[51:10] privacy we wouldn't think that would be
[51:12] further the gospel but God's ways are
[51:14] higher than our ways
[51:16] amen think about how the gospel came to
[51:19] you somehow it had to come to you in a
[51:22] certain way where you'd finally receive
[51:23] it praise God God might had to chase you
[51:26] across the country to get your attention
[51:28] amen but God will chase you down cuz
[51:30] he's a loving father
[51:32] amen God might have to send you away
[51:34] from your family like some rebellious
[51:36] people might have to send you across the
[51:38] state where you don't know anybody to
[51:40] get you sad to get you lonely so then he
[51:43] can show you his mercy and his love
[51:45] Hallelujah but God does things many
[51:47] times different than what we think but
[51:49] it's a furtherance of the
[51:51] Gospel now think how many people have in
[51:54] ACR now have heard the message because
[51:55] we're here right how many online around
[51:58] the world have heard the gospel see all
[52:01] these things happen for a furtherance of
[52:03] the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen oh don't
[52:06] be discouraged friends Hallelujah be
[52:08] happy in the Lord amen verse 13 so that
[52:11] my Bonds in Christ are manifest listen
[52:13] in all the
[52:16] palace and in all other places so Paul
[52:18] was in a hired house but all remember
[52:21] all those all those uh prisoners that
[52:24] were with him and all the guards they
[52:26] took this news of these miracles of Paul
[52:29] and it spread through the entire Palace
[52:30] in Rome amen right everybody heard about
[52:33] this man who stoed up there and said
[52:35] thus sayith the Lord amen not a soul
[52:38] will die of all these prisoners and and
[52:40] all these centurions thus sayith the
[52:42] Lord now maybe it wasn't as that
[52:44] dramatic you know maybe he's tired I
[52:46] haven't eaten for 14 days th say the
[52:49] Lord but see it impacted them so much
[52:52] Paul said see this everything works
[52:54] together for good and because I was
[52:56] arrested all these things because of all
[52:58] this now the gospel has spread and now
[53:00] these people have hope and but they're
[53:03] without excuse as well Hallelujah some
[53:05] will believe some won't but thank God
[53:08] God furthers the good news of Christ
[53:10] amen hallelujah amen all of the Roman
[53:15] Palace that includes
[53:18] Nero the leader of the Free World even
[53:21] he knew about the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[53:24] verse 14 and many the bre of the Lord
[53:27] waxing Confident by my bonds are much
[53:30] more bold to speak the word without fear
[53:32] so remember all these brothers coming to
[53:33] see Paul right on his journey and they
[53:35] knew Paul was arrested then they they
[53:37] saw Paul at his hired house it just
[53:39] strengthened them they thought my if
[53:41] that man can Rejoice while being
[53:43] persecuted if that man can sit under
[53:45] that anointing and write a Bible yet
[53:47] being a prisoner that makes me confident
[53:50] that Christ is with me amen if he's
[53:53] faithful despite his trials I can be
[53:55] faithful in my light affliction
[53:57] amen see this didn't discourage them it
[54:00] actually encouraged them see how it's so
[54:03] beyond our thoughts what if one of us
[54:05] would get arrested for being a Christian
[54:06] like and they beat you one of us would
[54:08] be in jail that would discourage us but
[54:11] Paul said this actually encouraged and
[54:13] made them more
[54:15] bold Hallelujah you know why CU they
[54:18] knew Paul wouldn't recant of Jesus
[54:21] Christ not only am I do I want God's
[54:24] blessings for my life but I also want
[54:26] God blessing even if I I lose my
[54:29] Liberty in other words I want I just
[54:31] want what God has for my life I'm not
[54:33] just interested in the blessings God's
[54:35] not my earing boy whatever he allows
[54:37] I'll serve him anyway Hallelujah whether
[54:40] good times or bad times Hallelujah I'll
[54:42] still serve God because he's God
[54:44] hallelujah amen
[54:47] amen what do they call he wasn't some
[54:50] fair weather fan or fair weather
[54:51] Christian that's what they call him
[54:53] brother in U in America so like at a
[54:55] football game if your team's winning
[54:57] you'll go but if they're losing you
[54:58] won't go to the game they call you a
[55:00] fair weather fan you only show up in
[55:01] Good
[55:02] Times that's what Paul's Dre I'm not a
[55:04] fairweather Christian right if it's nice
[55:07] out there's no trials I'll go to church
[55:09] I'll be happy I'll see God I'll see no
[55:12] we got to be faithful Christians no
[55:13] matter the good times the bad times
[55:15] whether I'm on top of the mountain or
[55:17] whether I'm in the Valley God is God
[55:20] Amen he deserves Our Praise Hallelujah I
[55:23] know it's hard but church we just got to
[55:25] give him a sacri rice of Praise amen
[55:28] glory you know I looked back at a few of
[55:30] my sermons from a few weeks months ago
[55:32] when I was going through my darkest
[55:33] trials and I was like wow I I saw my God
[55:36] was able to anoint me and then some of
[55:38] you said God spoke to you like I'm going
[55:40] through my wor some of my hardest trials
[55:42] and yet God's able to use me that's what
[55:45] I love about God that's what I love
[55:46] about gathering together it's like an
[55:47] escape from the things of the world
[55:49] that's righten the Bible says remember
[55:51] we looked at it last week peer pressure
[55:53] nature we get we're supposed to flee
[55:54] evil right but in a way we get to flee
[55:57] all of our problems and come into the
[55:59] presence of God and spend time with God
[56:01] and God will pour out his blessings upon
[56:03] us amen oh my I love it amen this is my
[56:07] this is my refuge this my City of Refuge
[56:11] amen I can come into the house of God
[56:13] give him a sacrifice of praise and say
[56:15] God this is really hard but I give you a
[56:17] sacrifice and that's the kind God loves
[56:20] hallelujah
[56:22] amen thank you Jesus
[56:27] so made them more
[56:30] bold to see Paul chained to a prisoner
[56:34] but yet he's still preaching the gospel
[56:37] you know some people criticize preachers
[56:38] you know like I heard one
[56:40] time I heard two occasions there's a
[56:43] preacher in uh England in the message
[56:47] and he's in a
[56:48] wheelchair and he he's got like a
[56:51] disease and and uh I think it's muscular
[56:54] distrophy or uh it's either MD or Ms I
[56:57] can never remember the difference but
[56:59] he'll go to the pulpit and they got to
[57:00] come all he all he can really use is his
[57:02] hands in his mouth everything else is
[57:04] lost its ability to move he'll come to
[57:06] the pulpit and while he's preaching they
[57:09] have to somebody has to come by and wipe
[57:10] the spit that comes out of his mouth and
[57:13] I've heard people criticize that man I
[57:16] would say no I would try to encourage
[57:17] that
[57:19] man because he's giving God all that he
[57:22] has what if you had that disease right
[57:25] it's easy to criticize people when
[57:27] you're not going through the
[57:29] trial right that makes if that makes me
[57:31] think if that man can preach what can I
[57:33] do I got the whole use of my body what
[57:35] should I do I admire Faith like
[57:41] that people criticize and then another
[57:43] man I've been talking to he's blind n
[57:45] physically blind and people have
[57:47] criticized and say why don't you believe
[57:49] for your healing well why don't you
[57:50] believe for
[57:51] it have you ever been blind
[57:54] before I I take courage he just sent me
[57:57] a message this week he said brother
[57:58] Jesse I just wanted to send you a
[58:00] message of me singing and clapping
[58:02] because it's through your dance sermons
[58:03] that I'm able to clap now he's like
[58:06] singing I'm one of them just it's a
[58:09] seven minute long audio of him praising
[58:11] God he said brother Jesse that was just
[58:13] for
[58:14] you I said glory amen if there's
[58:17] anything I can do to help you praise God
[58:19] that God use me to do it
[58:22] Hallelujah he said me brother is it okay
[58:25] to really clap allowed for
[58:27] Jesus I said yeah but don't injure your
[58:31] daughter's he's not married though I
[58:34] said be
[58:36] careful sometimes Zales up our
[58:39] wisdom but look at this it made them
[58:42] more
[58:43] confident to see a preacher in Chains
[58:47] yet still happy about the gospel
[58:50] hallelujah
[58:52] hallelujah some preach Christ even of
[58:54] envy and strife that's the only reason
[58:55] that go to the pulpit was cuz they're
[58:57] envious of other people or they want to
[58:59] have Strife with other people blessed
[59:01] are the
[59:04] peacemakers for they shall see God
[59:08] Amen and some also of Good Will that's
[59:10] what I want to be I'm going to be a
[59:12] preacher of Good Will I want the best
[59:14] for every
[59:15] [Music]
[59:17] person now sometimes I got to attack
[59:19] some people by name know you know out in
[59:21] the interet internet
[59:24] land but I want to have Good Will
[59:26] towards all those who will repent amen
[59:29] and of course that's a warning for those
[59:30] people who got to call out it's a
[59:31] warning verse 16 the one preached Christ
[59:34] of
[59:35] contention not sincerely see there's a
[59:37] lot of insincere preachers supposing to
[59:40] add Affliction to my bond they were
[59:41] preaching against Paul see he's a prop
[59:43] he calls us a prophet but he's in jail
[59:45] he's chained up to a prisoner how could
[59:47] he be a real man of
[59:48] God but the other kind of love you love
[59:52] your brothers when they go through
[59:54] trials you try to feel Lord you try to
[59:57] feel something what are they going
[59:59] through have I ever gone through that
[1:00:01] right how can I criticize them how could
[1:00:04] I if I never gone through that how can I
[1:00:05] criticize
[1:00:09] them knowing that I am set for the
[1:00:11] defense of the Gospel so Jesus sent him
[1:00:14] in there to defend the gospel amongst
[1:00:16] the Roman Palace right to defend it to
[1:00:19] show that it's real amen it's a living
[1:00:22] it's a Living
[1:00:23] Word God is a living God hallelujah amen

[1:00:31] men in those days the the the
[1:00:33] philosophers brother William you know
[1:00:34] this most of the men those days had uh
[1:00:36] little boys that they would
[1:00:40] abuse that was that was common they
[1:00:43] would just take them around with them
[1:00:45] and abuse them it was sick and Paul says
[1:00:48] he comes there he saids husbands love
[1:00:50] your wives yeah and yet these men are
[1:00:53] used to have they can get rid of their
[1:00:54] any wife they want they and have
[1:00:56] anything they want and Paul said love
[1:00:58] your wives as Christ loved the church
[1:01:01] give yourself for her they were used to
[1:01:03] just using them how they I me use this
[1:01:05] for my pleasure use this selfishly and
[1:01:07] Paul that's what the Bible said he turns

[1:01:27] marriage the way Paul set it up so who
[1:01:30] is more powerful Nero or Paul oh Paul

[1:03:03] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:05] hallelujah amen we live completely
[1:03:09] different we live by the power of Christ
[1:03:12] am amen Verse 18 what then
[1:03:14] notwithstanding every way whether in
[1:03:16] pretense or truth Christ is preached
[1:03:18] there's my
[1:03:19] hour now this is quite an interesting
[1:03:21] statement I wrote this down in my
[1:03:23] Bible Christ has preached and there
[1:03:26] therein do I Rejoice yeah I Will
[1:03:28] Rejoice so Paul said whether preachers
[1:03:31] are insincere or sincere I just Rejoice
[1:03:34] that Christ is
[1:03:36] preach right but now what does Paul also
[1:03:38] say earlier 10 or 12 years earlier he
[1:03:41] said if a man Chang one thing about the
[1:03:43] gospel he's cursed isn't that something
[1:03:46] that that's what struck me brother
[1:03:48] yes I don't know about that one that's a
[1:03:50] good question in one place Paul says
[1:03:52] they're curse but here says but here he
[1:03:55] says well I Rejoice at least Christ is
[1:03:57] being preached yeah right and to me that
[1:04:00] means even if they're in a church with
[1:04:02] an insincere preacher insincere a
[1:04:05] contentious or envious preacher at least
[1:04:08] they had a chance to hear the name of
[1:04:10] Jesus Jesus Christ amen because where
[1:04:13] jesus' name is spoken Jesus could be
[1:04:15] there amen hallelujah he might come in
[1:04:18] there and rescue them
[1:04:20] hallelujah oh at least they get to hear
[1:04:22] the name of Jesus I love what verse 19
[1:04:25] says for I know that this shall turn to
[1:04:28] my salvation through your prayer amen I
[1:04:31] know God's going to deliver me church
[1:04:33] and it delivered whether by life or
[1:04:34] death I know I'm going to be delivered
[1:04:37] Amen to the next verse verse 20
[1:04:39] according to my Earnest expectation my
[1:04:41] hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed
[1:04:44] but that with all boldness as always so
[1:04:46] now also Christ shall be magnified in my
[1:04:50] body whether it be by life or by death
[1:04:53] amen amen see I'm going to be delivered
[1:04:56] you're going to pray for me he's telling
[1:04:57] the Philippians you're going to pray for
[1:04:58] me the Romans coloss everybody's praying
[1:05:00] for me and I know God's going to hear
[1:05:01] your prayer I'm either saved through
[1:05:03] death or I'm saved and I get to be a
[1:05:05] free man but either way I'm going to be
[1:05:08] saved oh what a mindset that
[1:05:12] is either way I love it either way I win
[1:05:16] yeah am because I'm fighting a battle
[1:05:18] that's already been one amen either way
[1:05:22] I win Paul says it later uh yeah vers 21
[1:05:26] for to me to live is Christ and to die
[1:05:29] it's gain either way I gain brother
[1:05:32] William that's what Paul was saying amen
[1:05:34] whether I live I win the people get more
[1:05:36] preaching I get to be with them more
[1:05:37] comfort more love or I get to die I get
[1:05:40] to go be with Jesus amen oh my either
[1:05:44] way I win hallelujah amen and think
[1:05:47] about that if we live with that
[1:05:49] mindset either way I win whether the
[1:05:51] good thing happens bad thing either way
[1:05:53] God's going to be glor God's going to be
[1:05:54] magnified in my body
[1:05:58] amen hallelujah
[1:06:01] amen thank you
[1:06:03] Lord I was looking up to the clock but
[1:06:05] there's no
[1:06:07] clock one historian said this he's
[1:06:10] talking about the difference between
[1:06:11] Paul and Nero remember Nero eventually
[1:06:13] said you're going to die by
[1:06:15] execution Nero had the life of the
[1:06:18] Prophet his hands in one way but really
[1:06:20] it was in God's hands amen like Jesus
[1:06:22] said you have no power over me unless it
[1:06:24] was given to you of the father
[1:06:26] right and he said this is your hour this
[1:06:29] is the hour of
[1:06:30] Darkness do what you do he said do
[1:06:32] quickly told that to Judas right but it
[1:06:33] was for the whole the whole group Paul
[1:06:36] realized anything that happens it's all
[1:06:39] according to the plan of God because I'm
[1:06:42] called by God I'm a servant of God amen
[1:06:44] amen Christ is going to be magnified in
[1:06:47] my body yes this historian said one
[1:06:50] day men will name their sons
[1:06:54] Paul and and name their dogs
[1:06:59] Nero is that beautiful I've never seen a
[1:07:02] dog named
[1:07:03] Paul I've seen some dogs named Jesse
[1:07:07] though some people at school had some
[1:07:10] dogs named Jesse that's a bad name for
[1:07:14] a but look even in those days they could
[1:07:17] see who is the real man with power
[1:07:19] Paul's walking up there he's got all
[1:07:20] those scars on his back when he gets his
[1:07:22] judgment sentence he's in Chains
[1:07:26] and he's under the anointing of the Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost Nero stands there with all his
[1:07:30] gold on and his all his uh just all of
[1:07:34] his decorations
[1:07:36] on and a historian could look at that
[1:07:38] and say which is the real man of God
[1:07:41] who's the real man there who will have a
[1:07:43] lasting impact on the world St Paul amen
[1:07:48] hallelujah and when Nero had him killed
[1:07:51] he was more alive than he'd ever been
[1:07:53] before
[1:07:55] I love that thought
[1:07:58] Hallelujah he thinks he killed him but
[1:08:00] actually he's more alive than he ever
[1:08:02] has been Hallelujah he left this Earthly
[1:08:05] house here but he went to his Heavenly
[1:08:07] house a house Eternal in the heavens
[1:08:11] Hallelujah an eternal house prise God
[1:08:15] where that body will never die am oh yes
[1:08:19] Lord I just was listening yesterday to
[1:08:21] brother Ram in the fist seal brother
[1:08:22] talks about going down the current of
[1:08:23] time and he said I used to be afraid of
[1:08:26] death he said because I think I'd see
[1:08:28] brother Neville and he'd just be a white
[1:08:30] cloud floating there and he says I
[1:08:32] couldn't talk or shake his hand so he
[1:08:34] said I just Float by and say hi brother
[1:08:36] Neville and brother I wasn't scared of
[1:08:40] that I was afraid he said not that I was
[1:08:43] afraid to be lost but I was afraid I
[1:08:45] couldn't he said I couldn't hug him like
[1:08:46] a brother I couldn't he said all I've
[1:08:48] known was being a
[1:08:51] man he said so I was afraid I wanted to
[1:08:54] be like a man but then when brother went
[1:08:56] beyond the C of time he had an out of
[1:08:59] Body Experience Hallelujah because Paul
[1:09:01] said whether I was in the body or out of
[1:09:03] the body only God knows Ezekiel had Out
[1:09:07] of Body Experience
[1:09:09] amen Ezekiel left his body remember he
[1:09:12] was praying with the uh there's a river
[1:09:14] chabar he left it God picked him up by
[1:09:17] his spiritual hair and carried him over
[1:09:19] to
[1:09:20] Jerusalem Amen brother Randon comes out
[1:09:22] of his body he sees himself laying by
[1:09:24] his wife cuz remember he was laying like
[1:09:26] this he said boy I'm 53 years old I sure
[1:09:29] hope God will let me do something for
[1:09:30] him
[1:09:31] someday I haven't done anything for the
[1:09:35] Lord you ever lay like that in bed said
[1:09:37] God I wish I would do something for you
[1:09:38] can I do something for you Lord he said
[1:09:41] he comes up he sees his body down there
[1:09:42] he bit his
[1:09:44] finger no I'm
[1:09:46] awake but notice that was a spiritual
[1:09:49] finger from a spiritual body that's
[1:09:51] right
[1:09:53] right and then when he got over there he
[1:09:55] said the women came to him first he
[1:09:57] hugged them my precious brother my
[1:09:59] precious brother he said but there was
[1:10:00] no sex
[1:10:03] glands and then he said after that all
[1:10:05] he said his wife come up he said surely
[1:10:07] she'll say oh my husband she just said
[1:10:09] oh my precious brother
[1:10:11] hope he said well that's
[1:10:16] strange and then the men come running he
[1:10:18] said they all had white robes on same
[1:10:21] robes he said but they all have
[1:10:22] different hair colors some are blonde
[1:10:24] some are black hair some are brown hair
[1:10:27] he said they all were barefooted out
[1:10:29] there no wonder we like going Barefoot
[1:10:30] around
[1:10:32] outside and they said my precious
[1:10:35] brother my precious
[1:10:37] brother and he said I could feel them he
[1:10:39] said just like now except it was more
[1:10:41] real remember brother said he said the
[1:10:44] things that are unseen are more real
[1:10:47] than the things that we do see
[1:10:49] Hallelujah so Heaven is more
[1:10:52] real than this right here
[1:10:55] is more real I can really feel that
[1:10:57] right Heaven's more real than that
[1:11:00] Hallelujah and the Bible said it's not
[1:11:02] far from us hallelujah amen oh my glory
[1:11:06] and there's multitudes waiting over
[1:11:08] there and they're resting on the fact
[1:11:10] that we're preaching Paul's
[1:11:12] gospel amen amen
[1:11:16] glory they're resting on that that's
[1:11:21] right brother said when I come back I
[1:11:23] wish I could just make people go there
[1:11:26] that they wouldn't miss
[1:11:28] it he said but I just got to keep
[1:11:30] preaching the gospel y amen hallelujah
[1:11:33] what a testimony church that God has
[1:11:35] given to us
[1:11:38] amen I want to share this one uh thing I
[1:11:40] learned from the scripture very simple
[1:11:42] how many remember when I looked at Rufus
[1:11:43] last week remember Rufus Rufus was
[1:11:46] mentioned by Paul in Romans
[1:11:48] 16:13 he said salute
[1:11:52] Rufus he said chosen in the Lord
[1:11:56] L and his mother and mine
[1:12:02] also you ever do a study on Rufus if you
[1:12:05] got your Bible go to Mark
[1:12:07] 15:21 Case you could read that for us no
[1:12:10] pressure Mark 15:21 take your
[1:12:13] time I was just looking at some of these
[1:12:18] names and church if this is a real
[1:12:21] connection here this is a powerful
[1:12:23] story why would Paul call out
[1:12:26] Rufus and his
[1:12:29] mother right they're in Rome why would
[1:12:32] he call them out
[1:12:34] UHA they compel on Simon a sirenian who
[1:12:38] passed by coming out of the country the
[1:12:40] father of Alexander and Rufus to bear
[1:12:42] his cross
[1:12:44] Rufus
[1:12:47] Alexander so on the day Jesus Christ was
[1:12:51] crucified the weight got so heavy he
[1:12:54] fell to the ground
[1:12:57] and he couldn't bear his cross
[1:12:59] anymore and the Roman soldiers said you
[1:13:02] come carry his cross I love that song by
[1:13:04] great great bolts God have mercy on that
[1:13:08] man and who do he call Simon the Siran
[1:13:11] sir sirene is 500 miles from Jerusalem
[1:13:15] it's right at the tip of Africa in the
[1:13:17] sahare desert so he's a black
[1:13:20] man remember all those there were 17
[1:13:23] Nations that would come in right like on
[1:13:24] the day of Pentecost
[1:13:25] sirene and Capia all these nations Rome
[1:13:28] Italy they'd all come in for these
[1:13:30] festivals and Simon the sirene was just
[1:13:32] there to worship
[1:13:34] Jehovah and his sons were with him
[1:13:36] Alexander and
[1:13:38] Rufus hallelujah praise
[1:13:41] God and Rufus is probably the same Rufus
[1:13:44] Paul greets there in Rome right so Rufus
[1:13:49] saw his dad come over and pick up the
[1:13:52] cross of Jesus
[1:13:55] and church now what do you think that
[1:13:56] did to him right and Jesus had they just
[1:14:00] have to beat Jesus along to walk but
[1:14:02] rufus's Dad is carrying the cross God
[1:14:06] help us amen amen to take up our cross
[1:14:09] and follow Christ hallelujah amen Rufus
[1:14:12] saw
[1:14:16] that Rufus saw his dad Carry the Cross
[1:14:19] all the way to the top and then no doubt
[1:14:21] they push him away get away and they
[1:14:23] laid Jesus down and they pound the nails
[1:14:25] that's why when I got the Holy Ghost
[1:14:26] that's why I saw the side view the pound
[1:14:28] the nails pound the
[1:14:30] nails and Rufus and Rufus little boy and
[1:14:33] Alexander his brother are there with his
[1:14:36] dad Simon the Siran watching and they
[1:14:38] lift him
[1:14:39] up and they see Jesus
[1:14:42] crucified I believe also Rufus probably
[1:14:44] saw him resurrected amen right cuz he
[1:14:48] would have been right there and he
[1:14:50] appeared under 500 at one time
[1:14:53] hallelujah praise God
[1:14:57] fast
[1:14:58] forward 30 years later Paul saying
[1:15:02] salute Rufus the chosen in the Lord he
[1:15:05] was
[1:15:06] chosen to see his dad Carry the Cross of
[1:15:09] the
[1:15:10] Messiah he was chosen to watch Christ
[1:15:13] crucified and then see him resurrected
[1:15:16] hallelujah amen and then Rufus would to
[1:15:18] saw that same Christ Living in St Paul
[1:15:21] hallelujah praise God the same Jesus I
[1:15:25] saw crucified Rufus would say I see him
[1:15:28] working through Paul why he's got the
[1:15:30] same message the same word the same Holy
[1:15:32] Ghost the same power amen no wonder Paul
[1:15:35] said greet him and his
[1:15:40] mother who's been a mother to me how
[1:15:43] could rufus's mom serve Paul because she
[1:15:45] knew Paul was preaching the same gospel
[1:15:47] that Jesus gave him oh praise God the
[1:15:50] same Jesus they saw crucified and
[1:15:54] Resurrected
[1:15:56] amen is that powerful praise God amen
[1:15:58] amen so can you imagine in the two years
[1:16:01] where Paul's receiving people they get
[1:16:02] to knock on the
[1:16:03] door yes come in it's Rufus and his
[1:16:08] mother
[1:16:10] God
[1:16:12] chosen Rufus my brother chosen in the
[1:16:15] Lord not just for salvation but to see
[1:16:19] salvation to see the cross to see the
[1:16:22] the nails go in to see him cry my God my
[1:16:25] God why has Thou forsaken me to see the
[1:16:28] the the sun go
[1:16:29] out to see the lightning and the
[1:16:32] earthquake to see all that no wonder
[1:16:34] Paul could say that's a chosen man in
[1:16:36] the Lord oh Church may God help us to
[1:16:38] see spiritually with our spiritual eyes
[1:16:40] to see the death barrial and
[1:16:42] resurrection of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:16:44] amen but this man had seen it Rufus had
[1:16:47] seen it with his own
[1:16:50] eyes I imagine Church what I imagine
[1:16:57] Rufus would to come there and said I
[1:16:59] encourage you my brother Paul stay true
[1:17:01] stay faithful to the word of God your
[1:17:03] arrest has been such a blessing to us
[1:17:06] because we've had two years all of us
[1:17:07] that want to see a sister Phoebe come in
[1:17:09] there they all come in there they get a
[1:17:11] time with the prophet of
[1:17:14] God imagine Rufus come in there and said
[1:17:17] Paul no matter what happens be ready to
[1:17:21] give your life like our savior did amen
[1:17:25] because I saw it with my own
[1:17:27] eyes I saw Jesus he would get slapped
[1:17:31] but he would not slap
[1:17:32] back I saw him get kicked and beaten but
[1:17:36] he did not hit back in other words Rufus
[1:17:38] could say Paul be ready to give your
[1:17:41] body as an offering unto God because
[1:17:45] Jesus was the Lamb of God the offering
[1:17:47] of God slain from the foundation world
[1:17:49] but had to be crucified for our sins
[1:17:52] Hallelujah
[1:17:55] imagine Rufus said I've seen it I've
[1:17:56] seen what it looks like you just take it
[1:17:59] take the abuse take it and be an
[1:18:03] offering for the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:06] because he became an offering for you oh
[1:18:08] yes Lord I've seen it with my own
[1:18:11] eyes I was chosen Glory I was chosen to
[1:18:14] see it with my own
[1:18:17] eyes
[1:18:19] imagine that word from Rufus is probably
[1:18:21] what Paul echoed when he said for I am
[1:18:24] now ready to be
[1:18:26] offered and the time of my
[1:18:30] departure is at hand yes Lord Jes these
[1:18:33] are his last words he wrote before he
[1:18:36] died I have fought a good
[1:18:39] fight I finish my
[1:18:41] course I have kept the faith Hallelujah
[1:18:46] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:18:49] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[1:18:52] the righteous judge shall give me at
[1:18:55] that day and not to me only but unto all
[1:19:00] that also love his appearing how many
[1:19:03] love Jesus is coming back
[1:19:06] Hallelujah let's stand to our
[1:19:21] feet God gives us the right friend
[1:19:24] friends at the right
[1:19:26] time God sends us the people that we
[1:19:29] need to talk to the people that need to
[1:19:32] impact us God sends it at the right time
[1:19:34] God sends sermons at just the time we
[1:19:36] need them how many believe that God
[1:19:39] sends Our Guest preachers God will have
[1:19:40] me preach things trying to follow
[1:19:42] leadership of the Holy Spirit he sends
[1:19:44] it right at the right time and we need

[1:19:50] grace
[1:19:53] Jesus as we our heads how many say Lord
