with him not this saturday but next saturday so um but you know sunday's stream was perfect it was just sounding good everything good i mean the whole service was on there so full preaching rather but uh thank you everybody and thanks for your patience okay judges chapter seven would like to look at part four of gideon's victory over fear praise god part four we'll just read verses six and seven and try to be mindful the time i know brother austin still got to get up at 4 30 a.m and i haven't told the church i'm just so proud of you brother austin for getting up so early for work brother great yes sir very very proud of you so god bless each and every one all you that go to work god bless you appreciate you know especially having a long day of work coming to the house of god we appreciate that god bless each and every one of you judges seven verses six and seven that's where we ended off last wednesday night uh last wednesday i think it was that was a three-minute live stream i think last wednesday night if i'm not mistaken so not everybody got a chance to hear this one verse six i'll read verse six and then we'll all do seven and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were 300 men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water let's read verse 7 1 2 3 and the lord said unto gideon by the 300 men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place let's just have one more word of prayer if we can if you have a need on your heart let's just make it on unto god father god we just come again lord thanking you thank you that the battle belongs to you lord and that song i thought it was very fitting i didn't plan that but that was a very fitting to this sermon here tonight because this battle belonged to you lord god and we thank you god that you fight our battles god and you give us inspiration when we have to put our little efforts into it you give us all that in inspiration and strength but lord so many times you fight the battles for us where we don't have to do really anything dear god we just have to praise you we just have to worship you and obey you and not mess it up dear god and just humble ourselves so we humble ourselves here tonight lord god we ask god did you speak through me and hear through the people hear through me as well i need your grace and strength i need your revelation each one of us do bless the live streamers over so happy to have them on here lord i just pray the livestream would be fixed somehow lord send our friend dan to help us out lord and whatever we need to learn help us to learn it dear god that people can hear your word and we'll give you all the thanks and praise thank you for all the sacrifices that have been made all the long days of work today and the saints still come in the house of god bless them abundantly in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so we'll try to you know i'll try to do 40 minutes here if i can by god's grace we'll see how that works out and continue on this thought looking at the life of gideon so we're picking up where we left off last wednesday uh night by god's grace and we see the 300 lappers or the 300 but uh okay all right thank you thank you i appreciate that all right you would think after all these years i could figure this out that better okay thank you hard to teach an old eagle new tricks you know it's hard to 300 lappers or we'd say dogs were accepted by god last week we saw how the army got uh decreased from 32 000 down to 10 000. so 22 000 left because of fear that's what we see today many people are fearful won't come to church or won't serve god because of coveter because of other situations you know but fear paralyzes the majority of people that say they want to serve god fear paralyzes them what will my family say what will this person say so we know the majority of people will fall away due to fear and didn't jesus say that too he said men's hearts will be failing them right for fear so it's a very prophetic this portion of scripture is very prophetic for the end time and remember that was about uh about 70 of the church left after that first uh shaving down we'd say and now then last week we got to 10 000 and god said the number's still too big the church is still too big because there's too many people that were going to be prideful if they were a part of god's victory so god had to take down 9 700 more he had to send nine thousand seven hundred more people home okay so now it's gone down from thirty two thousand to ten thousand to three hundred three hundred is not even one percent of thirty two thousand so it's actually point nine percent of one percent it's not even one percent of 32 000. so when god looks it's interesting when god looks out of people we think well big numbers big faith not not always in fact very very few times is that ever the case right think about the two million that came out of israel right only two from the original group uh that were 20 years and older went in right anyone that was 19 and under still went in with joshua and caleb right but anyone that was 20 and older 20 was the age of accountability in the old testament at least for going in the promised land right so god shaves down 99 99.1 percent of the church just down to uh the very real depth of people who are not fearful and not prideful my prayer is god take all that away from me take my fear away take my pride away lord just leave take take that away and just leave me with faith in your word praise god amen and i say like this even for our church and every message church should want the same thing right which church doesn't want to have people that are humble and that are not afraid that are strong and courageous in the lord praise god not afraid of rumors of nuclear war not afraid of another coven wave coming this fall you know they're not afraid of all these things but they're trusting in the living god if god brought me through yesterday he'll bring me through tomorrow praise god because god is faithful and even if god lets me go to the grave praise god i mean every all the saints down through the ages except the couple have gone through the grave praise god some have gone in more noble ways than others we'd say more noble but each one if they were faithful to god's word then no doubt they received an overcomer's crown praise god hallelujah because they overcame satan they overcame the wicked one on this side hallelujah and the one thing they'll take with them is their character hallelujah so just keep that main thing keep the character of christ in your life amen because that's what you'll take over you'll leave your clothes you'll leave your jewelry everything else will stay here but you will take one thing that's your christ-like character hallelujah that's the one thing that will go over so out of 32 000 how many were humble and how many were really trusting in god 300. 300 out of 32 000. at church we can say the same right you can you can go on youtube and you can see all the mega churches think about how many thousands are out there how many are really uh not afraid of the end times how many really have how many are really humble and they just want the just give me the word of god i don't want any showmanship i don't want any hollywood i don't want any jokes i don't want all of that i just want god's word amen i just want faith in god's word how many would that be i imagine it'd be less than one percent hallelujah because remember brother and uses this scripture for the rapture he uses this story for the rapture now hopefully i'll get a little bit more into that but remember 300 is a pretty good number in scripture right 300 men get the victory here how long was the ark it was 300 cubits so salvation came in that generation through 300 cubits hallelujah it was 300 long mary the sister of lazarus anointed the feet of jesus with the perfume how much did it cost 300 denarii 300. so we look at this number 300 here how many foxes did samson catch 300. 300 and he loosed them upon the harvest of the philistines so we see this number of 300 a number of victory massive victory right a big victory uh through the number of 300. hallelujah so 300 believers were strong in the lord and also were able to overcome pride because pride was that last one fear was the first one that cut everybody off the second one was pride so 300 were strong in the lord and humble a very very small group praise god remember we saw last week the ones that bowed down they were the self-indulgent ones they didn't keep their eye on the enemy right self-indulgence so pride is indulging in yourself and worshiping yourself right loving yourself and god had to cut send all those people home anyone that's going to self-indulge i got to send them home i want the people that are alert that are ready for battle amen that's the kind god wanted so god sends 9 700 home he didn't even want them hanging around he didn't want these prideful people around you so seizures sometimes god's got to cut off people out of your life so you can you can be the right kind of christian you should be he wouldn't even let him hang around he said go home you're not ready for battle go home amen so if god lets people come out of our lives praise god god knows what he's doing amen god knows how to cut off the right people and also send in the right people at the right time amen hallelujah god knows what he's doing he's building an army that's what he's doing hallelujah and gideon was a real man of faith like his 299 brothers god's always in the minority i love what jonathan said in first samuel 14 6. he said there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or a few in other words jonathan knew it doesn't matter if there's two people or 2 thousand if god's with us nothing can stop us amen if god has sent me here it doesn't matter how many people are with me if god has a job for me to do i'm gonna in other words if god gave me an unconditional promise it's gonna come to pass amen as we saw on sunday some are conditional some are unconditional but in other words this was unconditional how did that just struck me right now yes hallelujah is unconditional because gideon keep adding question after question after question you would think seeing an angel would be enough to convince you that god's going to use me but it just wasn't one time we're going to see it tonight it's 11 times god talks to him last week i showed you it was already nine times he needs two more in this chapter you would think if wouldn't you just think if i just saw an angel come and told me sister who it's all gonna be all right god's with you i mean you would think that would be enough right i mean you would think right but god knows we're all human and god knows we're all fearful and god knows we're living in these pest houses amen hallelujah so god is gracious to come again and again and reaffirm his word and strengthen you and build you up in other words god is building up god's giving you everything you need in other words god will not let his unconditional promise fail hallelujah he's going to be with you praise god and jonathan said i don't care how many people few or many god will get the victory praise god if he's if he's doing something if if god is orchestrating a move that that he has ordained nothing can stop it nothing can stop it amen and god's going to make sure he gets your attitude my attitude our ideas all lined up with his word so we can all greet his word and say amen to the word of god hallelujah he's going to he's going to do it that's what i want to show on sunday lord willing i'm going to show how we preach on pride on sunday but this sunday i want to go a little bit further with pride and show how in in when god brought israel out of the wilderness god said i brought you out to test you to humble you so i want to look at that for a while and church then you see some of them accepted the humility in other words god ordained all these trials to make them more humble and learn i've got to rely on god for everything in my life some people learned that and some people didn't the ones that learned it kept going on by god's grace those that didn't those that couldn't humble themselves and just learn to trust in god in every situation they spoke against god they spoke against god's prophet and god let them die in the wilderness so i want to deal with that thought lord willing on sunday because that's a beautiful thought in other words our whole life is about learning how to how to humble ourselves and learn how to obey the promises of god and trust god that god is doing something in our life he's building a testimony in our life praise god he's bringing us to some testimony he wants us and he wants the whole world to see it praise god amen right because he's going to use your testimony on the day of judgment amen he's gonna use it for his glory and so your whole life is built upon humbling you right god orchestrates all these events of our life why does this seem so hard why does that trouble keep happening why do i keep battling this why all this is to humble us so we'll learn to trust in god's power not our own praise god amen now in verse eight so the people took victials those are meals or like food little meals in their hand now notice how much food did they take a handful in other words they didn't take a lot of food meaning god was telling them this isn't going to be a long fight praise god he didn't give him a whole week's worth of food here right take a handful take a mixture in your hand so what can you fit in your hand a sandwich now those days they probably have sandwiches right maybe they had like a apple fish so they got one meal and they're gonna and this little army of 300 is going it's going to go defeat 120 000. that's half of accurate because then we look up akron what was the akron population we looked that up wow so yeah take one meal and you guys are gonna go defeat akron you're gonna defeat the whole army in akron just on one meal on the power of that one meal because it wasn't gonna be their power it's gonna be god's power other words god was showing them take one victual in your hand you just need one meal this ain't gonna last very long if you just obey the word of god and notice they also took trumpets trumpets were sat were uh were instruments to declare war right does the bible say the trumpet gives an uncertain sound remember brother brandon preached that uncertain sound so in other words and the bible said every voice is as a trumpet every voice makes a sound of some signification the bible says so see now we can start seeing god's gonna when god's gonna use us when we fight battles for god god's gonna give us a meal praise god he's gonna give us a trump he's gonna give us a voice see we're kind of showing the types and shadows here and he sent all the rest of israel every man into his tent and remained those 300 men and the host of meaning was beneath him in the valley now church what's interesting this struck me as i was studying today this was going to be not just a trumpet this was going to be the last trumpet anybody catch yet the last trump at the rapture this was going to be the last trumpet for 40 years because judges 8 verse 28 says thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness 40 years in the days of gideon and the church said amen and notice when does this take place after the seventh year seven represents church ages hallelujah enoch was the seventh from adam enoch took a rapture hallelujah so now we see they're gonna blow the trumpet for the last time for 40 years so we're coming up on the last trump hallelujah amen gideon is used to blow the last trump hallelujah amen that's what brother said god is trimming down his church like gideon he said if you do if you obey the little things you'll catch the big things amen amen if you can obey the messiah like this if you can receive and accept the former rain you'll catch the ladder rain amen hallelujah glory so this was the last trump for 40 years and also there wasn't gonna be an eighth year it was ending after the seventh year amen hallelujah there wasn't going to be an eighth and eighth church age it was ending after the seventh hallelujah remember mount transfiguration on the amount of transfiguration the bible said after six days jesus took peter james and john to high mountain and showed them the coming of the lord amen hallelujah amen see that's right amen glory that's how i that's what i do i walk in the i got to leave out i walk right in outside amen right away right i walk in because i know it's good praise god but remember what did jesus what they what what did they see they saw jesus moses and elijah brother said moses represented the dead saints who were resurrected elijah represent the saints that didn't have to die those are the living saints that are changed in the moment and the twinkling of an eye praise god in other words they foresaw the rapture they that's what we're seeing here today they're gideon is representing the rapture praise god this is the last trump for 40 years praise god amen and notice the host was beneath them see believers are always on higher ground church remember satan is always under your feet always even if you're living in sin still he's still under your feet all you got to do is say jesus forgive me and then that spirit will leave and you're already the overcomer already praise god amen they're looking down the bible said they're looking down upon their enemy see we're sitting up in heavenly places praise god we're at the place of advantage amen we might be small number but god is on our side and we're in a place where an elevated place we're sitting in heavenly places we see where the enemy's at and god is going to direct us to the victory praise god amen hallelujah thank the lord for that they were beneath them and that's what the bible says in romans this is one of my favorite scriptures romans 16 20 and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly in other words paul is saying keep hanging on satan's gonna be put under your feet praise god just hang on because the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen what does it god's grace verse 9. he said the same night and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down into the host for i've delivered it into thine hand hallelujah so the same night or the same day that he sent away 9 700 soldiers prideful soldiers at that imagine they felt pretty good all that spirit of pride is not hanging around nobody's bragging about their muscles anymore thank god amen i bet they felt really good now right it was just calm and humble and sweet christians and all these men that were prideful i could you hear me out here did you hear what i did at the olympics down there at the the jerusalem olympics you hear what i did down there and my i really i really showed off down there all the pride was gone amen they just had humble simple warriors for god that's all they had they didn't have fearful and they didn't have they didn't have uh prideful either the same night a church gideon is now beginning to know the voice of the lord better and god is coming to increase his faith while decreasing his army as his army gets smaller his faith gets greater at church that's how we should be if the circumstances get worse our faith should get greater but you know what we're gonna we're gonna have to be like getting we have to say god help me out lord i need i need some signs here lord hallelujah i need you lord could you do something here i really need to answer my prayer i got an unspoken need you know i need god lord i need you to really come on the scene and encourage me so it's the same night and god comes to him and speaks to him that was in verse 9. arise so that means he was sitting right he's got his church all separate he's got a small little flock he's sitting down god said rise up now's the time to rise at the night time doesn't that sound familiar are the wise virgins they're all sleeping and the cry goes out the bridegroom comes go you have to meet him amen and they all rose hallelujah very same thing now look at verse 10. here's where i love god's great mercy now remember verse 9 he says rise up i've already delivered it in your hand. verse 10 but if you're still afraid gideon to go down he says take pharah your servant down to the host isn't that something god said rise up you're going to go defeat him he said but if you're still a little afraid i'm going to give you the last portion of faith glory there it is let me give you that final anointing of faith amen i think that you need to overcome this insurmountable enemy this seemingly invincible enemy if you have any last fears church if we have any last fears about the rapture the squeeze guess what god's going to take it out of us amen if we're the bride he's got to take it out because this is his victory it won't be us glorying in what we've done it'll be god being gracious to us and taking out our fear and accomplishing his purpose amen god will not share his glory with any man hallelujah he won't share it with adam he won't share it with moses he definitely want to share with moses he wouldn't let moses go in the promised land he won't share with joshua he won't share it with peter he won't share it with brother branham you or i he won't share with nobody this is going to be god's work this is going to be god's testimony amen hallelujah us we're learning how to do is get the fear out and get the pride out and be humble and obey the word of the lord amen that's all we got to do praise god not be afraid and be humble and god can do a great work at this last trump hallelujah thank god oh glory now church what does this do this this verse verse 10 well let's read verse 11 and thou shalt hear what they say so god tells me if you've got any any last fear left you're going to go down to the host hear what they say afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down into the host so in other words god's saying here you're going to get your last sign that you need and this last sign will strengthen you and when you hear this sign then you're going to be ready for battle in other words this is the last portion of faith that you need to receive and then you'll be ready to defeat the enemy i build up your face slowly i started with an angel praise god then a sacrifice and a disappearing angel then i met you and sent you to your father's house you got victory at your house amen hallelujah then i met you with the wool first it was wet and then the ground was wet i met you there and now i met you here i've given you i've trimmed down your army i met you every step of the way there's one more thing you need if you're going to be victorious and so i'm going to give it to you amen god wasn't going to keep it from him god was going to give it to him amen everything we have need of god is going to give to us if god is calling us he'll equip us amen hallelujah he's going to be faithful he's going to be merciful he will accomplish his victory in our lives this magnifies god's faithfulness not gideon's faithfulness because god is going to get all the glory gideon doesn't come out of this saying look at all the faith i've got bless god i had great faith i probably say that he would say i believe but god helped my unbelief does that sound familiar like jesus hallelujah that's what jerry says said i believe lord help my unbelief right because we've all got unbelief or maybe something like uh where where with man it's impossible but with god all things will be possible he wasn't going to come out of there with his chest all out and look what i did and i'm the bride and look how great i am look at god's sake saying hey i brought you this far if you got any more fear i've got the last bit of word that you need to get over that fear and now look gideon doesn't stand there and say no i don't need that i've already got enough faith right he didn't turn it down like oh god i don't need that were you joking with me again oh my you're so funny you got a sense of humor don't you lord you know he's like no actually i need that last bit of faith i've still got fear i just like saint paul amen he had fears within and fears without praise god in other words you're gideon i'm gideon we all need god's grace to bring us to perfection to bring us to a place where we can get a victory praise god because without him driving it out we're gonna have we can have any victory see it's god putting the situations of our life together to mold our character to expose our weaknesses so that he gets the glory so that we learn to depend on him in our tough situations so grace gets magnified mercy gets magnified his faithfulness that god gets magnified because this is the battle god's not i'm not i'm not i'm not sharing with gideon i'm not sharing my glory with anybody on this hallelujah and as you'll see gideon don't even take a sword to this battle the first part of the battle he takes the sword to the second part but he'll take a sword to the first part hallelujah so go down there you're going to hear something you're going to hear something that builds your faith doesn't that sound familiar faith cometh by hearing hallelujah you need to hear something right so he goes down there with the armor bearer just like god gave moses his brother aaron to go with him right see god god is mouthful i'm sorry god is mindful in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word should be established hallelujah and god knew gideon's hands would be strengthened after he heard the interpretation of this praise god god knew this is the last thing he needed to go down or you need to go down there to get strengthened to defeat a numberless army perhaps 120 000 and god knew the last thing he needed was to hear that the enemy feared him oh hallelujah amen sometimes church we just need a reminder that satan and the devils tremble at the name of jesus praise god when you confess your sins and you get your mind transformed devils tremble at your prayers amen hallelujah that's the last thing gideon need to hear that the enemy's more afraid of me than i am of them amen hallelujah praise god amen isn't that right didn't that devil say well paul i know jesus i know but who are you didn't the devils know paul and didn't paul say sometimes i do things that i hate but i don't want to do them what does that mean he fell short but then he recovered right away he repented and got right with god don't you know it's the same thing with you god's not expecting you to do a perfect job of never sinning but god is expecting you to get cleaned out when you get dirty and come back to the battle praise god and then devils know you right devils know you when they bring a temptation but you're able to overcome it and cast it down the devils know this person is a real saint hallelujah you know you don't have to cast out devils like in a prayer service or something like that you just got to resist the devil and they flee praise god and that what the bible says see when you resist them then you don't have to cast them out because you don't let them inside the house amen you're just resisting them and then they have to flee and no doubt they tell other devils about it no doubt because they're studying you right year after year month after month trying to know your attributes but we must keep learning to resist them praise god yes satan may come in a different way from time to time we still got to resist him praise god we still got to rebuke him we still got to overcome how many will do it by god's grace amen glory so now we've come to the 10th and 11th time god has finally worked on this guy doesn't that sound 11 something for me or like 11th hour workers anything like does that sound familiar rapture anything last workers hallelujah so we see a 7 and 11 praise god all these godly numbers amen hallelujah 300 victory the angel gave him six words of the lord then he got a word from the lord you'll not fear then he got two signs answered and here in chapter seven verses nine and fifteen he gets god speaking again saying you're going to deliver them into your hands and the 11th time is when he hears his dream interpreted look at verse 12. well i'm sure i'm sorry we never finished 11. then so the second part of 11. then he went down with furrow and his servant unto the outside of the the armed men that were in the host and the midianites and the amylokites and all the children of east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers from multitude and their camels were without number as a sand by the sea for multitude praise god verse 13 and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dreamer to his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and low a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of many and it and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along this is quite quite a odd story verse 14 and his fellow answer said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the hosts gideon hears the enemy talking about how afraid they are of him his little army of 300. now i don't know if they knew it was 300 or not but gideon gets word that they're afraid of him praise god just like the spies when they went over to joshua they talked to rahab right rahab said we know this this this army is mighty the devils know your prayers are powerful amen hallelujah we just saw it praise god with you with uh lena's mom amen we just saw how powerful prayers are amen get out satan we yell remember remember you yelled that brother we shouted jesus amen devils tremble at the name of jesus hallelujah thank god oh it's beautiful this is the la god knew this is the last thing gideon needs a barley of or cake barley wrote not a picture that a barley a circular piece of bread rolling down a hill hits a tent and knocks the tent over and the guy says this is nothing but gideon gideon's a piece and and barley bread was just the common that was the first harvest at the feet the first of the feast of first fruits barley was the first bread that or the first seed that they harvest just was common bread wheat came later so this was common bread it was usually the food for the poor and the beasts and so this this was not the best bread this was just common everyday bread and so now the enemies are afraid of this common just humble man named gideon the least in his father's house nobody special but somehow god has put the fear of getting into their hearts and they're afraid of this common everyday guy you know just he is and he's picking up momentum he's going downhill even though his church is getting smaller he's getting stronger amen although the odds seem stacked against him actually momentum is on his side amen hallelujah thank god because he's obeying the word of god amen and he didn't come down here to play with the tent he come down and knock down the tent amen hallelujah it's an unstoppable cake of bread it's a violent strong uh end over end cake of bread that's gonna it's a common despised loaf of bread that's gonna destroy the midianites remember the bible says god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise he's chosen the weak things of the world and first corinthians 1 27 to confound the things which are mighty so now these mighty warriors with the the shiniest armor and the sharpest swords the longest swords now they're shaking in their their their their armor over a piece of bread a common piece of table bread or or the bread you toss to animals god was confounding the wise how the new god was hiding in simplicity amen hallelujah and the fear of god comes into them in this mighty army all because well guess what the people cried out they heard the god said i'm a prophet there it is they heard the prophet that's another way it's like the rapture they cried they were in bondage for seven church ages right they went we wanted to be free from strife midi knights of strife division but they couldn't get victory so god sent them a prophet the prophet left the seed and the weakest ones the weakest christians are the ones that are least esteemed the least esteemed churches amen hallelujah the least esteemed message believers are the ones that god comes to amen the ones that are not prideful the ones that are humble the ones that will not fear god comes to them and he raises up a small but mighty army and god brings all their fear out and god likens them unto a calm and despised group of people but that's the people god chose for the battle amen seems like i'm in that type somehow seems like you're in that time somehow you know there's some common everyday message believers that people never thought to not amount to anything it seems like god's going to use them for a great quick short quick work before the rapture amen uh to shake up the devil's armies amen and get a victory and overcome and conquer death hallelujah i hope i live to see it praise god if not somebody's gonna live to see it right so let's live like we're gonna see it amen i didn't know you let's say holy god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound those that are mighty remember church we're like into bread remember that it was our text for the uh the communion when we had it over uh or resurrection weekend first corinthians 10 17 for we being many are one bread and one body for all partakers that one bread we are a bread so gideon's army was a piece of bread coming down and bread destroys a tent common bread destroys the enemy didn't jesus say i'm that bread hallelujah isn't jesus the word amen hallelujah it's a bread it's a body how many know there's life and bread he said i'm the bread of what death i'm the bread of life life will always get the victory hallelujah verse 14. and this fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of josh a man of israel for in his hand hath god delivered many and all the hosts praise god verse 15. oh before i move on this is also yeah i looked at my nose in esther 6 13 haman's own wife recognized her husband was going to fall the enemy knew they were going to fall the devil knows his days are limited that's why he's uh battling as hard as he can but abraham said satan is like a wounded animal and whenever you see a wounded animal you know you don't go up to them because they're going to just lash out they know they're wounded they can't right and so satan is lashing out today at the generation that the culture right he's lashing out this is the last attempt remember brother brahm said he said the homosexual was so bad in his day he didn't see how there could be another generation well look how it's advanced now like i was telling that to brother maybe austin or some other one but we're saying remember in sodom they had gangs of men that were violent and doing very wicked things in gay and nobody stopped it and jesus said as it was in the days of lot so must it be in the days of sodom i'm sorry the days of the coming of son of man so see it's it's it's it's been corrupted beyond even what brother random imagined see so thank god thank god he's protected us church thank god but the world will do what the world wants to do god has to give them over because that's what they want to do verse 15 and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped glory and returned in the house of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian so as soon as getting hers wow there was a dream and the dream was interpreted a dream interpreted becomes a prophecy vision so what did he need he needed another vision he needed another prophecy he needed one more supernatural dream from god amen where he heard the enemy testifying about what god was going to do amen how do you know you praise god thank you jesus and gideon stopped and he worshiped right there see when god blesses you you're not ashamed to stop and praise the lord hallelujah when you see god's hand minister i was praying as i i prayed i remember i said oh lord you just you blessed me so much i just was crying and thanking the lord right before i come up just to sing the songs here i just oh yeah that's right i forgot to thank the lord thank you jesus you are jehovah jireh amen before i needed it you already gave it hallelujah how great you are so they're not afraid to worship immediately when they hear the word of god or when they see god's word come to pass they're not afraid to worship he returns to the camera and say let's rise up i've got my 11th sign i've got the last thing i need in other words i've got the latter rain i've got the last thing i need all my fear is gone glory every prayer i've prayed god has answered oh church can you imagine if we ever got to a spot like that and this persecution comes on the screen comes on can imagine we will pray for things and god you know we'll say in a matter of a few weeks all these prayers are coming to past church we start seeing dead dead ones raised from the dead and i mean every fear would be gone no matter how insurmountable the enemy looked we would know god answered our prayer he gave me everything i asked he's kept his word every dream has come to pass amen i believe and nothing can stop us amen if god did that in the natural old testament under blood bubbles and goats what about now amen where he's going to do something even greater praise god going to defeat death in the moment and the twinkling of an eye hallelujah i believe this there's gonna be more than 300 go in the rapture i hope so by god's grace how many we got here tonight one two three five six seven eight ten twelve about 15 here tonight so yeah we're just a small little group praise god we're going i already believe they're going by god's grace he didn't call me for this for me to fail praise god like getting he didn't call me to fail i was the least esteemed right where we see ourselves we're the least esteemed we're the rejected ones but that just qualifies us to be used by god as he takes away all of our fear amen hallelujah the church remember this was the one two three four this was the fourth time gideon was afraid there's my 40 minutes so i'll give myself five more here that was the fourth time gideon the minute he was afraid and god knew it god said but if you're afraid i'll give you one more dream interpreted i'll give you one more prophecy and it's exactly what you'll need to hear i need to know that even the enemy knows they're going to lose even the enemy is afraid of me because god's with me not because i'm anything but because god's with me hallelujah beautiful verse 16. verse 16. and he divided the 300 men into three companies so 100 in each company and he put a trumpet in every man's hand and enemy pitchers and lamps within the pictures i want you to notice here he divides them up in order to surround the host now remember this is a host in the valley that was huge the bible the bible says like grasshoppers right this is so many but god's going to have 100 over here 100 over there there's a triangle that must represent god somehow hallelujah and every man needed these in his hand he needed an empty pitcher a lamp lit with fire and a trumpet now notice 300 men going out to battle 120 000 soldiers 300 you know what that reminds me of abraham one time took 318 trained servants by the power of god and he went out and whipped five kings he come back and he met melchizedek and melchizedek said oh blessed be you of elohim amen hallelujah that's what abraham said i know god gave me the victory here's a here's my tithe amen the only reason i got this victory which was because you gave it to me melchizedek amen so i'm coming to bring you the tithe so gideon could have went against out in this battle knowing i've got less than abraham but the same god that defeated five kings with abraham can defeat a hundred twenty thousand with my group as well because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and for how do you believe he can still do it hallelujah god does whatever he wants amen what it takes is the same faith the same humility to say lord i still need more signs lord i'm still a little afraid i believe but help my unbelief right lord if you're going to do this lord please help me out i need your strength i can't bring this to pass on my own i'm learning i'm understanding i can't do this on my own i need your help and god's voice will somehow come back and say okay this situation is going to happen i'm going to allow this to happen so your faith rises in my promises amen notice again it's attacked by night god looked at him the angel looked at him said get in you mighty man of valor go cut him down at night time when nobody's around you mighty man of valor here he says now you're going to get a victory over 120 000 go at nighttime you mighty woman of valor night time night time the victory at night time evening time glory amen evening time hallelujah they actually went on at midnight bible said the middle watch so just take your trumpet your empty picture or picture and your lamp just take those three did you see sword in there no and yet pretty soon i'll preach it next wednesday they shouted the sword of the lord and of gideon and they don't even have any swords on him at that moment because a natural sword is not what god wanted them to have it wasn't the sword of man it was the sword of god hallelujah let's stand to our feet by god's grace musicians can come i better stop right there that's 45 minutes hallelujah how many want god to take out all fear and all pride how many realize we have a great battle ahead of us we have a tremendous enemy that we face now some of us have certain battles certain things we're praying for in our lives right now that's those are major obstacles those are major enemies but we all have this enemy of fear we all this enemy have this enemy of fear of what's going to happen in the next few years will free will free speech be taken away will the will we need permission to preach as brother branham said there's going to become a boycott against the churches are we ready for that enemy hallelujah he said if you when you go out you humble group you humble church you real small church he said just take your trumpet which is your voice just take your take an empty vessel glory what's an empty vessel it's a surrendered will you're not full of anything you're just empty lord just have your way it's not my will it's thy will be done and just take a lamp and a lap a lamp represents light fire it's the holy ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive and the church said amen take your voice take some humility and take the fire of god take a revive on your heart don't take a natural sword don't take your ar-15 right don't take the atom bomb how in the world is this going to happen not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord the bat how many know the battle belongs to god let's bow
