[38:10] Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 I was been

[38:15] brother Rams messages on Revelation
[38:18] chapter 4 and 5 and so I'd like to begin
[38:21] preaching on them by the grace of the
[38:24] Lord so let's go to Revelation chapter 4
[38:27] we'll just read verses 1 and 2 I imagine
[38:29] that's I'm just gonna preach basically
[38:32] what he preached back in 1960 it was
[38:35] December 31st when he preached this
[38:37] message and I'll just inject some more
[38:39] of his thoughts from this chapter how
[38:41] many love the book of revelation it
[38:44] gives you victory over Satan right it
[38:47] gives us revelation over the wicked one
[38:49] so we're very very grateful for that by
[38:52] the grace of the Lord unmasks him
[38:54] unveils him and shows what the true
[38:56] church will do and overcome Satan and
[38:59] every one of his tricks so we're so
[39:01] grateful for that by God's grace in
[39:03] Revelation chapter 4 verses 1 and 2
[39:07] actually you know what let's go to verse
[39:09] yeah
[39:10] verses 1 & 2 yeah I'll read verse 1 and
[39:13] that's all read verse 2 verse 1 after
[39:15] this I looked and behold a door was open
[39:17] in heaven and the first voice which I
[39:19] heard was as it were of a trumpet
[39:21] talking with me which said come up
[39:24] hither and I will show thee things which
[39:26] must be Hereafter
[39:27] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[39:30] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[39:33] I'm sorry sat on the throne forgive me
[39:35] I'm in such a hurry let's go back and
[39:36] read that together forgive me let's read
[39:39] verse 2 1 2 3 and immediately I was in
[39:43] the spirit and behold a throne was set
[39:45] in heaven
[39:46] and one sat on the throne amen let's bow
[39:49] our heads for one more word of Prayer
[39:51] they have a need on your heart just make
[39:52] a known to God Heavenly Father forgive
[39:54] your nervous servant Lord forgive me
[39:57] Lord I'm skipping
[40:00] scriptures and almost running people
[40:01] over forgive me Lord I I just get
[40:03] nervous at times so Lord forgive me Lord
[40:07] just help me to settle down Lord we're
[40:09] grateful for your mercy and love or just
[40:11] minister by your spirit today Lord you
[40:13] promised you'd be with two or three we
[40:14] have more than that today Lord and we're
[40:16] we're grateful for every soul or no this
[40:19] is an appointed hour Lord we know you
[40:21] keep all your appointments Lord and Lord
[40:23] just we ask that you'd feed us by your
[40:26] spirit Lord God Lord direct every heart
[40:29] guide us Lord we know the footsteps of
[40:31] the righteous are ordered of the Lord so
[40:34] guide me your servant guide all your
[40:36] servants here in the in the sanctuary
[40:38] Lord God and bless those who couldn't
[40:40] make it
[40:40] Lord again be with the travelers Lord
[40:42] God and we love you Jesus will always
[40:44] love you and serve you you alone for you
[40:46] are God alone and when we give you all
[40:48] the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the
[40:50] church said Amen god bless usually being
[40:53] seated praise God so we like to continue
[41:03] this series on the book of Revelation
[41:05] you know it's really been kind of like a
[41:08] three-year series I've been working on I
[41:10] this weekend I took a few moments and I
[41:13] went back and looked at all the sermons
[41:15] you know we preached on it so this is
[41:17] chapter 4 part 1 but it's actually part
[41:19] 71 in the whole series and that's not
[41:21] even counting the the series we preached
[41:24] on the seven seals back in 2009 and 2010
[41:27] so it just it gives me a lot of strength
[41:30] to know that God has sent a messenger to
[41:32] us and he's told us so much about the
[41:35] revelations of the book of Revelation
[41:36] that we can preach weeks months and
[41:39] years on the book of Revelation so it's
[41:41] quite an inspiration to know that God
[41:44] has revealed so much to us we have
[41:46] nothing to be scared of when it comes to
[41:47] the book of Revelation so we're very
[41:49] grateful so this whole series like I
[41:51] said I went back and counted this series
[41:53] so I did two sermons on introducing the
[41:56] church ages and I did two sermons on
[41:58] just all the quotes with brother baron
[42:00] the power of the book of Revelation and
[42:02] then we did seven sermons on Revelation
[42:05] chapter 1 including the Sevenfold glory
[42:07] of Christ person on the Lord's Day and
[42:10] then we just finished up 59 sermons on
[42:13] Revelation chapters 2 and 3 in the
[42:16] church ages that brings us to a total of
[42:18] 70 and that's not including the the -
[42:20] the seven seals sermons we preached
[42:22] years ago but like I said that just it's
[42:25] comforting to me to know that God is
[42:26] directing us to his word and we really
[42:29] want to know about the book of
[42:30] Revelation the Bible said he that keeps
[42:32] what's written in the Book of Revelation
[42:34] will be blessed I don't want to be
[42:36] cursed by the Lord I want to be blessed
[42:37] so we're grateful to keep the Word of
[42:40] God that he has revealed to us through
[42:43] the book of Revelation through His
[42:44] Prophet
[42:45] so let's look today like I said I'm
[42:47] drawing my inspiration from the watch
[42:49] night service in 1960 as if you listen
[42:52] to it you know brother Branham was just
[42:53] the first preacher amongst many
[42:55] preachers he named different preachers
[42:57] that gave their testimonies that night
[42:58] and they preached all the way through
[43:00] midnight we just got done doing that
[43:02] North Carolina I think we had what three
[43:04] preachers at night I was the first one
[43:06] and then two other preachers after me
[43:07] and had a good time of the watch night
[43:09] service that was a real blessing and so
[43:13] we're grateful now I want to just you
[43:14] know I was listening to bleep part two
[43:17] if I'm not mistaken of this series and
[43:19] brother Branham tells us his desire
[43:23] brother Branham said he had to always
[43:24] had a longing desire to teach on the
[43:27] book of Revelation and he said if he
[43:29] could draw pictures and charts of the
[43:32] book of Revelation he said it would be a
[43:34] little taste of heaven so let me read it
[43:37] to you he says how you all enjoy I said
[43:40] how you all enjoy the revelation he said
[43:42] he said I believe a whole lot like my
[43:44] little girl Sara back there it's become
[43:45] revolutions to me it's just revolutions
[43:49] going over and over you know I wish we
[43:51] just had now about until March or April
[43:53] just to put a great big canvas across
[43:56] the back of the church here and just
[43:58] come down the daytime and draw out those
[44:00] pictures and the whole chart so he
[44:02] wanted to make charts of all the church
[44:04] ages and the book of Revelation and just
[44:07] raise them up and down like window
[44:08] shades you know like I've always dreamed
[44:11] sometimes I'm having a great big
[44:12] Tabernacle record just
[44:14] reach down and pull this chart down come
[44:16] all the way across the platform this was
[44:19] a dream of brother Brandon still be able
[44:21] to pull charts down you remember in
[44:22] school I still got one of those old
[44:24] social studies maps remember you had to
[44:26] pull it down I still got one in my class
[44:28] today the children all want to do it but
[44:30] I tell them if you do that you're gonna
[44:31] wind yourself up and you're gonna get
[44:32] wrapped around there because it pulls so
[44:34] hard so I don't let the children do that
[44:36] I just I'm the only one that pulls it
[44:37] down and so brother branham wanted to in
[44:40] the 60s here you want to be able to pull
[44:42] down a chart and just teach the Word of
[44:44] God and he said I have always dreamed of
[44:46] being able to do that now I'm just
[44:49] skipping ahead a little bit he said I've
[44:51] always dreamed about that he said and
[44:53] come all the way across the platform and
[44:54] the revelations and the interpretations
[44:57] the Lord has given to me and take a
[45:00] pointer and start down through there and
[45:02] bring these ages down then when we get
[45:04] through that raise that one up pull
[45:05] another one down like this and start on
[45:07] that and teach it through oh that would
[45:09] be just like a little heaven wouldn't it
[45:12] I only can say amen to that
[45:14] all right just bless my soul I heard
[45:16] this week just sit the complete winner
[45:19] through just sit it out with the Lord
[45:21] and Church what is God giving us God's
[45:24] giving us chart after chart after chart
[45:27] after chart if we're not careful it
[45:29] becomes common to us but if we have the
[45:32] understanding that God has revealed his
[45:34] revelations to us then it ought to be
[45:37] like a little heaven to us amen we know
[45:40] there's two resurrections this is a
[45:42] chart I made there's another chart I
[45:44] made on the Daniel's seventy weeks you
[45:46] have your three groups and then the last
[45:47] group is divided into two parts for
[45:49] three and a half all these charts are
[45:52] inspired not from man's ideas or
[45:54] seminaries or buts but from thus saith
[45:57] the Lord and not only that but he's
[45:59] revealed to us you know the four
[46:00] anointings over the church ages and the
[46:03] messengers and the years and he's
[46:05] revealed all these anointings and where
[46:07] they overlap God has revealed how Satan
[46:10] would get in the church through deeds
[46:12] and synagogues and doctrines and jezebel
[46:15] religion which is the very depth of
[46:17] Satan and now each age all the way up
[46:20] till we are to the lukewarm spirit that
[46:22] were battling and brother Brandis wish I
[46:25] wish I could just pull this one down and
[46:27] go to the
[46:27] x1and and look we can just do it with a
[46:29] simple finger honey how to pull anything
[46:31] down I just gotta go tap he was always
[46:34] dreamed in other words he dreamed about
[46:36] this that we could do this today
[46:37] remember this one the 6000 years brother
[46:41] Ram said you know we've had six thousand
[46:43] years there was after two thousand years
[46:44] was the flood and then two more thousand
[46:46] years and then Calvary and then two more
[46:49] thousand years and that's where we're at
[46:51] now
[46:51] now fire is going to come we know that
[46:53] and then we know this seventh day the
[46:57] millennium will be the seventh day that
[46:59] Christ that God never had with his
[47:01] children because it got interrupted and
[47:03] we know then the new heavens and new
[47:04] earth is the eighth day that's the New
[47:06] Jerusalem and that's the beginning of
[47:09] the cycle all over again by the grace of
[47:11] the Lord so see these are all charts
[47:14] that if we're not careful they just
[47:15] become common to us and we say oh that
[47:19] we need more and no doubt we need more
[47:22] revelation but we actually need more
[47:24] respect for what God has revealed to us
[47:26] it's just like your marriage if you're
[47:28] not careful it's going to become common
[47:30] and the very one you prayed for and
[47:32] cried for will just become common to you
[47:34] if you don't keep these things nice and
[47:36] sweet in our hearts
[47:37] is that right Church and then brother
[47:40] Branham said these things that he
[47:42] preached he knew he could only hit the
[47:43] highlights so he said the things he
[47:46] preached should be broken down and
[47:49] taught to the people that's what he said
[47:52] as he began the seven seal series he
[47:54] said now study that studied all and you
[47:56] people visiting here when you go to your
[47:58] motel rooms take those things and ponder
[48:00] over them see we're supposed to take
[48:02] time and ponder over what brother
[48:04] Branham preached he says when we don't
[48:07] but we don't have the time to break it
[48:09] down as it should be broke down but I
[48:12] want you to do it when you get to the
[48:15] motel or hotel or wherever you're
[48:17] staying or the home gather together and
[48:19] study over it aren't you glad you can
[48:22] live in a time where we can break down
[48:24] these revelations and you can see God's
[48:26] truth all the way from verse 1 all the
[48:28] way to the end of each chapter oh it's
[48:30] so glorious brother Ram could just hit
[48:32] the highlights many times but we get to
[48:35] take our time and as it was pulled down
[48:37] charts and rejoice and know what God's
[48:40] doing
[48:41] know that we're in the perfect will of
[48:42] God amen what a blessing I don't want to
[48:47] take that lightly I don't want to take
[48:49] God's Word for granted
[48:50] I don't want God's Word to become common
[48:52] to me with a hard heart I want to keep
[48:55] these things before my heart I want to
[48:57] keep humble I want to keep little on the
[48:59] sight of God I want to be humble and
[49:01] God's sight will never get anything from
[49:03] God if we exalt ourselves we've got to
[49:06] humble ourselves and he'll lift us up a
[49:08] new season amen so let's just begin this
[49:11] like I said I'll try to preach about an
[49:13] hour by the grace of Lord because I have
[49:16] to save my strength for tonight I'll
[49:18] probably be preaching part two tonight
[49:21] the same series that the Prophet
[49:23] preached and I know you'll be blessed by
[49:26] the grace of God so chapter four verse
[49:29] one after this I looked and behold a
[49:32] door was opened in heaven and the first
[49:35] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[49:38] trumpet talking with me which said come
[49:40] up hither and I will show thee things
[49:43] which must be Hereafter
[49:46] praise the Lord so the first thought the
[49:48] Prophet brings out as this thought on
[49:51] after this in verse one so I think
[49:53] there's nine or eight thoughts in here I
[49:55] listen to the whole sermon over and over
[49:57] and kept writing down you know what what
[49:59] the Prophet emphasized and so the first
[50:02] thought was this thought on after this
[50:04] and the Prophet said see what's
[50:08] happening in Chapter four
[50:10] are things that would happen after the
[50:13] seven church ages he says he says John
[50:17] of course was a type of the bride and
[50:20] John left the the seven church ages and
[50:25] he said it's a type of the church
[50:27] leaving here he says and then the church
[50:31] never appears again until revelation
[50:34] 19:7 right and so we understand that now
[50:38] we know as we preach this a few years
[50:40] ago we know the bride shows up between
[50:43] there though she makes a little a few
[50:46] cameos right she shows up in the sit and
[50:50] the seven seals right she shows up in
[50:52] the first second third fourth seal does
[50:53] she not
[50:55] so she makes a little cameo she's the
[50:58] one that Satan can't touch her oil and
[51:00] wine praise God hallelujah she's the one
[51:04] who's got the anointing of the four
[51:05] anointings the four living creatures and
[51:08] then she shows up in Revelation 10 where
[51:11] there's a mighty angel comes out and
[51:13] brings the open book and then John
[51:16] receives it from brother Branham or the
[51:17] seventh angel right and it takes it to
[51:20] all the world who's he taking it to
[51:21] they're taking it to the bride of Jesus
[51:23] Christ amen so we know we know what
[51:26] brother man was saying though the bride
[51:28] goes up after that tribulation happens
[51:32] judgments fall destructions fall but
[51:36] then we we know the bride is kept from
[51:38] all that and the next time we see her
[51:40] she's at the marriage supper the lamb
[51:42] amen having that promised communion that
[51:45] jesus promised that i will gain sup with
[51:48] you I'll drink a new of the vine again
[51:50] but it'll be in my father's kingdom amen
[51:53] we know that and so we understand what
[51:57] the Prophet is saying here and brother
[51:59] Branham said he makes this then he jumps
[52:01] to that thought in revelation 19:7
[52:03] the bride makes herself ready amen and
[52:07] he tells the story of the son of the
[52:10] superintendent from the armor and Swiss
[52:12] company which were very familiar with
[52:13] but he tells that story and the son was
[52:16] looking for a wife and he couldn't find
[52:18] a wife in Chicago so he goes out west to
[52:20] his family and and all the girls know
[52:22] that that he's going to come looking for
[52:25] a wife and all the cousins and they all
[52:28] dress up in there and there are
[52:29] beautiful dresses but the real sweet
[52:31] godly woman was too busy to get dressed
[52:33] up and she's washing dishes and and the
[52:36] son you know he went to the party and
[52:38] you know there he didn't really dance
[52:39] with any girls didn't see really godly
[52:41] character and he must have slipped by
[52:43] and seen her washing dishes maybe in the
[52:45] kitchen off to the side and he went back
[52:47] out and come back in he said God must
[52:50] have spoke to his heart and said this is
[52:52] your wife you mean to propose to her
[52:54] right now God must have gave him some
[52:57] revelation amen
[52:58] she couldn't even believe it like you
[53:00] want to marry me program says that's how
[53:03] the church is how could Jesus want to
[53:05] marry me but we know that the son saw a
[53:07] godly King
[53:08] and we know Jesus sees that we want his
[53:11] character amen
[53:12] that we live his character we don't look
[53:14] fancy and program said the girls are
[53:16] like in denominations that dress up
[53:18] their churches and in glamour and money
[53:21] and popularity and big buildings and all
[53:24] these things he said but the real life
[53:26] had character
[53:28] she was the servant and Jesus said the
[53:30] greatest among you is the servants amen
[53:33] exactly right she was an orphan brother
[53:36] Ram said she had no father or mother
[53:39] right and we just feel like orphans in
[53:42] this world praise God we just were
[53:44] rejected by our families rejected by our
[53:46] friends we're just rejected by everybody
[53:49] but thank God if they threw us out
[53:51] Jesus will catch us with his
[53:53] nail-scarred hand amen hallelujah
[53:56] as well if that tonight you know brother
[53:58] I'm told a story and while he was
[54:00] preaching this series and he was saying
[54:02] God is doing such great things right now
[54:05] in the church you know Jefferson it was
[54:06] just really quiet he said God is shaking
[54:09] the earth right now with a message
[54:10] mother and said let me prove it to you
[54:13] he said when Jesus Christ came to the
[54:15] earth he said there was millions and
[54:17] billions of people on the earth and
[54:18] Jesus came and never left the Judean
[54:21] area other than go down to Egypt when he
[54:23] was younger and he said brother man said
[54:25] Jesus came was crucified raised and he
[54:29] said hardly anybody even heard about it
[54:31] and brother man said Jesus only comes to
[54:35] the elect Amen I knew ya so the fact
[54:38] that you've heard this Bible restored
[54:41] and preached that proves you're one of
[54:43] his elect amen and great things are
[54:47] happening but it's not what we really
[54:49] see with our eyes it's the individuals
[54:52] cuz the Gentile bride is an individual
[54:54] bride right she's she's not a group of
[54:57] people or a nation
[54:58] she's a group of individuals that love
[55:01] Christ and she's slowly being made ready
[55:04] by the Holy Spirit as God shakes
[55:07] everything that can be shaken and
[55:08] everything else falls but you and I
[55:11] stand because we're wise we built our
[55:13] foundation upon a rock amen the Word of
[55:16] God hallelujah that's exactly right
[55:19] and you know the story where brother man
[55:22] said you know the
[55:23] the year came and and the whole year she
[55:26] was you know working making her nickels
[55:27] so she could buy a wedding dress and
[55:29] then brother Han said she went and stood
[55:31] out there with her wedding dress on and
[55:32] everybody's laughing the sun's going
[55:34] down oh you poor creature you miss a
[55:36] real creature you really think he's
[55:38] going to come and marry you and they're
[55:41] like oh you just got one more hour she's
[55:43] like he's coming oh you only got 15 more
[55:46] minutes he said he'd be here you're down
[55:50] to 30 seconds and they laughed and threw
[55:53] vegetables at her and they made fun of
[55:55] her but pretty soon they heard the
[55:57] galloping horse I don't know how to do a
[55:58] galloping horse to you I'm not a ride
[56:00] horses but but the pretty soon she heard
[56:02] the galloping horses and and all the
[56:05] dirt and the dirt clouds are rising and
[56:08] God and you know God touched her heart
[56:11] and then she saw him come and he stops
[56:14] and everybody else said he he picked her
[56:16] off her feet and gave her a kiss and
[56:19] brought her into the carriage and drove
[56:22] off and all the cousins are you know sad
[56:24] and shocked and everything like that
[56:26] that's exactly how the rapture is gonna
[56:28] be praise God we're going to be mocked
[56:30] and made fun of but Jesus said do not
[56:33] fear little flock amen
[56:35] don't be scared of the time don't be
[56:38] scared of what's happening do not fear
[56:40] it's God's good will to give us the
[56:43] kingdom amen
[56:45] because we've already received a portion
[56:47] of the kingdom for the kingdom of God is
[56:49] within us hallelujah glory so he says
[56:53] his wife makes herself ready and then
[56:55] brother man pulls an interesting tight
[56:57] he used Elijah as the type of the bride
[57:00] which is a great type right Elijah came
[57:04] and Elijah said give me a double portion
[57:06] he said if you watch me today he said
[57:09] you will get your request it's a hard
[57:11] thing to do it's a hard thing for
[57:13] somebody to get a double anointing of
[57:15] the Holy Ghost that's a hard thing but
[57:18] you've got to keep your eye right on the
[57:20] message of the hour amen
[57:22] I believe said Elijah made himself ready
[57:25] because he followed the prophet Elijah
[57:28] and he looked and waited and when he saw
[57:31] the garment come down he had to go and
[57:33] catch the garment or the the mantle and
[57:35] then he
[57:36] the mantle put it on and then he used
[57:38] the mantle and that was Elijah making
[57:42] himself ready Church we've got to
[57:44] receive the same Holy Spirit that
[57:45] brother Branham received and we've got
[57:47] to speak Jesus's name the same way
[57:50] brother Branham spoken amen and if we do
[57:52] that then we are making ourselves ready
[57:55] by the same anointing that was on him
[57:57] amen I've always told that story like
[58:00] this I knew I had a greater even greater
[58:03] revelation that brother Branham was a
[58:05] true prophet after I went the guy on in
[58:06] the first time because that's the first
[58:10] time ever cast out devils and when I did
[58:14] it the Holy Spirit just anointed me and
[58:17] said divine love cast out demons and
[58:20] after that I was no longer scared us
[58:22] little teenage girl you know she was
[58:23] staring straight ahead with this deathly
[58:25] you know look on her face and and
[58:27] wouldn't talk to me very much at first
[58:29] and then after that anointing came over
[58:33] me I thought I know how Jesus did it
[58:34] Jesus would take the sick person or
[58:36] wherever and he would separate them from
[58:38] all the scoffers I took her around to
[58:40] the back of the church there the Church
[58:41] of the firstborn and his squab oh it's a
[58:44] little island of ask Weibo I think
[58:46] that's how you say it and it was at that
[58:50] moment that I said do you want to be
[58:53] delivered from this demon and she nodded
[58:55] and so I just said let's join hands we
[58:58] had a couple preachers with us there and
[58:59] as soon as I bow my head and pray she
[59:02] started fighting and kicking it and
[59:04] doing everything hitting me with her
[59:05] hands you know I just stayed kept taking
[59:07] the hits you know and holding onto her
[59:09] hand like this and I just said this I
[59:11] said it Satan the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:14] is against you and it wasn't just maybe
[59:18] a minute we just kept praying us and I
[59:19] said Satan you must leave this child of
[59:22] God the blood of Jesus Christ is against
[59:24] you and pretty soon she loud this loud
[59:26] scream like some evil would happen and
[59:29] then she fell down like she was dead and
[59:31] then I went and shook her you know woke
[59:34] her up and she was different she felt
[59:35] better and I lifted her up and we just
[59:37] sang a song of Thanksgiving there and
[59:40] then that took me back to the Bible
[59:42] because when Jesus casted out the Bible
[59:44] said that the demons gnashed a person
[59:46] let out a great scream and then fell
[59:48] down his dead
[59:49] and that was the moment where I knew
[59:52] brother man's message was even more of a
[59:55] Bible message because the very things
[59:57] Jesus did he was now doing in me praise
[59:59] God because I just followed the word
[1:00:02] followed the message like brother
[1:00:04] branham's hearted amen see that's us
[1:00:08] making ourselves ready taking what the
[1:00:11] Word of God says and putting it into
[1:00:13] action by the grace of the Lord amen
[1:00:16] hallelujah
[1:00:18] program said making yourself ready is
[1:00:21] keeping all the evil out of your heart
[1:00:24] if you have anything against anybody the
[1:00:28] Holy Spirit would implore us all to get
[1:00:31] that evil out of our hearts don't have
[1:00:33] any evil feelings toward anyone talk to
[1:00:36] them write a letter to them call them on
[1:00:39] the phone whenever you have to do but we
[1:00:40] must rid all evil out of our hearts if
[1:00:42] we're going to be ready for the rapture
[1:00:46] then my brother branham kind of breaks
[1:00:48] off that thought and he jumps into
[1:00:50] divine healing I'm just gonna preach it
[1:00:51] because I like this thought he gave well
[1:00:54] Graham said you know he said when a
[1:00:56] Pentecostal preacher does something
[1:00:58] wrong he said the newspaper splashing
[1:00:59] across the front pages you know brother
[1:01:01] Han was standing up for the pennant that
[1:01:02] was the move of the hour the
[1:01:03] Pentecostals but brother Han said you
[1:01:05] let a Catholic priest make a mistake
[1:01:07] they'll never put anything on it and he
[1:01:11] said anybody that doesn't believe in
[1:01:12] divine healing they'll never attack that
[1:01:13] he said but we believe in divine healing
[1:01:16] and brother man made this point he said
[1:01:20] he said there was an article where they
[1:01:21] said a person died believing in divine
[1:01:24] healing and God didn't heal them he said
[1:01:25] it was splashed across the newspaper and
[1:01:28] brother Branham said something along
[1:01:30] these lines
[1:01:30] he said how many in the grave let's say
[1:01:33] that person did die they were believing
[1:01:35] in divine healing but God didn't answer
[1:01:36] that time he said let's say that did
[1:01:38] happen he said but I wonder let's
[1:01:40] compare how many are in the graveyard
[1:01:43] that died
[1:01:44] trusting in medical science compared to
[1:01:47] those that in the graveyard that were
[1:01:49] counting in divine healing amen I like
[1:01:52] that what was bro time saying he said
[1:01:55] I'd rather die believing in divine
[1:01:58] healing than trusting in medical science
[1:02:00] he said and no doubt there's Eve
[1:02:03] there's millions that died believing in
[1:02:05] medical science to make me just a few
[1:02:06] that died believing in divine healing
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:10] Church we must rest upon God's Word no
[1:02:13] matter how God chooses to take us off
[1:02:15] the scene if the rapture doesn't happen
[1:02:17] at all eyes let's have a confidence
[1:02:19] let's trust let's stand on God's side
[1:02:22] amen let's be fully convinced whatever
[1:02:25] whatever the situation I'd rather stay
[1:02:27] with God and be a fanatic than stand
[1:02:30] with the world and their changing ideas
[1:02:32] and beliefs let's say was something
[1:02:34] that's eternal now saith the Lord amen I
[1:02:37] thought that was a good point don't you
[1:02:40] Oh maja was so blessed to hear that
[1:02:44] what a blessing now before we move on
[1:02:49] this week I was really blessed you know
[1:02:51] someone watched one of my videos I made
[1:02:53] it was called the five reasons the
[1:02:55] raptures pre-tribulation and it kind of
[1:02:57] ties in with this because John was a
[1:02:58] type of the rapture and some even a
[1:03:04] brother from some non-denominational
[1:03:05] Church he said my this video would open
[1:03:09] my eyes and the whole time I know it's
[1:03:10] you know revelations God gave brother
[1:03:11] Brad as I told him God sent a prophet
[1:03:14] and he wasn't really interested in that
[1:03:15] he just want to know the reasons the
[1:03:16] rapture would go before the tribulation
[1:03:18] so uh he said I was so inspired he said
[1:03:22] I took your notes and I went and
[1:03:23] preached at my church and he said it was
[1:03:24] really well received so he gave me a
[1:03:26] link to watch his sermon but I haven't
[1:03:28] watched it yet I just haven't had time
[1:03:29] you know I got a listen to Branham I
[1:03:32] haven't had time yet maybe this summer
[1:03:34] I'll have time but I just want to
[1:03:37] refresh these to your heart because I
[1:03:39] was even listening this morning to
[1:03:40] brother Branham brother Graham said
[1:03:41] these again there's at least five
[1:03:43] reasons we go before the tribulation the
[1:03:46] first is that the tribulation is trouble
[1:03:49] for Jacob because it's called Jacob's
[1:03:51] trouble
[1:03:52] it's not called trouble for the Gentile
[1:03:54] bride amen it's called Jacob's trouble
[1:03:59] it's purging for Israel and it's purging
[1:04:02] for the foolish version but the Bride of
[1:04:04] Christ has already purged a men she's
[1:04:07] purged right now lujah purged from her
[1:04:10] sin unbelief and lust and pride and
[1:04:13] greed she's purged from all that
[1:04:15] washing the blood of God's own son amen
[1:04:18] the second program said there's no
[1:04:22] mention of the bride in the book of
[1:04:23] Revelation in the tribulation chapters
[1:04:26] of Revelation like chapters nine right
[1:04:30] nine ten and I'm sorry nine eleven
[1:04:32] twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
[1:04:34] seventeen eighteen there's no mention of
[1:04:37] the bride in any of those chapters it's
[1:04:39] never talking about the churches or all
[1:04:40] these things it's all dealing with
[1:04:42] Mystery Babylon Israel and then foolish
[1:04:45] virgins that's exactly right
[1:04:47] so God cared so much he didn't even put
[1:04:50] the word Church in any of those chapters
[1:04:52] he kept those four chapters 1 2 & 3 and
[1:04:56] then 19 onto the end amen and then the
[1:05:00] third one is that the bride is promised
[1:05:03] a pardon from the wrath of God 1st
[1:05:07] Thessalonians 1:10 said that Jesus has
[1:05:09] delivered us from the wrath that is to
[1:05:12] come amen the Bible says we do not have
[1:05:16] to go through the wrath because that's
[1:05:17] what Christ experienced on the cross
[1:05:19] amen he took our tribulation period
[1:05:22] there amen
[1:05:24] he bore our sins and the chastisement of
[1:05:27] our peace and and the all of our sins or
[1:05:30] he's wounded for our transgressions
[1:05:32] right he took our transgressions then
[1:05:34] the punishment for our transgressions
[1:05:36] they already paid for and he conquered
[1:05:38] her sins already amen
[1:05:40] he didn't have any sins of his own to
[1:05:42] conquer so he conquered your sins amen
[1:05:45] he conquered my sins hallelujah we ought
[1:05:47] to rejoice in that hallelujah amen
[1:05:51] fourthly
[1:05:52] Jesus taught the rapture was imminent
[1:05:55] which means it could come at any unknown
[1:05:57] or surprising day or hour and that's
[1:06:00] different than the Jews the Jews always
[1:06:03] have a set time humming Oh Daniel 70
[1:06:06] weeks is a set time is that right that's
[1:06:10] what Jesus taught he said of the church
[1:06:12] at the times of the Gentiles Jesus
[1:06:14] literally said those words the times of
[1:06:16] the Gentiles in Luke chapter 21 Jesus
[1:06:20] said there's time for the Gentiles it's
[1:06:22] unknown any so if you do a
[1:06:25] mid-tribulation rapture you could
[1:06:27] actually count the days and know when
[1:06:29] mid-tribulation rapture was right yeah
[1:06:33] absolutely
[1:06:33] you would know so it would be ridiculous
[1:06:36] to say that the rapture is in the middle
[1:06:38] of the tribulation or after the
[1:06:40] tribulation or that the rapture already
[1:06:41] happened the rapture didn't already
[1:06:43] happen we're here and lair to see yeah
[1:06:45] now the rapture happened in your heart
[1:06:47] you have a foretaste of the rapture but
[1:06:50] the full rapture is the redemption of
[1:06:52] your body amen it's what our bodies are
[1:06:55] swallowed up in life amen
[1:06:59] that's the fullness of the rapture yes I
[1:07:01] know the shouts gone yes I believe the
[1:07:03] rapture started in our hearts but the
[1:07:05] fullness of the rapture cannot take
[1:07:07] place to the shout boys Trump and we
[1:07:10] meet Christ in the air a men hallelujah
[1:07:14] people get so lost on their own ideas
[1:07:16] we've got to stay with the Word of God
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:18] stay with the message god help us
[1:07:23] and then the fifth reason the fifth and
[1:07:26] final are now if you have more let me
[1:07:27] know so I can update that video with the
[1:07:30] fifth one is that the rapture is
[1:07:34] actually the removing of God's grace
[1:07:37] before the Antichrist is revealed and
[1:07:40] God returns to the Jews it's actually
[1:07:43] the removal of God's grace right because
[1:07:47] the Bible said that in 2nd Thessalonians
[1:07:49] chapter 2 that God will let all these
[1:07:52] things happen until he be taken out of
[1:07:54] the way right so see there's five
[1:07:58] obvious Bible reasons revelations that
[1:08:01] you and I will not have to experience
[1:08:03] the tribulation if we're born again Oh
[1:08:05] hallelujah aren't you glad you're born
[1:08:07] again haha please God amen
[1:08:12] it's a tremendous privilege to be born
[1:08:14] again in this hour amen so let's go to
[1:08:18] the next thought number two remember
[1:08:21] these are all the thoughts that he
[1:08:23] preached in this part one the second
[1:08:27] thought is the door was open in heaven
[1:08:30] this is a little shorter thought but
[1:08:32] brother Graham reads Revelation 3:8 and
[1:08:34] John 10 where Jesus said I am the door
[1:08:38] of the Sheep praise God well Graham said
[1:08:41] the shepherd is
[1:08:42] the door for the Sheep hallelujah and
[1:08:45] Brougham said John went through the door
[1:08:47] or in other words he went through Christ
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:51] Jesus said I am the door and brother Ram
[1:08:54] says that Jesus is the one way because
[1:08:57] Jesus said I am the way the truth and
[1:08:59] the life in the head but man said Jesus
[1:09:03] was that open door if you remember the
[1:09:04] church ages the door actually opened in
[1:09:07] Philadelphia how many member that it was
[1:09:09] the age of the open door why was it the
[1:09:11] age of the open door because the name of
[1:09:13] Jesus Christ was restored in Baptism and
[1:09:16] casting out Devils in power and Godhead
[1:09:19] amen glory and the day was open and now
[1:09:24] John is going through that door he's
[1:09:26] going through the anointing of the Lord
[1:09:27] Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:29] it's exactly right the program said see
[1:09:33] it's one door he said can you picture
[1:09:35] Noah standing there for 120 years and as
[1:09:39] the ark is no nois preaching by one door
[1:09:42] Oh hallelujah
[1:09:46] you seen the ark in Kentucky yet oh I
[1:09:48] think of that every time I think of
[1:09:49] preach on Noah now this huge art and
[1:09:52] it's got only one door in now they've
[1:09:55] got other ways in but really there's
[1:09:56] only one way in there's a little off the
[1:09:59] word which we expect yeah they don't
[1:10:01] they don't know the message or they
[1:10:02] reject it or whatever happens but bo-ram
[1:10:04] said Noah stood in the door of the ark
[1:10:07] and preached repentance and
[1:10:09] righteousness and everybody who wanted
[1:10:12] to be saved had to come through the one
[1:10:14] door that's right I can imagine you know
[1:10:19] Noah standing there in order to get
[1:10:22] through in order to get through the
[1:10:24] tribulation well that's what we would
[1:10:25] say right for their day in order to be
[1:10:28] carried over through the tribulation
[1:10:30] right he said you'd have to come up
[1:10:33] you'd have to hear Noah preached you
[1:10:36] have to confess your unrighteousness
[1:10:38] because he was a preacher of
[1:10:39] righteousness you have to go up there
[1:10:42] you have to repent love God worship God
[1:10:44] made me go to a sacrifice then you have
[1:10:46] to shake know in his family's hands as
[1:10:48] you walked in there to the ark you have
[1:10:50] to be one of them Holy Ghost rollers
[1:10:52] amen
[1:10:53] it's I'm so glad
[1:10:55] I can say I'm one of them it looks just
[1:10:58] like a little family Church but each one
[1:11:00] of those believers that really believe
[1:11:02] God's Word they were unashamed and they
[1:11:04] said I'm going through the day or
[1:11:06] hallelujah
[1:11:07] just like we today say we're going
[1:11:09] through Jesus Christ name hey man so
[1:11:13] John if he was going to go through a
[1:11:15] rapture Revelation chapter 4 he'd have
[1:11:17] to go through the one door Jesus Christ
[1:11:19] amen that's what we're going through the
[1:11:22] name of Jesus Christ that's exactly
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:26] third thought number three is the voice
[1:11:31] of the trumpet the Bible said here in
[1:11:34] verse one that the first voice which I
[1:11:37] heard and that's in that sweet I don't
[1:11:39] really put notes about that but it was
[1:11:40] the first voice what's the first voice
[1:11:43] you hear in the morning is it the voice
[1:11:46] of the Lord I hope so when you turn on
[1:11:48] your phone or turn on your computer or
[1:11:50] whatever you do in the morning hope it's
[1:11:52] not the radio and some you know some
[1:11:54] advertising I don't the first voice you
[1:11:56] hear in the morning is the voice of
[1:11:58] Jesus so he gets raptured up after the
[1:12:01] church ages John gets raptured up
[1:12:03] because he's going to see the things
[1:12:05] that come after the church ages he gets
[1:12:06] raptured up and the first thing he hears
[1:12:09] is the voice of Christ
[1:12:10] hey man and that beautiful because Jesus
[1:12:14] is the first in the last he's the first
[1:12:17] thing we should think about when we go
[1:12:18] to bed I'm sure we wake up and the last
[1:12:20] thing we think about when we go to bed
[1:12:21] but a man said the he said put the house
[1:12:24] of God first brother Branham said he
[1:12:26] said pay your tithe first all these
[1:12:28] firsts set your heart on things above
[1:12:30] and not this earth
[1:12:31] hey man first the first voice he hears
[1:12:35] is the voice of Christ but RAM said see
[1:12:40] now the scene has changed
[1:12:42] it was Patmos he had a vision and Patmos
[1:12:45] and now brother Ram said he's lifted up
[1:12:47] maybe translated from Patmos to heaven
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:52] Oh glory the voice of a trumpet Amen now
[1:13:05] think notes I want to say here but Ram
[1:13:08] said the voice has a clearness of that
[1:13:11] as a trumpet but Lam said a trumpet
[1:13:14] means two things that gathering together
[1:13:16] and also war in the Bible so he said the
[1:13:21] church ages were now done at least in
[1:13:23] John's he's getting a preview of things
[1:13:25] to come the voice at in chapter 1 was
[1:13:30] behind him I remember that in Revelation
[1:13:33] chapter 1 John standing all of a sudden
[1:13:35] here's a voice and he turns to look at
[1:13:36] the voice and brother picks us up and
[1:13:39] said look the voice that was behind him
[1:13:41] that he turned to look to that voice has
[1:13:44] now gone up to heaven amen
[1:13:47] hallelujah and brother him said that's
[1:13:49] because Jesus earthly work was now
[1:13:52] finished the Holy Spirit unto the church
[1:13:57] Ages brother Branham says Jesus's own
[1:13:59] body Jesus's own presence was there with
[1:14:03] the candlesticks and so it proved
[1:14:05] Jesus's Holy Spirit is with us today in
[1:14:08] these church ages he's with us today I
[1:14:12] know there's I'm gonna preach on this
[1:14:13] dementia there's times God withdrawals
[1:14:15] himself from our lives I'm gonna preach
[1:14:16] on that coming up here by God's grace
[1:14:18] there's all these scriptures about God
[1:14:20] how he withdraws himself from real
[1:14:22] believers to test them I feel like
[1:14:25] that's what I'm going through right now
[1:14:26] I'm going through a test a lot of tests
[1:14:29] lately but I'm willing to walk with
[1:14:31] God's despise whew
[1:14:33] but see this voice Jesus was with the
[1:14:37] candlesticks and he heard that voice in
[1:14:39] the midst of the candlesticks but now
[1:14:41] that voice has moved up to heaven and it
[1:14:44] called him up and said come up hither o
[1:14:46] my Jesus earthly work was finished in
[1:14:50] other words his spirit left the the
[1:14:53] times of the Gentiles brother Branham
[1:14:59] said
[1:15:00] that this is the setting of the great
[1:15:01] battle on the earth now once Jesus left
[1:15:03] with the candlesticks
[1:15:04] he said now those who rejected the Holy
[1:15:06] Spirit must go through the tribulation
[1:15:08] period he said Jesus is now getting
[1:15:12] ready to pour out the plagues from
[1:15:13] heaven how many know he does that the
[1:15:16] scripture tells us he's there sitting on
[1:15:18] the throne and then these vials get
[1:15:19] poured out by angels you know well if it
[1:15:21] will preach on that adventure I'm gonna
[1:15:22] go through I want to preach the whole
[1:15:24] book of Revelation so far I'm sorry the
[1:15:26] whole book so so far I'm free chapter
[1:15:28] one two three now man four so we'll get
[1:15:30] there Lord willing if God terry's I want
[1:15:32] to preach the whole thing and he says
[1:15:36] this is what is happening
[1:15:38] Jesus getting ready to pull out the
[1:15:40] plagues but RAM said it behooves us to
[1:15:44] check-up daily he said we must die daily
[1:15:47] I trust you do that every day I trust
[1:15:52] you take a moment and say well where's
[1:15:54] my house my heart doing with the Lord
[1:15:55] right now is there anything I need to
[1:15:58] confess is there anything I need to make
[1:16:00] right God knows we need to do that every
[1:16:02] day he said Jesus getting ready to pour
[1:16:09] out the plagues at this time now
[1:16:10] remember what did chapter 1 say when
[1:16:11] John was in the spirit and he started
[1:16:13] seeing these visions he said I was in
[1:16:15] the spirit on the Lord's Day program
[1:16:19] tells the Lord's Day is at the end of
[1:16:21] the Battle of Armageddon when Christ
[1:16:23] comes back that picture I had the
[1:16:24] beginning when Christ comes back and now
[1:16:26] he starts the sword comes out of his
[1:16:29] mouth and starts destroying all the king
[1:16:30] as a man brother Bram said that is the
[1:16:32] Lord's Day because the kingdoms of men
[1:16:34] had become the kingdoms of our God amen
[1:16:37] so see John was transported and he sees
[1:16:41] envision Jesus and what he's going to
[1:16:43] look like there at the time of judgment
[1:16:46] and now that Jesus that was there though
[1:16:49] in the church ages has now gone up and
[1:16:51] he goes up and he sees and hears the
[1:16:56] voice as a trumpet thank God for the
[1:17:00] trumpet amen
[1:17:02] now brother him said this is the same
[1:17:04] voice he heard now it speaks from heaven
[1:17:07] program stops it makes a remark about
[1:17:09] how he must have the the wedding
[1:17:13] garments on for the
[1:17:14] sure how many remember the parable where
[1:17:16] Jesus told that parable he said the king
[1:17:20] was having a feast for his son and
[1:17:21] everybody came in and everybody had all
[1:17:24] wedding garments except one person
[1:17:26] my brother ham said in those days you
[1:17:28] had to shake somebody's hand maybe the
[1:17:31] the bridegroom's hand at the door to get
[1:17:33] into the wedding reception and he would
[1:17:35] give you a garment and brother ham said
[1:17:38] every Holy Ghost Christian looks alike
[1:17:41] to God no matter how poor you are no
[1:17:44] matter how rich you are every Holy Ghost
[1:17:47] full person looks the same in the sight
[1:17:49] of God program said that's because you
[1:17:52] all come through the door amen
[1:17:54] you all get borned again hallelujah your
[1:17:58] mother says you all act the same way you
[1:18:02] love the world amen you love the Holy
[1:18:04] Spirit you love God's grace amen he said
[1:18:08] you've all washed your garments and made
[1:18:09] them white in the blood of God's own son
[1:18:13] he said that man who didn't have the
[1:18:15] garment climbed up through a window
[1:18:17] somewhere man can you imagine he was so
[1:18:20] scared of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:21] he said I'll just try to climb in the
[1:18:23] window I'll just I'll just try to go
[1:18:25] this way and hopefully brother so-and-so
[1:18:26] her sister so-and-so won't see me I'll
[1:18:28] try to get in there
[1:18:29] can you imagine he was so scared of
[1:18:32] acting like everybody else I want to be
[1:18:34] in there but I don't want to be filled
[1:18:36] with the Holy Ghost Church we should be
[1:18:37] so filled with the Holy Ghost people
[1:18:39] should see God's Spirit in our lives
[1:18:41] amen
[1:18:41] they should know something's different
[1:18:44] about that guy that girl's got zeal for
[1:18:46] the lay that woman's got zeal she loves
[1:18:48] Jesus if that's one thing I know about
[1:18:50] her is that she loves Jesus amen
[1:18:52] we should look different like when I got
[1:18:56] my job I was telling to the people when
[1:18:58] I got my job there was teachers in there
[1:18:59] that word denominational Christians and
[1:19:01] they said as soon as I walked in they
[1:19:03] knew I was a Christian without saying
[1:19:04] one word they said there was a glow on
[1:19:06] my face and they said that guy's a
[1:19:08] Christian and then when I introduced you
[1:19:11] don't make up to them they didn't like
[1:19:12] me anymore but that that's okay I can
[1:19:15] laugh about that cuz I still have love
[1:19:16] for them
[1:19:17] I still love for them they don't know
[1:19:19] they don't like that that's fine but we
[1:19:20] like it cuz it's the Bible but see
[1:19:23] that's the kind of glow we should have
[1:19:25] on our lives is that people can see
[1:19:27] their
[1:19:28] something different because he loved she
[1:19:29] looked much more her life should look
[1:19:31] much more different than death again if
[1:19:34] we've got the life of Jesus if we've got
[1:19:36] Jesus own life our lives our faces even
[1:19:39] number Stephens face was was like a face
[1:19:41] of an angel
[1:19:42] we should have angel faces hallelujah
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:45] I like that so he stops it he said Jesus
[1:19:49] even called this man a friend but then
[1:19:52] cast him out so listen as friendly as
[1:19:55] Jesus is he is gonna call he's gonna
[1:19:57] call people friend but he's gonna kick
[1:19:59] them out of the rapture do that of
[1:20:00] course they'll never go in the rapture
[1:20:01] you understand it's a parable but he'll
[1:20:04] kick them out they won't be hanging they
[1:20:06] won't be I say associated with the Holy
[1:20:09] Ghost Saints at the time of the rapture
[1:20:11] remember I preached out a few years ago
[1:20:13] the Bible said that the father walked in
[1:20:16] and it was his last time he came down
[1:20:18] here and he started is the last time he
[1:20:20] started separating before the wedding
[1:20:22] started see there's going to be a move
[1:20:24] of the Holy Ghost in the last day and
[1:20:26] it's gonna be such a move of the Holy
[1:20:27] Ghost it may have happened already with
[1:20:29] all this believe the sudden nonsense and
[1:20:31] the father is going to come in and he's
[1:20:33] going to ruin everybody who's not born
[1:20:35] again and we can say friend we love you
[1:20:39] but you don't have the garment on you've
[1:20:41] got to go through the door like John
[1:20:44] you've got to go through the door
[1:20:45] Lorenza you've got to go pray up you've
[1:20:47] got to lay on the altar
[1:20:49] you've got to die to yourself you've got
[1:20:51] to want God's Word more than your own
[1:20:52] food amen you got to be willing to
[1:20:55] sacrifice and and pray and fast you've
[1:20:58] got to love God more than anything else
[1:21:00] in the world but see give it a few years
[1:21:02] you find out what's more important to
[1:21:04] people food riches money cars all these
[1:21:08] things what's more important is the Word
[1:21:10] of God or is the tractions of the world
[1:21:12] more important give it a few years by
[1:21:14] their fruits they're known maybe it was
[1:21:17] some people it's even months and weeks
[1:21:18] you find out
[1:21:19] that's really sad breaks our hearts but
[1:21:23] for those of us who are standing the
[1:21:24] test of time it ought to be an
[1:21:26] encouragement to us why because you're
[1:21:28] making your calling and election sure
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:32] we're proving which side were on
[1:21:34] hallelujah we're making it true they're
[1:21:37] making it obvious everyone which side
[1:21:39] we're on glory
[1:21:41] Oh BAM said there's no other way you
[1:21:43] can't come through a window of a creed
[1:21:45] or a window of a church membership you
[1:21:48] got to come through the door the baptism
[1:21:51] of the Holy Ghost hey man I love that
[1:21:54] suburban ends this part by saying Jesus
[1:21:57] was showing John the church age was over
[1:21:59] he's come up now into heaven
[1:22:03] alright now it seems like I'm missing
[1:22:07] something for my studies Oh we'll get
[1:22:13] back oh yeah here this yeah oh yeah
[1:22:15] program makes a statement he goes on and
[1:22:17] preaches more thoughts and he comes back
[1:22:18] to the trumpet and he said brother Aaron
[1:22:20] says I just can't get away from that
[1:22:22] voice I hope that's how you feel this
[1:22:23] morning I just can't get away from the
[1:22:26] voice of God speaking through his word
[1:22:29] amen program yes that's right so that I
[1:22:33] took notes right in the order of the
[1:22:34] sermon usually have more time to kind of
[1:22:36] adjust them and it had much time this
[1:22:38] week
[1:22:38] he said that voice left the earth when
[1:22:42] it was behind John and then in front of
[1:22:44] John and then that voice called John up
[1:22:46] to heaven and then Bertram reads the
[1:22:48] rapture tax of the shout voice Trump and
[1:22:51] brother Branham said we know what the
[1:22:54] voice is going to say praise God
[1:22:57] the voice is going to say come up hither
[1:22:59] is that right
[1:23:00] there's a shout voice and Trump of God
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:05] and brother have said that voice shout
[1:23:08] voice Trump brother branham said it's
[1:23:09] the voice of Christ brother and said
[1:23:13] Christ this is a literal quote Christ is
[1:23:15] the voice of the Archangel I don't know
[1:23:19] I know that hill Michael's an archangel
[1:23:22] he's only an archangel I know of but he
[1:23:26] said Christ is the voice of the
[1:23:28] Archangel so in other words remember
[1:23:30] brother Graham said in the rapture
[1:23:31] message Christ does all three as he
[1:23:33] descends Christ gave the shout through
[1:23:36] brother Branham glory Christ is the
[1:23:39] voice of the Archangel whatever that is
[1:23:42] some people say it's going to be the
[1:23:44] bride column fourth rapture I don't know
[1:23:45] about that I'm not sure about that
[1:23:47] because Jesus is the one who called
[1:23:49] forth Lazarus from the grave it was
[1:23:51] Jesus so I'm not for sure
[1:23:54] really matter as long as I hear the
[1:23:55] voice right that's something to fight
[1:23:57] over fuss over start denomination over
[1:23:59] I just let's let it go which way it goes
[1:24:01] let's just hear the voice of Jesus he
[1:24:05] says the same voice that called Lazarus
[1:24:07] the trumpet he said is the voice of
[1:24:10] Christ and did you know you're here in a
[1:24:13] trumpet this morning how many knew that
[1:24:17] brother he's just he's just the pastor
[1:24:20] you know he's it's not me it's the word
[1:24:23] behind me is the voice of Christ today
[1:24:25] it's a trumpet cuz well Graham says that
[1:24:27] when the Bible comes the words of God
[1:24:30] every word is a trumpet brother Branham
[1:24:35] says every sound of the word is a
[1:24:39] trumpet
[1:24:40] he said the gospel trumpet and when it
[1:24:43] sounds it's the truth Oh hallelujah
[1:24:46] praise God I just wrote down on my sheet
[1:24:49] I'm so thankful I've been blowing this
[1:24:51] trumpet for 14 years and it hasn't as my
[1:24:54] trumpet it's the trumpet of the laird
[1:24:56] amen glory just trying to track some
[1:24:59] tension but see there's so many voices
[1:25:00] only the elected will hear the trumpet
[1:25:03] of God in this area amen
[1:25:06] that's fine if I preach 14 I think I can
[1:25:08] preach 14 more by God's grace every word
[1:25:12] of God motives that see there's nothing
[1:25:15] uncertain about this word that we're
[1:25:18] preaching he said there's nothing
[1:25:19] uncertain because if a trumpet blows if
[1:25:22] it's an uncertain sound you won't know
[1:25:23] what to do so he said God makes his word
[1:25:26] a trumpet a familiar sound and he said
[1:25:29] there's nothing unfamiliar about acts
[1:25:30] 2:38 ha oh yeah
[1:25:33] there's nothing uncertain about acts
[1:25:35] 2:38 hi there yet there's nothing
[1:25:38] uncertain about Hebrews 13:8
[1:25:40] there's nothing uncertain about
[1:25:42] revelation 10 7 Church are you asked me
[1:25:44] there's nothing uncertain how do you
[1:25:47] know because I know what this trumpet
[1:25:49] sounds like I know his voice amen
[1:25:51] it's a ward voice and it's got to be
[1:25:54] true to every word of God hallelujah
[1:25:56] that's exactly right
[1:25:59] well the man said sinner should repent
[1:26:01] after hearing this same voice he said
[1:26:04] the same trumpet tonight oh my
[1:26:08] Church this ought to make you rejoice to
[1:26:10] see the election of God today so many
[1:26:13] people have heard the preaching of the
[1:26:15] message but not everyone has repented
[1:26:17] what makes you different it's because
[1:26:20] God chose you in Christ from the
[1:26:22] foundation of the world God knew you God
[1:26:25] foreknew if she would do brother Ram
[1:26:27] tells us he foreknew you choose it's not
[1:26:29] like well I like Jesse more than this
[1:26:30] person or I like this person it wasn't
[1:26:32] that it was are gonna be our reaction
[1:26:35] what was gonna be our reaction where we
[1:26:37] gonna freely give Christ our love or we
[1:26:39] gonna love the things that the world and
[1:26:40] sellout Christ but God foreknew you
[1:26:43] would love him so he ordained you and
[1:26:45] chose you in his mind and then he made
[1:26:47] sure the word came to you praise God Oh
[1:26:49] glory everywhere it is a trumpet I know
[1:26:55] I was never good with instruments
[1:26:56] brother vang but it's good to know I've
[1:26:57] been blown a trumpet for 14 years that's
[1:27:00] pretty good to know every time I got you
[1:27:02] know it on the piano I was never any
[1:27:03] good you know and maybe didn't spend
[1:27:05] enough time there but one thing I know I
[1:27:07] can play a trumpet by God's grace
[1:27:09] because it's his trumpet now I'm not I'm
[1:27:11] just the one holding that praise God if
[1:27:13] it's his voice his word is trumpet I'm
[1:27:15] just holding it there I'm playing it for
[1:27:17] him glory okay so how I was feeling in
[1:27:22] my spirit I was missing something that's
[1:27:24] it all right let's go to chapter 2 I'm
[1:27:26] sorry verse 2 chapter 4 verse 2 you love
[1:27:31] the Lord amen we'll take a deep breath I
[1:27:34] got about 20 more minutes here I think I
[1:27:36] can do it by God's grace in Revelation 4
[1:27:38] verse 2 brings you kind of hard today so
[1:27:41] after I don't know I have to do come
[1:27:44] down maybe I don't know revelation 4
[1:27:46] verse 2 and immediately I was in the
[1:27:48] spirit and behold a throne was set in
[1:27:54] heaven and one sat on the throne so
[1:27:58] thought number four but RAM takes his
[1:28:00] thought up sorry of and immediately I
[1:28:03] was in the spirit but Ram said when you
[1:28:07] hear the voice of God something happens
[1:28:10] to you a church we gather every
[1:28:15] Wednesday every Sunday sometimes twice
[1:28:17] on Sunday if we're really hearing the
[1:28:19] Word of God something needs to happen to
[1:28:21] us
[1:28:22] or else we aren't hearing remember I
[1:28:25] preach out a few last year double of
[1:28:27] hearing we were the ones who gotta be
[1:28:29] careful we don't get dull ears because
[1:28:33] we've got the word of the hour
[1:28:34] we're not feeding on dead carcasses from
[1:28:37] Luther or Wesley's ager Azusa Street
[1:28:39] we're not feeding on those
[1:28:40] we're supposed to have fresh word right
[1:28:44] but if you hear if John heard the voice
[1:28:47] and immediately he got in the spirit
[1:28:49] then when we hear the voice of Christ we
[1:28:51] should immediately be in the spirit he
[1:28:55] says when you hear the voice of God
[1:28:56] something happens to you brother Graham
[1:28:58] said I heard the voice of God 33 years
[1:29:00] ago and I've never been the same since I
[1:29:03] heard it haha hallelujah I've heard the
[1:29:06] voice and I've gotten the spirit he said
[1:29:10] this is referring to the baptism of the
[1:29:11] Holy Ghost he said I was so torn up with
[1:29:16] the things of the world he said but
[1:29:17] Jesus give me the rest that he promised
[1:29:19] in Matthew chapter 11 come unto me all
[1:29:21] ye that are weary and heavy-laden
[1:29:23] and I'll give you rest for your souls I
[1:29:25] don't know about you but I don't feel
[1:29:27] any rest anywhere really
[1:29:29] except when I'm communing with the Lord
[1:29:31] praise God the only rest is when I'm in
[1:29:34] his presence or meditating and praying
[1:29:36] and and witnessing all these things when
[1:29:39] I'm aware of his presence if you're in
[1:29:41] the world and you're feeling nervous and
[1:29:43] and trials and all these things like
[1:29:45] that we've got to listen for the voice
[1:29:46] of God that will inspire us and
[1:29:49] immediately we'll be in the spirit we
[1:29:52] got to hear the voice and many times for
[1:29:55] me like I maybe this for you I don't
[1:29:56] know how it is for you I don't hear
[1:29:57] really voices what I do is I read the
[1:29:59] scripture then something just starts
[1:30:00] burning in my heart oh that's right many
[1:30:04] times like I forgot about that and the
[1:30:06] Bible said that you'll stir up your
[1:30:08] minds by way of remembrance sometimes
[1:30:12] it's something brand-new you know which
[1:30:14] is such a blessing hallelujah but it's
[1:30:16] like when I read the Bible and like this
[1:30:18] just this thing comes over me what is it
[1:30:20] it's that voice and it puts us in the
[1:30:22] Spirit of God amen you might get it
[1:30:25] through a dream though you might get it
[1:30:27] through the preaching of the word
[1:30:28] hopefully you do by God's grace amen
[1:30:31] but that's the thing to hear the voice
[1:30:33] stop this
[1:30:35] any other voice and hear the voice of
[1:30:37] Christ then you'll be in the spirit so
[1:30:42] the proper emphasize is that immediately
[1:30:44] you'll be in the spirit I better I gotta
[1:30:48] try to finish there something else I
[1:30:49] want to say about I need to finish this
[1:30:51] then maybe I'll say it tonight by God's
[1:30:52] grace or wait maybe Wednesday night
[1:30:54] thought number five one set on the
[1:30:57] throne but the RAM said that only one
[1:31:02] sat on the throne he said Jesus's body
[1:31:04] now sets there on the throne as a
[1:31:06] memorial and sacrifice Jesus was saying
[1:31:10] to John come up higher where I am
[1:31:13] because I've left the earth because it's
[1:31:16] time for the rapture and now one sits
[1:31:20] upon the throne in heaven aren't you
[1:31:22] glad - doesn't say three I've been
[1:31:25] reading that Purpose Driven Life book
[1:31:28] which has a lot of good things in it
[1:31:30] really tremendous book because it has a
[1:31:32] lot of Scripture as almost a thousand
[1:31:33] scriptures in it and I'm gonna I want to
[1:31:36] preach a series based off of that but do
[1:31:38] a message version of that because it's
[1:31:40] really powerful if you see that look at
[1:31:41] all the scriptures there and use brother
[1:31:42] Adam quotes you it's I think it'll be
[1:31:44] really powerful I know at least for me
[1:31:45] that's where I'm at right now I just
[1:31:48] want to watch I'm gonna make my calling
[1:31:50] and election sure I will know that I am
[1:31:52] here and I'm doing God's purpose not a
[1:31:55] selfish purpose but anyways he has a
[1:32:01] little chapter in there and say how God
[1:32:03] you know God God wasn't lonely before
[1:32:06] the foundation in the world because he
[1:32:07] had three people to talk to now that's
[1:32:11] not paganism Church I don't know what it
[1:32:12] is and he says Oh God wasn't lonely
[1:32:17] because he had through two other people
[1:32:19] to talk to you are you kidding me 33
[1:32:22] million people bought that book and I
[1:32:23] wonder how many swallowed it down but
[1:32:25] see we've got a thinking man's filter
[1:32:27] Amen I pour these contents of the filter
[1:32:30] that Trinity Dogma that that forsaken
[1:32:34] awful God dogma that doesn't make it
[1:32:37] through the filter of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:38] amen
[1:32:39] hallelujah so those things don't hurt me
[1:32:42] I can read a book that maybe isn't a
[1:32:44] message book and I can still pull out
[1:32:46] the good things because I've got a
[1:32:47] filter it's
[1:32:48] all the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:50] recently I was talking to a gentleman
[1:32:52] who was kind of upset with me for some
[1:32:54] things I said and I said every word
[1:32:57] brother Branham said is not thus saith
[1:32:58] the Lord he said well then how do you
[1:33:02] know I said I've got a thinking man's
[1:33:04] filter I said what about the program
[1:33:08] said the white horse rider right was
[1:33:10] where first Jesus and then it turns out
[1:33:12] thus saith the Lord it's Satan the
[1:33:14] Antichrist he said well how do you know
[1:33:17] so I just put those things upon a shelf
[1:33:19] I said yes when I understand I put up to
[1:33:20] the shelf but I said there's a gift
[1:33:23] inside of a preacher where the Bible
[1:33:25] says the preacher rightly divide the
[1:33:27] word of truth
[1:33:28] I don't interpret it the Prophet
[1:33:30] interpret it the answer was somewhere
[1:33:32] about the white horse rider the answer
[1:33:34] was in the sermons but it took the Holy
[1:33:36] Spirit to direct us to the word and the
[1:33:39] preachers rightly divide that word I'm
[1:33:42] not the interpreter the prophets the
[1:33:44] interpreter but the Holy Spirit is still
[1:33:47] speaking how do you know it's that same
[1:33:49] voice hallelujah
[1:33:50] it's a word voice and the brother just
[1:33:55] kind of shook his head like maybe didn't
[1:33:56] understand or maybe I couldn't live like
[1:33:57] that I've had numerous people kind of
[1:33:59] different with me even to the point of
[1:34:02] leaving the church at times you know
[1:34:04] where where they they just can't
[1:34:08] understand that we have to take
[1:34:10] everything brother Graham said back to
[1:34:12] the word I said with that you've got to
[1:34:14] be careful because there's a deity
[1:34:16] spirit behind that if you're not careful
[1:34:18] you make everywhere brother Branham said
[1:34:21] thus saith the Lord how do you know that
[1:34:23] still small voice you pray you wait on
[1:34:27] the Lord you know he's a man of God you
[1:34:29] know he's a prophet but even brother
[1:34:31] Branham said you've got to look in the
[1:34:33] Bible five if I make a mistake on tape
[1:34:35] he said go look in your Bible that's how
[1:34:39] you know but don't get me wrong I
[1:34:41] appreciate people that are respectful
[1:34:42] and they they just don't understand it
[1:34:45] or maybe they haven't studied but
[1:34:46] preachers study every single day they
[1:34:50] lay in the scripture because that's
[1:34:52] their job that's what the Bible said
[1:34:54] give yourself to studying amen give
[1:34:59] yourself to the ministry to doctrine
[1:35:02] hallelujah because the Bible said if you
[1:35:04] preach the right doctrine it'll save you
[1:35:06] and then that here you brother brother
[1:35:09] have said I heard it today or yesterday
[1:35:10] but never said any man that doesn't have
[1:35:12] a doctrine does not have a ministry is
[1:35:16] that right you've got if you're a
[1:35:18] preacher you've got to have doctrine
[1:35:20] because doctrine is instruction and what
[1:35:22] are we instructing on God's holy word we
[1:35:25] want to be instructed to how to hear the
[1:35:27] voice of the Holy Spirit how to get the
[1:35:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:30] I'll you have the power of God flow
[1:35:32] through our lives and our church and how
[1:35:34] to go to heaven in the rapture amen
[1:35:36] that's doctrine it's all doctrine
[1:35:38] because it's all teaching to the word we
[1:35:40] just need the spirit to make that real
[1:35:42] to us but every preachers got doctrine
[1:35:45] they can't say well he just preached a
[1:35:46] doctrine only yeah if you don't have the
[1:35:47] Holy Ghost
[1:35:48] he's just preaching doctrine only but if
[1:35:49] he's got the Holy Ghost he's preaching
[1:35:51] Holy Ghost doctrine haha exactly right
[1:35:54] amen
[1:35:55] oh so many critics but God help us to
[1:35:58] live above the critics he does Church he
[1:36:00] does he does amen
[1:36:05] one on the throne that's all he says he
[1:36:08] just says it about Jesus's body the body
[1:36:10] had now left the church ages the
[1:36:12] candlesticks and now that body is on the
[1:36:14] throne now thought number six John is
[1:36:22] now caught up in heaven brother Mannis
[1:36:27] let's see John again being taken up he's
[1:36:29] a type of the rapture of the New
[1:36:31] Testament church which we all know up
[1:36:36] into heaven just like Paul was brother
[1:36:39] victim says and he quotes 2nd
[1:36:41] Corinthians 12 where Paul was caught up
[1:36:44] into the third heaven and Paul though
[1:36:47] was forbidden to even talk about it can
[1:36:51] you imagine that you and I we may keep
[1:36:53] some secrets you know our whole lives
[1:36:54] but probably we talk about most secrets
[1:36:57] eventually with our you know closest
[1:36:59] people right our wives or spouses -
[1:37:01] right or your pastor you may say
[1:37:04] something your pastoring confidence or
[1:37:05] maybe your mother your father most of us
[1:37:08] are you know we're not going to take
[1:37:09] many secrets to the grave right but here
[1:37:12] in this case Paul and he even wrote
[1:37:14] almost the entire new test
[1:37:16] but he was able to keep those things
[1:37:18] that he saw the third heaven he was able
[1:37:20] to keep those secret this whole life he
[1:37:22] never told him he said what a difference
[1:37:24] Paul was confident heaven couldn't write
[1:37:27] about it couldn't even talk about it but
[1:37:29] John is given such a privilege brother
[1:37:31] Bantam said not only could he talk about
[1:37:33] it he was told to write about it he said
[1:37:36] write this down in the book and seven
[1:37:38] send it to the seven churches amen
[1:37:41] hi the seven to those seven churches
[1:37:43] you're going to be far privileged you're
[1:37:45] going to give me a privilege apostle to
[1:37:47] be able to see these things in heaven
[1:37:49] and church not only just the this was
[1:37:51] the very height of heaven this was the
[1:37:53] throne of God Amen you there's no higher
[1:37:57] heavens in this as far as I know is
[1:37:59] there so he's entitled to go to the
[1:38:03] highest of heavens this is the the very
[1:38:05] throne of Jesus Christ and not only see
[1:38:08] it but write about it
[1:38:10] amen John caught up into heaven church
[1:38:17] aren't you glad eleven of the Twelve
[1:38:21] Apostles as far as we know never got to
[1:38:25] read the book of Revelation only one of
[1:38:27] them did we are hearing things that
[1:38:31] Jesus's own apostles didn't get to hear
[1:38:34] the Bible said they're so beautiful the
[1:38:37] angels of God desired to look into these
[1:38:39] things these secrets in the mind of God
[1:38:42] we are such a blessed people god help us
[1:38:45] to get our thoughts off earthly things
[1:38:47] and set our affections on things above
[1:38:49] these things are so precious these
[1:38:52] things are so beautiful it's like a
[1:38:53] little heaven when we come to church
[1:38:55] here sorry but we got to be we got to be
[1:38:58] consumed by the realities of heaven the
[1:39:02] realities of the Word of God that's how
[1:39:08] I feel you know some people might say
[1:39:10] well you do a lot of teaching brother
[1:39:11] Jesse that's maybe the gift God gave me
[1:39:14] but listen according brother branham it
[1:39:17] takes me up into heaven a little bit are
[1:39:19] you up in having a little bit you know
[1:39:22] every church should be lifted up into
[1:39:24] heavenly places these things inspire us
[1:39:27] these are the real the things that are
[1:39:29] real
[1:39:30] the things that are not seen we got to
[1:39:32] stop looking at things we see and start
[1:39:34] looking at things we can't see praise
[1:39:36] God God's promises amen the future home
[1:39:39] the future the heavenly throne of God we
[1:39:42] got to set our affections on things
[1:39:43] above hallelujah
[1:39:52] caught up in heaven amen okay our last
[1:39:57] few thoughts I'm at the end you can
[1:39:59] never see that I'm at the end here I'll
[1:40:00] try to finish up here by God's grace
[1:40:02] thought number seven brother Ram says
[1:40:04] let's go on your Bible to Matthew 26
[1:40:06] 2016 28 forgive me Matthew 16:28 brother
[1:40:24] branham said he wanted to clear up an
[1:40:25] old hanger with this preaching so
[1:40:30] brother Graham said the preaching of
[1:40:32] revelation 4 verses 1 and 2 clears up
[1:40:36] the old hanger which is an old lie that
[1:40:40] Jesus didn't tell the truth for the RAM
[1:40:41] says so people unbelievers will look at
[1:40:45] Matthew 16:28 and say Jesus lied so
[1:40:49] let's read Matthew 16:28
[1:40:50] of course we know Jesus never lied he
[1:40:52] could not lie he was perfect he was God
[1:40:54] in flesh lived a sinless spotless life
[1:40:57] but he said that the old hanger that
[1:40:59] hangs around unbelievers verily I say
[1:41:02] unto you there be some here standing
[1:41:04] here which shall not taste death till
[1:41:07] they see the Son of man coming in his
[1:41:09] kingdom amen so brother Ram
[1:41:15] in the next chapter chapter 17 let's go
[1:41:19] down to verse 3 and behold there
[1:41:21] appeared in him Moses and Elias talking
[1:41:23] with him and now let's skip to down to
[1:41:30] verse 8 when they lifted up his eye
[1:41:32] their eyes they saw no man save Jesus
[1:41:35] only so you've probably heard this
[1:41:38] before
[1:41:38] but if not then it'd be fresh to you but
[1:41:42] brother Adam said see many people said
[1:41:44] Jesus made a mistake
[1:41:48] there's no nobody ever saw the kingdom
[1:41:50] of God and he lied and then they even
[1:41:54] quote let's go to john2112 let's read
[1:41:59] out one just cuz there they both tied
[1:42:01] together john2112 he said it's just a
[1:42:04] misunderstanding
[1:42:06] people misunderstand Jesus's words were
[1:42:12] 2112 and Jesus said I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:42:19] twenty-one twenty-two yeah sorry yeah I
[1:42:24] wrote that down mercy forgive me and
[1:42:26] Jesus say to him if I will that he tarry
[1:42:28] till i come what is that to thee follow
[1:42:30] thou me so in both cases Jesus gets
[1:42:34] misunderstood in this last case
[1:42:36] everybody thought John was gonna live to
[1:42:39] see the rapture and physically have a
[1:42:41] body change in other words go through
[1:42:43] the adoption because Paul said that was
[1:42:45] the adoption to wit the redemption of
[1:42:47] our bodies so the rapture is the as the
[1:42:50] final finality of the adoption it's the
[1:42:53] last part of the adoption is the actual
[1:42:55] body change but if you're born again the
[1:42:57] adoption has already started in your
[1:42:58] heart because it cries Abba Father God
[1:43:01] is my father God is my provider God is
[1:43:04] my caretaker God will take care of me
[1:43:06] amen hallelujah and you pray that prayer
[1:43:10] our Father who art in heaven you say
[1:43:12] thank God he's my father
[1:43:13] he's Laura's father he's Connie's father
[1:43:15] he's John's father he's all of our
[1:43:17] Father what a wonderful father we have
[1:43:19] amen that's the beginning of the
[1:43:23] adoption you're born again and you know
[1:43:25] I'm a son I'm a daughter and he's my
[1:43:27] father
[1:43:27] oh hi
[1:43:29] but see brother said there's an old
[1:43:31] hangar he said that Jesus they said
[1:43:34] Jesus lied that they never saw the Son
[1:43:37] of man coming in his kingdom and then
[1:43:39] brother Branham says but they actually
[1:43:41] did on Mount Transfiguration Peter James
[1:43:44] and John he said were called up he said
[1:43:48] and they saw he said he calls it a
[1:43:50] rehearsal of the end times right he said
[1:43:54] they thought they saw a rehearsal Jesus
[1:43:57] said some were standing here that will
[1:43:58] not taste death he says was this
[1:44:02] infallible brother Aaron said yes a few
[1:44:04] days later Peter James and John saw the
[1:44:07] Son of man coming in his power white
[1:44:11] hair right shining like the Sun his
[1:44:13] countenance was shining like the Sun
[1:44:15] pure white garments amen they saw the
[1:44:19] son of in other words they saw what
[1:44:20] Jesus is going to look like at the
[1:44:22] Battle of Armageddon when he's on a
[1:44:24] white horse and he's clothed and white
[1:44:26] and he's got a vesture of blood dipped
[1:44:28] on his thigh there hallelujah that's
[1:44:31] what he's going to look like the shining
[1:44:33] Sun and Jesus brother has said Jesus
[1:44:36] told the truth they saw the coming of
[1:44:38] the Son of Man by vision Oh hallelujah
[1:44:42] see the problem is they just don't ask
[1:44:44] enough questions
[1:44:45] they just jump to conclusions well Jesus
[1:44:47] said this had never happened you need to
[1:44:48] ask more questions is that right
[1:44:51] remember Caiaphas and Noah said well
[1:44:53] when is the prophet ever born in
[1:44:55] Nazareth we've looked in the scripture
[1:44:56] the Messiah was never to come out of
[1:44:58] Nazareth they didn't ask enough
[1:45:00] questions they never went up and asked
[1:45:02] Jesus said where were you born
[1:45:03] because he would have told them I was
[1:45:05] born in Bethlehem just like the Prophet
[1:45:07] said so see they jump to conclusions
[1:45:09] rather than searching the Scriptures
[1:45:11] amen so we've got a question we've not
[1:45:14] we get we can't jump to conclusions
[1:45:16] we've got to search it out and not be
[1:45:18] prideful and say well I've got the
[1:45:19] answer I know more about it this
[1:45:21] person's wrong we've got a home in
[1:45:23] ourselves ask more questions and search
[1:45:25] deeper in the matter it's exactly right
[1:45:27] so Peter James and John he goes on this
[1:45:33] thought of how Jesus's words were
[1:45:36] infallible program said not only did
[1:45:39] they see the rehearsal of the rapture he
[1:45:42] said they saw the issue
[1:45:43] the millennium as well Oh hallelujah
[1:45:46] but RAM said that he knew a type of this
[1:45:49] during his life he said when before
[1:45:51] Cecil DeMille put out the Ten
[1:45:53] Commandments he invited all Roberts and
[1:45:55] a bunch of preachers to preview the
[1:45:57] movie before it was released to the
[1:45:59] public
[1:46:00] Cecil DeMille won to make sure his movie
[1:46:03] was scriptural they did that recently
[1:46:05] with I think the passion and some of the
[1:46:07] other movies they invited some preachers
[1:46:08] in to see is this scriptural or not of
[1:46:12] course I was a Catholic version you know
[1:46:13] but well Graham said see it was a
[1:46:16] preview before it was made known to the
[1:46:18] public and brother Graham said that's
[1:46:20] exactly what happened on Mount
[1:46:21] Transfiguration it was a preview of what
[1:46:24] Jesus was gonna do before the public saw
[1:46:27] it amen
[1:46:29] and the thing is the public is gonna
[1:46:30] miss the rapture right they're gonna
[1:46:32] miss the Russian but they won't miss the
[1:46:34] Battle of Armageddon for every eye shall
[1:46:36] see him at that battle every eye
[1:46:39] they're gonna see that movie they're
[1:46:41] gonna see that rehearsal played out
[1:46:42] brother may have said Moses represented
[1:46:45] the dead New Testament Saints Elijah
[1:46:48] represented he said the quickened living
[1:46:51] Saints the translated raptured Saints
[1:46:53] who have a body change right Moses
[1:46:56] represent the dead in Christ but then
[1:46:58] Elijah represented those who are alive
[1:47:00] and remain and receive a body change on
[1:47:02] the earth amen hallelujah Claire said
[1:47:07] see how infallible Jesus's words are and
[1:47:10] John got to see the film of the rapture
[1:47:13] tribulation future home and then the
[1:47:15] rest of the book of Revelation he got to
[1:47:17] see all the end of the story so not only
[1:47:19] did John see our Mount Transfiguration
[1:47:21] he went out to Patmos and got the rest
[1:47:24] of it as well oh how good god is amen
[1:47:28] beautiful thank you lord
[1:47:32] last thought number eight I'm doing good
[1:47:34] on time great praise the Lord the last
[1:47:37] time a throne where the RAM said now
[1:47:39] this throne is no longer mercy this
[1:47:42] throne is judgment that's his last
[1:47:45] thought he uses he said Jesus now was
[1:47:48] sitting on that throne he was in his
[1:47:50] glory it was a throne of judgment the
[1:47:53] church age is finished because lightning
[1:47:57] thundering and voices all issued forth
[1:48:01] brother and quotes revelation 22 11 he
[1:48:05] that's holy let him be holy still he
[1:48:07] that's righteous let him be righteous
[1:48:09] still he that's filthy let him be filthy
[1:48:11] still he that's unholy let him be unholy
[1:48:14] still after the rapture how many know
[1:48:17] that's the state they remaining after
[1:48:19] the rapture that's the state they
[1:48:21] remaining there gonna be one of those
[1:48:24] that's exactly right
[1:48:26] brother BAM said God always spares the
[1:48:29] righteous before judgment always spares
[1:48:32] the righteous now if you got your Bibles
[1:48:34] go to Revelation 85 I just want to read
[1:48:36] these to you again because in Chapter
[1:48:38] yeah Revelation 85 is sin right yeah I
[1:48:43] want to read you these scriptures about
[1:48:45] the lightnings and thunderings it seems
[1:48:47] like it's all the one insane event
[1:48:55] okay revelation eight five now keep your
[1:48:58] spot there but in Revelation four or
[1:49:00] five is what I had up there right yeah
[1:49:02] revelation four five and out of the
[1:49:04] throne proceeded lightnings and
[1:49:05] thunderings and voices and there were
[1:49:07] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[1:49:09] throne which are the seven spirits of
[1:49:11] God God so loved the church ages and the
[1:49:14] messengers that he has a representation
[1:49:18] of the church ages and the messengers
[1:49:20] before him day and night that's how much
[1:49:23] God loves us Church you catch that he's
[1:49:26] got a fire there if there's one of seven
[1:49:28] fires and that's the fire for Laodicea
[1:49:30] and God as a memorial has that fire as a
[1:49:33] memorial that people have received his
[1:49:36] fire of love in their hearts I've got a
[1:49:39] people on the earth member heaviness
[1:49:41] through his throne earth is his
[1:49:42] footstool and he has a reminder there's
[1:49:44] some of those Saints in Akron they've
[1:49:46] got this same fire layer see a bride
[1:49:48] they've got that fire burning right now
[1:49:50] in their hearts amen hallelujah as a
[1:49:53] memorial before his throne that's how
[1:49:56] much he thinks of his Gentile wife
[1:49:58] hallelujah how they Lou you Jesus
[1:50:01] chapter 8 verse 5 chapter
[1:50:08] verse 5 you know this the seven seals
[1:50:09] open which I believe is the day a moment
[1:50:10] of the rapture
[1:50:11] after that the Angels get ready to sound
[1:50:13] the seven trumpets of wrath but look at
[1:50:17] verse five and the angel took the censer
[1:50:19] and filled it with fire of the altar
[1:50:20] cast into the earth and there were
[1:50:22] voices and thunderings and lightnings
[1:50:23] and an earthquake and the seven angels
[1:50:27] which had the seven trumpets prepared
[1:50:28] themselves to sound
[1:50:29] other madam said all seven of those
[1:50:31] trumpets sound in the tribulation from
[1:50:33] the two prophets how many know that all
[1:50:36] seven sound from the two prophets in
[1:50:38] revelation 11
[1:50:40] go to Revelation 11 19 after the second
[1:50:45] woe is spoken of in verse 14 Revelation
[1:50:49] 11:14 go down to Revelation 11 19 and
[1:50:51] the Temple of God was opened in heaven
[1:50:54] and there was seen in his temple the Ark
[1:50:55] of his Testament and there was
[1:50:57] lightnings voices thunderings and an
[1:51:00] earthquake and great hail look at all
[1:51:04] this activity going on in heaven because
[1:51:07] as now the blood they've rejected the
[1:51:08] blood and now this there's lightning and
[1:51:12] voices and thunderings does that remind
[1:51:14] you of something it remind you of Mount
[1:51:16] Sinai God was going to deal with the
[1:51:19] people one of the law right my wife and
[1:51:21] I were talking about that the people
[1:51:23] were going to take the law and they
[1:51:24] already going to read but when that even
[1:51:27] when the law came to them they'd already
[1:51:28] broken it before the law got there
[1:51:31] remember what was god of the mountain
[1:51:33] there was darkness and blackness and
[1:51:34] lightning that shows God's judgment not
[1:51:38] mercy God's judgment and now that he's
[1:51:40] taking his bride off the earth now
[1:51:42] heaven is filled with lightnings
[1:51:43] thunderings voices and the earthquake
[1:51:46] shakes the earth I wonder if that's the
[1:51:48] LA earthquake and this is after the two
[1:51:54] witnesses are now raptured up so the
[1:51:56] 144,000 would receive the Holy Ghost the
[1:51:58] two witnesses raptured up and now this
[1:52:02] lightning and thundering is going on in
[1:52:03] heaven
[1:52:04] it's purging time well it's the changing
[1:52:07] of dispensations any man it's almost the
[1:52:09] new day hallelujah last one revelation
[1:52:12] 16:18 a stand our feet revelation 16:18
[1:52:15] as you're standing
[1:52:24] revelation 16:18 now this is after the
[1:52:30] seventh and final vial seventh and final
[1:52:35] vial revelation 16:18 if you look at
[1:52:41] verse 17 it says in the seventh angel
[1:52:43] poured out his vial into the air and
[1:52:44] there came a great voice out the Temple
[1:52:46] of Heaven from the throne saying it is
[1:52:49] done and there were voices and thunders
[1:52:53] and lightning and there was a great
[1:52:55] earthquake such as was not since men
[1:52:57] were upon the earth so mighty an
[1:53:00] earthquake and so great look at 19 the
[1:53:05] great city Jerusalem divided into three
[1:53:07] parts and the cities of the nation's
[1:53:08] fell the great Babylon came in
[1:53:09] remembrance before God to give unto her
[1:53:11] the cup of the wine of the fierceness of
[1:53:13] his wrath the last Sunday we're out on
[1:53:17] that island at Catalina Island look at
[1:53:21] verse 20 and every island fled away and
[1:53:25] the mountains were not found those last
[1:53:29] time you drove by a mountain you just
[1:53:30] you stand in awe of it when this seventh
[1:53:32] vial pours out there's no more mountains
[1:53:36] islands there's no more islands because
[1:53:38] lightning thunder judgment the voice of
[1:53:41] God it's all gonna be washed away as
[1:53:43] beautiful as that island was as
[1:53:45] beautiful as mountains are because
[1:53:47] people have rejected the pressures and
[1:53:49] blood of Jesus Christ God said I've got
[1:53:51] to wash it all over again
[1:53:53] oh but by the grace of God you and I
[1:53:56] won't see that we'll be up there in
[1:53:58] heaven with God brother Louis if you'll
[1:54:05] come brother branham says we'll start
[1:54:08] with verse three he said next week
[1:54:12] brother Rams all
[1:54:13] their call was this and I would like you
[1:54:15] to just bow your heads if you would for
[1:54:16] a moment I'm miss who's the same where
[1:54:18] there was an altar call and nor does
[1:54:20] this have to be unless you feel led to
[1:54:21] come to the altar brother Graham said
[1:54:26] how many of you want to be summoned up
