[35:20] next 14 if he tarries you know I'll be
[35:22] 50 years old for many years it's hard to
[35:25] think of that that's anyhow I always
[35:28] felt like I'd be the young person I
[35:29] thought the rapture would come as I was
[35:30] young man you know we just don't know no
[35:33] Matt knows there they are but we'll give
[35:35] our whole life to Christ in relation to
[35:38] 24 we'll just read you know why don't we
[35:44] why don't we just go down to verse let's
[35:46] just look at the reward let's go down to
[35:50] verse 26 to the overcomer let's just
[35:53] read 26 and 27 the rest of that is
[35:57] pretty from there we've been preaching
[35:58] on that you know often on verse 26 let's
[36:02] read that together one two three and you
[36:05] can overcometh and keepeth my works unto
[36:08] the head they didn't would I get a power
[36:10] over the nation's let's pause right
[36:12] there what does he give the overcomer
[36:14] power over nations to rule over nations
[36:20] that is such an amazing promise doesn't
[36:24] that just make you feel little me I
[36:26] could be one that could rule over a
[36:28] nation a little minute that's the
[36:31] process the promise of God it will not
[36:33] fail let's read verse 27 one two three
[36:35] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[36:38] iron as the vessels of a Potter shall
[36:41] they be broken to shivers even as I
[36:44] receive my that's that one more word for
[36:46] every kid Heavenly Father we love you
[36:49] tonight Lord thank you for your mercy
[36:51] les is preaching without word and father
[36:54] help us to grow grace knowledge of you
[36:56] these church ages have meant so much to
[36:58] me more God they've shown me things in
[37:01] my life I needed to see they show me as
[37:04] you probably said the secret to serving
[37:06] Christ is to increase your service give
[37:09] more of yourself to Jesus as time goes
[37:12] on
[37:13] Lord it's discern things in the churches
[37:15] I know but I'm aware of you are so we
[37:18] thank you Lord in order to think that so
[37:21] much Lord you thought so much of this
[37:23] series in 1960 that you said unknown
[37:25] tongue after unknown tongue after
[37:27] prophecy after prophecy as you prophet
[37:30] preached these and then you ended it by
[37:32] sending down the pillar of fire in the
[37:34] tabernacle Lord God to vindicate the
[37:37] fact that you were interpreting this
[37:40] portion of Scripture to your bride nor
[37:43] it makes help me Lord Jesus the light I
[37:46] just pretty bless the Saints that came
[37:48] out that's those live streaming we all
[37:50] just came for one purpose the Lord let
[37:52] your word flow through us
[37:54] Lord leaders fear might flow through us
[37:56] and we might be true Christians and
[37:58] Jesus Christ every said god bless you
[38:01] see you there praise God
[38:11] so again we'll look at the RT of
[38:13] interchange I just said everybody know
[38:15] my family is at Lakeside it's near is
[38:19] near Kelly's Island it's like our
[38:21] vacation you know and sometimes I'll do
[38:23] that you know if we have three services
[38:26] every week times 52 weeks my maths right
[38:29] that's 156 services so one or two of
[38:32] them I let them stay you know just relax
[38:36] because they're so far away and plus
[38:39] we're planning on letting them stay and
[38:40] I was going to come back and preach but
[38:42] plus Karis is sick she was throwing up
[38:44] three times last night I was up from
[38:45] 3:00 a.m. till 6 a.m. I fell back asleep
[38:47] after that after everybody else got up
[38:49] but she's sick so we pray for her you
[38:51] know that God would keep her in touch
[38:53] that's where my family is at tonight and
[38:56] so I just want everybody know about that
[38:58] by the grace of the Lord I think that's
[39:01] all I want to say so let's look at this
[39:03] here again you know this is part 7 I
[39:05] like to finish in 7 7 is a good
[39:07] finishing number you know the seven days
[39:08] of creation seven churches and
[39:11] everything so and of course you know on
[39:13] this thought we've reviewed that quite
[39:15] often we call it where Columba is
[39:16] ministry there and let's begin here I'm
[39:22] going to look at tonight I'm going to
[39:23] look at the main part we're going to end
[39:26] with is the stars because because one of
[39:31] the reward was the star so he gives you
[39:34] the morning star that's verse 28
[39:36] actually didn't read that forgive me
[39:38] I'll read it that revelation 228 forgive
[39:40] me and I'll give him the morning star so
[39:44] we're in end with looking at some
[39:45] natural stars you know it in the stars
[39:47] in the Bible look at just a few facts
[39:50] about stars I'll tell you I started
[39:52] studying it it's way over my head okay I
[39:55] can't explain radiation I can't explain
[39:57] plasma I just I'm not there but we know
[40:01] the stars are real you know we know
[40:03] there's great facts about it but jesus
[40:05] said if you overcome Satan
[40:07] I'll give you the Morningstar who's the
[40:09] Morningstar Christ and I'm going to give
[40:11] you myself what a problem how many want
[40:14] that reward you get it but the Bible
[40:16] said in Revelation 21 he overcomes
[40:18] inherits all things you get every reward
[40:21] from every Church age if you overcome in
[40:23] your day hallelujah so that's what I
[40:26] serve the Lord
[40:27] I want to serve only be more like Christ
[40:28] and I want I want to glorify Him praise
[40:31] God I believe his promises are for us so
[40:35] the promise of those dark days so 20
[40:39] verses 24 and 25 that's why we didn't
[40:41] read it as I knew we'd read it here in
[40:42] the sermon Jesus says but I say to you
[40:44] and unto the rest of Thyatira as many as
[40:47] have not in this doctrine and which have
[40:49] not known the depths of Satan as they
[40:51] speak I will put upon you none other
[40:54] burden but that which you have already
[40:56] hold fast till I come program said now
[41:00] before we go to the promised let me show
[41:02] you again that the church has spoken up
[41:04] by the spirit in this book has two vines
[41:07] whose inter winding branches composed
[41:11] are actually speaking to two different
[41:14] churches in here right but as I say to
[41:17] you and unto the rest of Thyatira as
[41:19] many of us have not this doctrine what
[41:21] doctrine was of the doctor who Jezebel
[41:23] so we go back here look at that map
[41:26] again remember the spirit of Jessica the
[41:28] doctrine of Jezebel started taking over
[41:30] here it started off as just a saying you
[41:32] know and then it came into a doctorate
[41:35] then it came into the Pope and then it
[41:36] came into the Roman Catholic Church
[41:38] ruling here and they had the doctrine of
[41:39] Jezebel which was what a woman ruling
[41:43] over the church right in the case it was
[41:45] a false Antichrist fear it was the Roman
[41:48] Catholic Church it was human leadership
[41:50] it was Satan's leadership ruling over
[41:52] the people right that's what the spirit
[41:54] of Jezebel was we labored on that the
[41:57] woman the Roman Catholic Church
[41:59] dominated the church rather than the
[42:01] Holy Spirit dominating the church so
[42:04] that's what was happening here so let me
[42:05] skip back to where we were so he says
[42:09] but as I say to you it and on the rest
[42:11] of those in Thyatira as many as have not
[42:14] this doctrine see we don't have that
[42:15] doctrine here the Roman Catholic
[42:17] churches the denominations will not rule
[42:18] over us
[42:19] the word rules over us how many would
[42:22] say them were the word rules over you
[42:24] it's not the church bylaws you'll have
[42:27] to have those for legal purposes but
[42:28] that's not really what rules us it's the
[42:30] word praise God and a true church and we
[42:33] buy something the word that we've
[42:34] forgotten the bylaws we should put in
[42:36] the bylaws is it's just a it's just a
[42:39] way to govern the church you have to
[42:40] have that now bad except there it is
[42:43] Christ is speaking to the two groups one
[42:46] has the doctrine the other doesn't
[42:49] there they are scattered abroad across
[42:52] the nations with each one's doctrine
[42:55] opposing other one is of God knowing his
[42:59] depths the other is safety knowing the
[43:02] depths of Satan so did you catch that in
[43:05] verse 24 the true church does not know
[43:09] the depths of Satan
[43:10] the true church knows the depths of God
[43:13] praise the Lord and that's what he's
[43:16] saying here one has the depth of God the
[43:18] other has the depths of saints you'll
[43:20] see you're going to go deeper when one
[43:21] way or the other as we show it on Sunday
[43:23] you're going to get either closer to God
[43:25] or further away from God after this
[43:27] service right you learn one of the other
[43:29] we got to go deeper in Christ or deeper
[43:32] into sin what we want to go deeper in
[43:34] Christ amen and how we'll do that is by
[43:37] obeying the doctrine of Christ I want to
[43:40] drop us in here because to true doctrine
[43:43] is the same that is the Holy Spirit
[43:46] truth because the Holy Spirit is the
[43:49] Spirit of Truth so we have a true
[43:50] doctrine it has to be the true Holy
[43:53] Spirit teaching it right it has to be
[43:56] because the Bible's of the Holy Spirit
[43:58] is the Spirit of Truth if you teach true
[44:01] things then the true spirit must be
[44:03] behind that number brother Hamza that's
[44:05] one thing say you can't do he can't
[44:06] preach the word by word by word you
[44:09] can't preach a full true sermon right
[44:11] yet you can't live a full Christian life
[44:13] you get old true Christian doctrine but
[44:16] the power of God in us will accomplish
[44:18] that amen
[44:20] because remember it's more than just
[44:22] doctrine as more than just well cerfancy
[44:25] one God water baptism it's more than
[44:29] that right because those are all true
[44:32] things but you
[44:33] have the power behind that in other
[44:35] words you got to obey those things and
[44:37] then you got to be able to have faith in
[44:39] Christ and operate the power of God and
[44:41] once you have all that David head
[44:43] he got out of the word plus power and
[44:46] that's what they were astonished at
[44:47] Jesus when Jesus preached they were
[44:49] astonished at his teaching because his
[44:52] word was with power not only did he
[44:55] teach the right thing
[44:56] he had the power of God behind it hey
[44:58] hey right he had signs wonders and
[45:00] miracles so did Paul Paul smoked eel eel
[45:04] itis blind number that and they the
[45:08] Bible said the deputy looked at this
[45:09] when they saw what was done they were
[45:12] astonished at the doctrine of the Lord I
[45:14] didn't know God allowed this God would
[45:17] give a temporary judgment on somebody
[45:19] for trying to stop somebody else from
[45:20] here in the Word of God that's part of
[45:23] the doctrine of God in other words God
[45:25] gives temporary punishments upon people
[45:27] never seen it mother grandma gave an
[45:29] example he said if somebody runs from
[45:31] God they'll put them on their back in
[45:32] the hospital
[45:33] praise the Lord like I told a brother
[45:36] that recently left this church I said
[45:38] the reason you're having surgery is
[45:40] because you're running from God and he's
[45:44] laying he laid on his back in a hospital
[45:46] running from the Lord is that right
[45:48] that's the doctor that's the teaching if
[45:51] you don't run to God and you try to run
[45:54] away from God and if your God shouted
[45:55] he's going to come after you direct you
[45:57] right that's 1st Corinthians 5 right
[46:00] Paul said get that other church who's
[46:03] sleeping with his stepmother and give
[46:05] him over to Satan that his soul might be
[46:06] safe see that's the doctor to the Lord
[46:10] like I told you I teach a lot of
[46:12] doctrine but I know when people are
[46:15] hungry and pulling on the Word of God
[46:16] God does miracles I love that every time
[46:19] somebody needs something forgot it goes
[46:21] upon the preaching when I'm preaching
[46:22] God can help them amen
[46:25] I can show you the dates that happen
[46:26] because I read right now the servant
[46:28] days would be what a testimony I could I
[46:30] can show you the days that people pull
[46:32] the healing out of the Holy Spirit
[46:34] through a Kip and so for you you can go
[46:37] back and say well this is when God
[46:38] touches me this is when God healed me
[46:40] some of God saved me and you go back and
[46:42] show and the Holy Spirit
[46:43] when you're pulling upon the Word of God
[46:45] and that's what we're talking about now
[46:51] we read this a few weeks ago
[46:53] although Timothy take heed to yourself
[46:55] so what is your life creature that's
[46:57] what I try to do watch your life take
[46:59] heed watch yourself and unto the doctor
[47:01] be careful what you teach continue in
[47:03] them for in doing this thou shalt both
[47:05] save thyself and then the early that's
[47:08] why I cried out to God before I preached
[47:11] to you because I want to be saved and I
[47:13] want you to be saying whatever church
[47:16] you go to God leads away from here you
[47:18] want a feature that will preach
[47:20] something that will save them and save
[47:22] you nice and Lord because your Shepherd
[47:25] is going to lead you one way or the
[47:26] other deeper into God or deeper to Satan
[47:28] that right that's what's going to happen
[47:30] it's going to happen because the word
[47:32] doctor means instruction or learning we
[47:35] have to come to church to learn
[47:36] something praise God
[47:38] and even if it's just one thing praise
[47:40] the Lord because you've all gone to
[47:41] classes where you didn't learn a whole
[47:42] lot in that class but if you got one
[47:44] thing on that class wasn't worth it
[47:46] absolutely that's right because remember
[47:50] this is you know you can learn something
[47:51] to remember Jesus had to teaches
[47:54] disciples the doctrine of prayer and
[47:56] fasting for miracles he said howbeit
[47:59] this kind goeth this Devils these Devils
[48:01] don't go out but by prayer and fasting
[48:04] so see there's doctor that will help us
[48:07] to do miracles how many believe that
[48:08] that's why doctors are born we got to
[48:11] teach well this is the kind of situation
[48:13] we need a pass and pray and I met her
[48:15] church I remember fasted and prayed and
[48:18] then Christopher was healed just I think
[48:19] a month after that - we came here with
[48:22] prayer and fasting in that church of you
[48:23] well last year and just wasn't a matter
[48:26] I've been you know II told brother Jose
[48:28] remember the Samuel Boavista pray forth
[48:30] Jose brother Jose sent me the printout
[48:32] from the doctors statement saying that
[48:34] he has no more cancer that was a few
[48:37] months if everybody got forgot the dead
[48:38] government we prayed and fasted and God
[48:41] healed the boy and they sent the picture
[48:43] he said the Jose said that they sent it
[48:46] to him
[48:46] he said to me CY doctrine is so far you
[48:50] have to teach people how to get the
[48:52] channel the Holy Spirit and then wait
[48:55] upon God till he does it and praise the
[49:00] Lord let me just make something in here
[49:03] I just you know this okay to me you know
[49:07] something I just mentioned a little
[49:08] earlier you know this thought kind of
[49:09] came to me if we're not getting much out
[49:14] of church services there's something we
[49:15] can do about that let me give you let me
[49:20] give you a type when you eat every meal
[49:24] does it have to be a brand new food
[49:26] you've never eaten before does it have
[49:30] to be yeah no I think the same thing
[49:32] almost every week and I love it this is
[49:36] where you'll receive your natural diet
[49:38] because as a pastor you know I know a
[49:41] lot of those things keep coming up over
[49:44] and over the services but Church how is
[49:46] God going to lead us into algebra if we
[49:49] don't all do the ABCs I want to go
[49:53] deeper in Christ I'm going but we've got
[49:55] to obey the ABCs first to get through
[49:59] the algebra understand that so so does
[50:02] four servings I feel like the Holy
[50:03] Spirit like as I prayed every set was
[50:06] every Saturday for services and this is
[50:08] what the Lord places of all my heart I'm
[50:10] preaching this what brother Branham said
[50:11] I'm trying to teach what just for
[50:12] brother Graham say but if it feels like
[50:15] it's not fresher and new then you have
[50:17] to take the tight to the natural well
[50:20] I'm tired of the same food at home if
[50:22] all you have is broccoli every Tuesday
[50:24] night oh we only have fish and Roxy
[50:26] every Wednesday night if you're hungry
[50:30] it doesn't matter you're happy to eat it
[50:32] and brothers you better be your wife
[50:35] you'll be kind of disappointed in your
[50:36] head it might hurt her feelings well
[50:38] Friday night pizza night oh well we had
[50:41] pizza last party but if you're hungry it
[50:43] doesn't matter and so see that's the
[50:46] thing
[50:46] let me come to church and we hear the
[50:50] same thing or it feels like there's
[50:51] nothing new then we got to be careful
[50:53] are we feed on why are we hungry for the
[50:57] word of God maybe it's because we're
[50:59] other things we shouldn't be feeding up
[51:01] sometimes I would sometimes out of my
[51:04] fast food on the way home I was really
[51:05] hungry and I come to suffer and my wife
[51:07] would say why aren't you hungry
[51:09] i slaved over the you know that she
[51:11] wouldn't say that but she didn't slave
[51:13] over the food in the kitchen why I was
[51:16] not hungry because I ate something else
[51:19] are you understand so people go to
[51:21] church and they're not hungry for the
[51:23] preacher why because they're feeding on
[51:24] other things they're watching like a
[51:27] brother told me a good testimony said
[51:28] brother Jeff since I did this now he did
[51:31] this he did a huge sacrifice for the
[51:33] penal got recently I'm not going to tell
[51:35] you you might be able figure it out but
[51:37] a brother gave a huge sacrifice for the
[51:39] kingdom of God I'm talking about
[51:39] thousand dollars and lots of time and he
[51:44] come back and said brother Jesse I've
[51:45] been on a cloud nine sins he said I've
[51:47] only watched two videos on YouTube the
[51:49] last two or three weeks so what was he
[51:52] telling me he was telling me before that
[51:54] sacrifice he was spending too much time
[51:57] on YouTube and then she said hey man so
[52:04] see he's feeding on that but then when
[52:07] he gets away from that sacrifice and
[52:09] dedicates all this time to God and
[52:11] really gets into a chair the Holy Spirit
[52:13] that was not being on that any morning
[52:15] the words become more alive that help
[52:18] hope that helps you that helps me that's
[52:20] why I wrote it down here because I was
[52:21] praying here I know let me make sure I
[52:23] see that so I can eat the same thing
[52:25] every Monday I could have this every
[52:27] morning I can have a bowl of granola and
[52:29] yogurt I'm as happy as a lark I'm just a
[52:32] happiest guy because I'm hungry for it
[52:34] I've developed a taste for it and if
[52:36] you've developed a taste for this
[52:37] message you're hungry for it a night the
[52:40] word is that right that's right and so
[52:45] see we've got to take that approach know
[52:47] what we say what you know so Jessie
[52:49] teach a lot of doctor what that but the
[52:51] doctrine is so you can understand the
[52:53] things of God and you can start and we
[52:55] can all start operating more in it don't
[52:57] want I bring more net absolutely praise
[52:59] God so I just want to lay that out there
[53:03] that'd just give that testimony see the
[53:06] Word of God is fresh into just if we're
[53:08] only feeding on that but if we snack on
[53:11] things of the world
[53:12] won't taste so good right so we don't
[53:15] want to do that so that's one lay that
[53:18] in there by God's grace now but man
[53:20] moves on to this Jesus says out put upon
[53:22] you no other burden
[53:24] remember the burden was to just work
[53:26] more work for Jesus that was the burden
[53:28] of Thyatira just work more you're the Ox
[53:30] anointing number just labor just give
[53:32] yourself as a sacrifice just give more
[53:34] to Christ motor Adam says that the word
[53:36] for burdens weight or pressure the
[53:38] pressure of the Dark Ages or Thyatira
[53:40] was either bend or be broken but out to
[53:45] the Catholic Church or die
[53:46] it was the Inquisition the power of the
[53:49] Empire backing up satanic worship be
[53:52] organized or pay with your life each a
[53:55] each had its pressures now program stops
[53:58] there that's the pressure of Thyatira
[53:59] now the yellow here he goes into our
[54:01] pressure
[54:02] remember our pressure just as they had
[54:05] the pressure you either join our church
[54:07] or die our pressure is this right here
[54:10] the pressure of riches you better make
[54:14] more money you better get rich you
[54:15] better that's the same question so just
[54:18] just never got the pressure but we both
[54:20] have pressure soft living all you have
[54:23] to sacrifice so let's just take it easy
[54:26] don't pass and pray it don't get more
[54:28] time to God
[54:29] just relax rest I don't get me wrong we
[54:31] all need rest and if not you're going to
[54:33] going to have a heart attack
[54:34] look I'm warning people don't go too
[54:37] hard you're gonna have a heart attack so
[54:39] if you like your health suffer and you
[54:40] need to rest more what if it just well
[54:43] you know you have to do that if you got
[54:46] plenty energy but you're not doing some
[54:48] for God and we're living too soft and
[54:50] the third thing is nervous tension Saint
[54:53] wants to make us so nervous you got a
[54:54] battle that constantly nervousness
[54:57] attention got do this and got it that
[54:59] got do that well right now said these
[55:02] are our pressures in a complex age that
[55:05] we seem unfitted to live in so true this
[55:09] for age seems to have had a clear-cut
[55:11] burden it was to defy Rome stand up for
[55:14] the word even in the Dead Sea that was
[55:17] their burn defy Rome what's our burden
[55:19] defy riches defy soft living defy
[55:24] tension I won't be nervous why because
[55:26] price is giving me peace a that we were
[55:29] there at Lake area now there's a sign
[55:30] they put up and said what does peace
[55:32] mean to you and some people wrote all
[55:34] vacations and sunsets and parents in
[55:37] love and I wrote peace has a name Jesus
[55:39] Christ
[55:41] what does peace mean to you Christ a
[55:43] yeah so see Saint wants it make us
[55:46] nervous and oh you gotta do this go do
[55:48] that let me tell you something to give
[55:50] you let me remind you the secret pray
[55:52] before you start your dad put everything
[55:54] in prayer say God I hope you get that
[55:56] everything I need to get done I know
[55:58] you'll do it pray before here to watch
[56:00] God bring everything to pass and and
[56:03] this is I've had more responsibility as
[56:06] time has gone on first I was just pastor
[56:09] and so first I was just pastor and
[56:12] Sunday School was superintendent and
[56:13] trustee now about that I'm song leader
[56:16] treasurer and deacon and church and I'm
[56:21] plus I got more kids right and I got
[56:24] more jobs as scrum not only do I teach I
[56:27] got to do a CTA rep I got in other
[56:29] things I got Bible club on top of that
[56:31] and I just had more and more
[56:33] responsibilities what's the heat of that
[56:35] how do you balance everything prayer but
[56:38] Branson Martin Luther as time went on he
[56:40] had more jobs and more responsibilities
[56:42] the way he had everything was praying
[56:44] more amen if you have more job you need
[56:48] more prayer amen that's the only way
[56:51] people how do you handle that brother
[56:53] someone's brother left a note on there
[56:54] how do you handle it's like you have to
[56:56] do everything to the terms how do you
[56:57] handle that and I just say it just God's
[56:58] grace but prayers the key because we'll
[57:02] all have heard is we all have nervous
[57:03] but we have a choice we can either
[57:05] become nervous or we can have peace
[57:07] about it a maid that Christ will help me
[57:09] so listen church here's our three Rick
[57:12] pressures these are legacy of pressures
[57:15] soft living riches and nervous you but
[57:17] here is three sides that you're hot for
[57:19] Christ member that is three Senate so
[57:21] there's three tensions but there's three
[57:22] sides you're hot
[57:23] what is it a passion to know the word
[57:26] the second thing a fervent desire I just
[57:29] want to please God and the third they
[57:31] reach out and cry out for things in the
[57:33] spirit all God do signs wonders and
[57:34] miracles
[57:35] use me for your kingdom help me to win
[57:37] souls amen hoping to be led by the Holy
[57:40] Spirit so see prayer prayers and all
[57:42] he's coming to church you know reading
[57:44] your Bible just these simple things if
[57:46] we do the simple things as they taught
[57:48] these things will feel like the burdens
[57:50] happening and Jesus will break those
[57:53] feathers hey that isn't set here there
[57:54] hallelujah he'll break those fetters
[57:57] that's right amen church alright let's
[58:02] keep going here now Jesus says they have
[58:04] not known the depths of Satan so the
[58:06] true church does not know the depths of
[58:08] Satan
[58:09] Clarett makes this comment it seems that
[58:12] this verse has been left out by the
[58:14] commentators for they were not able to
[58:16] figure out what doctrine or what
[58:18] experiences are meant by this phrase
[58:19] actually it is simple to know what is
[58:22] meant
[58:23] let us first know what the depth of God
[58:26] is and the opposite will be true for the
[58:28] depth of Satan so by the RAM gives us
[58:31] the scripture for the depth of God
[58:32] there's action scriptures that says what
[58:34] the depth of God it is you want to see
[58:36] it it's Ephesians 3:16 if you don't want
[58:38] you I'm gonna show it to you I know you
[58:41] want to do Ephesians 3:16 is the depths
[58:44] of God here's here's what a depth of God
[58:46] is that he would grant to you accorded
[58:48] the riches of his glory to be
[58:50] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[58:53] the inner man so what is being deep in
[58:56] God having God's strength inside of you
[58:59] amen
[59:00] just going inward with God's strength in
[59:02] you gon know yo coming over coming to
[59:05] church whatever God's going to the
[59:07] grocery store go in there with the
[59:09] strength of God that is the depths of
[59:12] God that Christ may dwell in your hearts
[59:15] by fate so what is it how do you go
[59:17] deeper in God letting more of him and
[59:19] live in you having them always on your
[59:21] heart always have his words on and songs
[59:23] upon your lips and all these things
[59:25] that's the depth of body that being
[59:30] rooted and grounded in love so you're
[59:33] just so as the best iPhone app said what
[59:34] evidence all the ghost is being so in
[59:36] love for God you just want to do
[59:38] something for God a man you may be able
[59:40] to comprehend with All Saints what is
[59:43] the breadth length and depth and height
[59:45] and to know the love of Christ which
[59:47] passes knowledge that
[59:49] you might be filled with all the
[59:51] fullness of God so this is a death of
[59:53] God just keeping Christ on your lips
[59:55] having a strong inner inner being you
[59:58] know having the Holy Spirit in you so
[1:00:01] you're ready to talk to it someone who
[1:00:03] doesn't know about God you know I've had
[1:00:05] a lot of times with family this weekend
[1:00:06] they've asked you about different things
[1:00:07] I'm able to say well we follow brother
[1:00:09] Rams message I've been able to share
[1:00:11] that with them and just ready to share
[1:00:13] it my god that's great so I'm prayed up
[1:00:15] I'm studied up I can't wait for the
[1:00:17] nasty praise God anybody able to say
[1:00:19] that with the family members you know
[1:00:20] he's from Jefferson deal and prophet and
[1:00:23] all these things you know and so we want
[1:00:26] to have that fullness in us so we see
[1:00:29] you know we we pray and we're always
[1:00:31] we're ready to give an answer for the
[1:00:33] hope that life is entertainment
[1:00:34] 1st Peter 3:15 says that now according
[1:00:38] to these verses when a man experiences
[1:00:40] the death of God in his life it is an
[1:00:43] actual personal experience of the Spirit
[1:00:45] of God indwelling him and his mind is
[1:00:50] illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge
[1:00:51] of God through the word but the death of
[1:00:55] Satan will be in that he will attempt to
[1:00:58] destroy this so now know the depth of
[1:01:01] God is of the Satanism depth of God is
[1:01:03] having a personal experience
[1:01:04] Oh crisis with you all the time you're
[1:01:06] ready to you know you're fully anointed
[1:01:08] you know you're on fire the depth of
[1:01:10] Satan is he tries to destroy that and it
[1:01:13] seems like God's far away and I can't do
[1:01:15] nothing for God you ever been there
[1:01:16] never been battled you know he says he's
[1:01:20] tried to defeat you
[1:01:22] my man says Satan will always attempt to
[1:01:25] make a substitute for the reality of God
[1:01:27] I don't care about my life you ever get
[1:01:29] yourself down on that thought we always
[1:01:32] battled my buddy right we always thought
[1:01:33] that he don't care about you oh gods
[1:01:36] don't do nothing in your life God I want
[1:01:38] to use is there even a God say get
[1:01:40] behind me Satan Manny the Word of God is
[1:01:43] true amen
[1:01:44] he's a reality but only if I don't feel
[1:01:47] to our life and I'm going to press it
[1:01:48] until I've you freeze to the heart
[1:01:50] because I know it's a reality how does
[1:01:53] they do it you will take away the
[1:01:55] knowledge of the truth of God destroy
[1:01:58] the word by putting forth his own yeah
[1:02:00] I've gotten
[1:02:01] are you sure there's going to be a
[1:02:03] rapture are you sure mother Brenda was a
[1:02:06] prophet are you sure that was thus saith
[1:02:08] the Lord see how he does that he's
[1:02:10] always making him doubt the promises of
[1:02:12] God right he will then substitute the
[1:02:15] personal Christ in our myths in church
[1:02:18] when those times what you must you do
[1:02:20] but Graham said just be like Jesus go
[1:02:22] back to the word it is written it is
[1:02:25] written the biggest Christian when he
[1:02:26] falls to his knees and hopes the Word of
[1:02:28] God can defeat Satan at any time any
[1:02:30] place at any moment a man just go to the
[1:02:33] word go to your prayer and quote the
[1:02:35] Word of God and watch God's word for
[1:02:36] bail amen another guy I'll just be
[1:02:41] honest you over an hour ago
[1:02:42] Lake Erie there's all kinds of women
[1:02:43] robbed walk around all kind of in
[1:02:45] modesty and I've been such victory by
[1:02:47] just put my head down and say Lord Jesus
[1:02:49] on to say something just go to the
[1:02:51] scripture I know you're watching me and
[1:02:53] my heart is going to be pure before yay
[1:02:55] men and I'm going to get the victory
[1:02:57] praise guy got an act that actively say
[1:03:00] those things up so what about I'm
[1:03:02] walking in the depths of God passing on
[1:03:05] any petty should end abomination that's
[1:03:07] why I hate more weather sometimes much
[1:03:08] something hate as I don't like to if I
[1:03:11] don't like to go certain places with the
[1:03:12] weather's hot I like hot weather I don't
[1:03:15] like to snow so much but I got it we got
[1:03:18] all going to be careful then have
[1:03:19] certain battles women have other battles
[1:03:20] and how do we overcome it by not
[1:03:23] doubting the word putting our full
[1:03:24] confidence in the Word of God he's my
[1:03:27] strength thing bet he will do it as he
[1:03:31] calls Israel to the same by human being
[1:03:34] reigning as king instead of God this is
[1:03:36] Sadie saying we'll let a human reign
[1:03:38] over the people rather than Christ
[1:03:40] now here's what I was going to get to on
[1:03:42] Sunday I never got his remember when I
[1:03:44] mentioned this on Sunday here are
[1:03:45] Satan's biggest deception the born-again
[1:03:48] experience will be rejected in vain for
[1:03:50] a church joint that is Satan's biggest
[1:03:54] deception he lets people join the
[1:03:57] churches but they're not born again and
[1:04:00] they go further than the depths of Satan
[1:04:03] rather going in the onus of the Deaf's
[1:04:04] of God well how do you know what we have
[1:04:07] to come to church right because I preach
[1:04:08] all the time while the Bible preaches it
[1:04:09] all the time Jesus preached it all the
[1:04:12] time that was his example always going
[1:04:14] to church but you see he wanted to go to
[1:04:18] church but not go deeper in Christ but
[1:04:20] see we got to go to church and go deeper
[1:04:23] in Christ and it's going to take what a
[1:04:25] reality it's going to take passing down
[1:04:27] anything that would keep us from our
[1:04:29] first love we've got to keep all that
[1:04:31] sin up and then we'll go deeper in
[1:04:32] Christ get stronger in Christ it's
[1:04:34] exactly right the depths of Satan had
[1:04:37] been entered into in that age and the
[1:04:40] fruit of that death of Satan which our
[1:04:41] lives murders and horrible crimes came
[1:04:44] forth from it see that's my turn I can
[1:04:48] look at my life and I know I've been
[1:04:49] pastoring here 11 years I can look back
[1:04:51] over 11 years and I can see God is
[1:04:54] taking me deeper in him because I don't
[1:04:56] see these things I don't see lies
[1:04:57] murders it even spiritualize it and even
[1:05:00] spiritual murders and horrible crimes I
[1:05:02] don't see that my life I see fruit of
[1:05:04] the Spirit I see patients I see
[1:05:06] forgiveness I see long-suffering I see
[1:05:09] love and power see that's what we must
[1:05:13] Steve we must look at our lives and say
[1:05:15] my very good fruit of the Spirit or not
[1:05:16] god help us to bear the rice banana and
[1:05:19] this should be the birth of every
[1:05:21] message church do we have born-again
[1:05:23] experiences or just church joiners
[1:05:26] that's what we need me the board again
[1:05:28] extremes nice job on the do you amen now
[1:05:35] let's look at the rewards here I got a
[1:05:37] few more but I got more in a few I got
[1:05:40] about 24 sighs well some of them go
[1:05:43] faster than others like some of them are
[1:05:44] just visuals of stars
[1:05:45] I just wanted and the solar system in
[1:05:47] the galaxy I just want to again show
[1:05:49] this just to give us an idea of how
[1:05:51] great God is
[1:05:52] now the rewards we read this earlier Eve
[1:05:54] overcometh and keepeth my works to the
[1:05:56] end to him when I get a power of the
[1:05:58] nations now we preach on that a few
[1:06:00] weeks ago remember my dear son I know
[1:06:02] thy works for that boat you were here
[1:06:03] you guys were like you I ended that
[1:06:08] sermon by showing out Milgram said if we
[1:06:11] do God's works for the end will rule
[1:06:13] over nations so I've already kind of
[1:06:15] showed that reward so I'm not going to
[1:06:17] later on that so much because we've
[1:06:19] already showed that those that do the
[1:06:21] works of God
[1:06:22] than the faith of God and therein the
[1:06:23] bride of God and they live in the at
[1:06:26] holy city the future home that's right
[1:06:28] and they sit on Christ seat in judgment
[1:06:31] as well
[1:06:32] amen now he says that he shall rule them
[1:06:35] with a rod of iron as the vessels of a
[1:06:38] Potter shall they be broken to shivers
[1:06:41] even as I received of my father and I
[1:06:44] will give him the morning star he that
[1:06:47] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:06:49] saith others that finishes the chapter
[1:06:51] and now we're to go to the church age
[1:06:53] book comments on this okay then we're
[1:06:55] going to close the stars from the Bible
[1:06:56] we'll look at some scriptures on the
[1:06:58] stars now I think you'll be blessed I
[1:06:59] was so stirred up by looking at those
[1:07:01] scriptures about mine am I really a
[1:07:03] sorry I believe I am a pain by the moon
[1:07:06] as well yes I'm the mood but I'm also
[1:07:08] sorry see because you can fit both types
[1:07:11] we'll look at that just a moment the
[1:07:14] moon represents the church right and the
[1:07:16] stars represent believers so you have
[1:07:19] both your bold types so we get to that
[1:07:22] I'm going to close with that he that
[1:07:24] overcometh and keepeth my works to the
[1:07:26] end
[1:07:26] Aram said it's very evident from the
[1:07:28] remarks of the sphere on works that the
[1:07:31] Lord is trying to get his own to see his
[1:07:33] opinion of righteous works four times he
[1:07:36] mentioned work so does God now he works
[1:07:37] yes God wants to see us doing righteous
[1:07:40] works and now he says that he who keeps
[1:07:44] doing his works faithfully until the end
[1:07:46] will be giving power over the nation's
[1:07:49] and will be a strong capable unbending
[1:07:53] ruler who can code so powerfully listen
[1:07:56] it with any situation you get in other
[1:07:59] words you can handle any situation that
[1:08:01] comes your way no matter who comes to
[1:08:03] rebuke you
[1:08:03] no matter who comes to correct you no
[1:08:05] matter who comes to cut you out no
[1:08:06] matter who comes to tell you lie about
[1:08:08] you or make you look evil you can stand
[1:08:10] out on the word and handle any situation
[1:08:12] by the Holy Spirit ah that's what I want
[1:08:15] right here
[1:08:15] I want the character of Christ to handle
[1:08:18] any situation that even the most
[1:08:22] desperate enemy will be broken if you
[1:08:24] need me so see if you keep Jesus said if
[1:08:27] you keep my words to the end you'll be
[1:08:29] like a ruler who breaks all their
[1:08:31] enemies in
[1:08:33] with a rod of iron a head look at that
[1:08:36] hallelujah so see this is quite a
[1:08:41] statement Jesus says the works you have
[1:08:43] to overcome by doing the works now can I
[1:08:46] take this one moment here let me I was
[1:08:48] working on this sermon and I didn't get
[1:08:50] to about an ellipse let me just go down
[1:08:52] to smooth over these real quick I got to
[1:08:56] a lot of works for women this week
[1:08:57] number I was preaching on I know that
[1:08:59] works here some works for our sisters
[1:09:03] doing alms deeds like selling coats and
[1:09:06] garments for people God recognize that
[1:09:08] as a woman doing a good work modest
[1:09:11] clothing is a works for women that's a
[1:09:13] work they do
[1:09:14] shame face of this like humility
[1:09:17] sobriety's stayin sober you know no
[1:09:20] serious and focused on the Lord not
[1:09:22] silliness childbearing silent learning
[1:09:25] that's a word for God when our sister
[1:09:27] sits there silently learns and doesn't
[1:09:29] try to free them which nobody does in
[1:09:31] our church we're dead but with that full
[1:09:34] subjection to husbands the Bible said
[1:09:36] his good work that's a good work hide it
[1:09:39] to get home keeping the home a real holy
[1:09:41] place that's a work of a sister so
[1:09:43] sisters say well I don't do nothing for
[1:09:45] God but if you're doing this if you're
[1:09:47] creating a rather atmosphere at home
[1:09:48] you're working for God it's not going to
[1:09:51] get to this but I want to drop it in
[1:09:53] here to encourage our sisters tonight
[1:09:54] I'm requiring there I'm sorry requiring
[1:09:58] their parents I'm sorry never quote that
[1:10:00] well I didn't look that up so I spelled
[1:10:03] that wrong and I didn't look it up so
[1:10:04] forgive me I don't have that
[1:10:05] supplications and prayers Nate and I
[1:10:08] still pray every day pray every night
[1:10:10] bring up your a sugar knowledge of the
[1:10:12] Lord Lodge strangers now a woman can
[1:10:14] only do that you know if her husband was
[1:10:16] there
[1:10:17] we don't have male/female alone right or
[1:10:22] like brother Graham's mother member she
[1:10:24] she turned her house into a boarding
[1:10:26] house or in other words a motel when a
[1:10:29] Charles died so see she would have rooms
[1:10:32] that had locks on the door so she she
[1:10:34] had her own room locked yourself in
[1:10:36] there you know at nighttime and then men
[1:10:38] would stay at her house and rent it out
[1:10:40] like a you know like a hotel I won't
[1:10:43] work something if it a wash
[1:10:47] the Saints D how many systems do that
[1:10:48] you see that's that's a good work that's
[1:10:52] why we need to do communion pretty soon
[1:10:53] it's been well I think Easter was last
[1:10:54] time do communion let me do that again
[1:10:55] by God's grace relieved the afflicted
[1:10:58] anytime our sisters are see someone
[1:11:01] who's afflicted and going through a hard
[1:11:02] time if you try to bring any relief to
[1:11:04] them you've done a good work and then
[1:11:08] guide the house that kind of goes with
[1:11:10] your piety at home things like that and
[1:11:12] brothers I didn't get a whole lot of
[1:11:14] time to go through those but there's a
[1:11:15] lot of works for meto and preaching
[1:11:17] loving their wives not provoking the
[1:11:19] children providing for your own family
[1:11:21] so you go to work that's a good work to
[1:11:22] do but God you know that there's more
[1:11:25] examples I didn't get to and then
[1:11:26] there's works for everybody like if you
[1:11:27] clothe the naked or if you feed those
[1:11:30] who don't have daily food those are
[1:11:31] works Jay said that's that's more that's
[1:11:33] faith in action when you help somebody
[1:11:35] out so male or female helping our people
[1:11:38] is a good word for God and Jesus said if
[1:11:40] you do this to the end you'll rule over
[1:11:42] Nations hey you think we should not take
[1:11:46] these things lightly because if we do
[1:11:48] these things I'm talking about a page to
[1:11:50] I'm talking about all these other you
[1:11:51] know keeping the whole just we wouldn't
[1:11:53] say simple things but if we do that he
[1:11:56] makes us rule over nations all right
[1:11:58] what a promise Church right remember
[1:12:00] Anna she ministered in Temple my prayers
[1:12:02] and fasting I didn't get to those but if
[1:12:05] we look at the sinful works we'll know
[1:12:06] what the opposite is like keeping your
[1:12:08] body pure from any sexual sin or death
[1:12:11] that's another work a good work of God
[1:12:13] worshiping in the spirit and truth you
[1:12:15] know able from blood came raw fruits and
[1:12:18] what does that represent today you must
[1:12:20] bring the Holy Ghost worship right the
[1:12:22] life of God we must operate fruits
[1:12:25] that's not something that doesn't have
[1:12:26] life in it we must our worship must have
[1:12:28] life in it but what's that
[1:12:31] we want our hearts must be burden for
[1:12:32] the word glory and if we're rich which
[1:12:36] is all of America Church which is all of
[1:12:38] us we must have a portion of our money
[1:12:40] that we set aside to give to the poor
[1:12:42] maybe do it through your offerings maybe
[1:12:44] you know but those that are rich in the
[1:12:47] world must be ready to distribute Paul
[1:12:50] told Timothy he says all those rich
[1:12:52] people they got to be ready to
[1:12:53] distribute so we're all rich here we are
[1:12:55] we're all rich whether we like it or not
[1:12:58] get out compared to the rest of the
[1:12:59] world
[1:13:00] so is that not by God's grace like I
[1:13:02] said I need to go through all the men
[1:13:03] works for our men here I sure got to go
[1:13:06] through the sisters oh that helps our
[1:13:08] sisters tonight by God's grace oh come
[1:13:11] on kid open that you're joking
[1:13:14] I try this yeah the trouble earlier I'm
[1:13:19] not surely still no oh come on
[1:13:23] tell me about tribal of another one here
[1:13:26] and then see that little bit of it
[1:13:27] all right praise the Lord amen amen
[1:13:30] forgive me yeah now I want to bring this
[1:13:35] point out to you member this club let me
[1:13:37] have said none this is not the church
[1:13:38] ages this is perfect faith he says
[1:13:40] perfect faith is a master of all
[1:13:42] circumstances now the reason I brought
[1:13:45] us focus brother Graham said when you're
[1:13:47] really anointed you can hit you can cope
[1:13:49] with any situation
[1:13:50] you're not scared anybody comes up to
[1:13:52] you and bring up your passion Jesse I
[1:13:53] read when you did this in high school
[1:13:55] you can stand there and say that's the
[1:13:56] old me that's not the new Jesse that's
[1:13:59] the old dead man that's the sinner Jesse
[1:14:02] not on the saint amen amen
[1:14:04] I brought it up because he said we have
[1:14:06] to be able to handle every circumstance
[1:14:08] brother have says perfect faith is the
[1:14:10] master of all circumstances what's faith
[1:14:14] face faith is the evidence of things not
[1:14:16] see it's a substance of things not seen
[1:14:20] so what is a holy spirit perfect faith
[1:14:23] masters all circumstances programs it no
[1:14:26] matter what it is a masters it now just
[1:14:28] watch when you believe anything you
[1:14:30] anything that you got faith in what
[1:14:31] you're doing no matter what the
[1:14:32] circumstances that don't have one thing
[1:14:34] to do with it see a masters that
[1:14:36] circumstance if it's in a room of
[1:14:37] sickness and the Lord's reveal that this
[1:14:39] certain things going to happen you just
[1:14:40] speak it and go on now I put a note here
[1:14:44] now notice Romans 7 19 st. Paul did not
[1:14:48] master every circumstance but the faith
[1:14:51] of Christ in him did so should I mean in
[1:14:54] other words we are going to fail in
[1:14:55] certain circumstances but faith will try
[1:14:59] us or faith will strike us for the next
[1:15:01] time and the next time we can be a
[1:15:03] master that circumvent every single
[1:15:05] before like for example when I first got
[1:15:08] hired and teeth to teach I was real real
[1:15:10] nervous around my principles
[1:15:12] would it witness very much but after a
[1:15:14] few years after a few failures I'll be
[1:15:16] honest I'd ask God to forgive me I
[1:15:17] didn't stand up from things I was real
[1:15:19] nervous you know just real nervous
[1:15:21] after a few years I remember my second
[1:15:24] principal I walked in the office one
[1:15:26] time and he pulled out it was 2011 I
[1:15:29] remember that he put up a website and
[1:15:31] he's on the website it did you know the
[1:15:32] world is going to end tomorrow cool and
[1:15:35] Saturday was that old man made the
[1:15:38] prediction that the world was going to
[1:15:39] head on that Saturday 2011 you probably
[1:15:41] member that yeah I forget his name he
[1:15:43] died now which I'm not surprised because
[1:15:46] he used the name of Lord and predicted
[1:15:47] the end of the world and did happen and
[1:15:50] he missed it twice hit remember his
[1:15:52] name's Emily remember his name okay
[1:15:56] remember his anyways he predicted
[1:15:58] that in the world and my principal was a
[1:16:00] homosexual and I knew it but let me show
[1:16:04] you I was ashamed before my old boss
[1:16:07] because I was young but I failed but God
[1:16:10] gave me Burton faith so he said you know
[1:16:12] the world's going to end tomorrow and I
[1:16:13] looked right at him and I said no sir
[1:16:14] it's not going to end tomorrow I said
[1:16:17] you know why because the Bible said you
[1:16:19] should not fear any man who makes a
[1:16:21] prediction in the name of Lord and it
[1:16:23] doesn't come to pass and this man has
[1:16:25] already predicted that in the world and
[1:16:26] it failed and the Bible said that you
[1:16:29] should not fear him it's not going to
[1:16:31] end tomorrow amen
[1:16:33] now a few years before by the Amen I
[1:16:36] would not have been able to say that but
[1:16:38] my boss was in there open homosexual
[1:16:41] there I am quoting the Word of God to it
[1:16:43] hey man what masters that circumstance I
[1:16:45] did shy words and what about them is he
[1:16:48] later so I can talk about things of God
[1:16:50] you're homosexual ops I want to bed you
[1:16:52] I stood right here on the word what was
[1:16:55] it it was faith and her buffet masters
[1:16:58] that situation you know he such a
[1:17:00] sentence it um interesting and that was
[1:17:03] it but see I just stood there and now
[1:17:07] notice even if we never talked about it
[1:17:09] afterwards but the point is the next day
[1:17:11] came and he had to admit Jesse was right
[1:17:14] about that right because he prophesied
[1:17:18] the name of Lord and it didn't go the
[1:17:20] best and this is on that day God answer
[1:17:22] for that that was one time I
[1:17:25] a believer spoke the word to him and he
[1:17:27] should recognize that's the Spirit of
[1:17:29] Truth and he could have submitted that
[1:17:32] he could salt for more of that right
[1:17:34] because he saw the Word of God in action
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:38] I like that and I didn't play to say
[1:17:40] that that just Haiti need always hear
[1:17:41] about that to me because before I'd be
[1:17:43] scared to witness to my principal but
[1:17:45] give me a few years give me some time in
[1:17:47] prayer and watch perfect bathing master
[1:17:49] every circumstance they met all said
[1:17:52] there are things when I want to do good
[1:17:54] I get people so there's times that we
[1:17:57] will fail because we are not the master
[1:18:00] of every circumstance faith is the
[1:18:02] master of every circumstance Christ is
[1:18:04] the master of every circumstance then
[1:18:06] Christ in us
[1:18:07] masters every circumstance Amen I just
[1:18:11] want to make sure I've differentiate
[1:18:12] that because every time you just think
[1:18:14] well I'm the master you'll fail and
[1:18:16] you'll maybe start doubting this close
[1:18:18] you always have this quote you have to
[1:18:20] know it's not me it's Christ in me amen
[1:18:23] now rotor I'll get back to this stuff
[1:18:25] about how will rule over nations he says
[1:18:27] the believers demonstration of rule by
[1:18:31] power will be like unto the very sons in
[1:18:34] other words we don't rule like Christ's
[1:18:36] rule he's God this Laurentian is very
[1:18:39] amazing I read this on Sunday if you
[1:18:42] remember that this is going to be very
[1:18:44] amazing when God's children can rule
[1:18:47] like Jesus did on earth when we can
[1:18:50] master every situation like Jesus did
[1:18:54] he's a man that that will be very
[1:18:57] amazing
[1:18:58] so when religious people come and give
[1:19:00] you questions about the Bible and not
[1:19:02] the fart wonder Jesus didn't shy away
[1:19:07] what'd he do
[1:19:08] sometimes he would question what what
[1:19:09] what do you say about it right and he
[1:19:13] never said well we believe John the
[1:19:15] Baptist or not you know but you know the
[1:19:17] Scriptures I'm talking about of it
[1:19:19] sometimes he answered their questions
[1:19:21] with questions sometimes he just told
[1:19:23] them the truth from the beginning it was
[1:19:25] not so about marriage and divorce so see
[1:19:29] he mastered every circumstance so we
[1:19:32] have to see our lives becoming more like
[1:19:34] Christ when were confronted when we have
[1:19:36] you know battles with unbelievers or
[1:19:38] religious people we must see ourselves
[1:19:40] getting the victory praise God which is
[1:19:42] just as simplest standing and not
[1:19:45] bending not compromising on what we
[1:19:47] believe praise God
[1:19:49] not compromising on what we believe
[1:19:51] that's standing on the word raise God
[1:19:56] hope that makes sense our power must be
[1:19:59] just like the sons we must overcome
[1:20:02] every detractor every deceiver every
[1:20:06] deceiver men every false preacher
[1:20:08] whoever it is we must overcome that amen
[1:20:12] now it was on but let us look at this
[1:20:15] promise in the light of the age powerful
[1:20:20] role mistake back in and joining I'm
[1:20:22] sorry employ two kings and armies and
[1:20:24] legislators breaks and grinds all before
[1:20:25] it she's killed millions and hungers to
[1:20:28] kill millions more who will not bow to
[1:20:29] her she entirely sets up kings or brings
[1:20:33] them below whenever she can yeah or gay
[1:20:35] her interference has actually caused
[1:20:37] nations to fall because she has
[1:20:39] determined to destroy the elect of God
[1:20:40] this is all what Satan did during the
[1:20:43] fire to church each her works are the
[1:20:45] worst the devil for she murders and lies
[1:20:48] as did he but there is coming a day
[1:20:50] where the Lord is going to say bring
[1:20:52] these my enemies the forum meet and slay
[1:20:56] them now let's turn their booklet we're
[1:21:00] not hearing the whole parable but this
[1:21:02] parable is very much similar to Matthew
[1:21:04] 25 in the parable of the five teams
[1:21:06] remember that parable let's go to Luke
[1:21:09] 19 I just want to show this real quick
[1:21:10] this really bless my heart and I won't I
[1:21:12] won't linger on this like I said I won't
[1:21:13] think around this one I hope you let it
[1:21:15] preach the whole thing tonight I know
[1:21:17] that to why I preach the old very well
[1:21:18] but not tonight
[1:21:19] if you let him do that tonight now in
[1:21:23] Luke 19:11 227 we have the parable it's
[1:21:26] a very similar parable to the parable
[1:21:28] talents I want you to see this year
[1:21:35] let's look at verse 15 and it came to
[1:21:38] pass that when he was returned having
[1:21:39] received the kingdom then he could
[1:21:41] commanded these servants to be called in
[1:21:43] to him to whom he had given the money
[1:21:44] that they might know how much every man
[1:21:47] had gained by training
[1:21:49] the very similar thing Jesus goes away
[1:21:51] he left them with money then he comes
[1:21:53] back later so what'd you do with my
[1:21:54] money
[1:21:54] right Jesus left and he gave us what he
[1:21:58] gave us gifts he gave us actual money
[1:22:00] too
[1:22:01] you know he gave us all these resources
[1:22:03] he's going to come back to say what'd
[1:22:05] you do with it what I do is it what you
[1:22:07] do is look at the hood he answers he
[1:22:09] look at verse 16 then came the first
[1:22:11] saying lord I have gained ten pounds by
[1:22:13] a tenfold increase that's a pretty good
[1:22:17] increase I'm not a financial guy but
[1:22:19] that's pretty good verse 17 he says he
[1:22:22] said to him well now good servant
[1:22:25] because thou has been faithful in a very
[1:22:26] little have valid or T over ten one sees
[1:22:31] remember rule over nations here this
[1:22:33] rule over cities I can't imagine that
[1:22:37] church I don't know
[1:22:38] I can hardly rule on finances you know
[1:22:40] sometimes I wonder about that how has
[1:22:42] God let me rule
[1:22:43] I always gave my tithes and offerings
[1:22:44] you know I try to get all to try to
[1:22:46] these things but it seems like I never
[1:22:49] get where I want to get you know
[1:22:51] understand what I'm saying if you know
[1:22:55] hi I'm trouble if I have to nervous
[1:22:57] about this how could I will over ten
[1:22:59] cities but jesus said if you're faithful
[1:23:00] with your finances
[1:23:02] paid with our talents you'll rule over
[1:23:03] cities not just cities but those cities
[1:23:06] must be part of nations that's right now
[1:23:10] you know the next one right verse 18 and
[1:23:12] the second came saying Lord I found a
[1:23:14] paid five pounds and he said likewise
[1:23:16] then behold also the over five cities so
[1:23:22] see it's the same kind of thing as the
[1:23:23] parable of five talents if you're
[1:23:27] faithful what it gives you it makes you
[1:23:28] will over much now the last person was
[1:23:31] the faithful you know Jesus says come
[1:23:32] you'll slay them things like that so
[1:23:34] does everybody see how that connects to
[1:23:35] that tonight if you're if you do the
[1:23:37] worst of God he'll make you rule over
[1:23:39] nations right and here's another example
[1:23:40] if you're faithful with what God gives
[1:23:42] you the rule over cities now those are
[1:23:45] red-letter eternal words I believe it
[1:23:48] madam says that's what is happening here
[1:23:51] at the church age then shall the
[1:23:54] righteous be with their Lord when his
[1:23:56] righteous indignation will fall upon the
[1:23:58] blasphemers the righteous coming with
[1:24:00] him in glory shall destroy the
[1:24:02] who destroyed the earth and made havoc
[1:24:04] on the saints of God this was the age of
[1:24:07] turning the chief of terrible distress
[1:24:09] but a day is coming with true shocker
[1:24:11] male and who shall stand it inspired me
[1:24:13] safe only the redeemed of the Lord
[1:24:16] Hey now here's I want to get you this
[1:24:18] one we can do and I want to try finished
[1:24:20] about 10 minutes over and I will give
[1:24:23] him the morning star
[1:24:24] oh here's the reward keep working for
[1:24:28] Jesus keep working for Jesus and the
[1:24:30] reward is the morning star to rule and
[1:24:33] I'm giving you the morning star
[1:24:35] according to revelation 22:16 2nd Peter
[1:24:38] 1:19 Jesus is the morning star the
[1:24:43] spirit therefore is making a promise to
[1:24:45] the elect of the Dark Ages relative to
[1:24:47] himself and then in the ages to come and
[1:24:51] we've already stated Jesus identifies
[1:24:53] himself with the messengers of each age
[1:24:55] they receive from him the revelation of
[1:24:57] the word for his period this word
[1:24:59] revelation reigns the elect of God out
[1:25:02] of the world and into full union with
[1:25:04] Jesus Christ now how you feel I know
[1:25:06] that's happened to me I was I started
[1:25:08] the world and I didn't draw out of the
[1:25:10] room and I'm brought into the fullness
[1:25:12] of Christ how do I know it's happened to
[1:25:15] be I used to never love Church I hated
[1:25:17] turns I hated any of these things I hate
[1:25:20] the sake of my life but now I love of a
[1:25:21] man a man I know is happy to be Church
[1:25:24] these messengers are called stars
[1:25:26] because they shine with a borrowed light
[1:25:29] or reflected light of the Sun even Jesus
[1:25:33] see the messengers were just stars like
[1:25:36] Jesus
[1:25:37] they're also called stars because they
[1:25:40] are holders of the light at night thus
[1:25:42] and the darkness of sin they bring the
[1:25:44] light of God to his people
[1:25:47] hello this is the Dark Ages it is
[1:25:51] especially dark for the word of the Lord
[1:25:52] is almost entirely hidden from the
[1:25:54] people now is your the most high is
[1:25:56] almost ceased death has overcome vast
[1:25:58] numbers of the believers until their
[1:26:00] ranks are decimated so there's very few
[1:26:02] Christians the things of God at the
[1:26:04] lowest add to this state and it seemed
[1:26:06] this second would surely conquer God's
[1:26:08] people now look at some of this if ever
[1:26:12] of people needed a promised embrace
[1:26:16] in the land where there is no night it
[1:26:18] was the people of the Dark Ages and that
[1:26:21] is why the sphere is promising them the
[1:26:24] Morningstar
[1:26:25] ha and that a beautiful there the
[1:26:27] darkest of all ages so Jesus gives us
[1:26:29] the bow so if you live for me I'll give
[1:26:32] you the morning side because it's so
[1:26:35] dark I'll give you the brightest thing
[1:26:37] there is I'll give you my life amen
[1:26:39] he's telling that that the Chiefs are
[1:26:42] even Jesus who twelve and light under
[1:26:45] which no man can approach will in the
[1:26:47] future Kingdom illuminate them by his
[1:26:50] own personal presence he would not be
[1:26:53] using the Stars or messengers that give
[1:26:55] light in the darkness any longer it will
[1:26:58] only it will be Jesus himself speaking
[1:27:00] of face to face as he shares his kingdom
[1:27:03] with them so did you guess that
[1:27:05] after we get new bodies and every gold
[1:27:07] the millennium and into the future hope
[1:27:10] we're not gonna need the seven
[1:27:11] messengers anymore because Christ is the
[1:27:13] light but right now we need the light
[1:27:16] the brother Adam rose because Christ
[1:27:19] Himself isn't here we need that we need
[1:27:21] that seven star don't we need to listen
[1:27:24] those things we may hear brother branham
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:26] that's why we must not worship brother
[1:27:28] Branham or any other man in the blood of
[1:27:31] the future Oh God will not use brother
[1:27:33] Graham to be a light like he did when
[1:27:35] brother Brandon was upon the earth
[1:27:36] Christ will be the light once Jesus
[1:27:40] arrives will not need the messengers
[1:27:42] anymore because we will be changed into
[1:27:44] a mortal being but until then we need
[1:27:47] the light of brother ends message got to
[1:27:49] keep going back to the message whatever
[1:27:51] Graham say what the messengers say why
[1:27:52] is he's God's car is an amen amen
[1:27:56] hallelujah now getting back to the quote
[1:28:00] here's her program finishes it and I'm
[1:28:02] going to starzone be brief on them it is
[1:28:05] the morning started it's visible by the
[1:28:07] light of the Sun commences to shine when
[1:28:10] our Sun Jesus comes there will be no
[1:28:12] further need of messengers he will bring
[1:28:16] us his message of cheer himself and as
[1:28:19] he rules his kingdom and we live in his
[1:28:21] presence the light of the word will
[1:28:23] become brighter and brighter in our
[1:28:24] perfect day what else could we desire
[1:28:27] above Jesus himself well
[1:28:30] or to me what brother and sister the
[1:28:33] only reward we want is Jesus hey man why
[1:28:35] because he is the light he said he's
[1:28:37] like she's everything is that he
[1:28:40] everything even perfect everything amen
[1:28:43] he hath an ear let him hear what the
[1:28:45] spirit stayed to the churches amen even
[1:28:47] so Lord God by thy spirit let us hear
[1:28:50] thy truth you know church for years I
[1:28:53] was raised in church for years I heard
[1:28:55] preaching about streets of gold and it
[1:28:56] never did anything to me to me for years
[1:29:00] I heard preaching about mansions I don't
[1:29:02] care I've never made nothing to me I
[1:29:04] didn't care about the mansions I don't
[1:29:05] care I have the smallest house I don't
[1:29:08] care what it is I just want to see Jesus
[1:29:10] amen he's the one that died for me I
[1:29:13] don't really I mean we want to hurt her
[1:29:14] worse but we just do them because we
[1:29:16] love the Lord again those things have
[1:29:19] never met no a goal that's as clear as a
[1:29:22] crystal glass city you know as gold as
[1:29:25] clear as a crystal of that we can't
[1:29:26] explain that I don't even care about
[1:29:29] that I just want to see the nail prints
[1:29:31] in his hand a man I want to see the the
[1:29:35] prints in his feet I would have CD web I
[1:29:37] don't ask him you know all the questions
[1:29:39] I've had praise God and I would hear his
[1:29:41] answers hey head and I want to worship
[1:29:44] Him and just lay his feet and throw my
[1:29:46] crown at his feet say thank you you're
[1:29:47] the one that helped you overcome it hey
[1:29:49] what's your shred that help me earth
[1:29:51] this problem only through you I could do
[1:29:53] the same thing you see that so we won't
[1:29:58] get brother branham once we get new body
[1:29:59] change but until then we need his
[1:30:01] message image was the doctrine of God
[1:30:04] amen the doctrine of God now let's close
[1:30:10] the stars here what is a star now this
[1:30:12] is the things I can't explain all the
[1:30:14] way so you have to bear with me of stars
[1:30:16] any massive self luminous celestial body
[1:30:20] of gas that shines by radiation derived
[1:30:25] from its internal energy sources of the
[1:30:30] tens of billions of trillions of stars
[1:30:33] composing the observable universe only a
[1:30:35] very small percentage or visible to the
[1:30:37] naked eye you can't even see we can't
[1:30:40] even see very little fraction
[1:30:42] so what's a star a star has energy
[1:30:45] inside itself that burns on its own and
[1:30:48] that's why I want to tie the gear it has
[1:30:50] its own energy it doesn't get energy
[1:30:53] from anything else it's got its own
[1:30:54] energy praise God and that's what we're
[1:30:58] supposed to be stars burning with our
[1:31:01] own energy I don't have you amen that's
[1:31:04] enough you're right not to get an idea
[1:31:06] here I just want to get you an idea of
[1:31:07] the galaxies again so you can start
[1:31:09] understanding this here's the earth the
[1:31:12] earth is a part of our solar system
[1:31:14] right the solar system is a part of this
[1:31:16] Milky Way galaxy the Milky Way galaxy is
[1:31:20] part of a local group of galaxies a
[1:31:23] local group of galaxies is a part of a
[1:31:25] local supercluster and thus there's many
[1:31:28] super clusters in the known universe
[1:31:31] billions and trillions of stars and
[1:31:36] jesus said I'll give you the morning
[1:31:39] star if you overcome I will give you the
[1:31:43] morning star I'll give you an
[1:31:45] illuminating light I'll give you a
[1:31:47] burning energy that will be beyond
[1:31:50] anything you could ask her thing amen
[1:31:53] I'll be what is that that's eternal life
[1:31:55] amen exactly right just to give you a
[1:31:58] thought on this we see part of the Milky
[1:32:03] Way from Earth we can see this galaxy
[1:32:06] that we're living and this was taken in
[1:32:08] Yosemite National Park in California you
[1:32:10] ever go there bad you're Ontario since
[1:32:12] the origin okay you did no kidding
[1:32:15] Gloria there's times of the year where
[1:32:18] you can see part of that and help you a
[1:32:20] galaxy right than that that's what you
[1:32:24] see just weren't just up we're just up
[1:32:25] speck in that spiral ring out so we go
[1:32:28] back weird so part of that this is what
[1:32:32] we saw part of this we're right here but
[1:32:34] we can see part of that just in
[1:32:35] California you can see that because of
[1:32:40] the glory of God now this is an RVT can
[1:32:42] do it justice neither can you I mean
[1:32:43] your computer they can look pretty good
[1:32:44] on your computer man but this TV can't
[1:32:47] give justice it must be an old model but
[1:32:49] it's so glorious I mean the star such a
[1:32:53] this source of strength now the the
[1:32:56] Britannica says the Sun is the star on
[1:32:59] which the earth and other components of
[1:33:01] the sources are involved it is the
[1:33:03] dominant body of the system constituting
[1:33:06] more than 99% of its entire mass in
[1:33:09] sources of the Sun is the source of an
[1:33:11] enormous amount of energy a portion
[1:33:15] which provides earth with the light and
[1:33:17] heat necessary to support life now did
[1:33:19] you know a solar system all stays intact
[1:33:22] by the pull of the Sun understand that
[1:33:26] the Sun goes on all the planets right
[1:33:30] and that's called the gravitational pull
[1:33:31] so the Sun is pulling all of all the
[1:33:35] parts of the solar system it's keeping
[1:33:37] them in place because the Sun is falling
[1:33:39] on them who's pulling on you to come to
[1:33:42] church tonight amen who's pulling on you
[1:33:44] to keep your prayer life and I we've got
[1:33:46] it's the Sun it's Christ a to heaven if
[1:33:49] you didn't have that pull you would just
[1:33:51] fly further away from the Sun right the
[1:33:53] earth pfeiffer the rate of the Sun and
[1:33:55] everything would die I say thank God
[1:33:58] that I feel the polling and see what
[1:34:01] people wander away from church it's very
[1:34:04] serious wonder away from God they eat
[1:34:08] cold on God and they left their
[1:34:11] god-given position wondering listen that
[1:34:13] this is the greatest better and father
[1:34:14] listened to today well Graham said but
[1:34:18] when everybody stays in their position
[1:34:19] like our solar system he said what do
[1:34:21] you have you have a solar system you
[1:34:22] have a New Testament church that's why I
[1:34:25] begin to all get into our position and
[1:34:26] stay right where God wants us and stay
[1:34:29] attracted to the Sun we can see more of
[1:34:30] God aim ahead we've seen God is able you
[1:34:33] see God he listen but we can see more of
[1:34:35] God if we can just get into position but
[1:34:39] see he's pulling on me praise God
[1:34:42] the sun's radius I'm just going to blow
[1:34:45] your mind away with just like my mind
[1:34:47] was blown away miles really the sun's
[1:34:49] radius is a hundred times the 109 times
[1:34:51] that of Earth here's the radius from the
[1:34:53] center to the outward circumference of
[1:34:55] the body the sons of ass is 330 thousand
[1:35:00] times out of earth the mass is just
[1:35:02] amount of matter that something has the
[1:35:05] average distance from the
[1:35:06] - the Sun is 93 million miles because
[1:35:08] sometimes it gets closer to the Sun
[1:35:09] right when it's in its orbit you know
[1:35:11] sometimes it gets so closer sometimes
[1:35:12] they'll further away so the average
[1:35:13] distance 93 million miles ah the sun's
[1:35:18] light travels at 183 thousand miles per
[1:35:21] second you know how many miles it is
[1:35:24] around the around the earth over five
[1:35:26] thousand if you go around the earth one
[1:35:28] time you've only traveled about 5,000
[1:35:30] miles
[1:35:31] praise the Lord but light travels 183
[1:35:36] miles per second that's the power of the
[1:35:39] lighting of the Sun and it takes eight
[1:35:42] minutes for the light to reach the Earth
[1:35:43] from 93 million miles away and Jesus
[1:35:47] says I'm the morning star I'm this one
[1:35:50] giving out the light I'm the one that
[1:35:52] can cross this distance in no time and
[1:35:54] even just like those three Hebrew
[1:35:55] children right but Christ shut down and
[1:35:57] said no Gabriel this is a god-sized job
[1:36:00] I'm going down there to stand with those
[1:36:02] three Hebrew children why did he cross
[1:36:04] all time and eternity and comes down and
[1:36:06] stand amidst the fire don't you know God
[1:36:08] wants to do that for us tonight even if
[1:36:10] it's to come into our lives in our
[1:36:12] situation and he present with us here
[1:36:14] tonight hey then because he could go so
[1:36:16] fast a minute we just must believe his
[1:36:19] promise so here's the here's the earth
[1:36:22] in comparison to the Sun I will read one
[1:36:26] time you can fit a million earths inside
[1:36:28] the Sun because the mass a million
[1:36:31] earths fit inside the Sun that's how
[1:36:33] great this is and the Sun is just an
[1:36:36] average star if you look at stars it's
[1:36:38] just average there's a lot like metal
[1:36:40] juice in and read Rigel there's all
[1:36:43] kinds of stars at a much bigger than the
[1:36:44] Sun but that's how small and
[1:36:49] insignificant earth is that's how great
[1:36:51] the Sun is now let's look at a few
[1:36:53] scriptures as we close I already took 10
[1:36:55] minutes just give me about five more so
[1:36:56] I hit the highlights here and I'm time
[1:36:58] to preach all these - want to preach a
[1:37:00] few bible scriptures on the stars and
[1:37:03] joke 22 stars are noted for their height
[1:37:07] what makes them special is how high they
[1:37:08] are what makes an eagle special how high
[1:37:10] they can fly you see God heavenly places
[1:37:13] God is above us God is the great one
[1:37:15] right and that is what makes it so great
[1:37:17] is there so far above us now
[1:37:20] stars can be sealed according to Joe but
[1:37:22] number we've got to seal the Holy Ghost
[1:37:24] so I'm not sure how that works out a
[1:37:26] star the mouse and stars are sealed so
[1:37:28] not sure how that works
[1:37:30] stars are ordained just like us about
[1:37:33] Jesus says I've ordained you to go
[1:37:34] preach the gospel amen
[1:37:37] God ordained all the stars in their
[1:37:39] place so are we ordained stars have
[1:37:43] their own burning which is like a Holy
[1:37:44] Ghost because the Bible said did not our
[1:37:46] hearts burn within us how did it ain't
[1:37:50] men stars are they the numbered by God
[1:37:53] just like you've got a name and just
[1:37:54] like God knows the number of hairs on
[1:37:56] your head
[1:37:57] stars praise God with their life the
[1:38:00] Bible said the stars are praising God by
[1:38:02] shining the light and the bruggman said
[1:38:05] the light is the promised word
[1:38:06] manifested or visible so when we live
[1:38:09] the message of our hour about holy
[1:38:11] dressing and holy living and the baptism
[1:38:14] of Holy Ghost we are lights in this dark
[1:38:17] world and we are giving God praise just
[1:38:19] by living the word that's preached to us
[1:38:21] hey man we are the light with a
[1:38:24] manifestation this word is real
[1:38:26] mermaidman when we live it when you live
[1:38:29] this you are the light of the world we
[1:38:32] just can't sit there on paper just be a
[1:38:33] servant we've got to go live it and when
[1:38:35] we live it we're shining light in any
[1:38:37] minute and that gives God praise they've
[1:38:40] been saying one it is throne above the
[1:38:42] stars of God so stars can be angels
[1:38:45] stars can be believers others he wanted
[1:38:48] his throne above everything one you want
[1:38:49] to be the highest age you want to be
[1:38:51] higher than God higher than all the
[1:38:52] believers stars represent the seed of
[1:38:56] Abraham's that's where you and I come in
[1:38:58] the Bible says we're seed of Abraham
[1:39:00] through faith not by the blood any more
[1:39:01] not by the natural genealogy but by
[1:39:04] spiritual genealogy by believing in
[1:39:07] Christ the Bible said that stars
[1:39:11] representing the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:39:13] did you know stars represent
[1:39:15] soul-winners let's read that it's going
[1:39:18] to Daniel Cho petrified oh this is worth
[1:39:20] it to read it when you win a soul to God
[1:39:25] it's you now our become a star you are
[1:39:29] shining Daniel 12:3 we're almost to
[1:39:33] Daniel 12 in our series on
[1:39:34] which is lesson almost done with that
[1:39:38] what do you want to read that but but
[1:39:41] Adam you agree okay Daniel 12:3 thank
[1:39:43] you sir
[1:39:43] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[1:39:47] brightness of the firmament that they
[1:39:49] that turn many to righteousness and
[1:39:52] sorrows forever and ever amen
[1:39:54] when we win souls and turn somebody to
[1:39:58] Christ we're shining like the night sky
[1:40:00] where that night sky dissolving the
[1:40:01] galaxy mummy Wade that's what we are we
[1:40:04] are now shining lights for God
[1:40:06] well why because our light is shining on
[1:40:08] others and it's impacting others right
[1:40:11] light you cannot exist on this earth
[1:40:13] without the Sun so it is when you pass
[1:40:15] the life of God into somebody you've now
[1:40:17] become a son to them and your light of
[1:40:20] Christ is shined out to them and life
[1:40:21] comes forth how do we be a soul winner a
[1:40:24] man as I want more than anything else is
[1:40:26] to win souls for Christ Jesus had his
[1:40:29] own star the Bible said they saw the
[1:40:31] star in the East they were in the we
[1:40:32] East that had travel west following a
[1:40:35] star so stars are guides they met right
[1:40:38] sorry guys
[1:40:39] so the Holy Spirit is up star to us it's
[1:40:41] guiding us to Christ and then they amen
[1:40:44] stars represent Christ he's taught to
[1:40:46] starve jqe Christ is the bright and
[1:40:49] Morning Star the Holy Ghost is a star
[1:40:52] because the Bible is that this is my
[1:40:53] star sermon
[1:40:54] the Dave stars are risen in our hearts
[1:40:56] member that on Easter earth angels are
[1:41:00] considered stars in Revelation 12 for
[1:41:02] because of the serpent drew a third of
[1:41:03] the stars of heaven with his tail down
[1:41:05] to earth right a third of the angels he
[1:41:07] brought with him and wandering stars
[1:41:10] we'll get to that the Bible said Cain
[1:41:12] was a wandering star remember he said
[1:41:15] God I'm a vagabond I'm a bag about it a
[1:41:18] wanderer I can't live like this people
[1:41:20] are going to kill many gods who I'll set
[1:41:21] a mark on you so he kills you what'd he
[1:41:24] do he just wander around run around he
[1:41:26] never found his close to duty you know
[1:41:29] church you should rejoice if you found
[1:41:31] your post to duty his cane never found
[1:41:34] it he just wandered here he wanted there
[1:41:36] I'm it of this getting out of that
[1:41:38] that's what people in other message well
[1:41:39] I think this is pretty good I'll go out
[1:41:41] of it I'll go out of the year I run
[1:41:43] there we got to find our position
[1:41:45] Seiler like a star headed a the head
[1:41:46] find your position and stand there how
[1:41:49] their young under the week
[1:41:53] the bible said here there are four
[1:41:55] spring one of them okay this is where
[1:41:59] there's so many seed of abraham it's as
[1:42:01] the stars of the sky multitude as the
[1:42:04] sad much is by the seashore numerable
[1:42:06] but the Bible said he tells the number
[1:42:08] the stars he caught them all by their
[1:42:10] names God knows every one of those needs
[1:42:12] those trillions of stars just like he
[1:42:14] knows every Christian a man so we cannot
[1:42:17] number the stars their innumerable to us
[1:42:19] just like the sand of the sea but God
[1:42:21] knows the number aren't you glad God
[1:42:24] knows your name God knows who you are
[1:42:26] God knows where you should be you know
[1:42:27] every single one of them here's the one
[1:42:31] who we said earlier so the day star
[1:42:33] arise in your hearts but that's the Holy
[1:42:35] Ghost is lighting on the day star rising
[1:42:37] or the rising of the Sun amen
[1:42:40] we're almost a few more here with me
[1:42:43] here
[1:42:43] Jude 1:13 is what we said earlier raging
[1:42:46] waves of the sea foaming out their own
[1:42:48] shame wandering stars to whom is
[1:42:51] reserved the blackness of Darkness
[1:42:53] forever see when people wonder from
[1:42:55] church and church to shows they might be
[1:42:57] lost
[1:42:58] I'll just try this one we'll see they
[1:43:00] get mad at that one I'll go to next one
[1:43:02] I get mad that one go next month they've
[1:43:04] got to confess that sinner they're going
[1:43:06] to take that same sin to the next church
[1:43:07] they're going to take that same broken
[1:43:09] heart to the next church right let me
[1:43:12] take that same scarred condition I got
[1:43:14] started this preacher hurt me or this
[1:43:15] sister hurt me and if they don't ask
[1:43:18] forgiveness for that and work that out
[1:43:19] they take that same star to the next
[1:43:21] trick that when somebody hurts on that
[1:43:22] that was her to get hurt again and the
[1:43:25] Bible says somebody hurts you don't talk
[1:43:26] to them they're choosing to be hurt no
[1:43:29] choosing to be there to rather be a
[1:43:31] victor I'm a lot teachers I want to be a
[1:43:34] victim how to be a victor other than
[1:43:37] I've known too many victims all
[1:43:39] everybody just hurt me everybody let
[1:43:41] your job to go to that go see that be a
[1:43:43] victim be a victor being overcomer
[1:43:46] amen amen because that's who rules the
[1:43:48] nations over comers hey glory let
[1:43:51] matters vote and we today sitting here
[1:43:54] one of the other is going to control us
[1:43:55] so let's cast out evil one let's take
[1:43:58] our position with the stars of the
[1:43:59] heavens under incent as the Bible says
[1:44:02] wandering stars over the book of Jude
[1:44:04] foaming out their own shame and we don't
[1:44:06] want to be wandering stars wonder if
[1:44:08] this is right I wonder if that is right
[1:44:10] I wonder if this what happened I wonder
[1:44:12] how it could be don't wander stay like
[1:44:16] those stars of the heaven as a real
[1:44:19] soldier at his post of duty stand there
[1:44:22] but leaving life and death Amon that's
[1:44:24] why I can stay here on a Wednesday night
[1:44:26] screeching of more people I know my
[1:44:28] coach to duty I know where God placed me
[1:44:30] in the star it is a solar system Academy
[1:44:32] and I understand their like I posted
[1:44:34] duty just like the Sun standard that
[1:44:36] that's positioning ahead I'm going to
[1:44:38] find my position in Christ and give it
[1:44:40] everything I got
[1:44:41] hallelujah I'm going to burn for Christ
[1:44:43] in that position and I'm just going to
[1:44:45] be an example for Christ so you should
[1:44:47] wonder the same thing now this is just
[1:44:50] introduced just for it to remind you
[1:44:51] when judgment comes many of the stars
[1:44:54] will withdraw shining your light this is
[1:44:57] quite a thing I talk about in astronomy
[1:45:00] I can't explain this but many of those
[1:45:03] bands or stars will stop shining they're
[1:45:04] out of the Bible censor the Sun the moon
[1:45:06] should go dark and the stars shall
[1:45:08] withdraw their shine and this reminds us
[1:45:13] that what the bride is off the earth
[1:45:15] when the bride goes up in the rapture
[1:45:17] the light of God goes and so God is
[1:45:20] going to show that in the skies by
[1:45:22] having those stars burn out and they're
[1:45:25] going to lose the light why because the
[1:45:27] light of the Holy Ghost just left the
[1:45:28] earth never to see that God is giving
[1:45:31] science and in the head is to show
[1:45:33] what's going to happen I would already
[1:45:34] have it on the earth the light left the
[1:45:36] real Holy Ghost left and now it's
[1:45:39] getting dark so that's in the sixth seal
[1:45:42] and on time to go that as in the the
[1:45:44] third trumpet and the fourth trumpet
[1:45:46] remember brother have said all the
[1:45:47] trumpets took place under that sixth
[1:45:50] seal for Trump let's get our feet I'm a
[1:45:55] closer to this if I get you standing I'm
[1:45:57] going to close I went over what I said
[1:45:59] forgive me but let me finish this I got
[1:46:00] three more slides just great give me a
[1:46:03] leg out here after we were side stars
[1:46:06] give
[1:46:07] eight and why do they give light to rule
[1:46:09] over the day and for signs and seasons
[1:46:13] did you know that you are given the
[1:46:16] light you're the light of Christ so
[1:46:17] you'll rule over this this dark earth
[1:46:20] and so you can be assigned to somebody
[1:46:23] else like I was assigned to my
[1:46:25] homosexual principal I was assigned to
[1:46:29] him that the Word of God is true I was
[1:46:33] assigned to him
[1:46:34] Ezekiel was made assigned to the house
[1:46:36] of his for that scripture just as the
[1:46:39] Stars your scientist is going to happen
[1:46:41] so are you and I scientists everybody
[1:46:43] else to decorate jesus said when the
[1:46:47] times the Gentiles ends there should be
[1:46:49] signs in the Sun and the moon and the
[1:46:51] stars look at Psalms 37 7 the Sun to
[1:46:57] rule the day by day for his nursing the
[1:46:59] forever the moon the stars to rule by
[1:47:02] night
[1:47:03] what's the moon represent it represents
[1:47:06] you the church it represents the life of
[1:47:09] the Sun does the moon have any power of
[1:47:12] its own any light of its own no it only
[1:47:14] reflects the light of the Sun that
[1:47:17] represents the church the church has no
[1:47:18] power its own it only reflects the light
[1:47:21] of Jesus Christ but the Bible will also
[1:47:24] see this the moon rules the nighttime it
[1:47:26] rules it visits the brightest thing in
[1:47:27] the night sky so does the church rule
[1:47:30] when Christ left the earth but now that
[1:47:34] the Bible said we're stars as well see
[1:47:37] we fit both types we're both the moon
[1:47:39] and the stars we're not wandering stars
[1:47:41] we're in position stars serving a
[1:47:45] purpose we're giving light in life to
[1:47:47] others because the Bible says here for
[1:47:50] by one man's offense death reigned by
[1:47:52] one much more they which receive
[1:47:55] abundance of grace and the gift of
[1:47:57] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:47:59] Jesus Christ I hope you're enjoying the
[1:48:02] victory in Christ and I are you joy
[1:48:03] today great just as the Sun rules rules
[1:48:06] the day the Stars rule the night the
[1:48:08] moon rose tonight
[1:48:09] so we ruin this dark Laodicea filthiness
[1:48:12] is that rather than that our lives rule
[1:48:15] people see how do you lift this how do
[1:48:17] you do this you do it by the light of
[1:48:21] Christ I got a call from a brother that
[1:48:24] recent left the church we probably
[1:48:26] figured out who was but I got a call
[1:48:27] from him he said you know Jesse said I
[1:48:30] tell people where I'm at now that
[1:48:32] there's a man I know a pastor I know
[1:48:33] that actually lives the message and he
[1:48:35] said their friends are like no way he
[1:48:37] actually lives what he preaches I said
[1:48:41] you go to Jesse's house you will find TV
[1:48:43] stations you won't find dirty magazines
[1:48:46] he actually lives what he believes and I
[1:48:49] was just asking well thank you but
[1:48:49] that's really humped I was just humbled
[1:48:51] by that and his friends were raised
[1:48:54] domestic churches what is it if we have
[1:48:58] a real light of Christ we are we're a
[1:49:01] ruler over the sinful world there are
[1:49:03] some real stars out there and then
[1:49:05] there's our are some real people out
[1:49:07] there who are actually taking the word
[1:49:09] that they have and take it home and
[1:49:11] making their homes places the holiness
[1:49:13] amen and these young people can hardly
[1:49:17] how could something actually this
[1:49:18] message because it's not me living in
[1:49:20] its Christ living its Christ today you
[1:49:24] if it's Christ in you ain't a man you
[1:49:26] just say jesus take the wheel
[1:49:28] Jesus take the reins you rule my life
[1:49:30] for me and when you surrender it's
[1:49:31] Christ man there's one glory of the Moon
[1:49:36] and there's another glory the Stars amen
[1:49:39] there's a certain glory on the bride
[1:49:40] home she just she has no light of her
[1:49:42] own it's just Christ but there's also
[1:49:43] another glowing mind that glory that
[1:49:46] star has a self-illuminating fire inside
[1:49:49] of it it's got a self it's got power
[1:49:52] than itself it just he's burning and
[1:49:55] burning and both of them are on glory
[1:49:58] that shows us about Christ in us it's
[1:50:01] another way to look at it when amen but
[1:50:03] how does other way to look at it one way
[1:50:05] we're the moon one way we're star one
