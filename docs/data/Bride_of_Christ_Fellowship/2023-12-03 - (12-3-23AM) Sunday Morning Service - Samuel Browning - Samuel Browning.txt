message church that I ever went to was believer spok a word Tabernacle there in shef I'm so glad God of all the places God placed us right there amen amen the footsteps of the righteous were certainly ordered of the Lord I really needed a mentor at the beginning of my Ministry and that's exactly what God gave me with brother Samuel what a mentor he taught me all these spiritual things but he also taught me how to tie this tie right here you remember teaching brother John Graham and I how to tie ties remember that that was in my first department when we first got there he so he's taught me much mostly spiritual I said one time I said brother Samuel years ago I said brother Samuel your gift is such a gift of God I said you should be preaching at these conventions and things and I feel like God is answering that right now he's been had so many invitations I've seen him out there just so thankful for what God is doing there by the grace of God Amen Hallelujah wrote a few things down here brother bang didn't it brother Samuel baptize you yeah that's right right a baptized brother bab hallelujah hallelujah so we're just grateful U you know even in my personal life right after I got the Holy Ghost I wasn't sure whether I had it and we came to Sheffield and brother Samuel preached like a seven it's probably like maybe 14 part series on the Holy Ghost and it was through those S series ofe of sermons that my wife and I realized we were born again he brought all the quotes from brother brandom all the scriptures it's a life that Let Live no matter what experience you have you got to go back to the word does your life line up with the word of God Amen Hallelujah that was just a crucial series um and I just want to thank the Lord for every sermon I heard you preach brother God knew

say Amen ready amen have Liberty sir love you buddy apprciate you what do you say after that some of those things you know find myself certain things you know you remember certain things and I some things I I find myself even now forgetting certain parts and it isn't the things aren't important but you know it just shows you sometimes just how things come life but I'll tell you what it is what's most important is that we in our own lives have those real special spiritual memorials we can have a lot of natural memorials which are wonderful you know our spouse married and then our children those are just wonderful memorials different different achievements and accomplishments you know you come through in life for something for a while great thing that isting means the that even if God we would lose our natural that we have a spiritual amen hallelujah that's the anchor that's the that through every situation of life God knows what we're going to face and there's a real anchor and a hold for our hearts we can always bring everything to every situation every problem say we love you the Lord we appreciate Jess family dear friends to us just just counted an honor to be here with you this morning just looking to what the Lord will do for us here serves so thankful I see Jess children they are young people I don't to call them children I you to me it's very hard for me when I look and I and I I remember I can remember just as each one you know just real little I mean I still think back in my mind whena was born and we were we met over there in the mall I don't remember what mall it was somewhere in the area but I remember you little Jesse holding her just a few months in I thought my goodness each time you know and she'll come and she'll sing and Lydia was born Malachi my goodness you know now you you know like with Malachi apprciate testimony amen and they justly been a blessing to us as they come me we have there so I don't want to keep you standing I can talk to you but I know we' come here to hear the word of the Lord hallelujah that's certainly what we desire to hearen amen so may God richly bless each of you if we could let's just go to him in a word of PR Heavenly Father Lord Lord how thankful we are God for the moments Lord that you have given us Lord certainly Lord there are many memorials in our lives Lord we're so grateful Lord for each event Lord what makes us Lord so thankful Lord the greatest is the spiritual Memorial Lord in our lives Lord things that you have done Lord that's what gives us a deeper appreciation for even the Natural Things of life as Lord Paul would write to Timothy Lord and express to him even in Joy those Natural Things of Life Lord we thank you Father Lord for our families we thank you Lord for our brothers and sisters thank you Father for how you provided Lord for all of our needs Lord yes Jesus lord it's you that Lord just gives the value to everything around us Lord lallah once you come into our lives Lord father all that we can see is you Lord You're Everything To Us Lord yes Lord we just ask that Lord that you would just come Among Us this morning in a very special way Lord yes Jesus in these Services Lord as we father you Lord would lay upon brother Jesse's heart and Lord hear everything would just Lord be arranged that we would be able to come together this morning asking Lord that you'll just come Lord help me to step aside Hallelujah the congregation Lord you know the needs that's here Lord Jesus things that Lord that Lord that you would lay on my heart but Lord I'm asking you for the same inspiration Lord you would come and deliver Lord God your word to our hearts minister to every need Lord that's here father Hallelujah May there not be one life oh God that would Lord walk out of these meeting Lord here this morning this afternoon Lord without there being Lord that need Lord that thirst quenched Lord satisfied oh God the hunger Lord every need Lord physically spiritually Lord you know father and we just Lord give ourselves to you Lord and ask that you would have your way Lord come and anoint us Lord together speaker and hearer we pray father we love you and we thank you Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah amen if you will turn with me scriptures here I'd like to go to Luke 5 verse 17 remember remember Jessie asking I tell you I think he's so far's far beyond that has to me has incredible amounts of energy and stamina and just so appreciate his seal for work of the Lord I remember when some of my stamina started slowing a little bit there and I thought honestly thought something was going on I said's what's taking place you know and so you know I think it's some of those things sometimes that God gives us Grace to help us in those moments of how to you know to even when we're using our energies and how to go about those things like brother Brown talked about in Works Faith expressed he said you know at first he said we went into the meetings he said it's like a person learning to swim that's right learning to swim and you come out he said but after a while he said you learn how to make those Strokes it isn't that we become have more stamina it's just that you know sometimes God gives us Grace on how to use the stamina we have is Les so we love you let's read here a few vers of scripture Luke 5 verse 17 say it's so good to have my wife and my family and the boys here with me verse 17 and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was present to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with pausy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him just to ask the Lord to bless the reading of the word you're being seated I want to just continue to read just for a few moments I would like to the Lord would help us and we'll just see how this will move here between now and this evening but uh I really want to deal with the authority that we have in this presence The Authority that we have in the presence of the Lord and we go on to read here in the scriptures in verse 19 in Luke 5 it says and they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went on the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto them man thy sins are forgiven the scribes and the Pharisees begin to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemy who can forgive sins but God alone I want you to notice as we look here in the scriptures there the awareness uh of even of these men who were friends and I'd say if there's any friends you want to have you want to have friends that have a real care for your life that desire to bring you into the presence of the reality of the Living God and you know bring us coming into the presence of God you you realize that the Simplicity that when the Bible says draw nine to God he'll Draw N to you Amen brother Brandon would take that scripture and and and bring it to us and say so many times in our minds we're become so occupied with even the cares of life he says that we miss we miss those opportunities and it's even the simple things that brother BR would talk about such as he said we get on our mind the latest dish soap and the other things things that are not even sinful but but Satan wants to so cloud and so clog our mind mind right because remember the word of God it won't bypass your mind but the word of God comes through that it first everything even coming to that of the new birth it first of all it's got to be believed and it passes through the Mind amen and then it moves from here down to here hallelujah and that's why that even as we look at it with within this uh these to me were some real friends because they uh were seeing a need within their uh friend's life and they got together and this this friend this individual the man with apy was not able to actually get himself there into the presence of God that's right and I think of it with for you and I that you know there are times that there we need a real strength from almighty God coming into the presence of God hallelujah yes how many remember the man by the name The Prophet by the name of Elisha that he was all out of sorts one day but there was was a need for God to speak through that vessel Hallelujah and so the very thing that Elisha said now you know Elisha could have you know he could have just said well you know I'm a prophet of God you know I don't see any obstacles I don't have any obstacles but being a prophet of God knowing that God will deal by inspiration and so what he looks at is that there is something that's needed in order to bring h a rest and a relaxing for him in order that that channel can be open amen you know that's the same way that God will deal with our lives sometimes even with the cares of Life the pressures of life that come our way it can become so tight so binding so much on your life even as you go through the things and the channels of life in Natural Care that are not even sinful but it's just the just the cares of life sometimes with schooling sometimes with work things that are going on on the job some times even as things transitions that happen even from in marriage children coming along all those things of learning the diversity of how to be able to divide ourselves and be able to minister to one another's needs as well as giving the Lord first place in all those things yes amen amen so sometimes that can be so uh uh challenging or mindboggling for us we can go through different battles where in ourselves we're looking and you know am I am I being as fervent as I need to be here and and we but sometimes what it is there's transitions that come in our lives even as we go into things with schooling a job you know how is you start a new job there's a more of a demand on you at first your mental part of it as you're thinking through things and trying to bring everything in it's a lot of pressure but you know this when we come back to Elisha he knew what was needed he said bring me a Ministry amen Isel be to play and as he played that that he be to play the Bible says then the hand of the Lord Came Upon Elijah hallelujah what did the music itself sou did it it was a changing of the atmosphere that was there the presence of God was not something that was really far off he right there amen as a matter of fact even though Jehoshaphat and that of that King had went on without consulting the Lord they had went off had not made uh uh appropriate uh um uh thinking of water and all those things but yet God in his Mercy showed that he is always right there with us I'll just say it like this I I just don't want I appreciate the reality to know that he said he never leave me nor forsake I appreciate that reality but it's also in the times that to say Lord I I I want to I want to sense your presence I want to be in a place that I am aware of your presence I want to be in a condition that you can speak to me Lord amen and I want to be in that place to where that if I know that I'm not in that place that he can speak to me I want to know that there is uh sufficient uh Grace that for us to be able to move into that channel that's why when Elisha asked for that the minstral and the menstral begin to play the atmosphere changed Hallelujah that's why brother Brandon when he talked about around the office where he was at and he talked about how that things that his son brother Billy Paul dealt with certain things and he would say he keeps that music on keep music keep that of the gospel music that's on it's very important yes amen those things like that it's just like when you come out of the workplace and you come away sometimes from some things and sometimes you look at it and say well I need to pray well I need to get in the word but sometimes it's just getting into condition so that we're not just going through the motions where we need the grace of almighty God to come the scene and move for our lives and this is where I look at this is to me what real friends are all about this is a moment where we have true brothers and sisters to wear that if someone else is a little discouraged or someone's down well God doesn't come down and put us down because we feel down God's interested in encouraging you and I he's interested in strengthening you and I sir God's God the whole the whole anointing of the word of God it's never come to beat us down it comes to lift us up and so when we look at this and see it with there operating in the scriptures we see even this uh of this principle working here of where even as we come into the house of God and here we are you know sometimes you come in from the toils and the tasks of life and you come in here and sometimes it just seems like that everything you're looking at it's so overwhelming how I can't even see my way through it but I'm coming to the house of God because I'm expecting God God's going to say something there's something that God has for me because God is mindful amen as we said before he's my helper he'll never leave me nor forsake me God know knows what I'm going through he knows what I'm facing he knows the obstacles God even knows even the doubt that can want to surround your life God even knows the thoughts that youve thought on within the previous week or even this morning and you know what God's not intimidated by that whatsoever he's not whatsoever God is confident here is wants his children come into His presence and you know what in order for you and I to come into His presence God Woos us into his presence you know just like how the prophet would describe the coming of the Lord and he would speak of that and taking that of the Clouds Of Glory its waves of his presence that just rolling in upon us it just moves in it just you know it starts just like you start in the song service it starts with just just pressing through a little barrier there a moment beyond the weariness beond on the just to say Lord you're worthy Lord where you you've guided me from this past week and where I am right now and you find that as you moved through that moment right there Then here you'll find then is it you'll move through the next moment and and to the next moment and his presence and pretty soon you're you're actually caught away from the discouragement Hallelujah from everything that you sting in that look that was so over overwhelming in your natural senses in your reasoning but now in the presence of God you can see things the right way and look at it and say God has got this in control Hallelujah a said it before now I'm seeing it now I'm experiencing that glory and so I when I look at this here in the scripture and seeing this this part uh to to me uh these are these are I Call These Guys these are buddies these are these are people that you definitely want to be on in your corner on your side that are there to encourage you they looked and they seen think about this it would be like you coming here to turn off of the of the road out here and you would look and there's no way to get in here your cars are just lined up through here and here you come and you think well I'll park over there in the dealership and at least we'll walk over or we'll park over there in another parking lot and we'll walk over and so then you get in here and here you come to the door and the door's open and the door's open and all the way down the hallway it's filled and in through here it's filled and you look at it and you would think how am I ever going to get in there right I want to get in there I just don't want to stand outside I want to get in there yes I I I I want to be I want to be a partaker and a part of what's taking place now you know you'd have a choice at that time you've got a choice whether that at that moment you say you know what there's just too many people here it's not going to be it's just not going to be comfortable for me I mean this is this a situation is it is it really worth it let me just say every moment in God's presence is worth Hall and sometimes God commit situations to come our way to test us that we then make a decision a declaration of the faith that we say we have within us now it comes to a declaration it comes to a showdown now you might look at that and say well that don't seem like a mount carel experience but you realize we are brought to make decisions time and time again and come to that place to realize hey In God's Presence I am not going to turn away God has a blessing for me praise God yes even if I had to stand outside God's Got a Blessing for me I'm certain because the house of God it said forsake not to assemble our more Hallelujah I have confidence that even if I have to listen and I'm not able to see the minister and I would have to listen through some sort of an audio Source stream it tap into it listen through the window whatever it would be it's worth wor it to be in the presence of godallah because the Bible says for you or three are GA together in my name I am there a pres right here Among Us think about it here they came and they moved back I mean they didn't even ask the owner of the house you think it'd be all right if we go up on your roof and we you know take part of your roof off and and we and we we lower this this our our friend down no they didn't ask that they what it is they saw a need they seen the need and they looked at where Jesus was you see it was in their heart we know where he's at and we need our friend is in need of a touch in his life if we can just get him in the presence of God and to think of that with within all of it that they themselves it would come into such a place where they would be so guided with such Precision to where when that man was let down he was let down right there before the Lord Jesus amen amen I tell you that took going beyond their feelings yes that took going beyond all the thoughts what's this homeowner going to think what's this person going to think me climbing up on their roof what are they going to think you know many times to get into God's presence the greatest person or place we have to overcome is our own self that's right Hallelujah I don't about things well I'm not worthy well it's not about your worth your worthiness be no Hallelujah the Bible tells us that when the fall took place in there in Eden that God placed a chaban there with a flaming sword by the gate to keep the way back into that of the Tree of Life showing that keeping the way God didn't seal it out like they you know wanted to seal up there the Eastern Gate God didn't seal it up but God himself placed there would be a chaban with a flaming sword showing keeping the way that there would be a way made backel back into the not just to a place to where the Pres of God would come and remove and come move the prophets experienced that but the difference was is that when God himself came down in Redemption the whole the whole uh part of it as the prophet tells us when he came he came with the Redeemer anointing well what was the Redeemer anointing he was anointed with the same spirit that was upon the prophets it was the same God as Paul said God in Su dry times spake to the prophets yes is that right SP to the people through the prophets in many different di manners but the difference was with the Redeemer anointing was it wasn't just a promise speaking of redemption but now God himself had come and United with man Hallelujah God had created a tabernacle for himself to dwell in and the Bible said on whom thou see the spirit descending and remaining Hallelujah that is Redeemer anointing and that's the same way it takes place in the life of a Believer do you realize if the way that even God brings a person into the new birth it's Redeemer anointing moving upon your heart bringing conviction to your life growing you in Repentance you realize that the Seal of the Holy Ghost is more of the same Grace that's been work hallelujah it's not it's us hallelujah it's leading us all the way who is it that could deal with even to our mind begins to change after justification our mind begins to change concerning the thoughts and things of the world things that didn't used to bother us now we we start thinking differently about that what is it it's more of the same grace of God hallelujah and as we'll yield to that he will take us all the way Hallelujah work because remember this example right here is the same way God works with you and I God knows where we need to get to he knows where we need to get to the reality of it is it's not when we think of the Tabernacle in the wilderness we're seeing as they would progress from the outer Court to Inner Court to the holiest of holies but you know all of that itself was a type of you yes amen you're God's Dwelling Place your's resting place Hallelujah it was not the blood itself where the animal was slay in the outer cord then the blood itself placed upon the horns of the altar then that blood would go deeper and the blood would be placed there upon the altar there uh of incense and it would be there in the Holy place but then that blood would move on in into of The Mercy Seat what was it it's God going deeper in your life yes Hallelujah not necessarily you going somewhere it's us yielding and God coming deeper Hallelujah Glory it's a gentleman and God works in that way this whole example we see in the scripture is that of God's presence moving in our lives that God bringing us to the place that we need to be in surrender amen glory because you know as we we speak of you know of a full surrender and it does take a full surrender but do you realize that that's something when we look at that and say a full surrender that's yielding what has God's dealing with your life has God's moving on your heart it's just Lord I want more of you I want more of you to take over more of me hallah that's why the prob can exppress that the coming that when the Holy Spirit he said is come and he'll deal with even in the beginnings there of justification he said it comes into your life like a little white button and he says the more that you can allow it to grow it'll push out the house it'll push out it'll push out the habits of the world because the Bible said how can two walk together except they be aged how you entertaining and feeding the right one he grows bigger he grows stronger pushes out other hallelujah thank you Jesus this is exactly we're heing the scriptures if they can get this man in the presence of the Lord Jesus and here he comes into this place and the Bible says that Jesus saw their faith right yes you see it's one thing as we look at it and we declare we have faith and let me just say it like this that Faith itself it is it's the very Foundation it's the very necessity there's nothing that we can receive from God without faith that's right Hallelujah and faith is an unconscious thing right yes it's an unconscious it's a subconscious thing because even of lives that set in the meetings brother Rand would describe this over and over even setting in the meetings of do with the white Moody and people were being healed When de might when the white Moody wasn't even preaching Divine Healing wow why because the presence of God was there for that moment according to that message that light that hour and there were lies believing and recognizing God's presence amen so the needs what they had need of in their bodies they receed what they had need of Hallelujah I don't know if it was on their minds or not I don't know that it just is like when I think of how thinking of a Consciousness is that how that brother Brandon would talk about those individuals setting on the on on the Pew and brother Ram will call different ones out and say you didn't think you had enough Faith did you see think you didn't think you had enough Faith amen he said but you're already healed amen because faith is not a conscious thing faith is a subconscious right yes that's why when brother R tells us he said when you're praying about your loved ones he said let it move from a conscious to a subconscious amen I can't do that on my own when he says Let It Move that way how does it move that way it's God to move it deeper in our life how does God move it deeper in our life it's by us yielding amen yes the presence of God is Not forceful amen right yes the presence of God is something as we come into His presence there's an awareness like brother BR would stand right and he would say now he says now that that won't hurt you it would make the people aware because they're aware there's a there's a great presence that's here hallelujah maybe never had sensed that never had sensed that presence before here stands the angel of the Lord and he would say he's not here to hurt you and here they would be aware here of the presence of almighty God even how some would react in the midst of that presence but what was important is is that in the midst of the presence of the Lord that they could recognize that it was God amen hallelujah amen that they could look past a veil and recognize it's God in the Fulfillment of his word this is what stumbled this is the veil itself has always been the hindrance among people that's right tells us that's the greatest challenge that God has is for one mortal to believe another mortal that's right that's right brother right the greatest challenge this is why when the angel of the Lord spoke to the prophet said if you can get the people to believe right nothing will stand before your prayer that's right brother R would tell one he says if you'll just believe me believe what God has spoke to me it it's done it's finished because what are we recognizing it's just like those who came in the days of Noah they had to believe what God had revealed and spoke to Noah right it didn't even when it didn't make sense right who first of all a man that is not even a ship Builder is going to build a ship come on you you know you don't let me just bring it down to simple terms you don't ask somebody to bake biscuits they can't make biscuits I know that's very simple but you you you you wouldn't choose that but see God was not choosing Noah based on his own ability yes hallah was laying within Noah Hallelujah before the word had even come across Noah's path Noah himself was devout he was he was looking to God he was serving God and here God comes and makes himself known to Noah and think about it in the midst of a of a time that's like this why would you build a ship if there is the necessity or the need for this ship here to move upon water why would you build it in dry land you build in a shipyard right it doesn't make sense to the Natural mind but you see God did not need the ship to be brought to the water God was going to bring the water to the ship to the AR is that right yes that's that's God expressing what he was going to do for us there's no way that we could get to God [Applause] God what we were at we were in a and we were in a condition knew where we were at Hallelujah just as he's building work in every of our life then here comes the water Hallelujah and it lifts us yes Jesus so he sees their faith and and the Lord Jesus in seeing their faith he looks upon the man and he says thy sins are forgiven thee my I tell you the the the scribes and Pharisees had a had a very challenging time and looking at that and the very thing that they mention is who can forgive sins but God alone right but Jesus the Bible says in verse 22 perceive their thoughts and he answering said unto them what reason ye in your hearts whether is it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon Earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of the py I say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thy house and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying God and they were all amazed and they glorified God and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things today now think about about this here he he speaks to a realm that they cannot see they see the man is bound with AOS yes they see that it would it would seem as though that's what those men they were bringing their friend there for he had a need in his life but the Lord Jesus saw their faith he saw he saw their faith and he saw there was a deeper need within that person's life and he went to what's the most important now let me say God cares about your health Hallelujah the Bible said I would that thou uh uh did prosper in health even as thy Soul doth Prosper God's interested in Divine Health God's interested in us in that part because you know why he has no other hands but your hands no other feet no other arms God God is moving through your life through your body to be yielded yes to be a vessel like Elisha was a channel that inspiration could come you're a channel amen hallelujah you're a channel for inspiration to come you can't serve god without inspiration it takes God to come and inspire you amen and the way that God inspires you inspires You by his word because within that word is the same sealed up the same inspiration as it was when God himself spoken amen that's why the word still has an effect and it has an authority and has a power because the word is not a dead letter when the spirit of God comes upon that word it lifs God out of history and brings him a presentence God to where you and I can even read this passage of scripture right here this morning and see ourselves see our day see the working of the Holy Spirit right here in our own midst Hallelujah here in a situation that in a realm all they could see was the visible and Jesus speaks to the invisible realm man thy sins be forgiven amen amen wow they're they're they're looking well you see here's the thing how do you how do you prove what's taking place in an invisible realm see brother Brandon said it like this when he's talking about even within imagination he says you realize he said that you could have he says he said we could sit right here and I could say well there goes the pillar of fire he said and you know he says you may not see it but then again he said maybe you would and we'd be sitting there oh my there it is he said but we've got even a greater confirmation than that you would think what's greater than being able to see it right right because brother Ram says see by me telling you that if you get to a place he said to where I'm saying that to you and you come to such a place to where you start seeing things that aren't even there right right right this I'm right out of the message and quote it yes sir brother Bram goes in to say he said but we've got something greater than that we have the photograph that was taken Hallelujah there's no imagination to that whatsoever yes sir that's the same thing it is right here in that invisible realm they can't see what's taking place in that invisible isible realm but here's what's happening there's a connection that's being made Jesus saw their faith and their faith was unlocking more than what they even went there for your will unlock all the with one need in your life that God sees a greater need presence it unlocks that the faith that you have in your heart to rec recognize all that I have need of there's this need there's this need there's this need and it unlocks everything and the very thing that maybe you had on your heart this morning I need God to minister to this I need God to minister to this and in his presence God comes down and deals with something that's of a much higher priority Hallelujah God that's the leadership of the Holy Spirit personally to you and I because we need that guidance sometimes the things that we think that really really really matter and this is really really important and if I can just get this taking care of if I can just get this settled if I can just get this and remember that's us trying to shift for ourselves not saying that it's not a real need but when we get in the presence of God everything and all that we have to do is do what he is asking you to do hallelujah amen you want a miracle in your life do what God says do when they ran out of the wine he said here Mary said to them said just take these empty pictures take them to him and whatever he tells you to do do it amen don't ask any questions just do it you see it's not your business or my business to turn the water into one that's God's business you can't do that I can't do that the woman that had uh the need the of zarapa that had a need for her and her son they were running out of substance in their home and here she walks over and she doesn't know it but God has spoke to the prophet God dries up the waterbrook and sends the prophet the same time he speaks to him and says I've commanded a widow woman to sustain me she doesn't know it she wasn't asked in the conversation her feelings about that weren't even considered because I wonder if God had asked her she probably would have been able to respond Lord you know there's only enough for me and my son maybe at that time there might have been enough for two KS but when by the time the prophet got there there was only enough for one k yes is that right yeah and you see it's when you come down to even that principle it shows us there's only really one thing that God wants it wasn't the one cake it was God wanted her will surrender Hallelujah prise [Applause] God she went she would go to that meal she go to that oil oh my you know she's get lower she's get lower she what about all the Mind battles and the worries and and the thoughts and things coming that way but when she had submitted to the word of God oh she never had to worry another day about the meal barel or the Cru GL I I I don't believe that God you know had her build another room on the house and say here you're going to have so much meal we need to make a storage seller no that's not what happened but what has shown is is what was needed for that day it was sufficient amen hallelujah showing that as we follow the word of the Lord she from that day on she liveed by thus sayith the Lord amen once sent his Prophet down with a word and here she was standing there now she's living by thus sayith the lord it's not about is this going to run out she can go to the meal Barrel make the cake that was needed for her for her son the oil that was needed maybe she could look down there and you know it seemed like there it is there's just going to be enough for another time but you know what it was enough and sufficient for each day and let me just say this God has everything that you have need of knows exactly when to bring it to your life hallelujah what you can handle at what time the only thing he requires is one thing that simple obedience that simple yielding simple surrendering and God gives to us just what we have need of Hallelujah here she was she invited the presence of the Lord right there in her home it had an effect upon the Natural Things of life amen is that right even there when her son and when her son would pass but notice the prince of God being invited there in her home there came a resurrection Hallelujah because why she made place for the presence of God let me just say this with everything you do in life every decision always make room for the presence of God hallelujah good make room for his presence amen Abraham himself could not change Sarah's thinking he could not dissolve Sarah's will even though Abraham had had an experience and had encounter after encounter with God but it took God to move personally for Sarah's life yes wonderful but how did that come about because Abraham was a channel for the presence of God to come into that home that's right and you might look and say well my husband or my wife or my this listen you personally can't go and change them or reform them but what you can do and what's greater is to be a channel for the presence hallelujah hallelujah yes even when you look on your workplace everybody else that stands on that line where you were this one over here this one over there you can't control those people but as a Son of God that place that you are given to stand you yourself can say Lord if there's nobody else here in this Factory I'm sent here here as a Son of God as a daughter of God to invite the presence of God right here on this assembly Glory Hallelujah and it has an effect on these things around us that's what this message came to do this message it come to bring God personally to you and I Hallelujah we couldn't see clearly we couldn't see clearly even like as it was there in Eden there was a cheram that was to keep the way in the Pres of God after Calvary now the Holy Spirit Goes Forth remember it's already started to be declared through the ministry uh of the son of man of the Lord Jesus he was declaring even in that time the spirit of the Lord is upon me he ha anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor to bind up the Brokenhearted to loosen the captives recovering of sight to the blind to preach the acceptable year of the Lord it was already an announcement that was taking place and now the spirit of God is not keeping the people away but the presence of God is to run or direct guide the people into that place hallelujah hallelujah that's why that the revealing of the word in this hour through through a prophet through a messenger remember they're the Candlestick there are the stars and brother R tells us that of how when he takes that of the Tabernacle that they themselves are reflect ctions they take that light and he says it's reflected there upon that labor it's reflected on that way that we might enter back into a place of certainty I have family members uh many have passed on that are a part of other uh you know uh organizations and things like that and and I I I affirmatively believe what the prophet told us in the sense uh he says if the Catholic man is trusting in his church he he lost that's right but if he's trusting in Jesus Christ he's saved that's right it doesn't make him in the brght but he's saved that's right amen I thank God for that yes but we can see that what God has done in this hour is brought a certainty to you and I amen we look at and say well that was the Holy Spirit well it's true God uses the instrumentality remember he will do nothing but he first reveal his secrets to his servants to prophets way Hallelujah can't break that order but notice within that part of it it was to bring about a certainty within the lives of the people that's what's taking place down through every one of the Gentile Church ages Hallelujah is God would send the word that would bring there an establishment to The People Under The Light under the portion that God had allotted for that moment but you and I are living in the advancement of the Gospel not because we're any better right right brother right we're a part of the body the body's been made up all the way down through the seven the stones like in Solomon's Temple com from here and there they've been assembled Through the Ages but now we're standing in a time where the mystery of God is finished Hallelujah and that mystery of God it's Christ himself in the life of the believer Hallelujah because this message of restoration was not to rest rest us back to the Ephesian age she was already a fallen woman right this message is to restore us back to that of what they had on the day of Pentecost Christ in his fullness in the body of the Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah yes and this is exactly where the word has brought you and I to in this hour with such a certainty to become such a channel that the Holy Spirit oh my as the prophet could say that comes such a power in the bride that will literally draw them out of the graves how does that happen by heing life hallelujah it's everyday living Glory it's not until all of a sudden we get to one point in our life and my we've reached that point no it's everyday living hallelujah it's just like right here today it's putting one step in front of the other one foot in front of the other yes the Bible said that Enoch walked with God Hallelujah Enoch had come into God's presence and Enoch himself he loved the presence of God yes Bible said he had a testimony yes before his translation that he pleased God yes Lord yes Lord and one day as he's taking a stroll and evidently God had made known to Enoch and brother Bram tells us like this and it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he said Enoch didn't want to go right powerful statement yes it is and you would think well why wouldn't you want to go my that is kind of carnal no no Enoch enjoyed his family yes he enjoyed that which was around him but see God needed a tip for you and I amen yes yes and God setting a tip for you and I here Enoch came to that result it becometh us to fulfill all amen he was a type for you and I so how did how did Enoch live his life well when trouble came in the family he walked with God Amen yes situations came up on the job he walked with God hallelujah right when things took place that was very difficult you walked with God Amen that is the secret of your Victory Hallelujah is your walk with God remember Cain when things didn't take place the way Cain thought they should take place we just bringing this down a little application way Cain brought fruits Abel it was revealed by the spirit of God what to bring and Abel brought that of blood right the life of an innocent one pain brought all of his efforts fruits he wasn't a smart ell he brought he brought good fruits you know he didn't bring these make believe things they sell at the supermarkets today you know tomatoes that don't look like tomatoes Tomatoes aren't perfectly round sorry but he brought those things and when God refused it how did he know God refused it because he saw God vindicate Abel's sacrifice God's presence came down upon the sacrifice but not only did it consume the sacrifice it was a witness the Abel was righteous Hallelujah yes that Abel had received from God and he simply did what God told him to do hallelujah amen where did Cain get that of bringing of bringing the fruit he got it from the teaching he was under that's right Adam and EV was teaching that you know why to hide themselves that's why I love about this message I love about this word the evening light that shined upon the word it's not there uh it it's strips down all dishonesty it strips down all deceitfulness why so there's not a veil between you and God hallelujah that you can come right back into the presence ofy God it's not pretending it's not putting you out here and giving you and and telling you something and then you think why am I in the same shape I'm in why am I in the same condition but it's God opening up the wayah what do I have to do look and live what he's telling you to do y to it don't try to figure it out just yield to his presence Hallelujah Glory here in that moment here stands Kain you know how brother brandham kind of puts the word to it he says kind of the attitude he said even among people today came took that approach when God said if you'll just worship like your brother I'll accept you right even the mercy of God right Cain was not going to become a if I could say it a bride elect member but if Cain would have just had respect unto them you know what I don't understand it but I I got to admit God vindicates that right yes yes and just had respect to it you know that's what that's what Nicodemus did yes that's what Gia did right yes Gia himself did not see the light that was being presented in that hour but Gia could say it like this he could say if God is with it you're going to be fighting against God that's right not of God come to not that's a principle with everything in our life if God's not behind it it'll come to not right yes sir but it's in those moments we want to learn we want to draw and say Lord help me I I don't want to be found wasting time and I that's not for us to be put on a place of becoming fearful and wavering of oh I I you know I want to be so careful here I I want to no if God's called you to do something do it amen that's right amen right right Hallelujah follow what God has had you what God has you to do but Cain the Bible says he went out of the presence of the Lord yes right when God refused it he walked out of the God's presence yes sir what a what a terrible thing yes sir yes sir the the one who was there to even to extend Mercy to help him it went away from the presence of God brother BR would say it like this he says and that's where you or I will fail the very minute yes we walk out of the presence of God right right brother right you see even God's presence around your life do you realize even your attitude invites his presence amen your thoughts amen toward one another amen it can either keep his presence at Bay or invited amen that's why the atmosphere and everything that's why even the where Satan wants to attack you in your mind wants to attack you in your home yes right because what it is as a Channel of God he knows he knows he cannot overcome or defeat the presence of God working of the belie that's right let me just sayah electricity could flow through my body but I was not built to be a conductor of it right that's right there's wires in this in these walls to these Outlets that those wiring that they have in in here I don't know I'm not even going to try to go into specifics but it has been designed to handle it right yes the curent and to be able to channel it to a destination yes sir that's why in this hour as an elect seed of God you are an ordained Channel amen amen yes not just that the Holy Spirit falls upon you and remember like brother B said the Pentecostals he said they blow it all out the Smoke Stack but where the spirit of God moves upon your life the presence of God moves upon your life but it's not something to that that is to depart but it's to move through your life Hallelujah that's a yes then that's where you have to evaluate in your life you have to I have to amen because it's so easy for the channels of Our Lives to become clogged up with so many different things yes sir yes sir unintentional unintentional sometimes offenses sometimes hurts sometimes the things of life sometimes there's things that we can even carry from our childhood that we we sometimes you don't even realize that how can you realize things that's right you know how can you unless God helps you in I right brother right true right you say well brother s why didn't God deal with that remember God's a god of priority yes amen God prepares just like he did on day one of creation God prepares on day one to sustain what's coming on day two then on day three oh so forth so it's one building that's the same thing God works with your life Hallelujah that's why God works that's why first God working in your life with justification it makes way for sanctification Hallelujah sanctification makes way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes a way for the Holy Ghost himself it's god making a way for himself Hallelujah to even these things in your life in my life things that you know I think of how the prophet's standing there and you know he doesn't as a man doesn't know this person but God knows the person yes Hallelujah and you know you and I think about it and these are certain statements that I just I I don't know I I just chewed on for years and looked at it I glory to me because I you see friends that even in the midst of God fulfilling his word God shows us how personal that he is and concerned about every part of our life think about it for the Lord Jesus let me just move to that point just a moment to the Lord Jesus here he is standing here on Earth the importance of redemption and yet he looks upon the multitude and he sees their hungry naturally yes yes naturally and he takes notice of that he says look we we we've got to take care of their needs we we we need to take care we don't have this much we only have this we can't you know and they're looking at what they have but Jesus is saying this is what I see is the need so when he sees the knee remember he is more than enough amen when God points out a KN that's in our life he is Jehovah ja amen and when the prophet could stand there there and God would transport him to different places like of the one sister there was also a young man that had happen to where you see them bound with nervousness yes right sometimes I know our makeups we can be prone to some of those things if God gives us Grace to re over it amen reigning is also Deliverance too amen yes Hallelujah but to see that you were chased by a yellow dog it speaks to the young man that has affected your nerves clear down to this day right yes 30 something years old but it goes right back down through its life and picks these things up what was it it was necessary at that moment why didn't God pick it up sooner why didn't god well I don't know I'm not here to give that answer I'm not here to put all that out but I just want to say this right here the Bible say he does all things beautiful Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah but all I know is is that it was at that moment it was able for that to move and to recognize and God to go down into the depth of that life let me say this that same almighty God what you saw what we rep what was represented there in the in in in the services service after service where God coming and God taking there uh the body the life of a prophet and God manifesting himself through let me say this this is why that when we look at in this hour in this moment when we speak of the revealing of the son of man it's the same Christ himself come down and move and operate through the ministry of a prophet Hallelujah same God coming back Among Us yes not the prophet but God was veiled in that prophet and that's why the prophet could say clear back in the late 50s he says oh he said to think he said this ministry the revealing of the son of man Hallelujah and we look and say well that the seals hadn't even been open but it was Christ alone that's why when brother R preaches the seven seal and people are looking for for something out here and something he takes them through the whole expans amen of what's been happening yes this event this testimony this event this testimony it was a walk on the road of emus it was a Luke 24 that's where are standing in the presence of almighty god listen and that with Christ right here become visible manifest Among Us he's in a bright body yes he's not in your life individually in his fullness but he's in the portion right yes is the fullness of the spirit of God in this hour it's a full measure a full word yes and to think what did what did that walk on the road to emus do well he met some people on the road to emus that were a little discouraged that's right they were disheartened yes yes they were sad brother BR called them bewildered they couldn't figure out the events that's taking place how do we make sense out of this right that's just nothing has happened the way we thought it ought to happen right that's right brother look where they were going they were going from the presence of the Lord wow they weren't going to Jerusalem they left Jerusalem they were on their way away from Jerusalem and God promised he would pour out his Spirit good Hallelujah but he's a faithful Shepherd Hallelujah he came and he you might have been disheartened yes yes sir you might have been discouraged yes sir you might have looked at your life and said I thought I had something I realized I don't have what I thought I have but remember all of every experience is not in vain he said what do you mean brother Samuel when he came on the road to emus when he came to the end he made us though he would go on but he just as he was talking with them they just their hearts were burning they got to a place that says I'm going to see if this one will be my my friendall to see if they'll friend me and invited him in and when he got in there among them he did something of what he had done before yes said let them know this has been him the whole time hallelujah hallelujah amen and he led them to a place of recovery yes they had fallen from away from in discouragement and disheartenment beautiful he went think about it here he is leading them oh he knows about Peter he knows he knows about Peter he knows he's already told you remember he's already told them and there's already been news coming Peter's already went to the tomb but here he comes in in their midst even after Peter sat in there and saying my you know I I went on a rampage and I went on this I went on that you see he was there to recover them amen from all their discouragement and disheartenment and what was he doing here the presence of the Lord came to them where they were at Hallelujah and would leave them from there the Bible says that he comes after being with them 30 to 40 days he comes out there among them and he leads them to the Mount called he Mak known to them there of his promise go wait go wait in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high in other words this presence that you've experienced the Miracles that you've seen everything that has taken place it's been about you yes the experiences down through life God's hand upon your life has all been god making KN his love and his care for you amen bring you into that place that now as a channel his life flows through amen yes so here they are now in the presence of God directed back to the rightful place they need to be amen isn't it incredible that when you or I could go astray from God's presence and say I don't know I understand I I feel like a failure feel discouraged he listen brother B got to that place in those times too right yes he got to those times but you know what the prince of God would lead him reach out and bring him back into that place where the true identity was at amen even as brother BR was getting ready to go way remember the complex and all and all those things that it developed and there's many other parts that I I love I love those things being uh expressed there in the word to me it's to me it's such encouragement because I see it all the way through the scriptures yes you see that of how that God's presence will come to seek you and I out and bring us back into his presence yes you see you see what a blessing it is that for you that you just don't come into church or at home and you think wow boy I just I just felt the presence of God oh that's wonderful and then continue on what a blessing it is that when his presence comes what's it to do it's to move amen sure when his presence comes it'll bring it brings conviction in our heart right the Bible said when the presence of the Lord came walking in the garden they realized they were naked that's the value of his presence coming right Among Us in the services that's the value of being in his presence Hallelujah even as we walk day to day David said I have set the lord always before me he's at my right hand I shall not be moved it's the value of being in God's presence that God would lead me God would guide me God would direct me where there's things at work things in school things in the family things in the church Lord I want to I want to be led by you yes presence is there to direct us and it's something that it just I'm I'm to me I'm thankful that and I I'm grateful for that that it's not just like boy I felt the presence of God my it just we just go on no but we take that and say Lord when your presence comes Hallelujah you don't waste time Hallelujah but when God is making his presence known as he deals personally and speaks personally to your heart that's God letting you know what he thinks about you he's letting you know what he sees in your life that's deeper than what you can see Hallelujah and the thing that he's wanting just to bring out of our life is to yield to him and then from that moment he will lead us and guide us into all truth amen amen right he's the one who helps us and strengthens us think of how brother Bram standing there with sister mey remember she was all tore up the house you know all the confusion that was in the house and what was taking place but notice what happened is the prophet saw that there was a need that was there his wife was all tore up kids were fighting over blocks it wasn't because his wife was a sister mey was a just a bad woman you know his his his children oh boy they just what it was is the atmosphere had to be changed yes amen and that's when that atmosphere changed and the prophet could stand there as a son of God to me brothers and sisters when I when I read of the storm the snowstorm in Colorado being spoken to I I I may not speak to a snowstorm here that's that's not the storms that I'm worried about right there's storms in my life there's storms that comes in your life yes God took those examples of things that was even forecasting even where brother Brandon could say you brethren need to get on down and out of here because that snow's coming there can be things that's forecast in your life good there can be family strains and things that's down through your life but let me just tell you something there is a living God a Living Word a living presence that God himself changes forecast Hallelujah glory amen his presence is more than enough Hallelujah his presence is who he is it's his word being revealed it changes us from Glory unto Glory yes Hallelujah just as we abide in his presence you know if there's one thing we can say is Lord I may not see in my life what I want to see right now may not see what you have called ordained maybe I can't see all of that fully yet in my life there's one thing that I do know is where I was before I'm no longer there hallelujah hallelujah Glory you see what did that his presence yes and you yielding to his presence and seeing something beyond what you could see hallelujah amen God be to deliver his thoughts to you which was beyond your thoughts of your son glory and that's why he said my thoughts are higher than yours my ways are higher Glory because when God comes he doesn't leave us where he finds us right we might have been going away maybe in maybe even in your in your heart in your spirit maybe for you maybe you've been kind of journeying away from the place that you belong maybe you even in your position even in your even in your way God has called you to be God is his presence comes to draw us right back to that place to say hey don't go away from Jerusalem get back to Jerusalem am amen yes yes Lord I tried to do this and it seems like my family is going this way and I've tried to do this and it seems like instead of instead of instead of becoming overwhelmed and discouraged by the lack of fruit or what you're not seeing just say Lord I I know if it's something that is just been me that's been doing it and I'm asking you to teach my hands Hallelujah I'm asking you to help me Lord and if there has been things that I've been doing right then help me to be patient amen amen glory because you know in your life when we look here in the scriptures perhaps in your Bible to you'll read this you'll see in the New Testament Red Letters black letters red letters is that where the writers would would write this was the words of the Lord Jesus the words were spoken word by word then you have the black letters you know without the black letters you wouldn't have the red letters that's right it makes a way it makes a a point of contrast that's the same God does is he works within your life there's days in our life we can have a lot of black letter days strong together yes good but just be patient Hallelujah day coming amen hallelujah I don't want to just say a day I'll say a moment coming amen because it's just like in your life Enoch as we said and I'm just I'm just trying to come to a spot of closing Enoch walked with God wonder how many black letter days he walked with God but you walk with God and some of the days that you walk with God or I walk with God I don't feel him like I do other days right well then how am I walking with God because I'm walking with his word amen God is his word amen so it's not then about my feelings I love don't get me wrong I love to feel his presence amen I love to see God I love to hear from him love to see him work I love to see testimonies but there are also those times that God brings us to recogniz as we walk with him there's days that are black letter days that lead the red letter moments amen right in order for the fire to come there on Mount carel Elijah had to get the stones together he had to get put the wood in order to put the sacrifice in order but all of that was with the preparation and the presence of God would come visible the amen sometimes of things that God has you doing that maybe don't feel so spiritual so Supernatural right right but it's necessary arrangements yes in order for the presence of God to come down amen yes God knows the need he knows your situation it's mindful yes amen amen that's the authority we have in his presence amen as a son and daughter of God Amen perhaps we'll pick it up just a little bit more here this afternoon let's just bow our heads and our hearts in pray oh Hallelujah I wonder how many be one with an uplifted hand Lord remember me Amen Hallelujah Lord remember me no matter where you're at no matter the journey remember God himself is the one who recovers Resto is the one who renews he's the one who guides us he knows about every need and every situation remember that atmosphere what's happening here even in this moment as we come together as Believers the Bible said we two or three agree as touching any one thing it shall be done he also said he'd be here in our midst so right here in the presence of almighty God this is where situations change you might say Brother Sam you don't know my situation at home well it's not all together at home that maybe needs to change maybe it's your outlook on it maybe it's the attitude maybe there's a channel maybe there's something down there that the Holy Spirit to bring to light and for him to clear out that channel in your life maybe it's for you to become a yielded Channel maybe you're like a wire that you're built to handle the current built to channel it but you've you've not been placed in where you need to be but the Holy Spirit his presence is here to take and to place you just where you need to be that you might be hallelu a Chanel Hallelujah see brother Samuel what Authority is that I want you to understand you've got more Authority than what you think in the presence of almighty God there's a habit that a besetting sin way something that you have not been able to overcome you as a son and daughter of God have an authority right now yes to make that decision and say Lord I'm going to lay this down at your feet Yes Lord that's what the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit brings is a faith to believe that God is that is a rewarder of them diligently seek thank you Jesus why don't you just just let him go through every area every channel every Avenue whatever that need is that you've held behind that hand perhaps it's a need even that you hold in a different light than when you walked in the door maybe there was a different need you had on your heart when unspoken pray request for asked for but now in his presence you see what he sees this is the need in this moment like that man who was bound with the py the need that he had in his life was for his sins to be forgiven what was in The Invisible realm now become interpreted in a visible form take up thy bed and walk be thou l [Music] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you for your word we thank you Lord for your presence Lord right here Among Us Lord God how you have graced us with your grace father to come and to minister Our Lives I say that Lord our lives yes Lord God you are so mindful God hallelujah think of how your Prophet said that Lord sometimes he would say that when maybe some in the congregation when he could see the pastor would see some that would start to stray he said he would stray a little with them certainly didn't mean that Lord that as a pastor Minister that we would go off of the word we see that there are needs yes you make known Among Us Lord our desire is to go and that lives and hearts are recovered Hallelujah recover Lord from that snare from that trap from maybe they're walking away from Jerusalem maybe they're desponded maybe they're bewildered maybe they're so discouraged maybe there's things Lord around them God your presence has draw near yes just to remind them it's you that's given them the strength day by day to put one foot in front of the other it certainly wasn't the enemy that encouraged them to be in the house of God this morning Lord that's an unconscious Fai and here we are and here we stand and where your grace would draw us lead us oh God not away from Jerusalem but back to it and we know Lord in this hour it's not an Earthly Jerusalem that we're called to but it's that New Jerusalem yes Lord it's Paul States it that mother of us all hallelujah oh God land of the Holy Ghost the land of adoption that City that John saw coming down that city was prepared as a bride is prepared for a husband oh God we're called to live out as Sons and Daughters of God we're called lord no matter the situation no matter the vocation of Life help us Lord that we might be a channel in place in position right where you've called us to be Lord help us if there's anything out of place in our life at all anything in our thinking if there's a complex that's hindering us Lord if there's a hurt if there's offense if there's bitterness Lord anything Lord Lord in us that would be hindrance we don't want to feed that anymore we want to feed that white dog Hallelujah we want to feed Lord oh God that son
