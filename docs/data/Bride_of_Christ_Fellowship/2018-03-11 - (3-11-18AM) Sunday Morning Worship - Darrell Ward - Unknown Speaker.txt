Holy Spirit so as we as he comes out saying he knows my name the cinetic [Music] [Music] any here's me where I go you know thank you for Jesus Jesus you know you know yeast feeds each tear that fall he hears me when I call a man isn't that wonderful to know that he knows my name you know the the mayor of Akron Ohio he don't know me the governor of the great state of Ohio he don't know me president Trump knows a lot of people but you don't know me but the God who created the heavens and the earth he knows my name he knows everything about us he knew the color of our eyes before was ever born he wrote our name the prophet of God said he wrote our name and spoke it before there was ever a world then no matter what we faced in life no matter the difficulties or the great victories or sometimes even the defeats he knows all about it amen isn't that wonderful to know that we can cast their cares upon him because he cares for us what a privilege it is to serve a living God this morning you know you go to India and you'll see people they'll fashion a god out of wood or they'll fashion it out of stone or some kind of metal and they'll pack that guard around and every once in a while they'll set this guard down that they made with their hands and they'll worship this God you'll see it right on the side of the road they'll just set it down and start worshipping this God that they made with their hands but I'm so glad this morning that the god I worship I didn't make with my hands but he made me with his hands stay ahead isn't that wonderful a man it is it's not so much me packing him around but it's him packing me a man and so as long as he's holding my hand you know everything will be all right isn't that wonderful may the Lord bless you richly this morning my name is brother Darrell ward from down in Tennessee no southern I'm going down that way and I don't know a whole lot about the Lord Jesus but I sure love to tell what little bit I know I know he's healed me when I was sick he saved me when I was lost man he opened my eyes to what he's doing in this hour and we're grateful for that and to know that he's the same yesterday today and forever and so we want to look at some of those things this morning and I know some of you don't know me but I trust that you can look beyond the veil of not knowing me and see my heart and my desire is not to come and preach something new to you or show you want to know but just to draw you into a closer fellowship with the Lord Jesus a man so that's truly our desire of this morning if you have your Bibles turn with us to the the Book of Luke we want to read there from Luke chapter 1 starting at verse 30 and we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus we appreciate our precious brother Smith allowing us to come this way and to be with you for this weekend and you saw brother Darrell were small in number but you know the Bible says where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their midst and so that's all we needed he managed just me and God is the majority man and so we just look to him this morning that he'll just speak to us through his word amen amen the Bible says this and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God isn't that wonderful and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great he should be called the son of the highest the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end that's the kingdom I want to belong to this morning then said Mary under the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born to be shall be called the Son of God and behold that cousin Elizabeth also conceived a son in her old age this is the six-month with her who was called barren I love the scripture right here for with God nothing shall be impossible hey man and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the Bible says and the angel departed from her you see when Mary received the angel's message then the angel departed from her amen let's bow our heads I want to speak to you this morning or just a simple thought of it's me it's me Heavenly Father we greet these people this morning in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus father we bow in the presence of that great name knowing Lord that heavens and earth will pass away yet your word shall never fail Lord the promises of your word are just as true today as they were when you spoke them Lord are there situations in kingdoms and times and people's unbelief will never hinder thy word from being fulfilled Lord or you said it would not return unto you void but will to accomplish that which it was sent to do the Lord we believe that the prophet of God has come in this hour and he told us Lord we become the word as we receive the word it's the word becoming flesh and the flesh becoming word oh God may we hold these promises true in our hearts dear God knowing Lord you will bring him swiftly the past bless you people today Lord opened the Bible to us dear God for Lord we know any man can open the Bible and read but only you Lord can quicken it Lord and give us the divine revelation and interpretation of your word father may it not just be hearers of the word as James said but may we be doers of that which we hear Lord may we take it into our hearts and speak it back up on our lips for you said their God through your prophet when the son of God my faith takes the Word of God into his heart speaks it back upon his lips it's just the same as deity speaking every mountain has to move o God do great things among us today Lord we pray may we leave Lord with a greater unction and the greater zeal and a greater desire and a greater revelation because you have met with us today bless the people here father God may your anointing Lord use them a signs and wonders be rolled at the hands of the believers father where this is the hour of the manifestation of the third pool these are the things you said you would do in your bride God we believe Lord we are a part of that by grace but we ask these sayings Jesus name and the bride says hey man god bless you you may be seated amen I want to start with this morning with a little quote and kind of just build of what we want to look at for a few minutes of the Lord I help us but the brother BAM says this he says now notice when Israel began to cry for their deliverance and God began to hear and provided a way of escape and sent Moses to them so here we see Israel begin to cry for deliverance and God heard their cry for the livers and provided a way of escape he sent to them Moses and the prophets said how strange it was after crying for deliverance and when deliverance was brought to them they failed to recognize it and refused it and had to suffer forty years more forty more years they suffered in bondage before they realized that the limits that they had salt the delivers that they had desired the deliverance that they had cried for forty more years they suffered in bondage because they failed to recognize it had already been given so what do we learn from this what we learn from this is no matter how great the revelation is no matter how rich the anointing is no matter how great the gift would be that God would send among us if we don't recognize it's for you it will do you no good the Bible said I am the Lord that God that healeth thee but if you don't have the understanding that that word is speaking to you it'll do you no good if you don't recognize that this word is for me all the great revelations all the greater north no matter how great the man would be that God would send among us if we don't realize it's for me it's me the word is speaking of me you see we're living in an hour of identification many year ago when I was a young man started traveling preaching I didn't have to show identification to get on a plane I just got my ticket at the counter and went and got on the plane but now we're living in the hour that you have to be identified everybody has to be identified with who they are amen and so we're living in the hour of identification now the Prophet said in the message perfect faith that faith is based on forgiveness faith is based on forgiveness before you can ever have faith in the Word of God you must first believe that the word is for you you see the revival your revival is when you recognize the word is speaking of you we're living in this hour of identification then we must also have a scriptural identification and our scriptural identification must be found in the Word of God because the word body must be built upon a word frame can you say amen to that they may so then I revival would be when we see ourselves identified in the Word of God when you look into the pages of the Bible and you say it's me the word is speaking of me now love is addition of Christ in the church Christ is now in the church recognizing reconciling the people to God he promised to do it it's been written and he's the same yesterday today and forever II said do you believe that he said I believe it with all my heart he's just now waiting to be called on the scene now the only thing that can call him on the scene is for us to awaken him in ourselves to call him on the scene amen now the Prophet talked about the Welsh revival you remember that a buncha man from the United States went over the West and they wanted to see this revival they wanted to know what God was doing they wanted to experience the Welsh revival and so they see a policeman standing on the street corner and they won't get to the policeman he was singing a song he was whistling a tune but would you to notice they never went to the policeman to get directions to the Welsh revival because he was a policeman they went up to the policeman to get directions to the revival because they heard him whistling a Christian song and they gave to the policeman they said sir were from the United States and we've heard of this great revival and we want to experience the revival can you tell us where is the Welsh revival he never gave him a GPS location he never said don't do blood turn right or left behind the library there's a little bit he never said that but when they said sir we want to see the Welsh revival you know what he said you're looking at it the words revival it's me it's me I am the world's revival Oh God if we can only understand that today that we are the reflection of Jesus Christ His Word made manifest you are the reflection of his word what is the world's revival what building is it in is it sure it's in my heart he was the Welsh revival and today the brother said today that the church ought to be Jesus Christ manifested in flesh Christ in action in his people not just a bunch of quotas no there's let the road with quote but it's more than quote that God's looking for more than just somebody that oh but he's looking for somebody who can take the word Howard and make that word live the message of the hours more than quote books though we thank God for quote books the message of the hour is more the tapes though we thank God for tapes but the message of the hour of God's coming for is not my Bible not my tape player but he's coming for me amen because the word has been made fresh in my heart amen hallelujah see God don't need my ability God don't need my education thank God cuz ain't got much but what God does need is my skin amen you see God wants turkey knows God won't stay empty himself into us all God was important to Christ and all Christ is he has poured into the church Christ as the mystery of God revealed but the bride is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah what are we the branch the branch another book of Acts amen amen he was so full of the Wealth's revival till he was the Welsh revival and we ought to be so full of Christ do we reflect him in the power of the word that's allotted for us in this game amen do you love you miss water we're supposed to be the light of this age manifesting the gospel Luther was the light in this day Wesley was the light in their day Pentecost was light in their day let were further up the road now we're coming into the bride we're coming into the called out the elected the probably said remember if you are you're just like that officer he had he need him and if you're the bride Oh God if you're the caught out if you're the elect if you're the one he likes you come to find yes you've got it in you it's who you are friends you see the bride's revival is the opening of the work that stirs her for she sees her position for the word in the hour you see I will to understand this one we're not just part of the move we are the move some touches the revelation in the word and she cries it's me the word is speaking of me you see the seven churches it's God dealing with the church that's what it's called Church Aegeus but this is the last stage so whatever God's going to do in these people you see if no God wanted to do what's in the profit we would have done rapture because the profit is coming down so there must be something else God wants to do in this hour more than give a revelation of the coming of Elijah brother Branham played his part but now you've got to play your part hey man hallelujah so the seven churches is God dealing with the church whatever he's going to do he must do it in those seven ages amen because when the church ages is he will never call another Gentile can you say man it makes sure then we see whatever God must be do because now we're here and because his was in the homeland waiting to receive the Messiah but before they can ever receive the Messiah he's got to pull the bride off the earth so whatever he's going to do to accomplish his word at the end time he must do it where he must do it in you he must do it with he must do it with people Amen because what did he use the first church age people what did he use in the second church age people then what will he use in the last stage people amen amen hallelujah you see the key to the whole thing is to fall in love to fall in love with Jesus huh let's see how much we can know though we should study the word you understand what I'm saying but you know I know a man one time could quote the but you could start a scripture he could finish it no matter where it was that in the Bible you can open up your Bible turn your scripture he'll finish that scripture and the man didn't even serve the Lord so it's not just what we know with our head it's not how much we can quote it's not how much we can memorize if I fall out that window I'll be back amen it's that's no but it's having a relationship with Christ it's not how much we can know that we should know it it's not a mess we can quote though we should quote it but how much can we love you see the oil will know that we're Christians not not how much we quote but the way we'll know that we're Christians by I love God is love when you love right everything else falls into place love produces confidence confidence produces trust amen faith cometh by hearing hearing is not faith but faith cometh by hearing you understand I was just in first two weeks ago and after service the people came up they were excited and they were trying to talk to me I heard every word they said but I never heard nothing they said because they spoke so they didn't understand for each though I heard them I did not understand but are your ears a mess for you hear what's being said in this hour we're not earning on no tongue we not heard a thunder we weren't a voice oh boy the god I feel like how do we get excited where I'm from zone if I take off run and sit still I'll be back amen glory to God hallelujah thank imma be hearing hearing by the Word of God when you trust in what the word is saying to you see you'll find whether there's a lack of the SAR to forgive you'll find there's a lack of love people do things and say things to one another there's no remorse cuz there's no love amen and where there's no love there's no forgiveness and where there's no forgiveness there's no faith for faith is based on forgiveness that all right so the Prophet said we're living in the hour that the Lord would be so far away in the last days that the only lip that would be left would be between the elect of God's people friends that's the hour that we're living in we're living in the hour herself love has took the place of the true love of God the Prophet said it would be that way Southworth people loving their self more that's the age were living in that's why in 2013 the word of the year you know every year Webster's or Oxford Dictionary they pick a word want one and early on the European side of the earth and one on this side of there a word that most reflects the people one word to represent the entire of the on the Western and the eastern sides of the world but in 2013 because of the increase of this one word they chose this one word to represent the entire world and that worked selfie selfie if you look at our pictures my family pictures of my wife and their girls when my girls were small you'll think my wife was the winner because I'm not in the picture there's my wife there's my girl says my wife there's my girls where's where's brother Dale I was taking the picture but not anymore now we got a selfie stick but you see it's the spirit of the age finish do you know there's actually workshops that you can go to three-day workshops to learn to love yourself because it's the the age this is where we are at friends amen amen love would be so far away the only love left would be between the elect you see well there's love there's forgiveness Jesus expressed that on the cross when his blood was poured out like water and they beat him until his face was marred more than any man's face had ever been Lord and yet he looked upon those who done that to him and he loved them and he said Father forgive him for when there's love there's forgiveness Joseph looked upon his brothers who sold him into slavery threw him in a pit but he looked upon them and he forgave them because he loved them thank you brother he forgave him because he loved him think of it this morning for his the Bible said that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us he reached out in the muck and he lifted us up and he loved us we who were unlovable yeah he loved me think of it Christ passed over millions to touch you to show you that he loved you then we gonna have confidence in what His Word says if he let me enough to die for me then he loves me enough to heal me he loves me enough to save me he loves me enough to talk for me hallelujah if he's healthy enough to suffer for me a man then that genuine love produces confidence the confidence that he's forgiving me and when I realized that I'm forgiven what does that produce faith for faith is based upon forgiveness they made a face and what the word says I am oh yeah what the word says I am by the blood of the Lamb of God amen where I've got so many faults I've got so many fell I do too I do too but the figure that it is he don't see me he sees the blood and the bread is perfect then I can have faith in what the word says I am by the blood of Jesus it's not based on emotion not based on sensation there's days I don't feel saved just like you those days I don't feel healed just like you but I'm not here because I feel like it I'm not saying because after I'm saved because I met God's requirements over you see we was like the eagle that was in the barnyard we tried to walk like a chicken cook like the chicken eat like a chicken because that's what we thought we were when we had staff that's all we ever saw was chicken but momma remembered that she had a little one and she began to fly and she flew over the burger and she let out a scream and when she had the voice with junior heard the voice he thought what did he see he saw the wings he saw her talons he saw imagistic head he looked at that and he looked at himself he looked at that and he looked at himself and he said it's me it's me that's who I am and I found out I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brennan but I'm a son of God I'm an attribute of God you see Jesus had perfect faith amen he had perfect faith how why because he realized what he was he knew he was loved of the Father and he relied and known he was the word and he had faith in the God who made him the word you see he knew what he was there for he relied upon what God had made him he recognized himself in the written word he willing to the temple on the seventh day as it was custom and the priest hadn't even screw either submit I you know I didn't law school preachers more than a s'mizza sing a few more so let me see if I can something here ain't God doesn't prepared he never done that but the priest had him screwing the Bible said he found the place it was written concerning who himself and he said he had the boy did me and he closed the book kind of get back to the priest and the eyes of all the people in the temple was on him and he began to say this death scripture is fulfilled in your ears if you allow me to give a hillbilly translation what he really said was it's me hallelujah it's me the Lord has become flesh oh he resided knowing what he was he was the word and had faith in the God who made him the word thing can't we rely upon what God made us what did God make us believers the word says the believer shall lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover these signs shall follow them that believe are you believer or you believer then who's he talking about it's all about you your national fellow down at home I said so we won't ask you a question he said alrighty ask away said sir why are you a believer it's a lot cz I believe he said well but we understand that but why do you believe oh that's easy I believe because I'm a believer certainly understand we understand that you're a believer but what we're trying to find out is why are you a believer oh that's easy because I believe believers believe that's why they're called believers do you believe do you believe you're not sure yet do you believe if you believe that who's the scripture talking about these signs shall follow them that mean that's the Word of God yet faith in what he was just a this simple three days I raised him how can he say that how could anybody say such a thing as that because the Lord said that he was only saying what the word said he knew David wasn't speaking about himself David's all corruption Freddy knew David hallelujah I'm the man of 19 were speaking of him he was famous of what David spoke Oh God let that cook into us this morning to recognize herself in the scriptures to be able to say it's me the word is speaking of me now brother Ben who told several different times of the story of the little boy who saw himself in a mirror now why do you reckon he told us that story you ever thought about that you reckon Billy Paul come to you say no daddy you know we know you like to save money and you you know you want to take care of God's money in it and you're leaving twenty thirty minutes left on tapers or some kind of story you can tell to kind of fill up some tape space I don't believe that I believe if brother Brian was telling us the story of a little boy in a mirror it was something he wanted us to understand can you say Amanda there I don't think he just told it to be telling this but there's something there he wanted us to understand amen now he told the story I got the looking how many times he told it in the last three times that he told it it just really struck me he told the story in the message identification 63 then he told it again in 1964 in the message things that are to be and the last time the Prophet ever spoke this story was in 1965 in a message titled leadership ito the story he comes down to his grandmother's house never saw a mirror before in his life and on the back of the door there was a mirror and the boy was kind of lonesome you know now trying to find something to do and he shut the door and all of a sudden there was a mirror and he looked in the mirror there was a little boy so he tried to make friends with the little fella because he was lonely though oh that's some money to play with so he waved and the boy way back and he grinned and the boy greenback he made a funny face and the boy made a funny face and he kept getting closer and the puppet said his mom and his grandma was watching him and he got closer and closer and finally he touched the mini jib back is it my mother it's me it was him the whole time it was here the whole time he just recognized it he just talked the revelation the boy in the mirror is me and the problem said that's what we want to do tonight I want to look at me and I want you to look at yourself as we look into God's great mirror of his word let's be able to identify ourselves with son that we're going to speak about some of the characters of other times I want to see myself in God's looking-glass because if anything will show you where you're standing it's this book he said I'm sure we ought to find ourselves in some character of the Bible we ought to be able to find ourselves and some character of the Bible so that we would know the outcome of that character then we would know what our outcome would be think about this we can look at that character and whatever the outcome would be we would know that would be our outcome I'm sure tonight we ought to find herself somewhere in some character of the Bible then we know the outcome of that character and then you know what your outcome would be by knowing their outcome we would know our outcome and I thought did anybody ever really do that has anybody ever really done what the Prophet said who somebody looked into a character of the Bible and identified herself with that character and said their outcome should be mild good and I got to looking and I found it the black woman down in Memphis her son had got out and got a social disease and he was dying of syphilis and she got down to pray and she said Lord I was like the shoot-'em-up woman I couldn't have a son but you gave me a son and I tried to raise him the best of knew how Lord but he's got out and he's got this disease and he's dying and she said Lord if I'd be like the shooter might woman where is your Elijah and the portly was in an airplane headed towards Lexington Kentucky in other words I don't know exactly what happened but we'll just say perhaps this happened that they were flying along and all of a sudden the light come on in the cockpit and the captain turns to the co captain says see what the light is and he opens up the manual and he looks at it and he's in land immediately where's the closest airport Memphis Tennessee Oh God how about the Hubble spell they landed the plane and Memphis put the prophet up in the Peabody Hotel the next morning he goes out the melon postcard and the Holy Spirit says stop turn around start walking now he had to catch a plane but he was obedient to the Spirit of God and he was walking and he found himself in the black neighborhood and he was singing I'm one of them and as he's walking down the road singing I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them there she stood by the gate she had a shirt tile around her head her back was wet from the do and when he came walking by she said morning parson and he says parson how did you know I was a preacher she said not only that's her I know she's coming since you're supposed to have a satchel where's your satchel he said I left it in the room now for people who believe not only speaks to prophets who told her that come on somebody she knew more about what was happening than he did it wasn't him telling her it was her telling him and you know the story the probably we need to pray for the boy and God raised the ball up why she identified herself with some character in the Bible and the outcome of God given her that boy was the same outcome she experienced earlier Jeremiah 29:11 says this I know the thoughts I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end the amplified version of that scripture says I know the thoughts and plans I have for you says the Lord thoughts and plans of welfare and peace and not for evil to give you hope in your final outcome you've already got a final outcome God already hoga God already knows the end from the beginning at embryo Smith last night my brother he gave me a video here a few years ago of a Tennessee football game I only ever watched football ain't got time for that but he said would you like to see I said yeah I'll look at it well not then new Tennessee won the game I said where Smith last night but the first quarter they were behind I didn't get upset they made a bad fumble the other team recovered I never got upset the referee made a bad call I didn't throw my hat down the screen what's the matter with you I didn't get upset you know why cuz I already knew I already knew the outcome I already knew they won the game so matter how bad it look they might have been down 49 to nothing but I knew the outcome and let me say borrow you knows you're out loud look in the back of the book this morning we win Oh hallelujah you were in a stinking at the beginning the promise said if you go to eternal out there's only one form of eternal life eternal life has no beginning it has no ending if you've got eternal life you were an attribute of God's taken before there was anything but him your eyes your statue whatever you were you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing you are is an expression an expression of that word after he thought it he spoke it and here you are so what are we the expression of the thought of God he spoke you into existence to match that thought God took a picture of you it's in his family album and ever once what our son of God will come on the earth they go there he is it right there is you were there but you see that'll do you no good if you if you don't believe that well I've got so many problems that may be true no brother you understand I don't just have problems I've got big problems that may be true I'm not denying that we live in a rough time we may have big problems but I'm just here to tell you we've got a bigger God and God's bigger than our problems and I want you to understand no matter what you're going through it no matter what you're suffering right now you were there in his thinking you're naming all in he by foreknowledge ordained you to see this he or they need to see this the Prophet said and if you're not ordained you'll never see it if you're not ordained you'll never see it but I ask you of all the people in Akron Ohio there was more at the restaurant last night than they are here all the people that why are you here why are you here don't let the devil beat you up put him in his place you're here because God ordains you to be here amen we're here because we see these things this feeds my soul hey CDC don't feed my soul Alice Cooper don't feed my soul all these other they don't feed my soul but the Word of God amen those are ordained we'll see it those are not will never seen just be kind to him just love them but they'll never see it but the Prophet said remember in the name of the Lord Jesus the hour is here the hour is here to do what brother brother the hour is here to see these things let me ask the stuff there where was the mysteries of God hid where were they hid all down through the ages the mysteries of God where he had where he kept them in his mind Moses was able to go back to the beginning that's as far as he could go when he started writing he wrote in the beginning you know why that's as far back as he could go but we're living in the hour that God had another prophet and he allowed that prophet to go beyond the beginning into the mind of God and bring these things out and make these things known to us why for thousands of years of God keeping the mystery within himself why would he all of a sudden make it known it would has to be because of people who own the earth who can receive those mysteries hallelujah amen brother Smith loves his kids he loves his kids but would you give that little girl the keys to the car tell her to go and get your soda they know away she's not able to handle the keys she may play with them in the nursery but she'll never put them in the ignition unless you were to call allstate and tell them you got an accident on your hands you know what I'm saying she's not able to handle the key in the ignition but as they mature there come a day we'll get the boy the car to go to the market don't you see the mysteries of God was in his mind but now they're made known why for some people on the earth whose return by the world who can take the things that are said who can look at the mysteries and say it's me it's me hallelujah the word mirror reveals to us our word image like the little boy we look into the mirror and we say it's me it's me that moment that you recognize yourself that you you are in the vision when you see their image in the mirror of his word when you realize your the expression of his thought you're a part of the vision however you want to say God had a dream and you was in it God had a vision however you want to say whatever adjectives if I don't that's the right word or not I told you ain't took smart but whatever words you want to put together to express that can we understand that this morning that God dreamed the dream and I am what he dreamed God had a thought I'm the expression of it God had a program I'm a part of it God had a painting I'm in it however you want to look at it if you can see that this morning that moment that you realize I am a part of the vision is that possible can a son and daughter of God actually see their self in the vision can you see yourself and the vision if I show you what yeah man it don't lie now you're in church prayer line 1953 Wilmes seems to be going for me she's in a hospital or a doctor's office or a hospital room or something she's being examined and the personal nurse on a it's it's on her left side and there's a middle-aged man and it's it's it's a tumor and it's in the left side of the woman there's two doctors there one says it's to be operated on another says it can't be operated on so he's gonna believe doctors are gone there's two doctors both of them disagree I'll take what God said I'll take what the word says you know your people say well my doctor said not doctor said it's the worst case he ever seen my doctor says my doctor would you realize 100 doctors graduate from medical school one of them graduated number 100 [Laughter] and that might be your doctor hello you'll always get the number one you notice on the office they don't have which position they graduated it thank God for doctors I worked with doctors for years I system in surgery I did thousands of operation I operated on people I went to church with I did their gallbladders I've did the carotid endarterectomy stoled them I know you inside now so we thank God for doctors but when the doctors say they can't help us when the doctor said in the Lord they do I'm so glad we're day another doctor a man well as one says the Bible never says it came is that the truth was that right I see something moving she you've been prayed for before in a meeting it's an evangelistic meeting there's a man that's kind of dark headed thin hair why it was me I prayed for you you had a tumor in the brain and you were healed I see a lot flash around you you're healed with the tumor in the brain you're not from the city here from Illinois's is that right go home the Lord Jesus makes you will he saw himself you've been prayed for before you've been in another meeting somewhere it was an evangelistic meeting a man kind of small thin why it was me I prayed for you divine healing 54 I trust you give you the Czar of your heart knowing you're a Christian you're not a critic you're a firm believer in what I'm talking about in that way I can help you the first thing you're a woman suffering with a woman's trouble a female condition you may not know this yes you do though you do know it you have trouble in your head which is cancer and it's on the brain but God will make you well you see I see you sometimes sitting just holding your hands like this you've been in another meeting somewhere he was holding yourself breathless it was something that was taking place at a platform now he's describing what he's seeing he was in a meeting somewhere you're holding yourself there's something happening at the platform why it's me it's me it was Portland Oregon when the maniac was condemned I see him fall on the floor now and roll he saw that repeat again in a vision because the woman was in that meeting and when he broke into that room he saw a vision of that meeting in Portland Oregon saw the woman sitting there and saw himself on the platform and he said it's me it was me how was the one on the platform he saw himself in the vision and you said you would a minute it's me I'm the vision the vision like the green checkered shirt and the caribou remember the story when I was studying this mrs. Lord gave me this message a while back on an airplane and I called Billy Biscoe 507 was brother ate his precious brother and I called brother and I said brother and he would you tell me about the green checkered shirt and he said brother down said I will tell you he said a month before that happened brother Brennan called me about coming up there and hunting and he told me the vision on the phone he said brother doll it meant nothing to me it was just another vision that he had he said brother Eddie he said brother now he told me the vision on the phone I'm not before it happened but it meant nothing to me you know why he didn't recognize he was a part of it it was just a vision but you know the story he goes hunting he gets up that morning he's going across the log he sleeps he falls into a creek thanks just the worst thing that ever happened to him Here I am trying to hunt the first thing I get drenched he goes into the tin it's dark he reaches into a bag he pulls out a shirt he puts it on he hunts all day he glasses he eats his lunch he prays he fellowships with the brothers but towards that time when the prophets shot the caribou and they measured across the horns and it was 42 inches and brother Brennan said enough somebody should have a green checkered why brother Eddie I didn't know I didn't know it's me the green checkered shirt it's me what's the one in the fish he said brother down it was months it was much later before it truly sunk in to me what had happened he said I told Ruth to throw that shirt away but she slipped it in bank but you see he was the green checkered shirt today when we talk about the green checkered shirt we all know that's brother ad misko you know why because it happened it was manifested it was made known were they friends the things I'm talking about this morning will become a reality to us such a reality it'll change the very atoms of our bodies do you love him I think that clocks roamers let's hurry amen a team that any trifling take that air away from us Lester right no matter what time you went to bed he was already an hour late yeah you're right hey hallelujah now let's just look at a scripture will close the prophet of God said you know brother man no my kid could bring these things out like good Murph said the day before this event took place he said Mary and Joseph were sitting on the porch between services you know and he pray that a little drum and he said you know said Mary said Oh Joseph said wasn't the rabbi's spot on this morning maja wasn't that a message he said oh I've never heard such preaching I can't marry it was tremendous so they sent her said you know Joseph said what do you want to do they said let's just read a few scriptures it says all that's wonderful Mara she said I'll go get him it probably should go down and henna a stand like an umbrella stand and they they put the scrolls down in that stand and she just reaches in and pulls one out but you see the footsteps of the righteous or ordered of the Lord she just reaches into all these folks she pulls one out she comes out on the porch she gives it to Joseph Joseph opens it up and he begins to read from Isaiah a virgin shall conceive and as he's reading the scriptures Mary begins to hear the word and Joseph said Joseph Abba said Mary said the Zap scripture means something to you said I notice ever since I started reading it that's just a glow about you said I always thought she's the prettiest woman in the valley but my you're even prettier now so what is that she said Joseph what did I say of me what did he mean a virgin shall conceive Joseph I said yes he gave her a profound answer to her question Joseph and he said dear I don't know I don't know I don't know what the Prophet meant but there's one thing I do know that if God spoke it it will come to pass I don't have to understand it if God said it would happen it would happen I don't understand all the ins and outs do you I don't understand I don't know how God made my daughter walking in which she was crippled in the accident they said she'd never walk again she'd never stand up I don't know how God done that I don't know how God opened her blinded eyes which she couldn't see in the doctor said you'd never see again there's nothing to see with the whole back of her brain was dead from the stroke I don't know how he made her see I don't have to understand how a big God keeps his word he's all there he can do anything that he says he will do God will keep his word she was going home unnie the Prophet said it was a blue wash day if she was going alone thinking about these scriptures thinking about the prophet of God said it's when you think about him that's what he appears we think so much about our troubles we think so much about our woes but if we spend our time thinking about Jesus when the two on the road to Emmaus when I was thinking about Jesus that's when he stepped out and started walking with whom she was thinking about these scriptures she's thinking about these things and she heard a flicker of light the Prophet said it caller attention and she turned the corner there's another flicker of light and when she got to the place where the only she could pass through quit was just her and the angel not her and her mom and not her and her brother not her but just her alone the angel appeared to her said he'll marry now it's highly favored of God amen little woman in the MENA City there was in the world at that time and all the Palestine but she lives such a life until God chose her for a certain work he was going to do she looked right into the face of the messenger it's dawn now that I a favorite of God she see God chose her she never pollen teared but we would pick me pick me pick me let me know sir she wasn't looking for God God came looking for her don't you see my brother my sister we were looking for Elijah Elijah come looking for us she knew just the day before she was reading there as they announced six she knew something was happening she knew then it was scriptural she knew the angels message of Scripture let me tell you something sister I don't follow this message because of a cloud I don't follow this message because a bridge that happened I don't follow it because of their I follow it because I see that it's a scriptural promise that in the last days he will do these things and this ministry matches that description I'll follow it because I see it in the word I love follow signs and wonders sighs he wonders follow me hey man hallelujah amen she knew she just read before Isaiah 9:6 she knew something was happening she thought about the porch she thought about the scriptures and it was at that moment that she realized it was me it's me it's me Isaiah was speaking about me I am who I say I saw in the vision Oh glory to God all those hundreds of years before Isaiah had spoken prophecy said probably not even understanding what he was saying and that word circled the earth for years until that moment in time when the season was right and the word found its proper place she said I am who has a asau to the vision I am what he wrote humble written word of the Prophet manifested on the earth you see I'm closing God sent an angel messenger to her to reveal to her that she was the prophets prophesy she fulfilled the vision she was the vision big man I am what Isaiah saw no matter how crazy it was to the world no matter how crazy it was when she began to tell people I don't want to have a baby oh I didn't know you and Joseph's Mary Joseph got nothing to do with this okay Maria you'll be all right take this little peel but you see it wasn't too long just a couple of months or so till she started manifesting what she was confessing you see the had left the profit and it was now on his prophecy God sent a messenger to tell her she was the vision and when she received that message she said be it unto me be it unto me hey man hallelujah what did the Angels messenger do what did the Angels message do it came with a great light and it caused her to refocus what did the angel of messenger do in this hour it came with a great light a great vindication what as it caused us to do to refocus he said I lo longer call you church I call you Brian amen amen Eliezer searching out a bride for Isaac think of it just a minute as we close if brother Branham tops Eliezer it's searching out types the message because that's what God sent to searches out was the message Eliezer was the messenger the message was what he was searching out with so Isaac is a type of the bridegroom Jesus Christ brother Branham tops Eliezer the searching out tops the message of the hour Isaac types the bridegroom then I ask you my brother my sister who's Rebecca who's Rebecca that's right sister brother Rams got his part Isaac's got his part but somebody's got to be Rebecca and can we say this morning by revelation I am the one he came looking for behold I send you elijah the prophet it's me I'm the one he died for it's me I'm the one he was strike for it's me I'm the one he's coming for it's me it's I'm the one he lives of the wood he thought of of the wood can you see it can you say it can you say it for yourself it's me he was speaking of me this is who I am this is what I got to say it for yourself you've got to express it it's the spoken word age what does the Bible say let the redeemed of the Lord say so say so not not her head not raise her hand though there's nothing wrong with that I'm not kicking against that but the Bible says let the redeemed of the Lord say so why there is power in a spoken word let the redeemed of the Lord say so speak it out there is power in the tongue for the Bible said out of your own mouth you will be justified and out of your own mouth you will be condemned so brother the other day backs to the Lord I run into him at the airport he said I'm gonna tell you some things said you'll probably condemn me I said I'm not going to condemn you I said I'm not going to condemn you I'm not going to do that I you're my buddy you're my friend you'll always be my friend I said I don't have to condemn you you'll condemn yourself by the words you speak that's true true don't put it on me to condemn you condemned his ownself he's once said it didn't believe it no more out of his own mouth he confessed it but that's for me in my house I'll serve the Lord speak it out express it hi I'm the woman at the world don't you see my brother my sister find yourself in the Bible find that character in the Bible identify yourself with that character there outcome will be your outcome don't you see how blessed do you not see how blessed Enoch was a blessing not was that Enoch left the earth without tasting death you know why he did that because he was typing you hallelujah how pretty she was he was the anti-type of the time God showed in Enoch what he's gonna do in you I am the woman at the world that Jesus came to I am Rebecca that Eliezer sought out I have that received the token message I am married that received the word of the Lord I am the little woman hallelujah hurry see the mill barrel that never end by spiritual food in due season hallelujah it's me come Ismail club they were typing out me I see my reflection in the mirror of the word can you catch it this morning can you catch it just water can you say it's ringing this day these scriptures are fulfilled tell me sir tell me sir where is the Welsh revival tell me sir could you tell me sir where is the bronze revival it's me it's you this mortise do you love him do you believe it this morning can you receive it this morning but facing God's words well brother I don't feel it I just don't feel what you're told but I just don't feel it good I'm so glad you don't feel it because Jesus never said did you feel it but he did say do you believe it all things are possible [Applause] the scripture in Luke come I'm close enough you're just a wonderful group to preach to this scripture in Luke when my daughter was hurt in the accident to her my families killed struck my train and my baby was laying in a hospital room doctors gave us no hope of over 75% of her brain was damaged in the accident and my wife god bless her so my wife was kneeling beside the bed of our little girl and she was praying she was praying to God about our daughter and the Lord spoke this scripture here in Luke chapter 1 every time I read it it just touches my heart she said the Lord spoke that scripture she got up and opened the Bible and read it and it said for with God nothing shall be impossible this is who we are this is what we are the Word of God will not return into him void it's me it's me I am the dream that he dreamed I am the vision that he saw he wrote and spoke my name before there was ever a world he knows my name he knows everything you wrote it out through the prophets and now we are the fulfilment don't you see my brother my sister we will have vindicate malachi for luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 we will prove to the world that brother Branham was that Elijah's awesome it won't be a website it won't be a website it will be a newspaper article because you can find a newspaper article they'll just argue about something else it won't be a newspaper article that will have vindicate him come on somebody it won't be something that they find in a library somewhere that I vindicate him but what will have vindicate his ministry to be from God it's when we become what he said and the Bible said once more of the world we're here from God it'll be through his bride she will be the final voice through the final age this is our hour arise and shine do you love you let's bow our heads
