========================================

got a thought from Sunday when brother Dukes was preaching so I want to incorporate that into this sermon here today by God's grace Romans chapter 2 verse 1 will read verses one through four Romans chapter 2. verse 1. Hallelujah I'll read verses one two and three and then we can read verse four together here by God's grace therefore thou are inexcusable old man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judges another thou condemn us thyself for thou that judges do us the same things verse two but we are sure that the Judgment of God is a coordinated truth against them which commit such things and think is thou this o man that judges them which do such things and do us the same that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God let's read verse 4 together just beautiful scripture One Two Three or despises thou The Riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance praise God may God add His blessings word may be seated praise God Hallelujah all right so we want to start here in Romans Chapter 2 just preaching through this book of the Bible here let me pull my Bible out there's a scripture I just told him and we'll keep going here by the grace of God I couldn't think of where Jesus said about Judge judging so again it's good to see brother Ray There by God's grace sir praise God good to see you Hallelujah okay yeah there we go so we're starting here in chapter 2 verse one and I want to Lord will and get to this thought eventually I want to get to the thought of reaping and sowing here tonight I'll be the kind of like the subtopic but I want to preach through this first part of this chapter here we preach through all of chapter one hope that was a blessing there by the grace of God uh seeing this wonderful scripture here just on a side note I taught our Arrowhead Elementary students to memorize Romans 1 16. so I was really really proud of them I think three or four actually memorized the verse there so it's really encouraging to see them testify there and memorize the scripture by God's grace so chapter 2 verse one therefore thou are inexcusable o man whosoever thou that judges for wherein thou judges another thou condemneth thyself for thou that judges do us the same things praise God now remember this is uh following uh chapter one of course and we just finished with that uh two Wednesdays ago last Wednesday we looked at the arrow of Deliverance praise God and Lord willing here it was on just on a side note it was wonderful to see how God delivered sister Naomi and those requests that she had right just speaking the word of God and trusting God that was really wonderful to see her get there with safe travel and God allowed her not to get the jab praise God Hallelujah so we thank the Lord for that so uh here Paul is now he's he's making this uh argument here here how uh he's going to get into this thought of how a gentile pagans are no better than other pagans and then he's going to show how legalistic Jews are no better than pagans right remember Paul is writing to a church in Rome where uh it was Jewish and Gentile but then the emperor got rid of the Jews right he expelled the Jews for five years no Jews were allowed in Rome and then after five years they come back and and now the churches uh is it was well now it's it was mostly Gentile right for those five years and of course no Jews were allowed but they had forgotten a lot of the Jewish practices right or a lot of the Jewish word and now that Paul writes to him now they're having trouble between Jew and Gentile so Paul writes the letter to solve the problems in the church how many believe that these letters still solve all of our problems no doubt about it praise God as you know just take a brief thought you know uh Gentiles struggle I'm sorry the book of The Book of Galatians shows how that church struggle struggled with legalism right the Ephesus Church they were deeper but they still needed instruction especially on marriage right Ephesians chapter five Hallelujah and then the fivefold ministry there in Ephesians chapter four they needed that type of instruction uh the Philippians and the Colossians need an encouragement not so much from physical persecution but the spiritual deception that people were trying to bring upon them right and that relates a lot to us right we don't have physical battles at least not yet but we battle spiritual wickedness in high places right right and then the Corinthian Church was very carnal right they were very carnal they had uh people that weren't mourning over sexual sin in the church uh they would speak in tongues so much and they would have so many tongues interpretations there was too many and there was confusion and Paul had to set that in order in other words and then they were arguing about who's the best preacher they're always worried about who's the best preacher right Apollo cephas and so see church we can kind of see how every church needs a certain type of a message right our church when preachers come here they're going to preach in a certain way right where they might not have to preach that at another church so brother Diggs brother Diggs didn't have to preach to us about you guys need to sing to sing more you guys need to worship more right you'd have to preach on that so what did he preach to us he preached us about the sovereignty of God to trust in God right uh to to trust in the The Covenant of God hallelujah that God's going to bring us through amen hallelujah I think it's a blessing praise God I think it's a blessing that the Holy Ghost will give us the word that we have need of in the due season Hallelujah so you watch that you know you and as you listen to others you know sermons from other preachers you can see uh what they have need of you know what do the churches have need of and so our our need at this moment there was trusting in God's sovereignty and trusting in the promise of God in other words don't give up on God hallelujah Hallelujah we worship God we sing to God we love God we love one another but then we have needs as well and the Holy Spirit always is faithful to give us that which we have need of Amen and so uh here uh the book of Romans here Paul is going to he's going to uh unite the Jews and Gentiles into one Faith praise God and we're going to see uh we see here in this beginning of the chapter there's a lot of self-righteousness in this church now I wonder if we have that here people think they're so good or they're so holy they're better than other people now I hope not by God's grace but uh it's it's it needs to be preached praise God right all those millions of voices when brother man went beyond the current of time we're resting on the fact that brother Adam preached what Paul preached amen hallelujah thank God we're resting on that amen now Paul says these all men really are inexcusable now Paul says though people that judge others are inexcusable in our church it's a simple people judging people simple saying oh that guy's a serpent seed or there's no hope for that woman she's a devil or something like that just something where instead of being grieved for Sinners you're angry at sinners or secretly in your heart you want uh you want people to go to hell or or you want the judgments of God to fall on them something to that degree well Paul has to lay this out that we have no excuses when we judge others because we're guilty of the same things like many times we're guilty of the same things uh that's what he says here this there was a certain group of course that were judging others and they did the exact same things and we'll give some examples later in this chapter but I just want to show the difference this is this scripture is referring to Eternal judgment right but the Bible says that we are uh we are supposed to judge right we are supposed to judge I believe the Bible says in First Corinthians 2 that the spiritual person judges all things so there has to be some type of balance here right Paul says we judge all things and then he here he says if you judge others you're condemned so there's two kinds of judgment there's judging people eternally but you're not fit to do that right you and I don't have the qualification as we're god of the universe right so we can't we can't judge Eternal each other's Eternal destination but what we are we're Fruit judgers right we judge people's fruits because Jesus said you'll know them by their fruits so in other words we judge people's actions we do not judge their Eternal destination because what if somebody would have judged me in my actions when I was 16 years old or 18 where they have any would they have had any hope for brother Jeff's probably not a lot of Hope probably not but thank God Amen look at the goodness of God Amen Hallelujah thank God Here I Stand All These Years Later amen rejoicing in what God has done and God continues to have mercy on me and strengthen me praise God and equip me for a service amen when I I feel like Paul many times you know God's the one that called me into this service praise God God called me from my mother's womb amen it wasn't a man-made begging me to be a preacher it wasn't a denomination begging me to be a servant of God God called me to this in church each one of us as we as we saw last week were fearfully wonderfully made praise God God has a purpose for each and every one of us the thing to do is find your purpose Hallelujah and then give give God everything you have to fulfill your purpose in this life amen God form you mother's womb praise God as we saw the Mother's Day sermon right he formed in your mother's womb and you're highly favored Hallelujah just like Mary was highly favored you're highly favored too praise God Amen brother Brown says the weakest Christian is stronger than Satan when he he or she's on their knees praise God right we have power anytime you get on your knees of prayer anytime you pray with sincerity you have power over wickedness you have power over evil spirits praise God what a blessing you're highly favored God is with you praise God and I'm going to get to this eventually but the more you pray it's like planting seeds right prayers are like seeds you plant and the more you plant the more you harvest praise God that's scripture because the Bible said Elijah the fervent prayer of a righteous man prevaileth much praise God and there he prayed and he prayed and he prayed and God hearkened to Elijah no God had it not rained for three and a half years but that's really not our prayers and maybe not it's not our ministry by God's grace but we can pray and ask God to move mountains praise God or move obstacles Hallelujah but it's fervent prayer hallelujah it's having a burden for prayer how many want a burden for prayer hallelujah amen so the scripture I was thinking of uh was Matthew 7 1 so let's go there by the grace of God you see some pretty good scriptures here by God's grace Matthew 7 1. now this is a uh uh the word judge here means condemn Jesus says judge not condemn not that you be not condemned right so we get this idea of uh having no mercy on people right this idea of maybe judging Eternal destinations for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged right and that word means condemnation for with what condemnation you judge ye shall be judged and with what measure you meet it should be measured to you okay so whatever uh whatever uh measuring line you use to judge others that's how you'll be judged by the church how many want to have mercy on on one another by God's grace I'm not saying I'm not saying let's be like the Corinthians church and and not uh and not uh grieve over sin but let's not Also let's not be quick to condemn people either let's be gracious let's be merciful because however you treat someone else when they're in sin that's how you're going to be treated right or when you're struggling or you're you're falling short and maybe you and I aren't living as high as we would like to live by the grace of God we're going through a valley right however we judge others others that's how we're going to have judgment when we go through struggles oh my God Lord have mercy Hallelujah the verse three now here he gets into this idea here of of condemning others and why behold is thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but considers not the beam that is in thine own see you can see someone else's sin but can't see your own well the Bible says that we want to see our sin we've got to look in the mirror of God's word so we gotta look in the mirror of God's words with an honest heart praise God right before we start pointing out other people's faults that's why even you know like when I do the YouTube videos and I point out you know Branham Tabernacle the reason I do that is because I've gone to them publicly or I'm sorry yeah privately I've known to them privately right and I've looked in and I've said uh do I have that issue do I worship brother Brandon do I worship the tapes and I don't I've looked at myself in the word of God right I've examined Myself by the word of God and then I go out and I gotta call out other sins by God's grace but you got to look at yourself first right he says verse 4 or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye let me help you brother but yet you're the one that needs help sister let me help you but you're the one that needs help praise God so what does this teaches us about verse five thou hypocrite so it speaks of hypocrisy right we shouldn't judge others if we're guilty the same things First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt thou See Clearly to cast out the moat out of thy brother's eye all right so first we got to get our lives cleaned up and then we can help out others praise God is that right all right Hallelujah now this other scripture about the Lord just come to me here judge righteous judgment all right so let's go to that one here let me pull it up here I'm sorry I didn't have this one ready just kind of came to me here oh yeah John 7. thank you John 7 24. thanks for your patience there this will be the last one and we'll move on here John 7 24. okay John 7 24 judge not according to appearance but judge righteous judgment now that's a difficult thing praise God it's a difficult thing because we so rely upon our five senses it's kind of like what Samuel or I'm sorry what God told Samuel don't look on the outward appearance look on the heart and many times you can tell people's hearts by the words they speak because Jesus says from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh right my goodness so so we got to take all these scriptures about judgment Jesus says judge not in other words don't condemn but here he says judge righteous judgment I think Austin and I have talked to people they say oh you're judging me right they'll say you're judging me well we're not judging your Eternal destination we're judging your words and your actions and we're supposed to do that Hallelujah there's one more let me uh I believe the scripture is abound in judgment if I'm not mistaken I think that's from the uh the series on the Philippians abound in judgment here yeah Philippians 1 verse nine yeah thank you Philippians 1 verse 9. this meant a lot to me as I was preaching that uh series there because I realized that God doesn't want us to do less judging of fruits God wants us to grow in our judgment because the word means discernment right and brother Brandon said that's the great thing the tool we need for the end times he said is the anointing of discernment to judge between right and wrong to judge between the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist spirit and this was a Prayer church so you got you got the right to pray for this God give me some discernment in my life to discern the right people for me right the people that I should be friends with as you get older marriage discern if if you should marry the person right if you should Court a person right I mean you're going to need discernment praise God hallelujah amen or wherever any major decision any decision in life grow in discernment and that's what Paul says uh Philippians 1 9 and this I pray that your love may about more yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment or discernment so we've got to grow in our knowledge of God and we've got to grow in our discernment and this is done by the love of God but falling and falling more in love with God you become you have more knowledge and you have more discernment Hallelujah that's what we find churches time goes on you know when technology changes it's still the same devil behind all the new technologies right the sermon can pick that up it's the same thing right it's you know uh when I was growing up we had walkmans you know with CDs and boom boxes now I never carried one but I had one in my room some people carried them down the street I never did that I never want to lose my hearing when I was a teenager I knew better than that and of course I didn't have the money to buy all those batteries either but uh but all that was was a distraction you know it was just it was evil spirits well all I mean that's all the same same thing today you know that now it's on the phone right now it's just on the cell phone right now people got cell phones or they got the earbuds or whatever you know it's the same thing right and discernment should help us to be able to discern the right messages from the wrong messages praise God Hallelujah and we should grow we should grow in knowledge of God and in all judgment so if someone says uh you're judging me say thank you I am I'm judging your fruits praise God I'm judging your words and say well you don't like the word judge well then say discern I'm Discerning you right let's use that word you don't like the word judge let's use the word discernment hallelujah praise God all right praise the Lord now so Jesus commands us to judge and Paul commands us to abound or increase our discernment praise God now verse two let's go back to Romans 2 verse 2. Romans 2 verse 2. but we are sure that the Judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things so in other words we know God is going to judge truly Hallelujah when God judges a person whether heaven or hell it's going to be the right judgment the church we have a lot of questions down here on Earth don't we when people passed away were they saved or not right brother Ray were they filled with the Holy Ghost or not it's hard sometimes to know it's hard we don't because we don't see what's going on we only see them at certain times but God has a way he's going to judge everybody exactly right now think about that and he could just look right to the to their soul where you can look right into their soul he searches the Reigns and the hearts and he knows church he knows if they're putting on a spiritual act here and then if they're living like a devil at home he knows it right but he also knows if you're struggling and trying to stay with the word of God and he knows if you're really trying to overcome or not praise God hallelujah amen it's clear to God God can clearly see it's just like black and white right he knows either you're trying or you're really not trying you're you're overcoming or you're not overcoming praise God oh my God can judge you exactly right I mean I had to preach that one friend's uh funeral a couple years ago and he was an awful sinner and church is hard to stare at people in a hundred people in a funeral room and try to be happy for the man but I was weeping and crying in my hometown and I said God will do uh with this man what's exactly right I think I won't use one of these scriptures actually God will judge God will judge him exactly Fair and that's what that's just why I left it at I didn't say thank God he's in heaven thank God he's saved I said God knew his heart and God will judge him it's the Purdue man there it is the Purdue man uh and I know he lived a dirty life I I knew it but his son thought saw me on Facebook as a preacher and he asked me to do the funeral so I thought I'd do it and it was a blessing to preach the gospel praise God my mom even came and got to hear me preach again but we have nothing to worry about God looks past the outward he looks right down to the heart amen aren't you glad amen hallelujah like brother Madison we read that quote from Brother Brown a few weeks ago brother random said God sees that you're trying to serve him Hallelujah God sees your efforts amen hallelujah all her efforts are not perfect right but like brothers said just keep fire like Eisenhower just keep putting the bullets in and keep fire one of these times you're going to hit the target praise God God sees your efforts praise God now what's he talking about those that are worthy of judgment commit what things it's the things in chapter one I'm going to read through them again briefly quickly just to reiterate because you went over this two weeks ago but this is a total list of uh this is a total list of modern America right if you go to verse 28 and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge they don't they don't bring up scripture when they have discussions they don't talk about the word of God they don't care what the word of God says they just say I believe in God but they don't retain the knowledge of God the Bible just said grow in knowledge amen I just we just read it praise God but they don't retain God's word God gave them over to represent mine to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity Whispers now remember I gave you all the definitions two weeks ago I can't remember how the definition is now he says backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful now see there's there's unmerciful right not showing Mercy on people who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them so they just enjoy all the wicked Pleasures uh their lovers of pleasures and they're not lovers of God they're haters of God okay so Paul says clearly in verse 2 God will judge them according to truth God will give them exactly what they deserve bye that'll Shake us up a little bit here by God's grace all right chapter 2 verse 3 and think as thou this o man that judges them which do such things and do us the same that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God think about that think about that Jews or people in this church uh we're blasting people for uh fornication and yet they were guilty of it right they're blessing people for murdering and covetousness yet they murdered and they were covetous right now church for us what do we what do we often hit we always talk about modest clothes right it would be a hypocrisy if I'm preaching modest clothes and then you see me out there with my shirt off in public or something like that that's what they are doing right they're condemned it'd be like me preaching on Sunday about not smoking then going smoking tomorrow that'd be hypocrisy but this is what now look this was what happened in a book of Acts church right if this is an early church this is happening amongst believers I so what do we must do we must avoid sinful self-righteousness and pride right it's easy to bash others about like uh it's easy to I shouldn't say bash but it's easy to warn the homosexual crowd but do we have any sexual sins in our lives see it's the same thing right sexual sin or just sin in general right it doesn't matter any of those like I said any of these are we always obedient are the young people always obedient to their parents right children obedient to their parents Hallelujah do we ever back by others talk bad about them behind their back right I mean same idea same thing so we must not be self-righteous and prideful we've got to be humble praise God got to be humble verse 4. or despises thou The Riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering think about that people that judge others they despise God's goodness they just want to see people that are struggling they want to see them fall they want to see them instantly be killed and go to hell or something like that that's what they desire and Paul says don't you know don't you just don't you know you despise The Riches of God's goodness and his long-suffering he says don't you know that the goodness of God is what leads us to repentance the fact that God is so good I ran from God for 19 years with the goodness of God never gave up on me praise God now I was a child some of those years so let's say you know 12 or 15 12 or 13 or 14 years I ran from God but God was rich in Mercy praise God hallelujah now this attitude church is kind of like uh it gets it can be a complex like a god on Jonah Jonah was a prophet of God and yet this happened to him he despised The Riches of goodness to the ninevites he was all concerned about a gourd he was all disappointed that the gourd was destroyed his gourd his shade he was more upset about that right and he was all concerned about that and not con and they was upset that the ninevites were going to be killed I'll say that in the universe we're going to be saved he despised the goodness of God he wanted to see them die right but then he was then he wanted he wanted Mercy right he wanted Mercy for himself shade for himself but he wanted to see destruction on the ninevites yet he was saved yet he was a prophet yet him in the Wales Valley was a type of Christ amen we use him as a type of Jesus Christ death burial Resurrection yet he despised the goodness of God for that little moment so see Church we're not immune to it we're not immune to it at all we got to be careful right like brother random I preached an old sermon on it years ago and I think it was 2015. a whole sermon on how brother man battled the critical spirit and he said I'm haunted by a critical spirit and he's even at the pope he said pray for me I'm haunted by this critical spirit and he said I'm I'm critical of the voice of healing I'm critical of preachers that I hear about he said I'm just critical of everybody now see Church so there's got to be a way to discern things but not be critical then the Bible then the Bible just say grow in all judgment in the Bible just said hey so we're supposed to grow in discernment but yet not have a critical or negative attitude towards people I think I think the best way to do this church just watch and observe people and recognize in your mind you make a checklist okay that one's off the word there off the word there off the word there but don't say anything bad about it in other words don't try to kill their influence but you just keep a record right just keep a mental note right like when certain people will come from certain churches well I know that church in my mind I'm not going to say anything bad about the church but in my mind I know they allow women to wear makeup we talk about this right I won't blast I won't blast that church from the pulpit but I know that church allows makeup mascara trimmed hair high heels I've got to have discernment yet they say they believe the masters of the hour and growing and booming or something like that you know what I mean just everybody loves it everybody loves certain parts but in my mind I got a mental discernment list and if I see them I'll say how you doing God bless you but I you know I won't say anything unless I feel prompted by God right no maybe in the future I'll have to go to that person privately that church privately and then I might have to make a YouTube about it we'll see I'm done I'm just joking you know however you feel that by the Holy Spirit Church you can't let the bars up because then the goats come in and that's the best way to let the goats in is by bringing the world in makeup mascara painted on uh fingernails and for the men uh drinking alcohol drinking wine all kinds of things that are unsuitable for Christians watching the Super Bowls and things like that that's unsuitable for a Christian when you do that you're not separated from the world you're a part of the world but the Bible said be holy for I'm holy be separate from the world because I'm separate from the world amen all right so I thought that wasn't in my notes but that kind of reminded me of our conversation the other night good conversations we have to discern all things we should get better at Discerning and yet not be critical in condemning of people right we just saw that from the scriptures I showed you judge not unless you be judged and you can only help somebody if you've got that sin under control in your life or can I say this better word crucified in your life right you can only help somebody if the sins are crucified in your life Hallelujah amen I just like that scripture you know in Luke 15 how The Prodigal had to remember the goodness of God when he was in the pig pen he had to remember it he's eating Pig's food it's a it's basically like an Abomination to Jews right pigs and Swine it's an Abomination but there he comes to himself and he says surely uh if I just humble myself and go to my father he'll at least let me be a servant in his house what is the church he trusted in this goodness of his father amen he knew his father good enough to know that the father will have mercy on me and that's how we should act we might stumble we might fall we might make a mistake but let's remember our father is merciful amen and guess what he trusts in the mercy of the father what do you get a lot more than that amen hallelujah amen he got a ring he got a new robe amen you got a party praise God a graduation party he got a good party praise God he got all the status back but one thing he never had was the reward that the Elder son was going to have right some people look they make so much evil the Elder son but Church remember the father said you have everything that belongs to me in other words you have all the rewards the father or the younger one just the older one just got a critical spirit there it is it's got a critical spear but the father said all that I have is yours in other words all the treasures are yours and the younger one would have no reward so it's a lesson for all of us if somebody leaves comes back or whatever uh let's not you know if you were faithful the whole time don't be discouraged God has great rewards for you praise God right that's what the Bible says amen he had to know my dad is good I'm the I'm the Rascal my dad was good to me I'm the Rascal right and so it's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance praise God oh I remember on the boat remember one time Jesus said cast the net on the other side Peter said what do you mean we fished all night I'm Gonna Catch nothing he said yet for your sake I'll do it and then he takes the net and he throws it over and they pull it on the fish and what did Peter do he said Lord depart from me I'm a sinful man the goodness of God led him to repentance the church said Jesus was so good to him think about that how many of you ever worked all night and never made one dollar nobody nobody said because you work you get paid by the hour but now Peter he got paid in fishes by the hour he worked all night got nothing got a little snippy with Jesus Jesus still blesses him and he sees the goodness of God he said now look at this church the prince of God made him humble and realized what a sinner he was that's what that's what the moments of the presence of God will always make you feel humble praise God now of course there's bubble dancing and you're right like I said the spirit of God bubbling up in you that's a different kind of anointing right but when we're when we're in fault and the spirit of God comes to us and makes us humble and the goodness of God is what leads us to repent praise God amen all right verse five trying to get where I need to go here by God's grace at least where I felt like I need to go by the grace of God Romans 2 verse 5. but after thy hardness and look the hardness and in penitent in repentant heart Treasures up unto thyself Wrath so see a hard heart stores up Treasure of Wrath now that's not really a treasure uh in our way of thinking about it but it is it is a reward it's all evil reward right it's a uh it's a judgment reward a hard heart an unrepentant heart will yield to God's Wrath that's why church we ought to take every service and we ought to say Lord if there's anything in my life forgive me of it people fall away when they fail to repent of their daily sins there it is right there see you know church if you're confessing your sins every day God's Gonna you're gonna stay in good fellowship with God but it's when people won't repent week after week they won't repent service after service they'll fail to repent they'll they'll fail to apologize and ask God to forgive them and this is what stores up the wrath of God against them right God is a merciful father right God is slow to anger but here now we know it what brings this anger on it's service after service or damn after day the spirit of God showing you should repent of something and you don't repent of it and that builds up to God's Wrath not upon the believer but of course this will be on the Sinners those that are being judged eternally like the Bible says here and the revelation of the righteous Judgment of God Church there's two kinds of hard hearts here is the hard heart that gets the wrath of God these are the lost people right these are the vessels that are fitted unto destruction but there's another kind of hard heart that we have to battle that's found in Mark 16 14. let's read that there Mark 16 14. who knows what verse that is Mark 16 14. let's not think well oh brother Jess I'll never get a hard heart I always be tenderhearted toward god well give it some time you're going to be tested with time all of us have to pass through the Hall of critics right all of us have to be tested to have a testimony look at this and afterward he Jesus appeared unto leaven as they sat at me and upgraded them with their unbelief and what hardness the 11 preachers Malachi preachers can get hard hearts your pastor can get a hard heart if I'm not careful and Jesus will come and what he'll do he'll rebuke us for hard hearts and we've got to be open to that praise God we've got to be open to Lord be honest with God lord just show me if I got a hard heart in this situation now were these 11 lost no no no they were they were the Beloved praise God right those were his inner circle these are the ones that stayed 70 left and then Judas these 11 were left yeah right and yet they had Hardness of Heart in the midst of the trial their leader got crucified right right before them they all scattered in Iran they're all ashamed of themselves right and then they don't believe they don't understand Jesus told them about the resurrection they didn't catch it none of us would have but Jesus says you've got a hard heart because you're not believing the promise of God church as the Rapture appears as a Rapture it comes closer I want to Tender Heart toward God I don't want to hard heart toward the Rapture thinking oh God will never do it to me or God would never use me God could never Rapture me I want to saw tender heart towards God Amen and the best way to do that is constantly repent praise God Amen if you need to amen when you need to stay soft toward God say in love with Jesus Hallelujah so there's two kinds of hard hearts there's a heart and a soul that will never be saved right that's not us we're saved by God's grace but what we've got to battle is When Trials come and our hearts get hard and we disbelieve that God can change the situation so may God give us Grace to know he that he can change the situation Hallelujah remember like in Exodus 4 21 God hardened Pharaoh's heart but Romans 9 as we'll get to maybe in a few months I don't know Pharaoh is the modern example of he is a predestinated vessel unto destruction and yet God gave him free more agency he could have softened his heart but God knew he never would think about that after the frogs left if I had frogs in my cup my coffee cup every morning right if I had frogs in my lunch and then they were away I'd say hallelujah thank you God if I had frogs crawl into my shirt all day and then I finally all the frogs are gone and say hallelujah thank you God that's not what Pharaoh did he got harder he got a harder heart he got upset with God more and more but see we would have said hallelujah thank God all the lights are gone thank God all the swarms of fleas are gone thank God Hallelujah but he didn't even have that in him right he chose to disobey he chose to be a vessel Of Dishonor so God knew that right because he must have had lusts and Pleasures with his false gods so God hardened him again God would make him harder and harder and God has power to do that because he has power over the clay amen ah Hallelujah he's the Potter he can make a vessel any way he was thank you ought to shout and rejoice if you're a vessel of God's honor hallelujah amen thank God Amen thank God we can repent thank God we can glorify the Lord and worship God and love God with all of our hearts praise God yes we make mistakes but thank God overall we're trying to serve God the best we can and we have a heart to love Jesus amen oh my thank God but instead of it but instead some people they get blessings from God and they just get harder toward God let's not be like that like I've always said let's be that one leper that comes back to thank God in other words when Sunday or Wednesday comes you'll be one to put your testimony in I want to hear what God has done for you God can take away a hundred thousand dollars in medical bills right sister Hallelujah three thousand whatever it was amen thank God that's a testimony to God's grace amen and we ought to come back and give God some thanks right and not be hardened by the trials of life and get upset with God or anything but be soft and sweet towards the Lord because God is merciful to us amen hallelujah verse six here's kind of where I want to get you I'm not sure how much I'll go beyond this one right here Romans 2 Verse 6 who will render to every man according to his deeds so Paul says sinners uh fail to repent and they get the wrath of God and then Paul says God will give to every man God will render to them God will restore to them the word in the Greek means to pay off every man for what he does in other words there's going to be a Payday for all your actions and thank God that we're doing the right actions Hallelujah there's going to be a Payday he will render to every man and woman according to their Deeds Done In the Flesh that says in another place right all the Deeds Done think of the Deeds you did today did you work hard at work did you pay your tithes and offerings did you Worship the Lord did you help out the friend who needed help what'd you do today whatever you did for God God's going to reward you for that Hallelujah remember you work hard remember we saw that in Colossians there is eternal rewards for working hard on your job there's a reward for that because that's faithful you're not working for the boss really you're working for God there's rewards that go along with that Hallelujah I just had a this was a special testimony for me I was I was uh testifying about our our principal being a Christian and I was testifying to the families today and I said that principle was an answer to my prayers and then these parents looked at me and said Mr Smith you're the answer to our prayers thank God Amen I wasn't looking for a compliments or anything like that but I was actually in the process of complimenting somebody else and then they come around and complimenting me I said Thank you Lorena I think that's her name thank you I forgot her husband's name because they said they wanted their son to have a Christian teacher and to help their son you know grow as a reader and a writer and everything and they were really blessed so I said well praise God so in other words when I was teaching that boy I was doing it to God right like they always ask me they said why do you teach all these guys I just try to teach them like they're my own kids right so if you went to my house you see how I talk to the children that's how I try to treat my children at school right it's the closest thing to home school they'll get in Copley right George God will pay you back for everything you do for him praise God verse seven to them whom by patient look at this how do we get a good Payday on the day of judgment through patient continuance in well-doing Hallelujah just continue to do what's right Hallelujah let's not have a time where where we just fall away and stop doing what's right let's continue to do right every single day patiently right just make it through the just make it through the month right just make it through the summer right just make it through the fall just make it through the winter keep doing what's right be patient in continual obedience and well-doing and because what are you seeking you're seeking God's glory I don't want to live in God's glory someday and honor and immortality and eternal life see church when you go to work or when you come to church you're actually seeking something you're there and and all the Deeds you do when you're there at work all the Deeds you do and your house they actually show it you're seeking something you're seeking eternal life right everything I do when I'm faithful with them paying my bills that shows I'm seeking the Heavenly City right well I take care of myself and I eat the right foods and the healthy foods and get good exercise and get good sleep that's a good testimony praise God that shows I'm seeking eternal life I'm trying to honor the vessel that God gave me praise God in all that we do it's this attitude of Lord help me to be patient right help me to keep doing what's right even when it's hard help me to be patient because God's watching and God's going to pay you back that ought to put a smile on your face God's Gonna God saw those prayers God saw the faithfulness of your life God saw you treat this person right when someone treated you wrong God saw it he's going to pay you back he will render to every man and woman according to his deeds or her Deeds Hallelujah Hallelujah like those famous words Jesus says uh well done good and faithful servant enter into the joy is the Lord he called you a what servant you're here to serve you're not here to be served we are hurt we're here to serve others I'm here to serve the community of Copley and you as as here in Akron the local church I'm here to serve you how can I serve you praise God that's why I got to find out all the time right more and more how can I serve you and you're here to serve one another as well good and faithful servants Hallelujah and when you do that you're actually seeking the glory of God to live in the glory of God to honor God and you're seeking eternal life in all your Deeds praise God I want to finish with this here it's almost 8 30. I want to finish with this thought you reap what you sow Romans 2 6 who will render to every man according to his deeds I have a few scriptures here uh Lydia will you get Hosea 8 7 Mo you get Psalm 126 5. but Austin can you get Galatians 6 9 you got your Bible okay so Hosea 8 7 uh Emma Psalm 126 verse 5 and brother Austin Galatians 6 verse 9. just a few scriptures on uh you reap what you sow so Lydia when you're ready amen now of course this is speaking of wickedness right sin I think I use this in my book my uh uh modesty book yeah about America has sown to the wind and they're reaping a whirlwind right with all the crazy uh homosexual agenda transgender agenda all that the murderers and the cities the unrest the violence they're reaping right what they've sowed for all those years I was listening to a a preacher from the 90s and then he said 50 years ago in 1940 the biggest problem in high schools that teachers had to deal with was talking too much that was the biggest problem and then he gave data from 1990 what's the biggest problem in high schools rape how can you go from just talking too much jobs really man my class was really chatty to my my class they're raping one another that was from 1940 to 1990. see and in that time they took prayer out of school and what happened they sowed to the wind they're reaping the Whirlwind so that's good scripture there so you can see that of course we're aware of these things but just going to point it out about you reap what you sow Emma do you want to read that Psalm 126 verse 5. amen hallelujah see we're going to go through hard Seasons right after church we got to cry it out sometimes you're gonna cry the fervent the factual prayer of a righteous man or woman prevails much praise God Hallelujah I'm not sure how many tears we cried for Austin but we sure got the joy back Hallelujah thank God Amen Hallelujah think about that things you cried out to God for and then God answers and now joy joy has come praise God it's a promise all those tears God sees each one of them and they're like little seeds that fall down there now your your tissue might catch them but God's actually catching them in a charger up there in heaven right sketching the prayers of the Saints they're like little seeds and God sees each and every one of those Hallelujah and God will bring the joy back in other words when you're lacking joy and you're crying out to God and your desire for God to restore your joy God is going to hear that God will restore it you'll feel joyful again your church you're going to hear you're going to have days when it sounds like the birds are all singing you're on cloud nine God's giving you the victories and you're walking in faith Hallelujah you're not walking to defeatism and depression and discouragement but you're walking in faith Hallelujah amen just keep crying and keep crying out to God the Bible says those are seeds and you'll reap Joy Hallelujah oh what a blessing amen what a blessing like like the one example I always give is the Roe v Wade from 2017 on I cried numerous times over and over maybe 15 20. I don't know how many times maybe more at this altar and then the joy comes in June of 2022 it's it's over Roe v Wade's over praise God and they estimated one month that four thousand babies were saved in Texas alone and now spreading to all those all those uh States all the conservative States what a blessing so this is proof this is proven in my life it's proven in our lives let's believe God let's let's find those areas where we're struggling or where we have questions and let's pray about him let's remember when we cry God sees our tears and let's trust that God will answer praise God amen all right Galatians 6 verse 9 brother amen thank you brother just an encouraging scripture that doesn't sound a lot like Romans 2 7 right don't be wearing while doing because in due season you'll reap just don't give up just don't give up just don't let the guards down just don't throw in the towel praise God patient continuance leads to eternal life that's why I love that song you're saying on Sunday I will wait for you through the storms and through the night I'll wait for you until my soul is satisfied that means there's gonna be sometimes your Soul's not satisfied but you just got to keep waiting and God will satisfy your soul keep trusting in God keep waiting in God one thing's for sure if we leave God we're not going to get anything from God and the Bible says in Hebrews 11 God's rewarder of them that diligently seek him praise God that's one reason people don't get rewards they don't diligently seek God like they ought to that's right let's read that Romans 11. let's read that then you can see oh I read that tonight verse six Romans I'm sorry Hebrews 11 6 sorry Hebrews 11 6. let's read that together you got up there huh let's read this whole thing together ready one two three but without faith is it impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is rewarder of them that diligently seek him sometimes seek Him diligently seek him stay with it patient continuance don't give up on God hallelujah amen all right now I want to close with this here give me 10 minutes here by God's grace I really believe that Church there's so many examples of people reaping what they sowed in the Bible this is what inspired me when brother Diggs was talking about David and Goliath I was like oh that's right Goliath died by his own sword so I thought about this one Jacob deceived his father for the right for the blessing but then later his father-in-law deceived him by giving him Leah you reap what you sow right this one I heard a brother preach this is a good thought Pharaoh drowned babies and killed babies in the days of Moses later his son was killed and his army was drowned whatever he sowed that's what he reached now it's not an absolute so hang on because the the the scripture that says why sometimes it is sometimes it's you'll see the reaping and sowing sometimes you don't but God sees all of it and God's got a God's got a sowing I'm sorry God's got a reaping for all actions we just read it but some of them you don't we don't see all the time Saul spared and a malachite King remember God told him kill the Malachi King he didn't kill the amalkite and then in a malachite killed Saul he was supposed to kill the Malachi he didn't a malachite killed him he reaped what he sowed right Dave we know this one David sinned and murdered secretly later his wives were publicly shamed he's putting a nice way and then some of his family members were murdered publicly right you reap what you sow right now I'm going with negatives first but you know there's positives too Hallelujah the Philistines bragged about Goliath being a warrior and he boasted for 40 days he boasted I'm the greatest man where's the man that can fight me for 40 days he boasted but later he was humbled right right Pride goes before the fall right see and he fell and he was humbled he fell to a small tiny teenager and then he was killed by his own sword that he was trusting him right he reap what he sowed brag brag brag I'm so great I'm so great and then he says he was shown by God you're little you're nothing a little teenage ready boy can defeat you with one stone and your Warrior training don't mean nothing the training you need is God's training praise God right amen Eli didn't restrain his sons in the priesthood so later his sons were killed the ark was taken and the priesthood was taken from him he reap what he sowed because he rejected the presence of God to correct his sons the presence of God left Israel right you all know this one we saw this one live Haman had Gallows built for Mordecai but later he was hung on the Gallows himself the very Gallows he built is that right how many times remember we saw in 2008 with the stock market crash and everything these a lot of these Bankers did Ponzi schemes to get rich and now then they were poor right they uh they planted easy money right quick money they planted deception but then they were found out and some of them committed suicide some of them I think one of them was even murdered in prison they reaped what they sowed right same thing we see here get your Bibles here let's go to Revelation here Book of Revelation 16. go to Revelation 16 4. I heard a preacher preach this was pretty good now Revelation 16 4. now in the tribulation masses of people are killed because I'm sorry the masses kill people because they won't take the mark of the beast how many know that you can't buy or sell without the mark of the beast so large groups of people are bloodthirsty right and they kill anyone who take won't take the mark of the beast look at the third vial and the angel poured out his vow upon the rivers third Angel and The Fountains of waters and they became blood and I heard the angel of the water say thou art righteous O Lord which art and was and shall be because thou has judged thus the people that murdered all the people that wouldn't take the mark of the beast or Christians for look what have they done they've shed the blood of saints and Prophets and now it's given them blood to drink for they are worthy now look they sought blood and they reaped they reap blood right they were blood thirsty so they were made to drink blood because all the rivers turn to blood imagine when that happens maybe they'll they'll turn on the sinks and get some water the water found blood will come out right they're reaping what they showed they were bloodthirsty so the Bible said God's going to give them blood to drink look at verse seven and I heard another out of the altar say even so Lord God Almighty this is what the angels are saying in heaven true and righteous are thy judgments this is God's righteousness see all these people that are murderers and and are calling for uh the death of Christians and all these things the death of God the death of the Bible if they don't repent they will reap exactly what they showed they will suffer they will pay for that haters of God they will absolutely get what if if all they did was just was blasting them against God God will speak awful things against them it's exactly right because these people are bloodthirsty and they're made to drink blood and anyone who drinks blood is an abomination in the sight of God right their Waters were and church and these people they went and killed all these people right they murdered all these people who didn't take the mark of the beast and then they'll try to die but they won't be able to die right the Bible said they'll try to go into caves the mouth and say follow us and they'll be unable to even commit suicide see they tormented others so they've got to be tormented oh my like brother man says you don't want to be here during the tribulation let's get the Holy Ghost praise God Amen Hallelujah let's make sure we're born again let's be ready to go praise God hallelujah amen the Bible said they drink blood because they shed blood they reap what they sow my goodness now here's the key to it first Timothy 5 I'm almost at my 10 minutes here yeah about eight minutes First Timothy 5 24 some men's sins are open beforehand going before the judgment and some men they follow after like when Elvis died we saw all his sins right he died at 42 I'm 42 Elvis died at 42. I couldn't believe that I heard that the other day I'm like what and he looked awful look what look what look what he sowed yeah look what he reaped oh my goodness so see some men's will some men sins that women says we'll see them before they pass away others we won't but don't be discouraged verse 25 likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand praise God and they that are otherwise cannot be hit so it's the same with evildoers sometimes you see their good work or their evil works sometimes you don't so it is with Believers sometimes you see their good works sometimes you don't what encouragement church if God has made us little and nobody sees our life we shouldn't be discouraged God sees it hallelujah amen God's keeping track amen hallelujah God watches over his children praise God and there will be a day of reaping praise God the main thing is keep planting amen keep sowing and God will give you a day of harvest praise God amen what a promise some men sins are known now some are later some people's good works some people are like I think about that some people are like the city on a hill that can't be hidden Jesus said no they'll see your good works and they'll glorify the Father in heaven but that's not true for everybody you might be the person not everybody sees your good works but God sees your good works God chose some people to be like a city on a hill and people see it my Hallelujah thank God for those people but God still sees all the Unseen people you can never be unseen if you're a child of God because his eyes run to and fro upon the whole earth he's just looking for somebody that's doing good works amen he's looking for somebody that's patient and continually does good that's seeking immortality and eternal life in other words he's looking for you to come to Heaven praise God amen church we reap what we sow hallelujah how many believe that I love one thing about brother rounds beyond the curtain of time the the millions run up to him and they say our precious brother there's my 10 minutes they're precious brother precious brother and they said if you hadn't have went we would not have been here in other words brother Ram we are the fruits of all your labors now did he suffer yes his marriage suffered right his marriage suffered like I read those scriptures I read those quotes a few months ago right brother I said I love you Mita she said I don't think you do brother right but it's it's a it's a struggle that that couple had to deal with not every couple has to deal with that right but when he gets on the other side he sees all the sermons think of all those we have one thousand one hundred was it 83 sermons on tape and a lot of them are different churches all around the world in the nation each one of those is a seed planted each one is a seed and each one brother Ray there was probably an author call made and people gave their heart to the Lord and so when road ram goes beyond the current of time he sees millions of people running to him our precious brother our precious brother Hallelujah if you had not away I wouldn't be here and church the same is going to be said to you praise God because brother Ram could not have went unless his mom had the baby and reared him up and trained him right each one of us each one of us had to go each one of us were led by God each one of us were predestinated to do what God's called us to do and people run to us and say God bless you my precious sister God bless you my precious brother and we ought to be living like that we ought to be living because there's a reward Hallelujah beyond the curtain of time for each one of us praise God all these seeds God is going to bring them to fruition and we'll have a harvest Day praise God amen bye go to Revelation 14 4. I think it was my last verse yeah I'll make this my last verse here Hallelujah my goodness now I'm not going to read the one in Isaiah 53 the Bible said Jesus would die as a suffering servant and then the Bible said that he would see his seed right and who's that that's the Gentile Church after his resurrection he sent the holy ghost in the day of Pentecost and he'd see his seed he'd see the Church of God but there's also another group Hallelujah there's also a reaping that Jesus gets right there in the middle of the tribulation period or right after the middle of it it's the 144 000 Jews look what the Bible calls him now think about this they're blinded to Jesus for all these years and church right now they're getting ready right they're still getting ready and I mean they think the temple might come anytime did you see that again they got all those red heifers I think they have five red heifers right they got five red heifers not even one white hair on them they got to have that if they're going to have the temple worship and animal sacrifice I don't know if it's going to be in our lifetime I mean I believe it is but if not but they're getting ready the thing is they're living true to the word of God Hallelujah by patient continuance they're keeping the law of Moses I always do that sorry they're keeping the law of Moses they're going to the law they're going uh to the letter of the word of God obey obey well doing well doing well doing someday there's going to be a harvest someday and they're going to be a harvest praise God and when Jesus comes back he's going to show himself right and they're going to say you've got wounds in your hands where'd you get these wounds they'll say he says I got him in the house of my friends and then they'll weep from house to house but some boy they'll come to Jesus and they'll say you are a messiah you're the one we waited for you're the one we've longed for and the Bible said a fountain is open in the House of David praise God a Fountain Springs forth of repentance and rejoicing and the and the uh the the the blinders are taken off and now they can see this is our Messiah and they start praising God glorifying God and the Bible says when they're born again they're redeemed from among men they are the firstfruits unto God and to the lamb praise God oh Hallelujah Jesus preaching in these 144 000 being saved this is the reaping after all the sowing of the word of God even the sowing of the two prophets Hallelujah Moses and Elijah planted all those seeds of preaching and now here's the results and church the results are the greatest results there could ever be it's Souls because nothing is more valuable than a soul praise God Hallelujah church as far as Heaven you know we don't care how many you know what kind of rewards I don't care about the Mansions or streets of gold the main reward we want is to see Souls there praise God because he that's wise win his Souls let's stand to our feet praise God musicians can come Hallelujah I could have went through other examples of reaping and so on but I just want to end with Jesus I'm already almost at nine o'clock by God's grace Hallelujah the two prophets plant all these seeds of the word of God the same message that we believe praise God for three and a half years and then when Jesus comes he reaps the Harvest the first fruits of the earth and 144 000 received the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's that's quite a reaping how many would say Amen to that 144 000 born again in one day we had that Revival service at Napoleon what six or seven people got the Holy Ghost what a time of that was well imagine 144 000 of them get in the Holy Ghost what's that going to look like Hallelujah my goodness there's gonna be some shout and there's gonna be some Screaming there's gonna be some rejoicing there's gonna be some weeping there's gonna be some dance and praise God think about that 144 000. and each one of those is a fruit unto the ministry of the two Prophets hallelujah it's all for the glory of God let's buy our heads here by God's grace Church we're thankful that God will render to each and every one of us according to our Deeds I'm thankful for that I'm thankful to know there's a Payday church are you thankful to know there's a Payday let's pray tonight let's ask God to help us to be patient continually doing good
