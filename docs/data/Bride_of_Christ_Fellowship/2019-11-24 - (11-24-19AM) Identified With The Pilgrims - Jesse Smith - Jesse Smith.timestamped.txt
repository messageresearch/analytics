[26:06] just greet everybody the name of the
[26:08] Lord Jesus Christ praise God good be in
[26:10] the house Lord today praise God
[26:13] before I forget brother Greg I like to
[26:15] just give you my card here and case you
[26:19] ever need to pray for me prayer requests
[26:21] and then here's a free copy of my book
[26:22] by God's grace yes sir you know
[26:26] sometimes we we always love our visitors
[26:28] but sometimes they have to leave before
[26:30] I get a chance to talk to them so but
[26:31] I'll get chance to talk to you that's my
[26:34] contact information there by God's grace
[26:37] so proverbs 14 verse 33 I probably
[26:40] preach out on both today right I think
[26:42] so
[26:44] okay just that the batteries run out
[26:46] okay looks like the battery's pretty
[26:49] good proverbs 14 33 praise God
[26:59] I don't every year preach you know like
[27:02] a Easter message or a Thanksgiving
[27:04] message or a Christmas message but I'm
[27:07] gonna preach a Thanksgiving message
[27:08] today praise God proverbs 14 just you
[27:12] know seeing the inspiration
[27:14] you know the books have been reading
[27:16] lately I've been reading this book by
[27:17] Derek Prince he was a Pentecostal guy he
[27:19] passed away though but it's basically
[27:22] just like a Bible study about prayer and
[27:23] fasting and how prayer and fasting
[27:26] shaped the history of the Jews and
[27:29] America and it's really quite quite
[27:33] inspirational I'm really enjoying it I'm
[27:35] almost done with it it's been a
[27:36] wonderful book if you want to read after
[27:38] me let me know I'll give you this coffee
[27:40] it's a great book and I recommend it to
[27:43] anybody
[27:45] but a reading about you know the
[27:47] pilgrims and you know the early American
[27:49] fathers the the role that prayer and
[27:52] fasting prayed or played in their lives
[27:54] and the founding of this country it's
[27:57] pretty astounding but it just proves to
[27:59] us that God's Word is true God's Word is
[28:03] a reality and anyone that takes God at
[28:06] his word he will reward them he's early
[28:08] warder of them that diligently seek Him
[28:12] proverbs 14 33 wisdom resteth in the
[28:18] heart of him that hath understanding but
[28:23] that which is in the midst of fools is
[28:26] made known now let's read verse 34
[28:29] together one two three
[28:31] righteousness exalteth a nation but sin
[28:36] is a reproach to any people let's bow
[28:39] our heads for a word of Prayer
[28:40] never need on your heart just making
[28:41] known unto the Lord here how many father
[28:43] again we're happy to be in your house
[28:45] there's nowhere else we'd rather be Lord
[28:47] then showing Lord the world showing our
[28:50] friends our family and even you your
[28:53] angels which side we're on we're on the
[28:55] Lord's side Lord it's a privilege to be
[28:58] in your house Lord and we never want to
[29:00] lose our reverence for your house your
[29:02] prophet said it's like coming Lord to a
[29:05] courthouse because the Bible said
[29:06] judgment begins at the house of God and
[29:09] so we come here reverently softly Lord
[29:12] examining our lives our motives our
[29:14] objectives we come reverently Lord just
[29:18] use your word to cut out any unbelief in
[29:20] our hearts Lord God and Lord may we use
[29:23] the word to drive back Satan and his
[29:26] devils or try to
[29:28] attempt us and attack us and put disease
[29:32] is on ass Lord we just come against him
[29:34] in the name of Jesus Christ with the
[29:36] sword of the word dear God thank you
[29:38] Lord for sharing this sword with us may
[29:41] we use it lord have faith in it Lord
[29:44] just blessed us here in your divine
[29:45] presence
[29:46] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[29:48] said Amen god bless yous being seated
[29:50] praise God so I'll be taking some
[30:01] inspiration from a couple of quotes
[30:04] brother Greg do you know about William
[30:06] Branham okay praise Oh looks like you
[30:09] both did but you know sometimes the
[30:12] visitors come in and you know they don't
[30:13] hear about brother Branham you never
[30:15] know you know sometimes we've had
[30:16] visitors in the past from Apostolic
[30:17] churches you know that they don't
[30:18] recognize your brother Branham as a
[30:20] prophet but yet they have a holy
[30:21] appearance you know and they try to live
[30:24] right it's been a couple years since
[30:25] we've had those but we're very thankful
[30:28] that you've heard about brother Branham
[30:30] praise God thank the Lord praise the
[30:34] Lord it's been I wasn't just you know I
[30:37] wasn't raised in around the message I
[30:38] was raised in a Pentecostal Trinitarian
[30:40] church that did not believe in holiness
[30:42] but then my brother Simon met with some
[30:45] message believers in 2001 and that's
[30:48] when I received the message in 2001 so
[30:51] it's almost been almost been 19 years by
[30:53] God's grace so thankful to Lord and
[30:55] we've been here about thirteen and a
[30:57] half years preaching the gospel so we're
[30:59] thankful for God's love and we're
[31:01] thankful for this message praise God
[31:03] amen which is ba bamp says is the Word
[31:06] of God that God is vindicating today
[31:08] praise God that's the message the Word
[31:11] of God God is manifesting today praise
[31:15] God
[31:18] I'd like to preach on this thought I
[31:21] think the I think the thought I had on
[31:24] there was identified with the pilgrims
[31:26] that's my title for today by God's grace
[31:29] because I just want to take a few
[31:31] thoughts from brother Branham out of the
[31:33] masterpiece and then go out go through
[31:36] some history here and I know it'll be a
[31:39] real blessing to you and I know you'll
[31:41] be encouraged
[31:42] it's a it's a sermon you know that when
[31:45] we look at the the pilgrims it brings a
[31:47] lot of humility to us and I'm hoping
[31:49] this will give us you know humility and
[31:52] and Thanksgiving today praise God so
[31:54] that when we sit down at the table on
[31:56] Thursday that we can truly give thanks
[31:58] and really be thankful not and yes for
[32:03] the natural things but also for the
[32:04] spiritual food that we've received in
[32:06] this day because we're in a season of
[32:08] great you know the Bible said great
[32:11] famine around the world for the Word of
[32:13] God you know though they'll travel
[32:15] denominations will travel you know the
[32:17] charismatic movement people will travel
[32:19] around the world seeking for the the
[32:21] word of the Lord and no doubt some of
[32:23] them have gifts of prophecy right some
[32:25] of them can prophesy and say thus saith
[32:27] the Lord but but but as a but but as a
[32:31] word for the age we've already received
[32:34] thus say at the Lord and we are not in a
[32:36] famine we're feasting on the Word of God
[32:39] and so we've got to make sure that we're
[32:41] feeding more on the spiritual word and
[32:43] the spiritual food so that we don't get
[32:46] deceived by the natural food and the
[32:49] natural blessings in other words we got
[32:51] to stay more strong spiritually and not
[32:55] get deceived and complacent in the
[32:57] natural right because of all the natural
[33:00] blessings in America and of course
[33:02] around the world because it goes forth
[33:04] around the world so I like to look at
[33:07] this I want to take a few scriptures
[33:09] here now this is a very famous scripture
[33:11] of course for United States of America
[33:14] for righteousness has exalted the United
[33:17] States of America because our founders
[33:20] and beginning with the pilgrims founded
[33:24] this nation they founded it in
[33:25] righteousness and that's what we want to
[33:26] show today and because of that God has
[33:29] raised up America as the greatest nation
[33:32] perhaps ever perhaps ever and the reason
[33:36] I say that is because of number wise
[33:38] number wise our nation is greater than
[33:41] any nation Israel ever was right how
[33:44] many do we have I think it's almost 500
[33:47] million in this nation they're not
[33:48] mistaken and and while Israel was great
[33:52] don't get me wrong there was a great you
[33:54] know David and Solomon and great
[33:55] and of God but the one thing that we've
[33:58] got different is we've got the baptism
[34:00] of the Holy Ghost praise God
[34:02] we've got the blood of Jesus Christ that
[34:04] just doesn't cover over sins but
[34:07] completely abolish is the sin praise God
[34:09] and sends them away like the bleach of
[34:11] the blood amen
[34:13] driving away all the ink of stains and
[34:16] blood and so that's why we say it's the
[34:19] greatest nation because it was founded
[34:21] of course in a later age when the Holy
[34:24] Ghost was available when the blood of
[34:26] Jesus Christ was in effect in power and
[34:29] he's sitting as high priest upon the
[34:31] right hand of the Majesty on high praise
[34:33] God and I think that's why God has
[34:36] blessed it more than any other nation
[34:38] praise God now I want to read a little
[34:43] quote like I said I guess it's not a
[34:45] little one I guess it's a long one but I
[34:47] think I said go on I think you'll enjoy
[34:49] it I do apologize it wasn't masterpiece
[34:51] it's mighty God unveiled before us June
[34:53] 29th or you'll be familiar as I begin
[34:57] the quote but Ram's talks about how
[34:58] we're identified in everything God has
[35:01] done anything God has ever done
[35:04] throughout all time we were identified
[35:06] in it and I think a word that made you
[35:09] you and I may be more familiar with is
[35:11] associated that word kind of makes a
[35:15] little more maybe sense to me hopefully
[35:18] to you or whichever one works for you
[35:19] the word associate means connected
[35:22] related or linked praise God so you and
[35:26] I we are all related to everything God
[35:29] does we are all connected to it right
[35:33] because as we said earlier God is our
[35:36] Heavenly Father we are his children and
[35:39] like the scripture says a man Isaac
[35:41] we're talking about this he is God of
[35:42] both the dead and the living praise God
[35:45] he's the God of all he owns all because
[35:48] he created all and then he he paid for
[35:50] all the sins of all as well
[35:52] amen with one sacrifice for all praise
[35:56] God hallelujah and so I want to read
[36:00] this quote
[36:01] beginning in paragraph 176 he said we're
[36:04] identified with him in acts 2 we're
[36:07] identify with them with the same
[36:09] autism the same thing water and spirit
[36:13] all he was then and all he is all he was
[36:17] and all he is we are that's exactly it
[36:20] just like if I wanted to be a true
[36:22] American I got to be identified with
[36:24] everything she was and everything she is
[36:27] I've got to be identified with it if I'm
[36:29] a true American if I am a true American
[36:32] then I landed on Plymouth Rock we're
[36:36] look at that today with the Pilgrim
[36:40] Fathers on Plymouth Rock when they
[36:43] landed out there I was with them so was
[36:46] you everybody
[36:49] so all Americans were with the pilgrims
[36:53] when they landed on Plymouth Rock now of
[36:57] course you night we don't know we don't
[36:59] mean physically right
[37:01] we were not with them physically because
[37:04] bourbon tells us and who is his
[37:05] melchizedek he tells us the order of our
[37:08] manifest station we started out in the
[37:10] mind of God as a thought we went from
[37:14] thought he said to flesh body so my
[37:18] flesh body was born in 1980 I could not
[37:20] have been there in 16 whatever it was
[37:22] when they landed I think 16 20 if I'm
[37:25] not mistaken so I wasn't there
[37:27] physically but brothers were there by
[37:31] association by connection were
[37:34] associated with it after you became
[37:38] flesh body but man said after you leave
[37:40] this realm you take on your theophany
[37:43] and then after the theophany when the
[37:47] rapture comes then you get your
[37:48] glorified body and that's your final
[37:50] manifestation amen
[37:53] how they live as far as I know praise
[37:54] God that's what he taught us in who's
[37:56] this know Kecak but Jesus came different
[37:58] Jesus came from thought to theophany
[38:02] which the man said was that pillar of
[38:04] fire when there was nothing and there
[38:07] was just blackness out of that blackness
[38:09] and space came forth a pillar of fire he
[38:11] said that was the son that lo Goss Amen
[38:14] so went from invisible thought to
[38:17] theophany then Jesus came to flesh and
[38:20] then from flesh the glorified
[38:23] praise God so you and I physically
[38:26] weren't there right
[38:28] you know III I'd even say I don't even
[38:31] know if your soul was there I mean if
[38:33] God was there you were there in his
[38:35] thoughts I guess you know so somehow you
[38:40] were there we just say you were there
[38:42] and God's being I'll say like that or
[38:46] God's thoughts but I'm not like a
[38:48] fanatic like some people say while I was
[38:50] actually there no I don't can't see that
[38:52] because we go from thought to flesh our
[38:56] theophanies the by the Bible never said
[38:58] alpha knees float down around here the
[39:00] Bible said that theophanies are in
[39:02] heaven right now Paul said that the
[39:03] Alpha knees are eternal in the heavens
[39:07] waiting Paul said that bodies waiting
[39:09] there for me when this body of flesh
[39:11] drops I'll go to meet the theophany so
[39:15] there's we're not fanatics like that he
[39:19] said I rode with Paul Revere right down
[39:22] the road to warn her of danger that's
[39:24] right he says right down there at Valley
[39:26] Forge I crossed the icy Delaware with a
[39:29] bunch of soldiers who half of them
[39:30] didn't have shoes on I prayed all night
[39:32] with George Washington oh my god help us
[39:37] to pray amen sincerely I crossed the
[39:41] Delaware with a vision in my heart we
[39:43] are American yes sir Valley Forge I
[39:44] certainly did I returned thanks with the
[39:48] original Thanksgiving father's praise
[39:52] God if I'm a real American I was then if
[39:56] I'd there at that table what about the
[39:59] table that God gives us amen hallelujah
[40:02] there's a table now where the saints of
[40:04] God are fed praise God but there's also
[40:07] the marriage supper the land table amen
[40:10] hallelujah we know we'll be there by
[40:12] God's grace he said if I'm a real
[40:16] American I was identified when I stood
[40:18] with Stonewall Jackson I don't remember
[40:20] that part of history although I think
[40:22] was Civil War if I'm a real American I
[40:24] was defied at the Boston Tea Party yes
[40:26] sir when we refused to have things
[40:28] pulled over our eyes well I'm as real
[40:31] America he said I'm as real America
[40:34] I was identified there with that yes sir
[40:36] I rang the Liberty Bell the first fourth
[40:39] of July in 1776 I rang the Liberty Bell
[40:43] here and declared that we are
[40:44] independent to be a real American I had
[40:47] to I was identified with her shame he
[40:52] says in the Revolutionary when brother
[40:54] fought against brother I think he means
[40:55] Civil War but I could be wrong I've got
[40:58] to bear her shame the shame as I have to
[41:01] bear her glory if I'm an American I have
[41:03] to be as identified with her I was
[41:05] identified at Gettysburg down there when
[41:07] Lincoln made his speech I was on Wake
[41:10] Island over them bloody soldiers bodies
[41:12] I rose on Wake Island on Guam I helped
[41:16] hice the flag I'm a real American all
[41:19] she is I am and proud of it yes indeed
[41:23] all America's men all she is I'm still
[41:25] that to be America a part of this
[41:27] country Turks yes am i proud of their
[41:29] sin absolutely not
[41:31] but I'm proud of the blessings I'm proud
[41:34] of the father's now not in a prideful
[41:36] way but I'm thankful for the founding
[41:38] fathers and the seeds they planted and
[41:41] the fruits that were enjoying because of
[41:43] their obedience the bear said I'm proud
[41:47] to be American he says same thing he
[41:51] said everything she was I have to be
[41:54] because I'm identified with her same
[41:56] thing by being a true Christian you have
[41:58] to be identified with it I preached with
[42:00] Moses I'm sorry I said I preached with
[42:02] Noah and warned the people of the
[42:04] oncoming judgment to be a real Christian
[42:07] I was with Moses at the burning bush
[42:12] thank God I saw his glory I was there
[42:16] with Moses up there in the wilderness to
[42:18] be a Christian I have to be identified
[42:21] with everything God was to be a
[42:23] Christian I seen his glory I heard his
[42:26] voice don't try to explain away from me
[42:28] now because I was there I know what I'm
[42:30] talking about I see what happened yes
[42:32] sir now I wonder if he's breaking into a
[42:34] spiritual realm here because he's a he's
[42:37] a prophet maybe he was talking about
[42:39] visions he'd seen it seems awfully like
[42:43] this seems like he's breaking into
[42:45] vision perhaps because we know the order
[42:48] the order we our physical bodies weren't
[42:49] there
[42:50] nor were our theophanies so the only way
[42:52] we could have been there was in part of
[42:54] God we were part of God he said I was at
[42:57] the Red Sea when I seen the Spirit of
[42:58] God moved down and parked the water from
[43:01] one side not through a bunch of reeds
[43:03] that they're trying to say today but
[43:06] through a 90-foot sea
[43:08] I seen the Spirit of God I walk with
[43:14] Moses through that dry ground across
[43:17] that Red Sea I stood by Mount Sinai and
[43:20] seen the thunder lightning falling
[43:21] I ate manna with them out there I drank
[43:24] from that rock I'm still doing it
[43:26] tonight amen did you know that rock is
[43:31] still pouring forth water tonight amen
[43:34] the eternal rock the Holy Spirit Jesus
[43:36] Christ amen
[43:37] I was identified with the manna eaters I
[43:41] was identified with him that drunk from
[43:43] the rock
[43:44] I was also identified when Joshua blew a
[43:46] trumpet and the walls of Jericho fell
[43:48] down I was in the lines they would
[43:50] Daniel I was in the fiery furnace with
[43:53] the Hebrew children
[43:54] I was with Elijah on Mount Carmel I was
[43:58] with John the Baptist before them
[44:00] critics
[44:00] I seen the Spirit of God descending I
[44:02] heard the voice of God say this is my
[44:05] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased yes
[44:08] sir I was identified with them
[44:10] I was identified there at the grave of
[44:12] Lazarus when he raised up Lazarus I was
[44:14] identified with the woman at the well
[44:16] when he told her her sins yes sir
[44:18] I surely was identified with him in his
[44:20] death and I was identified on the first
[44:23] Easter I raised with him from death I'm
[44:27] identified with him in his death glory
[44:31] I was with 120 in the upper room I was
[44:35] identified up there with them he said
[44:37] hey I feel religious I was identified
[44:40] there I'm one of them
[44:41] I was identified I got the same
[44:43] experience they had I was there when it
[44:46] happened to be a true Christian so we're
[44:51] talking about the same experience as far
[44:53] as feeling the same and then here's what
[44:55] I want to say it's we're feeling the
[44:56] same holy spirit amen
[44:59] see we go through our difficult trials
[45:02] of life and when we go through different
[45:04] trials who is it that shows up it's the
[45:06] same God that showed up for Noah and
[45:08] Moses and Daniel in the Hebrew children
[45:11] and and Paul and Silas the same guy that
[45:15] showed up for them is the same guy that
[45:17] shows up for us amen
[45:19] so see we're identified we knew we could
[45:22] get an understanding what it's like
[45:23] praise God when we see America and God
[45:26] heals somebody from something that
[45:28] should have died up you know we can say
[45:30] my it's just like being there when
[45:32] Goliath fell down amen I know what it's
[45:35] like to defeated Goliath because we
[45:37] prayed and we've seen God do great
[45:39] things that deliver people from sin and
[45:41] disease and sickness and save them from
[45:44] the grave so we know it's like there
[45:46] when David met Goliath and he fell
[45:48] because we see Giants falling around us
[45:51] ain't no glory
[45:53] I witness the mighty rushing wind come
[45:58] in I felt the power of God as it shook I
[46:01] was with them their spoken tongues I
[46:03] felt the anointing come in there I was
[46:06] with them I was identified with them
[46:08] when the Holy Ghost began to speak
[46:10] through tongues with them I was with
[46:12] Peter before the critics in acts 2 when
[46:14] he preached the great sermon that he did
[46:16] yes sir in acts 4 when they assembled
[46:19] together I was with them when the
[46:20] building shook
[46:24] after prayer meeting the building ship
[46:26] where they were sitting I was identified
[46:27] there with them I preached with Paul on
[46:30] Mars Hill in acts 17 ha ha there's a
[46:35] bunch of unbelievers there and they're
[46:36] God's to everyone but brother man was
[46:38] right there preaching with Paul he stood
[46:42] there against all the the false gods and
[46:46] all the false religions he stood there
[46:48] declaring that there's one unknown God
[46:51] you don't know but I'm gonna let you
[46:53] know his name it's Jesus Christ a man
[46:55] and that he's not unknown now he's known
[46:58] to you and now you're accountable
[46:59] believe and you shall be saved amen
[47:02] save yourself from this untoward
[47:05] generation praise God I was with John on
[47:10] the Isle of Patmos and seen as coming in
[47:12] the book of Revelation
[47:14] I was with Wesley that firebrand snatch
[47:17] from the fires that great revolt against
[47:20] the Anglican Church I was there with him
[47:22] and Here I am tonight 1964 in
[47:27] Philadelphia Pennsylvania identified
[47:29] with that same kind of group with the
[47:31] same kind of experience I must be to be
[47:34] a Christian he says I must stay identify
[47:38] where the Word of God is being
[47:40] manifested I'm identified with a group
[47:42] that feels the Spirit of God I'm
[47:45] identified with a group that knows he's
[47:47] unveiled and that knows he's the same
[47:51] yesterday today and forever that knows
[47:53] that this is not fanaticism it's Jesus
[47:56] Christ the same yesterday today and
[47:58] forever
[47:58] I'm identified with that group here
[48:00] tonight yet they're called a bunch of
[48:02] heretics a bunch of fanatics and a on
[48:05] account of the Word of God but I'm not
[48:08] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[48:09] first the power of God and a Salvation
[48:12] and I'm one I'm with them living
[48:15] epistles I spoke of vindicated God
[48:19] veiled in human form in men and women
[48:22] all right so he's talking about the
[48:25] unveiling of God praise the Lord and how
[48:27] God had a veil in every age praise God
[48:30] now as you just don't forget this though
[48:32] as we talked about the New Testament is
[48:34] different because God veils behind the
[48:36] TWiT I'm sorry God they´ll I'm sorry God
[48:40] dwells behind the veil of human flesh
[48:42] permanently since Pentecost before
[48:46] Pentecost you know God would anoint
[48:47] Moses and then the Spirit would leave
[48:49] and then he you know strike the rock
[48:51] instead of speak to and God say you're
[48:52] not going over the promised land he
[48:55] would anoint David he'd slay Goliath but
[48:57] then the anointing will leave right from
[48:58] his human spirit and then David would
[49:00] take a Bathsheba commit adultery but see
[49:04] that problem of the temporal temporary
[49:06] noin ting was solved when Jesus Christ
[49:09] blood forgave our sins and now the
[49:12] Spirit of God has access to the soul of
[49:15] man and now the soul can receive the
[49:18] eternal seal praise God and now we're
[49:21] sealed not to the next revival or not to
[49:23] the next disgrace where we fall into
[49:25] this or well know that we're sealed to
[49:27] the day of
[49:27] Redemption praise God that's the
[49:30] difference before the Old Testament he
[49:33] was veiled temporarily but church thank
[49:35] God we had nothing to worry about no
[49:38] matter what comes with the squeeze no
[49:40] matter what comes upon this nation we
[49:42] have nothing to worry about if we're
[49:43] born again we've got the permanent
[49:45] Living God permanent dwelling behind the
[49:48] veil of this flash amen and in their
[49:51] hour when we're tempted or that hour
[49:53] when we have to choose life or death if
[49:56] we have to go that way
[49:57] no matter which way it goes we have
[49:59] confidence that jesus said don't worry
[50:01] don't plan ahead what you'll say but the
[50:04] spirit of my father will give you what
[50:06] to say
[50:06] in that hour because it's not temporary
[50:10] it's permanent glory
[50:15] he said I'm with them living epistles
[50:18] vindicated God veiled in human form in
[50:21] men and women last paragraph of this
[50:26] quote God in His amor fate again veiled
[50:30] himself and made himself known to his
[50:33] people the great king who laid aside I'm
[50:38] sorry laid aside his glory yet a little
[50:39] while and the world won't see me no more
[50:41] I'll be veiled to them but ye shall see
[50:44] me probably with you even in you all the
[50:47] way to the consummation changing like
[50:49] Bowie says changing from Luther to
[50:52] Wesley to on and on from glory unto
[50:55] glory I'm still the same God that lived
[50:57] and going back to the original glory
[51:00] hallelujah oh thank the Lord amen so God
[51:06] has always been veiled behind men women
[51:09] that were following the word of the hour
[51:12] occasion to switch over here I just got
[51:14] I just got a couple pictures I'm not
[51:15] going to show too much today I'll
[51:16] probably it to the other ones later on
[51:19] Wednesday we'll probably look at like
[51:20] the founding fathers you know like
[51:22] George Washington and James Madison and
[51:25] John John Adams and everything like that
[51:27] but today you know Lord willing Lord
[51:33] willing on Wednesday we'll look at you
[51:34] know how George Washington and John
[51:36] Adams and James Madison would fast and
[51:39] pray these were not pushovers
[51:42] these were men that were atheist like or
[51:45] agnostics like they tell you these were
[51:47] men that they in our early nation our
[51:49] early fathers they voted and paid
[51:52] Congress or the Congress voted and
[51:53] they've the first book they ever printed
[51:55] on this land was the Bible a man
[51:59] they spent thousand dollars the first
[52:01] printing press ever did was 10,000
[52:03] Bibles for the American schools amen
[52:07] that's what were founded upon a man how
[52:10] do you and I was there when they printed
[52:12] a brother oh yeah not physically but I
[52:17] was part of God's Spirit amen glory now
[52:25] let's take a moment here and look at
[52:27] some pilgrim history by God's grace now
[52:30] like I said there's a lot in here and
[52:32] then there's a documentary' if you want
[52:35] to write it down it's by Kirk Cameron he
[52:38] did dock you marry a few years ago
[52:39] called monumental it's a it's a great
[52:43] one now just so you know there's a
[52:44] little bit of rock and roll riffs in
[52:45] there you know like when they transition
[52:47] from one thought to the next they'll put
[52:49] rock and roll or a rap and I'm like come
[52:51] on my goodness
[52:52] but I bought it anyway because it's so
[52:54] rich in American history of course I
[52:56] don't I don't enjoy those parts of it
[52:58] but so I'm getting a lot of my thoughts
[53:00] from that documentary and then also from
[53:03] this book because this man he was
[53:06] invited to speak at the what was it the
[53:08] 300 yeah the 350th anniversary of the
[53:12] landing of the pilgrims on Plymouth Rock
[53:14] this preacher was asked to preach and so
[53:16] he read numerous books by William
[53:18] Bradford and then other journals from
[53:20] the men and women who were actually
[53:21] there at the first establishment the
[53:24] colonization there and so I want to look
[53:29] at some history here like I said let's
[53:31] ask the Lord may God God help us to be
[53:33] thankful today praise God and help us to
[53:36] see that where we would have been with
[53:38] them had we been alive in that day you
[53:41] were there in one sense but if you would
[53:44] have been there in the flesh you'd been
[53:45] right with them that's right now let me
[53:51] here uh a few because last week our last
[53:56] Sunday I was kind of struggling with to
[53:58] remember the word the word I couldn't
[53:59] remember was Puritan I kept saying
[54:02] pilgrim and separate to vist but I'll
[54:05] try to clarify that today now governor
[54:11] Bradford he was the first governor of
[54:14] the new colony after the Mayflower
[54:17] landed and the Pilgrims set up their
[54:20] first government it was the the document
[54:23] they used was the Mayflower Compact I'm
[54:25] sure you've maybe read about that in
[54:27] history but let's go back before that
[54:29] while he lived in England or maybe it
[54:32] was Holland that part I don't know
[54:33] because the pilgrims had to move a
[54:35] little bit because of persecution at 12
[54:39] years old
[54:41] William Bradford became given his life
[54:43] over to the Lord he started reading the
[54:46] Bible studying it and he grew to be a
[54:51] real good man
[54:53] keeping the scriptures and let me just
[54:57] skip ahead here yeah I'm sorry I'm on
[55:02] the wrong page here we go yeah he was
[55:04] born at York Shire in the early spring
[55:07] of 1590 at 12 years old he became a
[55:10] constant reader of the Bible maokai is
[55:14] 12 so here you go son good good place to
[55:17] look for inspiration right here as a lad
[55:22] he was so moved by the word he joined a
[55:25] group of Puritans who met for prayer and
[55:28] discussion at the house of William
[55:30] Brewster in a nearby village and when he
[55:34] finally decided to join that church in
[55:36] 1606 he joined at it at the wrath of his
[55:40] uncles and the scoff of his neighbors
[55:43] because remember during this time it was
[55:45] Queen Elizabeth and I remember her it
[55:47] was King James yet but it was almost -
[55:49] King James but they were a part of the
[55:51] established church system in fact this
[55:54] was the end of the Thyatira beginning of
[55:58] the Sardis Church age so that tells you
[56:02] how dark it was Thyatira was the darkest
[56:05] age there's ever been but restless the
[56:08] darkest we're in the most deceptive age
[56:10] but that was the darkest age because
[56:12] they didn't have access to God's Word
[56:14] they had to be led by the Holy Spirit
[56:16] and traditions and passed down so this
[56:19] is the age that we're living in and and
[56:21] they started printing Bibles and and and
[56:24] they smuggled on now if you got caught
[56:26] with one you word that you were dead
[56:28] it was life or death they started
[56:31] printing in my briefs soon they got out
[56:33] of most of people and you had a group of
[56:34] people that call themselves Puritans and
[56:37] they elected or they were trying to stay
[56:40] within the denomination glory and they
[56:44] were trying to change the denomination
[56:46] from the inside and so that's what he
[56:50] joined up with first because that was
[56:51] the move of the day but pretty soon they
[56:55] realized they were not going to change
[56:57] it from the inside because Moran said
[57:01] every every every revival dies when they
[57:04] read that when the leader dies the
[57:06] revival dies because they denominator
[57:08] round his word and they fail to see the
[57:12] Holy Spirit moving on oh my
[57:15] so they scoff at him but his life
[57:20] revolved around that of his church and
[57:22] congregation and so then after that
[57:26] there became another group out of the
[57:28] Puritans came another group because the
[57:31] Puritans were trying to they were trying
[57:34] to correct the Pentecostal church can I
[57:36] say like that
[57:36] I remember brother have said member and
[57:39] when's the end time brother and prophesy
[57:41] and he said thus saith the Lord he said
[57:45] every denomination will take the mark of
[57:47] the beast thus saith the Lord he said
[57:49] they'll never come back to the Apostolic
[57:51] teaching he said see if it isn't right
[57:53] write it down your Bible that's thus
[57:55] saith the Lord
[57:56] and here we are fifty five years later
[57:58] and that one denomination has never gone
[58:01] back why because he knew God our God
[58:03] showed him as a prophet that that's the
[58:06] way of death and revival the only way to
[58:09] be revived is to come out of her my
[58:10] people praise God it should be not
[58:13] partakers of her sins and her plagues
[58:15] praise God and so he said it would thus
[58:18] saith the Lord
[58:19] stands still to this day praise God
[58:21] hallelujah so there became two groups
[58:26] now now you got the Puritans and Queen
[58:28] Elizabeth made that word like a cuss
[58:30] word it was so dirty because they would
[58:33] arrest the Puritans and they it pretty
[58:35] certainly got illegal because the
[58:37] government had power of church over
[58:39] state the state the Queen and King would
[58:41] tell the preachers what to preach right
[58:45] and that's where we're getting to my
[58:46] brother and said that's what the squeeze
[58:47] is all about the state and church unite
[58:50] in the United States and they change the
[58:52] laws and they're going to bring a
[58:53] boycott against Bride of Christ
[58:55] fellowship if the Lord tarries right
[58:58] that's Macy when it comes back to it's
[59:00] coming back to that but I REM taught
[59:01] that plainly right and spoken words
[59:03] original see look away to jesus 63 he
[59:06] taught that plainly that's how the
[59:07] boycott in the church age book that's
[59:09] how the boycotts going to come about the
[59:11] churches have to rally around the
[59:13] government and I showed you that video
[59:15] last week 28 religious leaders met with
[59:18] the President Trump and they say and
[59:20] they all say we've never seen such
[59:21] agreement with churches and the
[59:23] government they're gonna see more though
[59:25] don't let's not forget about that
[59:28] they're gonna see more but see not from
[59:31] us we're not going to unite to the
[59:33] government we're uniting with the word
[59:36] praise God do we pray for the government
[59:38] yes I believe it's a sin not to pray for
[59:41] the government because Paul said in
[59:43] first Timothy 2 he said first of all
[59:44] make prayers and supplications for all
[59:46] men and then make prayers for the
[59:48] leaders I mean it's a sin not to pray
[59:51] for the government praise God
[59:54] so so he has to make it
[1:00:00] stay with the Puritans or do I separate
[1:00:03] myself from them and so you know what he
[1:00:07] chose he chose to separate himself from
[1:00:10] the Puritans they and later church after
[1:00:13] they were called separatists
[1:00:15] after they were called separatists then
[1:00:17] they needed a word to call themselves
[1:00:18] that's when they came up with the word
[1:00:20] pilgrim because the Bible said we are
[1:00:23] pilgrims and strangers and see Church
[1:00:26] they're running from Queen Elizabeth now
[1:00:29] they're running from the cops and
[1:00:31] they're running from the police
[1:00:31] department and history says they had to
[1:00:35] hide out brother amen there was like a
[1:00:37] hundred of them no 200 of them and they
[1:00:40] would have to hide out in the biggest
[1:00:42] homes possible and they would have night
[1:00:44] meetings they couldn't meet during the
[1:00:46] day because the cops would see him and
[1:00:48] so their children were the lookouts at
[1:00:51] nighttime they'd have the older children
[1:00:53] out there and watching in spite you know
[1:00:55] looking for any spies going on
[1:00:56] and then once they thought it was clear
[1:00:58] all the children would come back in and
[1:01:00] they'd have worship by candlelight that
[1:01:03] was in England but the pressure kept
[1:01:06] mounting see God was pushing them out of
[1:01:08] their glory God was pushing those Eagles
[1:01:10] those comfortable Eagles God was
[1:01:13] stirring the nest amen
[1:01:15] I know aren't you glad God started your
[1:01:17] nest one day praise God and push you out
[1:01:20] of your comfortable state and and you're
[1:01:22] comfortable denomination aren't you glad
[1:01:24] God did that amen
[1:01:26] you had to stay us up and get us to be
[1:01:29] able to spread our wings and fly upon
[1:01:31] the winds of faith amen
[1:01:34] glory so see God allows in his wisdom he
[1:01:38] allows all these political pressures and
[1:01:40] church pressures and crazy-ass Co
[1:01:42] pressures and it's pushing us to do
[1:01:44] God's will see it says the Puritan who
[1:01:52] is part of the church was a nationalist
[1:01:54] believing that a Christian nation is a
[1:01:57] Christian Church we got a lot of people
[1:01:59] like that today there's a lot of people
[1:02:00] still denominations that say oh we need
[1:02:02] we're a Christian country no we're not
[1:02:04] anymore you better read revelation 13 if
[1:02:06] you think we're a Christian nation start
[1:02:09] at verse 11
[1:02:11] where to
[1:02:12] beasts that rise up out of the sea and
[1:02:14] where does it get its power not from
[1:02:16] heaven it gets its power from the Beast
[1:02:19] that was before it which was pagan Rome
[1:02:23] it started out as a Christian nation but
[1:02:26] it's no longer anymore see so we're not
[1:02:29] we're not nationalists we're Christians
[1:02:32] praise God amen but the pilgrim was a
[1:02:37] separatist or separatist sorry keep
[1:02:40] saying that run separatist now only from
[1:02:45] the Anglican prayer book and Queen
[1:02:47] Elizabeth's Apocrypha but from all
[1:02:50] national churches the pilgrim wanted
[1:02:55] Liberty for himself and his wife and his
[1:02:57] little ones and for the Brethren to walk
[1:02:59] with God in a Christian life as the
[1:03:02] rules and motives of such were revealed
[1:03:05] to him from God's Word see the Bible was
[1:03:08] like a fresh thing brother William it
[1:03:10] was like new wow this is hot off the
[1:03:11] presses and this is an important thing
[1:03:13] and this is very special and they're in
[1:03:16] the mayonnaise amen ah they're in the
[1:03:19] mayonnaise they don't really they don't
[1:03:21] have the eagle revelation yeah but yet
[1:03:23] they know there's more ha ha ha ha
[1:03:26] there's more like when you when I was in
[1:03:28] nomination I knew there was more I
[1:03:30] didn't know where it was but I was going
[1:03:32] deeper and up you know Baptists and
[1:03:34] deeper into more doctrine and then I
[1:03:37] found the message and I found with the
[1:03:39] more that I was looking for praise God
[1:03:42] so where the pier the pilgrims here they
[1:03:46] always knew they was there was more to
[1:03:49] God's Word and so this history says the
[1:03:54] difference between the Puritans in the
[1:03:56] established church and the pilgrims was
[1:03:58] two different words and brother Graham
[1:04:01] uses them to the one word for the
[1:04:03] Puritans was Reformation which Martin
[1:04:08] Luther the Reformation but even history
[1:04:12] says his word was not restoration as our
[1:04:16] Reformation his word was restorations
[1:04:18] are you and that's what we have the
[1:04:21] restoration of the broad tree based on a
[1:04:24] man
[1:04:25] jesus said I'll restore I'm sorry no
[1:04:27] Joel said I'll restore all the years of
[1:04:30] the caterpillar and the Palmer worm and
[1:04:32] the cankerworm amen
[1:04:33] my great army which I sent him on you
[1:04:36] praise God they're wired their keyword
[1:04:39] was restoration they one of the original
[1:04:43] church they believe the ultimate purpose
[1:04:46] of God was to restore the church to its
[1:04:48] original condition as portrayed in the
[1:04:52] New Testament ah
[1:04:54] a memorizer program said thus saith the
[1:04:57] Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be
[1:05:00] in the bride so see brother brothers he
[1:05:05] had he had that desire the Spirit of
[1:05:08] Christ was guiding him was guiding the
[1:05:10] pilgrims to complete restoration they
[1:05:13] wouldn't let you see it when I sure hope
[1:05:15] we do praise God amen I sure we're gonna
[1:05:18] see it when the bread comes back to
[1:05:20] being the full bride she was at
[1:05:22] Pentecost glory that's the prophecy for
[1:05:27] the end time it's done saith the Lord
[1:05:29] brother Branham said Joel to 23:26
[1:05:34] so the pilgrims had a vision of not
[1:05:37] Reformation restoration Wow look at that
[1:05:40] church there in the there in the the age
[1:05:43] of Reformation but their vision goes
[1:05:46] beyond that to restoration talk about
[1:05:49] advance you put kids in the advanced
[1:05:51] classes at school
[1:05:52] these guys were spiritually advanced
[1:05:54] they're living in the age of Reformation
[1:05:57] but God has already given them a vision
[1:05:59] for restoration
[1:06:01] maja mercy Lord so that's what they did
[1:06:10] they joined themselves by covent and
[1:06:16] they tried to
[1:06:18] as near the primitive original pattern
[1:06:20] of the first churches as the others all
[1:06:27] right now let me read a little bit of
[1:06:28] the history real quick here
[1:06:29] a little more so this was a time where
[1:06:34] to have a Bible it was a league almost
[1:06:36] in many places so out of the Puritans
[1:06:43] came separatists which later call
[1:06:46] themselves pilgrims now let me share
[1:06:49] something with you too when I first
[1:06:50] heard the message in 2001 brother Greg I
[1:06:53] was so part of it like a megachurch we
[1:06:56] call an Akron okay and they were talking
[1:06:59] with me I was trying to you know
[1:07:00] starting to realize I got to come out of
[1:07:02] here
[1:07:02] and I was saying you know I say Pastor
[1:07:04] Mike I said I don't want to go to the
[1:07:06] movies anymore they cost they swear they
[1:07:08] show naked women and I shouldn't go to
[1:07:10] that and he's like you don't want to be
[1:07:13] a separatist
[1:07:14] he said because then you lose track and
[1:07:17] lose touch with the world and they can't
[1:07:19] relate to you and that has always stuck
[1:07:23] with me that was back in 2001 or 2002 he
[1:07:26] said you don't want to be a separatist
[1:07:30] he used that exact word and that's
[1:07:34] exactly what he was he said we've got to
[1:07:36] be separate from the things of the world
[1:07:38] amen so see that proves that their
[1:07:44] church and other churches like that
[1:07:45] they're going for Reformation in senator
[1:07:48] from restoration amen but we are going
[1:07:51] for full restoration that never left me
[1:07:55] I always thought why do you tell me
[1:07:56] you're being a separatist he must have
[1:07:58] been reading must been around
[1:07:59] Thanksgiving time or something like that
[1:08:00] he must been reading about it and maybe
[1:08:02] criticizing these guys I don't know but
[1:08:05] the Bible says the Bible says you must
[1:08:07] separate yourself from all unbelief
[1:08:09] praise God the Bible says in the fear of
[1:08:12] God cleanse yourself from all filthiness
[1:08:14] of flesh and spirit praise God amen
[1:08:18] the Bible teaches a complete separation
[1:08:21] from the things of the world hallelujah
[1:08:25] so they met for four years but they met
[1:08:27] for years they met there in England in
[1:08:30] the biggest houses there was about 200
[1:08:31] of them and only met at nighttime
[1:08:34] because they get arrested during the day
[1:08:35] the children would look out then they
[1:08:38] run it okay time to have Church okay
[1:08:39] let's get the song lead off there let's
[1:08:41] start singing of raise the heart there's
[1:08:43] there's more this word can you imagine
[1:08:45] the first Bibles huh let's read the book
[1:08:48] of Job for the first time oh my let's
[1:08:51] read the book of the gospel of market
[1:08:53] and mine they were so hungry for the
[1:08:55] things of God amen we should be hungry
[1:08:58] for the things of God hallelujah
[1:09:03] so they give himself this name pilgrims
[1:09:06] well they got to the point where the
[1:09:08] pressure was so great they had to leave
[1:09:10] so they made a decision after four years
[1:09:13] we're gonna go to this country of
[1:09:15] Holland which is southeast of England
[1:09:18] and you might heard his story so they
[1:09:22] paid a boat master but they didn't know
[1:09:26] what he was going to betray them
[1:09:28] so all 200 of them go out to this boat
[1:09:31] at nighttime to get this boat and what
[1:09:35] already happened the boat guy had
[1:09:36] already betrayed them and brought the
[1:09:37] cops in and when he brought him in all
[1:09:40] the women had their money and everything
[1:09:42] they sold everything they were moving
[1:09:43] they had it hid it under their skirts
[1:09:46] and is a very very big embarrassment and
[1:09:50] so the police stripped down the women
[1:09:52] and got right in front of everybody
[1:09:53] there's two hundred of the pilgrims
[1:09:55] there and they stripped him down got the
[1:09:58] money all their possessions let him get
[1:09:59] their clothes back on and they took him
[1:10:01] out of prison that was their first
[1:10:03] attempt but Church let me tell you this
[1:10:05] they didn't give up amen in the midst of
[1:10:11] embarrassment in the midst of a rest in
[1:10:14] the midst of prison they didn't give up
[1:10:16] I don't know how long it was but they
[1:10:19] did it again they hired another guy but
[1:10:23] this time they divided up they divided
[1:10:27] up the group they had men and women go
[1:10:29] I'm sorry men go one way women and
[1:10:31] children go another way and during this
[1:10:35] time they got on two boats but this time
[1:10:38] there's a storm and thus there was a
[1:10:41] great storm now the women and children
[1:10:42] got caught they went back to jail
[1:10:45] and they didn't get you then he get the
[1:10:46] hon for one year later to one year later
[1:10:48] but the men got in this vote the other
[1:10:51] one stayed there because they got caught
[1:10:52] the boat said about it was Oh too weak
[1:10:54] storm out on the ocean and they were
[1:10:58] gonna that all these ships the history
[1:11:00] said a hundred ships sank out on the
[1:11:02] ocean but this little sliver of message
[1:11:05] believers amen
[1:11:07] this little fanatical little this little
[1:11:10] flock out there on the ocean waters amen
[1:11:12] everybody else is sinking there and
[1:11:14] they're praying for two weeks
[1:11:16] God stopped the storm and it was so bad
[1:11:18] it stored for two weeks straight didn't
[1:11:19] even know where they were and they just
[1:11:22] kept praying Cape Cod praying all of a
[1:11:24] sudden the storm broke and they could
[1:11:26] see where they were going and they
[1:11:27] sailed to Holland and started a new life
[1:11:30] there and the men had to write back and
[1:11:32] so forth send money to get the women
[1:11:35] there and finally a year later they're
[1:11:37] all families are all United again he
[1:11:41] imagines Satan saying look even believe
[1:11:42] this is of God and your wife and
[1:11:44] children you're not only have your wife
[1:11:45] and children you got arrested twice but
[1:11:49] they knew they knew they were standing
[1:11:50] on God's Word Hey and though the way be
[1:11:54] stormy I'll praise the Lord though the
[1:11:57] way be thorny no matter how hard the
[1:11:59] road is it was just the tasks praise God
[1:12:02] because they couldn't worship God in the
[1:12:04] old system in Reformation they knew a
[1:12:07] restoration praise God
[1:12:09] so as God's Spirit guiding them out of
[1:12:11] this that was churches and he was
[1:12:13] guiding them out to follow Christian
[1:12:16] Liberty amen oh yes so that was the
[1:12:21] first miracle it should have sank
[1:12:24] hundred ships sank but not that one
[1:12:26] because that had some predestinated
[1:12:28] seeds in it he was one of them amen
[1:12:33] glory now they got a pastor there they
[1:12:38] were God raised up a pastor named John
[1:12:39] Robinson in Holland and they say they're
[1:12:42] burly men for 12 years once they got
[1:12:45] their families they stay there for 12
[1:12:46] years building them up in the faith this
[1:12:48] was a new book they didn't understand
[1:12:50] everything so you know pastor there he
[1:12:52] started studying it for 12 years and
[1:12:54] they barely struggled to get by in the
[1:12:56] natural sea because they're from a
[1:12:58] different
[1:12:59] they were a part of the Guild's they
[1:13:01] weren't a part of the unions kinda say
[1:13:03] like that they weren't in the unions and
[1:13:06] because of their beliefs they weren't
[1:13:09] allowed to join them they were kept out
[1:13:13] now now what's amazing is that that
[1:13:15] storm helped direct them to Holland and
[1:13:18] Holland was the only nation in the world
[1:13:20] at that time that didn't have a
[1:13:22] murderous tyrant leader every other
[1:13:25] leader in the world would have killed
[1:13:27] those predestinated seeds amen but God
[1:13:30] had to send them to a place where his
[1:13:32] predestinated seeds could be preserved
[1:13:34] amen because God knows how to preserve
[1:13:37] this word amen hallelujah
[1:13:40] so he said it too the only place they
[1:13:42] could go Holland
[1:13:44] god bless Holland a man 12 years the
[1:13:50] pastor trained him up and it was a hard
[1:13:52] life naturally but it was glorious
[1:13:54] spiritually because they for the first
[1:13:58] time in their lives whether Greg they
[1:14:00] have to worry about something not going
[1:14:01] to notice it what do you guys thinking
[1:14:02] about in there I'm pulling you off to
[1:14:04] jail what are you reading in there they
[1:14:06] were free as well they were free to
[1:14:08] praise the Lord and worship and love God
[1:14:11] although it was hard on the children the
[1:14:12] children had to go to work because just
[1:14:14] like today companies will hire children
[1:14:16] because they'll have to pay him taxes
[1:14:17] right not to pay taxes on earth to
[1:14:19] report it which is illegal but they had
[1:14:21] no their choice for 12 years their
[1:14:24] children labored and worked for the
[1:14:26] adults how could this be the plan of God
[1:14:30] what do you mean I'm a man I can't even
[1:14:32] work but yet it was the plan of God what
[1:14:35] did it take it took a lot of humility in
[1:14:38] church you know God's gonna reward those
[1:14:40] children one day for all their great
[1:14:42] work they the history says they barely
[1:14:44] had enough food but the children with
[1:14:47] and that's how they got their food was
[1:14:49] through the labors of the children for
[1:14:50] 12 years but they were free in the
[1:14:53] spirit um so guess what they did in
[1:14:57] their church they set up a modern-day
[1:14:59] internet in other words they set up a
[1:15:02] print press because they had the message
[1:15:07] but they couldn't just hope to
[1:15:09] themselves they had to get it out praise
[1:15:11] God
[1:15:12] they had to get it out so they built
[1:15:14] themselves their own printing press and
[1:15:16] distributed I think a thousand books
[1:15:18] before it finally word got back all the
[1:15:21] way back up to England what they were
[1:15:23] doing and English came down and shut him
[1:15:25] down
[1:15:25] they destroyed they burn up their house
[1:15:28] they burnt the printing press destroyed
[1:15:30] it all and now at this point they've
[1:15:35] been hearing about the new land and
[1:15:38] after 12 years they destroyed the
[1:15:40] printing press they took away their
[1:15:41] their right to their opportunity to
[1:15:44] print the Bible they sent books all over
[1:15:46] England and Scotland but that was the
[1:15:49] end of their printing ministry at least
[1:15:50] till they got to America and could print
[1:15:52] some more Bibles amen
[1:15:56] now they realized we are we have to we
[1:15:58] have to leave Holland they can't they
[1:16:02] felt like they couldn't go back to
[1:16:04] England and so they got two boats we all
[1:16:08] know the Mayflower right but they
[1:16:09] actually got to the second one was
[1:16:12] called the Speedwell and like what the
[1:16:13] guy said he said it wasn't speeding and
[1:16:15] it wasn't well half of the pilgrims got
[1:16:20] on the Speedwell half of them got on the
[1:16:23] Mayflower and off they went but a leak
[1:16:26] sprang in the Speedwell and it had to
[1:16:28] turn around and go back and both ships
[1:16:30] went back here because the other one had
[1:16:32] to provide for the needs of the other
[1:16:33] and they had to make a decision they're
[1:16:35] not really got one boat which one or
[1:16:37] what do we do
[1:16:38] do we all go give up and go back to
[1:16:39] England well they prayed and they felt
[1:16:41] led we're gonna split up we're gonna
[1:16:43] half we're gonna stay here go back to
[1:16:44] England to get established and just try
[1:16:48] to do all they can do and then the other
[1:16:50] group said we're gonna go across and
[1:16:51] where he said we're in the wilderness
[1:16:54] see because they were they were they
[1:16:56] were imagining themselves as an exodus
[1:16:58] lorry solely amen
[1:17:02] we're not taking a nap truck sis we're
[1:17:04] taking a supernatural Exodus amen
[1:17:07] over this earth into that seven
[1:17:10] dimension praise God in the presence of
[1:17:12] Jesus Christ himself amen
[1:17:15] but they were understood we're in excess
[1:17:18] we had to come out of the church Egypt
[1:17:20] and now they said we've got to wonder
[1:17:23] through the wilderness of this ocean in
[1:17:25] order
[1:17:26] they reach our desks our promised land
[1:17:27] hey with the message of the hour praise
[1:17:31] God because member I'm not in read all
[1:17:35] of it but they knew there was more than
[1:17:37] Luther they'd received Luther's message
[1:17:38] it was age they received that but they
[1:17:41] knew there was more to it than that they
[1:17:44] didn't want to just stay in Luther's
[1:17:45] teaching his Luther and passed away
[1:17:47] Luther passed away they don't as they
[1:17:49] knew the church was corrupt right the
[1:17:50] church would get corrupt would no matter
[1:17:51] where it was and so they wanted to start
[1:17:53] a new thing by the grace of the Lord
[1:17:55] now that Speedwell cracked they both
[1:17:57] came back
[1:17:58] the pastor John Robinson stayed with
[1:18:01] them to go back to England to Shepherd
[1:18:03] their souls that's that's interesting he
[1:18:09] decided to stay with the other ones to
[1:18:10] go back to England and try to survive
[1:18:12] the Mayflower takes half of them back
[1:18:16] now before they before they left let me
[1:18:19] read this here yeah I actually brought
[1:18:25] this before they even left Holland yeah
[1:18:27] well that's Holland we're here on the
[1:18:28] Mayflower to go william bradford writes
[1:18:32] this being ready to depart they had a
[1:18:35] day of solemn humiliation their pastor
[1:18:39] john robinson took his text from ezra
[1:18:41] 821 and i read that a few weeks ago I
[1:18:44] don't remember that or not and they're
[1:18:46] by the river by Ahava I proclaimed a
[1:18:50] fast that we might humble ourselves
[1:18:51] before our God and seek of him a right
[1:18:55] way for us and for our children and for
[1:18:58] our substance praise God
[1:19:01] so before they jumped on the Mayflower
[1:19:02] they got their inspiration from Ezra and
[1:19:05] Ezra was getting his and his inspiration
[1:19:08] was do I leave Babylon and go back to
[1:19:11] the promised land and try to reestablish
[1:19:13] restore worship and that's what he
[1:19:16] decided we're gonna pray and fast here
[1:19:18] by the river Ahava
[1:19:19] and let's see if God will take us back
[1:19:21] to begin restoration praise God amen and
[1:19:25] you know what happened God did God bless
[1:19:27] them God took Ezra back and Nehemiah and
[1:19:30] zubaba God to come back and help restore
[1:19:33] the worship praise God amen and so the
[1:19:36] pilgrims took their inspiration from
[1:19:38] that but we
[1:19:39] a fast and pray to see if God would have
[1:19:42] a do this and God answered and they felt
[1:19:44] led to go across the ocean so they spent
[1:19:51] an entire day church just praying and
[1:19:53] offering up prayers to God God should we
[1:19:55] go God do we get on this Mayflower you
[1:19:57] know the other one broke down God what
[1:19:58] do we do God and they prayed and said I
[1:20:00] won't eat any food because I'm eating
[1:20:02] God's Word oh let's find somebody that's
[1:20:05] sincere thanks God you're more
[1:20:07] interested in eating God's food than
[1:20:09] man's food where do we come from church
[1:20:13] we came from godly men like this who
[1:20:15] fasted and prayed and believed the Bible
[1:20:17] was the message of the hour bunch of
[1:20:20] small little holy rollers praise God
[1:20:23] finally they rejected few the little
[1:20:25] flock that's where we came from praise
[1:20:27] God
[1:20:28] that's right now here's what the last
[1:20:35] address pastor Robinson gave he said for
[1:20:43] he was very confident the Lord had more
[1:20:44] truth and light yet to break forth out
[1:20:47] of his Holy Word they knew there was
[1:20:50] more truth to be revealed out of the
[1:20:53] Word of God
[1:20:54] so he took occasion also miserably to
[1:20:56] bewail the state and condition of the
[1:20:58] Reformed churches who were come to a
[1:21:00] period a standstill and religion and
[1:21:02] would go no further than the instruments
[1:21:04] of their Reformation or their leaders of
[1:21:07] the Reformation ah they knew it they
[1:21:10] said we're not going to stay a part of
[1:21:11] the established churches we're not going
[1:21:13] to be just be part of the Reformation
[1:21:15] we've got to establish the restoration
[1:21:17] of the true Church of God he said the
[1:21:21] Lutheran's could not be drawn to go
[1:21:24] beyond what Luther saw he said the
[1:21:29] Calvinists he said cannot be drawn to go
[1:21:33] beyond what Calvin saw he said but we
[1:21:38] are ready and willing to embrace further
[1:21:41] light praise God
[1:21:43] amen thank the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:21:47] that's what God is sent in this day
[1:21:49] brothers message is a further I I'll say
[1:21:52] like this is
[1:21:53] final night to this age Amen how they do
[1:21:56] because my dad said his ministry was the
[1:21:58] last sign thus saith the Lord is the
[1:21:59] last sign to the Gentiles before the
[1:22:01] destruction it's the last light and that
[1:22:07] this message is actually where they
[1:22:08] decide to be called pilgrims I'm sorry
[1:22:09] so I said little early after this after
[1:22:12] John Robinson's message about embracing
[1:22:15] further light they said we're pilgrims
[1:22:17] praise God because they were all on a
[1:22:21] pilgrimage looking for the further
[1:22:23] revelation of truth that lay ahead as
[1:22:26] they walk in obedience to truth they
[1:22:29] already received Amen oh thank the Lord
[1:22:34] praise God so they prayed and prayed and
[1:22:38] prayed and they felt led to go after the
[1:22:41] day of prayer and fasting they got on
[1:22:43] there now most you know most you know
[1:22:45] this the trip over from England to North
[1:22:49] America was only a three-week journey
[1:22:51] during the good season but they left
[1:22:55] there September October November the
[1:22:58] worst time to sail on the ocean so their
[1:23:02] three-week journey 21 days turned into
[1:23:05] eight week journey
[1:23:06] and get this it was 66 days and there's
[1:23:11] 66 books in the Bible they had to endure
[1:23:16] all 66 ah that's the very reason they
[1:23:21] were handing over their praise God which
[1:23:23] for the sake of living in liberty and
[1:23:25] obedience that God's books every one of
[1:23:27] them not just a couple but all 66 amen
[1:23:35] 130 people aboard it was about a hundred
[1:23:37] or to say 102 pilgrims about 30 members
[1:23:43] of the of the crew they saw
[1:23:51] as a modern Jews taking a wilderness
[1:23:54] trip to the promised land but Church
[1:23:56] sickness was awful
[1:23:58] can you imagine using the restroom
[1:24:01] without trying to get really gross but
[1:24:02] how do you use the restroom on a ship
[1:24:05] like that
[1:24:06] they must have little bowls and then you
[1:24:08] dump him off the side or something I'm
[1:24:10] not sure how they did it but when it was
[1:24:12] storm it was just you know they would go
[1:24:14] below the deck obviously and there was
[1:24:16] only four and a half feet tall I'm
[1:24:18] almost 6 feet tall so the lower deck
[1:24:20] would we be round right here and they
[1:24:22] had to be crap all day he imagined with
[1:24:24] a man we crammed all day like this in
[1:24:25] the bottom you and your children and
[1:24:27] your family 66 days of that not not six
[1:24:30] minutes but four and a half feet and
[1:24:33] your delay down there a hundred thirty
[1:24:35] people crammed down that little
[1:24:38] Mayflower all for the sake of what this
[1:24:40] message

[1:24:45] Holy Spirit praise God amen then that
[1:24:49] makes me wonder who my is my life so
[1:24:51] hard is my life so difficult no it's not

[1:25:07] the Holy Spirit bring all things to our
[1:25:09] members so that we can serve God except
[1:25:11] ibly and reverently

[1:25:32] the history says they just went back and
[1:25:34] forward like this people throwing up all
[1:25:36] over down there for 66 days I want to
[1:25:44] read this one part it's just a beautiful
[1:25:46] let me read this it's almost a quote
[1:25:48] from this historian the seeds of the
[1:25:52] richest most prosperous nation in the
[1:25:57] entire history of humanity we're laying
[1:26:00] in the bottom of this tiny boat called
[1:26:03] the Mayflower
[1:26:05] okay picture picture of New York City
[1:26:07] the landscape picture all those big
[1:26:08] buildings picture any American
[1:26:13] civilization where the skyscrapers the
[1:26:15] Sears Tower in Chicago picture that the
[1:26:18] scenes of that what was he going to take
[1:26:20] to build that the seeds of that was
[1:26:22] laying in this little Mayflower going
[1:26:25] back and forth there would have been no
[1:26:28] Sears Tower
[1:26:29] there have been no Twin Towers then
[1:26:31] there have been no Washington DC and
[1:26:33] White House had there not been for some
[1:26:36] faithful message believers that endured
[1:26:39] eight weeks of torture eight weeks of
[1:26:43] torment the very seeds of this church a
[1:26:45] mehendi we're laying in the bottom of
[1:26:48] that boat amen let me say like this that
[1:26:51] was a special boat because there's a
[1:26:52] special God protecting that boat
[1:26:55] hallelujah but their tragedy struck them
[1:26:59] you know we the first person that died
[1:27:00] on the boat was his wife now he wasn't
[1:27:05] the governor yet but he was going to be
[1:27:06] the governor the first person who died
[1:27:09] was his wife who fell off the boat their
[1:27:12] sailing so she must have went up to
[1:27:13] maybe to do some business I don't know
[1:27:15] but she fell off the boat and the very
[1:27:19] pilgrims God we pray your blessing us
[1:27:21] we're making it the very god they're
[1:27:23] praying to allows this to happen and the
[1:27:26] history says they still praise God
[1:27:28] amidst all the tears they still never
[1:27:32] lost their vision despite seeing wives
[1:27:35] and then children dying and all these
[1:27:37] things they never lost their vision so
[1:27:40] you couldn't shake it from him why
[1:27:41] because it was written upon their hearts
[1:27:44] amen these weren't pushovers these
[1:27:48] weren't these little cartoon creatures I
[1:27:50] see at my school you know with little
[1:27:51] turkey guns and you know pilgrim hats
[1:27:54] and these little fuddy-duddies these
[1:27:56] were warriors these were men that knew
[1:28:00] God they knew the power of God
[1:28:02] they knew the grace of God they did the
[1:28:04] protection of God and they knew God's
[1:28:05] Word amen and the midst of tragedy they
[1:28:10] could seal with tears running down their
[1:28:11] faces it is God who gives and God who
[1:28:14] takes away
[1:28:15] the name of the Lord amen that's our
[1:28:19] foundation that's our family members
[1:28:21] praise God that's our ancestry is men
[1:28:23] and women like this that love God they
[1:28:27] knew their purpose was greater than the
[1:28:29] trials and tragedies of their
[1:28:31] experiencing right now so it is for you
[1:28:33] today the struggles you're going through
[1:28:37] the struggles I face are meaningless in
[1:28:40] comparison to God's will for our lives
[1:28:44] in other words God's will
[1:28:46] must be done the word must be kept hey
[1:28:50] man
[1:28:50] someone's gonna keep this word God is
[1:28:53] gonna preserve his word just like he
[1:28:55] preserved the way through them and I
[1:28:56] want to be one of those smaller number
[1:28:58] oh oh I want to be in that number praise
[1:29:01] God
[1:29:01] I want to be one of those Saints that
[1:29:04] goes marching up in the rapture and to
[1:29:06] the marriage supper laughs I want to be
[1:29:08] one of those Saints and how would I be
[1:29:09] if I keep the word now they had a great
[1:29:18] miracle they're out in the middle of the
[1:29:21] ocean and the main beam on the Mayflower
[1:29:24] cracked at the very base of it and the
[1:29:28] captain came down and he said he
[1:29:30] imagined him come and stomping down the
[1:29:31] steps he said prepare to meet your God
[1:29:33] that's when his door history says and
[1:29:36] the pilgrims there were still shaken but
[1:29:39] one of them said hey we brought a square
[1:29:41] wooden screw with us it's kind of screw
[1:29:43] used when you when you refile when you
[1:29:44] put a new foundation on a house you got
[1:29:46] to use a screw to kind of move the
[1:29:48] foundation somebody felt led of the Holy
[1:29:51] Spirit to bring a screw a wooden this
[1:29:52] grow so they said hey pass the screw
[1:29:54] down and the pilgrims weren't there
[1:29:56] there's water raisin the pilgrims went
[1:29:58] up there and they plug the hole with the
[1:30:00] screw screwed it in and it gave that
[1:30:03] support to the beam so the beam could
[1:30:05] hold hold the sails and everything and
[1:30:07] the people rejoice that was a second
[1:30:09] miracle praise God
[1:30:10] Oh Satan couldn't sink it why because
[1:30:13] God was in there you were in there
[1:30:16] phrase god I was in there I was in that
[1:30:19] ship dad wouldn't let us sink because

[1:30:34] her I left my grandpa back what does
[1:30:36] that big old screw doing here it has a
[1:30:37] purpose everything has a purpose God is
[1:30:42] not the author of confusion God is the
[1:30:45] author of peace praise God
[1:30:49] they seen one miracle after another
[1:30:53] while they're on the boat they wrote at
[1:30:55] the Mayflower Compact and they say we
[1:30:57] need to govern that's by the people and
[1:30:59] for the people and the Mayflower Compact
[1:31:03] that said we do this for the glory of
[1:31:05] God for the advancement of the Christian
[1:31:08] faith

[1:31:37] the promise restoration of the church
[1:31:40] praise God hallelujah
[1:31:47] and sixty-six books I mean days later
[1:31:52] sorry just 66 books of the Bible later
[1:31:56] they saw land and they landed on
[1:32:00] Plymouth Rock once they landed though
[1:32:03] the captain's like it's too cold August
[1:32:05] November it's too cold to go back to
[1:32:06] England now we'll die the captain wasn't
[1:32:09] a believer he wasn't a pilgrim he said
[1:32:11] our boat we're gonna we're gonna dock
[1:32:12] out we're gonna set the anchor down
[1:32:13] we're a dock out a mile offshore we'll
[1:32:16] just stay there during the day they take
[1:32:19] boats you know to come in now the
[1:32:20] pilgrim man they slept on the island and
[1:32:23] the women and children each say they'd
[1:32:25] work they send the women children out to
[1:32:26] the boat to sleep so that cover but the
[1:32:28] men just set up you know like little
[1:32:29] forts you know wooden parts and he said
[1:32:32] there was snow probably two or three
[1:32:33] feet deep said that you know shovel the
[1:32:36] snow out with their bare hands you know
[1:32:37] they had a few and a few tools you know
[1:32:39] they brought over on the boat
[1:32:42] but the first year was awful 47 out of
[1:32:47] 102 pilgrims died 55 what were only left
[1:32:51] almost half the church died almost half
[1:32:55] the church left and the church said so
[1:33:00] you can't look at numbers always as
[1:33:03] proof of God's favor or God's
[1:33:06] disapproval you know you know the most
[1:33:10] people that died died that was women
[1:33:12] because the women would sleep on top of
[1:33:16] their children with and without
[1:33:18] suffocating them to keep them warm so
[1:33:20] all the children survived that winter
[1:33:22] but most of the mothers died because
[1:33:25] they subjected themselves to the cold
[1:33:26] and they kept their children warm what
[1:33:30] sacrifice is that priests got no one to
[1:33:32] program said that's why the mothers
[1:33:33] she's got a mother's heart you know God
[1:33:37] took the rib out of Adam because it was
[1:33:38] close to his heart there's a mother's
[1:33:40] love right there most of the women died
[1:33:43] they slept on the children in the
[1:33:50] springtime with 55 of them left the
[1:33:53] captain said I'm going back to England
[1:33:54] boys y'all is ladies you all better get
[1:33:57] on here not a one of them one to go back
[1:34:00] they were singing I have decided to
[1:34:05] follow Jesus they said see ya see you
[1:34:12] later
[1:34:13] and God said them you know the story
[1:34:14] Squanto God said I'm Squanto how do we
[1:34:18] do that this land is different that we
[1:34:20] our crops are produced in the right way
[1:34:22] so God sent them a messenger to feed
[1:34:24] them naturally praise God and then the
[1:34:27] pilgrims had the spiritual food for the
[1:34:29] hem one the Squanto gave them natural
[1:34:33] and the pilgrims gave the Indian
[1:34:34] spiritual praise God yeah there was Wars
[1:34:37] and Fighting's and things like that but
[1:34:38] the real Christian pilgrims didn't wanna
[1:34:41] do anything any harm to the Native
[1:34:42] Americans all they wanted was a church
[1:34:44] and life where they were in Liberty to
[1:34:46] obey the Bible I don't want a queen or
[1:34:49] king telling me how to worship God I
[1:34:51] only want Jesus Christ the King of Kings
[1:34:54] tell
[1:34:54] me how to worship in the hey back and it
[1:34:57] was worth it it was worth to death it
[1:34:59] was worth it is structured it was worth
[1:35:01] of the sorrow and the tragedy so that we
[1:35:04] can serve God in the beauty of wholeness
[1:35:07] not being under denomination oh thank
[1:35:12] god
[1:35:13] I'm so happy today praise I just feel
[1:35:15] like dancing her out of it praise God
[1:35:16] why because I'm not controlled by
[1:35:19] denominational anti spirit I'm
[1:35:21] controlled by the Holy Spirit praise God
[1:35:23] amen and he whom the Sun sets free is
[1:35:27] free indeed amen
[1:35:29] I'm free to worship I'm free to live
[1:35:31] down I'm free no babies away and we're
[1:35:34] not controlled by man we're controlled
[1:35:36] by God but would you want to turn around
[1:35:41] and go back if you're a message believer
[1:35:46] you say I'll stay God's brought me this
[1:35:49] far he's gonna take me the rest of the
[1:35:51] way home for a haze God can I say like
[1:35:59] this if you look at it spiritually they
[1:36:02] had escaped that iron tooth beast that
[1:36:05] Daniel talked about right you had the
[1:36:07] the the bear and I say the lion the bear
[1:36:10] and the leopard this last this is the
[1:36:12] last Kingdom right last Gentile Kingdom
[1:36:15] it was a beast that had teeth like iron
[1:36:17] teeth and so they're on the boat and
[1:36:21] they get over they finally get these
[1:36:22] fresh crowns and they're like hey you
[1:36:24] guys want to go back to the iron tooth
[1:36:25] Beast No thank you I'm I'm quite happy
[1:36:28] over here
[1:36:29] where the Spirit of God has control of
[1:36:32] me and I'm not controlled by a beast
[1:36:34] power of that kind of beast power praise
[1:36:36] God they were controlled by the
[1:36:38] anointing to get the man praise God and
[1:36:40] then pretty soon the eagle anointing
[1:36:42] would come and they do it they knew
[1:36:46] there's a greater amazing than this
[1:36:47] there's more light to this word that we
[1:36:49] know but we're willing to separate
[1:36:51] ourselves until God sends it amen oh
[1:36:54] thank the Lord praise God
[1:37:00] said we'd rather die in the wilderness
[1:37:02] than go back to Egypt praise the Lord
[1:37:09] Amen what men and women of God praise
[1:37:14] the Lord I'm almost done
[1:37:16] that's one look at a few scriptures here
[1:37:24] you know they were they were so they
[1:37:26] were such Christians that there was a
[1:37:29] there was a pilgrim man who murdered
[1:37:32] somebody
[1:37:33] and the only witnesses were Native
[1:37:35] Americans and so they set up a court
[1:37:37] because the court was based upon the ten
[1:37:39] commandments and they said if we can
[1:37:41] find two or three witnesses that this
[1:37:42] man killed him he's got to die that's
[1:37:44] how far what they went back they went
[1:37:46] back to the law of Moses and they
[1:37:48] couldn't find any pilgrims that saw but
[1:37:50] two Native Americans come up and saw it
[1:37:52] and they gave their witness against this
[1:37:55] murder and they executed the manner talk
[1:37:59] about justice Church talk about
[1:38:03] righteousness see because they had the
[1:38:04] revelation all men are created equal
[1:38:06] knives of God what a man shows that
[1:38:10] shall you reap I don't know about the
[1:38:12] death penalty you know as far as today I
[1:38:13] don't know about that but I'm just
[1:38:16] showing you look how much they honored
[1:38:17] the Word of God they didn't favor well
[1:38:19] he's he's a pilgrim so I favor him see
[1:38:22] what see what see what it was he was
[1:38:23] born in the pilgrim church but he wasn't
[1:38:25] born from the heavenly church there's a
[1:38:29] man that's more than availab will not be
[1:38:31] a murderer
[1:38:32] praise God if he does is before I got
[1:38:35] saved a man like Moses right that's a
[1:38:39] good example of how all men they late in
[1:38:41] other words they lived out what they
[1:38:43] believed from the scripture because of
[1:38:46] that God honored them now a couple years
[1:38:50] is the last thing I know I just want to
[1:38:52] read this last history I want to read a
[1:38:54] few scriptures and we'll be done here

[1:40:34] so last story a couple summers after
[1:40:38] they were there it was the Summer of
[1:40:39] 1623 do I have it yeah okay yeah
[1:40:43] pilgrims of Puritans he chose pilgrims
[1:40:45] fast prayer yeah sorry fasting and
[1:40:48] prayer before the Mayflower trip here's
[1:40:50] what I wanted us to last stir Wintel in
[1:40:52] the drought of 1623 it says by a drought
[1:41:00] it continued from the third week in May
[1:41:03] until the middle of July can you imagine
[1:41:05] that
[1:41:05] no rain I've never seen that my lifetime
[1:41:08] I remember there was one drought in the
[1:41:09] 80s I was a young boy I don't remember
[1:41:11] the details but it might have been the
[1:41:12] summer of 88 yeah 88 or 89
[1:41:16] it was an awful drought everything was
[1:41:18] dead Brown you know but the the pilgrims
[1:41:21] in their first couple summers were this
[1:41:23] is one of their first couple summers and
[1:41:24] they're experiencing a drought no rain
[1:41:26] May June and now we're into July and it
[1:41:31] says without any rain the great heat for
[1:41:35] the most part the Corps began to wither
[1:41:37] away you ever feel like that
[1:41:40] your hopes are withering away raise
[1:41:44] little chairs if we like you know your
[1:41:46] hope to to get your family member save
[1:41:49] is withering away your hope to see
[1:41:53] America you know is withering away
[1:41:55] don't give up Church if God brought you
[1:41:59] this far he'll take you the rest of the
[1:42:01] way God didn't save you to lose you got
[1:42:07] him to save you so you would lose to the
[1:42:09] devil praise God
[1:42:10] right and they knew that they do we got
[1:42:14] to not bring us here for us to starve
[1:42:16] and die
[1:42:17] they knew the scripture but the corn
[1:42:22] began to wither the grounds got drier
[1:42:26] and parched to the the withered hay so
[1:42:29] the preachers said let's set aside a
[1:42:32] solemn day for humiliation to seek the
[1:42:35] Lord by humble and fervent prayer so the
[1:42:41] preachers like well pilgrims here we are
[1:42:43] we're Pilgrims and strangers of this
[1:42:45] land and our food is going to wither
[1:42:47] away we're gonna die if we if we don't
[1:42:48] get some rain here so they said what
[1:42:51] should we do we should start a new
[1:42:53] denomination no no we should you know
[1:42:58] just get drunk and eat drink and be
[1:43:00] merry because we're all gonna die no
[1:43:03] let's not revert to natural things let's
[1:43:04] pray so history says they set aside a
[1:43:08] day of prayer and what's interesting is
[1:43:11] that Bradford said all the Native
[1:43:12] Americans they weren't Christians they
[1:43:14] were just watching them because they're
[1:43:16] like hey we need some rain too and they
[1:43:18] could communicate you know they could
[1:43:19] translate they're just watching these
[1:43:22] guys pray all day history says it was
[1:43:24] blazing hot the whole day on this day of
[1:43:26] prayer and fasting sky was blue not a
[1:43:29] cloud in this
[1:43:30] guy and the Native Americans are like
[1:43:33] what these guys believe in God you know
[1:43:35] they they were they weren't trusted in
[1:43:37] God and history says at about evening
[1:43:43] time in the evening time it shall be
[1:43:45] liked but it wasn't like here it was
[1:43:48] rain in the evening time it began to get
[1:43:51] a little overcast and shortly after a
[1:43:56] rain with such sweet and gentle showers
[1:44:00] gave them cause of rejoicing and
[1:44:03] blessing God under those circumstances
[1:44:07] usually you get thunderstorms and
[1:44:10] lightning storms which would kill the
[1:44:11] crops but the Indians William sit back
[1:44:14] amazed like what is going on soft gentle
[1:44:17] rain and so I don't know if the Indians
[1:44:19] got converted
[1:44:20] but the Radford said they all had to
[1:44:22] witness that the pilgrims God was God
[1:44:25] they've had I that's what we need in our
[1:44:29] lives we need to seek God
[1:44:31] so our owner I don't say family and
[1:44:33] friends we'll see in the midst of our
[1:44:35] struggles when we cry out to God the
[1:44:37] Living God comes on the scene amen let's
[1:44:40] not be discouraged by our struggles
[1:44:42] their trials that God is alive so he can
[1:44:45] get the glory out of my say Matt
[1:44:52] Bradford said it was a gracious and
[1:44:55] speed answer seven weeks later no seven
[1:45:00] weeks of rain for rain they set one day
[1:45:02] aside and for seven weeks of no rain a
[1:45:05] sweet calm water pours then the rest of
[1:45:08] the year was great they got the harvest
[1:45:10] God spared their crop because of why
[1:45:14] prayer fasting and the desire to be the
[1:45:20] original book of Acts church there if we
[1:45:25] go to this altar so be to that original
[1:45:27] Church and we act upon it as Satan will
[1:45:30] bring up trials but if we got the desire
[1:45:32] God will help us and overcome every
[1:45:34] trial that comes against us praise God
[1:45:37] amen now
[1:45:42] few scriptures was that okay Oh about
[1:45:45] stirred my heart I just I'm like I'm
[1:45:47] reading this and I'm like it's 5:00 in
[1:45:49] the morning I'm like what in the world
[1:45:50] there were message believers they were
[1:45:51] looking for a greater light I was just
[1:45:53] like them I'm just like them I'm look
[1:45:57] I've received the greater light and now
[1:45:59] I'm trying to stablish real Christian
[1:46:01] worship amen
[1:46:03] trying to re-establish the book of Acts
[1:46:05] in Akron Ohio hallelujah so Church you
[1:46:14] and I are separatists right we have to
[1:46:17] continue separating from the things of
[1:46:19] the world we must do it Wednesday we'll
[1:46:24] look at the foundations of the founding
[1:46:26] fathers but remember this nation started
[1:46:29] out as a godly nation but revelation
[1:46:31] 13:11 says that this nation is now an
[1:46:35] unholy beast because it's power comes
[1:46:39] from the first beast pagan Rome then it
[1:46:43] had power you know to send fire from the
[1:46:45] heavens mother and said was the atomic
[1:46:46] bombs of World War two in 1944 if I'm
[1:46:49] not mistaken but fire to make fire fall
[1:46:53] from the heavens and and impress the men
[1:46:55] on the earth but see we're not our
[1:46:59] nation's not Christian like it was but
[1:47:01] there are Christians here praise God you
[1:47:03] and I are the modern-day pilgrims yeah
[1:47:13] now let's go to
[1:47:14] scripture here I was look up the
[1:47:15] scripture go to 2nd Timothy I just
[1:47:25] thought of it while I was praying up
[1:47:26] here I'm sorry it's 1st Timothy 6 sorry
[1:47:28] 1st Timothy 6 now Lord willing we'll
[1:47:33] pray in a little bit here as we close
[1:47:34] we'll pray that God will help us to
[1:47:36] remember some of these thoughts on
[1:47:37] Thursday at our Thanksgiving meals
[1:47:40] Church I tell you that turkey or that
[1:47:42] hams can taste a lot better and we can
[1:47:44] think about pilgrims falling off boats
[1:47:51] vomiting all kinds of sickness gross
[1:47:56] grossest all that they had to endure so
[1:47:59] we can have a real Thanksgiving
[1:48:03] 1st Timothy 6 now verse 5 is going to
[1:48:13] 1686 5 perverse disputing of men of
[1:48:16] corrupt minds into this destitute of the
[1:48:18] truth supposing that gain is godliness
[1:48:19] can you imagine telling those pilgrims
[1:48:21] oh if you were more golly you know you
[1:48:23] would have gained a bigger boat than the
[1:48:25] Mayflower if you really godly know don't
[1:48:28] confuse that the thing is God made a way
[1:48:30] praise God
[1:48:32] God made a way from such withdraw
[1:48:35] yourself but godliness with contentment
[1:48:38] is great gain you know you've got
[1:48:42] somewhere with Christ when you enjoy the
[1:48:46] fact that you're living a godly
[1:48:47] separated life no matter how much money
[1:48:50] or food or clothing you got you're just
[1:48:53] content with living a godly life I'm
[1:48:56] just happy to skip Thanksgiving because
[1:48:57] my children are all alive and they don't
[1:49:00] have disease and I'm not sick and I'm
[1:49:01] not in the hospital
[1:49:02] I'll just thankful I got a little bit of
[1:49:04] food a little bit of money in the bank I
[1:49:05] got a decent job you know see we should
[1:49:08] be used to be thankful for these things
[1:49:09] that we have praise God and it's a great
[1:49:11] achievement as a Christian to possess
[1:49:14] godliness with contentment but then the
[1:49:18] next morning Friday morning people say
[1:49:21] thanks Lord for the food they'll watch
[1:49:23] football all day basketball they'll show
[1:49:25] with other food and they'll push people
[1:49:27] line they'll cuss people
[1:49:28] to get the the latest TV the 5k TV or
[1:49:34] sweater that's on sale for 29 it was
[1:49:36] $79.99 but it's an on sale at Men's
[1:49:39] Wearhouse for 29 nine I'll put somebody
[1:49:41] down get out of my way you me but he
[1:49:43] bleepity bleep that's real thankful
[1:49:45] isn't it my goodness our lives should be
[1:49:50] a the Bible said a sweet savour unto the
[1:49:52] Lord as an offering of Thanksgiving sure
[1:49:56] you want to get nice gifts for your
[1:49:57] family let us have a Christian attitude
[1:49:59] while we do it praise God
[1:50:01] let's tell somebody Happy Thanksgiving I
[1:50:04] was doing that yesterday people looking
[1:50:05] at me uh all the off said happy
[1:50:06] Thanksgiving they're like whoa they're
[1:50:08] like they you know they're not used to
[1:50:09] people being nice to them I can't wait
[1:50:13] to say Merry Christmas thank God for His
[1:50:16] Son Jesus Christ can't wait to say that
[1:50:19] yes thank God for sending his son Jesus
[1:50:22] Christ I like that it's add a little bit
[1:50:23] to that can't wait to say that the Bible
[1:50:32] says verse 7 for we brought nothing into
[1:50:34] this world it's certain we could carry
[1:50:35] nothing out if anyone knew that the
[1:50:37] pilgrims knew that they we're gonna
[1:50:39] carry any of their possessions out in
[1:50:40] Holland or England
[1:50:42] they weren't - they were gonna carry
[1:50:43] anything out all I wanted was godliness
[1:50:45] the ability to lead live in the liberty
[1:50:48] of the Holy Spirit under the guidance of
[1:50:51] God in complete obedience to the Word of
[1:50:53] God and I'll be happy with that glory
[1:50:57] and having food and raiment let us be R
[1:51:00] with be content ascend to our feet but
[1:51:04] they that will be rich fall into
[1:51:06] temptation and a snare and too many
[1:51:08] foolish and hurtful lusts which drown
[1:51:10] men in destruction and perdition for the
[1:51:13] love of money is the root of all evil
[1:51:16] the love of it which while some
[1:51:21] after they have erred from the faith and
[1:51:23] pierced themselves see who did they hurt
[1:51:25] when they loved me they hurt themselves
[1:51:27] they damaged their own Souls right they
[1:51:31] they they destroy their own walk with
[1:51:33] God because they love money more than
[1:51:35] love godliness pierced them through with
[1:51:39] many sorrows see why they can't have to
[1:51:42] be happy at church they can't be happy
[1:51:44] at church because they haven't received
[1:51:46] God's Word they want to receive money
[1:51:49] they want to receive the riches and all
[1:51:51] these things so when they come they're
[1:51:52] just sorrowful they know they can't get
[1:51:54] excited about spiritual riches they
[1:51:56] don't get excited about talking about
[1:51:57] heaven they don't get excited about the
[1:52:00] mayor's self or the lamb praise God it
[1:52:02] doesn't excite them anymore
[1:52:03] because they're just sorrowful they just
[1:52:05] want things down here why can't it go my
[1:52:07] way Micah what if the pilgrims would
[1:52:08] have said that why can't it go my way my
[1:52:11] wife had to be strip-searched right in
[1:52:13] front of everybody I can have it my way
[1:52:15] my wife and children are back there in
[1:52:17] England I'm here in Holland for a whole
[1:52:19] year I can't have it my way it's not
[1:52:21] about our way it's about God's Way hey
[1:52:24] man we keep the word we obey the word we
[1:52:27] keep the vision of the complete
[1:52:29] restoration and whenever God allows
[1:52:31] he'll allow it in his wisdom but we got
[1:52:34] to have grace to be thankful in the
[1:52:35] midst of our trials
