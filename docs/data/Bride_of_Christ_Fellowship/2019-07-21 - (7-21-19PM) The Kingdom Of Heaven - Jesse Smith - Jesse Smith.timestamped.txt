[32:10] [Music]
[33:19] I like to look at this thought as I
[33:28] mentioned this morning I'm gonna combine
[33:29] the thoughts here and we'll try to keep
[33:32] it pretty good time we were texting
[33:37] without hearing and listening to God so
[33:38] I want to combine that with the kingdom
[33:40] of God and we want to just read a few
[33:44] scriptures here let's go to Luke 17
[33:47] we'll start there Luke 17 verse 20
[33:59] [Music]
[34:12] Luke 17 verse 20 Thank You Lydia let's
[34:17] read 20 and 21 here tonight that'll be
[34:19] our text and that will have you be
[34:21] seated after this verse 20
[34:24] I'll read verse 20 and then we call read
[34:27] verse 21 verse 20 says and when he was
[34:30] demanded the Pharisees when the kingdom
[34:31] of God should come he answered and said
[34:34] the kingdom of God cometh not with
[34:36] observation I think you already know my
[34:40] my concept the kingdom of God cometh not
[34:43] with observation so it didn't come with
[34:45] any physical observation verse 21
[34:49] neither shall they say lo here or lo
[34:51] there for behold the kingdom of God is
[34:55] within you
[34:56] so now think about the day of Pentecost
[34:59] when it come was there any earthquake to
[35:00] let them know is there any lightning
[35:02] storm or anything like that no they had
[35:05] some of that you know 50 days before
[35:07] when Jesus resurrected but that day when
[35:10] the Holy Ghost came there was no
[35:11] observation it just came quickly like
[35:14] the wind and he said because the kingdom
[35:17] of God is within you
[35:20] so yeah you may have your seats here I
[35:22] think we'll start right there by God's
[35:23] grace so we like to look at
[35:29] thought of the kingdom of God tonight
[35:31] and also like hearing and listening to
[35:34] God I want to read some scripture here
[35:40] so let's go to Ephesians chapter 4 I
[35:42] think I'll just start there
[35:46] you know you can hear from God in many
[35:48] ways and I think I think the first way I
[35:51] think we'll look at is Ephesians 4 the
[35:54] first ways through the preaching of the
[35:56] word so when we come to church and
[36:01] humble ourselves and and listen to the
[36:04] Word of God that's one way we can
[36:06] certainly hear from the Lord so
[36:10] Ephesians 4 and I want to start at verse
[36:13] 8 Asian's 4 8 wherefore he saith when he
[36:21] ascended up on high so this is speaking
[36:22] of Christ when Christ's body went up to
[36:25] heaven after the resurrection he led
[36:27] captivity captive he took all those who
[36:30] were captive in Abraham's bosom right he
[36:33] he basically took them captive and led
[36:35] them to heaven and verse 8 says and he
[36:39] gave gifts unto men now verse 9 now he
[36:43] that ascended and what is it but that he
[36:45] also descended first into the lower
[36:47] parts of the earth so Paul says remember
[36:50] Jesus before he ascended he actually
[36:52] went to hell and rescue them and got the
[36:55] keys of death and hell the Bible says so
[36:57] he rescued Abraham and Jacob and Jobe
[37:00] and all the saints praise God he rescued
[37:03] him there amen
[37:06] but what he first descended first and
[37:08] lower parts of the earth verse 10 he
[37:10] that descended is the same also that
[37:13] ascended up far above all heavens that
[37:16] he might fill all things now verse 11 is
[37:22] we're going to get to here and the Bible
[37:25] said and he gave some apostles now these
[37:27] are missionaries that go out and they
[37:30] start churches in places that have never
[37:32] heard the gospel and some prophets
[37:35] prophets foretell events in the name of
[37:37] the Lord and some evangelists
[37:40] evangelists go to establish churches and
[37:42] they
[37:43] relight and ignite fires in people's
[37:46] lives you know they set them back on
[37:47] fire and some pastors that's what I am I
[37:50] stay in one place and I Shepherd a
[37:52] little sheet a little flock of sheep and
[37:54] then there's teachers that they can
[37:57] teach deeper and more more clearly than
[38:00] anybody else than the other preaching
[38:02] gifts so Jesus said I'm gonna go to
[38:04] heaven but I'm gonna send you five gifts
[38:08] and this will take care of you while
[38:10] you're there on the earth now verse
[38:12] verse 12 he sent these five gifts for
[38:16] the perfecting of the Saints for the
[38:19] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[38:21] the body of Christ there's a lot in here
[38:23] I just want to show the way we'll hear
[38:27] from God the way will be perfected and
[38:29] work our ministry is by listening to the
[38:32] five preaching gifts verse 13 until so
[38:36] these preaching gifts are gonna be here
[38:37] Paul says until we all come in the unity
[38:40] of faith right until all the churches
[38:42] can gather round on the truth of God and
[38:44] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[38:47] perfect man unto the measure of the
[38:50] stature of the fullness of Christ so how
[38:54] many want to be a real a full Christian
[38:56] I'm gonna be a full Christian so the
[38:57] Bible says these five preaching gifts if
[38:59] you if you listen to these gifts that
[39:01] Jesus sent he said he went up to heaven
[39:03] he sent these five gifts if you listen
[39:06] to those you'll come into the fullness
[39:08] of the measure of Christ so each person
[39:10] has a portion of Christ that they can
[39:12] grow up into some can grow up into more
[39:15] than others depending on their calling
[39:17] in life and we know that because
[39:19] remember the Apostle Paul said he said I
[39:21] labored more than all the eleven
[39:23] apostles now Judas was one of them
[39:25] twelve but Judas fell he was lost so
[39:28] Paul was saying I labored more I wasn't
[39:30] one of the twelve apostles but I labeled
[39:32] labored more than all of them so he had
[39:35] a he had a commission he had a plan that
[39:37] God had for him that would have a
[39:39] greater reward it was a higher calling
[39:41] than the rest of them now if you would
[39:45] let's let's go to verse 14 so if you
[39:47] listen to these five preaching gifts in
[39:49] verse 14 that you henceforth be no more
[39:52] children so if you listen these five
[39:54] gifts you'll become a mature Christian
[39:56] instead of a baby
[39:57] or a toddler Christian right tossed to
[40:01] and fro you get tossed from one idea one
[40:03] church to the next you know you're
[40:04] tossed all over the place and carried
[40:06] about with every wind of doctrine
[40:08] sometimes you believe this sometimes you
[40:09] believe that these these winds of
[40:11] doctors blow you all around you don't
[40:13] even know what to believe right by the
[40:15] slate of men that's the trickery or
[40:17] deception of men and the cunning
[40:19] craftiness whereby that Lyon they lie in
[40:22] wait to deceive verse 15 but speaking
[40:25] the truth in love may grow up into him
[40:27] in all things which is the head even
[40:30] Christ so we listen these five preaching
[40:33] gifts will be real full Christians we
[40:36] won't be tossed and confused and
[40:38] wandering going here and there will be
[40:40] solid praise God will have a place where
[40:43] we can be a pillar like the Bible said
[40:44] you'll be a pillar in the house of God
[40:46] and you'll grow up and you'll speak the
[40:48] truth in love one thing they'll know
[40:50] about you is that you love Jesus glory
[40:53] so that's the first way now there's
[40:57] other ways let's go to first Corinthians
[40:58] 12 here's another way to hear from God
[41:01] is through other Christians that are not
[41:04] preachers and these are called the nine
[41:07] gifts of the Holy Spirit first
[41:08] Corinthians 12 let's go to verse 7 first
[41:20] Corinthians 12:7 now we got to be
[41:26] careful a lot of people and I was raised
[41:28] in a church also that they took the gift
[41:32] of tongues and they made it the most
[41:34] important gift but it's actually not the
[41:35] most important gift I tried to share
[41:38] with the pastor and you know later on
[41:39] when I learned it that you know they try
[41:42] to force everybody to speak in tongues
[41:43] and that's that's not scriptural you
[41:45] know that's not in the Bible but I love
[41:48] them you know I appreciate them and
[41:49] there was a girl I was a thankful for
[41:51] the church I was raised in but the Bible
[41:54] says here that the first verse or the
[41:56] first gift is wisdom it and wisdom has
[41:59] to rule all the other eight gifts
[42:01] because there's nine gifts of the Holy
[42:02] Spirit so there's 5 preaching gifts that
[42:04] will speak to you and then there's 9
[42:08] gifts of the Holy Spirit that can speak
[42:09] to you as well and do great things so
[42:11] 1st Corinthians 12 verse 7 but the
[42:14] manifestation of the Spirit is given to
[42:16] every man to profit withal so see
[42:18] everybody has a spiritual gift whether
[42:21] they're close to God or far from God
[42:24] everybody has a gift verse 8 for to one
[42:29] is given by the spirit the word of
[42:31] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[42:33] by the same spirit to another faith by
[42:36] the same spirit to another the gifts of
[42:39] healing by the same spirit to another
[42:42] the working of miracles to another
[42:44] prophecy to another discerning of
[42:48] spirits to another divers kinds of
[42:51] tongues and to another the
[42:53] interpretation of tongues but all these
[42:55] worketh that one in the self same spirit
[42:57] dividing to every man severally as he
[43:01] will
[43:01] so who determines your gift God
[43:03] determines your gift now the trouble of
[43:06] our church that I was raised in they
[43:08] said everybody's got to speak in tongues
[43:09] well that's going against the scripture
[43:11] because the scripture said God
[43:12] determines which gift you get now we
[43:15] appreciate gifts of tongues but we can't
[43:17] make that the gift because look at verse
[43:19] 29 not everybody has every gift because
[43:23] verse 29 says are all apostles is
[43:26] everybody a missionary no if everybody
[43:28] was a missionary there'd be no need to
[43:29] have home churches right because
[43:32] everybody would be out trying to make
[43:34] more churches there'd be no reason to
[43:35] have a home church are all apostles no
[43:37] are all prophets no I've never really
[43:39] prophesied as far as I know
[43:41] are all teachers I believe I'm a teacher
[43:43] are all workers of miracles no not
[43:45] everybody does miracles verse 30 have
[43:48] all gifts of healing no do all speak
[43:50] with tongues see no and that's what I
[43:53] tried to share with our pastor back home
[43:54] but you know he just he had to believe
[43:57] that that's okay that's his his desire
[43:58] do all interpret no so see verse 31 but
[44:05] covet earnestly the best gifts and yet I
[44:08] shown to you a more excellent way okay
[44:11] so we should desire the best gifts the
[44:14] best gifts are wisdom and knowledge
[44:16] because it goes in order wisdom
[44:17] knowledge then faith and then healing
[44:21] praise God
[44:22] so those are the best gifts so let me
[44:24] give an example go to Psalms 118 my mom
[44:27] was dying of cancer I remember I was in
[44:29] second grade I went to the hospital and
[44:31] she's in her white robe there on the on
[44:33] her deathbed they gave her six months to
[44:35] live and and I thought she was gonna
[44:38] everybody thought she was gonna die
[44:39] liver cancer but God anointed one of the
[44:43] gifts of the Holy Spirit my mom's alive
[44:45] today because God God's a healer without
[44:49] radiation she would just vanish her
[44:50] cancer just vanished when I was in the
[44:52] second grade so I've known since I've
[44:53] been in 2nd grade that Jesus Christ is a
[44:55] healer praise God and she came to Bible
[44:58] club two years ago and she gave her
[44:59] testimony in Bible club the kids got to
[45:00] hear her testimonies is a beautiful
[45:03] testimony Psalms 1:18 17 so a woman was
[45:08] praying in my mom's Church and and the
[45:14] Holy Spirit told her go tell Ruby my
[45:16] mom's name is Ruby go tell Ruby this
[45:18] scripture she's going to be healed and
[45:22] so this woman walked into my mom's
[45:24] hospital room I wasn't there my dad I
[45:27] think was asam's 1 18 17 says I shall
[45:30] not die but live and declare the works
[45:32] of the Lord so the Holy Spirit anointed
[45:35] this woman in the church and she came in
[45:37] you know praying and crying and she was
[45:39] so you know anoint of the Holy Spirit
[45:40] and so basically this woman gave my
[45:44] mother a word a prophecy plus it was a
[45:47] gift of healing who actually it known as
[45:49] prophecy kind like a word of knowledge
[45:51] as well and as soon as that woman told
[45:54] me
[45:55] mom this scripture my mom believed it
[45:57] she believed it she's like I'm not gonna
[46:01] die and all the doctors are like this
[46:02] woman's crazy which that's that's their
[46:06] job their job is to look at their job is
[46:08] to look at the medical books but our job
[46:10] is to look at the the real book when
[46:13] it's God's will God doesn't heal every
[46:14] time but and the time does gods heal
[46:16] we're supposed to look in God's book and
[46:19] so what happened was I don't know how
[46:21] long it was but the doctor said you know
[46:24] Ruby we're gonna open you up and try to
[46:26] take out some of this liver cancer well
[46:28] the night before the surgery my dad
[46:30] walked over and now here's where the
[46:31] gift the healing worked God anointed my
[46:34] dad he put his hand on my mom's liver
[46:37] there on this you know the skin above it
[46:38] and said I rebuke this cancer in the
[46:41] name of Jesus Christ and my dad said he
[46:43] felt a warm sensation there it got real
[46:45] hot and then he just you know and it is
[46:48] prayer well the next day they cut my mom
[46:50] open she showed me the scar and they
[46:52] can't find any cancer and so we see
[46:55] that's see that's a way God speaks to us
[46:57] through these nine gifts of the Holy
[46:58] Spirit praise God so God used the word
[47:01] of prophecy right right from the
[47:03] scripture wasn't a sermon my mom heard
[47:06] it was one of the nine gifts of the Holy
[47:07] Spirit praise God and there's been
[47:12] different times you know we can all how
[47:14] many could raise your hands say you've
[47:15] seen a time where the nine gifts of the
[47:16] Holy Spirit I've operated praise God
[47:18] we saw healing a couple weeks ago I
[47:19] don't know if I share this with brother
[47:20] Andy or not but I went to my brother cam
[47:23] Church a couple weeks ago and preached
[47:25] and there was a woman there and she had
[47:26] she had cloudy eyes only in the middle
[47:30] of her eyesight could she see died sure
[47:31] that last week okay I did and so we
[47:33] prayed for her son but while we pray for
[47:35] a son God healed her eyes so that's a
[47:38] that's a that's an example of the gift
[47:41] of healing you might even say it's a
[47:43] miracle actually I don't know for sure I
[47:44] have to talk to her about that but if it
[47:46] happens instantly then it's a miracle if
[47:48] it takes time it's a gift of healing
[47:51] right miracle something that happens
[47:53] instantly there's no way to explain it
[47:55] it was just the hand of God but healing
[47:57] can take like you could pray for
[47:59] somebody and they could get healed a
[48:01] week later okay so that's the difference
[48:03] between those gifts so God can speak in
[48:06] those ways
[48:08] and that's one way to hear from God so
[48:10] hope everybody can see God speaks
[48:13] through the fivefold preaching ministry
[48:14] and then God can also speak through the
[48:20] nine gifts of the Spirit now let's go to
[48:22] Galatians chapter one now here's how to
[48:25] know if God is speaking to you in any
[48:29] situation so in any situation you can
[48:32] know if it's the Word of God or not now
[48:36] there are times of course God will let
[48:37] us struggle and we're not sure and and
[48:39] we might go through like what's called a
[48:41] test the Bible set a test of faith for
[48:45] Galatians 1 verse 8 and the way to know
[48:50] is if that voice or message does it line
[48:54] up with the rest of the Bible that's the
[48:56] way to know okay so Galatians 1 verse 8
[49:01] but though we or an angel from heaven
[49:03] preach any other gospel unto you than
[49:06] that which you have preached unto you
[49:09] let him be accursed now that's quite a
[49:11] statement Paul saying if anybody
[49:13] preaches anything different than what
[49:15] you've already heard they're cursed
[49:17] verse 9 as we said before so say I now
[49:21] again if any man preach any other gospel
[49:22] into you than what you have received let
[49:25] him be accursed for do I now persuade
[49:27] men or God or do I seek to please men
[49:29] for if yet I please men I should not be
[49:31] the servant of Christ but I certify you
[49:35] brethren the gospel which was preached
[49:37] of me is not after man here it is verse
[49:39] 12 for neither received it I'm sorry for
[49:42] I neither received it of men nor neither
[49:45] was I taught it but by the revelation of
[49:47] Jesus Christ amen that's why if anybody
[49:51] tells you anything that's that's
[49:52] contrary to the New Testament teaching
[49:54] you can say that's a lie because the
[49:57] Bible says this because Paul was taught
[49:59] the gospel by Jesus Christ and if you're
[50:02] saying something that goes against the
[50:03] gospel of Jesus Christ you got the wrong
[50:05] spirit and that's actually called the
[50:07] this the the gift of discernment like we
[50:09] just read in 1st could' is 12
[50:10] discernment means to judge so when you
[50:13] judge between this is the right spirit
[50:14] or the wrong spirit now you've got
[50:16] discernment that's the gift of
[50:17] discernment to judge between the right
[50:19] spirits
[50:20] and the wrong ones okay so that's
[50:23] another way to judge it as well and go
[50:27] to Romans chapter 2 here's another way
[50:29] to know
[50:30] here's another time Paul says this
[50:32] Romans chapter 2 2:16 Romans 2:16 see
[50:44] this New Testament is so important that
[50:46] Paul says God is going to judge each one
[50:49] of us by the New Testament writings
[50:52] that's why this Bible so dear to my
[50:54] heart because I know I'm gonna be judged
[50:56] by it so I want to live it praise God I
[50:59] wonder whatever says that's what I want
[51:01] to do see in that day when God shall
[51:03] judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[51:07] according to my gospel so every one of
[51:12] us are gonna be judged by this Bible did
[51:14] we live this Bible do we obey this Bible
[51:18] that's how you know like for example
[51:20] with that woman who told my mom about
[51:21] that you know that scripture lined up
[51:24] with the Word of God right so and if she
[51:28] felt it if she felt that was God's Word
[51:30] to her and she believed it didn't
[51:31] disagree with the Bible then you believe
[51:34] it
[51:34] praise God that's one good example of
[51:36] that now I'll go to one more revelation
[51:39] 22:18 and 19 so the Bible ends with one
[51:44] last warning that if anything is spoken
[51:49] contrary to the Word of God then you
[51:53] know it's not though it's not hearing
[51:55] from God revelation 22:18 and 19
[52:07] alright verse 18 for I testify unto
[52:10] every man that heareth the words of the
[52:11] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[52:14] add unto these things God shall add unto
[52:16] Him the plagues that are written this
[52:18] book this is not Old Testament church
[52:21] this is New Testament right so this is
[52:24] still the but still serious thing to be
[52:26] a Christian God still has high calling
[52:30] we got to be careful how we live our
[52:31] lives and make sure it's pleasing unto
[52:33] God
[52:33] verse 19 and if any man shall take away
[52:36] from the words of the book of this
[52:37] prophecy God shall take away his part
[52:40] out of the book of life and out of the
[52:42] holy city and from the things where it's
[52:44] your written in this book so we have a
[52:46] responsibility we can't add to it or
[52:48] take away from it praise God
[52:52] now I just want to give a few examples
[52:54] go to first Timothy now and I do
[52:57] apologize you know I don't have this
[52:59] scripture but first Timothy 2 here's a
[53:05] popular here's let me do two examples
[53:11] let me do women preachers and
[53:13] homosexuality and I and you know some
[53:16] people may not understand what the Bible
[53:20] says about it that's why we made the
[53:22] YouTube videos you know to try to show
[53:24] that the Bible is against both you know
[53:27] the Bible is against women preaching and
[53:29] leading churches and the Bible's against
[53:31] homosexuality and that doesn't mean we
[53:33] condemn people we don't send them to
[53:35] hell but we pray for them right and we
[53:37] ask God to be merciful so let me just
[53:40] give an example here the Bible says
[53:44] verse 11 first Timothy 2:11 let the
[53:48] woman learn in silence with all
[53:49] subjection but I suffer not a woman to
[53:54] teach nor to assert authority over the
[53:57] man but to be in silence so when it
[53:59] comes to someone preaching the Word of
[54:01] God the Paul says I don't allow a woman
[54:04] to teach men now here you say we might
[54:08] say why well verse 13 tells us for Adam
[54:11] was first formed then Eve and Adam was
[54:14] not deceived but the woman being
[54:17] deceived was in the transgression
[54:20] so God
[54:21] goes back and he tells us why in the
[54:23] beginning the man was not deceived the
[54:26] woman was deceived and she was deceived
[54:28] away from believing the word so God said
[54:31] because of that she can't teach and I'm
[54:33] gonna have the man lead now he's not a
[54:35] better person because in Christ were all
[54:38] one in Christ Jesus
[54:39] everyone's equally as valuable but
[54:42] because of that God gives man the
[54:44] leadership because he was created first
[54:47] and she came out of him so he's just
[54:49] called to be the leader right but if he
[54:52] doesn't lead well he gets a greater
[54:53] condemnation so with more responsibility
[54:58] and power I'm sorry with more power
[54:59] comes more responsibility so verse 13
[55:05] notwithstanding she shall be saved in
[55:06] childbearing sea she's called with the
[55:08] children if they continue in faith and
[55:10] charity and holiness with sobriety now
[55:12] the same man that wrote this said if you
[55:14] change any of this you're cursed right
[55:17] and so we're not trying to put curses on
[55:21] anybody because I know there's a lot of
[55:22] big churches that let women preach but
[55:24] we're just standing here we're just
[55:26] standing here holding the flag and
[55:27] saying this is this is the real
[55:28] Christianity praise God this is the real
[55:31] Bible teaching amen and it's not with
[55:33] anger we say that it's with love we say
[55:35] that we're holding the banner of the
[55:37] true gospel of Jesus Christ
[55:39] now here another example which I have
[55:42] some friends that are homosexual and try
[55:44] to be kind you know but the Bible says
[55:48] it's go to at Romans chapter 1 the Bible
[55:49] says it's wrong and the Bible actually
[55:53] says when a person accepts that and
[55:56] believes that they've actually lost
[55:58] their right mind Paul says that so I
[56:03] just want to lay and I hope this is
[56:05] helpful these two examples right you can
[56:07] see two examples how moderate a lot of
[56:09] modern churches today will just say well
[56:10] what they're doing is they're actually
[56:12] taking that scripture out of the out of
[56:14] their teaching and if they take away
[56:17] from the word we just read it then their
[56:19] names can be taken out of the book of
[56:20] life now we pray there is a way out and
[56:23] it's repentance for any of us if I sin
[56:27] if you sin you know whoever no matter
[56:29] what if we sin God will forgive us if we
[56:31] repent he's merciful he's long-suffering
[56:34] he
[56:35] he would that all men be saved amen but
[56:37] we got a humble ourselves and say we're
[56:39] wrong and the Bible's right we have to
[56:42] say that praise God because this is what
[56:45] we're gonna be judged by we just read
[56:46] that you and I will all be judged by
[56:48] this Bible right here Paul's gospel now
[56:51] Romans 1 and Church it's in it's in
[56:55] three places in the New Testament Paul
[56:58] says homosexuality is wrong so it's not
[57:02] just one time it's it's numerous times
[57:06] all right now there's there's a couple
[57:10] places let's just go to verse 24 just so
[57:12] everybody can see it so this is this is
[57:14] these are two examples of how we can
[57:16] hear from God and listen to God you know
[57:19] with with someone's calling am I called
[57:22] to preach or not and even a relationship
[57:24] should I have a homosexual relationship
[57:26] or not these are just two simple
[57:28] examples of a few you know the way you
[57:30] know if it's of God is to take it back
[57:32] to the word so Romans 1:24 wherefore God
[57:37] also gave them up to their uncleanness
[57:39] through the lusts of their own hearts to
[57:41] dishonour their own bodies between
[57:43] themselves now this is speaking of
[57:45] homosexuality you'll see in a minute who
[57:47] changed the truth of God into a lie and
[57:49] worshipped and served the creature more
[57:51] than the Creator who is blessed forever
[57:53] amen for this cause God gave them up
[57:56] unto vile affections for even their
[58:00] women did change the natural use into
[58:03] that which is against nature so he's
[58:06] talking about lesbians here verse 27 and
[58:08] likewise also the men which men are
[58:10] called sodomites right leaving the
[58:13] natural use of the woman burned in their
[58:15] lust one toward another men with men
[58:18] working that which is unseemly and
[58:21] receiving in themselves that recompence
[58:24] of the air which was meat now he's
[58:26] speaking of sodom and gomorrah which was
[58:28] given over to sodomites or men that were
[58:31] homosexual and what happened them God
[58:33] burned it with fire and we know Peter
[58:36] says gods can do the same thing with it
[58:38] this earth but first he's going to
[58:40] rapture the church out of here then he's
[58:42] gonna burn it with fire amen
[58:44] he's gonna rescue his believers he's in
[58:46] a rescue the children of God and then
[58:48] the Bible says
[58:49] burn it with fervent heat and they's
[58:51] gonna bring back his Saints praise God
[58:52] and have a thousand-year honeymoon aim
[58:54] the head glory yes
[58:57] verse 28 and even as they did not like
[59:03] to retain God in their knowledge see
[59:05] they don't like the Bible God gave them
[59:07] over to see right here there's a
[59:09] reprobate mind so see God God gives him
[59:12] over to a rejected mind to do think but
[59:15] you're not convenient so someone who is
[59:17] homosexual homosexual I hate to say it
[59:20] and I'm not judging them but the Bible
[59:22] says God has to give them over to a
[59:25] different kind of mind because they've
[59:27] rejected the knowledge of God and this
[59:30] Bible is the knowledge of God to do
[59:32] those things which are not convenient
[59:34] verse 29 being filled with all
[59:36] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[59:38] covetousness maliciousness full of envy
[59:41] murder debate deceit malignity
[59:43] whisperers backbiters haters of god
[59:46] despiteful proud boasters inventors of
[59:48] evil things disobedient to parents
[59:50] without understanding covenantbreakers
[59:52] without natural affection implacable
[59:54] unmerciful who knowing the judgment of
[59:58] God see they know the judgments of God
[59:59] that they which commit such are worthy
[1:00:01] of death not only do the same but have
[1:00:03] pleasure and then that do them and now
[1:00:06] they do it in parades right the lgbtq
[1:00:09] and and church we're not we're not
[1:00:12] condemning them but we're warning them
[1:00:14] if they don't repent then the wrath of
[1:00:16] God is the only thing left for them and
[1:00:19] we pray for them I pray for them many
[1:00:21] times amen
[1:00:22] everyone remember 2015 when the Supreme
[1:00:24] Court first did that my I pray too late
[1:00:26] on my face right here and I prayed and
[1:00:28] cried out to God that God would end it
[1:00:31] but it's still allowed to go but see the
[1:00:34] real child of God cries out and say God
[1:00:36] save what you can amen but we know all
[1:00:40] the prophecy says the world has to get
[1:00:42] more wicked and wicked and wicked and
[1:00:43] then God will judge it but then God will
[1:00:46] start all over Amen alright now I hope
[1:00:50] you can see that two clear examples
[1:00:52] women pastors preachers are not
[1:00:55] preaching to men and then a
[1:00:57] homosexuality to kind of controversial
[1:01:00] subjects but they're not controversial
[1:01:02] to the
[1:01:03] because the Bible is clear you're never
[1:01:05] gonna find Jesus calling a woman to lead
[1:01:08] a bunch of men you'll never find that
[1:01:10] you never it was never in the Old
[1:01:12] Testament either they always bring up
[1:01:15] Deborah but Deborah was a judge and a
[1:01:18] judge doesn't lead the priesthood led a
[1:01:21] man Aaron and the priesthood and
[1:01:24] although all the priests at the
[1:01:25] tabernacle they're the ones that led the
[1:01:27] people of God a judge was just a judge
[1:01:30] they were just they had their place in
[1:01:32] the judicial system but they weren't the
[1:01:33] leaders of the people the leaders were
[1:01:35] the priests praise God so and of course
[1:01:39] homosexual and that's always been Old
[1:01:42] Testament New Testament that's always
[1:01:43] been condemned and that's the Word of
[1:01:46] God so we we just reach out and we pray
[1:01:49] and we ask God to minister and oh we had
[1:01:52] a good testimony about that yeah brother
[1:01:53] Dennis McBride from South Carolina did I
[1:01:56] share this he started a church of about
[1:02:00] 8 or 9 years ago down there and real
[1:02:01] small smaller than ours now that's hard
[1:02:03] to get that's really hard to get Church
[1:02:05] small huh but he started the church and
[1:02:08] then one of the women in his church in
[1:02:10] this previous church back slid and went
[1:02:12] into a lesbian lifestyle and she got
[1:02:15] really far from God but then she heard
[1:02:18] brother Dennis was a pastor and she
[1:02:21] always had respect for brother Dennis a
[1:02:23] real man of God
[1:02:24] and at that moment she started going to
[1:02:27] his church and they and she started
[1:02:29] coming to faithfully and they kept
[1:02:31] praying and God delivered her from that
[1:02:33] lifestyle and now she's free aim ahead
[1:02:35] glory amen
[1:02:37] the Bible said it see it's it's the it's
[1:02:40] the lust of the flesh that you know they
[1:02:42] they lust to do those things but that's
[1:02:45] a perfect example of how even when we
[1:02:47] fall short and backside into sin God is
[1:02:49] merciful God's still reaching out if we
[1:02:52] just come and confess our sins and
[1:02:54] humble ourselves God can heal us amen
[1:02:56] Oh glory amen starting to feel good
[1:02:59] tonight amen oh this morning brother
[1:03:02] Andy I was running around I use yourself
[1:03:05] you know glory so now let's look at the
[1:03:09] kingdom of God for a few minutes is that
[1:03:10] okay let me set my time like just give
[1:03:12] me half an hour let me look at the
[1:03:13] kingdom of God so I started I tried
[1:03:15] about a half hour
[1:03:16] on that and let's do a half hour in the
[1:03:18] kingdom of God now the word kingdom
[1:03:21] means a realm or rule or Dominion so and
[1:03:26] we read the scripture where Jesus said
[1:03:28] the kingdom of God does not come with
[1:03:30] observation you know you're not gonna
[1:03:32] see like that everybody's looking for
[1:03:34] the blood moons today now how these
[1:03:36] things they're looking for all these
[1:03:38] signs but really the kingdom of God
[1:03:40] comes just by the will of God and the
[1:03:45] kingdom of God is the baptism of the
[1:03:47] Holy Ghost praise God because Jesus said
[1:03:51] the kingdom of God is within you so the
[1:03:54] rule of the Holy Spirit the Dominion of
[1:03:57] the Holy Spirit is in your soul that's
[1:03:59] how God starts his kingdom he puts his
[1:04:03] kingdom in you go amen that's how he
[1:04:07] starts a kingdom he puts you in a now
[1:04:09] let me prove it go to Matthew 4:17 Jesus
[1:04:12] the first thing Jesus preaches is repent
[1:04:15] that means leave your sin and come close
[1:04:19] to the kingdom of God because he said
[1:04:21] the kingdom of God is coming Matthew
[1:04:24] 4:17 from that time
[1:04:33] Jesus began to preach and to say repent
[1:04:35] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand at
[1:04:39] hand
[1:04:40] right he was starting to show them it's
[1:04:42] closed the kingdom of heaven is closed
[1:04:44] he said the kingdom of heaven is gonna
[1:04:46] be within you amen
[1:04:47] the Holy Spirit in you glory go to
[1:04:51] Matthew 16 since we're there then Jesus
[1:04:55] says Peter I'm giving you the keys of
[1:04:57] the kingdom Matthew 16 18 and 19
[1:05:06] actually go to 16 17 Matthew 16 17 and
[1:05:10] jesus answered and said to him blessed
[1:05:12] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[1:05:14] blood hath not revealed unto thee but my
[1:05:16] father which is in heaven and I say also
[1:05:19] unto thee that thou art Peter and upon
[1:05:20] this rock I'll build my church and the
[1:05:22] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[1:05:25] it and I will give unto thee the keys of
[1:05:27] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[1:05:29] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[1:05:31] in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt
[1:05:34] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:05:36] can you say Amen he says I'm giving you
[1:05:39] the keys to the kingdom now we've been
[1:05:41] through this before as a church so we're
[1:05:42] not going to go there but there was
[1:05:44] three types of people in God's economy
[1:05:46] in the Bible there was Jews Gentiles and
[1:05:49] Samaritans right Jews were just plain
[1:05:53] Hebrews Gentiles were non Hebrews
[1:05:56] Samaritans were a mixture they were both
[1:05:58] Jew and Gentile so God had three kinds
[1:06:01] and Peter preached the Holy Spirit to
[1:06:04] all three groups and all three groups
[1:06:06] got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:06:09] so Jesus's words he said the kingdom of
[1:06:12] heaven is closed the clean up of heaven
[1:06:13] is at hand repent get ready the Holy
[1:06:16] Ghost is going to come get ready for it
[1:06:17] to come amen and then Peter went and
[1:06:20] preached the Holy Ghost to all three
[1:06:22] groups and the Holy Ghost the kingdom of
[1:06:24] God started coming into people's lives
[1:06:26] and then they started obeying the
[1:06:29] Dominion of the Holy Spirit in other
[1:06:32] words they started letting the Holy
[1:06:33] Spirit rule their lives amen that's it
[1:06:36] right there that's the kingdom of God
[1:06:38] within you is the Holy Spirit in you
[1:06:41] ruling your life praise God and let's
[1:06:44] prove it again revelation 1
[1:06:47] so see when you get born again and the
[1:06:52] kingdom of God is within you now you
[1:06:53] have a spirit since you're part of a
[1:06:55] kingdom now you have a spiritual office
[1:06:58] you're a king and a priest unto God all
[1:07:03] right
[1:07:06] let's read revelation 1:5 five and six
[1:07:10] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:07:12] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:07:14] to the Dead and the Prince of the kings
[1:07:15] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:07:17] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:07:20] my that's a beautiful scripture right
[1:07:22] there he washed us he took his own blood
[1:07:25] right picture you mothers and I do it
[1:07:27] sometimes too I'll take that detergent
[1:07:29] I'll put it in the laundry well Jesus
[1:07:31] was putting his own blood in there and
[1:07:33] we were the ones in the washing machine
[1:07:35] praise God
[1:07:36] right he washed us from our sins in his
[1:07:40] own blood
[1:07:41] just to give you a little picture in
[1:07:43] your mind verse 6 and hath made us kings
[1:07:46] and priests unto God and his father to
[1:07:49] him be glory and Dominion for ever and
[1:07:51] ever amen
[1:07:52] see when the kingdom of God is in you
[1:07:54] now you're a king not physically right
[1:07:59] like we all wish we could be the
[1:08:01] presidents but we're not going to be but
[1:08:04] we're actually greater than that because
[1:08:06] we're a king in the kingdom of God and
[1:08:09] were priests in the kingdom of God as
[1:08:13] well and priests you know king is
[1:08:17] someone who rules like King David he
[1:08:18] ruled all of Israel and he brought all
[1:08:21] the nations and Solomon they brought all
[1:08:23] the nations in subjection and they had
[1:08:24] to pay their taxes to him you know and
[1:08:26] all these things they ruled now the
[1:08:28] priest though is the one who interceded
[1:08:30] the priest went in the holiest of Holies
[1:08:32] so all the people could be forgiven and
[1:08:35] that's what we're supposed to do in
[1:08:36] prayer we're supposed to go in the
[1:08:38] prints of God and take people's needs in
[1:08:41] the presence of God so we're kings we
[1:08:43] rule over sin praise God
[1:08:45] amen we drive out any invaders in of sin
[1:08:48] into in our lives praise God we drive
[1:08:51] them out because we're the king and
[1:08:52] we're priests we intercede through
[1:08:54] prayer so that God will hear our prayers
[1:08:57] and minister and help people praise God
[1:08:59] amen
[1:09:01] so this is the kingdom of God is the
[1:09:04] Holy Ghost inside of us praise God Amen
[1:09:07] boy I was real happy I'm not gonna be
[1:09:09] able get to it but church did you know
[1:09:10] there's 15 parables about the kingdom of
[1:09:12] God Jesus gave 15 parables about the
[1:09:16] kingdom of God seven of them are in
[1:09:19] Matthew chapter 13 I wrote a chapter on
[1:09:21] that for my next book seven of them are
[1:09:24] in Matthew 13
[1:09:25] but there's eight more a total of
[1:09:26] fifteen parables about the kingdom of
[1:09:29] heaven and so maybe in the next few
[1:09:32] weeks we'll look at those Lord willing
[1:09:33] you know now that I'm done with the
[1:09:35] numerology series the biblical
[1:09:36] numerology now maybe I ignore the
[1:09:37] kingdom of heaven we'll see now I want
[1:09:41] you to see this to go to Matthew 12:34 I
[1:09:46] want you to see this to show you the
[1:09:48] kingdom of heaven they were preaching
[1:09:50] Jesus was preaching about the Holy Ghost
[1:09:52] it's going to come it's going to come he
[1:10:07] said o generation of vipers I'm sorry no
[1:10:09] I'm sorry's mark 12 I'm sorry honey I
[1:10:11] say it wrong it's mark 12 34 my fault
[1:10:14] sweetie
[1:10:15] mark 12 34 yeah oh yeah this is a good
[1:10:20] Scripture now let me yeah let me turn
[1:10:24] there real quick I just got a real quick
[1:10:25] thought I want to throw out here bear
[1:10:34] with me here
[1:10:34] mark 12 34 now let's read that it says
[1:10:39] and Jesus saw that he answered
[1:10:41] discreetly and he said him thou art not
[1:10:43] far from the kingdom of God now what was
[1:10:47] the question he said what's the greatest
[1:10:48] commandment in the verses above right
[1:10:50] and and Jesus said the first commandment
[1:10:55] here o Israel the Lord our God is one
[1:10:56] Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:10:58] God with all thy heart and verse 30 with
[1:11:00] all thy soul and with all thy mind and I
[1:11:03] like this one and with all thy strength
[1:11:06] see this is the first commandment and
[1:11:10] this
[1:11:11] second is like namely thou shalt love
[1:11:14] the Lord thy God I'm sorry love thy
[1:11:15] neighbor as thyself
[1:11:16] there's none other commandment greater
[1:11:18] than the praise the Lord and then a
[1:11:23] verse 33 the man says you're right to
[1:11:25] love God is greater than all the animal
[1:11:27] sacrifices we could ever give and Jesus
[1:11:29] said you're not far from the kingdom of
[1:11:30] God when you serve God based upon your
[1:11:33] love you're not far from the kingdom of
[1:11:35] God amen
[1:11:36] see no one's forcing me to come up here
[1:11:38] I'm not coming to preach or serve God oh
[1:11:39] I don't go to school and try to witness
[1:11:41] and you know I don't go to the place and
[1:11:43] try to witness based upon fear I go
[1:11:45] there and love amen because I love the
[1:11:48] Lord amen and Jesus says you're not far
[1:11:51] now I want you to go back up to verse 30
[1:11:54] though mark 12:30 with all your strength
[1:11:57] see we put so much energy and strength
[1:12:00] into other things but we've got to come
[1:12:02] to a place to our lives and as those of
[1:12:05] us who work we handle or go to school
[1:12:07] you understand you only have so much
[1:12:09] strength in your day right some days the
[1:12:11] kids at school they paw almost all the
[1:12:13] virtue out of me I hardly have any
[1:12:14] strength at all left when I get home but
[1:12:18] the Bible says we're to love God with
[1:12:19] all of our strength praise God so we've
[1:12:22] got to find the balance to be able to
[1:12:23] give strength to our jobs but you know
[1:12:26] have strength to do the will of God as
[1:12:28] well because the Bible said love God
[1:12:31] with all your strength your human
[1:12:34] strength now I want to look at the next
[1:12:37] one go to Luke 16:16 it's going to take
[1:12:43] Church as we know God wants us to give
[1:12:47] all of our strength God wants to see us
[1:12:49] to put our best strength our best effort
[1:12:51] into the things of God right Luke 16:16
[1:12:59] the law in the
[1:13:00] prophets were until John since that time
[1:13:02] the kingdom of God is preached and every
[1:13:04] man presses into it see how do you get
[1:13:09] in the kingdom of God it's through
[1:13:10] effort right it's through dying out
[1:13:15] praise the Lord and he says you're not
[1:13:18] far from the kingdom when you understand
[1:13:20] I've got to put all my human effort into
[1:13:22] the things of God a man because Jesus
[1:13:26] says you've got to press into it so
[1:13:29] you've got to push into it you've got to
[1:13:30] press past all the distractions and
[1:13:32] you've got to really get in the presence
[1:13:34] of God just like a priest right you got
[1:13:35] to go past the outer court the inner
[1:13:37] court and the Holy of Holies
[1:13:39] you've got to press into the presence of
[1:13:41] God that's beautiful now looking now
[1:13:47] let's do another one acts 1:14 acts 1:14
[1:13:55] look how the first group press in the
[1:13:58] kingdom of God and that will give you an
[1:13:59] idea how we're gonna press this into it
[1:14:01] or if you haven't pressed into it how
[1:14:02] you can press into it Luke 1 I'm sorry
[1:14:06] acts 1:14 so this is after Jesus left
[1:14:11] them and the angel said go wait in
[1:14:14] Jerusalem until you get the Holy Ghost
[1:14:16] and the Bible said and they all
[1:14:18] continued with one Accord in prayer and
[1:14:20] supplication with the women and Mary the
[1:14:23] mother of Jesus and with his brother
[1:14:25] amen and that beautiful how did they
[1:14:28] press into it they said we're gonna take
[1:14:30] a 10 day vacation and we're just gonna
[1:14:32] pray and get in the Spirit of God or
[1:14:35] getting the pleasing to God and then the
[1:14:37] Spirit of God fell amen and who was the
[1:14:40] man that pre ship Peter was the man
[1:14:42] because he had the keys to the kingdom
[1:14:43] praise God amen glory I hope everybody
[1:14:48] can see this this is the kingdom of God
[1:14:51] the Holy Ghost inside of individuals
[1:14:54] praise the Lord
[1:14:56] now I just feel kind of moved here kind
[1:15:01] of a different thought yeah let me show
[1:15:06] two examples here let's go to Acts
[1:15:07] chapter eight its to two examples now we
[1:15:17] had we've had people you know not in our
[1:15:23] church but we had people like a Bible
[1:15:25] club we've had guest preachers come in
[1:15:26] and they'll tell the kids you know I
[1:15:29] appreciate them coming to speak but we
[1:15:31] had guest preachers I would tell the
[1:15:32] kids like that they say you've got the
[1:15:34] Holy Ghost and you've got the power of
[1:15:36] God and I'm thinking oh man these kids
[1:15:38] they love God but they're not filled
[1:15:39] with the Holy Ghost because if you're
[1:15:41] filled with the Holy Ghost you've got
[1:15:42] power to live a godly life right now I'm
[1:15:45] glad they want to serve God but the
[1:15:47] point I'm trying to make is that when
[1:15:49] you when you're really a part of the
[1:15:50] kingdom of God God lives inside of you
[1:15:52] praise God and you've got power to live
[1:15:55] the Christian life whereas I see these
[1:15:57] and I've seen many of them I love the
[1:15:59] sweet kids but there they get baptized
[1:16:01] but then they go back out and they play
[1:16:02] video games and they get addicted to you
[1:16:04] know movies and I hear them cussed later
[1:16:06] on as I get older I've seen them get
[1:16:08] baptized and then get older and their
[1:16:09] custom and swearing and fighting at
[1:16:11] recess and yeah that's not the Christian
[1:16:15] life they've got to start in
[1:16:17] Christianity but they got to get born
[1:16:18] again and this proves it just cuz I want
[1:16:21] to just show it here in Acts chapter
[1:16:23] eight so I want to
[1:16:30] go to acts 8 verse 12 so Philip went and
[1:16:36] preached in Samaria and he started
[1:16:38] baptizing people but they weren't filled
[1:16:40] with the Holy Ghost yet
[1:16:41] right in other words they were there
[1:16:44] making they were close to the kingdom of
[1:16:46] God but the kingdom of God was not in
[1:16:48] them yet but when they believed Philip
[1:16:50] preaching the things concerning the
[1:16:52] kingdom of God in the name of Jesus
[1:16:53] Christ they were baptized both men and
[1:16:55] women then Simon himself believed also
[1:16:58] and when he was baptized he continued
[1:16:59] with Philip and wondered beholding the
[1:17:02] miracles and signs which were done now
[1:17:04] when the Apostles which were Jerusalem
[1:17:05] heard that the Samaria had received the
[1:17:08] Word of God they sent unto them Peter
[1:17:09] and John who when they were come down
[1:17:11] prayed for them that they might receive
[1:17:13] the Holy Ghost so see getting saved and
[1:17:17] baptized is just the beginning you've
[1:17:19] got to keep serving God until you
[1:17:21] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:17:23] now verse 16 it says it's so plainly
[1:17:27] right here and this is another false
[1:17:29] doctrine that's getting got into a lot
[1:17:30] of churches you know they'll have
[1:17:32] they'll have a baptism day people get
[1:17:34] baptized but the people aren't baptized
[1:17:36] with the Holy Ghost the they got to get
[1:17:39] filled with the Holy Ghost then they'll
[1:17:40] see the works of God and the miracles of
[1:17:43] God and the power of God and the life of
[1:17:45] God in their lives they met it see for
[1:17:48] as yet he was fallen upon none of them
[1:17:50] only they were baptized in the name of
[1:17:54] the Lord Jesus so see a lot of people
[1:17:57] today that's good it's good to get
[1:17:58] baptized but I know I can look at my
[1:18:00] life and when I got baptized I still
[1:18:02] struggle with this this and that
[1:18:03] but years later I got the Holy Ghost I
[1:18:05] didn't struggle with those things
[1:18:06] anymore I had power and after that I saw
[1:18:08] God do miracles in my life cast out
[1:18:11] demons you know God's done different
[1:18:12] miracles in my life I've seen that but I
[1:18:15] wasn't born again when I got baptized I
[1:18:18] had to keep going and then get the
[1:18:20] kingdom of God inside of me praise God
[1:18:21] glory that's right so that's one example
[1:18:25] oh yes let's keep reading verse 17 then
[1:18:29] lay their hands on them and they
[1:18:30] received the Holy Ghost so a bunch of
[1:18:34] people were baptized but they hadn't yet
[1:18:36] received the Holy Ghost and then they
[1:18:39] prayed they kept praying the later hands
[1:18:40] on them then the Holy Ghost came down
[1:18:42] now the kingdom of God's in
[1:18:43] amen that's right church that's right
[1:18:47] beautiful so we can see some people can
[1:18:54] be close to the kingdom of God but not
[1:18:57] be or not have the kingdom of God in
[1:18:59] them yet because the kingdom of God is
[1:19:01] within you it's God dwelling in you
[1:19:04] praise God
[1:19:06] all right no let me show this I want to
[1:19:13] I want to show this too so let's go a
[1:19:16] couple more scriptures did you know
[1:19:19] there's two kingdoms there's a kingdom
[1:19:23] of the Sun Jesus and then there's the
[1:19:25] kingdom of the Father how many knew that
[1:19:27] there's two kingdoms right now is the
[1:19:29] kingdom of Jesus right now but after all
[1:19:33] the Judgment Day and after all the
[1:19:34] sinners and Satan and all the demons are
[1:19:36] cast a lake of fire after that it
[1:19:38] becomes the kingdom of the Father it all
[1:19:40] goes back to Daddy amen
[1:19:43] let's prove it cautions 1:13 so see this
[1:19:50] is the kingdom of Jesus now this is the
[1:19:54] kingdom Jesus kingdom is here now in the
[1:19:57] hearts of believers all right who have
[1:20:01] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:20:03] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[1:20:05] of his dear son
[1:20:07] can you say Amen see when you get born
[1:20:10] again Paul says we are he hath already
[1:20:13] done it he hath translated us into the
[1:20:16] kingdom of his dear son which means
[1:20:17] we're kings and priests right now we're
[1:20:20] to rule over sin were to intercede for
[1:20:22] others and were to do it with God's
[1:20:25] power praise God but there's gonna come
[1:20:28] a time after everything's been put down
[1:20:32] first Corinthians 15 24 where it'll go
[1:20:36] back to being the kingdom of the Father
[1:20:48] so see before before there was even a
[1:20:51] world it was the kingdom of the Father
[1:20:52] right and then he created his son of
[1:20:55] course to help to manifest his love to
[1:20:58] us to be a redeemer and then when all of
[1:21:00] a sin is done away with and and all
[1:21:02] that's been forgotten every tears and
[1:21:04] wiped away from our eyes amen when all
[1:21:06] that's done away with it goes back to
[1:21:08] what it was in the beginning the kingdom
[1:21:10] of his father hey man the kingdom of God
[1:21:12] the Father
[1:21:13] first Corinthians 15:20 for then come at
[1:21:18] the end when he shall have delivered up
[1:21:20] the kingdom of God even the father when
[1:21:23] he shall put down all rule and all
[1:21:26] authority and power for he must reign
[1:21:29] speaking of Christ Christ must reign the
[1:21:31] kingdom of the son here it says I'm
[1:21:36] sorry I lost my spot yeah so he hath put
[1:21:38] all enemies under his feet the last
[1:21:40] enemy that shall be destroyed is death
[1:21:42] amen glory so actually the first one
[1:21:46] that gets cast in the fire is the
[1:21:47] Antichrist he's the first one that GAD
[1:21:49] he just gets straight thrown in the fire
[1:21:50] and then you have the demons and then
[1:21:53] the day of judgment then Satan is cast
[1:21:56] in there and the last one that's in
[1:21:58] there is death the spirit of death death
[1:22:00] is cast in lake of fire and then Jesus
[1:22:03] delivers it back to his father praise
[1:22:05] God which we know the father's invisible
[1:22:07] praise the Lord
[1:22:08] in other words it goes back to being
[1:22:10] it's all about God the father's all
[1:22:12] about the Holy Spirit and that's what
[1:22:15] the Bible says so right now we're in the
[1:22:17] kingdom of his dear son but one day the
[1:22:20] kingdom will go back to the Father
[1:22:21] praise God amen
[1:22:26] I got so much on here I'm just trying to
[1:22:28] see Lord help me with these last few
[1:22:31] thousand got about ten minutes here let
[1:22:32] me uh let me bring out the right
[1:22:35] thoughts here let me let's go this you
[1:22:40] like this one Luke 22 28 based upon our
[1:22:44] obedience here will be appointed a
[1:22:48] portion of the kingdom during the
[1:22:51] thousand-year millennium so Luke 22 28
[1:23:03] because that's what Jesus tells his
[1:23:06] disciples he says because you've
[1:23:09] continued with me I will appoint to you
[1:23:12] a kingdom in other words a portion of
[1:23:14] that kingdom Luke 22 28 ye are they
[1:23:24] which have continued with me in my
[1:23:26] temptations that's what we got to do
[1:23:29] Church we just got to stay with the word
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:31] just stay in the Bible just stay with
[1:23:33] the truth just stay with God just
[1:23:34] continue with the Lord amen
[1:23:36] no matter what comes or goes you just
[1:23:39] stay with the Lord verse 29 and I
[1:23:41] appoint unto you a kingdom my father
[1:23:46] hath appointed unto me amen so see that
[1:23:48] this is Jesus kingdom right now the
[1:23:50] kingdom of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:23:53] father appointed Jesus to have this
[1:23:55] kingdom of the Holy Spirit ruling in the
[1:23:58] lives of people but he says once this is
[1:24:01] all done he tells his twelve disciples
[1:24:03] I'm gonna appoint you a kingdom verse 30
[1:24:07] that ye may eat and drink at my table in
[1:24:10] my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging
[1:24:14] the 12 tribes of Israel
[1:24:16] hallelujah praise God amen if we can let
[1:24:19] the kingdom of God rule our lives now
[1:24:22] then Jesus says I'll make you a ruler in
[1:24:25] the next world the next kingdom praise
[1:24:27] God hallelujah now think that that
[1:24:31] brings the scripture to mind here where
[1:24:33] Jesus said you'll rule 10 cities so let
[1:24:35] me find that real quick I didn't have my
[1:24:37] notes but let me pull that up here okay
[1:24:41] it's Luke 19 17 okay we're really close
[1:24:44] Luke 19 17
[1:24:55] now this is a parable of Jesus it's
[1:25:00] that's a parallel passage to the parable
[1:25:03] of the talents in Matthew 25 but it's in
[1:25:05] it's in Luke 19 it's a very similar
[1:25:08] story and Jesus is coming back to ask
[1:25:10] them what did you do with the gifts that
[1:25:12] I gave you myrrh 17 and he sending them
[1:25:15] well now a good servant because thou has
[1:25:16] been faithful very little have now
[1:25:18] authority over ten cities geez the Bible
[1:25:22] said Jesus gave him one pound I don't
[1:25:24] know how much money that is it's
[1:25:25] probably in the thousands because the
[1:25:28] five taels remember the five taels this
[1:25:29] was 800 thousand dollars today remember
[1:25:32] that we preach that while ago we did
[1:25:33] some research on that so this is one
[1:25:35] pound he said if you're faithful with
[1:25:37] one pound I'll make you ruler over ten
[1:25:40] cities praise God
[1:25:42] so see we must be faithful with a very
[1:25:45] little I just got a very little church I
[1:25:47] got to be faithful of but if I can be
[1:25:49] faithful over this church then God said
[1:25:53] he would give us rewards later that's
[1:25:55] not why we do it but the fact is we're
[1:25:58] in a kingdom now and we've got to rule
[1:26:00] over this kingdom well right now he
[1:26:03] wants us to spread the kingdom of God
[1:26:05] the kingdom of heaven he wants us to
[1:26:07] spread it in the lives of believers
[1:26:09] right now praise God does that help
[1:26:12] everybody's that helped by God's grace
[1:26:14] okay I hope so
[1:26:18] praise the Lord let me find the last one
[1:26:20] yeah I got a couple minutes here let me
[1:26:22] find the last few scriptures here praise
[1:26:25] God
[1:26:27] now
[1:26:29] Aaron I talked about this recently but
[1:26:31] brother we were talking it seems like
[1:26:33] the kingdom of God and the kingdom of
[1:26:35] heaven is the same thing so maybe we can
[1:26:36] end with that we talked about how they
[1:26:38] could be different let me show you why I
[1:26:40] think it may be the same because we've
[1:26:43] already read the scripture about Jesus
[1:26:45] preach the kingdom of heaven he said the
[1:26:48] kingdom of God is within you now go to
[1:26:50] Matthew 25 1 Matthew 25 1 it seems like
[1:26:55] in all the parables Jesus calls those
[1:26:57] the kingdom of heaven but it seems like
[1:27:00] in all the times where he's just talking
[1:27:01] about the Holy Spirit he's talking about
[1:27:04] the kingdom of God but we know they're
[1:27:05] all the same thing praise God
[1:27:07] so that's this was this was fresh to me
[1:27:10] brother this is fresh to me and remember
[1:27:15] Peter was given the keys to heaven
[1:27:17] he's the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 16
[1:27:20] we just read that so it seems like
[1:27:22] they're the same now I could be wrong on
[1:27:23] that but I was as I was studying this
[1:27:25] thought came to me yesterday I thought
[1:27:27] well let's just prove it by the
[1:27:28] scripture Matthew 25 1 then shall the
[1:27:33] Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten
[1:27:34] virgins which took their lamps and went
[1:27:37] forth to meet the bridegroom now we all
[1:27:39] know this right this parable right there
[1:27:42] was five versions that were wise five
[1:27:44] were foolish the five that were wise had
[1:27:48] the oil and oil symbolizes the Holy
[1:27:50] Ghost right and they took their oil the
[1:27:54] Holy Ghost and they went out to the
[1:27:55] wedding of the son which was Jesus but
[1:27:58] there was five that were version they
[1:28:00] were still appear to God but they didn't
[1:28:02] have the oil so they went to buy oil but
[1:28:05] in the time they went to buy the the
[1:28:08] wedding procession went in the groom's
[1:28:10] bridegroom's home they locked the door
[1:28:12] and when the foolish virgin comes they
[1:28:14] let us in Jesus says I can't let you in
[1:28:16] you were supposed to have the oil ready
[1:28:18] to go so in other words if you want to
[1:28:21] go in the rapture if you want to go to
[1:28:23] the wedding you got to have the Holy
[1:28:24] Ghost now amen praise God you got to get
[1:28:27] it now and not later you got to get it
[1:28:29] now hallelujah so see this is a parable
[1:28:32] of the kingdom of heaven so to me
[1:28:35] kingdom of heaven and kingdom of God
[1:28:37] they seem to be the same they seem to be
[1:28:40] synonyms we'd say in school talk
[1:28:43] they seem to be the same thing because
[1:28:46] Peter had the keys of the kingdom of
[1:28:49] heaven the Bible says that praise God so
[1:28:55] does that help by God's grace hope that
[1:28:56] helps us to understand that the the
[1:28:59] difference is the kingdom is you have
[1:29:00] earthly kingdoms like the king the
[1:29:03] United States the Kingdom of Saudi
[1:29:05] Arabia the kingdom of North Korea you
[1:29:08] have all these kingdoms natural but
[1:29:10] we're a spiritual Kingdom praise God and
[1:29:13] this is the kingdom of his dear son the
[1:29:16] holy ghost of the kingdom of Jesus
[1:29:17] Christ and that will last until the last
[1:29:20] enemy death is thrown in there and now
[1:29:23] we just caught the kingdom of God amen
[1:29:25] the kingdom of the Father because it all
[1:29:27] goes back to him because it all started
[1:29:29] with him praise God all right let's
[1:29:37] stand to our feet and we'll just do one
[1:29:38] more scripture let's stand here I'll try
[1:29:39] to just do one more yeah let's just do
[1:29:52] one more let's close with this thought
[1:29:56] here on your effort you and I must give
[1:30:00] effort we must press into the kingdom of
[1:30:01] God we must love God with all of our
[1:30:03] strength so let's close this thought
[1:30:07] right here second Thessalonians 1:5 let
[1:30:11] if you can pull that one up there let's
[1:30:12] close with that now they're getting
[1:30:20] secure this Thessalonians they were
[1:30:22] getting persecuted but Paul Paul says
[1:30:25] that's a that's a appearing token that's
[1:30:27] an obvious token of the righteous
[1:30:29] judgment of God that ye may be counted
[1:30:32] worthy of the kingdom of God for which
[1:30:36] also you suffer so the reason I brought
[1:30:39] the scriptures to show you that the
[1:30:41] reason you have to go through your
[1:30:42] trials and the hardships like we talked
[1:30:44] about patience last week right you only
[1:30:45] get patience through trials the reason
[1:30:47] you have to go through that is so you
[1:30:49] can be counted worthy of the kingdom of
[1:30:51] God that you overcame you chose to
[1:30:54] continue with Jesus despite all the
[1:30:56] trouble despite all the criticism like
[1:30:59] today our biggest persecution is not
[1:31:01] physical no one's threatening us to put
[1:31:02] us in jail our biggest criticism or our
[1:31:05] biggest persecution is people speaking
[1:31:06] bad about us talking bad about us right
[1:31:11] avoiding us right just won't even talk
[1:31:15] about God with you any more speaking bad
[1:31:18] putting bad things about you or texting
[1:31:20] about you or you know backbiting you're
[1:31:22] gossiping about you well they anything
[1:31:24] they're better they're I think their
[1:31:25] Holy Roller you know we're not better
[1:31:27] than anybody we're just trying to obey
[1:31:28] the Word of God see that you you go
[1:31:33] through trials so you be counted worthy
[1:31:35] of the kingdom of God praise the Lord so
[1:31:39] let's have our musicians come here let's
[1:31:41] end with that I tried to be more mindful
[1:31:42] the time I didn't want to go too late
[1:31:44] here by the grace of God but was that a
[1:31:46] good start in the kingdom of God I just
[1:31:48] want to lay in some some clear truths
[1:31:50] there's human kingdoms but then there's
[1:31:52] a spiritual Kingdom right now and we're
[1:31:54] ruling over that kingdom praise God by
[1:31:57] the power of God by the power of God
[1:31:59] hallelujah so it's of our heads let's
[1:32:02] think about this and let's think about
[1:32:04] this thought here as we bow our heads
[1:32:06] think about am I am I giving all my
[1:32:09] strength am i pressing into the kingdom
[1:32:11] of God can I give more of myself to the
[1:32:14] kingdom of God and this is just the
[1:32:21] serve as a reminder to us and also
[1:32:25] conviction if we're not giving all to
[1:32:27] the kingdom of God Church then let's
[1:32:28] give all of our strength to the kingdom
[1:32:30] of God remember jesus said you're not
[1:32:33] far from the kingdom when you realize
[1:32:34] it's all about love through love I give
[1:32:38] my strength through love I try to
[1:32:40] witness through love I try to be closer
[1:32:43] to God through love I try to pray for my
[1:32:45] lost loved ones love amen when we
[1:32:49] realize it's love driving our efforts
[1:32:52] then we're not far from the kingdom and
[1:32:54] if you got the love you are in the
[1:32:56] kingdom of God amen let's meditate on
[1:33:00] that just for a moment
