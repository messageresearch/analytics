thankful for Holy Ghost preachers aren't you praise God I just such a blessing I love when I can just sit back there I can take a little break and I can just feed on the word I end up not taking a break because I'm saying amen so much and shouting and dancing and saying let's sing some more songs but I'm so thankful for men of God that God sends in here and we're very thankful for God's Amazing Grace let's remember his family I know he would really appreciate that remember brother Dennis asked let's keep him in prayer before he left let's keep him in prayer um by God's grace now in March we

wow One Day in heaven God is going to open the books of the righteous and God is going to remember all the prayers you prayed Hallelujah and the Bible says that even the memorials of Cornelius the Angels had already seen it in heaven while he was alive so just let me encourage you you know on a natural thing like that I was so humbled I'm like I'm nothing you know like but it feels good when

praise God Amen let's take our Bibles here as you're standing here let's go to Romans chapter nine I'd like to continue on this series here I think this is part 22 we'll go to Romans 9:13 we'll pick up right where we left off last week Hallelujah I hope you've had a new appreciation for the Book of Romans I surely have I've surely enjoyed this just as much as any other books we preach through and especially last week with that Jacob and Esau thought that really blessed me and i' never seen it like that so I thank the Lord for giving us wisdom and uh Grace and understanding Hallelujah gives us confidence in Christ Hallelujah we get a lot of confidence in Christ Romans 9:13 we'll just read 13 and 14 and Lord willing on Sunday we'll have a regular service Lord willing uh I think Lydia Malachi and AAA will'll be out of town uh they got a youth meeting right on Saturday in Lima Ohio so that's right we need to pray for them for travel as well we're not going so Malachi and ly are going to do all the driving all by themselves maybe that's the first or second time that's happened so we really need to pray for them by God's grace gra pray for the parents too don't let me fool you there I'm not trying to fool anybody uh surely need prayer for them but looking forward to that you know they get a a lot of good Fellowship you know we don't get a lot of Fellowship in our church because we're just a small church but God want us to be that way God's given us thus say the Lord on that God wants us small to protect us um and we received that um but let's remember them and then you know we'll finish that abominations Bible study children on Sunday night we started that we'll finish that on Sunday night it's nice to go through those scriptures and I think if not I'm not mistaken there was about 14 or 15 more Abominations that carry over to the New Testament so we see how God's moral law continues into the New Testament by God's grace so Romans 9 13 and 14 if you got it say Amen let's read both 13 and 14 we can read that together let's begin 1 2 3 as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid amen may God add His blessings to rema's word you can be seated praise God hallelujah so we'll try to I like if I can to finish this chapter tonight I don't know if that's possible but I told my wife or my wife and I were talking and she's going to give me a a wave at 45 minutes okay H so we'll see how that goes I just set a 45 minute timer so we'll see how that goes by God's grace and uh just when the holy spirit's here you know like a couple weeks ago I preached two hours and it felt like five minutes you know and every everybody's polling and enjoying the word of God and dancing before church and it's all good dance before after during you Just Dance any time Hallelujah if it's the season of Dance Let's Dance because there's coming seasons of mour likely right can't have seasons of Dancing forever so let's enjoy it while we got it by God's grace so we're in the fifth part here of uh the book of Romans we we began with the introduction then the whole world is guilty before God we moved into justification by faith as a solution for all of our guilt God justifies Us by taking on all of our sin sin on Christ and then we looked in the believer's walk in the Holy Spirit and the final result of the Gospel blessing was uh finished at the end of chapter 8 from the book of Romans then last week we began in Romans 9:1 and now we're looking at this latest section God's promises to Israel but I love how Paul brings in the Gentile position in here as well and if you if you if you want more on Israel remember I wrote a whole chapter on that in my uh 12 New Testament mystery book showing how God called them you know God started the nation through Abraham uh there was no Jew and Gentile at that time right uh and so God created the Jews through Abraham Hallelujah and he was an idolator God called an idolator and formed and taught him the the Living God a prophet uh nonetheless Abraham saw visions and talk to God formed a nation out of him and then God said I married this nation right but then they played the haret on him too many times and they they turned down his Messiah so he blinded them and he took you and I and he makes us his wife hallelujah what a story amen hallelujah he makes us the bride of Christ now will he bring back Israel yes Paul said he cut off the branch of the Holy branch of Israel that he might Graft in the Gentile but there's going to come a time once he's got all the fruits from the Gentile Branch he's going to cut that Branch off he's going to graft Israel back in and then the Bible said when the 144,000 are filled with the Holy Ghost they first fruits unto God see so they're the first fruits they're the fruits that come out of this Branch that's now been grafted back into to the holy tree Hallelujah but Church let's enjoy let's pull on let's pull on the vine while we're connected to Christ amen Hal let's enjoy the blessings of God Amen that's what we live by the Life of Christ Hallelujah that's what you and I live by Hallelujah by the grace of God so there's a whole chapter on that is chapter two of that book there by God's grace brother BR preached course many sermons on Israel you know Daniel 70 weeks and lots of Israel uh in 1953 he preached a whole series on Israel a beautiful series there by the grace of the Lord taught us many Bible truths now um and while I was on that you know I just wanted to share this you know since brother Rod's here and you we got some listeners there and the young people I just want to go over again why we believe brother Brandon was a prophet you know brother Bram fulfilled at least six verses that prophesied about him you know Malachi 45 and 6 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 Matthew 17:11 acts 3:20 and 21 there's five right there I always leave out one more oh Amos 3:7 Hallelujah at least six verses prophesied to the Ministry of brother brandham and then one of the main things he did was reveal the Seven Seals to us and once the Seven Seals were open then all the other Mysteries could be finished Hallelujah because there were there was sealed up it was the book of redemption that was sealed up but now it was open Hallelujah and once that book is open Christ opens it he sends down the Revelation he sends it down in Revelation 10 the open book comes down to earth and God has brother Ram prophesy again and when brother preached those Seven Seals it was the seven thund Thunders uttering their voices because a thunder is a voice of God and after each time brother Ram preached a seal he said that's thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah praise God and that's what that's what the voice of God is it's a thunder Hallelujah and so brother Bram gave us the Seven Seals with thus sayith the Lord and that led to these other Mysteries there's 12 New Testament Mysteries doctrines that are called Mysteries and brother bam gave us the revelations on those that's what I wrote the book on there by God's grace and six of those have thus sayith the Lord so we know the other ones will be right as well well and then brother B gave us also He restored eight of Paul's doctrines that the church is lost eight of those were restored with us sayith the Lord so see this emphasis he's got thus sayith the Lord just like Jeremiah had it just like Ezekiel had it right and most preachers today don't have it right even even me I'm not a pastor I'm not a prophet so I don't give thus sayith the Lords right very few people do so the very fact he spoke with thus sayith the Lord so accurately so many times it proves one more proof he's a prophet of God God hallelujah because like like we said before TD Jake don't say thus sayith the Lord Joe OS sure don't say thus sayith the Lord you know all these other men we can name I respect John MacArthur a lot I I respect some of the work John Piper's done but none of them speak with thus sayith the Lord some of them if they're faithful they have their teachings and they have their their calling of God and some of them have been a blessing to me now some of them haven't some of them are really off the word of God but I'm just speaking in general but brother Ram was the only one that spoke with thus sayith the Lord and it had so many vindications Hallelujah and then um I made a video about this too brother raham has at least six thus sayith the Lord prophecies for told about the future six of them are fulfilled I mentioned one last week with the rock and roll that was one of them now there's also 11 more that are to come that I found now that's just in my humble study I'm not a full-time Pastor I wish I could spend eight hours a day studying but I can't I got to go to work and feed my family but that's again it's God's will amen Paul was a Tent Maker amen if he could do it I can do it by God's grace but then I found last just just just few months ago I found this over 110 doctrines that brother Ram restored that the denominations got wrong and we're not slamming the people but we're slamming the devil that creates all those false doctrines it's the devil that makes a denomination said we're only going this far we won't accept anymore that's a devil that does that because the Bible said we cannot limit the Holy One of Israel praise God that's why brother Ram said our Creed book is the Bible amen hallelujah so we're not going to add to the Bible we're not going to take away from the Bible amen all of our Creeds and bylaws right in the word of God hallelujah but I found at least 110 and remember um and remember also brother had so many Supernatural healings testimonies discernments uh the first time he even heard his voice preach I just wept I was a sinner brother Rod I I was I was listening to brother Brandon with headphones on I was playing Nintendo Right video games and I'm chewing tobacco I'm chewing tobacco and all I do is start crying I I said I never I never heard a man preach like this and I turned off the Nintendo and I I said God forgive me I took out my chew I never heard a man and I've lived in church I was raised in Assembly of God Church I thank God for the Assembly of God Church I was raised in they were very sweet people but I never heard a man preach like that because that's a prophet of God hallelujah amen and uh you know you can go on YouTube and you can or whatever you can find so many testimonies we we just read a book with 39 testimonies people that knew brother R personally and each one of them were so impressed ressed by his Godly Christian character and each of them knew he was a prophet of God without even knowing what we know all they did just watch his ministry and they knew this man's a prophet he would answer all their questions before they would even ask them sometimes he would interpret their dreams he would tell them things to come like the one the the one uh woman he said he said uh you're going to meet your W you're going to uh your husband's going to be uh you're going to meet your husband out west and he said make sure you have frozen steaks in your your freezer because that's how you're going to know it's him you're going to cook him a steak with me and it happened a few years later and she totally forgot about it she was just out she went in there she she got the frozen steaks out cooked them and after that you know he was interested in her and then realized later okay brother R saw a vision of it now she said I and she said I always keep frozen steaks as a memorial in my freezer I guess when you want one they're nice to have aren't they but just things like that and it's on I we we've gone through many on tape as well I I met two people that knew brother brandom and brother BR did that to both of them he told them things that come to pass foretold uh foretold their healings foretold answer their questions without them asking the questions a true man of God and of course there was fruit to his Godly life and Ministry now today since 2012 so yes now it's been 12 years Satan has raised up a lot of accusers against brother brandom because all these Saints are dying right and there's less testimonies right but uh just because some people fell away or some people that new brother don't serve God that's not brother bram's fault brother Bram served God and it's just like Jesus he had 71 preachers leave him right so out of the majority of his preachers the majority left him very few stayed the same thing's true with brother Brandon same thing true with with Martin Luther Martin Luther said I hope 10 of 10% of my converts have stayed true to the my message I found that in history last year brother I couldn't believe it he was just hoping he was hoping I can keep 10% of what the Lord has given me just that's how it is in every age right 71 walked away from Jesus 90% walked away from Martin Luther how many walked away from Brother braham's Bible teaching now it's the Bible teaching but how do we know we're true followers because we believe the Bible hallelujah we're staying with the word of God and then in that also in that chapter 13 in that uh book The 12 New Testament Ministries I show five characteristics brother had that was exactly the same as Elijah he prophesied with thus sayith the Lord like Elijah did uh he was against immoral women he condemned the immoral women of the day like Jezebel right brother ramam condemned uh Jackie Kennedy how she cut her hair wore makeup and wore high heels and wore sexy clothes brother Bram condemned that while she was alive brother Marilyn Monroe he condemned all them women all their immorality because he had thus sayith the Lord he is a prophet of God he's a man of the Wilderness uh there's numerous other oh he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children he turned us back he turned our hearts back to the apostolic fathers right cuz some of our fathers didn't serve God but we got a father Hallelujah we got fathers in the faith St Paul and St Peter Hallelujah and God turned us back to those fathers Hallelujah because that's what really matters Hallelujah Paul said you have not many fathers in the faith he said you have thousands of instructors but not many fathers amen so I just thought I'd share that briefly now also in this chapter Romans nine Paul gave us the order of predestination the first order is God has for knowledge of what you'll choose we're going to look at that a little bit more more tonight first he has four knowledge and that's why he could choose you in his mind before the foundation of the world remember we read that last week Ephesians 1:4 once he has his for knowledge then the Bible said Paul said he predestines you and as I said earlier acts 17 says he determines even the places you're going to live remember in and I read this a few weeks ago in Psalm 139 David said you have so many thoughts in me he said I can't even count the number of them think about all the thoughts that went just into the your your the number of hairs on your head right or the all the steps in life you would take the jobs the people you'd meet uh how many breaths you would take in every day right how many times you'd be sick and God would heal you amen all these details about your life God had all this written down and David said I can't even number all the thoughts you have towards me oh my Hallelujah I'm talking about a God who loves you Hallelujah that's why I singing those songs earlier I'm a friend of God hallelujah amen you're a friend of God God loves us hallelujah he predestinated Our Lives lives we couldn't live any other time we had to live now praise God and then after he predestinated you then he called you which means elected you he elected you he called you and then once you heard that calling then he justified you which we all stand Justified here tonight am declared righteous as you would ha as you would like to be the definition is so you and I we want to be 100% righteous not 99 give me 100% I want to be fully righteous and that's what we're that's what we're given justification is the righteousness that you wish to be Hallelujah if I went to a court and someone accused me I don't want to as we're talking about court if someone went to court I wouldn't wouldn't be uh forgiven of of 99 charges if there's a 100 I want to be forgiven of all 100 praise God and that's what Jesus did for us Jesus took all of our charges on him Hallelujah that we have no charges amen and the Bible said and nobody can come around and lay anything to our account praise God because it's God that justifies us hallelujah it's not a man it's not your mom it's not your brother it's not your your pastor or me it's not anybody it's God who declares you righteous am amen hallelujah and then this last step one day one glorious day brother Austin we'll get that last step glorification amen we'll get our glorified bodies Hallelujah a body that can eat and drink and travel faster than a thought like Jesus could walk through walls amen we'll get a body like that that's that final step Hallelujah Paul says that's the finality of adoption hallelujah amen we have the earnest now we have the Holy Ghost in our soul now that's the earnest of of of The Inheritance that's the down payment Hallelujah and because we got the down payment the rest is coming Hallelujah the glorification is coming so we're thankful for that by God's grace now we saw last week God said I love Jacob but Esau have I hated and I I found through studying the scripture that it seems seems like uh it's not that God hated Esau because we see many scriptures God doesn't Delight when Sinners die in fact I found another one I was listening here 2 Peter 3:9 I'm going to try to read that by God's grace second Peter 3:9 I just came to my mind here the Lord is not slack concerning his promise now sometimes we have trouble waiting right but let's remember God's not late amen God's not lazy God's not behind God's right on schedule amen he's not slack now sometimes we're like God where are you at right and we're all guilty of it and then we come to church we get corrected by God's grace or we turn turn on a song or whatever repent however it works but God's not slack as some men count slackness but he's longsuffering to usw see he's longsuffering with you and I with me and you he's very patient with us he suffers long with our mistakes our attitudes and he's not willing that any should perish amen so it's plain God didn't want to see Esau in that condition God didn't want to see judas's scarat like that but the Bible's plain and Peter should know if anybody should know God's longsuffering it's Peter Hallelujah who denied Christ three times after all Jesus had done for him he denied him three C denied him three times as Christ Messiah but he tells us God is longsuffering and God is not willing that any should perish but Jesus tells us the reason they will in John 3 is because they love dark Darkness more than light church I hope you're in a spot where you can look at your life and say I love the word of God way more than anything else Hallelujah I used to love Darkness but I do not love Darkness I Love The Gospel Light hallelujah amen I love the light more than anything else Hallelujah and church I'll say like this you know when brother Ben was preaching on the eyes you know if we're not careful church when we see something evil on our phones or screens or anything's Billboards we got to live so close to God that it shakes us when we see something sinful right we all had that at some point that's called your first love right you heard something you're like oh or you saw but then after a while if we're not careful it doesn't hurt us anymore but Jesus said you can return to your first love how many you believe that you do the first works and that's what I found in my life because that was such a wonderful sermon that was if you guys didn't listen to that one that was powerful and afterwards we dedicated our devices to Jesus so now this is Jesus's Hallelujah I never done that before I was like I was oblivious to that what a what a wonderful thing to do and it's been a a blessing this week Hallelujah now most weeks it is you know but we all struggle at times but just such a such a reminder that sin should shock us uh sh sin uh should should make us upset amen right we've all sighed and cried for Abominations we we've been so sad with sin sometimes but we we got to keep that sacredness we got to keep that hope Hess in our lives Hallelujah we got to find a way to get it back hallelujah amen that was a great reminder I sure appreciate the Holy Spirit uh preaching that that was truly a message from God I believe that like I said you know I think when brother Dennis was here I was afterwards I got back I said we heard from Heaven brother Ben comes we heard from Heaven I hope we hear from Heaven tonight Hallelujah I hope you're hearing from Heaven tonight by God's grace don't leave me out Lord God don't leave me out speak through me your humble servant mine but we saw why God was so against Esau God was merciful to Esau but the history the Jewish history said on that day that he turned down his Birthright he did five evil things he took a virgin that was betro of another man this what the Jews say that's why the Bible called him a fornicator in Hebrews 12 on the same day he killed a person right because he couldn't get any he couldn't get any animals uh now I don't know about these next ones but he said the the Jewish writing said that he denied the resurrection of the Dead uh he despised his birth right he desired his father's death and then he s sought to slay his brother so there's an overlap in there maybe I got my numbers wrong but we can see all that happen on the same day right and this is why God would didn't hate Esau but it it was just hyperbole for meaning God's going to favor Jacob Hallelujah so God Favored Jacob now I was looking again you know this week just thinking about Jacob and Esau again and really Jacob did of course live a more righteous life than Esau you know Esau we know about him uh we know the history of him Church the history is he he moved away he married two uh uh Canaanite women and then he married uh an Israelite women to kind of make his parents uh not so mad at him but the damage was done he grew to be a wealthy man now the wonderful thing is he got peace with his brother at the end of his life he got delivered from that murderous spirit amen right but then his descendants they didn't have that same attitude toward Israel trace it all through Moses and Joshua it was Israel against Israel against all the way down to David and there was prophecy I'm not I can preach a whole sermon on this but there's prophecy after prophecy in Ezekiel and different prophets against Edom that their their land would come to Desolation church do you know to this day this group of people the Esau's are perished off the Earth and there's no more L their language is gone their land is is is uninhabitable right because God said I'm gonna favor Jacob and I'm gonna go against I'm not going to favor Esau why because Esau despised the birthright right he got those evil spirits on him but Jacob loved the birthright amen Jacob Jacob was he was he he was he was a a supplanter at first she would deceive her at first but God was looking past all that mire God was looking down deep into his life amen hallelujah hallelujah those sins of his youth it didn't throw God off brother Austin you and I the sins of our youth it didn't throw God off God knew there was something inside of us hallelujah amen God predestinated our lives amen hallelujah just like Jacob amen and when Jacob's Hard Times came what'd he do he called out to God Amen right when it came down to it he said I want the birthright I want the Messiah to come out of my family that's what he's basically saying I want the Messiah I'll be a religious leader if you don't want to be the religious leader I'll be it and God thought so much of Jacob he said Jacob he said I love you I'm going to name a nation after you I'm GNA give you 12 sons not two I'm glad for two though I I'll take two two is better than none you know or one I'll take whatever God gives us but he said I'm going to give you 12 sons and I'm going to call the entire people after your name Israel Hallelujah I'm going to change your name to show you that you're a changed person hallelujah amen this is why God loved Jacob and Jacob we sing that song Jacob would not be denied he refused to go into to the meeting with his brother in fear so I'll say like this he was willing to pray all night and the church said he wrestled all night with an angel you've got to change me I've got to be like you I've got to be a new man I need God's favor and that's why God loved Jacob hallelujah amen how many wrestled it out with God before amen hallelujah that's that's what God loves God loves a man or a woman like Hannah hallelujah how she wrestled It Out With God all the Mary wrestled Out With God all these Believers wrest out with God I'm not taking no for an answer I got to have God's blessing in my life hallelujah amen and Esau's like I'll sell it away for red red pottage you know I'll sell it away for one meal and then he sought it carefully with tears and God said no it's done because God still knew what Esau would do he'd go marry those women and do all these things all these evil things so see what was Jacob he was a man that loved the Messiah he was a tithe payer too he said Lord whatever you give me I'm giving you a tenth of everything like his granddaddy Abraham Hallelujah he's a friend of God he was desperate to be changed Hallelujah brother Braham said that he said Jacob stayed there until the blessing came when he wrestled with God and God changed his name from deceiver brother man said to a prince with God even the nation was called by his name because he said God Chang me I don't want to deceive people I don't want to hurt anybody anymore or you pray a prayer like that God's going to change your name Hallelujah God's going to bless you God's going to give you Victory Hallelujah if we become desperate with God and we run a walk in integrity and walk in the Holy Spirit you know God's going to bless you Hallelujah I've never seen it fail Hallelujah that's why we see God blessing our our friends now you know Hallelujah because you're you're you're desperate you're living in Integrity Hallelujah loving God serving God the same thing happened to me praise God Amen Hallelujah that's right get sincere with God and God will get down to business with us hallelujah but said even the nation was called by his name yes sir what was it the result was because he got desperate about the thing where did Esa Esau got desperate one time but it wasn't he said it was he saw it carefully with tears but God still denied him now think about that the rest of his life he didn't bother anymore asking God about it right see church that's why we don't stop praying if we just pray one time we're not going to stop if God don't answer we're going to keep praying Jesus said there was going to be a woman that's knocking all the time uh Mr judge sir I'm on your hands brother ra said keep knocking God I'm on your hands God I need you answer my prayer I I believe God here I am I'm still waiting hallelujah it's 2024 I'm still knocking Hallelujah right church but Esau does it one time God looked through that God saw that's not really sincere I want a man like Jacob who loved me and served me and he devote his whole life to me he he teach his children the ways of the Lord hallelujah God God thought so much of him he showed him a ladder up to heaven and that lad was the type of Christ the way to get to heaven he's the way the truth and the life hallelujah oh said you got to get desperate until you get the Assurance he said that's what Jacob did he got in desperation till he got the assurance and church that's how it is for every situation like I told you with Brother Ray giving that testimony I was in desperation God why is this why that and I got in desperation until then God gives me the assurance and now I can live with peace in my heart I can live with joy and happiness because I got desperate and God gave me Assurance Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine amen hallelujah now let's go back to Romans 9 that's my introduction Hallelujah Romans 9:13 as is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid so was God unrighteous did God uh do the wrong thing with Esau no you can you can line up uh Esau's good deeds and Jacob's good deeds and Jacob way outnumbers them Samuel told Saul God's going to give the kingdom to a a Believer more righteous than you better than you see the Bride of Jesus Christ loves Jesus and keeps his commands we're not saved by works but we were created for Works Hallelujah that's what I was made for that's what you were born for you were born to do something a work for God Almighty hallelujah amen that's where people some with this chapter they think well oh Jacob never had any works you haven't read your Bible lately Jacob had a lot of Godly Works amen he's a real man of God took him some years to get over his trials but it takes you to some years to get over your trials too right you're not Mr Goody Two Shoes or Mrs goody two shoes and never sined a day in your life never never did despite the grace of God ever come on verse 15 for he said to Moses I have mercy on whom I have mercy and I have compassion on whom I will have compassion now look God showed compassion on Cain he didn't kill him at the beginning right but yet God had aen and his acces slain God had Kora and his accomp accomplishes slain ananas and saf in each case God was just and fair in what he did none of them none of them uh that were that God took their lives are going to say well God you weren't fair to me no God said I am righteous I had mercy well on whom I had mercy I had compassion on who I had compassion I did that which was right who's going to tell God to his face he judged it wrong you won't even get out of your line lips right talking about Kora Kan and a aan ananis and zra couldn't even utter something like that in the presence of God verse 16 so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy Hallelujah so of course no notice Paul is talking about Jacob so when he's talking about Jacob it's not Israel right it's not the he's talking about the pre the the the beginning of Jacob's life right Jacob's the beginning of his life didn't look very good right and God said it was God showed Mercy to Jacob God showed him Mercy because God knew what Jacob would ultimately desire that's right verse 17 for the scripture sayith unto Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth we all know the Bible said God hardened Pharaoh's heart right but God was righteous in doing it right because as soon as his as soon as Pharaoh's heart gets softened what's he do he turns around and say no even though they're out there I'm gonna go kill him I'm gonna go get I'm gonna go back on my word God knew that God knew he couldn't keep his word right God knew he was a murderer at his heart so God knew he was a vessel Of Dishonor God knew the list of his wrongs was really long Hallelujah and Moses's wrongs were much shorter Hallelujah although he had some wrongs murderer glor glorifying himself kept him out of the promised land right never circumcised his boys the angel was going to kill him but zapor saved him brother R said God gave him a wife that would save his life amen any other brothers feel like your wife has saved your life my wife has physically saved my life a couple times Hallelujah amen it's God it's God's work verse 17 it was God's purpose I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared through all the Earth so whose name was were people afraid of after uh The Exodus was it Pharaoh or Jehovah Jehovah's name was to be feared amen remember when Joshua got there all the nations are like who God is this what what kind of God is this they all h about him and Rahab said I want to part with the I want to serve this God hallelujah cuz Faith comes by hearing see hearing about this this Mighty God it made all the other people in Jericho go against God but it made the real believer Rahab believe in God hallelujah so see any believer today when you hear the judgments of God or you know the tribulation coming if you're a true believer that will humble you and you'll try to gain God's favor through repentance hallelujah amen amen Verse 18 therefore he hath hath he Mercy on whom he have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth so see God didn't have mercy on Esau when he repented because God knew the rest of his life he would just live rich and he really wouldn't desire the things of God again he keep all those wives he should not have get you know God knew that right God had mercy on Jacob because God knew Jacob was a real man remember Jacob even said whoever stole that Idol is a curse on them now look at that what a Believer I don't want any curses in my house what a testimony that is I don't want any curses death penalty on anybody who brings an idol in my house now that's a strict word that's how much you love God then could follow when God said when God said now leave labben leave your father-in-law and your mother-in-law right leave your family and go back to where you were born he left many of us maybe maybe maybe some people not us here but maybe people listening or Beyond they couldn't leave their family if God asked them to because they love their family more than God but Jacob was willing to leave some of family members Hallelujah I'm not talking about a five-minute Drive in a in a air conditioned uh Nissan I'm talking about a long trip in the hot sun suffering but willing to do the will of God because he had a bethl amen hallelujah he's going back to bethl Hallelujah where it'd be in the presence of God at the altar of God at the house of the Lord amen God called him back to the house of the Lord hallelujah bethl means house of the Lord God saw that so God had mercy on him because God knew Jacob's heart was to do what's right and the Bible said God's rich in Mercy so that means Esau just spurned all that richness think about all that Mercy was available but Esau spurned it just for a life living in riches and whatever Pleasures that he had in his life bitterness right fornicator the Bible said bitter but here Jacob gets God's mercy because Jacob had a soft heart amen Church may God help us to always have a tender heart to the things of God church if we're not enjoying song service something's wrong with our hearts if we're not enjoying the preaching of the word something is seriously wrong with our hearts it's time to get down to the altar if you don't enjoy when the guest preachers come something's wrong with your heart and say God soften my heart it's become hard somehow this world my trial my struggles my sins my iniquities it's hard in Me God soften me to your word again bring back a soft tender heart that can receive the things of God I've lost my dance bring back the dance amen hallelujah bring back uh the joy bring back the victory Hallelujah hey man yeah the joy of my salvation Hallelujah now to balance the scripture go to 2 Samuel uh 22:25 this verse has always blessed me so much and I believe it's kept us on the right side of this sovereignty of God issue right because there's some people are on the wrong side and they're on this side you know God's going to save you no matter what you do you can never spurn God's grace that's Calvinism they go way too far right but the Armenians go too far on you know it's all your it's all your works that got you saved the truth is right down the middle right like there's a brother uh used to come to this church good brother lovely brother but I invited him back to church and he said well if I'm predes to go he said if I'm pred to go in the Rapture why do I even got to come to church I said that's a real sad statement friend I said the Bible said choose you this day the Bible said make your calling election sure if you love me keep my commands so see that that that's the danger right they call Le leot and lazy boys that's what we got around the message yeah a lot of you I just want to sit home and be lazy but you came out to the house of God because you love God Amen and and they're showing this other side of sovereignty well if God already did it then there's nothing I can do about it but the Bible said stir yourself up the Bible said be a man Hallelujah for the men now quit you like man amen obey the word of God yes fight the good fight of Faith Hallelujah put the enemy to flight put on the armor of God put it on Amen drive back the enemy drive him out of your life Hallelujah make your calling election sure that's why I love how God showed me these verses so many years ago because God says because David speaks by the Holy Ghost remember David said I speak by the spirit of God hallelujah I was a sweet psalmist unto the unto the Lord so God said I'll have mercy on whom I have mercy but David gives us the other side God will be merciful to those who are merciful right so Paul gives us one side from God's view and then David gives us this other view where God is looking at how ful you've been and if you're if you're kind to God if if you're respectful to God God will respect you right so you see both sides therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness clean cleanness in his sight with the merciful thou will show thyself merciful so people misunderstand Romans nine well God's not giving me mercy because you just don't want to no David gives us the other side you've got a choice in this you can accept God's mercy if you receive it Hallelujah if you want it Esau didn't want it he just cried about it a little bit complained about it and then he went on with his life brother Austin if there was any question in my life if I had the holy ghost or wasn't saved I would stay at this altar until it was finalized in my heart malach I'd say there I wouldn't leave I wouldn't quit I wouldn't move on with life and say wasn't for me I'd give the rest of my life to it Hallelujah that's why I preach that week after week cuz I want to make sure I want to make my calling election sure Hallelujah am so there's no questions about it like Paul said I got to beat my body in the subjection so I'm I'm sure I'm not a Cast Away am because I know you give this flesh an inch it'll take a mile is that right yeah that's right I love these verses you tie them together you got to you got to use Romans 9 and you got to use 2 Samuel 22 there's the human element of it where God is forming you and he's giving your he's giving you your free moral agency in this matter but he already knew what you would choose with the merciful thou will show thyself merciful now church we don't compromise with sin but sometimes we got to be merciful with people till they overcome their sins okay but we don't compromise with sin we want we want we want to treat others like we want to be treated praise God that's the Golden Rule and with the upright thou will show thyself upright so see if you live right God will treat you like you live right with the pure thou W show thyself pure and this this statement about blew me out of the water and with the frow word the perverse the Twisted the Crooked distorted thou will show thyself unsavory which means twisted or to wrestle so with the Twisted you're going to show yourself like you're wrestling against them if somebody's twisted God's going to wrestle with them right so people don't respect God if they're perverse with God they're God's going to show them some trouble in their life they're GNA well if God's wrestling you I mean are you g to even get a move on on God now Jacob won because it was an angel but it wasn't God Amen God would just there's no fight here even really an angel too God let the Ang or God let Jacob beat the angel really the angel would have Whi whooped Jacob but look at this if you're a perverse person God's going to wrestle and fight against you and it's going to look like he's Twisted against you people say I'm fighting again or God's fighting against me he might be but that's not God's fault that's because you were perverse and crooked and frower towards God's word in other words you reap what you sow people look at Romans nine well God didn't show me mercy it's all God just didn't choose me but you got to read 2 Samuel 22 God would show you Mercy if you would show Mercy if you would be pure pure God would show you his Purity church that's where I've seen God the most move in my life when I'm pure before God I've confessed all my sins I've lived as close to God as I can that's when I've seen God move in the greatest ways amen hallelujah when I show myself pure God showed himself pure glory amen hallelujah but the times I'm not living like I should or I'm struggling that's when it seems like God's fighting against me or wrestling with me or things aren't working out like they ought to now I'm not preaching a flowery bed of EAS or a a picnic a Christian picnic I'm talking about the power of God and the favor of God the presence of God I see the presence of God in my life when I'm living as pure as I can to the gospel that's when I see God he shows himself pure to me in other words he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and The Afflicted people thou wil save but thine eyes are upon the Hye that thou mayest bring them down see God does not like pride pride will cause a man to stumble only by pride comes contention if people have many times contention in their lives it's because of their own Pride they won't say sorry I wrote an email to this internet Prophet this week he's blasted me so many times I don't I just ignore him but I saved up all these things 20 24 things he done wrong I saved them all up over the years and I wrote him back that's what I said I said brother you got pride in your life and I listened all these 24 false doctrines he taught and I said that's Pride he's he he said thus sayith the Lord everyone in the message is under judgment and I said that was not God that's a lying Spirit I've met missionaries that have crossed rivers in the Amazon River put their lives on the line they they fought against pythons and boa constrictors I don't know which one's in Amazon which one's in Amazon by boas they have Hazard their lives and their dirt poor they heart I mean their shoes brother Maxwell Lee and this guy's trying to say that guy's under judgment shame on that man that's a lying spirit that man this man this internet man he don't even know what he's talking about he can't pronounce judgment the Bible said I've already pass from judgment to life amen hallelujah there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and no man no man can lay any charge to God's elect amen I said you don't even know one tenth of 1% of message people who are you to cast judgment on them where's the mercy but with the with the forward God will show himself unsavory God is against me God well of course he's against you because you're perverting the word but those of you who are pure God will show himself pure to you hallelujah hallelujah thank God Romans 9:119 thou will say then unto me why does he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will well everybody resists his will that's not a Christian right there's a perfect will of God Paul says and a permissive will of God what did balam do he went the permissive route balam resisted his will right but then God gave him his permissive will and let him get the money but he was killed by Israel right Israel killed them God finds fault because they do resist his will there's a broad road that leads to destruction there's a narrow way that leads to life Hallelujah and all those on the broad Road have done they've resisted his perfect will so God's given them over to God's permissive will he said nay verse 20 nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God see who's going to talk back to God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why has Thou made me thus now they're talking about AI right now might take over the world huh but that better be in the Bible first but I don't believe it because I don't see that in the Bible but see AI might turn on the humans that made it that's what people are are guessing about but that's that's what Paul is saying here that's it how can humans say why have you made me thus hath not the pot power over the clay of the same lump now what's lump it's Just Grains ground down and add water is that right hun is that like a lump of dough Just Grains grounded down and add some water is that what else is in there yeah like a it could be lump of clay too but I'm talking about like a a loaf of bread flower water and what salt yep see and now the Bible says you you in one way you and I are just like a lump flow water and salt Hallelujah and God takes that he makes one now this is of course clay here but you understand the the parallel I'm making here we're a lump we're this creation of God God just mixed us all together right but he makes one to honor and another to dishonor God is the Potter you and I are the clay Hallelujah now the Bible does call our local church a lump that's 1 Corinthians 56 56 remember the Corinthian Church was a lump they had leav in their lump so Church we as a body of Believers we are a lump of dough right and we're either going to we're either going to keep the sin out and be a real solid loaf of bread like that that barley loaf that rolled down for Gideon hallelujah we're going to be this Victorious loaf that conquers all the enemies or we fill with sin let's keep the sin out of the camp like brother Dennis preached to us let's get all the leaven out let's confess all the sin let's keep all that out let's be on fire for Jesus Hallelujah let's be a lump that he's pleased with nothing added to it just flour salt water unleavened now how is Clay formed or how is Clay shaped let me just read this real quick Clay is placed in the center of the wheel head or on a wooden bat that attaches to the wheel head the Potter then uses their hands to shape the clay as it turns on the wheel now my wife is was really good at this was because it's been 20 years I think since she's done this but there's my for minutes that another timer [Laughter] here I better watch that clock tonight but my wife was really good at Pottery she gave uh she made all these Pottery things and gave them to my mother and her mother family and friends the clay needs to be wet and slips under their hands and fingers Potter use a combination of pressure I'm not going to pretend to know but you know something like this you know but it's a combination of pressure and finger and hand position to form the pottery so we need pressure from the hand of the Potter am to change your life amen to change my life amen some do do do you ever you ever grow in your walk with God through the easy times of Life do you ever really grow no Potter's got to put some pressure on you make you pray again make you really study your Bible and call out to get desperate again now there's there there's like times the P takes it off right add some more water they add more water that way not pouring it but somehow there's water added right I didn't get to watch a video I didn't watch the video the wheel relies on the principle of centri cental centrifugal force sorry this is the tendency for material to be thrown outwards from the center of a rotating wheel like a a wheel within the middle of a wheel or remember the word dance means to whirl so this is like the dance of Life Hallelujah we'd say as the Earth spins round and around right our lives just go As the World Turns that wasn't that a soap opera evil soap opera I'm glad I never watch that one but that that's what that's what we see here life just spins in in circles and Cycles glory and it throws out away from the center the Potter uses their hand hands with and against the C centrifugal I can C centrifug I can never say that word forc to shape the clay this process is known as throwing on the wheel ever feel like God's thrown your life around God threw me to this trial right is that right church God put pressure on my life he threw me to this trial I didn't ask for this he threw me into it I'm do to play on words right I just thrown into this I didn't ask for this The Potter Knows what's best church and let me say it like this at least you're in his hands amen hallelujah and the church said thank God you're in the hands of the one who said I can never forget Israel because she's Graven in the palms of my hands hallelujah amen but then the Bible said you were chosen not in His Hands you were chosen in his mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and mine controls the hands brother just brother Jesse just needs a little more pressure here now whatever shape it would be right whatever shape he needs on the top he'll just pinch those and I'll get the right I'll get just the right lid on his life Hallelujah but I've got to add pressure to his life because that's the way he's changed he's not going to change unless I put pressure on him Hallelujah all how many love God see Church you're always I'll say like this until he's done with you you're always in his hands Hallelujah I love that the Bible never said God's going to take me off the potter's wheel he's going to finish the work Hallelujah and that what Philippians 1 says he that began a good work in you will finish that work amen he's going to finish his Pottery work and then he takes you home amen we still got some in our house you know I've seen them at my mother-in-law's house too some of my wife's uh Pottery working you better be you better you better believe I treat those real carefully I don't throw those around you know these are really really special lot of hours went to these these vessels these blessed vessels H these chosen vessels you don't treat it anyway you just don't treat it anyway you got to be respectful this is a work of The Potter's hands aren't you glad he doesn't Throw the Clay Away Now say like this church we ought to thank God tonight if you can say God thank you for putting pressure on me because I see my life being changed hallelujah amen I'm not what I was I'm not what I want to be but thank God I'm not like I used to be hallelujah amen I see the Potter changing my life amen I'm not the same Jesse Smith I was I'm not the same believer I was even just a few months ago God's applied some pressure to my life and I've got a new look Hallelujah I look different to my to my friends my family I feel different praise God it's the perspective that I'm in The Potter's hands Hallelujah now I want to close ah there's so much to get here Lord help me I think I'll just close with uh yeah these two verses here bear with me and I'm going to jump ahead I'm going to come back to this but uh Romans 9:22 now here's a what if from Paul now I believe Paul's right on this but he says what if what if God willing to show his wrath speaking of pharaoh now and Esau and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction let me pause right there what did God have with Pharaoh long suffering all those years Pharaoh was against Israel he made the labor harder all those plagues God didn't God you know God's in his in his Creator's heart it didn't it wasn't something he enjoyed he was being longsuffering he was being merciful time think about that 10 10 times thus sayi the Lord you know with the with the 10 plagues he could have repented at any of those times and God was longsuffering so I want you to see that God is longsuffering with judas's scarat God was longsuffering with Kora they must have been planing that a long time ananas and Safa God somehow was longsuffering with Cain right Esau God was longsuffering but God knew what they would choose so he had to use them as a certain vessel for a certain Destiny I'll say it like that like the destiny of my wife's uh Pottery well it's usually up there some of them are for display but some of them we use actually every day yeah some of them we can some of them you can put in the dishwashers some of them I don't know can they all go in the dishwasher no okay but the ones we use every day they can go right there in the dishwasher and they're whenever you need them they're right there when you need them Hallelujah just like that that's how we want to be for God we want to be a vessel God can use Hallelujah but look at verse 23 here here's the blessing for you and I and that he might make known The Riches of his glory check notice this not just Glory God wants you to know the richness of his glory like one time you might say well I felt the glory of God or Glory but God says there's Riches of that other in other words there's deeper deeper levels of Glory that we can experience hallelujah praise God God's not formed you for Destruction God's not formed you for wrath God has formed you to show you the riches of the glory of God of the holy spirit amen think back in your life how many wonderful times of Glory can you remember great times in the Lord right wonderful services or wonderful experiences with God and yet God says I am I'm rich in that I have I have more Glory than that Hallelujah like you've heard me like the Bible says we the half has never yet been told of the riches of his glory and like that verse says the best is yet to come either of our Lives we either see in our lives or we'll definitely see in the next life without a doubt that half has not yet been told see God is going to make known unto us Church The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy remember Mercy is not getting what you deserve justice is getting what you deserve but Mercy is getting what you don't deserve I don't deserve a wife and children in a church like like we've I've got in my life I don't deserve that but God's been merciful to me Hallelujah I don't deserve a good job and a church a p a pastoring position like I don't deserve it God showed me unmar favor and you you can say the same for your life Hallelujah but notice he had prepared a four unto glory god had this all prepared out he's going to show you Mercy then he's going to show you The Riches of his glory in your Earthly Journey let's stand to our feet Hallelujah and my closing scripture was this one Malachi when every ready could come up at not only does God show longsuffering to Sinners Like Pharaoh he also shows longsuffering to you and I Psalm 8611 teach me thy way oh Lord and I will walk thy truth unite My Heart To Fear your name that's what we want tonight we want a heart that is United to God's fear I Fear God I and I don't want to sin I don't I don't want to fall short of God's glory I want to I want to live right verse 12 I will praise thee oh Lord my God with all my heart I don't want to give God half my heart at church I want to give God all my heart and I will glorify thy name forever more for great is thy mercy toward me a Psalm of David Hallelujah if anybody knew God was longsuffering toward them it was David Hallelujah the Giant Slayer but also the man who was slain by his adulterous heart and slain by his murderous heart if anybody knew about God's mercy being great it was David thou Hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell church and really that's what we're all worthy of the lowest hell for there's none that are righteous know not one all have fallen short of the glory of God and yet God extends Mercy to you and I that we can enjoy the the depths of his glory The Riches of His Glory Hallelujah let's bow our heads for great is thy mercy toward me let's sing Potter's hand if you would that's what I was going to sing earlier because I knew I was going to going to preach on the Potter it's a perfect song I'm so glad he's changing my life Lord you you you have you have my you have you
