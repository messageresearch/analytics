[31:42] elders sitting clothed in white raiment
[31:45] and they had on their heads crowns of
[31:47] gold that's all read verse five one two
[31:49] three and out of the throne proceeded
[31:52] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[31:55] and there were seven lamps of fire
[31:57] burning before the throne which are the
[32:00] seven spirits of God amen let's bow our
[32:03] heads for a word of Prayer if you mean
[32:05] on your hearts making order to God
[32:07] Heavenly Father Lord God we just come
[32:09] back again Lord to hear your word it's
[32:12] our bread Lord God this word that we
[32:15] hear is our bread it's our life it
[32:17] sustains us who strengthens us and lore
[32:20] we love singing about how your love
[32:22] defends us Lord God we're so grateful
[32:24] for your love and your compassion Lord
[32:27] we're just trusting you to provide
[32:28] another healthy meal for us tonight Lord
[32:31] a full-course meal Lord Jesus we ask
[32:33] that you'd speak to us by your word Lord
[32:36] God through these thoughts that you've
[32:38] laid upon my heart and Lord we know
[32:40] you're able Lord God to give us more as
[32:43] the saints pull upon your word and
[32:45] father were just grateful to be here
[32:46] tonight in thy divine service Lord the
[32:49] world could that could be tempting us to
[32:52] do anything else Lord work on our yard
[32:54] or do other things Lord God or try to
[32:56] make more money but father our heart's
[32:58] desire is to be in your house Oh God it
[33:01] is better to be in your house tonight
[33:03] than a thousand other days anywhere else
[33:05] Lord God we know Holy Writ teaches that
[33:08] so father bless us in that presence we
[33:10] love you all of our trust is in you our
[33:13] faith is in you Lord and we ask that you
[33:15] be with us here tonight in a special way
[33:17] to meet every need in Jesus Christ's
[33:19] name the Saint said Amen god bless yours
[33:22] being seated
[33:22] the Lord so we like to look at
[33:31] revelation 4 again here by God's grace I
[33:40] do want to have a few slides here
[33:41] tonight well I got the next proof back
[33:43] from the publisher of our post card and
[33:47] they I must have not stated it right I
[33:50] wanted the pillar fire over here to be
[33:51] outlined but they outline the name so I
[33:54] have to go back and fix that so I must
[33:58] have worded it wrong or something in my
[34:00] haste I must have made a little mistake
[34:02] there so I got that back and we have two
[34:06] quotes there one from Naomi and Adam
[34:08] that gave us 5 stars at the church so
[34:10] we're grateful we know there's a lot
[34:13] more stars here than that because stars
[34:14] are the seed of Abraham praise the Lord
[34:17] so thank you for those quotations and we
[34:20] really appreciate that like I said I got
[34:22] one more I just wanted that pillar fire
[34:23] over here to stand out I thought I wrote
[34:26] it right but I must have made a mistake
[34:27] so forgive me on that well let's look
[34:31] right here to the Word of God here
[34:32] tonight and we're gonna get to that the
[34:34] Prophet teaches this here so let's look
[34:37] at this thought here we'll try to get as
[34:38] far as we can by the grace of the Lord
[34:41] hope you're enjoying the revelation
[34:43] series I know I am this is part 73 of
[34:47] the series so we're grateful for God's
[34:50] grace and patience with us and I'll just
[34:52] listen today again to part three and
[34:54] brother Branham says oh how I just wish
[34:55] I had time to go through this slowly so
[34:57] I guess I get to fulfill his desire to
[35:01] go through these things nice and slow
[35:02] don't have to be in a rush we can just
[35:04] enjoy the word of the Lord amen
[35:06] so we're looking at this is part 3 of
[35:09] Revelation chapter 4 series from 1961
[35:12] and our text was verse 4 and 5 now the
[35:16] first thought brother Ram brings out is
[35:18] this out of the throne proceeded
[35:20] lightnings and this is kind of building
[35:22] on where we looked at last week by the
[35:25] grace of the Lord the prophet said that
[35:28] John saw a throne of judgment not have
[35:31] thrown a mercy because he been caught up
[35:33] at the end of chapter 3 actually
[35:35] beginning of chapter 4
[35:36] and caught up out of the church ages so
[35:40] if you got your Bibles let's go to
[35:41] Exodus 19 maybe we can have our
[35:43] youngsters read that for us tonight our
[35:46] teens or preteens maybe tonight by God's
[35:49] grace but program compares that and he
[35:52] notes a striking similarity to the Mount
[35:57] Sinai when God gave the law to Israel so
[36:01] Moses on Mount Sinai saw thunder
[36:03] lightning which was the same thing John
[36:06] saw here in Revelation chapter 4 the
[36:09] Prophet said it was a judgment seat
[36:10] because anything that touched the
[36:12] mountain died so let's read Exodus 19 16
[36:16] through 25 just so we got a good
[36:18] understanding of that like I said the
[36:21] Prophet said he wished he had more time
[36:22] to go through it slower so we're gonna
[36:25] do that by His grace
[36:30] revelation 19 of course is right before
[36:32] the Ten Commandments in chapter 20 so
[36:35] verse 16 why don't we have a Lydia
[36:38] you're the oldest for the teens here can
[36:41] you read 16 17 18 and 19 alright give
[36:57] you sick 17 18 19
[37:19] amen
[37:20] now we look at the scripture here and
[37:23] God has come down God comes down his
[37:25] fire and that spiritual fire actually
[37:27] produces spiritual smoke the Bible said
[37:30] and it fills and covers with a mountain
[37:33] we'd say now one interesting note here
[37:36] is that this is God gonna bring forth
[37:38] the law correct he's gonna bring law in
[37:40] the next chapter and interesting to know
[37:43] here along with that comes a trumpet
[37:45] right the Bible said twice in our
[37:47] scripture that the voice of the trumpet
[37:50] exceeding loud so here the trumpet is
[37:53] calling them together and we also know
[37:55] the trumpets it relator in revelation I
[37:58] believe is chapter 11 if I'm not
[38:01] mistaken 9 I'm sorry 8 9 10 and 11 I'm
[38:04] sorry 8 9 and 11 the seven trumpets we
[38:07] know our God getting ready to sound for
[38:10] judgments to issue judgments upon the
[38:12] earth so here God is issue getting ready
[38:14] to issue the judgments of the 10
[38:17] commandments but in Revelation when
[38:19] those seven angels sound the seven
[38:21] trumpets that will be destruction that
[38:23] will be during the tribulation so we see
[38:27] that Elijah can you read sir could you
[38:29] read 20 21 22 a men now as a striking
[39:08] God has a lot for his prophet to do he's
[39:10] got a run-up and then God said now go
[39:11] run back down he could have just spoke
[39:14] it from other places but see God's got a
[39:16] special meeting place with his servants
[39:18] praise God he calls them up says go back
[39:20] down tell him not to touch the mountain
[39:23] tell the priests to keep their their
[39:25] distance and if not if they don't
[39:28] respect God's presence God will break
[39:31] forth upon them so God is of course
[39:33] getting ready to show his judgments here
[39:36] and his power and it's interesting here
[39:39] that God speaks by voice back I've never
[39:42] actually heard the voice of God myself
[39:44] but how many have felt the burden of
[39:46] God's word upon your heart that's how I
[39:48] often feel it I church I don't honestly
[39:51] don't even need to hear a voice as long
[39:53] as I can read the Word of God amen
[39:55] as long as I can hear the word cuz
[39:57] blessed is he that heareth the words of
[40:00] this prophecy and keepeth it amen
[40:02] brother man make sure you emphasize
[40:04] is that when he preaches this series it
[40:06] doesn't matter if you're educated or
[40:07] illiterate you just have to be able to
[40:09] hear the voice of God amen
[40:11] hear the word of God so for some people
[40:14] like Moses and prophets they hear the
[40:16] literal voice for others they hear the
[40:18] preaching of God's voice the word of the
[40:20] Lord Amen verse 23 and Moses said to the
[40:24] Lord the people cannot come up to Mount
[40:26] Sinai for thou are just us saying set
[40:28] bounds about the Mount and sanctify it
[40:31] and the Lord said unto Him away get thee
[40:33] down and thou shalt come up now and
[40:36] Aaron with thee let not the priests and
[40:38] people break through to come up unto the
[40:41] Lord lest he break forth upon them so
[40:43] Moses went down to the people and spake
[40:46] unto them now remember what the Bible
[40:48] say the Bible said in Hebrews that the
[40:50] law was a shadow of good things to come
[40:53] so God was foreshadowing here
[40:56] Hermey he was showing the approach unto
[41:00] himself and that's what brother Ram
[41:01] that's brother hams main theme as we go
[41:04] through this sermon as I was listening
[41:05] to it over the last few weeks is the
[41:07] approach unto God God was showing that
[41:10] there was a special kind of approach you
[41:12] had to go through in order to contact
[41:14] God and the Old Testament it was very a
[41:18] very detailed process to go through
[41:20] Hermey and so God had to call Moses up
[41:24] for a special trip speak to his prophet
[41:27] and send him back down amen now program
[41:31] said Moses made things on earth and made
[41:33] the tabernacle like the things that he
[41:35] saw in heaven we know that don't we
[41:37] he said Paul did the same thing he said
[41:40] that Moses made things just like he did
[41:43] and Paul in his vision when he went up
[41:45] into heaven when he taught the great
[41:48] book of Hebrews he must have saw in his
[41:50] vision the same thing that Moses saw
[41:52] because he said that he taught that
[41:54] wonderful book of Hebrews how that
[41:56] Christianity was the anti-type of the
[41:58] Old Testament he was a great teacher
[42:00] Paul was now remember what's he talking
[42:04] about brother branham's talking about
[42:06] this scripture where Paul sang and said
[42:09] Gridley is 12 I came to visions and he
[42:11] said I went up into the third heaven so
[42:15] Paul was caught up in the third heaven
[42:17] but he couldn't
[42:18] talk about it he couldn't write about it
[42:21] but when he wrote the book of Hebrews he
[42:23] could say Moses saw the same things in
[42:27] heaven that he made on earth he caught
[42:30] the vision of heaven and he made that
[42:32] vision a reality on earth amen
[42:34] so brother man picks that up and he says
[42:36] that's exactly what happened here
[42:38] because the Bible said uncoordinated a
[42:41] pattern which the Lord showed Moses so
[42:43] he made the candlestick amen what a
[42:45] great example of Jesus's prayer let it
[42:48] be done on earth as it is in heaven
[42:51] praise God and Moses was faithful like
[42:54] that Moses was a real the Bible said no
[42:56] one was faithful in all God's house like
[42:59] unto Moses Amen if the word said it he
[43:02] was going to do it that ought to be our
[43:03] desire if the word says it church let's
[43:05] do it Amen let's do it let's not talk
[43:08] about it nine things we said some things
[43:10] we can't just bring the past the next
[43:12] day and brother Ram even says there's
[43:14] certain complexes you get he says he
[43:16] says the people say just shake yourself
[43:18] out of it and brother Anderson you can't
[43:20] shake yourself out of it you need to
[43:22] vine intervention so if in your in that
[43:24] case tonight just keep trusting in God
[43:26] keep confessing that God is going to
[43:29] bring me out I am NOT able to bring
[43:31] myself out I've gone to deeper I Baxter
[43:33] too far or I've made too many mistakes
[43:35] but you've got to confess that God is
[43:37] able to bring you out amen you just
[43:40] can't shake yourself out of this habit
[43:41] or shake yourself out of this feeling or
[43:43] shake yourself out of this thought or
[43:45] behavior but God is able to deliver you
[43:48] and I amen
[43:50] we must let the will of Evan come down
[43:53] to earth they meant and that's what I
[43:55] think all of our lives just surround
[43:57] about we just want to do what God wants
[43:59] us to do I don't care how big the church
[44:01] is how small the churches we don't care
[44:04] how big of how much money we have we're
[44:06] not interested in how famous we are we
[44:08] just want to do what Christ wants us to
[44:09] do amen
[44:10] that ought to be our greatest desire of
[44:13] our hearts so program says how Paul was
[44:16] caught up and he saw these things and
[44:19] and he couldn't talk about them but he
[44:23] could confirm that what Moses saw he
[44:26] brought to earth amen
[44:27] now the next sow that's the first
[44:30] thought the second thought that
[44:31] we'll get to this is probably the last
[44:33] thought will get to tonight because
[44:34] brother Ham spends most of the sermon
[44:36] talking about this thought he said and
[44:39] round about the throne so now program
[44:41] stops and he literally says I'll show it
[44:44] to you program literally says the spirit
[44:46] told me to say these things so this is
[44:49] important something we can't rush over
[44:51] and as I'm studying and praying I can't
[44:53] brush over something like this
[44:54] if the Holy Spirit told brother Graham
[44:56] to stop and teach it I think we need it
[44:58] today
[44:59] amen so buttering reads and round about
[45:02] the throne he said watch it's such a
[45:03] beautiful picture here don't miss it the
[45:07] throne he said now there's no use he
[45:11] said I can't I was going to pass this up
[45:13] I just can't do it where's the
[45:14] blackboard did you take it back is it
[45:16] back doc well maybe I can make you see
[45:18] it from here he said look get your
[45:19] presence of paper so I want to say
[45:21] something here I was saying this morning
[45:22] as something came to me so it was that
[45:24] that morning and this is the first day
[45:27] of this is January 1st 1961 that morning
[45:30] before service the Holy Spirit came to
[45:32] brother Branham and said teach this to
[45:34] the people he said I was sitting there
[45:37] something came to me now tell you what I
[45:38] did if you notice I got to draw on the
[45:40] back of here see just drawed it out as
[45:42] the spirit gave it to me draw it out
[45:45] here of what it be but I want to say
[45:48] something right here now you know what
[45:52] we're gonna get to we're gonna get to
[45:53] how man has three courts like the
[45:56] tabernacle of Moses had three courts God
[45:59] gave brother ran that drawing in order
[46:01] that he might share it with us
[46:03] praise the Lord now he said now God when
[46:06] he is enthroned he is then judge is that
[46:11] right when does the judges judge when he
[46:14] comes to the judgment seat of throne now
[46:16] I want you to watch how the Old
[46:17] Testament was made how the courts
[46:20] approaching to his throne was made how
[46:24] the he says and how John saw here we
[46:27] won't get it in this morning all of it
[46:29] but how John saw the same courts of the
[46:31] approach to him what the approach to his
[46:34] courts is now oh I love this so he keeps
[46:37] emphasizing the approach to the throne
[46:39] in the Old Testament there was called
[46:42] the congregation where the people
[46:44] gathered for
[46:45] thing before they come in the
[46:47] congregation to enter in there they had
[46:49] to come under the shed blood outer
[46:51] courts first they came to the waters of
[46:54] separation where the red heifer was
[46:56] killed and made of waters of separation
[46:59] that's the sinner who comes and listens
[47:02] at the word now preach that back in
[47:05] December after I went to I'm sorry in
[47:07] January after I went to North Carolina
[47:10] to preach down there but member before
[47:12] they could even get in here they had to
[47:15] have an experience with God out here
[47:18] before they could ever before the high
[47:20] priest or anyone could have the the very
[47:22] Shekinah glory an experience with God
[47:25] before anybody can have that they had to
[47:27] have an anointing in the outside of the
[47:30] outer courts and that's called the
[47:32] sprinkling of the waters of separation
[47:34] as we preached on about four months ago
[47:37] now notice what the Bible says in the
[47:39] New Testament let us draw near with a
[47:42] true heart in full assurance of faith
[47:45] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[47:49] conscience so before the sprinkling you
[47:52] have an evil conscience I did something
[47:54] wrong I should not it did that I'm
[47:55] guilty I'm a sinner I'm in sin after
[47:59] you're sprinkled you no longer have that
[48:01] conscience so sprinkling is an anointing
[48:07] it's not the filling or the sealing what
[48:09] we see a lot another all ranks as we see
[48:11] people get a little bit of sprinkling on
[48:13] them they get all excited you give them
[48:15] out six months or a year or five years
[48:17] or as we see lately
[48:18] three or four decades and pretty soon
[48:20] they leave the message it's because they
[48:23] never that's all they got at the
[48:25] beginning was a nice sprinkling they
[48:27] didn't feel this evil conscious anymore
[48:29] oh my I've been forgiven oh my but they
[48:31] never really got in to where we're going
[48:34] to go tonight that's true
[48:38] so this is not a filling it's not a
[48:41] sealing like I talked to Denise your
[48:43] brother's all the time because a Bible
[48:44] Club we have different brothers come in
[48:46] probably four or five brothers every
[48:48] year come in and they talk and they
[48:49] always say this you know they always say
[48:50] oh when you're forgiven the Holy
[48:52] Spirit's filling you and every time I in
[48:54] my mind I say no it's not and I've
[48:57] talked that to the kids that's not the
[48:58] fill
[48:59] the Holy Spirit see they know if they've
[49:01] said forgive me Lord I'm sorry they know
[49:04] what the presence of God feels like they
[49:07] know what the the sprinkling feels like
[49:09] in the outer courts and it feels good
[49:12] anybody know if it feels good tonight
[49:14] anybody ever felt forgiven tonight it
[49:17] feels good
[49:18] this evil conscious Oh your gift is your
[49:21] fault you're going to hell that leaves
[49:24] you when you're sprinkled by the blood
[49:26] of Christ amen
[49:27] if you don't feel like that it's time to
[49:29] get sprinkled again is that right
[49:33] because it's an evil conscience people
[49:36] feel evil I've done something evil I
[49:38] must be wrong God must be mad at me it's
[49:41] an evil conscience and so you've got to
[49:43] go in the prints of God by his approach
[49:45] and get sprinkled get anointed so you
[49:48] don't feel that anymore amen
[49:51] and notice this is the first now that we
[49:53] feel this after God's forgiveness
[49:55] through repentance this is the first
[49:59] step in the approach to God the lack of
[50:01] sprinkling explains why people take
[50:03] God's word or his house or spirit so
[50:06] lightly because they're cut off that's
[50:09] what we looked at in January so I think
[50:11] I was reviewing this because I thought
[50:12] some new people might come tonight I was
[50:14] under the impression they would come but
[50:16] apparently they didn't make it but
[50:17] that's okay so I wanted to review this
[50:19] just briefly remember I don't care how
[50:23] long you've been in the church if
[50:25] something died in your tent let's say
[50:27] that tent right there is yours if
[50:28] something died in there you cannot come
[50:30] here and experience any worship until
[50:32] you've been sprinkle with the waters of
[50:34] separation I don't care how long you've
[50:37] been the message if you let something
[50:39] die in your Tet and if you don't get
[50:41] clean you're going to be infected with
[50:44] death right and that's what we type so
[50:47] powerfully by the Holy Spirit speaking
[50:49] you know to different churches Iowa
[50:52] North Carolina it types so perfectly
[50:54] this is why the church gets boring after
[50:56] a while because people let dead things
[50:59] come into their home and they don't get
[51:01] clean when they come to the house of God
[51:03] and God spiritually shuts them out of
[51:05] the church it's exactly right because
[51:09] the Bible said whosoever touches a dead
[51:11] body of any man that's dead
[51:12] and purifies not himself we've got to
[51:15] come to church and get pure but people
[51:18] don't pray don't read their Bible
[51:20] don't listen to brother rhythm so their
[51:22] impure they live in sin they keep
[51:24] sinning and so they don't feel impure
[51:26] instead they have an evil conscience and
[51:30] if they don't purify themselves they
[51:33] defile the tabernacle the Lord not only
[51:36] did they have deadness in their home
[51:38] they make this place dirty too because a
[51:41] little leaven leavens the whole church
[51:43] see I thought I'd be reviewed a little
[51:45] bit tonight maybe it's good though and
[51:46] that so low so now God goes down to the
[51:50] very soul of the man what kind of a
[51:52] nature of a person wouldn't want to be
[51:54] clean and try to approach into God what
[51:56] condition would your soul be in if you
[51:59] know you're dirty and you won't get
[52:02] clean my oh what a responsibility if
[52:05] we're nowhere wrong let's confess it to
[52:07] God and if we sinned against somebody
[52:10] else let's confess it to them because
[52:12] some sins are just against God other
[52:14] sins are against other people see that
[52:19] soul shall be cut off from Israel I
[52:21] don't care how long they've been the
[52:22] church because the water separation was
[52:25] not sprinkled upon him he shall be
[52:26] unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him
[52:30] in other words your unconfessed sin is
[52:32] still upon you remember that woman that
[52:34] Sunday school teacher that brother
[52:36] Branham interviewed she'd spent all of
[52:38] her husband's money her husband worked
[52:40] for Chevy Company remember that she
[52:42] spent all this money at psychiatrists
[52:44] all these things and brother Graham saw
[52:46] the vision of how she had an adultery
[52:48] remember that and brother Branham said
[52:51] you'll never get anywhere with God she
[52:53] never could get anywhere with God until
[52:55] she went and confessed that adultery to
[52:57] her husband nothing was going to heal
[53:00] her nothing was gonna help her not she
[53:02] was never going to get any better until
[53:04] she confessed until she retired herself
[53:09] by confession by repentance and then the
[53:12] sprinkling of the blood could be
[53:14] sprinkled on her amen
[53:15] that's exactly right for years and years
[53:19] going to the side psychiatrist I feel
[53:22] bad for people don't you feel sorry for
[53:23] people that got to go to psychiatrists
[53:25] it
[53:26] you feel awful for them your burden for
[53:28] them and because you and I know they
[53:30] need to do is get in the presence of God
[53:32] and God will show them if they've
[53:35] wronged someone or if someone's wronged
[53:37] them and God will show them you've got
[53:39] to make this right and then all that
[53:41] evil conscience will pass away and the
[53:43] person can rejoice that Christ's blood
[53:45] has forgiven them amen
[53:48] oh my they'll spend thousands of dollars
[53:53] they'll spend all kinds of money to try
[53:57] to get a peace of mind but all you got
[53:59] to do is get on our knees in the
[54:01] presence of Jesus Christ amen now
[54:06] program goes on to tell us the approach
[54:08] that's just a small review there the
[54:10] real approach actually had four steps
[54:12] you had to be clean by the waters of
[54:15] separation before you ever came into the
[54:17] outer court so before you could ever go
[54:20] the brazen altar and have your Lambs
[54:23] neck cut in and hold that lamb and see
[54:26] the priest you know applies hand to the
[54:27] head and transfer your sins to the lamb
[54:29] before you could even enjoy that you had
[54:32] to be forgiven first you had to be made
[54:35] clean you couldn't be contacting dead
[54:38] things and that's why people they can't
[54:41] cry anymore when we sing about Jesus
[54:43] they don't cry anymore the cross doesn't
[54:46] mean anything to them
[54:47] because they still got an evil
[54:48] conscience the cross is just about just
[54:51] the cross we're into deeper things now
[54:53] we want deep things but without the
[54:56] cross it doesn't mean anything amen we
[54:59] have to have the cross first and then
[55:02] we'll go deeper deeper deeper deeper in
[55:04] the love of God amen you got to have
[55:06] both you got deep things you got at the
[55:08] cross but the cross is the way to get
[55:10] there hallelujah if not you're just
[55:12] climbing in another way you're a robber
[55:14] without the wedding garments we said
[55:17] last week trying to get into the
[55:18] mysteries of God without having the
[55:20] Spirit of God first day men and so see
[55:25] that's why the holy place and this in
[55:27] the holy place that's where we have the
[55:28] seven church age is the candlesticks
[55:29] that's why it doesn't mean anything to
[55:31] anybody or the book doesn't mean things
[55:34] to people it doesn't mean anything
[55:36] prayer doesn't mean anything it's that
[55:38] last
[55:39] before the holiest of holies all church
[55:42] prayers got to mean something if we
[55:45] never if we're having a great prayer
[55:46] time hallelujah if not our heart should
[55:48] be grieved that we're not where we need
[55:50] to be in prayer because prayer brings
[55:52] you in to the presence of Christ amen
[55:56] and prayers what changes things amen
[56:00] hallelujah
[56:01] oh these ought to mean more to us all
[56:05] the time but see if there's dead things
[56:09] in our homes dead things in our lives
[56:10] dead things on our phones doesn't mean
[56:12] much anymore
[56:16] he's speaking of the high priest he went
[56:19] there and offered the blood on the mercy
[56:20] seat once a year and while he was in
[56:22] there he was privileged to see that she
[56:23] kind of glory when the pillar of fire
[56:25] the amber light that come down that led
[56:27] the children of Israel he even smoked up
[56:29] the temple so no one could see it the
[56:31] glory Lord fell so that was all smoked
[56:33] up and he came in himself went in behind
[56:35] the veil and settled down on the mercy
[56:36] seat in the holiest of Holies most holy
[56:39] place it's called holy of Holy's and he
[56:41] had to be dressed a certain way walk a
[56:43] certain way anointed a certain way he
[56:46] was a special person to go there how the
[56:48] congregation must have envied him I love
[56:52] that phrase God but when Jesus died the
[56:55] temple veil rent not only a high priests
[56:59] but whosoever will can have that same
[57:03] anointing of the Shekinah glory and walk
[57:05] a holy life holy holy holy unto the Lord
[57:09] and approach in the very presence of God
[57:12] through the blood of Jesus Christ before
[57:15] him now like this this is applying this
[57:18] to our daily life and God help us here
[57:20] tonight as we're praying for sick people
[57:21] tonight we look on brother Graham he
[57:23] makes this holy holy holy so simple this
[57:30] is how we should apply holy holy holy to
[57:32] our lives brother Ram said Lord Jesus
[57:36] here lays a sick man he's my brother
[57:39] he's on the deathbed right now to die
[57:41] I'm approaching you
[57:43] holy holy holy unto the Lord and that
[57:46] beautiful just like Aaron would say holy
[57:48] holy holy unto the Lord he'd swing that
[57:51] back and forth with the incense
[57:53] that's what it's like when we pray Lord
[57:55] I'm coming here right now for sister
[57:56] so-and-so right I got my moves mixed up
[57:59] here I don't have any rhythm as long as
[58:01] I got the rhythm of the heartbeat of
[58:03] Christ that's all that matters they
[58:04] glory but this is the tough simple
[58:07] brother that makes it
[58:08] when you start praying say Oh God my
[58:09] child is sick or Oh God
[58:11] my grandmother's sick or my grandfather
[58:13] or whoever maybe that's us doing holy
[58:16] holy holy unto the Lord and the God says
[58:20] what for he says as a high priest what
[58:22] for in behalf of my brother
[58:24] holy holy holy unto the Lord he said
[58:26] there you are your daily walk your daily
[58:29] talk your daily behavior your heart so
[58:31] an all holy holy unto the Lord no roots
[58:34] of bitterness no nothing else
[58:35] holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy
[58:38] holy unto the Lord as we begin to
[58:40] approach in behalf of our brother
[58:43] how many appreciate that I love the
[58:46] simplicity that brother Graham teaches
[58:47] us to apply the Word of God to our lives
[58:50] when we close our eyes it's as if we're
[58:52] saying holy holy holy we want to come in
[58:56] the presence of God
[58:58] whosoever will may come anointed blood
[59:02] in front of him the blood going before
[59:03] him playing holy holy holy unto the Lord
[59:07] amen praise God
[59:11] now he gets in the next thought here I'm
[59:14] gonna go to the next stop
[59:15] well the RAM preaches that there are
[59:17] three Thrones brother Ram says heaven
[59:22] Christ and now man are three Thrones and
[59:28] I want to just make sure I clear
[59:30] something up here some people you know
[59:33] some people take this thought and they
[59:35] go too far with it so let me just
[59:36] clarify here but Ram says this he says
[59:39] now the first throw was in heaven the
[59:41] judgment seat
[59:42] the second throne was in Christ the
[59:45] third throne is in man now some people
[59:48] preach it they wrong they say okay not
[59:51] now the throne now you know when Jesus
[59:53] on earth they say oh now the throne of
[59:54] heaven wasn't in heaven God wasn't on
[59:57] his throne anymore
[59:57] now it's only in Christ and that's wrong
[59:59] and then now people say well well now
[1:00:02] the Thrones on the heart and so Jesus
[1:00:04] isn't really the throne anymore
[1:00:06] that's not the right thought heaven was
[1:00:10] not bankrupt when Jesus was on earth how
[1:00:12] many understand that Jesus looked up and
[1:00:15] said father glorify thy name and a voice
[1:00:19] from heaven came a man heaven was not
[1:00:23] bankrupt so see people get this doctrine
[1:00:26] all wrong they make heaven bankrupt when
[1:00:27] Jesus on earth and today they make Jesus
[1:00:30] in heaven bankrupt but now we're the
[1:00:31] throne of God like I'm the walking
[1:00:33] literal throne of God you are not I am
[1:00:36] NOT the walking literal throne of God
[1:00:38] but we are carriers of the Word of God
[1:00:41] amen
[1:00:41] it's the word that we're carrying amen
[1:00:44] it's the Holy Spirit that's sealed
[1:00:47] inside of us but I am NOT the literal
[1:00:50] throne of Jesus Christ I'm not that
[1:00:52] Thrones in heaven tonight amen so see
[1:00:55] people take it too far
[1:00:57] jesus said father and then the voice
[1:01:00] came from heaven and said I have both
[1:01:03] glorified it and I will glorify it again
[1:01:06] heaven was not bankrupt when Christ was
[1:01:08] on the earth that's just shows how great
[1:01:10] God is amen the Bible said the fullness
[1:01:13] of the Godhead bodily was in Christ and
[1:01:16] yet there's Christ with all of God and
[1:01:18] there's God in heaven as well not two
[1:01:21] people but God being able to divide
[1:01:22] himself amen God dividing himself
[1:01:25] separating herself and yet he's no
[1:01:27] lesser of God he's still the great
[1:01:29] almighty eternal God hallelujah look
[1:01:33] what Jesus said and these words spake
[1:01:35] Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven
[1:01:37] and said why did he just lift his eyes
[1:01:39] to his heart if he was the only throne
[1:01:40] of God because there was still God on
[1:01:45] the throne in heaven Jesus and lift up
[1:01:49] his eyes heaven said father the hour has
[1:01:51] come glorify thy son and I said also may
[1:01:54] glorify thee Jesus also said and call no
[1:01:58] man your father upon the earth for one
[1:02:00] as your father which is where in heaven
[1:02:03] now remember with Jesus member Moran
[1:02:06] said it's like having a dual personality
[1:02:08] sometimes Jesus's flesh would talk but
[1:02:11] then sometimes God would talk so in this
[1:02:14] case the flesh is talking right but when
[1:02:17] God would talk he would say before
[1:02:19] Abraham was
[1:02:20] I am right one of them said show us the
[1:02:25] father and he says have I been so long
[1:02:26] with you and you don't know me Philip he
[1:02:30] said I my father are one so see
[1:02:33] sometimes God was talking and sometimes
[1:02:35] the flesh of Jesus was talking and
[1:02:37] memories don't ever forget this because
[1:02:39] this really knocks the Trinity out of
[1:02:40] the ballpark jesus said the father is
[1:02:43] greater than I and the church said I
[1:02:46] might knock out some of people study
[1:02:48] theology but that's the Holy Scripture
[1:02:50] the father is the eternal spirit right
[1:02:54] created that body to draw it so of
[1:02:56] course that eternal spirit is greater
[1:02:59] than a flesh body the body of Jesus
[1:03:03] could die God's Spirit could never die
[1:03:05] its eternal life amen and we see that
[1:03:09] knocks out every Trinitarian definition
[1:03:11] because as it says all three persons are
[1:03:13] eternally co-equal and all these things
[1:03:16] like this and see they don't rightly
[1:03:17] divide the word that's a doctrine from
[1:03:20] the pits of hell because it creates
[1:03:22] three gods mass behind oh it's just
[1:03:25] three persons but one one essence Oh
[1:03:28] nonsense we don't need a Creed to
[1:03:31] explain God we've already got the Bible
[1:03:33] to explain God you see so see this
[1:03:37] thought of how the throne that's where
[1:03:39] message people got to be careful well
[1:03:41] when Jesus here there was no throne then
[1:03:43] Jesus was the throne and now I'm the
[1:03:44] throne of God if we're not careful
[1:03:46] that's blasphemy oh I'm the throne of
[1:03:48] god I'm gonna fullness of the Godhead no
[1:03:50] you're not
[1:03:50] proves you're not when you lie right
[1:03:52] through your teeth and say you are you
[1:03:55] understand by God's grace here's what
[1:03:57] we're trying to say brother Branham was
[1:03:59] saying judgment has gotten closer and
[1:04:01] closer as time passed from heaven see we
[1:04:05] used to be they used to be judged from
[1:04:06] heaven and it's got above us now when
[1:04:09] Christ come down now it's God with us
[1:04:11] and now in each and every heart now it's
[1:04:15] God in us in other words the Holy Ghost
[1:04:19] has gotten closer and closer to man and
[1:04:21] aren't you glad if you've got the Holy
[1:04:22] Ghost
[1:04:23] you've got eternal life in you this
[1:04:25] evening amen and yet it's in you but yet
[1:04:28] it's on the throne tonight as well
[1:04:29] hallelujah the Eternal Spirit of God
[1:04:32] can't be
[1:04:34] into just one space he's too great for
[1:04:37] that he can be wherever he wants to be
[1:04:40] here's where he says it romance now
[1:04:42] listen close he says so close then this
[1:04:45] should be kind of glory rays from that
[1:04:47] mercy seat one day and it settled on
[1:04:48] another Tabernacle amen
[1:04:49] this one the father judges no man but
[1:04:52] he's committed all judgment to the son
[1:04:53] God's judgement seat whew
[1:04:58] do you speak against me it will be
[1:04:59] forgiven you speak another another one
[1:05:01] coming another mercy seat speak you
[1:05:04] speak against the son of man how forgive
[1:05:06] you but some nay the Holy Spirit will
[1:05:08] come to dwell in the hearts of the
[1:05:09] people one word against it will never be
[1:05:12] forgiven now look at by the NSSC it
[1:05:16] keeps getting more severe and more
[1:05:19] severe all the time the judgment so the
[1:05:24] Spirit of God is getting closer with all
[1:05:27] these three dispensations of the Godhead
[1:05:29] the Holy Ghost was getting closer and
[1:05:31] closer and closer for judgment will
[1:05:35] prove it to you from the Word of God he
[1:05:40] said because God is continually wearing
[1:05:42] his patients aren't you glad God wears
[1:05:43] his patient out oh my he's wearing it
[1:05:47] out for you and hi he's wearing it out
[1:05:49] for the world
[1:05:50] he waited all these years until nineteen
[1:05:51] I'm sorry till 2000 when I finally gave
[1:05:53] my heart to Lord
[1:05:54] he waited twenty years so I could
[1:05:56] finally give my heart to the Lord he was
[1:05:58] where is patience out on me I'm thankful
[1:06:01] for the patience of God amen
[1:06:03] I'm so glad amen he said now trying to
[1:06:09] get sinners to come to him to be
[1:06:11] reconciled first he was in the heavens
[1:06:13] above and shining through the Stars the
[1:06:15] second he was on earth shining through
[1:06:16] the Shekinah glory next he come and was
[1:06:18] made flesh and dwelt among us so see
[1:06:19] brother man actually lists a fourth one
[1:06:21] there did you catch that he said he was
[1:06:24] in the heavens and the here he's on
[1:06:25] earth with Moses who actually says four
[1:06:28] Thrones so that's another thought where
[1:06:30] you could take four Thrones heaven
[1:06:32] Moses Christ now in the believers it's
[1:06:36] just God giving himself a witness on the
[1:06:39] earth that's what it is remember there
[1:06:41] must be witnesses in heaven he says this
[1:06:44] now he says there he redeemed man by
[1:06:47] blood came into his church in the form
[1:06:49] of the Holy Ghost and speak against that
[1:06:51] it's a finished thing done now you can
[1:06:54] see where the shaking come where the
[1:06:56] time they don't realize people can't
[1:06:57] comprehend what it means praise the Lord
[1:07:01] I hope I didn't lose anybody on that
[1:07:03] what I'm saying is that some people
[1:07:05] preach it in a way where they make you
[1:07:06] the throne of God
[1:07:08] where actually you are not the heavenly
[1:07:10] throne of God you are an extension of
[1:07:13] that throne you're a witness of that
[1:07:15] throne hallelujah right you're you're a
[1:07:18] witness of that hallelujah
[1:07:21] you're an extension of that but you and
[1:07:23] I are not the fullness of the Godhead
[1:07:25] bodily we're not that's absolutely true
[1:07:29] now brother Dave also says it like this
[1:07:32] he says there's a type of judgment at
[1:07:34] all three Thrones how we know this
[1:07:36] there's three there's judgments at all
[1:07:39] these Thrones and we can even throw
[1:07:40] Moses's in there but I didn't throw it
[1:07:41] in there because brother Graham says
[1:07:43] there's three side tried to stay with
[1:07:44] that one so there's a type of judgment
[1:07:47] from heaven there was a type of judgment
[1:07:49] in Christ and then there's a type of
[1:07:51] judgment today see God's throne the
[1:07:54] extensions of God's throne are getting
[1:07:55] closer and closer and closer to us where
[1:07:58] now it's walking right amongst us
[1:08:00] someone can speak the Word of Life if
[1:08:03] they've got the Holy Spirit they can
[1:08:04] speak the word of life and just like
[1:08:06] Jesus said if you speak it on earth he
[1:08:08] said how honor in heaven amen
[1:08:10] if you loose it on earth I loose it in
[1:08:12] heaven if you bind it on earth I'll bind
[1:08:15] it in heaven amen
[1:08:16] see God wants to get closer and closer
[1:08:19] he wants to bring his presence closer
[1:08:21] and closer to the people that's exactly
[1:08:23] right
[1:08:24] so look here's the heavenly throne in
[1:08:26] Samuel this is Hannah's prayer she said
[1:08:29] the adversaries of the Lord shall be
[1:08:30] broken to pieces out of heaven shall the
[1:08:33] Thunder shall he's under upon them the
[1:08:36] Lord shall judge where is he judging
[1:08:38] from out of heaven he thunders from
[1:08:43] heaven and here the judgments come from
[1:08:45] heaven and he shall judge the ends of
[1:08:50] the earth and he shall give strengthen
[1:08:51] to his king and exalt the Horn of his
[1:08:53] anointed her me
[1:08:57] now next missus the one brother random
[1:08:58] quote in the sermon he said the father
[1:09:01] judges no man would have committed all
[1:09:03] judgment unto the son okay so this is
[1:09:08] where we'd say now people can be judged
[1:09:10] based upon how they treat the son their
[1:09:14] right that's exactly right and now
[1:09:18] here's the one that's beautiful
[1:09:20] well we kind of looked at already now
[1:09:22] the Holy Ghost in men so Jesus Jesus was
[1:09:25] showing this throne is going to now kind
[1:09:27] of extend the extensions of this throne
[1:09:29] or we'd say the outposts of this throne
[1:09:32] or the representations of this throne
[1:09:34] are going to reach out because whosoever
[1:09:37] shall speak a word against the Son of
[1:09:38] Man it'll be forgiven him see Jesus was
[1:09:41] speaking of the church ages but unto him
[1:09:44] that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost it
[1:09:47] shall not be forgiven
[1:09:49] how many can say amen to that so see
[1:09:54] Jesus making this this note the
[1:09:56] extension or them the manifestations of
[1:09:59] the throne of heaven is going to come
[1:10:01] closer and closer and closer and you'll
[1:10:03] have a chance to either accept the
[1:10:04] eternal life or reject it if you reject
[1:10:07] it judgment falls upon them that's right
[1:10:12] now this is the most beautiful one well
[1:10:15] not but to me it's very beautiful it's
[1:10:17] acts 13 verse 45 but when the Jews saw
[1:10:21] the multitudes they were filled with
[1:10:23] envy and spake against those things
[1:10:25] which were spoken by Paul contradicting
[1:10:27] and blaspheming they called the Holy
[1:10:30] Spirit of God evil they blaspheme it so
[1:10:34] what does Paul say then Paul and
[1:10:36] Barnabas wax bold and said it was
[1:10:38] necessary that the Word of God should
[1:10:39] have first been spoken to you but seeing
[1:10:42] you put it from you and judge yourselves
[1:10:46] unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn
[1:10:49] to the Gentiles
[1:10:50] so there's Paul Barnabas preaching the
[1:10:53] word they've got a human throne and the
[1:10:56] Holy Spirit is on that throne and the
[1:10:59] Holy Spirit is speaking to them to
[1:11:01] receive the word and they evil speak it
[1:11:03] they blaspheme it they put it from them
[1:11:06] and Paul says right there you've already
[1:11:08] judged yourself
[1:11:11] because it was an extension of the
[1:11:13] throne of God not the very throat of God
[1:11:15] but an extension of the throne of God
[1:11:17] are you with me Church hope that's not
[1:11:20] too deep
[1:11:20] hope it's not too strict a strange or
[1:11:23] anything like that if so let's go back
[1:11:24] and listen to it again
[1:11:25] you know it'll help you but we cannot
[1:11:27] make ourselves God fully God is in us
[1:11:31] but we are not the fullness of the
[1:11:33] Godhead bodily we are a portion of the
[1:11:36] word amen now let me look at this
[1:11:40] thought now see each person has each
[1:11:44] person is a judge each person has a
[1:11:46] throne because the Bible says this the
[1:11:48] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:11:50] the Spirit of God for their foolishness
[1:11:52] unto him neither can he know them
[1:11:53] because they are spiritually discerned
[1:11:55] but he that a spiritual judges all
[1:11:58] things yet he himself is judged of no
[1:12:01] man praise the Lord you like that
[1:12:04] see when you are a spiritual person you
[1:12:08] look at how everything affects you how
[1:12:10] your friends affect you how these phone
[1:12:12] the phones and the tablets and you look
[1:12:14] at how the books you read how does it
[1:12:16] affect you you judge everything you're
[1:12:18] constantly judging why because your
[1:12:21] heart is the throne and Christ is
[1:12:24] sitting on the Holy Spirit I say like
[1:12:26] that I don't wanna get you confused with
[1:12:27] the body
[1:12:27] the Spirit of Christ is sitting on your
[1:12:30] throne judging your life praise God and
[1:12:34] the spiritual man just doesn't judge on
[1:12:36] Wednesday nights he judges on Wednesday
[1:12:39] morning she judges on Sunday morning
[1:12:42] Sunday night Monday morning Monday night
[1:12:45] a spiritual person is judging things all
[1:12:47] the time
[1:12:48] amen constant this is right this is too
[1:12:52] much I've gone too far
[1:12:53] forgive me Lord Lord I'm coming back oh
[1:12:55] I know I need more of this or I gotta
[1:12:57] pray more I got to read more of my word
[1:12:59] I gotta Amen the word more I got to love
[1:13:01] God more I got to see God more see
[1:13:03] you're judging things all the time
[1:13:05] amen this person's a little bit crooked
[1:13:08] here I got to make sure I judge them
[1:13:10] right I gotta make sure I judge and
[1:13:11] watch my I'll watch how much time I
[1:13:13] spend around that person I got to make
[1:13:16] sure this influence doesn't influence me
[1:13:17] the wrong way you're constantly judging
[1:13:20] things you ever get the others your mind
[1:13:22] never get tired of judging things
[1:13:24] sometimes your mind gets tired anybody
[1:13:26] ever feel stressed out this week you
[1:13:29] know you're fighting the only thing
[1:13:31] you're fighting these demon powers no
[1:13:32] I'm not gonna argue oh you're not school
[1:13:34] that's all there's arguments at school I
[1:13:36] get so many shoutouts and argues it I
[1:13:38] got to make so many decisions by the end
[1:13:40] the day sometimes about I can't judge
[1:13:42] anything else
[1:13:42] I always like in judges I need to go
[1:13:46] home but a spiritual person constantly
[1:13:50] judging what's this email is it what
[1:13:52] spirit what spirit is behind this email
[1:13:54] what spirit is behind this sermon it's
[1:13:57] the Holy Spirit then you have to judge
[1:13:59] that and so this is what a spiritual
[1:14:04] person does because they've got a throat
[1:14:06] and someone's on that throne it's
[1:14:08] constantly judging things that are
[1:14:10] approaching that throne amen now look at
[1:14:13] this I know you've maybe heard me preach
[1:14:14] this if you haven't then this is for you
[1:14:16] and this I pray Paul says that your love
[1:14:20] may abound now bow means to increase yet
[1:14:23] more and more in knowledge and in all
[1:14:26] judgment God wants our judgment to
[1:14:29] increase oh I didn't see this five years
[1:14:34] ago but this really hurts my life I'm
[1:14:36] growing in judgment I'm able to move
[1:14:39] past this now or oh I never really
[1:14:43] noticed that little music or I never
[1:14:45] know notice how this this certain
[1:14:47] individual impacts me and they're
[1:14:50] critical so I'm real critical afterwards
[1:14:52] or they got an angry spirit and they
[1:14:54] make me angry right and you grow and say
[1:14:58] ah yes that's right I've got a I got to
[1:15:01] be more judgment I gotta be more careful
[1:15:03] what I do with my words and my thoughts
[1:15:08] we got to be better judges now most
[1:15:10] people like Saab mostly we're like
[1:15:12] Solomon because most people are born
[1:15:13] again I'm talking about in nominal
[1:15:14] churches as they get older they get more
[1:15:17] relaxed on God oh I can allow a little
[1:15:20] bit of more TV in my life oh it's okay
[1:15:22] mercy I've been in the church three
[1:15:24] times this week already I'm so anointed
[1:15:27] I can handle a little bit of dirty jokes
[1:15:29] and that's wrong they can't you can't
[1:15:32] and so most people get relaxed and like
[1:15:36] brother Adam says in the church age
[1:15:37] books they
[1:15:37] find themselves doing things that they
[1:15:40] wouldn't do when they first came in the
[1:15:41] message so instead of growing in
[1:15:45] judgment they actually get dull of
[1:15:47] judgment it's called dull of hearing
[1:15:48] they can't hear the word of God anymore
[1:15:51] so why do we grow in judgment so we can
[1:15:54] improve oh this I approve of this this
[1:15:56] is good to be in my life I approve of
[1:15:59] this I could take that into my heart I
[1:16:00] can approve this or disproof things that
[1:16:04] are excellent that we may be sincere
[1:16:06] without offence to the day of Christ
[1:16:08] being filled with the fruits of
[1:16:09] righteousness which are by Jesus Christ
[1:16:11] unto the glory and praise of God how
[1:16:14] many want to be filled with the fruits
[1:16:16] of righteousness that your life is right
[1:16:19] you're doing the right things
[1:16:21] that's righteousness the right things
[1:16:23] and you've approved well I allow this
[1:16:27] because I know this is right I'll be
[1:16:31] just very honest with you church you
[1:16:32] know one of the things where I've got to
[1:16:34] constantly make sure I'm watching the
[1:16:36] prove of is with music I wasn't raised
[1:16:39] in a message church so I'm used to you
[1:16:40] know I'm using I'm used to loud drums
[1:16:42] and a little bit of electric guitar and
[1:16:46] I know a lot of churches have like your
[1:16:47] guitar albian has electric guitar
[1:16:49] they're real gentle with it you know
[1:16:50] brother Donny happy Valley Church got an
[1:16:53] electric guitar even brother Humes down
[1:16:55] there and North God he had electric
[1:16:57] guitar well that's one thing if if I'm
[1:16:59] not careful I'll let a song I'll play a
[1:17:02] song or I'll start liking a song that's
[1:17:04] got a little too much of that a little
[1:17:07] bit too much and if I'm not careful then
[1:17:10] I'll start like another one like that
[1:17:11] and this is where I know I'm growing in
[1:17:15] that because I'm starting to get rid of
[1:17:16] that oh I didn't catch that before I got
[1:17:18] rid of that and so I'm seeing myself
[1:17:20] growing that and be able to catch the
[1:17:23] right music by the grace of the Lord how
[1:17:25] many can understand that that's the area
[1:17:27] where I know I've grown but I also know
[1:17:29] I need to really rely upon the Lord so
[1:17:35] know yours might be in what you believe
[1:17:36] you know maybe you just believe other
[1:17:37] things that maybe aren't exactly
[1:17:39] scriptural so you've got to really make
[1:17:41] sure the things you approve that you
[1:17:43] believe are actually the scriptural
[1:17:45] truth or might be relationships you know
[1:17:48] you're just kind of lacks with
[1:17:49] relationships and you'll just be
[1:17:50] anybody's friend
[1:17:51] and you'll just do whatever they ask you
[1:17:53] to do and there's no boundaries and you
[1:17:55] find yourself being influenced by other
[1:17:57] people that you shouldn't be being
[1:17:58] influenced by and so we need God's help
[1:18:00] to grow in that area I want to be filled
[1:18:03] with his love
[1:18:04] let me fill with this fruit you see this
[1:18:07] is what the this is the thought brother
[1:18:09] branham is bringing out that we have our
[1:18:10] own throne and people will contact God
[1:18:14] through us right cuz program said God
[1:18:17] has no hands for yours and is yours and
[1:18:19] mine right
[1:18:20] he has no feet with your feet he has no
[1:18:22] voice right now except your voice so we
[1:18:25] are the extension were the
[1:18:27] representations of the throne of God
[1:18:31] look what Jesus said I haven't seemed
[1:18:34] like I hadn't read this in years and
[1:18:35] just kind of blessed me today I like my
[1:18:37] I forgot about that story Moses
[1:18:39] therefore gave you the circumcision not
[1:18:41] because it is a Moses but of the
[1:18:42] father's and yet on the Sabbath day
[1:18:44] circumcise a man I say I forgot I forgot
[1:18:47] that the Jews were were circumcising on
[1:18:50] the Sabbath I forgot about that
[1:18:51] so here they are working on the Sabbath
[1:18:53] you know imagine how bloody and gross
[1:18:55] that would be circumcisions and then
[1:18:59] they see Jesus here on the Sabbath and
[1:19:01] they get all upset
[1:19:02] yeah they got blood and they got gauze
[1:19:04] and they're you know they're cleaning it
[1:19:05] up and they got alcohol to clean the
[1:19:07] cuts and wounds they're working over
[1:19:09] here in surgeries and they see Jesus
[1:19:12] heal a paralyzed person they get upset
[1:19:14] you're working on the Sabbath and yet
[1:19:15] they're over here we're working on the
[1:19:17] Sabbath - oh my goodness
[1:19:19] it's so much hypocrisy in church if
[1:19:22] we're not careful we'll be the same way
[1:19:24] all right we'll look at other churches
[1:19:26] say look what they do look what they
[1:19:28] allow and if we're not careful we might
[1:19:30] allow some of that sinful - look at
[1:19:34] verse 23 if a man the Sabbath day
[1:19:36] received circumcision that the law of
[1:19:38] Moses should not be broken and you're
[1:19:40] angry at me because I made a man every
[1:19:41] wood hole in the Sabbath day can't you
[1:19:43] see your hypocrisy he said judge not
[1:19:46] according to the appearance but Judge
[1:19:49] righteous judgment so Jesus gives us the
[1:19:53] license we are supposed to judge but we
[1:19:57] must do it righteously right he gives us
[1:20:02] that he
[1:20:03] he he doesn't say boy don't judge he
[1:20:06] says no judge righteously because
[1:20:08] everybody has a throat everybody's got
[1:20:10] to make judgments somebody is ruling
[1:20:12] every person's life here tonight and it
[1:20:15] needs to be the Holy Ghost same ahead
[1:20:16] because he's the real judge he's the
[1:20:20] onus he's the only judge and we need I
[1:20:24] need Christ to judge things in my life
[1:20:26] just like you do I've got a constantly
[1:20:29] say Lord is this right I got to say holy
[1:20:31] holy holy unto the Lord is this right is
[1:20:34] this the right thing to say is this the
[1:20:36] right thing to do should i download this
[1:20:38] should I not watch this what should I do
[1:20:39] we've got to approve everything by the
[1:20:42] judge that's in our heart amen
[1:20:45] this is what Bertram's teaching this
[1:20:47] with the Holy Spirit told brother Ram to
[1:20:48] bring out to the people I love it now
[1:20:52] here's where now this is here's an
[1:20:54] example where Jesus Jesus was the throne
[1:20:59] of God okay an extension of the throne
[1:21:01] of God of course we know the fullness of
[1:21:03] God was in him but member he still said
[1:21:04] father they were still father on the
[1:21:06] throne as well at the same time jesus
[1:21:09] said he that rejects me and received not
[1:21:10] my words hath one that judgeth the word
[1:21:13] that I've spoken the same shall judge
[1:21:15] him at the last day so see Jesus was
[1:21:19] saying you know eventually the Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost is going to be the judge and
[1:21:22] you'll either judge yourselves worthy or
[1:21:24] judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting
[1:21:26] life but the word that he preached to
[1:21:29] everybody those words wouldn't meet them
[1:21:31] all on the day of judgment because it
[1:21:34] was God's word issuing forth from the
[1:21:36] throne of God and church how many
[1:21:40] couldn't how many understand that when
[1:21:41] we come in here any preacher who's
[1:21:43] annoyed that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:44] it is God's voice speaking out from his
[1:21:46] throne unto us is every understanding
[1:21:48] that that's why I church is so important
[1:21:50] and I don't want to miss any I don't
[1:21:52] want to miss any Word of God that God is
[1:21:54] trying to clean out my life or God is
[1:21:56] trying to encourage me or strengthen me
[1:21:58] or heal me whatever he's trying to do I
[1:22:01] want God's voice in my life amen I want
[1:22:04] to hear the voice from the throne hey
[1:22:07] man
[1:22:08] Alleluia now I got about all these taps
[1:22:13] I didn't mean to do this this is the
[1:22:14] last thought I'm gonna try to close with
[1:22:16] this and give me about 15 minute
[1:22:17] - I had all these taps here so this is
[1:22:20] the thought brother Graham ends well I'm
[1:22:22] sorry exactly there's actually more
[1:22:23] thoughts I haven't gotten to he's got a
[1:22:24] few more thoughts we'll get to that next
[1:22:26] time so we see how this outer core is
[1:22:28] the body of man program says the Holy
[1:22:31] Spirit want him to say this then you
[1:22:32] have the spirit of man which is the holy
[1:22:34] place that's the human spirit then you
[1:22:38] have the soul of man which is the
[1:22:40] holiest of holies or the nature of the
[1:22:42] very nature of the human being all right
[1:22:46] now this is the illustration brother Ram
[1:22:48] drew it out of the chalkboard you drew
[1:22:50] it on the paper to show the people this
[1:22:52] is the illustration and the Bible says
[1:22:54] we've got three parts I pray your whole
[1:22:56] spirit soul and body be preserved
[1:22:57] blameless on the coming of the Lord so
[1:23:01] the Holy Spirit wanted you and I to know
[1:23:03] that we are a triune being now he says
[1:23:08] this I want to just read I don't have
[1:23:09] the quotes up here I just have it right
[1:23:10] here he said what is man he's a triune
[1:23:15] being body soul spirit how many know was
[1:23:18] that he said watch God's approach what
[1:23:20] is what is his heart
[1:23:22] you remember my message God chose a
[1:23:23] man's heart for his control tower the
[1:23:25] devil chose his head for the control
[1:23:27] tower see he makes him see things look
[1:23:30] through his eyes
[1:23:30] but God in his heart makes him believe
[1:23:33] things that he cannot see so Satan wants
[1:23:35] you to believe just the things that you
[1:23:37] can see God wants you to close your eyes
[1:23:39] and believe things you cannot see that's
[1:23:42] the beauty of prayer amen
[1:23:45] he says see God is on his heart in the
[1:23:50] heart of man is the throne of God you
[1:23:52] get it God made his throne in the heart
[1:23:54] of man he said that's the first part of
[1:23:59] it he said what's the first part of man
[1:24:00] the first part of man in his body the
[1:24:02] next part is his soul but brother man
[1:24:03] means spirit because he fixes it later
[1:24:05] in 1963-64 and 65 he said and now he
[1:24:12] approaches now the third part is his
[1:24:13] soul and the soul is the center of his
[1:24:16] heart and the center of his heart is
[1:24:18] where God comes for the throne
[1:24:22] now program goes back to the outer
[1:24:24] courts let's look at this outer courts
[1:24:25] for a moment he says now what is the
[1:24:28] outer court that's the flesh that's the
[1:24:30] first thing you come to
[1:24:31] to the flesh he says you've got to
[1:24:34] consume that first you've got to pass
[1:24:36] beyond the flesh and here's the example
[1:24:41] brother Bram gives now I didn't make
[1:24:43] this up brother branham said this he
[1:24:45] says this is how you passed me on the
[1:24:46] flesh he said I don't feel like getting
[1:24:49] up and going to church the roads are too
[1:24:52] slick in India Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:24:56] but man said that's the flesh so anytime
[1:25:01] you try to make an excuse well I'm
[1:25:03] coughing a little bit probably shouldn't
[1:25:06] go to church stub my toe yesterday
[1:25:09] probably shouldn't go to church roads
[1:25:14] might be a little slick but Ram said
[1:25:18] that's the flesh and you've got to get
[1:25:19] past that he said oh it's too slick or
[1:25:24] that's too hot tonight the firt or the
[1:25:27] air conditioners broken at church better
[1:25:29] not go to church tonight better stay
[1:25:31] home and livestreamer if I even do that
[1:25:33] maybe I'll just you know go out and do
[1:25:35] some errands for the under stay he said
[1:25:41] that's the flesh he said now you got to
[1:25:43] consume that and walk through that God
[1:25:47] has to get through that the next time he
[1:25:49] come he comes into the spirit he says Oh
[1:25:52] what will the Jones say about me you
[1:25:54] know my church will kick me out if I do
[1:25:56] something like that he said you've got
[1:25:58] to walk through that so the flesh is
[1:26:01] like I just don't even want to go or not
[1:26:03] for us it's like this I'm too tired to
[1:26:05] pray I said I guess I'm too busy to pray
[1:26:09] that's where the flesh battles us
[1:26:12] probably the most right oh I can't do it
[1:26:16] from two-time ironer I'm too busy
[1:26:18] the example he gives us oh I could never
[1:26:20] know he's talking about spiritual gifts
[1:26:22] like oh I could never dance the spirit I
[1:26:24] could never speak in tongues
[1:26:25] I can never shout and cry because what
[1:26:28] will the people think about me in the
[1:26:29] church they'll think you got the Holy
[1:26:31] Ghost is probably they'll think it's a
[1:26:34] church amen
[1:26:35] they'll think they'll think like you're
[1:26:37] anointed or something like that if I see
[1:26:40] somebody shout or cry or raise their
[1:26:42] hands or rejoice I think by the
[1:26:44] holy spirits here praise God God finally
[1:26:47] got ahold of somebody hey man I love
[1:26:50] those times hallelujah
[1:26:52] like Sunday was a great weeping time for
[1:26:54] me all that message on léa léa love to
[1:26:57] the Lord just oh I just felt like I was
[1:27:00] back at Calvary forgiven wash on if God
[1:27:04] loved Leah and God kept all the promises
[1:27:06] to Leah and made her a builder of the
[1:27:09] house of God despite having eye trouble
[1:27:12] did you catch that like Paul
[1:27:13] she had eye trouble like Paul she was
[1:27:15] tender eyed she wasn't as beautiful
[1:27:18] maybe she had high trouble and couldn't
[1:27:20] see as well well so did Paul Paul said I
[1:27:22] wrote so big a letters because I've got
[1:27:24] eye trouble he said you were too gripped
[1:27:26] out your eyes and given to me if I would
[1:27:28] ask you for Oh hallelujah look at that
[1:27:34] we've got to come through the flesh and
[1:27:36] come here then we got to come here we
[1:27:38] got to forget what anybody says we just
[1:27:40] got to realize God's here and then he
[1:27:46] said if you can go through that he said
[1:27:48] and then when you can walk through that
[1:27:50] then he goes into the heart and that's
[1:27:53] where he's thrown so the baptism of the
[1:27:57] Holy Ghost means Christ is fully throned
[1:28:00] in your heart and then everything that
[1:28:04] judged or that his judge must come
[1:28:07] through the Holy Spirit now we know even
[1:28:09] the Holy Ghost filled people can make
[1:28:10] mistakes right Paul said I want to do
[1:28:12] good but evils right there with me the
[1:28:13] good that I want to do I don't do
[1:28:15] remember Paul caught Peter and said oh
[1:28:18] you're the guilty one
[1:28:19] you know you've separated yourself from
[1:28:21] the Gentiles remember that and he was to
[1:28:23] be blamed so Peter was basically a
[1:28:26] segregationist at one point he was
[1:28:28] segregated I kind of said like this
[1:28:30] racist can I say like that he was racist
[1:28:32] against Gentiles for a while I wouldn't
[1:28:34] eat with them and Paul had to come
[1:28:35] straighten him out but see a real child
[1:28:37] of God can be straightened out that's
[1:28:41] right
[1:28:42] Oh Graham said see
[1:28:46] he's thrown that's the Holy Spirit Jesus
[1:28:49] said it before now he even brings it
[1:28:50] down to children who will eventually be
[1:28:52] filled with Holy Spirit he said any
[1:28:54] better than a millstone was hanging at
[1:28:55] your neck and he was drowning the depths
[1:28:57] of the sea then they even offend one of
[1:29:00] these little ones that believe in me hey
[1:29:03] man I think about all these Catholic
[1:29:07] priest Church that have offended God's
[1:29:10] little children and they've deceived
[1:29:14] them and take him in the back room and
[1:29:16] done evil things jesus said to be better
[1:29:18] that a millstone was hanging around
[1:29:20] their neck and you know this church I
[1:29:22] have an article from the Washington Post
[1:29:24] from two weeks ago
[1:29:25] I never preached it I was trying to get
[1:29:27] there I guess it's for tonight and the
[1:29:30] Washington Post I mean oh that's a very
[1:29:31] respected journal or newspaper and they
[1:29:37] had a man who interviewed the Pope and
[1:29:39] in the interview the man the man who was
[1:29:43] abused with the Pope how he been abused
[1:29:45] by some other priests and the Pope said
[1:29:47] don't you know abuse is not a sin he
[1:29:50] said it's just a mistake in that awful
[1:29:55] and that's in print that's for the whole
[1:29:59] world to see abusing a child is not a
[1:30:02] sin
[1:30:03] that's from the pizza hell that's why
[1:30:06] she's called the mother harlot
[1:30:07] that's why she's called the a mother of
[1:30:09] abomination and that's why the throne in
[1:30:12] heaven will rejoice when she's judged
[1:30:15] because it mean better if a millstone is
[1:30:18] always wrapped around that priests neck
[1:30:20] and thrown the seat than to offend one
[1:30:22] of these little children hallelujah can
[1:30:26] you imagine the wicked perversion I
[1:30:30] don't care how nice he looks I don't
[1:30:32] care that he drives the Escalade well
[1:30:34] they drive him in escalator a Royals
[1:30:37] Royce or whatever you call it Mercedes
[1:30:39] man's the outside has nothing to do with
[1:30:42] it
[1:30:42] he's got to be clean on the inside and
[1:30:44] that proves he's never been washed on
[1:30:45] the inside amen if you can look at
[1:30:49] sexual abuse and say oh it's not a sin
[1:30:51] it's just a mistake I got the article if
[1:30:54] you want to I'll text it to you after
[1:30:55] church if you want it my eyes were my I
[1:30:57] just came to tears my I felt I felt
[1:30:59] emotion coming up and to be ready to cry
[1:31:01] are you kidding me the man that
[1:31:04] everybody looks as you know Rick Warren
[1:31:06] says our Pope you know I hate to call
[1:31:08] names everybody just kind of stepped out
[1:31:10] there but people call them our Pope
[1:31:11] he's not my Pope God is my Heavenly
[1:31:14] Father and I only got one Heavenly
[1:31:16] Father that's the Holy Father amen to
[1:31:21] see you think about one of these
[1:31:22] children and I know people that were
[1:31:25] abused as children that are now
[1:31:26] Christians in the message and think
[1:31:28] about that abuser when that abuser snuck
[1:31:31] up on that individual wherever they were
[1:31:34] outside at a park or in a home wherever
[1:31:37] they were when that abuser snuck up they
[1:31:38] were really stinking up on a potential
[1:31:40] throne of God let me understand what I'm
[1:31:43] saying
[1:31:44] where the Word of God that's why I Paul
[1:31:46] said don't you know that the Saints will
[1:31:49] judge the earth because that was a
[1:31:52] potential throne of God and that person
[1:31:54] came in there to a temple of God which
[1:31:57] housed the throne of God and defiled
[1:31:59] that temple and they'll answer at the
[1:32:02] day of judgment if not confess they'll
[1:32:04] answer the day of judgment for defiling
[1:32:06] the temple of God everybody with me and
[1:32:12] so this is
[1:32:14] Nishan this is so important for us to
[1:32:18] know and applying to this day and age
[1:32:20] that no matter what the outer court
[1:32:23] looks like it's about what's on the
[1:32:25] inside they could white wash their
[1:32:29] clothes
[1:32:30] the Pharisees could whitewash the tombs
[1:32:32] and the cephalic curves and make
[1:32:35] everything look beautiful but inside it
[1:32:37] was full of dead men's bones death was
[1:32:41] actually on the inside all right but Ram
[1:32:49] said do not do them any harm just even
[1:32:51] to bring a fence of them just upset them
[1:32:54] about something it'd be better that you
[1:32:55] were you yourself drowned or never been
[1:32:57] born on the earth then even to bring it
[1:32:59] an offense to one did he mean it could
[1:33:01] Jesus lie did the apostles say it he
[1:33:04] said jesus said it jesus said if even
[1:33:05] bring an offense to one of them little
[1:33:07] ones that believe in me
[1:33:09] oh my now brother Brad now gives another
[1:33:16] example let's let's go to another
[1:33:17] example
[1:33:18] brother man talks about a preacher who
[1:33:20] preaches the gospel but he doesn't
[1:33:22] believe in mark 16 anymore these signs
[1:33:25] shall follow them to believe and the
[1:33:29] brother gives up he gives a conversation
[1:33:31] with the preach who doesn't believe and
[1:33:32] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:33:33] that believe and some great big fella
[1:33:35] say all I believe in hallelujah have you
[1:33:37] ever spoken tongues interpret tongues
[1:33:39] cast out devils visions as he promised
[1:33:41] no that's the days pass brother Bram
[1:33:43] said that man is not a believer because
[1:33:47] a believer believes all the Word of God
[1:33:49] and the power of God Jesus said these
[1:33:53] signs shall follow them that believe he
[1:33:56] said that's the last words he says
[1:33:57] that's the Bible see that man he says is
[1:34:00] a make believer now here's what bro
[1:34:02] Graham tells us he said fine but when
[1:34:06] you find a believer that really believes
[1:34:08] with signs following and you see the
[1:34:11] humility of their life not an
[1:34:13] impersonator you know that they are a
[1:34:16] Christian a real genuine article just
[1:34:19] keep still the thing you ought to do is
[1:34:22] join right up with them start moving
[1:34:24] along because you're moving right up the
[1:34:26] Kings Highway
[1:34:27] amen hallelujah that's what we have at
[1:34:32] our church we have gifts in our church
[1:34:35] we know that many of us haven't seen
[1:34:39] signs miracles and wonders how many can
[1:34:41] say amen to that so the thing to do is
[1:34:45] stay with the Word of God stay with
[1:34:48] those who are living a humble life
[1:34:50] brother Branham says the humility of
[1:34:52] their life not in a person ater trying
[1:34:54] to impersonate the message but someone
[1:34:56] who lives the message now program goes
[1:35:01] to the church ages he says the outer
[1:35:03] court with Luther
[1:35:05] Wesley pilgrim holiness and now the last
[1:35:08] day so brother BAM he gives that type to
[1:35:10] I want to make sure I say that I'm gonna
[1:35:14] close to this the last and your power
[1:35:18] with this but the last thing before the
[1:35:21] holiest of holies was the veil and I
[1:35:24] want to just bring this out I don't
[1:35:25] think I've ever preached this
[1:35:26] specifically so I just want to close
[1:35:27] with this thought and I'll read - I'll
[1:35:32] read the quote here now brother Branham
[1:35:40] says how there's five gates to the outer
[1:35:42] court there's a see taste see smell and
[1:35:45] hear and there's five gates to the inner
[1:35:47] court which is a conscious reason
[1:35:50] affection imagination and I always
[1:35:52] forget one of them conscious reason
[1:35:53] affection imagination what's the other
[1:35:55] one memory yes
[1:35:57] conscious memory reason affection
[1:35:59] imagination yeah memory thank you I
[1:36:00] always forget one of those it seems like
[1:36:02] I can always get for him I got that
[1:36:04] fifth one he says now it's got these
[1:36:10] gates he still remember there was a veil
[1:36:16] a veil that hangs between the holy and
[1:36:19] the holiest of Holies and the hoist of
[1:36:23] hoist is where Christ comes to sit on
[1:36:25] your hearts throne Christ is enthroned
[1:36:27] he comes through justification
[1:36:30] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:36:33] Holy Ghost that veil he says you
[1:36:37] know what that male is that bails your
[1:36:39] heart from it he said are you ready let
[1:36:41] me know what it is he says that bail is
[1:36:44] called self-will let's say together
[1:36:47] ready self-will brother Ram said this
[1:36:50] veil is self-will which makes perfect
[1:36:52] sense
[1:36:53] it shows how people can come all the way
[1:36:55] but then be lost the Bible said member
[1:36:59] they can trample they can be sanctified
[1:37:01] and trample publicly the son of God and
[1:37:05] beat them for it see they can follow
[1:37:08] along they could enjoy the cross they
[1:37:09] can do you enjoy the church ages the
[1:37:12] mysteries the bread and the prayer but
[1:37:14] they can't actually their prayers can't
[1:37:15] actually get them in the presence of God
[1:37:17] because they still have the will of
[1:37:19] themselves so brogrammer said what is
[1:37:24] keeping people out he said itself will
[1:37:26] you get the picture now their senses of
[1:37:29] the body senses to the spirit but the
[1:37:31] veil between that and the holy place he
[1:37:33] said his self will and the only way you
[1:37:37] can get in there is to have self will
[1:37:39] for whosoever will he said whoever
[1:37:43] whoever shakes hands know who suffers
[1:37:45] immersed know who sever joins the church
[1:37:48] know who suffer passes his letter know
[1:37:50] who sever will come behind the veil he
[1:37:56] said let Christ come to the senses and
[1:37:58] say well I ought to I don't want to go
[1:38:02] to hell that's one thing I'll join
[1:38:03] church he says all right Luther and I've
[1:38:05] had Lutheran's literally tell me that
[1:38:07] last fall I went to that reunion member
[1:38:10] I did the football reunion last year
[1:38:11] remember that back in the December I
[1:38:14] literally had a Lutheran I was
[1:38:16] witnessing this Lutheran about the Lord
[1:38:17] he's an older man he's of custodian at
[1:38:20] our old high school and I was witness to
[1:38:23] his about the Lord and talking all about
[1:38:24] Jesus and I was getting really excited
[1:38:26] he's like Oh Luther's don't know about
[1:38:28] that we're just saved by grace you know
[1:38:30] he literally told me that as I said if
[1:38:33] you knew why ever want to know any more
[1:38:34] let me know he's a Lutheran and he
[1:38:36] literally realizes I want to drink my
[1:38:39] alcohol but I want to be saved too and
[1:38:43] I've had I've had numerous Lutheran's
[1:38:45] tell me that as well because I grew up
[1:38:46] in a in a town that had a lot of
[1:38:48] Lutheran's and some of them were my best
[1:38:49] friends that's how I know that
[1:38:51] now not every Lutheran's like that my
[1:38:53] wife was a Lutheran by the way but now
[1:38:54] she's a Holy Ghost filled Saint so she
[1:38:57] knows about that's a lot of people's
[1:38:59] attitudes like they know Lutheran's know
[1:39:01] they don't have as much doctor as a
[1:39:03] Baptist right they know that and they
[1:39:05] know they don't have as much charismatic
[1:39:07] worship as the Pentecostals they know
[1:39:11] that and many of them are okay see they
[1:39:13] failed to go on past this outer court
[1:39:16] they know they haven't gone on to into
[1:39:20] here now how do we know we've gone on to
[1:39:23] here because jesus said the Holy Ghost
[1:39:24] will guide you into all truth
[1:39:27] everything the Bible says you want to
[1:39:30] live it you want to believe it you want
[1:39:33] to see God manifested in every part of
[1:39:35] your life and you're so hungry for God
[1:39:37] you just want more of God all the time a
[1:39:39] man because he's at hungers and thirst
[1:39:41] for righteousness shall be filled
[1:39:44] that's right church but Aram said all
[1:39:49] right whoever will let him come past the
[1:39:50] ribbon veil all glory to God I'm on the
[1:39:53] other side Halle tuning to his name
[1:39:54] whosoever will let him tear it down tear
[1:39:57] down the curtains of his own will that's
[1:40:02] beautiful
[1:40:02] and let God come into his heart
[1:40:06] there's Christ on his judgement seat in
[1:40:08] the human heart what's to happen now
[1:40:11] this is my last thought so bear with man
[1:40:13] just give me five more minutes as my
[1:40:14] last thought brother branham brings us
[1:40:16] out and now remember the Scriptures I
[1:40:20] mentioned earlier you judge yourselves
[1:40:23] unworthy of everlasting life remember
[1:40:25] that now that the Holy Ghost is here
[1:40:28] when a real believer preaches the word
[1:40:30] or witnesses or lives the life of God it
[1:40:33] says anything from Christ's anointing to
[1:40:36] that person and bites them to church if
[1:40:38] they turn that down right there that
[1:40:41] could be them being judged and miss
[1:40:43] eternal life right there right because
[1:40:46] that's what happened Paul said they
[1:40:47] blaspheme they've judged themselves
[1:40:48] unworthy of everlasting life that's why
[1:40:52] every meeting we have is so important
[1:40:53] we've got to constantly walk holy holy
[1:40:56] holy unto the Lord now remember we also
[1:41:00] have the confidence though that all that
[1:41:02] the father has given me will come to me
[1:41:04] so we have
[1:41:05] that confidence to here's my last
[1:41:08] thought this is the from brother BAM
[1:41:10] this is paragraph 277 now brother man is
[1:41:14] talking about sinners they say oh you
[1:41:15] say I can tell dirty jokes it don't
[1:41:18] condemn me and women can say I have
[1:41:21] short hair it don't condemn me I can
[1:41:24] wear shorts it don't condemn me men can
[1:41:27] say it don't hurt me to smoke cigars and
[1:41:28] don't hurt me to play some cards and
[1:41:30] shoot dice it don't hurt me and brother
[1:41:33] BAM says that's because there's nothing
[1:41:35] there on your throne to condemn you for
[1:41:37] it
[1:41:39] the church said why doesn't it condemn
[1:41:43] people like women when they cut their
[1:41:45] hair or men when they tell filthy jokes
[1:41:47] or lust after other wit men's wives or
[1:41:48] single women or whatever watch
[1:41:50] pornography why doesn't it condemn them
[1:41:52] because Christ is not sitting on the
[1:41:54] throne of their heart is that right he
[1:42:02] says but when Christ comes in you prated
[1:42:05] an altar on your heart and your sins are
[1:42:08] taken daily as the great Saint Paul said
[1:42:11] I die daily nevertheless I live but not
[1:42:15] me Christ liveth within me he says
[1:42:18] there's the Intervale brother sister
[1:42:20] let's stand to our feet
[1:42:21] there's the Intervale praise God so the
[1:42:34] Holy Spirit inspired the prophet of God
[1:42:36] to share these circles he called him the
[1:42:39] three parts and the show this is why
[1:42:42] people don't feel condemned when they do
[1:42:44] wrong Church aren't you glad that you
[1:42:46] feel bad when you sin aren't you aren't
[1:42:50] you glad that something says no you
[1:42:52] should not have done that
[1:42:53] I remember brother Richard Sanchez from
[1:42:55] Sheffield when I first became in the
[1:42:57] message you know he said brother Jesse
[1:42:59] said one day I was at work and I was
[1:43:00] chewing some chewing gum and I just
[1:43:01] opened it up and he stopped through the
[1:43:03] paper back and he said I can't walk it
[1:43:05] he said all of a sudden the Holy Spirit
[1:43:06] said I didn't like that just a simple
[1:43:10] example he said he went back and picked
[1:43:12] that up and he said then he felt back in
[1:43:14] fellowship with the Lord and that's what
[1:43:17] it is Church that's
[1:43:18] I Christ should sit on all of our
[1:43:20] Thrones of our hearts that so when we do
[1:43:24] just one little thing wrong we can hear
[1:43:27] this still small voice and said I didn't
[1:43:30] mean that
[1:43:31] lord please forgive me I'll make that
[1:43:33] right as soon as I possibly can that
[1:43:35] wasn't the right thing to say wasn't the
[1:43:38] right thing to think wasn't the right
[1:43:39] thing to do I thought that was a good
[1:43:42] example now Church we all know this too
[1:43:50] like in the case like like I said of st.
[1:43:53] Paul and st. Peter someone can have the
[1:43:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost but if they
[1:43:57] stop listening to that judges voice and
[1:44:00] they start living in the flesh or living
[1:44:03] in the spirit they can grieve the Holy
[1:44:05] Spirit because that's what Paul says
[1:44:06] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:44:09] whereby you're sealed to the day of your
[1:44:12] Redemption and how many know that so we
[1:44:14] have to battle today grieving which
[1:44:16] means offending so sometimes we we fail
[1:44:20] to listen to the judge and when we do
[1:44:21] that we start living in our mind one
[1:44:23] smart enough to figure this out I'm
[1:44:24] clever enough I'm good enough I don't
[1:44:27] need to pray I don't need to die daily
[1:44:29] today I'm okay or whatever excuse it
[1:44:33] maybe and if we live out of here we
[1:44:35] grieve the Holy Spirit and that offends
[1:44:38] the Holy Spirit brother Branham says
[1:44:39] like a dove that flies away from your
[1:44:42] human spirit it never left your soul
[1:44:44] because your souls sealed to the day of
[1:44:46] your Redemption and that explains why
[1:44:49] people today can be born again and do
[1:44:51] sins they shouldn't do because they
[1:44:54] stopped hearing the voice from the
[1:44:55] throne on their heart we've got to be
[1:44:59] careful to listen to that voice
[1:45:02] how many would say you've heard the
[1:45:03] voice of God tune I speak to your heart
[1:45:05] amen
[1:45:07] I have to let's have a word of Prayer
[1:45:11] here as we get ready to close and sing
[1:45:13] some songs back I can come oh my
[1:45:22] you and I are so blessed that we can
[1:45:25] recognize our heart is a throne of
[1:45:28] Christ the Holy Ghost we are so blessed
[1:45:32] the Pope of Rome with gold all over his
[1:45:35] his neck and his fingers an unlimited
[1:45:39] bank account
[1:45:40] he can't even recognize that abusing
[1:45:44] children is wrong because there's
[1:45:45] nothing on the throne
[1:45:47] oh my thank God for the Holy Ghost in
[1:45:53] this hour thank God that God would
[1:46:00] condescend as we sang on Sunday down
[1:46:03] from his glory that God would condescend
[1:46:05] and have a little representation of a
[1:46:08] miniature throne here on earth and dwell
[1:46:12] in you and I Alleluia how many would say
[1:46:19] pray for me brother Jesse and I'll judge
[1:46:21] all things up my judgement will about my
[1:46:24] hands up as well I want I want my
[1:46:26] judgment to increase be more fruitful
[1:46:32] I'll pray for you church let's just all
[1:46:34] pray together for one another
[1:46:36] Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight
[1:46:41] we recognize Lord that you put a throne
[1:46:43] in every heart of every individual law
[1:46:49] and every individual has to make a
[1:46:51] decision will they let you sit on their
[1:46:53] throne or will they allow the devil
[1:46:59] father many of us here made that
[1:47:01] decision many years ago we want you to
[1:47:04] sit upon the throne of our heart but
[1:47:09] Lauren I think we all can say tonight
[1:47:11] that we won our judgment to grow we want
[1:47:16] your voice from the throne of our heart
[1:47:18] to get louder we don't want to hush that
[1:47:26] holy voice of judgment
[1:47:31] we want to hear it more clearly so
[1:47:44] father help us tonight Lord God as we've
[1:47:46] looked at your scriptures Lord let us
[1:47:49] judge ourselves worthy of everlasting
[1:47:50] life let's be careful that we do not
[1:47:54] offend the little ones with word or
[1:47:58] anything Lord especially not physically
[1:48:00] but Lord not even with word one of these
[1:48:03] little ones that believes in you Lord
[1:48:05] God because they've got a little thrown
[1:48:09] upon their heart they're a little
[1:48:10] tabernacle of the Holy Ghost as well and
[1:48:14] Lord we would never wanted to file your
[1:48:16] house Lord God or any representation of
[1:48:21] your house granite Lord Jesus we are
[1:48:32] fully dependent depending upon the voice
[1:48:35] of the Holy Spirit on the throne of our
[1:48:38] heart dear God no wonder your spirit
[1:48:43] move the Prophet to preach this Lord God
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:51] Lord if that self-will needs torn up
[1:48:56] Lord I pray you'd help us to tear that
[1:48:58] up tonight amen
[1:49:00] Lord anything that we want to do that
[1:49:02] doesn't line up with your plan
[1:49:03] may we tear that veil tonight Lord God
[1:49:06] afresh
[1:49:09] as even Jesus did it in the garden all
[1:49:13] that this cup might pass from me
[1:49:14] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[1:49:19] done or how he wrestled for the victory
[1:49:23] for our souls hallelujah Oh God let us
[1:49:27] die daily Lord go beyond the veil retina

[1:49:55] conscience may they feel that they've
[1:49:56] gone beyond the the outer court and the
[1:49:59] inner core and now they're in your
[1:50:01] presence Lord God
