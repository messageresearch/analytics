all going to happen especially with the cancer people we don't know the outcomes right so we need the Holy Spirit to make intercession and in that in that text it says we must pray according to the will of God so that's so important let's pray according to the will of God and let's just see how the Holy Spirit prays for us or pray I'm sorry through US rather the holy spirit will pray through us

to read his word may be seated so I just want to preach on Romans 8 here and maybe we can finish the chapter tonight if we could finish the chapter that would be wonderful of course I never want to limit the Holy Spirit uh by the grace of the Lord and just so you know I did not get the um Sunday morning service up on YouTube yet in fact I just put the other one up from uh last week Wednesday so uh our emotions part two controlling our emotions part two I just put that up this week so I'll try to get last Sundays up soon uh as soon as I can by the grace of God I kind of just forgot I should have put it up yesterday but I just kind of forgot about that I'll try to get to that soon so we want to look here at Romans 811 now we'll start right in here I'll set a timer Lord willing we'll try to get hit about an hour by the grace of the Lord Romans 811 we read this last time and we saw that I believe church and I believe the Bible proves it any man or woman who is Justified has the spirit of Christ in them they have it in their minds praise God and I even wrote in my uh 2021 book I believe there's I believe there's evidence that the soul can have a small anointing of the Holy Spirit without being filled I believe that there's evidence for that because the Bible said uh that lot was a righteous Soul right so how could he be righteous unless the Holy Spirit was in his soul somehow so I believe that I but I believe in the New Testament now the fullness of the Holy Ghost can come into the soul Hallelujah now that's just a small little thought I just thought I'd share actually wasn't even in my notes but I do believe that because how could the souls be called righteous unless the Holy Spirit was in there so that's just my humble opinion but I believe a person uh the Bible said when they're Justified is they're declared righteous as though they never did it in the first place and as righteous as they would hope to be the the the Greek says so a Justified person has the spirit of Christ a Sanctified person has more of the spirit of Christ amen but a holy ghost filled person they have the fullness of Christ Hallelujah in other words the fullness in their soul and then in their minds their daily uh striving to keep God's spirit filling their minds amen therefore Brethren verse 12 we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh now I thought I'd share this you know you don't owe your flesh nothing Hallelujah I just want to pull this out of there I thought didn't think about about that till today when I was studying the Bible said you're not a debor to the flesh you don't have to cater to your flesh when was the last time your flesh really did something good for you praise God I can't think of one time where actually did something good for me think about it you know whenever we would give think about the times we've given into our flesh well this would feel good or my flesh might like that you know and it was sin when was the last time it actually benefited us of course it never will the Bible said there's no fruit to any work of Darkness right there's nothing good to it so let's remember we don't owe the fles nothing what we owe is the Bible said we owe God our love hallelujah hallelujah we're debtors to the spirit that's where we owe our allegiance to because Jesus Christ has purchased our souls Hallelujah and so we're debtors to the Holy Spirit and that's what verse 13 TI in for if ye live after the flesh you shall die but if you live through the spir I'm sorry but if ye through the spirit do mortify crucify the Deeds of the body ye shall live so that's when you know Church you're really living right like today right when you crucified your desires to to sin you were really living how many enjy really living today amen now think about that the rest of the eight billion people they weren't living because they were feeding their flesh but you and I were living Hallelujah isn't that interesting we're living while we're dying Hallelujah right we're we're we're crucifying the desires of the of sin right desires of Flesh and while we're doing that we're actually living we're living and dying at the same time it's a parad it really is hallelujah because the Bible said you must mortify that means crucify Hallelujah slowly dying but yet also living in the soul praise God you know I I had a couple people this week tell me they saw good things in me you know in one in one one case I was I was helping a student and these these teachers looked at me after I helped the student and they said you know they said Jesse that student was was was uh ordained to be in your class and now these are Christian women denominational they said and I and I said absolutely I believe every I said the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord because those teachers saw that child last year and they said that child they need to be in Jesse's class and they saw how I was handling that child now I'm not perfect here by any means but I just thought it was awesome two Christian women say it was really God's will that that child's in your class because you treat them in such a way and then my principal told me that he said I love how you always have that Joy on your face every day Jesse and I turned around him I said you know what principal now I'm not going to use his name but I said you know what principal I said I preach three times a week and all I do is get rehearsals about how much God loves me how I'm forgiven how I'm saved how could I not smile Hallelujah he's like you're right how could I not smile amen he just thanks me for having to smile all around the school amen and that's what that scripture tells me if I'm crucifying you know I'm fighting against sin every day right but as I keep sin under uh under my foot then I'm living so people at at my work they see me living I'm living for Jesus praise God I don't walk around like I'm a dead zombie you know like the Bible says you're you're dead while you're alive right those people those women that live in sin or men that live in sin you're dead while you're alive right but I but we are living through the Life of Christ so I was thankful this week to get two testimonies praise God hallelujah we're not debtors to the flesh we owe God all of our life all of our love all of our songs Hallelujah all of our worship all of our adoration you owe God we owe God all of our heart soul mind and strength so let's enjoy giving it to him praise God hallelujah praise God Amen I love it praise God now that gets into verse 14 so if you read the context of this God is telling us Paul's telling us through God's spirit that if we are crucifying sin if we're trying to overcome sin we are led by the spirit of God the spirit of God will lead you to mortify the Deeds of the Flesh and walk according to the spirit and as the spirit leads you to over overcome this sin or the spirit leads you to overcome that sin that proves you're led by the spirit of God Amen Hallelujah praise God that's that's the context right all these surrounding verses you you know we can pull one out that's true but if you but when you read it you actually get a richer a more Rich understanding of the context right so as we die to our fleshly desires and our sinful Desires in our flesh as we crucify that and live according to the spirit and Obey we are led by the spirit of God hallelujah and that makes us Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah the more obedience we have the more God is leading us hallelujah that's exactly what the scripture tells us hallelujah now and think about that remember we looked at we read this verse I think nature read it on Sunday but Jude verse4 and if you could pull that up there honey so many churches fail in this area they turn Grace into lusciousness they're not even really trying to call things things right and wrong you know the uh is that was that is that the right verse okay yes yeah it was condemnation they turned Grace into L remember remember Sunday night's Bible study you know we don't want to receive Grace in vain we want to receive Grace and it has an impact on us amen right and that will cause us to deny ungodliness amen hallelujah oh I love how the Bible just ties it all together Hallelujah see we're led by the spirit when Grace uh is turning in when Grace is is turning us into a more righteous person it's the spirit of God leading us to obey the word of God and crucify our desires Allelujah amen I love this that means we're the the we're led by the the spirit of God that means we are the sons and daughters of God Amen Hallelujah that means when I first got saved and I threw away all those Snoop Dog albums and Metallica that proved right there I was a Son of God hallelujah because the spirit would lead me to get rid of that trash right amen and since then you know I still I still get rid of things I still I still find God dealing with me in my life in different areas and stop doing this and stop doing that that is absolute proof I am a child of God you're a child of God hallelujah as as the Holy Spirit would make known not to sing Christmas songs right I mean sinful Christmas songs not good old hymns Hallelujah but that's a a good example of a revelation of God leading us to into all righteousness praise God and that proves you're a daughter of God that proves you're a son of God Hallelujah as he leads you into obedience to mortify the things of the flesh Hallelujah so that proves Church we're the bride Hallelujah like I said on that video 110 examples of why we're the bride that's one of them we have the true understanding of Grace leads us into obedience Grace leads us into Holiness now I'm G to try to like I said I want to make it through this chapter if I can by God's grace verse 15 now we're going to get review of a few major doctrines for ye have not receive the Spear of bondage again to fear now let's stop right there the Holy Ghost doesn't lead us into a slavery to dread or Terror now Church you know how many people are terrorized about Jesus's return think about that I'm talking about even Christians not only Sinners but how many Christians even message Believers are are terrified sorry are terrified about his return they're scared but we shouldn't be terrorized about it we should love it praise God I'm glad this water was up here I don't know who put this water up here but thank you actually going to have to drink it tonight so incredibly dry but the Bible said he comes to all them that love is appearing let me look up that verse uh Cas if you can beat me to it I'll give you a dollar no I'm just kidding Hallelujah I wouldn't pay you for I'll pay you in other ways Hallelujah um the scripture uh love is appearing I think it's in Timothy if I'm not not mistaken or maybe it's Titus yeah second Timothy 4:8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them that also love is appearing so I'm I'm you know I remember years ago remember brother amen and and and we were talking about uh videos YouTubers make and they have dreams and they're trying to scare people into the coming of the Lord and now there there's there is one verse where the bble says I believe it's in Jude where you should pull some out of the fire with fear so there is a small Ministry for that right but not every video not every experience not every day with God is fear fear fear and now look all these years later you know they had plenty of time to get ready right like the point of those videos is to get a clickbait right and they're trying they're trying to predict the day and hour no man knows the day or the hour Hallelujah not even Jesus knows the heavenly father Only Knows praise God so it show it shows now it shows now go back to Romans 8:15 it shows they were under that Spirit of bondage there's Christians that are under the spirit of bondage they live by fear oh God's Gonna blot my name out oh God's GNA get rid of me no of course not God won't do that because God loves you and you love God Hallelujah in other words you know you're a predestinated child of God hallelujah and you know you can't you can't lose your salvation because you know you really love God Amen Hallelujah I passed that a long time ago fearing my losing my salvation I passed that a long time ago I might might have battled that for a little bit but I passed it a long time ago you know why because we're going to get to it God G gives me witness after witness that I am a child of God Amen that's what the Bible says the spirit gives witness that we are the children of God hallelujah I know I'm a Child of God hallelujah and you know what we just need more witnesses of that Hallelujah and God will drive all that fear right out of our Lives amen I don't fear my name being blotted out because God's given me witnesses that I'm a Child of God hallelujah and just like brother R said even if I'm just I'm just the the skin on the bottom of the feet of the Bride I'm still a part of the body of Christ and I've still got every demon under my feet hallelujah praise God I might not be the head of Christ you I might not be the neck or the arms or the the the fingers but if I'm just at the feet I still have every demon power under my feet I'm still an overcomer praise God hallelujah amen I'm kind of jumping ahead but that's why this chapter is a beautiful chapter it's so rich in Mercy I just heard a preacher say it as well this I think it was Tim puit said that Romans 8 might be his F favorite Bible chapter I thought hey we got the same idea there we got the same uh inspiration from the Holy Spirit but ye have received see we haven't received fear if you received fear that wasn't from God and if you received it cast it down praise God Amen and receive this Hallelujah the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father so the Holy Ghost does not lead into lead us into constant dread or Terror of God right it doesn't lead us you know it leads us to crucify our flesh so we can walk in the spirit right and as we're walk in the spirit now we know we're the children of God because we've walked with God's spirit so much that we have so many witnesses that we are the children of God Amen Hallelujah like I just got a a brother from the UK this week he's like can I have your number I gave my telegram number and he pours out this 8 minute long video or uh audio about how he loves me and loves my Ministry and I'm called of God and keep doing what you're doing that's just another witness that I'm a Child of God people from over over the seas want to tell me how much they love me and we never even met I love that in other words God will give you witnesses that you're a child of God just surrender to him just walk in this Spirit and the spirit will testify to you amen don't you love that when God testifies to you God tells you who you are that's that's what we're getting to tonight that's what the Christian has God tells you who you are and even demons sometimes will tell you who you are right isn't that what brother BR brother BR had those two uh uh Sorcerers the fortune tellers tell him he was born under a sign right and then sometimes Church Sinners will tell you you're a real Christian Hallelujah is that right remember the woman with the remember the woman with the spirit of divination she said these men are the Servants of God they tell forth the word of God in truth oh I like it when even Devils have to tell you who you are amen hallelujah I love it when Sinners have to tell you you're a real Christian hallelujah amen I see if I never met another Christian I surely met one when I met you Hallelujah Glory thank God Amen see we've received the spirit of adoption and that means the relationship as a son or daughter of God whereby now notice what does this make you do it makes you cry out ABA father that's the personal Daddy it's kind of like Daddy Daddy it's the personal uh relationship to the father here let me uh pull up that actual verse then the ABA father because I haven't I forgot to look that one up today there it is okay Aba just means father the customary title used for God In Prayer so heavenly father so it's just it's just the common father so Daddy's or dad what do you call me dad now call me Daddy call me daddy nobody calls me Papa right so gotta stay with what the what's the customary title for Dad so I call my dad Dad hey Dad I sent him a text the other day love you Dad just saying hi he didn't reply but hopefully he read it hopefully it pops up on his iPhone but ye receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father Hallelujah so being a Christian doesn't lead you into torment and Dread and Terror it leads you into peace but it also leads you into following the spirit of God and overcoming sin in your members praise God and I'm just going to lay this in there you know yesterday I put out a video for this is a quote video brother brand said uh we should never name call other Christians right because he gives the example uh brandom Tabernacle people not everybody but some people in the church were calling another message Church Junior Jackson Church Dead Birds because they operated the gift differently so see you know we got to be careful and I I believe we got the right Spirit right I believe our church has the right Spirit but just a reminder if we've got the spirit of God let's be loving especially uh especially with other message churches right and that's really for me okay I'm preaching to me tonight right uh let's not call people dead birds and things like that but I want to say this if if someone's a a foolish virgin in a message Church their soul is is is dead as far as it hasn't been quickened to the fullness of the Holy Spirit right right because you got to be quickened Hallelujah you got to be your your Soul's got to be filled with this power of God hallelujah all right now now the true children of God will cry out now this word cry we we cry father this word cry means to cry aloud and speak with a loud voice now isn't that something doesn't mean like Lord I love you it's not a whisper it's a cry Hallelujah you got to lift up your voice now most now most of us lift up our voice sometimes here but if you don't hear you got to do it somewhere because that that's what the Bible says when you got the spirit of adoption you cry out to god father oh God Heavenly Father Lord God hear me Jesus right Hallelujah and that's where a lot of churches fail that don't believe in the Holy Ghost because they don't cry out to God they never raise their voice to God that's why brother said crying is important brother R said God loves to hear his children cry out to him Hallelujah right and so you know it's it's leoan uh we'd say make Believers that don't cry out because they don't have need of nothing right they're rich increased with Goods have need of nothing they don't have to cry out to God now think about that would you rather be that way where you never to cry out for your financial needs and the money never gets tight you never cry out to God or would you rather have it where sometimes money's kind of tight or you're sick and you got to cry out to God which one would you rather have I'd rather have the less money and crying out to God right because I mean that that's the condition of this age now here in America and many Western civilizations right and some of the E many of the Eastern one too especially China and Hong Kong they're in really good conditions financially but here this means we cry out to God we we cry we use a loud voice we have needs and so we got to cry out to our our father so when you receive the Holy Spirit it notice it's the spirit of adoption that's why I say anyone who's born again is already adopted you're already adopted you've already got it the Bible said you've received that's past tense and the church said if you remember first grade Ed means past tense because I taught that this year if it there an ed on the end of a word it already happened it's past tense you've received the spirit IR of adoption and that spirit makes you cry out to your father father hear me I need you I uh uh uh uh I don't know what to pray for Lord pray through me minister to your people help your people hallelujah but see the lean Spirit uh the lazy spirit will not allow people to cry out to God so we got to keep crying out to God hallelujah verse 15 we read that now this of course this adoption means the nature and condition of the true disciples in Christ who by receiving the spirit of God into their souls become sons of God all right now look at that you're led by the spirit of God when you're overcoming sin then you've got the spirit of adoption in you makes me makes you cry out and now verse 16 the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit notice a lowercase s that's your mind that's why I told you I'm it didn't believe it at first but now my mind is convinced sister who that I'm a Child of God I don't worry about going to hell anymore right I might have at some I don't even know if I did but at some point I might have wondered am I really a Believer or not but after all these years amen after all these years of having Witnesses of the Holy Spirit I know I'm a Child of God hallelujah amen and then the the Holy Spirit Bears witness with your mind that we are the children of God hallelujah every now and then we get somebody in here who thinks a child of God but maybe it turns out we don't know if they are I tell you I feel like everybody here now we know there's a child of God hallelujah why because we got witnesses we see God do things in their life move them by the Holy Spirit obey the word of God overcome uh experience the joy of the Lord experience the the love of God we see the fruits of the holy spirit in people's lives Hallelujah with with Christian interactions praise God even when we disagree we can do it with the love of Christ Hallelujah amen we got witnesses God gives a witness a testimony with our spirits that we are the children of God am amen so see church we have to have a witness or sign or some experience from the holy ghost that we are the children of God so let me ask you this has God ever shown you you're his child Hallelujah now that's blessings but it's also spankings has God ever rebuked you for we just gave an example right with the Christmas music has God ever rebuked you for doing something you shouldn't do and you turn it down real quick right or as soon as you could by God's grace because you're fighting a battle that that's a great question to ask Hallelujah and that's how you'll know you're a child of God when God gives you a witness you're my child so you can't act like those other people right you can't do that I'm not going to let you do that I'm going to convict you so hard until you repent amen hallelujah praise God I'm going to compel you I'm going to constrain you until you finally surrender Hallelujah and you mortify the Deeds of your flesh Hallelujah I won't won't let you get away with that Hallelujah and then you come out of that thank God I'm clean now I experience more joy in my life that's just another witness you're his child hallelujah amen that's right church has he ever shown you your his child of course he has Hallelujah and you got to cling to those you got to cling to those remember because the Satan's going to try to bring all these Witnesses you're not a child of God so you got to keep your spirit focus on those testimonies that you are a child of God right remember when you did that remember when you did that like they say when Satan reminds you of your past remind him of his future he gets tossed into the lake of fire thank God and all Heaven Will Rejoice Hallelujah when Lucifer gets cast in the Lake of Fire no more trials no more battles for us hallelujah amen so that's what we thank God for I thank God for witnesses that we are children of God you know I don't think I told my wife this but maybe I have but the more I live with my wife the more I know she's the daughter of God right I just I see it wow she's a real Christian I mean of course I always knew she was but what did I get I get more witnesses 20 years worth of witnesses she's a daughter of God she's a child of God because she loves the word of God she obeys the word of God Hallelujah verse 17 and if children I love this part you're going to like this part too then your heirs Hees of God and now I I ended one of the sermons with this thought and jooy hirs with Christ so as a wife as the wife of Christ you have some inheritance that other people won't have in heaven because they're not the wife right there's going to be Unix we know there's Unix uh I think brother amen was talking about that the 144,000 will be Unix the Bible says in Revelation the Bible said they'll be Unix unto God they won't be the bride they'll be Unix right Hallelujah the foolish virgin isn't the bride in the parable remember the foolish virgin were the the handmaids to the bride but they they never made it they never made it to the wedding ceremony right so they they were not in the wedding ceremony there's no way they can be the bride right you got to be there the bride is going to be at her wedding reception praise God the bride is going to be at her wedding ceremony Church she don't get locked out if that man loves her he's going to be there to open the door himself he'll beat down in the door do whatever to get that bride in amen that's his love he Delights in her amen like Simon said there's only one that's my dove that's my undefiled she's beautiful from head to toe praise God he'll do anything in his power to get that bride in there so see Church you and I get rewards as the bride other people will not get now now remember don't forget this if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together so here we get the idea we must suffer in order to inherit and if you've been a Christian long enough you've suffered through some form of persecution whether it's neglect being kicked out of your house made fun of lied on right I've had many I've had numerous of those Hallelujah mocked your name drugged through the the dirt I get that a lot on on the internet let them do whatever they want cuz I know my name is not going in the mud I know my name is in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah he why because he gave me Witnesses of it praise God he show he's testified to me amen just like God testified to the devil you know God testifies to each one of us that we are the children of God hallelujah amen I believe God lets everybody know which side they're on I just I never had that thought before till right now didn't uh uh didn't uh well when did Judas find out he was a son of predition was that while he was alive or after oh yeah Jesus told him you're the betrayer that's right that's right Jesus told him you'll betray me see he knew he knew right Cain knew right God told Cain you're going to be a werer I'm driving you from my presence is that right so I believe amen I believe you're going to get Witnesses one way or the other let's get the witness from the holy spirit that we are the children of God hallelujah amen and then the Bible says then you've also remember don't forget this the Bible said you've got to prove which side you're on make your calling an election sure amen hallelujah in other words you can't get lazy church I want to preach a sermon on that all those scriptures from the Old Testament where the Bible said once Israel got uh the Bible said when they got fat which means when they got rich and food they forgot about God I going to preach just a whole Sermon Just it's a simple layer to see in sermon but I just want to remind us we got to make sure we don't get lazy on God Amen right just a a humble reminder right I'm not saying we are I don't think you are if you're lazy you wouldn't go to the church you wouldn't pray you wouldn't sing but it just it just it struck me the other day wow like that just struck me aresh that's going to be our battle to Satan's going to try to make us lazy but we can't be lazy we must be diligent we must prove to the enemy Hallelujah we must prove to the enemy that God's given us Witnesses praise God that we are the children of God but remember before Glory you must have suffering so this world has blessings and benefits and Witnesses but it's also it's also a witness to suffer for Christ's name that's also a witness we must have from the holy spirit because it says it right there in verse 17 if you want to be a joint air you must suffer like the your husband suffered and church many times we see this when people are dying they're suffering and you know the devil's saying you need to recant God don't want to heal you but see you overcome that people overcome that by saying I'm a Christian and if I must suffer this way I'll go that way remember Elisha had to suffer that way Elisha had an awful disease whereby he died right and he had to go that way had to go the way of suffering right brother Braham got to go just you know no doubt he suffered but a lot of it he was unconscious from the car accident you know but everybody has a different way remember brother James Browning uh I talked about him you know he said Lord he he prayed Lord I don't want to suffer when I die but he didn't which was it was a wonderful testimony to God's grace but he suffered more during the Lifetime right like longer years of suffering so whatever suffering God has for us we must accept it praise God and we'll overcome through it praise God and we must remember this is what's what's helping us to achieve the glory which we will receive Hereafter praise God this suffering is producing Christlike character Jesus learned obedience through the S things he suffered the bride will learn obedience through the things she suffers amen right how many can say Amen the the things you've learned many times we learn through suffering we have to lose something we have to uh experience a loss we have to experience a disappointment and that will keep us on the right path longer right more faithful more diligent Hallelujah so don't forget that this remember this is a chapter of great promises no condemnation all things work together but don't forget this you must suffer in order to be glorified together oh it's always that wonderful balance praise God hallelujah don't forget the balance of yes we have victories and testimonies but we must also have the testimony of suffering Verse 18 for I reckon which means calculate Verse 18 I calculate that the sufferings of this present are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us hallelujah so inheriting Eternal rewards with Christ is easily greater it can be calculated it's easier greater than temporary sufferings right you can calculate that Hallelujah and how can you calculate it uh let's list some of the rewards for the joint heirs we get eternal life the Bible says Jesus said I'll share my glory with them in John 17:22 can you pull that up John 17:22 while you're turning there I'm going to go to Second Corinthians 68 let's look at a little list of uh joint I'm sorry of specific rewards some of them will be of course a review got that one yeah and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are what did he do with the glory he gave you the glory I remember when I was I'm always going to use sister H because she's on the front row but I remember when the glory fell on her that day she got the Holy Ghost and that Glory just keep building in your life sister Hallelujah right in case you've ever all the time the glory falls on you right he shares his glory with you praise God God Amen anytime somebody says they enjoyed my sermon the glory did it not me Hallelujah it was the glory it wasn't me I there's no glory in me as far as my own human flesh but it's God's glory and Jesus said I give them the glory that's a reward Hallelujah the glory amen also you get riches 2 Corinthians 88:9 for we know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich so you get spiritual riches and I'll go as far as saying you'll get natural riches later as well what I mean is like a home in the Millennium future home in the uh you actual home in the future home right the pyramid uh the the the New Jerusalem you get a home in the New Jerusalem Hallelujah and then you get uh you get the rule nations with the rod of iron we don't have to read these this these are the ones I I preached many times Revelation 226 and 27 wow that's a that's a going air right because we know Christ has a rod right Christ has a rod of iron he says you get a rod of iron if you overcome Glory praise God then you get to rule cities in Luke 19:17 you get to rule a city Hallelujah you might never be mayor here but you might be mayor over there by God's grace and I'd rather rule over there praise God because it's just chaos over here hallelujah you'll have the power of obedience over there Hallelujah you another reward you get you get accepted in the Beloved so the bosom of Heaven you are accepted in the bosom of Heaven they're not going to turn you away Saints you're a part of that bosom Hal you're part of the love of God hallelujah because you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world I'm accepted in heaven amen Heaven won't turn me away Jesus won't say I never knew you he'll say I've accepted you Hallelujah here's a place for you in heaven Hallelujah you get one or two crowns either the martyr's crown in Revelation 2:10 or the Crown of Life or crown of righteousness as James 1 vers2 says you get a crown because you're a joint Heir well remember Jesus comes back with many crowns in Revelation 19 Hallelujah but see you are joint Heir you got a crown and then you get a white robe Revelation 79 the voice said uh do you know know who this is John said I don't know who this is this is the bride from every nation Kindred tongue and and and people and language Hallelujah and they're all dressed in Robes of white hallelujah amen so now I can picture I can picture Malachi he's got a nice robe on it's pure white it's not off-white it's pure white it's got a crown and if Lord darries he can have more jewels in that crown for winning Souls Hallelujah his music can already cast out devils you ever come to church upset and the music Set You Free well that was God using his gift Hallelujah that's right that's what David did it as well praise God it drives away the the discouraging spirit amen it drives away that depression Spirit it drives it away in the name of Jesus Hallelujah and then now you got your crown you got your white robe and then the last thing now this I only had a little bit of time to find this but the last thing on the list was a throne the Bible said Thrones were given them in judgment so wow not only does Jesus have a throne you have a throne Hallelujah some people like to build their Throne right now but don't worry about building a throne now you let Jesus build you one later praise God right don't make yourself a fancy Throne at your house you know but save it for later because we said it on Sunday the Saints will judge the earth and the Saints will judge Angels remember that Queen think about this church by I just thought of this that's simple it's simple the queen of the South will judge all the people that lived a thousand years after her and she never even met them now what does that mean that means you and I may judge people we've never met because just because of our sacrifice God will need a witness and he'll raise up the queen of South he'll raise up Sister Zer he'll raise up Sister haa raise up Sister AAA I'll use all the sisters now and you you might God might use your life to judge somebody who had a same Ty type of experience but you overcame they didn't why because you followed the leading of the spirit of God Amen praise God Amen now think about I think it'll be many of our high school friends is I think that's what I think you know you know because we're around them all the time but then they heard about all how we got saved or maybe some people that used to be in our churches but now remember the queen of the South it was her great sacrifice to travel so far that's why I think God might bless CA that way too and Vang they traveled very far see people might have said well I'll just marry somebody close and they might have married the wrong person I'm talking about a sinner right but vang's like I'm not gonna marry just anybody maybe he's smiling right now he he was willing to go to any lengths Hallelujah that but that's his testimony that's going to be his testimony praise God amen and pay the doy right well I couldn't pay that I'm not going to pay that for a wife I'll just marry so and so well see God's got to have somebody who went the right route who did righteousness and God will raise them up and they'll be robed in right white how have they'll sit on a throne and they'll have a crown on their head Hallelujah joint HS with Christ hallelujah oh that ought to make a Baptist shout hallelujah amen but it can't because well it might but they won't be in the bride unless they come out of that Baptist theology they got to come out of that Baptist theology now Romans 8:19 for the earnest expectation that means the anxious persistent expectation okay of the creature now they're speaking of nature now animals and plants I imagine mostly animals because they have some type of emotion right they have some type of spirit it waits for the manifestations of the sons of God God right Hallelujah so the glory is so great that's going to be revealed in us uh there's currently a anxiousness on nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now there's two thoughts to this and I'll tell you which one I stand on some people say the manifestation of the sons of God is the squeeze right when we really get the third pole on us now I don't don't really believe that I believe we already are manifested sons of God right I already believe that and you know why because of this chapter we'll get to it because the Bible tells us when these sons are going to be manifested right and I even saw brother Ram stopped saying it after about about 1961 he stopped using this this way where the the the squeeze was going to be the manifested sons of God I believe we already are manifested aren't you manifesting Christ on your job aren't you Daughters of God manifesting Christ aren't you a Son of God manifesting God's love yes absolutely I'm already manifesting God's love now will there be a fullness of Pentecost in the bride yes that's Joel 2 23- 26 that's what the Bible says hallelujah all the years that were lost will be restored back amen all the years of Lost in the book of Acts it'll be restored back right before the Rapture praise God hallelujah I believe that amen but notice cre the creature the animal kingdom is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God okay now go down to verse 23 because this verse is what proves the manifestation of the sons of God is when we get new bodies it's the fullness of the adoption that's what it's waiting for right because right now men what do they do they destroy nature right they go hunting they kill animals or whatever you know they just creation is in a is in a difficult spot it's in an anxious spot right it's not in a it's not a it's not a happy spot right uh 23 not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body so see nature is waiting for the adopted sons and then the Bible says we we're waiting for the adopted Sons the fullness of adoption okay and when do we get the fullness of adoption when we get a brand new body Hallelujah okay okay now go back to verse 19 I'll read it again for the earnest expectation the anxious expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God now we already are sons of God 1 John 32 says beloved now are we the sons of God everybody say now now we are okay uh Galatians 4:6 says because ye are Sons you already are you've already got the spirit of adoption I already got the spirit that I'm a Son of God right you've got the spirit you're a daughter of God I got the spirit that tells me that but the final part of adoption doesn't happen until I get a new body hallelujah amen now verse 20 Romans 820 thank you casa good job we'll go back to that verse a little bit for the creature was made subject to vanity or fraility okay so animal nature Kingdom it's frail not willingly they didn't want that animals didn't want that who plunged animals into that Adam and Eve right but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope right by reason of Adam and Eve but notice There's Hope Hallelujah There's Hope amen although Nature's groaning although we're groaning there is hope Hallelujah in other words there's coming a new creation hallelujah hallelujah praise God he said behold I make all things new Hallelujah what is that hope it's the Millennium and the future home praise God Amen Hallelujah Romans 821 because the creature itself shall also be delivered so see now we know when the manifestation of the sons of God is when the creatures delivered from the bondage of corruption when are animals going to stop corrupting when eternal life sets in so probably the future home right because the Bible makes it look like a child may die a hundred years old in the Millennium that's what it looks like in Isaiah 65 if I'm not mistaken or 66 one of those so that well if it looks like a child could die maybe an animal could die in the Millennium but I know some of them are going to live a thousand years right they won't have to die so it looks like uh when is when is the creature delivered from corruption no longer dying it would have to be the future home right and when do they deliver Church into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God verse 22 tells us for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now so all of creation is groaning humans animals right the whole nature it's groaning it wants to have a state where it's no longer corrupted praise God but the Bible says your soul is Born Again by The Incorruptible word of God Amen so your soul is Incorruptible praise God you that's why you're already adopted in the family of God you've already got the spirit of adoption Hallelujah because the Bible said you're born again with The Incorruptible word of God hallelujah oh my verse 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits so see we got the first fruits of the spirit amen our soul is filled with the Holy Spirit but guess what our mind needs filled with the Holy Spirit I mean permanently and then your body is going to be led by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah when you get a glorified body amen so see we we just got the first fruits we just got the filling of it now in the soul but it it's it's going to extend to a perfect mind and then a perfect body hallelujah amen even we ourselves grown within ourselves so he says we're groan now that means we're not delivered from corruption right now waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body okay so we already have the spirit of adoption but we're waiting for the finality of adoption which is a brand new body when I got all three parts of the Holy Spirit can I say it like that I got a fullness of the holy ghost in my soul I got a fullness of the holy ghost in my mind and I got a fullness of the holy spirit in my body hallelujah amen a't that beautiful I love Paul's writings It's So Glorious uh Romans 8:24 for we are saved by hope right faith hope charity these three right we're hoping we have hope is a good thing right but hope that is seen is not not hope okay so we can see it it's not hope right we're not hoping for the message of the hour we already see the message of the hour we know the Lord Jesus Christ baptism we know God's one person we're not hoping for that we got that hallelujah we're hoping for a brand new body Hallelujah right and we got we have that Living Hope for what a man seeth why do you yet he hoped for right so if we see it already it's not hoping hoping is what we don't see verse but if we hope for that we see not then we do with patience wait for so so so Paul tells us be patient for the adoption be patient for a brand new body don't get impatient be patient for it praise God all right now brother Braham tells us now go back to Galatians 4:6 if you don't remember this this is in the church age book brother Braham says uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost must not come from you or me he said it must come according to the Bible it must be thus sayith the Lord his first verse is Acts 19 1-7 how he said Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said we didn't even know there was a holy ghost he's showing you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul but then brother R he ends that section by saying let me give you the triumphal Capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah this is it right here so this is the Caps I wish I had a cap well I got a cap right here so cap so this verse is the cap on the filling of the Holy Ghost that works out pretty good Hallelujah this verse is the cap because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father in other words God always knew you were a son God always knew you were his daughter and he capped It Off by giving you the Holy Ghost amen he capped It Off by giving you that witness the Holy Ghost is in your soul you've got an Incorruptible part of God you've got the Living God you've got the fire of God in your soul hallelujah oh my oh that's juicy Hallelujah that's real good Hallelujah that's delicious amen come and dine the master cth come and dine Hallelujah like brother BR said chew on that for a little bit regurgitate that and chew on that chew that cud for a little bit oh that's good because you are a daughter of God that's why God could give you the Holy Ghost that's the cap on it that's just finish it right there that's why you got it because he always knew you'd have it Hallelujah I'm GNA take a little drink here all right verse 26 8:26 likewise so in the same the same way the spirit also helps our infirmities so you ever been uh have an infirmity have a weakness and the Holy Spirit will help you with your weakness right sometimes we're weak and we we doubt we fear we lust we're prideful we're arrogant we're critical we're emotionally angry with sinning we can be angry and sin not but sometimes we're angry and we sin but what does the Holy Spirit do he helps us with our infirmities Allelujah or if we're sick he helps heal our bodies praise God if we know not what we should pray for as we ought see sometimes we don't know which way does God want us to pray but the spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered now I don't even know honestly what that means uh I just know the spirit must it must groan within us or the spirit must somehow groan in a Heavenly realm also I can think of is Daniel praying and the Angels were fighting to bring him the answer that's all I can think of right because if it can't be uttered then you can't hear it right if there if the spirit is is making intercession for us and it can't be uttered then we can't hear it so it's either a conversation with the angels a conversation between God and the Jesus and the Angels or God and Jesus even right I don't know if if God talks like that to Jesus separately I don't know but the Bible said that the father is above the son right father son man woman remember that from 1 Corinthians 11 but here the Bible said the spirit makes intercession for us and remember Jesus is the high priest he's the intercessor for us Jesus Will intercede for us with groanings which cannot be uttered so it either means Heavenly groanings or it's a groaning in us that we can't even utter maybe that's it maybe there's something on the inside of us we feel but we just don't even know how to express it maybe that's it but I that's just a scripture I've never quite understood but but the point is this the spirit helps us when we don't know what to do and the spirit helps us when we have infirmities so our sick friends may God hallelujah may God intercede for our sick friends and family members praise God May the spirit make intercession for them in their infirmities Hallelujah I know when I was sick my wife come up and prayed for me oh yeah and then I I forgot too uh a friend out in Minnesota heard I was sick and they prayed for me I believe that's part of the reason I got well so fast I was only sick uh what is he what wasn't even uh well maybe a day and a half I was sick maybe 36 hours and he was he was surprised he said are you well I said yes I'm well he was surprised I got well well I don't know I mean I got people in Minnesota praying for me I my wife praying for me I'm sure my children prayed for me I didn't tell many people I was sick I didn't even ask the church to pray for me because I'm like ah I don't I don't want to bother them you know I already had people praying for me I don't want to bother anybody but but here the spirit will help with our infirmities I got to listen to some good sermons while I'm laying there on the bed with that that blaring headache you know all day I got to listen to some good sermons got some good thoughts verse 27 and he that searches the hearts the holy spirit that must be the spirit of God knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God now that looks like it's Jesus the spirit of Jesus perhaps the logos all right so it's clear Saints for us it is all about the will of God may God help us to understand it's not about our will it's about God's will because the spirit is only going to make intercession on God's will now will there be times God gives people over to their own will yes like balam remember God will give people their own will sometimes if if they're reprobate and even God will give over a believer like Hezekiah God gave him the permissive will of God but we should we should pray and say Lord let your spirit only do your will in my life in other words let's not beg God for what we want let's beg God for what he wants praise God like brother said prayer is to change our minds not to change God's mind do you know that brother had a quote like that see and that that shows brother raham grew brother Ram grew and said he said prayer could change the mind of God earlier but later he says that now prayer is to change our mind not God's mind Hallelujah I need to make a video on that I do want to do that video because it it deals with Divine Healing brother ramam grew so much in his understanding on Divine Healing by the end he said you must first find the will of God and that's what I'm I'm thankful for church I'm thankful the holy spirit makes intercession on the will of God hallelujah let God's will be done not our will pardon me now I'm almost done verse 28 and we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose see now if you know verse 27 that God's going to do according to the will of God then you can surely believe verse 28 all things work together for good because I wanted God's will to be done in other words I didn't beg God for my what I wanted I didn't beg God uh to change his will so I could have the per will of God like Hezekiah or like uh bam and I'm not bashing Hezekiah he was a mighty man I'm just saying we should learn from those things and we all sometimes want our way you don't have to say Amen you can say out if you want but you know we all we all want our way sometime even brother Jesse ouch you know and we've all got to say Lord forgive me let me just have your will amen but see anyone that accepts verse 27 I want God's will I want according to the spirit of God then I know all things in my life will work together for good because I love God it all worked together for good well I never got that principal job I never made all that money but that was all for my good because I realized later you got to work like a dog and you make less money per hour did you know that I learned that later so I learned oh all things work together for good I'd rather make more per hour than have all this vacation time spend it with my family and spend it with God preach the word of God study and spend time with the holy spirit amen it worked together for good now when I was going through it I was really disappointed well how am I going to supp supply for my family well guess what God makes a better way praise God you see so just and that's that's very simp that's a very simple thing maybe not even a big deal but it could have got out could have got me out of the perfect will of God it could have per put me in the permissive will of God where I wouldn't have enough time to do what God called me to do in fact I know I wouldn't have enough time you know why cuz I saw my uh principal's uh email today guess how many new emails he got just today now this was at 9:00 amm this morning guess how many emails 489 I'm like thank you Lord I got 10 emails today praise God I rather have that and church he's got to go through all those it's required by the the law well not by law but by the Board of Education you got to return every email within one day you if not they're going to get mad at you now they won't fire you but you're getting lazy if you don't return it by one day see Saints all things work together for good to them that love the Lord I don't want to do 489 emails verse 29 let's finish with this for whom he did Forno didn't the Bible say you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world God knew you before you got here church God knew all about you he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son denominations are not making Christians into the image of Christ because they let them sin they let them they don't suffer for being a Christian there's no there's no uh there's no pain for being a Christian right but you and I God fornew us and he predestined he predetermined the bounds of your habitation he predetermined the bounds of where you could go and what you could do to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren Hallelujah so now we getting to predestination we get into adoption the will of God all things work together for good and now he gets into I know my life is predestinated I know God sent me here to akan Hallelujah I know he sent you here praise God God he had to he had a predestinated plan and he knew by sending you to akan he knew that the word of God would change you to be more like Christ more so than if you had been in another place because God determines the steps of your habitation God determines where you go and where you don't go God determine that and then Jesus was the first born among many Brethren but you are are one of the born Brethren Hallelujah you're one of the many Brethren who've been born of the Holy Spirit who've been born with the spirit of adoption whereby you cry out to God ABA father amen that makes you cry out to God because you're a born child of God hallelujah I said it wrong born I shouldn't put a d on the end born child of God verse 30 it's 8 o'clock so I'm finishing up almost at my hour you've been a good audience very very very lovely very kind moreover whom he did P I'm sorry predestinate them he also called that means elected or chosen so if God predetermined KN fornew you in his mind then he predestined predestinated all the events of your life then in time he called you he chose you and then he justified you he declared you righteous Hallelujah and whom he justified if he declared you righteous he he's already glorified you Hallelujah and this is the order of predestination Hallelujah for knowledge predestination election calling Hallelujah predestination I'm sorry justification and then glorification hallelujah this is the order if anybody ever tells you predestination ain't the Bible it's right there and it gives you the exact order God for fornew you predestinated you he elected you he called you he justified you and then he will glorify you he'll give you that white robe Hallelujah never got to worry about getting stains on it right he'll give you that crown of righteousness that Crown of Life that fits your head just perfectly not too heavy either Hallelujah he's already glorified you now church with this thought glorified it's got that D on the end that means it's already happened think about that church he's already glorified you it's already in his mind here here's the Earth here's the universe in time God's already outside of that and he's got his books he's got his L Book of Life he's got a book of life and he's already glorified you you're already glorified in the mind of God that's why God could tell Jeremiah I've already ordained you a prophet to the Nations I already know I'm going to send you to the Nations and I'm going to form you in your mother's womb I'm going to give you a prophet's human spirit so you can see Visions you can know thus sayth the Lord amen and church I mean know it in a really powerful way brother Braham had the the prophet gift in a powerful way but he never wrote a book of the Bible in other words not I mean he didn't have all these words in a row like Jeremiah had church can you imagine how many chapters was in Jeremiah Isaiah had 66 chapters Isaiah had this prophet's mind where he heard every single word of thus sayith the Lord and then wrote it down brother Braham wasn't brother Braham had those but he didn't have have that specific gift to write down entire books of the Bible think of that different different Prophet gifts now different Prophet gifts a prophet gift to write every single thing down now the closest brother I'm got remember was pick up your pen and write in 1962 and he said I just started writing that's the closest we got but we can't add that to the Bible because the Bible said you can't add to it or take away it's just a prophecy to encourage the people okay just a and it it actually really points back to Genesis 1 with the seed the spoken word is Original Seed all right and this is why God told the the devil job is perfect he was a sinner saved by grace but God was already looking at him with predestination this man's already glorified amen this man's already Justified this man's already predestinated he's already called he's already for known uh you can test him I know he's going to pass the test because I've already finished it already glorified hallelujah it's already happened in my mind I already chose him I already know it's going to happen praise God that's why God can let you go through sufferings because you're already chosen in the mind of God you're already perfect in the mind of God the Bible said you've got a theophany there Hallelujah that the Bible says is eternal created in the heavens already it's already perfect it's always been perfect it always will be perfect Hallelujah God didn't mean job was sinless God knew job's sin but God meant job was a Son of God who had a perfect theophany he was going to enter into praise God and the Bible said the face of those theophanies always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven so as I said before there's some area in heaven there's there's Angels there's the 24 Elders there's some area where those theophanies are all in the presence of God somehow I don't can't explain that remember there's levels of heaven right right there's the third heaven there's under the altar there's above there's some place where the Bible said Jesus said their Angels do always behold the face of my Father in heaven now that's either theophany or their guardian angel now that now that I'm preaching it it seems like the guardian angel but the Bible says we have houses not made with hands Eternal in the heavens in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and this is why God could say job is perfect because God said you're already glorified it's already happen and that's why brother Ram could say this and uh let's stand the musicians can come I'll read this quote and I'll be done brother Braham said what you have to do with a tree you got to take the tree and plant it in the ground and then have have you water it as you water it it doesn't do nothing but drink drink drink it has to drink more than its portion and the more it drinks the bigger it swells up it pushes out limbs it pushes out leaves it pushes out blossoms then it pushes out apples is that right and that's the way a Christian is we're planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we have need of for our Earthly J Journey Divine Healing the power of God all these other things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you're planted in Christ Hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you need of for this life's journey even the Rapture is right in you then praise God so once a person gets the Holy Ghost everything that you have need of is in you already that's what brother R says just like an apple tree all those apples are already in that seed every little apple is already in that seed right everything you have need of is in the seed of God that's in your soul just got to water it I love these simple illustrations it's so powerful I know we've heard it before but let's let's let's enjoy it aesh tonight by God's grace brother R said' don't resent that that's the truth the Rapture is in us now I'll prove it by the gospel and guess which verse he proves Romans 8 he said those who he's called he's Justified and those he justified he hath glorified he said Hallelujah then in heaven today in heaven today let's all say today today in heaven today we're in a glori we're glorified in the presence of God right now he said I'm just pushing out here on Earth in glory he said amen glory God's in his word do you believe it how many believe that tonight by God's grace in heaven I'm already in a glorified condition I've got a theophany I've got a I got a glorified body waiting for me but here I just got to push out and the spirit of God that's in me will produce everything in my life that I have need of Hallelujah how many appreciate the god the word of God tonight tonight amen let's bow our heads here father God we thank you for tonight thank you for the patience of the people Lord God as we read here Lord we're groaning along with the the
