the the burden of feeling like I've never preached before I can be free because I always had a burn like how come I haven't felt led to preach on the church ages well I got a preach of Church ages but now I can be free from that amen preached it I believe faithfully by the grace of God Revelation 3:8 let's read that verse together Cerreta on three one two three I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer let's go before the Lord here tonight again one more time Heavenly Father Lord we have not denied your name we've kept your name we have your strength o God we've kept your word you've opened a door for us in Akron we're so grateful for it no God no man can shut this door because it was your mighty hand that opened this door in Akron we're grateful for it Lord it's the door of Jesus Christ the revelation of yourself dear God I'm so thankful you've opened it to me Lord God I don't deserve it I did not earn it but you gave it by your grace and you've gave it to this church Lord and for that I just say thank you again

said Amen god bless you mean seated praise God Meraki good when you're ready alright so we'll look here to the Lord tonight I think I'll finish the open door thought tonight I think I'll finish that and then I think I'll move on then finish prime finish it maybe Sunday night Lord willing by God's grace I'm trying to think there's anything going on this Sunday I think we'll be all set also one more announcement I finished the giving statement so I'll pass it on Sunday all the giving statements you can take that to your accountant and write off your your giving if you'd like to do that you know you don't have to but I can save a little money on your taxes the government lets us do that so anyways we'll pass those out on Sunday by the grace of the Lord okay let's look at the final thoughts here on the open door and we'll you know one of the brothers on Sunday night after I preached Sunday morning I just preached Sunday morning on Sunday night one of the brothers I preached the first part another brother and three brothers preached on Sunday night from 7:30 to midnight and the second brother preached on the open door afterwards I thought well that's just fitting that's just fitting because that's what we're looking at at home by God's grace I want to just go through this here I want to try to make this as fresh as possible Jesus said I've set before thee an open door brother Branham said I want to look at these words again this time I'm not going to disassociate them from missions I'm gonna bring you a thought which carries deep into the last age and this is the thought of the Godhead as Jesus Christ being God this is the thought he's gonna get into just so to prepare you for tonight it's on the Godhead he kind of ends his teaching about the open door with the Godhead as I've already stated this age melts into the last age it was this age Jesus said I come quickly and the last age he was going to finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth in that striking God this is in Romans 9 this struck me I had to look that up I was like is that in the scripture it seemed like I'd forgotten that Scripture but it's a right in Romans 9 the Bible said God is gonna cut their work short and it's gonna be a short work upon the earth we feel like it's just been taken so long for Jesus to come back but Jesus said the Bible said one day with man one day with God's like a thousand days of man so Jesus we know is that about there's about six thousand years of human history now we know brother Bama there might have been millions and billions of years before humans were placed upon the earth we know we don't know but as far as human history it's only been six days with the Lord and so he says I'm gonna cut it short it's gonna be a short work upon the earth don't you look forward to one day church where this earth will be burned over only righteousness will dwell here it'll seem like these days we're just a fond memory yours was fine as far as salvation but sin there'll be nothing find about sin but we'll be able to remember all oh my we were saved by grace we'll be singing about the blood all throughout eternity amen the blood of Jesus but it's a short work this is really a short age it's just even a even our short age of labor to see it was also a short span of time just six thousand years very small in there in the scope of eternity and I says notice how this verse of Revelation 3a goes open door little strength word name that open door has to do with all three now what does the door signify now I'm gonna just a break that I'm just breaking this down a little bit okay so brother Branham said the open door deals with your a little bit of strength so the open door gives you a little strength the open door gives you the word because you don't deny his word and then the open door helps you not deny his name so see the strength word a name all go together amen that's what the prophets trying to say here so he says first what is the open door signify again you're familiar with this but he goes over it again so I thought well I better go over it again too by the grace of the Lord john 10:7 says then said jesus unto them verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep that is right I am is the door of the Sheep now that is not just a quaint expression that's exactly so reg actually so notice in John 10 when Jesus giving this parable he calls himself the Shepherd then he calls himself the door and that is what the Shepherd is to the Sheep he is actually their door so program now tells the story about when he went out east he was over in the east and he saw at nighttime the Shepherd would gather all sheep together he would put them in the phone then he would count them he was sure that they were all in he would lie down in the open door of the fold and literally become the door to the fold no one could get out or in or out except by him he was the door he got that picture in your mind he would gather all the sheep in and count each one and then he would lay down and become the door that is that how I feel as a pastor I look out on Wednesday night who's here we're missing so and so because I love them Sunday morning who's not here oh my it spent two Sundays in a row they're not here what do you start feeling you start feeling a burden for the souls if you lost your pet how would you feel I don't really we don't know I guess we have a few pets but they're not really dear to me but if you had pets that were dear to you and you lost them or didn't know where they were you'd be really concerned right and so that's how the Shepherd is the shepherd is concerned he wants to make sure every single sheep is okay amen because he is the door the next day as he said now he tells the second part about shepherds this is the first story about shepherds now he gives the second part I like this one too the next day we went riding with a friend in the Jeep I noticed the Shepherd began to lead his flock into the city ride away all the traffic came to stop so the Sheep could go through now the city's over in the east aren't like they are here we keep our merchandise inside but there's like a big farmers market with all the produce on the pavement for pasture buyers buy to see and buy and I thought oh my here is where the riot begins so brother Brahim thought these sheep would just jump on the tables you know and start feasting on all this outdoor food way to those sheep see all that food out there but I thought it riots gonna happen he says but as the Shepherd went ahead though sheep just followed right along exactly in each step they would look at all those goodies but not a sheep touched a thing oh if I could only have known their language I would have stopped traffic myself and preached them a sermon on what I had just seen and here's what the sermon would have been when your sheep that belonged to the great Shepherd you follow right along with each of his steps just as those sheep did you won't be tempted to turn aside for some big flower of a church or listen to the voice of some DD or PhD or lld but you will stay with the Shepherd the Bible says the sheep know his voice and they follow him but a stranger's voice will only cause him to flee and run after their true Shepherd but RAM said praise God so look at Russia p-- runs after Christ the word the true Shepherd how many understand that Satan tries to tempt people away from true preaching by offering them a nicer looking Church how many know that that's a brother I'm saying here huh me know Satan tries to to draw real sheep of God away from real preaching by using up more educated preacher or a preacher who's got a doctor's degree that's what the prophets saying here there it's like the food on the table they passed by and they're tempted to jump on those goodies but a real truce people be able to overcome that temptation and follow right in line with the steps of the Shepherd amen and I love that a strangers voice will only cause them to run after the true Shepherd amen I like that because you know a real true child of God whenever there's a temptation and they're struggling eventually they'll get victor over that and they'll run themselves right back to where God wants them to be amen they're not going to run away from the voice of God the voice of the shepherd they're gonna run to the voice of the shepherd and when you have trouble what should you do you should run to prayer praise God when you're sick or tired or don't feel like I'm gonna church you should run to church because that's what the sheep of God do they follow in the footsteps of the Shepherd it's exactly right something felt like I was gonna stay on the previous slide but then I wish I thought I would have said there huh I think I'll get to it eventually I'll just trust the Holy Spirit will bring it out by the grace of the Lord all right now look at the scripture here here's the scripture I wanted to get to but as that was because the Bible said as the beloved of God we must flee from idolatry so anything that becomes more important than the preaching anything that becomes more important than prayer anything that tries to exalt itself above the Word of God is an idol most of time invested churches the the biggest idols are things that come up in people's homes temptations like you know TV you know apps internet you know sports whatever children's needs well you know children's ball games or whatever movies you name it usually from what I've seen and what I preach you know over in Iowa now in North Carolina usually what I've seen is that the idolatry starts in the home the parents start putting idols above the Word of God and then when they compromise then they let children compromised because it's a compromising spirit that spirits on the parents that when when the parents compromise that spirit just hops off onto the children right and church you should have saw on Sunday morning the pastor the children my children saw the pastor I preached everything I preached here about Netflix pornography I just preached the same things that I preach here I put the same sermon from the red heifer to the holiest of Holies I preached that they're the same thing I preached in Iowa and brother Tim we had a prayer line going and he stopped the service he's a brother Jesse I feel led to change the direction of the service so he told the people pray and he said just come up to the altar he said I'm calling the whole church up for prayer the whole entire church came up and we prayed maybe for 20 minutes and people were screaming and yelling out loud and he was cursing all these demons in people's homes the movies and the sexy clothes and and the pornography he just went on and cursing all these demons that people are screaming and crying and shouting and it was powerful so what I've come to know is that idolatry is compromised message people are compromising and letting idols start in the home it won't be in the church you and I are not gonna sit and worship this picture you and I are not gonna where's brother bands books I don't have any here you and I are not going to bow down to brother branham's books that's not the idolatry that's gonna catch someone who's sincere it's going to be more deceptive than that and it's going to be idolatry in their home and we're how does that usually happen any time you see the word is not the most important thing and idols come in and that's why I've got a labor on church attendance and preaching of the word heat you know live streaming hearing the word trying to catch the vision of our church if everybody could catch that oh my we'd be doing more for the kingdom of God we'd see more miracles we'd see more soul saved if we can all just catch the vision of God but we got to catch it we got a we got to catch it but what is its idolatry and just like brother BAM said the sheep when they had all these goodies around them and look Church you've got goodies all over your phone if you want to write you could try to make more money on your phone they're good there's temptations that do it more business and try to make just got to compromise on the word a little bit just got a just got a sale you know just got to start selling makeup or you know just any compromise I just got a I just you know we got to give up Wednesday night service and you got to try to make some more money you know and there's all kinds of there's all kinds of goodies out there but the real sheep of God stay focused on the shepherd and just like the sheep run away from the goodies the Christian runs away from sin they flee from any temptation that's idolatry that's exactly right so the scripture says there wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall how many feel like you're standing for Jesus pretty strong right now this is one of the most I've ever felt strongest right now is right now because of what I saw North Carolina I just stand amazed that what God the brother said the pastor said this was one of the best services in their thirty years of having a church 30 years and hear him I'm like well I'm nothing like you know me I'm nothing I'm just I'm just brother yes and for God to come down and the pastor's wife said that was God from beginning to end God spoke every you know every word was God and the pastor's on his knees I mean he went down his knees literally crying and crying out to God for repentance and revival in the church you know he said everything that was preached was exactly what they needed and that's that same thing I preached here I don't think I added anything different I think it was all just same thing church attendance paying your ties not robbing God I preached on Star Wars a lot you know Netflix and just Turkey the same thing worshiping God putting the word first you know not putting anything above the word and it brought the church to its knees see so I feel like we're standing but right even right now I gotta make sure I take heed to my life which is this I got away my life carefully I and we all have to do that tonight with eggs my life is my life is this truly pleasing to God the things I'm watching on YouTube or the websites I'm going to or my facebook posts whatever and I love how you put bible scriptures on the facebook i love that i try to put as much as I can about Jesus or family on there to try to point and say thank you Jesus or thank God for this or thank God I was always trying to point it to Jesus see when we think we're the strongest that's when Paul says you got to be the most careful you got to be careful that you don't stumble into idolatry okay or a temptation he there hath no temptation taken you but such as common to man but God is faithful who not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear in that beautiful amen in every trial God makes a way for us to get out every child there's gonna be no trial where I couldn't overcome this Jesus or you didn't make a way for me to do that no Jesus makes away every single time we just got to be patient wait upon the Lord and we got to look for the way out well I see a lot of people get into sin and they don't even try to repent they don't even try to get out we gotta look for a way out amen it's exactly right and this encouraged me to you know there's no temptation that you've had except what's common to everybody else and as that pastor was praying on his knees and this pastor knew brother Branham he knew brother Branham he went to church with brother Branham in his whole life until brother Graham passed away in 65 so from night I think was from 1958 to 1965 he went to programs Church follow brother Ram around the country and he he would he was praying and cursing all these demons and saying you know I said I felt like a failure as a pastor and this scripture came to my heart the same struggles he has with one to see his people be more faithful get their idols out pray more come to church early and pray serve God get out all their you know attractions and temptation the same feelings he had was the same things I felt I'd say that encouraged me you guys remember when he was praying that remember that he was saying I felt like a failure and all these things and he's on his knees and God we humble ourselves forgive me I felt like I failed as a pastor and he's been pastor in 30 years I've been pastoring eleven-and-a-half and I just helped me the same temptation he has me even knowing brother Branham and the church they just had they just had three people healed of cancer through their prayers Bri and then he still afterwards then that was before the service and after the service he still said the church was back slid you tell me about that you see that that's the thing you can have the rain falls on the just and the unjust you can have people healed and everything like that but as a whole the church wasn't on fire and he knew it and so God used the message I brought from the red heifer to the host of choice he used that to bring them to repentance now hopefully they keep it up by God's grace so see what his sheep do they run from it if something's pops up on your phone like I don't talk to brother 1 now I talked to these guys these little kids at a Bible club when I was 4 September we taught a whole month at Bible Club on social media devices how to use devices and one of the boys made us all laugh he said he said mr. Smith I said yeah I said boys and girls how can you keep your eyes from those things and he said erasing and I said mr. Smith yes he said well what I do is when when my friend he said my friend tried to show me a bad picture on his iPod he said I took his iPod and I threw it across the room and I said that's the right thing to do although it could have cost him an iPod it could have cost him $179 hour much they cost but he literally said that his brother's like yeah he did and I thought my isn't that a puke a true picture of childlike faith if only us mature adult message believers would have enough sincerity if we're seeing something wrong throw it away I'm not saying break your phone I'm just say I'm not trying to get you in debt I'm necessarily trying to say but the reality of a Christian is to get away from sin as fast as you can don't play around with it don't don't stare it a little longer to shut it off get rid of it don't look at it that's childlike faith and that's what we need in our church that's what every church needs God showed me that the same things brother Brooks church needs is the same thing our church needs it's the same thing brother Tim Hume church needs and they have 300 I think in their church I was preaching to 300 people it's the same thing they need what they need they need back to their first love they need an on fire experience with Christ they need to only feed on the word of God and just cut and just flee from idolatry if they just see we always want new revelations but like I said God can't give us new until we do the old teachings until we until we obey the old commands how is God going to give us new and that's exactly true for our church every Church we've got to do the commands that we know to do and then God will bless us with more revelation that's always how it's been oh that's what that's what the Jesus told members Jesus told that to Andrew and Philip he said oh he said you've seen these do you believe after just these things he said I'll show you greater things to come remember that in John chapter 1 let's read that excited I'm really cutting up I'm really I really didn't quote that good at all let's go to John chapter 1 boy that was pretty bad it's been a while since I appreciate okay yeah it's John 150 Jesus answer to sending him because I said unto thee I saw the under the fig tree believe us now thou shalt see greater than these and he said then verily verily I say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending I'm sorry ascending and descending upon the Son of Man okay so that's the idea if you can believe and obey the little things God's gonna show you a greater things than that hey man hallelujah alright so we have idea of sheep now let's look over here here's another yeah here's there's a third thought on sheep so before he finishes the open door he spends time on sheep and Shepherds but that was not all I saw and learned over there one day I got to thinking about having seen men out in the fields hurting different kinds of animals one fellow would be tending some pigs and others some goats and camels mules etc so I asked a friend who lived there what they call these men oh he replied their shepherds I couldn't take that I said you don't mean to say they're all shepherds Shepherds only herd sheep don't they know a shepherd is a herder or grazer so anyone who grazes animals is a shepherd well he said that did surprise me but I noticed the difference between those herders and the ones that took care of the Sheep come nighttime all the others took the I'm sorry but the Shepherd of the sheep left his animals in the fields and went on home the Shepherd took his sheep with them and put them into the fold and then lay down and became the door of the Sheep oh praise God our Shepherd never leaves us or forsake us amen sorry when nighttime comes I want to be in his phone I want to be in the care of Jesus amen glory don't you know that Church don't you know that the bartender tonight at his bar don't you know he's a shepherd don't you know that those are all his sheep don't you know the people at the Tim McGraw and Faith Hill concert don't you know Tim McGraw as a shepherd those are all his sheep don't you know those men and women at the Trump rally tonight or whatever whenever rally they had don't you know he's the Shepherd and they're his sheep if they exalt him above the word of God then they become sheep which really they're goats they're not really sheep they are goats and they have a shepherd aren't you glad your Shepherd of Jesus sheep of Jesus Christ a shepherd hallelujah how do you know cuz everything he says I do I don't know you I never put anyone above Christ I never put anybody above the word Christ is number one see a lot of people are sheep of their boss and their boss is their true Shepherd of their life if their boss says you got to work and you said to go to church they're like okay or their schoolwork oh I've got a big test tomorrow well I can't go to church tonight we'll see your real Shepherd is your professor right it is that right I had many friends like that in college I'd be like where were you a church you know is that the chapel well I just study it on a Sunday morning you guys on Sunday morning see your real pastor Laurie your real pastor is your professor or your real well my wife wouldn't let me go to church well your real pastor is your wife is that right you understand that and that's what it becomes that's what bro Graham said yeah they might be they're all shepherds in some way now ultimately who is their real pastor Satan because there's only two shepherds there's only good and evil but Jesus said there's only two masters God and may God right I'm sorry Gog and Mammon there's only two there's really only two Shepherds and I'm so glad I follow Jesus I'm so glad I found the path of the bloody bleeding word amen the word for today how do you know because I keep following in those narrow paths in other words what I mean I would say like this but I am not many people are living like you and I hey man not many people are walking the steps that we walk what is it it's full devotion to the word it's full of beaten to the Word of God we want to be in the word all the way hey man that's exactly right Church how do you know because most of our friends and I aren't in church right most of my friends in the well hopefully the people in our church are listening you're live streaming tonight hopefully those numbers have been going up so hopefully that's the case moving it like 18 or 20 people live streaming that's great but I talk about most of my friends like at work or most of my friends you know in denomination church most of them don't even go to church on Wednesday night so see you and I if we're sincere were already going to be spiritually stronger than them and we ought to be praise God we ought to be because our true Shepherd is Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not well I've got a homework I gotta turn in the morning or something like that my teacher at the middle school and my teacher at Arrowhead or mr. Smith I I want to be a I'm gonna be a faithful Shepherd to the church here by God's grace I think you understand what I'm saying we never put anything above the Word of God well you know it's Friday night I can't pray tonight because the ballgame is on tonight well now you know your your team your your team's coach the Ohio State football coach I forget his name now but he's your shepherd now if that game is more important than praying and reading your Bible he's now your shepherd so follow him but if you're a true sheep of God you'll follow Christ amen and then that way you'll follow the fivefold ministry because that's who he speaks through by man said that's God's dress swear amen now this strangely after reading this this morning I didn't plan this it just came to me as I was studying it strangely reminded me of a desire I had to go through and look at all the scriptures in the Old Testament that said Shepherd as I was preparing about 45 minutes this morning so I'm just gonna go through the ones that I felt were very helpful so I hope these are helpful for you let's go through let's go through and and the reason I want to go through these so you see what a true Shepherd looks like compared to a false Shepherd now we already know the true voice of Christ will point us the true Shepherd will points to the word we know a false Shepherd will point you to idolatry and the Bible said they'll tickle your ears the Bible said they'll turn grace into lasciviousness lawlessness where you can do whatever you want you're going to heaven you can do whatever the nonsense the true Shepherd takes us back to the word now Isaiah 55 56 was the first one I thought worked now look this is God talking his Watchmen are blind so God's Watchmen or shepherds are blind they are all ignorant they're all dumb dogs and that's some harsh words there sometimes God balls people out sometimes I get up here people think I'm mad but do they I wonder if they prayed or fasted before the service because if they're not in a spiritual Channel they won't know if it's God in me or if it's just my own human human nature but I'll tell you most most Sundays I'm fasting and praying right most Sundays I fast and pray but see these preachers are all dumb dogs that's what the Bible says now dumb means you cannot talk their dogs but with no bark and they cannot bark so see there's really they see the the preachers don't have a warning oh my amen see sometimes brother brother Adam and mother Malachi sometimes on Wednesday now I'm barking out warnings all right get away from that sin get away see but the the false pastors have no bark they don't warn the people but God said a real Shepherd will have some bark to him amen glory get away from that TV here get away from that app get away from pride get away from stealing from God you know get away from us see he's got to have some bark behind him amen sleeping lying down they loved this slumber so they're lazy the false shepherds are lazy they don't want to get up and work for God I'm happy to work for Jesus amen I always even my hobbies are all Jesus except for Taekwondo but that's just for my body so I don't die early you know thought less God wants to take me off the earth early and that's because James browning told me that James browning said before he passed away he told me if I could do one thing he said I wouldn't did more exercise when I was younger and so I took that to heart he said cuz right now I could be doing missionary work he said but instead I'm in the hospital that's why I do Taekwondo that's the only thing that I do that's really not God centered although what did we talk about last night Malachi light and darkness remember last night the the minister talked or left mister the master talked about light and darkness and it was all about truth versus evil revelation remember the key of knowledge we talked about that last night that's the Bible he was preaching to us I got to hear preaching last night from my Taekwondo master now how many people do you know that like you can do that but you see they have no bark they have no warning to them yeah there are greedy dogs see these pastors are greedy the only want they only care about your money and never had they can never have enough money and they're the Shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way everyone first gain from his quarter I'm glad when Adam and Bo did that pastor appreciation card for me there was a couple people on there the wrote that I'm so glad you're a pastor you care about all the sheep anytime Church I know someone's got a need I'm looking out for their well-being God knows that and if I failed God forgive me but everyone I know of I try to help every person I know if I know they have a need somehow God's my witness come ye say they I will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and tomorrow we should be as the day and much more abundant see that's what these preachers are saying oh let's just get let's just enjoy worldly things let's just get drunk on idolatry see let's just Oh Lords not the coming Lords not soon you know they've got no bark you know they don't scare anybody they don't they don't bring the reverence of God to a service you understand that we just all just relax it and make as much money and it's all about money it's all about you know join life here like the preachers say they say living your best life now I want to live the best life I can for Christ now but my best life is going to be in heaven amen my best life is not going to be right now I'm gonna have struggles I'm gonna go through trials I'm gonna have financial battles I'm gonna have spiritual battles this I want to live my best now but my best life is walking on those streets of gold amen glory that's gonna be my best life amen when we all fall down and throw our crowns at the feet of Jesus that's gonna be my best life they men Jeremiah 23 and I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I've driven them now this got it this is happening right now God's drawing Israel back to the homeland and will bring them again to their folds and they should be fruitful and increase and I'll set up Shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither should they be lacking say at the Lord so see that's my job my job is to preach so we have no fear right that's what the Shepherds gonna do they're gonna preach and take away all fear they're gonna feed the people so the people aren't dismayed or discouraged I hope you leave here encouraged tonight by God's grace I I leave every service encouraged once I get the van I may have some mind battles Satan tried to discourage me but when I'm worshipping Jesus and preaching his word and loving him and praying I'm nothing but encouraged amen but see the real pastor they let fear stay in the church I'm sorry the false pastor they let fear stay and they have people that are discouraged and they don't get people the real meat that they need they're lacking but we should leave here with all that we have need of amen now look how will you Shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes so God's saying you're gonna cry and roll around your ashes you principle the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished so they're gonna get slaughtered and and spread apart and you shall fall like a pleasant vessel and the Shepherd's shall have no way to flee nor the principal of the flock to escape so this is the this like the day of judgment a voice of the cry the Shepherd's and a howling of the principal the flock shall be heard for the Lord has spoiled their pasture so see that's not a lot of earthly Shepherds do today they just try to make life so easy here on earth all they're concerned about is making their home better right or their kingdom or their church bigger see and so they scream and they howl because they're losing their earthly goods but we don't store up treasures on earth we store up treasures in heaven amen if we lose everything what who cares if we lose this church and the chairs get burnt up who cares if I lose my home or van who cares at least I got Jesus amen will it be hard yeah but our delight the reason we cry and scream isn't because we live net lose natural things it's because the reason we cry and scream is because we want to see people saved amen that's the real burden our treasures are in heaven not upon the earth but see the earth the sinful pastures I'll say like this the ghost shepherds the Shepherd's of the goats there oh the only reason they cries because they don't get enough money or they don't get enough lands or other house isn't big enough for all these things all they care about is money look at your it kind of tears preachers up this tears up the false preachers not the good ones the false ones my people have been lost sheep their Shepherds have caused them to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains in other words I'll just just keep wondering keep wandering away from the word it's okay if you just wander away from our services and it's okay you'll be fine out there no we need a shepherd that barks and say get back here get off the mountains come back to the fold come back where their safety did you know their safety here tonight in the house of God amen why because God's angels are here Church oh yeah the angel camps about those that fear the Lord there's angels in our myths amen and when a pastor says I know it's okay for you to miss church it's okay if you're not the fellowship with the Saints it's okay like this it's like a fall shepherdess then the sheep just walk out on the mountains gonna get cut up by some wolves you don't gonna have a spiritual death right from the wolves and they've caused people to go straight on this is what I would say as far as I know I haven't preached any false doctrine in years no one has come to show me any false doctrine in years I might have said something wrong way you know we had some conversations something mighta came out the wrong way but as far as I know I haven't led anyone astray I haven't let anyone into idolatry I've been trying to lead people into knee ology hallelujah we need to pray more we need to study Obama's more we didn't listen to the seven churches need to listen to mother anymore that's what I'm trying to lead people into if I'd caught anybody go to straight they haven't let me know and I don't know about it again God is my witness the open door the Shepherd becomes the door amen and if there's anything that comes to the church any new idea it's supposed to come through the pastor that's right there's any relationship like you know people wanting to court it needs to come through the of course the father of the daughter but also he's come to the pastor everything needs to come through the door praise God that's why years ago you know I want to be the only one I made this rule I'm the only one that he knows everybody in the church and I do that because the voice of the of the the the Shepherd should have the voice to the sheep if someone just starts making a list and so I was texting everybody in the church and the brother from New York told me that that a brother does that and it divided his church he started to become a preacher a text preacher he called it and you won't find that in the Bible this brother tried to get start influencing other brothers and their wives and tried to draw a church see he didn't go through the door he didn't go through the pastor hello there's one door there's one way and any new doctrine see any preacher that comes through here I got to make sure they come to that I know all about them first I got to make sure they live the right life I've got to ask them about their life I got to make sure they're gonna preach the right thing because the sheep goes through the door and he is the door and that's what all these church books have come people tried to exalt themselves as pastors or bringing new doctrines and they avoid the pastor you see but this is what the Bible said they have gone from Mountain to Hill they have forgotten their resting place see many sheep forget where they find their rest where do we where did David say I want to dwell all the days of my life does anybody know Lydia in the house Lord thank you in the house of the Lord where a day where did David say one day at work is better than a thousand elsewhere one day at the restaurant at Chipotle one day in the house Lord is better than a thousand elsewhere one thing I'd ask and I would seek that I could dwell in the house Lord all the days of my life some people forget churches the place where where you find rest for your souls amen I'm good attitude toward the preacher you got to love the pastor you got the people you got love everybody in the church you can't have any divisions you have any complexes all that has to be gone and then church becomes a resting place and it becomes a place where you can find rest for your soul you can find peace all that found them have devoured them so this is the time of the Sheep the Shepherd just let him go out and they already devoured by sin devoured by Satan and their adversary said we offend not because they have sinned against the Lord the habitation of justice even the Lord the hope of their father so they sinned against God now this is quite a chapter here I'm not much time I got I didn't set my timer but I realized I got about let me set it for 15 minutes and then I maybe I'll have five more after that I didn't set my watch I don't know what time exactly I started okay I don't know this one this looks like the Antichrist maybe you can read that at home I'm not gonna read that one tonight because I don't know who it is it sure looks like the Antichrist as a shepherd a false shepherd let's go to Ezekiel 34 this whole chapters about shepherds which I may preach on later we'll see but the most of our verses are 2 2 4 6 to 12 13 to 16 so let's read those I hope this has becoming clear Church about what a true Shepherd is Jesus and of course myself as a pastor all the faithful pastors around the area you know like brother Jim shumake and Chad lamb and brother cam and brother Brooks and brother did Tim Humes and all these wonderful brothers brother Samuel browning I start naming them all you know all of them mother Annie sayest you know Vaughn carry on all these wonderful brothers zekiel 34 2 to 4 but I don't do to read 2 3 & 4 let's say he bonza that wish was broken either heavy brought the guns again that which was driven away he didn't have easy sought that which was lost a width course and with cruelty and he rolled in them amen praise the Lord that was good thank you brother appreciate that so see judgments upon the shepherds because they only fed themselves they only clothed themselves a nice clothes let me tell you ivan about any nice clothes in a long time this was a good wilt I've had this for about ten years all my suits are probably at least ten years old I don't even I never I haven't bought one in over ten years you know but see uh-huh anyways you eat the fat you clothed you with the wool you kill them that are fed but you feed not the flock look at verse four you haven't strengthened disease I try to pray for everybody that's sick that I know of and I'll fast here many times on Saturdays and Sundays I'll fast for people I'll go pray for them it wherever they if they ask me to come pray for them neither have you healed that which was sick neither have you bound up that which was broken neither brought again that which was driven away I've gone to people's houses that have left if they'll let me come over sure I let them come over or try to come over and get them back to come back to church defend the message but most people when they leave they won't call me back I try to text them I try to email them I still email people have left the church and they never I mean why every now and then don't email me back and they'll thank me for emailing them I try to go out if they'll come back I try to bring them back but look but with force and with cruelty have you ruled them but now remember you gotta balance this force and cruelty versus having barked the pastor's got to have some bark but he doesn't force people into things he's not cruel to them remember where we just say he just called him dumb dogs so see you see I've to have to have a balance that's that you have to have a balance there sometimes the Holy Spirit will ball people out just like John the Baptist he said your generation of vipers you know Jesus said Jesus said you're Pharisees you're making your converts to follow the sons of hell than you are you're making them double anointed sons of hell so see it takes a balance that's why there sometimes it feels like I'm hard preaching I believe it's the Holy Spirit because it's trying to get people to the Word of God now look at verse yeah I'm not gonna run out of time verse 6 my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill yeah my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and none did search or seek after them like I said I've tried to go on after everybody if they'll talk to me I'm happy I don't want I want to talk them back I try to do everything I can to bring them back now verse okay let's go to 12 yeah all the way well let's go yeah 7 to 12 therefore you Shepherds hear the word Lord as I live saith the Lord God surely because my flock became a prey and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no Shepherd neither did my Shepherds search for my flock but the Shepherd's fed themselves and fed not my flock therefore o Shepherds hear the word of Lord thus saith the Lord God behold I'm against the shepherds and I'll require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither shall the Shepherd's feed themselves anymore for I will deliver my flock from their mouths that they may not be meat for them in that striking church think about all the unfaithful pastors in the message there's some think about all the faithful ones though praise the Lord see God is gonna require how did you treat the flock did you preach them the message did you preach the revelation of the Word of God for this hour or you try to preach him Lutheran doctrine you try to preach him Pentecostal doctrine oh you all need to speak in tongues what food did you feed them I'm glad that we feed on the fresh word of the hour we feed on the word that's been revealed today praise God the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues the avesta' the Holy Ghost might include that but the evidence Holy Ghost is believing and living all the Word of God you must do both you must believe it and you also must must also live it that's right verse 11 for thus saith the Lord God behold I even I will search both search my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark amen hallelujah now I'm gonna skip pass I have a lot of New Testament Scriptures to I'm skipping past these because I want to finish this thought I got to finish this open door I got to finish it tonight okay I just can't I don't know if I can take this another night so just why I just want to feel like I'm done now I love it I could preach another night but I want to feel like I'm done and then move on the next stop now that we can see Jesus the door he's the door of the Sheep and notice what speaks now of the door opening what is that but a revelation of him so when does the open door symbolize it means Jesus revealing himself who he is and that revelation is opening up to bring us strength to illuminate the word and the glorify His name amen there it is right there so I need to I need to fix that I missed that right there when I'm studying give me just a second here let me I need to highlight that real quick I can't miss that I need to make sure I have that for next time I look over okay sorry about that that's the threefold member the open door was connected to three things in that scripture strength word and glue and glorifying his name it was in the midst of the last two ages of the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us remember Philadelphia Laodicea the open door age yes we knew he was God House could he be our Savior but to know that he was only God or God alone that he was Alpha Omega that this Jesus with both Lord and Christ making him Lord Jesus Christ the father son and holy ghost all one person Amen that had been lost since the first Church ages but now we're seeing it again so brother Ham said the little strength comes from the revelation of the deity of Christ Jesus is the word and the name of course we baptize in the name of Lord Jesus we glorify his name now look at this thought did you know he said this brother branham said if you believe in the Trinity he said your you actually worship 3 he said you're breaking the first commandment you worship 3 God's the revelation of who he was they come back indeed Godhead is not a three-person God with one personality they and I had a man emailed me this this week about the Trinity he said I believe he's three persons in one person now can you imagine the nonsense and that you've got to be insane to believe that you're three people in one person it doesn't make sense Church I just like I can't even grasp that you know I mean I can't even understand how they can say some of these things oh my and then he was this guy was using the Creed to prove that he was right instead of the Bible and I said well because I was saying how the Creed says he's he's three gods and he said no at the end of the Creed the Athanasian Creed says he's not three gods he's one God he said that's his proof your proof could not be the Creed the proof has to be the word amen the Bible said prove all things not by the Creed by the word Amen but see they have to lean upon a creed which means I believe they have to lean upon their beliefs rather than God's beliefs and that's in a shame and that said this is and they think they're saying they think they're they love their they know that the Bible there's one personality scene there can't be three personalities there is about one person but they who believe in three persons have a three God Godhead and are guilty of breaking the first commandment the first they can't even they can't even obey the very first commandment because of the Trinity so I just I just put this out here Tertullian he was the scholar that he wrote the word Trinity first and he wrote it around 300 AD okay so that was introduced here and now brother Ram said the open door we can finally move past this was in Philadelphia and Laodicea now we have an open door to the Godhead to Jesus name and baptism to knowing who God is Church it was hidden for almost my mam said I've said after the first age they lost it there one two three four after for ages God's giving it back to us out of there yeah it's God but the revelation the God had his back I'm almost done here let me check and see I'm almost done oh well yeah okay I got some more I may skip but the revelation of the Godhead is back and now the true church can build and strength again after all this time she finally knows who her Lord is can you imagine being married to your spouse and not even known who they are because they lied right and that's what the Trinity is it's a lie it's a lie from hell after all this time she finally knows who our Lord is once again we were baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus just as they did at Pentecost look what my mom says here this is a good thought what is the open door the revelation of the supreme need of Jesus Christ what'd he say the first church church age back there he said I am he that was which is which shall come I'm the first and the last I am The Almighty he said it three different times he made himself deity to this first church here before he went into the last church age he said I said before you an open door I want you to see I want you to see I'm sorry if you want to see the revelation here it is where he would build his church and the only way that he could take his church is back to the revelation of what he is truly a man that's what that is the only way he could build the church again is to bring them back to where they started huh me know we only had two prophets real prophets we had a major profit here and we had a major profit here how many know that in between they only had minor prophets there was no major prophets in here we only had a major profit alpha and a major profit at the Omega age the last age the closing age now you ever heard that dream about brother Branham with the club three three corner Club yeah that's read out you like this I think this is the one I'm closing with yeah I think this is the whole thing yep so let's close to this store you like this oops sorry let me tell you god-given dream I had about triune baptism this was not a vision but a dream you know I'm sure that one of the blessings of the church age was to receive dreams by the Holy Ghost just the same as one can receive visions it was about 3 a.m. on a Saturday morning I just got enough to get Joseph a drink of water when I lay down I fell asleep instantly and dream this dream I saw a man that I was supposed was my I suppose was my father he was a great big burly man or I also saw a woman who was supposed to be my mother but she didn't look like her even as the man did not look like my father this man was very mean to his wife he had a large club with three corners on it I looked on Google I couldn't find a three-cornered Club I want to just have a picture for the kids you know so there's a real mean man and he's treating this woman mean he's got a three-cornered Club so it's kind of got like three corners on it it's kind of hard to picture so the top of his club looks like that it's got three corners on it got like a like a big piece like a baseball back so it's got three corners at the top okay that's what he had a dream of this man was very mean you know when you take a log and set it on the end and hit it with an axe it makes a three-cornered wedge like a piece of firewood it was like that he would take this club and hit her with it and knock her down and she would lie there crying he would walk around with his chest stuck out on his face was such a proud boastful look that he appeared to take a great pride and satisfaction beating up a poor little woman every time she tried to get up you and hit her I did not like what he was doing but as I considered stopping and I thought I can't tackle that man he's too big and then he's supposed to be my father but down inside I knew he wasn't my father I knew that no man had the right to treat a woman like that and the church said you know there's people in the message that beat that there's men that beat their wives it's awful they're not through with the Holy Ghost they're probably not even saved a man that would beat a woman or a child or hurt a child they're probably not even saved because they won't inherit the kingdom of God that's effeminate that's that same type of dominating spirit but down okay I went over and grabbed him by the collar and turned around and said you have no right to strike her and when I said that my muscles grew and I look like a giant see why we got to stand up against sin we got to stand up and fight against sin the man saw them and then he was scared of me and I said you strike her again you'll deal with me he hesitated to strike her again and then the dream left me see he's standing up for the church right and I gotta stand up for you and you've got to stand up against denominations right I woke immediately after the dream and I thought how strange it was I wondered why I had dreamed about that woman when suddenly there he came I love when he comes hey I love when Jesus comes and the presence of God became known to me an interpreter of the dream came known to him okay there's my 15 minutes I'll put five more yeah I'm doing good on time okay it's only eight 48:36 and the interpretation of dream came from him from Christ now you people know that not only have I interpreted your dreams exactly but I have many many times told you what you dream so that you never had to tell me the woman represents the Church of the world today I was born right into this mess the mess that she was in so were you and I she was supposed to be kind of a mother she's the mother of harlots her husband is the denomination's that rule her the three-cornered block is a false triune baptism unto a trinity see why do people say father only goes there trying to get you to believe in three gods that's the whole point behind it they're trying Satan try to make people and idolaters if he can get him father son Holy Ghost and if he could have him read just Matthew 28 without reading the book of Acts if he can get him to do that then he can maybe he could get them to be an idolatry on the day of judgment well I believe in three persons I believe God has three persons in one person Oh shame on them see every time she started to rise up that means the congregation begin to accept water baptism in name of Lord Jesus he would drive her right down again with that false doctrine he was so that I was afraid of him at first when I came against him I found I had great muscles great and powerful muscles they were face muscles ha ha ha praise God do you see Church when you get in a scriptural battle of somebody what does it make you do it makes you want to fight and not in a bad way but it makes you want to see the word prevail it doesn't make you see it doesn't make me like with this guy me me on this week about the journey it doesn't make me want to see him go to hell but at once me and wants to see Jesus beat down that denominational spirit and it makes me want to see him leave his denomination and get free and get baptized in Jesus Christ's name Amen I got a good testimony a preacher a Pentecostal preacher in a Spanish church in Texas saw my video on the Lord Jesus Christ baptism he shared it with his pastor and his pastor turned down he shared it with his wife and his wife turned it down but he said brother Jesse I'm willing to fly up he called me on the phone I'm willing to fly up to Akron from Texas to be baptized by you I said first let me see if I know a preacher in Texas so I asked brother Scott Walker I said he used to go to brother David mcGarry's Church in Texas I said can I have that pastors number and Scott said of course so I shared that number with this preacher from Texas and he just sent me an email Monday he said praise the Lord I'm taking my whole family to brother mcGarry's Church he said I realized I not only need to be baptized in Jesus Christ name he said I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen I was gonna say thank you Lord amen praise God see now he's experienced in this he's starting to rise up against that denominational Pentecostal spirit and that that preachers seen faith muscles rise yeah Amen why because God doesn't back down to the devil hallelujah Jesus never back down to Satan he just stood there and stood with the Word of God amen and when he spoke the word demons had to flee hallelujah and we speak the word the demons will flee from the true believer well glory they were faith muscles and when do you know your faith is a strong when do you feel like you're the strongest when you're standing up against the devil don't you when you get a real scripture war with somebody don't you feel that's when you're the strongest when you're standing on God's Word your faith muscles or you're going through a test and something's tempting you and fight you finally turn that down and say no I'm gonna obey God's Word that's when you feel the strongest because you're looking that devil in the face and the Word of God will never be defeated praise God the Word of God will always make that that three corner club man the Shia way the faith will always grab that man by the collars that you listen to me this is what God word says glory that's what faith will always do well Graham says got hair on his chest it's the mature Christian faith is a mature Christian it knows what the Bible says amen so the outcome of that dream was that since God is with me and can give me such strength then let me stand up a stand up for her against the denominational power of the world and make him quit striking her in that beautiful praise God hallelujah I just got what see one I just got two more yeah so we're almost done let's stand here I'll have you stand now brother Graham says I'm not trying to build a doctrine upon a dream and there's my five minutes okay nor am i trying to vindicate any doctor and I stand for by a dream so see you never vindicate doctrine by dreams you've indicated doctrine by the Word of God amen oneness of the Godhead is all the way from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation 22:20 one the whole Bible but the people have been blinded by an unscriptural dogma of a trinity and that Dogma is so universally accepted that to try to see a one god person is all but impossible if people can't see the truth of the Godhead but they fight it they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the revelation isn't this beautiful I love this the Rev is Jesus Christ in his church and his works in the myths of the church for seven ages did you get that now I'm sure you understand it so go if you got your Bible go to Revelation 1 this is the whole entire revelation of Jesus it's revelation 113 this is what program said if you can't see that there's only one God there's one person you're gonna miss the entire church ages in that right it's exactly right you're never gonna know you're living in layer 2 see you're gonna think oh we're just know there's gonna be a great revival someday and all of America is gonna be saved you wouldn't believe how many friends had told me that in the last year I had three or four friends tell me always gonna be a great revival I'm like there's gonna be revival for the Antichrist that's the only revival other than the bride's revival glory hallelujah which we're part of right now but see the whole thing about the Godhead is revelation 1:13 that there's one God amen there's one person standing in our myths tonight amen it's not three persons it's one person amen it's Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit is here tonight to meet every need amen that's that's the reality that's there's not like I was telling this guy in the email there's not three Thrones in heaven there's one throne if there was three persons there'd have to be three Thrones because Jesus even says my Father's throne in my throne remember that I remember that jesus said it makes it sound like there's two Thrones but when you look in the Bible there's only one throne so what does it show it shows there's a throne that was for the invisible spirit but now the invisible spirit made a body lives in that spirit and that body sits on the throne amen hahaha but see the trinitarian get caught up and think oh there's two Thrones or three throws but you'll never find that in the Bible there's only one throne hallelujah hey man that was good thank you Jesus hey thank you lord revelation 1:13 let's all read together one two three and the myths of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle amen this is what I'm saying the whole point of Revelation is to see that Jesus Christ is in the midst of his church doing his works it's God in the midst of a church not a second person it's God with us amen it's God with us tonight hallelujah no matter how many people are here I don't care how many people here as long as Jesus is here amen that's all the matters amen and that we now never cared about numbers anyway all I care about is I have that one numbers here I want to be in that number the number of the Saints amen the number with Jesus Christ here amen that's all that's mattered praise God he said you get that now I'm sure you understand see this is what it's all about one person ministering to his church it's God last quote but Aram said hallelujah here's Jehovah the Old Testament the God of the amen here is Jesus of the New Testament the God of the amen here o Israel oh this is a food around me six for hear o Israel the Lord thy God is one God there it is again the Jehovah of the Old Testament is that Jesus of the new the New Testament does not reveal another God it is the further revelation of the one and same God Christ did not come down to make himself known he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and make known the father he never talked about two gods he never talked about two persons he said he talked about one God and now this last age now this is an interesting quote in this last age we have come back to the capstone revelation the most important revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible that Jesus is God he and the father are one there's one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and that beautiful now some people say this is the most important revelation in the whole Bible and it might say that but it's kind of worded a little different they're the most important revelation of Godhead so I don't know if that changed it or not I'm just saying I don't know but let me say like this is it a major revelation yes it's a major revelation but I'm just saying some people preach it really hard one way some people preach another also I knows what the Bible said the Bible said it was one person in the midst of the seven candlesticks he said I'm Alpha I'm Omega the beginning the end I am the Lord God Almighty all's I know is the one person and you have to know that one person to understand the golden candlesticks understand if you know that one person now you know where you are you're in the seventh branch you're in Laodicea and you got to be an overcomer in your age and how you gonna overcome by the one who's standing with you Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen enjoy this tonight by God's grace oh my I was so beautiful this was so beautiful God is so beautiful let me click off here and make sure I think I finished that okay yeah so next time when we don't start the judgement of the false - I was ready to appreciate tonight so I got plenty more slides there I couldn't preach tonight I wanted to finish that one the open door how many thankful for the open door tonight oh thankful for the name of Jesus the strength the word and the name very thankful for that praise God as we close here is there any uh can we think of any other prayer requests that we need to pray for anything else just about all praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus thank
