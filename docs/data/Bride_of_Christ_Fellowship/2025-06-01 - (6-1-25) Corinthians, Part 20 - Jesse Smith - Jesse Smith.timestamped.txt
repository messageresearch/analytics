[0:00] Wednesday we start looking at the gifts
[0:01] of the Holy Spirit. So we like to go
[0:02] through this again here uh by the grace
[0:04] of the Lord part 20. And we'll start
[0:07] with 1 Corinthians
[0:17] 12:6. You know church, the more we think
[0:19] about it, the more we can recognize
[0:20] whenever God moved in our life, it was
[0:22] moving through one of the nine gifts of
[0:24] the Holy Spirit. And then as a preacher,
[0:26] you know, you have one of the five gifts
[0:28] or maybe one or more of the five
[0:30] preaching gifts. So in my life, I'll see
[0:32] God moving in, you know, pastoring,
[0:34] teaching. Uh last year, I did some
[0:36] evangelism. And so, uh we're thankful,
[0:39] you know, when God moves, he's going to
[0:41] use one of these gifts in our life.
[0:42] Praise God. And uh we want to recognize
[0:45] that we want to be uh we want to be
[0:48] yielded and we want to be waiting for
[0:49] God to put his hand in our glove, right?
[0:52] And use our glove, right? use our vessel
[0:54] for the glory of God. Hallelujah. For
[0:56] you and I, Jesus said, you and I can do
[0:58] nothing. Right? In John 15:5, he said,
[1:00] "Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[1:02] We're just like a glove. We're just like
[1:04] a a temple. We're just like a vessel.
[1:06] But when God comes in, then God can do
[1:08] something great." Praise God. 1
[1:09] Corinthians 12 6. We'll read six down
[1:12] through
[1:13] 11. Of course, a very familiar text
[1:15] here, but we're preaching through the
[1:17] entire book of 1 Corinthians. and uh
[1:20] little over well more than halfway done
[1:21] here by God's
[1:24] grace. I'll read uh 6 through 10 and
[1:27] then we can read verse 11 together here.
[1:29] So I'll read verse 6 through 10. And
[1:31] there are diversities of operations, but
[1:33] is the same God which workketh all in
[1:37] all. But the manifestation of the spirit
[1:39] is given to every man to profit with
[1:42] all. So think of that. Even little Levi
[1:44] has a little gift in his life. Praise
[1:46] God. He'll grow up and recognize there's
[1:48] a gift in my life. It's given to every
[1:50] man. Let's say every man. Ready? Every.
[1:53] Every man. Even little James and Andy
[1:55] got little gifts in their life, right?
[1:58] Hallelujah. And we want to just yield to
[2:00] God so God can use the gifts in our
[2:02] life. Verse eight. For by one is given
[2:05] by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to
[2:08] another the word of knowledge by the
[2:09] same Spirit, to another faith by the
[2:12] same Spirit, to another the gifts of
[2:14] healing by the same Spirit, to another
[2:17] the working of miracles, to another
[2:19] prophecy, to another discerning of
[2:22] spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[2:24] tongues, to another the interpretation
[2:27] of tongues. Let's read verse 11. Ready?
[2:30] One, two, three. But all these workketh
[2:33] that one and the self-same spirit,
[2:36] dividing to every man severally as he
[2:39] will. So God determines the gifts that
[2:42] we have. Or maybe just one gift, but God
[2:44] determines which gifts we have. May the
[2:46] Lord add his blessing to the reading of
[2:48] his word. You may be
[2:55] seated. So we just kind of want to just
[2:58] review again where we've made it. We
[2:59] preached through this
[3:01] uh first uh 12 chapters. Now we're in
[3:04] chapter 12. And these are Scoffield's
[3:06] outlines. You know, CI Scofield. We've
[3:09] looked at the believer standing in grace
[3:11] in chapter 1. Then we looked at the the
[3:13] carnal divided condition of the the
[3:15] Corinthian
[3:16] church. Uh we dealt with the sexual
[3:18] immorality aspect in chapter 5 and six.
[3:22] The sanctity of the body and marriage in
[3:23] chapters 6 and 7. Christian liberties
[3:26] and their warnings in chapters 8, 9, and
[3:28] 10. And we looked at headship uh through
[3:31] the length of hair uh God's ordained
[3:33] headship and the Lord's supper in 1
[3:35] Corinthians 11. And now we've been
[3:37] looking here at the spiritual gifts and
[3:38] charity. Uh and we'll cover this for a
[3:40] couple chapters here uh by the grace of
[3:42] the Lord. And how many enjoy when God
[3:43] had brother Simon preach uh
[3:45] Corinthianism. Hallelujah. Didn't even
[3:47] know what I was preaching. Praise God.
[3:49] And uh I I like the thought. So if you
[3:52] remember, if you recall brother Simon's
[3:53] sermons, he was basically saying
[3:54] churches have all these problems, but
[3:56] when you can get to love in chapter 13,
[3:58] when you can get to love, then the gifts
[4:00] can operate correctly and then you'll be
[4:02] resurrected or for us, we want to be
[4:04] raptured. We're hoping to live to see
[4:07] it, right, brother Jose? We hope it's in
[4:08] our lifetime. We hope to be those that
[4:11] are alive and remain and will be changed
[4:13] in a moment in twinkling of an eye to
[4:15] meet the Lord in the air. But if not, if
[4:18] that death due lies cold on my brow, I'm
[4:21] going to love Jesus. Hallelujah. Right?
[4:23] And then if I die, if I go to the grave,
[4:25] then I'll be the first. The dead in
[4:26] Christ will rise first. Praise God. So
[4:28] either way, I win. Hallelujah. Because
[4:30] Jesus made us winners. Hallelujah. Amen.
[4:33] So that was the wonderful thought God
[4:35] gave brother Simon. He actually went
[4:36] through a lot of the the problems in the
[4:38] church and then ended with how uh even
[4:40] in the midst of all these problems in
[4:42] churches, if the people will submit and
[4:44] repent of their sins, God will lead them
[4:46] to charity, which is the baptism of the
[4:49] Holy Ghost and then to a resurrection.
[4:51] Praise God. Hallelujah. So, we want to
[4:54] uh let me just review these three, four,
[4:56] five, six. There's there's at least
[4:58] seven major problems in the Corinthian
[5:00] church and we see it in all churches or
[5:02] many churches today, right? All right,
[5:03] we've just gone through division in our
[5:05] church, you know. Um, but in Corinthian
[5:08] church, they had division, they had
[5:10] sexual morality, then they had uh uh
[5:13] basically greed. They were suing one
[5:15] another, right? And then they had
[5:17] drunkenness and pride uh of their they
[5:20] had drunkenness at the Lord's table. Uh
[5:22] and then they had pride in their
[5:24] financial
[5:25] superiority. And then they were out of
[5:27] control with the gifts. So they were
[5:29] having too many tongues, too many
[5:31] interpretations. They were having
[5:32] tongues without interpretations. So Paul
[5:35] had to order them, right? Hallelujah.
[5:38] And then they were lacking in
[5:39] generosity. Paul even rebukes them that
[5:41] they were lacking to be generous to him.
[5:44] Paul was the one that started the church
[5:46] and they wouldn't even minister to his
[5:48] needs. It really shows a prideful,
[5:50] arrogant, right? This is all a lot of
[5:52] these are pride, you know, division and
[5:53] suing each other. Pride. Pride had
[5:56] really struck their church. And now they
[5:57] didn't even have enough love and
[5:59] humility to help out Paul who was the
[6:01] founder of the
[6:03] church. And then of course in the next
[6:05] book in 2 Corinthians they uh they were
[6:08] actually allowing so many false
[6:09] teachers. Paul said you have 10,000
[6:12] instructors in Christ. In other words,
[6:13] they're just letting anybody come in and
[6:15] preach whatever they want. He said, "But
[6:16] how many fathers in the gospel do you
[6:18] have?" In other words, the people that
[6:20] first uh preach the gospel that your
[6:23] soul could be saved. Hallelujah. And of
[6:25] course uh it seems like they accept
[6:26] accepted Paul here uh as we see in 2
[6:29] Corinthians chap 11. Okay. So uh Sunday
[6:31] or I'm sorry Wednesday we looked at uh
[6:33] verses
[6:34] 1-6 and we saw how uh Paul by the Holy
[6:38] Spirit said there's diversities of gifts
[6:40] which means different gifts. There's
[6:42] nine uh spiritual gifts male or female
[6:45] can have even children. But there's five
[6:49] preaching gifts only men get preaching
[6:50] gifts. Women are not called to preach or
[6:53] pastor, evangelize,
[6:55] uh, be prophets, uh, as far as leaders
[6:58] of churches. They have a gift of a small
[7:00] gift of prophecy, which is one of the
[7:01] nine gifts, but they're not called to be
[7:03] prophets to lead the church like a Moses
[7:06] or a Joshua. Hallelujah. Or a St. Paul,
[7:08] hallelujah, or a St. Peter. Peter had
[7:10] the gift of prophecy as well. And then
[7:12] you had teachers, evangelists, uh, and
[7:15] apostles and so forth. A five-fold
[7:17] ministry is only male because that's how
[7:19] God set it up. It's also repeated in 1
[7:21] Timothy chapter 2. Eve was in the uh in
[7:24] the transgression first, right? And so
[7:27] that's why God does not allow women to
[7:29] preach and lead the church. Hallelujah.
[7:31] And then the Bible said there's
[7:33] differences administrations, which is
[7:34] the word administration means services.
[7:37] Some gifts serve more than others. So
[7:40] think about that. In the preaching
[7:41] gifts, you know, the pastor serves a lot
[7:43] because a pastor is a shepherd. A pastor
[7:45] stays with his sheep. I don't leave you
[7:46] guys and say, "Well, I'll see you in a
[7:47] couple months. I'm going to go over and
[7:49] do some apostle work." No, a pastor
[7:51] stays with a people just like a shepherd
[7:53] stays with a sheep, right? So God uses a
[7:56] a pastor gift very very often, right? To
[7:59] give you the the feed on the word of
[8:01] God. Now with the nine gifts, the the
[8:03] most beneficial of the nine, well, we
[8:05] would probably say is wisdom because
[8:07] wisdom judges all the other ones, right?
[8:08] Wisdom guides all the other ones. That's
[8:10] why it's listed first, right? And
[8:12] Proverbs says wisdom is the principle
[8:14] thing. With all you're getting, get
[8:15] wisdom. And the church said hallelujah
[8:18] wisdom is the principle of all the
[8:19] gifts. Right? And then but between
[8:23] tongues interpretation and prophecy Paul
[8:25] said pray that you prophesy more because
[8:28] prophecy gives edification to the whole
[8:30] church. Hallelujah. So that's why
[8:33] there's different administrations. Some
[8:35] gifts serve more than others.
[8:38] Hallelujah. And then there's different
[8:40] operations. And brother man talked about
[8:42] how or Roberts had bulldog faith.
[8:43] Remember he would he would put his uh
[8:45] hand on the forehead and he would shake
[8:47] the forehead and he would rebuke those
[8:48] demons and the demons would leave.
[8:50] Right? But brother would just simply
[8:52] discern. He would just simply discern
[8:54] the thoughts intents of the heart. Never
[8:55] raise his voice and people would get
[8:57] healed and par he healed from being
[8:59] paralyzed. Amen. Blinded eyes was open
[9:02] and yet he wasn't doing this loud type
[9:04] of a prayer. It was just humble prayer
[9:06] because there's different uh different
[9:08] operations of the Holy Ghost.
[9:10] Hallelujah. There's some miracles where
[9:13] you have to do certain things, uh,
[9:15] right? You got to, uh, do certain things
[9:16] to get a miracle. Other miracles, just
[9:18] speak the word, right? Just speak the
[9:19] word and it'll happen by God's grace.
[9:22] Some some miracles you got to anoint
[9:24] with oil. Some miracles you give a
[9:26] prayer cloth, right? There's there's
[9:29] different ways they work, but it's all
[9:31] working toward the same thing. Jesus
[9:33] getting glory. Hallelujah. Amen. So,
[9:36] we're that's just from Wednesday. Now,
[9:38] we also looked at this. follow charity
[9:40] uh and desire the spiritual gifts but
[9:43] rather that you may prophesy. So he's
[9:44] telling the Corinthians that uh they had
[9:46] too many tongues interpretation they
[9:48] need to start prophesying
[9:49] more. So uh friends you know uh with our
[9:52] stature perfect man love and as I was
[9:55] praying for Levi you know that kind of
[9:56] came to me love is the greatest of all
[9:58] gifts there's no greater gift than love.
[10:01] So, our lives should be daily. How can I
[10:03] love my for me, how can I love my wife?
[10:05] How can I love my children? How can I
[10:07] love the church? How can I love my
[10:09] co-workers at school? You know, because
[10:11] I'm a school teacher. How can I love
[10:12] them? Love ought to be our greatest
[10:14] motivation. Praise God. And then once
[10:17] we've got the the focus, I'm going to
[10:19] love everybody, then we start desiring
[10:21] spiritual gifts. But too many people get
[10:24] angry and bitter and then they want a
[10:25] gift. Well, Lord, send me a gift for
[10:27] that person. Well, you're already angry.
[10:28] you're not operating in the love of God
[10:30] yet. Hallelujah. They want God to bring
[10:32] a curse on somebody or something like
[10:35] that. That's the wrong order. You got to
[10:37] love first, then gifts, not gifts first
[10:40] and then I'll love later. If they just
[10:42] repent and and say, "Sorry,
[10:44] I'm sorry." You're supposed to love your
[10:45] enemies. Hallelujah. Love those who uh
[10:48] despitefully treat you and mistreat you
[10:51] uh that persecute you. Pray for them.
[10:53] Hallelujah. That God will bless them.
[10:55] Bless and don't uh curse. Hallelujah.
[10:58] The Bible says so. See, love is our our
[11:01] main motivation. If we can just love
[11:02] everybody, forgive everybody, pray for
[11:05] them. If you mis mistreat me, I'll still
[11:07] love you.
[11:09] And then desire a gift. But don't desire
[11:11] a gift just to get back at somebody.
[11:14] Right? We love first and then desire
[11:17] gifts. What do we see a lot of churches
[11:19] today? They want gifts without the love.
[11:22] But we got to have love first.
[11:24] Hallelujah. May God always help us to
[11:25] have the love of God first.
[11:28] And then the Bible said covet. Now this
[11:30] is not in a sinful way. Uh but it's
[11:32] eagerly desire. Right? The Bible said
[11:35] wherefore brethren covet the to prophesy
[11:37] and forbid not to speak with tongues. So
[11:40] that's why I put gifts on our our our
[11:42] pre-ervice prayer. That's why I put
[11:43] gifts up there. We're to pray for
[11:45] prophecies. God, send us a prophecy.
[11:48] Show us what's going to happen. Oh God,
[11:50] show us what what what does my future
[11:52] entail? What's going to happen with this
[11:54] relationship? What's going to happen
[11:55] with uh the government? what's going to
[11:57] happen with the church. We should pray
[11:59] for prophecy. Hallelujah. Now, for most
[12:02] of us, it's going to come through
[12:03] dreams.
[12:04] Because I've never seen anybody here
[12:06] stand up and say, "Thus say the Lord,
[12:08] this and this is going to happen next
[12:09] week." I've never seen that. That means
[12:12] you're not a prophet. Right? So, the way
[12:15] God will give us a prophecy is we'll
[12:16] dream something, write it down or text
[12:18] it as soon as you can, and then see if
[12:20] it comes to pass. And then if it comes
[12:22] to pass, say, "Thank God he gave us a
[12:24] prophecy." Amen. Hallelujah.
[12:28] So most of us and and we saw that of
[12:30] course in the book of Matthew chapter 1.
[12:32] There was no prophet other than uh yeah
[12:34] there was no prophet. John the Baptist
[12:36] uh was just in his mother's womb. And so
[12:39] God needed to speak uh to Mary's
[12:41] husband, Joseph. Well, God had no
[12:43] prophet to anoint. So what'd he do? He
[12:46] sent him dreams.
[12:48] So if there's no prophet today, God's
[12:50] going to send us prophecies by dreams.
[12:53] Hallelujah. That's right.
[12:55] So we're thankful by God's grace. So
[12:57] brother Brandham tells us in in back in
[12:59] 1958 he said another thing that we
[13:01] believe the manifestation of the spirit
[13:03] is given to every man to profit with
[13:06] all. Now we believe that when these
[13:08] gifts and so forth are operating the
[13:10] church which we covet and desire that
[13:12] the people who are gifted by the spirit
[13:14] come and worship with us. So, we desire
[13:17] every gift of the nine gifts of the Holy
[13:19] Spirit. And we want them to operate, but
[13:22] if they get wrong, then you have to
[13:24] repent of that and say, "I got an evil
[13:27] spirit. God, forgive me. Get this evil
[13:29] spirit off me and let the Holy Spirit
[13:31] return to me so the gift can operate." I
[13:34] saw it one time, church, I saw it one
[13:36] time in North Carolina. Malachi was
[13:37] there. He probably don't remember so
[13:38] many years ago. It was
[13:41] 2017. I saw that operate. a sister come
[13:45] up and the the pastor, we were all at
[13:48] the altar praying and I was at the altar
[13:50] praying. The pastor there, uh, Brother
[13:52] Humes and right as we're praying, a
[13:54] spirit a spirit got on a young sister.
[13:57] She was maybe 18. Yeah. She'd already
[13:59] graduated and she come up and she
[14:01] literally tried to pull the microphone
[14:03] away from the pastor. Now, you know
[14:04] that's a dominating spirit. That's a
[14:06] Jezebel domination spirit. She's trying
[14:09] to pull it away. She don't ask, "Can I
[14:10] have it?" She demands it. Right? Right?
[14:13] Just like when dominating female
[14:14] spirits, they demand to get their way.
[14:17] Right, sisters? Right, brothers? If you
[14:20] demand your way, you might have the
[14:22] wrong spirit. You might have the Jezebel
[14:24] spirit. But the the humble spirit will
[14:27] say, "I would like to do this. Is it
[14:28] okay? Could we please do this, right?
[14:31] Ask for permission, not demand the way."
[14:34] But the 18-year-old demanded uh the
[14:36] microphone. And the pastor, he just I
[14:37] like I just admired it. He stood there
[14:39] and he's like, "No, sister. No, sister."
[14:42] But she still shouted in the microphone.
[14:44] She's trying to grab it. She still
[14:45] shouted, "Uh, in the name of the Lord,
[14:48] uh, this sister should not date or or
[14:51] court this brother." So, there was a
[14:52] there was another young sister,
[14:55] uh, one of her friends that was courting
[14:57] this this this young man. And she was
[14:59] trying to warn her friend not to court
[15:02] that man. Now, I don't know the details.
[15:05] I don't know if that was right or or
[15:07] not, but it was out of order, right? And
[15:11] when after the service was all over, we
[15:12] went in the office and the sister bowed
[15:14] her head and she repented for trying to
[15:16] take the microphone. Now, that's a
[15:17] humble person right there. Most people
[15:19] will storm out and say, "Well, I'll just
[15:20] go to another church. If if you if you
[15:22] don't believe I'm led by the spirit,
[15:23] I'll just go somewhere
[15:24] else." That's right. And I appreciated
[15:28] the humility of that 18-year-old sister.
[15:30] So, yes, I was I was wrong. I was all
[15:32] worked up. I was all I felt the spirit
[15:34] of God tell me to give that message, but
[15:36] I went about it the wrong way. And she
[15:40] repented right there in tears. I was I
[15:41] was learning. Boy, I was like my eyes
[15:43] are open. Wow, this is great. Let me
[15:44] learn here. I feel like I'm living in
[15:45] the Bible days, the book of Acts.
[15:48] Hallelujah. It was a great experience.
[15:51] We desire all the gifts to move, but if
[15:53] you get it wrong, we also desire you
[15:55] repent.
[15:57] Hallelujah.
[15:59] And it takes a real humble person to
[16:00] repent, right? It takes a real Christian
[16:02] to
[16:04] repent. And now here, remember this. And
[16:06] then when you come in the body of
[16:08] Christ, there's nine spiritual gifts. It
[16:09] goes into every local body. So here
[16:11] amongst even our small church like this,
[16:13] all nine gifts are here. They're they're
[16:16] all somewhere, right? You say, "Well,
[16:19] Brother Jess, why haven't we heard
[16:20] tongues lately or or interpretation or
[16:22] even a prophecy?" Well, it's because
[16:23] either the it's either two things,
[16:25] right? Either it's not God's time or the
[16:27] person's not in tune with the Holy
[16:28] Spirit. So what do you do? You just wait
[16:31] on the Lord. Wait on the Lord. He'll
[16:33] renew your strength. Hallelujah. Just
[16:36] wait on God. Hallelujah. We can't make
[16:38] God move. It's not for us to make God
[16:41] move. It's for us to be moved by God.
[16:43] Hallelujah.
[16:45] Just like the woman, just like we're
[16:46] saying, the woman don't tell the man
[16:48] what to do. The man tells the woman what
[16:50] to do in love. And Jesus is the husband
[16:53] and we're the wife. And so we wait for
[16:55] Jesus to lead us into gifts. Hallelujah.
[16:59] And church, Jesus will always be on
[17:01] time. Amen. Hallelujah. He won't be off
[17:04] time. He'll always be right on time. And
[17:07] then he says, "And those gifts that
[17:08] you're to pray for, to pray for the gift
[17:11] of speaking with tongues or the gift of
[17:13] interpretation of tongues or these other
[17:15] gifts that goes into the church, pray
[17:17] for the gifts of healing. Pray for the
[17:19] gifts of miracles and so forth. That's
[17:22] the ones that you pray for and the
[17:24] spirit comes on and works in each local
[17:26] assembly to the perfection of the
[17:29] church." Hallelujah. Now remember,
[17:30] perfection means maturation or maturing.
[17:34] It doesn't mean we never sin. It means
[17:37] we're we're overcoming sin. Amen. We're
[17:40] overcoming sin, able to live above sin,
[17:43] and we become mature Christians. We
[17:45] don't remain babies.
[17:47] That complain when we don't get our way
[17:49] or we try to intimidate and and try to
[17:52] dominate other people. That's baby
[17:54] Christianity. Paul says it in Hebrews
[17:56] chapter 5. Let's not be babes just
[17:58] drinking on milk all the time. Let's be
[18:00] mature believers who can handle the meat
[18:02] of the word. Hallelujah.
[18:04] Amen. Now, let's review the nine gifts
[18:07] of the Holy Spirit. I trust that
[18:08] somebody maybe today can recognize which
[18:10] gifts you have in your life. You know,
[18:12] just recently, I've just seen that in
[18:13] our church, we have gifts of
[18:15] healing. Remember, every music gift is a
[18:18] gift of healing. Just like David, David
[18:21] would play his harp and the evil spirit
[18:22] would leave. Hallelujah. So when people
[18:25] have like how many times as Austin sang
[18:27] and I've cried well that that's the Holy
[18:29] Spirit coming on me. That's a gift of
[18:30] healing. That's refreshing my soul.
[18:32] Right. Right. Same thing with Malachi
[18:34] playing and differentaca doing song
[18:36] specials as the people rejoice. Even
[18:38] yesterday the people were telling me up
[18:39] in Sheffield we love acacia singing. We
[18:41] love why it brings healing to them.
[18:44] The Holy Spirit heals through music.
[18:46] Praise God. That's right.
[18:50] And so, uh, and I feel like that's one
[18:52] of the safest ones to know that you got,
[18:55] right? It's pretty easy. You either
[18:56] gifted in music or you're not, right?
[18:59] Hallelujah. I can't play piano, so
[19:02] that's not my gift, you know. Now, maybe
[19:04] later on in life. No, not really. But we
[19:07] we only want to recognize the gifts that
[19:09] we have in our lives. Praise God. And
[19:12] then be able to live so close to Christ
[19:14] that Christ can anoint us to be used.
[19:17] And it's mainly going to benefit the
[19:19] body of Christ here. But of course, it
[19:20] can benefit benefit family and so forth.
[19:23] But we want it to benefit this local
[19:25] body.
[19:27] Hallelujah. So, we got the nine gifts of
[19:29] the Holy Spirit. And I just underlined
[19:31] the S. There's more than one gift. Like
[19:33] there's music, right? As we said
[19:34] earlier, there's anointing with
[19:36] oil, right? Uh there's speaking the word
[19:39] like Jesus said and the Roman centurion
[19:42] said, "Just speak the word." And Jesus
[19:43] said, "If you say to the mountain,
[19:45] "Move, it will move." If you've got a
[19:47] faith the size of a mustard seed.
[19:51] So that's spoken word faith like brother
[19:53] Brandham had the spoken word and brother
[19:55] brother Ram calls it the third pole or
[19:57] the third attraction to his ministry.
[19:59] Hallelujah. The third phase of his
[20:01] ministry speaking to storms. Praise God.
[20:04] Hallelujah. Speaking healings into
[20:06] existence. Hallelujah. It's not our
[20:08] power. It's God's power. Hallelujah. Yes
[20:11] sir. Then we have miracles and faith,
[20:14] prophecy, discerning of spirits,
[20:16] tongues, interpretation. Praise God.
[20:19] Now, I want to go through these here and
[20:21] uh just show again that we got we got
[20:23] all kinds of Bible proof and then so we
[20:26] start with the Greek. What's the word
[20:27] wisdom in mean in Greek and then the
[20:30] Bible examples and how brother Random
[20:31] preached this? Brother Random's ministry
[20:33] was to restore us back to the Bible.
[20:36] Brother Random doesn't point us away
[20:37] from the Bible to like a church creed.
[20:39] Brother Random points us to the Bible.
[20:41] Amen. Hallelujah. That's right. And so
[20:43] that's why we have uh we have the Greek,
[20:46] we have the Bible, and then we have a
[20:48] prophet of God pointing us back to the
[20:50] word of God. So the word wisdom means
[20:52] skill in the management of affairs,
[20:55] skill and discretion in imparting truth.
[20:57] So skill means it's at the right time
[20:59] and it's just the right word. And I told
[21:02] you that example, that 80-year-old
[21:04] midwife who told my wife, I really feel
[21:06] you need to go to the hospital now. And
[21:08] God, I believe God used that. I believe
[21:11] it could have saved my wife's life and
[21:13] baby Tulsi's life because we were just
[21:15] happy staying at home, right? We were
[21:16] late, but we're getting a little uh we
[21:18] were getting question. Should we go to
[21:19] the hospital or not? And she said, "You
[21:21] should go to the hospital, do this." And
[21:22] everything she said, that's what we did.
[21:24] We went from the lowest uh intrusive uh
[21:27] maneuver to the next. Now, the move
[21:28] maneuvers intervention. We went from the
[21:30] lowest level of intervention to the
[21:32] finally we had to do a C-section. And
[21:34] that's exactly what she said. She said,
[21:37] "Go there and go less, less, less, less
[21:39] and see what God has." So, we believe,
[21:42] my wife and I believe that was a gift of
[21:43] wisdom operating that 80-year-old sister
[21:45] who had long hair and still wore
[21:47] dresses. And the church said, "Amen."
[21:50] Not like these modern Jezebels that cut
[21:52] their hair and wear pants and wear
[21:53] makeup and all these things like that.
[21:54] Now, nothing I'm not I'm not bashing
[21:56] them. I'm just saying most women are
[21:58] under that spirit of Jezebel.
[22:00] Hallelujah. That's right.
[22:03] Now, Bible wisdom is declared through
[22:06] the works or actions that follow it. So,
[22:08] let's read that. Malachi, would you read
[22:09] that? Matthew 11:19. Read that for us if
[22:11] you got your Bible. And then, Patrick,
[22:14] why don't you get Proverbs 9:1? Claude,
[22:16] can you read that? You get Matthew 7:24.
[22:18] We'll get some readers here helping us
[22:20] out here today by God's grace. I'll just
[22:21] go slow through this. I'm not going to
[22:22] rush through this. I think this is going
[22:23] to help you by God's grace. I know it's
[22:25] going to help you because it the word of
[22:27] God can do nothing but help you. Praise
[22:28] God. If you're a true believer. So,
[22:31] Malachi. Yeah. Go ahead. Matthew 11:19.
[22:43] All right. And the church said, "Amen."
[22:46] Wisdom is justified of her children. So
[22:48] wisdom is seen through its results.
[22:52] Praise God. So if somebody gave you a
[22:54] word of wisdom and you follow that
[22:56] advice, that godly advice, you'll see
[22:58] the results honored God. And that's a
[23:01] gift of wisdom. And brother Ram said, of
[23:03] course, wisdom is the best gift of the
[23:05] group. See, wisdom will help you know
[23:08] how to use all the other eight gifts.
[23:10] Hallelujah. The wisdom of God. And so,
[23:14] it's so crucial to have wisdom. All
[23:15] right, brother Patrick, you want to get
[23:16] that? Proverbs 9 vers1.
[23:25] Amen. Praise God. So, wisdom builds the
[23:28] house. Hallelujah. Now, I've never built
[23:31] a house. Has anybody here built build
[23:33] built a house before? No. Okay. So, none
[23:36] of us know. But we've all seen it. They
[23:38] got to get the materials there first
[23:40] before they build. Now, the materials
[23:42] are knowledge. But wisdom is actually
[23:45] putting those materials and making it a
[23:47] reality of them. Praise God. Doing
[23:49] something with the knowledge.
[23:52] Hallelujah. So wisdom to it's easy to
[23:55] talk about the word but it's difficult
[23:58] to put it in place in your life.
[23:59] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. In other words,
[24:02] it's more challenging what when a
[24:03] decision comes up when a fork in the
[24:05] road comes forth. Do I move to Indiana
[24:07] or not? Right. I just Okay. Uh do I go
[24:11] to college or not? You know, okay. Now,
[24:14] well, wow. Now I need the wisdom of God
[24:16] because I have I mean God could bless.
[24:18] We have all these scriptures. God could
[24:19] bless either way. But what does God want
[24:21] to be done? And so that's where you got
[24:24] to seek God and God will lead you in one
[24:26] path or the other. And then the results
[24:29] looking back later will say, "Oh yes,
[24:30] praise the Lord. I'm so thankful I did
[24:32] that. Praise God. God gave me the wisdom
[24:35] at the right time." Wisdom builds the
[24:37] house. Wii wisdom builds the testimony.
[24:41] Our testimony because I'm talking about
[24:42] your house, my house, our spiritual
[24:45] house, our spiritual
[24:47] testimony. Okay? And then the wise man
[24:49] builds it on a rock. Uh, go ahead,
[24:50] brother Claude. Matthew 7:24.
[25:04] All right, let's say praise the Lord,
[25:05] can we? Praise the Lord. So, a wise man
[25:07] builds his house on the rock. So, of
[25:10] course, rock is a revelation. Jesus told
[25:12] Peter, upon this rock, on this
[25:14] revelation, I'll build my church and the
[25:17] gates of hell cannot prevail against it.
[25:18] It also applies to wisdom, right? So,
[25:20] revelation and wisdom are very closely
[25:22] connected. Praise God. Because wisdom
[25:25] builds the house, right? Hallelujah. And
[25:28] our testimony is founded on the rock of
[25:30] the revelation of the word. So, they're
[25:32] very closely uh connected there by God's
[25:36] grace. Now, one time I went
[25:39] um I think I have two examples in my
[25:41] book. One time a pastor called me up and
[25:44] said, 'Brother Jesse, he said, 'This
[25:46] other uh brother has come in here and
[25:48] he's criticizing me about my children,
[25:51] what events I allow my children to be
[25:53] involved in, and he's calling me a bad
[25:56] father and all these things. And he he
[25:59] wasn't asking for my wisdom, right? But
[26:02] uh and it's a gift. It's not mine, it's
[26:04] God's anyway. And on the phone, I just
[26:06] studied wisdom. And I just studied uh
[26:09] what you allow your children to do. And
[26:10] in that in that moment in the phone
[26:12] call, I just felt the anointing of the
[26:13] Holy Spirit come. And I gave him all
[26:15] these quotes from Brother Brandham about
[26:18] how you can have hobbies, right? As long
[26:20] as they don't interrupt with going to
[26:22] church. So I basically said, "Yes, allow
[26:24] your children all these things. Make
[26:26] sure these extracurriculars are not
[26:28] sinful." So like for us, we wouldn't
[26:30] allow our our daughters to go into a a
[26:33] sport where they got to wear pants,
[26:36] right? or he wouldn't allow uh my son to
[26:38] go into a martial art if it caused him
[26:40] to miss church.
[26:43] Right? And so I went through all these
[26:45] examples brother Brandham gave and he
[26:47] closed he closed the call by saying,
[26:48] "Brother, you just gave me a word of
[26:50] wisdom. I'm not under condemnation
[26:52] anymore." And friends, I didn't get on
[26:54] the phone call to give him a word of
[26:56] wisdom. I just got on the phone call
[26:57] because I loved him.
[27:00] I don't do a lot of phone calls. I got
[27:02] nine kids. I work a full-time job. But
[27:05] that was one time where the brother
[27:07] said, "You just gave me a word of
[27:08] wisdom." See, it allowed him now to act
[27:11] upon what he knew and to escape the
[27:14] condemnation of the devil. Praise God.
[27:18] The second one was I went to a a church
[27:20] one time and I preached on diligence.
[27:24] Peter said twice, "Be diligent to make
[27:26] your calling election sure in second
[27:28] Peter chapter
[27:29] 1." Okay? And I was showing all the
[27:32] investments of preachers, you know, we
[27:34] got to invest. If you have a one talent
[27:36] gift, invest in that one talent gift and
[27:38] make it two. If you've got a two talent
[27:41] gift, invest in that. Keep doing keep
[27:43] investing. If you don't invest, you're
[27:44] going to lose out on rewards. Now,
[27:46] church, I'm just going to share a simple
[27:48] example. Shame on me. But I've started
[27:50] two
[27:51] 403b accounts and I've stopped investing
[27:53] on both of them. Now, they're they're
[27:55] both they're they're both getting
[27:56] getting dividends, but not as much as
[27:58] they could be if I didn't stop giving on
[27:59] them. So, I'm telling all myself
[28:02] here now. And some of them, I mean, the
[28:04] stock market's doing good now, of
[28:05] course, but you know, it's a it's a
[28:07] long-term investment. I'm still getting
[28:10] some investment, but uh I'm not getting
[28:13] what I could, but that's natural. I want
[28:16] to make sure more than that money, I
[28:18] want to invest in my spiritual gift.
[28:20] Hallelujah.
[28:21] Because the rewards of that are
[28:23] tremendous. Jesus said, if you invest in
[28:25] a five talent gift and make a 10, you'll
[28:27] be ruler over 10 cities.
[28:30] Hallelujah. So church, make sure you're
[28:32] ruling over your gift. Dedicate it fully
[28:35] to God. In other words, rule over your
[28:36] life. Give your life fully to Jesus
[28:38] Christ. Amen. I told Malachi this
[28:41] before, but one of the most things I'm
[28:42] thankful for, Simon said it, too, is
[28:44] that he always comes to church and plays
[28:45] and he offers his gift to God. He never
[28:48] complains. He never says, "Dad, I don't
[28:50] want to lead songs. Dad, I don't want to
[28:52] play piano tonight." And for that, I'm
[28:54] eternally grateful. Hallelujah.
[28:56] Hallelujah. Because he could say, "No,
[28:57] Dad, no." I'm like, "Yes, you are, son.
[29:01] I would do that." He like, he knocked me
[29:03] down. He's so big and strong. But that's
[29:06] what I appreciate is that he's just
[29:08] willing to serve. And Lydia, same thing
[29:09] for Lydia. I can say the same thing. She
[29:11] never said, "Dad, I'm not I don't want
[29:12] to play the organ. I don't want to play
[29:13] that." She's always just submitted. So
[29:15] God richly blessed them. But but each
[29:18] one of us, if it's not music, you got to
[29:20] find your gift and dedicate yourself to
[29:22] God. Hallelujah. As brother said, some
[29:25] of your gifts are prayer and fasting for
[29:26] healing. That's the hardest one, church.
[29:29] Well, I say one of the hardest because
[29:31] it's all alone. Musicians, they get some
[29:33] type of a of a recognition, right? Even
[29:36] preachers, preachers get some public
[29:38] recognition, but there's really no
[29:40] public recognition for those who pray
[29:41] and fast. So, I believe God has a great
[29:43] reward. Jesus said, "If you pray in
[29:46] secret, I reward you
[29:49] openly." So, for healing, some people
[29:51] are called just to pray and fast. Like
[29:54] Jesus said, pray, give alms, fast. That
[29:57] might be your gift. You can just go
[29:58] longer with food than other people, but
[30:01] you're supposed to be because of that
[30:03] ability, you got to turn down meals,
[30:05] right? And your food has to be the word
[30:07] of God.
[30:09] Hallelujah. I've heard about people
[30:11] fasting for days, weeks. I uh remember
[30:14] Oh, yeah. One of the brothers, I didn't
[30:15] I didn't say it publicly. I didn't say
[30:16] the name publicly, but he said uh he was
[30:18] working his way up to fast seven days in
[30:20] a row with no food, just water. I'm sure
[30:23] you've heard of stories of people going
[30:24] longer. Well, I I've never met any of
[30:26] those people. So, the longest I've ever
[30:27] met is seven week or seven days. And I
[30:30] thought, wow, that's very admirable.
[30:32] That brother is able to do that in order
[30:34] to consecrate himself unto God. Not
[30:36] everybody's called to do that. Like Paul
[30:39] said, not all are prophets.
[30:41] Not all are pastors. Not all speak in
[30:43] tongues. Not all prophesy. Not not not
[30:47] all are evangelists. And the church
[30:48] said, "Not everybody's called to fast.
[30:51] But those who are, you should know it.
[30:53] You should have that ability. That's how
[30:55] you know you can do it because you can
[30:56] do it. Praise God. That's how you know
[30:58] you got the gift because you can fast
[31:00] longer than other
[31:01] people. And the way you know you have
[31:03] wisdom. God will give you something like
[31:06] I and Oh, yeah. And the other one. Yeah.
[31:07] I didn't ever finish that. I told the I
[31:10] didn't know in the church was sitting a
[31:12] brother on the front row who was about
[31:13] ready to quit preaching. He he he had he
[31:16] had prayed that morning before service.
[31:18] He said, "I'm done preaching. I'm just
[31:21] quitting.
[31:23] when I come in there and preach on you
[31:25] must be diligent. Don't stop preaching.
[31:27] Whatever gift you have, stay faithful.
[31:29] God will honor you. And he come up to
[31:31] the altar crying at the end of the
[31:33] service. He said, I was just ready to
[31:34] quit. But you gave me a word of wisdom.
[31:36] That's what he said. Not what I said. He
[31:39] said, "You gave me the word of wisdom to
[31:41] keep investing." And now church, I know
[31:42] this brother, he gets more invitations
[31:44] now to preach than ever before. But the
[31:47] devil tried to discourage him. You don't
[31:48] get any invitations. You're not
[31:50] preaching very much. And so the devil
[31:52] tried to convince him to give up.
[31:53] Church, don't give up on God.
[31:56] And now he's got more invitations than
[31:58] ever before. But you know, it's not all
[32:01] about invitations. It what it is, it's
[32:03] times and seasons. It's accepting God's
[32:05] will for your life in every season of
[32:07] life. Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:11] Just like let's go back to Mother's Day
[32:12] for a moment. How many read the Proverbs
[32:15] 31 on Mother's Day? Well, which one of
[32:16] you mothers are looking at fields and
[32:18] investing in in real estate right now
[32:20] while you're raising your children? Most
[32:22] of you aren't, but there could be a day
[32:24] where you could do that.
[32:26] Hallelujah.
[32:28] Like you, there's a time and season for
[32:31] everything in life. Praise God. But the
[32:34] devil the devil might try to uh
[32:36] discourage a mother. Well, see, you
[32:38] haven't bought any lands and you're not
[32:40] making your own clothes, and you don't
[32:42] cook all organic food all the time, so
[32:44] you're under condemnation. Tell the
[32:46] devil, "Get behind me, Satan." Amen. I'm
[32:49] doing the best I can in my season of
[32:50] life. And the church said, "Hallelujah."
[32:53] Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. You got to
[32:56] recognize which season you're of life
[32:58] that you're in and use the wisdom of God
[33:02] for that time and season. Hallelujah. So
[33:05] when someone gives you the right advice
[33:07] at the right time and you see the
[33:09] results of it, it hits perfectly. That's
[33:12] a gift of
[33:15] wisdom. Brother Ram said the first gift
[33:17] is the gift of wisdom. That is the best
[33:19] gift. Let's say best gift. Ready? Best
[33:21] gift. Really? Brother Ram said it's the
[33:24] best because it's first and it lines up
[33:26] with Proverbs, right? So brother Ram
[33:29] gives us Biblebased thoughts, right?
[33:32] Wisdom is the principal thing. The Bible
[33:35] says with all you're getting, get
[33:37] wisdom. It didn't say get miracles.
[33:41] Don't get miracles with all you're
[33:42] getting. Get wisdom with all you're
[33:44] getting. Now, how many people want
[33:46] wisdom? Praise God. We do, but there's
[33:48] very few people that want it. They'd
[33:50] rather have miracles, signs, uh, big
[33:52] crowds, you know, popularity. They'd
[33:55] rather have all that. I'd rather have
[33:57] wisdom because I want the what the Bible
[33:58] says. Praise God. And I'll be happy that
[34:00] way. Hallelujah. Amen. Like I was
[34:03] telling a brother uh yesterday, the
[34:04] Bible said, "Happy is the man whose
[34:06] quiver is full of children." I got nine
[34:07] children. My quiver is getting pretty
[34:09] full by God's grace. So if anybody ought
[34:11] to be happy here, it ought to be me.
[34:12] Praise God. I got nine. I'm very
[34:15] thankful for all nine of them by God's
[34:17] grace. And if we don't have wisdom, we
[34:20] know won't know how to use knowledge,
[34:22] which is the second gift.
[34:24] See, we study, we study the Bible, pray,
[34:26] pray, search, search the Bible. But if
[34:28] we don't have wisdom, we won't know what
[34:30] to do with the word.
[34:32] That's why wisdom is the principal gift
[34:34] like proverbs
[34:37] says. Second one is knowledge. Now this
[34:39] means understanding. So some people have
[34:42] a gift to understand the
[34:44] word right? They have a gift of
[34:46] knowledge and this can be a female too.
[34:49] Now she's not to preach with this
[34:50] publicly but she's to use it in
[34:53] fellowship and talking with other
[34:54] people, right? Because remember women
[34:57] now that's why it's hard for some men
[34:58] when women have gifts of knowledge and
[35:01] understanding. It's hard for some men
[35:03] because they feel like the woman's
[35:04] trying to take authority. Well, she's
[35:06] not as long as she's doing in a humble
[35:08] setting outside of the pulpit.
[35:10] Hallelujah. That's right. It's kind of
[35:13] like when Sarah Sarah told Abraham, "We
[35:16] ought to uh we ought to send Hagar away,
[35:18] right?" And Abraham's like, "Well, I
[35:19] don't know about that. Let me go to God
[35:21] myself." Right? And he went to God.
[35:23] What' God say? Yes. hearken unto
[35:25] Sarah. See, that's the gift of that
[35:28] that's a gift of knowledge and wisdom
[35:30] there. Maybe in Sarah's life. Somehow
[35:32] God had put a revelation in Sarah's
[35:34] heart. Knowledge. And she said,"Abraham,
[35:36] let's do this." Abraham goes to God.
[35:39] Yes. Do what? Do what Sarah said by
[35:41] God's grace. See, that's not Sarah up
[35:44] there preaching and Sarah taking a text
[35:45] and say, "Let me rightly divide this to
[35:47] you, Abraham." That's not what it
[35:49] was. You never see that in the Bible.
[35:53] Hallelujah. Glory. And notice this is a
[35:56] deep understanding. So men and women can
[35:58] have a deep understanding of God's
[36:03] word which go to the more advanced. See,
[36:06] I don't want to be a I don't want to be
[36:08] a uh a kindergarten Christian. I'll say
[36:11] like that. I want to be a mature
[36:14] Christian.
[36:15] Hallelujah. I want to be an advanced
[36:17] Christian. church. How many Christians
[36:19] today are in spiritual
[36:21] kindergarten? They don't know their
[36:23] ABCs. Always believe Christ. They'll
[36:26] take a creed. They'll take a a tradition
[36:29] of man uh they'll take a popular
[36:31] preacher's word above the word of
[36:33] Christ. That's right. Like a woman
[36:36] preacher or something like that, right?
[36:38] They'll take the they'll take some
[36:39] tradition above the word of God. It
[36:42] shows they don't have any knowledge of
[36:43] God. They How could they? How could
[36:45] they? They're rejecting the knowledge of
[36:47] God.
[36:49] That's
[36:51] right. So, uh, let's go to Luke 1. Get
[36:54] some. Brother Austin, you got the Bible
[36:56] there, brother? Okay. Lena, you got a
[36:57] Bible? Sister Z, you got a Bible? Oh,
[36:58] yeah. There you go. Uh, Brother Austin,
[37:00] why don't you get Luke 177? Lena, do you
[37:02] want to get Luke 11:52? And Sister Z,
[37:05] you want to get Colossians 1:9? And then
[37:07] why don't we do uh uh who's back there?
[37:09] Nature, you want to get uh 2 Peter 2:20?
[37:13] We're not going to get through all I can
[37:14] tell we're not going to get through all
[37:15] nine gifts today by God's grace. Okay,
[37:17] we'll just get as far as we can by the
[37:18] grace of the Lord. How many enjoying the
[37:20] word today? Hallelujah. I'm enjoying the
[37:22] word. I'm enjoying the worship and
[37:23] prayer. Hallelujah. Another word for
[37:26] knowledge. I'm sorry. Yeah. Is a key.
[37:28] It's a key of knowledge. That's
[37:30] according to the Lord Jesus. Okay. So,
[37:32] let's start there with brother Austin.
[37:33] Ready? Austin. Uh Luke 177.
[37:40] Amen. So, see, we need knowledge. So,
[37:43] word of knowledge. will somebody may
[37:45] have a word of knowledge and this is
[37:46] what I would say someone who's we call
[37:48] like a witnessing machine they'll get
[37:50] people saved just by sharing the gospel
[37:52] they got a gift of knowledge right
[37:54] knowledge unto
[37:56] salvation
[37:57] hallelujah so we see that like in
[37:59] brother Simon's life Austin is witnesses
[38:01] a lot as well when God opens up that
[38:03] door we we can't do it ourselves we got
[38:05] to wait on God right there just that
[38:07] knowledge to get try to get some people
[38:09] saved and the right water baptism and
[38:11] repent of their sins and uh the the
[38:14] understanding on repentance. Praise
[38:16] God. All right, Sister Lena. Uh Luke
[38:19] 11:52. I think this is the key here.
[38:24] Yes.
[38:31] Amen. And the church said, "Amen." So
[38:34] Jesus said, "There's such a thing as a
[38:36] key of knowledge that will allow you to
[38:38] enter in into salvation." So someone
[38:42] think about that brother since Benjamin
[38:44] came around with a key and gave you a
[38:45] key for salvation didn't he? He's like
[38:48] go talk to brother Jesse and go go go to
[38:49] the church right a key. He he gave you
[38:53] understanding to come into the to open
[38:55] the door so you could get
[38:57] saved. See church. So think about the
[38:59] person who won you to the Lord. God gave
[39:02] them a key of knowledge so you could
[39:04] enter into salvation. Praise God. They
[39:07] had some understanding that they gave
[39:09] you. Well, this is why here and this is
[39:11] what you need to do. You could get
[39:12] saved. Hallelujah. A key of knowledge.
[39:16] Praise God. Oh, now I understand. So for
[39:19] me, it was Simon's coming to me. Brother
[39:20] Jesse, you got to listen to serpent
[39:21] seed. And then it was water baptism.
[39:23] Then I was like, I got to memorize Acts
[39:25] 2:38. It's not baptism in titles,
[39:27] father, son, holy ghost. It's baptism in
[39:29] the name of the father, son, holy ghost,
[39:31] which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:33] Hallelujah. Amen. Understanding,
[39:35] knowledge. Oh, now I know. Praise God.
[39:37] And every time in the book of Acts,
[39:39] they're baptized in the name of the Lord
[39:40] Jesus Christ. Lord, Lord Jesus, Jesus
[39:43] Christ. It's it's all the same there.
[39:45] It's unlocking the mystery of who God
[39:47] is. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. Now,
[39:50] Colossians 1:9, sisters, there you got
[39:52] that.
[40:03] Excellent. Excellent. knowledge of his
[40:06] will and spiritual
[40:09] revelation. So see, knowledge, a gift of
[40:11] knowledge will allow you to get some
[40:13] revelation of the word of God. It'll
[40:14] open a door. You can get saved. And for
[40:17] me, it as I told you one testimony of
[40:19] mine. Uh it gave me the knowledge to
[40:21] overcome the addiction to tobacco that I
[40:23] was under. Okay. So let let me let's
[40:26] review again my key. I shared it with
[40:28] Austin. Uh go to if you got your Bible,
[40:30] go to 1 Corinthians 6:12. That was my
[40:32] key of knowledge. This is just my humble
[40:35] testimony. I didn't even know I was
[40:37] addicted to smoking and chewing tobacco
[40:38] as a Christian. And I didn't even know I
[40:40] could be free. I didn't even have the
[40:42] knowledge I could be free. And how many
[40:44] people are addicted to porn or gossip or
[40:47] bitterness or some other lust of the
[40:49] eyes, lust of flesh, addicted to money,
[40:51] and they don't even know they can be
[40:53] free. What do they need? A gift of
[40:54] knowledge. Praise God. They need you and
[40:57] I to come around and say, "You can be
[40:58] free. Let me give you some understanding
[41:01] that'll open a door for you." Praise
[41:02] God. Amen. That's right. So, my key for
[41:06] my deliverance from tobacco was 1
[41:09] Corinthians 6:12. Let's all read that.
[41:11] Ready? 1 2 3. All things are lawful unto
[41:14] me, but all things are not expedient.
[41:18] All things are lawful for me, but I will
[41:20] not be brought under the power of any.
[41:24] So, once I read that, I'm like, "Oh my
[41:25] goodness, I'm under the power of this
[41:28] plastic tin of tobacco.
[41:31] this this plastic little tin has power
[41:34] over me or this pack of cigarettes and
[41:36] now they're almost $11 per pack. This
[41:39] pack of cigarettes is p how is this more
[41:41] powerful than me? And what it did it
[41:43] unlocked their door like oh my that's
[41:46] not more powerful than me. I'm more
[41:48] powerful than that because it's not my
[41:50] power. It's the power of Jesus. Praise
[41:51] God. So I keep I keep quoting the word
[41:54] of God. keep believing. And that
[41:57] scripture unlocked the door of my
[42:00] deliverance.
[42:01] And church, if you're chained up or if
[42:04] you're addicted or got something you
[42:05] can't get over, keep looking for the
[42:07] right key. Hallelujah. The key is the
[42:09] word. Hallelujah.
[42:11] And the truth, the key of the word shall
[42:14] set you free. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[42:17] right.
[42:19] Glory. And so, see, that key of
[42:22] knowledge will help you escape sin.
[42:25] I think I'm over to nature. Nature, you
[42:27] got second Peter 2:20.
[42:55] And the church said, see knowledge, you
[42:57] escape the corruption of the world
[42:59] through the knowledge of the word of
[43:01] God.
[43:03] Hallelujah. So anytime somebody gives
[43:05] you a word now, a scripture or something
[43:08] that unlocks some mystery to you and now
[43:11] you can understand it because that's
[43:13] what knowledge means, understanding and
[43:14] a deep understanding.
[43:16] Now what God has just used a word of
[43:19] knowledge.
[43:21] Hallelujah. And this I think this one is
[43:23] uh underappreciated in the body of
[43:25] Christ. Everybody appreciates
[43:27] prophecies, miracles, tongues,
[43:29] interpretation. Everybody appreciates
[43:30] them. But I feel I feel this is
[43:32] underappreciated. But let me tell you
[43:34] today, I appreciate it because the door
[43:36] has been open to me.
[43:38] I'm not a slave anymore. I'm a free man.
[43:41] Hallelujah. Glory. And if anybody's ever
[43:45] been saved, you ought to be thankful for
[43:46] this gift as well because somebody gave
[43:48] you knowledge unto salvation. Praise
[43:50] God. Amen. Now, I want to drop into
[43:54] this. This is for people that study the
[43:55] ministry of brother
[43:56] Brandham. Brother Brandham kind of used
[43:59] uh he he kind of used gift of knowledge
[44:01] in two different ways. One way is the
[44:03] way I'm using it, which is this quote.
[44:06] But another way he used gift of
[44:08] knowledge, he kind of used that
[44:09] interchangeably with gift of
[44:11] discernment, which is the judging of the
[44:13] thoughts and intents of the
[44:15] heart.
[44:17] Okay? And so I just want you to know
[44:19] that. So if you go if you go type in
[44:21] gift of knowledge to search brother's
[44:22] quotes after you've read the Bible and
[44:25] the church
[44:26] said read the Bible first, right? And
[44:28] then take everything, brother when you
[44:29] read brother Bam, take everything, make
[44:31] sure it goes back to the Bible.
[44:32] Hallelujah. That's you you'll find
[44:35] there's there's like 12 there maybe 12
[44:36] or more. I looked this morning. I think
[44:38] it was 12. I can't remember the exact
[44:40] number, but there's like 12 hits where
[44:41] brother says God has given me a gift of
[44:43] knowledge to know the secrets. But then
[44:46] later he talks about gift of knowledge
[44:47] being something else. Like look like he
[44:50] says like an attorney who studies the
[44:52] books to present your case before the
[44:54] judge which is what which is what we're
[44:57] talking about. It's the studying of the
[44:59] word for a key that allows you to unlock
[45:02] freedom from the judge. Right? To set
[45:05] you free from the courthouse.
[45:06] Hallelujah.
[45:07] See what he's talking about. You got to
[45:09] study the books. Study the word to get
[45:10] knowledge. Understand the word. And then
[45:13] it'll set you free. Praise God. That's
[45:16] right. Okay. So, let let's read the
[45:18] quote. Here's where brother Bam says in
[45:19] 1957. A prophet is also a gift of
[45:22] knowledge. Okay. So, now he's gonna he's
[45:24] going to this is where he mixes them. An
[45:26] knowledge is like an attorney who
[45:28] studies the
[45:29] books. I tell you church, if you ever
[45:31] been involved in a court situation,
[45:33] you're thankful the lawyer has studied
[45:35] the books.
[45:37] Somebody's ever threatened to sue you or
[45:39] you ever went to court, you're thankful
[45:41] when your attorney knows the
[45:43] books, right? Because you don't want to
[45:45] be guilty. You don't want to be fined.
[45:47] You don't want to you don't want that on
[45:48] your record,
[45:49] right? And so that's like a gift of
[45:51] knowledge. You understand the word so
[45:53] much so you don't get trapped in
[45:55] something. You can escape through the
[45:57] opening of the door.
[45:59] Yes. And when you go to hire an attorney
[46:02] to plead your case, he's only talking
[46:03] what he knows or taking what he knows.
[46:05] And you're paying him for what he knows
[46:06] to present your case before the
[46:09] judge. Now, a gift of knowledge in the
[46:11] Bible is prophecy. So, here's where he's
[46:13] mixing them. Which goes up and finds out
[46:15] these things that are to come and brings
[46:17] them back down. But they must compare
[46:19] with the Bible with the book. If they're
[46:22] out of the book, then they're not
[46:24] received because the judge judges by the
[46:26] book.
[46:28] You see it? So it must be on the word.
[46:30] Hallelujah.
[46:32] Amen. Okay.
[46:35] Now, so here here's what I want to say
[46:37] here. Here here's and here's another
[46:39] example in 57. So now this is my
[46:41] opinion, church. I'm always I'm always
[46:42] going to try to tell you when it's my
[46:44] opinion where I could be wrong versus
[46:47] where I really believe it's right and I
[46:48] believe it's the absolute truth of the
[46:50] word. Okay? So this is my opinion. I
[46:53] believe brother Ram grew in his
[46:54] understanding between a gift of
[46:56] knowledge and a gift of
[46:58] discernment. Okay? Because he because
[47:00] here here's where he says, "A prophet is
[47:01] a gift of knowledge." Now, he just said
[47:03] it in the previous quote, too. I don't
[47:05] claim to be a prophet. How might I do it
[47:06] on time? Okay, 45 minutes. Praise God.
[47:08] I'm just his servant. I ain't no
[47:10] prophet. Now, but see, when the
[47:13] anointing when the angel would come,
[47:15] then he would say, "I am God's prophet."
[47:18] Hallelujah. So, brother was always so
[47:20] humble. He say, "I'm not a prophet." But
[47:22] when the angel come then the that would
[47:23] give him the anointing to say I am God's
[47:25] prophet.
[47:26] Hallelujah. But I'm just his servant
[47:29] gift of knowledge or whatever you wish
[47:31] to call it. It's God's gift. By grace he
[47:33] gave it because I had no merits to come
[47:35] from. Now I need some readers. So uh
[47:38] Caris got your Bible. Virtue got uh
[47:41] sorry Victoria got a Bible. Virtue got
[47:44] one.
[47:46] Okay. Uh Caris John 4:18 and 19. And
[47:51] then uh Victoria, Hebrews
[47:53] 4:12. I'll try to go an hour today. Does
[47:55] that sound okay to everybody by God's
[47:58] grace? I know people uh uh I I don't
[48:02] want to wear you out is what I want to
[48:03] say. I don't want to wear anybody out
[48:05] and I appreciate our visitors. And so
[48:06] usually I preach an hour and a half
[48:08] saints. So just bear with me. I get all
[48:10] this love and this anointing. I just
[48:12] can't get out of it, you know? I just I
[48:13] just want to stay here and pray all day.
[48:14] Praise the Lord. Uh brother says it's
[48:17] like heavenly places. you when you get
[48:18] in it, you don't want to leave it by
[48:20] God's grace. But I'm hoping this will
[48:22] produce more gifts in our lives and for
[48:26] us to know which gifts we do have in our
[48:28] lives. Amen. And again, I believe, you
[48:30] know, Austin and I have been texting
[48:31] about this. I believe it was very
[48:32] timely. He's starting to see some gifts
[48:34] in his life as well. Praise God.
[48:37] Yeah. But but now I believe Brother Bam
[48:40] grew in his understanding. He doesn't
[48:43] teach gift of knowledge as a prophet
[48:44] later in his
[48:46] ministry. Uh you won't find those quotes
[48:48] later in the ministry. It's earlier in
[48:50] the
[48:51] ministry. And because a prophet is a
[48:54] discerner of the thoughts intents of the
[48:56] heart. Okay? Now we see that in John
[48:59] 4:18 and 19. So Caris, you got it for
[49:01] us?
[49:16] Amen. And the church said, "Amen." Jesus
[49:18] discerns, judges her life, her spirits,
[49:20] and says, "Yeah, you're right. You that
[49:22] that man you're living with now, he's
[49:23] not your husband. You've had five
[49:25] before. And the one you're living with
[49:28] now isn't." And what did she say?
[49:31] Prophet. So, see, a prophet has the gift
[49:33] of discernment to judge the thoughts and
[49:36] intents of her heart. She was thinking,
[49:39] "Oh, that's she's thinking, well, I can
[49:41] answer that. I don't have a husband."
[49:44] But then Jesus told the secret, "You've
[49:46] had five." Hallelujah. Now, that's by
[49:49] vision, right? Jesus said, "The Father
[49:50] shows me everything that I do." Right?
[49:53] Hallelujah. Now, uh, Victoria, Hebrews
[49:56] 4:12
[50:18] All right. And the church said, "Now,
[50:20] what does the word do?" The word divides
[50:21] the three parts of your being. The word
[50:24] will be able to separate. Is this a
[50:25] thing in your body? Is this a problem in
[50:27] your body? Is this in your flesh? Or is
[50:29] this in your spirit, your mind, or is
[50:31] this in your soul? The word of God can
[50:33] tell you the difference. I need to find
[50:36] the quote. So, help me out saints this
[50:38] week. If you find the quote, "Brother
[50:39] Brandon one time had a a girl uh had a
[50:42] lot of uh who was paralyzed and the
[50:44] parents were like, "Cast a demon out.
[50:46] Cast a demon out." And the Lord showed
[50:48] her showed him in a vision, it wasn't a
[50:51] demon. It was she fell off a wagon and
[50:54] her vertebrae was out of joint, out of
[50:56] place. And so, Brother Ram told the
[50:58] father, adjust her go basically like
[51:00] chiropractor. Brother Ram said, "It's
[51:02] not a devil. See, it's it's a
[51:04] discerner." Amen. Brother saw it's not a
[51:07] spiritual problem. It's in the body.
[51:08] Hallelujah.
[51:10] Amen. And so the dad adjusted her. And
[51:13] then as soon as she did that, she's able
[51:14] to up walk
[51:15] again. Right? Hallelujah. Because that's
[51:19] what a prophet can do. A prophet can
[51:20] judge between the flesh, the spirit, and
[51:22] the soul. There's another example from
[51:24] years ago. You probably don't remember.
[51:26] Brother Tim Hatton. He's a pastor in
[51:28] North Carolina. He came to church and he
[51:30] told this awesome testimony. He said, "I
[51:32] had this pain and I could hardly walk
[51:34] and this pain in my foot and I kept
[51:36] cursing the, you know, I'm sorry, not
[51:37] curse. I kept rebuking the devil and and
[51:39] I had every preacher pray for me and it
[51:41] never got better." He said, "One day I
[51:43] was fellowshipping with this couple at
[51:44] my house with the kids around and he
[51:46] told his friend about it and his
[51:47] friend's like, "Yeah, take a seat. Let
[51:48] me let me look at your your your ankle."
[51:50] And he did something with the ankle and
[51:52] the foot just twisted it and the bones
[51:55] went right back in place. And he's like,
[51:57] he said he felt a wave of healing come
[51:59] over his entire body.
[52:01] And he said, "Oh, I got up and I'm I'm
[52:03] healed in Jesus name." But he tried to
[52:06] he thought it was a spiritual problem,
[52:07] right? Rebuking it. Rebuke. It wasn't a
[52:10] spiritual problem. It's a physical
[52:11] problem.
[52:12] But see, a prophet knows the difference.
[52:14] Praise God. That's why brother Ram said
[52:16] when people would come in the prayer
[52:17] line, Brother Ram would say, "Oh, you
[52:19] have a welcoming spirit on you. You're a
[52:20] real
[52:22] Christian." Right? He could sense that.
[52:25] That that means there was a Holy Spirit
[52:27] in the
[52:28] soul. Right? Right? And then he come to
[52:30] people and say, "Oh, you want healing,
[52:31] but you're not a Christian
[52:33] yet." Hallelujah. He said, "If you want
[52:36] God to heal you or do something, you
[52:38] first must repent and become a
[52:41] Christian." And then he would go in
[52:43] their minds. And and she would and the w
[52:45] the woman would say, "I have all this
[52:46] depression. I have all this anxiety."
[52:48] And then brother said, "Wait, I see a
[52:50] vision. You're a little child and you're
[52:51] being chased by a dog." And that's this
[52:55] fear that started what was that? A human
[52:57] spirit.
[52:58] Hallelujah.
[53:00] So you you and I can expect the same
[53:02] thing today. Hallelujah. By the word of
[53:04] God. The word of God will discern
[53:06] something in our bodies, in our spirits,
[53:09] and our souls. Amen. But the most
[53:11] important thing is make sure you have
[53:12] the Holy Ghost in your soul. Hallelujah.
[53:16] Make sure you have eternal life. Praise
[53:23] God. All right, I'm at 51 minutes here.
[53:26] Let's we'll finish with faith.
[53:28] Hallelujah. Faith. Faith. Let's finish
[53:30] with faith. So wisdom. Hallelujah.
[53:33] Knowledge. Gift of faith. Now this is
[53:35] what operated in our sister Naomi's
[53:36] life. That's according to my
[53:38] understanding of
[53:40] it. Okay. So in the Greek, faith means a
[53:43] conviction of anything or any belief.
[53:46] You just have this strong conviction.
[53:48] You've got faith. God's going to do
[53:50] something. Lydia, uh, Hebrews, no, I'm
[53:53] sorry. Virtue. Hebrews 11:1. Lydia,
[53:55] Matthew
[53:57] 17:20. That'll be the end of that one
[53:59] here by God's grace. End of today's
[54:01] service. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[54:03] All glory to God today.
[54:06] So faith is a conviction. And what does
[54:09] that mean according to the Bible? It
[54:11] means the anointing of God has come into
[54:13] your heart and you've got a substance.
[54:16] Let's say substance. Ready? Sub. You
[54:18] just got something in your spirit or
[54:20] mind. You have a substance here that
[54:22] knows. because you're convicted God's
[54:24] going to do something. That's the gift
[54:26] of faith. Like, brother Austin, I know
[54:29] God's going to move for you. Or sister
[54:30] Lena, I know God's going to do this. I
[54:32] really believe. That's a gift of faith.
[54:35] Hallelujah. Now, faith and uh prophecy
[54:38] sometimes overlap. There's a little bit
[54:40] of overlap there. But with prophecy,
[54:42] it'll always say in the name of the
[54:44] Lord. That's how you know. But a faith
[54:47] is just like, I know it's going to
[54:48] happen. Don't doubt, right?
[54:53] Because a prophecy can't fail, right? A
[54:56] real prophecy from God can't fail.
[54:58] Hallelujah. Oh, now we'll get into
[55:00] Brother Bam said the devil likes to try
[55:02] to trick us. So, we'll get into that
[55:03] maybe Wednesday night by God's grace.
[55:04] Satan will try to trick us. Is this the
[55:06] gift of God or not? And so, the way to
[55:08] know, wait on the Lord. He'll renew your
[55:10] strength. Right? The Bible said, "Wait
[55:12] on your ministry." Amen. Ro Romans
[55:14] chapter 12. Hallelujah. If you got a
[55:16] ministry, if you think God's calling you
[55:17] to minister and you're not sure, you
[55:19] better wait on that. Praise God. Just
[55:21] wait on it. Give it some
[55:23] time. Let things play out. Let God work
[55:26] things out. And wait till you're sure
[55:28] it's God.
[55:31] All right. Uh virtue. Hebrews 11:1.
[55:42] All right. And the church said the
[55:44] substance of things hoped for. It's the
[55:46] evidence of things not seen. What
[55:48] evidence do you have? Like I could have
[55:49] asked this me. What evidence do you have
[55:51] that that the the baby's going to be in
[55:53] the right position before we get to the
[55:54] doctor? What evidence do you have?
[55:55] Faith. That's my
[55:58] evidence, right? That that that's as
[56:00] simple as it is,
[56:02] right? And that's just a recent example
[56:05] of faith. Or like when I prayed for uh
[56:08] Zur and Vang's uh dad, I I said, "He's
[56:12] coming out of there. He's going to be
[56:13] completely well." Right? That's what I
[56:16] told brother Amen on the phone. Said,
[56:17] "He's coming out in the name of Jesus
[56:19] Christ. He's going to be completely
[56:20] well. Hallelujah. That's faith. How do I
[56:23] know? I don't know. I just prayed it. I
[56:24] just believe it. Hallelujah. It's a
[56:27] conviction. It's a substance that's
[56:29] entered into your heart.
[56:32] Hallelujah. Now, so faith is an inner
[56:35] substance and it's the evidence or proof
[56:38] that God's will is going to move a
[56:41] mountain and it makes all things
[56:44] possible. Amen.
[56:47] Matthew 17:20, uh,
[57:03] Lydia, hallelujah. The church said,
[57:07] brother Araham said, that's the gift of
[57:09] faith. They believe that they're going
[57:12] to receive what they asked for.
[57:17] Hallelujah. So, think about that,
[57:19] church. Has there ever been ever been a
[57:20] time you just prayed and you believed it
[57:22] was going to happen and then it
[57:24] happened? That's the gift of faith,
[57:27] right? It moves the mountain, right? You
[57:30] believe, you speak God's word. It's not
[57:32] your word. You and I have no power of
[57:33] our own, but it's God's word that you
[57:35] speak and God's word starts moving the
[57:37] mountain. Sometimes it's one stone at a
[57:40] time. Amen. Sometimes God picks up the
[57:42] whole mountain and moves it. Praise God.
[57:46] Hallelujah. It all depends on the
[57:48] testimony. It all depends on God's
[57:51] leadership in our
[57:52] lives, right? And that one when remember
[57:54] brother Brian Hawkins was here, that's
[57:56] the one that's uh uh fresh on my
[57:59] mind. We were at that meeting, Lydia was
[58:01] there and we're down there in the
[58:03] basement there years ago, must have been
[58:05] 2018 or 2019. And he said, "Brother
[58:08] Jesse, I got to have a double hip
[58:09] replacement." I'm like, "Brother, you're
[58:10] 45 years old.
[58:13] what do you need a double hip
[58:14] replacement for? And he's like, "Well,
[58:16] I've got degeneration in my hips." The
[58:18] doctors say, "You can never you can
[58:20] never get an improvement of degeneration
[58:22] of nerves." And something came over me.
[58:25] I'm
[58:26] like, "We need to speak the word of
[58:28] God." So I said, "Go get your pastor,
[58:30] brother
[58:31] Brian." He goes, "Get Brother Jim." I
[58:33] said, "Brother Brian, have you confessed
[58:34] all your sins?" He said, "Yes, yes,
[58:37] sir." I said, "Do you believe God can do
[58:38] it?" And this is right after the This is
[58:40] Yeah. 20 2020. I think this is 2020
[58:42] right after uh uh Sister Zur's dad came
[58:45] out of the hospital. Yeah. Because I had
[58:46] that fresh on my heart. It must have
[58:48] been that fall or that summer. I was
[58:50] like, "Wow, God just moved uh uh for for
[58:54] uh Zur's dad, Vang's dad." I said,
[58:57] "Let's speak the word." So I I said,
[58:59] "Okay, let's pray." And so I said, "I
[59:01] speak to those hips." I remember
[59:02] praying. We're crying. I said, "I speak
[59:04] to those hips in the name of Jesus
[59:06] Christ. I speak life into them." and
[59:08] church, life don't come back into g
[59:10] degenerating hips. That's not how it op
[59:13] operates. But God operates differently.
[59:15] Hallelujah. Amen. And we prayed and I
[59:18] said, I speak to the mountain of that
[59:20] degeneration and I command it to move in
[59:22] the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[59:25] That was Saturday night. Uh I was in the
[59:28] garden Saturday, Sunday, Monday,
[59:29] Tuesday. I was four days later. I'm in
[59:30] the garden. I got brother Brandon on.
[59:32] I'm listening to my present stage of my
[59:34] ministry or known my new ministry of
[59:35] brother Brandham. And I get a text from
[59:37] brother Brian. He said, 'I just got back
[59:40] from the doctor. The doctor said, "I
[59:42] don't know how your hips heal
[59:44] themselves, but you don't need a hip
[59:45] replacement anymore."
[59:47] He said, "Whatever you're doing, keep
[59:49] doing it." And I said, "Praise the
[59:51] Lord." Amen. God can heal hips. God can
[59:55] do anything. All things are possible
[59:57] when God gives us faith. Hallelujah.
[59:59] Amen. Every mountain can move by the
[1:00:02] power of Jesus Christ. Amen. See, I
[1:00:05] spoke to the mountain, but it wasn't I
[1:00:09] didn't premeditate it. I in that moment,
[1:00:10] I was just shocked like, "Oh, brother,
[1:00:12] you don't have to have a double hip
[1:00:13] replacement. You're 45." And he just
[1:00:15] turned 50, right? So, yeah, it would
[1:00:16] have been five years
[1:00:17] ago. Yeah. 2020. There you go. Praise
[1:00:21] God. And just in that moment, I'm like,
[1:00:23] "Brother, we saw this with uh Vang's
[1:00:26] dad. Let's just speak the word of God."
[1:00:28] And God heard it. Praise God. How many
[1:00:31] know God's faithful? Praise God. All
[1:00:33] right. Now
[1:00:35] closing. Faith is a gift of itself. You
[1:00:37] may have a portion of it, but there is a
[1:00:39] gift of faith. Now here's here's what
[1:00:41] brother's saying. Everybody needs faith
[1:00:42] to be saved, right? And it's a gift of
[1:00:44] God. It's not your faith. It's God's
[1:00:45] God's faith. So everybody has this gift,
[1:00:48] but a gift of faith in the nine gifts is
[1:00:51] something different. It's faith to speak
[1:00:53] to the mountains. Amen. Like Jesus said,
[1:00:56] if you have faith the size of a little
[1:00:58] mustard seed and don't doubt, that
[1:01:01] mountain will move in the name of Jesus
[1:01:04] Christ. You see, there's another measure
[1:01:06] of it. Hey, just like some of you people
[1:01:08] anoint the sick and pray for them. You
[1:01:10] have a result. That isn't a gift of
[1:01:11] healing. That's a portion of faith. But
[1:01:13] that isn't a direct gift of healing. For
[1:01:15] there's only one direct gift of healing.
[1:01:16] There's only one direct gift of faith.
[1:01:18] There's only one direct gift of miracles
[1:01:20] and so forth. Amen. Hallelujah. All
[1:01:23] right.
[1:01:24] How many more I got? Let's
[1:01:26] see. That's a lot. But it should
[1:01:29] shouldn't be too bad. I'll just hit the
[1:01:30] highlights. Brother Abraham said there's
[1:01:32] no people can I'm sorry. People who
[1:01:33] claim to have gifts of healing, gifts of
[1:01:35] healing don't mean you heal people. It
[1:01:36] only means you have faith in the word of
[1:01:38] God. Yeah. We no human can heal. Only
[1:01:41] Christ can heal. But Christ gives us the
[1:01:43] faith to believe that that that that
[1:01:46] person will receive it.
[1:01:54] Oh yeah, here's here's one. Yeah, here
[1:01:55] here's our brother says, "Yeah, David,
[1:01:57] he said said Jesse's got a son, David,
[1:01:59] back out there." Yeah, he's a divine
[1:02:01] healer. Sure he was healed by music. So
[1:02:04] what should Malachi and Lydia, what
[1:02:06] should their desire be to heal people
[1:02:07] through music? Austin, when Austin sees
[1:02:10] the song special, their desire should
[1:02:13] be, I I trust, Lord, you're going to
[1:02:14] heal somebody through this song. And
[1:02:17] church, it might just mean healed to get
[1:02:18] their joy back. They're so depressed or
[1:02:21] discouraged, but that song will return.
[1:02:23] They'll say, "Oh, God, forgive me of my
[1:02:24] depression. Forgive me of being
[1:02:26] discouraged. Now the joy of the Lord has
[1:02:27] returned. I'm healed." Hallelujah.
[1:02:30] I'm already getting the gift of healing.
[1:02:31] Praise God. That's for later on. That's
[1:02:34] what he did. He had a gift of casting
[1:02:36] out evil spirits. The Holy Ghost hadn't
[1:02:38] come in those days in the soul, right?
[1:02:41] Like John chapter 7 says, "So he cast
[1:02:43] him out by music, playing the words of
[1:02:45] the Lord. The Lord is my shepherd. I
[1:02:47] shall not want. He maketh me to lie down
[1:02:49] in green pastures. He leadeth me beside
[1:02:51] still waters. And it disturbed the evil
[1:02:54] spirits so much that they left Saul.
[1:02:57] Why? I hope there's my hour. I hope that
[1:02:59] happens today. I hope if you're battling
[1:03:01] evil spirits, they'll get so disturbed
[1:03:03] by the sweetness of the spirit of Jesus
[1:03:06] Christ that the evil spirits could leave
[1:03:08] you. Amen. Hallelujah. You don't have to
[1:03:11] live with evil spirits. Praise God. You
[1:03:13] can be free from evil spirits by the
[1:03:15] power of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Let's
[1:03:18] stand to our feet. Musicians can
[1:03:32] come. Let's do that song. Heal me, O
[1:03:35] Lord, and I'll be healed. Save me and
[1:03:37] I'll be
[1:03:40] saved.
[1:03:42] Hallelujah. God's word is true. God's
[1:03:46] word can never
[1:03:48] fail. We're standing on holy ground.
[1:03:51] Praise God. When the gifts of God
[1:03:54] operate, God gets all the
[1:03:56] glory.
[1:03:59] Hallelujah. And church, Jesus is here to
[1:04:01] set us to set all of us free. Praise
[1:04:03] God. We don't have to remain in sin and
[1:04:06] uh discouragement, as I said, depression
[1:04:08] or uh addiction. You don't have to
[1:04:11] remain in that. The gifts of God will
[1:04:13] give you understanding to open the door
[1:04:15] to your
[1:04:16] deliverance. There's one salvation where
[1:04:18] your soul's saved, but you might need
[1:04:20] saved or delivered numerous times in
[1:04:22] your life. And the church
[1:04:25] said, "Brother Brandham needed uh
[1:04:27] delivered from a lying
[1:04:29] spirit." Brother Random needed
[1:04:31] deliverance from a critical spirit, a
[1:04:34] prideful
[1:04:35] spirit. Hallelujah. Did he get it,
[1:04:38] church? Yes. If brother Random got
[1:04:41] deliverance, you and I can all get
[1:04:43] deliverance. We don't have to remain
[1:04:46] addicted to sin or trapped in a
[1:04:48] situation where we can't get
[1:04:51] out. The gifts of God. Brother Ram said,
[1:04:53] keep the church
[1:04:55] clean. How many want to live a clean
[1:04:57] life before God? That's what I want more
[1:04:59] than anything else, to live a clean
[1:05:02] life. I don't want to compromise with
[1:05:04] sin. I want to overcome sin. Hallelujah.
[1:05:07] by the blood of Jesus Christ, by the
[1:05:09] spirit of the living God. Let's bow our
[1:05:15] heads. Father God in heaven, we love you
[1:05:18] today, Lord God. It's been such a joy to
[1:05:22] pray, to worship, to dedicate this
[1:05:25] precious child,
[1:05:27] Levi, to hear the word of God. Faith
[1:05:30] cometh by hearing, hearing by the word
[1:05:33] of God.
[1:05:35] Lord, we're grateful for the scripture,
[1:05:37] Lord God, and you sending your prophet
[1:05:40] to point us back to the word of
[1:05:42] God. Gets us out of the denominational
[1:05:44] messes, Lord, that people get into, Lord
[1:05:47] God. Sets us free in Christ.
[1:05:51] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord God, for
[1:05:54] setting me free, Lord. I'm a witness.
[1:05:56] There's witnesses here today who've been
[1:05:58] set free by the power of the Holy Ghost,
[1:06:00] Lord God.
[1:06:04] So Lord, as you determine, just use the
[1:06:06] gifts. Lord, if you want to move today,
[1:06:09] Lord God, to set your people free. Maybe
[1:06:12] open a door of
[1:06:14] deliverance through a word of
[1:06:17] knowledge or give that timely advice on
[1:06:20] actions people need to take soon to give
[1:06:23] a word of wisdom, Lord, to their hearts
[1:06:26] or a gift of faith where
[1:06:28] someone believes the word of God and
[1:06:32] believes it'll come to pass.
[1:06:37] Father, we never want to try to
[1:06:39] impersonate a gift when your prophet
[1:06:41] said, "Lord, the skies are full of all
[1:06:44] the Pentecostal blessings." Hallelujah,
[1:06:46] Jesus. Thank you, Lord God. And Lord,
[1:06:49] you brought these few testimonies to my
[1:06:50] mind, my my remembrance, Lord
[1:06:52] God. I'm thankful, Lord God, you healed
[1:06:55] brother Brian, Lord God. He can preach
[1:06:57] today, Lord. Now he's an associate
[1:06:58] pastor, Lord, without amputated hips,
[1:07:02] Lord God. Thank you, Jesus, that he
[1:07:04] comes evangelized to us, Lord God. Thank
[1:07:06] you,
[1:07:08] Lord. Hallelujah, Lord. Thank you for
[1:07:10] keeping the brother preaching. He was
[1:07:11] going to quit, Lord God. Now he's busier
[1:07:14] than
[1:07:15] ever. Thank you for delivering the
[1:07:17] brother from condemnation, Lord God,
[1:07:20] through the words of wisdom. They're
[1:07:22] your words, Lord, not mine. This is just
[1:07:24] how we see them, Lord. Thanks for
[1:07:26] anointing that 80-year-old midwife,
[1:07:28] Lord, with the word of wisdom.
[1:07:31] Father keeps us
[1:07:33] clean, keeps us in your
[1:07:36] will, Lord. May faith be a substance in
[1:07:39] every heart
[1:07:41] today, Lord. And if we need deliverance,
[1:07:44] I pray we'll receive it today through
[1:07:46] the word of God. Bless your people,
[1:07:48] Lord. May we be more consecrated to be
[1:07:50] used of gifts of God. Lord, you can use
[1:07:53] from the youngest to the oldest here,
[1:07:55] Lord. You can use whoever you want to
[1:07:58] use, Lord.
[1:08:01] raise our faith today, Lord God, I pray.
[1:08:03] Help us to be mindful of the Holy
[1:08:05] Spirit, the presence of
[1:08:06] God in our midst today. We thank you for
[1:08:10] these blessings.
