[0:00] Praise the Lord. Matthew 11:25 and 26.
[0:05] Preach for about hopefully about 40
[0:06] minutes here by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[0:10] Thank you for the kind words about
[0:11] Sunday service. You know, I think that's
[0:12] when I'm the happiest is when I can
[0:14] finally yield to God and and God can
[0:16] speak to somebody through the service.
[0:18] So, that means a lot. Thank you to those
[0:20] people who shared how much the service
[0:22] meant. That meant a lot to me, too. And
[0:25] again, to see our Catholic friend there,
[0:26] just the way he was touched. Yesterday I
[0:29] was trying to get to my workout, right?
[0:30] And he just start kept talking to me for
[0:32] about 30 minutes. I'm like, when am I
[0:33] gonna get to my workout? I was like,
[0:36] just testify, brother. Just testify.
[0:39] He just had a wonderful time in the
[0:40] Lord. So, just keep him in prayer. He's
[0:42] 19, you know. And um he he asked me,
[0:45] Jesse, what about denominations,
[0:46] non-denomination? I said, brother, I
[0:48] said, you accept all the word of God
[0:50] that you know, and the Holy Ghost will
[0:52] guide you into all truth. I didn't feel
[0:55] led to bash Catholicism. Although I
[0:58] always bash the system, I never want to
[1:00] bash the people.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Ram taught us. And
[1:03] there, you know, there are times people
[1:05] can accept a rebuke, but he was telling
[1:06] me how people have rebuked him. So I
[1:07] was, I didn't feel the Lord to rebuke
[1:09] him right there.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; Um, but I said, "Brother," I said, you
[1:13] know, we differ. I'm not Catholic. I
[1:15] said, "But if you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:18] if you're into the Holy Ghost, the Holy
[1:19] Ghost will guide you into the truth you
[1:21] need to accept." And so I said, you just
[1:23] got to come to the spot with with every
[1:24] question. It's a chance. Am I going to
[1:26] let God take me deeper or am I going to
[1:29] stop right there? So just keep it in
[1:31] prayer or keep him in prayer. You know,
[1:33] I shouldn't say that. Let's just I'll
[1:34] try to remind you to pray for him. Okay.
[1:36] Hallelujah. I mean, so many people ask
[1:38] us to keep them in prayer. After a few
[1:40] weeks, I forget, right? U so we just try
[1:42] our best by God's grace to remember as
[1:44] the Holy Spirit will bring remembrance.
[1:47] Hallelujah. So Matthew 11, I'd like to
[1:49] speak on God hiding in himself in
[1:50] simplicity. Part three. Uh, part one was
[1:53] back in December of 2024 and part two
[1:56] was January 5th. I took about an eighth
[1:58] month long vacation from this series. I
[2:01] want to get back to it here by God's
[2:02] grace. So, Matthew 11:25 and 26. I've
[2:04] been studying off and on all these eight
[2:06] months. I've been going back to it,
[2:07] going back to waiting for the right
[2:08] time. Uh, so I hope this is a a timely
[2:11] sermon here by God's grace.
[2:15] This is one time where clearly uh you we
[2:17] can see Jesus thanking his heavenly
[2:19] father. Hallelujah.
[2:21] Just a nice expression of the emotions
[2:23] of Jesus, the uh the humanity of the
[2:26] Lord Jesus. We can see it here. We would
[2:29] say, well, what would Jesus thank God
[2:30] for? Of course, everything. But in this
[2:32] case, we get to see it. He thanks him
[2:34] because God has hid it from the eyes of
[2:37] the wise and prudent and reveal it unto
[2:39] babes.
[2:41] Imagine that. I thank God that God hid
[2:44] it from all those people that drove by
[2:45] our church tonight. Thank God. I mean,
[2:47] we we we would hope they'd come in,
[2:49] right? But Jesus, now we want some of
[2:51] them to come in, but Jesus, thanks God.
[2:54] Thank God it's hidden from them. And
[2:55] there's a people that's received the
[2:57] revelation.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, thankful for who has
[3:00] received it. Are you thankful you
[3:02] received the truth?
[3:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's one of the most
[3:05] things I'm thankful for. Hallelujah. So,
[3:07] let's read that together. Let's read
[3:08] this Psalm three. One, two, three. At
[3:11] that time Jesus answered and said,"I
[3:14] thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven
[3:17] and earth, because thou hast hid these
[3:20] things from the wise and prudent, and
[3:23] hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[3:26] Father, for it seemed good in thy
[3:29] sight." Did I say that wrong? It seemed
[3:30] good in thy sight. Amen. Let's have one
[3:32] more word of prayer. Father God, we
[3:34] thank you for tonight, Lord. Thank you
[3:35] for these songs. We're holding to your
[3:36] unchanging hand, Lord Jesus. Your nail
[3:38] scarred hand. we'd say spiritually we're
[3:40] holding on to it, Lord God, trusting in
[3:42] you, the living God. So Lord, just bless
[3:45] us here tonight in this short amount of
[3:47] time, Lord. We know you can do great
[3:48] things even in a short time. So bless us
[3:50] here. Give Malachi strength for
[3:52] tomorrow, Lord God, as he gets up so
[3:53] early. Give him strength, especially in
[3:55] the spiritual realm, Lord God, that he
[3:57] can overcome, Lord, the influences at
[4:00] work, Lord God. And Lord, refresh his
[4:02] mind and body. And Lord, for everyone
[4:04] else, Lord, uh the the children and the
[4:06] mothers, Lord, getting the children
[4:07] ready for school and the homeschooling,
[4:09] Lord, and Lord, just uh refresh the
[4:12] mothers, Lord God, with the little
[4:13] babies and and all the students that
[4:15] they can give their best for tomorrow as
[4:17] well, Lord God. And I'll need your help,
[4:19] too, heading back to the classroom
[4:20] tomorrow. So, Father, just uh touch each
[4:22] and every one, Lord God. We've all got
[4:24] work to do. We've all got things we got
[4:26] to get done. So, Lord, may we just put
[4:27] them in the right order, put you first,
[4:29] and Lord, everything else will be added
[4:31] unto us, Lord God. So bless us as we're
[4:34] gathered in your divine presence in
[4:36] Jesus Christ's name. And the saint said,
[4:38] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're being
[4:39] seated. Praise God. Let me just review
[4:42] real briefly. Uh
[4:45] so can you can you switch over? Hope
[4:48] this works here by God's grace. Since
[4:51] it's been eight months since I was
[4:53] preaching on this series, there's a song
[4:55] we sing. Maybe we'll sing at the end.
[4:57] Okay, brother Brandham, they wrote this
[4:59] song after hearing the sermons of
[5:00] brother Brandham and they said, "I just
[5:01] want to thank you." So I preach on
[5:03] recognizing your day and its message,
[5:05] serpent seed, perfect faith, all all
[5:07] these are sermons preach preached by
[5:08] brother Brandham. The breach between the
[5:10] church ages the seven seals, the message
[5:12] of grace, the coming of the Lord, the
[5:15] rapture mystery, and I've only taught or
[5:17] preached two sermons on this sermon.
[5:19] Brother Brandon preached God hiding
[5:20] himself in simplicity, then revealing
[5:22] himself in the same. I wanted you when
[5:25] you listen to this song to have an
[5:26] appreciation for this song.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now church, this is a six
[5:30] and a half hour sermon. Brother Rod, did
[5:32] you ever hear a six and a half hour
[5:33] sermon?
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, I do I do take that back.
[5:36] It's break broken up into two parts.
[5:38] One's three hours. He preached it, you
[5:40] know, the morning service. They took a
[5:42] break by 2 p.m. they were back in the
[5:44] service. So, quick lunch back. He's
[5:47] preaching from 2 to 5:30.
[5:49] Uh, but they put it, a lot of them put
[5:51] it on one tape. So, it's a six and a
[5:52] half hour long sermon. I've been
[5:55] listening to that off and on. The to me
[5:57] the highlight is the last hour where the
[5:59] Holy Spirit said, "Pick up your pen and
[6:01] write." And he goes writing about the
[6:03] bride and the word and about the Mount
[6:06] Zion showdown. Right? We've had the
[6:08] Mount Carmel showdown, uh the Mount
[6:10] Transfiguration showdown, and there's a
[6:12] Mount Zion showdown, Brother Ram says,
[6:14] which is the rapture.
[6:16] So, uh very good, uh Lord willing, we'll
[6:20] get to this these topics. Very good
[6:21] topics here by God's grace. Now, I'm
[6:23] preaching the sermon that brother Ram
[6:25] preached on Sunday, March 17th, the
[6:27] morning service. God hiding himself.
[6:29] That's the sermon I'm preaching right
[6:30] now. I already preached on the breach.
[6:32] Uh it was the week of the seven seals
[6:34] were revealed. This was a monumental
[6:36] week for brother Brandham. At the end of
[6:37] it, he says, "Thus sayeth the Lord."
[6:39] That's the interpretation of the seven
[6:41] seals. And we never heard a preacher say
[6:43] that before. Hallelujah. And we know
[6:45] it's right because there's no
[6:46] contradictions with any of these seals
[6:48] with the other word of God.
[6:50] Right? The same God that wrote all 66
[6:52] books of the Bible had the same thought
[6:54] in there. There's no contradictions on
[6:56] any word in the Bible. Hallelujah. Oh,
[6:59] that's another thing Brendan asked me.
[7:00] He said, "I noticed you use King James
[7:01] all the time, Brother Jesse. Why do you
[7:03] use King James all the time?" So, I got
[7:06] to tell him just a little bit. I said,
[7:07] "I don't condemn people that use other
[7:08] Bibles, but if you really did the
[7:10] research, those all those other Bibles
[7:13] other than the King James are missing
[7:14] scriptures." And the book Cam gave me,
[7:17] it just looks at, brother uh Chris, just
[7:19] 257 verses. There's over 10,000 verses,
[7:22] but this man only looked at 257.
[7:25] And in most of the other translations,
[7:28] 50 to 60 to 70, 80, sometimes 90% of
[7:31] those verses are missing in the other
[7:33] versions.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; And what does the devil want to do? He
[7:36] wants to add or take away from God's
[7:38] word.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; And a Catholic boy just receive it like
[7:41] that. He's like, "Okay, all right.
[7:43] Glory.
[7:45] I just I was asking for the Holy Spirit
[7:46] for wisdom. You know, I don't want to
[7:48] condemn him. I want to I want to rebuke
[7:51] Satan. Hallelujah. I want to condemn
[7:52] Satan. I want to rebuke the system that
[7:54] people are under. But I need the wisdom
[7:56] of God. Brother Rod told me a good story
[7:58] that actually lines up with that story,
[7:59] brother, about gorgeous George, right?
[8:03] So, in the story, the the the Baptist
[8:06] preacher is with a uh an atheist. And I
[8:09] could and Rod could tell you way better
[8:11] than me. He can tell you after service.
[8:13] He'd tell way better. But to make a long
[8:15] story short, the uh the atheist kept
[8:19] waiting for the Baptist preacher to say
[8:21] something about God so he could punch
[8:22] him in the face. But the the Baptist
[8:24] preacher was so in accord with the Holy
[8:26] Ghost, he didn't mention God the entire
[8:29] time they're out golfing,
[8:30] &gt;&gt; which would 18 holes would have been
[8:32] about
[8:33] &gt;&gt; three or four hours to do 18 holes. And
[8:36] then the end he asked him, "Why didn't
[8:37] you mention it?" And then God used that.
[8:39] The atheist starts asking questions and
[8:41] he got saved in the parking lot.
[8:43] And brother Rod got his I got his
[8:45] autograph on the Bible he gave me.
[8:49] Amen. You heard his story. Amen.
[8:51] Beautiful testimony about you just got
[8:53] to be led of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Wait. Jesus said it's like a living
[8:58] water springing up in you. Wait till God
[9:01] springs it up into you. Praise God.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; And church. Don't don't don't don't be
[9:05] discouraged. If you got nothing to say,
[9:06] then God didn't want you to say
[9:07] anything. But if you're led by the Holy
[9:09] Spirit, if you surrender to the Holy
[9:11] Spirit, then God will give you what to
[9:13] say in that hour.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I went through this uh
[9:18] and Brother Ram gave a prophecy about
[9:20] the seven seals
[9:22] uh in the name of the Lord. He talked
[9:24] about seeing this uh snow white pyramid
[9:28] and then the angel would meet him uh and
[9:30] he thought it was his death but he found
[9:32] out later that it was his uh
[9:34] commissioning a furthering of his
[9:36] ministry into the third phase of his
[9:38] ministry and that's the picture that was
[9:39] taken science can't explain it now
[9:42] people try to say it's a Thor rocket now
[9:44] but the scientists of that day most of
[9:46] them thought it was supernatural and
[9:48] then we have a scientist or I'm sorry a
[9:50] uh a man who works with water today he
[9:53] did six-hour presentation on how this
[9:55] has to be supernaturally formed. Praise
[9:57] God. So, you can either take the world's
[10:00] word or a man who spoke with thus sayith
[10:02] the Lord. I'll take the man who spoke
[10:03] with thus sayeth the Lord.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because what he said came to
[10:07] pass with the seven seals. Praise God.
[10:10] But remember in the first part we looked
[10:11] at Brandham Tabernacle. This was uh
[10:13] before the 1963 renovation. Very small
[10:16] humble church. Uh 1963 March right
[10:19] before this. Right. Yeah. Right. Right
[10:22] after No, I'm sorry. Right before this
[10:23] sermon was preached, it had a 30%
[10:26] expansion to what it looks like now. So,
[10:28] it expanded 30% this way. I forget how
[10:31] many it seats. I think 300 or 400, I
[10:33] can't remember. Okay. Uh but but brother
[10:36] man talked about how uh a pastor is like
[10:38] a lily, right? He's got to open up his
[10:40] heart and and let the the the bees and
[10:42] the bugs, and I'm not calling you bugs.
[10:44] Amen. And I'm not calling myself a lily
[10:46] either. But you you come in and you let
[10:48] people
[10:49] &gt;&gt; get refreshed on what God has made real
[10:51] to you. And that's what Sunday was
[10:53] about. Praise God with brother uh
[10:55] Brendan being here. Okay. So I I'll
[10:57] that's all I had really as far as the
[10:58] review.
[11:00] But that's what we have to do. And
[11:01] that's all of us. All of us are supposed
[11:03] to be able to spend time with the Lord
[11:04] and then when we go out in the public,
[11:06] people are supposed to draw something
[11:08] off of us,
[11:09] &gt;&gt; right? Another the other example is
[11:11] fruits. You're supposed to produce
[11:12] fruits of the spirit. So when people
[11:14] need love, they can get some fresh love
[11:16] from you.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; When they get some longsuffering, you
[11:20] got it. when they need some patience,
[11:23] you got it as well. Amen. I heard a
[11:25] little kindergarter say today, he was
[11:27] talking to his teacher. He said, "I used
[11:29] to be not patient, but now I'm patient."
[11:32] I thought, "Good." He's got a good
[11:33] understanding of the what what'll happen
[11:35] when he gets the fruits of the spirit.
[11:37] So, the first day of school, he was not
[11:39] patient, and today he's patient.
[11:42] I hope we can look at our lives, church,
[11:43] and say, "There was a time I wasn't very
[11:45] patient, but today I'm patient with God.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; The word has spoken to me. God's spirits
[11:50] revealed things to me. I can wait longer
[11:52] for God to move.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[11:57] So, in part one, uh we looked at uh
[11:59] again we looked at Bram Tabernacle.
[12:01] Brother Bram was astonished with the
[12:03] renovations
[12:04] um and church. Remember, he was so
[12:07] dedicated to his children going to
[12:09] public school. He he left them out in
[12:11] Arizona with his wife so he could come
[12:13] preach the seven seals. And his children
[12:15] missed the opening of the seven seals.
[12:18] So that shows you a few things. How much
[12:19] brother Ram regarded education,
[12:22] &gt;&gt; right? And then a second thing, he
[12:24] didn't really realize how great these
[12:26] services were going to be. So God showed
[12:28] up in an amazing way.
[12:31] But we see how he made sure his children
[12:33] got education. They could read, they
[12:34] could write, uh they could understand
[12:37] education.
[12:39] And so many people uh are against it
[12:42] today. And I understand you got to stay
[12:43] away from the woke nonsense. You got to
[12:45] stay away from that. Uh, but you got to
[12:48] also you can't leave your children
[12:50] without education. You can't just hope
[12:52] they get it. You got to teach them.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; It's it's work to learn. Hallelujah.
[12:58] It's work. And you got to you got to
[13:00] have a better balance. If you if you're
[13:01] not putting much into education, you got
[13:03] to have a better balance. Uh, and I I'll
[13:06] say it like this. Whatever God or
[13:08] whatever you put into it, God will bless
[13:09] whatever you put into those children.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; Now, look at me. I'm not a smart man,
[13:13] but I've written two books for the glory
[13:15] of God. I still get testimonies.
[13:17] Somebody wanted to order some pastor in
[13:18] Michigan wanted to order a bunch this
[13:20] week and I so he was thankful for that
[13:22] and I'm thankful you know here we are
[13:23] six years later people can still enjoy
[13:25] the book. Hallelujah.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; It's still touching people still
[13:29] touching hearts. Hallelujah.
[13:32] And then uh brother Ram thank the people
[13:33] for their hard work and I gave you a
[13:35] virtual tour when uh brother William and
[13:37] I and Jose and Aaron went to Brandham
[13:40] Tabernacle. Praise God. I'd like to go
[13:41] back at sometime. I really want to take
[13:43] all my children there. I want them to
[13:45] see how humble brother Ram was. That's
[13:47] what I love about brother Bram. He was
[13:48] so humble. Praise God.
[13:51] And uh God kept the Brandham tabernacle
[13:53] from being burnt down. Remember that?
[13:54] And brother Ram said, "The beauty of the
[13:56] church is the character of the people."
[13:58] So listen church, we don't have a
[14:00] beautiful sanctuary. Now to me it is,
[14:02] but
[14:04] because I've been in some bad places.
[14:07] My wife has been in some bad churches.
[14:10] you know, just rundown small little tiny
[14:12] churches with water dripping through the
[14:14] ceiling and tile falling on the floor
[14:15] right before the service start. The tile
[14:17] falls on the floor. That's that's what
[14:19] I've been in. So, to me, this is not
[14:21] beautiful. The world wouldn't look in
[14:22] here and say, "This is beautiful." But
[14:24] when a Catholic walks in here, he says,
[14:26] "What a beautiful church you have."
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Because of how you treated him.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; So, that tells me it doesn't matter. I
[14:34] mean, we want to keep it as clean as we
[14:35] can. We have to repaint here pretty soon
[14:37] at some point. is awesome. Get ready,
[14:39] buddy. He did a good painting out there.
[14:41] I need some painters. Uh, get some
[14:44] construction workers around here, right?
[14:45] Okay.
[14:47] But we want to keep it as nice as we can
[14:49] as we financially are able. But the real
[14:52] beauty is people who love Christ.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; That's the real beauty.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; Then part two, I spent most of my time
[14:59] on the character. And I got a lot of
[15:00] good feedback on that where brother man
[15:02] talks about unless we suffer with him,
[15:04] we'll never reign with him. We uh
[15:06] character uh I'm sorry. Yeah, power
[15:09] without character is satanic. Brother
[15:10] Ram says he makes that beautiful uh a
[15:12] beautiful quotation. But power with
[15:15] character is fit to rule.
[15:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're living for. We're
[15:20] living today to rule over the flesh, the
[15:22] devil, sin, and the world.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; But we're ruling over this in order to
[15:28] rule over the world in the millennium.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Right. That that's part of our
[15:34] inheritance. Same rod. I love how Rod
[15:36] gave me that scripture about I might
[15:37] have to preach a sermon on that. Don't
[15:38] remove the landmarks because landmarks
[15:40] always mark your inheritance. If
[15:43] somebody moves it, you don't even
[15:44] realize you've lost your inheritance
[15:46] unless you go check the blueprint.
[15:48] Hallelujah. Or whatever it is. It's
[15:49] called the what would it wouldn't be the
[15:51] blueprint, but something like that.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; Survey. Yeah. The title deed or
[15:55] something like that. Something with the
[15:56] survey and the title deed. So, I like to
[15:59] get to that thought, too. But then we
[16:01] spent the rest of the time looking at
[16:02] that prophecy of the cloud. Uh because
[16:05] we believed it was Jesus fulfilling
[16:07] Revelation 10 1-7. He comes down a
[16:10] mighty angel clothed in a cloud.
[16:12] Hallelujah. So we believe that was the
[16:14] Lord Jesus visiting brother Brandham
[16:15] through seven angels to tell him to go
[16:17] back and preach the revelation of the
[16:19] seven seals. Now here we are uh now part
[16:22] three. This will be from uh I'm sorry
[16:24] some familiar but I'm just preaching
[16:26] again the highlights of what I've heard
[16:27] as I've heard brother Brandham preach
[16:29] this sermon now numerous times if you
[16:31] have your Bibles 1st Chronicles 16:25
[16:34] Hunt um brother Brandham takes the next
[16:37] so he takes the first 30 minutes and he
[16:39] goes through what I went through now he
[16:40] takes the next hour and he does a a
[16:43] rededication of the church he re he
[16:46] reded re rededicates Brandham Tabernacle
[16:48] just with a prayer
[16:50] but he takes about 58 minutes. I wrote
[16:52] it down about 58 minutes to remind
[16:54] everybody how to treat the sanctuary.
[16:57] Okay, so 1 Corinthians 16:25, for great
[17:00] is the Lord and greatly to be praised.
[17:02] He also is to be feared above all gods.
[17:05] Of course, we know those are false gods,
[17:07] right? Hallelujah. Uh and then now the
[17:11] the the notice greatly to be praised.
[17:13] That's why we give God our best praise
[17:15] here.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to fall asleep while I'm in
[17:18] the song service. I want to wake up and
[17:20] I I want my soul to say, "Wake up,
[17:21] body." Amen. Give God some praise. He's
[17:24] great.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's worthy of my song.
[17:28] Hallelujah.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; And I ought to give God my best.
[17:30] Hallelujah. Now, I don't have to go
[17:32] crazy. I don't have to uh lose my voice
[17:34] every service. I don't have to have I
[17:37] don't have to clap so hard that I bleed
[17:38] like I used to back in 2012. I used to
[17:41] clap so hard that, you know, then, you
[17:43] know, I got L got to take care of
[17:44] Lydia's ears, you know, and all things.
[17:46] I I don't got to be all just all crazy
[17:48] with it, but I want to give God my best.
[17:51] Hallelujah.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. The the main verse
[17:54] though, again, as a review, is Psalms
[17:56] 89:7. If you pull that up, honey, honey,
[17:58] God is greatly to be feared in the
[18:01] assembly of the saints,
[18:04] and to be had in reverence of all them
[18:07] that are about him. So, it's actually an
[18:10] Old Testament principle to show great
[18:12] reverence while you're in the house of
[18:13] God. Now, God's a God of reverence.
[18:15] God's also a God of love, humor,
[18:18] patience. That's why Brother Ram
[18:19] sometimes would make people laugh. I try
[18:21] to make people laugh sometimes to loosen
[18:22] you up.
[18:24] Um, but there's still it's it's it's
[18:26] humor in a reverent way. It's joy in a
[18:30] reverent way. Hallelujah. So, it's just
[18:33] a it's a different kind of humor,
[18:34] different kind of joy than we joke
[18:36] around maybe out in the parking lot or
[18:38] something like that. Uh, so God is
[18:41] greatly to be feared amongst us. Psalm
[18:43] 77:13. I guess I'll be starting with
[18:45] some verses, then I'll get into some
[18:46] quotes here. Uh some highlights here.
[18:49] Psalm 77:13, "Thy way, oh God, is in the
[18:54] sanctuary." If you want to know how to
[18:57] direct your life, you've come to the
[18:59] right spot.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to find it out
[19:02] there. You get some good ideas out
[19:04] there, but you're going to find the way
[19:06] of of God for your life coming to
[19:09] church.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That that's thus sayith the
[19:12] scripture. Hallelujah. Now, who I think
[19:15] of I can think of somebody else who's
[19:16] the way. He's the way, the truth, and
[19:19] the life. Hallelujah. Amen. So, the
[19:21] spirit of Jesus Christ is here in the
[19:24] church, in the sanctuary, in the
[19:26] congregation. Hallelujah. To show you
[19:28] the way God wants you to live your life.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; You're not going to find it other
[19:33] places. Brother Ram said, "If you got
[19:35] the Holy Ghost," he said, "you can't
[19:36] wait till somebody opens those church
[19:38] doors." And most people got a key. And
[19:40] Naomi, I got your key out there. So
[19:42] don't don't leave before I give you the
[19:43] key. I think she's the only tide parrot
[19:45] that doesn't have a key. Hallelujah. I
[19:47] got it on Monday, I think, after work. I
[19:49] got that key. Hallelujah. Now, thy way
[19:52] is in the sanctuary. Who is so great a
[19:55] God as our God? Hallelujah.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram says, "No buying and
[20:02] selling in the sanctuary." So, I don't
[20:04] really know any churches that do that.
[20:05] That must have been something happened
[20:06] around the 50s or 60s. I don't know
[20:08] anything about that. Uh, I've never seen
[20:10] buying and selling in the sanctuary. I
[20:13] guess I would imagine maybe preachers
[20:14] come and they try to sell their books.
[20:16] Maybe people used to do that. Is that
[20:17] what happened, brother? Did you ever see
[20:18] that? Okay. So, that's probably what
[20:21] brother's talking about.
[20:23] So, no buying and selling in the
[20:25] sanctuary. Of course, that's a
[20:26] scriptural uh principle because Jesus
[20:28] when he come to uh Herod's temple,
[20:31] right, uh he he he said, "My house is a
[20:33] house of prayer." Hallelujah. Not a den
[20:35] of thieves. Amen. Amen.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Now, if it takes you I I printed books.
[20:40] It takes to print a book. It's like, you
[20:41] know, if it's real thick, like my thick
[20:43] one, that might be a $6 book just to
[20:45] print it. So, now the thin ones, that
[20:48] might be a dollar to print that. Now,
[20:50] with inflation, maybe two. Okay? But
[20:52] anyways, the preachers get up there in
[20:54] the old days, I guess I'll say like
[20:55] this. Let's say it's a dollar to print
[20:57] it. And they'll sell, oh, just give a
[20:58] $40 donation.
[21:01] Now, you're stealing from God's people.
[21:03] What about the poor saints? And brother
[21:05] brother Ram's uh brother Ram's rule was
[21:07] this, brother Rod. If they don't have
[21:09] the money, give them the book anyway.
[21:12] Hallelujah. That's a man of God right
[21:14] there. Hallelujah. He told he he
[21:16] directed, you can hear it on tape. He
[21:17] directed it. If they don't have the
[21:18] money and they want a even a photo of
[21:20] the pillar of fire uh uh different
[21:23] pictures in brother's ministry, the Lord
[21:25] Jesus Hoffman's head at 30 uh or 33, he
[21:29] says, "Give it to them if they can't
[21:30] afford it." He said, "We're not here to
[21:32] make money. We're here to share the
[21:35] gospel.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Freely I've received,
[21:39] freely give." Hallelujah.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; I've always said that, too. If people
[21:42] can't afford a book, I'll just email
[21:44] them the PDF. Right? Then they got it.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Right. But if you can support the
[21:49] ministry, thank you for supporting it.
[21:50] But if you can't, we'll still send it.
[21:52] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, brother gets down
[21:55] here. He says, "Now, this may seem a
[21:56] little rude, but this is not a place to
[21:58] visit in here. And this is a reminder we
[22:01] need from time to time." Okay. Now, we
[22:03] do a really good job before service of
[22:05] not talking. Every now and then there's
[22:08] a a guest like Brendan. I was so
[22:09] shocked. Malachi helped surprise me with
[22:11] that one. And I just say, "Brother,
[22:12] thank you for coming." And you might and
[22:14] I I try not to do that. But if there's a
[22:16] guest, I I still want to greet them here
[22:18] in the sanctuary. I don't want to just
[22:20] grab their arm and pull them out and
[22:21] say, "Let me talk to you." You know, if
[22:22] it's their first time at church, I don't
[22:24] want to do that. You know, I don't want
[22:24] to grab Hey, come here, brother.
[22:27] I don't want to do that. But sometimes I
[22:29] feel like I just have to because we have
[22:31] a guest. Now, at the end of a service, I
[22:33] just want to remind you again, if
[22:35] there's people praying at the altar,
[22:36] let's leave and talk outside or you So,
[22:40] it's it's just something I I have to
[22:42] remind the saints, turn around and look
[22:43] and if there's anybody in their seat
[22:45] praying or bowing their head or they got
[22:46] their Bible, let's just try to leave as
[22:48] quick as we can
[22:50] &gt;&gt; because God is dealing with that
[22:51] individual and they want to pray without
[22:53] distraction.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; And that's my as I'm pastor, but I'm
[22:57] also the deacon. It's my responsibility
[22:59] to do this. So, I'm really giving myself
[23:01] a reminder.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; And the people. Now, we did it real good
[23:06] a few weeks ago. I I forget. I I said,
[23:08] "Yeah, somebody came up for prayer at
[23:10] the altar and I said, "Okay, now
[23:11] everybody get out." And everybody did a
[23:12] really good job of exiting really fast.
[23:14] So, thank you. And brother Ram said, "No
[23:16] running in the sanctuary." Now, he's
[23:17] talking about letting kids run all over
[23:19] the church. Now, you can run if we're
[23:21] worshiping. Hallelujah. You run.
[23:23] Hallelujah. You You do a Jericho mark.
[23:26] Hallelujah. or march rather, not Mark.
[23:30] If you want to dance, you dance. Praise
[23:32] God. But we're he's talking about he's
[23:34] he said, "I visited other churches and
[23:36] you let those kids uh run around, run
[23:39] through the building, shout across the
[23:40] sanctuary." Now, we got a small one. We
[23:42] don't even have to shout across the
[23:43] sanctuary. We can just say, "Casea, how
[23:45] was your day today?" Huh? Did I shout? I
[23:47] don't have to shout in a small church.
[23:49] But he he'd been to sanctuaries where
[23:51] they had to shout, "Oh, brother and how
[23:54] how is work this week, brother?" He said
[23:56] that's a good He said that's a good way
[23:58] to ruin your service.
[24:00] Now I've seen it, brother Rod. I went to
[24:02] the chapel for many years. Well, not not
[24:04] many years. Here I go again. All my
[24:05] exaggerating. I went to uh the chapel
[24:07] for about three years and God's my
[24:10] witness. The last time I went there
[24:11] before this 2020,
[24:15] I walked in there and the pastor N.
[24:19] Larson come up. Do you remember N
[24:20] Larson? Okay. He's a very respectful
[24:22] man. I met him a couple times. Good man.
[24:24] He said, "Uh, well," and everybody's
[24:26] chatting, chatting. I'm kind of
[24:27] surprised because I've been coming to
[24:28] our church for so long. I just wanted to
[24:29] visit and I was kind of surprised.
[24:32] So, I sat down. Everybody, they're just
[24:34] talking across. Nobody was running. The
[24:36] kids weren't running around, but they're
[24:37] talking across the aisles, you know,
[24:38] this big huge mega mega church. And he
[24:41] stood right there and he said, "Well,
[24:42] since nobody's praying, turn around and
[24:44] shake somebody's hand." And I thought,
[24:46] "What a rebuke." Now, it was a joke to
[24:49] him or coming from him, but it was a
[24:51] rebuke of the spirit.
[24:54] Because church, when we're coming here,
[24:55] we're getting our hearts ready to hear
[24:57] from God.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; Now, say it like this. If you get your
[25:00] heart ready, you'll know it's God. You
[25:01] know the difference between if it's God,
[25:03] the devil, or your own thoughts.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says later in this sermon,
[25:09] you are guaranteed to hear from heaven
[25:11] if a pastor walks into a praying
[25:14] congregation.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I've said that many times before,
[25:18] but it's worth saying again.
[25:20] You will hear from heaven if everybody
[25:23] can just pray before I or brother Irvin
[25:25] Miller or brother Diggs or Brother
[25:27] Dennis McBride. If you just pray before
[25:29] service, you're guaranteed to hear from
[25:32] God and then you'll like coming to
[25:33] church more. Hallelujah.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; You're guaranteed because you're in the
[25:42] spirit already.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:48] Uh, if you would pull up Isaiah 56:7.
[25:51] Like I said, we've done a good job,
[25:52] church, but I've got to remind you. I've
[25:54] got to remind myself. Now, praying at
[25:56] home, that's something you got to do,
[25:58] too. We're going to get to that here.
[25:59] Got to remember to pray before service.
[26:02] Pray every morning. Isaiah 56:7, "Even
[26:05] then will I bring to my holy mountain
[26:06] and make them joyful in my house of
[26:09] prayer." on a holy mountain speaking of
[26:10] the millennium or the future home the
[26:13] new Jerusalem there burnt offerings.
[26:15] Okay, so offerings so that gives us this
[26:16] clue it's it's the millennium right
[26:19] because there's going to be no death
[26:20] there's going to be no death in the
[26:21] future home the new Jerusalem so this is
[26:23] a millennium scripture their burnt
[26:25] offerings and their sacrifices shall be
[26:27] accepted upon mine altar for my house
[26:30] shall be called a house of prayer for
[26:33] all people.
[26:35] So what when you picture church, what do
[26:37] you think of? Most of us think of
[26:38] sermons, right? And I thank God for
[26:40] sermons. Sermons have changed my life,
[26:43] right? Sermons make me weep and cry and
[26:46] get right with God and receive faith and
[26:48] you know, but but when we think about
[26:51] God's house, God calls it a house of
[26:53] prayer.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; So again, we've been challenged these
[26:56] last few weeks. Don't let let's not have
[26:58] Job's perspective. Let's try to get
[27:00] God's perspective on things.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; We look at church, we think, oh, he's
[27:03] going to preach again. He's gonna shout
[27:05] again. He's gonna spit again. He's
[27:06] gonna, you know,
[27:08] &gt;&gt; whatever.
[27:09] But when God looks at it, he looks down
[27:11] and said, "That's where they gather to
[27:13] call on my name."
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; That's where I hear from the not just
[27:17] the brothers. That's where I hear from
[27:19] the sisters, too.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; All right. Thanks, sisters. I appreciate
[27:22] that. Thank you.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; It's a house of prayer for all people,
[27:25] not just brothers.
[27:27] Not just old men, young men, strong men,
[27:30] healthy men. It's for all people. God
[27:33] looks down and said, "That's my house.
[27:35] That's where I hear from my children."
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; House of prayer. Jesus repeated this in
[27:40] Matthew 21:3 and said to them, "It is
[27:43] written, my house shall be called the
[27:45] house of prayer, but you have made it a
[27:48] den of thieves."
[27:50] Hallelujah. So, they were selling the
[27:52] sacrifices at exorbitant amount, making
[27:54] all kinds of uh interest on it. It
[27:58] started off as a good idea. You know,
[27:59] it's very convenient, right? It's more
[28:01] convenient to just buy an animal
[28:02] sacrifice there rather than having to
[28:04] drag or pull your animal or guide your
[28:06] animal all the way to Jerusalem. It
[28:08] started off as a good idea, but then it
[28:10] moves into the outer court of the
[28:12] Gentiles. It just moves closer and
[28:13] closer and it becomes a distraction.
[28:15] Then people start making money on it and
[28:17] the focus and the convenience has all
[28:20] been lost
[28:22] &gt;&gt; and now it's a money-making scheme. Now
[28:24] church, how many times are there times
[28:26] when we lose the meaning of church? What
[28:29] is church about? Praise God.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Is it just about paying ti? Is just
[28:33] about singing songs? Is it just about
[28:35] listening to a sermon? It's about God.
[28:37] It's about praying to God, talking to
[28:39] God, getting ready to meet Jesus.
[28:41] Hallelujah.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; That's what it's about. Hallelujah.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; But in Jesus's day, it become a den of
[28:50] thieves. How much money can I make off
[28:52] these people? That's what it became. So,
[28:56] no wonder he got out the the cords. I
[28:59] don't have any core rope cords or
[29:00] anything like that. No wonder he got out
[29:02] the cords and overthrew their tables and
[29:05] the money changers tables and all these
[29:06] things. It was a rebuke that uh uh they
[29:10] they'd lost the heart of worship, right?
[29:14] And that's why we sing that song, let's
[29:15] come back to the heart of worship when
[29:17] it's all about prayer.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; It's all about Jesus and prayer. My
[29:21] time's flying by too fast.
[29:26] Brother Ram said, 'You come here to talk
[29:27] to him. Let him talk back to you. The
[29:30] trouble is we do too much talking and
[29:32] don't listen enough. Then when we come
[29:34] in here, wait on him.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said when he started
[29:45] pastoring a church, it would have been
[29:47] around uh 33. Yeah, that's 33 because uh
[29:50] he had a seven major visions the morning
[29:52] he laid uh uh the cornerstone for the
[29:55] brand tabernacle. He said when he
[29:57] started, I would not permit anybody. The
[30:00] usher stood at the door to see that
[30:02] nobody talked.
[30:04] Now, in the last six months, I think
[30:05] I've only had to correct one person from
[30:07] talking. It was a sweet little boy named
[30:08] Kevin up here. Right?
[30:12] out of all these last six months, all
[30:13] these services, I've only had to stop
[30:15] one time,
[30:17] right? And just correct a little boy who
[30:18] don't even know the difference. But look
[30:20] at him. Look how good he is now, church,
[30:21] with just one little correction.
[30:24] I was I'm so blessed. I'm going to tell
[30:25] him, God bless him on well, next Sunday
[30:27] or two Sundays. I won't be here this
[30:28] Sunday, Lord willing. But brother would
[30:31] stand there and make sure nobody talked.
[30:33] That's how much zeal and reverence he
[30:34] had for the Lord. He said that he said,
[30:37] "You done your talking outside. If you
[30:39] come in, he said, "If you desire, come
[30:42] to the altar, pray silently. You walk
[30:45] back to your seat, open up your Bible.
[30:47] What your neighbor done, that's up to
[30:48] him. You had nothing to say to it. I
[30:51] want to talk to him and say, "I'll see
[30:53] him outside. I'm here to worship the
[30:54] Lord." You read his word or sit quietly.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a good reminder. Uh, and we,
[31:01] as I said, we normally do a wonderful
[31:03] job of that. Now, I said with our girls
[31:06] with all their notepads that I like to
[31:07] give out, I like the notepads. Uh, I
[31:09] don't mind if they're reading their
[31:10] Bibles or drawing pictures, but they got
[31:12] to make sure they're not looking at each
[31:13] other's notebooks or passing the
[31:15] notebooks or something like that. Does
[31:16] that make sense, girls? Because brother
[31:18] gets into that. Brother said, "Don't
[31:19] pass any notes in the church service."
[31:23] Right. Right. Because he had teenagers
[31:25] that were being silly or telling jokes
[31:26] or writing jokes and he could see them
[31:28] pass notes and he would try to send the
[31:30] usher or the deacons to try to bring
[31:31] correction. Remember, the deacons are
[31:33] the policemen of the church, right?
[31:36] Hallelujah. So, I expect Sunday, Brother
[31:37] Irvin's going to walk in here. It's
[31:38] gonna He could hear a pin drop.
[31:41] He's going to see all the girls sitting
[31:42] up saying, "Amen." Listen.
[31:45] Not looking at anybody else.
[31:48] Brother's going to see us all all ready
[31:50] all in reverence. Hallelujah.
[31:53] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[31:58] And then he says, uh, then there'll be a
[31:59] time he said the song leader leads
[32:01] songs. He says, "And then we'll come out
[32:03] outstanding solo."
[32:06] Okay. And then uh and then brother said
[32:07] the pastor would then come out and lead
[32:09] in a couple songs and then preach the
[32:11] word of God. So brother just reviews how
[32:14] he did his services. Okay. He started
[32:16] with songs for everybody and then
[32:18] outstanding solos or duets or trios or
[32:22] quartets or quintets or sex tets or
[32:27] septets. I looked it up on chat GTP
[32:29] today.
[32:31] and octets. Yeah, there you go, brother.
[32:33] That's the last one I looked up was
[32:34] eight. I forgot. Octet.
[32:37] Now, when our girls sing, usually it's a
[32:38] quintet, right? It's five. Okay. So, we
[32:42] just we sing our songs together. Then,
[32:43] Brother said, then if there's any
[32:45] outstanding solos or quintets or trios,
[32:48] sorry, palm girls.
[32:51] Then you sing it and then the pastor
[32:52] will sing a few songs and then get right
[32:55] into the word of God. Now, that's his
[32:57] way to do it. So, uh now the last six
[32:59] months you've seen it. We used to start
[33:02] singing as a church at 10:00. But then I
[33:04] started prayer because uh you know I
[33:06] I've always wanted people to come early
[33:08] to pray and if they don't come early to
[33:10] pray well then I'll just I'll wait till
[33:12] everybody's here then we can pray. But I
[33:14] want to make sure everybody prays before
[33:16] we start the service. And I've enjoyed
[33:17] that more. I've enjoyed that. I hope
[33:20] you've enjoyed that. And also it ought
[33:22] I'll say like this. It ought to wet your
[33:23] appetite for more prayer. You know, so
[33:26] if you're not praying before service, at
[33:27] least you pray right here and not just
[33:30] me praying. See, that's the thing. Yeah,
[33:32] I'm praying or whoever's praying for the
[33:33] prayer request, Jose or whatever, but
[33:36] you're supposed to pray as well.
[33:37] Hallelujah. And I want you to talk to
[33:39] God. And then sometimes sometimes people
[33:42] don't stay after to pray. So in in in in
[33:45] times past, if if people weren't here
[33:46] early to pray and I just pray during the
[33:49] service and they don't say it after to
[33:50] pray, sometimes I wonder, brother Rod,
[33:52] did they even pray?
[33:54] Did they even pray? And Jesus said,
[33:56] "It's a house of prayer." Hallelujah.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; It's a house of prayer for everybody,
[34:01] all people, not just me, right? Not just
[34:04] the brothers.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; So, I would, you know, my vision as a
[34:09] pastor has always been, as I shared that
[34:10] we could get, everybody could get here
[34:12] 30 minutes before service and pray, read
[34:14] your Bible, wait before the Lord, and we
[34:16] can start right at 10 o'clock. I hope
[34:17] someday we get there by God's grace.
[34:19] Right? That's what I hope. That's what I
[34:21] desire. Hallelujah. If your boss asked
[34:23] you to get there half an hour uh to work
[34:26] to get an extra to get a raise, would
[34:28] you do it?
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I would.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Well, don't you think you're going to
[34:33] get a raise if you come early and pray?
[34:34] A spiritual raise?
[34:36] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about natural raise.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you think God's going to honor you
[34:39] if you honor God? Don't you think God's
[34:40] going to honor you?
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Anybody Anybody agree with that?
[34:45] &gt;&gt; I believe God will honor you if you
[34:46] honor him. If uh you reap what you sow,
[34:49] if you plant good prayer seeds, you're
[34:51] going to reap good preaching seed or
[34:53] great uh reap great great preaching
[34:55] fruit. I'm sorry. Prayer seeds preaching
[34:58] fruit.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody got that?
[35:03] Now, Brother Brandham says this,
[35:06] when a minister walks into a
[35:07] congregation of people praying and the
[35:09] anointing of the spirit, you're bound to
[35:11] hear from heaven. That's just all. So,
[35:14] there's the guarantee. You're guaranteed
[35:15] to hear from heaven if people are
[35:16] praying in the spirit. There's no way to
[35:19] keep from it. But if you walk into
[35:21] confusion, you're so confused, the
[35:24] spirit is grieved. And we don't want
[35:26] that. No, we want to come here to
[35:28] worship.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, Brother Ram set up I'm going
[35:33] to let's we haven't I haven't preached
[35:34] on this for years. So, I'm probably
[35:36] going to close with this here. By God's
[35:37] grace, brother Random set up his church
[35:39] like this. Songs, right? uh songs and
[35:44] then preaching, right? And then uh yeah,
[35:47] songs, preaching, and then prayer at the
[35:49] end. Yeah, he would have the prayer
[35:50] line. Okay. So, Brother Ham said it that
[35:52] way. And he set it up by the the model
[35:54] of Jericho, right, in the book of
[35:57] Joshua. So, go to Joshua chapter 6 verse
[36:00] 9.
[36:02] Joshua 69 is just one. If you read
[36:04] verses 1 to 10, you get the whole
[36:05] picture. But just for time's sake, let's
[36:08] look at verse 9.
[36:10] Notice who goes first, second, and
[36:12] third. Notice, and the armed men went
[36:15] before the priests that blew the
[36:18] trumpets.
[36:20] And the re-reward came after the ark.
[36:23] The priests going on and blowing with
[36:26] the trumpets. Okay. Now, it looks like
[36:28] for me, now I could be wrong, but it
[36:30] looks like you have armed soldiers go
[36:31] first.
[36:33] Okay? Then you have priests blowing
[36:36] trumpets. That's the music. Then you got
[36:38] the ark, the word. And then you got a
[36:40] re-reward. A re-reward means going
[36:43] behind you. And you've got another set
[36:46] of priests behind.
[36:49] Everybody see that?
[36:51] &gt;&gt; So brother took this and that's how he
[36:53] tried to set up his service, right? With
[36:55] songs. That's the priest blowing the
[36:57] trumpets, the word singing in worship
[37:00] and prayer. Okay. Now we can look at it
[37:04] and this is how I this is how I've tried
[37:06] to teach it over the years. The armor
[37:07] man reminds us of the full armor of God
[37:10] in Ephesians chapter 6.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; And what does that mean? It the Bible
[37:14] said after list all the six armor pieces
[37:17] and that's what I'm going to preach on
[37:18] on Saturday night at CAM church. I've
[37:19] just felt numerous leadings of the Holy
[37:21] Spirit this week. I'm going to preach on
[37:23] wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[37:24] Sunday morning I'm going to preach on
[37:25] Job. I think at Cam church because I
[37:27] always try to preach to them what I've
[37:28] already preached to you. Unless God
[37:30] gives me something special then I'll
[37:32] come back and preach it to you. Okay.
[37:36] But after Ephesians 6 goes through the
[37:38] six pieces, then it says, "Praying with
[37:40] all what?" Prayer and supplication. So
[37:43] someone who's got the full armor of God
[37:44] on is ready to pray.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; And they look like a soldier in the
[37:48] sight of God. They look like a soldier,
[37:51] &gt;&gt; right? They're ready to pray. They got
[37:53] all six pieces. Five uh we say five
[37:56] defensive, one offensive. But I say,
[37:58] Brother Rod, you could probably use the
[37:59] shield as a offensive weapon. Don't you
[38:00] think, brother? You could probably
[38:02] somebody good with the shield. I know
[38:04] Malachi, right? You think? You think so,
[38:06] brother? We've seen it on movies. God
[38:08] forgive us for watching the worldly
[38:10] movies, but we've seen it on movies.
[38:11] Okay. Gladiator. What's that? Yeah.
[38:13] Jawbone. Yeah. Good, brother. Yes.
[38:15] Jawbone of a mule. Hallelujah. So So to
[38:18] me, church, the way I've seen it is that
[38:20] our men represents we got to have prayer
[38:22] warriors first,
[38:25] then the then the trumpets, then the
[38:28] music. That's why I I I would wait now.
[38:31] Oh, now I'm waiting till 10:00 a.m. to
[38:32] start prayer just so everybody can get
[38:34] here. So everybody can pray. Get those
[38:36] armed men and women ready to go for the
[38:38] service.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then we'll sing. Then comes
[38:42] the ark. The ark is the word, the prince
[38:44] of God. And then more singing and prayer
[38:46] and everything like that. By Does that
[38:48] make sense? By God's grace. So brother
[38:49] Chris, that's where brother Ram got it.
[38:51] And he says that I don't have the quotes
[38:52] right there, but I could find them.
[38:54] Brother said that this is where he got
[38:55] the order of his service. Okay. And then
[38:58] brother Ram would make statements. He
[39:00] said, he said, "We've had these
[39:01] miracles." He says, "Who gets the credit
[39:03] for these miracles?" He said, "All those
[39:05] people that were praying and fasting for
[39:06] me back home in Jeffersonville," he's
[39:08] out, Brother, he might be in South
[39:10] Africa. He might be uh uh South America.
[39:13] He might be uh in Europe,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; DC. Yeah, that's right. Amen.
[39:18] But he says, "Give the credit to the
[39:20] people who are praying and fasting back
[39:22] home in Jeffersonville or anybody that
[39:25] knew his ministry around the world."
[39:27] Hallelujah. He didn't take credit,
[39:29] brother Rod. He said his fast day was
[39:30] Fridays. So they normally had uh Friday
[39:33] night, Saturday night, Sunday services
[39:35] in his campaigns. So he made sure Friday
[39:38] right before that service. He goes that
[39:39] first service he would fast all day
[39:41] Friday.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; And then he said I would eat little
[39:43] meals in between, you know, Friday,
[39:46] Saturday, Sunday services, he said like
[39:47] he called it a little sandwich.
[39:49] He just eat a little sandwich. Now not
[39:51] get all the chicken out and the steak
[39:52] and everything like we like. But if
[39:55] you're in the service of the Lord, you
[39:56] got to eat light in order to stay more
[39:59] spiritual.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. Like Daniel, Daniel
[40:04] fasted, he didn't fast completely for 21
[40:06] days. Remember what was it? It was water
[40:08] and veggies, right? Um Yes. Not the
[40:12] dainty meats, right, brother?
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Not the pleasant meats. Amen. So,
[40:16] he just gave up uh he ate the
[40:18] vegetables. He wouldn't eat all the
[40:19] pleasant meats, right?
[40:24] Now just I'll close with this then. Um
[40:27] Joshua 6 through9 I'm sorry 69 I'm
[40:30] sorry. So here we see our men I believe
[40:33] is a symbol of prayer before service.
[40:36] Exodus 27 verse 20 and 21. Got two more
[40:40] scriptures. Exodus and then Mark. Exodus
[40:43] 27 pardon me 20 and 21. I've got to get
[40:46] Malachi home here.
[40:48] Exodus 27:20. And thou shalt command the
[40:51] children of Israel. Now notice that they
[40:53] bring thee pure olive oil beaten for the
[40:56] light
[40:59] to cause the lamp to burn always.
[41:03] Okay. So who provided the oil for the
[41:06] priests? It was the people
[41:09] in order for the priest. Brother Chris,
[41:10] remember there was the outer court, the
[41:12] holy place, and the holiest of holies. I
[41:14] wish I had a visual. I didn't prepare
[41:15] that part. But the oil was for the holy
[41:18] place right behind the tent. Okay. Okay.
[41:21] Right behind the tent or the first veil
[41:22] it's called. There's two veils. Okay.
[41:25] Right behind the first veil, they'd walk
[41:27] in, brother Chris, they would have a
[41:29] table of shoebre. Uh he would have the
[41:32] lampstands over here and he'd have the
[41:33] altar of incense, three pieces of
[41:35] furniture.
[41:37] But brother, if the people didn't bring
[41:39] the oil, it'd be totally dark in there,
[41:41] and he couldn't do the service of the
[41:42] Lord. Remember, Eli let it go out, too.
[41:46] Showed he was backsliding. It also
[41:47] showed the people were backsliding, too.
[41:50] So, Brother Chris, during the week, they
[41:52] had to stomp those olives. Imagine that.
[41:54] They had to go pick those olives, stomp
[41:55] those olives, let the oil drain in their
[41:58] drains, catch into the jars, and bring
[42:01] that jar to church on Saturday. And the
[42:03] church said,
[42:05] "That's a lot of work. My goodness. I
[42:07] got to go out there and pick olives, and
[42:09] I got to stomp them, and then I got to
[42:10] collect the oil. Then I got to bring it
[42:11] to church." Yes. If you want service, if
[42:14] you want the the priest to be able to
[42:15] serve, you got to do some work by God's
[42:17] grace.
[42:19] Hallelujah.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Look at verse 21. In the tabernacle of
[42:24] the congregation without the veil which
[42:26] is before the testimony, Aaron and his
[42:28] sons shall order it from evening to
[42:29] morning. It shall be a statute forever
[42:31] unto their generations on behalf of the
[42:34] children of Israel. In other words, if
[42:36] the people don't pray, if the people
[42:38] don't stay consecrated to God, there
[42:40] won't be any light in the service.
[42:43] In other words, we won't see
[42:44] supernatural. We won't see people healed
[42:46] or being discerned or feeling blessed or
[42:48] convicted of their sins. It's so
[42:50] important. We've got to be the ones who
[42:52] prayed. Hallelujah.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; And church, see preaching like that, you
[42:58] know, I do often preach on prayer and
[42:59] fasting, but it's a good thing. Uh
[43:01] because the devil's battling all of us
[43:02] on it. So, I just see the more I preach
[43:04] on, the more it's on my mind. And then
[43:06] the easier I say not easier, it's easier
[43:09] to then go do the prayer because it's on
[43:12] my mind,
[43:13] &gt;&gt; right? I'm studying it. I'm preaching
[43:14] it. I realize that. In other words, it
[43:16] just gives me more reminders to yield to
[43:18] the Holy Spirit to go pick the olive
[43:20] oil. I'm sorry, the olives, right?
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Do the prayer. Hallelujah.
[43:29] And church, remember that's what brother
[43:30] Ram modeled for us. You know, he said
[43:32] the people would pray and fast for his
[43:35] meetings, right? Then he prayed and
[43:37] fasted, too. Praise God. Everybody prays
[43:40] and fasts and it helps the light of God
[43:42] to shine. Hallelujah.
[43:45] Now, the last one is a this takes a
[43:47] little more spiritual and I could be
[43:49] wrong on this one, but this is my humble
[43:50] opinion. Mark uh 11:8 and 9. I saw this
[43:55] one time and uh year it must have been
[43:57] 2016, almost nine years ago. And many
[44:00] spread their garments in the way. So,
[44:02] this is Jesus here uh the week before he
[44:05] was crucified.
[44:07] And uh they're crying hosana, which
[44:09] means save us. They're saying save us.
[44:11] Save us. And then they reject him the
[44:12] next week.
[44:14] Right?
[44:15] Others cut down branches of trees. So
[44:18] they would cut down branches of trees
[44:19] and straw them in the way.
[44:22] Okay? Now notice what happened first
[44:24] before he come. What they had to do.
[44:26] They had to go cut the branches and lay
[44:28] the branches down. Now another version
[44:30] says palm branches.
[44:34] So I just did a little play on words
[44:35] brother. Just a play on words. I said
[44:38] let's put our palms let's lay our palms
[44:40] down.
[44:43] Everybody with me?
[44:45] &gt;&gt; If and I say and I pray this brother Rod
[44:46] and many times God answered my prayer.
[44:49] If you lay down your palms and pray and
[44:51] seek God, the King of glory will ride
[44:53] into the service.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris, I've seen it so many
[44:57] times since I've been praying that way.
[45:00] If we just prepare and say, "King of
[45:01] glory, come in. Ride into this service.
[45:04] Here's my palms." Now, you can raise
[45:06] them. You don't have to lay them down.
[45:07] As far as I'm just saying, you got to
[45:08] pray before service.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to pray throughout
[45:11] the week. Pray before you go into a
[45:13] special meeting at work or whatever you
[45:14] got to do. Just pray, right? And the
[45:17] King of Glory, watch him right into the
[45:19] congregation. Hallelujah.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Watch him right into your life. So, we
[45:22] have three witnesses, right? The armen
[45:25] go first. Prayer goes first. Bring the
[45:27] oil. The people got to beat uh beat down
[45:30] the the the olives. Get the oil. They
[45:32] got to do the work. They got to bring it
[45:33] so then the light of God can shine. And
[45:36] you got to lay down the palms and then
[45:38] Jesus will ride in. Let's stand to our
[45:40] feet by God's grace.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; It's been years and years. Well, I
[45:44] shouldn't say that. It's been years
[45:45] since I preached that. So, Malachi can
[45:47] come here.
[45:52] Thank you, Victoria.
[45:58] Praise God.
[46:00] Hallelujah. Amen.
[46:04] So, I hope that's a help here tonight by
[46:06] God's grace. U I wanted to get back to
[46:08] this series. on it. And if church, if
[46:10] you would listen to God hiding himself
[46:12] in simplicity, it's a three-hour sermon,
[46:14] but if you do like 20 minutes a morning,
[46:16] you can get to that like four or five
[46:18] days. You gota, you and I, we got to
[46:21] listen to God's prophet. Hallelujah.
[46:23] You've got to do it.
[46:26] That's what I'll do. I mean, I got to
[46:27] mow once a week. So, that's hour and a
[46:29] half. I can get through half the sermon.
[46:30] An hour and a half, right? Driving to
[46:34] work. I got a 20-minute drive to work.
[46:35] There's that chunk that you can get by
[46:36] God's grace. Hallelujah.
[46:39] But if we want, how many want to see the
[46:40] king of glory right in?
[46:42] &gt;&gt; How many want light in this sanctuary?
[46:44] And I'm not talking electric light.
[46:46] Hallelujah.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; The light of Christ. Light is knowledge.
[46:50] Paul said the unto the light, the
[46:52] knowledge or the light of the knowledge
[46:54] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[46:57] Hallelujah.
[46:58] And church, how many want to be soldiers
[47:00] for Jesus Christ? That's what I want.
[47:04] Now, before we pray, I just uh I don't
[47:06] know if everybody heard that testimony,
[47:07] but Adam, my cousin Adam, brother Austin
[47:09] and brother Rod, I don't know if you
[47:11] heard it when I said it earlier. He said
[47:13] as soon as he drove into Akran, he felt
[47:15] the anointing of the Holy Ghost. He said
[47:18] when he went to bed, he felt it. When he
[47:20] got up, he felt it. When he left, he
[47:22] felt it. When he got back home, three
[47:23] hours away, he felt it. And he said now,
[47:26] he said he just got over an addiction,
[47:28] one of his final addictions he's had for
[47:30] 28 years.
[47:33] He and I were just talking today.
[47:37] See what it does to give your testimony,
[47:38] church. See what it does. See what it
[47:40] does. And what was he blessed by? These
[47:42] little girls singing right here.
[47:44] He was so blessed. He said, "These girls
[47:46] can sing just like brother Brandon or
[47:47] brother Brendan here." Church, everybody
[47:50] has a part. Girls, your part is so
[47:52] important to worship. Brothers, your
[47:54] part is so important
[47:56] to be a testimony, right? to pray, to
[47:58] pull on the word of God, to give God all
[48:01] you have in service. And now he's
[48:04] walking free after 28 years of being a
[48:07] slave. He's free. Oh, he said this. He
[48:09] said, "God took it from me in that
[48:12] service, that Sunday service. God took
[48:15] it from me." So friends, let's trust
[48:18] God. Hallelujah. Let's believe God. All
[48:21] things are possible to them that
[48:22] believe.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Now, how many times have I seen that in
[48:26] my ministry? people delivered from
[48:27] smoking or drinking or uh porn, all
[48:30] these things. How many times have I seen
[48:31] that in my ministry? And what is it?
[48:32] It's the people praying.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; It's the people being in one accord.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[48:40] believe.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[48:43] Dear Lord, I love you tonight, Lord God.
[48:45] Thank you, Lord Jesus. I just uh I just
[48:47] want to thank you, Lord God, for these
[48:48] little testimonies. This blesses my soul
[48:51] when my cousin can come to our church,
[48:53] our little old church, and when he gets
[48:56] into the outer realms of the city, he
[48:59] feels the anointing of the Holy Ghost.
[49:01] Lord God, thank you God for your
[49:03] presence in this church, Lord God. Thank
[49:06] you for the oil that the people have
[49:07] brought. I just want to encourage them,
[49:09] keep bringing it. And Lord, if we can,
[49:12] let's bring more, dear God, so that the
[49:14] light of God can continually shine in
[49:17] our services.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for delivering my
[49:20] cousin, Lord God, after 28 years. Oh,
[49:23] tobacco has no hold. Hallelujah. Over a
[49:26] child of God. Thank you, Lord God. Thank
[49:28] you, Jesus. Praise God.
[49:32] Hallelujah.
[49:34] Thank you, Lord.
[49:36] I know he wasn't planning for that to
[49:38] happen, Lord God. It was a supernatural
[49:40] move of the Holy Ghost. Thank you,
[49:42] Jesus.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; For your delivering power, Lord God.
[49:46] Lord, it just goes to show, Lord. Jesus
[49:49] said, "The wind blows where it wants to,
[49:52] and we don't know when it's coming or
[49:53] when it's going. We just want to be
[49:55] there when it happens." Praise God. We
[49:57] just want to be there when the wind
[49:58] blows. I'm glad I was there when my
[50:00] cousin got delivered. Lord God, I'm glad
[50:02] I was preaching. I'm glad I was
[50:03] supporting, saying, "Amen" to his
[50:05] testimony. I'm glad I led songs in that
[50:07] service. Lord God, I'm glad I was there.
[50:09] Hallelujah. I brought the oil, Lord God.
[50:13] Each person that came that Saturday
[50:14] night and Sunday, they brought the oil
[50:16] of prayers because it's a house of
[50:18] prayer.
[50:20] Lord, you're looking down from heaven,
[50:22] Lord God, we'd say, and you don't see a
[50:24] house of sermons. You don't see a house
[50:26] of tapes or something like that, Lord
[50:29] God. You see a house of prayer. Lord,
[50:31] hear your prayers. I'm sorry. Hear the
[50:34] prayers of your people tonight, Lord
[50:36] God.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[50:39] God, help us to be more dedicated. Lord
[50:41] God, help us to be more faithful, Lord
[50:43] Jesus. It's been a wonderful week here,
[50:45] Lord God. It's been a wonderful month,
[50:47] Lord God, since Adam came in. Lord God,
[50:50] it's just been wonderful, Lord Jesus.
[50:53] For Brendan coming, Lord God, all the
[50:54] saints at their post and their duty.
[50:57] Even these little girls playing their
[50:58] part and their voices bring down the
[51:01] Holy Ghost. Lord God,
[51:03] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus.
[51:05] I feel like Job.
[51:08] I'm vile. Who am I? I'm so
[51:09] insignificant. But Lord, if we can just
[51:12] do what you said, if we can just lay our
[51:14] palms down on the altar, Lord God, if we
[51:16] can just maybe raise our palms to heaven
[51:18] and invite the king of glory, then Jesus
[51:21] Christ, the king of heaven. Hallelujah.
[51:23] He comes into the church and he does
[51:25] things that we don't know anything
[51:26] about, Lord God. He does things, Lord.
[51:28] You do things we can't do, Lord God.
[51:31] Because apart from you, we can do
[51:33] nothing. But Lord, when we agree with
[51:35] you, as brother Rod said on the text,
[51:37] when we have harmony with you, Lord God,
[51:40] then the spirit can begin to move, Lord
[51:42] God.
[51:44] Lord, may we take these scriptures and
[51:46] these thoughts deep to heart for Sunday.
[51:48] Lord, I know I'm feeling already the
[51:51] presence of God pressing into my spirit
[51:53] for the Napoleon meetings. Lord, I feel
[51:55] pressed. I feel directed, Lord God, on
[51:58] these areas.
[52:00] So Lord, just lead me. Lord, I pray
[52:02] you'd lead Brother Irvin, Lord God, to
[52:04] be a help to this congregation here.
[52:06] Lord God, surely a man who's in his late
[52:09] 60s, surely he knows something about
[52:11] you, Lord, the word of God that the
[52:13] people can pull and receive from the
[52:15] word of God. Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[52:19] Lord, I love you tonight, Lord God.
[52:21] Thank you for your love. Thank you for
[52:22] your mercy, God. Hallelujah. It's a joy
[52:24] to be in your house, Lord God.
[52:27] May this be a house of prayer, Lord God.
[52:30] Hear our prayers tonight, Lord. As we
[52:32] have prayer now, Lord, for individuals,
[52:34] I pray you'd meet their needs, Lord God.
[52:36] Forgive our sin. If there be any sin,
[52:38] still not confessed, forgive our sins,
[52:40] oh God. Make our hearts pure if we
[52:42] confess them. You're faithful and just
[52:44] to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,
[52:47] Lord God.
[52:50] Hallelujah, Jesus. We're trusting in the
[52:52] living God tonight, Lord God. Have your
[52:55] way, Lord. Lead me on prayer and fasting
[52:57] for Cameron. Lord, if it be thy will,
[52:58] Lord God,
[53:02] Lord, we need you. We love you, Lord
[53:03] God. Minister to these needs in Jesus
[53:05] Christ's name. And the church said,
[53:08] "Amen.
