[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah please God amen thank you Jesus praise God I want to be a part of that meeting more than anything else I know amen let's take our Bibles let's go to Ephesians 4 this morning by God's grace we'd like to pick up on the Fijians series this is part 13 Asian's 4 verse 1 like to start there this morning by the grace of God nice to have visitors the bland family let's give them around applause praise God get to see them by the grace of lord god bless you amen God is so merciful praise the Lord so grateful for all that God is doing amen visions chapter 4 this morning like to look at taking captivity captive by God's grace I don't know if you've ever read where this comes from I don't know Paul is actually quoting David in the Psalms but I'm not sure if you've ever i've never preached on it so it was fresh to me new to me but i start in ephesians 4 and then this evening i like to preach on continue the series on modesty makeup clothing and all those things i think tonight we'll look at Christian liberties there's certain Christian liberties the Bible gives us I'd like to teach through that by God's grace tonight by God's Spirit god bless you event good to see you sir praise the Lord amen visions 4 verse 1 now I think text here I'll just kind of read one two 13 I know it's a little bit of reading but this kind of reminds us where we were last time I think December 10th Lydia's birthday was the last time I preached on this series so it's been Lua but in the midst of that we finished the church ages so we're thankful it may do the Laodicean Church age well we'll just see how the Holy Spirit leads us seasons 4 verse 1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation that's the feast the word vocation means feast walk worthy of the feast wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace there is one body in one spirit even as ye are all called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given the grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men so when Paul is speaking about the unity of the Holy Spirit he actually quotes Psalm 68 this is how it's done it's spoken of in Psalm 68 but verse 9 now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith or the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer if anyone has a need on your heart again just make it known unto the Lord let's pray God knows every need father again in heaven we love Lord our hearts ringing with the the truth of the rapture we know there's a meeting in the air and we know you'll be the leading one dear God at that meeting Lord as Isaac did he left his home and came to the field so you will do that you'll leave your home and you'll come down to the airport and you will lead us there your God up to heaven to the marriage supper we're grateful Lord for that thank you for the promise Lord now help us Lord in the midst of this battle in the midst of this storm this fight this wilderness here on earth Lord give us strength Lord God today help us to glean these truths from the scripture Lord God for Lord we know that our prophet preached what Paul preached and or this is what Paul preached to the people Lord as the scripture said perfect us Lord work in our lives edify us bring us to unity of faith grid of us grace with more knowledge and help us to grow in the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in Jesus Christ's name and every scent Amen God by shoes being seated praise the Lord God is good let's we have some quotes here we like to show and preach a little bit this morning by the grace of God so we're looking at part thirteen here by the grace of the Lord I hope it's been a blessing you know I know the church ages has been just a tremendous blessing for me and I trust this has been a blessing to you as well I think today it'll be a really it's really wonderful to go back and see where leading captivity captive came from so I think that's where I'm going to try to get to by the end of the sermon by the grace of the Lord let me set a timer here so I don't forget I don't want to wear out myself and wear out to people all right so we did our text this morning Ephesians 4 remember there's three themes in Ephesians we've we've preached through the first two themes which were the believers exalted position in Christ we preach through that and the one body of Christ both Jew and Gentile we preach through that as well and now we're looking at the walk and the wear what I'm sorry warfare of the believer praise God so we're looking today at the walk this is dealing with the walk we must be united in our walk now let's review just real briefly I just have one slide or two slides to review Paul begged the believers when we looked at this Paul was begging them beseech you he said I beg you with all lowliness so a deep sense of your moral littleness Paul's begging them please remember how little you are morally in other words be aware how easy it is for us to make a mistake be aware that we're still living in flesh bodies as much Holy Ghost as we say we might have or believe we have we must keep this body under subjection at all times and remember how low how little we are without God's help we can do nothing so this is what we must have lowliness meekness gentleness amongst each other long-suffering we must endure with each other we must hold one another up in love amen not knock them down brother BAM said you see a man knocked down he said help him up don't kick him while he's down help him up we should help one another out by God's grace endeavoring which is giving diligence to keep the unity the agreement of the Spirit in the bonds or bands or ligaments of peace which is harmony and safety no rage or havoc praise God to see we must have a burden or attention to stay united in obedience to the spirit and the word praise God every time we walk in here we must confess our sins before we come in here and make sure we have a unity of faith praise God and everyone's believing God's Word everyone's asking the Holy Spirit to flow through them praise God and let our hearts be unified we have one goal one objective that's to see Christ form in all of our lives amen now remember he said there's one baptism and I just thought that was the most important of those ones brother Graham said there's one faith one Lord one baptism and that is the baptism is a spiritual baptism the body's being washed it's just an only an illustration to give a sign that something inside has happened but it's that soul that's got to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen that's eternal coming into that human nature and changing it around to make it a believer I pray they'll receive the Holy Spirit is that one Lord one faith one baptism that is the one baptism of the Holy Ghost where eternity comes down and dwells in your soul uh-huh amen hallelujah I'm just so happy about that amen I know eternity has stepped out into my soul praise the Lord now let's see this thought the next verse there's one God and Father now the scripture says this there's one god and father of all who's above all through all and in you all and of course he's speaking about the Holy Ghost field Saints cuz a person that's not born again doesn't have God living in them they might have potential they might have a seed in their soul but God's not officially living in them until they're quickened and made alive amen now I don't know if you caught this but there are seven ones you see this down here there's seven ones from verse four to five there's one body Jew and Gentile there's one spirit that's the Holy Ghost the eternal spirit there's one hope perhaps this is the hope of your Liberty the hope of the fellowship with the Sun Christ Jesus there's one Lord there's one chief master or possessor there's one faith there's one absolute truth in the Bible and there's one baptism the Holy Ghost baptism and there's one God and Father of us all praise to the Lord I love the seven is the number of completion so God even has seven ones what is the perfect singular number but there's seven ones according to Paul which is striking now so notice God is above through and in us all those of us who are the born-again now of course God's above all of us because Jesus said our Father who art in heaven we know it's throne is above the earth heaven as his throne earth is his footstool now God through us is God working through or amongst the bride members he just flows in our myths from one person to another how many been encouraged by somebody in the church how many been blessed by somebody in the church how many been strengthened by someone in the church that's how the Holy Spirit is supposed to throw flow through us all praise God from one to another and then God is not just through us but he actually dwells in us by the baptism of the Holy Spirit the Prophet picks it up here in this message it is I he said this is the time of Sodom I'm skipping down here when the world's gonna be burned not drowned burned its gonna be burned and this sign was to return not an ark but a God dwelling in the flesh of his people in the church jesus said at that day speaking of our day you'll know that I'm in the father the father me I and you and you and me what a connection we have to Jesus and the father but man said it's God in you all that God was poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church so it's God above us God with us and God in us amen now let's look at this measure of the gift the Bible says but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ so we have this unity we have this oneness we must stay humble we must keep lowness of mind we must stay united in Christ Jesus so Satan can't get into the church and Paul says see but every one of us has grace according to the measure or portion that God has placed in our lives but when says well friends the wrong that's the wrong impression to have your pastors a godly man his prayer will be answered just the same as an evangelist or anybody claiming a gift or anything else he's a man of God you should respect him the way that way and believe in him God will answer your answer is prayer God said confess your faults one to another pray for another that you might be healed not only every person in a measure he said that's got the Holy Spirit has the gift of healing in a measure Superman said every person who's got the Holy Ghost has the gift of healing in a measure hey man that's striking now he says this is 1950 a man says well I don't believe in supernatural he said it wasn't for you it's for believers that's who it's meant for not from believers but to those who believe these signs shall follow them that believe and that's what divine healing is based upon sometimes God does permit special things to happen to faith the believer we all believe in a measure but some may have a little more faith than others amen how many ever seen God do something supernatural in your life through your faith I trust you have where you just believe God's Word you didn't know how it's gonna happen but you just had faith it was going to happen and you saw God honor your faith because it really wasn't your faith it was Christ faith in you so see you can then you can realize ah God has given me a measure God has given me a portion of faith and I must use this faith for his glory now I put this quote on there twice I don't know why I put that under twice and what's gonna replace it but when Jesus was here on earth he did not claim him to be a healer no sir he said I don't do any healing at all it's my father doesn't healing that dwells in me oh if we could only catch that attitude this morning you and I don't have to do the miracle we just have to believe Jesus would be the miracle Jesus was not the miracle worker it was God in him working the miracle it takes the pressure off of us it's not us up to do it but we could ask the father father will you do this if we don't know it's will you do this if we know then God's going to do it then a revelation struck you which we know is rare right we know it doesn't happen all the time most people don't say thus saith the Lord or something like that it's very rare but there are times we don't have to say they'll say at the Lord where faith has anchored in our hearts amen and that is a revelation he said I the son can do nothing what'd he do he was possessed with the power of God without measure we have it in measures he has it without measure just like go out in the ocean get a spoonful of water it's just a spoonful out of the ocean that'd be just a little gift here up inside of him but remember the same chemicals that's in the spoonful of water is in the whole ocean the same thing just smaller way smaller Amen hallelujah so realize the same little measure that's in you is the same quality that was in Christ not as much but it's the same quantity which means it'll do the same things praise God it accomplishes the same purpose now he said God give this gift to me by measure it gives it to you I'm sorry gives it to you by measure he gives it to this man to pray by measure he gives it this man to sing by measure so now we're getting into other gifts in our lives and I just want every person who started to sing I want them to sing by the Holy Ghost in our church don't hold back your measure to Christ I want every preacher to preach God's Word in our assembly don't hold back your measure to Jesus and now divine healing we're to wisdom knowledge prophecy we go through all those don't hold back your gift use that God use the measure I had but see you got to be response with that you got to take care you got to give focus and you got to give attention to your measure praise God the Bible God told preachers don't neglect your gift well brother Jesse I've seen God healed for me before well then you've got to further consecrate that measure in your life so that God can use it and bless it and make it bless more people praise God it's a gift it's it's a talent it's got to be invested in it's gonna be focused on amen and God even told Timothy he said he said forget about everything else just give yourself to preaching to edification to teaching to exhorting forget everything else and focus on that measure in your life amen oh if we could only do that there's no distractions from the world just focus on the gift God has placed in our lives amen Oh hallelujah pretty give it to Jesus without measure all God was in him God was manifest in the flesh now we have the spirit by these gifts by portion so see now he says a measures a portion a portion as a gift but Christ handed without measure we have it by measure - one is given now each other one given wisdom there in the church five offices apostles or missionaries either one both the same thing word means one set apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors God sets them in the church but because one would be an apostle the Prophet can say you're not in it for the pastors and evangelists and so forth oh because you don't preach every week like me evangelist you're not as good as me now every part is extremely important every gift is so important he says but there are little lines of God that's all we need to be this morning is a little channel for God to use crazy you just have to bring your portion you just have to bring your little gift just bring it present it for the Lord and watch god bless that portion amen and in every local body there should be nine spiritual gifts I wonder which gifts we have laying here amen nine spiritual gifts in each body they operate separately but of the self same spirit this is what I've been encouraging everybody to come early to pray that's why I invited you in 2018 to come early and pray well commander said you brethren should be just as interested in getting your measure can I say like that you should be just as interested in getting your measure in the place in the house of God as the pastor isn't getting in his because it's just essential that you do it it's absolutely necessary to have everybody bring their measure to church and have it be ready for God to use praise the Lord hey man it's essential we've got to have that we know brother loris you know when he calmed I'm just used to him and I as an example we know he gives his portion to God he practices at home and makes new songs puts up on CD he said we love it we rejoice amen we love the concerts I hope you enjoy my preaching because I spent a lot of time preparing I just invest and I just stay focus and invest keep investing in it I try to let anything distract me just stay right with the word of God amen and just as I'm interested in brother losses every one of us should be just as interested and what am I supposed to do in the house of God notice my Bible said in the house of God in the house of God does that help by God's grace hope that's a blessing now let's move on to this thought here I want to get to this thought because I got about 46 minutes but that's gonna fly by I'm sure once I'm already in heavenly places by God's grace Wow he led captivity captive and gave gifts to men we probably heard he's some of these things before well that's just kind of zoom in who's ever read Psalms 68 and seen that before how it's where where Paul got this idea from okay it's me it's just the whole chapter it's beautiful you'll love it now the Bibles we're for he said remember Paul's talking about Christian unity everybody be humble everybody be submissive to one spirit everybody have your measure and gift in order and he says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men so how's this unity going to be accomplished how is the church going to bear with one another and hold each other up in love it's through the gifts of the Holy Spirit now that he ascended but what is it but he also de-scented first and I love this the way up is down amen the way for Christ to be seated at the right hand of the Father the way for him to get up was first the sand amen and church the way for us to get ascended into a position or send it into ministry or ascending into some place or an adoption with God we've got a humble ourselves amen the best way I know to humble yourself is to pray and see how little you can become to see how nuts is to see how much you can realize I actually don't know god help us all help me amen help us all verse 10 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things so once he resurrected him and sat down the Holy Ghost now through the Holy Ghost he can fill all things yea he can fill this church he can fill that church he can fill and he wants to feel this church praise God he wants to fill everything I'll say like this he should fill our hearts he should fill our minds our words our testimonies everything we should do he should fill all of our lives amen because he's ascended now praise God and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers well you know pastors aren't us pastors aren't as special as the Prophet you know and the prophets got the say at the Lord you see how that devil slips it don't get me wrong the Prophet has a very special job the pastor can't touch it but in the same way brother Bram said I can never be a faithful pastor because I didn't have that gift I'm not faithful he said a successful he says that I can never because I had a wandering spirit which means he had to go out and evangelize he had to go prophesy here prophesy there prophesied there foretell things and had to get the discernment and show the son of man gift all around the world but see we think well we've got exalted people above people we've got to be all on this level now don't get me wrong apostles higher than and prophet pasta is the highest gift and prophets and teachers it goes on down I'm not sure which is louis pasteur evangelist I'll just say pastors or lowest praise God that just fits me the best will just be the lowest to the pastors but either way a table that doesn't exalt anybody above Christ Christ is high above all things he's ascended above all the prophets Christ is ascended above all the Apostles because Christ is the high priest and apostle of our profession Amen hallelujah now notice the order Jesus first descended and then he ascended and led captivity captive and then he gave preaching gifts unto men to keep the church unified no no when the last time you heard this but let's listen to brother Branham dramatized Jesus's descent and essentially always here in the Easter time but let's look at again this morning did you know there was three levels of descent brother Branham said there's three levels there was lost souls then demons and then Satan that's her brother BAM said there was three levels but man Allah said I can see him now this after he's crucified let's dramatize this I can see him coming down into the first dimension of lost souls open up the door that wailing mass of beautiful women and nuts from the days of Noah wretched hags men all screaming and crying torment oh they're screaming oh if I could only get out of here this is Jesus as theophany had now descended in the lower parts of the earth and the first door knocks on are all those who have rejected the gospel all the way since the time of Adam all the way down to the time of Christ it was Noah's group Enochs group everybody that rejected Christ was there and they're all screaming in torment and they all just want a drop of water that's all they want they all just want to go back and witness to their loved ones that they'll be saved but now is the time to witness to our loved ones amen now is the time God will let them come back God might give them a dream about their lost loved one or something like that but God is not gonna let them come back because a miracle is not enough to save a person has to love Christ a person has to repent of their own sins amen America was not enough to do it you have to have your own experience at the cross amen hallelujah he knocked on the door the door swung open there stood the son of living God and a celestial body said I am the son of God that Enoch said would come with 10,000 the Saints I'm the one that Noah spoke up I'm the woman's seed from the Garden of Eden so look his first stop is to let them know all these prophets preached about me and I'm real amen hallelujah those preachers were right in other words Jesus is standing with the preachers amen all the faithful preachers who truly preach the message of the hour Jesus said look at it I what they were talking about Here I am amen see he won't let one word fall to the ground amen if it's God's Word it will not return void if God spoke it it has to happen hallelujah he said I'm the one that knows spoken I'm the woman seed from the Garden of Eden four thousand years before that oh my the heavens had just testified of me he said the release and the Earth testified of me with the earthquake Judas testify to me the Roman soldier testify to me the father tested me now you've got to know that I'm here to fulfill the Word of God Dayman he stands there in front of these screaming multitudes of tormented individuals letting them know everyone testify to me you should have believed me why didn't you believe my testimony see this is judgment right they were getting ready for judgment the white throne they're getting ready for the white throne in two thousand short years every demon nodi was there oh when he was on earth they screamed in horror we know who you are the Holy One of God they knew him even if preachers didn't know him they knew who he was and they screamed let us out there screaming and Jesus is standing right there and they're saying let us out of this prison house and he said why didn't you repent and Jesus slammed the door on them now we're talking about an angry judge now right now he's merciful right now come to him and he'll receive you but after death there's no more mercy it's judgment on down he went in below to the demons down through the line of demonology they screamed and hollered and got back they ran back from him they know where they went when he cast him out of the demons of the man of Ghaderi they went to the swine and choked themselves they'd seen the presence of that Holy One coming walking through there they hit like a bunch of roaches on when the lights is turned on in summertime when they're knowing on an apple core put me in mind of the some preachers when you turn the gospel light on they scatter don't go there and hear that don't go to that church over on Fortuna Drive they're a bunch of holy rollers hey don't go they preach all that holiness and women can't cut their hair and then gotta have a baptism of the Holy Ghost and be a real man and can't wear shorts and I can't cuss and swear or go to movies enough that's the kind of Holy Ghost group I want to be a part of amen I'm not no roach I'm one of God's holy ones praise God amen but see the roaches scatter from that light they don't like the light of this message being preached oh yeah no I'm sorry I already read that yeah let me go down in the darkness he said they can nimbly go but turn the light on one time that's right all right the next thing he did he come on down through that other Trinity so he's our mother three levels on down into hell I can see him go up to the door Saint walked up the doors at oh so you finally got here did you yes I'm here I thought I had you when I killed Abel I thought I'd shot you when I got Abel I was sure I had you when I drowned Daniel the lines then or throat him when I beheaded John I thought I had you then well when you was on the cross I thought I had you but finally you've arrived Jesus said yes I've arrived and I've arrived for one purpose you have put fear and chills over the people of God long enough I'm come down to take over that's right oh he said I'm the Virgin born son of God he said oh but I've got a right Adam sinned he said but my blood still wet on the cross that paid for the price of sin amen amen Satan had a ransom er he had a debt upon the people the because of their sin debt when they sinned they ordered debt a punishment had to be paid but Jesus was punished he paid the ransom and the ransoms been paid and now there's no more punishment for the believer praise God he said you can't hold us down here the debt has been paid hallelujah he said now I come down to take over give me the keys of death in hell he done give the keys of the kingdom to Peter the church yes sir he said give me the keys of death and he'll you notice when he rose he had them hanging on his side and said give me the keys of death and hell he reached over and grabbed Satan by the neck throwed him down put his foot on him reached over and grabbed him off never had to held down an animal before and pull something off that's what Jesus that he threw Satan out like an animal held him down and took the keys off him sounds like our Lord's a pretty good wrestler amen we know Jacob knows that too but God let Jacob win right so he could have he could feel like he overcame praise God that's what Jesus didn't say he said you fooled the people long enough get back in there where you belong he hang them on his side he said I'm the boss now my blood has been shut up there on the cross for their mission of sins and for sickness you can't keep them there any longer there will be people who will believe me you can't bind them up with sickness you can't bind them up with fear they will believe amen will you believe this morning Church you've got to believe he took the keys of death and hell so you could believe amen and not doubt and not fear he said here he comes climbing up brother she's coming near daylight so it's almost

brother of his own son amen dori he said over here in paradise lay some Souls Abraham Isaac Jacob Sarah those who've been faithful believing the promise of the prophets they're laying there waiting with only the blood of bulls and goats a shadow or type of his blood I can see him going to paradise Abraham knocks and said who are you he believed that Abraham couldn't recognize him he said I'm the seed of Abraham I'm your CNA men I can hear Daniel say what that's the stone I've seen hewed out of the mountain without hands I can hear Ezekiel said I saw him coming with such speed to look like he was powerful with dust on nurse feet he said I can hear the prophets say Jacob I wrestled with him all night at the river before I crossed over they all recognized them oh this is my seed this is the we lament of the wheel this is the angel I wrestled amen and then John he said John the Baptist recognized him and Jesus said all I brethren gird up your loins the resurrection is near it's about 15

you're the stone there stood on the mountain Ezekiel said you're the wheel in the middle of the wheel and then with that wheel had seven eyes just like Christ had seven eyes in the book of Revelation amen Jacob said II's the one that racial Russell Johnson he's the one I baptized at the River Jordan Abraham said I saw him in the RAM of consecration that's Jehovah Jireh the three Hebrew suitors that we saw he was the fourth man in the fire John said I saw him standing on the earth in that day and I was standing next to him in a new body hallelujah ha ha Jonah said hi so he said I knew him three days and nights in the whales belly praise God honey there you go Sam said I knew him when he met us in flesh in the tent and to discern my heart behind the tent Ruth said I knew him through my husband boys for he is the lord of our harvest a man Moses said I knew him as the rock and the wilderness and that's the pillar of fire amen David said I wrote about him I've seen him he's the Holy One of Israel who had seen no corruption his boom started him and he's the one that screamed my God my God why hast thou forsaken me Jeremiah said I knew him he was the one that was weeping in me over Jerusalem hallelujah and Isaiah said I saw him that's the Lord who is high lifted up he's the one who's trained filled the temple I've seen him let's go with him hallelujah glory buh-bam said Jesus told me that you were waiting on me for 4000 years under the blood of goats and bulls which could not take away or bring you into my presence the presence of the Father but I've shed my blood to take it away now we're on our road home come on you're you said Abraham said come on Sarah catch you by the arm I could hear a burst Abraham say my lord he said yes my survey what do you want Abraham can we make a whistle-stop in Jerusalem I'd like to look down the Old Town over at a place where me and say are roaming around so much and she says sure I'm gonna be up 40 days and nights with my disciples got to give them some more lectures before they go you believe in lectures we all probably cringe and think about all the lectures we had in high school in college but Jesus said I'm not going to do it he said I'm gonna go there I'm gonna give them lectures to straighten them out my disciple has been scattered they smoke their Shepherd and the sheep are scattered but I'm gonna go lecture them to get them to obey my word of God he said yes he said okay Abraham we're gonna make a little whistle stop so brother says look Jesus when he died he was an idol in the tomb we think he was just laying there dead but he was down still conquering he went down and took the keys away from Satan he's got the keys to both death and hell tonight he said because I live you can live off so amen Oh everywhere Jesus goes he's conquering amen he can conquer in your lives this morning as well but medicine about that time the angel of God rolled away the stone there's an earthquake all over the earth and the Bible said that many the bodies the Saints that slepping him arose and come out of the grave into mortal bodies like his own glorious body I can see Caiaphas standing saying what was all that noise this morning you priests the priests say I don't know the only thing there's people appearing everywhere around the city some of them claim their old Saints that's resurrected and the Bible said when they rose they would appear unto many and the Bible said on the resurrection there was a great earthquake he said well Caiaphas said I don't know say who is that young couple over there and it's Sarah and Abraham walking along saying look at here honey you remember that old place where I used to come down that hill yonder oh yeah I remember that what we're being watched he just vanished like that kind of a body that he had he went right into the building through walls they didn't even know his own glorious body they're walking here on earth and appearing to people yes there's your 40 days hallelujah he said let me tell you something on after 40 days Jesus's feet begin to lift from the ground one day oh that's gonna happen again Church amen that was actually the last rapture where the fifth rapture right there's six raptures the fourth rapture was when Jesus came back and then one day his feet just started raising up in the air one day our feet will be swallow up in life and our feet are glorified feet what's not rising in the air praise God hallelujah and he said this disciples go into all the world and preach the gospel he's I believe in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe he said you're gonna call you're gonna be called fortune-teller you're gonna be called devil you're gonna be called everything there but you're going to cast out devils he said lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover here he goes up I can see Sarah Abraham all of them joining with him so he goes up first and all the other Saints start joining him as he goes up in the cloud oh my here they go up past the movement stars Jesus is that they had God's own son is the leading one the Old Testament Saints behind him walking hallelujah they come in sight of the great big city yonder that's built for square pearly gates I can hear all the Old Testament Saints with their great Victor walking in the front of them see he led captivity captive right great conquer oh he's a mighty Conqueror since he rent the Bayonne - here is what the Old Testament Saints I can hear them holler lift up ye everlasting gates and be lifted up and let the King of glory come in he said I can hear the angels say what was that lift up ye everlasting gates and be lifted up and let the King of glory come in I can hear the angels holler who is this King of glory the Lord of Hosts mighty in battle he is the king of glory hallelujah don't you know he had a great battle he just overcame for us with the weight of the entire world sins upon him he battled for you and I and he that we don't have to battle alone he was the last believer to battle alone because God forsook him and now when we go through our battles we might feel it but we're not he said I died and raised that you don't have to be alone praise God that's the battle he bound it in though the Garden of Gethsemane he batted all the way to the cross of Golgotha he battled to row a balun hail a man he beat up Satan he beat up those demons he battled and he's a mighty Conqueror and looked at him come into heavenly places amen the Bible says this and guess who guess who prophesied this David David prophesied of the rapture the crucifixion about everything in jesus's life they had the crucifixion everything the Bible so lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors and the King of glory shall come in who is this King of glory the angels are like who is this King of glory the Lord strong and mighty the Lord mighty in battle lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up or you'll everlasting nor so see it's the Saints angels Saints angels they're just they're taking or talking back one for another it's like a song that answers itself right it's like an answering bridge back and forth who is this King of glory he said the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory hallelujah perhaps I can see Gabriel walk out there with his chest throw back press the button beep you don't haven't had buttons I didn't know that open come the gates down through the streets went Jesus victorious with the Old Testament Saints right down through the streets the angel now here's another time when I said the angel press the button the gates lifted up Jesus and the Old Testament Saints right Rock down through the city of Jerusalem the conquer all the Saints following him can you imagine the procession 4000 years worth of saints Jesus is walking through there he's got the keys with him he's got us just like his face was set toward Calvary I believe his face was set for the throne of God I'm gonna sit down I came here to take over hit up because that's his home you know what I mean but he was there to sit physically on the throne and 4,000 years worth of saints are right behind him I imagine Jesus walking he's all under control but I imagine those Saints in their new bodies they're saying hallelujah praise the Lord look your brother so there's angels I wonder if they're giving high fives as the Angels down the rows then praise God look at this we're here all these things we hope for all these things we waited for it was all true praise God and everything we're hoping for everything whatever leaving for it's all true hallelujah the Ramson angel press the button the pearly great swung open right down through the city Jerusalem come this great mighty conquer bringing the Old Testament Saints the angelic bands are playing and the angels shouting angels with trumpets shouting or if they're saying halo-halo line of Judah or holy is the lamb worthy is the lamb oh my and there's that there's bands there's angels singing shouting as they're playing and all the saints walking in this great mighty victory procession hallelujah and he was the mighty conquer he had the keys of death and hell hanging on aside going right down a past the palaces of glory till they got through the throne or glory and he said father here they are I remember that's the invisible spirit now there's not a body there he is the body of God so there's a there's a voice just like there's a voice when yous baptized right what the voice came from heaven said this is my son and yet there's the body so there's a thrill with no one sitting on it although there's an eternal spirit on that throne there's an invisible eternal spirit and so jesus walks up he said father here they are here's the here's although is all the jewels of my ministry ha ha ha these are all the fruits of my labors he said they were even faith on your word that I'd come someday some of them waited 4,000 years some waited 3000 some way to 2,000 some waited 500 malachi waited 400 but everyone as long as they waited they all got the same reward amen just like Jesus parables of the $11 worker amen everybody that works for Jesus gets the same reward the only rule reward we want is eternal life hallelujah amen he said I've conquered both death and hell he stands there before all the angels and the thrones of God there's a rainbow round about you look father I went through the battle praise God I imagine all the Saints started crying they saw the scars in his in his hands and his feet maybe the scar maybe I don't know how he showed me an aside I don't know if he give it or not but he had the proof I been to war father I've done what you called me to do I fought this great battle and I'm a mighty Conqueror he said he walked right up the prends at the father said father here they are they all died in faith looking to the time and I can hear him say well done my son climb up here on my right hand until I make all your enemies your footstool so how long is Jesus going to sit there he's going to sit there till every enemy of Christ is under his feet remember the Bible says that Romans that Christ will shortly put all put Satan under your feet Oh hallelujah amen I believe Jesus wants to help us for all of our enemies under our feet this morning I believe that because Jesus is waiting there until that happens until all the Holy Ghost field Saints give every enemy under their feet amen because when the enemies get under the Saints feet it's like they're under the feet of Christ because the Saints are a part of the body of Christ amen look at brother Graham said I can see him standing there the angelic bands here come the Old Testament Saints he said father these are those that died he said well done my son climb up here on my throne and set down on my right hand till I make every enemy or foot sail for one of these days I'm going down to Binghampton New York so brother have interprets this story for us the father said stay here until I support all enemies under my feet in other words I've got a visit Binghampton New York and I've got to put the enemies of Christ under my feet oh thank you Jesus that means Christ was going to come to Akron to put every enemy of yours under his feet you can't set that's why God has called us here this morning to help us for every enemy under our feet hallelujah that's why he died he died to do this he said I'm gonna send you back again to get everybody that dies in the faith so he got the first Old Testament he said I send you back though to get the New Testament once amen there is the great mighty conquer setting at the right hand of the of majesty of God tonight in his presence making intercession on anybody here that will dare to take him by faith and God will send the Holy Ghost down to see you you into the kingdom of God hey man you know the Lord Church can you see this this is why Jesus set down Jesus set down and then he said I'm gonna send the gifts down and these preaching gifts will unite the body this is God's plan to put all the demons under our feet amen so we would go to church here preaching believe the preaching when it's preached from the word and then let that word take effect in our lives receive that word believe that word let owpain that word let that word live in our heads and that would put Satan under our feet hallelujah sickness habits right addictions temptations whatever it is the blood of Jesus Christ is here to help us put all of our enemies under our feet let me go back to that scripture now I'll go to Roman's let's read that I didn't have this in my notes but I'm gonna go there who bruise Satan okay so verse Romans 16 19 and 20 for your obedience has come abroad unto all men I'm glad therefore on your behalf but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you amen what is our desires believers our desires believers is to let God's gifts flow through God's body keep unity but also he'll forgive strengthen encourage direct prophesy grant wisdom through the gifts the five preaching gifts of the Holy Spirit and by doing that we become the Joshua we become the conquerors and every place we put our foot is our possession we can possess our homes for the glory of God we can possess our workplaces for the glory of God amen you can possess your body here for divine healing you can possess that that's an area where you can step in and you can possess that and Satan will go under your feet as you believe the Word of God amen God who's going to do this the God of peace is going to do this as the Word of God has preached to you we receive the Word of God and that very God who sent his word will back his word up amen and he has to bruise Satan under your feet shortly so that you are more than a conqueror praise God how many believe that Scripture absolutely it's the victory we must get victory through the power of God now go to our first cookie in 612 this scripture just come to my mind if you're battling a the scripture that helped me get victory some brother from South Africa was texting me asking about addictions and I said brother I said this is the scripture that brought me victory all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient or necessary all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any at one point in my life I didn't think I could give up chewing tobacco or didn't think I could give up smoking but when I saw the scripture I realized there is no power that can take me unless I submit myself to it I do not have to be brought under the power of any and so it is with dishonesty so it is with lust so it is with greed so it is with worldly things we've got to remember that we do not be brought under the power of anything we have power over it and when we obey the word of God the obedience factor there when we obey God that's when we're making footsteps of possession that's what we're possessing the land is when we're obeying the Word of God amen hallelujah now let's go to another one I got this one on my mind I didn't plan on this but I am gonna go there let's go to sin gurnius seven now if you know the background this Paul rebuked the Corinthians in the first book in the second book he starts talking about that letter he said now I rejoice now this is singer than seven nine now rejoice not that you're made sorry but that you sorrow to repentance see even apologize if he hurt their feelings I mean if you're sinning I'm not gonna apologize for hurting your feelings because it's not me hurt your feelings it's Chrysler in your feelings so see I'm not rejoicing over I made you sorry but I'm rejoicing because you sorrowful to repentance and this last couple years I've seen people weep alligator tears up here but never get to repentance and you probably know what I'm talking about I'm not talking about about individuals what I'm saying is that I've seen it God has proved to me I can pray with someone for an hour and a half and they can cry for an hour and a half but if they're not ready to die out there crying they're just crying they're just sorry they did it but there was no death to self amen and that's what it takes in your life if you and you and I want to bruise Satan under our feet we've got to die too that that just feels sorry for everybody feels sorry for it now you have to be feel sorry enough to cry you know because the by or by Bannister there's no such thing as a dried confession if somebody dies and you love them and you don't cry something's wrong with you not them you right we must cry we must feel the pains but look what the Bible said here for you made sorry after a godly manner that you might receive damage by us and nothing see if I made you sorry from the Word of God then I did damage you I'll try to help you for godly sorrow worketh to herself salvation not to be repented of but the saw of the world work of death and that's what I've seen over and over for hours praying with people and they're sorry and crying but they're not godly sorrowful their worldly sorrowful and Satan will never be bruised under they feet until they take their spiritual foot and say die get out of my life I'm done with this I'm never going back I know I'm getting the victory Satan's bruised under my foot praise God when was the last time you stomped a little bug like well it was the last time you did that well I was recently down in the basement you know and there's a centipede down there boy I hate centipedes and it surprised me it's like 6:00 in the morning and the Senate B crawls out not just jump up like yeah I wasn't ready for I'm just oh my you know just trying to wake up and I kept missing and all of a sudden I just I kept missing with my foots I just took my hand I went smash and I had to bruise that centipede under my hand but this I could have I could have just let it go but if you if I want to see that being dead I've got to bruise it under my hand and if we were to see something dead some habit ER or some thought or some temptation if we want to see a dead we've got to reach out and crush that thing but listen you got to take the strong hand of faith and slay that thing and say die get out of my life you laziness amen get out of my life you unbelief spirit hey man get out of my life you green spirit get into my life you lust of the flesh praise the Lord get out of my life temptation from hell get out of my life and you're never coming back amen see for behold the self same same thing that you saw after a godly sort see when you really repent it'll produce carefulness in you you will start being careful how you live your life that's how you know you repented you're now careful you're making sure you're not doing this in you're very careful how you live your life remember when a have repented huh me know what the Bible said how did he walk after that lightly which means carefully even a have repented now we know he was lost we know that but even for a while he was careful how he was acting and careful Church we should be careful every time we repent if we come in here and say I'm sorry but then we're not careful we walk out we never repented it was worldly sorrow and not godly sorrow how many one godly sorrow you've got to mean it you've got to mean it like you've never met many before see it clears yourself in other words like Satan you can set that bottle of whiskey before me I'm gonna just stand there huh no I'm not gonna be tempted by it I'm gonna prove if I walk into a family situation there's beer on the table or something like that I used to drink I'll just run I'll just stand right there and I'll be I'll be clearing myself because I won't partake of it Oh Jesse don't you want another a puffer don't you another drink no sir I'm clear of this matter praise God I've got Satan under my feet God has bruise Satan under my feet praise God hey man are you with me Church see what Ignatian see that that fiery ain't a nation when we really repent were so upset at that sin that we're upset we're mad with it we've got a righteous and a righteous anger against that sin that's how you know we're you repented well never gonna cut my hair again hope I just dead ends cut I just want to look pretty I just want to wear those high heels one more time but when you really repent you hate those things you hate those kind of shows right you hate those kind of thoughts you hate those kind of plans you hate those type of conversations you start hating it because now you've got the Spirit of Christ in you what the hemant desire that's a burning desire what zeal what revenge when someone really repents they want to get revenge on the devil and they want to put the devil under their feet when you really repent when you're really sorry about it you want to get revenge on the devil all those wasted hours and minutes they're yours now from the start to the finish saying you aren't going to steal any more of my time God's getting all of my time I've got zero for see in all things you've approved yourself to be clear of this matter well I can trust brother amen now or I can trust brother Jesse now around the finances I can trust this sister with this I can trust them with this kind of ministry because they've clearly repented of it Satan is bruised under their feet and we're talking about the measure we all said we had a measure we all said we want our measure to glorify God what can God trust you with it is there anything that's caused you to stumble we've got to repent of that if anything is keeping us from the ministry God's called us to do we've got to kill that remember either you cut it off or God's gonna cut you off member that sermon from two Sundays ago either you cut it off or God's gonna cut you off from the anointing and the church said let me find a place to close here I got six minutes oh my well how's that gonna happen all right let's if we can let's go to Psalm 68 that one closed I don't had a few scriptures on here's the origin Psalm 68 what a beautiful man this was glorious the Bible so inspired so I'm 68 remember David cried out my God my god a thousand years before Christ did he cry he wrote about my bone stare at me and and my flesh and all these things and that was 500 years before crucifixion was even invented that's how inspired that man was he was prophesying in his singing hey man I just want to sing but what about prophesy prophesying while singing oh my Psalm 68 this was written probably let me get the year on this Scofield has a timeline here I think all these groups were written in the same year around the same year well they're not listed any years here what have I done I must have misunderstood that well anyways it's about a thousand years before Christ cuz that's when Solomon reigned a thousand years before Christ so David was right before that Psalm 68 this is - the chief musician a song or song of David so this is the origin look at verse 1 let God arise let his enemies be scattered remember this is the text where Paul's gonna look back and say my Jesus's resurrection is in here plus the preaching gifts of the fivefold ministry God is arising in Christ just like God arose in the preachers are you with me let God arise and his enemies be scattered sure sometimes I think if we just sometimes take coming to church for granted there Satan bruising power here this morning Church because Jesus set it up and there's just as much a measure me as there isn't any of you but we've got to believe that and we got to repent if we want to see Satan bruised under our feet praise God let God arise let us enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him as smoke is driven back so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of the Lord so this is God coming forth and there's no enemy that's gonna stand before him verse 3 but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before God yay let them exceedingly rejoice hallelujah sing unto God sing praises to his name extol him that rides upon the heavens by his name Jah and rejoice before him now look at this who's in God's army is it the up and ups and the famous people and the popular people look at verse 5 a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is God I'm sorry is God in His holy habitation so remember all these enemies are melting like wax before him as he goes forth in victory and behind them are all these fatherless widows cast out nobody's good for nothing people and there are rejoicing enemies are burning but all these castaways and nobody wanted them good-for-nothing people rejected the world they all rejoicing there in the army of Christ amen glory that's just like David number one David first left saw remember he went out into the cave and who came with him all the reads the Bible said all the rejected all those that were in debt all the debtors all those who couldn't pay off their debts all of us couldn't pay off our sin-debt either we all were in debt we all had sin debts and all we knew as a well Saul is a nice guy but he's got a evil spirit on him I just want to follow the man who's got the Holy Spirit on him as all far as my situation is I know a man with the Holy Spirit on him I know if I follow that man God will bless me how then three and it was a smaller army it was the rejected army and this is the army that David sees with God the widows the fatherless the rejected the debtors they're all rejoicing because Christ is leading them oh my verse 6 God said the solitary in families oh look I have no family I know family God will give you a family member gia said I promised you a hundredfold if you leave your family I'll give you a hundredfold in this world and the world to come if you need a family God's got one for you hallelujah he

before us let's recognize he's burning all of our enemies Church now that's if you're following him if you're repenting and you're following him if we're not repenting you're drying the wilderness it's time to repent and join Jesus get back with Jesus's great victory parade oh yes it is Oh God when thou wentest forth before thy people see he led captivity captive see when that it's march through the wilderness say la the earth shook the heavens also John - the Friends of God even sign on itself was moved to the presence of God the God of Israel now a goddess sent a plentiful rain whereby thou disconfirmed thine inheritance when it was weary that congregation that dwelt therein the how o God has prepared of thy goodness for the poor got any porn here how about poor in spirit God's got something for you I just I feel so poor I feel like I don't have any riches Christ has come to me and I'll give you riches I'll give you gold tried in the fire hey that's right this is the kind of people that join his army the outcasts those that need to see Satan under their feet that's right the Lord gave the word verse 11 great was those great was the company of those that published it hey man the preachers prophets kings of armies that flee up a pace and she that tarried at home divided the spoil though you have leaned among the pots ye shall beat ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and the feathers with yellow gold you're gonna be covered in silver redemption and covered in gold deity your wings are gonna be covered with that you're covered in what the Friends of God you're covered in God's blessings oh my and he calls you a little dove oh that's what the Solomon called his wife my dove my sweet one my fair one come away verse 15 the hill of God is as the hill of Bashan and high hill as the hill of Bashara bhishan was a natural hill was the highest of the hills in that area but David saying God's hill is actually greater than that one Wiley P high hills what is the will of God I'm sure what is the hill which God desired to dwell in no sir this is the hill which God desire to dwell in yea the Lord will dwell in it forever so he's saying all these natural hills that are higher don't exalt yourself above God God is gonna raise up a higher Hill than that amen God's gonna raise up a future home for you and I amen it's right the charity of God or 20,000 even thousands of angels the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place now has ascended on high and has led captivity captive this is the chapter thou has received gifts for men yay for the rebellious also that the Lord might dwell among them blessed be the Lord who weekly loaded us with benefits anybody catch yet I mean I read that wrong yearly or every year I get a real good blessing from the Lord Oh every decade I'll get a real blessing from the Lord the Bible said everyday God is showering benefits upon you just for being a believer how many are witness to that oh I made it through yesterday hallelujah did you see his benefits yesterday you see the life the breath to health the food to shelter the clothing the peace the prosperity the grace you see all that yesterday church we ought to thank God first daily benefits amen he that is our God is the god of salvation unto God the Lord belong the issues from death I'm gonna pause right there here's what FB Meyer says he said this is one of the grandest ODEs in literature it was proudly composed when the Ark was brought and triumph from the house of obed-edom to the newly acquired hill of the Lord which was David bringing the ark back the second time when he filed all the word it is evidently a processional him intended to be sung by the bands of white robed priests and levites in this paragraph the ark was lifted to the shoulders of his Bears while a measured strain was chanted then as the procession moved forward the march of the wilderness was recited so they raised up the ark and the Bible said let God arise and let his enemies be scattered I wonder of us are spiritually sitting today just sitting just trying to be live the Christian life I wonder how many of us could say I need to arise and let God's Word live in my life I need to get up I'm sitting on the Lord it has to arise it has to come to the forefront of my lips it has to come to the forefront of my actions it has to come to the forefront of my daily life David saying let God arise let's move forward okay let's move on let's get the word in its proper place in our lives amen let gather eyes his enemies will be scattered your enemies will scatter before you we just gotta let God arise amen lift him to the place where he must be in our lives let God arise these opening words are borrowed from the former lose bought used by Moses you Moses said that when they would travel Moses would say let God arise they see the pillar of fire moving let God arise we're moving forward and David's saying let God arise here comes Christ he comes to his holy hill and he's giving gifts unto men never forget the daily benefits of the Holy Ghost amen it comes to the preaching of the word because it's not the preacher it's God's Word in the preachers mouth amen let me see this one you listen to our feet notice he led captivity captive I like what this writer said matthew henry he said jesus was the death of death and that beautiful jesus was the death of death and so he was also the captivity of captivity he destroyed that through death and Jesus brought slavery into slavery I say it like that those Old Testament Saints were enslaved they were slaves under the blood of bulls and goats they can never leave so Jesus said I'm using I'm enslaving slavery I'm taking them other slavery and now they're gonna be love slaves to me because that's what they wanted in life oh yes that's so we would've life how many want to be a love slave to Christ Paul said I am a prisoner of Christ I'm a slave to Christ Jesus that's all I want did you say that when you prayed your confessional prayer Lord I just want to serve you as a prisoner all the days of my life I just want to be enslaved I just want to be captured I just want to be contained in your love and Jesus told those four thousand because you wanted to be enslaved to me now I'm gonna bring your slavery into slavery I'm gonna defeat slavery by the slavery of taking every demon under my control I've got the keys of death in hell amen aren't you glad Church aren't you glad to be in this army by the grace of God we're lures once you come here we'll get ready for a little just a to call prayer if anyone desires prayer here we're daily loaded with his benefits daily we must not forget his benefits let God arise and his enemies be scattered how many love the Word of God praise the Lord this do you play in the cross be my glory ever Jesus keep me near the cross every one of us has been given the gift or the measure of Christ you're the only one who knows am i letting this gift arise by letting God arise is this gift being used for the glory of God is my life being perfected the Bible said it should be through the fivefold ministry am i being edified the Bible says it should be is my faith being United with all the believers around the world it should be am i growing in the knowledge of the Son of God am i seeing myself grow into the stature of Christ it should be we should see our lives becoming more like Christ character if not and there say it needs to be bruised if we don't see these things there's probably some spiritual centipede crawling on the floor you got to crush that thing and it can't be just like oh I'm sorry about it it's got to die and then you got to take revenge upon that it's of our heads for a moment in a moment I'll just call if anyone desires prayer but as we pray think about your life is there something that you just need to see it under your feet [Music] does it feel like God's measures not rising up it's not leading the way in your life maybe you've got other things lead your life and God's Word is not leading your life the Bible says let God arise if we let God arise his enemies have to scatter and that's nothing more than quoting the word believing the word crucify anything passing down anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God the promise of god let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just love you today thank you for the word that we've heard today Lord your Bible said that this measure of the gift of Christ is given to every man and woman [Music] Lord you
