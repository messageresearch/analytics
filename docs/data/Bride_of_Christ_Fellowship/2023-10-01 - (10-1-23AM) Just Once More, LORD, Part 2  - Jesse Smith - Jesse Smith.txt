========================================

Judges chapter 16 verse 28 I'd like to just preach a part two on just once more Lord I'd like to preach part two felt like I didn't quite get all the way there was a few more quotes I wanted to read and then tie in some other thoughts judges 16:28 with communion I'll try to watch a time maybe you know I preached for about 49 minutes there on Wednesday night I don't know if I'll do that today I might preach an hour today um kind of see how we go by God's grace but I do want to be mindful of the time here of course judges 16 verse 28 let's read that together on three one two three and Samson called unto the Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God that I may be at once Avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes amen we saw that on Wednesday night that it's okay to want revenge but it's not revenge over someone else it's Revenge from our past mistakes praise God and we want to make up for our lost time we want to make up for our mistakes and we want to do what's right and glorify the Lord hallelujah uh may God add his Blessing to reading of his word you may be seated there by God's grace we'll start with a little review and then in a little bit Casa I'll have some quotes here but not right now I want to get to those eventually here so uh we're thankful again for all the efforts today by God's grace we'll have the Lord's Supper here in just a moment by God's grace so we looked at Wednesday night on O Lord once more I think that's the first time I've ever preached that by the grace of the Lord I want to overview just briefly uh Samson's life I found this just a brief overview online and I thought it was nice and summarized it's from a Bible study website um you know we looked at it a little bit but I want to just go over it briefly uh Samson's mentioned at least 38 times in the King James Old Testament and remember he's also mentioned in Hebrews 11 in the Hall of Fame of Faith which is a wonderful testimony of God's grace praise God um because we know the the the the depths that he fell to um now this was new to me I'd forgotten this Samson's name means like the Sun so like we can all see the sunlight right his name means like the sun I thought that was very interesting you know uh because we must be like Christ who is the Sun that shines brightest today Jesus Christ amen the Son of God right I thought wow what a beautiful thought you know uh he was named by the angel remember he was named by the angel to be a Nazarite unto God and the angel said he's like the sun Hallelujah I think it's a very very wonderful thing we know Jesus was a Nazarite to the father as far as obeying every word of God hallelujah of course we know Jesus drank wine and things like that but it didn't impact him of course the wine was different again in those days as well but I think it's a very beautiful type here Samson like the son he's not the son but he's to be like the son and we're not the son but we're to be like the son the Bible uh clearly teaches that Romans 8:29 said for whom he did Forno he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son Hallelujah that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them also he called and whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified so we see the whole uh the whole plan of predestination in these two verses Hallelujah church if if God is forming you to be more like Christ then that proves you are predestinated that proves you are forn he forew you he knew about you way ahead of time Hallelujah he chose you in his mind before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and he wants you he's conforming you which means to be shaped or molded he's molding you to be more like Christ we wish it was a one easy one day easy process right but it's not it's through years of of Trials right years of it's a lifetime of learning praise God I'll say like that it's constantly being molded and shaped through different seasons of Life those 14 seasons of life we saw in the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 3 uh there's times of Joy times of dancing but times of mourning as well Hallelujah all the different seasons of life that we go through but in all of it we're being made like unto the Son of God hallelujah I love what Paul said in Galatians 1 he said it when it pleased God 1 verse1 15 he separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace think of think of the children that don't get out of their mother's womb you know the right way or uh even you know you know miscarriages or whatever or the things that that happen think of the children that don't get separated from their mother's womb but God ordained it that we that each one here today was separated from the mother's womb praise God and called by the grace of God so God's grace called you Hallelujah we would say we were walking our own path we're all walking in the desires of the lust of the Flesh and lust of the mind but then you heard a call it was Jesus calling you praise God hallelujah amen hallelujah and God and Paul said to reveal his son in me that it might that I might preach him among the Heathen I immediately conferred not with flesh and blood so I think I think this is beautiful you know along with that other verse from Colossians 1:26 and 27 Christ in you the hope of glory so Samson was like the sun and we're to be conformed to the sun Hallelujah the sun is to be revealed in our lives oh isn't it beautiful praise God to reveal his son in me so I believe we can get some meaning of that that that Jesus will reveal himself in us I'll say like this to us he'll reveal it to us but also to other people in other words you'll see your life being formed more like Christ and it it'll be revealed to you wow I see Christ he's really being formed in my life amen that that'll make you joyful amen and then other people will see Christ being formed in you praise God Amen they they'll testify and say wow like I had numerous or two people three or four yeah three people tell me this week uh they say I don't know how you do all that Jesse I don't know they told me at work there and I said it's just Christ in me if there's anything good in me it has to be Christ hallelujah amen it has to be Jesus uh conforming me to be like him and is Jesus revealing himself in me praise God Amen Hallelujah and then Jesus said let your light so shine well I thought he's the light he is the light but you're the Lesser light amen he's the sun you're the moon Hallelujah as the Bible says plainly let your light so shine before men in Matthew 5:116 that they may see your good works and glorify your father which in he which is in heaven there's C certain things we we can't we can't hide right we're to do our prayers our fasting our giving of Psalms in secret but there's sometimes everyone's going to see the light and Jesus said let that light shine Hallelujah now brother Ram often says that he said Hollywood shines but the gospel glows well it don't don't Focus too much on those words because the Bible said let your light shine before men right in other words Hollywood has a false light and the real light of Jesus Christ is his spirit being revealed in you praise God Amen you obeying the Bible you living the word of God and that shines because the Jesus said let your light shine before men Hallelujah let it be a real light not a false light not a A personation or a man-made light but let the Divine Light or the Life of Christ the life l i f e Let The Life of Christ be displayed in your life and that's the real light l i g HT of God hallelujah amen those words kind of sound a lot ofik so got to spell him out there now Samson had a miraculous birth exploits but also had failings and but yet is a beautiful picture of redemption in his death hallelujah it's in judges 13-6 it begins with the Philistines harassing the people in the southern part of ancient Israel and Samson is born to deliver them from the Philistines that's the very purpose he was born to deliver someone praise God don't you know Church someone was born to preach the gospel to you yes amen someone was born to raise you to serve God amen amen someone was born to witness to you praise God someone was born to pray for you someone was born to pray for me praise God amen amen this man was born to help the people each one of you were born to help somebody else praise God and somebody was born for you hallelujah amen I like that amen cuz we all have a purpose like brother amen told me before I don't I wouldn't be here without you but I turn around and say brother I wouldn't be here without you I might have quit a long time ago see we got that we're all born for one another praise God Samson was born for them but uh his mom was born for him we wouldn't have Samson without his mother and father praise God and so see it's it's everybody has a purpose we're all tied together in this great plan of God this great economy of God everybody's got a purpose everybody's got a a gifts every everyone has something they're called to do so let's do what God called us to do praise God let's be like Samson let's yield ourselves to the Lord hallelujah now we don't want to be like him in his failures but we can we we what we learn is a type of this we learn a pattern of this that no just no matter how far we might fall no matter the sins we might do God is rich in Mercy hallelujah amen and he'll redeem us praise God and we can still accomplish our purpose of God no matter no matter our failures no matter our struggles will still accomplish God's purpose nobody can thwart God's purpose Hallelujah in other words nobody can stop the plan of God hallelujah amen the Devils can't stop the plan of God for your life God has a purpose and it's going to be accomplished praise God and like brother R said no matter what God has to do to get us to obey him God will get his sons and daughters to to obey him he'll chasen them whatever he must do because he loves them hallelujah amen think about that it was the love of God that is Samson's eyes got plucked out that was God's love that was God's mercy because what would he have kept doing he would have kept laying with the Lila and who knows he probably would have went to some other woman right look at s look at Solomon look at all you know look at David look at these men see it was God's mercy it doesn't look like it it may not feel like it but it is God's love to us hallelujah amen the trials of Life brother man said is God's grace to us and they draw us closer to him Hallelujah next uh he's born Solomon or Samson is Born To The danite woman there and she was healed of her barness she and manoah were instructed to raise him as a Nazarite he was dedicated to serve God to his death Hallelujah serve god with a Nazarite vow till he died Hallelujah and then the Holy Spirit started stirring him and I love how the Sight and Sound kind of kind of dramatizes that he just uh they just the spirit comes on him and then he every Everybody Knows the spirit of God is on Samson I like that and then you know we see him greatly Desiring to marry this Philistine woman of course we see a type here of the Jew and Gentile Church a a young lion attacks him as he travels to the city to take her for a wife and in this first notable Act of strength with his bare hands he tears up and kills the hungry lion with his bare hands right and of course uh brother typed this of course the lion of the tribe of Judah Christ dying right it's like God it's God tearing his son apart the lion right but yet inside of jesus' death there's honey in there amen amen praise God there's honey there's Sweetness in the death of Christ because it means forgiveness Hallelujah the mighty lion has died for us the lion has become the lamb hallelujah amen and there sweetness there makes me want to sing Honey in the Rock praise God but song service is over come on up brothers let's sing the Honey in the Rock real quick here hallelujah now during the wedding celebration he offers his guests a valuable prize if they'll answer a riddle and they're stumped so they have to resort to threatening his uh future wife and they finally get that answer and he gets enraged after that uh he his wife had been uh uh kind of uh not not tricked in that but persuaded to give the riddle and then he went and killed 30 Philistines in order to provide the prize now we see the type in there and of course this is not a perfect type but we can see how um the wife didn't know the secret until the seventh day the seventh Church age it's a beautiful type of what God is doing in this day the seventh angel Revelation 10 the mystery couldn't be finished until the seventh angel had it praise God it's a beautiful type this is a type you'll never hear a denomination church I know cuz I was raised there that people you know even today you know even when I was in the message I still struggled with this until the Revelation came uh cam got the he told me CAM got the he heard another preacher overseas preach it and then cam preach it well when cam preached it was the first time I heard it so I gave cam the credit in the book for preaching that but Cam said well Jesse it wasn't me it was it's another preacher that actually preached that I gave cam the credit because that's the first person I heard it from but it's a beautiful type a Jew marrying a gentile an anointed man under Nazarite vow Jew marrying a gentile wife and there's a mystery for seven days it's a wedding for seven days seven Church ages praise God and the answer is made known on the seventh day praise God oh it's a beautiful type but of course it's not a perfect type because then we know uh she's given a marriage to somebody else right now 3,000 men of Judah decide to turn Samson over to the Philistines in order to avoid rep retribution he seizes on the opportunity to get closer to Israel's Army but once he's turned over to them he finds a Jawbone of a newly uh Dead uh a dead what's that word there mon donkey there you go I don't want to say the regular one I mean I could but I thought you say donkey and he takes that Jawbone and he slays a thousand of them and I heard brother Adam say yesterday he said any anyone that finds an old dead bone out in the wilderness he said a bone of an animal it's easily broken he said but brother Ram said the anointing of God came on him and he slew a thousand men and he said they had helmets on and and and what do they call it the mail the metal mail sheet or clothing on their their their armor and a thousand of them remember I I shared a few weeks ago or I'm sorry last year he was on an elevated place so he was able as they ran to him God just brought them all in and he just wiped them all out praise God God set him on a rock hallelujah amen hallelujah and God sets us on the rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ praise God where it wouldn't seem you'd be able to overcome we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony praise God by Supernatural means we overcome because God has exalted us the Bible said he exalts those who humble themselves Hallelujah so we humble ourselves God exalts us and we're able to conquer all the foes see that's proof you're conquering is because you're here today Hallelujah after all these years and all these months and all these trials you're still here today you're still conquering Samson Hallelujah amen glory after this in judges 15:20 the Bible said he judged Israel 20 years so that's and I think that Sight and Sound beautifully describes that as well that time just passes they know there's an anointed man but then time passes and that's how you know God trains people but that's also how the enemy works you got to be careful in those seasons of quietness right uh God's people can be tempted away from the real thing and that's when s uh Delilah started wooing Samson brother bradam said the Bible said the people of Goda discovered that Samson's in in the city uh he was with the prostitute uh they quickly decide to secretly surround him they wait till morning to kill him but then he leaves the city at midnight with a spectacular show of strength he tears loose the city Gates and he deposits them on top of a hill outside the city I love how they dramatize this this was a literal fulfillment of what God told Abraham Abraham's seed will possess the gates of their enemies amen what a beautiful type amen you know today we think for us it's spiritual right so any area that's maybe in our lives that's weak or overcome or or taken over by the enemy we're able to go into that area and we're able to take back that area of Our Lives we're able to possess the gates that the enemies that the enemies had why because we're Abraham's seed hallelujah amen like like I you know just just giving some simple examples like my life had hatred for my father well God anointed me and I was able to capture those Gates back and now I love my dad amen so see in your relationships you're able to get you're able to go to those Gates and take back what the enemy may have stolen from you because you're Abraham's seed and it's promised it's a word of God you can possess those Gates Again hallelujah amen and I love what Jesus said he said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against you praise God amen amen Hallelujah you're able to take back your Gates and then the Gates of Hell the councils of Hell cannot overcome you praise God hallelujah after this uh the five Philistine leaders employ the services of Delilah to discover how to render him powerless his uh lust and weakness for women coupled with Thea's persistence pays off and she learns the source of his power is his unshaved head his separation to God hallelujah Delilah as he as Samson sleeps shaves his hair off caus him to break the vow and lose his Supernatural strength the Philistines uh imprison him they Gorge out his eyes and they force him to grind in the prison right and that's kind of the background where I didn't preach on Wednesday just to see that again to be aware of that I love brother man says to get our remember on Wednesday brother man said to to get our our power back he said we got to have a another prayer meeting so the opposite is true Samson lost his power by not staying in prayer he lost his power by compromising not living a separated life unto God hallelujah it's a beautiful picture there I love it I keep saying beautiful now you can switch over I got some uh quotes here oh yeah I got to plug in now as I was preaching I went back and listened to it because sometimes I wonder well what was inspired what what did I feel like was a a help and I want to you know this thought came brother Brandon mentioned about mechanics and Dynamics and I don't know if I've ever preached a sermon just on mechanics and Dynamics I know last year uh during the the doctrine series I preached a whole sermon on the latter rain quotes So I know I'm trying to raise your faith but I think this will raise your faith because I help I think it will help you understand mechanics and Dynamics brother Braham applies it in at least six or seven different ways there's many ways to apply this so let me just go through these I try to go quickly here's six illustrations of mechanics and Dynamics he said balum was a an illustration of that balum killed the seven Rams right brother R said he had the mechanics right but not the Dynamics now this is difficult for me to understand because he still had Visions he still had Supernatural in his life and he spoke to God directly okay so it seems like he had some Supernatural work um but that's just one interesting quote there so just again to show how even anyone with the gift everyone has the gift of God anyone who whoever it is they they have to have both mechanics and Dynamics right you got to have the mechanics the simple things you got to have all the foundation but then you got to have the power come upon that all right now I want to read some quotes from Brother BR here's the first illustration it's the train a constructed train with all the parts think of all the parts in a train right versus a moving train that's the first one brother random uh gives he said today with the great intellectual messages we can explain it till you can see the picture but that isn't what we're looking for we're not looking for the mechanics we're looking for the Dynamics of it okay he talks about he said look at this big 16 or 35 coach trained sitting there on the track but if you haven't got any steam in it it takes the dynamic to perform with the mechanics and that's what we need now is to see that okay now so I you know this is of course a good a good scripture or good quote rather you know we can have everything constructed right but we got to have the power to make it move amen now church but all but I want you to catch this both parts are equally important you can have all the spark all the fire all the coals you want but if that Train's not constructed right it ain't going nowhere you can have all the fire fire in that engine but those those wheels are not moving unless every nut and Bol and screw everything is exactly in the right spot but B said we're a bunch of nuts remember that he said he said we're a bunch of nuts you got to have all the nuts in place amen all the nuts and bolts a second illustration he says is the body and the spirit so think of a funeral you have the mechanics there but you don't have the Dynamics he says now my body is the mechanics but my body will not operate without the Dynamics the spirit and the spirit operates my body brings it under control Hallelujah so spiritually let's apply that we're the body of Christ we have made male female children we have preachers we have Ley we have everybody here but everybody has one of the nine gifts of the Spirit that's all mechanics we're all here but it takes the Dynamics Hallelujah to get something done praise God Amen so for people's needs to be met it takes the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit to move through the body of Christ that needs can be met Hallelujah a third illustration brother R said it's like having a checkbook but having no money he said we need both we need checkbook and we need money we can all say Amen to that right brother said in my travel I find two classes of people he said the fundamentals the fundamentals like Baptist and so forth they know where they're at but they don't have any faith in the word right we kind of saw that a little bit last week right they need the reverence they need the reverence in the reverence for the Holy Spirit he says and the Pentecostals has got a lot of faith but don't know who they are so brother said we need need both we need to have faith in God's word and we need to know who we are amen praise God hallelujah we're a Samson praise God right we're an overcoming Church hallelujah we're the blood bought uh completely forgiven uh no condemnation bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and these signs follow us because we're Believers amen I was thinking about you know the signs and wonders you know and just try to make it so simple so back in 2018 when we had the uh that little difficult situation I was telling my wife at that moment I saiding I feel like this is some type of like a wolf's coming after our church and I was I was talking to her about Acts chapter 20 and how uh Paul said wolves are going to come in here and at that very moment brother amen sent me a text and said I just had a dream about wolves attacking the church it was at that exact moment that was a sign to me and I'll tell you that was a Wonder to me because i' have this problem for years and and the very moment I'm quoting the scripture I get a text say we just had a dream that this these people are like wolves attacking us that makes me go wow God cares about me right and I'll just use sister Naomi when she went to Ghana we're all praying you know uh you know with the coid restrictions no one knew the government was going to change that was a great sign to us that's a great wonder I wondered how did God ordain that amen God had all those meetings in Ghana in their airports whever government facilities well we're going to relax the we're going to relax the requirement on this day that just makes you wonder like wow God is really great praise God Amen signs and wonders right signs wonders Miracles when God heals our sick it's a miracle praise God when it just happens and there's no there's no uh explanation for it and and and that's what the church of living God has signs wonders and miracles and church let's make it so simple that we can see Christ Among Us praise God cuz I believe that's what Christ does Amen like I was telling uh like Austin and I were texting yesterday you know we're going to go through different moments of desperation our lives and that really brings out the real part of us it really brings out our character it's like when no no was going to fly you know she was she was in desperation right when I was uh battling that situation I was in desperation right you know each one of us when Austin had the migraine he's in desperation you know God brings us to those moments and how God answers that's God's Vindication that's God's blessing that's God's Fe rushing in to save the day and rescue his people praise God hallelujah he's going to he's going to come in and rescue Emma amen from this uh this legal situation let's believe it by God's grace Hallelujah and so it's it's a it's it's the same thing we got to have money in the bank but we got to know how to write a check praise God there's a a third ill okay that's the same one or did I not change this one okay that's just more on the same thing yeah so yeah we've got to have the power of the spirit so the power of the spirit is the money in the bank but we got to come back to the word to feed this machine we got to know how to mechanically write a check so we got to have both praise God Amen we got to know what the word says and we got to have the power of the word praise God Amen brother said there ought to be a holy power surrounding and this is once more Lord in the church that will make demons flee now what is that it's become a laughing stock what is that mechanics instead of Dynamics now he's doing the tricks he says so I want to bring out this point Dynamics make demons flee if you're living a life above sin the demons have have have left your life the demons have have have flown I don't know yeah that is that the word flown I need some grammar help up here the demons have are fleeing right well that proves you got the Dynamics praise God I hope I said that right by God's grace hope you can understand what I'm saying it's just like the Bible says you know sometimes uh you know any time where where we've resisted the devil the Bible says anytime we' resisted the devil and he flees that proves we've got Dynamics right because it's it's a dynamic it's a holy spirit Power that resists Satan it's two Powers fighting each other right like the angels we talked about remember when Zurg gave that good scripture at my house you know Daniel 10 it's like Angels fighting and wrestling and when Satan finally leaves that means you're the Victor praise God you were more powerful you had more Dynamics but it really wasn't me it was Christ revealed in me praise God wasn't my power it was me yielding to God's power so see the Bible say submit yourselves to God when we're being tempted we got to yield to God obey God resist Satan and they'll flee from you so whether the the the Dynamics or raising the dead or giving sight to the blind or healing from cancer or just getting peace in your life Over The Temptations of God both all those are Dynamic power of God because they make demons flee praise God I've also often said this too you know I don't know why it's been so many years since I've cast out of devil but you know I got to say like this God hasn't sent me many devil possessed people but I want to have the faith if one comes in here we'll be able to do it by God's grace remember with Wendy and Jason remember that one service they both said it was interesting the demons were both on this side of the church now nothing against this side of the church okay but that morning there was something going on and the enemy both of them said the enemy was saying leave leave leave but God got the victory praise God I don't know I don't remember if it was in a song or the preaching or something but the Holy Spirit they both come up for prayer and God helped both of them praise God well what power made them leave it was the dynamic power of Jesus Christ praise God but in one way I'm grateful nobody here is possessed with demons so we don't have to cast them out I'm very grateful for that that means you got Dynamic power amen demons have to flee at the power of Christ hallelujah amen remember demons have a legal right to stay in your life and and stay tormenting you or haunting you until you confess but once you confess and yield to yourself to God those demons have to flee praise God Amen they cannot stay they cannot uh uh they cannot possess a Believer or torment a Believer because he whom the son has set free is free indeed and if you take his freedom and his Liberty and his laws you can drive out the enemy praise God draw night to God James 4:8 says and he will let's say he will ready he will it's an absolute promise of God come closer to God and God will come closer to to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners purify your hearts you double-minded amen now I believe that's the people that are really these people are really these are people are really in sin right here adulterers and adulteresses these people are really deep in sin James is writing to but they can still resist the devil and God will come near to them that's the mercy of God now I just want to read this you know if you haven't read this for a while this kind of struck me this morning uh about Dynamics one of the multitude answers said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and where I'm sorry wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foth and naseth with his teeth and pineth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not he answering him said oh faith of generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straight way the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long ago since Jesus came into him and he said of a child so again that we've had some good questions on demonology we don't know how this Spirit came in but the spirit came in when this child was or saying well this person was much smaller as a child and often times the demon would cast the boy into the fire and into the waters to try to destroy him see that's when you know there's demonic activity when people are trying to be hurt and Satan's trying to take lives he said but if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us boy he asked he he asked the right thing there praise God he found the person that could do something amen he has infinite possibilities Hallelujah if you can do anything well you come to the right person he can do anything praise God if you can do anything I like that see he's still open to God's will if if not I'm demanding my way I want my life to be a certain way no it's open to God's will praise God I heard brother R say it yesterday that that stadle that stad cleff woman who had the baby die and she was going to fly brother random over brother Ram said I had to wait to get a clear-cut decision from God he said he said he said if if the Lord told me to go to the president or graveyard and raise up JFK he said I'd do it he said but I can't do anything until I get a clear word from God and that's why he told all the sick people in that meaning he said first find God's will right find the will of God for your situation and then you can rest on that Hallelujah amen rest on it he said a clearcut decision from God then Jesus now look Jesus challenges him he says if you can do anything he said if you can believe look at him look at him put it back on his faith in other words I need you to believe you got to believe the word of God that's right if you can believe all things are possible to them him that believeth now I think verse 24 is like all of us right we can all relate to this we all know God can do it but we need God's help to believe it praise God Amen same for this cancer case for Jose's health and whatever you know all the requests in the room we all know God can do it but we still need God's grace to give us help that our faith can be raised amen amen hallelujah we all we all know he can but we all got a little human battle with unbelief amen the soul doesn't battle Hallelujah but it's a it's a mind and and and body that battle unbelief and so we need to cry to Jesus Lord help me to believe I do believe it but help me to believe with all my heart praise God amen amen what a beautiful picture of if and if and we we want to find God's Will and then God said now Jesus said now it's on you you you you said if it's on me well I'm going to tell you I'm putting it on you now it doesn't work that way everywh my wife my wife had a good statement the other night we're walking at the park on our date and she said you could teach a lesson on all the different ways God's God heals right and I think that's a good idea so in this case Jesus puts it on him now you've got to believe but remember uh in John chapter 5 Jesus just told that paralyzed man get up and take up your bed and walk he didn't ask him do you believe he just said take it up and walk right now we might complain and say well why didn't you know this person could have complained why is he putting it on me it's for a testimony I'll never give you a trial you can't handle amen hallelujah praise God you can over you I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me praise God sorry sorry man okay these aligners make it a lot harder to preach without spinning even at school I gota be like I love this he said all things are possible if you believe sometimes God will put it on you right like with Jacob why like Austin and I were texting yesterday why does Jacob have to wrestle all night and not everybody else because that was for his testimony he needed that he was going to be Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's the grandson of the father of faith and they're going to be called the the children of Israel a whole nation is going to be named after him my that's right he's going to have 12 sons amen God needs a man who's going to be a leader of a Nation who's going to be example and God gives us the example wrestle it out so you overcome all fear and get a name change Amen to be a prince who has power with man and God hallelujah amen it's for a testimony you never see Abraham having a wrestle all night that wasn't his testimony right each person has a different testimony I love that look the father cried out again desperation God will let you be desperate to bring out your real character you'll find out what you really are in your hardest moments am I going to rely on the world am I going to run back to the world am I going to run to God God a true shot of God will run to God it took Samson a while but he finally run to God it took Samson a lot of laps around that grinding mill a lot of laps a lot ofps but pretty soon all that complaining all that argu or debating whatever pretty soon it turned into God once more have mercy on me I'm now ready to pray I wasn't ready to pray before but now I'm ready hallelujah amen right sometimes it takes cycles of years and months and tri trials and tests and all saying the wrong thing but finally God's wearing you down amen so you stop relying on yourself I stopped relying on myself and we cried to God said God have mercy on me come again come back into my life praise God I invite you back into my life praise God and notice with tears he was brought to tears Lord I believe help my unbelief when Jesus saw the people he rebuked that foul Spirit saying thou th dumb and deaf spirit I charge you come out of him and enter no more see that's what I like that's I remember a brother Austin stood up when I preach that last time you know remember that brother we got the power we got the authority to say Satan you're leaving and you will not come back now he'll come back to Temp but he won't come back to to torment you glory right you'll enter no more he'll come back and knock and try to bring you that box of rattles Stakes but you can turn down you can slam the door and say Jesus is the door amen I'm putting Jesus between me and that box of rattlesnakes amen hallelujah Christ is the door amen oh I love that Hallelujah see that's what we got to do too we got to rebuke evil spirits when they come amen got to rebuke it in Jesus Christ's name whatever your testimony is going to be not every testimony is like this the spirit cried R him sore he came out and I've seen that I've seen that uh Pennsylvania also in Guyana Jesus took him by the hand lifted him up and he arose and the disciples said why can we not cast him out he said this kind can only come forth but by prayer and fasting okay so in this case the Dynamics will only come if the mechanics are right now that's that this is spiritual algebra right here church because we don't see casting out demons a lot of times so this is algebra this is not ABCs right we don't know how long Jesus J was fasting we don't know was it two days was it three meals what what was it we don't know but he was praying he was in the channel for healing and he wasn't eating and so to see the Dynamics cast The Devil out he's got to have the mechanics right first now think about that all the disciples they they were seeing all these Miracles they were sent two by two to all these cities and they were seeing all these Miracles but this case they couldn't crack because it required more mechanic mechanics more mechanics they to be more consecrated more focused think about that church and church you know what I'm talking about sometimes God will do great things and you're not even you're not really espcially dedicated to God you know what I mean he'll answer your prayers and thank God that's what the disciples were doing two by two wow we're seeing demons cast out but this one was different this required a greater level of mechanics God help us amen God help us for what he's called us to do God help us to be prepared with our mechanics so the Dynamics can come Hallelujah I just believe God will work out everything for his glory but we got to be yielded vessels as well we got to be led by the Holy Spirit now here here's one where people misunderstand this one brother raham said uh he's talking about how Moses how did Moses call flies and do all the the 10 plagues brother Bram said he didn't know the M mechanics of it he just know the Dynamics so preachers will some preachers not all some preacher will use this and say see we don't need the mechanics we don't need the word but that's not what brother br's talking about brother br's talking about the Dynamics he doesn't understand the mechanics of that Dynamics right brother doesn't know uh how do you explain all those flies and and frogs being created we don't know the mechanics of that of that Supernatural I don't know the mechanics of how the the wind blew the walls of water up that's what he's talking about see he's not he's not he's not saying well Moses didn't need to to write the law that that was the mechanics is everybody understanding I hope I'm I just hope the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you he's talking about a different kind of mechanics amen think about it before they could get out of out of Egypt they had to have the mechanics of the word they had to slay the lamb the Passover Lamb and they came out of there by the blood of the lamb praise God just like we come out of the World by the blood of the lamb praise God so see they had the mechanics of the word but brother saying Moses doesn't know the mechanics of Miracles I don't know how God I don't here's here's a good point I don't know how God did the mechanics of taking the cancer out of my mom I don't know the mechanics of that right but I know the dynamic we know the Dynamics of it because we saw it praise God that's what brother saying we don't know mechanically how God does these Supernatural things but we know he does them so don't so some people use this the wrong way we got use it the right way that's why I want to preach it now again he says this is one misunderstood you don't know you don't have to know the mechanics just know the Dynamics the thing that Paul States it in other words let me say like this you know we all have loved ones we're praying for how many have loved ones they're praying for I don't care the mechanics on how God draws them whether it's a car accident whether it's just you know they're in a service and they weep their way they finally get a revelation they confess their sins I don't care the mechanics of how it happens we just want to see the Dynamics of it Hallelujah praise God what what was the mechanics that led you to Christ for me it was Cam's driving in Cam's car going to see Kristen and I left the Christian music in there I didn't turn it off that started that was the mechanics of it and then I went to the athletes and action conference the pastor of the chapel uh took me out to eat every Tuesday and he talked to me about the Bible that was the mechanics but then the Dynamics was see you know being there finally raising my hands and tears running down my face and me going home and getting rid of all my trash out of my house well most of my trash out here's the fourth illustration brother Ram says denominations are mechanics and that's true right brother br's talking about denominations he said look our educational system our denominational system has took the place of the Holy Spirit leading in the church now think of a Roman Catholic church or something they got these fine trained ministers and it's taken the place of all night prayer meetings old time way we used to get to God he says now they know the mechanics but they ain't the Dynamics we know the D we want the Dynamics I don't care about the mechanics I want to know the Dynamics so we have to understand this brother R saying we don't he's not saying we don't need the mechanics of the Bible he's saying we don't need mechanics of man-made denominations okay I hope you're going to get I need to go faster here because you're probably not going to remember all this but you're GNA remember the punchline hopefully he said I don't he said a fourth illustration denominations are mechanics same one okay the fifth one now here's a good one I like he's the Dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it Apostles prophets teachers and so forth and he's the Dynamics that works that amen hallelujah how many you ever been blessed by a preacher sermon that was the preacher did the mechanics the Dynamics was God's word to you amen hallelujah the can say we need pastors prophets teachers evangelist we also need the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and the church said amen and sisters can have all nine gifts and the church said and brothers can have all nine gifts and the church said am those are all mechanics but then when God gets in that then that's Dynamics praise God amen amen hopefully see some Dynamics today amen amen some Dynamics next week when brother Diggs comes amen as simple as lives changed people baptized Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost or healed or prophecy or Vision or dream or sign or Wonder or Miracle we just want to see God's Dynamics have their free course Hallelujah like I said on Wednesday like brother man said we just want to be able to tell people Jesus Christ is the same amen the the Dynamics are the same today that's what we want to be able to say we want to go to work I want to go to work and say God did a miracle yesterday I did when Austin got heal that migraine and different testimonies we've had I've gone to to work and said that he's the same yesterday today and forever praise God now I could read all these but you understand my brother R said Moses was at the burning bush he had all the mechanics but one day he heard a man speak out of a a a burning Pillar of Fire and said I am that I am see he had the mechanics but he got the Dynamics and now the mechanics was all the promises his mom had told him you were born under a sign there was a pillar of fire and an angel of the Lord brought you and then the angel protected you in that Ark brother said a n River full of crocodiles God protected you Amen in other words you shouldn't be here Moses but God protected you can I say it to you many of you shouldn't be here but God protected your life praise God amen amen the devil might have tried to snatch your life away but it was impossible God had a desire God had a plan Samson God had a purpose and you'll fulfill that purpose praise God Amen so he had he had mechanics all those promises all the Visions all the dreams all the prophecies but he also had done Dynamics the burning bush amen I'll tell you the the burning bush also gave him mechanics it gave him two signs you got the sign here leprosy well death life amen life and death resurrection and death and then he had also uh the second sign uh the staff praise God is that right the staff for some reason I'm a little blank on the Moses story right now should have read that last last night I was too busy listening to uh just once more Lord okay spirit and Truth now here's what I've always taught you and I believe this is right brother Ram taught it mechanics and Dynamics the right way are spirit and truth right Jesus said every worshipper has to Worship in spirit spirit and in truth so as I've taught having the right Doctrine is the truth but we we want the spirit to go along with that but I'm also an advocate you can't even have the right teaching unless the spirit's there to teach it because it's a gift of God teaching is a gift of God and the Dynamics have to get in that gift in order to teach the word right now here's another illustration the mechanics is the car and he even says the gasoline is the mechanics but he said 'th spark is a Dynamics he said I don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power L there's a power there to confirm that gasoline it just might as well be water Hallelujah so think about that I got my car fixed yesterday that was not a happy situation but you know how it is anyways I could have all that car but if I don't have the spark to fire what good is it it I've got to have the mechanics thank God for the mechanics I sure enjoy the Dynamics I enjoy driving to work and getting to work on time I enjoy enjoy driving down to preach in Junction City and coming back to preach up here I enjoy the Dynamics of it but I got to have the mechanics the mechanics are just as important as the Dynamics praise God and that's why we're a mature church we understand that but some people don't and that's why they get into all these like so-called false prophets oh this one this one's going to be healed and they die or this one's going to be well and they die that's that's why they're off the word right we all want to hope we all want to hope for the best like again I just heard more preachers saying this week and even Joseph brandham oh saying the Rapture is just any day now any day now now that's the same thing they said two years ago when when when are people ever going to wake up and be like these guys are not prophets they're speaking on their own yes we all want to be ready but stop trying to fearmonger us into believing the holy SP spirit will prepare us for the Rapture amen not some false leaders that have so-called gifts that lie and tell like they said yesterday the LIE yesterday was William brandham is the pastor of the whole world show me one quote where that's actually brother actually says that I'll tell you who's the pastor of the whole world it's the chief Shepherd Jesus Christ that's what the Bible says amen every other Pastor is a local pastor and I I sh I shared the quote with our brother see every service I got to lay one in like this so forgive me it's because this blog posts come out on Saturday and that's what I'm studying and so I'm always quick to like Lord give me a scripture give me a quote for this guy my brother Ram said I he said I never was a successful pastor and I never could be look it's an exact quote I never could be a successful Pastor so I asked the brother how can you guys have a successful church if he's your pastor because he said he would never be successful do that make sense to anybody I would never successfully Pastor I couldn't be successful than how can all those people around the world be successful they can't right I said when are you going to preach that one when are you going to share that one in your blog he ain't got to share because he's lying they're lying but see that that's my that's my apologetics of the day there right God gra he said the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move now here's another one this is a good one too oh yeah I like this quote did I skip one here just bear with me no okay what shall I do and I haven't even gone through all 54 there was so many I'm like I have to preach it next week or something Wednesday night maybe because next Sunday brother digs is here he said now the religious system has turned down the end time message isn't that true as God God predicted this message word by word right Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 Revelation 3 revelation 10:7 God foretold Malachi 45 and6 God for told it word by word it's on tape if they shoot me whatever they do it'll never stop the message it'll go on the same it's already out it's the word of the end thoroughly Vindicated and proved over and over by signs wonders Dynamics he said by science by the church by God himself has proved it's the hour both the word and the signs and the Wonders a message approved of God among you by signs and wonders of this hour a message that Jesus Christ is not dead but a living just the same as he ever was and sending forth and it exactly fulfills Malachi 4 and all the other scriptures that Jesus said would be in the last days is totally fulfilled both scientifically by the world so all the scriptures that brother man fulfilled that was the mechanics and then when Jesus Christ came and told them their names and their addresses and that they were well that was a Dynamics praise God Amen Hallelujah now here he switches back and forth in this quote on a mechanics uh of the seminaries but then how the church needs real mechanics so like I said there's already six or seven different ways you can use mechanics and Dynamics he said it's not a seminary that teaches you all the Theology and the Greek interpretations he said it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set that a fire and to bring it to pass and make it live just exactly what was the promised word is for this hour not the mechanics Dynamics but not so look he says not the mechanics he's speaking of denomination it takes mechanics and Dynamics the word and the spirit and the church said there it is John 4:24 right there if anybody says it's not it's right there you must Worship in spirit Dynamics and Truth Bible Glory they're the he said they are the one that gives life these two give life Hallelujah right just like you can't have a car without mechanics and Dynamics you can't have railro without mechanic and Dynamics you can't have the real Holy Ghost Church Without both mechanics and Dynamics I'm trying to get down I'm almost done here if I finish before noon it's a miracle by God's grace no I'm just kidding I shouldn't say that forgive me Lord I should if I finish before noon and we'll all be blessed now here's a good one this is the one we really like now this is one also preachers are confused they'll say the Dynamics aren't here well it depends what you're talking about the Dynamics of the nine gifts are here amen that's why we see signs wonders and miracles amen if the Dynamics wasn't here we wouldn't see anything Supernatural right we wouldn't ever get healed we never have a dream we never have a vision we never see God move supernaturally but the fact is there's different kinds of Dynamics there's Dynamics for the holy ghost in the church with the preaching gifts and the nine gifts but there's a Dynamics that's future to come that's the latter rain amen okay so yeah that's why it's so important to know all these quotes if not if if people only know one quote they won't know the the other side right you got to know all that's why it's good to search all those quotes if you haven't done that for a while do that sometime just type in mechanics and Dynamics read all 54 quotes see what you find out then you'll know what it's like to be a preacher you got to sip through those and say which ones am I going to preach I ask God I don't know help me Jesus see like just like the latter rain I want to show you all the quotes brother R said oh we're receiving lerain Faith right now it's 1954 and the Rapture still hasn't heaven see you know you gota gotta got to have Grace you got to have humility you got to take everything back to the word of God I had a brother called me up from Missouri yesterday he said brother Jesse I've watched almost all your videos he said I was raised in a church in Fiji where they said every word was thus sayith the Lord he said it confused a lot of people he said but when we come to America some of us migrated over here I think it was I can't remember maybe they got Asylum I don't know but he said I knew he said I started watching your videos and I saw I made a video with over 60 human just human mistakes that brother brand on the tapes and the brother said he said I can't tell you he just talked to me on the phone yesterday I was driving no I was at home and he said brother he said that did so much for me because my whole life I was raised to believe everything is thus said the Lord and he said the way I Saw You by the Holy Spirit bring he just said you brought it with such humility you showed how brother Ram would correct himself many times he grow in Revelation and you said yet he's still a prophet you stayed with the message he said that did so much for me he said I was all worried if I preach it who's going to leave and he said I just watched your video I said I've just got to do it I've got to stand with the word of God like brother Jesse yes he said let let the chips fall wherever they may I've said that many times I don't care what people say I believe God's word amen yes he said I preached it as hard as I could and he said I thought people would leave he said only one person left he said God was good to us we still got most of the church I said you that's a good sign you got real Bible believing Christians yes amen right cuz Moses had sins David had sins Joshua Daniel everybody sinned everybody fall short of God's glory but there's one thing that won't fail that's thus sayeth the Lord amen amen so just I'm just drop dropping that in there to show how this you know I put the videos out there and God will direct them wherever they need to go I got even more uh emails this week just people thanking me for what what we're doing by the grace of God I say we because you do you do it you support us you support me now here's another thought he said the Council of churches now that's the image of the Beast right all the churches coming together before the Rapture that's the image of the Beast brother Braham said that image of the Beast needs Dynamics but he says so does the bride of Christ so this is this is Harvest Time church both seeds are coming to maturity I'm glad I can see the wheat being revealed to me I'm not a terar brother amen I'm a wheat brother Jose I I I really like these wheat grains that are growing up in my life here I Hallelujah as time goes on it's more and more revealed because Harvest Time proves what seed you are amen the season will reveal what seed is inside of you thank God we've got the seed of Christ he said there you are that hour that we're arrived at that big machine that set up they got the mechanics the only thing they have is Satan there with the Dynamics to force the marking of the Beast so the mark of the beast is going to be satanic mechanics and Dynamics to lay down the mark of the beast but let me say something this uniting time to see the churches uniting Nations uniting it's uniting time of God and his bride and I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the king kingom of God I believe the mechanics is there thank God we got the Bible they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory in the Rapture praise God so see brother R clearly shows Dynamics for the Rapture is the latter rain I believe with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and we see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that now look at this what will be the latter rain the Dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we've worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body if we've loved the small measure this much how much we can enjoy the full measure how much if we dance and praise God and shout and glorify God under something small what are we going to feel like when we get the real thing praise God oh what are we going to feel like praise God it's a new application and this is the this is the Dynamics we don't have control over remember the disciples needed to get control over their mechanics they had to fast and pray to cast out the deaf Spirit but this one we don't really have control over this this is God's control because Jesus only knows the hour and the day of the ref sure all right now we do have control over prayer and fasting for dynamic power in our daily lives and our Ministries because everybody has a ministry here let's say it out loud let's let's say I have a Ministry ready I have a minist everybody's a minister here a servant with your gifts everybody's here to serve one another now I'm just going to skip down yeah let me close this I think I got a couple more slides here I'm almost done yeah a little bit little over an hour here I'm almost done I didn't read this quote but this meant a lot to me as I went back and listen to the sermon here brother Ram said Jesus anointed every fiber of Samson's being he says always now think about this when the power of God comes in the walls that you build around fall so think of Samson he had all those walls around him that was his own fault church sometimes we have walls we feel surrounded it's our own fault fault sometimes he said but when God's spirit comes in the walls fall The Fortress around you the the insurmountable odds all the tests and trials when God's power comes in the walls start falling Hallelujah and God will be known again he's the same yesterday today and forever his every fiber filled with the Holy Ghost every muscle filled every bit of his body was just filled with the Holy Ghost that was Sam son's greatest Victory praise God what will be your and I greatest Victory when every fiber of our being is yielded to the Holy Spirit praise God when we only say what God wants us to say when we only do what God's leading us to do when we only think and meditate on the right things praise God that will be our greatest Victory can I say like this the victory in the love divine hallelujah oh my and I believe this is where Samson finally gave his heart to God before that he'd only given God his his mind and his body but he saved his heart for the women right the woman from Timnath and then it was his prostitute and then it was theath he gave his love to the women but finally when he when God now look at this God and his love had to separate him from the the addictions of of his of his of his life I'll say it like that from his real loves for his sinful loves God had to separate him very forcefully God very forcibly with eyes plucked out and embarrassed and ashamed and whipped and be beaten enslaved God had to separate him from that and then he finally gets to the spot when he's broken down he finally gets to the spot we're saying Jehovah I know you love me you're a God of Mercy remember that quote Oh Jehovah you're full of love just once more pour out your blessing on me avenge me of my eyes in other words now Lord I'm finally giving you my heart it reminds me that song Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul Hallelujah I live for you alone God had allow Samson to get such an awful place where he could finally live for God alone and in that moment he got the greatest Victory he could ever get let's stand to our feet musicians I'm going to skip past this I'm gonna go right to this last quote I heard brother Randy Sai say this he preached at cams last week and I was listening between services and he used this quote I thought well this is perfect for communion I didn't really think about it it's not noon yet praise God hallelujah so preach hour and 15 instead of hour and 30 Hallelujah you've been a great audience and Sur he love you in the Lord Brother Ram says in 1955 Fellowship he's talking about Peter worried about John after the resurrection he said what is John gonna do what is John gonna do and Jesus says what is that to thee Peter follow thou me I'll take care of the rest of it you just go ahead and follow me he said that's the way it is then get back to Carefree again all right in other words Peter was worried about John and Jesus says don't worry about him just have fellowship with me just follow me right now for me it's like I can't worry about brandom Tabernacle right and as much as I love brother Cam and the Saints and brother Samuel and brother Brooks I can't worry about them I've got to follow God what is brother Brooks's life he's already 63 what what's his life going to be like Randy SC is already 70 what is his how how is the his his life going to end I can't worry about that I've got got to worry about following Christ myself see that in other words we got to get our eyes off other people we got to get our eyes on Christ and brother Ram said this is fellowship and I love what he brings out he brings out Cain now we all know Cain was a demon-possessed son of son of the serpent but he said when man when Even Adam and Eve right but but specifically when Cain when Cain left the presence of God what the Bible say he became what a Wanderer wondering about everywhere the Bible to just wander from place to place couldn't find a steady home he said what a picture that is of today when a man really gets fellowship with God he says You Won't Say I'm Baptist we just saw our Baptist friends last week you won't say I'm Methodist he goes on he just then he says no matter what church you grow to you fellowship with any group whether it's one assemblies Oneness tuness latterday Saints whatever it is just as long as you your fellowship is clean with God the Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and then we have Fellowship one with another isn't that beautiful I hope you appreciated that that that quote meant a lot to me in other words Church there's times in all of our Lives when we feel like we're just wandering around I don't know where my life is headed we we we might wonder that I don't know where my family's headed you might wonder I don't know where our church is headed where's my you know we might think about our careers where's my career headed we might feel like we're wandering well you know what solves that fellowship with God because the type is Cain wandered away from God because he left the presence of God but when we live in the presence of God we have fellowship with God and then the peace of God which passes all understanding it rules our hearts and our minds the Bible says so who do we want to rule our Liv do we want a Wandering a tormenting Spirit or do we want the peace of God to rule Our Lives that's a good song brother you saying peace of God cover me that very appropriate for today I trust that's what you want I trust that's why you love God why you come to church while you sit through this hour and 15 minute sermon it's because you want to have fellowship with Jesus Christ it takes all the wandering out now we talk about wander but let's change the vow to instead of a a wander around to O wandering let's change it from wandering in the walking to wandering in our minds we both we got to battle both of those right my wife and I have seen this one family from this area they wander from church to church to church to church they just can't find any they every Church they go to is not good enough this pastor that Pastor they even come to our church and that's I made a little mistake when they came I apologized we talked on the phone I tried to really push them too hard in the presence of God and I apologize but that's just that's what they do they just wander from one Church to next when are you going to find a place you can just forgive and love because you're never going to find a perfect church as far as a sinless church that never makes any mistakes when you going to find that I don't want to wander in the natural neither do I want to wonderer spiritually but I want to instead I want to have fellowship with Christ there's a possibility of prayer meeting might spark a Revival praise God Amen how many love God today amen that's my symbol let's that's my that's my sign let's bow our heads for word of prayer Hallelujah Church there's a possibility the Church of Jesus Christ can have Revival a prayer meeting Fellowship might spark that Revival as we prepare for communion let's check on your mechanics that's why I to take my car in yesterday we could hear the brakes were squealing the tires were going flat every couple weeks I got to go sometimes our lives got flat tires in our lives we're not going anywhere got to get got to get it fixed got to get the mechanics fixed so the Dynamics can come back I hate to be strand on the side of a road I'll tell you that how much more should we hate to be stranded in our spiritual life but you know what solves all that fellowship with God Cain left the presence of God we should stay in the presence of God I do want to thank all the saints for coming out today I think this might be the first time in a long time we've done communion with the whole entire church is anybody missing today forgive me if I forget anybody that's not here sometimes I forget this is really nice everybody's here all the families gathered God's people are here praise God I love that it's God's family let me say it again each one of you are a miracle by God's grace each one of you are a miracle Hallelujah you know on Wednesday night I turned off the live stream if you weren't here but I prayed for a miracle for every person in this church I paid for it Thursday though I was sore and I was tired my throat really hurt on Thursday but I felt under that anointing I want to pray for every person but am and I were talking about let's believe for a miracle for every person whatever it is let's remember the Dynamics are here praise God let's keep our mechanics right until it's the time for the Dynamics can I say like that let's trust God let's believe God how many have renewed Faith by God's grace my faith has been renewed praise God my faith has been strengthened praise God hallelujah let's bow our heads for a word of prayer first church we always want to confess our sin if there's any sin of course before communion but even with this message you know we wander away from the word we get out of fellowship and that's when we we wonder where our lives are going we wonder what's the purpose of my life but God's got a purpose Hallelujah Samson was actually called a champion God wants you to be a champion as well the Bible said he causes you always to Triumph in Jesus Christ he wants you to be a champion over the enemy's attacks remember you're king and queen unto God right sisters rule as a king as a queen rule over the enemy rebuke him Hallelujah and you can be a champion as well driving out the wicked one draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh unto you father God I thank you for today Lord these are your
