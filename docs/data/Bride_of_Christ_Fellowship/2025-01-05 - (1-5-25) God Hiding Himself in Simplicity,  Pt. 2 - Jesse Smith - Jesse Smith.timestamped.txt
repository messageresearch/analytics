[0:00] then revealing himself in the
[0:06] same Matthew 11:25
[0:35] Matthew 11:25 we'll read 25 and
[0:39] 26 I might even read 27 by God's grace
[0:42] and just as you'll probably know you
[0:43] know the communion service is a longer
[0:45] service so if anyone needs to step out
[0:46] and get water or something like that of
[0:48] course you're free to do that uh by the
[0:51] grace of the
[0:56] Lord Matthew 11:25 26 and 2
[1:01] 7 I'll read 25 and 26 then we can look
[1:04] at 27 27 speaks of course the Revelation
[1:07] the father gives to his children praise
[1:09] God how you glad to be a child of God
[1:10] today I'm so glad he's revealed it to me
[1:13] I wasn't worthy to see these things I
[1:16] wasn't I wasn't anything I was a sinner
[1:19] but God in his grace reveals it to us
[1:21] because we're his children praise God
[1:23] that's the sign we are his children I'll
[1:25] read 25 and 26 at that time Jesus
[1:27] answered and said I thank thee Oh father
[1:29] Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou
[1:31] Hast hid these things from the wise and
[1:34] prudent and Hast revealed them unto
[1:37] babes even so father for it seemed good
[1:41] in thy sight verse 27 on three 1 2 3 all
[1:45] things are delivered unto me of my
[1:48] father and no man knoweth the son but
[1:51] the father neither knoweth any man the
[1:53] father save the son and he to whomsoever
[1:57] the son will reveal him may God add his
[2:00] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[2:01] can be seated by God's
[2:11] grace so we're in the series we're on
[2:13] the uh third four five the seventh
[2:16] sermon out of eight sermons in this song
[2:18] We preach on recognizing your day uh
[2:20] serpent seed perfect Faith the breach
[2:22] the message of Grace the coming of the
[2:23] lord The Rapture mystery now we're
[2:25] looking at God and simplicity and then
[2:27] we'll go to the spoken word is Original
[2:28] Seed by God's grace we review here
[2:31] briefly brother randam was astonished as
[2:32] we were preaching in part one last week
[2:34] at the renovations the brandham
[2:35] Tabernacle and then he uh we saw his
[2:37] dedication to his children's
[2:39] education and then uh he recalled the
[2:42] Tabernacle being built on a land
[2:44] previously uh with Pon lies a pond and
[2:47] that reminded him of Jesus Christ as the
[2:48] lily of the valley and then we see all
[2:50] the benefits uh the natural benefits
[2:52] from the lily of the valley we see all
[2:54] the spiritual benefits in our lives
[2:55] today Hallelujah the blessings of the
[2:57] Lord and then brother R thanked all the
[2:59] the men that led the construction
[3:01] efforts uh in the renovation on Brenham
[3:03] Tabernacle then we took a virtual tour
[3:05] of the Brenham Tabernacle and Jose I
[3:07] made that a video Jose posted it on his
[3:09] YouTube channel and I have a link if you
[3:10] want the video I can send you the link
[3:12] on YouTube and he put music on it I his
[3:14] is his is better than mine so if you
[3:16] want some only believe piano instrument
[3:18] on there uh you could get that from
[3:20] Brother
[3:22] Jose and then we ended with how God uh
[3:25] kept brandom Tabernacle for him being
[3:26] burnt down and the beauty of the church
[3:29] is the character of the people
[3:31] hallelujah so I want to just pick up
[3:33] right there I'm just going to add this
[3:34] thought in here just hit a few
[3:36] scriptures uh the beauty of the church
[3:39] is the character of the people what is
[3:41] character character is moral excellence
[3:45] and
[3:46] firmness so you're firm
[3:49] morally so character is your ability to
[3:52] not
[3:54] compromise character is how true you are
[3:56] to obeying God's word hallelujah
[4:00] so often we think of oh he's a funny
[4:02] character or he's a or she's a uh she's
[4:05] a fun character to be with or something
[4:07] like that or she's a serious character
[4:10] that's a little different definition uh
[4:12] that's just the that's just attributes
[4:14] about a personality but the the
[4:16] definition of character that we want to
[4:17] focus on is the moral Excellence so how
[4:20] excellent are you obeying the word of
[4:23] God that's the character we're looking
[4:24] at Hallelujah and of course God doesn't
[4:27] anticipate or expect perfection and
[4:29] that's why Jesus had to die because
[4:31] nobody could achieve it under the law
[4:33] praise God but still you know God With
[4:36] God gives us this gift of forgiveness
[4:38] then he gives us the gift of the baptism
[4:40] of the Holy Ghost he gives us power
[4:42] power to become a witness praise God and
[4:45] so then with that power God uh gives us
[4:47] responsibility Hallelujah and so we know
[4:50] we're not going to be perfect but we
[4:51] want to glorify God we want to glorify
[4:53] Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the way we
[4:56] show that is through our firmness or our
[4:59] character
[5:00] of our moral decisions
[5:03] Hallelujah uh it's found in Hebrews 3:6
[5:07] but Christ as a son of over his own
[5:09] house was like Moses Moos Moses was the
[5:11] type Christ was the antitype whose house
[5:13] we are so think about that you're the
[5:15] house of Christ If We Hold Fast the
[5:18] confidence how many confident in the
[5:20] gospel and the rejoicing of the Hope
[5:24] firm unto the end so there's the word
[5:27] firm we're we're called to stand firm
[5:30] nobody can shake us nobody can make us
[5:33] compromise that's character right so we
[5:35] have to we are the house of God if we
[5:38] have firm character Until the End okay
[5:41] again that doesn't mean a sinless
[5:43] Perfection we never make a mistake but
[5:45] when we make a mistake we acknowledge
[5:47] our sin like David said I acknowledge my
[5:50] sin before you and then we say Lord
[5:51] create in me a clean heart amen
[5:54] hallelujah and renew a steadfast Spirit
[5:57] Within Me Hallelujah so that that's the
[5:59] question I want to ask each and everyone
[6:00] today How firm are you in your
[6:02] convictions because that's your current
[6:04] state that's your character right now
[6:07] now before you're born again we got the
[6:08] statue of perfect man over there each
[6:09] one of those is anointing to a certain
[6:12] level of character so when when uh when
[6:14] denominational talk about uh you know uh
[6:17] uh they talk about going up a level it
[6:19] it's so General that they don't even
[6:21] know what level they're going to go up
[6:22] or oh in 2025 it's going to be alive you
[6:25] know they make up these Rhymes you know
[6:27] you're going to be alive in 2025 well
[6:29] that means you're dead in
[6:31] 2024 you know so they don't even
[6:33] understand the levels that God wants us
[6:35] to go but Peter gives us the levels we
[6:37] go from glory to Glory Hallelujah God
[6:40] God shows us the levels we're supposed
[6:42] to go up that's the firmness God wants
[6:44] us to have Hallelujah is staying true to
[6:47] those attributes and of course that's
[6:49] what Peter says in second Peter uh
[6:51] chapter
[6:52] 1 so we don't want to compromise as much
[6:55] in 2025 how how many want to be more
[6:58] faithful in 202
[7:00] you want to be more firm you should be
[7:03] because you're drawing closer to God
[7:05] hallelujah you're hearing God's word
[7:07] more often Hallelujah so often you know
[7:09] my wife and I were talking on the way
[7:11] here so often we forget when we have two
[7:13] services on a Sunday and a Wednesday
[7:14] night and and all these gatherings it's
[7:16] a lot of gatherings it's it's it's
[7:18] actually more worship and hearing the
[7:20] word and meditating on God than most
[7:22] churches and it's not it's not a
[7:24] competition but it is a dedication
[7:27] Hallelujah it is showing more dedic a to
[7:30] the things of God it's allowing your
[7:32] character to be formed and and uh
[7:35] conformed to the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[7:38] Hallelujah so our church is beautiful if
[7:41] we have moral
[7:42] Excellence if we're firm in our
[7:45] convictions on the word of God
[7:49] hallelujah now the same word firm the
[7:51] word firm is only used one time in the
[7:53] New Testament I think 10 times the Old
[7:54] Testament but I didn't look up the Old
[7:56] Testament uh but the same Greek word is
[7:58] the word sure like 2 Peter 1:10 the
[8:01] statute of perfect man wherefore the
[8:04] rather Brethren give diligence to make
[8:06] your calling an election sure for if you
[8:09] do these things you shall never fall do
[8:12] what things these things Faith virtue
[8:15] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[8:17] brotherly kindness charity if you do
[8:20] those things you'll never fall away
[8:22] hallelujah amen what a promise amen you
[8:25] mean I'll never bring reproach upon
[8:27] Christ I'll never go back in the world
[8:29] I'll never go back to those bad habits
[8:31] yes you'll never go back if you're firm
[8:34] if you're sure if if you let Jesus
[8:36] develop your Godly character Hallelujah
[8:39] you'll never go back you never have to
[8:40] worry about falling away if you let
[8:43] Jesus build your character one step at a
[8:46] time
[8:47] Hallelujah now what we forget often is
[8:49] that once you know once once we think
[8:51] well I'm born again I've got the cap
[8:53] sewn of Charity we forget that our minds
[8:55] our human spirits still need all of
[8:57] those anointings
[9:00] they still need renewed that's why I
[9:02] leave it up there because I need that
[9:04] every day every day I need Faith every
[9:07] day I need virtue which is uh public
[9:10] strength to to live an example before
[9:12] people publicly I need knowledge I need
[9:15] to understand why I'm doing the things
[9:17] I'm doing I need Temperance uh control
[9:20] over my bodily passions Hallelujah uh I
[9:23] need patience especially with God when I
[9:26] feel like well things aren't going my
[9:27] way Lord I've served you all these years
[9:29] why aren't things changing well you can
[9:31] you got to have patience with God
[9:33] hallelujah God's writing your story
[9:36] Hallelujah God's taking you on a journey
[9:38] God's in control amen hallelujah God
[9:40] works at the pace of perfection
[9:44] Hallelujah need some brother uh some uh
[9:47] sorry after knowledge Temperance
[9:48] patience we need some godliness to be
[9:50] just like God loving the unlovable
[9:52] Hallelujah and then we need brotherly
[9:54] kindness we need to be good to God's
[9:56] family Hallelujah
[10:00] so we're thankful so a church our church
[10:03] will be beautiful if we constantly are
[10:06] faithful to the commands of God that's
[10:09] character Hallelujah and brother bam
[10:12] said character is a victory now I'm
[10:13] going to read uh just a small portion on
[10:15] of chapter four of the church age book
[10:17] brother Adam said Israel could not
[10:19] figure out God's love they thought love
[10:22] meant no suffering I just want to remind
[10:24] you and I of that just because we suffer
[10:27] doesn't mean God doesn't love
[10:30] us that's what Israel thought oh I'm
[10:33] suffering I must have done something bad
[10:34] God must not love me exactly the
[10:37] opposite God knows the only thing that
[10:39] will teach us certain lessons is to
[10:43] suffer
[10:46] Hallelujah Israel thought the that love
[10:49] meant a baby with parental care but God
[10:53] said his love was elected love the proof
[10:55] of his love is election that no matter
[10:58] what happens his love was proven truly
[11:01] by the fact they were chosen unto
[11:03] salvation
[11:05] Hallelujah so God's love is proven by
[11:08] the fact that I'm chosen to receive the
[11:10] word of God I'm chosen to believe the
[11:13] truth I was chosen to hear the truth
[11:15] hallelujah so many people in my family
[11:18] weren't chosen but I was chosen amen
[11:20] that's proof God loves me
[11:22] Hallelujah so many friends so many
[11:24] co-workers were not chosen to believe
[11:26] the truth but you were chosen Hallelujah
[11:29] let's read that 2 Thessalonians chapter
[11:31] 2 I think it's 13 but
[11:33] um I'm I'm not sure I I went over that
[11:37] scripture this week I Was preparing a
[11:39] lesson but didn't get yeah it is 13 but
[11:42] we are bound to give thanks always to
[11:44] God for you Brethren be loved of the
[11:46] Lord because God from the beginning
[11:49] chosen you salvation through
[11:51] sanctification of the spirit and what
[11:54] the belief of the
[11:55] truth the very fact you believe the
[11:58] truth that proves God chose you to be
[12:01] his
[12:02] child God's sheep hear his voice
[12:05] Hallelujah a stranger they will not
[12:08] follow that's the reason you can't go to
[12:11] other churches and I'm not talking in
[12:12] the message I'm talking about outside
[12:14] the message that's the reason you can't
[12:15] go to a Catholic church because you you
[12:17] can't hear you you don't listen to voice
[12:19] of strangers that voice doesn't make
[12:21] sense that doesn't attract you but the
[12:24] voice of the word the voice of Jesus
[12:27] Christ it draws you in Hallelujah
[12:29] it's the only voice that you can receive
[12:31] and say Amen to so be it is the voice of
[12:34] the shepherd the great Shepherd
[12:37] Hallelujah I always remember that video
[12:39] you know uh there was a real Shepherd
[12:40] out somewhere and there was all the
[12:42] Sheep are on the hill I probably told
[12:43] you about it numerous times but it's
[12:44] it's worth retell it again and there's
[12:47] all these uh tourists and the shepherd
[12:49] taught three different tourists the the
[12:52] cry for the Sheep it was something like
[12:54] a Yodo Yodo yodel something like a yod
[12:57] I'm not a Yoder so I'm not going to
[12:58] embarrass myself
[13:00] but uh he let each one do the yodel
[13:02] really loud a man a woman another man
[13:04] and each time the Sheep didn't even look
[13:06] up and the shepherd said now watch this
[13:08] watch how they know the voice of the
[13:11] shepherd and the shepherd doesn't do it
[13:13] very loud he just does the YOLO yod Yoda
[13:15] and the Sheep all perk up they come
[13:18] running to the shepherd because the
[13:20] shepherd gave the command that's how we
[13:22] should feel when we hear the word of God
[13:24] preach Hallelujah with the right
[13:26] Revelation behind it we should come
[13:28] running to the the word not running away
[13:30] not ignoring the word we should come and
[13:32] obey the word
[13:33] hallelujah that's what a real sheep does
[13:36] a real sheep obeys the word of God
[13:38] hallelujah and how how are you chosen
[13:41] because you would believe the truth
[13:43] hallelujah and notice God chose you I
[13:47] love that that that's the other side
[13:48] that's God's perspective on
[13:49] predestination right our perspective is
[13:51] I chose God I chose the message I filed
[13:53] the message I left denominations but
[13:55] God's perspective is I chose you and
[13:58] they both work perfectly Hallelujah
[14:01] that's right brother Ram says God May
[14:03] commit you to suffering as he did job
[14:06] that's his
[14:08] prerogative so you got to understand God
[14:10] has a purpose for your life and it's not
[14:12] for you to tell God what your purpose is
[14:14] it's for you to accept God on what God's
[14:17] purpose is for your
[14:18] life it's God's prerogative he's
[14:22] Sovereign but in all this there's a
[14:25] purpose if he did not have a purpose
[14:27] he'd be the author of frustration not a
[14:29] peace his purpose is that after we have
[14:31] suffered a while we would be made
[14:33] perfect be established strengthened and
[14:36] settled Hebrews 5:8 though he were a son
[14:41] yet learned he obedience by the things
[14:43] which he
[14:45] suffered so many times we have to suffer
[14:47] in order to obey better the next time
[14:51] around in very plain language brother
[14:53] brandom says the very character of Jesus
[14:56] was perfected by suffering and Paul said
[15:00] he's left his church a measure of
[15:02] suffering that they too by their faith
[15:05] in God while suffering for him could
[15:07] come to a place of
[15:09] perfection Hallelujah so Church our
[15:12] heart should be Lord help me to endure
[15:14] whatever suffering you allow in my life
[15:17] so I can have a character like Christ's
[15:20] character so I can obey the truth like
[15:23] Christ obeyed the
[15:24] truth that's the purpose of suffering
[15:27] Hallelujah right a little bit of a a
[15:30] little bit of a trial a little bit of
[15:31] mocking a little bit of made fun of a
[15:33] little a little bit of short money in
[15:35] your pocket that'll make you pray more
[15:37] Hallelujah it'll make you listen to a
[15:39] few more
[15:40] sermons Hallelujah it'll make you read
[15:42] your Bible more Hallelujah unless you're
[15:45] disobedient unless you harden your neck
[15:47] but the Bible said don't Harden your
[15:49] hearts right soften your heart go to God
[15:54] draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh
[15:56] to you Hallelujah that's what God wants
[15:59] us to have soft hearts that we can be
[16:01] drawn to him brother raham said unless
[16:03] you suffer with him you cannot reign
[16:06] with him you have to suffer to
[16:09] reain so see church if we want to be in
[16:12] the Millennium we've got to be able to
[16:14] suffer now and still be a
[16:16] Christian for us it's going to be mostly
[16:18] rejected by family um at one point the
[16:21] laws will change uh we haven't seen it
[16:23] uh maybe on us but we can see it more on
[16:26] conservatives in America we've seen it
[16:27] the last four years to the the greatest
[16:29] degree it's ever been and we don't know
[16:31] what we'll have to suffer but we got to
[16:33] be willing to suffer because Christ will
[16:35] build our character that way he said
[16:38] character is never made without
[16:40] suffering you'll never obey God better
[16:43] until you
[16:45] suffer right which one of you after
[16:47] having a a just a easy week wake up on
[16:50] the next day and say I can't wait to
[16:51] read my Bible it usually doesn't happen
[16:54] that way usually we wake up and we think
[16:55] about all the great things that could
[16:56] happen today but if we if we have a few
[16:59] days then we wake up in the morning we
[17:01] actually we go to bed at night saying
[17:03] God have mercy God hear my prayer God
[17:05] and then we get up and we want to spend
[17:06] time with
[17:07] God
[17:09] hallelujah let's be honest with
[17:11] ourselves Hallelujah let's be honest
[17:13] with God that's the main thing let's be
[17:15] honest with God character is never going
[17:17] to be made you and I are never going to
[17:19] obey God better unless we
[17:22] suffer Hallelujah now sometimes it's our
[17:24] own
[17:25] fault right and sometimes it's just
[17:28] character development
[17:30] Hallelujah if it's our fault let's
[17:32] accept correction so we don't have to go
[17:34] through this again
[17:36] Hallelujah but if it's not our fault
[17:38] we'd say and we're living true then we
[17:40] know it's a testing it's a testing it's
[17:42] a proving of our character to bring
[17:44] forth more obedience more thankfulness
[17:46] Hallelujah more hope more faith then he
[17:50] says character is a victory not a
[17:54] gift Hallelujah all of you probably got
[17:56] Christmas gifts that's not what
[17:58] character is oh look how beautiful what
[18:00] a beautiful rap gift this is that's not
[18:02] how God gives you character God gives
[18:04] you character by suffering trials tests
[18:08] not in a beautiful package oh I can't
[18:10] wait to untie this bow and unwrap this
[18:12] beautiful wrapping paper that's not how
[18:14] God gives character it's through
[18:16] suffering it's through hard
[18:18] times
[18:19] Hallelujah he says a man without
[18:21] character can't rign because power apart
[18:24] from character is satanic but Power with
[18:28] character is fit to rule oh what
[18:31] Treasures are laid up for those who are
[18:33] willing to enter into his kingdom
[18:34] through much
[18:36] tribulation Hallelujah the cloudy skies
[18:39] and storms of life are no signs of God's
[18:43] disapproval they're no sign whether
[18:46] things are going good or bad that's not
[18:47] a sign of God's approval or
[18:50] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[18:52] still water signs of God's love and
[18:54] approval his approval of any of us is in
[18:56] the Beloved his love is a Ive which we
[18:59] he had for us before the foundation of
[19:01] the world does he love us ah yes but how
[19:04] should we know we shall know because he
[19:06] said so
[19:08] Hallelujah and manifested that he did
[19:11] love us for he brought us to himself and
[19:13] gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons
[19:17] and how shall I prove my love to him in
[19:21] 2025 by believing what he said and by
[19:24] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[19:27] trials that he he and his wisdom allows
[19:30] to come to pass then he says the people
[19:33] of God are not Material
[19:35] minded now as providers I have to be in
[19:38] one way I have to be uh I got to go
[19:40] provide I got to go buy uh groceries I
[19:42] got to get uh Insurance paid I got to go
[19:45] shovel the the the the I got to go
[19:46] shovel the sidewalk I got to go buy
[19:48] toilet paper or paper towels I my my
[19:51] mind is materially minded in that sense
[19:53] I have to
[19:54] provide but it's the love of materials
[19:58] that's the sin the Love of Money the
[20:00] love of material things that's the
[20:03] trouble we got to get into sorry that's
[20:04] the trouble we got to get out of
[20:06] Hallelujah and get it out of our minds
[20:09] Hallelujah see and so actually when I'm
[20:12] providing for my family I'm doing the
[20:14] next sense he says they are christm
[20:16] minded when I'm doing all I can do to
[20:19] provide for the church or provide for my
[20:21] family I'm being christm
[20:24] minded they do not seek the treasures
[20:26] that are below they seek those
[20:29] above
[20:31] Hallelujah so the kingdom of God is not
[20:33] Material he said the kingdom of God is
[20:35] within us a rich man is rich in God not
[20:38] in worldly
[20:39] things uh Casa pull up Romans uh 5 verse
[20:44] 1 through five therefore being justified
[20:47] by faith we have peace with God through
[20:49] our Lord Jesus Christ Church there was a
[20:51] time in my life I had to quote this to
[20:53] in order to remember I had peace with
[20:55] God I felt like I was failing God I felt
[20:57] like God was against against me I felt
[20:59] felt felt anybody catch the wrong word
[21:01] there
[21:02] feelings your feelings don't matter
[21:05] facts don't care about your
[21:07] feelings thank you bop
[21:10] hero but there's a time I felt oh God
[21:13] doesn't love me and so I had to go to
[21:15] bed quoting this I have peace with God
[21:18] through our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[21:20] I remember I had a Bible app to memorize
[21:21] this specific verse and the next few
[21:23] verses after this I had to preach that
[21:25] to
[21:26] myself I had to come up and preach I
[21:28] come up my soul preach that to myself
[21:31] till I believe it and now I believe it
[21:33] praise God I have peace with God how do
[21:36] I know because Jesus's blood forgave all
[21:39] my sins
[21:40] Hallelujah I'm a Child of God
[21:42] hallelujah I took him at his word that's
[21:45] what his word
[21:47] says by whom also we have access by
[21:50] faith into this grace church I'm not
[21:53] living in law I'm living in Grace and
[21:56] like Simon's message said that's God's
[21:58] grace if there's more time I need to
[22:00] give God if if I've been unfaithful with
[22:02] my time then Lord I'm giving that time
[22:04] back to you praise God that's but I'm
[22:07] living in Grace I'm not living in law
[22:10] I'm living in Grace
[22:12] Hallelujah by Faith by faith I have a
[22:15] revelation Assurance I'm living in Grace
[22:19] I have peace with
[22:20] God and when God needs to help me to
[22:23] obey better he'll let me suffer in
[22:25] Grace Hallelujah but it's all all in the
[22:28] grace of God I've you you and I have
[22:32] already passed from Death condemnation
[22:34] into life once I believed in Jesus I've
[22:38] already left death and now I'm living in
[22:40] life
[22:41] Hallelujah you and I will never come
[22:44] into
[22:45] condemnation our sins will never be
[22:47] remembered before God God has already
[22:49] forgotten all your sins hallelujah amen
[22:53] he's already forgotten all your sins
[22:54] praise
[22:56] God we rejoice in hope of the glory of
[22:59] God and not only so but we glory in
[23:01] tribulations
[23:04] also we don't always Glory right away
[23:07] but once we get through the tribulation
[23:08] then we can have
[23:13] Glory think of the tribulations you went
[23:15] through in
[23:16] 2024 now that you're through it you can
[23:18] look back and say thank God I give God
[23:20] glory he brought me through that I
[23:22] didn't know how this had never happened
[23:24] to me before I didn't know how I was
[23:25] going to get out of this but God brought
[23:27] me out I'm giving God the
[23:30] Glory we glory in tribulations also
[23:33] knowing that tribulation Works patience
[23:36] so see sometimes we get impatient on the
[23:38] statute of man God's got to give us a
[23:40] trial to build back up our faith our
[23:41] virtue knowledge our Temperance and our
[23:47] patience and patience experience now
[23:50] that word means tested
[23:53] character so first God's going to give
[23:55] you a trial Hallelujah that'll give give
[23:58] you patience you go up trial patience
[24:01] then you get character and once you're
[24:03] mature with character then God gives you
[24:07] hope and that's the steadfast
[24:09] expectation God has something good in
[24:12] store for me hope it's not
[24:16] hopeless it's not character produces
[24:19] depression character produces hope
[24:21] Hallelujah that's why Christians ought
[24:23] to be happy
[24:24] Hallelujah because the trials will bring
[24:27] us to pain patience patience will give
[24:29] us Godly character we're more moral
[24:32] we're excellent in our moral decisions
[24:35] we're more firm in our our convictions
[24:37] we won't compromise as much and then God
[24:40] gives us hope for the
[24:42] future Oh
[24:44] Glory Hallelujah verse five and hope
[24:47] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[24:49] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[24:52] Holy Ghost which is given to us so when
[24:56] you have the hope when you have
[24:57] character then you have hope you're
[24:58] unashamed of the
[25:00] Gospel you know God's called you he's
[25:03] elected you he loves you Hallelujah the
[25:07] trials he allowed are for your good God
[25:10] can't get any
[25:12] gooder he can't get any more good so
[25:15] it's for your good Hallelujah and God
[25:17] can't love you any more tomorrow than he
[25:19] does right now praise God Amen he's he's
[25:23] loving you with an infinite love
[25:24] Hallelujah if we'll just open up our
[25:26] minds uh to remember the promises of God
[25:30] and the character of God hallelujah we
[25:32] remember how much he loves us and then
[25:34] he pours that love right into our
[25:36] hearts it's shed the love ofro the love
[25:39] of God is shed abroad in our
[25:41] hearts I've heard people say this before
[25:43] when they got the Holy Ghost it felt
[25:44] like God was pouring Liquid Love in
[25:46] their soul that's kind of what it is God
[25:49] opens up your soul and he pours his love
[25:51] into your soul close it back up Charity
[25:56] see because before we didn't have all
[25:57] that love but but now we have love now
[26:00] we have now we can trust God and we go
[26:02] through hard times when we can fight
[26:04] past all the Mind battles and the trials
[26:05] in our flesh and really get down to our
[26:07] soul what do we believe what do we feel
[26:09] we love God we find love is the anchor
[26:12] of our souls
[26:13] Hallelujah the love of God is the anchor
[26:16] of our
[26:18] souls okay now I want to show a quick
[26:20] visual that was just my uh few that was
[26:23] just my warmup on uh character that's
[26:26] not in brother Ram's sermon
[26:28] so let's see if this will work out
[26:31] here we're on God hiding him himself in
[26:35] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[26:41] same
[26:44] no did Simon change any of
[26:52] the let me try it again I mean I did all
[26:55] this work on slides
[26:59] technolog is not going to work here
[27:07] today all
[27:10] right well
[27:13] okay
[27:15] this I'll keep trying here just one more
[27:18] second let's try it
[27:19] again says the adapter's in
[27:23] there you go back and you cycle through
[27:26] again go to HDMI HDMI 1 let go to the
[27:33] hdmis may just a simple visual wanted to
[27:37] show a few uh quotes and then a visual
[27:39] of the Seven Seals series
[28:01] okay try one more time I'm going to turn
[28:03] it off and plug it back in let's try one
[28:06] more time so brother Brandon preached
[28:07] nine sermons basically during A8 day
[28:10] stretch from March 27th to March 24th
[28:14] 1963 and just on a side note how many
[28:16] know this is the 60th year 2025 since
[28:19] brother ran passed away so we come up on
[28:21] Christmas of this year Lord willing in
[28:24] December of 2025 that'll be 60 years uh
[28:28] since uh brother brandham had has been
[28:30] off the scene and I think about I just
[28:32] reminded I've been reading through
[28:33] Jeremiah and they went 70 years outside
[28:36] of the promised land and I just it was
[28:38] just interesting to me you know uh it'
[28:40] be interesting how long God allows us to
[28:43] have a a Ministry without God's Prophet
[28:46] being here so it's just interesting to
[28:49] me now that's really
[28:52] strange okay I'm GNA try one more thing
[28:55] let's see if this will work here I'll
[28:57] try my phone
[29:01] this worked yeah this worked last week
[29:03] right because I didn't show the video
[29:05] well praise the Lord hallelujah thank
[29:07] you Jesus I just wanted you to see it
[29:10] you know it's just a simple chart these
[29:11] are the days of the week uh brother R so
[29:14] what I'm preaching right now is God
[29:15] hiding himself in Simplicity that was
[29:16] the morning service on March 17th in the
[29:19] evening he preached the breach I already
[29:20] preached the breach to you that was M
[29:22] mainly about the lamb taking the book
[29:24] and were're redeemed uh by the blood of
[29:26] the Lamb the breach was between the
[29:28] church ages and Seven Seals first seal
[29:30] Monday second seal Tuesday third seal
[29:32] Wednesday uh fourth seal Thursday fifth
[29:35] seal Friday six seal Saturday night and
[29:37] then Sunday morning questions and
[29:38] answers on the seals and then Sunday P
[29:41] PM was the seventh seal okay it's going
[29:44] to be okay all right well praise the
[29:46] Lord I think what happens is it just
[29:48] can't handle all the different devices
[29:49] you know we go from Simon's device my
[29:51] phone iPad MacBook they got the Pro
[29:54] laptop all these things anyways that's
[29:56] just my two cents
[29:58] now uh I'm G just leave that up there
[30:00] for oh she's out so leave it up there
[30:01] anyway uh brother BR said this sermon
[30:03] was evangelism which means just a broad
[30:06] uh sermon just it's just declaring
[30:08] truths in the Bible and that's different
[30:11] than we we call teaching teaching is
[30:13] when you teach all the verses in a
[30:15] certain section and you teach on the
[30:16] word of God you give instruction on what
[30:18] the scripture says uh later brother R
[30:21] we'll get to this maybe next week
[30:22] brother B said the Seven Seals were
[30:25] teaching uh the word teaching means
[30:27] instruction
[30:28] so when brother Brandon was revealing
[30:30] the meaning of the symbols verse by
[30:32] verse he was teaching on them as well so
[30:35] see you can teach with Revelation
[30:37] Hallelujah brother Ram said I have a
[30:39] message on evangelism this morning to
[30:41] build in my message coming up so this he
[30:44] calls this an evangelism message and
[30:45] then he starts getting into teaching the
[30:47] seals starting there and he teaches on
[30:49] seals the rest of the week by God's
[30:53] grace brother Ram said uh tonight I want
[30:55] to take the fifth chapter of Revelation
[30:57] which is blending in from the church
[30:59] ages unto the Seven
[31:01] Seals Hallelujah so now remember uh in
[31:05] Revelation 5 uh the the 24 Elders said
[31:09] he's redeemed Us by his blood and made
[31:11] us Kings and Priests unto God hallelujah
[31:15] so that's what the breach message was
[31:17] about it was about Jesus taking the book
[31:20] right Jesus broke the seals he sent down
[31:22] the book down to earth Hallelujah and
[31:25] then we can understand we're redeemed
[31:27] which means were bought out of the pawn
[31:29] shop Hallelujah recently I've been given
[31:32] like six coins on silver coins anybody
[31:34] been giv silver coins lately so instead
[31:36] of like people buying me presents
[31:38] they've been giving me silver coins I'm
[31:39] about ready to take them to the pawn
[31:40] shop and get some cash
[31:42] for but I know silver might go up and
[31:44] then I'd kick myself so but it's just
[31:47] this idea I could go to the pawn shop
[31:49] and get something out of the pawn shop
[31:52] right and when I get it like let's say
[31:54] there's a nice uh this is there's a nice
[31:57] blender in there if I buy that blender
[31:59] out of there I redeemed the blender out
[32:02] it's now mine and that's what Jesus says
[32:05] about us Jesus Paid the price he shed
[32:07] his blood and now he purchases US Jesus
[32:10] has a hold of you hallelujah amen Jesus
[32:13] brought you out of the pawn shop of sin
[32:15] Hallelujah he bought you he paid for you
[32:18] and so he brings you unto himself
[32:20] Hallelujah and that's what the breach
[32:22] message is it's letting us know Jesus
[32:24] Paid the price he brings us out of the
[32:27] sin of the pawn shop Hallelujah and then
[32:29] he makes us a king and a priest
[32:32] Hallelujah who wants to who wants to
[32:34] live under a king who's got good
[32:36] character who wants to live under a
[32:38] president that's got good character
[32:40] hopefully this next one we'll see by
[32:42] God's grace if they let him get
[32:43] in we'll
[32:45] see but Jesus asked us to be Kings and
[32:48] Priests so we need Godly character we
[32:51] need Christlike character
[32:53] Hallelujah glory to God now brother says
[32:56] now I don't know what what these seals
[32:58] mean I'm just as much at my end of wits
[33:02] to them as perhaps some of you are this
[33:04] morning we have ecclesiastical ideas
[33:07] that's been presented by man but that
[33:09] will never touch it if you'll see it it
[33:11] has to come by inspiration it must be
[33:14] God himself it is the only one that can
[33:17] do it is the Lamb so in this sermon
[33:20] brother man admits when I preach these
[33:22] seals I I'm at my Wit's End I have no
[33:25] idea what they mean God has to give me
[33:28] inspiration Hallelujah and that's what
[33:31] the Bible says the Bible says the
[33:33] scripture is of no private
[33:35] interpretation Hallelujah so nobody can
[33:38] tell you what the Bible means except God
[33:40] gives some man the inspiration for it
[33:43] hallelujah praise God that's right
[33:45] that's out of second Peter chapter 2 not
[33:47] going to read that today but I love what
[33:49] brother Ram admits he says uh he says I
[33:52] don't even know what they
[33:53] mean now I want to back up and show
[33:56] brother R under the first seal he said
[33:58] the white horse rider was who who
[34:00] remembers the white horse rider was the
[34:03] Antichrist right later we know his name
[34:05] we know his name on Thursday night
[34:07] what's his name death it's the same
[34:10] writer I'm yeah it's the same writer
[34:13] it's death it's the Antichrist
[34:16] Spirit brother B tells us these seals
[34:18] were given with thus sayeth the Lord so
[34:21] the symbols the meaning of the symbols
[34:22] and the meaning of the seals is thus
[34:25] sayith the lord it's God's
[34:27] interpretation of the seals sometimes we
[34:29] take that for granted we don't want to
[34:31] take that for granted Hallelujah if you
[34:34] haven't read your seven seal book yet if
[34:36] you haven't read your church age book
[34:37] yet you better get reading them
[34:39] Hallelujah you'll understand the gospel
[34:41] more you'll draw close to God church we
[34:43] got to be drawing closer to God not
[34:45] closer to the world
[34:48] Hallelujah right now we uh we in our
[34:50] Bible reading our our time we uh we
[34:53] finished up all these American history
[34:54] in the Bible now we're going into my
[34:56] teaching videos each night we're
[34:57] watching part of a teaching video and
[34:58] I'm giv instruction on it uh because
[35:01] I've made 400 some videos I want my
[35:03] children to see them by God's grace so
[35:05] I'm teaching my children at night time
[35:06] then we'll probably switch back to the
[35:07] church age book or something like that
[35:09] or the seven seal book because we've
[35:11] already done the church age book once
[35:12] for the whole family but I want you to
[35:14] see brother random said with thus sayith
[35:16] the Lord the white horse rider was the
[35:19] Antichrist Spirit who knows what he said
[35:21] three years before that does anybody
[35:23] know what he said three years before
[35:24] that it was the Holy Spirit
[35:27] which is what complete
[35:29] opposite in 1960 on December 11th
[35:33] brother said the sixth chapter deals
[35:35] with the White Horse which was the Holy
[35:37] Spirit went forth conquering and to
[35:41] conquer So within a matter of three
[35:43] years brother God gives brother Ram the
[35:45] Revelation and brother Ram says in the
[35:47] first seal he said I would have made an
[35:49] awful mistake preaching this seal if it
[35:51] had it been for the Holy Spirit which
[35:53] swept into my room at
[35:55] noon church that's what we we need we
[35:58] need God to sweep into our lives and
[35:59] show us the real interpretation of God's
[36:01] word
[36:02] hallelujah hallelujah so three years
[36:05] before he said oh it's it's the Holy
[36:07] Spirit he's going forth conquering he's
[36:09] shooting a bow all these things but then
[36:12] three years later the spirit of God
[36:14] visits him and said it's the Antichrist
[36:16] Spirit total opposite and that's true
[36:20] with our own understanding our ideas
[36:22] about how our lives are going will be
[36:24] totally opposite of what God's ideas are
[36:26] about them
[36:28] until we get God's ideas Church we're
[36:30] lost until we get God's
[36:32] interpretation Hallelujah God has to
[36:34] interpret our lives for us and show us
[36:36] what is my life all about which
[36:38] direction is my life going it'll be
[36:40] totally opposite of what we think many
[36:43] times but that's isn't that the
[36:45] scripture God said my ways are higher
[36:47] than your ways my thoughts are higher
[36:49] than your thoughts that's why he's
[36:52] God
[36:55] hallelujah so we see that here he says
[36:57] uh I have no idea but then God visits
[37:00] him every day sometimes uh he said
[37:02] sometimes the pillar of fire would hang
[37:03] there for an hour and he show the vision
[37:06] of what he seal was and he he'd write it
[37:08] down and then he said I'll spend the
[37:09] rest of the day going through the
[37:11] scripture making sure this Revelation
[37:14] lined up with the rest of the Bible amen
[37:19] hallelujah now getting back here to God
[37:21] hiding himself in Simplicity brother R
[37:23] says now the reason I'm not announcing
[37:25] prayers meetings for the sick is is
[37:27] because I'm staying with some friends
[37:29] I'm giving every minute of my time to
[37:31] study and
[37:34] prayer he says and you know the vision I
[37:36] had just before leaving and going out
[37:39] west of those seven angels come flying
[37:41] so you'll understand a little
[37:45] later okay so here we are we are in
[37:49] right now we're listening to him preach
[37:50] in March of 1963 but he says all this is
[37:54] based upon a vision I had three months
[37:57] ago
[37:58] February January December
[38:02] right he says and you'll understand a
[38:05] little later and to be honest church
[38:07] I've been a message believer for 24
[38:10] years I'm still trying to understand
[38:11] parts of these
[38:12] Visions right brother Jose I'm but here
[38:16] I can really nail it down today so this
[38:19] Vision we're going to go through today
[38:20] was a
[38:21] prophecy and it was a prophecy foretold
[38:24] three months in advance that brother
[38:26] random was going to have the third pole
[38:28] of his ministry or the third phase of
[38:30] his
[38:31] ministry and brother R even calls it my
[38:34] new commission the first commission he
[38:36] would hold hands with a sick person and
[38:38] the dots on his hand would tell him what
[38:40] disease it
[38:41] was the second commission was he would
[38:44] stand there and see Visions between him
[38:46] and the patient on his right side he
[38:48] would see visions and tell them the
[38:50] thoughts and intents and secrets of
[38:51] their
[38:52] heart but now the
[38:54] third the third part or third phase was
[38:57] for him to just speak the word
[39:00] hallelujah God would give him what to
[39:02] say he'd say it praise God
[39:07] hallelujah and so this is the vision he
[39:09] had now here he is in h December so
[39:13] let's read through this now I know
[39:15] that's small so I apologize I thought it
[39:16] would look bigger than that I could see
[39:18] those angels those shape back Wings
[39:20] traveling faster than sound could travel
[39:22] they come from eternity in a split like
[39:24] a twink of an eye not enough to bat your
[39:26] eye just a twink
[39:28] they were there so it's a vision of
[39:29] seven angels coming to him I didn't have
[39:32] time to count I didn't have no more than
[39:34] just look mighty ones great powerful
[39:35] angels Snow White Wings set and heads up
[39:39] and they were woo woo and when it did I
[39:42] was caught up in this pyramid a
[39:44] constellation now notice this is
[39:46] December 30th
[39:48] 1962 and I thought now this is it I was
[39:51] numbed all over and I said oh my this
[39:53] means there's going to be a blast that
[39:54] would kill me so he sees these seven
[39:56] angels come to him there's a big blast
[39:58] and he thinks oh my someone's going to
[40:00] kill me and I'm at the end of my road
[40:02] now I mustn't tell my people when this
[40:04] Vision leaves I don't want them to know
[40:05] about it but the Heavenly father's let
[40:07] me know now that my time is finished and
[40:09] I won't tell my family so they'll not
[40:12] worry about me because he's fixing to go
[40:14] and these angels has come for me and
[40:15] I'll be killed pretty soon now in some
[40:17] kind of
[40:19] explosion
[40:21] okay he says and then it came to me
[40:23] while I was in the constellation so
[40:24] brother seven angels coming in there's
[40:26] an explosion he he's caught up in the
[40:28] constellation in other words he meets
[40:30] with the
[40:33] angels no that isn't it so the a one of
[40:36] the Angels corrects him if it would it
[40:38] would have killed you it would have
[40:40] killed Joseph and I could hear Joseph
[40:41] calling me because Joseph was there in
[40:43] the vision well then I turned again I
[40:45] thought Lord what does this vision mean
[40:47] and I wondered and then it come to me
[40:49] not a voice just come to me oh that is
[40:52] the angels of the Lord coming to give me
[40:54] my new Commission
[40:57] so the Angels come to him there's an
[40:58] explosion he's caught up and he gets a
[41:01] new commission it's the third pole it's
[41:03] the third and final stage of his
[41:05] ministry
[41:08] Hallelujah and when I thought that I
[41:10] raised up my hands I said oh Lord Jesus
[41:12] what will you have me to do and the
[41:13] vision left me for almost an hour I
[41:15] couldn't field now then after the vision
[41:18] a few paragraphs later brother says I'm
[41:20] standing in an awful place if you but
[41:22] knew it remember I tell you in the name
[41:24] of the Lord I've told you the truth
[41:26] something is fixing to happen so in
[41:28] December thus sayith the Lord
[41:30] something's going to happen and then it
[41:31] happens for him in March Hallelujah the
[41:35] beginning of March by God's grace so he
[41:38] meets the seven angels now here he is in
[41:40] January a month after a month after
[41:43] having the vision here in January of 63
[41:47] I'm here in Phoenix tonight in the name
[41:48] of the Lord I would not try to explain
[41:49] what's happened many you people take the
[41:51] tapes be sure to get that one what time
[41:52] is it sir that was just before I left
[41:54] home a vision sent me here I don't know
[41:58] okay now this picture was taken on
[42:01] February 28th 1963 in
[42:05] Arizona so Arizona we got a nice
[42:07] connection to Arizona because this is
[42:09] where God met brother random now this
[42:11] was taken on February 28th now either
[42:13] brother random was translated there by
[42:15] Vision which could be
[42:16] scriptural or uh he was there on March
[42:19] 6th or 7th a few days about a week after
[42:23] that and the angels remained there and
[42:25] then he saw them in another uh another
[42:27] Vision by God's grace it's either one of
[42:30] those hallelujah it's hard to tell from
[42:32] the quotes but physically brother Ram
[42:34] couldn't have been there on February
[42:35] 28th because he was down in Texas
[42:36] pleading for the life of two people that
[42:38] were on death row and God heard his
[42:41] prayer and the people were leted off a
[42:42] death row so God used brother Ram to
[42:44] spare two teenage
[42:46] lives okay but then brother Ram looks at
[42:49] this months later he says this was those
[42:51] angels now he says these are angel wings
[42:53] somehow and of course we know if we turn
[42:55] it sideways it looks like Christ the
[42:57] white head of Christ there in Revelation
[42:59] chapter 10
[43:00] Hallelujah so that's the prophecy Church
[43:03] the prophecy was in the name of the Lord
[43:06] how many believe that by God's grace now
[43:08] why is this important because if we've
[43:09] had a prophet visit us then his
[43:11] prophecies must come to pass that's what
[43:14] Deuteronomy says that's what Jeremiah
[43:16] says that's how you know a prophet he
[43:18] must have a vision and it must come to
[43:21] pass and it must be spoken in the name
[43:23] of the
[43:24] Lord you know there's so many false
[43:26] prophets out there some of them say said
[43:27] uh you know by 2023 Israel will have a
[43:30] two-state solution and look how Israel
[43:32] is just fighting for their lives
[43:34] prophets Benny Hinn said that another uh
[43:37] man named Chris Reed said that false
[43:39] prophecies those men are not sent by God
[43:41] to
[43:43] prophesy but here's a man who announces
[43:45] it he says I'm going to meet seven
[43:47] angels I'm going to go into my new
[43:49] commission it's in the name of the Lord
[43:51] hallelujah praise God hallelujah and
[43:54] then it happened Hallelujah
[43:57] now the following week I'm going to go
[44:00] back uh I'm going to go back
[44:01] here so he announces this on Sunday
[44:04] morning the following week on the final
[44:07] service in the seventh
[44:09] seal he told the vision of receiving the
[44:12] king's sword so the word was given to
[44:14] him uh to preach the Seven Seals then he
[44:18] met up with the seven angels and the
[44:20] voice of God telling him to go back to
[44:21] Jeffersonville go back East for the
[44:23] revelation of the Seven Seals so as
[44:26] prophesied in December
[44:28] 62 in the name of the Lord and then it
[44:31] was fulfilled in March well February and
[44:33] March of
[44:34] 1963
[44:38] Hallelujah now in this sermon right here
[44:41] look what brother R has to say after
[44:43] three months brother has to say but look
[44:45] just let me say this now he says you
[44:48] don't get it see and you're not supposed
[44:49] to get it so don't try to interpret
[44:51] anything don't try to put your
[44:53] interpretation to it you only get
[44:55] further away just take my advice if God
[44:57] has given me favor in your sight them
[45:00] Revelations I've been here with you a
[45:02] long time see it's always been right now
[45:04] to double prove it it hooks right in
[45:06] with the word of the Lord so you know
[45:07] it's thus sayith the Lord so brother I'm
[45:10] saying the vision I had about the angels
[45:13] and then the revelation of these seals
[45:14] it's thus sayeth the Lord so I think we
[45:16] should understand that praise God the
[45:19] importance of the Seven Seals the
[45:21] importance of this week of sermons it's
[45:24] so important because it's power over the
[45:26] devil praise God as Simon said it's like
[45:29] us like Mary sitting at the feet of
[45:32] Jesus and whatever receive by Revelation
[45:34] it can never be taken from us don't you
[45:37] know Satan's trying to take the faith
[45:38] out of your heart don't you know Satan's
[45:40] trying to take your joy Satan's trying
[45:43] to take your courage Your Love he's
[45:44] trying to take all these things but if
[45:46] it's a real Revelation he can never take
[45:48] it
[45:49] Hallelujah that's why this is so
[45:52] important so see if people get some of
[45:54] these things taken away from either
[45:55] they're not born again or just taken out
[45:57] of their human Spirit but a child of God
[46:00] has received Revelation and the gates of
[46:02] hell are not more powerful the
[46:04] Revelation is more powerful than all the
[46:07] gates of hell all the demon powers that
[46:09] could come against us hallelujah amen
[46:12] and we've been visited by a prophet of
[46:14] God in this day
[46:17] Hallelujah my he said take my advice as
[46:21] your brother don't you try to interpret
[46:22] anything you just live go on and live a
[46:24] good Christian Life with character
[46:28] because you only wind yourself away from
[46:30] the real thing when you do it you only
[46:31] wind your way again away from the thing
[46:35] now look at the statement brother man
[46:37] says now this one's actually in
[46:38] questions and answers in the morning all
[46:40] of you are conscience and knows there's
[46:42] something mysterious happening and it is
[46:45] happening I know what it is I'm just not
[46:47] saying that it's the grace of God that
[46:49] lets me know what it is it's something
[46:51] that's tremendous and it's gone right
[46:53] now and there's not a way in the world
[46:55] for you to see it but so help me god
[46:57] with this Bible in my hand I know what
[46:59] it is it's been told you before what was
[47:01] it the vision of the Seven
[47:03] Angels it's been told you before so just
[47:06] don't try to put any interpretation just
[47:08] believe me as your brother we're living
[47:10] in a great
[47:11] hour and then later that night brother
[47:14] Ram tells us that's what it was the
[47:17] vision of the Seven Angels he's saying
[47:19] has been fulfilled he says remember the
[47:22] vision of the constellation
[47:24] so brother B had a vision of this
[47:28] here you are something was going on I
[47:31] told you all week it's been all around
[47:33] you but I wonder if you noticed it
[47:35] remember the constellation of the vision
[47:37] of the Angels when I left here to go to
[47:39] Arizona everybody says amen you remember
[47:41] what time it is Sir you remember that
[47:43] notice there was only one great burst of
[47:45] thunder and seven angels appeared is
[47:47] that right one burst of thunder seven
[47:49] angels appear and I saw the lamb when he
[47:51] opened the first seal okay read that now
[47:53] notice one Thunder seven messages that's
[47:56] been sealed up up and cannot be revealed
[47:58] until the last day of this age see what
[48:00] it
[48:01] mean Hallelujah so brother ra says his
[48:04] vision was of seven angels coming to to
[48:07] him to meet him so that the the
[48:09] revelation of the Seven Seals could be
[48:11] open to us H Allelujah think about that
[48:14] the seals had not been open for 2,000
[48:16] years but brother R saying this is what
[48:18] it was I had a vision seven angels came
[48:20] to me to give me the revelation of the
[48:23] Seven Seals in other words the Bible
[48:25] scriptures are being fulfilled right
[48:27] before your very eyes hallelujah oh my
[48:30] Hallelujah and remember school was so
[48:32] important he didn't let his wife and
[48:34] children skip school to come and see the
[48:36] Fulfillment of Revelation chapter 6 and
[48:39] Revelation chapter
[48:41] 10 now to me church I don't understand
[48:44] that all I can say is that God was
[48:46] probably hiding himself because that's
[48:48] what God likes to do even in other words
[48:51] brother Ram didn't even fully realize
[48:52] till maybe he got there preaching the
[48:53] Seven Seals how magnificent this was
[48:58] church I hope you're catching it
[48:59] Revelation 10 1:7 has been fulfilled in
[49:02] our
[49:04] day Hallelujah let's read it Revelation
[49:07] 10
[49:14] verse1 remember we went through this a
[49:16] few months ago brother Ram said this is
[49:18] history and I saw another Mighty Angel
[49:19] come down from heaven clothed with a
[49:21] cloud and a rainbow was over his head
[49:23] and his face as it were the Sun and his
[49:24] feet as pillars of Fire we believe this
[49:27] is Jesus in the form of the Holy Spirit
[49:29] and he had in his hand a little book
[49:31] open and he set his right foot upon the
[49:32] sea and his left foot upon the Earth and
[49:34] he cried with a l cried with a loud
[49:37] voice as when a lion Roth and when he
[49:39] had cried seven Thunders utter their
[49:40] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[49:42] uttered their voices I was about to
[49:44] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[49:45] saying unto me seal up those things
[49:47] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[49:48] write them not remember the first sermon
[49:51] after brother preached Seven Seals he
[49:53] said I just he said go listen to what
[49:55] sir what time is it it's called The
[49:57] Seven Thunder
[50:00] sermon so the visitation of the Seven
[50:03] Angels was connected to the seven
[50:04] Thunders because I believe each each
[50:06] Angel gave him thus sayith the Lord the
[50:08] voice of God which was a thunder because
[50:11] a thunder is a voice of God hallelujah
[50:14] amen verse five and the angel which I
[50:16] saw s upon the sea and upon the Earth
[50:18] was lifted up his hand to heaven and
[50:20] swear by him that liveth forever and
[50:21] ever who created heaven and the things
[50:22] that are
[50:24] therein that are and the earth and the
[50:26] things are therein are and the Sea and
[50:28] things which are therein that there
[50:29] should be time no longer or delay no
[50:31] longer but in the days of the voice of
[50:33] the seventh angel when he should begin
[50:35] to sound the mystery of God should be
[50:37] finished as he had declared to his
[50:39] servants the
[50:40] prophets
[50:43] Hallelujah so brother Ram said that's
[50:45] what it's been it's not been a human
[50:47] being a man it's been the seven angels
[50:50] of the Lord think about this church
[50:52] these people are sitting listening to
[50:54] these sermons let me go back there
[50:57] they're they're listening to brother
[50:58] preach the first seal and most of them
[50:59] didn't even know an angel came that
[51:02] morning or that at noon an angel visited
[51:04] one of the Seven Angels came and gave
[51:06] brother bam the true interpretation
[51:08] Hallelujah and brother B's like it's
[51:10] been going all around you but you missed
[51:12] it he said you're not supposed to get it
[51:15] because it only comes to the prophet
[51:17] Hallelujah glory and then the next day a
[51:20] second angel visited brother brandom and
[51:22] the third day a third Angel fourth Angel
[51:25] fifth angel sixth angel a seventh angel
[51:28] seven angels visit brother brandom to
[51:29] give him the seven Thunders to open the
[51:32] book of God to finish the mysteries of
[51:35] God and now we know the revelation of
[51:38] the mysteries of God and brother Chris
[51:41] that's what I wrote that blue book about
[51:42] was the mysteries of God all 12 of those
[51:44] Mysteries remember that one okay good so
[51:48] that that's that's that's what
[51:49] Revelation 10:7 the mystery of God
[51:51] should be finished that's why God sent
[51:52] these angels to brother bam to give us
[51:54] thus sayith the Lord on the godhead
[51:55] Hallelujah amen if you want to refresher
[51:58] on let us make men in our image I just
[51:59] put the video out last night so if you
[52:00] want to go watch that you can watch it
[52:01] after service let us make men in our
[52:05] image God has to use a a plural pronoun
[52:08] because he has multiple
[52:10] manifestations Hallelujah like Jesus or
[52:13] God said let us what does US mean us
[52:16] means the invisible god with the visible
[52:18] Pillar of Fire
[52:20] logos
[52:22] Hallelujah remember the light wasn't God
[52:25] God was in the light
[52:27] I'm getting real deep here now by God's
[52:29] grace God's invisible you'll never see
[52:31] God you never have no one's ever seen
[52:33] the invisible spirit of God because he's
[52:34] invisible but he had to make himself
[52:36] visible Hallelujah and then the Bible
[52:38] said God created All Things by Jesus
[52:40] Christ and Jesus is the word hallelujah
[52:43] so no wonder God would say let us
[52:45] because it's father and son it's
[52:47] invisible and visible
[52:50] Hallelujah I know it's deep and Rich
[52:51] Hallelujah
[52:57] notice he says and then he talks about
[52:59] the men that were Witnesses when he uh
[53:01] was a part of this Vision that must have
[53:02] been in March 6th or March 7th
[53:05] 1963 he said I was picking a cocko bur
[53:07] or a thorn off my sambers off my trouser
[53:10] trouser leg and a blast went off that
[53:12] almost looked like shook the mountain
[53:14] down so there's the Fulfillment brother
[53:15] R's out in this mountain there's some
[53:18] Mountain near here and the blast goes
[53:21] off and there's there men that were
[53:22] Witnesses of the
[53:23] blast Hallelujah
[53:27] I never told my brethen but they noticed
[53:29] a difference in me and he said to meow
[53:30] be ready go east here's the
[53:32] interpretation of that
[53:35] vision and I was in the west and the
[53:37] angels coming east and as they came by I
[53:40] was picked up with them you remember me
[53:41] coming
[53:44] east he says what was it it was because
[53:47] this is what it was exactly what it was
[53:49] and knowing that I couldn't say it till
[53:51] it happened to see if the people would
[53:54] understand it oh Church did the people
[53:57] understand it
[53:59] no but that's normal usually God's
[54:02] people don't catch it at first God
[54:04] normally shows it to a prophet Church
[54:07] John the Baptist preached for six months
[54:10] and the Bible said he'd ra he'd raised
[54:12] up The Valleys bring down the mountains
[54:14] and when he died the disciples are like
[54:16] when is Elijah going to come and Jesus
[54:17] like he's already came and you didn't
[54:18] even know
[54:19] it all these prophecies were fulfilled
[54:22] right in front of them the preaching of
[54:23] the word John the Baptist the spirit of
[54:25] Elijah and it goes by and brother Church
[54:28] it just goes right over their head it
[54:30] just Pro and they were elected it just
[54:32] proves God will let you know something
[54:34] when he wants you to know it praise
[54:36] God but brother man for told this three
[54:39] months in advance and then when it
[54:41] happened he it went he had to go back to
[54:43] the go back to uh Jeffersonville and
[54:46] preach the revelation of those Seven
[54:49] Seals here for seven days in a row by
[54:51] the grace of God scriptures been
[54:54] fulfilled in our day no wonder brother
[54:57] could say this day this scripture is
[54:59] fulfilled
[55:01] Hallelujah glory to
[55:04] God brother R said one day when when I
[55:06] was in Sabin Sabino Canyon that's up in
[55:08] Sabino
[55:10] Canyon God called me early in the
[55:12] morning up there I was with my hands
[55:14] there praying and a sword came into my
[55:16] hands I stood there and looked at it and
[55:19] a voice said this is the sword of the
[55:20] king and later when the angel of the
[55:22] Lord revealed it it was the word in the
[55:23] hand so what is the third poll it's you
[55:25] with the word
[55:28] I just preached it a few weeks ago the
[55:29] full armor of God each one of you carry
[55:31] the word of God but you've got to use it
[55:34] you've got to fight against Satan you
[55:35] got to fight against Satan with God's
[55:37] word and then Satan will give up and
[55:39] leave for a
[55:40] season but you've got to fight how many
[55:42] want to fight the devil praise God you
[55:44] got to fight don't don't don't don't
[55:46] drop your sword as we said don't take
[55:48] off your Shield or your breastplate or
[55:50] your helmet keep the armor of God on
[55:52] Hallelujah
[55:57] he said and then immediately after that
[55:59] the angels of the Lord appeared and told
[56:01] me about the Seven Seals that I was
[56:03] returned back here to Jeffersonville and
[56:05] preach the Seven Seals and there if I've
[56:07] ever said anything that was inspired it
[56:10] was in that there were the angel of the

[56:21] Holy Spirit now oh now the mask is off
[56:24] now the white horse riders not the holy
[56:26] spirit it's the Antichrist Spirit oh
[56:29] it's a brand new Bible now I can
[56:31] understand it it's not the Holy Spirit
[56:33] going out to conquer people it's the
[56:35] Antichrist Spirit going out to conquer
[56:37] people
[56:39] hallelujah it became a brand new Bible
[56:43] there opened up and revealed all the
[56:45] things that the reformers and things had
[56:47] left out it was the complete Revelation
[56:50] I hope this blesses somebody it was the
[56:52] complete revelation of Jesus Christ alog
[56:55] together new to us
[56:57] am see I I don't know I just hope I hope
[57:01] everybody feels the same way I do when I
[57:02] was in denominations I only heard Jesus
[57:04] preached one way but when I came to the
[57:06] message Jesus became altogether
[57:09] new he he Jesus no longer was a
[57:12] compromiser with
[57:14] sin Jesus was holy Jesus was God
[57:17] hallelujah he's God In the Flesh
[57:20] Emmanuel God With Us the Bible became a
[57:24] brand new Bible now I can understand The
[57:26] Book of Revelation amen now I can
[57:28] understand the Book of Daniel now I can
[57:30] live my marriage the right way I know
[57:32] marriage and divorce now I can
[57:34] understand gifts and anointings and just
[57:36] because people have the right anointing
[57:38] you got to look at the seed inside of
[57:39] them what kind of Life do they live are
[57:42] there work are they workers of
[57:43] righteousness or are they workers of
[57:45] iniquity in their daily lives
[57:47] Hallelujah just Revelations that became
[57:50] a brand new Bible to
[57:53] me Hallelujah
[57:58] it was the complete revelation of Jesus
[58:00] Christ altogether new to us but
[58:03] perfectly exactly with the scripture
[58:05] that was the word which has always been
[58:08] I was so inspired and directed
[58:12] Hallelujah now in uh June of 1963 so uh
[58:16] that was February March April May June
[58:19] four months later brother R says and the
[58:21] Blasted exactly the way I said it is
[58:23] that right brother Fred I must have
[58:24] jumped way off the ground just above me
[58:26] was the angels of the Lord that the the
[58:28] that sent message back for me to come
[58:30] here and break the
[58:33] seals
[58:36] Hallelujah so friends this is so
[58:38] important for our day because a
[58:40] prophetic Vision was fulfilled in our
[58:44] day Hallelujah the mysteries of God are
[58:50] finished glory to God and see our our
[58:53] thing we have to make sure we do is make
[58:54] sure we keep eating the fruit of God
[58:57] because that's what they are they're 12
[58:59] Mysteries 12 loaves of bread now church
[59:01] we'll see in our life if we get weak
[59:02] it's because we're not feeding on the
[59:05] word
[59:06] right like you've heard it before well
[59:09] it's happened to probably all of you
[59:10] let's say you husbands right your wife
[59:12] has a good meal ready when you get home
[59:15] but you kind of stop at the store you
[59:17] maybe like me sometimes you'll stop at
[59:18] your pole you didn't know supper was
[59:20] going to be made and so you get home and
[59:23] you're not really hungry for the nice
[59:25] meal that was prepared that seven seal
[59:27] meal by God's
[59:29] grace and church that's what we are if
[59:32] we eat on the wrong thing then the word
[59:34] of God's Not fresh to us so Church the
[59:37] question is what are we feeding on the
[59:40] character of a Christian will feed on
[59:42] the word of God hallelujah amen
[59:46] hallelujah see the reason we're not
[59:47] hungry for the word is because we're not
[59:49] feeding on the
[59:51] word is that right church amen that's
[59:54] right
[59:56] it's it's exactly the scripture if if if
[59:59] if brother sermon made this a complete
[1:00:01] revelation of Jesus Christ and we don't
[1:00:03] want to spend time on the complete
[1:00:05] revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:00:07] something's more important to us than
[1:00:08] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:11] amen and the church
[1:00:13] said
[1:00:15] Hallelujah the church we can't let it
[1:00:17] become common to us remember we're I
[1:00:20] said earlier it's still true we're
[1:00:22] living in Grace but Satan's trying to
[1:00:24] make us live in disgrace
[1:00:27] we got to live in the grace of God
[1:00:32] hallelujah let's go read those seals
[1:00:35] real quick let's go to uh Revelation 61
[1:00:37] I'm coming down to
[1:00:48] closer Revelation
[1:00:51] 61 and church I've done my studies if
[1:00:54] you know if you've been paying attention
[1:00:55] or if you remember
[1:00:56] I've done videos on all the Seven Seals
[1:00:59] uh accusers of brother brandom have said
[1:01:00] brother BR plagiarized he did not
[1:01:03] there's over 38 differences between
[1:01:04] brother brandham and Clarence Larin
[1:01:06] Charles T Russell and euriah Smith
[1:01:08] founders of Jehovah's Witnesses founder
[1:01:10] of sday Adventist and a Baptist preacher
[1:01:12] Clarence Clarence
[1:01:14] Lin these people just I don't know why
[1:01:16] they just lie I don't know why maybe
[1:01:17] it's because it's either on purpose or
[1:01:19] it's uh
[1:01:23] ignorant Hallelujah
[1:01:27] now let me get some pull up
[1:01:31] here Revelation
[1:01:41] 61 looking for a little note
[1:01:49] here oh no it's not going to going find
[1:01:51] it there Revelation 61 so in other words
[1:01:54] church we have thus sayith the Lord on 1
[1:01:56] and two and I saw when the lamb opened
[1:01:58] one of the seals and I heard as it were
[1:01:59] the noise of a thunder one of the four
[1:02:00] beasts saying come and see which Beast
[1:02:02] was that we have thus sayth the Lord we
[1:02:04] know which Beast it was which Beast was
[1:02:06] it the lion thus sayith the
[1:02:10] Lord come and see and I saw Behold a
[1:02:12] white horse brother thought it was the
[1:02:13] Holy Spirit who is it the
[1:02:17] Antichrist and he that sat on him had a
[1:02:20] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[1:02:22] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[1:02:24] brother said the bow is the of lie Satan
[1:02:26] shoots fiery darts how many know the
[1:02:28] book of
[1:02:29] Peter Peter shooting fiery darts if you
[1:02:32] don't put up the shield of a revelation
[1:02:34] you're going to get hit you're going to
[1:02:35] live in pain you're going to live in
[1:02:36] depression or fear or anxiety or stress
[1:02:40] or anger or whatever more lust if you
[1:02:44] don't put up the shield you get hit and
[1:02:46] you're in pain because that's how he
[1:02:48] comes he shoots Brother Chris do you
[1:02:49] have a question every brother
[1:02:56] that's what I'm getting to next very
[1:02:58] good very good brother no you're fine
[1:03:00] that's great it's great brother great
[1:03:02] I'm used to getting questions that's how
[1:03:04] I want to be and a crown was given un
[1:03:06] him brother R said you can't Crown a
[1:03:08] spirit so the E the Antichrist Spirit
[1:03:10] went through preachers at first but then
[1:03:12] he got a crown which means uh the
[1:03:14] Antichrist Spirit went into a pope so in
[1:03:16] the early churches they started getting
[1:03:18] a pope and they put a crown in the pope
[1:03:20] now now he wears a crown or he can wear
[1:03:23] a crown at some sometimes not when he
[1:03:24] travels when he's in certain places in
[1:03:26] the Vatican who wear a
[1:03:27] crown in other words the Antichrist
[1:03:29] became a ruler he started ruling through
[1:03:31] the Roman Catholic church and the pope
[1:03:33] because Revelation 17- 18 is all about
[1:03:36] that mother Harlot the worst of all the
[1:03:38] prostitutes that's the Roman Catholic
[1:03:40] Church she's the greatest enemy to the
[1:03:41] church the true
[1:03:43] church and who's the head of the Roman
[1:03:45] Catholic Church the pope and we and
[1:03:47] we're not guessing we've got thus sayith
[1:03:49] the Lord hallelujah and he went forth
[1:03:52] conquering and to conquer now I preach
[1:03:55] it like this church the white horse
[1:03:56] rider is going to try to ride into your
[1:03:58] life and deceive
[1:03:59] you he's going to try to shoot a bow of
[1:04:02] Lies I think it was Hosea says he shoots
[1:04:04] the bow of lies he's going to tell you a
[1:04:07] lie and if you believe it it'll hurt
[1:04:08] your walk with God but if you put up
[1:04:10] your Shield it'll distinguish every
[1:04:12] fiery Dart of the enemy praise God then
[1:04:15] you can be healthy then you can be
[1:04:17] strong then you can be a good soldier of
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ
[1:04:21] Hallelujah so now you know what Satan's
[1:04:23] doing he's going around and the these
[1:04:25] are all these are all uh successive
[1:04:28] stages of the Antichrist
[1:04:30] spirit because remember James 1 has the
[1:04:32] four steps of
[1:04:34] sin uh sin enticed uh sin I'm sorry lust
[1:04:38] enticed I forget the next one and then
[1:04:40] sin and then death there's four stages
[1:04:42] of death there's four horse riders verse
[1:04:45] three and when he open the second seal I
[1:04:46] heard the second beast say come and see
[1:04:48] who's the second
[1:04:49] beast the ox I'm sorry I'm sorry Beast
[1:04:53] yeah the first Beast was the lion second
[1:04:55] was the ox
[1:04:56] labor so the first seal was like the
[1:04:58] first 300 years or so 400 years of
[1:05:01] church history the next seal was like
[1:05:03] from 400 on uh till almost a thousand ad
[1:05:07] verse four and there went out a horse
[1:05:09] that was red and power was given on him
[1:05:10] red means the blood power was given him
[1:05:13] to take uh that sat there on to take
[1:05:15] peace from the earth and they should
[1:05:16] kill one another and there was given
[1:05:18] unto him a great sword so from 400 so ad
[1:05:22] to a th000 ad the Catholic Church
[1:05:24] started getting per to kill
[1:05:28] dissenters right one man uh uh what's
[1:05:32] the name uh Samuel Schmucker he had a he
[1:05:34] had a list he had a role he put a he
[1:05:36] started recording a record and he said
[1:05:38] over 60 million Christians were killed
[1:05:40] on just those records by the Roman
[1:05:42] Catholic Church no wonder she's drunken
[1:05:44] with the blood of the Saints in
[1:05:45] Revelation
[1:05:48] 17 verse three I'm sorry verse five and
[1:05:51] when he open the four the third seal I
[1:05:53] heard the the third Beast say come and
[1:05:55] see and I be beh held a low a black
[1:05:56] horse now black horse represents the
[1:05:58] Dark Ages so about a th000 ad to about
[1:06:01] 1500 ad maybe 1,600 because Martin
[1:06:04] Luther brought us out of the Dark
[1:06:07] Ages Hallelujah a black horse and when
[1:06:10] he sat on me had a pair of of balances
[1:06:12] in his hand now we're told about that
[1:06:14] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[1:06:15] 4B say a measure of wheat for a penny so
[1:06:18] it's like food for money right making
[1:06:20] sure it's equal what you pay for is what
[1:06:22] you get he says uh three measur of
[1:06:25] barley for a penny and see that thou
[1:06:27] hurt not the oil and the wine brother
[1:06:29] raham said what was the Catholic Church
[1:06:30] doing they were capturing the wealth of
[1:06:32] the world in other words the Catholic
[1:06:33] Church Controlled all the
[1:06:35] economics the Catholic Church Controlled
[1:06:37] the Kings right there right uh the the
[1:06:40] kings in uh Great Britain and England
[1:06:43] all those kings in Italy the Catholic
[1:06:44] Church Controlled all of them the
[1:06:46] Catholic Church Controlled economics so
[1:06:48] he went from deception white uh to Red
[1:06:52] violence and murder and then he went to
[1:06:54] Kingdom building under the uh under the
[1:06:56] the Dark Ages we got thus say the Lord
[1:07:00] hallelujah
[1:07:04] amen and so he determines the prices of
[1:07:07] of everything so he can capture the
[1:07:09] wealth of the world but a voice Cries
[1:07:10] Out Hallelujah a voice in the midst of
[1:07:12] the throne said hurt not the oil and the
[1:07:15] wine Hallelujah Glory that brother BR
[1:07:17] said that's Jesus saying Satan don't
[1:07:20] hurt them they've got the oil they've
[1:07:21] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:23] they've got wine they've got the
[1:07:24] stimulation of Revelation see you can't
[1:07:27] hurt a believer's experience with God
[1:07:29] hallelujah even suffering will produce
[1:07:31] character Hallelujah you can't hurt it
[1:07:33] it looks like yeah we're going through
[1:07:35] pain we're going through suffering and
[1:07:36] Satan looks like he's trying to hurt us
[1:07:38] but Jesus said you can't hurt them all
[1:07:40] things are work together for good to
[1:07:42] them that love the Lord hallelujah even
[1:07:44] after you're suffering you'll come out
[1:07:46] giving God more Glory more praise more
[1:07:48] appreciation more Thanksgiving for what
[1:07:50] God has allowed because it's making you
[1:07:52] more like Jesus Hallelujah and you've
[1:07:54] got a complete revelation of Jesus
[1:07:56] Christ with a brand new
[1:07:58] Bible oh my Hallelujah glory to
[1:08:03] God verse seven now I finally feel like
[1:08:05] preaching Hallelujah no I'm just kidding
[1:08:08] verse seven and when he open the fourth
[1:08:09] seal who's the fourth Beast fourth Beast
[1:08:13] is the flying eagle so this is the age
[1:08:15] we're living in I'm sorry the third
[1:08:16] Beast was uh the man that's the
[1:08:18] intelligence of man uh represented the
[1:08:20] great Reformation through Martin Luther
[1:08:22] so third seal was Reformation coming out
[1:08:24] of the Dark Ages

[1:08:28] day the four seal I Heard a Voice of the
[1:08:31] fourth Beast say come and see the eagle
[1:08:32] saying come and see and I looked and
[1:08:34] behold a Pale
[1:08:35] Horse now pale represents uh leprosy in
[1:08:39] the Old Testament uh they had pale skin
[1:08:41] that represented leprosy so this is
[1:08:43] spiritual leprosy this is a horse
[1:08:45] representing the whole church is dying
[1:08:48] the church is under death because that's
[1:08:50] the name of his writers death the
[1:08:53] Antichrist spirit is now identified it's
[1:08:56] death right it went from deceptive white
[1:08:58] to bloody red to to Black Dark Horse
[1:09:01] Dark Ages and now it's in spiritual
[1:09:04] leprosy it's doomed to die that's right
[1:09:07] brother said thus sayth the Lord the
[1:09:08] denominations are dead thus sayith the
[1:09:11] Lord hallelujah but you and I we can

[1:09:53] Hallelujah and I'm dead and my life of
[1:09:56] sin is hid in God in Christ Jesus
[1:09:58] hallelujah amen that word hid means
[1:10:01] concealed all the mistakes of my past
[1:10:03] all the sins of my past are concealed
[1:10:05] they're hidden in Christ Jesus paid for

[1:10:38] death death goes to conquer right death
[1:10:42] physically kills death Kingdom builds
[1:10:44] and then we get to see death be poured
[1:10:46] out upon the whole
[1:10:48] world death and Hell Followed
[1:10:51] him and power was given unto them over
[1:10:53] the fourth part of the Earth to kill

[1:10:56] right before Armageddon to kill with a
[1:10:58] sword with Hunger with with death and

[1:11:52] the Lord you can trust the Lord with
[1:11:53] your
[1:11:54] life
[1:11:57] Hallelujah the fifth seal and when he
[1:11:59] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[1:12:01] altar The Souls of them when were slain
[1:12:02] for the word of God notice not for the
[1:12:04] testimony of Jesus Christ just for the
[1:12:06] word of God these are
[1:12:08] Jews and for the testimony which they
[1:12:10] held and they cried with a loud voice
[1:12:12] saying how long oh Lord holy and Truth
[1:12:14] Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood
[1:12:17] on them that dwell on the earth brother
[1:12:19] R said part of these Jews are the
[1:12:20] Holocaust Jews it was 6.6 million Jews
[1:12:23] were killed probably more in the
[1:12:25] Holocaust brother see these are all the
[1:12:27] Jews for the last 2,000 years that have
[1:12:29] been persecuted and they're all crying
[1:12:31] out for vengeance Vengeance Lord
[1:12:32] Vengeance Lord and brother said see
[1:12:35] their their desire for vengeance proves
[1:12:37] they weren't born again because when you
[1:12:39] got the Holy Spirit you don't say God
[1:12:40] avenge me you say father forgive
[1:12:44] them you say father let this not be held
[1:12:47] to their charge be merciful to them
[1:12:50] that's what a Christian does but a Jew
[1:12:51] who's not born again will cry out for
[1:12:53] vengeance so God help
[1:12:55] Hallelujah God help us to not seek
[1:12:57] vengeance upon those who do evil to us
[1:12:59] but to pray for
[1:13:01] them that's
[1:13:03] right verse 11 and white robes were
[1:13:05] given unto every one of them see because
[1:13:07] they didn't have the white robes now
[1:13:09] they didn't have it while they were on
[1:13:10] Earth they were not born again on Earth

[1:15:45] vengeance upon evil people I ask for
[1:15:47] Mercy
[1:15:48] Hallelujah that's the revelation of the
[1:15:50] fish seal you'd be surprised how many
[1:15:52] Christians
[1:15:53] believe uh that it's a sin to think Jews
[1:15:57] can be saved even today they think
[1:15:59] there's no hope for Jews all the Jews
[1:16:01] are lost it's so sad but why do they
[1:16:03] think that why do they think all these
[1:16:05] millions of Jews are going to hell
[1:16:06] because they don't have a revelation of
[1:16:08] the fifth seal ah but who's got it we
[1:16:11] got it by the grace of God so we should
[1:16:14] have compassion upon the Jews we should
[1:16:16] pray for the Jews now I know most of
[1:16:17] them aren't saved right just like most
[1:16:19] Americans aren't saved but we can have
[1:16:21] pray for God to have mercy on the elect
[1:16:24] the children of God who want the
[1:16:26] righteousness of Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ well I'm sorry I didn't preach
[1:16:30] Wednesday so I got a lot of preacher
[1:16:31] left in Me by God's grace here so I told
[1:16:34] you it might be a little long today
[1:16:35] Hallelujah and the robes were given unto
[1:16:37] every one of them and it was said in
[1:16:38] them that they should rest yet for a
[1:16:39] little season now brother baram says
[1:16:41] that's the tribulation period they got
[1:16:43] to rest for a little tribulation
[1:16:46] period he says uh until their fellow
[1:16:49] servants also and their Brethren so more
[1:16:51] Jews should be killed as they were
[1:16:53] should be fulfilled
[1:16:55] so the total number of Jewish Martyrs
[1:16:57] has to be filled up and then God will
[1:17:00] give them white white robes and then God
[1:17:02] will have Vengeance on him God will pour
[1:17:03] out the Vengeance and the trumpets and
[1:17:05] the vials and the woes but God has
[1:17:08] everything in its time and
[1:17:10] season verse 12 and behold when he'
[1:17:13] opened the six seal now brother man say
[1:17:15] the six seals of tribulation seal I put
[1:17:16] a video about about that last week the
[1:17:19] whole seven-year tribulation period is
[1:17:20] the Sixth
[1:17:22] Seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[1:17:24] wait no that might be the LA I don't
[1:17:26] know and the sun became black as
[1:17:28] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[1:17:30] blood and the stars of Heaven fell onto
[1:17:32] the Earth what would a star do to the
[1:17:34] Earth if it fell a burning ball of gas
[1:17:38] what would that do to the Earth massive
[1:17:41] destruction even as a fig tree casteth
[1:17:44] her untimely figs when she is shaken of
[1:17:47] A Mighty Wind and the heaven depart as a
[1:17:49] scroll when it is rolled together and
[1:17:50] every mountain and Island were moved out
[1:17:53] of their places think about that stars
[1:17:54] hit the earth and the mountains are
[1:17:57] brought low the islands are covered
[1:17:59] up so there's a there's a change in the
[1:18:03] in the crust of the earth there's a
[1:18:05] change in the level of the oceans God's
[1:18:08] putting wrath upon everyone in other
[1:18:09] words you can't hide in a mountain you
[1:18:11] see Zuckerberg did that he he made like
[1:18:13] a a $30 million uh Fort up there in one
[1:18:17] of the Hawaiian mountains like he's
[1:18:18] going to live in that when destruction
[1:18:20] comes that's sry you can't run from
[1:18:23] Jesus you can't dig yourself away from
[1:18:25] Jesus you can't pay your way out of that
[1:18:26] either see they they know judgment's
[1:18:28] coming right that's why they're building
[1:18:30] these uh getaways or fortresses all
[1:18:33] these things like that but the Bible
[1:18:34] said God is going to bring down all the
[1:18:35] mountains cover over all the islands
[1:18:37] that so that Island's going to be under
[1:18:38] the
[1:18:43] water that's right brother that's
[1:18:45] probably right if he doesn't know Jesus
[1:18:47] he'll probably do that but let's pray
[1:18:49] for him to
[1:18:52] repent verse 15 and the kings of the
[1:18:54] Earth the Great Men and the rich men and
[1:18:55] the chief Captain so rich men there it
[1:18:57] is Zuckerberg Jeff Bezos even Donald
[1:19:00] Trump put all the rich men in there Bill
[1:19:02] Gates all these and the chief captains
[1:19:05] and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man
[1:19:07] and every free man hid themselves in the
[1:19:08] dens and the rocks of the mountains just
[1:19:10] like they're building and said to the
[1:19:13] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[1:19:14] us from the face of him that sth upon
[1:19:16] the throne and from the Wrath of the
[1:19:17] lamb for the great day of his wrath
[1:19:19] that's Armageddon is come who shall be
[1:19:22] able to stand so all these things happen
[1:19:24] before them the battle of
[1:19:25] Armageddon
[1:19:28] Hallelujah that's during yeah this is
[1:19:30] this this is this is all describing
[1:19:32] during it and it leads up to that last
[1:19:33] battle Armageddon because it's the great
[1:19:36] day of Wrath that's the battle of
[1:19:37] Armageddon that's when Jesus destroys
[1:19:39] all the
[1:19:42] nations that's before that's right
[1:19:44] before yeah so God has to destroy the
[1:19:46] armies of the north Russia armies of the
[1:19:49] East China and all the East armies of
[1:19:51] the South probably Egypt they're really
[1:19:53] building their their Nation up right now
[1:19:55] so God has to destroy Jesus has to
[1:19:57] destroy all them that come against the
[1:19:58] lamb and then the Bible said he'll burn
[1:20:00] them with fire and then we will as
[1:20:02] Believers we walk upon the ashes of the
[1:20:04] wicked into a brand new Earth the
[1:20:06] Millennium yes sir yes sir great
[1:20:09] question brother great question okay now
[1:20:11] the seven the the seventh seal
[1:20:12] Revelation 8 verse1 and when he opened
[1:20:14] the seventh seal there was silence in
[1:20:15] heaven about the space of half an hour
[1:20:18] we believe that's the Rapture the only
[1:20:20] reason Heaven would be silent was
[1:20:21] because Jesus left heaven to come down
[1:20:23] and Rapture his bride so the seven seal
[1:20:26] is the physical coming of Jesus Christ
[1:20:28] to meet the bride in the air to Rapture
[1:20:31] the bride off the Earth
[1:20:33] Hallelujah all right so in closing by
[1:20:35] God's
[1:20:40] grace we have been visited by a prophet
[1:20:43] of God God sent a prophet to finish the
[1:20:46] mysteries of God
[1:20:49] hallelujah we saw brother Ram's new
[1:20:51] commission we saw the third pole in
[1:20:54] operation
[1:20:55] we saw brother R speak the word we he
[1:20:57] can hear it on tape he speaks the word
[1:20:59] and God backs up the word hallelujah the
[1:21:02] word of God has been opened and now the
[1:21:04] revelations of the Bible the Bible has
[1:21:06] become a new Bible and now we see Jesus
[1:21:10] Christ all throughout the pages not just
[1:21:13] in the New Testament we see Jesus Christ
[1:21:15] all throughout the Old Testament as well
[1:21:18] Hallelujah he's revealed all these truth
[1:21:20] to us and so what should our attitude
[1:21:22] toward this be Hallelujah our attitude
[1:21:26] should be one of God give me the
[1:21:27] Christlike character that I desire let
[1:21:31] this let let let me see Christ the the
[1:21:34] the full teaching of Jesus Christ in the
[1:21:36] Bible and let me have character let me
[1:21:38] praise God through all my trials Lord uh
[1:21:41] give me character help me to have moral
[1:21:43] Excellence help me Lord God to obey the
[1:21:46] word of God when no one's watching
[1:21:48] Hallelujah that's what I've told Malachi
[1:21:49] I told different ones young people
[1:21:51] that's when you know you got real
[1:21:52] character you obey the word of God even
[1:21:54] when no one's watching it's just you
[1:21:56] alone in God hallelujah amen the real
[1:21:58] character of Jesus Christ because Christ
[1:22:00] is building character in us because
[1:22:02] Christ wants us to rule during the
[1:22:04] Millennium how many want to rule during
[1:22:06] the Millennium let's stand to our feet
[1:22:07] musicians can come by God's
[1:22:10] grace if you want to rule in the
[1:22:12] Millennium you must overcome your trials
[1:22:14] going on right now and then brother Ram
[1:22:16] said do it with joy try to have joy try
[1:22:20] to give a sacrifice of praise Hallelujah
[1:22:22] in the midst of your trials try to give
[1:22:24] give God glory and know that God is
[1:22:26] going to bring you out praise God oh
[1:22:28] it's so true by the grace of the Lord

[1:22:32] there now Church did that sermon help
[1:22:34] anybody today was that helpful by God's
[1:22:35] grace I thought it'd be good for you see
[1:22:37] The Prophecy Before the seals were open
[1:22:41] it was foretold in the name of Jesus
[1:22:43] Christ Hallelujah then seven angels met
[1:22:46] brother brandom to give him the
[1:22:48] Revelation and the Bible became a new
[1:22:50] Bible to him it's become a new Bible to
[1:22:53] us

[1:23:15] before commun like I said it's going to
[1:23:16] be a little longer
[1:23:18] today you know hav and I had the
[1:23:20] privilege of visiting that church out
[1:23:21] there and a wonderful Church uh the
[1:23:24] women have long hair the women wear
[1:23:26] dresses the women are makeup free as far
[1:23:29] as I can tell my wife and the girls they
[1:23:31] can catch when people are wearing just
[1:23:33] the what's it called the concealer
[1:23:37] what's it called when they wear like a
[1:23:38] layer
[1:23:40] Foundation People sisters in the message
[1:23:42] think you can wear it people don't know
[1:23:44] no the sisters see
[1:23:46] that you can see when you got a little
[1:23:48] mascara on why would you want to be like
[1:23:51] Jezebel I don't know why anybody want to
[1:23:52] be like
[1:23:53] Jezebel God have mercy why would people
[1:23:56] want to do
[1:23:57] that they had the right water baptism
[1:24:00] they baptized the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:02] Christ they had faith for miracles all
[1:24:05] these things but church when we walked
[1:24:07] in there people are talking really loud
[1:24:11] and I think it ties him perfectly our
[1:24:12] next lesson in here brother R gives is
[1:24:14] church order I talked about on it last
[1:24:17] Sunday here's a people that have so many

[1:24:24] go going forward into the word of God
[1:24:27] and we watch it Haven we watch children
[1:24:28] just walk all around all around the
[1:24:31] service during the

[1:24:52] my face where I didn't look like I was
[1:24:53] sad in other words Church they're not
[1:24:55] investing in their
[1:24:57] talents they're okay with coming to
[1:24:59] church and not giving your best we need
[1:25:01] to give Jesus our best I don't want
[1:25:04] Jesus to have a half-hearted effort I
[1:25:06] want to give Jesus my
[1:25:08] best and they were praying saying I'm
[1:25:11] not trying to be critical but they're
