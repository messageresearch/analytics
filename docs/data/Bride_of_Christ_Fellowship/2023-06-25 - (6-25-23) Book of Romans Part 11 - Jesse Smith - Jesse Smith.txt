spirit guide us direct us Lord in Jesus Christ's name [Music] I was here today it's chapter five I'd like to continue on this book of Romans series here I think this is part 11 if I'm not mistaken Romans 5 verse 3 you know we ended Wednesday night Wednesday was a really wonderful service boy we've had some really wonderful anointings and just really you know that was one of those Services where maybe it was hard getting started but by the end we knew God was here amen well we already know God's here today praise God I feel the presence of the Lord hear it brother man says when he comes you're always humbled you always feel humble in God's sacred presence so we're we're humbled in the presence of the Lord today so we know the Lord is here so let's look to Romans 5 verse 3 and 4 we'd like to look there that will have you be seated here by God's grace so Wednesday we ended with this thought about hope hope for the future just living a life of Hope this is one visible I'm sorry visualization I can't say visualization there you go visualization let me work on my English today this is one visualization of your walk with God that's what I want to kind of look at that today it also be a help to you in other words you visualize wow I'm this I'm on this path and my whole goal is to get to a life of Hope this is one way to visualize your life with God it might be you know we all go through moments where we struggle being hopeful but as God matures us his end game his end goal his end goal is to get us to live a life of Hope of course that's just in another expression of the Holy Spirit living a life yielded to the Holy Spirit so Romans 5 verses 3 and 4. let's we could probably all read this this is uh a nice little section A short section let's begin on three one two three and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope may God add His blessings to the Ring of his word you may be seated praise God I have some slides we'd like to show here have your Bibles handy I think you know we'll read through some numerous verses here today and if you've got your Bible handy maybe I'll call on you to read or something like that if we feel led here by the grace of the Lord so many thoughts for today you know I kind of got today's thought from listen to brother Cam's sermon from Wednesday it was a wonderful were you there I thought I saw your hair in the picture there I thought that looks like Emma's hair kind of like you have it today that looks like sister Emma but he said something uh and it just kind of triggers something I'm like that's right he was talking about the four grounds parable which is in my you know 2021 book I have a whole section on that um but it just kind of triggered this thought about visualizing your walk with God there are so many ways to visualize your walk with God and I think God did it all like that on purpose so it ministers to many people many different people from many different walks of life but then it also would encourage us in many different ways so I want to look at that today as we you know try to make our way through Romans 5 and um brother cam asked me he's like does the people like when you preach verse by verse I'm like yeah they seem to like it okay so what do you do you like it do you like my preaching I've only been Pastor in 17 years you all like me I just I feel out of the Holy Spirit to do this and I think there's a lot of power there's you know that's why there's five Gifts of in the fivefold ministry there's power in all five gifts in all five uh preaching gifts there's kind of five different approaches brother Ram talks about it as well in fact I found one quote that yesterday where brother random says you know God brings the word through pastors and teachers but he brings discernment through the prophet you know and if it was just neat to see him say a few words like that and I thought well praise God I like I like all the ways God allows us to think about our lives so as far as we're making our way through the book of Romans you know we're in this third or the second section it's kind of like our third part though uh this this section where we're on justification by faith is the solution for our guilt chapters one and two and three hammered all of us right we're all guilty the Bible said all of our mouths are like an open grave before we get saved right the Bible says we've all fallen short of God's glory we're all worthy of hell right but then Paul breaks in this but we can all be justified by faith like Abraham and he was righteous before he got circumcised before any Works in other words before any works or Obedience of your flesh you're already righteous When You Believe and so we're breaking in this thought path remember this was Paul's way how can I bring heathens Gentiles and legalistic Jews how can I unite them in Christ and this is the leadership of the Holy Spirit this ought to unite all of us whether we come from the message background or no message background denominational background or no denomination background this all unites us here because we're all saved by grace through faith like Abraham we all walk in the past that Abraham walked in praise God as we saw I think that's what I'm going to preach Lord willing I got an invitation to preach out in Iowa I kind of feel led to preach on that Abraham thought maybe on dancing too you know we'll see if I kind of maybe I'll appreciate everyone maybe I'll preach out in Pennsylvania we'll see first time you hear a preacher he preaches on Dancing he dances all around the church who is this guy who led him in he won't be coming back or maybe we want him back so we're looking at this section of justified by faith that's the solution for all of our sin and shame and our guilt so I want to continue to focus on this idea on hope I you know it was so strange on Wednesday I never quite know how the holy spirit is going to guide the sermon I know like sometimes I think I know brother Austin like I think I think God wants him it'll go completely contrary to what I thought or sometimes I'll have all these thoughts and I'm like okay and I preach you all and sometimes I'll have no thoughts and I'll get a thought right before I get to church and I'm scrambling okay what verse what verse what coach but it just you know it's it's it's it's me learning how to walk and continue to learn how to walk in my gift trust the Lord and my gift just like you uh learn to trust God in your gifts and your walk with the Lord like our sister Naomi's testimony just learning to trust God in every situation that's what we're all trying to do praise God throughout every trial like austinina getting married trusting God in this wedding preparations right I mean you can apply it Emma you know Lydia graduation now she got to trust God you could buy to every one of our Lives learning to trust God in whatever situation that we walk in but remember the Bible says this is the four-step divine order for the purpose of your suffering so the whole purpose of suffering is so that you can have hope uh towards the end of your life right or hopefully earlier right we don't want to I mean we want to we want to develop we want to in other words we want to be mature well before the end of our life but this is God's purpose for trials trials will produce patience patience will produce experience which means approved character in other words God looks at your character and said they're a faithful believer and then a faithful believer that will produce hope so here's character means approved I'm sorry here's uh experience means so here's an experience it's the word uh document in Greek it means uh tried character so patience produces experience which is tried character and then the Greek word for Hope is expectation of good in the Christian sense you're joyful and you have a confident ex confident expectation of Eternal salvation that's what I was saying on Wednesday I like to meet message people that are so happy that they're going to heaven it's sad to me message people that have been the message a long time and they have no hope of salvation like I shared that testimony where I you meet people that are raising the message or been the message 40 years and they don't even know if they're saved that's a sad thing to be thank God for the hope of the Holy Spirit praise God now remember you got to have if you have all these if you obey all these steps you'll have hope at the end of your Christian Journey you'll be a mature hopeful Christian you'll be joyful when it's time to go home to be with the Lord you'll be confident I know I'm going to see Jesus I've given my whole life to Jesus where else could I go but to the Lord amen that kind of that kind of confidence even where else could I go praise God I'm on my last breaths here I'm on my deathbed where else could I go accepted Jesus I give my whole life to Jesus amen that's hope right you have a you have a hope an expectation I'm going to see Jesus Hallelujah that's what God wants to mature in our lives and of course you know this is what Jeremiah 29 11 almost everybody's favorite verse uh he said I have plans for you not of evil but to give you an expected end or a hopeful end but how do you get to this end you've got to seek God with all your heart that's why you're here today you're seeking God with all your heart praise God so we so we see hope is also connected to seeking God the more you seek God in church I think we know this to be true the more we prayer the more we read our Bible the more we listen to sermons The more hope we have in God the more assured we are of where we're headed to right the more time we spend with God everybody wants hope everybody wants God to take care of their end but who wants to seek God now hallelujah praise God who wants to put the time in now and and sacrifice and seek God now oh my God Hallelujah so we want to seek God all the way to be born again and stay faithful to God and so we looked at you know how the number four symbolizes Deliverance it also symbolizes a double confirmation also symbolizes an Earthly number as we looked at that on Wednesday night but here's the two thoughts I had after after Wednesday Service as I was praying Wednesday in tears I was closing in I was just thinking about God's grace and how I should not be disappointed with anything in my life I mean yes I can be disappointed in my mistakes but I didn't have my mistakes I couldn't learn I couldn't become a better Christian like if you had no mistakes you'd be pat yourself on the back boy I really did it this week bless you brother Jesse bless you who you you had such a good year this year you know if we had no mistakes we'd be we'd be patting ourselves on the back right so we've got to experience our own disappointments we got to fail in order to appreciate God's grace remember Jesus learned obedience through the things he suffered so we've got to make mistakes so we suffer so we can learn I want to preach you all sermon on that learning learning has become a negative word in the message but the Bible uses it quite positively Jesus learned obedience now I I I agree church I agree there's two kinds of learning there's one learning that's education just sit there okay okay I believe it but there's another kind of learning you learn from experience can I just say like this there's a kind of learning that's human and there's a kind of learning that's revelation Glory
