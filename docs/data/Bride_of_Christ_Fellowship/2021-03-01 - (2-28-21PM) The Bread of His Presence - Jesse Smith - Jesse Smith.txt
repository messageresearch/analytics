about that but i wanted to have the lord's supper so they could have it by god's grace jose and i had it this morning and had a good little prayer there appreciate that by god's grace leviticus 24 5-9 it's great to see brian and george this morning you know george told me he said i knew i was led of the lord to come here this morning she said that was just what i wanted to hear you know so it was nice to you know hear god met his needs and helped him and then brian that's right brian did ask that we pray for his he's got a certain situation do you know about it do you tell you about it brother okay so just a little job situation i'll just i don't know if i should share much online but he just said i really need your prayers so we'll read this scripture and we'll really pray for him and ask god to prepare our hearts for the lord's table i'm glad though i get to come and sit at the lord's table every service praise god amen this is a special time but you know really every time is gathering meeting with the lord having communion with jesus so we're so grateful for that what a promise just like this morning or wednesday night or any night you know any time we hear the word of god and worship and sing together we're at the lord's table feasting on his word praise god what a blessing leviticus 24 5-9 uh let me read five through eight and then we'll read nine together okay let me read five through eight on my my own here and i'll shout take fine flour and bake twelve cakes thereof two tenth deals shall be in one cake and thou shalt set them in two rows six on a row upon the pure table before the lords you have two sets of six and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row that it may be on the bread for memorial even an offering made by fire unto the lord every sabbath he shall set it in order before the lord continually being taken from the children of israel by an everlasting covenant all right let's read verse nine together one two three and it shall be aaron's and his sons and they shall eat it in the holy place for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the lord made by fire by a perpetual statue praise god let's have a word of prayer let's pray for brian's job situation i guess it's pretty serious you know he doesn't want to lose his job but there are certain situations that he may he may have to so let's pray for him how many will add your faith to his need there praise god i'm just you know i'm trying to like brother i'm saying i'm trying to feel that what if it was me and i might lose my job how would i pray well i'd be the most sincere you know i got eight kids and i wouldn't want to lose my job so i'm asking the holy spirit like brother remember brother dennis preached that he said pray with compassion right lord jesus help me to have the compassion i need for our brother bride um i was just thinking there anything else well let's just remember karen and brenda brenda said i'm sorry brenda said a text this morning and said she couldn't make service tonight so let's pray for her also karen here let's pray together heavenly father lord here we are we're gathered again in your presence we love to be together because we feel your spirit lord god your spirit comes when we gather because you said gather in my name wherever there's two or three i'll be there in the midst so lord we're grateful that the i am is here lord god the lord jesus christ hallelujah how wonderful you are how great you are how merciful you are you brought us out of egypt all the way into the promised land as we say thank you god what a blessing father lord i thank you and give you praise lord god thinking how you brought me out of egypt lord and lord you paved the way you've led us by a pillar of fire uh this message lord god we know the fire of god accompanies it so we thank you and give you praise and father we come tonight lord by the blood of jesus and we make intercession lord as priests unto god for our precious brother brian lord you know the need for his job situation lord he doesn't want to lose it so i pray god let him retain it lord god we make our requests lord known unto you and we're taking his desire into account father be merciful lord you know what has to happen to people's hearts so lord we just pray have mercy give him favor i pray lord as as he drives these great hours or these hours and as he drives to his home church lord so often father pray you to honor that faith lord god look down upon him and lord give him favor i pray nevertheless lord let thy will be done not our will but father we

help him today lord as we heard this morning let him be strong and very courageous lord god trusting in you and father anoint me god to preach your word lord and i just pray god you prepare our hearts for this communion this bread father and this wine lord as it represents your body and blood and i pray speak to us by the holy spirit bless each and every heart in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god all right so let's take about an hour here we'll try to preach god's word the bread of his presence praise god i just have a few quotes i didn't have time you know i was i i didn't know my son was gonna have a fever there so anyways he's doing a little better uh but in other words i normally have time to put all the quotes on there but i don't know i only have time for a few quotes so forgive me and i'm all nervous so see can you switch over there okay um so uh we'll look into this thought here this is kind of what my whole book is based upon and i did talk to a publisher on tuesday so i'm going to go ahead and go forward and he said it should be ready to be published by uh may the end of may so i was really excited about that it's so long it's 270 000 words so he said it's like it'd be like three inches thick and i was telling brother jose right now i was telling brother brian i said that's how the word of god is brother brahm said when the seals were open he said it the bible became a new bible and he said all the loose ends were tied together in other words everything like you can you can see how white represents god but satan also sees that right uh you can see how oil where do we get the oil and wine in the third seal where does that come what does the oil mean you got to go to zechariah to find that it means the spirit of god amen and so that's what the holy spirit did through the seals you know you ripped off all the seals and now the bible's a new bible and you can tie it all together it all makes sense now praise god and as i found as i started writing i thought oh i'll be done within a few months well it took me 26 months to finish that thing i could still add to it but i just want to encourage it i'll probably be i'll probably put make it two books i'm actually going to probably make it two books because it's just too big just too big to be one so i'll probably break it up into two and just as we read this scripture i kind of got that inspiration because the bible said put it in two stacks amen two rows so i'm going to divide it up you know six mystery six mysteries just like that praise god so we'll see but i'm really excited and uh we'll get going on that by god's grace so let's look at this here now i got this kind of thought from brother graham teaches this and sirs it says the end time he said the seventh angel revelation 10 is the seventh church age messenger and the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished he said now sounding forth this messenger the seventh angel here is sounding forth his message to the laodicean church notice his type of message now it wasn't to the first angel wasn't given to that not the second angel third fourth fifth sixth but in this is the seventh angel that had this type of message what was it notice this type of message finishing all the mysteries of god uh that are written in the book the seventh angel is winding up all the mysteries that's lying loose ended all throughout these organizations and denominations and seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery that's what the bible said finishes the mystery of the written book and then he says now let's note a few of these mysteries here if you want to write them down first i'll take what scofield says matthew 13. if you'd like to type some of them down if you haven't got the scofield bible now if you have scofield you just go to chapter 13 of matthew and you'll see schofield lists 11 of the mysteries but it's only 11 and there's got to be a 12th because we're we're in the we're in the holy place spiritually right we see the seven candlesticks jesus stands in front of the seven candlesticks right in the book of revelation so there's got to be uh there's got to be the 12 mysteries and there's got to be uh the altar of incense so there's got to be 12. he says now and then he quotes matthew 13 11 and he answered and sent them because it's given to you his disciples it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them it is not given the mysteries here is the mystery a mystery in scripture is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed but which is supernatural element still remains despite the revelation the greater mysteries and the great mysteries are number one the mystery of the kingdom of heaven i'm gonna skip some of this here just to hit the names of them second the mystery of israel's blindness the third the mystery of the translation of the living saints that's the rapture the fourth the mystery of the new testament church composed of both jew and gentile i haven't preached that one yet um the fifth mystery of the church is the bride i'm on that one right now the sixth mystery the living christ saying yesterday today and forever uh that's many places like that that's uh christ in you the hope of glory i believe if i'm not mistaken the seventh mystery of god even in christ as the incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied in whom is all divine wisdom the eighth is the mystery of godliness restored to man that's the statue of perfect man the ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity found in second thessalonians the tenth is the seven stars that's the seven messengers of the seven church ages and the eleventh is mystery babylon the prostitute now the twelfth i found was the mystery of god's will because paul says in ephesians one god has made known unto us the mystery of his will and what's his will his wills that all would be saved right god would that all men be saved and then his will is that not only be saved but be filled with the holy ghost amen for he said whosoever will let him come and drink of the waters of life amen amen so we know it's god's will god's mystery is is he wants everyone saved and he's offering the baptism of the holy ghost to everyone but only the redeemed will come to it now like what he says here and i mentioned this in the book that's some of the mysteries that the angels supposed to wind up see all the mystery all the mysteries of god and the other man that's may i say i like this may i say this with reverence not referring to myself but referring to the angel of god the holy spirit amen the serpency that's been hidden all through the years now the bible never calls it a mystery but i believe it's part of the mystery of iniquity because that's how sin and iniquity came into the world through the serpent seed the grace straightened out not grace but real true grace and i believe that's part of the fifth mystery because you can have grace you can receive grace but then you can do despite unto the spirit of grace in other words you can have salvation you can have your name on the book but then you can forfeit it right but true grace is obeying the commands and then he says no such thing as eternal burning hell you'll burn for millions of years but anything that was eternal never had a beginning or an end and hell was created all these mysteries then he says the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost now this is a repeat because he mentioned it earlier without sensation but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did now did jesus do miracles yes right so if you're born again you're going to have christ in you to do miracles amen or do one of the nine gifts of the holy spirit amen might just be the word of wisdom might just be a knowledge might just be prophecy it might be miracles it might be one of those but it's going to be christ in you doing his life amen living his life the mystery of water baptism now that's a part of the first mystery that god had where the extreme trinitarianism has brought in the titles father son and holy ghost and the mystery of the godhead being filled fulfilled in the baptism in the name of jesus christ according to the book of revelations that the church in this time was to receive there are some of the mysteries now like this one the pillar of fire returning back amen that thing's supposed to take place and we see it oh how we could go on naming the mysteries now the pillar of fire fits in revelation 10 right because all the mysteries of god must be finished right and so when the mystery of god is finished we know the bible's got to be revealed and it's got to be done through a prophet praise god and so the pillar of fire would have to return in order to give a prophet the revelation of the old testament and the new amen i think that might be all i got as far as pictures i got the same picture there and oh yeah i just laid it out like this i preached this about four years ago so i don't think i've shown it since then have i okay so i'll leave that up there just for a moment okay now if you've got your bibles here let's head back to leviticus here now why did god choose twelve now this was a fresh revelation just struck me a few uh days ago why did god choose 12 who knows what the number 12 well don't say it out loud if you don't know who knows what the number 12 means in the bible government 12 is government or rulership or the third word that brought it to make it more sense to us is kingdom right because what do you have tribes of israel so israel was governed by 12 tribes right so when joshua wanted to go over or moses want to go over what'd he do he sent a spy from every tribe right when moses sent him over but then joshua learned that's too many and you can't send people that aren't believers over there right don't send believers or don't send make believers over to the things of god because they're going to deny it anyway right he learned and said oh you only send two only seven real believers over there to look into the promises of god amen anyways 12 tribes of israel jesus said if he asked he could get 12 legions of angels right jesus said the 12 tribes will be judged by the 12 apostles right so see we even see 12 for the new testament rulership right so we're not just done with 12 just because we're in the new testament no god's going to keep the 12 going that's now that's why now there's 24 seats now amen before the throne of god amen amen because there's 12 in the old 12 in the new why because there are two kingdoms amen there's the kingdom of the natural with israel but then there's the spiritual kingdom by the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen hallelujah so you have those they have those two kingdoms but we know jesus says that these 12 are going to rule over the other 12. oh that's awesome and then you have 12 pieces of shoe bread in the holy place now it's through the shoe bread that we understand these 12 mystery doctrines because brother madam saw he quoted them from schofield and of course as you know each one has a scripture so these are not just things you know brother graham chose well i think i'll make the rapture mystery or the godhead no the bible actually calls them mysteries how many know that the bible actually calls the rapture a mystery paul said that first corinthians 15 right the godhead is called a mystery in colossians 2 verse 2. these are all called literal mysteries and then revelation 10 says somebody's got to come and finish the mystery of god amen then somebody's got to receive that and then prophesy that again to every nation kingdom people and tongue that's you and i praise god amen i'm glad to be a part of it praise god that's why i thought when i saw that video like uh you know the world's going to end after the election of november i thought well how can that be because i'm writing this book and i i think this book is going to be a part of that finishing the mystery of god no i'm not i don't have thou say the lord on that but that was my thought brother johnny i thought well how can it be so that time you know brother amen i thought well i feel like i got a part in this in other in other words we've heard some churches ha or some countries haven't even heard the message of the hour some of them it hasn't even gotten in there there's no message churches like even in thailand a couple of people have heard about them and said there's still no message churches there so think about the millions of people there that haven't heard it but god said it's going to be preached to every nation amen and so what i mean is that we need to keep spreading it praise god and may god have grace to open up these countries praise god to get the missionaries back in there so i believe we have a part in this i believe we have a part to take this word these revelations and then preach them again to prophesy them again to every nation kindred people and tongue now if you click on the word shoe bread in the in the hebrew it means face or presence that's awesome he said the bread of so uh the smith's bible's dictionary says it has the title the bread of his space now the word face always means presence so when god talks about his presence coming down it's as if his if sorry it's as if his face is here and we're looking into the face of god amen forgive me here i'm stuttering here i'm a little nervous i want to kind of go too fast so this indicates it was through the bread god's face could be seen amen it was only through the bread right now as you know it of course that meant that it meant it was the next step towards god's face right because how many remember the waters of separation you couldn't even come into the the courts you couldn't even come into the outer court until you were sprinkled with the waters of separation the waters of the red heifer right the ashes with water you couldn't even come in and worship unless your first sprinkle then the bible said we're sprinkled with the blood of jesus christ unto obedience in the faith amen praise god amen in other words when you first repent of your sins you're sprinkled with an anointing amen and then you can come in and then you can see my here's the altar the brazen altar and you see the lamb die now you really experience the cross amen now you really know oh my and then they got the labor the water baptism amen hallelujah praise god amen now most churches just live out there right brothers right sisters most churches just live out there how many do you know that actually come into this next area the holy place not many whatever church listens to or whatever church reads clarence larkin they might because larkin believed this too he taught he taught the uh seven churches and everything like that now he didn't name the messengers that's where brother branham gave him god gave brother branham a further revelation of that well brother abraham took most of the dates from larkin on the church ages and he took he took some of the types and not all of them but some of the types from there so and then god revealed to larkin clara i need to study his life a little more actually uh could god reveal to him that there's oh the bible names all these mysteries he found 11 but there's actually 12. amen oh my and so see you're trying to get to the face of god amen brother adam says it like this maybe i can find that quote here uh brother brahm says it like this he says you're not worshiping he said you might have got sprinkled out there but you're not a worshiper yet amen you might have got sprinkled there outside the the gate with the waters of separation he said but you're truly not worshiping yet having fellowship yet until you get into the holy see of holies amen we're saying about you think about this morning brother how how fitting praise god how fitting amen glory so see you're starting on your road to worship right and how many believe that song how many want to go past the outer court amen and you want to worship in his presence amen you want to worship in his face well well the bible said this is the bread of his face so as you approach god yes you got to be sprinkled you got to be forgiven from all the dead things you've touched or or any of the uncleanness then you gotta have a sacrifice you gotta remember the cross and then you gotta be have the water baptism and then you gotta come in you gotta recognize the light of the church age you gotta see which light you're living in amen praise god and then you you feast on the bread of his presence right but you're still not done right how many know you're still not done there's more to the tabernacle than the candlesticks and the shewbread right because the bible says though i have the gift of prophecy like balaam yet understand all mysteries now here's where we finally get to the message that's why this scripture is so prophetic this scripture is such a prophecy the bible said the mysteries couldn't be finished to the end time right and so here it says you understand all mysteries they couldn't understand all mysteries till right now praise god this is such a prophetic scripture it was specifically for our day amen so you can have the gift of prophecy and church even we we can understand all mysteries and have all knowledge and though i have all faith so i can remove mountains and if i have not charity i'm nothing so see god is calling us he's calling us into his presence and eating the bread is part of that but even after that there's still one more there's still the altar of incense there's still a prayer life where we must be devoted in prayer we must be have the service of prayer we must approach god and we must give him the right sacrifice we must pray the right way amen like he taught us to pray our father amen who art in heaven hallowed be thy name praise god so that's a very uh quick summary there of what i'm trying to get to here so it's through the bread we can see god's face now israel's high priest could only enter that holiest once a year we know and that represented seeing god's face right but every sabbath so every saturday god was having constant communion with in israel through the continual shoe bread now let's read that that's second chronicles 2 4 and i'm done with visuals so acacia if you want could you switch over there because we could see it that's all i had time for i just had a few minutes before service to put a few up there so let's pull that up second chronicles 2 4. second chronicles 2 4. so i want to give you the uh the scripture on this and i believe it it really helps our attitude with the mysteries of god you know you've heard different preachers say oh there we're too much on the mysteries we need the holy ghost well i uh i think they're all together i don't see how you can get rid of them because the holy ghost is a mystery being born the bible said the mystery of christ in you the hope of glory you can't even get the you can't even go in the rapture unless you understand the mystery right and you receive the the substance of the mystery of christ in you the hope of glory amen hallelujah so second cro i'm sorry second chronicles honey i'm sorry not corinthians my fault second chronicles 2 4 chronicles 2 4. so every sabbath the priests would gather in there and they knew they were going to have a feast they knew they were going to be eating the bread in god's presence here we go behold i build and house to the name of the lord my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the continual shoe bread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and the solemn feasts of the lord our god this is the ordinance forever now just leave that up there here now look at this i like how it says it's continual shoe bread we're continually eating the bread of his presence amen we eat on his bread now remember the bible said we read it it's most holy to the lord amen this word that we're preaching this message we received is holy to god amen amen god it says this is a sacred word this is a sacred revelation and you must continually eat the bread of my face here every sabbath you're gonna eat it now i like this too the sweet prayer amen you gotta continually eat the bread and you gotta have sweet prayers go before god amen like we said not discouraged prayers not weak prayers but prayers of faith as we heard this morning strong prayers of faith amen hallelujah it's sweet prayers trusting god knowing he's with you i know that he'll never leave me lord i know you'll never forsake me i know you hear my prayers i know you'll answer in your time in your season i know everything will work together for my good because i love the lord amen see it's continual it was laying before the lord look at on first samuel 21 6. first samuel 21 6. so you have to go through every shoe bread scripture and you see oh it's continual shoe bread it's the bread of his face and here it says it was laying before the lord so in other words god had set the table church just like he did today he used me though to do it right and any preacher who's doing communion today the bible said he sets it before us first samuel 21 6. first samuel 21 6. here we go so the priest gave him hollowed bread for there was no bread there but the shoe bread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away praise god so they would always switch it out every sabbath now the old bread that was there it was still fresh because it was in god's presence but it wasn't hot it was kind of cooled down i like that don't you like that hot bread and that reminds you of this age must not be lukewarm we must be hot praise god and so god has a hot bread for his hot children because they're hot on fire for the lord amen but see this bread was before god in other words god was can i say it like this god was waiting to meet them there praise god god was saying i've got bread for you now i i pulled off some pieces there for jose and i so we could have it but god was waiting he said this is the bread of my presence you experience my presence as you eat this bread praise god now remember what it means for us the word of god now the beautiful thing is we can read about the mysteries and we can hear brother man preach them and that means we're in god's presence praise god right we can live in it constantly live in his presence amen amen oh that's so true hallelujah live in his presence man and that's what i've done these last two years i've written this book by the grace of god i've lived in his presence praise god i've had shouting spells i've had crying spells i've had to raise my hands when god has shown me things you know as i've just lit i just lived in his presence amen so when you find the word of god or you're meditating on the word like we saw with joshua when you meditate on the word you experience his presence amen amen hallelujah and church that's just not for preachers that's for everybody praise god now some people may have more i'll preachers man more time than others of course but everybody should make time to spend in god's presence amen because in his presence is fullness of joy now look it's before the lord it's continual and when it's lay there it's laid down there and it's hot before the lord so you learn church this lesson to have continual communion with god you come into his presence and you feast on his bread amen that's having continual communion with god every sabbath they would just eat and enjoy and say thank you lord for this meal thank you lord for another week ah we do the same thing amen we come to the house of god thank you lord that i'm a christian amen came back here for another meal thank you for feeding my hungry soul amen glory i think god has really helped my voice because i've been preaching hard the last three weeks and and so far hasn't hurt my voice too much praise god he's been merciful to me very merciful so see this this bread is represents eating before his face i'm eating his bread and i'm communing with the lord amen now the bible says this i want to read exodus 25 30. i think i read that earlier exodus 25 30. let me flip to that another thought here you see with this exodus 25 30. i was gonna see i was racing you who could get there first yeah and thou shalt set the tape i'm sorry upon the table shoe bread before me always amen anytime you're hungry god's got bread for you praise god amen anytime you want to be in this presence and you want to feast on a meal with god it's always there for you amen it would never be absent right as soon as they took it off uh you i read some of the historians and they were very careful just the very second the the plate left the other one was on it right away because they knew the scripture that said the bread was always there they they took such careful efforts to make sure god's word was kept and the holy spirit does the same today amen amen we're careful to keep all the word right we're careful uh to confess our sins we're we're careful to uh believe god's word we're careful to say i'm healed when we're sick praise god we're careful to bring the sick up here and pray for them when they're sick because we know god keeps his word oh hallelujah when is it placed there it's always before the lord in the holy place i've had that you ever had that you stayed up a little late to study and you got really good at studying late at night you're supposed to i'm supposed to go to bed early but i get in a good study and oh see because there's always it's hard to want to go to bed when there's fresh fresh bread there right that's what happened when that song came to me it's like fresh bread i went i really wanted to go to sleep i had i had to get up at 4 30 that next tuesday morning but then the song two songs of god came to me that night fresh bread i couldn't i couldn't get away from it i wanted to go to sleep but god wanted to have fellowship with me praise god amen and so that's what the scripture says here he says he always has it ready for us whether it's morning in the early whether it's late at night whether it's noon whenever you have a chance to feast with god god's got fresh bread for you see he always wanted fresh bread because the people would approach him daily in worship there's never a time where they would be lacking something to eat they were always laying there 12 loaves were laying there and the bible said it was a most holy offering when the 12 new lows were set in place now look at this each tribe was represented as having a loaf amen each one was having a loaf and that represented communion with god through the 12 weekly cakes praise god so god sustained his earthly kingdom through his holy bread today he sustains his spiritual kingdom through his spiritual bread amen that's beautiful praise god oh my thank god uh pull up exodus 19 6 so the earthly kingdom of israel was sustained by 12 cakes they were innocent they could eat in his presence through the 12 cakes and so can the spiritual exodus 19 six and he shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel amen it's a kingdom right it's a rulership it's a government and god said you're going to be my kingdom and i'm going to feed you in my presence you'll always have a place at my table amen oh i'm going to feed you fresh bread amen and you're going to be fed as you approach my face praise god beautiful picture isn't it so god is approached and known through eating his fresh sacred word right jesus said he's the word of god and he said i am the bread of life church i think we need often reminders of that when we read our bible we're reading jesus we're eating the bread it's more than a book in other words there's life just laying there there's nourishment just waiting there praise god there's blessings just waiting there because jesus is there amen he said i am the bread amen hallelujah that's what we're symbolizing here i am the bread of life he says and look god's name is sacred or hollow just like he called it hallowed and shoe bread right he said this is a holy shoe bread well his name is holy praise god he is holy amen there are so many types here and remember paul likens true worship unto the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth we saw that on on wednesday night remember that so see there was no leaven it was christ his unleaven his sinless life praise god and paul said the thessalonians when they received his preaching they didn't receive it as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in them that believe how many believe the preaching of the of the word is god's word amen it's god's bread amen you don't take it as all that's just a man's idea you take it as that's my bread that's my sustainment that's my nourishment that's my life god's speaking to me amen that's how we approach the throne of god that's how we should approach every service god is going to speak today god is going to deliver his word not just the word of a pastor or a preacher but the word of god that lives and abides forever praise god yes jesus said and can you pull this up matthew 19 28 acacia matthew 19 28 that's my honey i was talking about this morning right that's my honey that's my only honey right there matthew 19 28 and jesus said to them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory this is the millennium right because right now he's on the father's throne in his on his throne but here jesus is on his own throne as son of david ye also shall sit upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of israel look at that the 12 new testament testament governors governing over the 12 old testament ones so see this entire christian government represents the jew and gentile believers who are privileged to have god's fellowship through the word in the times of the gentiles right now the church ages praise god now and here's the real application israel could only have communion through the 12 cakes that's right because they were the kingdom of priests so this should help prove to us church that we're we're one of the few churches that actually have con communion with christ because we're eating the 12 revelations of the mysteries when was the last time you remember the last time you tried to share a mystery with somebody and they spit it out and i'm talking spiritually right you tried to give them fresh bread oh you should try some of this fresh bread it's shoe bread it's it's straight here's a little book on the rapture from brother branham i tried to give people my my book lately on modesty which has some of his mysteries in there right and they'll say no thanks and can you imagine that's bread this is not moldy bread this is fresh bread amen but satan's deceived them where they you know they want it like rubber band said they want to eat bread with mold on it you know they want to eat wiggle tails out of the trash brother graham says they think that's something delicious but we're offering bread we're offering fresh bread it's holy bread it's sacred bread it's continual bread it's the bread of his presence amen and that's what sustains us is the 12 mysteries of god's word amen that's true because remember if you don't accept the mystery of the godhead you're going to eat what the leaven of the three persons and what does that produce in all these trinitarian preachers well you can see it adulteries uh love of money blasphemies they pretend to speak in tongues they get filled with demons instead right i mean look look look what it produces when they eat the wrong bread thank god brothers sisters thank god we got a holy bread amen oh my god that's glorious that's just one of them there's 11 more that's just one the unholy the leaven bread that they're feeding out there in their churches oh but not you and i that we get to eat on the bread of his presence amen healthy bread church oh it's you think organic's healthy my this is uh devonic is that a word devineck this is divine bread in other words better than organic it's divine that's not the word but i'm just trying to make it sound like organic that's what we're feeding on remember that other one israel's spiritual blindness if they don't recognize that they're basically cursing jews they're cursing god's people they're they're saying god's people are in hell because they rejected the messiah but no we've got the fresh bread we still pray for them they're condemning jews and we're praying god bless them protect them have mercy on them why because our diet is the right diet and the bible says you can't curse what god is blessed see that's why it was so critical and at the end of every chapter i have all the rewards for receiving the revelation and all the consequences right because there's a consequence if you turn down the holy bread which thank god we haven't but if they turn down the holy bread there has to be a consequence if you don't want to eat god's bread that's fine you'll have to go back to the garlics of egypt right like brother says the garlics and onions and the what do they call it all the food of egypt but he's saying no my kingdom i'm calling them out of that that diet i'm calling them to a holy diet in heaven a diet of living and eating in my presence amen oh hallelujah thank god one of the worst ones is the baptism of the holy ghost like i said they're turning down the holy truth of it's three works of grace and what are they getting they're getting a bunch of false conversions they're getting a bunch of workers of iniquity like i said if you want to see a video i'll share the video with you here's the name of the uh youtube site uh apostasy report man that guy tears it up he goes through all these preachers and he shows how they're all preaching apostasy i was just watching that or listening to that yesterday i said thank you jesus my you have delivered us from such you delivered me from all my denominational doctrine i could have been doing the same things then the reason they do that is because their their diet's wrong right they're not eating on the real word of god right because when you eat on the word you grow up into christ as we saw this morning if you're really eating on the diet of a christian your roots go down and you you grow up higher in the spiritual things you reach out to the sun you reach out to uh your life-giving resource amen but if you don't we know what happens they they are corrupted and die right i'm trying to think of some real obvious ones oh yeah well this is the worst this is one of the worst ones too mystery babylon the bible said any man with wisdom with the gift of wisdom can see that the babylon sits on seven hills right and now they show in that video uh all the apostasy preachers they're all trinitarians except td jakes he's kinda sometimes he is sometimes he's not they showed on there brother sister they showed all these preachers and they're all saying how the pope is such a great man and one of them is rick warren which i was really disappointed because i really liked his book and i didn't i didn't realize he said that about the pope all like all the things he said about the pope and i mentioned him on my video so i might have to edit that video it's one of my it was one of my honorable mention favorite books because it was a great book but that was before he kind of went in the ecumenical move but anyways it shows all these people and then it shows a famous preacher and i forget what state he's in i think it's georgia in other words he's got thousands in his attendance he's a well-known preacher and church he walks up there they have all the bishops walk up there they kiss the pope on this side they kiss him on that side and this protestant preacher who's got millions of dollars he walks up there and he kisses the pope he gets out of the way and then his wife comes up they're literally kissing the antichrist the soon to be antichrist did you see it recently he's talking about dying you see that it was in the news yesterday he said i don't want to die in argentina i want to die in rome because that's his home country he's thinking about death he's ready to die so i wonder if this next one will be now brother brahm did say a quote a pope will rise out of america there's never been one but just you know that quote's not thus saith the lord so some people jump on that brother back and they're like it's got to come out of america but again it's not thus saith the lord so you got to be careful we make thus saith the lord but think about that because they turned down the holy bread of there's a false church and run from it right come out over my people because they turn down that bread that meal have come out over my people they said i don't want that they're making love to the woman right the prostitute they are making love to a prostitute church the bible said she prostituted herself with all the nations of the world [Music] jesus said call no man father on this earth now we can see how they live a sinful life you know both sides that wasn't a big surprise but look but see it proves they've turned down the fresh bread that you and i eat every sabbath amen praise god amen glory we get to eat the fresh bread but they're eating the contaminated bread of the days of the old days right the contaminated but we got a feast on the fresh bread of this hour oh my oh it's a beautiful picture church i wish i i wish i had the wish i had the time to explain it that's why i wrote the book oh my thank the lord so see it is through these 12 cakes they had continual fellowship with god it's through our understanding of the 12 mysteries that we have communion with god any other views are unholy they're spoiled or stale bred sometimes i'll eat a piece of bread brother bang my children left it over there overnight and i'm like i just can't waste this bread my wife made this bread it was actually really good bread it's sour dough it's just a little crunchy but sometimes i'll eat that i think i just got to get it down right and put some water on there you know i just got to get it out i don't want to see this bread go to waste i do that with their eggs too you know but not not the next day just that later that night because that's really gross now i'm kind of like oh i'm kind of old-fashioned like that we grew up poor and so i gotta you know lick every i gotta get every food off my plate and i just can't throw food away i just can't do it uh but look these churches are serving up spoiled bread stale bread moldy bread saying god is three persons and he's he's got he's not lonely in heaven because he's got two other people with him he can carry a conversation we need to have communion like god had with himself oh come on that's that's just total insanity that's a polytheism right that's the bread they're being served and they eat it up and can you imagine gobbling that up i saw uh i saw a picture recently of uh what state was that there's a real bad state might have been california i don't know which one but anyways they have these homeless guys walking and they're picking through the trash sister naomi in america they're picking through the trash and you can see all the junk and everything and that's exactly what churches are doing today i've seen that south america when i was down there dude they had homeless guys that were crazy they were almost naked one of them i think was almost naked i didn't get to see him but they would there be just trash piled up for a whole block and they'd be going through there picking what condition do you have to be in to pick through trash to eat it but the scripture and jesus said that's what they're doing the bible said the tables are full of it's a really awful mess because they turn down the holy bread of god i think we should be thankful tonight don't you hallelujah i mean they're all about this uh they're all about you know covered and clearing off and making everything clean i'll tell you we got the cleanest table there ever was amen praise god amen and ain't because of hand sanitizer it's because of the power of the cleansing power of the blood of jesus amen hallelujah amen not only did it cleanse our table it made our bread fresh and clean amen amen holy bread praise god and we won't take that defiled bread i won't let it come across the pull but brother back you've stood by me all these years buddy by god's grace i've not let defile bread come across this pulpit as far as i know i've tried to clean up everything that anything false i said or anything i try to apologize if i say something wrong and any preacher that i had questions about i don't ask him back so if you know they were here a few years ago but out here now there's a reason i could tell you more about that maybe i'll get to that later not tonight but see we want a clean table naturally right naturally but more importantly spiritually we want it natural as well so see brother uh brother sister we don't want to feed stale bread moldy bread it's not a coincidence there's 12 mysteries that are labeled as mysteries and there's not three there's not five there's not seven a seven's completion well god didn't want to use completion god wanted to use kingdom twelve for the kingdom this is bread for the kingdom right the kingdom of priests praise god why do you want anybody to do seven seven seven church ages because there's a type there was 12 revelations that the church needed to restore to finish the mystery of god right so as we as the kings and priests we're to constantly feast on the preaching of his holy bread i forgot to set a timer so i want to i'm sorry i want to do the hour uh and so we feast on these does everybody understand so far i've gone over this a couple times now it might be new the blands um you probably heard it right buddy and i'm sure you've heard it by the way numerous times well let me close this let me just bring this down to close here i just want to pull up a few quotes so you can see that brother brown mentions this numerous times okay here we are okay okay here we are the bread now this is a 19 c now this is really important i thought it was brother branham's finishing up his uh sermons on the church ages in 1960 and he's praying he preached revelation chapter four part one now this is the sermon before the holy ghost came down and made those seven circles of shadows for the church age book this was the service this was the morning before that one i'm sorry the week before that one the week before that one brother rams praying he said help me god because i seek sincerely to know your will that i might do it to bring you as you show me many years ago when i left this church the bread of life to the peoples of the world now catch us when i saw that great mountain of bread and white robe saints coming from all over the earth to eat this bread of life oh god let me oh god let me never never fail to feed the people on the bread of life bless these hungry souls in here that raised their hands just now now brother bang when i saw that i about shouted amen praise god god showed brother madam a dream as he's preaching the church ages that he's got a mountain of bread and here we saw two stacks of bread right he saw a mountain of bread and all the people of the world are coming to get the bread the bread of his presence amen hallelujah amen the word of god hallelujah the revelations of god's word they're coming from every nation ah because they're gentiles and brother bran was a gentile prophet to finish the mystery of god to the gentiles amen amen and they're all coming to get this mountain of bread i was in there brother back i'll tried one of them i was like trying to climb that mountain and get the bread hallelujah i've got it amen i'm from america right we got all of our friends from around the world getting their bread climbing up the mountain and getting the bread and feasting on the bread he said help me god to feed the peoples of the world from this mountain of bread in 1964 brother brahm said you are kings and priests and you enter into the holy place and the holy holiest of holies eating showbread or bibles with brand new revelations did you know this quote this is from identified christ of all ages he said inside the badger skin behind the human skin in there in the shekinah glory in there is power and there's the word in there is the shoe bread and the shekinah glory which is the light that makes light that ripens grain you kansas people know by your wheat crops without the sun it won't light and until you come in behind that badger skin until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old creeds and coming to the presence of god then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the shekinah glory then the bible becomes a new book then jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living in his presence eating the shoe bread that's only provided that day for believers priests only oh my hallelujah praise god amen sea brother man says you're living in his presence eating the bread for priests but you gotta come in past the outer court hallelujah into the holy place where there's church ages where there's bread where there's prayer oh that's what we need today prayer amen i said we need prayer that will bring us all into the baptism of the holy ghost prayer hallelujah that's why i'm praying for my children you know one way you know that you're born again is prayer because you can't go into the baptism holy ghost without prayer aaron couldn't go in there right and it can't just be any prayer it's got to be sweet prayer it's got to be fiery sweet prayer that's how it takes you in the presence of god that's what i long for you know my children like those sight and sound and they're like lamp lighter you ever ever know what i'm talking about i think the bland's new i think they're great stories i think they are oh they're great but the reality when somebody really really wants god the way to get to god is through prayer amen hallelujah that's my longing my desire for my children and all the saints right i mean everyone that's not born again is to be so in love with god that you can you you live amen you live from the light of the church ages amen hallelujah and then you feast on these revelations and that they're they're so delicious that they're drawing you closer to god and you approach him in prayer with a fiery sweet prayer and then you that takes you into the presence of god amen and then there in his presence amen hearing his voice from off the mercy seat praise god thank you jesus man that's beautiful praise god you're living in his presence eating the shoe bread that's only provided that day right fresh bread for believers priests only [Laughter] hallelujah bye brother we try to give out how many church agent books have we tried to give out they're like people don't like yeah they don't want it right oh but me i'm like yes yes i was like give me that one give me that one it used to be a dollar remember that bro now it's eight dollars used to be a lot easier to get oh yeah give me those revelations i'll i'm going to eat those up because that's what makes us we're priests right that teaches us how to serve god how to intercede and how to become a real child of god how to be a real priest brother said and we are priests a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to god but you must come in behind the veil to see the unveiled god and god is unveiled that's his word made manifest all right one more bear with me here one more then we'll get to the communion do you love the lord tonight amen i hope it's a blessing praise god i hope i hope the bread is fresh to you tonight praise god oh thank the lord i just no this does so much for me now this is what i was talking about a few wednesdays ago even though brother bram never said 12 mysteries this is a this is more information of the same revelation people are going to criticize me no doubt they already have when i preach this other places like oh brother ram never said 12 mysteries well it doesn't contradict anything it actually lines up with everything right it actually makes sense you got to have 12 pieces of bread before you go into prayer because you can understand all the mystery you can eat all the bread right and still not be in the holiest of holies amen so see it's it's rightly divided and it's placing everything in its right position church ages mysteries prayer holiest of holies amen it's all placed together now this last quote here the unveiling of god 1964 he said the shekinah glory so the holy spirit in the holy place and the holiest place rather ripens the shoe bread we feast on and drive across the country for hundreds of miles and god bless the blands amen for driving how many miles is it here brother not sure okay for wendy it was a 170 i think one way so every week she drove over 350 miles or so just to come to church and so i like to use that quote with her you know not now they get to use it you know they they use it too brother ram said the shekinah the holy spirit is ripening the bread that's in the holy place that we drive across the country for in other words he's not about his ministry his ministry was the former reign glory the preaching the mystery the revelation of the mystery so they had to drive around the country to get it because that was one of the few people preaching it he said it's the believer's food it's only for a believer ah that's right that's the truth our church proves that every time remember the shoe bread was only for the believers see shoe bread seed he calls it shoe bread seed that's interesting what does it do that she kind of glory over the shoe bread kept it from spoiling what's the kind of glory today to break beyond the veil to see who god is standing before you to see who god is standing before us the pillar of fire jesus is veiled now in human flesh but what does the shekinah what does it do the shoe bred seed the word that we're to live on this day by these promises the shekinah glory ripens the shoe bread brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer that laid in the pages of the bible year after year the word for this age amen in other words church malachi 4 5 and 6 revelation 10 7 it laid there as a seed amen for 2 000 years but now in the prince of the shekinah it's brought that seed to life and now it brings forth and now we feast on that word amen amen do you see it i hope i made it clear by god's grace so that seed laid there all those years but now was the time for it to ripen my goodness he said to the denominations it's a stumbling block isn't that the truth to the nominations they stumble at it down through the years luther wesley martin luther and all sankey finney john smith knox all stumbled at it but what's it to be done the last days what is to reveal to bring forth what's malachi 4 to do to turn the people back from that stumbling block to break down the traditions and reveal the bread with the shekinah glory watch it ripe and produce just exactly what it said it would do oh my the shoe bread for this age to the denomination of stumbling block a bunch of fanatics but we who believe now as revelation 10 as promised all the mysteries of god that's been hid in the pages down through them years would be riped and brought forth in the age of the seventh angel's message praise god the church said amen amen hallelujah was there anything else i wanted to share help me lord was there anything else i thought there's feel like there's something else i know i said that was my last quote praise the lord oh yeah i kind of remember let me see if i can find it uh bear with me just one moment here i'm looking for the word uh tables of stone right last thing i want to share here remember church when they broke into the whole the holiest of holies so this is where we can be today amen we can come to the church ages we realize wow we're living on the light of laodicea in other words we got to live hot today right that's the message that's the light of the lao scene age the laodicean candlestick is live hot don't be lukewarm like a precious brother told me yesterday he said i'm lukewarm and i said brother i said you gotta get i said you gotta get to the fivefold ministry because that will perfect you that will edify you that will build you up i said i'm a witness praise god i said i'm more on fire now than i was then praise god god's kept me on fire but he admitted he was lukewarm and he goes to denomination so see and i didn't ask them to say it they said it as i went through the word see the word discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart amen amen as i start bringing out the revelations and the yesterday you know it just came out and i said you've got to move past the nomination you got to obey the word and you got to come to hear the real preaching of the word amen and no no criticism no of anybody you know i'm just saying i thank god that god helps us to know our true condition right and then we even have a decision we can either draw closer to god or we can eat his bread oh i'm thankful to eat the bread praise god thank you for eat the bread but once you break in or i'm sorry after you you feast on these mines uh the godhead uh the the rapture the kingdom of heaven i've seen you guys eat them all up you know over the years bang i've seen magneto he just smiles you know i'll cry and i'll shout out praise god on some of these revelations bye they're just so delicious you know naomi and her family's happy praising the lord and singing and the girls are singing praising god they make us so happy they they feed us amen there are nourishment when you preach on these things but after that you get to a prayer life and it's that it's that continual prayer life that that incense that brings you in the presence of god you dare not go in there without the burning fire right without the burning smoke and the incense that takes you in there and then when you're in there you know there's the ark there's a cherubim right and that's all that's in there but inside the ark you have three items and what are those represent let me just close with this you have the two tables of stone you have the pot of mana that's some different bread there and then you have aaron's rod those three things now what do they speak of the tones i'm sorry the stone tables speak of the new testament covenant it's now written on the fleshly tables of your heart so when you get born again you don't got to worry so much about memorizing this although it is good to do right it is good especially for your your human spirit but when you're born again the holy spirit you don't even have to read it you'll just be sitting listening to a sermon and the holy spirit will write that word upon your soul praise god in other words your nature amen it'll write the the word of god upon your nature so even if you forget glory you and satan comes around here he'll try to deceive you that nature already has a witness and it speaks out it says something's wrong brother says like a little buzzer that goes off ah that's wrong stay away from that that disagrees with the word thank god that he hides his word in our hearts amen amen without it we might be deceived but because we got it in our hearts we can't be deceived hallelujah it'll deceive so close but it will not deceive the very left why because he's got the tables of stone he's got the word and his soul and you can't deny the word if it's in you amen no it's your nature amen said you have a portion of god in you so you've got oh you got a witness written on your heart god in other words god's marked you right that's what the seal is mark hallelujah i'm glad with amen i got it jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i got hebrews 13 8 i got acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you i got mark 16 lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen all glory i'm so glad it's written on my heart that's why people question the message and they'll leave because they never got in there they never got in idah brother let me just share a quick testimony can you stop the live stream there god bless our live stream here i just want to share a quick testimony
