one more before we get into the word of God here tonight okay we haven't signed this one for years but it just came to my mind uh look up a child of the king we used to sing this when we first got saved first come in the message you just let me sing it for uh you know I'll get it started and you can kind of follow along I don't know if you remember this but but this song was remind me who I am right and now this song is I'm a Child of the king praise God oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king is [Music] who was wretched and born Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] the last three minutes [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] Grace God bless you as we stand let's go to First Kings chapter three I'd like to speak on part two of leadership here tonight you know Sunday was a wonderful day of course and I think the message was really timely you know we had a visitor we had visitors Wednesday I'm sorry Sunday um and one of the visitors course was they've just been needing uh they've been wondering about the leadership you know of the Holy Spirit and so it was very timely message I couldn't you if we're live stream I shouldn't say much more but it was a very timely message I didn't know we were going to have visitors you know and we missed you guys my God it's very glad Austin he's doing better but it's a very timely message I could see how God's hand was in it I really could thankful to that for that by God's grace and let's go to First Kings chapter three I'd like to look again at Solomon's Prayer this is the prayer that God loved and so we'll be looking here first Kings 3 verse 7. we'll read seven eight nine and ten why don't we uh why don't we just read seven together Acacia and then I'll read 8 9 if you can leave them up there that'd be helpful First Kings 3 7-10 let's read verse 7 together if we can ready one two three and now oh Lord my God thou Hast made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or come and look at the humility of Solomon here now remember when we read about David David the Bible said David led the men out and he led them in David was a man of war but Solomon is humble and he's honest he's like he's praying the Lord and he says Lord I don't know how to go out I don't know how to come in other words I don't have the experience of my father so he's offering a prayer in his weakness how many know we have to pray in our weakness and look God receives us in our weakness God's not God's not looking down upon us because we're weak or we're struggling God actually wants us to pray through our weakness right because our weakness what do we made are we are we made weak or strong in our weaknesses were made strong like Paul says now verse 8 I'll read eight nine and ten and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou Hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people and the speech please the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing amen let's have a word of prayer here that's what we have a need if you have I'm sorry if you have a need on your heart let's make an order to God you can lift your hands in prayer or just speak to God as we pray father God we're happy to be in your presence we're Children of the king hallelujah thank you for reminding us who we are Lord we were wretched and vile but Lord your blood has washed us and now we have your royal blood flowing through our veins we'd say in other words we have the Holy Ghost flowing through our minds Hallelujah Quicken our souls Lord God we're grateful for that Lord God we're Children of the king so anoint us here tonight Lord to get into the channel of the preaching of Thy word Lord speak your word to your people hallelujah and father we're just trusting you to minister Lord as we pray these prayers minister to brother amen and sister who God is we're we're looking for you to move on their behalf we know you're in the house and Lord we know you're in the hospital there so father just move in a special way Lord God bless these doctors guided I just pray God you do a great work for our brother Lord we speak life we speak healing we speak prosperity of Health Lord for our brother and we speak victory for our sister in the midst of this difficult season in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I don't have any really slides today so we'll just preach off the notes Here by God's grace you know again I you know the last few messages have been as I told you Sunday was very timely for the visitors there and we'll just see we've been praying you've heard me put prayer requests in for the church right the other Church in Pennsylvania so it was related to to this situation so we're very thankful it was all ordained of God um I just stand amazed at God's grace you know just the way God will lead us to sing songs and preach and the prayers and everything it's just all that of the Lord and even with you know the situation with Brother amen's Health you know remember the Wednesday before this happened I went off the dancing series I thought and I even said beforehand this is really strange but I'm going to go back to this isolation and look at Temptations because God may be bringing us to Temptations and here we are and I even use the examples of Temptation in our flesh like just some of these the same exact things we see ourselves in now uh God brought us to this so the same God that brought us to us brought these trials to us is the same God who's going to bring us through the trials remember Church the same God that was had a hedge about us and we Rejoice rejoice in all those wonderful times the same God is with us here today praise God and so we've got to learn to give God a sacrifice of praise no matter the Temptations we're going through no matter the trials we're going through so we can clearly see the leadership of the Holy Spirit and that's kind of what we're looking at here tonight the leadership of the of the Lord praise God somebody preaching a few of these thoughts here from this book I've been reading a from Kevin Connor of course tying some scriptures and some quotes from God's prophet of course I put out the video today I don't know if you saw it I put out the video about there's these quotes brother Branham has you know he's being humble and he's saying uh he's saying there's a great one that's going to come after me and he's going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and and in some of those quotes brother Branham you know quotes Malachi 4 5 and 6. and so these quotes are from in fact all of them yeah all of them are before the seals which is interesting um and so you know some people take those quotes and they'll say the the preacher will rise up and say I'm the great one to come after brother Branham there's one in South Africa there's one in Germany there's people in America that do the same thing I'm the great one to come and you got to look to me for the revelation of the message so I put a I got an email about that last week and I just felt inspired I'm gonna make a video about this so I just put the video out today if that'd be a blessing you got to know if you know Naomi in your country I don't know if you have anybody that's you know battle with that like an eighth messenger or they would call themselves The Great one to come after brother Brown I don't know if you've had any experience with that but may be helpful you know to our church in some ways but some people make Joseph Branham the eighth that this great one to come but the the key to understanding this is a quote brother Brandon gives in the anointed ones at the end times he says Malachi 4 5 and 6 is already here in the in the nation now thus saith the Lord and he says the newspapers are writing about it and there was newspaper articles about brother Ram's Ministry and healings I mean they're all over and you can get them you can find them really easily um like I even met the one woman who was healed you know and there's numerous other examples Congressman Upshaw there's so many examples but just uh you know just a thought there that if we if we take all the quotes and you know we the beautiful part is we see brother bam growing you know in his ministry and he's so humble he he uh I put a quote on there I'm not sure if you're familiar with it but brother random says um brother man was talking about this and and one of the brothers in the church put this up there in the Tabernacle and put Branham there and brother Branham said don't put me he said I he said I don't think I have anything to do with that seventh messenger okay but he was being humble that was in 1960. right but then by the end of his ministry you know we everything points to him being the messenger of the hour so I just thought that'd be a helpful video if you're interested you know and going a little deeper on some of those topics and but it just assures us that we're not looking for anybody to come we're looking for the Holy Ghost to rise up in our lives also like that we're looking for the Holy Ghost to rise up in our Ministries right all the fivefold ministry right and remember brother said that's the message of the hour the fivefold ministry we'll get to that Lord willing in a couple Sunday nights by God's grace as the children did the Bible study there on Sunday night so that one went out uh today if you'd like to look at that one by God's grace but I'm just gonna I'm not going to background too much from Sunday if hopefully everybody heard the sermon but remember Solomon got his Revelation or his direction or vision from his father David it was pretty interesting as we saw it on Sunday David would sit down and write and the the Holy Spirit would anoint David and would just take over his pen and he would draw he would write out everything that was needed for Solomon's Temple right of course David didn't know it would be at that time David didn't know maybe it'd be Solomon the name of the the son but he knew it would be for his son because Nathan the prophet told him you know you're a man of war you you've spilled much blood you're not going to build the house he says your son's going to build it he's going to be a man of peace okay and his name was Jedediah or beloved my beloved Solomon that's what the name means my beloved and so uh Solomon got this pattern and in this beautiful prayer uh just so beautiful to see this here uh he humbles himself and he says I am but a child I don't know the exact age of Solomon here but he calls himself a child right so a most grown men don't call themselves children right now so we don't know how old he was maybe a teenager early teens mid-teens or maybe he is an adult and maybe he's just humbling himself and saying I'm I'm nobody or I I see myself as a child I'm nobody or I see myself as a child but the point is when he got into the prince of God and notice this prayer is after a thousand animals were sacrificed think about that you know the blood they had to Slit a thousand throats of all the Lambs and the bullocks a thousand sacrifices after a thousand animals were burnt and killed then he goes to God In Prayer right and he goes before the Lord and God actually appeared to him and said ask whatever you want now people today want a genie in the bottle that's the kind of God they want every and I would say like this you know which one of us wouldn't want God to come to us and say whatever you want I'll give it to you like we we would all want that I mean we would all be privileged to have that but God doesn't do that to all of us but he does promise US the desire of our hearts amen hallelujah praise God Hallelujah and if we seek the kingdom of God first what does that mean that means our heart is going to be changed to be United with the purpose of the kingdom of God and then if we're faithful to this prayer God will give us the desire of our heart because it'll line up with the purpose of God for our lives right it'll line up with the kingdom of God our place in the kingdom of God I'll say like that you know I'm happy uh for my life here I look at my life now I'm 42. I got eight children my children are taking their place in the house of God I couldn't be happier because when I was fit when I was 16 I wasn't anywhere I hated going to church and I look at this guy look at this gal 18 you know far beyond anywhere like you know Lydia's going to graduate and she got through all the high school as a real servant and got the Holy Ghost in high school and I couldn't say that and like now if you were to ask me when you first got married you know and had children what do you want your purpose to be I'm not sure what I would have said but I can look back now and say God gave me the desire of my heart praise God hallelujah praise God it's just beautiful because God's writing the story praise God you just yield yourself to God I've always sought God first that's one thing I have done by God's grace I've been perfect but I have put God first like I told you the testimony even with our house being renovated that happened that would have been in 2021 uh so that would have been 2006 uh 14. there have been 15 years into my Ministry I always put God's house first God's house first everything God's first and then in 2021 after 15 years God pours out this huge amazing blessing on on my physical house but I put God's house first for 15 years so I just think it's striking you know God wants us to seek him first and it taught me a lesson I didn't serve God to have that blessing on my natural house that's not why I served God I serve God because it's the right way praise God hallelujah I serve God because this message is Right Hallelujah this message has transformed my natural life and my spiritual life praise God that's why I serve God and then God turns around and writes my story and has given me the desire of my heart and now even my you know Haven how old are you now ten eleven okay I'm really bad with ages forgive me but now you know even she had testified in our dancing Services were the greatest Services she'd ever been a part of now and my children have danced danced in the church now I never did that you know so I look at my life and I say wow Lord I've just tried to humble myself and put you first and God has given me desires of my heart is what I'm saying so it's just a I just think it's it's a it's such a promise if you put God first God is going to honor you honor you praise God that's what that's what David said before he died he said God will honor those who honor God right God will always honor those who put him first and even if God would not have done that you know had not done great blessings at my natural house and I would have still served him I would have done like I did before take out a loan slowly pay it off I mean I would have done all that I mean just because you just have to do it or else your house is going to burn down you know got bad wiring or something like that you're just going to do it but see God is gracious and God God is writing the story for our lives and I wouldn't want it any other way praise God put God first and watch what he does praise God let him write your story Hallelujah now think about what it could have been I could have got up behind the pulpit and said well you know I've been here five years or ten years I'm going to start pulling for extra money can everybody give me some extra money right I could have done that or I could have went on YouTube and say I'm going to start a fund can everybody save me money I'm sorry can everybody send me money rather I'm gonna start a patreon campaign or I'm gonna whatever they call it I'm gonna start a GoFundMe can everybody fund me because I've got eight kids and all these things I could people could do that but see we've got to put God first follow God trust in God let God write our story humble ourselves let's pray a prayer like Solomon hallelujah amen look at this prayer now notice he calls himself a servant he's the king over millions but he says I'm God's servant may God help us to see ourselves as servants I'm God's servant I'm not the boss of this life I'm I'm God servant God's the boss of my life so look look at here we're looking at leadership this is what a leader does and we all can be leaders a leader says first I'm a servant right you've chosen me in this position and I'm just a little child I'm nobody and in other words I'm ready to grow Hallelujah I'm ready to grow I'm ready to learn I'm in this learning stage praise God I don't have it all figured out I need you to guide me praise God look at this humility and I don't know how to go I don't know how to fight all these battles and the church said I hear our brother amen's physical battle we don't know how to fight all these battles so God lead us to help to help him praise God lead us in prayer lead us in visits lead us with food or lead us whatever we can do right we're we're all young I mean we're all I'm the oldest one here tonight you know Beatrice is the oldest one on Sundays you know right I mean we're all we're all pretty fairly Young you know and I like I just like how Simon humbles himself good Lord you have to show me how to go out to the battle you got to show me how to fight the battle and you got to show me how to come in from the battle praise God you got to show me how to fight and you gotta show me how to humble myself coming back from the battle so this is a Leader's prayer and like the Bible said there was no man wiser of the Kings than Solomon now did he was he faithful with it all the time of course not now I think there's a great debate whether now this could be a great debate whether he was wiser than John the Baptist or not because John the Baptist was the greatest of all the prophets so that could be a debate for another time as we said on Sunday but I think that's a good that's a great thought I really would like to maybe preach a whole sermon on that how John the Baptist could be the greatest you know he didn't get married he could have Moses got married look I mean he could have went out and got a job John didn't have I didn't go out to get a job got John trusted in nature God right nature he trusted every time I say nature I think of her I mean look look what he did and he said he could have stayed in the city but he said I'm going out to the Wilderness so I so I'm ready for my commission now look at that Moses around to Wilderness because he was afraid of being arrested and killed as a murderer John went out there voluntary to seek God's face to make sure he was ready for the calling of his life right and he knew his mom and dad would have had told him the angel said the spirit of Elijah is going to be on you you're a Nazarite unto God and look he look at that he took his vow seriously he didn't waste his youth he didn't waste it out with drunk drunkenness and prostitutes like Samson right so that's that's probably the start of another sermon I'll get to Lord willing but here look at this humble prayer of Solomon First Kings 3. and then in verse 9 he said give me an understanding heart so I can know right from wrong right that's what we need today this is the most deceptive time there's ever been right there's never been a more deceptive time look how close Joseph Branham is and the tapers look at these message preachers I mean sometimes like I said sometimes it shakes me we're almost a year from the time where the preachers were saying you know the Rapture is any day any hour almost a year from that and here we are I mean that really shook me up that's why I preached that series on pride and doctrines of devils I mean it just shook me up how can people and they're how can people make these statements and there's no accountability that's because there's no economy in the church then right that means nobody's got the courage to go up and ask questions they're not allowed to ask questions but he says give me an understanding heart to judge the people to know right from wrong good and bad because who can judge this large group of people so one way I'm thankful for a small church because it's easier to judge because there's less people right Hallelujah I thank the Lord for that praise God and in verse 10 it's pleased the Lord now I like how he calls himself a child because the Bible said in Romans 9 26. that we were not God's people but now we are called the children of the Living God okay we are children Living God Galatians 3 26 says for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus when you have when you put your trust in Jesus Christ you're now Jesus Christ child you're a child of God for as many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ so you put on his family name praise God you're a Christian you're a child of God thank God I'm not a child of the devil praise God that's what Paul told that uh that sorcerer right oh you child of Satan remember called him a child of Satan thank God we're not children of Satan praise God or children of God hallelujah that means we got a father that means we got an inheritance praise God that means we got a future home in our father's house praise God glory and now go to take your Bibles go to first John 4 verse 4. let's read this one this will be a good one to read here first John 4 verse four I'd just like you to read this one I just want you to see that look at the context here I just want to encourage you to church it's a great thing and just overcoming demonic spirits of deception right I interact with them all the time people can say uh I believe in in God and uh they say I believe in I believe brother Brown was a prophet of God but I believe every word on the tape is thus say the Lord and they're totally convinced they're so deceived and I you no matter what I show them you can't shake them there's nothing you can do that's why I pray God be merciful that they can recover themselves out of the snare of Satan right there's nothing you could say because they've got a demon Spirit they love to worship that they worship that spirit I don't know why they love to worship a deity spirit I have to pray to God for Revelation on that why would they love worshiping a man above Christ I don't know maybe it's because they can feel some connection to the tape or I don't know they can say they hear the voice of God in the tape or something I have no idea why would why would they want to worship why would they love a deity spirit why would they want to worship a man uh creation more than the Creator that's the same thing homosexuals do right that's what the Bible says homosexuals worship the creation rather than the Creator but look at verse four year of God little children and now look little children can overcome everybody say catch that here of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world so we're spiritual children of God God sees us as his children but we're Overcomers because he puts a portion of his power inside of us praise God and so when we're we're coming into the battle like David would go out to the battle when we go out to the battle we've got to stir ourselves up and remember God put something greater in me praise God then this temptation I have a greater power in me than the force or this this evil spirit that I'm battling I've got a greater power so I will overcome it's built into me praise God Amen Hallelujah there's a greater power in me than he that's in the world Satan of course Satan's in the world but go up to verse one here's the context the context is with lying deceiving spirits beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world that's why I tried the brothers that say they're the greatest of all time I tried them I emailed them I reached out to them and I believe they're wrong that's why I tried to Brothers about uh predicting the rapture or days or hours away that's why I try them because the Bible said try the spirits that's what they don't want they don't want to ask or they don't want to answer questions right so don't believe and I'll say like this even don't believe every single thing I say because you've I'm sure you've heard hundreds of my mistakes by now uh you know I was thinking amen and Naomi been here almost eight years eight years you know eight years Bang's been here the whole time my wife's been here the whole time but you know I'm human that doesn't mean you take complexes toward me but you're just careful what you say Amen to it you're careful what you believe right believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they're of God many false prophets are going on in the world so we've got to watch out for false prophets remember just the example Joseph Branham said he went out to Arizona to come back he says I've got the word of the Lord for you he said thus saith the Lord he said keep playing the tapes you're in the perfect will of God now to me that's a false prophecy because brother Ram never said that the Bible never said that right and so that's how that's how deceptive false prophets are right so close but it won't deceive the elect praise God aren't you glad Church you can't be deceived Hallelujah that's what the Bible says and then verse 2 hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God now we all know this verse there's got to be a deeper meaning than this right because every denominational person will say Jesus Christ has come in the flesh so there has to be a deeper meaning now the best I understand right now is the understanding is um every person that's born again recognizes Jesus Christ in them Jesus Christ has come in my flesh now that could be the wrong thought but I'm just giving you a thought because we all know Catholics that say Jesus has come in the flesh and they pray to Mary or women preachers or homosexuals that go to the pulpit they would say I believe Jesus Come In the Flesh they all say that so there has to be a deeper understanding here and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist which ye have heard that it should come and even now already it is in the world so there's something about the spirit of antichrist that denies Jesus Christ in flesh amen can I say like this this is my own thought right now I could be wrong but it denies that there's a group that's the Bride of Jesus Christ say like that in other words they deny we're the bride they would say they're the bride they're denying Jesus Christ in the flesh in other words they're denying the message of the hour they're denying the group who holds the message of the hour praise God that's the best I can understand from that now the context for our verses verse 4 about little children now he says year of God little children and overcome them who's to them it's those that are denying Jesus Christ is come in the flesh it's those false prophets you see sometimes we think our battles you know are so small but Church our battles are great these are great battles to overcome all these deceiving voices out there this is the context there's many antichrists anyone who's against the word is an antichrist praise God right Paul I'm sorry John says there's already many antichrists out there but the leadership of the Holy Ghost gives us power to overcome them greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world Amen the leadership praise God Hallelujah overcome them overcome who the false prophets with the Antichrist Spirit on them right like we had the Antichrist Spirit try to come in a couple of years ago uh they call they said they want to come up and testify uh they said just for 45 minutes or something and and try to bring a new different interpretation of the of the message and I said no you're not you will not and don't come to church if you're going to try to do that that was the Antichrist spirit the Rapture has already happened or that I think you said there's no rapture uh you don't have to pay tithes don't have to go to church yet the Bible plainly says it right yet claiming to believe God sent brother random all these things it's so deceptive but it proves we had a greater power in us than the power that's in the world praise God just simple examples like that Antichrist anti-word right anti-revelation from Christ okay so he calls you little children but little children you overcome by the greater power that's inside of you all right now Solomon was willing to follow God's judgments at the beginning of his ministry right and God blessed him and then this led to the great prayer that God loved all right it's a beautiful prayer here we saw now if you got your Bibles here let's let's I want to start looking here at a few types here now remember Solomon got the pattern from David but Solomon also I want to start looking at a type here because you you know and I asked myself this too how does Solomon's Temple connect to me like we you know we just might in our own minds maybe a little weary say well how does this how does this sermon even apply to me but I want you to catch it tonight by God's grace you know I showed you a few weeks ago we looked at uh the Tabernacle of Moses the Tabernacle of David and then the Temple of Solomon right and we saw the type there Old Testament Moses New Testament David and Millennium Solomon right now I'm going to take that type uh that uh the type there of Millennium but I'm also going to show another aspect a different type to it okay I'm going to type that uh the the building of Solomon's Temple I'm going to type the building of Solomon's Temple to the spiritual Temple God's Building right now in other words all the Holy Ghost filled members of the body of Jesus Christ did you know that's happening right now did you know God's Building a temple right now I'm going to prove it by the scripture now Church who knows how many years did it take for Solomon to build the temple anybody know seven that's a beautiful type amen we don't die I like giving a high five so anytime walking around it might give you a high five okay I like pound on the wall like brother Diggs and then Things fall off the wall when I when I go back in my office Hallelujah but it's a beautiful type not only did it type the millennium it does type in London but it also types the spiritual building God's Building right now and that's what I want to show tonight so when you look at Solomon's temple being built you see I'm a part of that Temple can I say it like this I'm a stone in Solomon's Temple or you might say I'm a gem I'm a diamond I'm a carbuncle what are some of those names there I'm a is it a topaz there you're one of those jewels you are part of the body or the Temple of Jesus Christ praise God but it's a spiritual Temple the Bible says and it's a spiritual Temple because God lives in that Temple praise God Amen the prince of God abides in his people praise God but it takes seven years to build Church it takes seven Church ages to build I think finally I got the answer I just got to wait on the Lord he'll renew your strength praise God so I want you to see here how Solomon here uh he's a type of the Holy Spirit because remember David was a man of war Solomon was not salmon was a man of peace so in the in the second new type we're typing today Solomon represents the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is wisdom it took a man of wisdom to build the house of God it took a man of peace and isn't the Bible say the Holy Ghost kingdom is righteousness joy and peace amen hallelujah praise God Psalm is no Solomon is noted for peace and wisdom David precedes Solomon Solomon completes David one is incomplete without the other David received the pattern Solomon builds that pattern one Ministry made way for the other one king made way for the next king praise God in other words the ministry of Jesus Christ in his body led to the ministry of the Holy Ghost praise God because he said if I don't go away he said the comforter won't come and it's more expedient that I go away so more people have the pillar of fire living inside of them amen hallelujah so that each person could have God's presence each person can have a greater power to overcome in them rather than just one person having the power many could have that greater power praise God oh my starting to see that now Hallelujah so in David we see Christ in his death because it's a shedding of blood everybody see that David's Ministry type Jesus Earthly Ministry but Solomon and and yeah and then David conquered all the enemies he he completely inherited all the Promised Land didn't Jesus purchase all your promises right it's beautiful hallelujah oh I love that bye so Solomon is viewed as Christ in his resurrection and in his current place as mediator over the church he's building the church praise God that's what I ended with I'm going to go back to this on Sunday I I really ended quickly I kind of cut out some some important scriptures I want to show there but let me go that I wanted to say this church that you and I are all building something you're building a testimony that's why I said you're a leader that's why we can you know we can go look to the Natural salmon builds things like my brother Paul he's a project manager and they build Bridges he's in charge of Building Bridges can you imagine that or massive multi-million dollar building steel buildings that's why he was intrigued by Solomon which I can relate to I can see where he's if he's in the building I could see how he'd relate to that but the Bible says you're building something too you're building a testimony You're Building A Life That's worthy the gospel amen hallelujah because the Bible says wisdom builds her house right so when we go to your house the life you live the the how the family lives in the house that's what you're building you're building an atmosphere you're building a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit praise God you're building that and I was going to tie it on Sunday that you know our uh vang's dad Lee went home to what we hope to be with the Lord but now we can look back and see what he built right like William Williams now 70 right we can see what he's built now right we can see we can see where all these years in the message what it's built praise God you're building something so the Bible says be careful how you build you're building a testimony you're building an atmosphere in your home You're Building you're building a character right so the words that come out of your mouth and and the atmosphere that you constantly live in every day you got to strive but you can we can do it we got to fight you kind of we can press through all the the carnal the carnality and we can live in the spirit praise God like Austin has a good testimony maybe I'll have them share at the end about how he went to visit brother amen and he wanted to feel the Holy Spirit come in right brother so maybe we'll have you share that at the end that'd be a good testimony like you just wanted the prince of God to come in the room that's a beautiful testimony but you're building something and every one of us must be careful how we're building and we must build by what the wisdom of God Lord give me an understanding heart so I know if this is the right thing or the wrong thing before and how do I know I got to have the pattern amen I got to have the vision praise God where do you get that from the father Hallelujah your heavenly father will give you the pattern praise God see that's why we don't jump into things without praying about it we don't make massive decisions without praying about it first right because this is what children do children go to their fathers and they ask for the leadership right I'm just a child I don't know everything I don't have everything figured out father I'm coming to you guide me give me the understanding I need so we can see this beautiful type here so the Solomon's Ministry is like the the temple the temple building of the holy spirit's Ministry and it was a time of Peace praise God now let's read uh let's read a scripture here let me go let's go to let's go to First Corinthians 3 9. let's go there first Corinthians 3 9. and I'm going to look up look up a scripture while you're turning there First Corinthians 3 9. looking for that scripture wise master builder there it is that's all okay that is that's the right verse okay praise God yeah I didn't get the chance to get all the scriptures I wanted to do for a year Labor's together with God ye are God's husbandry you are God's Building how many understand that you're a part of God's Building in other words God wants to dwell in this sanctuary right God wants to dwell in your home in my home you're God's Building right God wants to God wants to go to Walmart with brother Chris right brother God wants to go to the elementary school with me you're God's Building I'm God's Building right you're God's husbandry let's look up what that word means here well husband Theresa that's I think a field right it's a field or a you're God's uh agriculture I say like that verse 10 here's what I want to get to according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder now look at this how how could he be so wise how could Paul build the church on the right way through the grace of God how are you going to build by the grace of God 's favor upon your life as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another bill that thereon but let every man take heed how he built it thereon now of course it's speaking of preachers right Paul laid the foundation now here I am I'm at the end time I'm 2000 years later brother Chris and I'm preaching and I'm trying to finish this building with all the other preachers sometimes they might put the wrong brick there sometimes I might put the wrong brick there God forgive me because we've got to be careful we gotta be careful I believe if they put the wrong brick God sends them out God dismisses them from the building right because Judas works well for a while but then he fell away but Paul said I build here I'm a wise master builder I did it by God's grace and everyone must be careful how you build upon the gospel God has a building God has a people that he dwells in how many happy to be a part of that amen hallelujah thank you Jesus so see now go down to verse 11 here for another Foundation cannot for other Foundation can no man lay other than that what is just laid which is Jesus Christ all right verse 12. now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones would hey stubble Every Man's work should be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work what sort it is all right so the day of judgment is going to show who built the right way on God's house who is the right who which preachers preach the right things I want to be one that preaches the right thing not the wrong thing so I'm going to take all my all my building materials I want to take them out of God's word Hallelujah that's exactly right now now I want to now go to this thought here by God's grace now go back to First Kings 5 verse two go back to First Kings five so I wanted to show the spiritual type Paul was a builder but I want to go back to the the Temple of Solomon First Kings 5 verse 2. actually let's read 5 verse 1 and 2. and hiring king of tire he sent his servants unto Solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him King in the room of his father for Hiram was ever a lover of David and Solomon sent to hire him saying thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house under the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every side until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet but now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil or current and behold I purpose to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God as the Lord spake unto David my father saying thy son whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build and house unto my name now I'm gonna go down to verse seven it came to pass when Hiram heard the words of Solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the Lord this day which hath given unto David and wise son over this great people and hire sent to Solomon saying I have considered the things which thou sent us to me for and I will do all that as I are concerning Timber of Cedar and concerning Timber of fur my servant shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household okay so we see Solomon in order to build this house he has to have help from a gentile King and the church said could a Jew build this all by himself no the other two could be the Temple of Mo or Tabernacle Moses Tabernacle of David those were built by Jew only but here with the Temple of Solomon it's Jew and Gentile and notice Kings amen Kings and Priests unto God Amen praise God and he says okay I'll send you the cedar you send me food for my people right so he has to get help from a gentile King he can't do it outside of help from a gentile King praise God and so Hiram God use this man to supply materials for the house he also had skillful men working alongside the skillful men of Israel so the Israelites and Gentiles worked together side by side in the building of God's house and this is typed in Ephesians 2 11. let's go to Ephesians 2 11. this is a type in Ephesians 2 11. now this is in my book actually put this in my book I think it's in chapter four of the or chapter two rather of the Jew and Gentile One Church Ephesians 2 11. actually Ten's a beautiful verse for that too look at someone took it verse 10 you say by Grace but verse 10 for we are as workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works he he's called you to build something and the church said he's called you to do something he's called you to work for his name which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them all right now this goes quite a ways down to the end of the chapter but I'm not going to read all that uh but let's read 11 through 13. wherefore remember that ye being in the time past Gentiles In the Flesh who were called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise having no hope and without God in the world think about that you had no hope until Christ came and died you had no promises until Christ came and died but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ there's no devil that can tell you you're not close to Christ the Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ brought you near to God so you can tell the devil no devil I'm near to God I might feel far in my feelings but I don't trust my feelings amen the Bible says I have promises I have covenants I'm close to God I'm in close proximity I'm close to my father Hallelujah I'm not far off I'm not wandering off in the wilderness or some stranded Island some far away no he's brought me unto himself amen he's brought me to his banqueting table his band Over Me Is Love Hallelujah he came looking for me praise God right he came and found me I was a lost sheep he came and found me and brought me into his banqueting table how was that shooting of mine praise God he called me out of the shepherd's field amen I was the one I was the one that was out there he came and found me I'm not worthy of it he's the king he's the royalty but he made me royalty praise God by marrying me Hallelujah that's what the Bible says amen spiritual all right now the Bible says be renewed in verse 23 be renewed in the spirit of your mind verse 22 says put off your corruptness and your lust verse 24 that you might put on the new man I'm sorry I'm in the wrong chapter forgive me forgive me I flipped the page there on accident go down to verse 18 for through Jesus him we both have access by one sphere unto the father now therefore you're no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and listen Church you are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone amen can I say it like this you are so stable nothing is going to destroy your building nothing is going to be able to topple you because your bill upon the strongest Cornerstone there ever was amen there's never been a Cornerstone like this Cornerstone praise God and look at we're built upon Saint Paul Glory we're built upon John and Peter and James Martyrs that gave their life for Christ we're built on that Foundation how could we fall how could we fail how could Satan knock us over it's impossible or build upon the Chief Cornerstone the Son of God Jesus Christ amen how could we fall we can't fall praise God verse 21 in whom all the building the building fitly framed together growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord this Temple is still being built Hallelujah so spiritually if there were spiritual signs here you'd see that caution tape construction area when you walk into church you'd see construction area and you see angels with hard hats making sure everybody's being taken care of we we found all the OSHA laws right we'd be fine every ocean law everything would be right in order glory amen we found all the commands amen hallelujah God is building something here praise God he's building a people he's building a place where his presence can dwell praise God he's building a bride Hallelujah and you're a part of it it's still under construction that's why this moment is just as important that's why every age was super important people try to exalt this age like it's better than others we couldn't even have this age unless they were faithful in the other ages amen right yes this age is important it's a finishing age it's the age where think about that church at one day the final member will come in the final ministry will be sealed by the Holy Ghost and then Jesus will come as The Headstone praise God and there'll be shoutings of Grace Grace that's Rapture time amen but the building's got to be finished first praise God the building's got to be built up each Stone each believer each testimony praise God each person's life has to be placed in there by the Holy Ghost and this is the glory of God this is the presence of God this is where God is worshiped but one day Jesus comes and he finishes that building praise God that's the rapture Hallelujah Glory see we're growing that's why Church the body of Christ is always growing in Grace the church is always being built it's going up greater with each with each age it gets greater and greater building up to the top in whom also ye are building together for inhabitation of God through the spirit about 40 minutes here so I'm trying to watch My Time by God's grace now I want you to see that Solomon using a gentile King to build the house is a type of the Jew and Gentile building the habitation of God in the New Testament right because the Holy Ghost fell on who first who the Holy Ghost fall on first Jews or Gentiles Jews right and then Peter had the keys and you opened the door of the kingdom of God to Samaritans and then open at the Gentiles right and now all all of them are working together right they're all working together because some Jews have the Holy Ghost right the small small just like small Gentile group but they're building the habitation of God they're finishing the body of Christ that's right it's a beautiful type and Shadow Church you are not a stranger to heaven when we get to heaven it's not going to it's not gonna be like oh this is a foreign land welcome foreigners it's gonna be like welcome home this is where I was meant to be This is Where I Come From the mind of Christ amen amen are they going to be like when Naomi come to U.S and you're just getting used to all the the customs and everything when I went to South America I used to all the customs and how they handle this and how do they buy things and just strange you got to get used to the Customs when we go to heaven it's not going to be like that we are fellow citizens I'm a citizen of Heaven praise God hallelujah you're a citizen of Heaven praise God God broke down any walls God broke down anything that would separate you you're not far from God you're close to God and you're going back to God hallelujah you're a citizen of Heaven praise God you're a child of the king but you've got to build while you're here praise God you've got to build I'm building as a preacher I'm super important How I build it's very important because I'll be judged by what I preach I'll be judged by what I live Hallelujah I want to be faithful that's right now Church there was another man named Hiram that uh another Hiram King Solomon reached out to two hirams okay so go to chapter seven uh First Kings seven I know it's hot in here and I know it's hard not to be sleepy on a late night so take a big deep breath or something like that thank the Lord it's good to be in the house of the Lord Hallelujah so First Kings seven thirteen and King Solomon said and fetched Hiram out of Tyree he was a widow son of the tribe of naphtalia and his father was a man of Tyree a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all the things and works in brass and he came to King Solomon raw all his work okay now this uh this Hiram seems to be part due in part Gentile because his mother was the tribe of Dan and her husband was of the tribe of naphtali and then his mother became widowed and she married a man of Tyree okay so this is again this man's probably have to have Gentile this other man named Hiram and he had wisdom Hallelujah he had wisdom with all the medals and the stones right and all the Engravings and so Solomon sends to him and he sends back and said he's able to help but the main point here is that Israel and gentile people were involved in the temple of the Lord this is totally contrasted to Moses's Tabernacle and David's they just it was all Jew God raised up Jews with wisdom well here during this time when the temple is going to be made mostly of gold silver some brass lots of gems Cedarwood over overlay with gold all these things here he has Gentiles working on it now you know the story Church you probably heard it before the Bible says that all these stones and all these all these gems were all cut outside of Jerusalem there was in Jerusalem there was no sound of saws cutting there was no buzz saws cutting right there was not all the cutting was done outside of the Holy place right after the place of God here's what brother Brown says about it there's lots of quotes on this but here's one of them this one I like when Solomon built the temple they was they was cut out from all over the world but when they come together there wasn't a buzz saw nor the sound of a hammer every block no matter if this one might have been a Oneness or a Tunis or a threeness this one was a fiveness whatever it was but when they come together they went dovetail one with the other that's right and there wasn't any arguing there wasn't any buzzing Hallelujah so what does this show we were all stones or gems out in the world right but it took somebody to cut us if someone all the arguing and fussing had to be done there in the flesh right but when we come before God when we take our place in the body of Christ Hallelujah when we take our place with the divine nature when we have the anointing on us there's no arguing Hallelujah there's no buzzing there's no cutting all that is done elsewhere before we get to this place here before we get in our place in the body of Christ all the arguing all the fussing was out when I was in the presbyan church like Simon said when we were in the Pentecostal church and they argued about tongues right we didn't argue we just disagree but that's buzzing right all that buzzing had to be done but God had to cut I disagree with that so God had to cut that that was me that was me getting cut right there like that was me getting cut out right I had to get shaved and then God brought me into the message of the hour praise God Hallelujah there's no cutting there's no arguing there's no buzzing here in the body of Christ there's no schisms in the body of Christ all the noise and all the all the sins all the all the division separation that found outside the body of Christ but in the body of Christ there's peace Hallelujah and everything fits together perfectly Hallelujah isn't that isn't that what happened church when we have think about when we have great anointed meetings it just it just sounds like from the first song all the way to the end everything is what perfect doesn't that sound like this building there's no cutting there's no buzzing there's no arguing there's no fussing hallelujah it's a foreshadowing it's a four taste of this body of Christ when the body of Christ comes out I'll say like this when the body of Christ gets all cut you know and and all corrected and and all repented outside the service when we all come together in the service and we're under the anointing we all fit together perfectly and this and the service flows perfectly but remember there wasn't any argument there wasn't any buzzing there wasn't any fussing they just went together and made the temple of God that's right and I believe God is cutting out everywhere Born Again children of God and going to bring them together I may not live to see to see it but I hope I do praise God oh thank God that's beautiful praise God so there's two Gentiles kings that help out now I'm not going to read all these because I want to finish up here I got 11 minutes and I'll be at my hour I'm really going to try to finish here but now these these II Chronicles 7. here's a list of Gentiles that were in Israel working on the temple but not right I'm sorry yeah they were working on the temple the total number of strangers it says was one thousand five I'm sorry was 153 600 gentiles that's a lot of workers seventy thousand were Bears of burdens or just uh the bird and bears the heavy lifters 70 000 men just to build this house and this house wasn't very tall it's 50 feet 50 feet tall but this is eight that's maybe eight feet there so you know stack a stack a few on there you know 50 feet was it four four five uh stories not very tall compared to Eiffel Towers I mean this Temple the Solomon Temple was nothing in height compared to that but yeah can I say like this yet its height reached unto Heaven praise God it might have been small and Thatcher but spiritually it had the ability to touch the heart of God hallelujah it reached hybrid in the heavens praise God this was a very small it wasn't a very large house at all we got the prince of God throughout there what an encouragement to us church we might be a small church but we can reach up to heaven praise God it's never in the size never in the size it's in the quality right it's in the purpose it's in the predestinated purpose of God what's the purpose of the Eiffel Tower what's the purpose of uh the Sears tower building there what's the purpose of these great Towers the Twin Towers what's the purpose that for the glorify man but the purpose of the temple was to glorify God the purpose of your life is to glorify God you're the habitation of God I'm the habitation of God God inhabits Our Lives okay moving on 80 000 were humors in the mountains or Timber Fellers they would cut the Timbers 80 000 workers three thousand six hundred were overseers this is where it might help my brother Paul you know you have a lot a lot fewer supervisors than you do laborers right but one man had to catch the vision Solomon had to see well I can't do this it was just the people here I need help from 150 000 workers outside of my Realm if this house is going to be built that's what leadership does leadership will guide you to find the right workers right it'll guide you to find the Holy Spirit if God wants something done God will get it done amen if God wants to do something in your life it's going to get done but you got to yield to it you got to trust the vision you got to trust the pattern Hallelujah 3 600 overseers of the Gentiles three over three thousand supervisors watching out all the humors and all the bearer burden bearers to bring all this Lumber all these stones now the men of Israel there was over 30 thousand men working and they sent ten thousand every month okay and they had the man Ado nyrum was set over these 30 000 courses okay so he had one man Solomon had one man over the Jews and he would be over one or sorry ten thousand men every month when they would come in think about that for seven for seven years ten thousand workers come in and they go out once a month for seven years to build this house this wasn't some Shanty right this wasn't some easy thing to put up seven years if my calculations are right that's almost 200 000 workers on one building and here's what they did they were humors of Timber they were stone masons Hallelujah they were Builders of the house they were Carpenters there's they were laborers so God took Gentiles and Jews both had to work together for seven years to build this house praise God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus church that's a long time to build something have you worked on something for seven years before I worked on that book for two and a half years I thought was going to kill me just because I'm impatient I'm an impatient kind of hasty kind of person have you worked on something for seven years before that's a long time you guys a long time to wait right just like it's a long time to wait for your prayers to be answered but how many still want to wait for God to move amen seven years seven long Church ages I heard Brothers say you know God God hit it from John and Paul that was going to be 2 000 years they all they were right they were writing like oh it's going to be any time the Rapture was coming anytime Rapture come anytime it was gonna be 2 000 years so Church let's not be impatient with God if the Rapture don't happen in our lives let's keep building let's build until we're called home praise God who would have thought just go back two generations right let's go back two or three generations what did I say we're three generations from my brother Brandon we're three generations from Brother Brown are you glad brother Randall finished his work for his generation yes right so we got to do the same thing we got to Faithfully build the Church of God the Church of Jesus Christ and I'm not talking I'm not talking Latter-Day Saints or this other direction I'm talking about the real body of Christ Hallelujah that believes all the Bible Hallelujah I've been studied on Azusa Street maybe Sunday I'll preach on that a little bit laws it takes church is just prayer prayer and obedience that's all it takes for Revival prayer and obedience that's all it takes there's not and and every generation has a chance at a Revival like Azusa Street every generation has an opportunity like that the thing is we the thing is all of us are just kind of unfamiliar what actually happened who's read a book on Azusa Street and Rachel anybody read a book I didn't think so neither had I but what happened its impact it was the start of the church age what happened well we need to find that out praise God and we'll find the same lessons now as I close I got five minutes to close for my hour church I think you can see the spiritual lessons can't you Christ by the holy spirit is building his church today with Jews and gentiles the Bible says so mostly Gentiles but there are some Jews and he's building it by wisdom he's building it by the gifts of the Holy Spirit that's right and he's got workers too the Bible says prophets are like hewers right the Bible says my Prophet will be like a humor cutting down on the trees cutting down the idols The Groves didn't brother Brown cut down all those denominational Groves you better believe it he had like Simon and cancer that he hammered an organization almost every service did he not that was everyone I was listening to today he was hammering on denominations again he had to cut out he had to cut down all those lies amen he had to cut down all those man-made uh systems and he had to start building up the real body of Christ praise God so who they who's the workers the apostles and Prophets laid the foundation Church you don't have to worry about laying the foundation you you don't have to worry about getting the word of God we've already got the word of God I don't have to worry about it I've already got a Bible thank God I got a Bible they in front of me brother Chris that has the pattern for how I'm supposed to build I just got to look at the pattern amen in our lives everyday lives we just gotta look at the pattern praise God each one of us has got to open up our Bibles pray obey what it says and look at the pattern Hallelujah but the apostles and Prophets they had to go out in the wilderness and get the pattern Paul did we got built we got workers today too praise God we have uh the fivefold ministry right prophets Apostles we have evangelists we have Shepherds pastors we have teachers right which one works on you the most the pastor so maybe I'm like a stone Mason right what does the stonemason do well most cases well you got the big cuts with the lasers right but then if there's small little things you just got to sand it down sanding right so what do I do every service I try to let God preach so you can be sanded down all your rough places can get smoothed off so you don't poke each other so I don't poke you right sand it down right it's a stone Mason God's gotta and church how does he do he's got to Humble us sometimes humble us after weeks and weeks and months and months and years and year just years and years just getting into the right spot remember Michelangelo he'd work on those sculptures for years for years just I mean it looks just lifelike but it took years to do that that wasn't just a one moment one day work that wasn't a one day project it's going to take years for us to come into the the real image God has for this portion of the body of Jesus Christ but I'm glad he's shaping us praise God I'm glad you that we're letting the word continually shape Our Lives Hallelujah I love it we have Elders we have deacons right we have Elders like uh William and Beatrice Elders been the church a long time there's a preacher Elder but then there's just Elders they've just been the message a long time they give us a lot of wisdom then church then you have then you have outside of the preachers you have all the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit everybody has a gift everybody has a Ministry everybody has something they're building everybody's working for the kingdom of God how many working for Jesus Kingdom yeah you're working that's why you're sitting here you're God's workmanship and you're here working and you're building the Temple of God and as First Corinthians 3 said let every man take heed how he builds upon this Foundation praise God so church can we see it can we see that we are a body fitly framed together God put us together because he knew we'd work the best together some of us God had to send 5 000 miles to fit in the right place right for my wife and I God had to send us 170 miles to fit in the right place we were not a fit in the other church over there on the other side of the state we might have got cut out there but God had to send us over here so brother Austin and Lena you were some pretty good stones but Arizona wasn't the spot we were going to fit God had to send you over here just like all those all those Cedars all those stones all those gems they come from all around that world at their own time and they all came in the spot where they could be in the perfect position where we would we would fit together there's my hour we'd fit together as a habitation of the Holy Spirit in other words I'm trusting in you to be in the right place so the spirit of God can fall you're trusting in me to be in the right position so the spirit of God can live here right and what keeps it out our sins so we just have to confess our sins right go on with God let God help us grow pray receive his word and God will build this body into the church it's supposed to be we will we will see we will see where our position is in the entire building of God that that I'll just use the pyramid we'll see our position on that top row right before the headstone we'll see where God placed us and church within the next few years we'll see too In Our Lifetime we'll see how close we are to the top two right but there's going to be a church that is the last Church before Jesus comes what if it's us then we have to submit to all the sanding down right we got to submit to all the the smoothing out of our Lives praise God getting out all the arguing we might not argue with one another but how about when we argue with doing the will of God we argue in our minds how about that argument we could get rid of we could get rid of that praise God Hallelujah like brother Ram said God is cutting out everywhere Born Again children of God going to bring them together I may not live to see it but I hope I do church I hope I live to see it don't you there's coming a ladder rain that final anointing the final Reign before the Harvest praise God there's coming forth where the the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride praise God praise God but we got to be ready when that when that that rain falls praise God we've got to be ready and we'll take our position I hope I live to see it praise God but if I'm not I'm going to keep sanding Stones I'm going to keep preaching to God's Stones so we'll fit together perfectly and we'll take our position in the building of God let's stand on our feet musicians you can come praise God I just play that song flow through me holy spirit because that's what this thought is about so hope you can see it tonight church that you are a part of God's Building God is building a pyramid-shaped body of Christ Hallelujah and you are part of that body you're part of that building and God wants to inhabit that body God wants to anoint your life do you remember that song flow through me Holy Spirit go and play it but also this might be a good time for you to share that testimony but can you come up here and share the testimony because what brother what you were praying it just came to me what you were praying was let this room be a habitation of the Holy Spirit right so why don't you step right here [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign so I thought that was very fitting you know to this this lesson tonight this this word of God that we are the habitation of the Holy Spirit I'll just share Naomi's testimony when we had our Christmas Eve service that was canceled because of snow sister only said to her and her mom
