the songs I do sing once in a while I may take off singing for it's over with tonight so if you're turning we greet you in the name of Jesus Christ it'd be good to be here a man and God group God is a great God a man a man turn your Bibles to 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 and we'll begin reading in verse 1 find your place we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain for he saith I have heard thee in a time accepted in the day of salvation I have suckered thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation giving no offense and anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God in must patience in afflictions and necessities in de-stresses in strives imprisonments in tumults and Labor's in watchings and fastening and pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand on the left my honor and dishonor my evil report and good report as deceivers yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing all you may be seated may God add his blessings to the reading of his word it's kind of been on my mind to preach this for a couple weeks I can just put a title to this and maybe this little group here we can get an understanding dwelling and Canaan land dwelling in Canaan land but first of all we see were Paul said beseech you you know the word beseech you what it means call you to one side to teach you you know I believe we've been called to one side in this age and been taught by a prophetic message God came forth and give us a message that taught us helped bring us out of darkness give us an understanding the right understanding and he's called us to one he summoned us Paul said I summon you I summon you to come together that I might teach you but the we saw it said but vain some are vain that means empty devoid of truth coming without the gift one who boast of faith yet without the fruits of faith you know James 2:26 says for as the body without the Spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also James 2:22 says see us now has faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect a man that means complete brought it to pass because of Abraham's faith he believed God and came that promise child just as he was no matter what came against him he still believed by faith that's why we're the children by faith of Abraham Abraham see you know Abraham had three sons Isaac Ishmael and Christ we are their spiritual children of Abraham we're not children of the bondwoman see there's a natural scene which is Israel and there's a spiritual sea which is the children of God a Gentile church called out of the world now then we see in 2nd green 6 7 with love unfeigned unfeigned without hypocrisy but yet possessing all things Paul could say that he was he was called everything you can think of everything he went through all this condemned the made him look like he was the wrong person but with all that he knew he was right now we're gonna see some things now some something made just to help you and encourage you now faith now we're talking about dwelling in Canaan land we're going to get to Canaan land in a little bit we realize what Canaan land is now faith must have the right atmosphere to bear its fruits the right atmosphere it's got to have the right we're little creators creating atmosphere every day we create an atmosphere we're creating an atmosphere that that's seed that you plant and the seed that you water the seed that you watch over might bring forth fly and they bring forth life in that right atmosphere now we know that you know I like what brother Ibrahim said in the hidden life he said notice now if refresh from the presence of Lord something about something about real Christians that you love to be around don't you do it and there's a power there after I get to know a little better I won't tell you some things that I know that's happened you create your own atmosphere around you believe that you create and atmosphere he begin to tell the story about the maniac in Portland Oregon you know he came after me you know that man did already not another guy somebody out he and he was coming into the service to attack the prophet of God you know you didn't know what he was going to do to him but he said you know what said I love the man I loved him he created an atmosphere no matter what I love the man and I remember you you will fall at my feet and I remember what the Prophet said he said they said is he delivered no he's not delivered just get him off my feet I know he is not delivered why because he loves that spirit but if you can create the right atmosphere maybe some of these will foot stop liking that spirit that turned whirling in because they see the spirit that is in you a man now you know we've had a token in this day you know when the children of Israel were n go in the death angel was coming through they were told to apply a token and the lentils and the doorpost brother Branham said it made a perfect cross pointing to the Messiah that was to come you know and that it if I see the blood I'll pass over and did everybody in I just love it when the head of the house was there standing everything you know had the raw herbs and all this and the children said daddy what's happening daddy are you sure we're are you sure world K and Paul book could say yes the it's on the door that's what I say papa is everything okay today am i all right it's checking up time and he said yes yes son I'm papa God and the blood is on the doorpost of your heart but that blood was the chemistry a blood of a bull and gold animals don't have a soul some people think they do they think that a little dog goes bow wow wow and he's the smartest little thing - and some of them are smart now but they ain't got no stow it's all by instinct I don't care what you say they ain't got no soul and that in that animal's life when they took the light when the blood was shed that was just the chemistry there was no soul in the worshiper when he would come and all for the sacrifice even when Aaron went into the holy place once a year to offer the sacrifice they were forgiven of their sins but they still had they couldn't get greater guilt and say probably next year they did the same thing in the next year they did the same they come and get over because why because that blood had no life but there was a blood sale that was broke at Calvary and it relief bill a resident released gone what was the blood sale in Jesus Christ it was gone without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels and preached up in the glory hey man that's the Chokin life the token life you know the Chokin places of barriers for the man said it's a barrier and a Satan if you've got to how do you get to talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost not speaking in tongues that might happen these are the things that the gifts of the Spirit but that's not the evidence it's receiving that word for your age and and it's it's God I lost my track of my fault there for a minute it's been a long day amen we're gonna get back to in a minute but see what happened that blood had no life but on the day of Pentecost that life came back and filled the believers but that token is a barrier brother branham sense a barrier in him Satan a baptism of the Holy Ghost now you're sealed to your day of redemption if the devil tries to put something on you it's a barrier tries to put sickness on you tries to put that on you you just say I don't want that I don't have to take that I don't want it when I let's tease I'm getting ready to celebrate my anniversary two of them in December December 30th is my wedding anniversary we'd be married 51 years and but December 12 is the day that I I think I died in the hospital room and that's my anniversary there but God give me another opportunity to stay on the firing line the stay on the firing line and I can't get away from bad I couldn't pray for myself my wife oh she could say key key key but the token knife was there he was not finished with me if he was I'd be gone it's a barrier it's a barrier it's also turn me to Psalms chapter 147 I'm just gonna preach as I feel led right now Psalm 147 of this and verse 13 the Bible says for he has strengthened the bars of thy gates he had blessed thy within thee he make it peace in thy borders say borders Holy Ghost puts up borders and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat a man we've got the finest of the wheat I found that in the Philippines they got about three or four different rice the best rice next rice next rice next right the other rice they've got a lot of holes or something in it but he give us the finest of the wheat he send it forth his commandment upon earth and his word run it very swiftly now we think we think well is he ever gonna answer my prayer and once you know the Bible says his word running amen amen amen his word run it very sweet the borders what is it a border it's a territory you know you may think I'm a little bit crazy but I am glad that I was raised in a Southern Baptist home I had a strict father and mother but my daddy was strict I mean we didn't there was no car planned nothing like that no dancing if I was in school and they they were had square dancing in school if they found out that you tried to make me do square dancing they'd have this guy with a flat top six foot two weight 220 pounds he'd been there right away his face right in their face it's right amen I'm Anna I I had friends of smoked and and my daddy ever said you know he's slow he's smoked eyes I was raised Southern Baptist Church with a deacon smoked but my daddy hated smoking he quit smoking there world war two and you know that's another thing you know one reason why I love the Philippines so much my daddy during World War Two was in France and when it ended there they sent him to the Philippines I've got pictures him riding a care about with him little old brown skin kids he was an old farm boy and I figured he must have loved the Philippines and I was in in law I was in my father's lon I can't help from loving the Philippines that's right I'm not gonna take too much time I got time Dona listen listen you don't think it's important what you teach your children I've told this story I'm you may have heard this story before but I kind of loosens me up a little bit I was probably about 15 years old something like that and my friends were smoking cigarettes you know and and I thought I was a big guy and so my house my house was right here and a road went thattaway and a road went thattaway and I would walk down the road and go to the left and light me up one and I start coughing and hacking like crazy and I thought man I'm getting ready what ready I'm getting away with murder everybody know what a complex is or a trauma somebody gets head with the trauma and they can't remember what happened well I woke up one Sunday morning at the Randolph home if you didn't get up to go to church you got cold water poured on your face I think that morning I probably had cold water poured on my face and I got up at the bed and and I got my shirt hanging on the post of the bed and put my shirt and pants on and went out I could still remember my sister standing there and my dad standing there and I dropped something on the floor and I bent over I forgot I had a couple cigarettes in my pocket and those cigarettes fell out right in front of my dad God have mercy I don't remember a thing that happened after that that's the truth I don't remember and I'm glad I don't remember it was such a trauma because I I might have been 15 or 16 but I got that old nasty old leather belt again like I got many times like brother Brennan said I thank God for the old wood shed and I thank God for the old nasty leather belt that would be laying on the dining room table and every Sunday morning that old belt would be and the tithing envelope would be there did you know when I was a little boy and had a paper route I paid tithes off my paper route money and all the boys couldn't understand why I always be up on the corner market triple-t drinking coca-cola and eating candy bars all the time cause god bless me but if you strengthen the bars and the finest sweet is within those borders there's nothing impossible with God and there's nothing impossible with God there's nothing impossible with you hey man sets up boundaries Paul said I go bound in the spirit in Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there he said be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of his prisoner that's why I'm a prisoner of love a slave to the master I willingly toil through the heat and the cold I seek no reward in this world below but a pay day will come when the pearly gates I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ and if sometimes we do things that we don't even can't help ourselves we have to because we go bound bound by the Spirit of the Living God the token message Israel coming out of Egypt was a type of the anti-type today Egypt were the church and Israel represented the bride and is Israel come out of Egypt so does the bride comes out of the church because there has to be something there for it to come out of and has got to come out of it so it was a type the church is in Egypt in the world in sin and does not tear a tinker about your token they don't believe it but Israel loved it for it was salvation to them it was salvation see say I believe this I go believe I believe the messy that's alright that's good but you must have the token do you hear Branham Tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all you're believing is in vain you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church and try to live right that's fine but that's not it multitudes go to church you have family that goes to church but that's not it it's the token line it's the seal of God Green not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed sealed to the day of redemption hey man now death I don't believe could enter into the borders of your token I know natural death but not a spiritual death yes yes then enter there when we have a need we go to him we apply our token because in him is no death no worry no sin no sickness and if Satan tries to put something on you just take your token and apply it that you're a purchased product of Jesus Christ the token stands that you for you speaks for you fight your battles and wins the victory stand still and no tariffs you ever read the Old Testament the battles that was fault God fought their battles Uslan the enemy's army was so confused they discontinued it battle after battle stand still and know that I am God he's God is and nothing's impossible nothing's impossible now I think it's come to a time I just share this we go bound in the spirit some people they think I keep going back to the Philippines and I say you know a lot of people go to the Philippines I mean in America they go you can go on Facebook big meetings in Manila they're there but I thank God that there was a brother came Danny del mundo he's from tala in the Philippines Cala was the leper colony he's got a nice big church and he came to the house of faith and cuz I kept telling brother zebra did I go places hey nobody goes well everybody gonna say that you know but he came and while he was preaching he said brother Keith goes to places that I would can't go and I wouldn't go too far for me to go he goes to places far places why bound in the spirit bound in the spirit you talk about your theophany body I heard the singing we've not yet entered into that word form body theophany body but we came here we bypassed our theophany we came here to be tested with the word to see what we would do with the word you know yes but when you get my age you even get more looking forward to that's theophany body young people here maybe cannot quite comprehend that amen no more bad knees you know no more off right it's in the feet you pray for the brother that came brother Frank Ward came over the last time he's got arthritis as a knees and he's having trouble walking I just talked to him by messenger but that's what happens when you get older so you got something look forward to one day one day I want you to know I heard from a theophany that's right Amen I believe when I received the Holy Ghost I heard from my feet often II and he said he said Keith you know I thought to myself when that happened to me in the hospital room I told my wife I was standing next to her not in the bed I thought I wished I had a mirror cut off so I could have seen what I look like my my MA whew what a glorious thing to look forward to but we came here to see what we would do with the world would we believe the word for this hour where we submit ourselves to every word of God we commit our life to Jesus Christ without reservation believing the whole word of God you must believe the whole Word of God I just had a I had a brother Rodell Mendel ndon I always called him my adopted son he actually would have been 54 the 23rd of December very very close I remember when I first met him summer camp 1994 was on top of the mountain gold Creek which is an abandoned gold quarry use run by Americans and you go you go up this abandoned gold quarry I remember the first time I ever went there and I said where's the church he's up on top of that mountain ain't no Road you've got to walk up the top of that mountain and I remembered I was a lot younger then but my traveling companion brother dinner took me up the wrong path and I remember when I got to the top I was crawling on all fours and I looked up and there was this guy with this big grin on his face it was brother Rodale I'll always remember that but he just died December about a week ago last Friday had a heart attack and stroke and in comatose it's just a shock healthy I thought but I thought no more pain for him he's an it's the off anybody he's there he's there with the Saints even fellowship with my brother branham I'm sure the Saints of old but he's got a wife he didn't get married to his about 42 years old he's got a wife and five little kids left behind I said my what does this happen why does it happen but it happened but we got a reunion coming someday but you must have the token you must have the token now Israel slain lamb was a token but there was no life in that blood but when that blood cell was broke at Calvary oh my I said it before most sating in when it was broken Calvary it released God and it came back jesus said I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore he went down into hail his trip Satan of the keys of death and hail threat to his side and said I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore victorious for a death hell and the grave in that blood shall never lose its power it shall never lose its power because in that blood was the life of God my thank God that I've received that life justify repentance being sanctified that's good but receiving the life of God through the baptismal not not not necessarily the way the Pentecostal they were right in their age the Baptist's were right in their age the Lutheran's were right in their age the Westlands were right in their age but we went further where did we went further we are now in the right age turn with me to Jeremiah chapter 31 in verse 16 I love this thus saith the Lord I love that reframe thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy works shall be rewarded saith the Lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy and there is hope in thine end saith the Lord that thy children shall come again to their own border amen amen amen they if you train up a child in a way you should go when he old will not depart from it see brother Branham said Canaan questions and answers in 1959 Canaan is not the type of the millennium because they had Wars Fighting's killings and everything else in Canaan type the Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is a type of the world that take em out of the wilderness is where they were sanctified see they had no rights and Canaan they had no rights while they were justified they had no rights well they were sanctified a called out Church Cain is is where they settled down with the Holy Spirit because they still had wars and if you don't believe you have wars just get the holy spirit once hey man what are you doing what did they do in Canaan were possessing their rights glory they were possessing their rights and they could not possess the rights till they got into Canaan they didn't own nothing in the wilderness when they come into Canaan then they had rights and we've got rights when you receive the Holy Ghost you're in Canaan but you have to fight for every inch of ground you have to fight for it that's the reason people say brother Branham you pray for me today get over into Canaan once brother and you realize you belong see just tell that's what you know I always like I was like I don't know I think I'll repeat it sometimes my wife says you tell stories over and over and over because I can't remember from one service to the next what I told the last service well the random did the same thing so I'm in good company you know yes so you know it's like Luther I know I believe Luther had the Holy Ghost yes under justification because he the hath not the Spirit of Christ that's none of his and loser I had trouble sleeping and sometimes I still do sometimes I get up at 1:30 2:30 because of my aching feet and legs I don't get up because I want to get it but you know Luther was a German monk of course German monk stand didn't have wives and he started to after he came out under the work of justification he came out and had like a he was uniting priests and nuns together because the nuns were coming out and the priest was coming out he was having you might say Facebook young people getting together and that's right that's what happened and finally anybody thought Luther you gonna get married so he met this ex nun named Katie Katie and he tried to get her married off and Katie said I'll either marry you or this other brother so they got married but you know what he said the devil sleeps closer in bed to me than my wife Katie and the devil gives me more torment than my wife gives me joy that's right you know there's a in Wittenberg there is a Inkspot still on the ceiling where Luther was studying had a temper like a buzz saw and I said that Inkspot up there it's what he was studying and he said the Devils are up in the attic eating hazelnuts and he got mad and threw that inkwell up there they've they've kept that spot far as I know it's still there but he said Luther said I found a secret my daughter gave me the book when I read about quite a book quite a few books on Luther and she she got she got this book for me I think maybe a garage sale he said I found a secret yes the devil is an exalted creature I just turned and looked to the devil until the devil devil you're gonna be in the lake of fire and you will cease to exist and he would tell him that because he said he's an exalted creature and he said the devil would leave resist the devil and he shall flee amen that's what we still gotta do I found you know what I found out it works I mean he just and sometimes I forget all about it and have to remind myself these little secrets from the church age messengers from the past I'd rather read about them and all these newfangled preachers of the day with their charismatic moves and all this they're coming when we presented token with our prayers it shows that you have come to obedience to the whole Word of God it shows that you obey every word and you and the word are one well the Brennan said he only recognizes the token that is the message of the hour that is the message of the day this is the message he only recognizes the token
