[44:31] Romans 5 verse 6 Romans 5 verse 6 Romans
[44:45] 5 verse 6 glory for when we were yet
[44:51] without strength in due time Christ died
[44:55] for the ungodly for scarcely for a
[45:00] righteous man will one die yet
[45:02] peradventure for a good man some would
[45:05] even dare to die but God commended
[45:10] commendeth his love toward us in that
[45:13] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[45:17] for us
[45:18] much more than being now justified by
[45:21] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[45:24] through him Amen what a promise amen
[45:27] for if when we were enemies we were
[45:30] reconciled to God by what our own good
[45:33] merit no by the death of his son Amen
[45:37] Jesus Christ death reconciled us to God
[45:41] much more being reconciled we shall be
[45:45] saved by his life amen
[45:48] but not only so but we also joy in God
[45:52] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom
[45:55] now we have received the atonement amen
[46:00] I think I'll just pause right there
[46:01] there's a whole lot in this passage but
[46:05] the point I want to bring out was just
[46:08] verse 8 God commendeth his love toward
[46:11] us that means to prove to someone
[46:14] commandeth means to prove so God proved
[46:17] his love to you and I in that while we
[46:21] were sinners Christ died
[46:23] for us amen and then the Bible said he
[46:27] justified us by his blood so when we
[46:29] believe in Jesus Christ and accepted him
[46:31] he justified us he declared us righteous
[46:35] we're believers and his Christ took our
[46:39] sin upon him and now we take on his
[46:42] righteousness amen and because of that
[46:45] we are saved from the wrath of God
[46:48] through Jesus Christ what a blessing
[46:52] amen
[46:53] we were enemies to God but now we're
[46:56] reconciled by the death of Jesus Christ
[47:00] praise God and we're supposed to have
[47:03] joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:06] amen
[47:07] we're to have joy this morning you have
[47:09] joy amen in your heart joy in God
[47:11] through our Lord Jesus Christ because we
[47:13] have received the atonement amen
[47:16] and that means we are made one with God
[47:19] that means there are no more sins
[47:21] against us remember the day of atonement
[47:23] in Leviticus 16 they all the believers
[47:26] could walk out of that fellowship on
[47:28] that Sabbath day they can all walk out
[47:30] and say my sins are gone you ask me why
[47:33] I'm happy I'll just tell you why because
[47:35] my sins are gone amen this is the one
[47:38] day of the year that we can clearly and
[47:41] proudly and thankfully and graciously
[47:43] proclaim all my sins are gone amen
[47:47] and now that not only do they could they
[47:49] declare it they could actually see it
[47:50] they could see the air and you know have
[47:54] an escort you know to take the the goat
[47:56] as far away out of the canvas possible
[47:59] and then push him off a cliff and then
[48:02] and say that that our sins are gone away
[48:04] our sins have been sent away amen
[48:06] we have received the atonement have you
[48:09] received God's a told me this morning
[48:11] amen
[48:12] that you know you're one with God amen
[48:14] the Bible said when you're truly
[48:16] justified you have peace with God
[48:19] through our Lord Jesus Christ we do not
[48:21] have war with God we have peace with God
[48:24] amen
[48:25] now our reason this meant so much to me
[48:27] and ties in with this message is because
[48:30] yesterday as I said we were at the
[48:31] hospital I just went by myself I mean
[48:34] here my friend and I
[48:36] and he said one of the reasons he didn't
[48:38] contact me back was because he saw
[48:41] people in the church used me and he
[48:43] named a certain name and I'm not going
[48:44] to call names but he just said brother
[48:47] Jesse I said I'd saw this beat this
[48:49] person kept using you and I got angry
[48:51] and mad and and I didn't want to I
[48:53] didn't want to let's watch any more
[48:55] sermons I don't want to text you back
[48:56] because you were just getting used the
[48:58] whole time and I said brother I said I
[49:01] don't know if I was used the whole time
[49:03] because I felt sincerity in different
[49:05] individuals you know you feel in
[49:07] sincerity at times right you know you
[49:08] try to help people and and you you and I
[49:11] can sense right we can feel that people
[49:12] are being sincere or not right we can
[49:14] sense it and so I said times I said
[49:16] sincerity but but I think sometimes I
[49:18] was being used but I just looked at him
[49:21] and I started crying because I started
[49:23] thinking of this scripture and I and and
[49:26] I thought of how Jesus and I said that's
[49:28] brother I said Jesus Christ died and
[49:32] rose for us and the and I said Jesus
[49:35] Christ the Bible says that the rain
[49:38] falls on the just and the unjust and I
[49:41] said I look out that window I said look
[49:42] at that that Sun came up this morning
[49:44] and that sun is shining on all the
[49:46] people who blaspheme Jesus's name that
[49:50] Sun is providing food it's going to the
[49:52] the crops that are going to produce corn
[49:55] and beans and soybeans and all the food
[49:57] that people are going to eat this fall
[49:59] they're going to enjoy their summer corn
[50:02] on the cob you know sinners but God lets
[50:05] it come up anyway because God is
[50:07] merciful and he started crying he said
[50:11] that changed my mind he said you really
[50:12] said something there Jesse and I said
[50:15] well is this the Holy Spirit but he just
[50:18] couldn't stand seeing someone used and
[50:21] it just made him mad and so he said he
[50:23] couldn't come to church he couldn't you
[50:24] know watch church and and I said I said
[50:27] that's I said I don't mind being used
[50:30] because I know how much God loves me I
[50:33] know God loves sinners and how much more
[50:36] of God loves sinners how much more did
[50:38] he love me praise God where we love God
[50:41] and we try to serve God how much more
[50:43] does he love you and I Amen because he
[50:47] loves his children and
[50:49] so that just struck me yesterday because
[50:51] God is so gracious and remember Jesus
[50:55] said these words in Matthew chapter 5 so
[50:58] I'm went from Romans 5 to Matthew 5 in
[51:03] verse 38 you've heard that it hath been
[51:05] said an eye for an eye a tooth for a
[51:06] tooth but I say unto you that ye resist
[51:09] not evil but whosoever shall smite thee
[51:11] on the right cheek turn to him the other
[51:13] also so Jesus tells us we there's times
[51:17] we're supposed to take physical pain and
[51:19] turn the other cheek
[51:21] for the sake of Christ verse 40 and if
[51:26] any man will sue thee at the law and
[51:28] take away thy coat let him have thy
[51:30] cloak also and whosoever shall compel
[51:35] thee to go a mile go with him Twain
[51:37] oh my give to him that asketh thee and
[51:42] from him that would borrow of thee turn
[51:43] not thou away you have heard that have
[51:47] been said thou shalt love thy neighbour
[51:49] and hate thine enemy but I say and you
[51:52] love your enemies bless them that curse
[51:54] you do good to them that hate you and
[51:57] pray for them which despitefully use you
[52:00] and persecute you and I was telling the
[52:04] brother I said how can how can we how
[52:08] can we pray for someone that uses if we
[52:10] never let ourselves be used I tell you
[52:13] what church it takes a real humble
[52:15] person to be used by somebody else on
[52:18] purpose I know you and I it's difficult
[52:22] someone's to asking things from us to
[52:23] ask in our time our money our resources
[52:26] they're asking our energy and we know
[52:29] they only want it for selfish motives
[52:31] and yet if we give it anyway then we
[52:34] have expressed the love of God to that
[52:36] individual amen if you and I can do this
[52:40] if we can exfolia spresso our love like
[52:42] this then verse 45 tells us that ye may
[52:46] be the children of your father in heaven
[52:48] you know you're a true child of God when
[52:50] you go an extra mile for someone right
[52:53] when you give someone something extra
[52:56] and they're just keep taking from you
[52:58] and and they don't deserve it oh this
[53:01] person doesn't deserve my help this
[53:03] person
[53:03] doesn't deserve my forgiveness this
[53:05] person doesn't deserve it well that's
[53:07] just the wrong attitude everybody
[53:09] deserves it Amen let God be the judge of
[53:11] who deserves it and who doesn't amen are
[53:14] you with me we're so quick to judge and
[53:16] yeah we shouldn't the Bible says we
[53:18] should grow and love and abound in
[53:19] judgment but member Jesus told the
[53:22] Pharisees he said you've done the little
[53:25] things but you've left off the major
[53:26] things which are mercy and judgment amen
[53:30] mercy having mercy upon others so that's
[53:33] what I told the brother I said I don't
[53:34] mind to be used in fact I sometimes I
[53:38] enjoy being used
[53:39] because I know that makes me a child of
[53:42] God amen
[53:43] because that's exactly what Jesus says
[53:46] it doesn't bother me because I know
[53:48] that's what God does every single day of
[53:51] every hour of every year God is
[53:55] constantly giving giving giving and
[53:58] people are just not caring they're not
[54:00] thanking him but yet he gives anyway and
[54:02] no doubt God loves a cheerful Giver Amen
[54:05] God asks us what to give a few times a
[54:08] week maybe right does God ask you to
[54:12] give to the poor maybe once a week once
[54:13] once a month and we wonder well should I
[54:16] give or not you know but yet God is
[54:18] constantly giving every second of every
[54:21] single day amen he never stops he's just
[54:24] a giver he's just a constant Giver
[54:28] he's a this fountain of life just
[54:31] flowing and constantly giving life when
[54:34] people don't we'd say deserve it from
[54:36] our standards oh my that you may be the
[54:40] children of your father which is in
[54:41] heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on
[54:43] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[54:47] rain on the just and on the unjust for
[54:52] if you love them which love you what
[54:53] reward have ye do not even the publicans
[54:57] the same and if you salute your brethren
[55:00] only what do ye more than others do not
[55:03] even the publicans so be ye therefore
[55:07] perfect even as your father which is in
[55:11] heaven is perfect how do you want to be
[55:13] perfect in the love of God perfect which
[55:15] means complete forgiven now
[55:18] you have the complete character of
[55:20] Christ expressing through your life
[55:22] that's perfection and Jesus shows this
[55:25] is the way to do it
[55:26] let yourself be used give at times when
[55:29] it's not easy to give give extra when
[55:32] you don't feel like giving extra
[55:34] highlight here yeah amen
[55:36] I'll say praise the Lord hallelujah so
[55:40] see God proves his love and that's what
[55:42] I told the brother I ended by saying
[55:43] this I said God doesn't have to show me
[55:47] any more love than what he's already
[55:49] showed me and I'll still love him the
[55:51] rest of my life amen
[55:53] you could stop showing me love he could
[55:55] let me go through trials and tests like
[55:57] job he could allow me to go and God
[56:00] really don't have to show me any more
[56:01] love because the Bible said he proved
[56:04] his love to all of us when we were
[56:06] sinners Christ died for you and I amen
[56:09] we know he loves us why because Jesus
[56:13] Christ died for us and all history at
[56:16] all civilizations have to testify to the
[56:19] fact that he died and rose again hey man
[56:22] it's exactly right I just can't get over
[56:26] this quote I'm gonna read it again I've
[56:27] read it numerous times the cloudy skies
[56:29] and storms of life are no signs of God's
[56:32] disapproval of you well God must be
[56:37] really upset at me because I'm having
[56:38] some cloudy seasons and storms in my
[56:41] life that's not always true remember
[56:43] Jobe it's not always true
[56:45] neither are bright skies and still water
[56:48] signs of his love and approval oh my
[56:51] everything's going good for me be
[56:53] careful that's what happened to the rich
[56:54] young ruler everything got so great he
[56:57] started big in building bigger barns he
[57:00] had to make separate bank accounts on
[57:01] top of his other bank accounts because
[57:03] of all his money and brother BAM said
[57:06] Satan blessed him that's what the sermon
[57:10] leadership 1965 says Satan was blessing
[57:13] him but God allowed it right so see
[57:17] cloudy skies aren't always a sign I did
[57:20] something wrong and neither are bright
[57:21] skies evidence that you did something
[57:23] right his approval of any of us is only
[57:28] in the beloved so in his heart amen
[57:32] in his bosom the only way God approves
[57:34] you and I is if you're in his bosom
[57:37] hallelujah
[57:38] you're in his heart did you know that
[57:40] brother Graham said you have a place in
[57:41] God's heart there is a place in God's
[57:44] heart for every true believer amen
[57:47] and I'm after that heart I'm after that
[57:50] place amen that's what I wanna know
[57:52] where's my place where's my position in
[57:54] the heart of God hallelujah praise God
[57:58] amen well any - God want me to do what
[58:02] does God called me to do
[58:03] I wanna find what God has placed for my
[58:06] life amen
[58:08] his love is elected which he had for us
[58:11] before the foundation of the world
[58:13] does he love us ah yes but how should we
[58:16] know we shall know because he said so so
[58:20] fate just in other words faith in the
[58:22] plain word of God is why how he should
[58:25] know that he loves us Amen just faith
[58:28] because he said so and he manifested
[58:31] that he did love us and brought us to
[58:32] himself and gave us of His Holy Spirit
[58:35] how many ever felt the Holy Spirit how
[58:37] many feel he gave you the Holy Spirit
[58:39] well that should be enough to know that
[58:41] he loves you a man that he died for you
[58:44] and then he let his holy presence come
[58:47] upon you and I Amen that should be
[58:49] enough evidence to show that God loves
[58:52] us he said but how should we know
[58:55] because he gave us a spirit placing us
[58:57] his sons and how shall I prove my love
[59:00] to him this is what I'm working on every
[59:02] day I think you are too
[59:03] how shall I prove my love to him to the
[59:06] Father by believing what he said and by
[59:10] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[59:14] trials that he and his wisdom allows to
[59:18] come to pass and the church said so your
[59:22] way to show love to God is to express
[59:25] joy in the hard times amen we can do
[59:29] that then we are proving to God God I
[59:32] know you're in control I trust you I
[59:34] love you I'm not looking at the cloudy
[59:36] skies or the bright skies I'm looking at
[59:39] the fact that you said you love me and I
[59:42] put all my trust in your hole
[59:44] laughs amen hallelujah your unfailing
[59:47] unending love glory is that a blessing
[59:53] God proved his love to us through Jesus
[59:56] Christ in the cross this is enough for
[59:59] me and because of that because of the
[1:00:02] love of Jesus Christ I give myself
[1:00:03] freely to be used so everyone say use me
[1:00:06] use me that's fine I want to be a vessel
[1:00:10] for God's glory because they use Jesus
[1:00:13] didn't they they sure did
[1:00:15] now let's go it's what I was mentioning
[1:00:17] earlier let's go to Isaiah 49 verse 1
[1:00:20] please Isaiah 49 verse 1 this is what I
[1:00:23] was saying God has a place for you in
[1:00:26] his heart Church and it's in the Word of
[1:00:27] God
[1:00:28] hey man Psalms 49 verse 1 oh I'm so glad
[1:00:36] he's got a place for me praise God he
[1:00:41] says verse 1 listen o eyal's unto me and
[1:00:44] hearken you people from far the LORD
[1:00:47] hath called me from the womb Isaiah from
[1:00:52] the bowels of my mother hath he made
[1:00:55] mention of my name he hath made my mouth
[1:01:00] like a sharp sword in the shadow of his
[1:01:04] hand hath he hit me and made me a
[1:01:07] polished shaft in his quiver he hath
[1:01:11] hidden me there it is right there and he
[1:01:15] said to me thou art my servant o Israel
[1:01:17] in whom I will be glorified how many
[1:01:20] would like that position as a prophet
[1:01:22] you can't help it you are a sharp
[1:01:25] cutting sword to everybody you come in
[1:01:27] contact with Oh Lord why do I gotta cut
[1:01:30] people all the time why do people always
[1:01:31] have to be hurt and offended by what I
[1:01:33] say or what I preach why do people have
[1:01:36] to get discouraged and feel bruh you
[1:01:38] know broke in and and and feel why have
[1:01:41] to do that because that's what God made
[1:01:43] you to be praise God
[1:01:44] amen just like Jeremiah and Jeremiah 1:5
[1:01:48] your God told Jeremiah before you were
[1:01:52] in your mother's womb I ordained you as
[1:01:55] a prophet and I sent you a part of
[1:01:57] for the nation's amen he sanctified him
[1:02:01] already he ordained him this is what he
[1:02:04] was going to be but the point I want to
[1:02:06] bring out is that in his quiver he hath
[1:02:09] hid me praise God so that shows the
[1:02:12] picture of God carrying a quiver as a
[1:02:14] bow hunter and the quiver is a case in
[1:02:17] which arrows are carried as a man as a
[1:02:21] hunter or warrior he only feels secure
[1:02:23] when he has his quiver full of arrows
[1:02:26] and so a man is blessed in proportion to
[1:02:30] the number of his children now that's
[1:02:32] getting into later in the Book of Psalms
[1:02:36] to see there is security and happiness
[1:02:39] according to the Bible when you found
[1:02:42] your place and you know that you have
[1:02:45] your quiver full Amen there's security
[1:02:48] in that you know that your Quivers full
[1:02:51] you know that no matter what enemy comes
[1:02:54] whatever predator comes upon you I'm
[1:02:56] secure because I have plenty of arrows
[1:03:00] in my quiver the Quivers are in their
[1:03:02] place amen glory and I say I said that's
[1:03:06] where I was I was in the very quiver of
[1:03:09] God amen
[1:03:11] and that's our hiding place praise God
[1:03:13] where's your hiding place today I hope
[1:03:15] it's not in movies hope it's not in food
[1:03:18] hope it's not in lust hope it's not in
[1:03:20] money I hope your hiding places in Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ they meant in the quiver of our
[1:03:25] Lord and Savior amen I say I said that's
[1:03:29] my hiding place that's where I go when I
[1:03:33] know I'm in trouble huh I'm and God's
[1:03:35] quiver I'm one of God's arrows
[1:03:38] hallelujah amen that's right now look
[1:03:42] brother BAM says the same thing in
[1:03:44] conference with God in 1960 I don't
[1:03:46] think I've ever preached this when he
[1:03:47] says he's talking about the conference's
[1:03:50] you know the big four conference and the
[1:03:52] Geneva Conference but there's one thing
[1:03:54] for sure you're going to attend this
[1:03:56] last conference he's talking about the
[1:03:58] white throne judgment we're all going to
[1:04:00] attend that conference we're all going
[1:04:03] to be there and we're going to give an
[1:04:04] account for everything we've done and
[1:04:05] when the scripture comes with for us of
[1:04:07] Isaiah though your sins be as scarlet
[1:04:10] then they should be white
[1:04:11] snow come now let us reason together
[1:04:13] saith God what are we going to say at
[1:04:16] that time so in other words brother man
[1:04:17] is saying God is offering to everybody a
[1:04:20] conference today amen right now guys are
[1:04:24] offering a conference and saying come
[1:04:27] unto me and there's anything you need to
[1:04:29] talk over let's talk it over right now
[1:04:31] praise God because today is the day of
[1:04:33] deliverance today is the day of
[1:04:35] salvation amen
[1:04:37] it should not be boiled for another day
[1:04:38] it should be done today hallelujah
[1:04:41] always today he said come let us reason
[1:04:46] together what are we going to say at
[1:04:48] that time we'll say God you never wanted
[1:04:49] to have a conference myth with me but
[1:04:51] brother Branham said God is gonna say I
[1:04:53] did ask you to have a conference I asked
[1:04:55] everyone to come unto me and reason with

[1:05:42] I'm nothing I mean Who am I you know I'm
[1:05:44] just nobody well here's brother Graham's
[1:05:47] answer for that God don't really need me
[1:05:50] he says oh yes he does this is this
[1:05:54] there's a little place in God's heart
[1:05:57] says the song that no one else can take
[1:06:02] that place but you
[1:06:06] speaks to you it's you you're the only
[1:06:08] one that could fulfill that spot in
[1:06:12] God's heart amen he waits for you is
[1:06:18] that beautiful you have a place in God's
[1:06:20] art and he's waiting for all of us he
[1:06:25] wants to talk it over with you he wants
[1:06:27] to have a conference with you come and
[1:06:29] reason together before you to have meet
[1:06:31] before you meet this judgment because
[1:06:33] it's going to be terrible then and you
[1:06:35] can't talk it over then it's too late
[1:06:37] then
[1:06:38] you say but but I'm just a bum look he
[1:06:41] goes two step further he said God
[1:06:42] doesn't really need me and I said I'm
[1:06:44] just a bum
[1:06:46] anybody ever felt that way I'm just
[1:06:48] worthless well there's nothing I can
[1:06:50] really do for God brother Graham has
[1:06:53] another answer program said I don't care
[1:06:55] what you are so you make it as because
[1:06:58] I'm a bum or I'm I'm a castaway I'm to
[1:07:00] the black sheep you know God don't care
[1:07:02] what you are what you think you are
[1:07:05] he said I'm a drunkard I'm I'm an
[1:07:06] immoral woman I've done wrong or I've
[1:07:09] did a preacher wrong I've lived untrue
[1:07:11] to my marriage vows I've done the moral
[1:07:12] things I've drank I've smoked I've
[1:07:14] damned but I've stolen I've lied brother
[1:07:16] have said I don't care what you've done
[1:07:17] God called you to this conference he
[1:07:19] said come let us reason together though
[1:07:22] your sins be like scarlet there'll be
[1:07:24] white as snow if you'll just come to
[1:07:25] talk it over a little bit God said I
[1:07:27] need you a man glory is that not the
[1:07:31] gospel preached or what no matter what
[1:07:34] you've gone through no matter the
[1:07:36] situation you've been through the
[1:07:37] condition you find yourself in oh I'm a
[1:07:40] bum or I'm worthless or I'm I'm rejected
[1:07:42] I'm a failure God says come to me let's
[1:07:45] talk it over let's wipe away any
[1:07:48] condemnation in your heart let's wipe
[1:07:50] away any sin that you may have done and
[1:07:51] let's have a conference and let me make
[1:07:54] you white blue glory at least twice
[1:07:59] jesus said this he said whosoever will
[1:08:02] let him come at least twice let's go to
[1:08:04] mark 833 let's read it again
[1:08:13] today by the grace of God did you know
[1:08:16] that God has a place in his heart just
[1:08:18] for you oh it makes me happy this
[1:08:21] morning I can smile I can have joy amen
[1:08:24] the midst of any trial going through I
[1:08:25] know that there's a place in God's
[1:08:28] quiver that's a place for me
[1:08:33] mark 833 but when he and turned about
[1:08:36] and looked on his disciples he rebuked
[1:08:38] Peter saying get thee behind me Satan
[1:08:40] but all savers not the things that be of
[1:08:41] God but the things that be of men and
[1:08:43] when he called the people unto him and
[1:08:45] his disciples also he said to them
[1:08:46] whosoever will come after me let him
[1:08:49] deny himself take up his cross and
[1:08:51] follow me for whosoever will save his
[1:08:55] life shall lose it but whosoever shall
[1:08:59] lose his life for my sake and the
[1:09:01] Gospels the same shall save it another
[1:09:05] place he said you'll find it how many
[1:09:06] want to find their true life what was I
[1:09:09] truly called for what was my true
[1:09:11] purpose what is the true life I shall be
[1:09:13] living the thing we must know is that
[1:09:15] he's calling whosoever will and always
[1:09:18] we must do is deny ourselves take up a
[1:09:20] bird and take up a cross right and
[1:09:22] slowly follow him you can't run with a
[1:09:25] cross very fast
[1:09:26] I can't run it's a slow learning it's a
[1:09:29] daily process of learning to follow God
[1:09:32] and he said whosoever will that means
[1:09:34] it's for everybody here praise God we
[1:09:37] don't know who it's going to be but
[1:09:39] Jesus Christ said whosoever will
[1:09:41] revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the
[1:09:44] bride say come and let him that heareth
[1:09:47] say come and him that is athirst come
[1:09:51] and whosoever will let him take the
[1:09:54] water of life freely anyone who wants a
[1:09:58] fresh drink of Holy Ghost water can have
[1:10:00] it today glory amen anyone because Jesus
[1:10:05] say is saying come and then all those
[1:10:07] that heard Jesus say come and then
[1:10:09] anyone that's a thirst can say come
[1:10:11] everybody should be saying come let's
[1:10:14] drink of the waters of life let's have
[1:10:17] more of the Holy Spirit our lives let's
[1:10:19] enjoy this fresh water from God amen
[1:10:21] glory so at least twice it's in red
[1:10:26] letters Church
[1:10:27] Jesus Christ says whosoever will let him
[1:10:30] come we can't make excuses law I'm just
[1:10:33] a bum I really I did somebody wrong I've
[1:10:37] lied I've stolen I've smoked I drank
[1:10:39] I've been untrue to my marriage vows all
[1:10:41] these things all these excuses that
[1:10:43] Satan is trying to put before us that's
[1:10:46] what I was telling that gentleman
[1:10:46] yesterday God so much wanted to love you
[1:10:49] that he brought you back from the dead
[1:10:52] it wasn't it's time to go he said he's
[1:10:56] got a new lease on life and he said he
[1:10:58] tried to kill himself because he was
[1:10:59] selfish oh let's not be selfish let's
[1:11:02] think of others amen let's live for
[1:11:05] others as I said on Wednesday I hope
[1:11:07] that bless somebody on Wednesday but the
[1:11:09] reason people are unhappy and many times
[1:11:12] committing suicide is because they're
[1:11:13] living for themselves rather than living
[1:11:16] for others because the Bible said happy
[1:11:18] is the man who has pity on the poor God
[1:11:22] promised you to be happy when you care
[1:11:24] for somebody else we got to stop looking
[1:11:26] at ourselves we got a look at the
[1:11:28] sacrifice right we got a look at Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ he's the one that said I'm passed
[1:11:32] from wrath he's the one that said he
[1:11:34] loved me amen he's the one that said I
[1:11:37] got a place in his quiver hallelujah
[1:11:39] I've got a place as one of his arrows
[1:11:42] I'm one of his is his weapons to use in
[1:11:45] this day against the kingdom of Satan
[1:11:47] I'm glad to be a part of that hallelujah
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:52] now with our title of our message here
[1:11:54] this morning we're looking at how at
[1:11:58] we're supposed to be after the heart of
[1:12:00] God but you and I cannot be after the
[1:12:02] heart of God until God comes after our
[1:12:04] heart because this is what the by
[1:12:11] teaches the Bible said no man can come
[1:12:14] to me except my father draws him first
[1:12:16] see the invitation was whosoever will
[1:12:19] let him come whoever wants to be a
[1:12:20] disciple himself take up a cross take up
[1:12:23] a ministry and follow me take up a
[1:12:27] burden and brother him said this is what
[1:12:29] God did to Abraham in Genesis 15 God
[1:12:32] took Abraham completely out of the
[1:12:34] picture showing he had nothing to do
[1:12:36] with it remember God put Abraham to
[1:12:37] sleep memory put him to sleep
[1:12:40] and then he showed him the furnace of
[1:12:41] fire and the sacrifice and all these
[1:12:44] things we preached how that a while ago
[1:12:45] I'm not refreshed on it but I'm reading
[1:12:47] the quote but then he said God put
[1:12:49] Abraham completely out of the way he put
[1:12:52] him to sleep and said God sought you not
[1:12:55] you seeking God you never did do it
[1:12:58] your nature's wrong you're a pig any
[1:13:01] amens on that you're a pig in the church
[1:13:05] your flesh is appeared can I say like
[1:13:08] that my flesh is a pig nature the flesh
[1:13:11] but not the soul he said you don't know
[1:13:15] any different you're just up he said you
[1:13:17] just live in a pig pen that's all you
[1:13:19] know you love it you drink beer slopping
[1:13:22] around run with the next man's wife and
[1:13:24] doing everything you can to do evil it
[1:13:25] just seems good oh brother whatever have
[1:13:27] it we're having a big time you think
[1:13:29] it's good but God knocks on your heart
[1:13:32] he says that's what changes it not you
[1:13:36] knocking at God God knocks at you Adam
[1:13:39] never not I love this Adam never knocked
[1:13:41] at God's heart praise the Lord oh man
[1:13:45] said I've never knocked at God's heart
[1:13:46] God knocked at Adams heart and you're a
[1:13:49] son of Adam he says amen that's right
[1:13:52] before God could be a son of God again
[1:13:55] God had to knock at his heart before
[1:13:57] Adam could be a son of God God had to
[1:13:59] knock at his heart before you can become
[1:14:01] a son of God God has got to knock at
[1:14:03] your heart oh thank you Jesus is that
[1:14:08] how we all started our walk we were
[1:14:10] running from God trying to do what we
[1:14:12] want to do but God came looking for you
[1:14:14] and I aren't you glad he came looking
[1:14:16] for you Lorie see and God even came to
[1:14:21] us even when our sin was grieving him I
[1:14:24] mean oh the Bible says that
[1:14:25] the Bible says that in Genesis 6 about
[1:14:28] the Giants we read that last week for
[1:14:30] questions and answers
[1:14:31] in verse 5 God saw the wickedness of man
[1:14:33] was great in the earth and that every
[1:14:35] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[1:14:37] was only evil continually
[1:14:39] and it repented the Lord that he made
[1:14:42] men on the earth and it grieved him at
[1:14:44] his heart to see God his heart is
[1:14:48] impacted by our decisions
[1:14:50] right-oh in the days of Noah all the sin
[1:14:53] grieved him because sin grieves a holy
[1:14:56] God but a holy God is able to to look
[1:15:00] beyond that fault and he's able to see
[1:15:02] our need amen and he's able to make a
[1:15:05] way back so we can have fellowship with
[1:15:08] him program said this in the way back
[1:15:10] 1962 the word of the Lord comes to the
[1:15:13] prophet and the Prophet was has to stand
[1:15:15] on the word and when the word is not
[1:15:17] obeyed there's nothing to do but rebuke
[1:15:19] that's all
[1:15:20] so this fella didn't mean to be bad he
[1:15:22] just had to do it because he's not
[1:15:23] governed by his own thoughts
[1:15:24] he was governed by the Spirit of God and
[1:15:27] that's the way we all should be governed
[1:15:29] by the Spirit of God and if we are then
[1:15:32] we see sin it makes us sick I'm gonna
[1:15:36] read that again if we're governed by God
[1:15:38] we just have to see sin and it makes us
[1:15:42] sick to see your phone is probably a
[1:15:46] great blessing to your iPad or your
[1:15:48] computer is probably a blessing to you
[1:15:50] but I promise you if you have that phone
[1:15:51] long enough it's going to be a curse too
[1:15:53] yet sometimes sometimes the phone you
[1:15:56] bought and paid so much for - a good
[1:15:58] phone many times it's gonna make you
[1:16:00] sick
[1:16:01] is that right Church see it ought to if
[1:16:05] you are submitted to God
[1:16:06] anything that is sinful should make us
[1:16:08] said God help us to get sick more often
[1:16:10] spiritually I'm talking about that if we
[1:16:13] see something wrong it should make us
[1:16:16] sick and it should make us turn away
[1:16:18] from it and should make us return to God
[1:16:21] amen if we are submitted to God
[1:16:25] we see sin it makes us sick there's
[1:16:28] something about it it even grieved God's
[1:16:30] heart one time he ever made a man
[1:16:33] because sin was so awful in the earth so
[1:16:35] brother M ties it back to this scripture
[1:16:37] right here
[1:16:38] and always grieves God and we know the
[1:16:41] Bible says in Ephesians 4:30 be sealed
[1:16:43] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost unto
[1:16:45] the day of redemption grieve not the
[1:16:47] Spirit of God so we know this attribute
[1:16:51] continues today it grieves God at his
[1:16:57] heart
[1:16:58] so God feels that when we make the wrong
[1:17:00] decision when we purposely go to evil
[1:17:03] which would be called iniquity when we
[1:17:04] make any transgression it grieves God at
[1:17:08] his heart and we don't want to grieve
[1:17:10] the heart of God we want to please the
[1:17:12] heart of God amen let's look at a few
[1:17:16] scriptures that we know will delight God
[1:17:19] let's go to proverbs 11:1 I've been in
[1:17:22] Proverbs lately and and this week I
[1:17:24] noticed there was four times where
[1:17:25] Solomon said his delight so talks about
[1:17:28] four things that God delights over oh I
[1:17:30] know you want to make God delighted
[1:17:33] don't you you know you don't put a big
[1:17:34] smile on God's face you want to make
[1:17:36] God's heart be joyful right we don't
[1:17:39] want to grieve the heart of God the
[1:17:40] Bible says you can regard of God we want
[1:17:42] to please the heart of God proverbs 11
[1:17:45] verse 1 a false balance is an
[1:17:48] abomination to the Lord but a just
[1:17:50] weight is his delight now just wait I
[1:17:54] had to look this up I didn't quite
[1:17:55] understand what this meant in the Bible
[1:17:58] days they would have a little balance
[1:18:00] and then that's how they make it
[1:18:01] exchanges they would have a certain and
[1:18:03] they use metals and certain metals that
[1:18:05] were kind of common to all the all the
[1:18:09] government's and this is how they would
[1:18:10] weigh out there's so many shekels of
[1:18:12] silver they have to balance it all out
[1:18:14] and so a a just person with a just
[1:18:18] weight would use the right kind of
[1:18:20] metals they would use the metals that
[1:18:23] were established by the government but
[1:18:26] sinners would take stones that weighed
[1:18:29] less than metal and make them the same
[1:18:32] size in the same shape they would make
[1:18:34] all these impersonations of the real
[1:18:37] metals and so that when they would weigh
[1:18:39] out the amounts they would make them
[1:18:41] lighter in other words to gain more of
[1:18:43] their money it's always Satan's always
[1:18:47] impersonating the real true gutshot of
[1:18:49] God isn't he Satan's always
[1:18:51] impersonation you
[1:18:52] make these stones that impersonated the
[1:18:54] true metals that the true weight that
[1:18:57] God wanted them to use and God said I
[1:18:59] hate when people do that it's an
[1:19:01] abomination when there's an
[1:19:03] impersonation of real Christianity amen
[1:19:06] I wanna raise my hands in the house of
[1:19:08] God as a true worship I'm not trying to
[1:19:10] personate somebody else amen
[1:19:13] I want to give to the poor as a true
[1:19:15] expression of the love of Jesus Christ
[1:19:17] in my heart and not as an impersonation
[1:19:20] of trying to be anyone else but I have
[1:19:22] the real genuine nature of the holy
[1:19:24] spirit inside of the Amen I don't want
[1:19:27] to M try to impersonate brother Branham
[1:19:29] or impersonate brother so-and-so or
[1:19:31] sister so-and-so I don't want to try to
[1:19:33] impersonate it I want the person of
[1:19:35] Jesus Christ to live inside of me amen
[1:19:38] so God hates a pur impersonation making
[1:19:43] stones that look just like these metal
[1:19:45] standards of weight God said I'd the law
[1:19:49] right when they follow all the laws of
[1:19:50] the land I delight when they're honest
[1:19:53] and when they have integrity I delight
[1:19:54] in my children who are completely honest
[1:19:56] don't you want to be completely honest
[1:19:57] Oh hallelujah
[1:20:01] remember these were for the young
[1:20:03] children the Proverbs were mainly for
[1:20:04] the young children as Solomon said 24
[1:20:06] times my son my son then he said four
[1:20:09] times my children my children so Israel
[1:20:13] we know had a high standard of integrity
[1:20:17] the people of Israel one of the church
[1:20:20] children to have a high standard of
[1:20:22] integrity amen now go to verse 20
[1:20:28] proverbs 11:20
[1:20:31] the same way proverbs 11
[1:20:38] 20 they that are of a froward that means
[1:20:41] perverse heart froward means perverse so
[1:20:44] it's not going the right way they that
[1:20:46] are of a froward heart are an
[1:20:47] abomination to the Lord but such as her
[1:20:49] upright in their way are his delight God
[1:20:54] is so happy God is so joyful the Bible
[1:20:58] says when we are just when we're fair
[1:21:01] and when we are upright in all of our
[1:21:04] ways everything we do is the best and
[1:21:07] most honest that we can possibly do God
[1:21:11] wants us to be honest Christians how
[1:21:14] many how many sunny God's help to be
[1:21:15] honest all the time I do I do when I was
[1:21:20] a sinner I just I live you know all the
[1:21:21] time you lie and sometimes you know my
[1:21:25] own nature I know this I'm a people
[1:21:28] pleaser
[1:21:28] I don't like contention I don't like
[1:21:30] arguments I don't like debates I don't
[1:21:33] and so sometimes I have to catch my
[1:21:35] flesh I will just go along with people
[1:21:38] just to avoid an argument I noticed that
[1:21:41] in the past and I've got to ask God and
[1:21:44] that would be being dishonest right and
[1:21:48] so I need God's strength to always help
[1:21:51] me to be just fair totally honest with
[1:21:53] everybody by the grace of God and that
[1:21:57] would delight God when completely honest
[1:22:01] with other people honey what that kind
[1:22:03] of honesty amen I do and this will make
[1:22:06] God delighted in your service Oh
[1:22:09] hallelujah let's go to proverbs 12:22
[1:22:18] here's another one this is the third one
[1:22:21] on what God delights in at least in
[1:22:23] Proverbs I trust this will help you this
[1:22:25] week maybe somebody got a deal coming up
[1:22:27] here I hope this will help your deal
[1:22:28] right here look at this deal proverbs
[1:22:30] 12:22 lying lips are an abomination to
[1:22:33] the Lord but they that deal truly are
[1:22:36] his delight oh my brother I'm gonna give
[1:22:40] you this real good deal here and you're
[1:22:41] gonna make a pretty good deal I'm gonna
[1:22:43] get him I'm gonna make your deal but
[1:22:45] you're really not making a good deal
[1:22:47] right that's what people do all the time
[1:22:49] on Craigslist Craigslist and Facebook
[1:22:51] and eBay
[1:22:52] or you're getting a great deal getting a
[1:22:54] great deal and in their hearts they know
[1:22:55] you're not getting a great deal lying
[1:22:58] God hates lying but God delights in
[1:23:01] someone who's completely honest they
[1:23:04] deal truly and then God said that's
[1:23:07] something I delight in as a father
[1:23:09] that's my child I'm so happy
[1:23:12] look at my daughter look how she's deals
[1:23:13] truly with everybody look at my son he's
[1:23:16] honest he's got integrity he's just he's
[1:23:19] fair or I delight in them how do you
[1:23:21] want to make God delighted hey I love to
[1:23:24] make God delighted and then this one
[1:23:26] this is beautiful as well we've preached
[1:23:28] this before proverbs 15:8 proverbs 15:8
[1:23:40] all right this sacrifice of the wicked
[1:23:43] is an abomination to the Lord but the
[1:23:45] prayer of the upright is his delight
[1:23:48] when we can pray an honest prayer and we
[1:23:51] know God has nothing against us right
[1:23:52] and we know we have nothing against our
[1:23:54] brother and sister if we do the best
[1:23:56] thing let's go make it right as soon as
[1:23:58] possible praise the Lord then God
[1:24:02] delights in that type of prayer a prayer
[1:24:05] that is honest a prayer that is just and
[1:24:08] fair amen
[1:24:10] so that's from the Proverbs those are
[1:24:12] four scriptures on his delight from
[1:24:15] Proverbs hope that was a blessing to you
[1:24:16] hope you like that one now let's go to
[1:24:18] Psalms 103 verse eight Psalms 103 verse
[1:24:25] eight
[1:24:35] the Lord is merciful and gracious slow
[1:24:38] to anger and plenteous in mercy you know
[1:24:43] some people would just forget about this
[1:24:45] you know the Bible says he's slow to
[1:24:47] anger now a church if we make a little
[1:24:49] bit let's say we make a little ion
[1:24:51] accident and people get so upset Oh God
[1:24:54] hates me God's he's all upset the Bible
[1:24:56] said he's slow to anger if you keep
[1:24:59] going and don't repent then God's gonna
[1:25:02] get angry with you but one little
[1:25:04] mess-up he's not gonna get so angry and
[1:25:06] throw you into hell he's slow to anger
[1:25:09] amen
[1:25:10] he's plenteous in mercy remember Jesus
[1:25:14] said forgive them seventy times seven in
[1:25:16] one day and then you'll start
[1:25:18] understanding the love of God are you
[1:25:21] grateful for the love of God seventy
[1:25:23] times seven right 490 times in one day
[1:25:27] if I sinned against bang he should be
[1:25:28] able to forgive me 490 times because
[1:25:31] that's the Word of God and each time I
[1:25:34] say I'm sorry brother I didn't mean to
[1:25:35] do that he could say I forgive you and
[1:25:37] he could cheat you try to trust me again
[1:25:39] that's the love of Jesus Christ look at
[1:25:43] verse 9 he will not always chide neither
[1:25:46] will he keep his anger forever he hath
[1:25:48] not dealt with us after our sins nor
[1:25:50] rewarded US according to our iniquities
[1:25:52] for as the heaven is high above the
[1:25:54] earth so great is His mercy toward them
[1:25:57] that fear him amen as far as the East is
[1:26:02] from the west so far hath removed our
[1:26:05] transgressions from us oh I hope you're
[1:26:07] not sitting under the condemnation of
[1:26:09] sin this morning if you are the father
[1:26:12] saying come let's talk about it I will
[1:26:14] separate your sin as far as the East is
[1:26:16] from the West amen
[1:26:18] I'll separate you from your sins as high
[1:26:20] as the heavens are above the earth I'll
[1:26:22] make you white as snow amen this is what
[1:26:25] God our Father offers to us in verse 13
[1:26:29] I love this I preached in 2015 and this
[1:26:31] is the title of my sermon like as a
[1:26:33] father pitieth his children so the Lord
[1:26:36] pities them that fear Him how many
[1:26:40] fathers out there how many fire
[1:26:44] how many fathers pity your children you
[1:26:45] have a lot of compassion not a
[1:26:47] forgiveness a lot of love children do I
[1:26:51] pity you case you Liddy do I pity you
[1:26:53] okay good I didn't tell them I was gonna
[1:26:55] say that either you know I just had a
[1:26:59] little testimony you know one of my
[1:27:00] family members come to visit lately and
[1:27:02] and they said they thanked us they
[1:27:04] thanked our family because they said
[1:27:06] none of your children talk back to us
[1:27:08] and they said all their other children
[1:27:10] that they around their relatives they
[1:27:12] all talk back except our children and so
[1:27:16] what is that that's the grace of God
[1:27:18] that's the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:20] living a sanctified life right living
[1:27:24] that life at home and that's the
[1:27:25] atmosphere that we want the children to
[1:27:27] live in all everyone else in the family
[1:27:29] talks back but not this home why because
[1:27:32] this home is under the atonement of the
[1:27:34] blood amen
[1:27:36] now say like this this church is under
[1:27:38] the atonement of the blood of Jesus
[1:27:40] Christ amen people should look at all
[1:27:42] eyes all of us and say they don't
[1:27:44] complain they're not backbiters they're
[1:27:47] not gossipers they're not angry they're
[1:27:49] not slanderous they're not blasphemous
[1:27:52] they're just sweet Holy Ghost filled
[1:27:54] Christians amen because we're under the
[1:27:56] blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:59] our Lord and Savior under his blood and
[1:28:02] it should be taking a cleansing effect
[1:28:03] on us every single day
[1:28:05] amen because God pities his children
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:09] - pity means it's the Hebrew word
[1:28:11] Rock'em to love deeply to have mercy to
[1:28:18] be compassionate to have tender
[1:28:21] affection oh my just this morning I was
[1:28:24] you know my little baby I was rubbing
[1:28:26] her cheek you know and I could feel that
[1:28:28] soft little peach fuzz hair on her and
[1:28:31] that that's my tender I was trying to
[1:28:34] kiss her on the cheek and say Danny
[1:28:36] loves you you're doing the baby talk I
[1:28:38] love you little baby you know oh you're
[1:28:40] so sweet here my little baby and that's
[1:28:43] is that not to under affection am i
[1:28:45] standoffish like you need to love me you
[1:28:47] need to listen to me tender affection
[1:28:52] that's how God is to us doesn't he come
[1:28:55] that way many times he just
[1:28:57] tenderly brings the message he tenderly
[1:28:59] brings his word and he draws you to fall
[1:29:01] back more in love with him amen tender
[1:29:05] it's tender affection that's how God is
[1:29:08] with us as a father tenth loves deeply
[1:29:13] as children
[1:29:14] so the Lord loves deeply them that fear
[1:29:17] him like I was telling that brother
[1:29:20] yesterday about the denominational
[1:29:22] people he used to be a Jehovah's Witness
[1:29:24] and he said that he said no Jesse I
[1:29:27] don't agree with them any with a lot of
[1:29:29] their things anymore he said but one
[1:29:30] thing I got in that church he said was
[1:29:31] sanctified and I don't know what all
[1:29:35] those OVAs Witnesses believe I know they
[1:29:36] don't believe in supernatural wonders
[1:29:38] and miracles can we when we tell about
[1:29:40] it when they visit our house they just
[1:29:41] take give it to giving me their card and
[1:29:43] leave and I don't have enough time to go
[1:29:45] study out there I don't care really what
[1:29:47] they believe I'm trying to get the
[1:29:49] message out I'm trying to be a pastor
[1:29:50] but the point was he said I was addicted
[1:29:53] to drugs and all these things like that
[1:29:54] he said but God called me that Church
[1:29:56] and because of their preaching they
[1:29:58] preach what we preach like set no evil
[1:30:00] thing before your eyes so he stopped
[1:30:03] doing pornography they preach on other
[1:30:06] things about clinic lenses a cleanly
[1:30:08] life and holy life and he said God used
[1:30:12] them for that and we got talking later
[1:30:15] and said how all the churches I have to
[1:30:17] the Catholic Church are daughters of the
[1:30:19] mother harlot how many know that but I
[1:30:22] said brother don't get me wrong there
[1:30:24] are some good people in there because
[1:30:26] God is going to make one more call back
[1:30:28] the calls going out right now he can
[1:30:30] come out of her my people that you be
[1:30:32] not partakers of her sins and her
[1:30:34] plagues amen that's the call that's
[1:30:36] going out right now come out of
[1:30:39] denomination come out of Catholicism
[1:30:41] come on a Pentecost right of the
[1:30:44] organization come out and Jehovah's
[1:30:46] Witnesses come out of these things and
[1:30:48] come into the real love of Christ
[1:30:50] hallelujah
[1:30:51] yeah amen to be fully formed in the
[1:30:54] image of Christ verse 14 he knows our
[1:30:59] frame he remembers that we are dust
[1:31:01] so God remembers God knows what it's
[1:31:03] like when you wake up tired and you're
[1:31:05] worn out and you don't feel like doing
[1:31:07] anything for the Lord God knows he
[1:31:08] remembers he reno's what you're made of
[1:31:11] he knows you get tired but as a man his
[1:31:13] days are as grass as a flower of the
[1:31:16] field so he flourishes for the wind
[1:31:18] passes over and it is gone and the place
[1:31:20] thereof shall know it no more
[1:31:22] but the mercy of the Lord is from
[1:31:25] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[1:31:28] that fear him and his righteousness unto
[1:31:31] children's children
[1:31:34] hallelujah can you say amen to that
[1:31:36] hallelujah this is God's deep love to us
[1:31:40] it is not a superficial love it's not a
[1:31:43] love that you know he's gonna quickly
[1:31:45] get rid of us it's a deep patient love
[1:31:48] it is the Father's love Amen let's go
[1:31:51] back to Luke 15 where I read our text
[1:31:53] about the prodigal now we know a lot of
[1:32:08] the story here but for the Jew this was
[1:32:10] the lowest of the lowest you could
[1:32:12] possibly be because you're hanging
[1:32:14] around swine and swine were unclean so
[1:32:18] the son is as dirty and as low as he
[1:32:21] could possibly be he could not be in and
[1:32:23] around any more abominable things than a
[1:32:25] swine and here in verse 17 and when he
[1:32:30] came to himself he said how many hired
[1:32:32] servants of my father's have bread
[1:32:35] enough and to spare and I perish with
[1:32:40] hunger so think how good the even the
[1:32:45] servants are being treated he finally
[1:32:48] came to himself well that means at some
[1:32:51] point he must have been himself but when
[1:32:54] he left the father's house he became a
[1:32:56] different person is that right now how
[1:33:01] did he come to what how did he become
[1:33:02] back to himself he came back to the very
[1:33:05] self that the father had build him up to
[1:33:09] as a child I'm you understand what I'm
[1:33:11] saying
[1:33:11] his father had raised in the right way
[1:33:13] his father raised him if you sin like
[1:33:16] this it's a transgression against God
[1:33:18] but if you live this way God will honor
[1:33:21] you right he had been taught by the
[1:33:24] father the father had taught him the
[1:33:27] Word of God that's what I want to
[1:33:28] emphasize today I will rise and go to my
[1:33:31] father and say to him father I've sinned
[1:33:33] against heaven and before thee and no
[1:33:36] more worthy to be called thy son and
[1:33:38] make me as one of the hired servants now
[1:33:42] look at verse 20 and he arose and came
[1:33:45] to his father church there was something
[1:33:48] in this boy that he knew his father
[1:33:51] would receive him hey Alleluia there was
[1:33:55] something that this father placed into
[1:33:57] him when he was before he lost his mind
[1:33:58] before he went head over heels over
[1:34:01] lusts and harlots in' and sin and all
[1:34:03] these things before he went into this
[1:34:05] deep muddy pit he had had this training
[1:34:08] and the father placed it in his heart
[1:34:10] the law of God and he knew the law of
[1:34:13] God and when he finally came to himself
[1:34:15] he had conference the father will
[1:34:18] receive me amen and if he had that
[1:34:20] confidence how much more confidence in
[1:34:22] you and I have in the father's heart
[1:34:24] today
[1:34:24] praise God amen he had have known this
[1:34:28] else he never would have went
[1:34:31] perhaps his father whispered before he
[1:34:33] left he said son you can always come
[1:34:35] home Oh dad ok get next to yourself I'm
[1:34:39] gonna have some fun in my life I'm not
[1:34:40] gonna live on on this plantation my
[1:34:42] whole life I want to go have some vile
[1:34:45] to live my life I want to do what I want
[1:34:47] to do no doubt he knew though that the
[1:34:49] father cared and the father had taught
[1:34:53] him these things that if you want to be
[1:34:55] received
[1:34:56] you just have to humble yourself and say
[1:34:58] I have sinned against heaven and I've
[1:35:01] sinned against you that's where we need
[1:35:03] to be faithful all the time if we've
[1:35:06] sinned against someone we must go to
[1:35:08] them see that the son sinned against his
[1:35:12] father and he said I've got to go tell
[1:35:14] my father that I've sinned against him
[1:35:18] honey no that's one of the hardest
[1:35:20] things to do though to face up to your
[1:35:21] own mistakes how we know that to face
[1:35:24] the person you sinned against how many
[1:35:26] know that's one of the hardest things to
[1:35:27] do it is that's why Jesus said that's
[1:35:30] how you keep a church clean go to them
[1:35:32] face to face but yet he was will
[1:35:36] to do this because the father had placed
[1:35:38] something in his heart where he had
[1:35:40] confidence that he would be received
[1:35:42] amen
[1:35:43] and not church when he arose what is he
[1:35:46] doing now
[1:35:46] now he's going after the father's heart
[1:35:49] hey man that's what I liked about this
[1:35:52] text today
[1:35:53] he knows the father's heart and church
[1:35:56] we know God's heart but we've got to do
[1:35:58] something about it we've got to rise up
[1:36:01] and obey the father and go to the Father
[1:36:04] and do what the father says we've got to
[1:36:07] know that the father will receive us
[1:36:08] we've got to go after the father
[1:36:10] amen Pilate knew you how many love the
[1:36:13] Word of God glory this is where I got
[1:36:16] this thought he's after the Father's
[1:36:18] heart he knows what the father is going
[1:36:21] to say because he was with the father
[1:36:23] and we should know what the father says
[1:36:25] because we were with the Word of God
[1:36:27] hallelujah now what was the father the
[1:36:32] father was just what was he doing the
[1:36:33] whole time he was just trusting I've
[1:36:35] trained my son the whole time I'm not
[1:36:36] going to get upset I raised him to serve
[1:36:39] God I know he'll come back look at the
[1:36:41] confidence that the father has he's my
[1:36:44] son I saw my wife bring him forth I
[1:36:46] raised him I provided for in other words
[1:36:48] the son had a place in his father's
[1:36:50] quiver praise God the son had a place in
[1:36:53] his father's Kingdom in his father's
[1:36:55] home just as God is a place for you and
[1:36:57] I hallelujah amen he had a place in his
[1:37:01] father's quiver he knew it and look he
[1:37:05] goes back and he says and when he was
[1:37:07] yet afar great far away off his father
[1:37:09] song had compassion and ran and fell on
[1:37:12] his neck and kissed him honey no this is
[1:37:15] Jesus talking about how God treats us as
[1:37:18] children Oh
[1:37:20] didn't God run to you Church don't you
[1:37:22] love that song when God ran to me honey
[1:37:25] felt like God ever ran to you and met
[1:37:27] you in your sin he met you on your way
[1:37:29] back to God amen he met you on your way
[1:37:31] back because he was always knowing you
[1:37:33] were going to come back and he can meet
[1:37:35] you today if there's anything keeping
[1:37:37] you from God he can meet you today on
[1:37:39] your way back to the fold of God amen
[1:37:43] exactly right and I like
[1:37:48] look at verse 21 God shows us how he
[1:37:53] treats us he says verse 21 and the son
[1:37:56] said unto him father I've sinned against
[1:37:57] heaven and in thy sight and then no more
[1:37:59] worthy be called thy son now does the
[1:38:02] father scold him and bawl him out you
[1:38:05] unworthy ungrateful son you took half of
[1:38:09] my money and you ought to be sorry you
[1:38:12] piece of trash you know something like
[1:38:13] this at what he says he's so happy he
[1:38:16] stands there's my son he was dead now
[1:38:20] he's alive let's have a celebration amen
[1:38:23] let's call the angels of God and they
[1:38:25] all worship and we'll dance in praise to
[1:38:27] the Lord amen he don't even say and
[1:38:30] rebuke him he sees he's come back and
[1:38:33] God just wants us to come back if we
[1:38:35] left Amen that's all he wants us to do
[1:38:37] you also hear us say the confession and
[1:38:39] then he'll receive us and then the
[1:38:41] angels of God go to rejoicing amen
[1:38:44] that's exactly right Church the father
[1:38:49] had confidence I put those values in him
[1:38:51] he and he knows that I take him back and
[1:38:54] when he 20/20 time he'll come back and
[1:38:58] his heart will turn after my heart
[1:39:01] amen the prodigal was after the heart of
[1:39:05] the father glory
[1:39:07] don't you like that hallelujah he was
[1:39:12] after the heart of his father now let's
[1:39:14] go a little bit further by the grace of
[1:39:16] the Lord I want to go a little bit
[1:39:17] further now let's look at David now
[1:39:20] remember acts 3:20 - lets go they forgot
[1:39:22] I'm sorry 1322 acts 13:22 I just want to
[1:39:30] this thought out here acts 13:22 you and
[1:39:38] I've got to remember that God's not
[1:39:41] tricked by us right God we're not we
[1:39:42] can't trick God with anything God sees
[1:39:45] us at our very core of what we are he
[1:39:48] knows if we're really sincere or if
[1:39:50] we're just going through the motions
[1:39:52] that's why brother Ram said you must be
[1:39:55] more got to him you must be more sincere
[1:39:57] and that's why praying and that's why
[1:40:00] praying and dying out in prayer is so
[1:40:02] important dying out so that you know
[1:40:05] you're absolutely sincere you know
[1:40:07] you're leaving Church different or you
[1:40:08] know I'm finally getting down to
[1:40:10] business with God that's the thing that
[1:40:12] what most people don't do they've got a
[1:40:13] pray until you mean business with God
[1:40:15] amen
[1:40:16] till you know you're more sincere than
[1:40:19] just going through the motions pray from
[1:40:20] your brother Jeff sir pray for me honey
[1:40:22] or pray for me husband or pray for me
[1:40:24] wife just a little go through the
[1:40:25] motions we must be sincere hallelujah
[1:40:28] and if this would God is saying look
[1:40:30] this is not it wasn't David that saying
[1:40:33] look at me I'm a man after God's heart
[1:40:35] it wasn't David saying look at me I'm a
[1:40:38] messenger believer I'm going in the
[1:40:40] rapture it was not David it was God that
[1:40:45] said that God gave the witness God
[1:40:48] called David he's a man after my heart
[1:40:51] you look at the Bible said I have he
[1:40:53] said to whom he gave testimony and said
[1:40:56] I have found David the son of Jesse a
[1:40:59] man after my own heart which shall
[1:41:02] fulfill all my will you know the story
[1:41:05] after Saul felt God went looking for a
[1:41:08] king oh yeah God went looking for a
[1:41:12] faithful man God was looking for someone
[1:41:14] who had a heart after his heart and then
[1:41:18] God testified to Samuel and said I found
[1:41:21] a man whose heart is after Mylar we
[1:41:24] could all say that church we can all try
[1:41:26] to say you know well I'm after the heart
[1:41:28] of God I'm going after the heart of God
[1:41:29] but God knows who's being sincere the
[1:41:32] only one to be sincere church amen amen
[1:41:35] God knows what you're after today what
[1:41:38] are you after today are you after just a
[1:41:40] religious experience are you after more
[1:41:42] of God's Word
[1:41:44] and you want to know God's Word for your
[1:41:46] life
[1:41:47] that's what you see God is the one who's
[1:41:49] gonna vindicate that God shows who's
[1:41:51] really after the heart of God amen glory
[1:41:56] that's exactly right
[1:41:58] this is God's testimony about David just
[1:42:00] like it was God's testimony about job
[1:42:02] job's a perfect man amen it was God
[1:42:06] saying that I were going to say that
[1:42:08] Jesse's a man after my own heart
[1:42:09] but the Lois is a man after my own heart
[1:42:12] and we can put all your names in there
[1:42:14] we want God to testify that our hearts
[1:42:16] are so pure there's one motive we have
[1:42:19] and that's the please God and to find
[1:42:21] our place in God's heart amen hey then
[1:42:26] that's well that's why that was so
[1:42:28] important to me because I didn't ever
[1:42:30] realize that till this morning it was
[1:42:32] God's testimony God was testifying and
[1:42:35] saying hey listen to everybody Saul was
[1:42:37] not after my heart but David is watch
[1:42:39] David David will be after my heart you
[1:42:42] guys wanted a king well I gave you the
[1:42:44] King you wanted but now this time I'm
[1:42:46] choosing I'm going to choose the right
[1:42:47] King amen exactly right look what
[1:42:53] brother Ram says well actually let's
[1:42:57] look at what David said David in Psalm
[1:43:00] chapter 1 said blessed is the man that
[1:43:02] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:43:03] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:43:05] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:43:07] scornful how much time do I got oh my
[1:43:09] whoo I've already had an hour give me an
[1:43:13] hour and 15 I'll just in minutes I'll
[1:43:15] try to finish here okay verse 2 but his
[1:43:18] delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[1:43:22] his law doth he meditate day and night
[1:43:25] see Church we showed you a God delights
[1:43:28] in but now I'm showing you again in a
[1:43:30] rehearsing to you what we should delight
[1:43:32] and we should delight in the word of the
[1:43:34] Lord it should be your delight to read
[1:43:36] your Bible in the morning don't you
[1:43:37] delight to do that it should be your
[1:43:39] delight to hear the word of God preached
[1:43:41] that's what a blessed man or woman is
[1:43:43] someone whose delight is in the law of
[1:43:45] the Lord and all the time they just want
[1:43:47] to meditate about God and His Word and
[1:43:49] think about how great he is and think
[1:43:51] about how God can move in their life hey
[1:43:53] man that's there should be your delight
[1:43:58] the too many people delight and other
[1:44:00] things we got a delight in the law in
[1:44:02] the word of the Lord this has to be our
[1:44:04] delight the word of the Lord that's
[1:44:07] right look at brother BAM said brother
[1:44:09] having said this he said when I was
[1:44:11] younger this is in 1950 he said I didn't
[1:44:14] want to look like no preacher brother
[1:44:17] BAM said a Bible under my arm I thought
[1:44:20] that was a when I walked out today
[1:44:23] to anybody you think oh look at that
[1:44:24] go look at that go to the
[1:44:27] pulpit but RAM said when he first went
[1:44:30] even a sinner he thought oh what a I
[1:44:32] don't want to be a preacher they're just
[1:44:33] a but look what he says but I find
[1:44:37] out friends it takes a real man to be a
[1:44:40] preacher it takes a real man to be a
[1:44:45] Christian amen not just a preacher but
[1:44:47] if this is mother Aaron's battle well I
[1:44:49] don't want to be a preacher sissies are
[1:44:50] preachers God had to change his mind and
[1:44:53] said a real man will stand behind the
[1:44:55] pulpit and preach God's Living Word amen
[1:44:58] like we read last week
[1:45:00] if you can't preach a sermon live a
[1:45:01] sermon amen and what good is my
[1:45:04] preaching if I don't live it but I'm
[1:45:05] living it by the grace of God amen he
[1:45:09] said I want to be a man that was 6-foot
[1:45:10] tall and weighed a hundred and ninety
[1:45:12] pounds that's pretty close to me I'm 170
[1:45:16] I'm about 511 170 so brother band want
[1:45:21] to be as big as me but I'm nothing you

[1:45:27] funny you want to be 6-foot 190 I want
[1:45:30] to be a real man you see but but look
[1:45:32] you can't judge men by the size of their
[1:45:35] stature I see men that weigh 200 pounds
[1:45:37] didn't have an ounce of man man is
[1:45:39] judged by character he said then be a
[1:45:41] man after the heart a man after God's
[1:45:44] heart and God will bless you hallelujah
[1:45:47] pretty simple isn't it be a man for the
[1:45:50] heart of God he said and God will bless
[1:45:52] you the trouble is there's so many
[1:45:55] things were going after got to make sure
[1:45:57] we go after the word of the Lord I
[1:46:00] wonder you know on Wednesdays message I
[1:46:02] wonder did anybody make plans to try to
[1:46:04] find the poor people and your life I
[1:46:07] hope you did see if you are then you're
[1:46:09] trying to go after the word of the Lord
[1:46:11] by God's grace the Lord opened up a
[1:46:13] little thing there I was able to do some
[1:46:14] things but see you we got to take what
[1:46:17] we hear and actually go put it into
[1:46:18] practice we can't come here and just not
[1:46:21] act on it we've got to act upon the Word
[1:46:23] of God I mean oh that's what jeez that's
[1:46:25] what James said only the doers of the
[1:46:28] word are blessed not just hearers but
[1:46:31] the doers we've got to do what we hear
[1:46:35] so if you haven't found somebody poor
[1:46:37] keep praying and find somebody poor got
[1:46:40] to help you out gotta help you do it if
[1:46:41] God help me he can help you do it
[1:46:43] absolutely
[1:46:44] find someone poor who needs clothes or
[1:46:47] water or food or money or help with
[1:46:49] their car or something find somebody
[1:46:51] who's poor help them out by the grace of
[1:46:53] God alright now let's go to 1st samuel
[1:46:59] 1313 a few more scriptures like I said I
[1:47:03] just needed a 15 moments I got about 11
[1:47:04] left I honestly I'll try to be done at
[1:47:06] that time by God's grace Sir Samuel 13
[1:47:09] 13 and Samuel said to Saul Valis done
[1:47:11] foolishly thou has not kept the
[1:47:12] commandment of the LORD thy God which he
[1:47:15] commanded thee for now would the Lord
[1:47:17] have established I came them upon Israel
[1:47:19] forever I love this scripture because
[1:47:21] this is one of those what if scriptures
[1:47:22] what if saw had actually done what God
[1:47:26] told them to do his his family would
[1:47:28] have been Kings forever is that right
[1:47:31] church and this is so important for you
[1:47:34] and I that we don't miss the will of God
[1:47:37] for our life he missed God's will by not
[1:47:40] obeying the Word of God did you know
[1:47:44] that salt wherever he's at I believe
[1:47:46] he's in heaven but Saul may think
[1:47:48] sometime my they've been a lot different
[1:47:50] if I had just obeyed the Word of God now
[1:47:53] Church you and I don't want to be in
[1:47:54] that situation we want to know that we
[1:47:57] know that we know that we did what God
[1:48:00] wanted us to do we want to know that so
[1:48:04] someone could ponder forever
[1:48:06] I wonder what if what would happen if I
[1:48:09] just would have waited for Samuel before
[1:48:10] I sacrifice those animals I wonder what
[1:48:13] could have happened my my son Jonathan
[1:48:15] would have been king are you with me
[1:48:18] church think about that he's forever
[1:48:21] going to be regretting my
[1:48:24] only what it did the Word of God and God
[1:48:26] gave him chance after chance after
[1:48:28] chance and he missed it
[1:48:31] next scripture but now that Kingdom
[1:48:34] shall not continue the LORD hath sought
[1:48:36] him a man after his own heart and the
[1:48:38] LORD hath commanded him to be captain
[1:48:39] over his people because thou has not
[1:48:41] kept which the LORD commanded thee all's
[1:48:43] God wants is somebody to obey the Word
[1:48:45] of God God wants somebody that obeys the
[1:48:48] message praise the Lord
[1:48:50] not just listen to the message but obeys
[1:48:52] it I want to listen and obey praise God
[1:48:57] that's right this is what David did
[1:49:01] David was a man after the heart of God
[1:49:04] now this let's go to Psalm 78 I need to
[1:49:05] close so I'm saying it's gonna be hard
[1:49:07] to close so I'm 78 70 go there Malachi
[1:49:09] please buddy this is the scripture I've
[1:49:11] never seen really before today so I'm 78
[1:49:20] 70 and I appreciate everybody being
[1:49:24] patient with me here I'm almost done
[1:49:25] give me a moment try to by God's grace I
[1:49:28] just had a scripture come to my mind err
[1:49:30] and look it up real quick okay all right
[1:49:37] Psalm 78 70 Davie Dahl so a servant and
[1:49:42] took him from the sheepfold so he was so
[1:49:44] humble just a little he's this a little
[1:49:46] pastor he was just a little pastor with
[1:49:48] a bunch of sheep right he said he took
[1:49:51] him from the sheepfolds from following
[1:49:53] the ewes great with young so he'd always
[1:49:56] watched him in as their make sure they
[1:49:57] had their babies the right way Oh glory
[1:50:00] with young he brought him to feed Jacob
[1:50:02] his people and Israel as inheritance he
[1:50:05] used to feed sheep but God said because
[1:50:06] he's faithful feeding sheep I'm gonna
[1:50:09] have him feed my people amen
[1:50:12] so he fed them according to the
[1:50:14] integrity of his heart amen and guided
[1:50:19] them by the skillfulness of his hands oh
[1:50:22] don't you like that church now we're
[1:50:24] seeing what God what is a man after
[1:50:26] God's own heart he's a man that feeds
[1:50:28] the people the Word of God according to
[1:50:31] the integrity of his heart in other
[1:50:33] words he preaches what he lives and he
[1:50:36] guy
[1:50:38] them by the skillfulness of his hand now
[1:50:40] for us that's the skillfulness of Jesus
[1:50:42] Christ those nail-scarred hands amen God
[1:50:45] giving us his word go if you everybody
[1:50:49] was going to Luke 12:40 to Luke 12:40 -
[1:50:55] and the Lord said who then is that
[1:50:59] faithful wise steward whom his Lord
[1:51:01] shall make ruler over his own household
[1:51:03] to give them their portion of meat in
[1:51:05] due season blessed is that servant whom
[1:51:08] his Lord when he cometh shall find him
[1:51:11] doing so so God wants a servant who's
[1:51:14] giving the people the meat for this hour
[1:51:16] that they're living in praise God that's
[1:51:19] a faithful servant David was giving
[1:51:21] feeding them the food they had need of
[1:51:23] in church that's what I'm feeding
[1:51:25] everyone here I'm feeding us the Word of
[1:51:27] God amen
[1:51:29] look at verse 44 the truth I say to you
[1:51:32] that he will make him ruler over all
[1:51:33] that he hath but an if that servant
[1:51:36] saying is hard my lord delayeth his
[1:51:38] coming and shall begin to beat the
[1:51:39] menservants and maidens and to eat and
[1:51:42] drink and be drunken that lord of the
[1:51:44] servant will come in a day when he
[1:51:45] looketh not for him in an hour when he's
[1:51:47] not aware and will cut him in asunder
[1:51:49] and will appoint him his portion with
[1:51:51] the unbelievers I don't want to be that
[1:51:52] guy I want to be watching and waiting
[1:51:55] for the coming of the Lord I want to be
[1:51:57] giving people the meat of God for the
[1:51:59] hour having them feast on it and I want
[1:52:01] to see Jesus come and say well done thou
[1:52:03] good and faithful servant amen
[1:52:06] that's what diva did he fed people he
[1:52:09] fed the sheep and then he fed the people
[1:52:10] from the integrity of his heart this is
[1:52:13] how Christians should live this is what
[1:52:15] we should feast upon as the word of God
[1:52:17] amen
[1:52:19] go to the book of John here I believe
[1:52:21] it's John chapter two but I'm gonna pull
[1:52:27] it up here I'm searching this the
[1:52:28] scripture just came to me
[1:52:36] 4:34 sorry John 4:34 remember with the
[1:52:39] woman at the well the disciples were
[1:52:40] asking Oh would you want us to go get
[1:52:42] meat or anything like that
[1:52:43] remember what Jesus said what was
[1:52:47] Jesus's meat that he was always eating
[1:52:49] John 4:34 Jesus say to them my meat is
[1:52:53] through the will of him that sent me and
[1:52:55] to finish his work
[1:52:57] hallelujah that's what we need to be
[1:53:01] feasting on find out what God called you
[1:53:03] to do and get busy doing it and the
[1:53:05] church said find your meat because the
[1:53:08] Word of God is becoming and it's meat to
[1:53:11] us find the Word of God that's for us to
[1:53:13] fulfill and that is our meat that's what
[1:53:15] we're feasting on is doing God's will
[1:53:17] for right now praise God and that's what
[1:53:21] a real preach that's what I aim to do
[1:53:23] every pastor aims to do that to give the
[1:53:25] people the meat in due season not to
[1:53:27] beat them and to get drunk and to have
[1:53:30] all these kinds of evil sins
[1:53:32] but to live pure and keep watching for
[1:53:34] the coming of the Lord
[1:53:35] go to Hebrews five part of meat is
[1:53:47] preaching the Word of God so that you
[1:53:51] know and you can recognize evil in your
[1:53:53] life praise God when the preaching comes
[1:53:57] and it shows you how to recognize evil
[1:54:00] versus good that's meat according to the
[1:54:02] Bible praise God look at verse 12
[1:54:07] Hebrews 5:12 for when for the time ye
[1:54:10] ought to be teachers you have need that
[1:54:12] one teach you again the first principles
[1:54:14] of the Oracles of God and I'll become as
[1:54:16] such as have need of milk and not strong
[1:54:18] meat for everyone that uses milk is
[1:54:21] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:54:22] for he's a babe
[1:54:23] look at verse 14 what is strong meat but
[1:54:27] strong meat belongeth to them that are
[1:54:29] of a full age even those who by reason
[1:54:31] of use have their senses exercised to
[1:54:34] discern both good and evil
[1:54:36] a person who's feasting on the meat of
[1:54:40] God can quickly recognize this is wrong
[1:54:43] this is right that's someone who's
[1:54:47] really feasting on the meat of God you
[1:54:50] have you're so spiritually sharp you can
[1:54:52] recognize oh that's the devil trying to
[1:54:54] get it that's the devil trying to make
[1:54:55] me jealous that's the devil trying to
[1:54:58] get me to lust that's the devil to try
[1:55:01] to get me angry with somebody and the
[1:55:03] church said you see when we start when
[1:55:06] we can really recognize God God trying
[1:55:08] to protect us from any sin on any level
[1:55:10] no matter how big the sin no matter how
[1:55:13] small it is
[1:55:14] now we're feasting on the meat of God
[1:55:16] that's the Word of God and Jesus said
[1:55:19] it's my meat to do the will of God that
[1:55:21] sent me do you appreciate that word you
[1:55:25] appreciate that amen let's go to
[1:55:30] Ephesians chapter 1 verse 8 almost done
[1:55:38] here we will be a mature church when we
[1:55:48] can recognize Satan and every one of his
[1:55:50] tricks that's what Hebrews 5 is saying
[1:55:52] when your senses are exercising you can
[1:55:54] discern good and evil now you're a
[1:55:57] mature Christian but the way you do it
[1:56:00] is through prayer how many know that a
[1:56:02] more dedicated prayer life more
[1:56:04] communion more fellowship with Jesus
[1:56:06] that's how you become more stronger
[1:56:10] discernment in the Holy Spirit amen
[1:56:13] seasons 1:8 where he hath abounded
[1:56:16] toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[1:56:18] verse 9 having made known to unto us the
[1:56:23] mystery of his will according to his
[1:56:25] good pleasure which we have he hath
[1:56:27] purposed in himself
[1:56:28] so where's God's purpose for you it's in
[1:56:31] Christ where is God's purpose for you
[1:56:34] you're gonna find it in this word right
[1:56:35] here brother Branham says now Luke II
[1:56:38] said no it's not just one little thing
[1:56:41] it's a mystery God's will for you is a
[1:56:44] mystery and each man has to seek out the
[1:56:47] will of God for his or her self God's
[1:56:50] mystery I wonder have we done that
[1:56:55] lately have we sought out God for his
[1:56:58] will for our lives lately let me close
[1:57:00] the
[1:57:01] this thought the thought brother branham
[1:57:03] gives after this quote is I'm sorry saw
[1:57:06] turning into Paul remember Jesus knocked
[1:57:11] him off his horse on the road to
[1:57:13] Damascus and Jesus said rise and stand
[1:57:16] upon thy feet for I've appeared unto
[1:57:18] thee for this purpose to make the a
[1:57:20] minister and a witness both of these
[1:57:22] things which thou has seen and of those
[1:57:24] things which I will appear unto thee
[1:57:27] delivering me from the people and from
[1:57:29] the Gentiles and whom I now send thee to
[1:57:32] open their eyes and to turn them from
[1:57:34] darkness to light and from the power of
[1:57:36] Satan unto God that they may receive
[1:57:38] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[1:57:40] among them which are sanctified by faith
[1:57:43] that is in me where a part o King
[1:57:45] Agrippa I was not disobedient under the
[1:57:47] heavenly vision amen glory saw was
[1:57:51] disobedient to the heavenly vision but
[1:57:53] David was obedient to the heavenly
[1:57:55] vision amen and now Paul is obedient to
[1:57:59] the heavenly vision and brother man said
[1:58:01] once God showed in his wilfer's life
[1:58:03] where did he go who knows where Paul
[1:58:05] went after this he went to Arabia for
[1:58:07] three years brother Branham said hum and
[1:58:13] he said how many was here yesterday
[1:58:14] morning the mystery of his will he said
[1:58:18] how do we find out God's will
[1:58:20] Paul it was known to him he didn't
[1:58:23] confer with any man no flesh or blood he
[1:58:25] didn't go to no school no seminary he
[1:58:28] said he went into Arabia and dwelt there
[1:58:31] for three years he said oh don't you
[1:58:33] imagine that was some time brother Egan
[1:58:35] three years down there Paul was in
[1:58:37] Arabia rented him a little building
[1:58:39] walking up and down the floors with the
[1:58:41] old scrolls he says right in these old
[1:58:44] scrolls how that God at the beginning
[1:58:46] predestinated unto eternal life he says
[1:58:49] oh I imagine Paul had a wonderful time I
[1:58:51] like to have been there with him
[1:58:52] wouldn't you
[1:58:53] let's stay on our feet by God's grace
[1:58:55] there goes my time an hour and 15
[1:58:57] minutes praise the Lord now as your
[1:59:03] and I'm gonna read Ephesians 5 briefly
[1:59:08] after the heart of God what are we after
[1:59:11] today are we after money after women
[1:59:17] what are we after we should be after the
[1:59:20] will of God we should be after finding
[1:59:23] out the heavenly vision for our lives
[1:59:25] how many can say amen to that as you're
[1:59:29] standing Paul says in Ephesians 5:8 for
[1:59:32] you were sometimes darkness but now are
[1:59:34] ye light in the Lord walk as children of
[1:59:36] the light for to the fruit of the Spirit
[1:59:38] is in all goodness and righteousness and
[1:59:40] truth proving what is acceptable unto
[1:59:43] God have no fellowship with the
[1:59:47] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[1:59:49] reprove them for it's a shame to even
[1:59:52] speak of those things which are done of
[1:59:53] them in secret see then hear that you
[1:59:57] walk circumspectly not as fool's but as
[1:59:59] wise redeeming the time because the days
[2:00:03] are evil wherefore be not ye unwise but
[2:00:07] understanding what the will of the Lord
[2:00:09] is a man how many one know the will of
[2:00:11] God oh there's no good thing to know and
[2:00:15] we are called to prove the will of God
[2:00:20] in other words is this is this the right
[2:00:23] job I should have we should be able to
[2:00:25] prove that by the Word of God is this
[2:00:27] the right relationship I should be in
[2:00:30] are these the right hobbies that I have
[2:00:32] is my home life in the right condition
[2:00:34] we should be able to prove and say I'm
[2:00:37] in the will of God because God has
[2:00:39] showed me he's given me two or three
[2:00:41] witnesses please let's take this thought
[2:00:47] very seriously we should be able to
[2:00:52] prove that we are in the will of God

[2:00:55] it out for his own life hallelujah I
