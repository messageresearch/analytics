[30:42] stand if you have your bibles today if
[30:43] you could stay in your home there and
[30:44] honor the word of god
[30:47] such a beautiful atmosphere great
[30:48] singing children now got a wonderful job
[30:50] on the piano
[30:53] we like to read two scriptures here i'd
[30:55] like to preach on the power of jesus's
[30:57] doctrine i wanted to just take a few
[30:59] sermons and do a little series on this
[31:02] as far as my records i've only preached
[31:03] one sermon about doctrine i called it
[31:05] doctrine the saves back in 2017
[31:09] and uh
[31:10] so it's quite a while ago i had heard
[31:12] different voices saying amen that no
[31:13] longer in the church
[31:15] but thank god for those that are still
[31:16] here by god's grace
[31:19] let's go to luke 4 31 luke 4 31.
[31:33] 431
[31:49] yeah we're at about 57
[31:52] thank you
[31:53] luke 431
[32:03] the power of jesus is doctrine or
[32:06] doctrine means teaching
[32:11] and i'm trusting this
[32:13] topic will help us better understand
[32:17] the emphasis on jesus's doctrine and
[32:19] teaching
[32:22] lord willing my next video will be about
[32:24] this subject so that's why
[32:25] i've been in study on this subject here
[32:27] for
[32:28] a number of weeks by god's grace
[32:31] when you understand doctrine it's
[32:32] instruction or how to
[32:35] or command
[32:37] so if you just look at that that
[32:39] definition
[32:41] any command any instruction from jesus
[32:45] which involves our whole lives right
[32:49] uh you know work family church gifts of
[32:51] the holy spirit etc
[32:54] any instruction we are given on how to
[32:56] live and what to do
[32:58] is doctrine
[33:00] so
[33:02] uh
[33:03] the scope of doctrine is enormous it
[33:05] covers
[33:07] uh every era of our life as you'll see
[33:10] how we how do we pray
[33:12] how do we fast
[33:14] how do we uh operate the gifts of the
[33:16] holy spirit
[33:19] how do we love how do we
[33:23] i forgive
[33:23] how do we receive the holy ghost how do
[33:24] we be how are we saved
[33:26] i mean this covers doctrine covers
[33:29] so much
[33:30] uh scripture and there's so many
[33:32] commands
[33:33] that jesus christ and his apostles and
[33:35] bible wroters our bible authors rather
[33:38] wrote forgive me
[33:40] uh
[33:41] it's just it's a massive subject it's
[33:42] just enormous and i want to take a few
[33:45] sermons here and hopefully this will
[33:46] enlighten
[33:48] uh myself and i know has enlightened me
[33:50] as i've studied but light and everyone
[33:52] in the church and those who you know
[33:54] listen on archive or so forth like that
[33:56] you know really help them and then the
[33:57] next youtube video will
[33:59] kind of briefly cover this subject as
[34:01] well
[34:03] luke 4 31 and 32.
[34:08] verse 31 says and came down to capernaum
[34:11] a city of galilee
[34:13] and taught them on the sabbath days
[34:16] verse 32 and they were astonished at his
[34:19] doctrine
[34:20] for his word was with power
[34:24] now in the next
[34:26] verses 33-36
[34:29] jesus rebukes evil spirits and they come
[34:32] out of
[34:34] men
[34:36] okay and then in verse 36 and they were
[34:38] all amazed and spake among themselves
[34:40] saying what a word is this
[34:42] for with authority and power he
[34:43] commandeth the unclean spirits and they
[34:45] come out
[34:47] verse 37 and the fame of him went out
[34:50] in every place of the country round
[34:52] about
[34:56] so people were astonished at jesus's
[34:59] doctrine or his commands
[35:01] because his commands were with power
[35:05] okay then john 6 45 this is kind of one
[35:08] of where i want to end up lord willing
[35:10] at the end of this message
[35:12] john 6 45.
[35:20] i think i'll have all my children join
[35:21] me in
[35:22] reading this okay john 6 45
[35:30] now the reason i'm reading this is to
[35:32] show i like to close with the thought
[35:34] that
[35:36] brother branham uses this scripture to
[35:38] show
[35:39] the evidence for having the baptism of
[35:41] the holy ghost
[35:43] is the fact you are able to be taught of
[35:46] the holy ghost
[35:48] those who cannot be taught
[35:50] doctrine by the holy ghost are not born
[35:52] again
[35:54] so that's what brother branham put in at
[35:57] least two places in the church age book
[35:59] and it's just a beautiful thought i just
[36:01] you know i
[36:02] uh
[36:03] i thought it's just so critical for us
[36:04] to understand these things
[36:06] so let's read uh john 6 45 on 3 1 2 3.
[36:11] it is written in the prophets and they
[36:14] shall be all taught of god
[36:17] every man therefore that hath heard and
[36:20] hath learned of the father cometh unto
[36:23] me let's have a word of prayer let's bow
[36:25] our heads here
[36:27] heavenly father we love you god and
[36:29] we're talking about you today lord jesus
[36:31] the greatest thing we could talk about
[36:32] the greatest person we could think about
[36:34] meditate on and speak his word
[36:37] is you oh god the lord jesus christ we
[36:39] come reverently god again forgive us of
[36:41] any sin god and may our
[36:44] faith lord be honored today may our
[36:47] prayers be honored may you heal lord the
[36:48] sick lord god and do miracles in jesus
[36:51] name for your word is with power
[36:53] hallelujah you said you sent your word
[36:55] and it healed the sick so lord send your
[36:56] word to benjamin vu send your word
[36:59] lord to simon in england in jesus
[37:01] christ's name to lead in akron god just
[37:04] heal the sick and afflicted i pray
[37:06] father for your word has power may they
[37:08] receive the revelation of your word
[37:10] and so god will give you thanks and
[37:12] praise and just take me lord use me as a
[37:14] vessel that your people might be
[37:15] strengthened god
[37:17] growing grace and knowledge of you today
[37:19] may we all be taught of our father today
[37:23] the heavenly father the holy spirit in
[37:25] jesus christ's name and the saint said
[37:28] amen god bless you as you being seated
[37:30] praise god
[37:34] so we'll look at this thought uh
[37:36] the power of jesus is doctrine
[37:41] and i know to be a blessing to you
[37:44] because i'm not sure how many uh
[37:48] sermons will get out of this series but
[37:51] i think it's really crucial
[37:54] to understand it
[37:58] so i first want to overview doctrine
[38:00] briefly
[38:01] by the grace of god in the bible you
[38:04] know brother braham said when the seals
[38:05] were open the bible became a new bible
[38:08] so how many can raise your hand at home
[38:09] and say the bible is new to me
[38:12] hallelujah so you have to look at what
[38:13] was your attitude toward the bible when
[38:14] you were a sinner
[38:16] right even if you were sitting in a
[38:17] message church and what was your
[38:19] attitude toward the bible once you got
[38:21] saved
[38:22] and then when you get filled with the
[38:23] holy ghost you should have even more
[38:24] love for the bible you should realize
[38:27] more the importance of holy scripture
[38:29] for jesus said my words are spirit and
[38:32] they are life to the christian the holy
[38:34] ghost filled christian the word of god
[38:35] is not a dead letter
[38:37] the word of god's a dead letter to the
[38:39] desires of the flesh and the worldly
[38:41] desires of the mind but to the soul the
[38:44] word of god is absolutely life it's
[38:47] life-giving and as we read the word of
[38:50] god the holy spirit
[38:51] quickens that word makes it alive
[38:54] and uh feeds our souls and then it gives
[38:56] us strength to obey the word of god it's
[38:59] a beautiful
[39:00] beautiful
[39:01] experience being a holy ghost phil
[39:03] christian praise god just pick up your
[39:04] bible and you receive as you read you
[39:06] receive the life of christ praise god to
[39:09] to live through you
[39:11] so let's just do a brief overview here
[39:15] the word doctrine
[39:17] is the same as teaching it's just
[39:19] another word
[39:21] for it
[39:22] uh and there's three main greek words
[39:24] that are used for
[39:26] doctrine and teaching their meanings
[39:28] overlap
[39:30] so just you know just as we have
[39:31] numerous different words in our language
[39:33] in english that mean the same thing
[39:36] right
[39:36] so we i'll just read briefly look at the
[39:39] greek words uh the word didasco has 91
[39:42] hits that's the one that has the most
[39:45] uses that's the word teaching in the
[39:47] greek
[39:47] in the new testament
[39:49] and then uh the next one is dida
[39:52] did aki or didache i'm not sure how to
[39:54] say that but that has 30 uses
[39:56] usually it means the word taught
[39:58] in the new testament and then dida
[40:00] scalia that's the word for doctrine in
[40:03] the new testament so if you add these up
[40:05] church
[40:06] there's 158
[40:08] uses
[40:09] for
[40:10] doctrine and teaching and taught
[40:13] in the new testament
[40:15] so this is a pretty large subject
[40:17] right how many verses are there on the
[40:19] seven seals well there's
[40:21] there's there's revelation you know
[40:23] chapter uh five six and eight but that's
[40:26] really all that's really all there is
[40:29] right but there's 158 for teaching
[40:32] doctrine
[40:33] and uh being taught of the lord now i'm
[40:35] not diminishing the the verses on the
[40:37] seals
[40:38] but i'm showing you how much emphasis
[40:41] the holy spirit who wrote the word of
[40:43] god put upon doctrine and teaching it's
[40:46] a very large
[40:47] emphasis
[40:49] okay now i'm going to go through the
[40:51] greek definitions briefly as well just
[40:53] to show you didasco means to instruct to
[40:56] be a teacher to impart instruction
[40:59] instill doctrine into one
[41:02] okay scalia means teaching precepts
[41:05] instruction or doctrine
[41:07] and then didachi or dadaki
[41:10] means teaching or instruction so that's
[41:12] it's completely
[41:13] uh synonymous they're all synonymous
[41:15] terms
[41:17] okay now i just as i was meditating on
[41:19] this thought i just had this
[41:21] this thought come to me as far as
[41:24] 158 times just in the new testament
[41:26] right
[41:27] the old testament has 110.
[41:30] so this is 268 in the bible there's
[41:33] almost 300
[41:35] times the whole bible uses doctrine
[41:37] teaching instruction now compare that
[41:40] with a subject we all love how many love
[41:42] the latter rain subject the latter rain
[41:44] is the rapturing faith and we all want
[41:46] rapturing faith praise god we all we all
[41:49] want to go with jesus none of us want to
[41:51] be left behind right and as much as we
[41:53] love this subject guess how many times
[41:55] the term ladder rain is used in the
[41:57] bible
[41:58] nine times
[42:00] nine not even ten not even ten
[42:02] there's eight in the old testament and
[42:03] one in the new testament james five
[42:06] verse seven is the only new testament
[42:08] scripture
[42:08] about the latter rain now we all are
[42:11] excited for the latter rain we're all
[42:12] excited to uh you know to have rapturing
[42:15] faith
[42:17] but the bible emphasizes
[42:19] teaching and instruction from the holy
[42:21] spirit
[42:23] many many more times so the conclusion
[42:25] must be this both
[42:27] both subjects are imperative both are
[42:29] absolutely necessary for us
[42:31] we are not the foolish virgin we will
[42:33] not be left behind we're not the lot
[42:34] group we're not the noah group we're the
[42:36] abraham group praise god
[42:38] we're the enoch group hallelujah
[42:41] so the only conclusion is that the holy
[42:43] spirit is
[42:44] emphasizing god's love for doctrine
[42:48] and those who will be taught the
[42:49] doctrine will be ready for the latter
[42:51] reign
[42:52] that's the only conclusion that we can
[42:54] come to if the holy ghost gives such an
[42:56] emphasis on teaching and doctrine
[42:59] and then just a small number of verses
[43:00] on latter reign then that must prove the
[43:02] latter reign is hidden from the majority
[43:05] of bible readers right it's a it's a
[43:07] revelation it's a mystery hidden from
[43:09] the eyes of the wise and prudent but
[43:11] it's revealed to the babes that will
[43:14] receive the emphasis of the holy spirit
[43:16] about living a life that's pleasing to
[43:19] god keeping jesus's commands he said if
[43:22] you love me you'll keep my commands and
[43:24] as many as i love i'll rebuke and
[43:27] chasten so god is going to rebuke us and
[43:29] correct us through giving us
[43:31] commands that we need to obey
[43:33] that in turn
[43:35] molds the character of jesus christ into
[43:38] our character
[43:39] because that's what we're supposed to be
[43:40] the bible says in romans we're supposed
[43:42] to be fashioned like unto the son of god
[43:45] right conformed into the image of jesus
[43:47] christ
[43:48] so that's a great revelation
[43:50] all if you want to be ready for the
[43:52] rapturing or the rapturing faith the
[43:53] latter rain then receive all of jesus
[43:56] doctrine receive all of paul's doctrine
[43:58] brother branham's doctrine
[44:00] you know as it lines up with the word of
[44:01] god
[44:03] and we'll talk a little bit about that
[44:04] you know in future sermons to come
[44:06] so what a great uh what a great thought
[44:08] what a great overview
[44:10] uh that teaching and doctrine and
[44:12] instruction is commands is a major
[44:15] uh subject in the word of god
[44:18] and the only conclusion we can come to
[44:20] the reason more churches don't preach it
[44:22] is because uh
[44:24] uh it doesn't uh it's not an easy thing
[44:28] right uh most most people don't like
[44:31] uh commands right they want to come the
[44:33] bible says in the last days they'll want
[44:35] to come to church and they want to have
[44:37] a preacher tickle their ears right
[44:40] so a tickle is not the same as a rebuke
[44:43] right think about when you're a child as
[44:45] your mom or dad they ever tickle you
[44:47] well what about when they rebuked you
[44:48] was it a tickle no it was a
[44:51] it was a humbling experience right a
[44:53] tickling is more like a playful kind of
[44:55] thing we don't want to come we don't
[44:56] want to come to church and play church
[44:59] that's what the foolish virgin that's
[45:00] what you know other people do
[45:02] uh workers of iniquity especially that's
[45:05] all it is is playing at church
[45:08] a foolish virgin does have some serious
[45:10] sermons we know from time to time but
[45:12] the true bride of christ
[45:14] will receive the commands of christ and
[45:18] they will be rebuked by christ
[45:20] as jesus said as many as i love i'll
[45:22] rebuke them i'll speak to them at times
[45:24] harshly in order to correct their
[45:25] character because they know better right
[45:27] most of us as christians we know better
[45:30] uh when we do sins right we commit sins
[45:32] but we know better and so god is patient
[45:34] with us aren't you glad he's patient
[45:35] with us and he's loving and he works
[45:37] with us until
[45:38] we surrender to his holy spirit to
[45:41] receive his power to overcome bad habits
[45:44] to overcome complexes that we looked at
[45:47] on wednesday
[45:48] remember most people will live with
[45:50] their complexes most people will live
[45:52] with their bad habits and then just pray
[45:53] for grace at the end now they can be
[45:55] saved like the thief on the cross if
[45:57] they really repent
[45:59] but jesus bride should have such
[46:00] character
[46:02] the bible says that she should be
[46:03] continually examining herself to clean
[46:05] out her whole life walking in white
[46:07] garments right no stains on the garments
[46:10] living the high calling living a higher
[46:12] life remember you can jump as high as
[46:14] you're living praise god so we can jump
[46:17] and rejoice in what god has helped us to
[46:19] obey helped us to overcome
[46:22] uh over the course of our service to the
[46:24] lord jesus christ
[46:26] sorry it's kind of cold down here
[46:28] i got cold hands as it is so
[46:30] um
[46:31] now i want to start with a couple quotes
[46:34] from brother brown two quotes from
[46:35] brother brandon okay so
[46:36] bear with me this is from 1953 speak to
[46:39] the rock now listen brother braham said
[46:42] the gospel is not altogether the word
[46:45] this is the word of god and all things
[46:48] must be based upon the word
[46:51] if it isn't it isn't true
[46:54] but jesus said go ye in all the world
[46:57] and preach the gospel to every creature
[46:59] now he did not say teach the word he
[47:01] said preach the gospel. now we have to
[47:04] stop here and make a correction because
[47:05] jesus did say teach
[47:07] okay so brother man just has a human
[47:08] mistake here right and the proof is in
[47:11] matthew 28 19 jesus said go ye therefore
[47:14] and teach
[47:15] all nations
[47:17] okay so again as we
[47:19] as we grow as christians we we love
[47:21] brother branham he was a true prophet we
[47:23] give him honor like john the baptist
[47:25] but he was not infallible
[47:28] and he said if there's a mix-up look in
[47:30] the bible here's a perfect example
[47:32] he's showing there's a difference
[47:33] between preaching and teaching and there
[47:35] is
[47:36] and you'll hear it as i finish his quote
[47:38] but here he says jesus didn't say teach
[47:40] the word but i just read you in matthew
[47:42] 20 19 where he said teach all nations
[47:46] okay so there's a great balance here
[47:49] now let's finish the quote
[47:51] so the gospel consists more than
[47:53] teaching the word for paul confirmed
[47:55] that saying the gospel came to us not in
[47:58] word only but through power
[48:00] okay demonstrations of the holy spirit
[48:03] would come and demonstrate the gospel
[48:05] bring the word to a living reality
[48:08] okay so now brother is talking about the
[48:10] difference there's uh the manifestation
[48:13] of the word of god but then there's the
[48:14] speaking of the word as well or the
[48:16] preaching of the word there's power
[48:18] and there's preaching or teaching we'd
[48:20] say
[48:23] if you just receive the word by knowing
[48:25] the word that doesn't do you any good
[48:27] the letter kilth but the spirit giveth
[48:29] life
[48:30] okay he says then you must be born again
[48:33] and then the holy spirit quickens the
[48:35] word to you
[48:36] okay
[48:38] he says in other words like a grain of
[48:40] corn it's the laying in my hand it's
[48:42] just a grain of corn it'll never be
[48:43] nothing else but bury it and it becomes
[48:46] contaminated molds and then it brings up
[48:49] another grain of corn just like it
[48:51] okay so just in other words just sitting
[48:53] in church hearing
[48:55] hearing uh
[48:56] the preaching doesn't do you anything
[48:58] you've got to accept that believe that
[49:00] plant that in your heart and then the
[49:01] holy spirit comes quick in that quickens
[49:03] that word and makes it alive
[49:06] okay so brother is making uh
[49:08] um
[49:10] a point here to show how
[49:12] there's the word but then there's the
[49:13] manifestation of the word as well
[49:16] okay
[49:18] and so we see that now we're going to
[49:19] see it in the bible the broth the bible
[49:21] calls it this the bible says it's
[49:22] preaching verses
[49:24] teaching
[49:26] so that's why that's how the bible
[49:27] defines it
[49:28] preaching is them uh declaring what god
[49:31] has done or what god has gonna do
[49:33] teaching is instruction with commands on
[49:36] what you should do
[49:38] okay so we're gonna show that by
[49:39] numerous scriptures today by god's grace
[49:42] but just keep that in mind that's the
[49:43] point brother branham is making there's
[49:45] times you're teaching you're commanding
[49:47] the people but other times there's
[49:48] you're speaking the word of god and it
[49:50] is demonstrating itself in power
[49:52] right like with brother jose getting
[49:54] healed you know and brother johnny
[49:56] getting healed you know from his ankle
[49:58] uh pain there and you know brother uh
[50:00] for the amen you know being healed when
[50:02] sister hua laid her hand on him you know
[50:04] prayed for him that one night you know
[50:06] uh that's the power that's the
[50:07] manifestation of the word of god that's
[50:09] the declaration of god's word right you
[50:11] have that but you also have the teaching
[50:14] of god's word as well
[50:16] now fast forward to the next year the
[50:17] seven church ages brother brahms said
[50:20] um he said i'm staying a year and six
[50:22] months in this book of revelation
[50:25] in the tabernacle here that's what i
[50:27] like in teaching so brother man says
[50:29] here he likes teaching
[50:31] i just love teaching oh my i i think
[50:34] it's wonderful it gives the basis it
[50:37] settles the church so brother branham
[50:39] says teaching gives the church a
[50:40] settling or a foundation
[50:43] he says and in preaching now there are
[50:45] some people that are preachers they can
[50:46] pick up the word with inspiration and
[50:48] sway it out there in places that's
[50:51] watering the seeds that the teacher has
[50:52] taught now look at that brother says the
[50:54] teacher plants the seeds in your heart
[50:56] but then the preaching makes it come
[50:58] alive that's another interesting thought
[50:59] there which i believe is true as well
[51:03] see now you've got to put some seed in
[51:05] first and then water it
[51:07] and the watering comes from the
[51:08] preaching of the word so here
[51:10] here we're seeing different aspects here
[51:12] of preaching and teaching you have the
[51:14] idea that some preachers will just
[51:15] preach it and you've got to let that
[51:16] word you've got to men you've got to
[51:18] ponder on that word right like mary
[51:19] pondered on the word of god until it
[51:21] came to a realization
[51:23] right a manifestation
[51:26] and then brother makes this statement
[51:28] there's a vast difference between a
[51:30] teacher
[51:31] and a preacher
[51:32] see it's two different gifts of the holy
[51:35] spirit all together two different gifts
[51:37] and i humbly say this i haven't got the
[51:40] gift of either brother branham says
[51:43] now i believe there were times brother
[51:44] ram had the gift of course to preach and
[51:46] teach but but here's what he's talking
[51:48] about in context he says but my gift as
[51:50] of usual is praying for the sick
[51:54] okay so we know as brother rams polls as
[51:57] he grew in his ministry right the second
[52:00] poll the third poll was really the
[52:02] opening of the word that was a real
[52:03] teaching ministry for him
[52:05] he taught the seven church ages the
[52:07] seven seals marriage and divorce
[52:09] anointed ones at the end times i mean
[52:11] all these amazing revelations
[52:14] okay so we know then there's seasons for
[52:16] our ministries as well
[52:19] or you know some people may have just
[52:20] one gift and that's their gift their
[52:21] whole life right but brother random had
[52:24] gifts here uh healing gifts at the
[52:26] beginning and then really came in uh to
[52:28] teaching later in
[52:30] later in his ministry he says that's
[52:32] what the lord called me to do this was
[52:34] 1954.
[52:36] okay so six years before he started
[52:37] teaching on the church ages
[52:40] all right
[52:42] so i got some bible readers here can
[52:43] everybody open their bible i could
[52:44] probably just go right down here and
[52:46] i could have some good bible readers
[52:48] here
[52:50] one two three four five six seven eight
[52:52] nine
[52:53] i have nine examples there's actually
[52:55] ten uh but there's there's nine examples
[52:57] we're going to read briefly because
[52:58] they're really short
[53:00] that show how jesus paul and the
[53:02] apostles all had
[53:04] they had both they had preaching
[53:06] and teaching
[53:08] so this proves with every ministry even
[53:10] jesus ministry
[53:12] he had to plant the seeds and then he
[53:14] would come water them or quicken them
[53:16] with the anointing of the holy spirit
[53:18] now both have the anointing right it
[53:20] takes
[53:21] the anointing to teach the right
[53:23] doctrine but also then takes another
[53:25] anointing here to make that alive
[53:29] okay so why don't we start here with
[53:31] lydia
[53:32] let's look at three verses about jesus
[53:34] he had both preaching and teaching
[53:38] okay
[53:38] so let's go to matthew 4 23 lydia acacia
[53:41] matthew 9 35
[53:44] and haven't you get matthew 11 1.
[53:48] so we've got your bibles at home matthew
[53:49] 4 23. you can turn there as well
[53:51] occasion 9 35
[53:53] and haven matthew 11 verse 1. it's going
[53:56] to be good if you turn there yourself in
[53:57] the bible there i'll give you a few
[53:58] moments here
[54:01] hopefully everybody read their bible
[54:02] already this morning but if not this is
[54:04] an important time for you to read your
[54:05] bible
[54:07] got to stay in the word of god praise
[54:08] god so here three verses about jesus he
[54:12] had both preaching and teaching and just
[54:13] humbly in my ministry i see both i see
[54:16] the holy ghost anointing me to teach at
[54:17] times but then i see the holy ghost
[54:19] leading me to pray or speak the word of
[54:20] god other times and it it manifests
[54:22] itself thank god for his mercy
[54:25] okay so uh lydia matthew 4 23
[54:30] and jesus went about all galilee
[54:31] teaching in their synagogues and
[54:33] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[54:34] healing all manner of sickness and all
[54:36] manner of disease among the people amen
[54:39] jesus did both preach
[54:41] and he taught now i forgot to say this
[54:43] but the word preach in the greek means
[54:45] to publish or declare
[54:48] so jesus would declare the sick heel
[54:50] there it is right there that's the
[54:52] preaching he would declare you're healed
[54:54] rise in the net rise in the name of the
[54:55] lord well he didn't have to say that but
[54:56] we say that rise up in the be receive
[54:58] your healing in the name of the lord
[55:00] that's preaching the gospel
[55:02] right but teaching is where he would
[55:04] teach on
[55:05] how to fast how to cast out devils right
[55:08] how to do marriage in divorce
[55:10] he would teach how to how to give alms
[55:13] so see he would have he would have
[55:15] teaching and then commands and then he
[55:17] would
[55:18] publish he would preach or declare the
[55:20] word of god
[55:22] uh woman rise up you know he
[55:24] a woman be healed of your infirmities
[55:26] you know he would he would just preach
[55:27] the word of god
[55:30] okay acacia matthew 9
[55:33] and jesus went about all the cities and
[55:36] villages teaching in their synagogues
[55:38] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[55:40] and healing every sicknesses and every
[55:42] disease among the people amen so another
[55:45] witness jesus both taught and preached
[55:48] in the synagogues those were like their
[55:49] local churches where they read the law
[55:52] of moses every sabbath day but also
[55:54] preach as well of course he probably
[55:56] wouldn't preach in the synagogue right
[55:58] he would just read the scripture like in
[55:59] luke 4 he'd read the scripture in the
[56:01] synagogue
[56:02] he might do a little bit of teaching in
[56:04] the synagogue i'm not quite sure
[56:06] uh but he would preach out you know on
[56:08] the boat on the hill a sermon on the
[56:10] mount you know he'd preach anywhere
[56:12] where the people were gathered to hear
[56:13] the word of god okay another one uh
[56:15] haven matthew 11 verse 1
[56:18] and it came to pass when jesus had made
[56:20] in the end of commanding his twelve
[56:22] disciples he departed thence to teach
[56:25] and to preach in their cities amen so
[56:28] after jesus sent out his 12 disciples
[56:30] then he went specifically to the cities
[56:33] they lived he went to their hometowns
[56:36] and he preached and taught
[56:38] in their hometowns so they would say oh
[56:41] this is simon's
[56:43] rabbi right oh this is james rabbi this
[56:45] is john's rabbi what a mighty
[56:48] servant of the lord now that that's the
[56:49] that's what the humble would say right
[56:51] the majority rejected him calling him
[56:52] beelzebub but though the common people
[56:54] heard him gladly praise god hallelujah
[56:57] so there's three witnesses jesus both
[56:59] preached declared god's word and taught
[57:02] gave commands how to instructions on how
[57:04] to live
[57:05] okay now let's do uh apostles malachi
[57:08] acts 5 42 lydia acts 15 35 in acacia
[57:13] acts 28 31 i'll give everybody a chance
[57:16] i'll repeat them
[57:17] acts 5 42 malachi lydia acts 15 35
[57:22] and acacia acts 28 31 now we see paul
[57:25] and the apostles doing both preaching
[57:28] and teaching
[57:30] brother ram said there's a vast
[57:31] difference isn't there
[57:33] there isn't there there is yeah i'm
[57:35] sorry there is like some preachers
[57:37] they'll just build your faith like i'm
[57:38] thinking like i like brother diggs right
[57:39] or you know they'll just build your
[57:41] faith just believe god's word just
[57:42] believe god's word leave god's word
[57:44] he doesn't really get down into teaching
[57:46] you on how to do this or how to do that
[57:48] you know
[57:48] but then like look at my ministry or
[57:50] other teachers you know you would see
[57:53] uh you know and they'll tell you this is
[57:55] how to do this this is how like brother
[57:56] bender out remember he taught us how to
[57:57] pray years ago that bible study
[58:00] he taught us about this is how you pray
[58:02] this is how you approach the lord
[58:03] through prayer mary taught us about
[58:04] music this is how you do music we talked
[58:05] about that last week
[58:07] this is how so that's a teaching that's
[58:09] a doctrinal
[58:11] uh discourse
[58:12] on how to do this how to do that but
[58:14] jesus would preach and he would declare
[58:17] the word of god
[58:18] and the devils had to move praise god
[58:21] hallelujah so maokai uh was you right
[58:24] acts 5 42
[58:26] and daily in the temple and in every
[58:27] house they cease not to teach and preach
[58:30] jesus christ amen
[58:32] daily every day they taught and preached
[58:35] in fact when uh in the in acts 5
[58:38] we didn't reckon read this to later but
[58:41] the angel
[58:42] sets the apostles free out of prison and
[58:44] then they wonder what happened they just
[58:45] kind of the angels let him out and the
[58:47] angel said go
[58:48] stand in the temple and teach the words
[58:51] of this life
[58:52] the angel of the lord told these miracle
[58:54] workers i just saw the lame man walk
[58:56] right the gate of beautiful he said go
[58:58] teach in the go teach the people
[59:01] go teach them in the temple
[59:03] so how could any man say the holy ghost
[59:05] doesn't want teaching the holy ghost
[59:07] loves teaching the angel of the lord
[59:09] loves teaching hallelujah because it's
[59:11] it's a part of it it's planting the seed
[59:14] of course that's one anointing and then
[59:15] the waters of the holy spirit will come
[59:16] and quicken that seed and make it make
[59:18] that live
[59:20] for example we just don't want to hear
[59:22] uh teaching about how to fast we
[59:24] actually want to experience it
[59:25] we want to fast and then see god do a
[59:27] mighty miracle or god give us our hearts
[59:29] desire we just don't want to hear
[59:30] teaching about praying we want to
[59:32] experience the power of prayer amen we
[59:34] want to live it praise god amen but
[59:37] that's what we must understand we've got
[59:38] to hear the teaching how to
[59:40] and then trust god and draw close to god
[59:42] until he gives us the anointing to do
[59:44] that
[59:45] and it may be quick it can be something
[59:46] very quick it can be right happen right
[59:48] in the service or it could come later
[59:51] but the thing to do is keep feeding on
[59:53] the word of god
[59:55] okay so lydia acts 15
[59:58] 35 paul also and barnabas continue to
[1:00:01] antioch teaching and preaching the word
[1:00:03] of the lord with many others also amen
[1:00:05] praise god so paul barnabas taught and
[1:00:09] preached the word of god and paul said
[1:00:11] if you teach or preach anything
[1:00:13] different than what i preach what do you
[1:00:14] say you're cursed
[1:00:16] anybody that would teach something
[1:00:17] different than paul
[1:00:19] is cursed by god
[1:00:21] and the bible said for this cause many
[1:00:23] are weak and sickly among you many
[1:00:25] people die and get sick
[1:00:27] because they change paul's gospel they
[1:00:29] don't discern the body of the lord they
[1:00:30] don't judge the word of god and teaching
[1:00:33] the right way
[1:00:35] okay the last one for the apostles this
[1:00:37] is about
[1:00:38] saint paul
[1:00:40] he had a hired house where although he
[1:00:42] was under house arrest uh
[1:00:45] rome let him receive all these people
[1:00:47] into his house he could teach and preach
[1:00:49] the word of god so acacia
[1:00:51] acts 28 31.
[1:01:00] preaching the kingdom of god and
[1:01:02] teaching those things which concern the
[1:01:05] lord jesus christ with all confidence no
[1:01:08] man forbidding him amen
[1:01:10] so paul had all confidence in what he
[1:01:12] taught
[1:01:13] and all confidence what he preached what
[1:01:15] he declared in the name of the lord
[1:01:18] beautiful
[1:01:20] um yeah i think for time we'll go ahead
[1:01:22] and we'll go ahead and read paul so
[1:01:23] malaka or haven colossians 1 28
[1:01:27] malachi 1st timothy 2 7 and lydia ii
[1:01:30] timothy 11.
[1:01:34] so again haven colossians 1 28 now this
[1:01:38] is right after paul talks about christ
[1:01:40] in you the hope of glory the baptism of
[1:01:42] the holy ghost which brother brahm said
[1:01:44] was jesus's first doctrine
[1:01:46] jesus first teaching is in john 3 ye
[1:01:48] must be born again if you want to see
[1:01:50] the kingdom of god you must be born
[1:01:52] again so colossians 1 28 first timothy 2
[1:01:55] 7 2 timothy 1 11. okay so haven when
[1:01:58] you're ready
[1:02:00] colossians 1 28
[1:02:02] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:02:05] teaching every man in all wisdom so
[1:02:08] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:02:12] christ jesus amen praise god we preach
[1:02:15] and teach with all wisdom where do we
[1:02:17] get wisdom
[1:02:18] james says ask it'll be given to you
[1:02:20] right where do we get wisdom fear the
[1:02:21] lord
[1:02:23] uh lord i i don't want to fail you lord
[1:02:25] i want to be led by your holy spirit i
[1:02:27] don't want any sin to enter my life keep
[1:02:28] me clean so in doing this and staying in
[1:02:31] the word of god meditating upon the word
[1:02:32] you'll be a great success joshua said
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:35] meditating staying in the word of god
[1:02:37] but we preach warn and teach every man
[1:02:41] okay so that's why that's interesting
[1:02:42] too there i just had that thought you'll
[1:02:44] have sermons of all three right you have
[1:02:45] a preaching sermon like we said brother
[1:02:47] diggs and other brothers that razor
[1:02:48] brother joe adams no doubt about that
[1:02:50] uh we'll have warning sermons right
[1:02:53] like those sermons i kind of preach with
[1:02:55] the false prophecies and false prophets
[1:02:57] even around the message
[1:02:58] coming out of jeffersonville
[1:03:00] and then uh the thunders movement that's
[1:03:02] that well that one had a lot of false
[1:03:04] prophecy of course that's all broken up
[1:03:06] into
[1:03:07] uh factions now as well but then also
[1:03:10] the word of faith movement has loaded
[1:03:12] with all kinds of false prophecies we
[1:03:13] have to stay away from those lying
[1:03:15] spirits
[1:03:17] okay but then also then there's teaching
[1:03:19] sermons teaching us how to pray teaching
[1:03:21] us how to fast
[1:03:22] teaching us how to give alms teaching us
[1:03:24] how to repent praise god
[1:03:27] we need all these we need all these
[1:03:29] types of sermons and god has anointed
[1:03:31] men for every one of them praise god uh
[1:03:35] malachi first timothy 2 7
[1:03:39] where to i am ordained a preacher and an
[1:03:41] apostle i speak the truth in christ am i
[1:03:44] not a teacher of the gentiles in faith
[1:03:46] and verity amen so paul was ordained by
[1:03:50] jesus christ to be a teacher apostle and
[1:03:53] preacher
[1:03:54] he was ordained for all these things and
[1:03:58] thank god he was because without it we
[1:04:00] wouldn't have much of the new testament
[1:04:02] right we wouldn't know how to do think
[1:04:03] about if we if we didn't have paul's
[1:04:04] letters
[1:04:05] i mean we wouldn't know hardly anything
[1:04:07] about you know hair length and gift
[1:04:09] gifts of the holy spirit modesty i mean
[1:04:11] we really want to have a lot of idea
[1:04:13] about the rapture you know
[1:04:16] we would be so lost as far as not having
[1:04:18] a lot of revelation but thank god we got
[1:04:20] it who ordained it jesus christ ordained
[1:04:22] it because he did the same thing he
[1:04:24] would preach teach warn prophesy he had
[1:04:27] all these gifts of preaching he had all
[1:04:28] the fivefold gifts praise god hallelujah
[1:04:31] lydia um ii timothy 1 11. i'm going to
[1:04:34] tissue
[1:04:35] where unto i am appointed a preacher and
[1:04:37] an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles
[1:04:41] amen that's kind of like a repeat of
[1:04:42] maokai's maybe a shorter version
[1:04:44] preacher apostle and teacher of the
[1:04:46] gentiles
[1:04:48] praise god
[1:04:50] okay so now church that's bible proof
[1:04:52] there there's nine bible proofs that
[1:04:54] jesus paul and
[1:04:56] the apostles did both preaching
[1:04:59] and teaching
[1:05:00] so if you hear any message preacher any
[1:05:02] preacher in general say oh we don't need
[1:05:03] doctrine or they belittle doctrine
[1:05:07] that's because satan has deceived them
[1:05:09] or they have a complex or something has
[1:05:11] happened
[1:05:12] because again it has a major witness in
[1:05:15] the scripture
[1:05:17] and as i said we'll get down to the end
[1:05:19] where brother branham says that's the
[1:05:20] proof you're born again that you can be
[1:05:22] taught doctrine
[1:05:24] you can
[1:05:25] be taught of the holy spirit if you
[1:05:28] can't you're not a child of god
[1:05:31] okay
[1:05:32] uh so
[1:05:33] now as for this sermon i want to spend
[1:05:35] most of this time looking at the the
[1:05:37] ministry of jesus christ
[1:05:39] okay so many people today i'm just going
[1:05:40] to read a few things off here many
[1:05:43] people today misunderstand that jesus
[1:05:45] was known for more than just his power
[1:05:48] which was his preaching he was known for
[1:05:51] more than that he was also known for his
[1:05:53] teaching
[1:05:54] okay
[1:05:55] because as we write we're going to read
[1:05:57] these scriptures again the pharisees and
[1:05:59] sadducees and the scribes
[1:06:02] had no power of god and they had no
[1:06:06] doctrine of god
[1:06:08] right they just had the basic
[1:06:10] fundamentals like the ten commandments
[1:06:11] but they didn't even carry those out
[1:06:13] right right because the bible said or
[1:06:16] the history shows
[1:06:17] they live by the traditions of men
[1:06:20] which was from their their own books the
[1:06:22] mishnah they had their own books outside
[1:06:25] of the bible to live and those their
[1:06:27] books told them how to interpret the
[1:06:28] bible
[1:06:30] which is wrong it's just like the book
[1:06:31] of mormon today or any other bit extra
[1:06:33] biblical book that has equal authority
[1:06:36] as the bible
[1:06:38] okay
[1:06:41] um
[1:06:43] and i believe the scripture teaches this
[1:06:46] jesus's power
[1:06:47] flowed from his doctrine
[1:06:50] right fro fro flowed from the commands
[1:06:52] god gave him so because he could receive
[1:06:54] god's commands in god's doctrine
[1:06:56] he could
[1:06:58] uh he could uh the power of god could
[1:06:59] flow out through him
[1:07:02] right because that's why the pharisees
[1:07:03] couldn't do the miracles jesus did
[1:07:04] because they didn't have jesus doctrine
[1:07:06] okay
[1:07:07] as we saw like brother ram says the
[1:07:09] illustration he uses doctrine are like
[1:07:11] the seeds but then the water's got to
[1:07:12] come upon the seeds to make those
[1:07:15] commands live
[1:07:16] so that's how it must have been with
[1:07:17] jesus he received god's instruction and
[1:07:20] the spirit came to quicken
[1:07:21] uh those commands in his life and then
[1:07:24] he could speak the word of god
[1:07:26] okay so
[1:07:28] let's see how um jesus got his doctrine
[1:07:32] from the father so it's john 7
[1:07:35] 16 and 17. i'm going to start reading
[1:07:37] some of these to give my children a
[1:07:38] break here they've been good they've
[1:07:40] been good merciful to me
[1:07:42] john 7 37
[1:07:47] so got your bibles john 7 37
[1:07:53] i'm sorry john 7 16 i'm sorry john 7 16
[1:07:56] my fault
[1:07:59] actually let's read 15 because they say
[1:08:01] and the jews marveled saying how knoweth
[1:08:02] this man letters having never learned
[1:08:06] because he was in the temple yeah look
[1:08:07] at verse 14 he was in the temple
[1:08:09] teaching he was teaching the word of god
[1:08:11] they're like this guy never went to
[1:08:12] seminary school
[1:08:14] verse 15 how does he know this he never
[1:08:16] learned verse 16 jesus answered them and
[1:08:18] said my doctrine is not my own
[1:08:22] but his that set me
[1:08:25] if any man will do his will
[1:08:28] he shall know of the doctrine
[1:08:32] or concerning the doctrine whether it be
[1:08:34] of god or whether i shall speak of
[1:08:36] myself
[1:08:38] in other words if you receive god's word
[1:08:40] you'll receive god's power amen that's
[1:08:42] it right there hallelujah
[1:08:45] if you receive jesus doctrine you'll see
[1:08:46] the same holy ghost in the book of acts
[1:08:49] manifesting your life hallelujah
[1:08:54] now look at verse 18 jesus says i'm not
[1:08:56] speaking to myself he says he that
[1:08:57] speaketh of himself seeketh his own
[1:08:59] glory
[1:09:00] so see when people preach their own
[1:09:01] doctrines their own teachings uh their
[1:09:03] own false ideas they're seeking their
[1:09:06] own glory
[1:09:07] right
[1:09:09] but he that seeketh his glory that sent
[1:09:10] him the same is true and no
[1:09:12] unrighteousness is in him
[1:09:15] praise god
[1:09:16] so jesus doctrine was not his own it was
[1:09:18] the fathers and he said those who obeyed
[1:09:22] his doctrine would know it came from god
[1:09:24] hallelujah church i had a man email me
[1:09:26] this week and say why don't you turn to
[1:09:28] to judaism he said you you're such a
[1:09:30] smart person i'm not smart but he must
[1:09:31] think i'm smart
[1:09:32] he said you want you turn to judaism
[1:09:34] that's what smart people turn to and i
[1:09:36] just wrote them back real short email i
[1:09:37] said sir i have seen jesus christ heal
[1:09:40] my mother of cancer i've seen jesus
[1:09:42] christ cast out devils i've seen jesus
[1:09:44] christ cleanse my wicked heart how could
[1:09:47] i ever turn from this
[1:09:48] jesus christ is alive and i said his
[1:09:50] spirit lives in me praise god amen i
[1:09:53] mean what else what else can i say i
[1:09:55] can't convince you
[1:09:57] but i've been convinced because i've
[1:09:59] done jesus doctrine and i've known it's
[1:10:01] from the father praise god hallelujah
[1:10:05] the same is true today those who follow
[1:10:06] jesus doctrine
[1:10:08] and instructions will know it's from god
[1:10:10] because they'll see the results that it
[1:10:11] bears and they'll see it in their own
[1:10:14] life and then nobody can talk them out
[1:10:16] of it because they're witnesses of it
[1:10:18] praise god that's where the holy ghost
[1:10:19] was to make you a witness
[1:10:21] unto akron unto doyle's town hallelujah
[1:10:23] under the uttermost parts of the earth
[1:10:25] praise god
[1:10:27] here's an interesting thought let's go
[1:10:29] to mark 4 verse 2.
[1:10:31] i just want you to like i said this is a
[1:10:33] massive subject
[1:10:38] now in verse 1 he's in a he's in a boat
[1:10:40] by the sea
[1:10:41] teaching out of a boat while the people
[1:10:42] are on the land verse 2 and he taught
[1:10:45] them many things by parables
[1:10:47] and said unto them in his doctrine
[1:10:51] hearken behold there went out a sower to
[1:10:54] sow
[1:10:56] hallelujah wow now look at this thought
[1:10:58] church look at this though this is kind
[1:10:59] of new to us
[1:11:01] even jesus's parables
[1:11:03] were doctrine
[1:11:06] right because if they give you commands
[1:11:07] on how to live or how to on how to live
[1:11:11] their doctrine
[1:11:12] for example this one this is the parable
[1:11:15] of the four grounds what how is this how
[1:11:16] to it tells us how to keep our ground
[1:11:19] pure from weeds amen
[1:11:22] and what he say that last ground is what
[1:11:24] a good and honest heart jesus christ
[1:11:28] himself said the mysteries of my
[1:11:30] parables are doctrine aren't you glad
[1:11:32] you know him praise god there's 16 in
[1:11:34] chapter 8 of my book if you want to read
[1:11:36] it or listen to it you can listen to it
[1:11:37] for free
[1:11:39] 16 parables that jesus talked about the
[1:11:41] kingdom now there's more parables than
[1:11:43] that but i just found the 16 that say
[1:11:45] the kingdom of heaven is like and unto
[1:11:47] so and so
[1:11:49] there's parables about the rapture
[1:11:50] there's parables about repentance right
[1:11:52] the man the unforgiven servant right
[1:11:55] who wouldn't forgive the other one but
[1:11:56] got his servant or his master forgave
[1:11:58] him of all those
[1:11:59] millions of dollars of debt that's how
[1:12:01] to repent that's how to forgive
[1:12:03] i mean jesus parables were so powerful
[1:12:05] they were teaching the believers as well
[1:12:07] see they caught the they taught the
[1:12:09] common person gladly but the pharisees
[1:12:11] they were just stories to them they
[1:12:12] didn't mean nothing
[1:12:14] but see they're not they're not kids
[1:12:16] stories to us they're stories of wisdom
[1:12:18] to us praise god they're stories of life
[1:12:20] to us and may we
[1:12:23] by the grace of god keep our ground
[1:12:25] honest and pure free from weeds free
[1:12:29] from the cares of this world
[1:12:31] always put jesus christ first
[1:12:34] and keep the cares of the world out of
[1:12:36] our hearts how many could say amen to
[1:12:37] that
[1:12:40] beautiful beautiful i mean this is bible
[1:12:42] truth here laying here all these years
[1:12:44] right and you know sometimes you don't
[1:12:46] hear people preaching
[1:12:48] it's because many times they maybe
[1:12:50] they're not called to do it or maybe
[1:12:52] they're disobedient and they're not
[1:12:53] growing in grace and knowledge of the
[1:12:55] word of god
[1:12:58] okay now
[1:13:01] uh matthew 7 28. i'm going to turn there
[1:13:11] now if you know
[1:13:12] kind of the context here
[1:13:14] this is the ending of the sermon on the
[1:13:17] mount
[1:13:18] right which was one of jesus most
[1:13:21] famous
[1:13:22] sermons he ever preached right
[1:13:26] he finishes
[1:13:28] his sermon on the mount and look at
[1:13:29] verse 28 and it came to pass when jesus
[1:13:31] had ended these sayings the people were
[1:13:33] astonished at his doctrine for he taught
[1:13:36] them as one having authority and not as
[1:13:39] the scribes
[1:13:41] so that word doctrine means teaching
[1:13:42] they were astonished as teaching well
[1:13:44] what did he just teach them about
[1:13:47] well if you go back to chapter five when
[1:13:48] he starts it the beatitudes
[1:13:52] right that's how to be blessed right
[1:13:53] blessed are they blessed are the poor
[1:13:55] and spirit blessed are they that mourn
[1:13:56] how do i how am i blessed keep the
[1:13:58] beatitude there's a doctor right there
[1:14:02] okay
[1:14:03] then he gets on
[1:14:04] the light of the earth you're the light
[1:14:06] of the earth
[1:14:09] uh then he talks about uh thou shalt not
[1:14:11] kill and how we he talks about how uh to
[1:14:14] deal with anger
[1:14:15] right how to overcome anger and you can
[1:14:17] be angry and sin not jesus talks about
[1:14:19] that
[1:14:20] how to give your gifts in uh matthew 5
[1:14:22] 24 how to give offerings and and ties
[1:14:25] right that's in chapter 5 as well uh
[1:14:28] looking and lusting is in matthew
[1:14:30] chapter five so right mental purity how
[1:14:33] how do i stay mentally pure
[1:14:35] that's a doctrine
[1:14:37] right
[1:14:39] um
[1:14:40] marriage and divorce is in uh matthew
[1:14:41] chapter five how do i marry how do i
[1:14:43] please god with my marriage
[1:14:45] that's doctrine
[1:14:48] uh
[1:14:50] and then chapter six is alms fasting and
[1:14:52] praying and how to pray amen these are
[1:14:55] all doctrines these are all teachings
[1:14:57] from the lord jesus christ
[1:14:59] on the sermon on the mount it's just
[1:15:00] it's overwhelming
[1:15:02] to think how much doctrine and teaching
[1:15:05] jesus christ gave us and then you see
[1:15:06] many message churches that don't want it
[1:15:08] they think they know how to or they
[1:15:10] think they don't need it and so they get
[1:15:12] lazy on god they lose their fire they
[1:15:14] are actually lukewarm because they're
[1:15:15] not born again a child of god won't grow
[1:15:17] lukewarm for very long right they'll
[1:15:19] just be lukewarm in their mind for a
[1:15:20] little while but then they repent and
[1:15:22] they get back to living from the soul
[1:15:24] praise god
[1:15:26] and also the doctrine of seeky first the
[1:15:29] kingdom of god that's a doctrine amen
[1:15:31] in matthew 6 33 and then matthew 7 the
[1:15:34] narrow way he talks about the narrow way
[1:15:36] he talks about false prophets how do you
[1:15:38] recognize false prophets that's the
[1:15:39] teaching that's a doctrine
[1:15:42] and then the anointed ones of the end
[1:15:43] times in matthew 7. many shall say to me
[1:15:45] lord lord have me not cast out devils
[1:15:47] prophesied done many wonderful works in
[1:15:49] your name he said i never knew you ye
[1:15:51] that depart or sorry you that work
[1:15:52] iniquity depart from me you that work
[1:15:54] iniquity
[1:15:55] so he even gives us the how to recognize
[1:15:57] workers of iniquity and then he closes
[1:15:59] by how do you uh how do you overcome the
[1:16:02] storms of life and he said you have to
[1:16:04] hear my word and obey it he said then
[1:16:06] you build your life upon the rock amen
[1:16:08] there it is it's like we're saying amen
[1:16:10] and then the bible says they're
[1:16:11] astonished at his teaching they're this
[1:16:13] is amazing doctrine amen
[1:16:15] so they enjoyed his his preaching as his
[1:16:18] his miracles but they also were
[1:16:19] astonished
[1:16:21] at his doctrine that taught them how to
[1:16:23] obey the commands of god how to live a
[1:16:25] life worthy of jesus christ the messiah
[1:16:28] amen
[1:16:30] it's beautiful i never set a time or so
[1:16:32] here i'm just going to
[1:16:34] finish
[1:16:36] i'm not going to close yet but just bear
[1:16:37] with me here
[1:16:38] um
[1:16:40] let's go to john 18
[1:16:44] verse 19 john 18 verse 19.
[1:16:51] jesus i believe
[1:16:55] he's in the high priest
[1:16:57] being questioned on the night of his
[1:16:59] arrest peter's outside the in the
[1:17:01] courtyard of the high priest warming his
[1:17:03] hands right before he denies christ
[1:17:05] three times
[1:17:06] and while jesus is getting questioned
[1:17:09] in verse 20 john 18 20 jesus answered i
[1:17:12] spake openly to the world
[1:17:14] how many paul's right there that's why
[1:17:16] i'm not afraid to put my sermons on
[1:17:17] youtube if jesus wasn't afraid to put
[1:17:20] his sermons out there before the world
[1:17:21] why should i be afraid
[1:17:23] right and any man that would be afraid
[1:17:25] of that that shows he don't have the
[1:17:26] confidence that christ
[1:17:28] had and i'm not saying everybody has to
[1:17:30] do youtube or anything like that but
[1:17:32] uh
[1:17:34] we should have no fear we sh because the
[1:17:35] bible said we should study ourselves
[1:17:37] that proved unto god we should have a
[1:17:38] relationship with christ where we know
[1:17:40] we've studied the word and then the holy
[1:17:42] spirit will give us confidence it's
[1:17:43] approved by god you come out and preach
[1:17:45] it i don't care who hears it because the
[1:17:47] holy spirit gave it to me i know it's
[1:17:48] vindicated by the word of god
[1:17:51] so jesus he's being arrested he said i
[1:17:53] spoke openly to the world
[1:17:55] i ever taught or gave doctrine in the
[1:17:57] synagogue ever i looked ever not just
[1:18:00] sometimes always
[1:18:02] i always taught in the synagogue you
[1:18:03] guys were always there listen to me
[1:18:05] in the temple whether the jews always
[1:18:07] resort and in secret i've said nothing
[1:18:10] praise god hallelujah
[1:18:13] why asketh thou me ask them which hear
[1:18:15] me what i've said unto them behold they
[1:18:17] know what i said
[1:18:19] so look at jesus i all the time i was
[1:18:21] always teaching doctrine i was always
[1:18:23] teaching the people of god
[1:18:24] i didn't hide nothing from anybody
[1:18:27] so that's why i don't care you know
[1:18:28] people don't like the the six reasons
[1:18:31] you know ministers marian virgins isn't
[1:18:33] the new testament i don't care if people
[1:18:34] don't like that
[1:18:35] i mean i love them i pray for them
[1:18:38] you know some people are trying to
[1:18:39] correct me on that but they won't even
[1:18:40] watch the video they won't even hear the
[1:18:42] other side it's like a judge it's like
[1:18:44] it's like they're like an unjust judge
[1:18:46] they have two different sides but they
[1:18:49] could you imagine a judge saying that
[1:18:50] well i'm going to listen to one side but
[1:18:51] i'm not going to listen other side then
[1:18:52] i'm going to make the judgment that's
[1:18:53] ridiculous that's immature that's a babe
[1:18:56] right that's a or that's a prideful or
[1:18:58] or fearful spirit
[1:19:00] right because brother man said you must
[1:19:02] take everything back to the word of god
[1:19:03] and the doctrine must go from genesis to
[1:19:05] revelation amen
[1:19:08] praise god
[1:19:10] so see the more you're in tune with the
[1:19:12] holy spirit the more bold you are with
[1:19:14] what the holy spirit showed you because
[1:19:16] you know it's vindicated by the holy
[1:19:17] spirit in your in your soul and also
[1:19:19] it's vindicated in the word of god
[1:19:22] amen jesus wasn't scared of what he what
[1:19:24] he preached and taught
[1:19:26] okay now mark 11 18 this is uh this kind
[1:19:28] of shows the reaction
[1:19:30] how are workers of iniquity
[1:19:33] and religious people going to respond to
[1:19:35] true doctrine what is their attitude
[1:19:38] going to be for to true doctrine
[1:19:44] and the scribes and the chief priests
[1:19:45] heard it and saw how they might destroy
[1:19:47] him this is mark 11 18 i'm sorry
[1:19:50] for they feared him because all the
[1:19:52] people were astonished at his what
[1:19:54] doctrine and teaching
[1:19:56] they wanted to kill jesus because his
[1:19:59] teaching and doctrine was with power
[1:20:01] praise god it was with authority in
[1:20:03] other words he would he didn't have to
[1:20:04] say it but he was in other words saying
[1:20:06] this is thus saith the lord i am the
[1:20:07] lord
[1:20:08] right i am the messiah who can convince
[1:20:10] me of sin
[1:20:12] he says search the scriptures for in you
[1:20:14] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:20:15] life and they are they which testify of
[1:20:17] me
[1:20:18] and like i've said this before i told
[1:20:20] the church
[1:20:21] the most harsh responses i have on
[1:20:23] youtube are people around the message so
[1:20:26] that shows me we got a lot of pharisees
[1:20:27] and sadducees around the message
[1:20:29] no one said worst things about me
[1:20:32] uh than people around the message
[1:20:35] uh and so that shows jesus christ the
[1:20:37] same yesterday today and forever people
[1:20:38] want to silence me or kill me or tell me
[1:20:40] to stop stop preaching or call me
[1:20:42] serpentine all these things all because
[1:20:44] i stand on the bible doctrine that's
[1:20:45] fine let them say what they want it just
[1:20:47] shows we're more like jesus the more we
[1:20:49] have his teaching and his doctrine
[1:20:51] because it came from the father amen
[1:20:54] amen hallelujah
[1:20:57] so that's why the bible said all who
[1:20:58] live godly in christ jesus shall suffer
[1:21:00] persecution
[1:21:02] or
[1:21:03] you know hateful speech
[1:21:06] and so we live above that
[1:21:08] because we have the power of jesus
[1:21:10] christ amen the love of jesus christ
[1:21:15] okay
[1:21:19] so let me finish up on
[1:21:22] jesus and doctrine
[1:21:23] and then after that i'll try to find a
[1:21:25] place to close here just just being led
[1:21:27] of the holy spirit just trying to ask
[1:21:29] the holy spirit holy spirit help me to
[1:21:31] be led of your spirit here by god's
[1:21:33] grace
[1:21:35] i want to be more mindful of the holy
[1:21:37] spirit
[1:21:38] okay so let's go to mark 1 27.
[1:21:54] again jesus cast out devils now look
[1:21:56] what mark 1 27 says and they were all
[1:21:59] amazed in so much that they questioned
[1:22:01] among themselves saying what new thing
[1:22:03] is this what new doctrine is this
[1:22:06] for with authority commandeth he even
[1:22:08] the unclean spirits and they do obey him
[1:22:13] okay so see
[1:22:15] casting out devils is a doctrine it's an
[1:22:17] instruction it's a command because jesus
[1:22:19] said only or some demons only go out by
[1:22:23] prayer and fasting
[1:22:25] so you have to follow those instructions
[1:22:27] or those doctrines in order to manifest
[1:22:30] the power of god
[1:22:31] now why can't people see that why can't
[1:22:33] everybody in the message see that you've
[1:22:35] got to follow the doctrine in order to
[1:22:36] see the power and the church said amen
[1:22:40] you have to do that
[1:22:42] or else you're not going to see some
[1:22:43] kinds of
[1:22:44] sicknesses healed thank god for the ones
[1:22:47] we have seen a lot of them in jose's
[1:22:48] family you know
[1:22:50] different ones that have been sick that
[1:22:51] god has healed miraculously we thank god
[1:22:54] and we had prayer and fasting days for
[1:22:55] those people to be healed from cancer
[1:22:59] so
[1:23:00] uh we must keep all these scriptures in
[1:23:02] mind
[1:23:06] um i just want to say this too you know
[1:23:08] uh
[1:23:08] i think i share this on the youtube
[1:23:09] video one time i went down to columbus
[1:23:11] and i preached and
[1:23:13] god healed two people miraculously one
[1:23:15] guy had a liver trouble
[1:23:18] and uh he said i just he was weeping he
[1:23:20] said he felt the fire of the holy spirit
[1:23:22] come over him and he was healed later a
[1:23:24] few years later he came back and he got
[1:23:25] sick and had a surgery but he's still
[1:23:26] alive today by the
[1:23:29] grace of god but in that moment god gave
[1:23:30] him a temporary
[1:23:33] healing by the grace of god which we're
[1:23:34] grateful for he was just praising god
[1:23:36] rejoicing his name is darian
[1:23:39] okay darian's mom in that same service
[1:23:41] got healed of
[1:23:43] back pain knee pain
[1:23:45] arthritis pain
[1:23:47] after that service she come up after me
[1:23:49] or she come up to me and she sat down
[1:23:51] she said look brother jesse i can sit
[1:23:52] down i can bend my knees i can move my
[1:23:54] knees i don't have any pain in my back i
[1:23:56] got a car accident last year i had all
[1:23:58] this pain in my back
[1:24:00] and there was another brother in that
[1:24:02] church i'm not gonna say his name uh he
[1:24:04] actually goes to different church now
[1:24:06] it was kind of comical okay but uh he
[1:24:10] went up to my wife and i was standing
[1:24:12] right there by my wife and my wife may
[1:24:13] remember this
[1:24:15] and he asked her what is it like to live
[1:24:17] with a man like brother jesse
[1:24:20] and i just started chuckling right there
[1:24:23] he was so astonished at the power of god
[1:24:27] now to me that's it just gave me a
[1:24:29] vindication as i thought about these
[1:24:30] scriptures i'm like has anyone ever yes
[1:24:32] people have said that about our ministry
[1:24:36] and uh
[1:24:37] you know we just my wife and i laughed
[1:24:39] i'm not even sure what she said i have
[1:24:40] to ask her after service you know he
[1:24:42] said what is it like to live with a man
[1:24:44] like that and i'm sure she's saying
[1:24:46] she probably say it's interesting
[1:24:49] because i'm human right i make mistakes
[1:24:50] and brother graham said you love your
[1:24:52] best and your worst at home
[1:24:54] i just want to let you know too that
[1:24:56] people have come up to me after
[1:24:58] preaching and i've heard the same thing
[1:25:00] they're just they are uh moved by the
[1:25:02] power removed by the the grace of god
[1:25:04] that they saw in the service
[1:25:06] but i know it's not me i know it's just
[1:25:08] it's a gift right we yield to the gift
[1:25:10] and then the gift manifests
[1:25:11] itself when there's people pulling on
[1:25:13] the gift of god they're hungry and
[1:25:14] thirsty for righteousness and it lines
[1:25:16] up with the timing of god
[1:25:19] okay so i always remember that related
[1:25:20] to this
[1:25:22] um
[1:25:23] we already read luke 4 same same thing
[1:25:26] the doctrine had power to it
[1:25:30] um
[1:25:33] okay yeah now let's go to the the great
[1:25:35] commission so
[1:25:37] we already read let's go to matthew 28
[1:25:39] 19. we're going to just focus on jesus's
[1:25:42] ministry here today
[1:25:47] because that should be a good
[1:25:50] twice church twice jesus says teach them
[1:25:54] in the great commission i remember
[1:25:55] brother graham said he didn't say teach
[1:25:56] but remember got to go back to the bible
[1:25:59] i'm not disregarding brother brandon
[1:26:00] he's still prophet of god he's the
[1:26:01] church age messenger seven church age
[1:26:03] messenger he's elijah he had the elijah
[1:26:05] spirit but he's human
[1:26:07] and we have to rightly divide the word
[1:26:09] of truth
[1:26:11] so verse 19 go you therefore and what
[1:26:13] teach
[1:26:14] all nations
[1:26:16] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:26:17] of the holy ghost which is lord jesus
[1:26:18] christ acts 2 38 now look at verse 20
[1:26:20] doing what teaching them
[1:26:23] to observe
[1:26:25] all things whatsoever i commanded you
[1:26:27] and lo
[1:26:29] i'm with you even to the end of the
[1:26:30] world so church if i know i'm trying to
[1:26:32] teach you and i you and i all of us on
[1:26:35] how to obey god better how to enter into
[1:26:38] our gifts and our callings if i'm if i
[1:26:41] know i'm trying to teach you how to do
[1:26:43] that then i know christ is with me
[1:26:45] because he said teach all the commands
[1:26:47] i'll teach him all the commands until i
[1:26:49] return and lo i'm with you even to the
[1:26:51] end of the world
[1:26:53] praise god hallelujah
[1:26:56] so see it was teach all nations so all
[1:26:58] nations need the teaching gift or the
[1:27:00] doctrinal
[1:27:01] uh truths of god's word
[1:27:05] now one thing i forgot was in the book
[1:27:06] of acts remember when paul
[1:27:08] paul smote elimus blind you remember
[1:27:11] that he was trying to stop the deputy
[1:27:13] from hearing the message of the hour
[1:27:14] right and so paul said you'll be blind
[1:27:16] for a season and the deputy's like i
[1:27:18] believe he said i'm astonished at your
[1:27:20] doctrine remember that
[1:27:22] see this there there it again there it
[1:27:24] is again jesus they were astonished at
[1:27:25] jesus doctrine they're astonished at
[1:27:27] paul's doctrine people should be
[1:27:28] astonished in our doctrine as well today
[1:27:31] as it manifests through signs wonders
[1:27:33] and miracles
[1:27:35] now there's going to be times when
[1:27:36] people come to church and there's no
[1:27:37] miracles right
[1:27:38] just like jesus when jesus was on the
[1:27:39] cross they said physician healed thyself
[1:27:41] and he didn't do it
[1:27:43] also when jesus was in
[1:27:45] his hometown nazareth or was it
[1:27:46] capernaum the bible said he could not do
[1:27:49] many mighty works because of their
[1:27:50] unbelief
[1:27:53] praise god amen so there's times
[1:27:55] people's unbelief hinders and we saw
[1:27:57] that with aiken right one person's
[1:27:58] unbelief could hinder the move of god
[1:28:01] that's why we always have to come to
[1:28:02] church prayed up right and repenting of
[1:28:04] our sins and believing god's word
[1:28:08] and so there's divine appointments god
[1:28:10] has to do supernatural signs wonders and
[1:28:12] miracles manifest his power
[1:28:16] and we must be ready at all times for
[1:28:18] god to move in those seasons
[1:28:21] where vessels meet from the masters used
[1:28:23] praise god constantly cleaned out
[1:28:24] constantly uh looking for god to move in
[1:28:27] our lives who would have thought god's
[1:28:29] holy fire would have burned down through
[1:28:30] austin on that one sermon when everybody
[1:28:33] else was sick with coven but yet stephen
[1:28:34] and our families there and austin alina
[1:28:36] but that's the service where god's
[1:28:38] burning fire came into brother austin he
[1:28:40] felt the power of god cleaning him out
[1:28:41] praise god i mean just you don't know
[1:28:43] and then how about that wednesday night
[1:28:44] sermon where god gave brother austin the
[1:28:46] financial
[1:28:47] victory by god's grace you never know
[1:28:49] you never know it's gonna be saturday
[1:28:50] night sunday night remember on that
[1:28:52] sunday night service when cam preached
[1:28:53] the wind blew through the wall and
[1:28:55] struck sisterhood and she got instantly
[1:28:56] healed from that flu
[1:28:58] praise god you never know the wind blows
[1:29:01] where it blows but we got to keep laying
[1:29:02] in the doctrine laying in the warnings
[1:29:04] laying in the prophecy laying in the
[1:29:05] teaching preach the word of god
[1:29:08] and when souls are ready to receive it
[1:29:10] god will move but it's god it has to
[1:29:12] line up with god's timing as well amen
[1:29:14] now this matthew 28 getting back to
[1:29:16] matthew 28 was the great commission
[1:29:19] he said teach teach teach all nations
[1:29:22] now there's also the great commission in
[1:29:24] mark 16 so go there
[1:29:30] verse 15
[1:29:31] mark 16 15.
[1:29:33] now this is what brother brahm i think
[1:29:35] was referring to when he said jesus said
[1:29:37] go preach don't teach right but we know
[1:29:39] jesus also said teach
[1:29:43] yes this is it right because you use the
[1:29:44] word preach verse 15. he said to them go
[1:29:46] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:29:49] to every creature he that believeth is
[1:29:50] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:29:52] believeth not shall be damned
[1:29:55] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:29:56] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:29:58] devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:30:00] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:30:01] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:30:03] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:30:05] and they shall recover
[1:30:07] so so then after the lord had spoken to
[1:30:09] them he was received up into heaven and
[1:30:10] sat on the right hand of god and they
[1:30:12] went forth and preached everywhere the
[1:30:14] lord working with them and confirming
[1:30:16] the word with signs
[1:30:18] following so that's how i looked at it
[1:30:21] you know that's one way to look at it
[1:30:22] too you teach and you preach and you do
[1:30:24] the doctrine and then god will vindicate
[1:30:26] it with supernatural
[1:30:27] or there's times god will just speak
[1:30:29] supernatural things just speak
[1:30:32] i declare this you're going to be healed
[1:30:33] in jesus name and this it's just
[1:30:34] supernatural it's a declaration of the
[1:30:36] preaching of god's word amen amen
[1:30:40] all right
[1:30:42] now let's see how jesus warns about
[1:30:44] doctrine and then i'll try to find a
[1:30:45] place to close okay so
[1:30:47] let's have some readers here lydia
[1:30:48] matthew 15 9 acacia matthew 16 12
[1:30:53] and um haven mark 12 38.
[1:30:58] so matthew 15 9 matthew 16 12.
[1:31:02] and mark 12 38 for haven
[1:31:08] whenever you're ready lydia these are
[1:31:09] jesus's warnings about false doctrine
[1:31:13] but in vain do they worship me teaching
[1:31:15] for doctrines the commandments of men
[1:31:18] amen
[1:31:19] so jesus says the pharisees actually
[1:31:21] scribes they taught doctrines of men
[1:31:24] commands of men and in context
[1:31:26] here's another doctrine maybe you didn't
[1:31:28] know this there's a doctrine on how to
[1:31:29] take care of your parents when they get
[1:31:30] old
[1:31:31] this is for me my wife sister naomi
[1:31:34] brother wesley
[1:31:36] bang you know amen who anyone who's got
[1:31:39] parents that are getting kind of elderly
[1:31:41] here's a doctrine
[1:31:42] and their doctrine was oh you don't have
[1:31:44] to take care of your parents just give
[1:31:45] the money you're going to take your
[1:31:47] parents with give that to the temple and
[1:31:48] that's okay that's raqqa right that's
[1:31:50] okay raka
[1:31:51] and jesus said no that's a doctrine of
[1:31:53] man
[1:31:54] that is not a doctrine and that's vain
[1:31:56] worship in other words god is not
[1:31:57] receiving that offering
[1:31:59] god is not receiving that money
[1:32:02] you've robbed from god right you rob you
[1:32:03] robbed god because you robbed your
[1:32:05] parents
[1:32:06] see
[1:32:07] that's doctrine
[1:32:09] i hope this just gives us a great
[1:32:10] understanding on our lives almost
[1:32:12] everything we do as if it's a how-to
[1:32:14] it's doctrine
[1:32:17] acacia matthew 16 12.
[1:32:20] then i understood they how that he made
[1:32:23] them
[1:32:24] not beware of the leaven of bread but of
[1:32:27] the doctrine of the pharisees and of the
[1:32:29] sadducees
[1:32:31] amen praise god
[1:32:32] so that would be a whole other sermon to
[1:32:34] go through all the false doctrines the
[1:32:36] pharisees and sadducees held
[1:32:39] right sadducees didn't believe in a
[1:32:40] resurrection right
[1:32:42] so that that influenced how they lived
[1:32:44] right so that was a doctrine as well
[1:32:47] because there's no resurrection we'll
[1:32:48] just live this certain way right this
[1:32:49] this is how we're going to live our
[1:32:51] lives right
[1:32:53] and of course the pharisees would make
[1:32:55] broad their phylacteries and all their
[1:32:56] how-to on how to pray long prayers in
[1:32:58] the temple you know those were all false
[1:33:00] doctrines that's not how a christian
[1:33:01] that's not how a believer a christian
[1:33:03] should have lived their life right
[1:33:05] so their their false doctrine was 11 and
[1:33:07] 11 is always said in the bible
[1:33:10] so you'll find this true doctrine is
[1:33:12] god's bread amen false doctrine is
[1:33:16] corrupted bread right
[1:33:18] it's leaven
[1:33:19] so true god's true doctrine is
[1:33:21] unleavened bread
[1:33:23] right and pharisee doctrine is leaven
[1:33:25] bread
[1:33:26] in haven mark 12 38
[1:33:29] and he said unto them in his doctrine
[1:33:33] beware of the scribes which love to go
[1:33:35] in long clothing and love solutions in
[1:33:37] the marketplace all right the
[1:33:39] salutations right here was that what it
[1:33:40] was
[1:33:41] thank you
[1:33:43] so even those doctrines the doctrines of
[1:33:45] the pharisees and how you would greet
[1:33:47] them in the see how how you would
[1:33:49] instruct them this is how you greet us
[1:33:51] in the marketplace this is how you treat
[1:33:52] one another that's how to that's
[1:33:54] doctrine
[1:33:56] she said beware of the scribes beware of
[1:33:58] their false doctrine
[1:34:00] so in other words false doctrine is
[1:34:02] doctrine jesus hates we also see this in
[1:34:05] revelation 2 verses 14 and 15. i'm going
[1:34:08] to read that revelation 2
[1:34:10] 14 and 15
[1:34:13] jesus hates the doctrine of the
[1:34:14] nicolaitans
[1:34:17] and for austin alina nicolaitans means
[1:34:19] conquering the laity
[1:34:22] so
[1:34:23] satan's uh the way satan corrupts the
[1:34:25] church is by conquering the laity making
[1:34:27] them feel like they don't have any holy
[1:34:29] spirit they don't have any gifts it's
[1:34:31] all in the preachers right
[1:34:32] that's how satan conquers churches so we
[1:34:35] have to remember everybody has a gift
[1:34:36] everybody has a calling from god
[1:34:38] everybody has to be faithful though with
[1:34:39] that ministry and pray and seek god and
[1:34:42] understand how they can be
[1:34:44] used by god in their gifts
[1:34:47] for ministry everybody has a ministry
[1:34:49] not just the preacher
[1:34:52] okay so jesus says in revelation 2 14
[1:34:54] and 15 but i have a few things against
[1:34:56] thee because thou has
[1:34:58] there them that hold the doctrine of
[1:34:59] balaam who taught balak to cast a
[1:35:02] stumbling block before the children of
[1:35:03] israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[1:35:05] idols so idolatry and to commit
[1:35:08] fornication so hast thou also them that
[1:35:10] hold the doctrine the nicolaitans which
[1:35:13] i hate
[1:35:15] so see god hates
[1:35:17] when uh only preachers have the
[1:35:19] anointing on them god wants everybody to
[1:35:21] have the anointing on them praise god
[1:35:24] god hates any preacher that would do
[1:35:25] that that would just say oh we're the
[1:35:26] holy ones you're not
[1:35:28] right that's that's like in the
[1:35:29] catholicism right because the
[1:35:31] the priest has the ability to turn that
[1:35:32] bread and wine into the literal body of
[1:35:34] christ called transubstantiation that's
[1:35:36] a lie from hell you don't have that
[1:35:38] power to do that
[1:35:39] they're just symbols
[1:35:41] but they they believe those lies they
[1:35:43] propagate those lies and spread them
[1:35:44] around the world
[1:35:46] and also fornication would be a false
[1:35:48] doctrine jesus hates the teaching that's
[1:35:50] okay to fornicate before marriage or of
[1:35:52] course adultery or homosexuality
[1:35:55] anything all that can be lumped in there
[1:35:57] and then eating sacrifice to idols in
[1:35:59] other words have any association with
[1:36:01] idolatry which for us many times is
[1:36:03] money uh family like we had a chur or a
[1:36:06] family that left our church a few years
[1:36:08] ago and they told me
[1:36:09] family was always first before god in
[1:36:11] church they admitted that they've been
[1:36:13] the message 40 years but they admitted
[1:36:15] that family was always first and they
[1:36:18] knew that was wrong
[1:36:19] so that's a that's an idol family became
[1:36:21] an idol to them
[1:36:23] okay brother branham can become an idol
[1:36:24] you make every word he says thus saith
[1:36:26] the lord that becomes an idol sports is
[1:36:28] a big thing i always harp on that right
[1:36:30] cell phone addiction you know that could
[1:36:32] be an idol when you go to your phone
[1:36:33] more than you go to god you know
[1:36:36] so these are all doctrines that jesus
[1:36:38] hates
[1:36:39] all right and then um
[1:36:42] revelation 2 24.
[1:36:45] so the next church age the thyroid here
[1:36:46] in church age verse 24 jesus said but
[1:36:50] unto you i say and unto the rest of
[1:36:52] thyatira as many as have not this
[1:36:54] doctrine and which have not the depth
[1:36:57] not known the depths of satan as they
[1:36:59] speak i will put upon you none other
[1:37:02] burden
[1:37:04] okay
[1:37:05] so the doctrine of the depths of jezebel
[1:37:08] so the depths of jezebel is basically
[1:37:10] the mature form of catholicism
[1:37:13] living by doctrines of men and
[1:37:14] crucifying the effects of the holy ghost
[1:37:17] in a church that's the depths of satan
[1:37:18] that's the depths of jezebel
[1:37:20] in other words being ruled by
[1:37:22] denomination rather than the holy ghost
[1:37:23] does everybody understand that that
[1:37:24] god's great exam okay
[1:37:26] so it starts with sayings then it goes
[1:37:28] deeds then it goes doctrine to balaam
[1:37:31] then it goes uh the doctrine of jezebel
[1:37:34] the depths of jezebel jezebel religion
[1:37:36] okay so that's the progression of the
[1:37:38] four first horses right in the in the
[1:37:40] first four seals
[1:37:41] that's the progression
[1:37:44] okay
[1:37:45] so that's there's doctrine jesus loves
[1:37:47] that's the father's doctrine that he
[1:37:49] gives and it empowers the believers who
[1:37:51] obey it but he hates the doctrines of
[1:37:53] devils
[1:37:54] of course
[1:37:56] okay so let me uh
[1:38:00] let me close with what i had told you
[1:38:02] okay so uh john 6 45 john 6 45.
[1:38:12] i'm going to close with a quote here
[1:38:14] from brother branham
[1:38:19] thank you
[1:38:20] thank you for staying with me
[1:38:22] still got seven people live streaming so
[1:38:24] praise god hope that's all the families
[1:38:25] in the church you know about god's grace
[1:38:28] uh
[1:38:29] this is where i want to get to at the
[1:38:30] end
[1:38:33] and like i said this is a huge this is a
[1:38:35] major subject here i don't know how many
[1:38:37] sermons i got out of this but i want to
[1:38:38] just focus on this the power of jesus's
[1:38:40] doctrine because it's the power we're
[1:38:42] supposed to be restored back to what
[1:38:44] paul's doctrine right
[1:38:45] brother ramsay said i preached what paul
[1:38:47] preached well who taught more doctrine
[1:38:48] than anybody in the new testament it was
[1:38:50] paul
[1:38:51] paul you could argue jesus too so paul
[1:38:53] and jesus but where did paul get his
[1:38:54] doctrine from jesus
[1:38:57] we're supposed to say the same thing
[1:38:59] paul said we better know the man who
[1:39:00] gave us all this doctrine
[1:39:04] but the church age book let's show this
[1:39:05] how
[1:39:06] learning doctrine and being taught by
[1:39:08] god is proof you're born again
[1:39:12] it's absolute proof
[1:39:20] so let me read this quote
[1:39:23] can you read that uh john 6 45 that was
[1:39:25] our text but i want to just listen to it
[1:39:26] again here
[1:39:28] it is written in the prophets and they
[1:39:31] shall be taught all and they shall be
[1:39:34] all taught of god
[1:39:36] every man therefore that hath heard and
[1:39:38] hath word of the father cometh unto me
[1:39:42] thank you
[1:39:44] all that the all the father has called
[1:39:46] all god's children will come to him and
[1:39:48] they'll all sit at his feet and learn
[1:39:50] from him
[1:39:51] okay
[1:39:52] now brother man says this is chapter
[1:39:54] four on the church facebook
[1:39:57] as we talk about who it is that is
[1:39:59] baptized with the holy ghost see what
[1:40:01] jesus says
[1:40:02] in john 6 45 okay she just read it it's
[1:40:05] written the prophets they shall all be
[1:40:07] taught of god
[1:40:09] but if you turn to isaiah 54 13
[1:40:12] it reads and all thy children shall be
[1:40:15] taught of the lord so see
[1:40:18] in the gospel the word children was left
[1:40:20] out right
[1:40:23] so brother rahm says he says look all
[1:40:25] the all of god are the children of god
[1:40:29] thus it is
[1:40:31] that the evidence of being a true child
[1:40:33] of god
[1:40:34] he whom the spirit has come upon and
[1:40:36] indwells
[1:40:37] is again set forth as one taught the
[1:40:40] word
[1:40:41] by the holy ghost
[1:40:44] now you can begin to see why tongues is
[1:40:46] not the evidence of being baptized with
[1:40:48] the holy ghost it doesn't say in the
[1:40:50] church ages that he that hath a tongue
[1:40:52] let him say what the spirit's saying
[1:40:54] i love that quote
[1:40:55] hallelujah that puts tongues
[1:40:57] interpretation prophecy etc aside as the
[1:41:01] evidence
[1:41:02] the evidence is hearing what the spirit
[1:41:04] says the spirit is talking he says yes
[1:41:07] the spirit is teaching
[1:41:09] that's exactly what jesus said he would
[1:41:11] do when he comes in john 14 26 he will
[1:41:13] teach you all things and bring all
[1:41:15] things to your remembrance whatsoever
[1:41:17] i've said unto you and that is just what
[1:41:19] happened that is how the gospels were
[1:41:21] written
[1:41:24] he said this is how paul received his
[1:41:26] revelations
[1:41:27] he said
[1:41:28] in galatians 1 verse 11 and 12 but i
[1:41:31] certify you brethren that the gospel
[1:41:32] which was preached of me is not after
[1:41:34] man for i neither received it of man
[1:41:36] neither was i taught it of man but by
[1:41:39] the revelation of jesus christ paul was
[1:41:41] taught by jesus christ who is the holy
[1:41:44] ghost amen praise god
[1:41:46] and brother ram says and to every age we
[1:41:48] see we hear the same truth he that hath
[1:41:51] an ear
[1:41:52] let him hear what the spirit sayeth to
[1:41:54] the churches now you know the word here
[1:41:56] just doesn't mean to audibly receive it
[1:41:58] it means to obey it
[1:42:00] right hear o israel the lord our god is
[1:42:02] one lord that doesn't mean just here
[1:42:04] he's one that means believe he's one and
[1:42:06] keep all the other false gods out of
[1:42:08] your life
[1:42:08] right
[1:42:09] have no other gods before me that's what
[1:42:11] the word here means so he he that hath
[1:42:14] an ear let him obey in other words hear
[1:42:16] what the spirit obey what the spirit
[1:42:19] says to the churches
[1:42:21] brotherhood says this your prophet my
[1:42:23] prophet said but only a spirit-filled
[1:42:25] man can hear the revelation of that age
[1:42:28] oh hallelujah
[1:42:30] none other can
[1:42:31] no sir they cannot because that's
[1:42:33] exactly what paul said
[1:42:35] in 1st corinthians 2
[1:42:37] 6 through 16. i'm not going to read all
[1:42:38] that we'll have to pick that up next
[1:42:40] time
[1:42:41] here's the second to last quote
[1:42:44] this is the last quote last one i'm
[1:42:46] going to do do one scripture after that
[1:42:49] brother said did you get that last
[1:42:51] thought it's about he that hath an ear
[1:42:53] let him hear the spirit says the
[1:42:54] churches
[1:42:55] every church age ends with that same
[1:42:58] admonition
[1:43:00] the spirit gives the word the spirit has
[1:43:03] the truth for the age
[1:43:05] each age has its own elect that elect
[1:43:07] group always heard the word and received
[1:43:10] it proving they had the seed in them
[1:43:14] hallelujah so when you receive the word
[1:43:16] and you obey it that proves you have
[1:43:17] that seed you read that proves when you
[1:43:19] obey it it proves you got it
[1:43:21] see satan will never obey all the word
[1:43:22] of god that proves you don't have the
[1:43:24] seed right here you don't obey anything
[1:43:27] this is what god forces him to do you
[1:43:28] know he's got to present himself before
[1:43:29] the lord you know
[1:43:31] but he don't obey the doctrine you don't
[1:43:32] may the teaching of god
[1:43:36] john 8 47 said he that is of god heareth
[1:43:39] god's words
[1:43:41] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[1:43:43] are not of god
[1:43:45] they refuse the word jesus and his words
[1:43:48] for their days but the true seed receive
[1:43:51] the word because they were of god
[1:43:54] brother branham again cites isaiah 50 4
[1:43:57] 13 and all thy children shall be caught
[1:44:00] of shall be taught of god the holy
[1:44:02] spirit
[1:44:03] jesus said the same thing in john 6 45
[1:44:05] being one with the word proves whether
[1:44:07] you are of god and spirit filled he says
[1:44:10] no other criterion in other words
[1:44:12] there's no other requirement
[1:44:14] the requirement is hearing the word and
[1:44:16] obeying the word of god
[1:44:18] but what are tongues and interpretations
[1:44:20] and other gifts they are manifestations
[1:44:22] that's what the word teaches
[1:44:24] first corinthians 12 7 says but the
[1:44:26] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:44:28] every man to prophet with all
[1:44:30] then paul names those manifestations
[1:44:35] so in closing
[1:44:38] you are a child of god when you can be
[1:44:40] taught of the holy ghost if the holy
[1:44:41] ghost can preach to you the words of god
[1:44:43] out of here
[1:44:44] through me and through any other
[1:44:46] fivefold ministry preacher that proves
[1:44:48] you're a child of god if you don't that
[1:44:50] proves you're not a child of god
[1:44:52] so may god give you a a heart
[1:44:54] that wants to obey the bible says they
[1:44:57] obeyed from the heart every sound
[1:44:59] doctrine praise god the bible says that
[1:45:02] so may we have a heart a good and honest
[1:45:04] heart that can receive all the commands
[1:45:06] of god all the doctrine all the teaching
[1:45:07] of god
[1:45:09] water those seeds and they'll bring
[1:45:10] forth the manifestation their time
[1:45:13] in closing the people that go to hell
[1:45:15] did not learn from jesus
[1:45:18] right
[1:45:18] they would not be taught by the holy
[1:45:20] ghost revelation 21 said the fearful
[1:45:24] went to hell that means they couldn't
[1:45:25] learn
[1:45:26] to have the the spirit of power love and
[1:45:29] a sound mind
[1:45:30] they refused to be tall i'm just going
[1:45:32] to be fearful so they went to hell
[1:45:34] the unbelieving
[1:45:36] i'm not going to believe in god i'm not
[1:45:37] going to believe in jesus christ i'm not
[1:45:38] going to listen to him they receive they
[1:45:40] refuse faith they couldn't be taught to
[1:45:42] have faith
[1:45:45] the abominable the disgusting they
[1:45:47] couldn't learn that homosexuality is
[1:45:49] disgusting or bestiality
[1:45:51] they couldn't learn that cross-dressing
[1:45:53] they couldn't learn transgenderism is
[1:45:55] abomination the side of god they
[1:45:56] couldn't learn it they didn't want to
[1:45:58] learn it right yeah
[1:46:00] murderers
[1:46:01] went to hell because they wouldn't learn
[1:46:03] about forgiveness and how to repent from
[1:46:05] hatred and how to repent from wrath
[1:46:08] they couldn't learn it
[1:46:09] they would not be taught by the holy
[1:46:11] spirit how to love and forgive
[1:46:13] and pour coals upon the head of your
[1:46:15] enemy praise god right
[1:46:17] be kind to your enemy love your enemies
[1:46:18] bless those who
[1:46:20] bless those who persecute you rather
[1:46:23] whoremongers
[1:46:25] which is any sexual sin
[1:46:27] right they couldn't learn of the holy
[1:46:29] spirit how to control their sexual
[1:46:31] passions
[1:46:32] so they went to hell they didn't want to
[1:46:34] learn
[1:46:35] how to be temper right and control they
[1:46:37] couldn't they wouldn't learn that that
[1:46:38] anointing of the holy ghost temperance
[1:46:41] sorcerers demonic which is demonic
[1:46:43] powers
[1:46:44] they wouldn't learn to avoid the occult
[1:46:46] right and all the pleasures satan offers
[1:46:48] for a season they didn't realize or they
[1:46:50] didn't want god's pleasure they knew
[1:46:51] god's pleasures were there but they
[1:46:52] didn't want god's pleasure they couldn't
[1:46:54] learn to get pleasure in serving the
[1:46:56] lord in the house of god amen
[1:46:59] but thank god we got it hallelujah amen
[1:47:02] idolaters go to hell the bible says
[1:47:04] they couldn't learn to worship the one
[1:47:06] and only deity they wanted to draw
[1:47:08] strength and they wanted to look at
[1:47:09] something else rather than have faith in
[1:47:11] the one true god they couldn't learn
[1:47:14] that there's only one god they couldn't
[1:47:16] learn that i'm not talking about
[1:47:17] trinitarians they can still be saved
[1:47:19] unless they go
[1:47:20] unless they go really far and they
[1:47:21] really do believe in three gods then
[1:47:22] they're then they are lost
[1:47:25] but if they're just ignorant they can be
[1:47:27] saved
[1:47:29] so idolaters you know they make money
[1:47:30] their god as we said any any person that
[1:47:32] would refuse to learn that god is the
[1:47:34] real provider of money amen god is a
[1:47:36] real provider
[1:47:37] of every good and perfect gift that we
[1:47:39] have need of
[1:47:40] and so they served other gods rather
[1:47:42] than god they go to hell because they
[1:47:43] wouldn't learn they wouldn't be taught
[1:47:45] the truth
[1:47:48] and all liars that's the last one that
[1:47:50] lists there
[1:47:51] they wouldn't learn how to be honest
[1:47:54] they wouldn't learn how to just tell the
[1:47:55] truth like it is every time
[1:47:58] and so jesus sends all liars he has to
[1:48:02] judge all liars are unworthy of
[1:48:04] everlasting life because they wouldn't
[1:48:06] be taught of god the bible said they
[1:48:08] shall have their part in the lake which
[1:48:09] burneth with fire and brimstone which is
[1:48:11] the second death but all god's children
[1:48:15] are taught of god
[1:48:16] you are of god because you hear god's
[1:48:20] word
[1:48:20] let's stand to our feet praise god amen
[1:48:32] hope that was a blessing saints my just
[1:48:34] it's just a beautiful topic a beautiful
[1:48:37] subject i

[1:49:44] was astonished at our doctor
[1:49:46] he couldn't believe how people could
[1:49:48] preach such things and live such things

[1:49:52] out of the house if he preached such
[1:49:53] things as i was preaching so thank you
