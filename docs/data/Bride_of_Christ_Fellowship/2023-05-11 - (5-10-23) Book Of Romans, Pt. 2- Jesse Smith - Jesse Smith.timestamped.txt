[21:54] God
[21:56] and see how your spirit will move us
[21:57] here
[21:59] all the praise the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:06] on the book of Romans here
[22:10] Romans chapter 1.
[22:12] verse 13 is where we like to start
[22:22] Romans 1 13.
[22:31] it's 113 by God's grace
[22:41] Romans 1 13.
[22:45] I'm thankful to see sister Beatrice
[22:47] tonight let's give her a round of
[22:48] applause praise God
[22:52] we miss you sister God
[22:54] find out Friday is that right
[22:59] well Friday's going to be a sad day for
[23:01] us but
[23:02] it's gonna be a safe day of travel for
[23:04] you by God's grace Romans chapter one
[23:08] start at verse 13 Lord willingness last
[23:11] Wednesday night we ended with verse 12.
[23:15] how Paul desired to establish the people
[23:18] with some spiritual gift and now he
[23:20] moves in here past this is kind of the
[23:23] introduction of the book and then
[23:25] we'll see how chapter one unfolds
[23:27] remember this book was of course to
[23:29] minister to the Jews and Gentiles in
[23:32] Rome
[23:33] and all the differences that have kind
[23:34] of been uh
[23:37] started between them because of the
[23:39] absence of the Jews for five years
[23:41] but we looked at that last week so let's
[23:43] just read verse
[23:45] 13.
[23:46] why don't I read 13 and then we'll read
[23:49] 14 together 14 is really striking in one
[23:51] way
[23:52] Paul calls himself a debtor
[23:54] he owed the people
[23:57] interesting the way Paul approached his
[23:59] ministry verse 13 now I would not have
[24:02] you ignorant Brethren that often times I
[24:04] purpose to come unto you but was let
[24:07] hitherto
[24:09] that I might have some fruit among you
[24:12] also even as among other Gentiles he
[24:16] tells them don't forget that I come to
[24:18] you and had fruit among you and look at
[24:21] verse 14. let's read that together one
[24:22] two three I am a debtor both to the
[24:25] Greeks and to The Barbarians both to the
[24:28] wise and to the unwise amen may God as
[24:31] blessings work you may be seated
[24:35] Lord willing will look to this thought
[24:37] here tonight
[24:42] trust us this will be a blessing here uh
[24:44] we're looking into the
[24:46] introduction here we've seen some
[24:48] beautiful scriptures here as we've been
[24:50] looking at this
[24:52] verse 5 is what I use we had a prayer at
[24:54] the pole last Thursday
[24:56] morning at Arrowhead and I invited about
[24:59] 20 families guess how many showed up one
[25:02] so maybe they were busy that morning but
[25:05] I'm not going to be discouraged praise
[25:06] God if I'm the only one out there I'm
[25:08] going to pray to Jesus for our school
[25:09] praise God
[25:10] so we're thankful but verse five stuck
[25:13] out to me because it said we've received
[25:15] Grace for the obedience to the faith
[25:18] among all nations
[25:20] Christ wants all nations he wants and
[25:22] he's going to have Believers in every
[25:24] nation
[25:25] and they're going to obey his voice and
[25:28] so we're thankful that we can obey the
[25:29] voice of the Lord tonight praise God and
[25:32] walk with the Lord hallelujah
[25:34] and we saw of course you know we ended
[25:36] with how we serve god with our spirits
[25:38] and then
[25:40] Paul his greatest desire was that he
[25:42] could give some people a spiritual gift
[25:45] some spiritual blessing
[25:47] from the word of God that was his desire
[25:49] and that's I think that's our all of our
[25:51] desires tonight church I want to be more
[25:53] mindful to remember than the service to
[25:54] see if anyone has a leading of the Lord
[25:57] brother or sister preacher or
[25:59] non-breacher
[26:00] if anyone has a leading of the Lord to
[26:02] share a word or to pray for someone or
[26:04] whatever
[26:06] Direction you'd feel led by the Holy
[26:08] Spirit sometimes I forget about that but
[26:09] I want to remember to do that
[26:11] because I'm not the only one led by the
[26:13] Holy Spirit I believe there's a lot of
[26:15] people led by the holy spirit in here
[26:16] praise God because your lives prove it
[26:19] because you stay true to the word of God
[26:21] so I'm going to remember that and the
[26:23] fact that everybody has a leading of the
[26:24] Lord when they are in obedience to God's
[26:27] word amen so we want to look at verse
[26:30] 13. now here at 13 we're just start
[26:32] preaching here by God's grace
[26:35] Paul Paul said that I might have some
[26:37] fruit among you so again we see he once
[26:40] he wants to establish them with gifts
[26:42] Paul wants to see God move in the church
[26:44] so that they're stronger in the faith
[26:47] Hallelujah and I believe you know God
[26:49] has kept our church strong in the faith
[26:51] praise God the only reason someone would
[26:53] not be strong in the faith is because
[26:55] they don't obey what the word of God
[26:56] says right because the word of God is
[26:59] preached I believe it's preaching it's
[27:00] Clarity I believe it's preaching it's
[27:03] Purity praise God and the Bible said
[27:05] when you receive the word it's the
[27:07] engrafted word of God you're connected
[27:09] to the word of God and the word of God
[27:11] is a life-giving resource
[27:13] how many spoke to the rock this week
[27:15] praise God hallelujah amen thank God and
[27:18] the words I do that gives us life when
[27:20] we pray when we make our our requests to
[27:22] run to God we're speaking to the Rock
[27:24] and we know the rock brings forth water
[27:26] praise God
[27:27] the the water comes forth from Christ
[27:29] the spirit comes forth from Christ and
[27:32] we're strengthened in the grace of God
[27:33] hallelujah now 14 is what just was
[27:36] interesting to me uh it just again shows
[27:38] Paul's thoughts here I am a debtor both
[27:41] to the Greeks and The Barbarians so
[27:43] Greeks were educated heathens and
[27:45] barbarians were just uneducated heathens
[27:48] he says I am a debtor to both of them
[27:51] isn't that interesting a debtor now the
[27:54] word debtor means someone who's not yet
[27:57] made amends with someone who's he's
[27:59] injured or one who owes a penalty
[28:02] uh and wants to pay that or someone who
[28:05] owes something so Paul looked at his
[28:07] ministry like I owe it
[28:09] uh to the Heathen to go to the Heathen I
[28:12] owe it to the to the educated to go to
[28:14] the educated
[28:16] right he looked at it like that it's my
[28:19] service it's my duty to go preach to
[28:22] them I owe them something praise God in
[28:24] church if we can look at it like that in
[28:25] a in a Godly way now not not a slavery
[28:28] way not a uh not a well I'm obligated by
[28:32] you know a bad attitude or something
[28:34] like that but I'm here to serve Christ
[28:36] and it's it's my joy to serve other
[28:39] people praise God he said I see myself
[28:41] as a debtor to the Heathen to the
[28:43] educated and of course he'll say to the
[28:46] Jews as well verse 15. so as much as is
[28:49] in me is I am ready to preach the gospel
[28:53] to you that are at Rome also so you say
[28:56] I'm ready to go anywhere I want to
[28:57] preach you in Rome I want to be I want
[28:59] to come to Rome but I'm ready to go to
[29:00] The Barbarians I'm ready to go to the
[29:03] educated colleges now look at that
[29:05] that's a real humble servant right there
[29:08] I can go down and go to the universities
[29:10] I admire those guys now there's not not
[29:11] a lot of message guys to do it but I
[29:13] admire the preachers that go down to
[29:14] universities
[29:15] I've seen him before when I was in
[29:17] college I was like wow this guy's got a
[29:18] lot of Courage I thought boy I would
[29:20] never have all those answers right on
[29:21] the top of my head like that but all
[29:23] these questions from these Sunday school
[29:24] kids probably get me ready by God's
[29:25] grace or maybe someone ready the thing
[29:28] to do though I feel I really feel the
[29:30] leading of I would need the Holy Spirit
[29:32] to have the scriptures to be able to
[29:34] come to my remembrance I would need for
[29:35] God to prove to me that it's right there
[29:37] you know I've invested enough time in
[29:39] the word of God to be able to point to
[29:40] the scripture because I I can't be like
[29:42] hey wait I need a few seconds let me
[29:43] look up this verse you know I wouldn't
[29:45] you it takes a special gift it really
[29:47] does it takes a special anointing to do
[29:49] things like that and of course that's a
[29:51] burden that's a Ministry someone would
[29:53] have but I admire that I really do
[29:54] admire that like Ray comfort and
[29:56] different ones like that they don't have
[29:57] the Full Gospel but I'm I admire men
[29:59] like that that'll go stand there in the
[30:01] public and stand for Christ I believe
[30:03] God Honors that
[30:04] praise God now verse 16.
[30:07] how many times have we used this in our
[30:09] testimony for I'm not ashamed of the
[30:11] gospel of Christ
[30:12] so I'll go to the Jew I'll go to the
[30:14] Gentile I'll go to the Barbarian I'll go
[30:15] to the educated College University
[30:17] because I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[30:19] Christ it's the power of God unto
[30:21] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[30:24] the Jew first and also to the Greek
[30:26] Hallelujah I believe it's the power of
[30:28] God
[30:29] see that's what many churches lack and
[30:31] we've got to make sure that we keep
[30:32] trusting in the power of God in our
[30:34] church amen you can't let down on the
[30:36] power of God we've got to have power and
[30:38] we got to have character amen we've got
[30:40] to have both praise God we've got to
[30:42] have the teaching and we've got to have
[30:43] the power Hallelujah
[30:45] that's what we need by the grace of God
[30:46] Amen this is the power of the god unto
[30:48] me he says unto salvation Deliverance to
[30:51] everyone that believes Hallelujah so the
[30:53] power is there but each person has to
[30:55] make a decision to accept that power to
[30:58] let the power flow through them praise
[31:00] God because remember the Bible said that
[31:01] in the last days they'd be traded or
[31:03] traitors heady high-minded they'd have a
[31:06] form of godliness but denying the power
[31:09] so we got to have the power of God Amen
[31:11] we've got to have the power of God to
[31:12] heal the sick
[31:13] we've got to have the power of God to
[31:15] bring us to repentance praise God we've
[31:17] got the power of God to change our minds
[31:19] and and bring us to a holy State praise
[31:21] God we've got to have the power of God
[31:23] to make us love God more to be more
[31:25] faithful to God Amen
[31:27] hallelujah it's the power of God that
[31:29] does that Hallelujah
[31:30] amen verse 17 for there and what the
[31:33] gospel of Christ the good news of Christ
[31:34] for in the good news is the
[31:36] righteousness of God revealed from Faith
[31:39] to Faith as it is written the just shall
[31:42] live by faith now remember we did the
[31:44] bible study on on Sunday night we saw
[31:46] that how well we live we don't live by
[31:49] our works because Church pretty soon
[31:51] we'll get to a spot where we don't do as
[31:53] many works as we think we should do or
[31:55] we get tired or discouraged and we just
[31:56] don't do God's works so we don't live by
[31:58] works the Bible said we live by faith
[32:01] amen right and faith is trust the word
[32:04] means trust in the Greek it means
[32:06] Assurance we live by the Assurance in
[32:09] Christ
[32:10] Hallelujah that's what we live by that
[32:12] and that's why that's why we we have a
[32:15] bad day we know the next day God can
[32:16] make this a great day praise God
[32:18] I don't have to stay back in my past I'm
[32:20] not I'm not a slave to that praise God I
[32:23] don't have to suffer the guilt of that I
[32:25] confess my sins I can move on praise God
[32:27] I have a fresh start because I live by
[32:29] faith Hallelujah
[32:31] Hallelujah I live by the faith that the
[32:33] Bible says blessed is the man whom the
[32:35] Lord will not impute iniquity praise God
[32:37] Hallelujah we live by the faith of every
[32:40] promise of God hallelujah and then in
[32:42] humility we say I'm a debtor
[32:44] to other people I'm supposed to serve
[32:46] other people hallelujah not I'm not
[32:48] ashamed of the gospel of Christ how many
[32:49] not ashamed praise God oh my thank God
[32:52] what a beautiful promise this is
[32:54] and notice we go from Faith to Faith
[32:57] praise God
[32:58] I love whenever God drops a fresh
[33:00] Revelation whether it was on Dancing
[33:02] that's the Revelation I've been living
[33:04] off of lately I just never seen it like
[33:06] that before and so see I live from that
[33:08] so previously that I had some good
[33:11] Revelation I could I couldn't really
[33:12] recall right now but I had some great
[33:14] Revelation in order to preach 17 years
[33:15] you need some Revelation praise God to
[33:17] keep going because Satan's going to
[33:19] battle each one of us to stop our our
[33:20] Ministries
[33:22] so I forget which one I had before that
[33:24] I probably look through my sermon series
[33:25] and see which thought I lived off of or
[33:27] you that's what you do you live off of
[33:28] thought you live off a revelation and
[33:30] then you go to another Revelation praise
[33:32] God
[33:34] and we don't know how long we're going
[33:35] to stay on that thought but we got to
[33:37] keep the word of God fresh we got to
[33:38] keep going back to the Rock Amen we've
[33:41] got to keep thirsting on the things of
[33:42] God hallelujah as we said on Sunday
[33:44] praise God hallelujah we've got to keep
[33:46] polling on God keep seeking God and
[33:49] therein God reveals more of himself to
[33:51] us hallelujah
[33:54] and so I like that here it is he said
[33:56] we've lived by faith and we go from
[33:58] Faith to Faith
[33:59] we need a new measure of faith we need a
[34:02] renewed sense of God's love in our lives
[34:04] amen A Renewed sense of God's
[34:06] faithfulness to us amen
[34:08] verse 18.
[34:09] now here he breaks now into this this
[34:12] next part now we'd say the introduction
[34:15] would be done because he talks about
[34:16] he's you know he greets the Saints and
[34:18] how he longs to be with them and and I'm
[34:20] not ashamed I'll preach anywhere the
[34:21] power of God has to capture my life and
[34:24] now he gets into
[34:26] the guilty World Schofield says he says
[34:29] the wrath of God revealed upon the world
[34:33] now Church let's look at the word wrath
[34:35] it means in indignation
[34:37] it means a temper
[34:39] it means agitated
[34:41] it means a violent emotion or anger
[34:45] now
[34:47] the Bible says we don't suffer the wrath
[34:49] of God anymore in first Thessalonians 5
[34:51] read it a few weeks ago so I'm not going
[34:52] to read that tonight
[34:54] but church we are not under the wrath of
[34:56] God God's not angry at us
[34:59] and the church said
[35:00] well if he's not angry he's got to be
[35:03] happy then right he's not angry
[35:06] the rat the anger of God is revealed
[35:09] from Heaven against all ungodliness and
[35:12] unrighteousness of men now who's trying
[35:14] to live a Godly life here tonight
[35:16] now who's really trying not really
[35:17] trying
[35:19] see because the world is not even trying
[35:22] and that's why God's anger angered with
[35:25] them because they're not even trying
[35:26] they're living in unrighteousness
[35:28] now those of us uh well all of us at
[35:31] some point were fighting against God
[35:33] whether we got saved at seven or some of
[35:35] us got to save here six or five here by
[35:37] God's grace
[35:38] the prayers of mine I think in prayers
[35:41] of dad the prayers of the family
[35:43] but we all know that at some point we
[35:46] were fighting against God
[35:48] we were not trying to draw closer to God
[35:50] we didn't care about living a righteous
[35:51] life but at some point a change came at
[35:54] some point we heard the good news the
[35:56] gospel that Jesus can forgive our sins
[35:58] and transform us and give us a hope for
[36:01] the future praise God
[36:02] and from that moment we repented and
[36:04] then we started experiencing the power
[36:06] of God Amen
[36:08] unto Deliverance unto salvation praise
[36:11] God so I just want you to see here now
[36:13] look at Paul here as he gets into this
[36:15] here
[36:16] now remember earlier in this chapter
[36:17] don't forget he called you beloved
[36:20] he said the Saints are beloved praise
[36:22] God so he's not talking well you're
[36:24] beloved but yet God's angry at you now
[36:26] we'll get that way right we'll get we'll
[36:28] get angry at the ones we love
[36:29] you have to say Amen
[36:31] we'll get angry at the ones we love more
[36:34] than anybody else
[36:35] I love this person more than anybody
[36:37] else but I still get angry because I'm a
[36:38] human
[36:40] right
[36:41] and I usually I always deserve it if
[36:43] anyone's angry with me it's probably
[36:45] it's my fault usually 99
[36:46] 99.9 of the time it's my fault
[36:50] but with God you know once we're
[36:53] accepted in Christ God doesn't get anger
[36:56] right now the Bible said he gets
[36:58] offended but he doesn't get angry
[37:00] right that's what the Bible says the
[37:03] wrath of God is not against the bride of
[37:06] Christ or the Holy Ghost Field Church
[37:08] but it's revealed from heaven against
[37:11] all ungodliness all the righteous and
[37:14] men who hold the truth in
[37:16] unrighteousness
[37:19] so I want you to uh notice that here
[37:22] wrath comes on those who know the truth
[37:25] but they still preach untruth or they
[37:27] live untruth
[37:29] they know it's righteous but they still
[37:31] choose to live unrighteous and later in
[37:33] this these next two chapters is going to
[37:35] show every person has a sense of what is
[37:38] right and wrong
[37:39] so nobody can say I didn't know
[37:41] I don't know about you know paralyzed
[37:43] people or people that you know uh you
[37:45] say mental troubles I'm not sure about
[37:46] that that'll be up to God and God will
[37:48] always judge Fair
[37:49] but but people that have a conscience
[37:51] and the five inlets of the human spirit
[37:53] and all all are working and active they
[37:55] they know the truth and they either hold
[37:57] it in righteousness or an
[37:59] unrighteousness right
[38:01] now verse 19 here's these are familiar I
[38:03] preached these over the years here
[38:04] especially these last few years but
[38:06] because that which may be known of God
[38:08] is manifesting them for God has showed
[38:10] it unto them
[38:12] wow so they they know the truth because
[38:14] God's made it known to them and he's
[38:17] even showed it to them like brother Adam
[38:19] said I can see God in the in the rainbow
[38:22] that comes out of light shining through
[38:23] an icicle
[38:25] he said I can see God in that amen I can
[38:29] see God's I can see God in the how of an
[38:32] animal
[38:33] or the bark of an animal
[38:36] right or the mating call of a bird or
[38:38] whatever I can see God in that God makes
[38:40] himself known to everybody abundantly
[38:42] all throughout their lives he's making
[38:44] himself known to them praise God
[38:47] they see God's character they see God's
[38:49] nature they see God's power
[38:52] Hallelujah I remember when we preached
[38:55] on the Colossians series and and one
[38:56] Little Star there may look like a star
[38:58] but it actually might be an entire
[38:59] galaxy that one that looks like one star
[39:02] there's billions of stars within that
[39:04] star
[39:06] and then there's billions of galaxies
[39:07] praise God and our heavenly father named
[39:10] every single one of them praise God
[39:11] that's a lot and then he also knows all
[39:13] the hairs on your head
[39:15] if you still got them thank God
[39:17] Hallelujah but now that's a that's a lot
[39:20] of knowledge
[39:21] all those stars and then all your hairs
[39:23] all your hair my hair's your ears over
[39:26] here
[39:27] that that that's and then that God says
[39:29] you're his beloved ah amen amen that God
[39:34] says you pass from Death unto life that
[39:36] God says there's no condemnation to you
[39:39] amen
[39:40] oh that's the kind of God I want to
[39:42] serve amen thank God Amen
[39:46] I got I taught that at the uh
[39:48] the middle school Bible study on Tuesday
[39:50] morning you know Ephesians 1 4. I did a
[39:52] Bible trivia and I said when did God
[39:54] choose you to be saved they said at the
[39:56] cross I said that's a good guess but
[39:58] it's before that
[40:00] and pretty soon they got back how about
[40:01] at Creation in the Garden of Eden I said
[40:03] that's a pretty good guess but it was
[40:05] long before that
[40:12] and they're like I don't know and then
[40:14] one boy he's in the fifth grade and he
[40:15] goes to uh did not make a church over
[40:17] here in the Fair Lawn and they said be
[40:20] basically said it's because God loves us
[40:22] and he wants us to know that he's never
[40:24] going to leave us or never forsake us I
[40:26] said God bless you little Carter amen
[40:28] that's exactly right praise God if you
[40:31] know he chose you before there ever was
[40:33] a world then you know even if the world
[40:35] Falls you're still his child you're
[40:37] still chosen his mind and you'll still
[40:39] be with him if there's never a world
[40:41] anymore but we know the world is going
[40:43] to remain it's just going to get a
[40:44] renovation praise God and you then you
[40:47] and I get to live on the world Amen a
[40:49] renovated world with no devil no Satan
[40:52] no sin no temptation only Holiness and
[40:55] righteousness amen
[40:57] that's the kind of God I want to serve
[40:59] right there amen God showed it unto them
[41:03] God showed it to us
[41:06] like I always tell people I saw God heal
[41:08] my mama cancer of incurable liver cancer
[41:11] in the second grade and how was I ever
[41:13] going to deny there was a God how could
[41:15] I ever do it
[41:16] it was impossible even though I had
[41:18] sinned I went into sin in fifth grade
[41:19] and on and on until I was 19. it's still
[41:22] that whole time no one could tell me
[41:23] nobody could tell me there was no God
[41:25] because he showed himself to me but if
[41:28] he never would have done that I still
[41:30] would have known by all the creation and
[41:32] design in the universe
[41:34] right all the you know Charles Darwin
[41:36] said there was no God and there was
[41:37] Evolution and he said the smaller an
[41:39] object gets uh the less complex it is
[41:42] and we find out it's just the opposite
[41:45] the smaller something is the more
[41:47] complex it is
[41:49] right and then think about that
[41:50] splitting it out and look at the power
[41:52] and splitting one atom look at that
[41:54] power
[41:55] look what happened to Hiroshima Nagasaki
[41:58] by splitting an atom
[42:00] think about that and that's just one and
[42:03] your body's Nature's filled with atoms
[42:06] look at the power that God packed in a
[42:09] small package amen my goodness gracious
[42:12] and then he says if you've got faith
[42:14] like a mustard seed he said you can
[42:16] speak to this mountain and it will move
[42:18] praise God Amen Hallelujah a rubber band
[42:22] broke in my mouth
[42:23] I thought it hit something
[42:25] laughs
[42:27] now verse 20.
[42:29] all right sorry
[42:31] I had to go to the orthodontist
[42:32] yesterday
[42:33] for the invisible things of him from the
[42:35] creation of the world are clearly seen
[42:37] invisible things are clearly seen yes
[42:41] invisible principles are clearly seen
[42:43] being understood by the things that are
[42:46] made
[42:48] even his eternal power and godhead so
[42:51] that they are without excuse so we see
[42:54] God's eternal power in the atom
[42:57] you can blow up hundreds of thousands of
[42:59] people with splitting one atom
[43:01] right
[43:02] be power how about the power of
[43:05] maintaining all those bins and trillions
[43:06] of stars how about the power in that
[43:09] you see his eternal power Hallelujah
[43:13] and you see the godhead so any threes
[43:15] father son only goes I got a whole list
[43:17] of them in my book all the threes in
[43:19] nature
[43:20] there's threes all kinds of things I
[43:21] can't think of them now but there's
[43:23] threes everywhere anytime there's a
[43:25] three somewhere it's the godhead God is
[43:27] talking godhead morning noon and evening
[43:30] right I mean there's so many you can
[43:31] just go on and on all the threes in the
[43:33] world is speaking godhead godhead
[43:35] godhead Hallelujah all the power you see
[43:38] around the world God's power God's
[43:40] infinite God's even greater than this
[43:41] even the power we see God's greater than
[43:43] that praise God
[43:45] amen
[43:47] because so there's no excuses on the day
[43:50] of judgment judgment God shows it to
[43:52] everybody
[43:53] so Church let's hold the truth with
[43:56] righteousness
[43:57] because the Wrath comes on those who
[43:59] know the truth and they do despite the
[44:01] truth
[44:02] verse 21 because that when they knew God
[44:05] they glorified him not as God
[44:07] neither we're thankful that's why
[44:09] Thanksgiving day is so important it's
[44:11] not coming to church and giving God
[44:12] praise is so important
[44:14] the unrighteous that get the wrath of
[44:16] God they will not give God thanks
[44:19] see why it's important to raise your
[44:20] hands
[44:21] and clap your hands
[44:24] see I get a holy jealousy when I see
[44:26] people shout and scream at basketball or
[44:28] football games I get a holy jealous
[44:29] they're like why are you worshiping that
[44:30] there's nothing even in that
[44:32] and it makes me more just want to come
[44:34] here and give God praise amen because I
[44:36] wasted so many hours doing that but it
[44:38] proves that they're God it proves that
[44:41] we're going to see they made a creation
[44:43] to God instead of the creator of the god
[44:46] that's right
[44:48] so they know God that God showed himself
[44:51] to them but they do not glorify him as
[44:53] God neither were they thankful they
[44:55] became vain in their imaginations and
[44:56] their foolish heart was darkened
[44:59] remember the Bible says the light has
[45:01] risen in your heart remember the Bible
[45:02] says that
[45:04] the son of righteousness has risen with
[45:06] healing in his wings the Bible says
[45:08] Jesus Christ
[45:09] and the day star has risen in Your Heart
[45:12] Church think about that your soul is in
[45:15] darkness but one day light shine in
[45:17] there praise God the sun came up on your
[45:20] Blackness amen oh look how bright it is
[45:22] even now that's how bright your soul is
[45:25] amen
[45:26] praise God your heart is not darkened
[45:28] praise God your heart has the light of
[45:30] God it's got not just a natural light
[45:33] these will burn out it's got an eternal
[45:35] life praise God
[45:36] oh but Sinners their hearts get darker
[45:39] and covered with Darkness the Greek says
[45:45] the Bible said the blinded he blinds
[45:47] their minds right we looked over that a
[45:49] few weeks ago
[45:50] now look at verse 22 professing
[45:52] themselves to be wise they became fools
[45:55] now churches
[45:56] we how many believe you're a wise virgin
[45:58] see I I if someone asked me I'll profess
[46:00] that
[46:01] but it's not something we brag on but if
[46:02] they ask me are you wise or foolish
[46:04] version I believe I'm a wise Virgin by
[46:05] God's grace
[46:07] not that I'm bragging
[46:09] but and then brother bran tells us
[46:11] you'll never live above your confession
[46:12] if you always say I'm the weakest
[46:14] Christian he said you're going to remain
[46:15] the weakest Christian right if you
[46:17] always say I can't overcome this you're
[46:19] never going to overcome it because
[46:20] that's not Faith talking
[46:22] right faith is a revelation Faith tells
[46:25] you you can go from Faith to Faith amen
[46:27] Faith tells you I can go higher praise
[46:28] God
[46:30] Hallelujah Faith tells me that I could
[46:33] get the victory Faith tells me there's
[46:34] greater things ahead praise God I can I
[46:37] can go higher in Christ I can increase
[46:40] praise God I can add to all these
[46:42] anointings in my life I can get a fresh
[46:44] anointing praise God
[46:46] hallelujah praise God Amen
[46:50] but see Sinners claim to be wise and
[46:53] they become fools
[46:55] I always loved that Ray come for a video
[46:58] where he goes to the USC and he asks all
[47:00] these uh uh
[47:02] he has all these Evolution guys can you
[47:04] give me one example
[47:06] of evolution he's like I can give you
[47:08] thousands
[47:09] he rage just said just give me one
[47:12] he said the stickleback fish
[47:15] he says what were they before they
[47:16] evolved he said they were sticklebacks
[47:19] he said what were they after
[47:21] they're still sticklebacks he said
[47:23] that's not darwinian evolution
[47:24] Darwin evolution is changing from a
[47:26] stickle fish to an alligator or
[47:28] something like
[47:30] something like and he's like they claim
[47:31] they're so they're claiming to be so
[47:33] wise but then they CA they say I've got
[47:35] thousands of examples and they can't
[47:36] even come up with one praise God ah what
[47:39] just about these people like the Bible
[47:41] said they just hold the truth of God in
[47:44] unrighteousness praise God
[47:47] or the finches Darwin's finches
[47:49] they said they evolved and Ray said well
[47:52] what were they before he said they were
[47:53] finches
[47:54] what were they after they involved one
[47:56] of their finches with different beaks he
[47:58] said they're still finches
[48:00] and that obeys God's word because God's
[48:02] word says kind comes after from kind
[48:05] praise God
[48:06] you'll never see a monkey produce a man
[48:09] right as we went over a number of years
[48:11] ago we went over those proofs how uh
[48:13] evolution is is nonsense
[48:16] but see they they claim to be wise they
[48:18] got phds and all these things they have
[48:21] all these claims but they have no proof
[48:24] ah they become fools my and I appreciate
[48:27] men like I don't know why I'm on Ray
[48:28] Comfort tonight but
[48:30] uh Ray Comfort proves they're fools
[48:33] Hallelujah verse 23 and they change the
[48:36] glory of the uncorruptable god
[48:38] into an image made like two corruptable
[48:40] men
[48:41] see anything someone worships other than
[48:44] God it's going to become corruptable
[48:46] it's going to get old it's going to get
[48:48] uh it's going to fall apart right it's
[48:50] going to get it's going to get
[48:52] corruptable
[48:53] and they worship the Bible said Birds
[48:55] four-footed beasts creeping things
[48:59] wherefore God also gave them up to
[49:01] uncleanness through the lusts of their
[49:03] own hearts
[49:04] so see remember they had darkened hearts
[49:06] and now we know they got lusts in their
[49:08] hearts
[49:10] so now we know how it gets dark right
[49:11] they feed their lusts
[49:13] and it dishonors their own bodies
[49:16] between themselves now here we're
[49:18] starting to get into the depths of sin
[49:20] here and now we start to see
[49:21] homosexuality
[49:23] right
[49:24] I'll never forget when one of our
[49:26] members here uh younger brother come to
[49:28] me years ago and said what do you think
[49:30] about it right about 2015 right when
[49:31] they legalize a younger brother come to
[49:34] me and said brother Jesse what do you
[49:35] think about homosexuality and these
[49:37] people are telling me it's okay
[49:39] and I was like
[49:40] have you ever read the New Testament
[49:43] let's read that and so we went there in
[49:45] a Bible study I showed the brother
[49:47] where the Bible says the Romans says it
[49:49] in Timothy
[49:50] says it all uh Corinthians it says Paul
[49:53] says at least three or four times
[49:55] right
[49:56] and uh I don't know where the brother
[49:58] stands today
[50:00] but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[50:02] today and forever
[50:04] right
[50:06] and so now we see a a people that know
[50:10] the truth and despise it call themselves
[50:12] wise but they're fools then they start
[50:13] dishonoring their bodies sexually right
[50:16] verse 25. who changed the truth of God
[50:19] into a lie like they say oh God made me
[50:22] this way
[50:24] God I was born with these desires no you
[50:27] weren't it's impossible
[50:30] God doesn't make God doesn't make
[50:32] mistakes like that and the one guy Bruce
[50:34] Jenner even blamed God he said God did
[50:36] this I remember that on an interview he
[50:37] said this is God's fault
[50:39] God don't make no mistakes
[50:41] they change the truth of God into a lie
[50:43] and worshiped and served the creature
[50:45] more than the Creator who is blessed
[50:47] forevermore amen they'd rather worship
[50:49] men and women they'd rather worship
[50:51] money riches and civilizations they'd
[50:53] rather worship anything but God oh but
[50:56] you ought to feel blessed that you're
[50:57] worshiping the god of the universe
[50:59] tonight praise God Amen You've Got A
[51:01] sound mind praise God you're holding the
[51:03] truth in righteousness you know the
[51:05] truth and you're obeying the truth
[51:06] praise God oh
[51:09] now because they did this verse 26 God
[51:12] gave them up unto vile affection so now
[51:15] you know what uh homosexuality is it's a
[51:18] disgrace
[51:19] it's a shame it's a vile it's a reproach
[51:23] it's a shameful affection for even their
[51:26] women to change the natural use into
[51:28] that which is against nature
[51:32] verse 27 and likewise also the men
[51:35] leaving the natural use of the woman
[51:37] burn in their lust one toward another
[51:40] men with men working that which is
[51:42] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[51:44] that recompense of the air which was
[51:46] meat now I was shocked to hear this but
[51:48] I heard a preacher saying I gotta look
[51:49] it up but he said the average lifespan
[51:52] of a homosexual man in the U.S is 40
[51:55] years old
[51:57] and it's not always because of AIDS
[51:59] because that's they got more message
[52:01] medicines now I guess to deal with that
[52:03] but that's the average age
[52:06] remember during covid uh all the the
[52:08] suicides went up
[52:10] and then now the the trans Community
[52:12] they have a very high rate of suicide
[52:16] and the Bible says they'll receive in
[52:19] themselves the of the recompense the
[52:22] payback for The Heirs that they've done
[52:24] they know the truth of God they know the
[52:26] word of God
[52:27] but because they go against the word of
[52:29] God they don't worship God as a Creator
[52:31] because they won't obey the truth then
[52:33] God has to give them God has to let them
[52:36] uh sow what reap what they sow
[52:40] think about that 40 years old
[52:42] is the average age
[52:46] and I told the brother too when we did
[52:48] the Bible said I said why he said why is
[52:49] it so bad it goes against God's design
[52:50] it's telling God your design is not
[52:53] right
[52:55] because God has natural body parts to
[52:57] work natural ways right
[52:59] and when you go up when you go the same
[53:01] gender which there's only two genders
[53:06] of course
[53:08] they change the truth of God into a lie
[53:11] then it doesn't it's unnatural and the
[53:14] Bible calls it a disgrace vile
[53:16] a dishonor
[53:18] I don't care how nice they are
[53:20] they've got Demons Inside of them praise
[53:22] God
[53:23] they're just religious demons
[53:25] which can be the worst sometimes look at
[53:27] the Pharisees two full more sons of Hell
[53:30] than uh their their their converts were
[53:33] twice as awful as they were
[53:35] and look what we've just seen since 2015
[53:37] some people thought oh all they want in
[53:40] 2015 they just want homosexuality to be
[53:41] okay and now look where it's got now
[53:43] transgender and then children having
[53:45] surgeries at Young ages
[53:48] and being cats right children people
[53:51] think they're cats in the school system
[53:53] which she saw Emma saw it
[53:56] right they had kitty litter in the right
[53:57] the bathroom
[53:59] unbelievable in public schools well I'm
[54:01] a cat so I need a
[54:02] what do they call it lit kitty litter
[54:04] box or something like a litter box
[54:05] unbelievable
[54:07] and church we're not we're not bashing
[54:09] them in that way but we're giving a
[54:11] warning signal the Bible said come out
[54:13] of her praise God
[54:15] Hallelujah the Bible said warn every man
[54:17] praise God but this is why the wrath of
[54:19] God comes because the people know the
[54:21] truth God shows them the truth God shows
[54:23] it over and over in themselves and
[54:25] nature shows them everywhere and they
[54:27] change the truth of God into a lie
[54:29] because of their lusts oh my If people
[54:31] could just learn to crucify their lust
[54:33] and realize the pleasure doesn't last it
[54:35] gets harder and harder to maintain and
[54:37] fulfill the lust but if they just
[54:39] crucify that they'd experience a very
[54:40] true Joy of God hallelujah ah they could
[54:44] just once dance like we danced they can
[54:46] just once feel the joy of the Holy
[54:48] Spirit they'd scream for hours amen how
[54:51] do I know because we just scream for
[54:52] hours amen that's how I know praise God
[54:55] Hallelujah
[54:57] and even did it on four hours of sleep
[54:59] by God's grace
[55:01] oh my God
[55:04] the joy and the pleasure of serving the
[55:06] lord amen
[55:08] oh Look What the Lord Has Done
[55:10] Hallelujah the gospel the good news
[55:13] so see it's payback for homosexuals in
[55:15] God's sight
[55:17] God pays them back
[55:19] now again just like the Bible said I
[55:21] said on Sunday some men sins they pay
[55:23] for him now
[55:24] and other men's sins are hidden and then
[55:26] they'll get a worse punishment later I
[55:27] don't know if it worse or not but I
[55:28] shouldn't said that but somehow they're
[55:30] gonna their sins are gonna be exposed
[55:33] now verse 28 and even as they did not
[55:36] like to retain God in their house see
[55:37] that's the thing they just don't want to
[55:38] think about the word they don't want to
[55:40] meditate on the word of God they know
[55:41] it's right they know it's true God
[55:42] showed it to them but they don't want to
[55:44] retain the word of God in their
[55:46] knowledge that retain means to hold
[55:49] to wear it to possess it
[55:52] to hold fast
[55:54] to regard as good to possess hallelujah
[55:57] how many possess the word of God here
[55:59] tonight
[56:00] Well church you're going to possess
[56:01] something Hallelujah you ought to
[56:03] possess God's word because there's power
[56:05] in the word of God Amen there's life in
[56:07] the word of God there's victory in the
[56:09] word of God there's healing in the word
[56:10] of God everything good is in the word of
[56:13] God hallelujah
[56:14] retain God in your knowledge be careful
[56:16] like Austin I talked about this you know
[56:18] years ago we got to be careful how much
[56:19] podcast we listen to
[56:21] we got to be careful how much YouTube we
[56:23] listen to if it's not the word of God
[56:25] we've got to retain God's word I'm sorry
[56:29] God's word in our knowledge in our in
[56:31] our spirit praise God
[56:33] to meditate on that
[56:35] now look at verse 28 because they refuse
[56:38] to focus on God's word then God gave
[56:41] them over now this word gave means to
[56:43] deliver up to give into the hands of
[56:46] another so think about that at one time
[56:47] God was having Mercy but then when they
[56:50] reject God over and over then God just
[56:51] hands them over to Satan
[56:54] God just says I can't do anything more
[56:55] with you gives them over to Satan
[57:00] he says God gave them over to a
[57:02] reprobate mind that means a rejected
[57:04] mind
[57:05] not standing the test
[57:07] so when people fail the test of God
[57:09] constantly day after day showing I'm
[57:11] alive I'm your creator here's my design
[57:13] I'm real I'm undeniable my design is
[57:17] everywhere my love is everywhere amen
[57:19] thank God my truth is everywhere I
[57:21] praise God when they
[57:23] fail the test God gives them over to
[57:26] Satan
[57:27] to do the things which are not
[57:29] convenient
[57:32] that means that is fit see so we don't
[57:34] those are people that go against the
[57:36] design of God
[57:39] now
[57:41] got a few things here I want to share by
[57:42] God's grace
[57:44] I'm going to get to this I thought I
[57:46] would
[57:47] it's kind of where I felt a little
[57:48] inspired here
[57:51] now look at this
[57:52] so Church everybody knows the truth
[57:54] whether it's Barbarian whether it's
[57:55] educated man Jew Gentile everyone knows
[57:58] the truth about God
[58:00] Hallelujah
[58:01] when they reject God's word then they
[58:04] have to be filled with something brother
[58:05] man said you leave here fill with
[58:08] something oh God fill us with the Holy
[58:10] Ghost amen
[58:11] fill me with the power of God hallelujah
[58:13] when I leave here hallelujah
[58:20] he said being filled with all
[58:21] unrighteousness
[58:23] unrighteousness means iniquity
[58:27] violation of the law
[58:30] see they constantly violate God's word
[58:32] fornication of course we know that's any
[58:34] acts before marriage
[58:37] wickedness which means depravity malice
[58:40] evil purposes or desires everything's
[58:43] evil everything's a sinful selfish
[58:45] desire wickedness
[58:47] covetousness of course that's Desiring
[58:49] what a greedy desire to have more
[58:52] they're filled with more I need more I
[58:55] gotta have more
[58:56] maliciousness which is naughtiness ill
[59:00] will desire to injure I want to hurt
[59:02] brother so and so I want to hurt sister
[59:03] so and so on and make them look bad or I
[59:05] want to make them suffer like they made
[59:07] me suffer maliciousness
[59:10] full of envy
[59:13] murder debate deceit malignity and
[59:16] Whispers
[59:18] let me look up some of these Envy means
[59:20] prompted to Envy so jealousy
[59:23] murder is the one I'm going to look at
[59:24] here in just a moment here uh debate
[59:26] let's look at debate it is a contention
[59:28] remember there's good debate and there's
[59:30] bad debate
[59:31] because Paul reasoned in the synagogues
[59:33] every Saturday that Jesus was the Christ
[59:36] Paul had a lot of debates I believe he
[59:38] won all of them praise God now he didn't
[59:40] win always all the souls but he won the
[59:42] debate praise God because God's word
[59:43] don't don't fail you can't you can't
[59:46] lose a debate was God's word amen
[59:47] hallelujah do you see malignity
[59:51] malignity is bad character
[59:54] craftiness so think about Sly people
[59:57] I got some of those in my class you know
[1:00:00] I'm praying for them by God no crap no
[1:00:02] they'll I've seen it this week they'll
[1:00:03] wait till I turn around then they'll
[1:00:04] stick their tongue out of people
[1:00:06] I'm like I saw that
[1:00:08] that's a minute recess
[1:00:10] you owe me you gotta write apology note
[1:00:12] you're in debt to me
[1:00:14] whispers are secret Slanders well don't
[1:00:17] tell the sister this but I'm gonna do
[1:00:18] this
[1:00:21] and that's all because they rejected
[1:00:23] God's word
[1:00:25] Church it ought to be so good you got to
[1:00:27] be so happy if this doesn't describe you
[1:00:28] praise God
[1:00:30] amen that means you're filled with God
[1:00:32] hallelujah if you're not filled with
[1:00:34] this you're filled with God hallelujah
[1:00:37] amen thank God
[1:00:40] because they wouldn't retain the
[1:00:42] knowledge of God
[1:00:46] I'll try to finish this chapter and I'm
[1:00:48] going to go back in
[1:00:50] look at that murder just for a moment
[1:00:52] here
[1:00:53] spiders haters of God a backbiter is an
[1:00:57] evil speaker
[1:01:00] of course we know what talking behind
[1:01:01] somebody's back is
[1:01:03] despiteful which is a one who's lifted
[1:01:05] up in Pride
[1:01:07] insulting language
[1:01:09] when you insult people so that
[1:01:11] despiteful insulters proud
[1:01:13] we know someone that's over top of
[1:01:16] others they're preeminent they're more
[1:01:18] important than other people boasters are
[1:01:20] empty Pretenders
[1:01:22] they pretend they can do things right
[1:01:25] Pretenders
[1:01:27] sorry I lost my spider I clicked the
[1:01:29] wrong thing
[1:01:30] inventors of evil things
[1:01:32] and disobedient to parents so now
[1:01:34] children see why brother Jess has to
[1:01:37] talk to you about obeying your parents
[1:01:39] the first time
[1:01:40] right
[1:01:41] I got to get that it's my duty to get
[1:01:43] that taught to you obey your parents
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:48] that's the first first promise I'm sorry
[1:01:51] first commandment with promise God will
[1:01:53] give you a long life on the Earth
[1:01:56] praise God and if you can if you can
[1:01:58] obey someone you can see then surely you
[1:02:00] can obey God who you can't see right
[1:02:03] that's that's the proof of love if you
[1:02:04] obey someone that you see surely you can
[1:02:07] obey God whom you can't see that's what
[1:02:09] the Bible says
[1:02:10] Hallelujah but this group that goes
[1:02:12] against God's word is disobedient to
[1:02:15] parents
[1:02:16] without understanding they really they
[1:02:18] say they're wise but they have no
[1:02:19] understanding
[1:02:21] Covenant Breakers of course marriage
[1:02:22] covenants Oaths promises without natural
[1:02:25] affection see that's where they get into
[1:02:26] the homosexuality and my wife didn't
[1:02:28] even talked about it even people that
[1:02:30] don't have a natural affection for a
[1:02:31] baby and they'd go they support abortion
[1:02:33] like Billy Graham like how is that
[1:02:36] possible
[1:02:37] supporting abortion
[1:02:39] they don't have the natural feelings you
[1:02:41] have
[1:02:42] right
[1:02:44] now implacable let me look that up I
[1:02:46] don't remember that one it's a truce
[1:02:47] breaker so someone
[1:02:51] uh that cannot be persuaded to enter
[1:02:53] into Covenant so again that'd probably
[1:02:54] be people that
[1:02:56] don't don't get married or won't get
[1:02:57] married right unmerciful
[1:03:01] who knowing the Judgment of God look
[1:03:03] they know every they all then they know
[1:03:05] these are all commandments
[1:03:07] that they which commit such things are
[1:03:09] worthy of death
[1:03:10] not only do the same but have pleasure
[1:03:13] in them that do them
[1:03:14] always remember that picture from a few
[1:03:16] years ago they had like an award show
[1:03:17] for all the heathens and they actually
[1:03:19] sang it was like a movie star or music
[1:03:21] industry and actually sang this song
[1:03:23] called Highway to Hell
[1:03:24] and they have all these people with they
[1:03:26] had devil horns on and they got their
[1:03:27] devil horns up and they're singing
[1:03:29] Highway to Hell and like and the songs
[1:03:31] like when I get to hell I'm gonna party
[1:03:33] with my friends who'll do no such thing
[1:03:35] they will suffer unbelievably
[1:03:39] right they'll scream and cry out for any
[1:03:41] Mercy but because they had no mercy on
[1:03:43] this Earth they'll be shown no mercy in
[1:03:45] hell
[1:03:46] thank God for the mercy of God thank God
[1:03:49] that you love the knowledge of God that
[1:03:51] you love the word of God that you love
[1:03:53] to retain God's word in your mind praise
[1:03:55] God
[1:03:56] in other words thank God you've passed
[1:03:58] the test Hallelujah these have failed
[1:04:01] the test they're unapproved they haven't
[1:04:04] passed the test but you and I have
[1:04:06] passed the test praise God Amen we are
[1:04:08] given the choice eternal life or or
[1:04:10] lovers of God lover is a pleasure we
[1:04:12] became lovers of God hallelujah
[1:04:15] oh my thank God am I wearing you out
[1:04:18] tonight am I wearing anybody out tonight
[1:04:20] all right
[1:04:21] bless you
[1:04:25] no even though they know death is going
[1:04:28] to come because of their sins
[1:04:30] they still do the sins and have pleasure
[1:04:33] in them
[1:04:36] now I want to go back to that verse uh
[1:04:40] full of murder
[1:04:46] the scripture
[1:04:48] yeah I believe it's verse
[1:04:51] 29. now I just thought this might be
[1:04:53] helpful here
[1:04:55] I'm going to try to bring this down and
[1:04:56] close in a little bit you're not you can
[1:04:57] switch over here I just want to show a
[1:04:58] few things here
[1:05:00] I've been working on this video of
[1:05:01] course you know we got the podcast
[1:05:02] defending the message and so forth
[1:05:04] and I've always tried to defend the
[1:05:06] message now when I was I was studying
[1:05:08] this
[1:05:08] I've been studying recently on Jim Jones
[1:05:10] how many know who Jim Jones is
[1:05:13] anybody know
[1:05:14] nobody knows
[1:05:18] okay uh
[1:05:20] well I'll just give you a little
[1:05:21] background well um well just to tell you
[1:05:24] who he is he was a preacher
[1:05:27] who
[1:05:28] who eventually led a thousand people to
[1:05:31] South America to start their own uh
[1:05:34] Utopia
[1:05:36] but then uh he did he did the uh cyanide
[1:05:40] laced Kool-Aid and killed over 900
[1:05:42] people
[1:05:43] in 1978
[1:05:47] so this is when I read that full of
[1:05:49] murder
[1:05:51] I thought what I thought I've been
[1:05:53] studying on this so recently as you know
[1:05:55] there's two main groups that attack the
[1:05:57] message believe the sign and then now uh
[1:06:00] the grandson
[1:06:02] of one of the former pastors of Branham
[1:06:03] Tabernacle
[1:06:04] I'm trying not to call names but they
[1:06:06] watch well I'm praying for you guys
[1:06:09] always always pray for them
[1:06:12] well recently I did a series on Jim
[1:06:14] Jones and and said that and said that
[1:06:17] brother random is responsible for what
[1:06:19] Jim Jones did
[1:06:23] now I want to just explain this a little
[1:06:25] bit here so hopefully ever you
[1:06:26] understand it
[1:06:27] um
[1:06:28] Jim Jones was raised by uh you know
[1:06:31] parents that didn't go to church and to
[1:06:34] make a long story short uh he became a
[1:06:37] gospel preacher
[1:06:40] uh and you know from even from his
[1:06:42] childhood everybody noticed something
[1:06:43] was wrong with him maybe he was
[1:06:44] neglected and abused or something I
[1:06:46] can't remember all the details
[1:06:48] but he became a gospel preacher
[1:06:51] okay first he was I think in Methodist
[1:06:53] and then he convinced his wife to to go
[1:06:54] to the Pentecostals
[1:06:56] uh well then he went to the Assemblies
[1:06:58] of God and became now somebody's God
[1:06:59] that was the denomination I was raised
[1:07:01] in
[1:07:02] and then he got heard of Brothers
[1:07:05] Ministry
[1:07:06] now the thing that everybody liked about
[1:07:08] Jim Jones he had a church about 300 or
[1:07:10] 100 or something like that is that he
[1:07:12] was one of the first churches in Indiana
[1:07:13] to invite blacks and whites together
[1:07:16] Indiana used to be like the head of the
[1:07:18] KKK
[1:07:20] Indiana used to be but Jim Jones is one
[1:07:22] of the first and he got nine children
[1:07:24] some of them were adopted and and he
[1:07:26] called himself the rainbow family
[1:07:27] because he had black children white
[1:07:29] children they adopted and so he started
[1:07:31] out as seemingly as a nice person
[1:07:34] and in 1957 or 56 and 57 he had joint
[1:07:37] meetings he had brother Branham come and
[1:07:39] preach at his services
[1:07:41] okay that's a picture he's known because
[1:07:43] he wears those sunglasses like Elvis
[1:07:44] that's how he's known like you'll see
[1:07:46] his picture around and because he was a
[1:07:48] mass murderer
[1:07:53] and uh so as The Story Goes On
[1:07:57] he had uh he invited brother Graham to
[1:07:59] preach at his church and you can listen
[1:08:00] there's one sermon that they have they
[1:08:03] have recorded a brother I'm preaching
[1:08:04] there from 1956 and I'm going to get to
[1:08:06] in just a little bit I'll share some of
[1:08:07] the things
[1:08:08] but uh brother Adam's accusers
[1:08:11] say that in those interactions
[1:08:14] that somehow brother Branham influenced
[1:08:16] him to do what he ultimately did
[1:08:18] it's the biggest bunch of trash
[1:08:21] that I've heard in a long time
[1:08:25] because as I went and studied now Church
[1:08:27] I got to know what I'm talking about so
[1:08:29] I went back and listened to some of his
[1:08:31] speakings I'm not going to call them
[1:08:32] sermons they're not even sermons
[1:08:35] by 1965 Bill Brown's death well I'm
[1:08:38] sorry in 1957 he totally suffered
[1:08:40] himself from Brother Branham totally
[1:08:42] and he went into his own uh his own he
[1:08:45] basically started he went independent
[1:08:49] but by 1965 when brother Ram died
[1:08:53] he'd already told his wife and this is
[1:08:55] the testimony of the family he didn't
[1:08:57] even believe in God anymore
[1:09:00] right
[1:09:03] and then he gave a false prophecy to his
[1:09:05] church that nuclear uh Warheads were
[1:09:07] going to hit I think in 1957 in
[1:09:08] Indianapolis so he moved his church out
[1:09:10] to California well the prophecy came and
[1:09:12] went and he was a false prophet
[1:09:16] now out in California was where he
[1:09:18] started all this
[1:09:19] really really awful Sid I believe it was
[1:09:21] 1965 he moved out to California if I'm
[1:09:24] not mistaken
[1:09:26] and so he had all these churches I'm
[1:09:28] sorry maybe three or four churches
[1:09:29] around the area
[1:09:30] but I listened to a sermon from 1971 in
[1:09:33] 1971 he was saying he was God in flesh
[1:09:39] now Church
[1:09:40] do we what do we know about Jesus Jesus
[1:09:43] was God in flesh
[1:09:44] but I've got the sermon I'm going to
[1:09:46] share with the people
[1:09:47] uh you know on YouTube eventually I got
[1:09:49] the sermon Jim Jones says he he was he
[1:09:53] was the god that the same God that
[1:09:55] walked in the plains of mammary with
[1:09:57] Abraham he says I am
[1:09:59] he says I am and people are shouting
[1:10:01] dancing unbelievable now any any person
[1:10:05] just at that point any person knows
[1:10:07] brother I've never taught that that
[1:10:08] nonsense
[1:10:10] and the loudest cheers and he even says
[1:10:12] in the sermon he says our hero is not
[1:10:14] the president Our Heroes now this he
[1:10:16] said our hero is socialism he didn't
[1:10:18] even say Jesus
[1:10:20] so by 1971 he's saying I'm God and the
[1:10:23] hero socialism not Jesus
[1:10:26] by 1975 all the family members I watched
[1:10:29] some of their testimonies he was abusing
[1:10:31] people he was electrocuting people as
[1:10:33] torment
[1:10:37] and just the there's a I've tried I
[1:10:40] gotta watch my words here uh the
[1:10:42] depravity of which he he stooped to
[1:10:45] is the sickest thing you could ever you
[1:10:47] could ever think of
[1:10:48] let me just share a few things that I
[1:10:49] can share he was against the nuclear
[1:10:51] family so he would let couples that were
[1:10:54] married have relationships with others
[1:10:56] and let people have relationships
[1:10:58] physically even though they're not
[1:10:59] married well anybody knows that's an
[1:11:02] awful sin and people will not inherit
[1:11:04] the kingdom of God
[1:11:05] anyone that says he you know he was
[1:11:08] influenced by Brother Graham they're a
[1:11:10] liar if they go listen to what he said
[1:11:14] this is this is the this is the this is
[1:11:16] why this struck me he's the example of
[1:11:18] disobeying Romans 1
[1:11:20] he's the example of obeying Romans 1
[1:11:22] praise God Amen Hallelujah brother man
[1:11:25] was faithful to his wife right
[1:11:27] all the love of God flowing out of
[1:11:29] brother around giving himself the prayer
[1:11:30] and Ministry and serving the people
[1:11:32] praise God my a faithful testimony
[1:11:36] and what is it it's like a modern Judas
[1:11:38] Iscariot
[1:11:40] you come in the presence of the truth
[1:11:41] and then you don't retain the truth
[1:11:44] another one this ought to touch the
[1:11:46] sisters and show how Wicked this guy was
[1:11:47] from the from right there in the early
[1:11:50] 70s he would try to separate the young
[1:11:52] children from their parents and they'd
[1:11:54] cry and scream and he said no you gotta
[1:11:56] do they got to be independent he was
[1:11:58] breaking the bonds of the family so they
[1:12:00] would all look to him
[1:12:02] he's the leader he he's he's all in
[1:12:04] charge you can question him you couldn't
[1:12:06] do he was unquestionable that's why that
[1:12:07] Spirit that's on Jefferson Bill was the
[1:12:09] same one that's here because you could
[1:12:11] not question him and Jeffersonville says
[1:12:13] you can't question anything on the tapes
[1:12:17] see how the and I told the guys I said
[1:12:18] this is caught like behave this is
[1:12:20] cult-like behavior when you when you
[1:12:22] can't question somebody and they're
[1:12:23] always and they're always right and
[1:12:25] everything they say is from God you've
[1:12:27] now developed a cult you're now
[1:12:29] worshiping a man we shouldn't worship
[1:12:31] the creature we should worship the
[1:12:32] Creator praise God
[1:12:36] and so easy example and Church by the
[1:12:38] end of his life now these are yeah these
[1:12:40] are dead bodies
[1:12:42] 900 up 909 if I'm not mistaken
[1:12:45] he proved to be full of murder where he
[1:12:47] proved to be fought a victory praise God
[1:12:50] for the truth full of the gospel and
[1:12:52] sisters there I'm living proof amen
[1:12:55] hallelujah thank God Amen I'm living
[1:12:57] prove amen that this is what the message
[1:12:59] produces praise God
[1:13:01] it produces life and victory and peace
[1:13:05] and all the fruits of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:07] Hallelujah when you obey the word of God
[1:13:09] when you really listen to what a
[1:13:10] preacher says you get the benefits of
[1:13:12] that when you retain God's knowledge you
[1:13:14] get God's power hallelujah oh thank God
[1:13:17] Amen Hallelujah
[1:13:20] he was arrested by doing awful sexual
[1:13:23] sins in theaters and everything
[1:13:25] and he his secretary would set up all
[1:13:28] these awful events
[1:13:30] sexually with all with many of the
[1:13:32] members
[1:13:34] he would also make make them all give
[1:13:36] their money to him and it was socialism
[1:13:38] like everybody got the same amount of
[1:13:39] money
[1:13:41] and they would use that scripture we had
[1:13:43] all things in common in the book of Acts
[1:13:44] we'll see how the devil slips in there
[1:13:50] that's without understanding
[1:13:52] right I mean there's so many awful
[1:13:53] things he did
[1:13:55] but by the end the government was
[1:13:56] catching on to him so in I believe it
[1:13:58] was 77 or 78 he finally moved down there
[1:14:00] he had the his followers set up this uh
[1:14:04] this camp out there I'm not sure I can't
[1:14:05] remember the word
[1:14:07] and as soon as he got there things just
[1:14:09] got worse and worse and worse and church
[1:14:11] I listened to some of the sermons it was
[1:14:13] some of the most filthy things I've ever
[1:14:14] heard in my life he was cussing like the
[1:14:16] worst sailor you have ever heard and I
[1:14:18] had to say what and and then now these
[1:14:20] people have the audacity to say that
[1:14:22] brother Branham produced that brother
[1:14:23] Brandon produced this Amen brother
[1:14:26] Brandon produced that hallelujah amen
[1:14:28] that's what he produced he produces
[1:14:30] sister Beatrice amen and a brother
[1:14:32] William praise God
[1:14:34] I'm what brother Brandon produced
[1:14:36] Hallelujah
[1:14:37] because I believe the Bible that brother
[1:14:39] brand was preaching praise God
[1:14:41] hallelujah
[1:14:42] because I'm God's beloved hallelujah
[1:14:44] amen so are you thank God Amen
[1:14:51] so here's a man full of murders because
[1:14:53] he did not retain in all those sermons I
[1:14:55] didn't even hurt I'm not even sure if I
[1:14:57] heard him the name Jesus and I think he
[1:14:58] could listen to four or five sermons
[1:15:06] again socialism socialism is the hero he
[1:15:10] destroyed the nuclear family took the
[1:15:11] children from the mothers allowed
[1:15:13] fornication foul language
[1:15:16] people would even stand up in the in the
[1:15:18] they'd have these discussions and talk
[1:15:19] about how they they wish they could hurt
[1:15:21] and kill their family members that
[1:15:22] didn't file their cult and he would he
[1:15:24] would agree with it
[1:15:26] that was way before the actual murders
[1:15:29] and even you you know don't don't do it
[1:15:31] I don't encourage you to do it but even
[1:15:33] they he recorded his last moments before
[1:15:35] everybody took the cyanide lace Kool-Aid
[1:15:38] and he was some people were standing up
[1:15:39] trying to convince him not to do it and
[1:15:41] he said just do it you'll have peace he
[1:15:43] said you can't live without me
[1:15:45] because he thought he was God
[1:15:49] right
[1:15:50] and this is what so this is the epitome
[1:15:52] of Romans 1. someone that goes against
[1:15:55] the word of God in the bad sense in the
[1:15:57] negative sense does it retain God in
[1:15:59] their knowledge
[1:16:00] and becomes God becomes the object of
[1:16:02] worship I think he died with 26 million
[1:16:04] dollars
[1:16:08] and everything was everything was
[1:16:10] centered around him
[1:16:12] and he was the final Authority
[1:16:14] and that's cult mentality that's cult
[1:16:16] mentality
[1:16:21] now let me read the warnings here you
[1:16:22] can I'm gonna take this off
[1:16:24] I looked at the only only sermon brother
[1:16:26] random preached to him that's on tape
[1:16:29] let me read some of these warnings here
[1:16:30] that brother bam gave I'm almost done
[1:16:32] here
[1:16:35] yeah Joan says he's God he says you can
[1:16:38] become God
[1:16:42] he was the god in the plains of mammary
[1:16:46] he'd electrocute people to torment them
[1:16:49] they had just I mean they had holes in
[1:16:52] the ground they would keep people locked
[1:16:53] up in isolation
[1:16:54] all kinds of wickedness
[1:16:59] now yeah here's where
[1:17:02] so here in 1956 here's what brother
[1:17:04] random preached
[1:17:07] now at the beginning he greets Jim Jones
[1:17:09] He said happy to see today our host
[1:17:11] Pastor brother James Jones from
[1:17:12] Indianapolis back there
[1:17:14] and he said certainly it's a privilege
[1:17:16] today to speak to such a host of people
[1:17:17] and I'm expecting to live an eternity
[1:17:19] within glory and have the privilege
[1:17:21] today to be standing to speak to you in
[1:17:23] fellowship with you around the word of
[1:17:24] God and it certainly is a privilege to
[1:17:25] do this didn't Jesus call Judas friend
[1:17:28] even on the night of his arrest
[1:17:32] so here's eight or nine warnings I'll
[1:17:33] try to go fast here
[1:17:35] I'm gonna wear anybody out the first
[1:17:36] warning is
[1:17:39] and he said and the pastor was weakened
[1:17:41] enough to let them get by with it
[1:17:42] talking about letting Hollywood in the
[1:17:44] church
[1:17:45] if you cry out against the thing the
[1:17:46] whole church has one big United Army
[1:17:48] then it would have ceased a long time
[1:17:49] ago so brother Graham calls out weak
[1:17:51] pastors and churches look at their
[1:17:52] videos if you look at the videos all the
[1:17:54] women got short hair they're wearing
[1:17:55] pants
[1:17:57] this man was not influenced by brother
[1:17:59] you can hear Brothers preaching up to
[1:18:00] the very end of his life amen simple
[1:18:03] modesty standards praise God he didn't
[1:18:05] believe the message he might have
[1:18:06] believed it for a few days or a few
[1:18:07] weeks or months or whatever but he
[1:18:09] didn't live it praise God
[1:18:11] but you and I we hear the word of God
[1:18:13] we're not hearers only we're doers of
[1:18:15] the word of God
[1:18:17] the second warning
[1:18:19] he's talking about sexy clothes which
[1:18:20] they wore it's on video you can watch it
[1:18:22] the women
[1:18:23] he says and now he rebuked sexy clothes
[1:18:25] he says I don't know whether the pastor
[1:18:27] will appreciate that or not
[1:18:28] and here's a man who ended up being a
[1:18:30] sexual pervert later on with hundreds
[1:18:31] and hundreds of immoralities
[1:18:34] but I'm telling you my sister at the
[1:18:36] Judgment bar I have to answer for it if
[1:18:37] I don't say these things I don't care
[1:18:38] how many people say liberation of women
[1:18:40] that's what he said dude James said Jim
[1:18:41] Jones was saying liberation of women
[1:18:44] that's a doctrine of the devil that's
[1:18:46] not in the Bible in other words women uh
[1:18:47] undressing was liberating them they can
[1:18:49] show their their form and and be sexy
[1:18:51] and all these things but remember said
[1:18:53] that's of the devil and I don't know if
[1:18:55] the pastor will appreciate that or not
[1:18:56] of course he didn't
[1:18:57] because he left brother Ram's message
[1:19:02] the third warning is that pastor Pastor
[1:19:04] should teach these things to you he said
[1:19:06] when the Christian Church went to God
[1:19:07] acting like the world you know your
[1:19:09] history or your pastor should teach it
[1:19:10] to you
[1:19:12] third warning to Jim Jones number four
[1:19:15] on makeup
[1:19:17] he says these little paint up Jezebels
[1:19:19] the same way you shouldn't do that shame
[1:19:20] on the pastors that fail to say that in
[1:19:22] their Church
[1:19:23] and what did Jim Jones have about a
[1:19:25] church full of pain and face women
[1:19:28] the fifth warning now look at this he
[1:19:31] Compares a weak Pastor to ahab's false
[1:19:34] prophets who told him to go up to his
[1:19:37] death now isn't that something
[1:19:39] and Jim Jones was the one who led all
[1:19:41] these people to their death
[1:19:42] talk about the spirit of God warning Jim
[1:19:45] Jones
[1:19:53] he says what do you say about it Pastor
[1:19:54] well I'll tell you I believe we'd better
[1:19:56] yes I think we ought to go up to raymoth
[1:19:58] Gilead what about the superintendent
[1:19:59] what does he say
[1:20:02] the pastor is compared to the false
[1:20:04] prophets
[1:20:05] that led Ahab to his death and Jim Jones
[1:20:08] was the false prophet that led the
[1:20:10] people to their death
[1:20:11] right there right on the tape
[1:20:14] that's just the fifth warning there's
[1:20:15] more Church the sixth warning the pastor
[1:20:17] needs to stay stay with the word if not
[1:20:20] your pastor's wrong he says
[1:20:23] he says now look Jim Jones is sitting
[1:20:25] there he said I don't care what the
[1:20:26] pastor says the word says so let's stay
[1:20:29] on the word
[1:20:30] and all most of these people just let
[1:20:32] brother man go on and they stayed true
[1:20:34] to Jim Jones and lost their lives for it
[1:20:37] because God's Prophet warned them that
[1:20:40] was the sixth time
[1:20:41] number seven this is all in the same
[1:20:43] sermon
[1:20:45] he says Pentecost they're afraid to
[1:20:47] speak the truth right I don't care if it
[1:20:49] hurts the pastor or who it hurts it's
[1:20:52] God's Eternal Word look at him standard
[1:20:54] Church look at him and stand there
[1:20:55] praise God
[1:20:57] and call them right right and wrong
[1:20:59] wrong
[1:21:00] and he has to leave it up to everybody
[1:21:02] God leaves it up to everybody make your
[1:21:04] choice let's choose life that we might
[1:21:06] live Hallelujah
[1:21:08] oh my to think of it God and His Mercy
[1:21:11] sent the prophet of God to Jim Jones to
[1:21:13] try to get him on track before he'd go
[1:21:16] off track
[1:21:17] and be full of murder and full of
[1:21:20] adulteries and full of wickedness
[1:21:22] maliciousness all these filthy words
[1:21:26] God and His Mercy sent the prophet does
[1:21:27] it remind you of anybody ought to remind
[1:21:29] you of Herod
[1:21:31] right Herod was a lover of pleasures
[1:21:33] married twice
[1:21:35] God still sent John the Baptist there
[1:21:38] to give him a chance because of God's
[1:21:39] love
[1:21:42] he said I don't care if it hurts the
[1:21:43] Pastor Jim Jones I don't care you have
[1:21:45] to speak God's truth see that's why I
[1:21:47] love defending this message
[1:21:49] I don't know if I told you but I believe
[1:21:50] I was born to defend this message praise
[1:21:52] God hallelujah I know I just do it in a
[1:21:54] real small way but that's okay God like
[1:21:56] small small people too praise God
[1:21:58] 's got a place in heaven for small
[1:21:59] people
[1:22:01] Hallelujah the eighth warning
[1:22:04] he says he's talking about Cain bringing
[1:22:06] the false uh worship the false sacrifice
[1:22:09] he said the flowers and everything Cain
[1:22:11] decorated his altar he worship God a
[1:22:13] true picture of the carnal church member
[1:22:14] today and the carnal-minded pastor who
[1:22:17] wants a church that sits higher than the
[1:22:19] rest of them in the city
[1:22:21] and all their seats all plush and
[1:22:23] million dollar pipe organ
[1:22:25] and everyone can tell by the all the
[1:22:27] result all the history searches Jim
[1:22:29] Jones when his church would get small
[1:22:31] because of his lies he'd go out and he'd
[1:22:33] perform fake miracles to try to get more
[1:22:34] people to come in and he build up his
[1:22:36] church again
[1:22:37] he basically what he did he copied
[1:22:39] Brothers his sermon but he would plant
[1:22:40] people in the in the in the sanctuary to
[1:22:42] pretend they got healed and then through
[1:22:44] that he would control them
[1:22:46] because they saw they saw somebody get
[1:22:48] off a stretcher but it was pretending
[1:22:50] the whole time it was just his
[1:22:51] secretaries and his workers
[1:22:53] and then he lead him into sexual sin
[1:22:55] money laundering
[1:22:57] all this wickedness
[1:23:00] and brother man warned him a carnal
[1:23:02] pastor wants all that he died with 26
[1:23:04] million dollars
[1:23:06] and the people were starving there like
[1:23:07] they they worked 16 hours a day on that
[1:23:09] compound it's supposed to be paradise it
[1:23:11] turned out to be not Paradise
[1:23:13] torture
[1:23:20] and then a ninth warning
[1:23:23] he said uh Dr so-and-so he's a classic
[1:23:25] man oh do you know
[1:23:27] how he speaks in two or three different
[1:23:29] languages he does all this and all that
[1:23:30] you know what he Pastor the great
[1:23:31] so-and-so church one time now isn't that
[1:23:33] something
[1:23:35] he said that's who he prayed to the
[1:23:36] denomination not to Christ and Jim Jones
[1:23:39] after this went into the denomination of
[1:23:41] the Disciples of Christ and brother and
[1:23:43] warned him don't go into nomination
[1:23:44] right there
[1:23:46] and he went into the denomination of the
[1:23:48] Disciples of Christ
[1:23:49] warned nine times now the church that
[1:23:52] tells me that's the love of God
[1:23:55] sent you a prophet signs wonders and
[1:23:58] miracles discernments genuine
[1:23:59] discernments
[1:24:00] and turned it down
[1:24:03] so in closing
[1:24:05] I want to after all those negatives I
[1:24:07] saw some of your faces you should have
[1:24:09] saw my face when
[1:24:10] when I was listening to something like
[1:24:12] I thought honestly Lord God who in their
[1:24:15] right mind could honestly compare
[1:24:16] brother Branham to Jim Jones there is no
[1:24:19] comparison
[1:24:22] there is absolutely no comparison
[1:24:24] because look at the fruits of both men's
[1:24:26] Ministries hallelujah thank God thank

[1:25:01] shall ye do also praise God
[1:25:04] Hallelujah
[1:25:07] thank God
[1:25:10] see church we have an obvious
[1:25:13] example here's what happens when someone
[1:25:16] retains the word of God in their
[1:25:18] thoughts brother random and here's what
[1:25:19] happens when someone doesn't retain
[1:25:21] their thoughts in the word of God full
[1:25:23] of murder
[1:25:25] full of adultery but over here brother

[1:25:44] what'd the Bible say the Bible said when
[1:25:46] we receive Christ we are partaking of
[1:25:49] The Fellowship of the mystery
[1:25:52] the intimacy that fellow worship
[1:25:54] Fellowship means intimacy I preached on
[1:25:55] that years ago the intimacy when Christ
[1:25:58] reveals the mystery of the godhead or
[1:26:00] the mystery of even the mother Harlot
[1:26:02] church or the mystery of the baptism of
[1:26:04] the Holy Ghost it brings you to an
[1:26:06] intimacy with Christ that other people
[1:26:08] don't know about
[1:26:10] right
[1:26:11] praise God
[1:26:13] how many uh how many are testimony to
[1:26:15] that that people recognize there's
[1:26:16] something different about you there's
[1:26:18] something different about your children
[1:26:21] people tell me all the time there's
[1:26:22] something different about your children
[1:26:23] brother Jesse thank God all those
[1:26:25] sermons all that spitting all that
[1:26:27] preaching praise God
[1:26:29] really it's Mom at home though really
[1:26:30] that's the reality of it by God's grace
[1:26:34] but church I know there's a difference
[1:26:35] because I was a sinner I was a
[1:26:37] full-blown sinner for all those years of
[1:26:38] my teens you know and then I was a
[1:26:40] full-blown denominational Church man
[1:26:43] but now I'm a holy ghost-filled saying
[1:26:46] praise God
[1:26:47] full of the word of God I know the
[1:26:49] difference
