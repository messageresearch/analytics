[0:01] This was the one I didn't finish a
[0:02] couple weeks ago. Uh, by the grace of
[0:07] God. 1 Corinthians
[0:09] 10:16. Then we'll go to uh 1 Corinthians
[0:15] 11:26. All
[0:18] right.
[0:20] Hallelujah. So, we're looking at
[0:22] communion here tonight. Now, I know we
[0:23] just had it back in April. I think it
[0:24] was April 6 we had it. So, that's the
[0:27] time where we do the natural symbols.
[0:29] Praise God of the bread and the wine.
[0:31] But uh we can have communion with Christ
[0:33] every single day. Did you have it with
[0:34] him this morning? Did you read your
[0:36] Bible this morning? Did you pray? If you
[0:38] didn't, you can do it tonight and then
[0:39] do it tomorrow. Praise God. Get back in
[0:42] the routine. You got to have the habit
[0:43] of staying in the word. Praise God.
[0:45] Hallelujah. Talk to the father. And you
[0:47] can talk to him, of course, all
[0:48] throughout the day. Hallelujah. What a
[0:50] blessing to have fellowship with
[0:52] Jesus. 1 Corinthians 10:36. Now, I want
[0:55] to just look at the the wording here.
[0:57] It's the cup of what? It's the cup of
[0:59] blessing. So, we want to look at the
[1:01] blessing here today. Also want to look
[1:03] at the examination here and the
[1:05] proclamation. So, as I was studying, I
[1:07] was like, "Wow, there's three uh
[1:09] purposes and and benefits here of uh
[1:12] communion, the Lord's supper." And of
[1:14] course, no doubt there's more, but these
[1:15] are just the three I picked up here as I
[1:17] was prepared for the service. Okay, so
[1:19] let's read this together on three. One,
[1:21] two, three. The cup of blessing which we
[1:24] bless, is it not the communion of the
[1:27] blood of Christ? The bread which we
[1:30] break, is it not the communion of the
[1:33] body of Christ? Now let's go to 1
[1:36] Corinthians 11:3 or 26, sorry,
[1:46] 26. Now, here's where we get the
[1:51] uh a blessing here by God's
[1:54] grace. So, this is the proclamation,
[1:57] right? So, we have I think I wrote down
[1:59] three here. We have the benefits of
[2:01] communion. We have the examination of
[2:04] communion. And here we have the
[2:05] proclamation or the
[2:07] proclaiming. Communion is a proclaiming
[2:10] of the fellowship. Verse 26, let's read
[2:13] it on three. 1 2 3. For as often as you
[2:16] eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
[2:20] shu the Lord's death till he come. Let's
[2:23] have one more word of prayer. If you
[2:24] have a need on your heart, let's make an
[2:25] to God. Father God, we come to you with
[2:26] praise and thanksgiving. We brought our
[2:28] bodies into subjection to the Holy
[2:30] Ghost, Lord. Now we feel like praising.
[2:31] Now we feel like worshiping, Lord God.
[2:33] Now we feel like hearing the word of
[2:35] God. Thank you, God, for the future
[2:36] home. We're longing for the future home.
[2:38] All God's children will worship at your
[2:40] throne, Lord. What a promise, Lord. And
[2:42] we just won't hear about you. The Bible
[2:44] says we'll see your face and you'll wipe
[2:46] away all the tears from our eyes. Lord,
[2:48] what a blessing. What a promise. What a
[2:50] consolation. Now, as we're here today,
[2:52] Lord, speak or speak through your word
[2:54] on communion. Lord God, help us to
[2:56] appreciate it more and enjoy the
[2:57] communion we can have each and every
[2:59] day. Lord, you've seen the verses I've
[3:01] felt led to to speak on. So, just
[3:03] inspire me, Lord. And Lord, just let the
[3:06] people's hearts be blessed. And I ask it
[3:08] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints
[3:10] said, "Amen." God bless you as you're
[3:12] being seated. Praise God. Have your
[3:14] Bibles handy. We're going to look at, as
[3:16] I told you a few weeks ago, we're going
[3:17] to look at uh some of the foreshadowings
[3:19] of communion. I think I found five in
[3:22] the Old Testament. So, uh I do have a
[3:25] few slides here or just visuals. Uh
[3:28] mostly scriptures. I think we're on part
[3:30] 17 if I'm not mistaken. I could be wrong
[3:32] on that, but I think I'm on part 17 on
[3:35] the Corinthians series. Um so, we read
[3:37] our text here. Now, we're finishing up
[3:39] here part six with the headship and the
[3:41] Lord's supper. Maybe next week by God's
[3:44] grace or maybe this Sunday we'll break
[3:45] into the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[3:46] Return to that since we had a wonderful
[3:48] move of the of the gifts of the Holy
[3:49] Spirit. By God's grace and I know Sister
[3:51] Naomi don't like me to point her out,
[3:52] but she's so humble, but I just want to
[3:54] recognize that a wonderful move of the
[3:56] Holy Spirit. So, God bless our sister.
[3:59] Hallelujah. Look at the gifts. And then,
[4:01] of course, uh the charity is in chapter
[4:03] 13. The whole point of the gifts is to
[4:06] spread the love of Jesus Christ.
[4:08] Hallelujah. Not to magnify a man, not to
[4:10] magnify a woman, but it's all to magnify
[4:12] the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And
[4:15] then uh he ends the book with
[4:17] resurrections and instructions and
[4:18] greetings. Okay. So, if you have your
[4:20] Bibles, you know, we we we preached
[4:22] through this whole chapter, but I want
[4:24] to just look at three uh points here
[4:26] about communion. We see three purposes
[4:28] of communion. Uh first, we see the
[4:31] benefits. Okay? So uh this is what we
[4:34] read here. The benefit of communion is
[4:36] blessing which means benefit. So this is
[4:39] the cup of benefit which we bless. So
[4:43] we're blessed by the blood which in for
[4:45] us it forgives our sins. The blood of
[4:47] Jesus Christ. But brother tells us and
[4:49] the Bible tells us it's the life of the
[4:51] blood. The life is in the blood. Right?
[4:54] And so the now we know the life of Jesus
[4:56] blood is the holy spirit and that life
[4:59] comes on us. Hallelujah. So one great
[5:02] benefit we have, one blessing from
[5:04] communion is the Holy Spirit freshly
[5:06] anoints us. How many can say amen to
[5:08] that? Hallelujah. We we feel so close to
[5:10] God after communion. Know we wash one
[5:12] another's feet no matter how dirty or
[5:14] they might look or how nice they might
[5:16] look. We wash each other's feet. We
[5:18] humble ourselves. We do what Jesus told
[5:20] us to do. Praise God. And we become
[5:22] servants. Praise God. You know, as I
[5:24] told you, you know, my my son and I,
[5:26] Malachi, have a friend. He's actually
[5:28] the one of the instructors at Taekwondo.
[5:30] And that's the one thing that kept him
[5:31] out of uh uh the Seventh Day Adventist
[5:33] church was that they washed feet. He's
[5:35] like I I could just never humble myself
[5:37] to that. And it was such a humbling
[5:39] thing that he even left the church. Now
[5:41] that's a Peter that's the same idea
[5:43] Peter had like you'll never wash my
[5:45] feet. And it's so sad our friend is so
[5:47] blind. I'm just waiting for a chance to
[5:49] tell him about it by God's grace.
[5:51] Hallelujah. That's what we want. We want
[5:52] an opportunity to tell him. But some
[5:53] people feel like that uh uh they just
[5:56] got so much pride or they think maybe
[5:58] maybe it's the opposite. Maybe they just
[6:00] tear themselves down so much they would
[6:02] never think of anybody uh washing their
[6:04] feet. But Jesus tells us to do it and to
[6:07] let it be done unto us. And he said,
[6:09] "Happy are you if you do these things."
[6:12] So it makes us happy to humble ourselves
[6:14] and be a servant. And it makes us happy
[6:16] to see that we have other people serving
[6:18] us. And the church said, "I'm your
[6:21] servant. You're a servant to me. We all
[6:23] serve one another." Amen. Hallelujah.
[6:25] None none none of us in God's eyes are
[6:27] of greater value. We're all children of
[6:29] God. Now, we know ministers have more
[6:31] responsibility. They'll be but they'll
[6:32] be judged more harshly, too. Hallelujah.
[6:35] So, we all recognize that. But in God's
[6:37] sight, we're all children of God.
[6:39] Hallelujah. Glory to God. So, there's
[6:41] the blessing. Now, here is the uh of
[6:45] course is the proclamation. So, every
[6:47] time we have the Lord's supper, it's
[6:49] proclaiming his death and his life.
[6:52] Hallelujah. Now, I got to get to that
[6:54] chapter here. I'd like to read it.
[6:58] myself. Okay. Yeah. Verse 26. For often
[7:00] as you eat this bread and drink this
[7:02] cup, you do shu the Lord's death till
[7:04] they come. It means to announce, to
[7:06] declare. So every time we take the
[7:08] Lord's supper, you're declaring Jesus
[7:10] died. Hallelujah. But church, you know,
[7:12] it's more than that. You know, he rose
[7:14] as well. Hallelujah. He rose, the Bible
[7:16] said, with healing in his wings.
[7:17] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Jesus can
[7:20] heal to the uttermost. He can save to
[7:22] the uttermost. Praise God. He makes
[7:25] known. So we make known the death of
[7:27] Christ or the life of Christ as well. We
[7:29] proclaim publicly, we publish uh the
[7:32] death and life of Christ. Hallelujah. So
[7:36] that's the second. So we get the
[7:37] benefits uh we get the proclamation. And
[7:40] then the one part we really need of
[7:42] course is the examination. That's verse
[7:44] 28. Now I don't have a slide for it
[7:46] because I I just uh realized that as I
[7:48] got here. Uh 28. Let a man examine
[7:50] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[7:53] and drink of that his cup. And remember
[7:55] what the Bible says in Corinthians.
[7:56] Don't examine yourself by other people.
[7:59] Don't compare yourself to other people.
[8:01] Compare yourself to Christ. Amen. My
[8:04] brother told me that on the phone a
[8:05] couple No, it was in person a couple
[8:07] months ago. My brother, my younger
[8:09] brother, and he quoted his pastor who
[8:11] pastors over there in Toledo, and he
[8:13] said how comparison is the thief of all
[8:16] joy.
[8:18] So you want to lose your joy, start
[8:20] comparing yourself to some other human
[8:21] being.
[8:23] It'll steal your joy real quick. Like,
[8:25] think, think how I'd lose my joy if I
[8:27] compare myself to Malachi on the piano.
[8:29] Boy, I'd be really in the in the I'd be
[8:31] really low, wouldn't I? I'd really be I'
[8:34] I'd be upset, man. I'd be really
[8:37] discouraged. But I can't compare myself
[8:39] to anybody else. I got to compare myself
[8:41] to Jesus. Hallelujah. Right. So, we So,
[8:45] we want to examine ourselves. So, we
[8:46] have the the the benefits, we have the
[8:49] proclamation of communion, and we have
[8:51] the examination of communion, and it's
[8:54] all important. Hallelujah. It's all a
[8:57] natural part of it, a spiritual part of
[8:58] it. Now, if you have your Bibles, let's
[9:00] go to Genesis 14 here by God's grace.
[9:03] Now, Brother Ram uses this story as a
[9:06] foreshadowing of the rapture and the
[9:09] marriage supper of the lamb. Hallelujah.
[9:12] So, let's go to Genesis 14. Now the
[9:14] verses we'll start at is 17. Now of
[9:17] course in verses 1-6, Abram delivers
[9:19] Lot. And brother Ram uses this to show
[9:22] how we as Holy Ghostfilled believers,
[9:24] we're wise virgins. We should intercede
[9:27] and pray for the foolish virgins or
[9:30] those that are less spiritual than us.
[9:33] Not to exalt ourselves, but to
[9:34] recognize, church, they could recognize.
[9:36] Abraham could recognize, "Wow, I've got
[9:38] an army. My arm is ready to fight. Lot
[9:41] is in a snare. He's he's he's chained
[9:44] up. He's not free, but I'm free and I
[9:47] can do something about it because I'm
[9:48] free. Hallelujah. In other words, if we
[9:51] see a brother or sister chained up, they
[9:52] don't have the victory. Uh they're
[9:54] snared. They're they're they're they're
[9:56] a chain of addiction, we can intercede
[9:58] and pray for them. Praise God. And the
[10:01] Bible said, "Go to them in a spirit of
[10:02] meekness, lest that spirit that's on
[10:04] them gets on you." Hallelujah. So, we
[10:07] see that Abraham has his he's stronger
[10:10] in the faith because remember Lot he he
[10:12] he pitched his tent towards Sodom and
[10:14] then pretty soon he's living in Sodom.
[10:16] Then he's pretty soon then he's in the
[10:18] gate of Sodom as a leader or some type
[10:20] of a judge or maybe a mayor. Brother Ram
[10:23] tries to modernize it for us. Maybe he's
[10:25] the mayor of a city uh given over to
[10:28] homosexuality. What an awful thing that
[10:30] was. And church uh I even heard this
[10:32] thought too. We're never told where
[10:34] where Lot got his wife from. He might
[10:37] have got his wife from
[10:38] Sodom. And then no wonder what happened
[10:41] to
[10:41] her. She hears the cries of her family
[10:44] which would pull on anybody strings
[10:45] whether father or mother and she turns
[10:47] and look backs and loses it. And Jesus
[10:49] said remember that one who turns back to
[10:51] look. Remember that so you don't turn
[10:53] back to your life of sin. Hallelujah. Be
[10:56] glad that God called you out. Praise
[10:58] God.
[11:00] Hallelujah. Yes. So see, he was a more
[11:03] spiritual believer and so he was able to
[11:06] rescue the weaker one or the one who was
[11:09] ens snared and not get ins snared
[11:11] himself.
[11:13] Hallelujah. Now verse 17 is where we
[11:15] pick up though. Now what happens after I
[11:17] think he had 318 soldiers? 318 soldiers
[11:21] defeat I think it was four or five
[11:23] kings. Was it five or was it four? Four
[11:25] or five. Yeah, they're listed there in
[11:27] chapter four uh or 14, but I didn't
[11:29] write them down. It's either four or
[11:32] five. Now verse 17. And the king of
[11:35] Sodom went out to meet him after his
[11:36] return from the slaughter of Chennom and
[11:39] of the kings that were with him at the
[11:40] valley of Shva, which is the king's
[11:42] dale. Now who meets Abram after this?
[11:46] Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth
[11:49] bread and wine. Sound familiar? Bread
[11:50] and wine. We're looking at foreshadowing
[11:54] of communion. Amen. Hallelujah. If you
[11:57] want if you want a victory with God's
[11:59] power, what do you think God would want
[12:01] to do with you? He'd want to eat bread
[12:03] with you. He'd want to drink wine with
[12:05] you. In other words, he'd want to sit
[12:07] down and fellowship with you. See how
[12:09] important it is for us to fellowship on
[12:11] Sunday or anytime. We should sit down
[12:13] and be together because that's what God
[12:15] would do. Amen. If God was here, what do
[12:17] we want to do? He'd want to eat with us.
[12:19] Praise God. Amen. In fact, that's one of
[12:21] the most personal things you can do in
[12:23] the in the Eastern culture is sit down
[12:25] and share a table with somebody. It's
[12:28] one of the most sacred, loving, uh, most
[12:32] expressive acts you can do to show your
[12:34] love. I we'll make a meal. Let's sit
[12:37] down and break bread together.
[12:39] So, what would God do with his friend?
[12:41] Oh, my Abraham is called the friend of
[12:44] God. And you and I are like Abraham. We
[12:46] stagger not at the promises of God, but
[12:49] we're strong in faith, giving God glory.
[12:51] Hallelujah.
[12:53] Right? Hallelujah.
[12:56] So, what does he do? What is And now
[12:57] Melzdc, some people think he's just a
[12:59] priest. Some people think he was made
[13:01] up. Melzdc was God. God came down. The
[13:05] spirit of God and brother Ram said like
[13:07] a vacuum, he he sucked in all the
[13:09] minerals and all the elements and
[13:10] created himself a a flesh
[13:13] body. Hallelujah. God took the the dust
[13:17] that he created and made a temporary
[13:18] body to dwell in. That was
[13:21] Melchzdc, king of righteousness. Oh,
[13:23] there's only one king of righteousness.
[13:25] It's God Almighty. Hallelujah.
[13:28] King of peace.
[13:30] Hallelujah. The great Melzdc. Now, we
[13:32] know we don't have to sing at the end.
[13:33] Okay, you remind me. Somebody remember,
[13:35] great is the Lord and greatly to be
[13:37] praised. Why don't you pull that one up
[13:38] there? Melzdc. He brings forth bread and
[13:41] wine. And Salem, of course, is
[13:43] Jerusalem, right? It's the short part of
[13:46] Jerusalem. Hallelujah. That's God's
[13:48] place. Uh Mount Zion, right? Zion, Mount
[13:51] Zion, the most beautiful place in the
[13:53] whole earth. Hallelujah. Is Jerusalem.
[13:56] That's right. Hallelujah. And he was the
[13:58] priest of the most high God. So God's
[14:00] invisible. So God came in a flesh body.
[14:03] Now God, the invisible God has a
[14:05] physical priest.
[14:06] Hallelujah. And he blessed him and said,
[14:09] "Blessed be Abraham of the most high."
[14:11] So what does he get after communion? He
[14:13] gets blessed by
[14:14] God. What do you get after communion?
[14:17] You get blessed by God. Hallelujah.
[14:20] And you fought all week to get to
[14:22] communion. You fought just like Abraham
[14:24] fought all those enemies. Hallelujah.
[14:27] You fought just to get free so you could
[14:29] come to the church, have communion, and
[14:31] what does God do? God blesses you
[14:33] because you fought so hard. Hallelujah.
[14:36] Amen. What a blessing. And that's what
[14:38] God would want. God would want to come
[14:40] down, have a meal with you, drink wine,
[14:43] eat bread, and bless you. Think, I mean,
[14:46] think of it. The God of the universe,
[14:48] what would he want to do with us? Eat
[14:49] with us, spend time with us.
[14:55] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. He blessed him and
[14:58] said, "Blessed be Abraham of the most
[15:00] high God, possessor of heaven and
[15:03] earth." Remember, God told Abraham,
[15:06] "Your seed will be like the dust." And
[15:07] he said, "It'll be like the stars."
[15:10] See, what's your possession is your
[15:12] saved loved ones. That's your possession
[15:14] in heaven. Hallelujah. And then
[15:16] eventually, of course, you have a
[15:17] mansion there in the future home. We
[15:18] talked we sang about that. You're a
[15:20] possessor of of of these portions of of
[15:24] eternity by God's grace of the future
[15:26] home. And you're a possessor of heaven.
[15:28] And not only that, Brother Chris, you're
[15:30] a possessor of things on the earth as
[15:32] well.
[15:34] Hallelujah. That's right. Yeah. Even
[15:36] even you know the land you possess like
[15:38] the house God led brother Rod to get and
[15:40] the house I got in different lands that
[15:42] is part of your possession. What's that
[15:45] name of that guy uh who wanted more
[15:47] lands? The Joo. No, what was it? Jabz.
[15:49] Yeah, the story of Jabz. He's like Lord
[15:52] increase my land. And that's what God
[15:53] did with Joshua later, too. God increase
[15:55] their land. There's something about
[15:57] that. Now, it doesn't matter how much
[15:59] you have. You just got to be faithful
[16:00] with what God's called you to have.
[16:02] Hallelujah. Be faithful. But there's a
[16:04] reason you have that land. There's a
[16:06] reason that you have a business here,
[16:08] you know, on this side or whatever you
[16:10] have or a job. There's a reason you're a
[16:12] possessor of earth and you're a
[16:14] possessor of heaven. Hallelujah. Doesn't
[16:17] the biatitudes say if you fear God, you
[16:19] inherit the earth. Blessed are the meek,
[16:21] for they shall inherit the earth. Praise
[16:22] God,
[16:24] brother Chris, if we can just be meek,
[16:26] which means just lower ourselves and
[16:28] humble ourselves under God. If we can
[16:31] just do that and submit to God, God will
[16:33] give us a portion of the
[16:36] earth. It's amazing. For a thousand
[16:38] years, we'll rule and reign over a
[16:41] portion of earth just because we were
[16:43] meek in the sight of God. Hallelujah. We
[16:47] didn't prideully exalt ourselves against
[16:49] God, but we humbled oursel to the plan
[16:52] of Almighty God. That's what Abraham
[16:54] was. He was a meek person, a meek man,
[16:56] just like Moses was the meakest of all
[16:58] of them in his day. Hallelujah. Verse
[17:01] 20. And blessed be the most high God,
[17:03] which hath delivered thine enemies into
[17:04] thine hands. So see, every time you get
[17:06] the victory, what was it? God gave you
[17:08] the victory.
[17:10] Church, just tell God who your enemies
[17:12] are and watch God deliver the enemies
[17:15] into your hand. Hallelujah. God allowed
[17:18] Abram to get the battle or the victory
[17:20] over those four cities, right? Those
[17:22] four kings. God gave him the victory.
[17:24] God gave the victory over you of the
[17:26] sins you battled. Hallelujah.
[17:28] God will deliver these into your hand so
[17:31] you can be victorious.
[17:33] Hallelujah. Which one of us are going to
[17:36] brag and say, "Well, it's my strength
[17:37] that got the victory." You know, it was
[17:39] God. God delivered it. God raised our
[17:41] strength. And then remember, he won't
[17:43] give us a battle we can't win.
[17:46] So, it's all set up. So, we get the
[17:48] victory by the grace of God.
[17:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My I can't even
[17:53] get out of the chapter. I thought I'd be
[17:54] flying through here. Oh my. And what did
[17:56] he do? He gave him tithes of everything.
[17:58] Look at that. Verse 20. Once Abraham
[18:01] realized, "Wow, my victory was all given
[18:03] by God. Everything I get, I'm giving 10%
[18:06] to God." Hallelujah. I'm giving tithe of
[18:10] everything I got. And the church said,
[18:14] see, it wasn't a law. Tithes did not
[18:16] start out as the law. The law came
[18:17] through Moses. And yes, tithes were in
[18:19] the law, but we see ties are before the
[18:21] law and Abraham in the law of Moses. And
[18:23] then they're after the law. Paul
[18:24] preaches about it in 1 Corinthians 9. We
[18:26] already preached through that chapter
[18:27] with you. Paul said, "The Lord hath
[18:30] ordained they which preach the gospel
[18:32] should live in the gospel in the same
[18:34] way they did under the Old Testament."
[18:37] That's right. But look what our father
[18:39] of faith does. Our father of faith
[18:41] recognizes every victory I did really
[18:44] wasn't me. It was
[18:46] God. And God's making me a possessor on
[18:49] things on earth. God's making me a
[18:51] possessor of things in heaven.
[18:52] Hallelujah.
[18:54] Oh my goodness. Thank
[18:57] God. Well, I was hoping to raise your
[18:59] faith tonight by God's grace. So, I was
[19:01] I should say I hope the Holy Spirit
[19:02] would raise your faith. Hallelujah. Not
[19:04] me, but I was hoping to get in the
[19:05] spirit so your faith could be raised
[19:07] like last Wednesday night. Verse 21. And
[19:10] the king of Sodom said unto Abram, "Give
[19:11] me thy persons and take the goods of
[19:12] thyself." And Abram said to the king of
[19:14] Sodom, "I have lift up mine hand unto
[19:16] the Lord, the most high God, the
[19:18] possessor of heaven and earth, that I
[19:19] will not take from a thread even to a
[19:22] shoe lash latchet." Now, think about
[19:25] that. Think about a thread, church. I
[19:27] just found a thread on the church floor
[19:28] this morning or this evening. A red
[19:30] thread. Abraham said, "I'm not going to
[19:32] take a thread from you or a shoe latch
[19:34] or a shoe." He's trying to He kind of
[19:37] trying to give him some extra blessings
[19:39] to be on his side. All right. But look
[19:42] what he says. He says, "Lest thou," he
[19:44] says, "But I will not take anything that
[19:46] is thine, lest thou should have say,
[19:48] I've made Abram
[19:50] rich." So, he wanted all the glory to go
[19:53] to God. Look at Abraham. What a man. And
[19:56] of course, of course, I know he's not
[19:57] Abraham yet. Save only that which the
[20:00] young men have eaten and the portion of
[20:01] the men which went with me. Anor,
[20:04] Escall, and Mamray. Let them take their
[20:07] portion. And the church said, so what do
[20:10] we see in here? Do we see a
[20:11] proclamation? Yes. God is proclaiming
[20:14] his greatness through Abraham. Do we see
[20:17] an examination? Yes. Abraham's examining
[20:19] himself. I'll give tithe of all. Do we
[20:22] see a benefit in Genesis 14? Yes.
[20:26] Possessor of heaven and
[20:28] earth. Oh, church. Hallelujah. God is so
[20:30] good to us. Amen. Now, here's a Oh, now
[20:32] here's a little quote. Now, this is for
[20:34] mainly for brother Chris, a new believer
[20:35] here, and maybe the children. So,
[20:37] children, if you can watch up
[20:39] here, now we're going to talk about the
[20:41] three bodies here just briefly. There's
[20:43] three bodies you have. There's the
[20:44] physical body. There's a theophony in
[20:46] heaven, which is like an angel body.
[20:48] Then there's the glorified body which is
[20:50] this body combined with all of them.
[20:52] This body's made new. This body is made
[20:53] eternal. So there's three bodies you
[20:55] have. Okay. Theophony is also called a
[20:58] celestial body in the Bible in the King
[21:00] James. Right? And the King James calls a
[21:02] glorified and glorified. Right? The King
[21:04] James calls this one a terrestrial. So
[21:06] you have celestial, terrestrial, and you
[21:09] have
[21:10] glorified. Now brother says this in
[21:12] 1965. He said, "Now we see the attribute
[21:14] sons of his spirit have not yet entered
[21:16] into the word form body." Now he's
[21:17] talking about theophony. A word form is
[21:18] theophony. It's a word body. But a
[21:21] theophony, this body is subject to the
[21:24] word and the earnest waiting for the
[21:25] earnest, the change of the body. Now the
[21:28] difference between you and Jesus as a
[21:30] son. See, he was at the beginning the
[21:32] word and a morphe body. So other words,
[21:35] Jesus was the logos or the pillar of
[21:37] fire or the first visible image of the
[21:40] holy spirit before he came in flesh.
[21:43] Okay? He came and lived in that in the
[21:46] person of Melzdc. So think about this
[21:47] church. The pillar of fire came down and
[21:50] pulled all this uh all these elements on
[21:53] him from the periodic table and became
[21:55] Melzdc. The pillar of fire. But then
[21:58] what happened when he left? Brother Ram
[22:01] said God dropped all those elements and
[22:02] that pillar of fire went back up to
[22:04] heaven. Okay, everybody got that?
[22:07] So Mckazac's body was physical body was
[22:10] just there for the whatever time God was
[22:12] with Abraham and that was it. That's
[22:16] right. Then later we never heard no more
[22:19] of Melzdc because he became Jesus
[22:22] Christ.
[22:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Melazdc was the
[22:26] priest but he became Jesus Christ. Now
[22:28] you bypass that. Now I'm going to show
[22:31] you a picture in just a moment because
[22:32] in that form he knowed all things and
[22:34] you've never been able to know that yet.
[22:36] I'll just skip ahead. Okay. Not past
[22:39] that. Okay. So, Jesus came this way.
[22:42] Thought. So, first Jesus was a thought
[22:44] of God. We were thoughts of God. I'm
[22:47] talking about the body of Jesus. Now,
[22:48] the body, not the spirit. The spirit of
[22:49] Jesus always
[22:51] was. But Jesus was the thought as far as
[22:53] God thought, I'm going to have a
[22:55] son. Then Jesus became the theophony,
[22:58] the word body, which is also the Holy
[22:59] Ghost, the pillar of fire. The word body
[23:02] put on flesh and become Melzdc. But see,
[23:04] we skip this. We have a theophony, but
[23:07] we've never entered into it
[23:09] yet. We skipped this and came right to
[23:12] the flesh sin
[23:14] body. But now Jesus went from thought
[23:17] theophony to flesh body, the word. Now
[23:20] he had a word body. We have a sin body.
[23:23] Major difference. And the church said,
[23:26] in other words, whenever Jesus was
[23:27] tempted by sin, he always overcame
[23:29] because his nature was to go back to the
[23:31] word nature.
[23:33] But because he had a word nature, but we
[23:35] have a sin nature. When we're tempted,
[23:37] if we're not careful, what do we what do
[23:38] we always go to? The sin nature
[23:40] sometimes. Not always, but sometimes.
[23:42] Before we were Christians, we always
[23:43] went to the sin nature. Because we have
[23:46] a sin nature. But Jesus, the Bible said,
[23:48] was the word made what? Word made flesh.
[23:51] So the flesh became word. He is his
[23:53] flesh had a word nature. That's why
[23:55] that's why he could turn down Satan at
[23:57] every one of his tricks. Hallelujah.
[23:59] Amen. That's why every time Satan gave
[24:01] him a temptation, he said, "It's
[24:02] written. It's written. It's written."
[24:04] Then he said, "Get behind me, Satan."
[24:06] Church, you can do the same tonight.
[24:08] Even though you got a sin nature, you've
[24:10] got a word nature in your soul.
[24:12] Hallelujah.
[24:13] Amen. You've got a word nature in your
[24:16] soul. And you can say, "It's written,
[24:18] Satan."
[24:20] And you can cast him down. Brother Ram
[24:22] said Jesus proved right there at the
[24:24] temptation of Satan that a Christian can
[24:26] defeat Satan anytime, any place,
[24:29] anywhere.
[24:31] And you don't have to use a gift. You
[24:33] just have to use the word. Hallelujah.
[24:36] That's right, church. Hallelujah.
[24:40] Amen. So Jesus was theophony. In other
[24:42] words, the logos, the pillar of
[24:45] fire. Proverbs 8 writes beautifully
[24:47] about that. And if you haven't read that
[24:49] lately, the Bible said, "I wisdom was
[24:51] with the father and I was his delight
[24:53] before the foundation of the world." He
[24:56] said, uh, the Bible says something like
[24:58] praising God before the foundation of
[25:00] the
[25:02] world. Before there was a world, the
[25:04] visible pillar of fire was dancing
[25:06] before the father. The son was dancing
[25:09] before the father. That's in Proverbs
[25:10] chapter 8. I preached it to you two
[25:13] years ago. I was hoping somebody would
[25:14] say, "Amen."
[25:16] You don't have to if you don't remember,
[25:18] but it's in the Bible. Hallelujah. I
[25:19] could preach it tonight. So he Jesus
[25:21] went from thought theophony flesh word
[25:24] body to the glorified body after the
[25:28] resurrection. Remember uh John 7 said
[25:31] the reason you couldn't receive the Holy
[25:32] Ghost before Jesus's uh time was because
[25:35] Jesus was not yet glorified, right? So
[25:38] glorified
[25:41] body. So we go from thought, the Bible
[25:43] said we're chosen in Christ before the
[25:45] foundation of the world. We skip our
[25:46] theophony, but our theophony is waiting
[25:48] in
[25:49] heaven. Paul says it in 2 Corinthians
[25:52] chapter 5, right? If we're absent from
[25:54] this body, we're present with the Lord.
[25:56] If this earthly house beat us off, we
[25:58] have a house not made with hands,
[26:00] eternal in the heavens. Somebody ought
[26:02] to be happy about that tonight. Praise
[26:04] God. If this body fails, if anything
[26:06] fails here and we leave this body, we've
[26:08] got a better home that we go to.
[26:10] Hallelujah. To live eternally. Praise
[26:13] God. It's called a theophony or word
[26:15] body or it's a celestial
[26:18] body. And so then we go from step two,
[26:21] then we go to theophony. If we die,
[26:24] uh if we're alive, and then we go to
[26:25] glorified. But if we get raptured, if we
[26:28] don't die, we go from thought to flesh
[26:30] to glorified. And the theophony will
[26:32] come down and meet us in the
[26:34] air. That's right, church. Hallelujah.
[26:37] Because death gets swallowed up in life.
[26:39] 1 Corinthians 15. And then our three
[26:42] bodies come
[26:44] together. Now, let's just review those
[26:46] for brother Chris especially. Uh this is
[26:48] this should be the easiest one.
[26:49] Terrestrials. It's it's us. We can eat,
[26:51] sleep, and drink. We can touch, feel
[26:53] glorified, and we can feel glorified
[26:55] body. With this body, you could they
[26:57] could have felt Jesus's glorified body.
[26:59] They did. He said, "Touch my hands." He
[27:01] He told Thomas, "Put your put your hands
[27:03] in my in the holes in my in my hands.
[27:05] Put your hand in my side." So this body,
[27:08] this body can touch glorified
[27:10] bodies. This is a flesh body of
[27:12] corruption under the curse of death. Sin
[27:14] nature is in the members. Now here's a
[27:16] theophony. Here's what people go to that
[27:18] are dead. Like St. Paul's in this right
[27:20] now. Martin Luther's in this. Brother
[27:21] Bram's in a theophony right now.
[27:23] Angley's in a theophony right now. It's
[27:26] eternal. It's a spirit-like angel-like
[27:28] body. It's waiting in heaven when it's
[27:30] unoccupied. So ours are waiting for us
[27:33] like a house is waiting to get moved
[27:34] into. Oh my. Hallelujah. I can't wait to
[27:38] move into that. Well, I can't wait to
[27:39] move into it for one reason. But when
[27:41] it's my time, then I can't wait to get
[27:43] to it. You understand what I'm saying? I
[27:45] don't want to leave my family before his
[27:47] time. Now, the theophony can touch other
[27:50] theophies because angels can
[27:52] wrestle, right? And brother Ran went
[27:54] over there and he was hugging people and
[27:55] that theophony remember he was hugging
[27:58] and uh and they can even see they can
[28:00] either hug hug v humans in visions. The
[28:03] theophony does not sleep, eat or drink.
[28:06] And then the glorified body. So Jesus
[28:07] raised in a glorified body. It can be
[28:10] touched by flesh bodies. It's not a
[28:12] spirit body. It's a glorified eternal
[28:15] flesh body. It can eat food and drink
[28:17] because Jesus said, "Give me some
[28:19] fish." But it's needed for the wedding
[28:21] supper, the the marriage supper of the
[28:22] lamb. It's needed for the millennium,
[28:24] and it's needed for the future home, the
[28:26] new city, New Jerusalem.
[28:29] All
[28:31] right. Now, let me finish this quote.
[28:34] You and I come like Adam. We come from
[28:36] the attribute to flesh to be tempted. We
[28:38] come from thought to flesh to be
[28:40] tempted. When this this life is finished
[28:42] here, if this earthly tabernacle be
[28:44] dissolved, we haven't already waiting.
[28:46] That's where we go. That is the word.
[28:48] Then we can look back and see what we've
[28:50] done. Now, we don't understand it. We've
[28:52] never become the word or the theophony.
[28:54] We've just become the flesh man, not the
[28:56] word or the theophony. But, and look
[28:59] clearly, it makes clear you will never
[29:01] be the word unless you was a thought at
[29:03] the beginning.
[29:05] Oh, hallelujah. That proves the
[29:07] predestination of God. See, you can't be
[29:10] the word unless you're a thought. And
[29:12] you had to be in God's thinking first.
[29:16] Hallelujah. How do you know you're in
[29:18] God's thinking? Because what Jesus says,
[29:20] you obey.
[29:22] Hallelujah. All that love me do what?
[29:25] Keep my commands. Amen. So friends,
[29:28] that's what you do with all your heart.
[29:30] Strive. Fight the good fight of faith.
[29:32] As I was saying on Sunday, fight as hard
[29:34] as you can to obey the commands of God.
[29:36] That will prove you were in God's
[29:38] thoughts before the foundation of the
[29:39] world because you're fighting against
[29:42] the powers of hell. You're not giving
[29:44] into the powers of hell. You're fighting
[29:46] against them because greater is he
[29:47] that's in you than he that's in this
[29:49] world. Ah
[29:54] my but you see in order to stand
[29:56] temptation you had to bypass the
[29:58] theophony. You had to come down here in
[30:00] flesh to be tempted by sin. And then if
[30:02] you stand, all the father has given me
[30:05] will come to me and I'll raise them up
[30:06] in the last days. See, you had to be
[30:09] first.
[30:11] Hallelujah. All right. Now, I can see
[30:14] I'm not going to make it very far
[30:16] tonight. I thought, boy, I always think
[30:18] I'm always going to make it faster. Now,
[30:20] go to
[30:21] uh go to Hebrews 7. I want to prove this
[30:23] to you here by God's grace. Hebrews
[30:26] 7:1.
[30:37] Verse one. For this Melzdc, king of
[30:39] Salem, priest of the most high God, who
[30:41] met Abraham, returning from the
[30:43] slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,
[30:45] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[30:47] of all, first being by interpretation
[30:50] king of righteousness, and after that
[30:51] also king of Salem, which is king of
[30:53] peace. Now look at this man. this, you
[30:58] know, people wonder, "Well, what kind of
[30:59] man was he?" Just read the Bible. Just
[31:02] believe what the Bible
[31:04] says. Why don't people just believe what
[31:06] the Bible says? Well, because then they
[31:09] know they got to change their their
[31:10] beliefs and they're going to lose people
[31:11] in their church, but just to be happy
[31:14] with a little church. Praise
[31:16] God. Right? Is this not a popularity
[31:20] contest? It's a contest of your faith is
[31:22] what it is. It's a test of your faith.
[31:26] Hallelujah. Look, look who who is this
[31:28] Melzdic without father. He never had a
[31:32] daddy. Well, only a couple. Well, only
[31:34] one person can fit into that. Triner
[31:36] will say there's only two people that
[31:37] can fit into that. Well, they I'm sorry.
[31:40] Yeah, they say two. Yeah, they'd say the
[31:41] uh they say the father and the spirit
[31:43] are the only two that didn't have a
[31:45] father. I'm sorry. We're not
[31:48] polytheistic here. Hallelujah. We're not
[31:51] tritheistic here. We're monotheistic
[31:54] here.
[31:55] Hallelujah. That's right, church. Amen.
[31:57] Without father, without mother, without
[32:00] descent, neither having beginning of
[32:02] days nor end of life. So, see, the
[32:04] trinitarians, they can't even make this
[32:05] Jesus because they say, uh, Jesus had a
[32:07] a mother. It was mother
[32:10] Mary. So, see, they they they don't this
[32:13] can't even be Jesus to a
[32:15] trinitarian because this man had no
[32:17] mother. And Catholics adore the mother
[32:20] of Jesus.
[32:21] Well, they they say uh well, if Jesus uh
[32:24] listened uh to to Mary at at the first
[32:27] miracle, then Jesus will listen to Mary
[32:29] now if you pray to her. What a bunch of
[32:31] lies that is. Hallelujah. Jesus even
[32:34] said, "It's not my time." He even tried
[32:35] to little rebuke her a little bit there
[32:37] by God's
[32:39] grace. And they'll try to make some lies
[32:41] about that. And that has nothing to do
[32:43] with
[32:44] prayer. Nobody prayed to Mary for Jesus
[32:47] to talk to her to change the water to
[32:49] wine. It was just Mary's desire. It was
[32:51] just a mother's desire. And so Jesus
[32:53] honored her. But see how they twist
[32:55] that? That's what the Bible says. They
[32:57] twist the scripture to their own
[32:59] destruction. And now they got prayer
[33:01] beads and and now they pray all these uh
[33:04] uh prayers that repetitious prayers.
[33:06] Vain prayers. That's what pagans do.
[33:09] Vain prayers. But we're real believers.
[33:11] Hallelujah. And we pray to the only one
[33:13] that hears our prayer. That's the
[33:15] mediator, Christ Jesus. Hallelujah.
[33:18] There's only one meter between God and
[33:19] man, the man Christ Jesus. Hallelujah.
[33:23] Not St. Cecilia, not St. Mary.
[33:26] Hallelujah. Not St.
[33:29] Brandon. But the reality of it is you're
[33:31] saints now. Praise God. Okay. I'm not
[33:33] going to get into Catholic doctrine
[33:35] tonight. Okay. Now, without descent,
[33:37] neither beginning of days. So, this man
[33:39] never had a first day. Jesus' body had a
[33:42] first
[33:43] day. So, see, this is not speaking of
[33:45] the body of Jesus. This is speaking of
[33:47] the spirit of
[33:48] Jesus. Yes. Jesus was fully man, fully
[33:51] divine. So this is speaking of the fully
[33:53] divine part of Jesus, right?
[33:57] Hallelujah. Neither beginning of days
[34:00] nor end of life. Amen. Hallelujah. So
[34:02] this man can never die.
[34:05] Hallelujah. That's right. So the those
[34:08] people that say that, oh Melzdc was a
[34:10] real priest and he died, you're you're
[34:12] rejecting this.
[34:14] You're not a Bible believer. You're a
[34:16] fairy tale teller. Hallelujah. That's
[34:19] right. He says, "But made like unto the
[34:21] son of God abideth a priest
[34:25] continually." Yes. Now consider how
[34:27] great this man was unto whom even the
[34:29] patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the
[34:31] spoils. Now notice it rep mentions twice
[34:33] he paid tithe.
[34:35] Twice. It's very important to pay tithe.
[34:38] The seed of Abraham will pay tithe.
[34:42] Like I've said before, I don't Do I? Oh,
[34:44] I do. It must have been ordained,
[34:45] brother, sister. I've said this before,
[34:49] if God can't get in here, then how is
[34:52] God going to get in here? I can't
[34:54] believe I had this in my pocket today.
[34:55] Praise God. That's right. We stopped the
[34:57] giant eagle. That's right, Caseia. Some
[34:59] people say, "Well, I love God. I love
[35:00] God." But you won't let God in here.
[35:02] Now, look at that. I got all this money
[35:03] and no no money. That's because it's all
[35:05] electronic.
[35:07] But you understand if people won't pay
[35:10] tithe, they won't give God offering, if
[35:11] they won't let God rule their money, and
[35:13] God gave them all that money, and that's
[35:15] God's money. Praise God. How's God going
[35:18] to get in there? They're not going to be
[35:19] born again. That's right. Because they
[35:21] won't even give God access to a little
[35:23] part. This is just a tiny part of your
[35:25] life. What about your thought life up
[35:26] here?
[35:29] But Abraham knew, oh, if I got anything
[35:31] in here, God gave it to me. Amen. Ah, if
[35:34] I've got anything in here, God gave it
[35:36] to me. Hallelujah.
[35:38] Same thing for you and I.
[35:40] Hallelujah. I'm having a good time
[35:42] tonight. How many having a good time?
[35:43] Praise God. Verse five. And verily,
[35:45] truly they that are of the sons of Levi,
[35:47] who receive the office of the priesthood
[35:49] have a commandment to take ties of the
[35:51] people according to the law, that is of
[35:52] their brethren, though they come out of
[35:54] the loins of
[35:55] Abraham. But he whose descent is not
[35:57] counted from them, receive tithe of
[36:00] Abraham, and bless him that had the
[36:01] promises.
[36:03] Amen. That was blessing God. And without
[36:06] all contradiction, the less is blessed
[36:08] of the better. But here men that die
[36:11] receive tithes, but there he receiveth
[36:14] them, of whom it is witnessed that he
[36:15] liveth. So look, he does receive them
[36:17] there. God does receive your tithes in
[36:20] heaven. See, God records your tithes in
[36:22] heaven. That's right. And as I may say
[36:26] also, Levi also who received tithe paid
[36:29] tithe in Abraham, for he was yet in the
[36:31] loins of his father when Melzdc met him.
[36:35] Church, did you realize that, brother
[36:37] Chris? Did you ever hear this? Levi was
[36:39] the grandson of
[36:41] Abraham. Hallelujah. The Bible says when
[36:45] Abraham when the grandfather paid
[36:48] tithe, his grandson was already paying
[36:51] tithe in
[36:54] Abraham. That gives us two
[36:56] understandings. You were in your
[36:58] grandfather's loins before you came
[37:00] here. At least
[37:04] God knew you were in your grandfather
[37:06] before you even came on the scene. Amen.
[37:09] And then God also then if if if if
[37:12] someone in your So brother, it'd be good
[37:14] to do your uh your DNA. Remember you
[37:16] did. It'd be good to find out which
[37:17] believers were in your family, brother.
[37:19] Check your grandpa, your great-grandpa.
[37:20] I know my grandpa served God. Amen. The
[37:24] Bible said when Abraham paid tithe, Levi
[37:27] was already paying tithe. In other
[37:30] words, God forneew because Abraham
[37:32] honored God, God would bless the next
[37:35] all the generations of his life.
[37:37] Hallelujah. Oh my. And look, Malachi,
[37:40] look, you're the manifestation of it. My
[37:42] grandpa paid it. I pay it. You're paying
[37:45] it. He pays his ties by God's grace.
[37:48] He's not full-time yet, but he'll be
[37:49] he'll be full-time pretty soon. It's a
[37:52] promise. So in other words, in other
[37:54] words, when my grandpa, brother Chris,
[37:56] paid tithe back in the 60s, it was as if
[37:59] Malachi was paying tithe. And what is
[38:02] that? It's God's fornowledge. In other
[38:03] words, God will bless your children and
[38:06] their children and all generations.
[38:08] Hallelujah.
[38:10] Amen. So start that's why all of us
[38:13] should start paying ti if God carries
[38:15] God will bless these next generations.
[38:18] Amen. And it also proves God knew you
[38:20] before you were even here. You were in
[38:22] your
[38:24] grandpa. Hallelujah. So that's what I
[38:26] can tell the little kids. They when they
[38:28] ask me, "Well, where was I before I was
[38:29] born?" In your grandpa. Oh, okay. And
[38:32] then they won't think about all the
[38:33] other questions that go around with
[38:34] that. Till they get about 13 or
[38:37] something like that.
[38:39] 12. But I can at least point them to a
[38:41] Bible verse.
[38:43] Hallelujah. That's right, church.
[38:46] Amen. Look at verse 10. For he was yet
[38:49] in the loins of his father when Melzdc
[38:52] met him. Think about that. Levi was in
[38:55] the loins of
[38:57] Abraham when he met
[38:59] God. Oh church, it's so important for
[39:01] you to meet God. Amen. Hallelujah. If
[39:05] you meet God, there's a good chance your
[39:08] children will meet God and then your
[39:10] grandchildren will meet God. Let's meet
[39:12] God. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm glad I met
[39:15] him. Praise God. I'm glad I met him. So
[39:18] my children can meet him. Hallelujah.
[39:20] And one day my gr grandchildren, no
[39:22] pressure on my children. Hallelujah.
[39:24] Just wait on God for the right one to
[39:26] come around. It's already
[39:28] 8:00. So brother Ram uses this story
[39:31] back to Genesis
[39:35] 14. Brother Ram said the believers like
[39:37] Abraham after we fight the good fight of
[39:40] faith. Who did Abraham meet? Melzdc.
[39:44] Brother Ram says after we fight the good
[39:45] fight of faith, we die, go to heaven.
[39:47] And who do we meet? Jesus, the high
[39:48] priest. And then what does Jesus do? He
[39:51] serves us
[39:53] communion. When we get to heaven,
[39:55] church, after the rapture, one of the
[39:56] main things we're going to do is have
[39:59] communion. And brother Chris, it ain't
[40:01] going to just be us there. Abraham's
[40:04] going to be there. Isaac's going to be
[40:07] there. Jacob is going to be
[40:10] there. Is that right? Think about that.
[40:12] Look, look down the table, Brother
[40:14] Chris. Abraham's down
[40:17] there. What? What? Isaac, Jacob, Brother
[40:22] Brandham. Hallelujah. Oh, the saints.
[40:26] And Jesus is going to feed us bread and
[40:29] pour out wine and we'll have
[40:31] communion because that's what God wants
[40:34] to do with you. God wants to have
[40:35] fellowship with
[40:37] you of all the things God could do. You
[40:40] know, we might think God would want to
[40:41] take us on a tour of the Milky Way,
[40:43] let's say, right?
[40:45] We might want to do that maybe someday.
[40:48] But what does God do when he meets
[40:49] Abraham? He's like, "Sit down. Let's
[40:51] have some bread and wine and let me put
[40:54] a blessing on
[40:56] you." Makes me want to go over here.
[40:58] Now, I prayed for this when I he was
[41:00] younger. But I bless this this I bless
[41:02] my son in the name of Jesus
[41:05] Christ. Possessor of heaven and
[41:09] earth.
[41:10] Hallelujah. That's what that's what Mel
[41:12] Castedc did.
[41:15] I bless you. You're a possessor of
[41:18] heaven and earth. Oh, glory to God.
[41:20] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And I will and
[41:24] you will be delivered of all your
[41:26] enemies. Oh. And the church said,
[41:29] "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. By the king of
[41:33] righteousness and by the the king of
[41:36] Salem, the king of peace." Hallelujah.
[41:39] Oh
[41:41] my. And so we get that. Now, let's go to
[41:44] Matthew. I'm almost done because I
[41:46] realize I'm not going to finish this
[41:48] tonight. I think
[41:51] it's I think it's 25, but let me look it
[41:55] up where he
[41:58] says, "I'll drink it a new." If anybody
[42:02] knows
[42:05] it, that's what that's what I was saying
[42:09] here. Matthew 26. Yes. 26:20.
[42:14] 26:27 And he took the cup and gave
[42:17] thanks and gave it to them, saying,
[42:18] "Drink ye all of it, for this is my
[42:20] blood of the new testament, which is
[42:22] shed for many, for the remissions of the
[42:24] sins." And the church said,
[42:27] Jesus shed his blood for this awful
[42:30] sinner right here. Amen.
[42:33] Hallelujah. And it's remission. Reit
[42:36] means to send
[42:37] away. Amen. All my sins are away. You
[42:41] ask me why I'm happy, all my sins are
[42:43] gone. Hallelujah. They're sent away.
[42:46] Praise God. That's why he shed his
[42:48] blood. So I can be forgiven. And then I
[42:51] can have children. And then children's
[42:53] children and they'll pay ti. Hallelujah.
[42:56] Because I paid tithe.
[43:00] What a promise. Amen. What a promise.
[43:04] Hallelujah. But look at verse 29. Here's
[43:06] what I was saying, brother Chris. But I
[43:08] say unto you, I will not drink
[43:09] henceforth of the fruit of the vine till
[43:12] that day when I drink a new with you in
[43:14] my father's
[43:16] kingdom. That's after the rapture. G we
[43:19] meet Jesus in the air. He takes us up to
[43:21] the third heaven. We call it maybe you
[43:23] might call it the seventh dimension.
[43:25] Hallelujah. And then he serves us
[43:27] communion there by the grace of
[43:30] God. Let me find that verse. And that's
[43:32] exactly what Melzdic did. After the
[43:34] battle, Melzdc served him bread and
[43:37] wine,
[43:39] communion. Let me look up that Abraham
[43:42] eat. Uh, it just came to my mind
[43:48] there. Anybody got that verse
[43:53] memorized? Oh, yeah. There it is.
[43:55] Matthew 8:11. There it is. Thank you,
[43:56] Lord. Thank
[44:00] you. Hallelujah. And I say unto you,
[44:03] Matthew 8:11, that many shall come from
[44:05] the east and west and shall sit down
[44:06] with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the
[44:09] kingdom of what?
[44:11] Heaven. We're raptured. We meet Christ
[44:13] in the air at the rapture. He takes us
[44:15] up then for the marriage supper of the
[44:17] lamb. And then in that kingdom, we eat a
[44:21] new and we sit down with Abraham, Isaac,
[44:24] Jacob, and all the
[44:26] saints. Hallelujah. What a promise.
[44:30] All because we recognize God as our
[44:33] king. He's our righteousness. He's our
[44:35] peace. We paid ti to him. He gave us the
[44:38] victory. We fought his battles. Church,
[44:42] let's let's think today. What battles
[44:44] does God want you to
[44:45] fight? Sisters, you can fight battles,
[44:48] too. A lot of women in the Bible got
[44:50] victories in battles. Hallelujah. Over
[44:53] lots of different things.
[44:55] Hallelujah. God wants us to fight. He
[44:58] wants to to us to obtain the kingdom.
[45:00] Praise God. Hallelujah. He wants us to
[45:03] pay ti of course. He wants though he
[45:05] wants us to have inner uh I'm sorry. He
[45:07] wants us to have communion with him so
[45:08] that we'll be able to get victory and
[45:11] deliverance from our enemies.
[45:14] Brother Ram said the greatest fear we
[45:16] have is death. Right? Many times a
[45:19] Christian's greatest fear is death.
[45:22] Hallelujah. Church. God wants to give us
[45:25] victory over every fear. God wants to
[45:27] give us victory over every foe that we
[45:29] face. Hallelujah. We must fight the good
[45:33] fight of
[45:34] faith. Oh, what a
[45:37] blessing. Well, let me close with this
[45:39] here. Let's see. Where was I at? Okay,
[45:40] read that. Let me close. It's already
[45:45] 8:05. I don't know if I can get to that
[45:48] one
[45:50] here. So, now you know what I'm gonna
[45:52] probably preaching maybe the next few
[45:54] weeks here. See that? These are all
[45:56] foreshadowings of communion. What was
[45:59] that last
[46:00] one? Yeah, I'm going to close with this
[46:02] one. Okay, go to John 17. I'm closing.
[46:04] Uh, give me five minutes here. I'm set a
[46:05] timer. Five minutes. Don't forget to set
[46:08] your timer, Brother Jesse. Okay. Thank
[46:09] you. John 17. Brother calls this, well,
[46:13] the I'm sorry, all the Bible uh
[46:15] commentators call this Jesus's high
[46:17] priestly
[46:20] prayer. Amen.
[46:33] All right. Verse one. These words spake
[46:34] Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven
[46:36] and said, "Now see church, you can do
[46:37] the same thing. When you pray, look up
[46:39] to heaven." You don't have to close your
[46:41] eyes every time. Sometimes when you
[46:43] pray, look up to heaven and say, "God,
[46:45] hear my humble prayer. Jesus did it." If
[46:48] Jesus did it, you can do it. If you fall
[46:50] asleep when you close your eyes, open
[46:51] your eyes. Look up to heaven. Look past
[46:53] the tile. Hallelujah. Look past the
[46:56] drywall. Amen. Look into the unseen.
[46:59] Come on, church. Amen. Faith looks at
[47:01] the unseen.
[47:04] Or just walk outside or come to the
[47:06] church or something like that. Come to
[47:07] church. Stand out there. Look up to
[47:08] heaven. Pray to God. Hallelujah.
[47:12] Says, "Father, the hour's come. Glorify
[47:14] thy son that thy son may also glorify
[47:17] thee. as thou has given him power over
[47:19] all flesh, that he should give eternal
[47:21] life to as many as thou has given him.
[47:24] And this is life eternal, that they may
[47:26] they might know thee, the only true God,
[47:29] and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
[47:31] See, you have to know the invisible and
[47:33] you have to know the visible forms of
[47:35] God. Hallelujah. Because God was
[47:38] manifest in the flesh, not a second
[47:41] person. God was manifest in the flesh.
[47:44] That's right.
[47:45] And now, oh father, glorify thou me with
[47:47] thine own self, with the glory which I
[47:50] had with thee before the world was.
[47:51] That's Proverbs 8, like I said, the
[47:53] visible pillar of fire before the
[47:55] invisible God.
[47:57] Yes, I have manifested thy name unto the
[48:00] men which thou gavest me out of the
[48:01] world. Thine they were, and thou gavest
[48:04] them me, and they have kept thy word.
[48:06] So, what's a real sign you're a
[48:07] Christian? You keep the word of God.
[48:10] Like I said earlier, that's how you know
[48:11] you're one of God's children. You keep
[48:13] the word.
[48:14] Let other people, they can throw the
[48:16] word down. They could they could talk
[48:17] bad about the Bible, but there's
[48:19] something about you. You can't do that.
[48:20] Praise God. Because you were in the
[48:23] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[48:25] the world. Praise God. You were
[48:27] manifested to obey the word of
[48:31] God. Verse seven. Now they have known
[48:34] that all things whatsoever thou has
[48:36] given me are of thee.
[48:38] For I have given unto them the words
[48:40] which thou gavest me, and they have
[48:41] received them, and they have known
[48:43] surely that I came out from thee, and
[48:45] they have believed that thou did send
[48:46] me." How many believe God sent Jesus?
[48:49] Hallelujah. Look at this. I pray for
[48:51] them. He's praying for his disciples. I
[48:53] pray not for the world, but for them
[48:55] which also thou has given me, for they
[48:57] are thine. Now, there's a difference
[48:59] between us and Jesus. Jesus didn't pray
[49:01] for the world, but we're supposed to
[49:02] pray for the lost because we don't know
[49:04] who's going to be saved. Jesus knew,
[49:07] right? He knew. He knew. Some of you
[49:09] believe, one of you don't. The Bible
[49:11] said he knew from the beginning who
[49:12] Judas was, right? He knew. So he don't
[49:16] have to pray for the world. We have to,
[49:17] brother
[49:24] Chris. Yeah. It was opportunity for
[49:26] grace. Yeah. It was a bishop prick. The
[49:28] Bible called it. That's the opportunity
[49:29] to be a leader. And brother Bram said
[49:31] God gave uh Judas the greatest calling
[49:34] in the Bible to be an apostle or
[49:35] missionary. and he turned it down. Be
[49:38] That's God's love. God's love offers you
[49:41] repentance. God offered it to Cain. God
[49:43] said, "If you just obey, you'll rule
[49:45] over
[49:46] Abel." That's God's love. Good question.
[49:49] Let's give it two
[49:50] class. Hallelujah. That's right, church.
[49:54] He didn't pray for the world. He prayed
[49:56] for all the elect because he knew who
[49:58] they were. We
[50:00] don't. And all mine are thine and thine
[50:03] are mine and I'm glorified in them. See
[50:05] church, let's glorify Christ in our
[50:07] bodies. Verse 11. And now I am no more
[50:10] in the world, but these are in the
[50:12] world, and I come to thee, holy father.
[50:14] And it ain't no pope. They're looking
[50:16] for a holy father. Now they're
[50:18] deceived. They're going to get a
[50:20] demon-possessed holy father is what
[50:21] they're going to get. But God almighty
[50:23] is the only holy father. That's right.
[50:27] Keep through thine own name those whom
[50:29] thou hast given me that they may be one
[50:32] as we are. So see that, brother Chris?
[50:33] God keeps us through the name of Jesus
[50:35] Christ. So speak the name of Jesus
[50:37] Christ. Right, Malachi? Right, young
[50:40] young girls? That's how you're kept.
[50:42] Speak the word. We're kept through the
[50:44] name of Jesus. Hallelujah. Call on
[50:46] Jesus. Call the name of Jesus before you
[50:48] start your car. Right, brother? That's a
[50:51] good man right there. That's a good man.
[50:54] He calls on Jesus before he starts.
[50:56] That's a godly man. Hallelujah. Amen,
[51:00] brother.
[51:01] See, we're kept through the name of
[51:04] Jesus
[51:05] Christ. Yes, sir. Verse 12. While I was
[51:08] with them in the world, I kept them in
[51:10] thy name. Those that thou gavest me, I
[51:12] kept, and none of them is lost, but the
[51:14] son of predition. There's Judas is
[51:15] scared. That the scripture might be
[51:17] fulfilled. There's my five minutes.
[51:19] Mineh. Yeah. If I'm And now come I to
[51:23] thee, and these things I speak in the
[51:24] world, that they might have joy
[51:26] fulfilled in themselves. I have given
[51:29] them thy word, and the world hath hated
[51:31] them, because they're not the world,
[51:33] even as I am not of the world. I pray
[51:35] not that thou shouldest take them out of
[51:36] the world, but thou shouldest keep them
[51:38] from the evil. See, sometimes that
[51:41] that's why suicide is a sin because you
[51:44] want to escape all the pain. But Jesus
[51:45] is like, I'm not praying to take them
[51:47] out. I'm praying that they'll overcome
[51:49] with the word. Hallelujah.
[51:52] Suicide is the easy way out. It's a sin.
[51:54] Now, it's not the unpardonable sin, but
[51:56] Jesus is saying, "You don't need to get
[51:58] out. You just need more of me."
[52:06] Glory.
[52:08] Now, they are not of the world, even as
[52:11] I am not the world. Verse 17. So, see
[52:13] church, you're in the world, but you're
[52:14] not of the world. Verse 17. Sanctify
[52:16] them through thy truth. Thy word is
[52:18] truth. And as thou has sent me into the
[52:20] world, even so have I also sent them
[52:22] into the world. and for their sakes I
[52:24] sanctify myself that they also might be
[52:26] sanctified through the truth. Now
[52:28] church, listen. You are in verse 20.
[52:30] Everybody say, "I'm in 20." Ready? I'm
[52:32] in 20. Jesus not only prayed for his
[52:35] apostles, he prayed for you. And church,
[52:39] remember who else did he pray for? Who
[52:40] was going to quit? Peter.
[52:43] But Jesus said, "But I prayed for you
[52:45] that your faith doesn't fail."
[52:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Not only did your mom
[52:49] or daddy or grandma or grandpa pray for
[52:51] you, but Jesus, hallelujah, the high
[52:54] priest of heaven prayed for you. And you
[52:56] know God's going to hear his prayer.
[52:58] Hallelujah. Oh, thank God.
[53:02] He just didn't pray for others. He
[53:04] prayed for you in verse 20. Me. Neither
[53:07] pray I for these alone, but for them
[53:08] also which shall believe on me through
[53:11] their word. We're believing on Christ
[53:13] through the word of the apostles. Right
[53:15] now, church, you're believing through
[53:16] John's word. If you read the book of
[53:19] John, you're believing through John's
[53:21] word. You're the answer to Jesus's
[53:22] prayer.
[53:24] Amen. Hallelujah. I hope somebody's
[53:27] happy here tonight. Praise God. Verse
[53:29] 22. And the glory which thou gavest me,
[53:31] I have given them that they may be one
[53:33] even as we are one. I'm almost done. I
[53:36] in them and thou in me. See, Christ has
[53:38] to be in you. It's I in them. That they
[53:41] may be made perfect and one that the
[53:43] world may know that thou has sent me and
[53:45] hast loved them and hast loved me. See,
[53:49] church, you need Christ in you so you
[53:51] know Christ loves
[53:53] you. If you've got Christ in you, you
[53:56] know he loves you. Praise God. You know
[53:58] why I like Abraham? Because he has mercy
[54:00] on you when you don't deserve it. You
[54:02] lie. You make mistakes. Yet you still
[54:04] get
[54:05] blessed. Now, you're going to get
[54:07] spanked and you're going to get
[54:08] corrected, but you're also going to get
[54:09] blessed
[54:11] still because you're a possessor of
[54:13] heaven and
[54:17] earth. Verse 24, this is my last verse.
[54:21] Father, I will that they also whom thou
[54:23] has given me be with me where I am, that
[54:27] they may behold my glory, which thou has
[54:30] given me, for thou lovest me before the
[54:33] foundation of the world." Brother
[54:36] Brandham says this, you've heard me read
[54:37] it before, but if you haven't, now you
[54:39] get to hear it. Brother Ram said, Jesus
[54:42] asked only for one thing in his prayer
[54:45] to the father. He says, you know what it
[54:47] was?
[54:50] one thing. After all of his sacrifice
[54:52] and all he did here on earth, the life
[54:55] that he lived, the path that he walked,
[54:57] he asked for one thing, that where I am,
[55:01] there they may be
[55:03] also. In other words, Jesus said, "I
[55:05] just want one thing. I want those that
[55:07] believe in me to be with
[55:12] me." He asked for our fellowship. That's
[55:16] the only thing he asked the father in
[55:17] the prayer. Your companionship forever.
[55:22] Hallelujah. That's all he asked for.
[55:25] Now, if you could talk to God, what
[55:26] would you ask for? Don't say it out
[55:29] loud. I'm
[55:31] good. But what would Jesus ask for? He
[55:34] just said, "Could I have communion with
[55:35] brother Rod? Could I have communion with
[55:38] brother Chris tonight?" That's all he
[55:40] would ask for. You know, you know why?
[55:42] Because he knew everything else was
[55:43] going to be taken care of.
[55:45] I just want to spend time with my
[55:46] children. That's the only thing he asked
[55:50] for was communion. He serves the bread
[55:53] and wine. He wants to spend time with
[55:55] us. He wants to talk to
[55:58] us. He even wants his glory to be
[56:00] manifested through us. And church, you
[56:03] know, he also wants to receive our
[56:05] worship. How many want to worship Jesus
[56:07] tonight? Let's stand to our feet.
[56:09] Musicians can come.
[56:19] Hallelujah. There was my five minutes.
[56:21] So, I got five extra by God's grace.
[56:23] Little
[56:24] overtime. Oh, how many love the Lord
[56:26] tonight? Praise God. Oh, I just love the
[56:28] word of God. Hallelujah. What a
[56:29] blessing. Thank you,
[56:33] Jesus. Why don't you get that song
[56:35] ready? Such love. And get the one uh
[56:38] about
[56:39] Zion.
[56:44] Also pull up that one. Uh let's play
[56:47] that one. Uh down from his glory. Oh,
[56:51] how I
[56:54] love
[56:57] you. How
[57:00] I
[57:02] adore
[57:05] you, my
[57:08] breath, my son.
[57:11] [Music]
[57:13] Sunshine, my
[57:16] all in
[57:21] all the
[57:24] great creator.
[57:28] [Music]
[57:31] He
[57:32] came my
[57:36] [Music]
[57:38] savior and all God's
[57:46] fullness dwell
[57:50] in. Just keep playing that. Let's have a
[57:52] word of
[57:53] prayer. Father God, we thank you for
[57:55] tonight. Lord, we've heard your word.
[57:58] Lord, it's so awesome to see if you, the
[58:01] God of heaven, would ever come down and
[58:03] fellowship with
[58:04] somebody, what would you want to do? And
[58:07] Lord, you would just want to have
[58:09] communion, Lord
[58:10] God. You would just want to give us some
[58:12] bread and wine and bless us, Lord. What
[58:15] a blessing that we can be in the house
[58:16] of God tonight, Lord God, to hear the
[58:19] blessings of Almighty
[58:23] God. Hallelujah, Jesus. Thank you for
[58:25] these
[58:26] blessings to know that we were chosen in
[58:29] our grandfather's
[58:31] loins and predestined that we would come
[58:34] forth and we would continue the faith
[58:36] walk of
[58:40] Abraham. Lord Jesus, thank you for
[58:43] having communion with us tonight. Lord
[58:46] God, you ask one
[58:48] thing that where I am there they may be
[58:53] also.
[58:55] Thank you for praying for us, Lord God.
[58:58] Because we've heard the word of John
[59:00] tonight, Lord God. We are those who've
[59:02] heard the word. Thank you for praying
[59:04] for me, Lord God. That my faith would
[59:07] not fail as you did with
[59:11] Peter. For there is no not one
[59:13] righteous, Lord God. For all have sinned
[59:16] and fallen short of the glory of God.
[59:18] None seeketh after God.
[59:23] We're all in a lost state, but in your
[59:26] great mercy and grace, you came to save
[59:28] us, Lord God. You came to seek and save
[59:31] us that which was
[59:33] lost. Lord, you came all the way down to
[59:36] Akran, Ohio in 2000 and saved my
[59:39] wretched soul, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[59:43] Partly believe I believe because my
[59:45] grandpa paid ti and offerings, God.
[59:48] Hallelujah.
[59:49] You're faithful to your promises, Lord
[59:51] God. You keep your word. You know all
[59:54] them that will love you. Surely the Lord
[59:58] knoweth them that are his, Lord God.
[1:00:00] It's the seal of
[1:00:01] God. That he that nameth the name of
[1:00:04] Christ depart from iniquity, and the
[1:00:06] Lord knoweth them that are
[1:00:09] his. Oh God, thank you, Lord, that I've
[1:00:12] known of
[1:00:13] God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I can't
[1:00:17] think of anything more wonderful to
[1:00:18] know, Lord God.
[1:00:21] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:00:25] Jesus. I give you glory tonight, Lord
[1:00:29] Jesus. Let the glory of God anoint us so
[1:00:32] we can glorify
[1:00:34] Jesus. Strengthen our faith tonight,
[1:00:36] Lord. I wasn't preaching on money, Lord.
[1:00:39] I was just showing God
[1:00:42] how you give us every victory.
[1:00:45] You defeat all of our foes and it's a
[1:00:49] joy to give back to you, Lord
[1:00:51] God. You make us victorious. You make us
[1:00:54] possessor of heaven and
[1:00:57] earth. And all you want to do is have a
[1:00:59] little talk with us, fellowship with
[1:01:03] us. How great you are. How awesome you
[1:01:07] are
[1:01:09] tonight. You asked for one thing. And
[1:01:11] God, if we would ask for one thing
[1:01:13] tonight, Lord, what would we ask for? I
[1:01:15] trust it would be your fellowship since
[1:01:19] that's what you asked for. God, help us
[1:01:22] not to ask for carnal things, Lord God.
[1:01:25] I know sometimes we need them, Lord God,
[1:01:26] but help us to ask more for the
[1:01:29] spiritual things, Lord God.
[1:01:32] Lord, that we could have communion with
[1:01:33] you. You would heal the sick. You'd
[1:01:36] raise the dead, Lord God. You'd cast out
[1:01:38] devils, God. You'd grant revelation. You
[1:01:41] give us prophecies. You give us words of
[1:01:43] knowledge, words of wisdom. Hallelujah.
[1:01:46] Words of faith. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:01:49] God. Oh Lord, we appreciate your
[1:01:52] fellowship tonight, Lord
[1:01:54] God. Lord, before we leave this place,
[1:01:57] may each person express their
[1:02:01] appreciation. Lord, thank you for
[1:02:02] praying for me. Now, church, just thank
[1:02:04] the Lord for praying for you right now.
[1:02:05] Would you do it? Lord, I thank you for
[1:02:07] praying for me. If it wasn't for your
[1:02:09] prayer, I'd be lost. I'd be
[1:02:12] lost. Satan would have sifted me for
[1:02:14] sure if it wasn't for the grace of God.
[1:02:17] Thank you, Lord God. You've kept me
[1:02:20] through your name. Hallelujah. Jesus
[1:02:22] kept me through your holy name. Wasn't
[1:02:25] my power. Wasn't my goodness. It was
[1:02:28] your
[1:02:30] grace. Greater is he that was in me than
[1:02:33] he that's in the world. Thank you, Lord
[1:02:35] Jesus.
[1:02:38] We have faith beyond circumstances
[1:02:40] tonight. We have faith that staggers not
[1:02:43] at
[1:02:44] the staggers not Lord, but it gets
[1:02:47] stronger. Giving you glory. Hallelujah.
[1:02:51] We give you glory
