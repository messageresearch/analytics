I seem to get stuck and back to the problem um hurried is that right buried oh buried my by my stuff yeah last night I went to a youth banquet God allowed the minister to use a story that directly hit right on my problem even though he got pulled many other ways he came back three or four times just to finish the story he was using the sample uh as a type but for me that exactly thing was my struggle it was almost like a personal advice someone would give me in person and that I am not alone someone had done it and overcome I praise God for being real personal faithful and thanks for helping me when all hope seems gone and he came and gave me hope and light he cares about all big and little things in our life thank you Jesus Christ we praise your holy name my friend even turned

verse one it's good to be in the house of the Lord It's good to see the Saints this morning praise the Lord appreciate everybody pressing the route to the house of God looking forward to a wonderful Fellowship today with all of you for hopefully everybody can stay in Fellowship praise God and uh just been all my heart you know lately to do that you know to kind of cancel second service so we don't have to rush in between Services we can just relax and enjoy the fellowship how enjoy fellowshipping with your brothers and sisters in Christ Christ amen such a blessing praise God 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 1 I'd like to um preach on gifts of the Spirit this morning Sister Amy had asked me a while back probably probably a year ago to preach on if I felt led to preach on the gifts and I had uh but then I kind of got dealing with you know the church ages and the Holy Ghost and and then I thought and then when she told me that was her last Sunday coming I was already working with gifts of the Spirit so I thought well well this would be the best time to preach it by God's grace so hope it's a blessing to everybody just kind of want to review these in a little bit uh in 2012 I preached 36 sermons on the gifts of the Spirit so I'm just trying to pull the highlights out of there uh it's just a huge topic uh because uh they're God's gifts to his people and everywhere you see God's people God gives gifts to his people you know he wants his children to be blessed and so forth so it's just a tremendous subject but we try to uh just narrow it down to look at each and every gift a little a little bit today and uh trust us to be blessed how many interested in the gifts of the Spirit in your life praise God certainly am and I I think you know as I was looking at this again I'm just reminded I think they operate more than what we think and uh I think we just need to refresh it and remember uh what they are and then I think you see how much they operate by God's grace they actually operate quite a bit amongst us here when the Lord moves so 1 Corinthians chapter 12 verse one and uh let me get there sorry I didn't get there by God's grace verse one now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant so Paul doesn't want us to not know about them we need to know about them you know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols even as ye were LED see the spirit of Satan will lead you to dumb Idols make you dumb right right make you make you uh have no praise for God verse three wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse and that no man can say that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost and now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are diversities of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation or the appearing that's what the word means there the appearing but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all to benefit Every Man's given this manifestation for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh the one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severly as he will so God knows which gift you need God knows which gift is in your life and he wants you to operate just the gifts that he placed in your life praise God let's just bow our heads for word of prayer if you have a need on your heart you like to go to Higher Ground or anything this morning or like to understand your gift just raise your hand I'm sure God will hear it or you know bow your heart and I know God will hear your prayer because loves you Heavenly Father the Bible said we love you because you first loved us thank you for loving me while I was yet a sinner you died the righteous for the unrighteous and Lord to keep the church clean and to lead the church you sent down gifts so it would not be man's ability or women's ability to lead and guide the church and church keep the church clean but it would be the ability of your spirit Lord God and alls we would have to do is just learn to yield walk in obedience Lord God and then these gifts these special gifts Lord uh these uh these Graces that you've given to us Lord hallelujah will be able to operate through our lives Lord we're grateful for everyone Lord we never want to put gifts above the giver so Lord that's why we preach more on the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Lord once we've got that then Lord we want to turn our attention to serving you and this is where this Channel comes in Lord how we can let the Waters of life flow through us how we can let Christ flow out through our lips Lord or through through our prayers Lord God and and so father just speak to us you saw the hands Lord God I don't know what's in their hearts I don't know their questions but father I just pray you'd speak to them this morning they're your people lord they're your children Lord and I pray just anoint me anoint them in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen God bless you being seated there praise the Lord so let's look at this I I'll set my timer for about an hour but I may go over just a little bit you know the Lord willing if we uh since we got time today by God's grace so Mala you can switch it over here buddy thank you sir I just have a lot of quotes to show you like I said I really had to condense it you know and uh I think that's a good thing you know praise the Lord and I think you'll be blessed by the gifts you know some of these I'd forgotten about so when I went back over I thought oh my that's really helpful praise God I wish I would not have forgot that but uh all things you know God and so see sister I was going to preach it back in November I forgot to change the date on there so you can see I've a meaning to do that so actually worked out good by God's grace I I need to go back and see what I preached on that day it we need to see what the Lord you know in in uh inserted there instead of uh that because that was the day I I was going to preach it I think you were out of town or something I think you were traveling that day I think that's why I changed the the topic there but uh as you said I I really believe you know you're interested in serving the lord better and uh and we know we have to answer for our gifts you know if preachers have to answer for their gifts then everybody's got to answer for their gifts we kind of went over that last Sunday night whatever talents you've been given now that was just a money but uh it's an illustration whatever you've been blessed by whatever God has graced you with you must be faithful with it and so God help us to be faithful and I think now I realized too this ties in of course with last Sunday night's communion message so I think that's a real blessing and uh I hope you'll be blessed here today by the grace of the Lord now in uh 1 Corinthians 14 I'm going to skip ahead uh a few quotes here uh by God's grace yeah here we go um the Bible says where to follow charity then desire the gifts this has always been my desire this has always been my understanding I'm sure yours too uh we never want to put too much emphasis on the gifts but if you have charity already if you have the gift giv already then you desire to see his gifts uh we never of course we never put gifts above the giver but the Bible literally says this uh you should and and that's what remember the three-fold uh the three-fold determination that you're on fire one of them is the Cry of the reaching out in the spirit so that's that's the the cry Lord manifest your gifts let your hand be seen amongst us amen like I said it don't matter if it's in the church or outside the church we just want to see his hand and then we want you to come tell us about it when it happens give us a testimony because we it just strengthens the people's Faith Amen to see God moving in our midst praise the Lord and I just had a I felt like a gift of wisdom flow out through me the other night and I'll share that in a little bit when we get to wisdom because the brother was this brother never texts me about his personal battles and questions he sends me this personal battle another brother had questioned him and kind of rebuked him on something and he said what do you thinking so I just started I just had this bird I just could had to stop washing dishes you know and send these texts and after all it he said my what a gift of wisdom that was I never even had these thoughts and I wasn't even trying to say hey look at my gift I was just trying to help somebody who needed help and uh so I just thought my I didn't ask for that it just it flows out and that's what the holy spirit is brother Bram said even when you speak in tongues you don't even know you're going to do it sometimes it just flows out so we just want to be vessels that the Holy Spirit can flow out of I want God to grab my vessel brother Adam and then fill me he's f me now pour me out and use me praise the Lord let me be a help to somebody praise the Lord because the Bible says this follow after charity and so you have to do both I'm always following Divine love I want to love my sisters I want to love my brothers I want to hate sin I wanna I want to love the church I want to love my family but at the same time I desire to see God's Graces his gifts and then he says of all things you should desire prophecy because prophecy has like a five-fold blessing you know it's Comfort we'll get to that a little bit it's Comfort it's edification it's judgment it's correction so see file the Holy Ghost then desire him to move through the gifts how many how many how many feel that way you're following the Holy Spirit and you like to see gifts manifested in the midst prayer expresses our desires to God and so we should pray more so pray more that's why we should pray for the gifts pray for God's hand to move uh pray for the Holy Spirit to move amongst us then this is the order first you get born again and then you desire spiritual gifts now different churches you know ask brother brandom I don't have the quotes here but they asked brother BR should we're filled with the Holy Ghost now should we seek gifts he said don't you do it he said let God add those gifts to the church but I have other quotes where brother BR told the people to pray for gifts so it kind of depends on the time and season it depends the group you're talking to but here you can you see there should be a desire for it and in a couple weeks ago we looked at remember Acts chapter 4 and after they got persecuted they went back to the room and they prayed for for God to send more signs Miracles and wonders so see there's a time and season to pray for that and desire that uh and so we must understand that we must balance all these quotes out and and all the scriptures out and we must let the Holy Spirit lead us amen now here's where brother Braham literally says we should covet the gifts literally brother Braham says this we should covet the gifts amongst us now covet is usually a word for uh for a sin right Thou shalt not cover covet thy neighbor's wife right Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's oxen or sheep or something like that covet is once something that somebody else has for yourself but the Bible says we should covet the spiritual moving through the gifts wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues how many can say Amen to that so we should come to church and say Lord tell me the future tell me tell me your will tell me what's going to happen show me things to come praise God because that is the spirit of Jesus Christ the spirit of prophecy now thank God for brother brandham God through brother brandham has shed us many things to come so we should still desire more but literally we know all about the Catholic Church The Rapture you know the persecution The Squeeze we have all these things that God has told us with in the name of the Lord the holy spirit said this we know so much to come we should be grateful for that amen and we are but here's where brother ad says at 1958 now another thing that we believe the manifestation of the spirit is given to every and a prophit with all see it's given to all of us now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church which we covet and desire that the people who are gifted by the Spirit come and worship with us hallelujah don't you like that Lord I desire that people that have the gift of wisdom or the gift of Prophecy come to our church praise the Lord I desire that because brother Bram desired that amen he desired God's gifts to be in the church how many like that quote hope that's a blessing to you brother even tells us this in the same the same sermon this is a yeah I think I told you about this this is a one hour Church order sermon if you just have one hour it's quite a great uh sermon to listen to gifts are the order of the day that's what brother BR tells us now we believe that the spiritual gifts among Believers is the order of the day we cannot believe that a man can preach under inspiration and then be an inspired teacher and then deny the gift of healing what about message preachers that deny the gifts oh we don't need tongues anymore we don't need healing look at that they are not inspired Hallelujah but if you say we need it and you welcome it and you covet it desire it you must be inspired amen of the holy spirit because that's the order of today Glory cannot believe a man's inspired of the Holy Spirit to say something like that because that's the very day we're living in because brother baham tells us the gifts were to remain in the church until he came praise God and we're told this in the church age book chapter 7 Paul the first messenger and he said in Galatians 1 18 that if any Angel any messenger any vicer no matter who he was if he preached any other gospel than what Paul preached let him be a cursed Paul knew that after he was gone Grievous wolves would come in he knew that Satan himself could appear as an angel of Light so how much more his ministers so he warns that this gospel would always be the same now Paul had baptized in jesus' name and re-baptized where people had not been so immersed he set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the Spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came thus the next Messengers all the remaining six which would include brother Brandon right would by the same Holy Ghost burn with the same fire and give the same light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the signs would follow them but here's where we're getting down to you now and me Hallelujah this is 1954 now wouldn't you all like to have a real Bible Church how many could say Amen to that am amen I like have a real Bible Church I believe we have one a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order everything making manifest just exactly the way it should be oh that's what my heart burns for amen wouldn't that be wonderful now you're gonna have to sacrifice not money you're gonna have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas you're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer you're going to have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility to maybe to like I said to to speak in front of a group and say thus sayi the Lord here's a word of knowledge for so and so or thus sayi the Lord here's the future or speak in a tongue or or pray you know and prophesy or something along these lines it takes humility to do those things our pride does not like to be the have all the attention on us right right and that I guess that can be good humility and but I'm saying like uh I guess our fears maybe that'd be a better word our fears sometimes we don't like to have the attention on us and I never like that never get used to that I never thought i' telling people I never thought I'd ever be a preacher but God called me to do such things but it t it takes a a deliverance from stubbornness to be able to manifest the gift of God in your life you can't be so stubborn and say no no no no you've got to humble yourself and say yes Lord Lord if you want me to do it yes Lord forgive me of my stubborn spirit I keep saying no I won't sacrifice my time I won't sacrifice my prayer remember it's not a sacrifice of money it's a sacrifice of time and prayer and that's where I think we all could use God's help don't you think the whole Christian move is sacrificial oh Hallelujah he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me daily that's why a few services with the Holy Ghost series I was working with coming to church early again if you really have a burden for people you got to sacrifice your time amen now you can pray during the week too that's wonderful too but I'm just saying like if you have no other time before service you're already on your way here it'd be a good thing to do pray sacrifice some time sacrifice some prayer is that right how often do you have to sacrifice every day he died daily every day he died so if you know there's a gift of God in your life how often should you die and ask God to help you every day I try to do that Lord help me to bring the right message help me to preach the truth help me to preach just the Bible praise the Lord but this is in the same quotation that he said now I'll go back a little bit yeah this the same quotation about everybody here he's not just talking to preachers he's talking to everybody and this is of course in Jeffersonville sacrifice some time in prayer so help me Lord not to be stubborn praise God help me to be humble help me to be a Christian who lives a life of sacrifice that's what it takes oh I misspelled a word here how to know you're or you're you how to know you're you gift you can do the gift in your life pardon me I didn't mean to misspell that I don't know what happened there okay so let's look at this this is what brother man tells us how do you know your gift and he said the way you know it is that you can do it in 1961 how does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ that's a good one very good that'd be the kind of question amongst many of us here tonight can I see a raising of hands how many have that question how would I know my rightful position in the body of Christ well God bless those hands praise the Lord and little Esther's hand went up God bless you Esther bless your heart how do you rightfully know now I'm presuming that this brother wants to know what position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play what a question what part am I of Christ what do I play how am I going to manifest Jesus Christ to the church or to my family now for instance I'd say like this brother to give you the best answer I know your position is in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit and then if you want to know whether it's the Holy Spirit or not find out whether He blesses what you're doing or not and if he blesses it then that's from him also don't forget to there's another quote too I didn't have here but he said go back and make sure it's the word of God uh for you to do it so make sure it's God's will you meet the qualifications of God's will like someone said to me lot long ago brother BR the Lord called me to preach I said well then preach right don't you like that straightforward well you got to give okay then operate it and so I really think so it's Satan if he can just get somebody as to act like that and then deceive them that's just what he wants to do then the whole world points their finger right there look at this preacher he tried to preach and he's all mixed up and he can't be used of God nobody's blessed God's not blessing it he brought shame upon the church or something like that that's just what Satan wants to do but if somebody's LED of the Holy Spirit they wait on God's timing praise God and when they're used of God then the world just says a nonsense but the church rejoices because they recognize God gave us a gift amen and we're at all benefit from that gift gift Hallelujah somebody thinks they have a gift of speaking in tongues interpretation someone has a gift of Divine Healing some of these things like sometimes they're mistaken in those things see and sometimes they think they haven't got it when they have so it's very tricky it's very tricky remember Sister Bruce had the Holy Ghost and she was all confused she didn't have it because she never spoke in tongues so brother brandom saw in the vision she had the Holy Ghost so he tell he prays that God let her speak in tongues so she can have peace in her heart but brother B said I wouldn't tell that to everybody because they'd start seeking the gift rather than the giver they they would have a gift but not have the same type of life that she lived exactly right so it's very tricky so how do you know you wait upon God and you let him his word be be taught to you praise God Amen and like I was telling brother Austin the other day we were talking about Gideon was a man who had to have signs that's how I've usually operated when because God don't speak to me by dreams or voices I don't really often get those so what I do is I I I get real sincere maybe I fast and pray I ask God for a sign and then if God gives me that sign I know it's the will of the Lord and so that that's that's one way you might have to do that you might have to say God Give Me A Sign give me for example you might say give me three signs today or give me three signs by the end of the week but be careful with that because Satan get in can get into that as well praise God make sure your make sure your motive and objective is right to begin with praise God you have to get there uh first make sure your heart is right so it can be very tricky because see Satan's trying to really uh uh mess the church up if he can mess somebody's life up for years and years and years uh he he would get pleasure in that and maybe people might might not be blessed well like they could be and like we went over last Sunday night people will lose their reward because they didn't fulfill the ministry God called them to have the Bible said they themselves would be saved but their reward would be all consumed with fire amen that's exactly right so always do this Brethren whenever you feel that you're supposed to do a thing first find out okay that's what I was saying find out if it's scriptural for you to do it if it's in the scriptures not just wrote in one place but I mean completely scriptural Through the Bible for you to do it your position say if you'd be evangelist Pastor teacher Prophet whatever that God might have called you to be you see or if you have the gift of tongues gift of interpretation gift of any kind of the nine spiritual gifts in the church and the four spiritual offices in the church any position first see if it's God calling find out if it's man calling your flesh calling a denomination calling find out who's calling amen is it your Mom calling your dad your grandma your grandpa who's calling your aunt or Uncle make sure it's God calling amen hallelujah if it's God calling you'll meet the conditions of the word your life will meet the conditions and it'll line up with God's holy word amen then usually the way I watch it for myself this is me I watch the nature of a person and see what the kind of a gift that they're professing see God will work with his creature the way he's made see he'll make a creature if you see him real flighty now flighty means you go from one thing to the next well go to this and then go to that go to that if you see him real flighty and going on and he says oh the Lord called me to be such and such to be a pastor now a pastor can't be a flighty person a pastor solid sound so flighty means you're not solid right God called me to be a teacher well then watch how he interprets that word see he gets it all mixed up and everything then you can tell see but then the thing to do your position is usually known whether you can do it or not and when God called me to be an evangelist I want to be a pastor my calling was an evangelist laying right here at this Cornerstone if you could burst in there tonight you'll see a fly leaf off my Bible where he told me to be an evangelist see and I wasn't a successful Pastor although the people cried when he left he said the whole church was crying in 1947 when he left for the field they loved him now this I don't know this might be his opinion I'm not sure I have to look at more quotes I I would personally believe think he'd be a successful pastor but I don't know I wasn't a successful Pastor never would be it says never because I haven't got the patience and what it takes to be a Pastor recently like I told you one of my friends left being a pastor went to evangelist because he said he didn't have the patience for it and he lasted eight years as a pastor and so that's part of it if you if you can do something then you know God's called you to do it if you can't do it then God probably hasn't called you to do that there's also a thing though also there's also how God can change a Ministry because St Paul for a while of course he was always a prophet but then the Bible said he pastored the church in EES Ephesus and then he Timothy was the pastor and then Paul he was Pastor for a while then Paul wrote second Timothy and said now do the work an evangelist so Ministries can change so that might be the case with my friend I'm not sure for certain but his own testimony said I couldn't handle it was too much pressure and things like that and uh when he told me I could understand why it was a lot of pressure it was some some real challenges he had to deal with in the church there things that I hope I never have to deal with by God's grace but but God knows what we have need amen so therefore if I tried to Pastor I would just be as far out as a pastor is trying to be an evangelist see what I mean you can see the way the Lord calls you by what position is in the body is there a question he says all right so I hope there's no questions amen now but if you have some you can always see me afterwards by God's grace uh now let's um I'm gonna look at my notes Here I think I may just skip ahead to the actual um nine gifts I want to kind of maybe spend more time on that yeah let me skip a few I'm going to skip this one because I went over this one your pre-service ministry makes it easier on the pastor to get into his gifts so this is the importance of why you need to come to church early and pray or pray up on Saturday night or pray up on Sunday morning before you come to church uh because the pastor's gift is dependent upon everybody else's if they're faithful to God if they're pulling brother mam said it's so important well I'll just read it I think it's just one yeah just one quote the Saints and their gifts shall have their place first to worship and come together which brings as I've said before the Spear of the Lord in the building for the pastor see if you're not praying it kind of hurts me does anybody here want to hurt me I hope not because I don't want to hurt you he says and it makes it much easier for the Holy Spirit to work through him then when a great spiritual meeting has just preceded now precede means to come before the church should have a spiritual meeting before the pastor comes to preach of course that's song service but also prayer beforehand and then the Holy Spirit gets into the word and teaches the word has just been manifested by the gifts all right now of course he's talking about praying before service the gifts man if the gifts manifest before service now I've never seen that myself I've seen gifts manifest at the end of service or after service but I've never seen gifts manifest before service at least that I can remember I could have forg um so this is what I'm saying this is something that the church needs to have a a burden to know their gift the church needs to have a a burden to help us all operate in the Holy Spirit we got to have a burden and it's not going to take more money it's going to take more sacrifice of your time in prayer let's say time in prayer ready time in prayer that's what that's how you get closer to God that's how your gift manifest time and prayer I don't have time but I could take you to Daniel where they came to Daniel and they said uh was it Daniel yeah it was Daniel all all of Nebuchadnezzar's uh wise men couldn't tell his dream and the King said I'm gonna kill everybody and Daniel said just a minute he said give me some time and I'll tell you thus sayi the Lord see he didn't have th sayith the Lord he knew if I'm going to get an interpretation of a dream I've got to have time I've got to consecrate I've got to get in the channel of the Holy Ghost amen give me time I don't have it right now like that I just can't spew it out but if you give me time and I can go lay before the Lord and make my request made known to God God will move through the gift God will move through the channel and you'll get the thus say the Lord that you need now that's real Bible teaching praise the Lord time and prayer help the gifts operate now that's just in the local church right here when we're here but we're grateful we want to operate all the time at your home in your business don't you want to see Sinners get saved at your home or your business or your friend's house on the job at the school don't you want to see Sinners weep their way to to Calvary amen glory but it takes time takes sacrifice got to be willing to do that and but as preachers we must teach on gifts in order to uh lose our ignorance toward gifts and this is what brother B said we're getting to the church ages now we're in the second Church age I'll start that on Wednesday Lord willing uh with irus and brother bam uh just uh Raves about the ministry of irus the Holy Spirit he Tau all the gifts of the Spirit and he said they were never without some powerful manifestation of the spirit because he taught on the gifts so that people knew what the gifts were he said now concerning spiritual gifts breth I would not have you ignorant so he don't want us to be ignorant he doesn't God doesn't want us to not know or understand the gifts and there's a quote I have from 1965 I wish I could pull it up I may in just a moment here maybe I'll try to pull that up where brother B he's out preaching out west I think or something like that and uh let me see if I can pull it up and a report comes in right before he preaches and said oh all the elders at my church uh were at a uh at a funeral home where somebody had died or maybe at the mortuary I'm not sure where they were at somebody just died I don't know if it at the hospital or somewhere like that some funeral home and they were going to embal a body and brother ramam said the Elders of the church said wait before you do that can we just pray one more time and he said they prayed and within a matter of minutes the dead person came back life and everybody claps and brother brother said that they believe that because they're taught that that all things are possible in their home church I'm just paraphrasing that's what he said because they're taught to believe those Miracles then they act upon it amen and then God vindicates their faith approves their faith and then does miracles in their midst hallelujah amen now just give me a moment here here you can start on this quote while I'm looking for the other one all right you can start reading that is that okay uh that'll be a bless blessing there I thought I might be able to pull it up real quick all right maybe I can't find it thought it was about deacons and so forth but all right that's why I think irius because you see had the the same faith that Paul and the disciples handed down that's why I believe that he was the angel of the Church of samna because he had the same scriptural teachings and the same scriptural teachings oh I love it upon the basis of God's word will produce the same thing every time if you just simply take God's formula and carry it out to the letter no matter what the churches say just follow it just the way it said it'll produce the same thing that's what irius did hallelujah amen so hope that was a blessing there let me just check one more time maybe I can get the key wordss here if it be God's grace to us today to be encouraged by that quote there it is choosing of a bride okay here it is paragraph 57 phone call just came in a while ago this morning a member of my church which is really a Baptist woman out Louisville she died early this morning in my church at home a real group of consecrated men look consecrated they must have been making sacrifices if they're consecrated unto God their time in prayer must have been assembled themselves together and went down together before the Undertaker and balmed her so there's a licensed State Undertaker there and they say hold on can we pray before for before you do your work stood over her and prayed until life come back in her and she is living tonight the Elders of my church why they had been taught to believe that all things are possible come to God sincerely amen glory we must believe that all things are possible we must pray and ask God to give us the grace to give us the faith show us what we're called to do and continually do it but when you're taught these things then you're more likely to act upon them how many you believe that just like if it teach a child to do wrong they're going to do wrong if you let them watch any filth they'll act all filthy but if you teach them to do right train them to do right they'll Act Right amen it's exactly right okay let's get to the nine gifts of the Spirit here I want to spend the bulk of my time on this and I got about 30 minutes left half my time okay praise the Lord everybody enjoying this by God's grace okay am I hurting anybody's feelings I hope not I hope I'm uh well if I'm doing that I hope it's to Humble everybody and to get the stubbornness out glory and help me to humble myself amen all of us need humbleness amen all of us need more of a sacrifice unto God so here's the nine gifts and they are in order from importance from the most important all the way down to the least or the most powerful down to the least powerful how many you understand that brother B said that brother calls it the routine of the Bible he said wisdom he said notice the routine of the Bible wisdom is the greatest gift because you need wisdom to manage all the others so wisdom is a manager all right let me take off my jacket I'm trying to get warm here now one of my desires church and I hope I hope everybody can understand this I'm trying to take I'm trying to do this I'm trying to take the Greek definition plus the Bible scriptures plus brother ad's quotes and apply this to the common man that's you and I that's myself because we can all easily recognize tongues interpretation prophecy we can just recognize that automatically I think don't you think we can just recognize that right away right away right away but some of these other ones uh Miracles we can recognize right away too uh Divine Healing too but I guess three of those or four of those might be a little unfamiliar to us and we don't want to be ignorant how many how many don't want to be ignorant of those gifts and I think if we can just shine a little more light on these and uh by God's grace be able to show you what they look like in the scripture I think it'll help you by the grace of the Lord and I want you to be helped because the last thing I want is people to leave out here and condemned or I don't have a gift I I don't know my gift I don't want you to be condemned I don't want you to be discouraged I want you to be encouraged if you have a question just go like this say well Lord praise the Lord I don't know my gift but if I pray and I sacrifice you'll show me my gift in life amen hallelujah don't you love Jesus amen my he's just oh he's everything to me praise God so number one the word of wisdom now see I'm going to go over this format to help you understand it and because it helped me I look at at the Greek definition now I want to say this too Greek definitions are not thus sayith the Lord Greek Lexicon is not thus sayith the Lord because I can click on a scripture and they'll say oh this word you know is related to the Trinity and God's three persons I'm like oh come on but what happened was that God allowed some man at some point to find the actual definitions of these English words uh and actually go back and find the Greek or Aramaic or Hebrew word and actually find the definitions of those words and they put their understanding uh to those words and in most case I would say this most cases they're right uh because it was led of God and you can say how can you say that brother Jesse because when brother brandham preached the Masterpiece and when brother Bram preached others uh quotes about uh Jesus and how he was in the image of God the amorph what scripture what sermon was that in the morphe was it the Masterpiece the amorph remember the amorph how many raise raise your hand if you remember that Mor I need to look that up sister Donna thank you brother Brandon preaches that and he uses a Greek definition and then he goes and and he preaches it elsewhere and later on tape I have to look it up but later on tape I could find you the quotes later he goes somewhere else and he preaches in Morp again how the word form meant a Morp it meant God changing his mask and he said a Greek Theologian or Theologian comes up and says brother Brandon you were LED of the Holy Spirit you don't even know Greek and Hebrew but that's exactly the definition that it is so even brother Braham God came to vindicate brother Braham you use the right definition of that Greek word amen so see there's a there's a an inspiration behind the Greek but again because it's written by man you got to sift through it by the Holy Spirit like I had somebody last well a few weeks ago say brother brandom or say brother Jesse if brother brandom if you if you've got to sift through brother bram's quotes how could he be a prophet how can you even know if it was thus sayth the Lord because she was telling me every word brother Bram said was thus sayith the Lord she said if every word he said wasn't thus sayith the Lord how do you know what's right I said that's simple brother B said told us to take it back to the word take it back to the word it's got to have two or three Witnesses if it don't if it's got to thus say the Lord behind it you know it's right and the church said so see that's the deception of the Antichrist Spirit Well I don't know how to rightly you're not you might not be called to rightly divide the word but there is somebody who's called to do that Amen brother Ram interpreted the word just like Paul did then told Timothy you rightly divide it amen the prophet interprets it and then the preachers rightly divide amen why because it's the same Spirit on brother brandom now is on the fivefold ministry today to get a bride ready for Christ amen hallelujah amen it's not a second or different spirit it's the same holy spirit amen it's exactly right and they say how can you know it's th say the Lord you take it back to the word you're led by The Same Spirit now I didn't mean to get all emotional on that I just guess I felt kind of burdened about that but see it's an antichrist spirit that makes every word he says thus say the Lord Brother brandom said that brother brandom said he said the he said you want to know one of the awfulest things I think brother Kevin and Marie were here when I read that on that Wednesday night service they came he said you want to know one of the most a awfulest things there is is to say that I'm infallible brother R said he said that's a bunch of Tommy rat praise God so what Spirit would that come from what's the Tommy rot Spirit that's not the Holy Spirit that's the Unholy Spirit that's the Antichrist so I guess that Spirit just Rises up at me and just uh hates that Antichrist Spirit but that's what Jesus said you hate the same Deeds of nicadan that I hate Jesus and I both love the same things and we hate the same things amen that's the real Church of God now let me get to this if I can Mercy the word of wisdom the Greek CS wisdom skill in the management of your Affairs so how you manage your life your decisions see if you see somebody who's unskillful they keep falling into sin they keep hurting people they keep doing evil they don't have wisdom but when you see someone who walks in the wisdom of the Holy Spirit and takes God's ways rather than man's ways that's wisdom of the holy spirit it's discretion in imparting truth well this is the actual truth here I know there's there's all these things out here but actually this is truth now the Bible said wisdom is declared through works or actions Jesus said uh wisdom is Justified over children that's what it means Justified means declare wisdom is Justified or declared through its actions so that will always show you if you're walking in wisdom if you do a sinful action that wasn't the W wisdom of God if you get ahead of God like David did with the cart that's not the wisdom of God but when you wait on God and the timing of God and the channel of God that's wisdom wisdom tells you what to do with Bible knowledge because the Bible said in Proverbs 9:1 wisdom hath builded her house wisdom builds the house the materials are not know we get to that the materials that you have to build with are knowledge but it's wisdom that builds it wisdom puts this here that material there and forms a beautiful uh perfectly leveled perfectly prepared house amen wisdom builds the house and let me say like this wisdom builds this church Hallelujah wisdom should build bride of Christ Fellowship or the Lord Jesus Christ Tabernacle or Living Waters Tabernacle wisdom must build the house we must direct uh instruct and teach truth and teach the the the people of God to manage theirs Affairs by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and a wise man or wise virgin builds their house upon a rock the word Christ Jesus brother manam said wisdom is the best gift of the group so let's read that I restore 1957 now if you notice the routine of the gifts the first gift is a gift of wisdom thank you brother B says the first is I'm sorry the first is the GI GI to wisdom that is the best gift of the group and if we don't have wisdom we won't know how to use knowledge is the second gift and if we can't use the second gift without wisdom how are we going to use the last gift interpretation or next to last speaking in tongues our Zeals eat up our wisdom or our Zeal for denominations and our enthusiasm has eat up the wisdom off the vine brotherly love praise God now let me get to this text message that was sent to me on Friday night I was really tired I got home from work well I had a quite a week here by God's grace but we're making it by the grace of the Lord but I just I want to show you I want to encourage you with this because this is for the Common Man the common the common Christian how many feel like you're just a common average Christian right you're not maybe you're not like a prophet you're not like a a pastor of a mega church or you know like evangelist who's a worldwide evangelist how many feel just like a common Christian that's how I feel I'm just a common everyday Christian maybe a one Talent preacher right now the question was uh for this brother another brother kind of uh approached him and said uh he shouldn't do certain certain sports with his children and uh and the brother was really hurt and came to me and said you know what do you think about this what do you think about this I just kind of waited on the Lord I kept washing dishes for a while and just thinking about it like man because if if if I'm wrong then I I don't want to be wrong because I do I do Taekwondo with my son Malachi and I know a lot of people that their sons do baseball or basketball or football right and you got to also put in there message volleyball games because that's Sports too right so this is a a pretty in-depth question and so I just waited and waited and I just kind of felt like a uh kind like a confidence I don't know I just kind of felt like I like a courage I just had to answer this you know I believe it was the Holy Spirit and so this the quote started coming to me brother Bram said God gave me a a sport of hunting and fishing and then brother brandham said Charlie Cox said brother brandham we love hunting so much will we squirrel hunt in the Millennium and brother R said no because nothing will die in the Millennium and he said but we love squirrel hunting so much and brother man said can you imagine a pig being changed into a man and then wanting to go back and doing the things that a pig did he said that's how we'll feel we'll have brand new bodies we won't want to go back to hunting squirrels because that's what pigs do you understand the illustration you understand that and then I have a a shared of quote where uh brother Ram said oh he said how I love to hunt and fish but one minute in this presence he said it's better than all that hunting and fishing one minute and this is at the end of a service where they're worshiping and praising God so brother baham said God gave him a sport now I don't know about you but when you shoot an animal you kill it right you actually take its life away from it and it's called a sport and you kill something but this is the wisdom of God that came to me you can do a sport and not have the spirit of the sport what do I mean by that we've all seen it you've seen volleyball games you've seen people trying to play volleyball and they're not in the spirit of it they won't jump they won't dive all over the floor to try to get the next bump over the over the net they won't even jump to spike it you've all seen baseball players that don't want to swing to batter or you've seen basketball players that don't really want to be there why because they're not in the spirit of it and yet now I can show you quotes brother man said there's so many white you know in this case he was using white men white men that go out there and hunt elephant and he said they've got the spirit of murder on them because they just kill for fun how many remember some of those quotes I can show them to them if you want nobody remembers those okay well a couple all right well I can show them to you if you want them so what am I saying brother Brandon can go hunting and not get in the spirit of murder while other men can go out there go hunting and get in the spirit of murder praise God it's a sport hunting is a sport he can now listen he can literally kill an animal take its life and he's not in the spirit of murder and the church said amen that's why I can go out with my son I can take a football that I used to worship used to not anymore I can throw him a ball or he and I can go shoot hoops and I don't get in the spirit like oh I'm going to really let me run him over I'll stiff arm him and I'll show him really how to do it that'd be foolish why because I'm not in the spirit of it yes I agree the spirit of basketball that the spirit of football that wants to idolize people is from hell I can say Amen to that but if you're just playing the sport and you're not in the spirit of it and you're just doing it for exercise or passing time is that a sin because if so then brother Ram was sinning when he was hunting because he's doing a sport now we know he did that what to get time with God he said but also to rest his mind so I shared these things and there was other other quotes too I Shar with him um and brother BR would say he' go to a baseball game he said somebody hit a grand slam he said somebody gets so excited they would pull up their hat and pull it down on their head and their their their their hat would rip and their hat would go around their neck and he looked at another person and he said brother BR aren't you excited he said no he said because I'm not in the spirit of baseball he said because you're not in the spirit of it so see everything carries a spirit and I just sent these you know right away as quick as I could find them I was on my phone there going fast as I could sending these quotes toh this brother this the this brother in the Lord who we love and I said it's the same thing for me I go to uh go work out Taekwondo it's just three hours a week I go there for one purpose to exercise and I said I can punch people understand this now I can punch them not in their face I can punch them on their pad and I don't get in the spirit of it and God is my honest witness he's my witness and I don't even I just do it to do it I can kick people I can do a roundhouse or front kick I can break boards like we do sometimes Malai we break boards I'm not trying to be a murderer I'm not trying to kill people and yet I'm not even killing people but if you hunt you do kill animals amen and I can do just like I can shoot a basketball and not have to be Michael Jordan I used to want to do that I used to want to be all these guys and it just to kill me if I couldn't and then I finally got to dunk and I oh I'm close now then I got hurt you know how that goes see you can do something and not get in the spirit of it because if you condemn Taekwondo or if you condemn football you got to condemn all of them because they're all sports it's all competition and the brother wrote me back and this is what he said he said great brother looks like the Lord has really given you some great wisdom so I just thought I'd stop on that one see because wisdom manages your Affairs and if people come to me condemn me that's fine I know what brother Bram said I know what the word said now his concern was am I causing somebody somebody to fall so I said go ask him uh say we if my family is doing these Sports is it causing you to stumble because stumble means to get weak and to perish to leave Christ is this is what I'm doing really causing you to get weak and sin and go back in the world and the brother was honest and S back and text and said no I really wasn't talking about sports I was just concerned because you're not spending enough time with your children which didn't make any sense to anybody and so see when you bring the truth and you bring the word and then you start uh asking questions to the person that's accusing your consern you have the spirit of Truth so that's one that's just one testimony I want to give because this just happened the other night this just happened on Friday night wisdom is declared through its actions praise the Lord and Malachi is my witness before every uh what do we do before every practice and every test what do we do we join hands and pray in the name of Jesus Christ and say if anybody says and this is happen we pray if if anybody sees we're good at anything may we give God the glory one time one time we prayed that and somebody comes up to Malachi says afterwards they said Malachi my you kicking so good and Malachi said God just gave me that gift so he doesn't get the glory he doesn't get glorified God gets the glory see there's a balance for everything remember I prayed two or three years saying what do I put my son in and now Malachi doesn't almost every time he talks about God almost every practice doesn't he our Master almost every time he's talking about faith or God or something like that so see it's wisdom that that's what I'm that's what that's what I believe that's just my testimony so I just want to share that by God's grace now number two word of knowledge now this might be one of the most um gifts that we're most ignorant of and I would say for me too when brother bandam uses words of knowledge he often relates it to a prophet because knowledge is understanding so a gift of knowledge would help you understand something but it's by the word it's by the word God's going to give you an understanding of something but you got to have word behind it okay so that's what it means understanding or knowledge means a general intelligence or understanding the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belong to the more advanced especially of things un lawful and unlawful for Christians word of knowledge and I think more people have gifts of wisdom and knowledge than what they realize I really do the Bible calls knowledge is a key the Bible said knowledge is a key I keep twisting this up brother Loris was trying to help me which way do I twist that brother I'm trying to get untangled here a key or understanding that allows one to enter into the will of God you can look up all those scriptures I can email this if you want that's what a gift of uh under uh gift of knowledge does it gives you an understanding to do the will of God it gives you the understanding to enter into a promise of God you couldn't enter into before that's the gift of knowledge in other words you know the scripture now you know the exact scripture you need to enter into this relationship or enter into this thing this this desire and it Al also the Bible said gives you knowledge to escape sin in second Peter 2:20 so the gift of knowledge will operate also to keep you out of sin it'll give you a Biblical understanding for example in my life it was with quitting tobacco when I first came in the message I always wondered how can I quit this I told you know Chris and I just got engaged in 200000 must have been 2002 and I said honey I said I love you so happy to marry you but I said I don't know if I'll ever be able to quit chewing tobacco before I started preaching before anything and then I came across 1 Corinthians 6 6:12 which is this all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful to me but I will not be brought under the power of any when I heard that scripture and read that it was like bright lights went off in my heart you know it's lawful to have chewin tobacco now it's GNA kill you with cancer like it killed Tony Gwyn the Hall of Fame baseball player it killed him who cares now if he has 3,000 hits he's dead because tobacco killed him cancer but when I read I these things are lawful these things uh uh right here but I will not be brought under the power of chewing tobacco so I started looking at a can of chewing tobacco as a demon I thought how can this little 4 inch uh cylinder or whatever it was how can this 4 inch cylinder this yeah cylinder how can this have power for me and then I started having a lot of faith rise up in me amen because the scripture says I I don't have to be brought under that power the power of Satan was working through that and working in me but then as I saw this scripture I realized I greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and I can cast down that power I've got a power greater than that demon amen and that's what's what did it the word of knowledge I don't know if I heard that preach or if it's just in my own study but this gave me understanding to enter into full Deliverance praise God now brother Bram said this a gift of knowledge now here's where he's been applying it to a prophet he said a gift of know is like an attorney who studies the books which is the Bible to present your case before the judge soam lyans the gift of knowledge someone who has a lot of knowledge we got any book smart people in here I imagine Brother Scott would be real good on this one he studies all those books and uh sister Bo did biology and I'm sure some of the brothers did a lot of studying but if your book smart that that's kind of like it may be an indication that they might have a gift of knowledge because the gift of knowledge goes back to the book Hallelujah the gift of knowledge goes back like an attorney to God's book studies the book and then presents knowledge or understanding of the word and presents the case Hallelujah here's where bam says it 1957 a prophet is also a gift of knowledge a knowledge is like an attorney so now he just describes knowledge knowledge is like an attorney who studies the books how many like to study books anybody in here like to okay it might be a channel but you got to be consecrated to it right you got to have prayer like you said you got to sacrifice time got to sacrifice prayer I wna I want to be led more of God I've got to sacrifice time in prayer and give myself to these things that the people may benefit don't you want to be a benefit to everybody here at the church your gifts were given to you to profit every man and woman in this church and the church said you your gifts all your gifts were given to profit this entire church with all so brother bam said all n spiritual gifts should be operating and moving praise God we're not discouraged if we don't see them all yet because we still got time to serve the Lord amen and perhaps there might be a reason he might not want this gift at our church might not I don't know but we must be willing to be led of God and we must sacrifice in order to see God what gifts do you have in the church what can we do for your glory amen because remember you're supposed to covet the follow charity and desire the best gifts Hallelujah so this is the gift of knowledge somebody who can study this Bible right here and when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows there's the knows knowledge I know it I know it I've read it to present your case before the judge and now gift of knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which goes up and finds out things that are to come and brings them that back down now the reason I'm we I have to say this the gift of knowledge has to be separate from prophecy they have to be separate gifts because the Bible list them as separate but I'm seeing I'm showing how brother brandom a lot of times puts them together they can be used together aren't many gifts used together knowledge and wisdom are almost always used together in the Bible you can look up there's like 50 scriptures where knowledge and wisdom are together there's like 50 scriptures where oil and wine are together there's just gifts that operate together like Divine Healing and miracles amen Divine Healing and miracles go together all the time Hallelujah watch which I'll show you brother Ram said brother Ram said this I do not have the gift of Miracles how many know he said that he said I do not have the gift of Miracles but because I have the gift of Divine Healing he said the angel Lord will do many miracles in our meetings see some gifts go together so this one obviously gift of knowledge goes often with prophecy because it's giving you an understanding it's helping you understand your case and it may foretell the future but you got to study the book praise God you got to study the book present your case he said but they must compare with the Bible with the book if they're out of the book then they're not received because the judge is the judge judges by the book you see it so it must be on the word praise God is that a help by God's grace gift of knowledge somebody who can study the book someone who can bring out the scriptures the keys that you need to enter into something enter into Ministry to enter into Divine Healing enter into the relationship or enter into these things these are all gifts of the Spirit and we need them all the time don't we especially if we're going to enter into a marriage or especially going to enter into having children or or when to stop having children you really need the Holy Spirit to do that Hallelujah you must be led of the Holy Spirit and this is where the gift of knowledge can be crucial because it gives you the understanding to enter into something to do something for the kingdom of God number three faith faith is a now the Greek is a conviction of the truth of anything it's a belief now the Bible definition is it's an inner substance so it's already inside of you praise God and it's an Evidence or proof like my like our Taekwondo guy was saying he he said oh faith faith is something you don't have evidence for and he's like you know I never lik that definition and I want to raise my hand but I didn't but I said faith is actually a substance it's actually something you have you actually have evidence when you have faith Hallelujah because the evidence is inside of you it's written in your soul hallelujah heyen it's the proof or evidence of God's will that moves mountains can be mountains of sin mountains of unbelief mountains of disease and makes all things possible brother ramam said that's a gift of faith they believe what they're going to receive when they ask for it Faith here's a good quote 1947 oh it's the first sermon he ever recorded faith is a gift of itself you may have a portion of it but there's a gift of faith that is why I've said in the past a gift of faith is just more faith than what normal normal Christians have it's more of the same Hallelujah just like a gift of wisdom is just more of the same because I can take you to Romans 12 and the Bible said God has given everyone a what a Measure of Faith everybody because that's the first step on the stature of perfect man faith faith virtue knowledge faith is the very first thing you receive oh he is Christ I know he's the Messiah I'm convicted it's in my heart I know I'm saved that's Faith everybody's got a portion of Faith but if you got the gift of faith you have a greater portion of Faith just like some of you people anoint the sick and pray for them and you have a result that isn't a gift of healing that is a portion of Faith but that isn't a direct gift of healing for there's only one direct gift of healing there's only one direct gift of faith there's only one direct gift of Miracles and so forth so that that's where we this is a little bit uh uh important too as you understand sometimes the gift of faith heals somebody instead of the gift of healing okay sometimes the gift of Miracles does a healing and not Faith or healing so that's a little deeper but I hope you understand that the gifts can overlap they can they can they can they can be used different gifts can be used to accomplish the same thing Glory so that's what I want to say gift of faith is just more of the same most of the ministers who preach Divine Healing are usually all that I've ever met are great teachers of the word some of them just have a great powerful Faith just lay hands on the people and scream out and make the enemy leave them now that's Faith that's a gift of faith they believe that they're going to receive what they ask for that's the reason they take a hold of it in that manner I admire men like that men like or Roberts and AA Allen and all the men of the field who has great ministry ministerial gifts of the Spirit to move in faith so when our little children like I was thinking about our little children when they pray for pray for each other and they they believe they're going to get healed what is that a gift of faith they just know God's going to answer don't you like that don't you want to feel like that I just know God's gonna hear me like that one time I prayed for Sister Lisa at the other church I just felt like I told the church I said I just feel like I was crying said I just feel like God heard her prayer and then God did hear the prayer it was about uh children and so forth like that you see it's a faith it just God reveals it he makes it known to us that he's going to that he heard our prayer Glory and number four this is a a a great one the gifts of healing we're familiar with it it's a means of healing Remedy or medicine the gift of healing and of course it can be prayer of prayer of faith speaking the word laying on of hands faith is required for healing so you must have a revelation it's God's will to heal you no matter how long it takes to manifest healing is the deliverance from the oppression of the devil because the Bible said Jesus was sent out to heal all those who are oppressed of the devil so sickness is often Devil's oppression Devil's torment healing comes through many means such as laying on of hands speaking the word and natural remedies just to name a few but there are so many channels of healing that's why there's a s gifts brother Ram says there's so many ways to be healed like he said a box of chocolates could cast a demon off of wife you know that brings healing right is that right it's true she just needed to see that he loved me that's really something uh it could be anything like I said it was figs in one case in the Bible with Hezekiah it was figs Isaiah said go get some figs and rub it on you and three days later he was healed figs so that's why sometimes if somebody uses a herb or oil or something like that it could be God God's Channel now we don't put any virtue in the Fig right we don't put any virtue in the the prayer cloth right but it's what it represents praise God it represents that God heals through many different means and I'm going to trust him he's ging me something I can grab on to amen something I can believe now brother B said this there's no such thing as the gift of healing talk about one gift because it's in the plural it's gifts God works in many different ways to heal the sick how many believe that and this is the one we see most often I think in our churches thank God for that thank God I mean you might say there might be wisdom preach and I believe that I could go with that but as far as the gifts of the Spirit I think this is the one it's most easiest to see somebody comes up for prayer they're healed or they say pray for me I'm sick at home and they raise up in the next few minutes or something like that then we know God healed them praise God and we're thankful for that we're very thankful I just pass my hour so just give me uh I'm not going to set the timer okay just let me finish I'm almost at I'm almost at the end because I got just four five more gifts and then a few quotes now some of those who have the great gift in healing that's called Gifts of healing or gift of healing there's no such thing as the gift of healing because it's in the plural it's gifts God works in many different ways to heal the sick sometimes preaching the word heals the sick I'm very thankful to see that in my Ministry sometimes a neighbor sitting by so neighbors listen if you got a neighbor and just lay his hand over on you feel like he should do so always do that now brothers be careful F if it's not your wife right use wisdom ask your H ask the wife's husband to lay his hand on it praise God whatever a born again child of God feels to pray for the sick that's the Holy Spirit moving in you to do so no matter who's gonna pray for the person you go ahead and pray for them anyhow look what he said no Minister can heal you so see again it's not the person it's the gift there's no people who claim to people who claim to have the gifts of healing Gifts of healing don't mean you heal the people it only means you have faith in the word of God for healing amen so the gift of faith is for anything it could be healing but the gift of healing is Faith for healing amen and the gift of Miracles is Faith for spontaneous Miracle Allelujah that's what they are now remember these Remain the church until when the Rapture then God takes them out of the church right amen they're here they're amongst us we must sacrifice we must be in the channel for the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so they now doctors wouldn't do not talking about Saul and David Saul and he good they had a lot of doctors down there but they couldn't help him because of that spiritual condition so one of them man passed around him and seen a few places and said well we know where there's a Divine healer at why who would that be said Jesse's got a son back there he said yeah he's a Divine healer sure it was he healed by music you can be a Divine healer and heal heal through giving gifts praise God natural physical gifts you can heal through that amen that's what he did he had a gift of casting out evil spirits the Holy Ghost hadn't come in those days so he cast them out by music playing the words of the Lord the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want okay now we know that and it Disturbed the evil spirits so much that they left Saul they David was a Divine healer oh I love the message amen don't you love the word of God that was a channel to be a Divine Healing how many times have Brother loris's songs brought me to tears and worship and praise and sacrifice how many times how many times have a special bless you like this morning if it not it ought to help you something's wrong with you these songs are supposed to bless our hearts amen how can they not bless you you're going to go to heaven and spend the eternity listening to songs like that they need to bless us in other words we need to appreciate from them for what they are they're to bring healing to us they're to bring strength to us they're to bring courage to us they're encourage us to love the Lord more now I don't have the quote right here or I'm sorry I don't have the but here um I was showing brother Austin on the way here on Wednesday night I mentioned Lady Gaga I know I know she's an awful well at least right now she's in an awful awful condition I'm not going to say she but she's obviously moved by demons and I seen on Facebook where uh Franklin Graham Billy Graham's dad said that she sang God Bless America at the Super Bowl and I didn't watch the Super Bowl I don't think you should either but uh and I thought what a what a deceiver that is and I went and found the lyrics on Google search of her song called Judas she has a song called Judas and it says uh one of one of the songs says or one of the verses in the most biblical sense I am beyond repentance it says she calls herself a prostitute wretch Judas kiss me if I if offended and she says I Want to Love You demon of Judas that's the actual words are je Judas is the demon I cling to I cling to and there's so many more lyrics I'm not going to read the rest of it it's so awful but here look how it's so deceptive look how Satan's using music to capture the hearts of millions of Young Americans well even around the world she sings God Bless America everything's all right oh she must be okay and right through it's a demon singing God Bless America tell me it's not a demon singing that and here she is before singing about how she loves Judas and uh actually the end the song Ends by saying whoa whoa I'm in love with Judas whoa whoa I'm in love with Judas but I'm still in love with Judas baby it says and seeing God Bless America it's the same thing Elvis Presley was a modern day Judas exactly modern day Judas so that's the power of satanic music what about the power of holy ghost music to heal the saints of God Amen to lift our spirits to get us out of depression Amen to get us encouraged stirred up put on some Godly holy ghost music and get into it believe it sing along with it worship with it and God will bless you amen we so Overlook that one gift or the gift of the guitar the piano we Overlook that gift of Divine Healing laying right there just push play on your new Ben Ben n Rod CD right my I love things don't you love this word my I just oh we'll just be singing about it forever praise God in eternity number five is the working of Miracles which the Greek calls it faith in the power for performing miracles in the Bible Miracles are instant spontaneous manifestations of healing uh or provision I should have put that or provision because Jesus did Miracles frequently the Bible said when you multip multiply loaves of bread that was a miracle the Bible said cast out demons was a miracle the Bible said turning water into wine was a miracle the Bible said curing a boy with a life-threatening fever a fever was a miracle and the Bible said of course raising Lazarus back from the dead was a miracle brother B said maybe you might not have the spontaneous Faith to bring something just a miracle right to you you may not have that kind of Faith here's the quote well I'm sorry this a different quote here's where he says he does how to get the Miracles and I've told you God before has performed it and you be real reverent and keep your head bowed and when you hear my voice on this microphone say raise your head then I if anything should happen a miracle I have no controls of Miracles them them's what my gift is not Miracles my gift is healing all you understand that don't you there's nine spiritual gifts but many times the angel of God will perform Miracles think about how many gifts we're operating you know on brother brandom all those Faith gifts and Divine Healing gifts and and so just because Divine Healing was Opera people had Faith well I can operate my faith gift I can operate the miracle gift and they might even know they not even know they have those gifts but they begin operating when one gift starts manifesting the rest start operating Hallelujah if the people are in the same channel of the holy spirit all the gifts will begin operating Hallelujah exactly right maybe you might not have the spontaneous Faith to bring something just a miracle right to you you might may not have that kind of Faith but Jesus said if you have the faith like a mustard seed you can say the mountain be moved and by and by it will come to pass it wouldn't vanish away but by and by it would come to pass how many love that so if you if if you say well I don't have faith for a miracle just have faith just believe the word just keep confessing it he said because faith and unbelief won't mix and if you've got just the least little grain of Faith that's genuine Mustard Seed Faith and that won't move stay with it it'll bring you out Hallelujah here's another one right here 1950 now some people have faith like this some has got that much I guess he must be moving his arms or his fingers some has that much and some can go Plum over their heads in the Miracles see how much Faith you got you got this much this much this much or Plum over your head in the Miracles how much Faith do you got amen if you got faith for miracles then God gave that to you to glorify his word glorify himself that's beautiful praise the Lord now does that help by God's grace I've just seen a few Miracles but like I said I don't know if it's through me now remember I I told you I had a brother from Columbus said three times while I was preaching in 2012 or 13 He said I am going to use Jesse for miracles and he shook it off and said I'm gonna use Jesse for many miracles I'm me it's the third time and so he had to come tell me he was all trembling after service at the park and he'd come up and tell me he said God told me three times he's going to use you for miracles so I'm just waiting on it I haven't seen it lately but I'm just waiting on it by God's grace if it's of God it will have to come to pass if it's not it won't come to pass but that doesn't hurt me at all I'm pressing on the upward way I'm gaining new heights every day praise God and it'll be God's will so I still feel pulled to the mission field sometimes I've seen Miracles over there like the man with arthritis he was just instantly healed there he started walking and praising and jumping God around there in South America and the woman healed of the the kidney stone that was such a wonderful Miracle right happened right away thankful for God's grace okay 678910 or 6789 sorry prophecy now some of these we know so I'm going to go kind of faster through these prophecy is foretelling future events knowledge of future events that strengthens convinces Comforts and judges in the scripture prophecy does all that it can do all that now how many ever had a dream that come to pass it might have been God anointing you to prophesy now you might not have told anybody because you didn't maybe understand it but now if you know it's a channel now if you know it's a channel that God can get into then you want to say God help me to use it to glorify you to it can be a blessing to somebody it can Comfort somebody sometimes prophecies Comfort sometimes prophecies judge they forell a judgment upon somebody sometimes they strengthen or convince people that God's real because they foretell events brother bam said okay now A Dream Is interpreted then becomes a vision is prophecy there's a difference in a prophet and a get the prophecy and there's a get the prophecy which is in the church it's to be judged by two or three judges when it's given there's a difference in a prophet and a get the prophecy if you notice in the Bible healing is in plural it's gifts g f TS Gifts of healings but a p r o p h t is a prophet and there is a gift to prophecy which is in the church it's to be judged by two or three judges when it's been given out is that true now this is let me just be honest this is where I've kind of missed it this is where I'm feel like I need to grow I've told you and it's happened before I've heard tongues interpretations and prophecies after services and this is what I failed to do because I wasn't there yet spiritually I wasn't mature enough spiritually now if you are praise the Lord you can help Teach Me by God's grace but if it's foretelling anything in the future then the real Church orders have two or three judges with the gift of uh with the gift of discernment to come around and say is this right right or not is this right or not is this right or not and then they go forth and say this is right praise God that's how the gifts actually work and this is where I've been guilty and this is where I need to grow now not guilty like I'm sinful but guilty like I wasn't there yet I'm not spiritually I wasn't even aware of this you know I've just learned this in the last few years a prophecy before anybody gives it out or I'm sorry before people should Rejoice over it should be judged first but ra said now if excuse it please don't think I'm wrong here that's where in the little breakup that come amongst the Pentecostal people recently called latter rain that's where they got off the line right there for a when a gift of Prophecy come to a man they declared him to be a prophet now that's wrong so see they took somebody who just had a gift to prophesy and made him a Bible interpreting Prophet that's wrong the prophet stands there he interprets the word like St Paul like Moses like brother brandom but if somebody just foretells the future they automat think oh he should be leading us and that's not how it's supposed to be you have to you have to find out am I just called to prophesy or am I called to be a prophet in this day we're not looking for any Major Prophets well we appreciate Minor Prophets amen but we haven't seen many of those either amen so that's that's that's the big mistake people make when someone foretells the future they want to instantly magnify them and give them a Pulpit and give them but be careful they might not be called to do that takes the Holy Spirit to judge that and that's the gift of discernment number seven gift of discernments this is knowledge that distinguishes or discerns or judges so if anybody ever prophesies here or speaks in tongues gives unknown unknown tongue into interpretation we need to have some judges here that say I got the gift of discern I can know God can tell me he can tell me is this the Antichrist Spirit or is this the spirit of Christ so the Bible defines that discernment judges the spirit behind the actions prophecies and words it judges it and knows that's of God that's of the devil brother bar said a message of tongues has to be before the church receives it Paul said let let's leave two or three judges with the sermon of spirit before it can be accepted in the church and this is like I said where we haven't had much experience but I hope church I honestly I say this I know I've said it before I hope God leads us into these things hope God just leads us into a a full book of Acts church now I believe we're a part of the book of Acts church already what I'm saying is to see everybody moved by the Holy Spirit where I see and I come to church I come to the pulpit and there's already been the spirit moving already in the morning praise God that's what brother B said that's what I want to see I want to see the Holy Spirit already moving before I even come to preach God's word and then I know what I studied yesterday as I prayed and fast or as I sought God I know it was the right thing because it'll be just what that Spirit was ministering here to the people but said a message of tongues has has to be before the church receives it this this is where I I feel like I've missed this Paul said let's leave two or three judge with the sermon of spirit before it can be accepted to the church in the church age book brother's talking about tongues how do you know the how do you know the origin of a tongue he said now tongues is the evidence we know it's not of receiving the Holy Ghost then every tongue would have to be of God but if it has been admitted by tongues evidence people that there are false tongues and true tongues for God has the genuine and Satan has the false so my question is who knows what is real who understood the language to know what was spoken who has the gift of discernment to know hallelujah amen now let me say this every Christian who's born again the Holy Ghost has a portion of discernment as well because the word inside of you the word is a discerner and brother B said in the message thirst it's like a buzzer and it goes off to protect your life when there's something false Doctrine preached so that's an automatic discernment you have and and uh you have the holy spirit inside of you as the the spirit of God and automatically can discern to a certain degree about the preaching oh that's right that's wrong that's right that's right that's right that's wrong hopefully when I'm preaching it's right it's right it's right that's what I desire by God's grace if it's wrong come talk to me after service so see that's what we have a portion of that but someone who's got a gift of discernment has a better bigger portion of that because they can stand there and say sister so and so was led of the holy spirit that was true prophecy or this was a true word of knowledge it helps you to understand and uh gives you the scripture to unlock something for your life that was thus say the Lord or how about this coming up and saying that's false that was of the devil this person needs to repent and it might be our favorite person in the church might be me could be who knows because the Holy Spirit can fall in anybody to do any gift but if it's wrong it wasn't the holy spirit that did that that was Satan that did that but see how you got to have see how you got to be prayed up church people want the gifts but who's willing to sacrifice you see that's what I'm saying who want who's got the courage to stand up and say no brother so and so was wrong when he said that that was of Satan who's got the courage to do that see it takes the leadership of the Lord it takes a real walk of consecration but see we got to be willing you got to be willing to invest in that you got to be willing to sacrifice in that I've been an hour and a half so I'm almost there I'm 9 and 10 diverse kinds of tongues only one service today praise God diverse kinds of tongues are languages languages many kinds of languages speaking languages or tongues of men or Angels brother Braham said tongues of angels there's no interpretation for he said it's just unknown he said you're talking the language of angels so Angels must not speak English that must not be their fluent language they must know other languages some tongues are for private prayer if they are being no interpreter tongues that are interpreted edify the entire church and our most desired the gift of interpretation and prophecy is greater than the gift of tongues because they edify more people that's why tongu is the least of the gifts because you can have it and it just helps you it's me me me me me but if you got other gifts they help more people and that's those are that's why they're greater wisdom is greater because it manages all the other ones but if you have knowledge that can be a great benefit to people oh I know right what the scripture said God was dealing with me and wanted me to call you about this scripture it gave me an understanding that you need to believe this scripture you need to act upon this scripture brother Ram said I've spoken tongues several times and I believe it's the power of God yes I don't believe in initial EV now and speaking in tongues but I believe there's a power of God that makes you speak in tongues signs and wonders to follow here brother man look at the bold letters here brother's talking about I was walking along there I was singing I always sang when he was working I had different places where I went to pray I was going along there singing and all at once I come to find out I was speaking in tongues not knowing what I was doing he tells a few stories about that praying on his chair before a meeting and somebody come knock on the door and say brother brandom someone's in there with you he said no it's just me go go away I'm still prepared come back brother BR somebody's in there talking to you he said no and but M said oh I was speaking in tongues he said wow that's powerful I felt like two or three times I was going to speak in tongues but I just I don't know why I didn't didn't go beyond that but I know not all speak in tongues it's a Temptation for me to want to do that because I was raised around tongues all the time my whole life I was raised around tongues interpretation it's a Temptation for me to want to try to impersonate that but I gotta wait till God sends it if God don't send it it ain't for me see speaking in tongues comes in such a combustion that the person hardly knows what they're doing or they don't know what they're saying and interpretation is the same way they know not what they're going to say they have no more idea than what they're going to say because it's supernatural see as as long as you get the natural in it then you got natural see but if something just grabs you takes a hold of you and you're doing it see now remember that can be a genuine gift you could be the holy ghost that could be the Holy Ghost speaking in you with unknown tongues and you be lost and go to hell the Bible said so you believe that would you like to have a scripture on that you want scripture raise your hand though I speak with tongues as men and angels 1 Corinthians 13 both the one that can be interpreted and that cannot be interpreted genuine Holy Ghost tongues so tongues of men can be interpreted tongues of angels cannot be interpreted I am nothing see unless that other goes with it you can have this so don't reach after that without this get this first and then actually that'll follow interpretation of tongues oh and I think I forgot to put some quotes behind this one let me just skip ahead here real quick yep I'm sorry yep I forgive me I forgot to put the one the quote behind us interpretation in tongues I went over it a lot I I think I read through it anyway interpretation is telling what others has spoken it should be prayed for like last last time we had a tongue was about a year and a half ago over there in that sanctuary and we prayed for like 15 minutes I got on tape too I recorded it on my phone and uh the interpretation never came uh so we just said praise the Lord you know maybe it'll be again but then the person felt led to leave the church so praise God that's how that works but in interpretation must be judged by the gift of discernment too so the tongue interpretation must all be judged by the gift of discernment now let me close with these quotes has this been helpful by God's grace okay brother bam said this he called himself a jellyfish sometimes this why I want to encourage you don't beat yourself up if you've missed God don't beat yourself just repent say you're sorry don't beat yourself up if you haven't done anything for God yet because brother brandom made mistakes with gifts God he said God will literally show him visions and he wouldn't act upon them just like God will speak something to us and we don't act upon it but man said this is secondhand of robe 1956 sometimes I look at myself I think I've been such a jellyfish in my life I have waited to missst many thousands of souls can you imagine that into the kingdom of God because I've waited and said well God depending too much on a spiritual gift and said Lord if you'll just show me if you'll give me a vision to what to do and God give me the vision then I'll turn around let somebody talk me into something else look at that God will give him a vision and tell them you need to do this and brother bam said many thousands can you imagine that this man lived in Visions all day and oh I've never come to the spot yet until I like I have it this time that I feel it's a faith that I must step out there because it's a promise so now instead of waiting upon the vision go in faith knowing that God's called me to do certain things I don't have to wait on a gift all the time don't have to wait wait wait I can just know it's God's promise and go out there and do what God's called me to do and the things he has done and the healings he has performed and the Miracles even so much as come down and have his picture taken by the side of us and so forth which has never been known since the world began and then stand around like a what jellyfish this is why I love brother Brandon because he was a humble Christian he could say you know what I'm not perfect with my gift I've missed many thousand Souls so can you imagine there was probably meetings the Holy Spirit told him to go to and maybe maybe turn it down he said I was a jellyfish to that I didn't have a real backbone I really couldn't stand with the word of God that's why I'm trying to tell you don't be discouraged be encouraged just repent and make it right and it even makes me discouraged with who myself I never battle discouragement I battle often that's the thing I battle most is being discouraged about myself Mercy it's time to keep your eye on the promise and that's what by God's grace I am to do I realize that every devil of Hell will shoot at it will shoot at me but by God's grace I aim to keep my eye on the promise let's stand to our feet I'll read one more quote as we're standing I've been hour and 10 minutes so let me read one more quotation here I just have to skip ahead you know brother bam said Jesus had all the gifts of the Spirit yeah let's end with these quick quotes here but said the bride has run through gifts how many you believe that b said this in sman church age God never tended the church to be run by men God runs his church and runs it through gifts of the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is in the church to correct the spirit every believer has an individual Ministry amen amen so see and that means what I'm saying is that I want everybody to feel the same burden I have for every service that would be my greatest desire if everybody would come to church and have the same burden I do I have a burden because I brother Adam I don't want to fall in my face and people know well he didn't pray enough or he didn't study enough or or he missed the spirit he got in the flesh I have a burden and so I pray and and repent to do that to make sure I'm in the channel now if only everybody had that desire and brother B said you should after this we'll see who really takes it to heart see who really believes the prophet and actually can put it into you might believe it but who can put it into action amen that's what we want just like those serpins we want to be in action right cover the eyes cover the legs be in action then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that's knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing Miracles tongues and all these things go in each local body and every person let's say every person ready every person in the church has an let's say individual Ministry ready individual Ministry your ministry is not the same as mine but you have one and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Christ remember you can give gifts you can sing songs it brings healing there's many many gifts of healing you just have to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit and we read that every the manifestation of spirit is given to every man and the Holy Spirit divides to every man and this is one of my favorites I I think maybe if I haven't read this before I'll probably keep reading it again God carries in 10 years you come back I might be reading this again by God's grace because brother B said at church order 1963 now like this if brother Neville say now let me par me if brother KH speaks with tongues and brother hion gives interpretation then they have a Ministry together for the church now that isn't the ministry of brother Neville that's your ministry to the church I'm giving this as an example then you Brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as the pastor is interested in getting his because it's just as essential that you do it does everybody act like that in every church that you know where well I better prepare for Sunday too or I'll just let the pastor prepare this is what brother Ram taught everybody should be just as interested everybody's got an individual Ministry and everybody should be just as interested in the pastor as in his ministry to help the body of Christ for Lord just come to the piano here let's end on that one by God's grace because I know if you're a real Christian you're interested in your ministry how many are interested in what God has for you to do for him we are let's bow our heads here by God's grace Heavenly Father Lord I just bow my head Lord and thank you for this hour and 13 minute sermon Lord God I have just tried to hit the highlights and summarize some of these things I felt kind of pulled to preach on this and then when Sister Amy told me it was her last service I thought this would be a good thing to do holding a few months off on this four months and Lord I know some of these things we've heard before but Lord maybe today was the day where it really really struck our hearts where we now realize well I Haven an inid individual Ministry it might be in the wisdom God has placed in my life I have none of my own but I see God's wisdom flow out through me and it helps people manage the Affairs of their life or I've had a word of knowledge that would give someone the key or the understanding they need to get delivered or get victory over this or help them get out of their sin I've got a gift of faith there's times you show me Lord I just know you heard my prayer or I've got a gift of healing I played a song before and it's healed someone or I've laid my hands on somebody or I prayed and fasted and some God healed somebody or God's given me discernment to judge or that pracher was the right Spirit or not or that song special was in the right Spirit or not and the Holy Spirit let me know that was of me or that was not of me Lord my prayer is that everybody would be just as interested in this service and next week service As I Am Lord God and Lord I've got to battle with my interest too I'm I'm a man I I get tired I get weary I make mistakes I'm not pointing out the people I'm pointing out all of us if we say we believe the message if we say we believe the Bible help us to follow holy ghost's Love and Desire spiritual gifts Lord God and if we desire that then we'll consecrate Our Lives we may have to sacrifice some time some meals as we heard last Sunday which was such a powerful message to me Lord Jesus they won't even miss a few meals to get the Holy Ghost as your Prophet said they'd rather go eat at McDonald's or rather go eat at home than get than fast and get the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Jesus help us to find Lord our sacrificial life as Christians Lord where everybody can be just as interested Lord in every Service as each person as the preacher as the song leader as the piano player so Lord I ask for a spirit of humility if there's a spirit of stubbornness I come against in the name of Jesus Christ Lord may you break that any Spirit of stubbornness or any Spirit of Pride that wouldn't humble itself and be a ser to the body of Christ in this church I ask that in Jesus Christ's name not by my authority but by these words I've said this word I preach I've read your prophets quotes I believe they're true in Jesus Christ's name I come against that may there be humility May there be such a interest in the things of God that we could sense your presence Lord that we could be a part of a body where Sinners are walking and know God is with us God is amongst you there is a God he discerned the thoughts in tents of my heart he foretold my future he prophesied he gave me the wisdom I needed with my life situation I had no idea of any of that knowledge of the word but you brought you brought that word with the thus sayith the Lord you brought it in such a humble manner God spoke to me today Lord let our church be like that dear God that was my prayer a few months ago when we preached on the key of faith I'm still holding on to that scriptural key Joel chapter 2 Glory that the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride Grant it Lord Jesus I wait I believe I'm Lake Abraham Lord by your grace I'll keep holding on Lord I'll keep holding on to the promise of God it's your promise I believe I'll enter to that dear God May each and every heart be consecrated now in Jesus Christ's name amen My Savior art thou if I love my Jesus let's s that first verse again how me love him now praise God my Jesus I love thee I know

about half the time didn't we we did the first half about correcting people and then we spent the last half on gifts in the church I felt inspired to preach it yesterday preach it today and Lord's trying to send us a message Lord willing let me say this we'll pray here for a few more minutes and we'll be dismissed but listen I want everyone to know this if we don't get interpretation I still want sister Nomi sister Nomi if you look up here if you get a chance I still want you to speak whenever God puts on your heart you just F You Just Let It Go by the holy spirit because there might be

don't know about you but I'm like brother Bram I covet that God sends us gifted people here how many come how many cover that by God's grace I cover that I pray for that it also might be that sister naom me God might give her the gift of interpretation at a future time so we always want her to stay in that channel just like I want to stay in the channel to preach and teach you and give you wisdom or lay my hands on the sick and they get healed praise God so don't ever get confused I know there's quotes that says oh if there's no interpretation stop it but brother Braham didn't do that till 1963 19 so all those 17 years he was gone he let it the tongues go like that and waiting for interpretation so that's how we do it brother said when it gets mature then you put it in the room does everybody understand I'm not going to put in the room yet because I want to see I want I want to give her a chance to grow into this I want to give other people they got gifts to grow in their gifts
