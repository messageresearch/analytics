that song men's hearts failing for fear that's what jesus christ said was going to happen in this day because of all the nations breaking the pestilences the earthquakes the wars rumors of wars men's hearts would fail for fear so we have to have hearts that overcome fear praise god that's what we're called to be today and we will by the grace of god judges 6 26 now verse 25 god tells him to throw down his father's altar and that was a really inspired sermon the last time we preached that because brother austin got to answer the prayer of the day after remember that brother hallelujah the day after so let's read verse 26 together if we can justice 6 26 on 3 1 2 3 and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down let's have one more word of prayer here as we bow our heads heavenly father lord we just have heart full of praise tonight lord god we've we've come to your house we're worshiping you we're loving you we're praying god we're interceding we know we're fulfilling the will of god for us tonight to gather more as we see that day

peaceful lives here in the u.s lord and we're praying god that you would stop abortion lord in jesus christ's name we're still praying for these blessings o god we sign cry for the abominations lord time and time again the continual sins of the the nation we know there will be no national revival the lord we still pray for mercy and grace to our children and their children should you tarry dear god hallelujah for our generations lord god for lord we don't know the dare of the hour so lord we intercede and we ask for grace lord and we ask for righteousness lord in the lives of all who believe lord god so father we just come tonight lord god ask you to bless your word anoint me anoint your people lord with your holy spirit lord god and may we have faith like gideon lord to overcome fear lord we ask that lord for we know there's a great spirit of fear upon the earth today lord god so we pray lord in christ's holy name that we would overcome fear and lord have a sound mind power and love by the holy spirit we ask that in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so we'll pick up right where we left off i just want to reiterate so far what gideon has heard here up to this point there's seven things the angel has told him or the lord has told him and just put yourself in gideon's spot here for a moment you know what would it take for you uh to to believe that god was gonna use you to destroy a whole army of heathens what would it take that are that have the number of the sand of the sea what would it take what kind of uh what kind of faith would you need to do something like that i believe we would need the faith of god i believe we would need the faith of the son of god praise god and so god has got to work on gideon over the course of these days and weeks and months here to help him to overcome his fear that he can lead israel to victory and bring them out of bondage how many want to see your family members out of bondage praise god your friends out of bondage amen god was gonna use this man because this man uh deep down inside he had potential for faith praise god and god was gonna let the trials of his life and the tests and his next few prayers and god was going to work everything together to bring out gideon's real faith which is recorded remember in hebrews 11 this man is a hall of fame member praise god hallelujah he's a member of the hall of fame of faith hallelujah and yet we look at his life and we see you know he was the least in his father's house he wasn't a he wasn't a great one if you lined up getting all of his brothers and sisters he was the least of them he was the one you think well this guy is not going to amount to much but just like david right but when god looks at it when god looks at somebody he doesn't look at the outward appearance amen he looks upon the heart praise god amen that's what god's looking at us tonight god's not looking at so much on our outward appearance yes he wants us to dress holy he wants us to live holy but he's looking at our heart amen and and so we just want to look look what the angels told him so the angel told him six things to this point and god has told him a seventh thing the first thing the angel said is god is with you the second thing he said he said you're a mighty man of valor yet he's the least in his house the angel said go in your might and you'll save israel. the fourth thing he said god has sent you the fifth saying the fifth fifth thing sorry the fifth thing the angel said was i will be with you and you will smite the midianites the sixth thing he said the angel accepted i'm sorry the sixth thing was yes the angel was accepting his meat and bread sacrifice so six things already that the angels told him or accepted and he had every vindication everything he's asked of god god has accepted praise god and then the next thing that very night god meets him at the night time and said get in i give you peace so what does that mean gideon was still battling fear he had all those vindications from the angel but that night he's got he's battling fear and god said peace be with you and then god said fear not you'll not die church what is the what's the you know what's the main thing a man's gonna have to battle a woman's gotta have to battle fear of death right that's the main thing we have to battle in church if we're honest with ourselves as the rapture nears what's the one question we have well am i going to have to die before the rapture right is the squeeze going to produce persecution where some people are going to die before the rapture what about the children will they be will they go in the rapture or they have to stay here and and and be prisoners you know we have all these questions in our mind right and they're real questions they're there's questions these are the same questions we've had for 2000 years because every generation every real believer has believed god was coming in their day if they didn't then they weren't really on fire for god right when you're on fire you live like he's coming soon praise god you keep your soul in a condition where all the sins repented i made this right lord god you know financially you live like you're going to have you know a lifetime but spiritually you live like he could come at any hour and i'll be ready when he calls me amen hallelujah like can you imagine paul's day the roman emperor was murdering christians and you would think you would think after seeing a hundred martyrs you know tens and twenties scores of your friends die you would think well this would be the coming of the lord look at rome the beast the beast is persecuting us right they could say the roman beast is persecuting us and no doubt they would think the rapture would be any day now persecution's at its highest realm but yet what happens another generation comes another and then a couple generations later then rome unites with the government and the government shuts down the persecution and then there's no more persecution right physical persecution but then it's it's a and then following that was the dark ages battle no bad or no very few bibles yet then persecution had really increased during that time but then here we are in the days of john wesley the persecution weakened and since since the days of john wesley the church over well at least in north america has experienced very little persecution but of course in the middle east there's all kinds of persecution on christians and even in the even in the uh the east uh china and so forth north korea there's a lot of persecution on christians so church no matter down through the 2000 years we each believer has had to recognize that jesus could come and the bible said they've got to make themselves ready the bible says you're like a the preachers are like servants feeding the people and then the people are looking and watching for jesus to come in other words we have to be eating and feasting on the word of god and ready so whenever jesus knocks we're ready to open praise god whenever we hear whenever we hear about the coming of the lord whenever you hear the voice of the holy spirit the shout the voice of trump amen the voice of the trump we got to be ready for those times amen we got to live like we're ready to go hallelujah the bible said we'll either live like that or we'll the bible says the preachers will get drunk and start beating the the people right and that's where you get preachers that abuse and hurt the people see but we're not we're not of that type we're not here to beat people and and uh discourage them we're here to feed you the word of god amen and yes part of the feeding is correcting and we get we all got to be corrected from every day the holy spirit has got to correct us praise god so we should expect in sermons to be corrected praise god but overall we're feeding on the word of god we're pointing everyone we're pointing you i'm being pointed the holy spirit's pointing all of us to the word of god amen to feast on the word of god hallelujah whereas denominations are pointing us to their creeds trinity creed you know like we've been talking with people from austin they're pointing them to creeds rather than the word but our objective is to point us to the word of god hallelujah amen so god says you'll not die so church we've got to have the same faith whether i die whether i live or die i'm going to live like jesus christ is coming in my lifetime amen so with all these seven visitations these seven words rather two visitations but seven groups of words gideon is now strong enough with these words he's strong enough to sneak out at night and he's able to chop down his father's groves of idols and destroy the idols and on top of that he's able to organize and set up an altar doesn't that remind you of elijah on mount carmel after the the baal prophets worshiped and cut themselves and no they never got fired from heaven elijah had to order uh the stones first 12 stones amen hallelujah 12 government kingdom he had to organize the 12 and then they put water on it in other words you've got to make ready in other words you got to put god's word first and obey all the word of god amen gideon had to obey all the word of god set up a sacrifice church our lives should be living sacrifices amen that's what that represents praise god we live sacrifices unto god like i'm mentoring a brother and tonight tonight is the brother's first night to go to wednesday services in years and i'm mentoring this brother and he's so excited he said i'm trying to get my life back in the habits of god he done it for a year but then he's had some battles and uh there's been some hard mind battles there's been some hurts in the in churches and so the holy spirit has directed him to another church and tonight's his first night he's getting his strength back he's going back to church amen now you know what that's like buddy you just got back in december right now you know what that get those habits back right get your strength back amen and god is building us up amen hallelujah that's what that's what i tell everybody you know that's how i was telling even the uh the man i was mentoring a few days ago i was telling him i said i said you never know what god's gonna do the main thing is to be faithful god can move on to wednesday a sunday morning or sunday night you never know what god's going to do the thing to do is be ready be sanctified be set aside live like he's coming feast on the meat of god and god will show up and god will do what only he can do praise god amen our desire is to be ready for god to use us our desires to be ready for the coming of the lord amen just as getting here is getting ready by the holy spirit he's setting the altar in order and then he sacrifices unto god now wasn't that a beautiful picture we've got a we've got to undo the sins of our past we've got to undo the sins of our parents if if our parents were sinners you know gideon had to undo the sins of his past generation so for us if we're christians we have to forgive people who've hurt us in the past we've got to forgive our mothers forgive our fathers amen if anyone our uncles aunts or grandparents anyone who's hurt us we got to forgive that we got to undo that praise god amen we got to move on from the past we have to give a fresh sacrifice of ourselves unto god amen that's how you move on with god that's how you see the miracle praise god amen hallelujah and so gideon sets up the altar in verse 26 26 and 27 as we read now look at verse 28 now here we are let's get into our text here we'll preach as far as we can here by the grace of god his battle overcoming fear verse 28 when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon that altar that was built and they said one to another who had done this thing and when they inquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash had done this thing all right so now his name gets out it's a morning everybody saw oh they uh our gods are down someone's uh someone's trying to clean up our lives here someone's trying to clean up the neighborhood who was it who was it gideon see church let me say like this whenever you try to do something for god there's always going to be criticism there's always going to be people mocking you or there's always going to be somebody against you right but you but if we look at the picture the angel of the lord has told gideon he's with him and god has told him he's with him so if the angel and god is with gideon who can be against him amen if you're standing for god's word if you're making sacrifices for god who can be against you nobody can be against you praise god amen verse 30 then the men of that city said unto joash bring out thy son that he may die okay now now it's getting serious death threats because he hath cast down the altar of baal because he hath cut down the grove that was by it and joe i said unto all that stood against him that's a good question will you plead for baal will you save him in other words are you going to save your god are you going to are you going to argue your god's case why does your god fight for himself if he's god let him fight for himself right he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is yet mourning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar great that's a great comeback amen why do we got to kill him if he's a god he'll fight for himself amen is that right church god knows how to do things amen god knows how to get his man or his woman in position amen the bible said god is a man of war praise god god wants to move if god wants to raise up valleys or bring down mountains god can do it praise god he can do whatever he wants and look at the wisdom of this father here to say don't go kill him let that god fight for himself hallelujah if he's really god he'll fight for himself verse 32 therefore on that day he called him jerubale drew bale saying let baal plead against him because he had thrown down his altar so here gideon gets a new name gideon gets a name jerubable or druba yeah somehow they say like that drubale or drubable and that means let baal plead against him so now he's known now he gets a reputation now he's known by the god that he defeated amen see in other words church as you get victories you're going to have a reputation praise god amen hallelujah as you serve god you're going to have reputation well you better you know let's remember what god did through our brother let's remember what god did through our sister praise god you start getting in other words people start recognizing your gifts amen hallelujah people can see what god's called you to do praise god now what was getting his name his name met hewer right he was a cutter down of trees in this case he didn't cut down trees so much the main thing he got done was false idols amen he was born to destroy the works of satan amen hallelujah he was born to redeem his family can i say it like that praise god brother austin and sister lena you're born to redeem your family amen hallelujah that's what simon was born to redeem my family amen the oldest amen heard the message first hallelujah praise god amen hallelujah zion amen see one and a half saying amen to the word glory keep saying amen buddy hallelujah see church you get a reputation like there are still people that my brothers know when they really need prayer they're going to go to that person for prayer my wife knows who i'm talking about there's people you'll go to when you need prayer hallelujah and thank god for the prayers of the saints because it's through the holy spirit so gideon gets a reputation now that he's the one who cut down bale's altar hallelujah god used him to defeat false gods and look he's got a new name he's got a new reputation or new reputation praise god that's what happened when that's what happened to brother branham when he come out and started discerning now he's called a prophet of god he's called a seer right you gotta you gotta issue go to god's seer right and that's what they do they would flock to his meetings just to get a chance to be in his presence that perhaps god would speak to them and how many hundreds how many thousands of people praise god maybe millions were helped by the prophet of god because he had a reputation for being a seer praise god and church we're never going to have the gift of brother branham but there are nine gifts in our midst praise god amen whether we see it or not they're they're laying here praise god we just got to be faithful and brother baby says if you want to see the gifts operate you got to devote time amen you got to sacrifice time like gideon sacrifice amen sacrifice that's why time is the most valuable thing time is way more valuable than money but i'm saying you're gonna have to sacrifice time if you want to see the gifts of god in operation i remember the night we prayed and god answered our prayer for lena's mother it was what a sacrifice of time and energy we were up later that night i got less sleep that night i was more tired the next day but it's a sacrifice praise god it's a sacrifice it's always going to be a sacrifice amen and gideon gets this new name praise god his dad changed his name doesn't the holy spirit change unto the heavenly father change our name praise god we're sinners and gives us a new name misses lord jesus christ the whole family in heaven and earth is named the lord jesus christ the bible says hallelujah like i've had people to contact me this week and they say brother jesse you are a real teacher of god now i'm not that's what i'm that's not what i'm saying i'm saying that's what they say about me they recognize the gifts of god in my life that's what they say and the one brother he even sent me a message from canada or africa i can't remember where he's from oh india and that brother said yeah i'd remember the app that it was in it was in that telegram app not the other app you know my brain's got to go through those those pathways and i told him i said bro i said he said brother can you have your gifts before they before you're a christian i said yes brother ram saw visions before he was a believer right moses knew he had to deliver israel before he had met the burning bush right and i said with me my fifth grade teacher when i was 10 years old told me i'd be a better teacher than he was and look at i am i'm a teacher today spiritual and natural and i had no i had no desire to be a school teacher i want to be a doctor i want to be a football player an nfl i don't want to be a teacher sometimes i'm so tired of teaching i go home i don't even want to talk to i don't even say a word i just want to wash dishes at the sink and just listen to music i get so tired i teach they're talking all the time i get worn out you know warm wear myself out but see you get a new name praise god so i so now people know me when god used me they know me as this when god uses you then they know you as that praise god looks like gideon he now he's known as jerubal amen the one who defeated baal praise god amen now before he was nobody in this house he was nothing but now he takes god at his word look he made a sacrifice he cleaned out his family home life amen hallelujah praise god amen he believed god's word he acted upon god's word church anytime you act and obey on god's word god's gonna show up amen he's gonna bless you praise god when you take god's word and you obey god and you do what god tells you to do do exactly what he said he's going to bless you and here he blesses gideon and even his dad stands up for him those were his dad's gods how much money think he paid for those gods how much money do you think some of these men and women put into their filthy lifestyles how much money they spend on drugs how much money they spend on the sports addiction how about on alcohol how much think they spend on alcohol filling up their their ice cave what they call man caves with with beer and alcohol and wine you know or wine cave or whatever they got how many thousands but see gideon was led by the holy spirit to destroy that i'm cleaning that up god's doing a new thing the only way god can do a miracle is if he cleans up my life first amen hallelujah so just think of this church and i'm gonna say austin's name austin you may be your life being changed may be the key to everyone and other people in your family life receiving christ you may be the key for that praise god i can't remember but i know when i got saved numerous people got saved because they saw me get saved i can't remember their names now because i can't remember which ones it were you know i know i got to witness the different ones but when they saw my life change they will change right when they saw gideon change when dad saw gideon change dad changed amen when they see you change others will want to change praise god amen now verse 33 then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel now look at this verse 34. but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and abby eezer was gathered after him now look church the spirit closed getting in verse 34 he gets clothed with the spirit the spirit comes on him praise god see church when the spirit's on you you're you're a different person when the anointing is on you now you blow a public trumpet i'm ready to fight now amen what's a trump a trumpets for gathering or war praise god he didn't blow it before that he had to wait till he got victory in his home life amen when he got victory in his home life he got the real victory there then the holy spirit comes out upon he obeyed the first three steps he gets the spirit up the spirit comes upon him he said now i'm ready to fight now i'm ready to go out and do what god's really called me to do right that lines up with the joshua series right don't try to go conquer some other land conquer your land first don't try to correct other people you correct yourself first get your life cleaned up first then god's spirit will come upon you and now you're ready to fight amen hallelujah praise god he blows the trumpet and ebby ease of the priest was gathered after him this is so beautiful the bible says put you on the lord jesus christ see just like the spirit comes upon gideon the bible says as many as have been baptized into christ have put on christ amen see the anointing comes it's time for the blowing of the trumpet for a gathering because jesus said you'll be endued or clothed with power from on high hallelujah so this is a type of the baptism of the holy ghost justification was when gideon got called right sanctification would have been breaking down the altar of baal and this is the feeling because the spirit of god came upon him amen hallelujah beautiful type there so justification is just giving a sacrifice right believing the word of god sanctification clean out your life clean out your home amen get all the idols out of your family out of your life amen then when you get that victory pretty soon the spirit's going to come hallelujah amen in that beautiful the spirit of god comes upon him in verse 35 and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also was gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and his unto zebulon and the naphtali and they came up to medium all right so he's got the baptism of the holy ghost now he's ready for war he's got a big church behind him now too big church he's got a big church but you know even now even with a big church with a big uh a big group behind him even with all this support of warriors men that would fight he still has fear within him praise god how many know what i'm talking about you can be baptized filled with the holy ghost you can be sanctified justified and so so uh so bold sometimes but then other times you can have still feel fear inside your body simon just told me there's a sister that he still talks to and elderly sister and she says every time remember i come up for prayer crying on was it sunday night i was praying oh yeah sunday night i come up for prayer i really needed god to help me and i felt like god answered my prayer because i felt strike this week but brother simon tried to encourage me he said brother he said every time i talk to this certain sister she says oh thank god for brother jesse he's such a bull he's bold as a lion and he said every time i see her and we talk about you she says that you have that testimony because i'm afraid to preach whatever god puts on my heart now there's sometimes i fall short i'm not perfect you know who is there's no perfect preacher but i've never really cared about popularity right and so it is to this day that's fine i'm going to preach the truth no matter what anybody says amen if i gotta stand alone i'm gonna preach the truth of god i can only preach what the holy spirit has shown me praise god but i need a prayer for that i need a prayer for more boldness amen i need a prayer for uh to god to help me in this particular battle of my life see because we all have fear even paul remember paul paul raised the dead paul had prayed for eutychus he fell out of the the second story room he died he prayed for him raised him from the dead paul had been to the aina melita and seen that the governor his father healed of a bloody flux just a a blood oozing out of his body with infections paul had seen a miraculous miracle there but still the bible says in second corinthians 7 5 that paul had fears within and fears without praise god this ought to be so encouraging to us church no matter what god has called us to he's going to use all the events of our life to drive out all of our fear amen hallelujah a church that's why i rehearse from time to time with austin that's why i rehearse what that we got through y2k that i got through barack obama that i got through the blood moons that we got through the uh 2018 70 years from israel we got through coronavirus in 2020 we got through the election of 2020 even though it was rigged they know it's rigged that's why the you just you just take whatever opposite whatever the liberal media is saying that's what's probably true it's very very simple very simple because they're liars right and now here russia ukraine we've got to live through this everybody's shaken up is this the end of the world shaking up it may be but it may not be amen and if it's not then we've got to have faith no matter what we've got to have faith amen we've got to look at our past and say god has helped me here god help me there god help me there god never left me there he's with me here he'll bring me through this the spirit of god will raise up a standard amen i'll be able to fly the banner of christianity if nobody else stands i'll stand amen our army does not retreat praise god our army goes forward in the name of jesus amen hallelujah so paul had fears within we have fears within he overcame will overcome gideon had fears and so the next verse verse 36 is the second sign that he asks for now remember when brother brian hawkins was here and he said there's times you got to test god what he meant and he corrected it later he said what i meant is you can prove god because that's what the bible says with tithes and offerings remember in the book of malachi god said himself prove me with your tithe offering see if i won't open up the windows of heaven amen hallelujah and you're debt-free because of that amen hallelujah so am i except for my mortgage yeah because god has opened up the windows of heaven praise god and so gideon is just like any of us we we we get we get uh fearful sometimes we battle unbelief our faith is growing right but it's not maybe where it needs to be and so we need we say god give me a sign here god give me a give me an encouragement here lord give me a sign that i'm on the right direction church and that's what it is we're proving god that's normal remember paul was going to go to missionary work but then the holy spirit said i forbid you to go there so god sent him a dream of a man right in philippi saying come minister to us come in and the bible said well based father's dream we know which way to go now they're putting god to the test they're proving god's word they're proving god's will church that's the main thing i love that quote brother i said read your bible and pray every day he said before you make a decision say father would you have me to do this and he said somehow a way or another god will answer your request just pray about it amen just pray about every situation that's all we got to do church just pray and say god show me your will now some people need more signs than others but we can't criticize that because we all need signs that sometimes brother ram needed signs at the end of his life right he was he wanted a sign that he was going to be healed right from the uh the stomach sickness he got a sign praise god came on the wings of a dove amen hallelujah there's nothing wrong with wanting signs to know you're in the will of god just make sure it's a real sign from god and if we're not sure like we talked about say lord willing if the lord is willing because we're not prophets right we don't speak i've never heard any of you say thus saith the lord which is good because you're not testing god you're not trying to promote yourself as a false prophet and you see the uh happened a few months ago one of the false prophets of the uh prosperity gospel died from coven after he cursed coven and said it was gone in the name of the lord and he died from covet so you don't play around with god do not that man was playing around with he was pretending to be a prophet and then he died he said uh god he said i'm quoting all these scriptures i rebuke cove and it's gone and he died from it that's a false prophet remember that kenneth copeland he cursed it a couple weeks after it started it said it was gone and it was dead and but it hung it's still here people still get covered liars they're liars professional liars money making liars and no one holds them accountable see but you and i will hold each other accountable because we're honest we're really we have good and honest hearts the bible says so it's good it's good we don't prophesy unless we're called to it by god okay now he needs a sign he's now he's got his he got his clothes got his spiritual anointing he's baptized with the holy ghost but he still has a great enemy to overcome so he said lord i need a few more signs that you're with me in fact he actually gets four total signs he's got the first one the first one was that offering he laid before the angel right the meat and the cakes he said if you're it's really god receive my sacrifice and the bible said the angel stuck the the stick out and burned it up and consumed it now he's got the holy ghost we say in type he's got his army he's got his brother and his big church behind him and in verse 36 and gideon said unto god notice it's not god to gideon it's getting to god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said behold i will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and if he be dry upon all the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou has said and look church and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the fleece together and ring the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water right now look church we have to remember this gideon could ask this because he already had thus saith the lord that this was his job see many times the mistake we make as christians we ask god for signs but we don't even know yet if this is god's will for us but gideon already had the will of god it was god's will he said you're not going to die i'm going to be with you you're going to conquer the midi nights don't fear but he still needed some more vindications that he was going to get it so the trouble of the trouble that we do sometimes we say lord just give me this sign if it's your will but we haven't even prayed first and made sure the direction we're going is the right direction so what is it gideon wants to get rid of all the doubt because what the bible say he's a man of faith he's a man of faith what is faith faith is a substance of things hoped for what the evidence of things not seen so what he he needed more substance in his heart right he he said i just read that this week that man come up uh the man come up to jesus i forget i can't remember the story now i've just been i can't remember exactly the scripture but the man uh the man cried out for healing i believe was that maybe was the leper and i can't remember the leper the blind man and jesus said if you can believe and he said lord i believe but he said help might unbelief that was the father the boy with the the demon the father the boy with the demon he said lord i believe and he said it in tears he said help my unbelief and so jesus helps his unbelief see that's a church that's what we got we all get we all have that see he has a face side but he still has a human side and our human side is never going to want to believe so that should almost always be our prayer god i believe help me to get past this unbelief amen hallelujah that's the battle between faith and doubt he's a man of faith see that's a good sign that you do have faith that you know you got to overcome your unbelief praise god god has brought you so far but you know you got to go further with god how many want to go further with god then we've got to say lord i believe you're going to take me to rapture i believe you're going to save my mom or save my dad but help my unbelief praise god that's me tonight amen hallelujah praise god i believe but help my unbelief in other words gideon in other words pray in other words he prayed with the fleece he prayed until he got the answer and that's what we do we pray till we get the answer lord i got a big church now but i want to make sure this is your will for me you told me but i want to make sure now notice a fleece is a woolly covering of a sheep or a goat and in this case it's a miracle only when the dew falls on the lamb's covering rather than on the ground wet fleece and a dry ground was a miracle so this fleece was a lost sheep because it lost its life i'm just going to use a little type here but see first the water must fall on the lost sheep of the house of israel this type's israel right the ground which represents the gentile was dry first and had no rain because dew represents speech or the word of god right the bible said let your word fall as rain i read that to you a few weeks ago and also reign represents the coming of god so jesus was coming down praise god amen and then god answered he woke and he found the fleece wet and the ground dry the lost sheep was rung together in order to extract the water see water fills a bowl when a fleece is rung or or drained out praise god that's a good type there i'll fill my cup lord amen so this was showing gideon god's going to fill the cup amen god's going to bless you god's going to meet all your desires amen look at verse 30 39 and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against you does that remind you of anybody abraham remember brother austin abraham prayed for a lot to be saved and he went back and each time he went back he went back i think five or six times and each time he said lord please don't be angry i'm going to ask you another request he said lord he said lord if there's 50 yes if there's 40 if there's 30. finally abraham got lord if there's 10 please he said don't let your anger be hiding against me but lord if there's 10 will you spare nineveh and he said yes if there's 10. and the bible said then the lord left from abraham so we see gideon praying a lot like his father abraham amen his spiritual father amen he's asking for more grace and prayer requests oh church we can do the same thing today ask for more grace lord give me more grace times are getting tougher the challenge seems harder but i'm going to come again lord i need i need you to answer my prayer lord i'm coming again answer our request dear god amen i'm asking again here i am again lord here i am again that's why we never give up praying because we never gave up for you buddy never gave up for austin five years that's why we got to keep praying for the miracles of these sick people we got to keep praying don't we can't give up if we give up then we'll never get nothing he prays like abraham asking for more grace let me finish that scripture let not thine anger be hide against me verse 39 and i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee with this but once with the fleece let it now be dry upon only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground praise god so now he says let it be opposite let the ground have do he wanted god's proofs forward and backwards inside and out praise god he wanted everything and in every way in other words i want to know for sure i don't want one shadow of doubt that you're going to do what you promise you're going to do praise god that's why we should pray more right that's why we need to keep praying lord i don't want any doubts or take out all my doubts help me to be a man help me to be a woman of faith praise god i don't want to be in god's hall of fame one day hallelujah i'm in the hall of fame of high school sports how did i get there by practicing working hard i i i i didn't cheat the system i worked hard i kept going even though i got hurt it's okay i rehab and get better and now i'm in the hall of fame who cares about that one but we got lessons from that amen hallelujah praise god we're running a race for jesus amen the bible says we're not beating the air we're actually fighting a real enemy and so we need to say lord increase my faith lord i might lose a few fights but help me to keep battling praise god that i do not lose the war i win the war if i just keep going at it praise god amen gideon new you can't quit you can't give up you can't quit and expect to win and then there's also the you can't break the rules and expect to win you've got to come god's provided way amen there's 30 minutes about 45 minutes preaching let me try to close this here see there's nothing wrong with being like gideon lord i need to know that i know that i know you're going to do this i need additional signs okay whatever you need the thing to do is keep praying and so you're certain you know god's will that's why before i started preaching brother i fasted and prayed i think two days that week and asked god lord give me an undeniable vindication and before i even come up to preach a sister in the congregation gave a word of knowledge and it was basically telling what i was going to preach and i felt real good after that and after i preached the first two times the altar was full of people crying weeping repenting getting deliverance getting victories healings all kinds of things so there was no doubt anymore in my mind that was called to preach now did i have doubts later on when the when i come here and the church is small yes i have doubts but i just asked god for more vindication i asked god for an amen and god gave me an amen hallelujah in 2014 amen that's right i put god to the test amen i said prove your word god prove your will for my life i don't want to be outside your will i just want to do what you've called me to do praise god amen so see church we can all look at our lives and we can see ourselves in getting how many can see yourself and get in i clean out my house anointed by the holy spirit ready for war but i still lord i still need your your signs in my life i still need to know that i know inside and out forwards and backwards that you are with me see the the backsliding comes when you don't when you just assume god is with you instead of knowing inside and out that god is with you that's when the backsliding starts you just assume you're well god anointed me one time gideon said well god anoint me one time i don't need any more signs no see i need that constant there just i knew that constant communion with jesus amen oh i said god said something there praise god amen it's that constant if i'm going to do something that takes more than a conqueror i need the conqueror with me praise god because i am not a conqueror on my own i'm nothing i'm a sinner saved by grace i'm just a vessel but i'm a vessel in the potter's hand amen i have to make sure that my decisions my life is pleasing the potter see church we got to know god is with us through and through inside out up and down forward and backward praise god like when you go to those taekwondo tests brother i got to know those the korean words and the english words forward and backwards now they usually only ask us in korean right but you got to know it forward and backward you got to know it because you're going to get tested how many know you're going to get tested praise god don't forget job now church he lost his family his health his money all for what a test to test his character that's what it was all about that's the only thing it was about of course it made him more humble he repented but the whole thing was testing that man does that man really loved god god said find devil take everything away from him except his life and you'll see his character will stand all your tests may god help us have real character like that praise god no matter what god allows we'll stand the test and we'll overcome and we'll we'll shine the character of jesus christ of this world amen hallelujah so you look like jesus christ when you raise up and when you go to sleep when you go to work and when you come home people see jesus christ in you your whole life speaks of christ jesus and who is christ christ is the word christ is the word god hearken on the to the voice of a man to defy the laws of nature does that sound familiar god did it to isaiah hezekiah god turned that sundial back 10 degrees for hezekiah he defied the very laws of nature joshua he said the sun sun stands still amen praise god hallelujah moses god defied the laws of nature joshua water move back water make up a wall two million people are coming through here this sea is turning into a highway amen that's what our god does he turns season to highways amen graves in the gardens amen that's what he does he defies the very laws of nature praise god to tell you and vindicate that he's with you that's a lot like joshua a lot like moses a lot like all these prophets of god like the kings of israel now look church now gideon could say the god of joshua's with me because i just saw nature's laws defied just like joshua amen praise god hallelujah and church that's how we are when when we come to church and somebody preaches on our lives or some secret is revealed through a fellowship with a believer and we should say the same god that did that brother brahm's life that same god is here tonight amen hallelujah when we see god doing the same thing he did back there today we can say this is that praise god it's the same god god is here directing us he's letting us know we're on the way to victory just keep pressing forward receive the signs receive the word receive all of it praise god almost tripped there hallelujah the god of joshua's here he's doing the same works that he's always done hallelujah see this shows church god can put his water anywhere he wants with his fleece he can put it wherever he wants he can send water there can i say like this he can send a revival to our families that's what i need to prayer for amen that's what i want prayer for to have faith that god can do it praise god but see it also takes desperation also takes a man who's desperate like gideon too the bible said getting went to god god didn't come ask again hey you want to sign gideon was desperate and wanted to go to god for another sign hallelujah god can direct his waters his blessings to anyone he wants to see now the waters are on the vast ground which is the gentiles then the fleece of israel is dry isn't that what we got today didn't jesus say what will be done in the dry tree what about the green tree what about the dry tree the dry tree is a time without christ so the gentiles the green tree the living tree so we see a beautiful type in this fleece of jew and gentile christ death does it both right christ's death brings forth water to the jews water to the gentiles hallelujah now let's go to chapter seven here we'll just do a couple more verses and we'll be done here tonight then drubable who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of herod so that the host of the midnights were on the north side of them by the hill of mora in the valley and the lord said again the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel vault themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me god says with this big of a church you guys are going to get prideful so i've got to shrink your church i've got to make it smaller because this people has a tendency to get prideful whenever they get the victory i need a group of people that are humble here that are not going to take credit for the supernatural but will give all the credit to god so i've got to make the church smaller now how many would want to be a part of that and look look the the the the enemies north of them the enemies way out there they can see the enemy like the sand of the sea like the stars in the sky and now god that god comes down again and said your church is too big there's too much pride amen god may god drive all the pride out of our church amen that we would never exalt and take any credit for what god has done like we could do it anyway like it was our goodness now god will use your obedience but you don't have the power yourself to do anything you only have authority we have no power of ourselves we only have authority to speak god's word but we only do it with god's leadership praise god a great lesson for us a great lesson and church just let me say this i've heard new i've heard it numerous times over the years it just made more real to me many times when churches build a new building they get prideful and brother bram even says it on tape remember i was telling you about you i was telling you about that uh that child abuse case up north remember that last week that happened just two or three years after they built the brand new church just to fit one thousand see because when you get exalted up and prideful what happens you get your eyes off of the lord you stop seeking the lord see that oh look think of the one i i preached at a church a few years ago down south built a brand new beautiful log cabin church where they stand today they've left the message today beautiful i mean their logo on their website is that log cabin church beautiful and just a few years after that leave the message it's quite quite striking what big numbers will do and remember we've been told here in the name of the lord god's protecting us by keeping us small i believe that is a protection praise god because we see in the scripture not not every case but in this case particular remember brother adam likens this story of gideon unto the rapture the man likens it under the rapture because it's a it's a thinning down like like the statue of a man it's a smaller group all the time smaller smaller smaller but god's going to do something great with this small group amen praise god the undefeatable enemy will be defeated by a small minority of holy ghost-filled believers amen hallelujah praise god amen church is too big too much pride in the church i've gotta i gotta slim down the church now let's review this real quick so far three times gideon had fear judges 6 15 and he said oh my lord where wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house so here's fear how am i going to do this judges 6 23 he has fear again and the lord sent him peace be unto you fear not thou shalt not die he was scared of his life scared scared he was going to die and then judges 6 27 then gideon took 10 men of the servants and did as the lord had sent to him and it was so because he feared us he feared his father's household and that he did it by night fear constant fear of church isn't that what we do i remember when i first started youtube brother i was so afraid of the comments i was a i told my wife that i afraid they were going to like you know cut off my channel all these things and i was i was scared i was going to fend message people you know but i found out you can't offend the real holy ghost-filled saint praise god they might disagree with you but they're still going to love you amen that's what i found out praise god you just stand for the truth and god will stand with you amen you might stand alone but he shall be standing in the word in obedience in faith hallelujah so much fear sometimes there's fear to pray for the sick there's sometimes fear to uh which direction should i go in my life should i do this should i call this preacher or not you know we battle fear it's fear all the time so what's going to take that away communion with god talking with god asking god to guide me and direct me because i don't i don't even have i mean i have no ability to myself i need the leadership of the holy spirit praise god in other words what do you need humility because pride will always vault vaulteth the bible said vaunt is excel itself up it'll always puff itself up look how great i am and god's got to get all the pride out of the church god's got to get all the pride out and then god steps in and does something for his glory yes gideon was a man of faith he battled fear but he eventually overcame fear and next time lord willing will look at this preparation for battle gideon's got one more moment of fear left think about this he's heard from god over let's see seven eight nine ten times he's already heard from god church he's he heard audible voices he saw literal angels and yet he still battled fear do you think you're going to battle fear yeah but do you think the same god that was with gideon is with you yes because there's only one god he's the same yesterday today and forever aren't you glad god is with you musicians can come let's stand to our feet many great lessons in the life of gideon there's nothing wrong with asking god for a sign nothing but just make sure your heart's right first before you ask it make sure it's god's will first to go this direction and be willing to say lord if it's not your will that's fine i want god's will above all else hallelujah you know this would be a good night churches we're closing in prayer here let's pray for a need on your heart gideon was called to defeat this enemy what do you feel god calling you to do what do you need an answer from god on what would help you serve god better what would help you have more courage as a christian lord give me a sign if i just had this sign i could get more courage definitely something to consider something we should pray about here tonight let's bow our heads here lord we want to thank you god for this portion of scripture lord it's just a beautiful story dear god this hewer this cutter this man who is least in his house lord you're exalting him to the lead lord many of us can relate to this we're maybe not the funniest person in our family maybe not the best looking one [Music] maybe not the most popular not the most gifted [Music] lord each one of us want to feel like we're called to overcome we want to know what you are calling us to overcome we want to know what what is our testimony that you want to use on the day of judgment that you want to use to be glorified in what is the crown you want us to chase dear god as lord jesus you told us in the church ages overcome that no man take your crown hallelujah show us lord each one of us what is our midi night army we've got to overcome lord we all want to be in the hall of fame of faith dear god hallelujah thank you jesus we all want faith lord that can be a testimony of your grace or

because lord it involves your perfect will for our lives [Music] lord my burden is for this community lord i want to see soul saved in this community i don't see lives change lord god i want to see miracles lord god i want to see the names that are on the lamb's book of life i want to see those lives come forward and accept your word and love jesus christ with all their hearts soul mind and strength so lord as we're seeking your perfect will lord in those moments when we need our fear to be conquered i just pray god we'd be led by your spirit into prayer into communion with you so lord you can dissolve all doubts amen hallelujah dissolve all doubts in our lives lord god now we're going the right direction dear god that we can conquer with your leadership we can't overcome with your signs in our lives through prayer and through seeking the face of god through cleaning up our lives cleaning up our homes lord god hallelujah and declaring war lord by the spirit of god upon us lord we can do the perfect will of god and not be permissive like the foolish virgin but do the perfect will of god [Music] and lord we have this great confidence just like you did with gideon you brought him to the place of his destiny so will you bring us to the place of our destiny our purpose on this life our purpose in this world you'll bring us to it and you'll help us each stage where we battle fear each season where we battle uncertainty as we said with y2k and the blood moons in the 2020 election and now this war men's hearts are failing for fear lord we ask for communion with you lord jesus may we talk with you and we talk it over and we pray and seek your face empowered by your holy spirit direct our lives direct our paths forward in jesus christ's name saint said [Music] to amen

it's going to take sacrifice it's going to take more communion to know him more how many willing to do that by god's grace hallelujah brother ram said the mystery of god's will he says is a thing each person must seek out for their life he said it's a major thing each person to know the will of god for their lives praise god you'll never go against the will of god the word of god thank the lord for his revelation of this hour hallelujah i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love love till [Music] foreign [Music] yes jesus [Music] and he won't let me go jesus got into my heart he got into my soul [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's like you gotta hold a gideon's life [Music] [Laughter] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music]

bow our heads as we're dismissed here tonight heavenly father we're always blessed by your word or he's blessed to be in your presence lord i'm so glad you got a hold of my life and you won't let me go hallelujah you're going to help me through my fears help me through my doubts the lord the devil knows how to place him out there but we're more than conquerors through christ who strengthens us thank you for the word of grace tonight thank you for the word of faith tonight lord god raising our faith giving us confidence in your word lord god hallelujah knowing that when you've called us to something you will make a way for us to do what you called us to do we'll accomplish your purpose in our lives by trusting in you and your spirit will cast out all fear out of our lives [Music] and when the battle's over we shall wear crown in the new jerusalem thank you lord lord help us to always remember we can't do anything without you thank you for the blood of jesus christ may we never get
