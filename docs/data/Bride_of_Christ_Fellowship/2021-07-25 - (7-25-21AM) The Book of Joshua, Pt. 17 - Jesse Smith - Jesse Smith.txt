========================================

thank the lord for inspiring our brother to sing those songs praise god one day at a time just get the victory today church you know don't have to worry about tomorrow thank god we don't worry about yesterday we can't let the past bother us right we gotta we're gonna be concerned about today get the victory today by the grace of god let's go to joshua chapter 11. by the grace of god i'd like to continue on this thought there's just been some just some beautiful thoughts as i've read through these chapters i've listened to different sermons about it as well and just looking forward to getting to some of these thoughts i think they'll be a real help to you a real blessing to you today we'll look at uh joshua as he goes to the northern part of canaan's land there to get these great victories joshua 11 verses 4 5 and 6. i trust you're seeing yourself as joshua as the invincible army possessing the promised land praise god i trust you're seeing yourself is that i'm seeing myself as that and i want to uh glorify god and in every trial i want to uh overcome by the word of god and the blood of jesus christ right the word of our testimony and we just want to see ourselves as soldiers taking this ground you know we don't have to we don't have to take the whole ground praise god right we have to we don't we don't we don't have to do everything in the world right meet every need but we do have to possess our ground praise god what god has put us under responsibility for we want to see what has god made me responsible for and then lord help me to possess the promises help me to be faithful right in establishing what you want to establish in my life praise god so joshua 11. now i'll read uh i'll let me read 4 5 6 and then we'll read 15 together the main thought about this chapter is joshua left nothing undone you'll see church though that the other one the other israelites they did some they had some things they left undone but joshua didn't joshua himself was faithful in all that the word asked him to do praise god and that's how we want to be we want to be the joshua where we're faithful in everything we didn't leave anything undone right we didn't let anything linger in the past and we didn't we didn't leave anything unconfessed no no we took care of everything everything's under the blood praise god christ has conquered everything in my life praise god joshua 11 here let me read 4 5 6 and they went out they and all their hosts with them much people even as a sand that is upon the seashore in multitude with horses and chariots very many and when all the kings were met together they came and pitched together at the waters of maram which means high place the waters of the high place to fight against israel and the lord said unto joshua that's jehovah see that capital l-o-r-d that's the self-existent one who reveals himself and the self-existent one who reveals himself said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for tomorrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel thou shalt hoe their horses and burn their chariots with fire okay now go down to verse 15 let's read 15 together because this is how this is how the the writer describes joshua's ministry let's read verse 15 together ready one two three as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses amen now we're not done let's go to jeremiah 29 we want to read our memory verse from sister hua beautiful beautiful verses here jeremiah 29 11. it's good to see you by the mj this morning appreciate you pressing out to the house of god brother and i shared your thanks to brother bang as well so god bless you sir good to see you brother god bless you jeremiah 29 11 12 and 13. thank god that he has good thoughts toward us praise god church if not if not god would be hardening your heart towards the gospel maybe we'll get to that later this morning but if your heart is tender towards jesus christ you and i ought to be the happiest people in this earth because remember pharaoh and other all these other ones he always hardened their heart against god god heart of their own hearts because he knew that they wanted hard hearts he knew they wouldn't obey moses right he knew pharaoh wouldn't or submit to moses so he had to harden his heart so that god could get glory in those hard-hearted people right god hardens the hearts of those that deny the word of god but he softens the hearts of all those that love the word of god i'm thankful for a soft heart today church i'm thankful that god can still speak to me god changed my heart there's anything wrong against you god i want to obey all of it i'm not going to be like pharaoh and fight against it i'm not going to fight against it i just want all your grace i just want to obey all your commands lord keep me tender to the holy spirit i don't want to resist him i want to welcome him praise god i want to let him flow through my life it's a beautiful thought man this this bible it just keeps opening like we're talking about william last week it just keeps opening all the time it's just it's so much more beautiful and clear all the time verse 11 let's read 11 12 and 13 1 2 3 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart praise god look at 14 though and i'll be found of you save the lord how many want to find the lord amen see church he's always near to us right but there's times he hides himself because he wants you to seek after him he could just come out and solve all your problems right but sometimes he'll hide himself because he wants to feel that you love him and he wants to feel that right he wants to feel you he wants you to be an overcomer he wants you to be more than a conqueror he wants to see you take the faith that you have in your heart and use it and glorify him and seek after him and surely he'll be found of you that's our head's here one more time let's have a word of prayer heavenly father we read your word thank you for this eternal a revealed word lord god it keeps unfolding to us we thank you god this is our spiritual food you said your words are spirit and they are light so let the holy spirit come and speak life to us today may we feel the life of god lord ministering to us empowering us strengthening us today god for your glory we love you god we thank you for this beautiful word that you've given to us oh god and the songs we sung god we thank you for this fellowship may your spirit have free course here today have preeminence lord speak to every single heart minister to every need heal those that are sick i pray and god may you be glorified in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless yours being seated praise god just trusting the holy spirit to speak to us today and uh minister all of our needs i have a few slides i don't have a whole lot um but i just got a few let's look at this stuff you can switch over uh joshua left nothing undone and in church as i've read through this and uh listened to different sermons and studied a little gone through commentaries and and trying to read and understand this chapter it becomes more real to us that we are in the same uh situation as joshua except in a spiritual light praise god we're not trying to i'm not trying to defeat anybody so i can have my home in doyle's town at least not yet right we don't know what the speech is going to be like we don't know i mean there's wars and hopefully we never have to do anything like that but our battle is a spiritual battle and we are driving out spiritual wickedness in high places there it is high places the waters of moher that's what it means high places and so it's it's never been more clear to me and hopefully you that we are going to be facing uh enemies without and within right but but each time it's a spiritual enemy and each time we're given dominion over them and we can't let them defeat our faith we've got to use the faith and revelation that we have in fact jesus promised us the gates of hell will not prevail against your revelation as long as you have that revelation it's not head knowledge now but it's something that god has deposited into your soul amen as long as it's something deposited into your soul then the hell cannot prevail against you because you won't disobey god you won't throw god's word aside like adam and eve you won't come from out behind the protection of the word you'll stay behind the word the word will be your shield the word will be your protection and satan can't touch you if you're hid behind the word of god amen now we read our texts here and uh i just want to show there's some the types of this now this is in the book you'll see it in the book it's figure 11 in the book when you get it hopefully next week by god's grace i may deliver them to you this week i just may drive to your house and drop them off that's how bad i want to see those i've been waiting two and a half years for this time i ordered on amazon send me a copy i just want to see it uh but church this is in the book too there's three stages to our christian walk right and this is a reminder for most of us but the first thing is god justifies you by faith when you get saved he declares that you're righteous in other words you you repented of your sins you've been forgiven and in israel this happened when they exited egypt and crossed the waters right and so for us in the new testament we repent of our sins and we get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ uh the catholic church changed the baptism to father son holy ghost and now they even sprinkle most times they don't even really baptize in in immersion in water but see we baptized the way the bible said jesus said father the name of the father holy ghost ten days later pete he opened peter's understanding and he baptized the name of jesus christ okay so that's what this represents so when we got baptized it's it's as if we passed through the red sea praise god and we came out dancing and shouted if you ever were happy it would have been that moment praise god right because you are no longer a slave in egypt you're a free son and daughter of the king amen you've been set free from the bondage of sin and now all those task masters are drowned in the sea your past is totally forgiven in the sea and now you're looking ahead to a new life thank god but then you know they went through the wilderness which represents our sanctification now this is this is in the greek it means you're purified in your heart and life so in other words you need your mind purified so you don't think so much evil things and life means you start obeying the word of god okay so first you get saved thank god you get saved but now god has to work on you through constant tests and trials to help you overcome many major sins okay and that that's in the bible so get your bible first corinthians six we've gone over this many times but i want you to see it first corinthians 6 9. in other words god is trying to get into your soul he's got into your mind and your heart you know your feelings your affections you repented you love god but he's got to sanctify your heart and your life now look at first corinthians 6 9. now he just got done talking about defrauding your brother and and doing wrong to your brethren and suing someone which was awful you know we never should sue anybody that's a christian right uh verse 9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god remember jesus said the kingdom of god is within you right kingdom means rule or dominion the rule of the holy ghost jesus says should be within you so see these these sins if people keep living in these sins they will not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived verse nine neither fornicators so people having sex before marriage they can't be born again they can't enter canaan as long as they're having sex before marriage right nor idolaters as long as they're worshiping idol american idol or netflix idols or basketball idols football idols they cannot be born again nor doctors you know living with a second wife or a third wife or second husband or third husband they cannot be born again effeminate means having a young child that they abuse that's child molesters child molesters do are cannot be born again paul says you can't be because you're not purified you're not sanctified god won't come and live in you if you're allowing evil like that in your life that's the people like that belong in jail nor abusers of themselves with mankind that's homosexuality verse 10 nor thieves so even if people are stealing still all the time they are not born again it's impossible see if you've got god inside of you he'll check you and say don't take that that's not yours that doesn't belong to you see nor covetous see desiring other people's things nor drunkards that could be you know husbands and wives too right like the ten commandments say nor drunk or someone getting drunk cannot be born again because they don't want to be filled with the holy ghost they'd rather be filled with wine but see we want to be filled with the holy ghost amen we want the new wine praise god of the holy ghost god fill me with that praise god i'll i'll still act drunk though hallelujah i still act happy and crazy it might seem like crazy to the world but it's enthusiasm it's love for god it's joy unspeakable and full of glory and the world knows nothing about that praise god they don't know anything about that because they've never been washed by the fountain right of living waters see now revilers those are evil speaking words so when people do this reviling on facebook or uh instagram or whatever when they revile and tear down people shows they're not born again right nor extortioners that's making up schemes to make money right shall inherit the kingdom of god these people cannot be born again if they keep living like this verse 11 and such were some of you but you are washed but you are sanctified you're justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god see we used to we all used to do some of those things right but god has washed us in the blood we've been washed we've come out of that we got cleaned out and now we're not filled with those evil sins we're filled with god's holiness and that's what makes us different in the new testament in the old testament they can met they they were under the blood of bulls and goats and there was always a remembrance of all their sin that's been that means they kept doing those sins right they they kept doing it unless they were really dedicated like joseph but here in the new testament the blood of jesus christ purges our conscience it makes you forget many times you were a sinner and it makes your mind fully consumed on the things of god because christ is in your soul okay now look at uh now here's verse 12. this this helped me quit this helped me to quit tobacco all things are unlocked i'm sorry all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient or helpful beneficial all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any so every addiction church we can point to this scripture and say these things might might be lawful they might be uh uh we might be allowed to do them by the american laws but i am more concerned about the laws of god amen i don't want the power of satan abiding over me or ruling over me i want to be under the power of god amen and that's how we must live like joshua he was he refused to be brought under the power of any of those kings he refused to pay tribute to them he refused to give honor and respect to them he refused that he said i'm a conqueror god's given me this land i'm not leaving anything undone i i'm i'm possessing everything god gave to me charles may that be our testimony we'll possess every promise god has given to us amen remember our blessings are spiritual blessings right the bible said you've been blessed with all spiritual blessings in christ jesus so see we're going to have problems but we got to overcome the spirits that are trying to pull us down i hope that's clear now i want to show another way so see the way you the way you get purified is god gives you anointing he starts with the anointing of faith and then he gives you anointing of virtue and then it gives you anointing of knowledge and then tempers now temperance is the big one that's controlling your your bodily passions so that could be like uh sexual sins uh it could be lust of the eyes you know uh all these kind of things so this is dealing with your body when you get that anointing boy you're really getting power now amen because most people fall away right they fall away from god because they can't control their bodily passions but then you get patience with god you get another anointing of godliness you keep getting more brother ramsey it's like a little button but that said when you when you get saved it's like a little button of god's anointing and the more you feed that the bigger it grows amen and then i'll say like this it fills up in your mind and it pours over into your soul praise god i mean and once it forced into your soul it never leaves it's sealed in there hallelujah but then you got to keep taking care of this every day the mind that's where the battle is praise god see then it spills over you get the charity you get god's love down in your soul no matter when trials come you'll eventually come back to the spot where i love god i'm a real servant of god god forgive me if i made a mistake here i come i come back to you lord take my whole life consume my whole life uh renew my mind transform my mind amen renew me today because i need your grace today so it's all in there hopefully they'll find that hopefully people will find that a blessing i just want to review that in church let me go back there when i got baptized in lord jesus christ i instantly i i think i share that testimony i could no longer cuss it's like it's like the coal of fire had been taken off the altar and put on my lips i could no longer cuss it just instantly and and soon after that i started getting victory of all those temptations and those addictions there's something about that name praise god hallelujah that name above all names the name of the lord jesus christ every devil has to tremble at that name speak that name in faith and watch the enemies gotta move back praise god they might hang around for a little while but just keep speaking the word of god pretty soon uh they will flee the bible said they have to flee as you resist satan resist him with the name of jesus and i put that in the book church i went to church after church denomination predomination i never could get the victory because they didn't have the name they had fathers and holy ghosts those are titles but see eventually when the name came then i started experiencing the power of god because there's authority in a name the demons couldn't be moved because there's no authority to move them oh but when i repented and got saved and got filled or i got led by the holy spirit i started understanding the authority now i've been baptized in his name now he calls me his own because i took on his name amen and now his authority can move out anything contrary to his spirit and it can bring in the anointing of god the character of christ and make me more like christ now i just you know i was listening to a sermon yesterday and i just heard this a reference to the scripture i didn't hear the whole scripture but i just want to share this church our battles are within and without but the main battle is within for us right we're not we're not battling the military right yet i don't know i don't know if it ever comes down to that i don't know let's hope not but most of our battles are within us and so it's in our minds and and both john and paul taught the same thing that they were wretched with they were wretched men within their own humanity within their flesh but in their souls they were more than conquerors in christ so church we're gonna we have to be realistic we're gonna lose some battles but that doesn't mean we've lost the war joshua lost a couple battles right but see god helped him redeem it praise god god help them come back and get the victory amen see we're gonna battle and just because we lose one doesn't mean we quit or give up or question things am i even saved or no no no you confess it get it under the blood and now go now run out to the battle praise god go don't hide out from the battle don't be a saul be like david run out to the giant amen run out to the battle because you're going in the name of the lord amen hallelujah remember saul was hiding back and he was hiding among amongst the uh the baskets and everything like that where's our king where's our king he's hiding him somebody find him but david had a revelation that he was going to take that giant's head off so he ran out to meet the enemy now church that's what we need we need the anointing to face our our trial to face our enemy we need to get under god's anointing through prayer worship you know repentance however you got to do it you get under that anointing and that anointing will empower you god does not give a spirit of fear he doesn't run from the enemies he faces the enemies and he overcomes them hallelujah so this scripture came to my heart yesterday i need to look that up now look he's in second corinthians this is the church in corinth this was the church that had lots of gifts but not much character they were sanctified but many of them weren't filled with the holy ghost right they had a lot of supernatural but they needed some more character of christ now for when we were coming to macedonia right that's uh referring to uh the philippi near philippi our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears that church let me tell you he said we we paul was scared when people would persecute him paul was scared right if any of you ever ever been uh well i don't know about hopefully none of you have ever been arrested but if you have how many been pulled over i get scared every time i get pulled over it's been been about a year since i've been pulled over thank god for that i got a speeding ticket last year but i really get scared i don't want nothing to happen it's just a natural human reaction just because you're scared doesn't mean you're not saved just because you're scared doesn't mean god's not with you that's not what i mean it just means you're human if you get scared because look paul said he's scared but the bible said the fearful are going to burn the lake of fire paul didn't see paul didn't remain a slave to fear we're all going to have fear but then we got to overcome fear praise god right so if we if we get scared with something that's fine just say god i'm going to battle this and i'm going to bow this until i overcome this i in other words i will conquer fear fear will not dominate my life but i will dominate fear see paul church paul was fearful so inwardly he had fear he was fighting outwardly he had foes he was going against and so see we'll have both too we'll have people that'll mock us or make fun of us or threaten us outside but then we also have to battle the fear on the inside so we have a a a two-front war right malachi we have a war on two fronts now not all the time but sometimes and so we got to be able to overcome the fears that are outside and then the fears that are inside most the ones that are terrorized us most are the fears that are inside what are people going to think how am i going to do this what are they going to say who cares what anybody says we need to find out what god's word says about it praise god see and as i grow older i care less what people think of me right i used to be concerned what are they going to think well i don't care anymore what they think i i know what god's called me to do right i know where god's called me place me i see what he's put in my my my responsibility and i must be faithful with that i'm gonna get my eyes off of other people i'm only gonna look to jesus christ and please him and love everybody else praise god for the greatest gift we can have is love hallelujah nevertheless god now look now look how how does paul get comfort out of his fear god does what that comforted those that are cast down comforted us by the vision by the dream dreams are good visions are good by the coming of titus a young gentile preacher so paul's battling inside he's all fearful and outside he's got enemies and how does god god help me so what does god do he sends him titus praise god he sends a man who's got god inside of him and praise god so god steps down in a man named titus and he sends titus go comfort my servant paul he's battling fear i want you to be a strength to him church you realize just being around a holy ghost-filled saint is enough to comfort you and strengthen you in the midst of your trials you don't even have to have the answer to your trials just being around somebody who's got the pillar of fire inside of them it so helps you it so comforts you it so strengthens you it's as if god himself was right there comforting you amen hallelujah praise god the man been he'd been whipped five times with 39 stripes each time almost 200 times fearful who can help me god said i'm gonna this i mean i could come down in a pillar of fire i could shine as a great light like i did when he i saved him on the road damascus but this time i think i'll send him titus [Laughter] i'm going to send titus a pr a pastor oh to help the prophet look how god can use someone of lower rank amen that we would say lower rank or lower gifting god can use someone more humble than us or lower than us to encourage us in the lord first keep your eyes open god may use the children to encourage you sometimes keep your hearts open right god may use someone of seemingly lesser rank lesser privilege or lesser superiority or something in other words god will use somebody humble to deliver you from your fear and not by his coming only so paul says not just titus help me now that comfort means to take away fear it means to so paul got delivered through the comfort of fellowship see why we got a fellowship more church everything's just going to be better the more we fellowship praise god not by his coming only but by the consolation wherever he was comforted in you praise god so titus was comforted by the corinthians and that and when paul heard a word from titus and about the corinthians both of those testimonies work together to provide paul some comfort on this earth church i'm sure you've noticed by now this is not a very comfortable life living in laodicea it's not very comfortable there's problems there's bad news there's trouble on every side but god has special ways to bring you some comfort praise god just ask him praise god it might not come the way you want it but god is going to see the bible said he's the god of comfort amen he's the god of help he's the god of strength and and even if you're a prophet no matter how great you are how much revelation you might have we all we thank god for revelation but no matter how much we have god can always use someone humble uh to help us god if we're open to god that's undiscovered in unexpected ways but we've got to be trusted in god to do it and then receive the comfort that he does say when he told us your earnest desire for mourning your firmer mind toward me so i'll rejoice the more you remember this paul had rebuked the corinthian church in the first letter this is the second letter so paul gets word back from titus that the corinthians got his first letter and they repented of that man that man that was sleeping with his stepmom and that word from titus right and that word from titus titus brought to paul that brought a great comfort so not only just seeing titus's face he just wanted to see his face oh my brother titus i'm so comforted but not only that but also the news that the saints repented praise god amen church just news uh that you got healed will bless us all praise god just see any testimony that you have let's share it praise god because it ought to encourage us it comforts us to know all good news makes the saints feel good amen it brings comfort it gives god's a consolation it gives us evidence that god is with us amen like i shared that testimony bang out on wednesday i don't know if you heard it but amen asked me to give my testimony last year and put it on youtube so i did and then a sister from canada couldn't have a baby she watched it and she she said right after that she conceived and had a baby and then she uh she wanted to thank the church for putting that testimony up so see i probably would not have done that unless he would have kept asking me but see how god see how god used you brothers see and we all work together you know we all work together for that you know uh and see that encourages us god is that ought to comfort us praise god if god heard that prayer of that little woman over there in canada if god heard her prayer god will hear your prayer too god's gonna hear my prayer god will hear your prayer god cares amen he's going to bring comfort weight on him he's the holy one of israel he's the timeless one he's the one who's never late he's the one that's always on time trust in the almighty god hallelujah but yeah you're going to have fears without and fears within but you've got to pray for god's comfort and you'll get the victory praise god now i didn't think i'd spend this long on this but god knows what we have need of praise god i i've brother william i've tried to i quit trying to figure it out you know i used to think well i'm going to preach this long on this i just quit i'm just like that the holy spirit's going to take over right who am i i don't know nothing i'm i'm a ding-dong they'd say i'm i'm a nobody i'm a fool i'm a fool without christ with him i have nothing but with his leadership all things can be accomplished amen his will can be done if we yield to it praise the lord now look so see paul paul didn't go to hell he said i know i've got a crown of eternal life waiting for me but he battled fear see so only those that are addicted to fear only those that are addicted to murdering whoremongers liars idolaters sorcerers those are the ones that get punished but you and i don't get punished because we overcome that we discern the antichrist spirit in the midst of the church right we discern it and when we discern it we cast it out amen that's all the church has to do discern the two spirits in the framework of the church and if she does that and casts out the evil spirits she'll be an invincible army and that's what we've been for 15 years right man we've been a invincible army for 15 years yeah we lost a few battles i can i can tell you my mistakes i made a few mistakes here and there but i'm still fighting the devil i'm still here i'm still standing with the the armor of god on praise god let me get my sword out here i i got my feet shot i'm ready to do god's word i got my sword i got my revelation right i got everything i know i'm saved amen my mind's ready i got a uh i got the breastplate jesus's righteousness covers me i'm still standing i'm still fighting and i will not be defeated because jesus made me more than a conqueror amen i'm still fighting i'm still here you're still here so keep fighting the comfort's on the way praise god and the comforter's breaking the comfort amen i didn't know yeah i ain't going anywhere praise god i'm going to go fight for the devil i'm going to live for the devil i'm going to quit i'm here to stay praise god i'm in the land god gave me this land amen god gave me this position god gave me my wife and kids god gave us this church we're not moving back we're going forward hallelujah no devil in hell can move us back because we've got thus saith the lord we've got the word of jesus christ we've got the mind of god we've got the mind of christ amen we just got to forget our fearful thoughts right for forget our human minds and take on the mind of christ paul says i delight after the word of god in the inward man see yet he had fear on the inside too so see you can have fear on the inside but yeah happiness at the same time oh it's a multi-front battle but i see another law in my members warned against the law of my mind and bringing me into slavery let's all say slavery say paul was a slave sometimes yes paul he was free right as a free man but he was slave he was caught in traps of sin sometimes bringing me in the captivity to the law of sin which is in my members see paul sometimes fell short of the glory of god in this chapter he says i do things that i hate see there's sometimes he became a slave to the devil right and so do we sometimes we just surrender and say okay devil i can't fight anymore let me enjoy this sin right we all do it from time to time don't we so what does he say he said there's a part of me that's wretched oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the here's the problem the problem is the body that's my problem amen is this body god it ain't god it ain't the holy spirit it's this body this wretched body who shall deliver me say but thanks be to god jesus christ our lord with the mind i serve the law of god but with the flesh the law since he was thankful to god we're thankful for jesus christ our lord when we can serve his word when we can obey his word that brings us out of captivity and then we're free in our minds we're free in our minds when we repent of our sins we get our mind off the sin and we get started looking under jesus the author and finisher of our faith i've seen them brother man we've seen them we've seen them coming to church slaves and leave out free men leave leave out free men and women praise god we've all done it right we've all come in this church discouraged but then we leave out we're forgiven we're feeling blessed oh now i'm ready to go out there and battle the devil this week amen i'm ready for battle praise god out he had me slaver uh jesus broke the chain this morning amen i think because he's a chain breaker amen miracle worker promise keeper he's our light in the darkness amen amen but there's a part of us like i'm a wretched person but mj if you just see my life sometimes i'm a wretched person brother but thanks be to god who gives me the victory over this body hopefully as time goes on you see more of god than the wretched part of me right right you see because i'm growing in his anointing i'm growing in his character i'm being i'm learning how to yield to him praise god amen hallelujah i'm the light of god i'm going from glory to glory from faith to faith the light is shining more increasing onto a perfect day amen now look he just ends that chapter by saying oh wretched man that i am and then he says now there's no condemnation can you imagine telling amen brother amen i'm a wretched man but i have no condemnation how can a wretched man have no condemnation because your body's wretched amen the sin and your body is wretched but my soul there's no condemnation there's no claims against me in heaven i have a clean slate in heaven i'm forgiven the blood of jesus has washed away all my sin this body is wretched but i'm forgiven i'm justified amen heaven has nothing against me because jesus took my place amen you imagine say that brother i'm so wretched brother but i have no condemnation it's like it's a paradox the christian life is a paradox within our fears within uh is wretchedness within is hateful things but the soul has no condemnation the soul is totally perfect in the eyes of god because now i'm walking after the spirit and not the flesh church you realize that as soon as you turn down sin let's say it's a temptation to lie or it's a temptation to text somebody back with angry angry words as soon as you set down the phone or you turn it on and just start worship instead you are now walking in the holy spirit because if you would have disobeyed and done something sinful then you would have been walking the flesh church brothers as soon as you turn your eyes from looking at that sexy dress woman you're now walking the holy spirit amen it might not feel like it because that that evil guy on the inside right or there's a deal you can make a deal dishonest deal but as soon as you turn that down and say i'm not doing that i'm gonna just trust in the lord as soon as you do that you're walking in the holy spirit see we don't live by what we see we don't live by sight we walk by faith amen and even if the holy ghost isn't anointing my mind at that point i know by the revelation of the holy ghost that i'm walking in the spirit when i deny the lust of the flesh hallelujah whether i feel it or not i know i'm walking the holy ghost because i'm not walking in the flesh anymore for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death so before he's saying i'm so wretched who's going to deliver me from this and then he says i'm free from the law of sin and death he just said he was a slave to it and now a few verses a few breaths later he says i'm free from it see because he's living from a different place he now he's living from the soul now he's living from obedience to the holy spirit before he was he was uh doing things he shouldn't do he was doing sins and and and and falling short of the glory of god and oh my what a wretched person but now he said i don't have any condemnation i'm walking by the spirit church what uh what what uh what a rollercoaster ride our lives are can i say like that everybody said this is the hardest time of any age because of that because of all the pressures of this world this is the hardest age in able to overcome so if you're overcoming church you ought to be encouraged amen you ought to be shouting the victory praise god because this is the hardest age of deception and temptation and trials but here you are in the midst of satan's eden overcoming satan at every one of his tricks trusting in the blood of jesus christ and proving in this world that jesus christ is alive his spirit's inside of me when i turn down the flesh i'm walking the holy spirit and everybody can see i'm walking by the spirit i'm a new i'm a new creature in christ jesus i'm a god man i'm a jesus man i love jesus and i'm not walking of the things of the flesh i'm walking after the things of the spirit it's beautiful i mean this is so beautiful now look what john says john says if you confess your sins god is faithful to forgive you how many can say amen to that church you just got to confess and say jesus i'm the guilty one forgive me and then forgive me and then he'll forgive you and he cleanses you from all the unrighteousness now if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us my little children these things i write unto you that you sin not if any man sin we have an advocate that's a legal counselor a lawyer with the father jesus christ the righteous well i like my chances in court brother william if jesus is my lawyer and god's the judge because the father and the son are one amen these three are one i sure like my chances if i got the holy ghost in me and jesus is my aunt my lawyer and the father's on the on the throne i sure like my chances praise god we're gonna win the case we're gonna be forgiven he's gonna declare us justified never did it in the first place so you don't got to argue anything you just got to say lawyer will you forgive me i confess my sin i'm wrong yes i forgive you and i cleanse you from all righteousness judge please uh there's no evidence against my defendant and the judge say he's free you get that gavel he said he's free go and sin no more amen that's what he told the woman god adultery go and sin no more praise god he said i'm writing you these things that you sin not that you walk in the spirit and overcome that battle within those fears within those doubts within that stress within i'm writing to you that you don't owe obey that but you obey the holy spirit and walk in the spirit the same guy that says you sin just like paul same guy says this he that committed sinners of the devil the devil said from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil that's who you are if he was born to do that so are you then the bible say you're supposed to cast down anything that is exalted itself what is cast down throw down to pitch down to really now if i cast this down what'd you expect me to do like that what would you expect i'm casting that down well the bible says we're supposed to cast down anything against the word of god by the power of god if jesus came to destroy the works of the devil then so we must destroy the works of the devil as well but we just got to cast it down we got to stand there and be able to overcome was that a good illustration of casting down hopefully there's no tears here you know anyways it was given to me so i thank the lord for that i haven't bought a suit in like 10 years thank the lord so the same man that says this whosoever is born of god does not commit sin he just said if you say you have no sin you're a liar josh are you with me and then he says if you're born of god you do not commit sin for his seed remains in him for he cannot sin because he's born to god the same man said you're a liar if you say you don't sin and then he says if you if you're born again you cannot sin it's just like paul right just like paul i'm a wretched man i got no condemnation and i sin sometimes i never sin i didn't tell you look at god he's trying to teach us here to live from the inside praise god to live from the nature that's inside of us the holy nature of god acknowledge you make mistakes but also acknowledge that god seed cannot sin you've probably seen me do it i'm sure you've seen other people do it at the pulpit we'll feel so bad for something we did and then just a few seconds later we're shout rejoicing and giving god the glory why is that because part of me is a sinning part but the other part of me can never sin and i love to see the part that cannot sing i love to see myself overcome sin see this is how we're manifested or this is how we appear in this the children of god are manifested or appear and the children of the devil because he always know them because they disobey the word of god whosoever doth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother see church there should be nobody in this church that you cannot love some are going to be harder to talk to than others i'm probably hard to talk to sometimes sometimes in my mind i'm tired worn out sometimes i'm battling but we should still be able to love one another right help them out pray for them i try to encourage them in the lord see this is how this is this is how we appear we love each other praise god that's what makes jesus disciples different from other ones he said you'll know my they're my disciples because they love one another they love one another all right now now we'll finally get to joshua boy that was really something there probably that's a little bit of introduction there my god because i'll say a little review give me 30 more minutes by god's grace i'm sweating having a good old time here today i'd love to be on jesus side praise god now here look at church some of the battles now we're already in chapter 11. in chapters 6 through 10 the lord jehovah led israel into the victory in the central and southern part of canaan it was interesting they you know here down here in egypt they have to travel up instead of going right in there they go up and around because of their unbelief they've got to go up and around to jordan cross jordan and god doesn't take them in from the south or the north god takes them from right in the center in other words god directs you right to the heart of the battle praise god the bible said you got to uproot every root of bitterness god don't take you to the uh the top of the plant he takes you to the root of the plant the cause of the problem amen church see god takes them to the very heart of the battle the greatest cities he takes them first just like jesus right when he got the holy ghost he went out there in the wilderness he took on the greatest enemy for satan and if he then he had confidence if i can defeat satan of course he knew he would but you know for us if i can defeat satan then i can defeat the rest of them as long as i obey the word of god then i'll be more than a conqueror church some of your greatest battles come right after you're born again and that's to build up your confidence that my if god gave me victory over that if god gave me victory over that then i'm on the way to many many victories i cannot be stopped if god is for me who can be against me hallelujah if god is with me if god's fighting for me who's going to defeat god nobody can defeat god because he's the great warrior he's the man of war either he's the mighty conqueror he's the one that we we we cling to his power we trust in his power and he'll never fail the church as long as we obey the word of god see when you get born again he brings you right in the very thick of the battle and he shows you you can be an overcomer in the very middle of all all hell breaking loose all trouble breaking loose all problems breaking loose he can make you more than a conqueror in the very midst of it other people fall away other people wouldn't venture i wouldn't venture to go there i don't think i'd ever try that like like the like when i left the chapel they were telling me oh i could never stop going to movies that's what they told me i i how could you do that how could you stop watching sports jesse see they couldn't imagine overcoming that enemy and getting the victory in that battle see they they couldn't handle that battle right i don't know how you could ever stop smoking i don't know how you ever could stop chewing tobacco i don't know how you can ever stop to see they don't even understand the battle church but see god leads us into the battle we don't fear the enemy because god sent us and he gave us a word he gave us the word he said only be strong and very courageous as i was with moses so will i be with you praise god he said just be strong courageous meditate on the word of god you'll have strength for the battle that's how you know someone's really born again they can be thrown in the very thick of things and they're going to overcome somehow they're not going to abandon the battle they're not going to quit coming to church they're not going to quit reading their bible they're going to stand there until god delivers them praise god they're going to stand there like a warrior they're going to stand there like they got faith amen they're going to stand there like they've got big muscles and hair on their chest if they're a man they're going to stand there as a real soldier obedient knowing that god is going to back them up hallelujah i just thought it was interesting he takes him in the very heart of the battle right just like the garden of eden where was the battle right the very center of the midst of the garden see that where was about so eve she let down her word in the very midst of the battle the very the hotness of the battle right the very intense part see that's where she fell but we overcome because now we're in the very midst of satan's eden the most deceptive time there ever was right the most wicked time never was here we are in the midst of this and we've got to overcome right in the in the middle of it and we're in america too where it's rich and increased with goods have needed nothing we're in the very thick of it and god is asking us to stand how are we going to stand he's asking us to stand in the midst of uh satan's eden the the beast out of the land from revelation 13 to stand against that beast see because we got a greater anointing they have the beast anointing right the satanic antichrist anointing but we got the flying eagle anointing amen it depends what you're anointed with praise god as long as you got that flying ego anointing you don't fear the enemy you fly above the enemy he can't touch you because you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus but i like that that's how i knew by the way all these denominational friends that's how i knew they couldn't understand how i could overcome the battles but god was with me he was calling me to a higher calling praise god how could you have your your wife dressed like that how could she ever quit wearing makeup how could you not get tattoos how how could you uh uh not go to parties and how could you do all these things because i fear god that's why and you fear god you hate evil because i met god amen god met me god introduced himself to me and just like the burning bush god sent me with his word amen like he did moses amen how could i deny the very one who sent me and save me and call me praise god see so now here if you look at the map this is what i showed you last time when they first came in they got jericho ai the gibeonites members surrendered they were hivites and then all these five gathered against joshua in joshua chapter 10. and joshua did the surprise attack remember that he did the surprise he ambushed him i'm sorry that was ai uh with that one that's when he said son stand still he need a little more time to kill all these devils out of his life so he said he said son stand still brother bram said the earth stood still and the sunlight kept coming the earth stood still never was a day like it before so now god is directing them now they've defeated the southern enemy now god is directing them northward to the waters of maram which means high places so get your bible there joshua because joshua chapter 11. i've said it before i'll keep saying it joshua's one of the greatest books to help you learn how to be an overcomer always pray before battles right always obey all the word of god like jericho obey all of it pray before it like ai pray before every battle obey all the scripture everything you know how to do and god will bring the victory see we're more than conquerors in christ jesus now in verse one it came to pass when jabin king of hazel heard that those things that he sent to jobab king of maddon and the king of shimron the king of atshaf now he calls all these other kings together they don't list them on there but i think there's five other kings of before the kings and they're not mistaken now look at verse 4 church and they went out and they all their hosts with them much people even as the sand that is upon the seashore and multitude with horses and chariots very many church how many horses did israel have zero how many chariots did israel have to defend themselves against the chariots of of these five kings here chariots were considered the greatest weapon in those days because you got speed and you got iron and you got speed horses so these enemies have all the power of man i hope you heard me praise god they had all the power of man was against god's people he's got these humble little wars they probably don't have matching you know outfits right they they all had matching outfits they've been there for 400 years 450 years those kingdoms have built themselves up they were organized strong iron chariots everything screamed out were greater than you we're greater than you and they look out there or they must have looked out there and they've seen the whole all the land covered in soldiers everywhere you look as soldiers kind of like in the wintertime all you look all you see is snow everywhere you go right or today like or like this week all you see is rain there's so much sweat everywhere bloody they look out all they see is warriors you think god was scared up there in heaven you think god was shaking his boots oh all these devils are gathered against me god seated on his throne the ancient days he's like i've already been here in my mind i saw this before the foundation of the world and i'm going to make joshua the conqueror amen i'm with you joshua i'm not scared of them they're all they got demon powers but i've got the greater power i'm with you son don't fear them i don't care i don't care how big they are if they're as big as the sand of the sea don't be afraid of them i'm with you that's one thing to say that but it's another thing to speak it praise god verse 5 says they all came to the waters of maram which is high places and they fight there they're there to fight verse six now look what god tells joshua before he goes now church this is the one of the greatest helps we can ever do before we go into any battle i've said this before any meeting any phone call anything before we go into it we should pray god give me your spirit of power take the fear away from me i prayed that i felt good but inside i was still shaken but i knew i had the power of god on me i felt that numerous times right like paul said fear is within right you got fears within but in your soul your soul is anointed with the power of god so as the lord say to joshua be not afraid because of them for tomorrow about this time i will deliver them all up slain before the israel look god tells him i'm with you don't be afraid and he tells them when the victory is going to happen tomorrow you just got to get through this in one day you just got to get through it one day now for us it's always gonna it's usually gonna be soon i'm gonna get you through this soon right because we're not prophets and like joshua's a prophet he spoke uh heard saw the visions of god talk with god he met the the captain of the lord's host you know but see we got to have confidence that god is with us and that his word is faithful his word is steadfast nothing can move god nothing can move god's word god's word will stand hallelujah forever it's settled in heaven amen don't be afraid because of your enemy he said by tomorrow i'll deliver them all up slain now look now look what he says here i heard a preacher say that's really good thou shalt who their horses now that means cut their uh their hamstrings so they can't run fast now they'll still be alive but then you won't be afraid of them like they're gonna trample you down nobody's gonna chase you down we're gonna cut their hamstrings and burn their chariots isn't that something god says don't be afraid by this time tomorrow and then here's what you do with their armies burn them burn their cherries verse seven so joshua came all the people with a war with him and they come up suddenly now here like imagine church this is the title they're at gilgal a tiny little army can you imagine they're leaping over mountains and running up and they and then all of a sudden they surprise this big huge army a tiny little ambush of men come against this mighty army but they come suddenly they get a a quick a quick attack a surprise attack this tiny little army surprises the big army and instantly starts slaying them they just they just flow in there like a like a tiny uh like a missile or something like that like a little bullet they just fly up there and just start taking them out and it causes them all to flee a sudden attack from a tiny little army and the lord deliver them into the hand of israel smote them chase them down so this little tiny army starts chasing down all these thousands upon thousands and thousands of men finishing verse 8 they smote them until they left none remaining and joshua to them as the lord bait him he hold their horses and burn their chariots that is so significant church if you were an army and you defeated an army and you saw all their chariots were there what would you do with the chariots i'd probably take them right that's just going to make me stronger but that's what the world would think the world would say oh use their chariots uh you you need the you need the power of the enemy in order to be stronger you need to be like them your army needs to be just like the world that's a lie from hell your churches need to be just like this other church that's a lie from hell we need to be just like the book of acts church amen we have to be a denominational and all that non-denomination we don't we don't look to anybody else we don't look at anyone else's power we look at the power of christ so god said instead of taking those chairs now if you read the chapter they spoil everything else where's that scripture the bible said they spoil everything else yeah they utterly destroyed him in verse 11. killed all the kings in verse 12. yeah he killed hazer in verse 13. yeah in verse 14 all the spoiled these cities and the cattle the children of israel took they for praying on themselves why did they take the chariots and and the horses because god was showing them you are a different kind of army your power is not in man's devices don't try to have power of the enemy trust in my power hallelujah in other words the power of the enemy is never something that we're attracted to amen right the power of satan is never something we would ever be attracted to we're not trying to mimic satan's power we cast down any power of darkness amen any power that exalts itself against the word of god we cast it down we burn it up i don't want any power the enemy in my life whether it's playing politics or lying or stealing or trying to do these things i don't want any powers of the enemy i'm trusting in the power of god i'm a different kind of soldier i'm a different breed i'm a different kind of army i'm a god breed amen i will not copy off the world to try to have power my power comes from jesus amen the church that's why we don't build big denominations in big buildings right because there's no power in that it's powered for the world it's power for the enemy but it's not power for god's people praise god are you with me the power of god is holy power praise god hallelujah that's what we do the powers of darkness they did in the book of acts remember in the book of acts they went there and they got a church started there and the bible said they took those books of witchcraft and they burnt them right that was ephesus right that's what you do any power that comes outside of christ burn it up any influence any temptation anything that might give you this little advantage burn it up don't even let it tempt you just trust in the living god he brought you this far he's gonna take you on home amen his power brought you this far his power has been faithful his power will always remain faithful we don't take the power of darkness we live on the power of holiness destroy every man anything that was the breathing they destroyed verse 15 as we read that for our texts joshua did everything moses commanded and the bible said he enough unknown i'm about that testimony uh go to book of matthew here i'm looking it up listen brother can't preach a good message on when matthew 23 23 yeah what a rebuke this is the chapter that has the eight woes against the pharisees that's in the book it's in the uh mystery of iniquity chapter anyone who lives in iniquity deserves woes and rebukes right jesus gave him eight of them woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe and anas and cuman and have omitted the way to your matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these all you have to done and not to leave the other undone so see in other words they were real good at finances right they're real good at paying ties not so good at judging not so good at showing mercy but jesus christ said you need to be good at finances and you need to be good at showing mercy so don't leave anything undone right if something seems unfinished in your life church let's finish it finishing is always the hardest thing to do i love starting things but man i have a hard time finishing things but this book is taught these two books these two books have taught me patience it's finished it is finished it's taught me that i've got to keep pressing on until i finish something and jesus christ said you must do everything that we're called to do in the word but also do not ignore anything don't don't let there be places in your life that you're just not paying attention to right think about your life make sure make sure everything in your life is squared away right all your relationships makes sure relationships are right you sinned against anybody go talk to them right make sure your church life your church family everybody's teaching everybody good right your work make sure everything's good at work make sure everything's gonna work everything's squared away makes your finances are okay right everything's squared away he said don't leave anything undone how about feed the poor remember remember when peter and paul left they met the bible said they left and the last thing paul said he said keep the commands he said and don't forget the poor that's the last thing brother william a holy ghost-filled saint said don't forget the poor see that's one thing we forget sometimes let's remember the poor so you've got to make sure everything is taken care of i've been working on landscaping all summer i finally felt like yesterday i'm caught up now there's a couple areas that's undone but those really aren't my areas i would probably laugh if we talked about anything i got everything i got the weed eater out this week by the mj i was weed eating i was i was mowing i mowed it yesterday i i just feel like i kind of look i breathed yesterday i was like i better enjoy this i feel like i got everything caught up here the inside was all clean we cleaned you know on friday we had the naomi and the family over on friday and we cleaned it man it was like this is like the best i've ever seen it here it feels like everything's done dishes are done and that's what we have to have that desire for spiritual spiritual completion amen make sure everything is finished hallelujah make sure the poor taken care of make sure your family relationships are solid right make sure everything is taken care of that's what joshua did that's what we're gonna do church that's what we're gonna do everything will be taken care of all of our lives will be uh administered the word to the in other words the word is gonna reign over every area of our lives amen how did it get praise god the word has preeminence in every area of our lives see that's how you know a pharisee a pharisee only takes care of part of their lives right but the holy ghost don't say they take care of all them ah thank you jesus hallelujah leave nothing undone look at verse 18. so joshua takes all the land the bomb said and joshua made a law a war a long time with all those kings church you know how long this war was at least six or seven years now the battle we read today was just a short battle right they drove him out they chased him down and killed him but the next chapter shows 31 kings 31 kings i love it god names them by name in other words this devil that was defeated this devil was defeated that devil was defeated this one and this sickness and that and cancer i see all these things he names them one by one god is a god of lists i love it god he records all the names that were in all the 12 tribes of israel he knows whose father is who he knows whose daughter's who he knows all the overcomers he knows all the unbelievers and god has a list of all of our names thank god we're listed on the lamb's book of life thank god your name is there now live like it praise god and overcome the enemy in every one of those tricks the bible said god is not unrighteous to forget your labor of love in other words the bible said god makes a list right now of everybody who's talking about him and he rewards them there's a list going angels are taking record right now well this brother's saying amen the sisters saying amen this brother's overcoming that there's a list going on right now in heaven church hallelujah i want to be recorded praise god i want to have the testimony i was thinking about jesus glorifying jesus i was denying the flesh i was walking in the spirit praise god i was thinking about the things of god hallelujah testifying helping the saints encouraging them edifying and praying for them amen hallelujah not leaving anything undone praise god sometimes these wars last a long time oh my sometimes they last longer than we want but church if you're the joshua army you just keep going forward and you are going to get the victory it's been a long battle against this sickness it's been a long battle against that brother it's been a long battle against that church it's been a long battle against that spirit but i am going to get the victory but jesus christ is going to make me more than a conqueror in this situation joshua didn't quit after a little a short little battle he didn't come in there expecting well i'll just battle for a year and then then it's all that will rest no he came in there knowing i've got to drive out millions of people i've got many many enemies i've got to conquer i'm in this for the long haul and we'll get to the chapter 14 caleb was in this for the long haul hallelujah he was in it for the long haul his 85 year old man just as strong when he was 40. i'm 40 right now so i need to remember i need to figure out how much i can lift right now no that's just cardinal but that's the same idea as strong as he was at 40 at 85 he was the same strength the same power see how god keeps you strong see if you're faithful to god god will be faithful to you praise god in other words if you want to be strong if you want to keep the victory god's going to give you the victory amen if you want to be strong when you get older like brother william and like sister beatrice you will just be faithful just keep the commands just leave nothing undone hallelujah if you want to you can be strong even into your final days just leave nothing undone of all that the lord commands you to do verse 18 a long war verse 19 only the gibeonites made peace everybody else they killed for in that middle area that central southern and northern parts now look at verse 20 church look at this for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly that they might have no favor but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses you see church in other words the gibeonites wanted they had soft hearts to god see but all the people that hated god that hated holiness hated the holy ghost and all of the other people that hated moses and hated the prophet of god all of them that hate it god hardened them on purpose to bring them to judgment but anybody who wanted mercy god showed him mercy anyone who shows you mercy i believe god's going to show that mercy hallelujah because the gibeonites just were merciful they were humble they feared god and they were they were just kind right they didn't fight against israel and god had mercy on them i'm expecting some surprise on the day of judgment by the way i'm done good ones praise god if god was merciful to soft-hearted gibeonites god will be merciful soft part of people today people that won't speak against you they might not be with you they're not here but they don't speak against you and they know that you serve that you're a true christian god will be merciful to them i believe that with all my heart and you ought to do your part and say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing right just like jesus that's our example jesus said father forgive them they just don't know what they're doing and we know jesus or we know jesus prayer was heard by the father see god only hardens the hearts of those who will ultimately choose to fight against him god will not harden someone's heart if they want to be saved see now look at verse 22 now church this is interesting there was none of the anakins left in the land of the children of israel now americans were giants if you know your bible anakins were giants none of the giants were left in land only in gaza in gath in ashdod there remained huh what giant came out of gaff and he had four brothers see church i'm going to show this to you joshua did everything god told him to do and he was faithful with it but some of the other israeli warriors didn't do their part they didn't drive out the giants out of gas that's what happened later came to haunt them later when goliath rose up a few hundred years later right see church that's why it's so important when you come to christ surrender it all hallelujah say god take every selfish part of me out take every desire take anything that's contrary to you take it out of my life take all these giant obsessions and all these giant unbelief and all this giant lust and all this giant greed and all this giant doubt hallelujah all this giant fear take it all out of me take every enemy out of me that in the future i can have a better future to serve you amen because if you don't take care of it now it's gonna come back to haunt you maybe one day i'll tell you a story i think something i think recently in the past year something came back to haunt me that i didn't take care of now god has worked it out maybe i'll tell you that sometime in the future i thought my if i only would have taken care of this years ago i would not be suffering like i am now so see giants remain in gath and that's where goliath come out look at verse 23 so joshua took the whole land no that just means his portion church so i'm going to show you some scriptures there was a lot more left joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord had said unto moses see all the things moses said joshua did it and joshua gave it for inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested the war so they finally got rest after about seven six or seven years of war once they in that interesting seven if it would be seven years because every seven years you know the spotlight says something's supposed to happen in your life every seven years that's interesting i remember there were some good sevens when i did my life 35 going i'm coming up to one 42 i'm coming a couple years i'll be going on another one see this joshua took the whole land now church if you've got your bible skip ahead to chapter 13 verse 1. i'm going to prove to you church this only means joshua's portion he fulfilled not the rest of the saints now joshua's old and stricken in years see when you get older the bible says he strikes you with oldness he burdens you with oldness right and the lord said unto him thou art old and stricken in years i made you i made you old i made you tired right and there remains yet very much land to be possessed this is the land that yet remaineth now look up here church this is from my bible it's very hard to see i'm very sorry but here are some of the cities we're talking about there's jericho okay there's some of their northern this is the northern parts where they got the victory up here the waters of maram okay so the red is all that joshua took so when the bible said joshua took all the land that's all the land the green is what god says there's still more remaining i wish i could find gath down there there's gaza oh yeah there's gather right there that's goliath's hometown right there they got so close up to that where they just didn't drive out the enemies out of that place see so joshua does all that moses commands and then they get rest go to acts chapter 9 verse 31 i'm coming up on about an hour and a half here i appreciate your attention i know it's hard sometimes but i appreciate your attention acts 9 31. how many appreciate the word this morning god bless you then the gates of hell will not prevail against you if you receive the revelation of this the gates of hell cannot overcome you that's what jesus christ said i believe that with all my heart acts 9 31 then the churches had rest joshua had to rest after seven years oh you can have rest in the new testament it's okay for a church to have rest in the new testament see everybody always use that quote brother and says if you're not battling you're not a true church that's true sometimes just like they say every time you do missionary work it's up god not every time paul tried to go to asia and the holy spirit said i forbid you to go to asia see how people pick and choose whatever quotes they want and they don't balance out quotes by the word of god we must rightly divide the word of truth the bible said prove all things try every spirit so joshua could have rest but we can't no no the bible says we can have rest and then had the churches rest throughout all judea and galilee samara and we're edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort there's paul said i needed comfort i'm having all these inward fearful battles but god sent me titus to comfort me praise god and we're multiplied now church go to the verse before that how did they get rest well if you read the verse before that which when the brother knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent them forth to tarsus they got rest when paul came or became paul instead of saul so they got rest so they were persecuted for a little while brother amen but after the persecution god gave them rest and then they spent that time just being built up and edified instead of coming to church to be i wonder if paul's going to break or saul is going to break down the door instead of all the torment now they could come to church and just i'm coming here to be built up now i'm coming here to be comforted church me and i'm enjoying it right now i praise god we're enjoying the rest of the lord right now we don't have any battles within the church right now we're in a time of rest and we ought to be getting built up praise god we ought to be getting stronger how do we edify one another being comforted praise god but just a few years ago we didn't have rest i told this to people and they thought what i told you who was it the preacher came a few weeks ago he said you guys used to have battles i said yeah i said certain people in the church would sit back there and all service they'd be going like this to me all service i'm trying to like encourage people i'm trying to preach my heart out and i look out there and they're like i'm like why don't you just say amen or something like that and that happened for like two years now honestly church those times it was really hard to come to church i wasn't having rest you probably saw me actually longer at the altar right right and then god supernaturally through a prayer i went to that person's chair and i said in the name of jesus christ i rebuked this spirit what was it of uh this critical spirit and i commanded to leave in the name of jesus christ 11 days later they left brother three days later no the next day a preacher come in and the preacher said uh so and so back there they said whatever you're planning to do do it the holy spirit told me to do it and they left a few days later and since then i've just been so happy right i mean i don't have any none of you no this is good for you none of you look at me and angry with me now if you are let me know i'll say i'm sorry if i offended you but everybody's usually got smiles on their face thinking real deep like maybe praying see we we're at a season of rest right now as far as most of us who's persecuting you right now who's persecuting you who's threatening your life now right now nobody's calling me a devil nobody's persecuting me as far as i know but i've gone through seasons where i've had that persecuted from within persecuted from without right and then fears within fears within fears without but see after a while god you keep fighting praise god if you keep fighting if you keep slinging that sword this sword is gonna cut amen this sword is sharper than any double that sword praise god it's going to cut out your victory and then you're free and then you can rest amen like samson you can finally lay down the sword for a little bit and say it's time to drink now he laid down the jawbone it says time to drink i'm sorry you got the drama or the water on the jawbone uh and he drinks the water and he's refreshed for a season that's what we're in right now church you might not realize as much as i do because i you know sometimes i got to deal with it's okay then that's my job i got to deal with the problems of the church i sure been enjoying this rest this joshua wrestling had lately i just got to come to church hear people say amen come up for prayer i loved it last week four people come up for prayer i love that i love to see when the holy ghost is ministering to people's needs and to hear things brother amen bang we've never heard before the breach just to hear god whether we unveil things we've never even seen before oh what a way to be comforted oh god keep comforting us amen keep edifying us keep building us up into the wars you want us to be so when the next king comes when the next critical spirit comes or the next disease comes we'll stand like soldiers and we'll conquer them in jesus christ's name i'm feeling like going out to the battlefield in those churches i feel like taking the battle to them praise god it'll be a surprise attack we'll see what the lord does but you see god's given us great rest here everybody understand and remember the bible said a peaceful life pray that you can live peaceably yeah peace with all men the bible says that's right without holiness no man shall see the lord there's another one i'm thinking of too peace let me just look it up it's in timothy or thessalonians it's good acceptable on the side of our our savior there's a scripture like that bear with me here this one just came to me i didn't have time to look it up charity peace oh yeah first timothy two two there is pray for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty a church and because of that peace when that critical spirit left now i wrote the next book i had peace to write that next book now in church if that just saves one person it was worth it all god gave me a season of peace to write this full ex exposition on or full commentary on all the mysteries of god and i believe now church we're doing even more on our part to prophesy again to nations and kingdoms and peoples right we'll see what god does with it right but we got to do our part we've got to eat the book thank god well i've sure enjoyed it these last few years eating all the mysteries of god it's been delicious amen i'm stronger because of it praise god but now i don't let it stop there you must prophesy in i'm a prophesy again prophecies of the random games because right out of the bible right some sea church there are times of rest times of war now some of you like maybe going through wars and battles right now but most of them are wars within right and that's where you can still get the victory he says just look just pray for god's comfort just say god send me comfort to overcome send build me up so i can overcome this spirit he might see a dream he might send you a vision he might send you the perfect sermon or he might send you me just to say hi right he just might send me over to hug you or something like that and that may come brothers of course that may comfort you just to know somebody's with you someone's praying for you it can be just like that just to know that someone is thinking about you just to know that someone's praying for you that may be just the comfort that you needed i remember that one it was right after i heard the message brother william a couple of months after that the denominational brothers cornered me in the room and convinced me the message was wrong and i said okay that's right yeah that's probably wrong and all this i was i was convinced for one night i woke up the next morning i got a phone call from a message pastor craig booer and he said how's it going you still believe the message brother and i said yes and i so and i said i'm sorry last night i was convinced the pray to come out of it but i'm back in that phone call brought me back in i just been prayed out the night before you see they couldn't pull me out because they didn't put me in god put me in praise god hallelujah no man can pull you out if god put you in praise god but see how god used that word of comfort that word of encouragement and just that brother's that brother his brother craig bore that brother's testimony or influence in my life is beyond i can hardly explain how much that brothers encouraged me and yet we haven't spent that much time together but that one those few moments of comfort and edification have gone beyond anything the world could ever offer just like paul said god come for me by sending me god and flesh hallelujah god sent me a man when i needed comfort amen he sent me a good report a testimony from a church oh thank god they repent of their sins hallelujah thank god god gave that woman a baby thank god god healed brother johnny that thank god god heal brother bang and who is that you know thank god these things encourage us they strengthen us they build us up in the faith they make us stronger soldiers hallelujah i'm closing with chapter 12. and i'm going to close now i might even preach two hours this morning let's see i just feel it this morning i know why brothers i just feel it it's just a home folk here you know it's all of us you know akron saints here by god's grace well we love everybody but this is the home church here you know chapter 12. now verses 1 through 6 are moses's victories repeated but verses 7 through the end were joshua's victories of 31 kings defeated god puts a list in his bible because it proves he keeps his word i'm going to bring out the scripture let me go to luke 1 45 why does god put these unending seems like a list in here because god wants a record among men that god keeps his word god wants men to share with other men that god kept every single detail of his word god doesn't lie church amen god doesn't lie god doesn't deceive he doesn't give and take it back right god god doesn't lie if god says something if god promises you something god will bring it to pass so god says i'll go ahead and list all 31 devils joshua slew just so you're aware that when i give my word i back up my word hallelujah luke 1 45 and blessed is she that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which are told her from the lord see in other words god said here's 31 kings i told you they would fall and look at it i perform my promise i always keep my promise the devil can't stop me i'll keep my promise to you no matter how great it is no matter how extensive it is i'll keep every detail of it i care for my people i'm bringing my people in i'm blessing my people and god is gonna bless us amen keep his word meditate on his word day and night and god will start giving you a testimony of this and that and that and that and god did this all these things god is faithful to his word last scripture isaiah 6 verse 1 i think it's the last scripture brother tim and kimmy preached this years ago in that year the king of uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high lifted up and his train filled the temple a train is his skirt or robe like the kings like a woman wears when she gets married her veil that long veil is like a train right it expresses all of her purity all of her beauty right right it's just a sense of wow she's so pure she's so beautiful but god sits on his throne in heaven and isaiah said his his robe his skirt filled the whole temple it was so great can you imagine fold after fold after fold of this train can you imagine isaiah said i see the whole heavens filled with this train and brother tim showed us my history one time from the kings the kings would on their train they would put all the names of all the enemies they'd conquered and so god was showing isaiah look at all that i've conquered amen my train is so great i defeated 31 kings i defeated it for joshua i defeated all these kings from for moses i defeated all those kings for abraham i defeated all these kings no king can stand before me my uh my my glory goes before me my testimonies are great my word never fails you can trust in me praise god listen to our feet we can trust in the lord his train his testimonies of victory fill the temple so if they fill that temple shouldn't they fill our temple shouldn't they fill our lips you can stop the livestream musicians you can come
