TRANSCRIPT
========================================
look forward to that by the by the grace of God here. So, let's look at this thought here. The Lord awakenth in David's generation. I just was so inspired here. I felt like it was such a beautiful verse. You know, we know the Lord never slumbers nor sleeps. We're encouraged to remember that in the Bible. And you know, we know God allows us sometimes to go through testing times. We know God allowed Hezekiah to go through it where the Bible said God left Hezekiah for a season to try him. Now, we know the Bible says he'll never leave us nor forsake us. And that's true. He never will. But we see that there's times of testing where God will pull pull back his heavy anointing upon our lives and allow us to kind of maneuver life on our own a little bit without all of his help and influence. And in those moments, we kind of see as Hezekiah, we see what we're made out of. &gt;&gt; In other words, we see that we're flesh and dust. Hallelujah. Flesh and bone. And without God's constant powerful anointing, we'd all fall short of God's glory. &gt;&gt; We'd all make mistakes. We'd all do things that uh we wouldn't be proud of. We wouldn't want to tell our children about. &gt;&gt; We want to make mistakes. &gt;&gt; And so God did that uh in Hezekiah's life. He pulled off his anointing. Now, in the context here, it's speaking of in uh chapter 78, it's speaking of God dealing with Israel as they traveled uh through the wilderness out of Egypt all the way Egypt with Moses and then brought them into the promised land through Joshua. Hallelujah. And so, we're seeing this that uh God for some reason it was acting like he was sleeping. And in this context, we see it's because of the sins of the people. So very similar to what Hezekiah had happened there, God pulled himself back, right? And so Hezekiah w when he lost that great powerful anointing, he didn't wasn't living it daily in his life, we'd say he allowed the Babylon messengers to come in and check out all the vessels of the Lord. And that was a big mistake. Hallelujah. Because they'd make plans and they'd come back later to ransack the house of God. And Hezekiah repented of it. But see, it was uh Hezekiah's disobedience during that time. Uh and it seemed like God wasn't working. And that's exactly what happened here in the days of Israel here before that. Uh if we go back in Psalm 78:17, you'll see it just plainly here. I don't have time to read all this, but let's go back to verse 17. And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness. So God gives this picture here in his word of how the people kept sinning. You know they we know at least 10 times the Bible said they tempted the Lord in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Think about that after seeing so many miracles you know uh seeing the Red Sea part and then just days after that they would start doubting God. &gt;&gt; And church let's not get upset about them because we do the same thing. &gt;&gt; God will do a miracle. He'll provide there. He'll heal somebody. He'll do some great he'll make some great provision. And then a couple days later, we wonder, is God even in our lives? Right? Have we grieved the Lord? Have have we done something wrong? And so, we know our flesh is just like them, except we have more power. We have power to overcome sin, greater power, because we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul. Hallelujah. Just kind of building a background here. I'm sure you're from, as you can tell here, by God's grace. Verse 18. And they tempted God in their heart by asking me for their lust. Yay, they spake against God. They said, "Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?" Now, what a question. If God could open the Red Sea, couldn't he furnish some food in the wilderness? If God made the way for them to get on the wilderness, couldn't God provide for them in the wilderness? &gt;&gt; In other words, if God brought you to a journey, is God going to uh fail you on your journey? Of course not. &gt;&gt; If God brought you out, he's going to bring you through. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no reason to doubt, but we know God allows us to go through testing times where we can build our faith. Hallelujah. And we can allow God to strengthen us and give us uh greater testimonies and and strengthen our faith. Hallelujah. Learn how to serve God in a pleasing manner. Hallelujah. And then you know if you go to down to verse 60 78 60 it says and so that he forsook their tabernacle of Shiloh the tent which he placed among men and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy's hands. Now I got the wrong verse. It's verse 58. Look at verse 58. For they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. So God is rehearsing them. They doubted me in the wilderness. They spake against me in the wilderness. Then when I brought them into the land, they were faithful for a while, but then they started up building idols in their lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so we see this uh uh repeated pattern of Israel. And we see a pattern in our lives of uh sinning and then repenting and getting our first love back. We see that pattern in our lives. Of course, our sins won't be as as deep as theirs were because we've got greater power. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is power to be a witness unto Christ. Hallelujah. That's what it is is. It's more power in the soul of the believer. Hallelujah. Praise God. But we all know, you know, there's times we let things become more important than serving God. Maybe it's children's extracurricular activities. Maybe for our brothers, it's work gets more important than God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or maybe family relationships get more important than God. All kinds of things been can become between us and God. And God just testing us. God is proving us, right? He's proving our faith. He wants our faith to be more pure. Amen. For the pure in heart, they shall see God. &gt;&gt; God's molding us and shaping us. He's refining our faith. He's uh heating out and he's getting all the dross and the sin and unbelief out of our lives so that we can serve God with a pure heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many want to see God? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That should be our prayer today. God, give me a pure heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to see you. I don't want to see the tribulation. Hallelujah. I don't want to see the white throne judgment as far as me getting judged. I want to be seated on the throne with Jesus in judgment. Hallelujah. And if he wants to raise up me and uh to be a witness on that day like he's going to do the Queen of the South, like he's going to do Jonah and all these individuals. Uh if he's going to do that, then praise God. I want to just have a testimony that he helped me through that he awakened me in my generation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because that's what we see in David's generation. It's as if God awakened out of his sleep and showed himself strong on David's behalf. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we see in verse 58, idolatry. So look at this church. Speaking against God, idolatry, forsaking the tabernacle. That was the ark of the covenant. Remember, forsaking. And the and the ark of the covenant represents the presence of God. &gt;&gt; It represents uh uh they would go to the the yurum thumbum. Of course, that was the breastplate. They would go there to find God's will. Uh the high priest would go to the ark of the covenant. Remember we saw it on Wednesday. looked to preach on the ark of the the thrones of God on Wednesday. They would go there and talk to God because God said, "I'll meet with you there. &gt;&gt; I won't meet you anywhere else. I'll meet you above the mercy seat where the blood's been shed and the blood's been sprinkled." Hallelujah. Where God's mercy has been expressed to man. And so, the ark of God represents God's presence where God gives you his perfect will. And so, Israel had drawn away from that. In other words, they started living where I don't really care so much. I really don't have to seek God about this decision. I'll just do what I feel like I want to do. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. The decisions uh I'll say like this. The decisions of their lives, they weren't run by God and to see what God thinks about it. &gt;&gt; They just did what they wanted to do. &gt;&gt; And church, this I'll be probably emphasizing this more and more. In the biggest decisions of your life, really in every decision, but in the biggest decisions of your life, it's so important to have the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to not make a decision unless you know you've got the lights of the urum shining. Hallelujah. If you got the lights of the Bible shining and oh, I know that's right. I see God's anointing on that decision. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll say like this. If you're honest, you would have said, if it wasn't for God shining that, I would have made the wrong decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, you're thankful God showed up and gave you a vindication on the decision you were about to make. &gt;&gt; Glory. And so we see that the ark was captured. They lost the ability to find the perfect will of God for their lives. Hallelujah. And so this marked these were some of the marks upon this generation. And it really church it goes back to leadership really after Joshua died. We
