Jesus since Jesus says set me free I'm happy as hard I bear the burden of care is yoga so sweet to me thy Shore was as black as God the darkness as bacon now shot victory for Jesus hallelujah let's take our Bibles and stand here by God's grace let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 2 verse 1 I'm gonna keep going on this wisdom series by the grace of God so it's going to Cleese II ask these chapter 2 verse 1 I'll probably start breaking into Ecclesiastes now I preach a little bit of Proverbs and just pulling out the thoughts but I told you on Sunday I'd like to look at this thought of the five W's Solomon's 5w so that's my titles for tonight Solomon's five W's please a C's chapter 2 verse 1 we'll read verses 1 2 3 for there say Amen all right please ask you chapter two verse one I said in my heart go to now I will prove thee with mirth which means gladness joyfulness therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity I said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what do with it I saw in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till I might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days their life now you'll notice there's one of the W's in there it was wine in verse three but there's five W's in proverbs and Ecclesiastes that Solomon goes after if I want to preach on those tonight but let's just bow our heads one more time for word of Prayer if everything on your heart just make a known to God here how many father we come reverently again we ask that you'd speak to us through your word we know you always will where two or three are gathered there you are we know you're here Jesus and I'm thankful that you're here floor without you we don't have a gathering but with you we can sit in heavenly places father just bless us tonight in your divine presence Lord God we ask that the Holy Spirit ministered every heart in Jesus Christ name never a said Amen God bless you to be in seated praise the Lord you know I keep forgetting it's a holiday so happy fourth of July I just keep forgetting doesn't feel like a holiday to me I hope you have the day off brother Jose and then brother man I take that's why you had the day off okay so I wasn't even thinking about it so forgive me and I'm not sure why where our other friends are tonight but May maybe perhaps are at family functions or something like that trust that the Holy Spirit will speak to them tonight amen so I like to look at this thought here I want to look at Solomon's five W's and I believe it'll be a blessing you know I know we already got people live streaming from South Africa because they put a little comments you know so Lord bless the live streamers from South Africa we have some we have a family from Florida who's been streaming all of our services lately so may the Lord be with them as well and speak to them by the the grace of God but I'd like to start with a few scriptures and then I want to look at how brother Branham and Solomon both saw or both saw God and look at those experiences where brother Ram saw Jesus and I can think of two and brother Hosea we might be able to think of a third so we'll get to those in a bit the third one I'm thinking of is when brother Branham saw Jesus and the vision came and said Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ the new now I don't know if that was a vision or a dream vision okay so that might have been the third time he saw him but I have to and I have a quote where brother Ram says I've seen him twice so there might be another quote where he says I've seen him three times but that's one thing I just thought of as I was preparing so I found two where he definitely said he saw him twice and was so striking because Solomon saw him twice too and so I want to look at those tonight by the grace of God so before I get there though rehearse here the five W's that Solomon tried to give himself to wine works wealth women and worldly wisdom those are the five things I thought was so striking I heard a preacher say I thought really and as I studied the scripture I began to see that was right there was five things he tried to give himself to and he found out he was still lacking and if you know there's one more thing he was lacking there's one more W he was lacking and we'll get to that a little bit by God's grace you can probably guess it but before we get there let's look at the two times that Solomon saw God so let's go to first Kings three I want to start there because I mentioned it to you before let's go to first Kings three the ideals look like a lot with that is to say it's like a another word for that and as your turn there first Kings three Scofield used the that the chronological work of Usher he was a historian oh sure and said that Solomon wrote proverbs in the year 1000 BC so proverbs was written 1000 years before Christ and then uh sure said that Ecclesiastes was written 23 years later in 97 BC so that gives us quite a better understanding proverbs was written first and then Ecclesiastes was written 23 years later after Solomon had tried these five W's and so it's something to keep in mind that we'll understand and I think as I've been if you notice as we've been preaching on proverbs you can sense Solomon's love for the word you can sense his love for wisdom and his urgency to get his son and his children and all those in Israel you can sense his urgency to get them to accept the wisdom of God but then by the time he's old we're gonna read some things tonight it doesn't sound like he's fully sold out to the Lord and we know he wasn't because the Bible said he didn't follow God with all his heart when he got older he fell away so you I hope you can sense that when you read proverbs in Proverbs he was a younger man he had a great more zeal for the Lord but by the time he writes Ecclesiastes he's back slidden he's given himself to these five things and has taken his heart far away from the Lord but of course he would still say thank God for God's mercy but let's go to first Kings 3 verse 1 I'm still turning there so bear with me first Kings 3-1 now I want to get the years on this as well like to get the years on this now in first Kings 3 verse 1 butcher's timing here his his date on 1st Kings chapter 3 here is 1014 BC so this took place before the writing of Crowder's and I like uh sure's timing everything seems to fall in line with it in fact remember brother Han used that for preaching Daniels 70 weeks and we know that he used osho's timing for Daniel's 70 weeks so this this vision or this experience takes place 14 years before riding proverbs alright so actually let's go down to verse 4 because the vision actually takes place in verse 4 and the king went to give in to sacrifice therefore there was for that was the great high place a thousand offerings that Solomon offer upon that altar high in giving the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and God said ask what I shall give thee and Solomon said thou has shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy according his walked before the in truth and in righteousness and an uprightness of heart with thee and thou has kept for him this great kindness that thou has given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day and now O Lord my god thou hast made thy servant King instead of David my father and I am but a little child I know not how to go out or come in and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou has chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people then I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people and the speech please Lord that Salman had asked this thing so we can get a good lesson how many want to please the Lord if you want to please the Lord humble yourself and make yourself like Solomon that I'm nobody Who am I to judge this great people I'm just a little child I'm just I'll just - me I'm just a I'm a know-nothing man I'm nobody I'm just a little nobody help me Lord I need your grace I need your wisdom and understanding I like his hum or humility before the Lord look at verse 11 and God sending him because thou has asked this thing and not has not asked for thyself long life neither has asked riches for thyself nor has asked the life of mine enemies but has asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold I have done according to thy words though I have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after the shall any arise like unto thee and I have also given thee that which thou has not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not to be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my Commandments as thy father David did walk then I will lengthen thy days and Psalm awoke and behold it was a dream when he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and offered him burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all of his servants amen so that was BC 10 14 so 14 years before he wrote proverbs let's gonna go to first Kings chapter 9 here's the second time he appears so this is ten years later ten years later looks like he appears no I'm sorry this is ten plus eight this is 18 years later in 92 BC sorry that was the year for the previous chapter 992 BC now it's a first Kings chapter 9 verse 1 and it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of Lord and the King's house and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do that the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time as he had peered under him at Gibeon and the Laursen and him I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou has made before me I have hollow this house which thou hast built to put my name there forever and mine eyes in my heart shall be there perpetually on that beautiful God's eyes and hearts are at the throne of God amen and if thy will walk before me as David thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I have commanded thee and will keep my statutes and my judgments then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel forever as I promised a David thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel but if thou shalt at all turn from following me he or your children and will not keep my Commandments and my statutes which I've set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them in this house which I have hollowed for my name will I cast out of my sight and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all the people did that happen Church yeah that happened they got scattered and at this house which is high everyone that passes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the Lord done thus unto this land into this house and they shall answer because they first took the Lord their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil amen okay so eighteen years later God appears to him and the Bible said it was the second time that God appeared to Solomon now as I was mentioning brother Jose it seems like brother branham saw Jesus maybe three times I have a quote where he said - so I'm gonna read those tonight the first time he saw Jesus while praying for his father in a field at night in a sage field the second time was laying on his bed after nine days of being sick and seeing some campaign meetings so I'll go through those I'll read through those tonight now I thought there was a third time where like I said he saw Jesus and said and the voice said you know Jehovah the Old Testament Jesus the new so I have to look that up I thought I thought that maybe the third time now so let's read this in 1953 in Chicago brother Branham said I say this with reverence I seen him twice course it was a vision he was standing in the air one night I stood and I even broke a straw off the field put it in my mouth and shoot it I looked again I said sure this is not a vision I stood there in the broom sedge sage field looking and I've been praying all night so look when God appeared to him you know and he prayed a long time and I looked again and I seen him with his foot like that and his hands folded looking towards the east and I walked toward this way and cleared my throat and when he looked around at me raised out his arms I fainted and didn't come to - the next morning and I have an idea what he looks like and so that's the first time after he's praying for his father in a Sage field he's praying all night he was trying to get the front to see Jesus's face Jesus looked over with his arms open he passed out and he woke up the next morning on the ground all right so brother BAM more about this in 1955 he said one night I saw our Lord Jesus I'm saying this with permission I believe from the Holy Spirit the angel Lord that comes is not the Lord Jesus I'm gonna understand that the age of the Lord was different than the Lord Jesus they're one that was the angel one was the Lord he says it doesn't look like him in the same vision for in the vision I saw the Lord Jesus he was a little man and there he see tells again about this experience he said they're standing not over ten feet from me stood a man a white garment on a little fella his arms folded like this a beard kind of sort hair down to his shoulder so that brother am sees Jesus and he's got hair down to his shoulders and he was looking sideways for me peaceful looking but I couldn't understand it how his feet one just behind the other and the wind blowing his robe moving and sedge or sage blowing I thought now wait a minute now I'm not asleep he said I pulled a little piece of sage off you know I'm got a toothpick in it put it in my mouth I look back toward the house and I said no I was in there praying for my dad and something come out here and here stands this man I thought that looks like the Lord Jesus I wonder if it was and I thought I believe I'll call him and I said Jesus and when I did he looked around like that that was all I remember he just reached out his arms amen he said there's not an artist in the world that can paint his picture the characters of his face the best I've ever seen his Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 I've got it on all literature and everything I use that's because it looks just like that or pretty near as close as it could be he looked like a man that if he'd speak the world would come to an end and yet with so much love and kindness till I just pitched over and at daylight I find myself just in the break of day pajama shirt soaking wet with tears he cried and got his own shirt wet when I come to myself walking back through that broom Sedgefield home amen all right that's there's a third time I could read but I'm not gonna read that just for the time sake but I want to read this next one this was in 1960 as he laid on his bed and it happened my brother Brahim says this he said I wanted to a little something he talks about this experience he says he said I felt a little nudge and said well for my brother and sake I'll set the meeting and as soon as I arrived in this valley my throat closed up so in 1960 his throat closed up and he missed some meetings and he said and I didn't speak for nine days until the meetings passed by brother otto he may be here this morning one of the brothers Junie Jackson I supposed to have a meeting for him he said my throat is too hoarse I couldn't preach the meetings he said I laid in bed for nine days with just a high fever burning and many of my brethren came to see me many famous brothers come prayed for me brother Graham Snelling brother rudder all these brothers hear me praying trying my best I couldn't even whisper I wondered what's it all about my what lovely wife's sitting there her praying them for me just kept on staying just the same they couldn't understand they give me some medicine and but I didn't take it because it was dope well they try to give him dope but he wouldn't take dope amen I just kept thinking surely Lord and then after the meetings was all over on the Monday afterwards I tried to get up and I was so weak I couldn't go through the room and I sat down and this is where his wife rebuked him because he said he said sometimes I wonder if Jesus even called me to preach he's been preaching since 1933 this is now 1960 so 20 27 years and he says I wonder if God even called me to preach and his wife said ain't you ashamed of yourself and she told me bill don't you know that God knows just what he's doing just be quiet and he said I kind of rebuked me a little and he said but you know I'm so thankful for a wife like that oh my all right he said less than an hour the people drove right up to my door and there's three men at woman and a man and they come up to give my thus saith the Lord and he sent him brother Freddie went up and told the people and then after a while I was on the bed I thought why does it happen that way why can't I speak why can't I talk to somebody I was laying there and me to come in and was going back out of the room and I looked and I seen something make a flicker over to one side and I looked and there was my wall opened up and I seen Jesus so can you imagine a wall opening up he said I seen Jesus Hama never heard me say that I've seen Jesus twice in my life in a vision so this is in March of 63 brother Jose I'm sorry April so that if he saw him again it must have been after that so this is April 16 1960 sorry well yeah I'm sorry mark April 60 I'm sorry oh right yeah yeah that might have to look for more times yeah so this is April 1960 he says the wall opened up and I believed I would seen him again before the end time and I seen him and I looked in the skies was right out there just looked like I looked through the wall and there was the Bible standing like this the great big Bible standing in the skies a good picture now Bible in the skies well there's something got light around the Bible and out of the Bible come a pretty golden cross and it stood out like this and the lights coming from around it and out of that cross he walked so out of a Bible comes across and how the cross comes Jesus amen where do you and I find Jesus in the cross amen where do we find the cross in the Bible amen beautiful and the Bible reflected the cross and the cross reflected him and he come walking out he walked right down to where I was at and I can see it just his plane I see the cross reflecting his hair standing there hung down over his face he looked down at me like that and he said to me look what he tells him you are waiting for your new ministry to be confirmed to you which was remember the third pole which was just the opening of the word it was speaking the word but is also preaching the word the seals all these things but Jesus said I've already confirmed it to you it's already confirmed you've got to accept it see and I stood and listened to him just a minute it come to my mind I didn't hear that it just come to my mind like a man that he's been a sinner all his life and he knows that there's a Bible knows there's a God but all at once here's a sermon then something tells him it's you then that same words been there all the time yet it's confirmed to him and he says and then he says Lord forgive me but it won't do no good until he accept this salvation yes and then he goes out as a Christian no matter how much he cries no matter how much he begs he's got to accept it so remember I'm saying just like we have to accept salvation he had to accept that his third pole was already given amen and he said to me then you've got to accept it the same way you've got to believe it and then jeez said but you walk with too many to walk with me you'd walk you will have to walk alone he says you walk alone he said no more than that vision left me I said Amen Lord and my wife was sitting there almost fainted I jumped up by the bed and I could talk as good as I ever did just in a second every bit of the fever left me amen so God gave a fever to Humble them and get him in a place where he could see Jesus and let him know you need to accept your next stage of your ministry you've just got to believe it and then as soon as he said I believe it amen I believe the third pole is gonna take effect as soon as he said that the fever left him and he could talk again amen hallelujah now that's what I wanted to share there about that let me look up real quick Jehovah the old and let me look after 1960 because it was April of 60 this might right here oh yeah looks like in the message of grace 1961 looks like oh yeah here it is yeah let me pick this up this is a last year all of you know which is on the print and a testimony the tapes I was sitting at a place here in Indiana where the Lord came down and spoke to me that my second ministry that was ready to take place in the near future and there was spoken into existence three squirrels all of you know the story I'm sure somehow going up the road while I let the rest of the boys go off going hunting I had a strange feeling to go to this place again it was before daylight raining and I didn't even know whether they'd get to hunt or not but that I would get over in the field they're hunting means to get alone to yourself to pray amen and I stopped the car and got off and walked across the road and went over into the bush and just before it would have been daylight it's kind of gray and Dawn ok let me make sure I save this quote here all right Oh Neeta to provide it I don't believe in wasting anything or destroying never shot a burner in my life for a target practice or anything what I hunt I eat or give to someone that does need it or does eat it I don't believe in wasting anything I don't believe in doing those things because it's not right then as I turn and started along a fermier little pathway by the side of the pasture that crossed over to an l-shape in the woods and something strange took place all my experience is I've never had anything like that I looked at the top of the hill to my left from where I was standing in there coming out of the top of the hill came three rainbows and they were running some thirty feet high first I looked and I seen that light and I just turned back because I thought it might be the Sun raising upon the second thought it wasn't towards the Sun it was towards the south and another thing it was smooth cloudy rain raining all over that was August the 25th last Friday morning okay so now we know the day August 25th 1961 and you know how it was raining and it's smooth clouds everywhere and I looked again and there it was growing taller and taller three rainbows I took off my hat I set down my gun I started walking towards it with my hands up something just seemed to tell me this is close enough I was going to sit down and take off my boots that I had on to see if I could walk a little closer but I got within a few yards of it and I seen the color of it misting like a fog moving around I stood still for a few moments it was coming right out of the top of the little mountain and I watched as the three one to the right one to the left one in the center running down into one Bowl like ever it was was alive it was moving and making its motions and I stood there just as it was graying dawn I turned and looked again and I screamed out Oh God what would you have your servant to know ok I see I think it is now I don't think he sees Jesus I think he just hears a voice just then the spear Lord came in and said Jesus of the Old Testament is Jehovah of the old he only changes Mass from spirit to man that was confirming of course my message of him letting me know assured that these 31 years hasn't been in vain today it looks like he just sees the light yeah so then though he said the light went down and then it disappeared yeah so it's just a lie okay yeah so that that clears it up I was wondering about that I thought he had seen it but it looks like it wasn't okay all right so anyways my point now is that Solomon psalm twice in dreams brother Branham saw him at least twice in visions okay now let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 1 how am i doing on time okay well that took a little bit of time I want to start in Ecclesiastes chapter 1 before we get to chapter 2 because chapter 2 will be just a short little portion by the grace of the Lord yeah now let's read all of Ecclesiastes chapter 1 it's just a rather short chapter and I'm just gonna make a few comments on this by the grace of Lord got about a half hour left to preach hours so that's pretty good now it says the words of the preacher the son of David King in Jerusalem now we know this is Salman okay because let's look at just skip ahead to verse 12 real quick now can you put up verse 12 alright the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem now the scripture CH this scripture proves this could only be Solomon some people say well it could be another son of David no this has to be Solomon because he was king over all Israel no other king other than David was king over all of Israel because after Solomon we know the kingdom divided so I just want to give you proof so you have confidence that this was Solomon now also you're gonna see later this this rider says he was greater than any king before after him so we know it has to be Solomon but just so nobody can ever tell you different okay let's go back to verse 2 vanity of vanities say it the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity what prophet at the man of all is labor which he had taken Under the Sun now this Paul's right there no this is 23 years after he wrote proverbs he's had 23 more years to live his life and we know what happened he's fallen away his heart has got cold toward God now huh me know what the word vanity means anyone know what it means it means vapour or breath so you let out a little vapor that's vanity now another word for is fleeting which means it doesn't last long so when he says vanities of vanities he's saying this is fleeting of fleeting this is a very short thing this doesn't last very long this is very scarce thing he's not saying it's worthless so I don't want you to think that when we read this we think vanity means useless or worthless and that's not true it doesn't mean worthless it means fleeting it's not going to last because how many know our days are not in vain I mean oh the New Testament says your labor is not in vain amen hallelujah there's no day that's worthless right for the Christian there's no day where you get up and say oh that's just a worthless day what a work what would a waste no every day is valuable every day is teaching you something and there's nothing you do in vain for the Lord because he sees it all and he's constantly adding to your character how me know that he's adding this and adding that adding that that's the whole goal of man is to have the character of Christ slowly daily added to you so don't let anyone tell you your life is worthless or any day's worthless or well Solomon said my life's worthless it's not worth us this is a backslidden man and he's saying your life is fleeting it's going to go fast before you know it Lily will be grown up before you know that occasion Genevieve will be grown up all the children before you know it it's fleeting it goes fast I want you to by God's grace so any small thing is in small value compared to Eternity that's why we must dedicate all of our time to eternal things as much of our time as we can we should devote it to eternal things I wonder how many people are not in church tonight not even this church or it could be this church or other churches I wonder how many people didn't go to their Wednesday night service because it was July 4th just like on Christmas I wonder how many people skip church if Christmas falls on a Sunday or whatever holiday it is see people get caught up in in worldly things and they forget how I'm eternal the Word of God is and how many that they must invest their best and they must give most of their sacrifices to eternal things amen now verse 3 even he's even asking what profit is there for a man of all's labor under which he had taken under the Sun like what benefit is there in all the works look at verse 4 one generation passes away another generation comes with the earth abideth for ever so in this portion he's saying how the earth is the only thing that abides because it's on cycles everything else ends the earth is the only real thing that stays let's go to verse 5 the Sun Also Rises and the Sun go down and hastens to his place place where he arose so even he could say my the Sun is time is going by so fast it's like the Sun is more quickly going down it seems like every day goes a little faster right verse 6 the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it were with about continually and the wind returneth again according to his circuits all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return again all things are full of labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with the hearing so he's expressing how how life seems like it so goes so fast it doesn't seem like it's fulfilling verse 9 now he gets in this portion how there's nothing new Under the Sun verses 9 10 and 11 the thing that hath been it which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there's no new thing under the Sun how many can same internet although the the you know the world what's new to the world is homosexual marriages that's new but that's not even that was done in Sodom right that's already been done technology mine we have small technology compared to what Enoch had right and Egypt and how they would have mom bodies for thousands of years and we can't even touch that as far as everything that's been done has already been done there's nothing really new Under the Sun verse 10 is there any new thing wherever it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us there's no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of those things that are to come with those that should come after so Solomon realized that does anybody really remember what happened last year or the year before most people just forget and they move on but you know as Christians we should stop and remember how important the holidays aren't like today like remember last year I preached on Veterans Day and I'm sorry Memorial Day and the Revolutionary War Christians as Christians we should remember those days and we should make sure it counts we should change our thoughts and we should take time to thank the Lord that's why I like in May last month in our two months in May on Memorial Day that's why we take our family to the parades so they can they can remember they can hear the stories about the soldiers who died in World War one or World War two or the Korean War and remember that and and we should look at the gravestones I remember that people gave their lives and that should make us want to live more closely to Christ because of the freedoms that we have verse 12 now Solomon begins his search he's expressed these things it seems like life is so fleeting now he starts his search of verse 12 I the preacher was Queen was king rather over Israel in Jerusalem and I gave my heart to search I'm sorry to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things under the heaven this sort surveil hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised there with now it's interesting that Solomon wanted to search out wisdom when God had already given him wisdom to see this shows he's back slidden he already remember God said I've already given you the gift of wisdom he's already given wisdom and so see this is he wants to search out worldly wisdom it's kind of like this it's kind of like how people grow up in church or how many know of anybody that's growing up in the message or growing up in church and then they lived they live pretty clean but when they get older they kind of want to experiment well I never got to party so I want to know what it's like the party well I never got to use drugs I want to go when I feel what it's like to use drugs I never got the fornicator I never got to do I never got drunk so I wonder and so that's kind of what he's doing God had already given him wisdom and he says but I want to go try this I want to search it out more and that was a mistake he should not have done that but how many know it huh me know there's a great testimony in growing up in purity but also remaining pure amen huh me know that's a great testimony you've heard people like you met when Tim McKinney used to come Tim McKinney has his testimony he was raised in church and member Tim McKinney said he said you know some brothers have testimonies they were drunks and they were they lived in morally and they were smokers and they did all kinds of drugs they have a great testimony that God brought them out of that he said but my testimony is God kept me away from that and my testimony was of God's keeping power God's power to keep me pure from all of it and God's power to keep me from going into it aim ahead on a oh yeah I like that that's a great testimony that's a testimony I want from Malachi Lydia acacia Haman Karras Genevieve and Victoria I want them to be raised in church Lily - I want to be raised in church and stay pure from the things of the world and have the testimony that I didn't have to go out into the world because God show me that I could be satisfied with him and live a Pure Life all the days of my life hey hey man hallelujah but see Solomon wasn't content with that Solomon was given wisdom when a few years later he's like ha I just want to try and I want to dabble into some of these things Oh may God help us to pray for our young people or young children that they don't dabble in the sin amen hope you can see that that's verse 13 what greater wisdom could he want outside of the wisdom of God but here he says he's got to search out for more wisdom 9 verse 14 now in verse 14 and 15 he said everything is vexation of spirit I've seen all the works that are done under the Sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered so we see that vexation means a longing or striving which means hard work so Solomon sees everything done he says ma this is all fleeting and it's very hard work how many brothers and mothers work really hard there's a huh it's hard to maintain a house and keep it clean it's hard to go to work 50 or 60 hours a week that's hard there's a lot of hardness in that and he noticed that and he said sometimes things get messed up and they don't get made straight it doesn't look like they get made straight sometimes it seems like there's no justice done you know someone has done wrong or if someone gets murdered or or there's some awful there's a theft or there's some awful thing that happens and it doesn't seem like it gets made straight but of course we know God makes all things beautiful in his own time but this is a mind battle Solomon's going through memories in this backside in the state now let's go to verse 16 and 18 or 16 through 18 we'll finish the chapter I commune with mine own heart saying lo I am come to great estate and have got more wisdom than all they that have been before me and Jerusalem yay my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge and I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly now I see that's the see the bad part right there he gave his heart to know what mad and folly he wanted to know what it was like for the crazy people he want to know is like to do foolish things so he started doing foolish things I perceived that this is also a vexation of spirit it's a torment right it's a long and it's a striving for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increases sorrow now let's look at this thought here just briefly if you got your Bibles go to James chapter 3 verse 13 if if we don't read this with the lens of the Holy Ghost we'll start misunderstanding what Solomon saying we have to look at this scripture through the lens of the Holy Spirit so as you're turning James 3:13 I'm gonna read Ecclesiastes again for in much wisdom is much grief did everybody understand that Solomon says if you have much wisdom then you get much grief but that's not true in the New Testament and I'll say like this it wasn't true in the Old Testament either Solomon was talking about worldly wisdom or he was backslidden talking about the wisdom of God remember Church 22 years earlier he said that wisdom is life and wisdom is a tree of life amen to them that take ahold of her hey man hallelujah glory so the same man that said wisdom is life wisdom is the Tree of Life wisdom is theirs blessings and favor and wisdom the same man 23 years later says much wisdom is much grief instead of the word making him happy it brought grief to him now I'm sure we've all seen that people that they get excited about the message then for a few years later now it's just a grief to them and the church said Amen they're no longer excited about the message anymore the message is a burden or it's hard to live the word oh it's hard to live a godly life the world looks so attractive what them they've back slitted the Word of God has been come common to them they're no longer hungry and thirsting for the Word of God oh my Oh starting to get good here so Solomon says wisdom is grief but let's look at James 3:13 now Malachi you can put it up there who's the wise man endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom to see if you're wise is gonna make you humble but if you have bitter envying and strife in your heart glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish for we're envying and strife is there's confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace now maokai put back up verse 17 buddy now remember what what did Solomon say in much wisdom is grief what does the Bible say but the wisdom us from above is first pure than what peaceable gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits so Solomon says much wisdom gives you grief but James says much wisdom gives you peace amen hallelujah so see either salman had a Backson the attitude towards the wisdom of God or Solomon's talking about worldly wisdom wisdom should not bring grief in the New Testament wisdom brings victory amen wisdom brings purity now what is pure mean it means sacred pure from carnality clean so it when you were living the wisdom of God you feel clean in your daily life you don't feel condemned of your sins you don't feel like oh I'm filthy and Jesus doesn't love me gee just thinks I'm dirty and filthy when you've got the wisdom of God and you're acting upon it you feel pure amen next peaceable means loving peace and being peaceful so wisdom the wisdom of God makes you full of peace it doesn't make you depressed it brings you the peace of God in your heart hallelujah in other words there's nothing between my Savior and I Amen all things are are made new everything feels new the peace of God rules my heart amen the peace of God is also gentle which means fair mild equitable so when the wisdom of God is in your heart you feel gentle toward everybody you don't feel angry towards people when people talk to you you give them a gentle reply like we said on on Sunday we must give a soft answer how many know that in your home and on the job and in the church you talk to people with kindness you don't talk to you don't ball them out with anger you don't tell them how much of a sinner they are you're gentle with them you don't tell them how evil they are you're really gentle and you still call them brother and sister the wisdom of God also makes you easy to be intreated which means you easily obey you're easily compliant amen so I can easily obey when I'm walking in wisdom oh the Word of God is easy for me to obey it's not hard for me to to stop looking at evil things on my phone or it's not hard for you to walk away from a dirty joke because you're easily compliant you're quickly obeying the Word of God now that could help everybody amen when you're walking wisdom you easily comply with the Word of God and of course full of mercy means you're full of kindness you have goodwill towards the miserable people the afflicted people so when you see people hurting and you've got the wisdom of God you're full of mercy to them amen my this is striking one two three four five six there are six attributes of wisdom no I've never seen that before lastly without part reality it means your undisguised so you are so sincere right but God told mother man you must be more sincere in other words you must be without partiality you must be pure before everyone you must be sincere with the young people just as you are with the older people with every person now does that help you by God's grace ecclesiastes he said much wisdom is grief but James says much wisdom is pure peaceable gentle compliant to the word full of mercy and full of good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy amen hallelujah so there's 45 minutes give me 15 more minutes there boy I'm fast so I hope that helps you when you read Ecclesiastes you've got to read it and understand Solomon said some of these things through a backslidden experience and you got to take everything he said back to the New Testament alright chapter 2 now this is where I went into the main points of my message here I hope this is helping you by God's grace you know here's the five things the five W's Solomon's five W's and I finally got to it 45 minutes in the sermon alright chapter 2 verse 1 I said in my heart go to now I will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this is also vowed vanity in other words Solomon said I'm gonna try pleasure there's all these things out there I'm just gonna give myself to pleasure to having joy and feeling glad and pleasure and gaiety and Happiness I'm gonna give myself to all that and I said of laughter and verse 2 it's mad and a mirth what do with it so he said I'm just gonna do everything that's fun I'm gonna have the most fun I'm little the most parties and most people make me laugh I'm gonna do anything that feels good I'm gonna do it and at the end of it he said what good did it do me he was left empty let me tell our young people any sin after you do it aside is exciting as it may seem at the beginning you're gonna feel empty at the and that's for my older children whatever Satan is tempting you to look at or do or say it might seem it might it might seem exciting but at the end of it you'll feel empty and dirty because that's what Solomon said verse 3 now look at that I saw in my heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting my heart with wisdom so let's stop right there so the first thing Solomon tried was wine I'm gonna drink a lot of alcohol but I'm not gonna get addicted to alcohol cuz that's what he says he says yet I'm a quiet acquainting my heart with wisdom so do you see how message people could do this to legs well I know the message but I'm gonna go to a party but I'm not gonna get too drunk right well I'm gonna go to a party I'll smoke a little bit of marijuana but I'm not gonna do crack or cocaine you see how people do this today they're like some and they've heard the word they've seen the word of God we've heard brother branham's visions about Jesus we've heard the mysteries of God but if we're not careful we'll say well I'll try it but I'm not going to get addicted to it see but the wisdom of God will lead you away from that and no lead you to the peace of God that passes all understanding amen hallelujah so see Solomon tried wine he said I'm gonna drink a lot of wine I'm gonna see if this makes me feel good he's gonna crack open some you know he's gonna crack open the bottles he's gonna try well let's see if this feels good so in other words he was gonna try out every addiction and there was five like I said there's five W's the first ones one he said I'm gonna try this out but I'm not going to get addicted let's finish verse three and Aleya hold on folly till I might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life okay so there's the first double use wine children adults alcohol will not satisfy you getting drunk will not satisfy oh by you it'll only take you deeper into depression alcohol does not satisfy had all the money in the world he could about any kind of alcohol he wanted and he said didn't do me any good and the Bible said who has whoa who's the people who have the really big sorrows those who get drunk those who drink the line right the most intoxicating wine you understand now can I lay this thought in here real quick this thought struck me today what I believe it was the Holy Spirit this is the mindset of a man who has no battles this is a mindset of the man who's not fighting a war brother Jose oh I have a good thought you see how Satan is trying to rock us to sleep where there's really no spiritual battles you see why riches are so awful you see why we should pray and say God don't make me rich but don't make me poor make me right in between because Solomon is rich he's got no Wars to fight and look what happens he gets totally back slid on God and remember his daddy the same thing happened to his daddy when he accepted his dad had Wars except when he sinned he did not go out to the war and I hope everybody lives for me tonight and I hope everybody listening present and I hope any money that listens on the archives will hear me now we must always know there's a battle to be fought and that battles done in prayer amen we've always got to have a battle because remember we said we said it last Wednesday the full armor of God once you have it on what do you do you pray always with all supplication a real Christian warrior is constantly praying all the time so Salman got to the spot where there was no battles so he found all this time to kind of I'll try one I'll try women I'll try all these things because there was no battle to fight church we must understand that when we sing these songs about millions now and sin and shame or dying God help me God help all of us to remember that everyday so we can keep praying and we can keep battling for souls amen hallelujah without a battle people will backslide they have to see the battle that's why you know when people first come in the message they're so hungry for Bible studies and for the word of God because they can see the battle but pretty soon they stop breathing they stop thinking like I'm holy enough I'm clean enough I don't really have to work on anything I've heard that before I've heard that before and what is it it's Satan deceiving them and they're getting drunk on religion they're thinking they're good enough we'll never be good enough we constantly need the blood of Jesus Christ to make us holy amen every day to die out and let Jesus blood wash us and renew us and help us to be soldiers fighting the battle and to never give up what we're supposed to be doing battling in prayer amen Oh hallelujah thank you Jesus well this is why people give up coming to church and they give up praying and they give up coming too early to church to pray they're just like Salman they're rich it increased with Goods and the days of late Asiya and they have no need of any more battles oh we've got a how many have a loved one they want to pray for how many are battling to pray for their friends or their co-workers we've got the battle and prayer in order to see people save we've got to fight we've got to be Christian warriors how many want to be a Christian warrior let's not be like Solomon and David who chose not to go to battle that's when sin happened when they stopped battling on their knees in prayer 9 verse 4 we're only going to read let's read for 5 and six you the fruit you're right and now the second one works he found out that pools and orchards and gardens and vineyards and houses and temples all these things do not satisfy well if I just had a brand-new house brother just I'd be happy no you wouldn't right if I could just move this yeah like if we just had a new church you know which we wanted to get one event we'd like to but that won't make us happy we got to choose to be happy now it'll be a building for the future if we get one by God's grace you know the god Terry's but we we must understand wine works these things they do not satisfy only Jesus spirit satisfies amen only holiness will satisfy your soul hallelujah look at verse seven now here's the third W the third W is wealth so wine works don't satisfy we're gonna see wealth doesn't satisfy either verses seven eight nine I got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house and I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me and I gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of Kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as all as musical instruments and of that of all sorts now did you catch that in treasures did you catch that word treasures Church what did I just preach on Sunday morning the treasures in your house who wrote about the treasures in your house Solomon you get set so on Sunday we preach on how Solomon said the treasures of oil are in your chambers in other words the presence of God in your house is treasures well 23 years later Solomon's like well I who cares about that treasure I want natural treasure do you see how you back slid it used to be so important to have the Holy Spirit his house but now he's like I gotta fill my house with riches I've got to get a brand-new couch or I've got to get a brand-new million dollar 100 thousand dollar TV or I need you know I need gold-plated handles on my door all I need brand-new driveway and you know you name it before when he was younger he said all the treasures of God are in our house it's the Holy Spirit and then 23 years later he's like nah I need more treasures don't you know that's how Satan's gonna attempt each one of us we all start out with the zeal of God and Satan's gonna try to get in there and try to make our treasure something other than the Prince of God we must always make sure the Friends of God is our treasure how many can say amen to that Oh hallelujah and you see that every CD or mp3 could one he had all the singers and men's singers well if only had more music more money to buy more music now that wouldn't satisfy you he had all the singers he could possibly want I've only had more money on the Google store the iTunes store oh my that doesn't satisfy and he was the most powerful and great man there was a good verse 9 so I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remain with me so see he never got addicted to money he never worship money he never got addicted to wine he never he worshiped women he always tried to catch a bounce well let me try this and see if this works let me try that and every time he find out this was not satisfying this doesn't satisfy all right now let me right there now let me close to this because I'm already coming up to an hour yeah I got three more minutes I got my hour there thank you for your patience now let's go to proverbs 7:25 I'm sorry not proverbs Ecclesiastes 7:25 forgive me please yeah see 7:25 here's where we know he tried women because he said I have a thousand women he couldn't find one that was righteous and remember that was his fault that wasn't his memory can I say like this his mother taught him how to find a good proverbs 31 woman earlier in his life his mother taught him or it was either him or another King Lemuel right he already knew what a godly woman was but apparently he didn't look for him like he ought to of please asked he's 725 I applied my heart to know in the search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even a foolishness and madness and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands who so pleases God shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her behold this have I found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but I find not one man among a thousand have I found but a woman among all those have I not found though this only have I found that God hath made man upright and they have sought out many inventions remember what did Solomon do he started taking women from Egypt and from all these heathen kings so of course he wasn't gonna find one out of a thousand but remember a hard woman is good to find because that's what proverbs 31 says who can find a virtuous woman a and hallelujah and if we've got virtuous woman in our church then God has blessed us with the cream of the crop out of there yeah but church let me I don't know if you knew this but in Proverbs the Bible said who can find a virtuous woman but did you know in Proverbs it says who can find a faithful man amen so a godly woman is just as rare as a godly man but if Solomon says it was harder for him to find a godly woman both are hard to find so if we've got godly men if we've got faithful men and virtuous women in our church then we've got the cream of the Holy Ghost crop amen hallelujah that's what we're thankful for tonight by the grace of God because member the Bible said Solomon had 700 wives princesses 300 concubines and his wives turned away his heart so he must have chose a thousand or a close to a thousand bad wives the Bible said that when it came to pass Tamas old his wives turned away his heart after other gods all right now we already know that's the fourth W wine works wealth women and the fifth one was worldly wisdom let's go back to chapter 1 in cleese Assis 116 now I'm sorry to go to 17 and I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly I perceive that this is also vexation of spirit for much wisdom as much grief and he that increased the knowledge increases sorrow so the last of the W's that he tries is worldly wisdom go to chapter 12 verse 12 proverbs 12 well I'm sorry Cleese se 1212 and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there's no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh let's stand to our feet by God's grace so can everybody see the five W's he tried he said I'll try wisdom I'm sorry I'll try a wine I'll drink a lot of alcohol I'll do works I'll try to satisfy myself building things I'll try wealth I'll try to get as rich as I possibly can that'll make me happy I'll try women I'll just take all the princesses and concubines I can and I'll try wisdom I'll try to be the smartest one I'll try to read all the time I'll try to study all the time and when he find out none of it satisfies so what is the W that satisfies the word the living word because the Bible said in Hebrews 4:12 let me just read it for you you know it because the word quick means living Hebrews 4:12 Solomon tried five W's he just needed one more he had at the beginning of his life but he fell away from it that first love of the word oh I love it I knew that was inspired as soon as I read that the five W's but I knew there was one more the word or we'd say wisdom brother Jose said it earlier that's the baptism Holy Ghost is really wisdom of God that's right Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick that means alive the word is alive powerful sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints and marrow and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart Amen let's
