[0:00] here preaching just one service and uh I
[0:03] had forgot to let the church know that
[0:05] his son David might come uh and if he
[0:09] comes I asked him to give his testimony
[0:11] now he's freshly out of the Marines he
[0:12] was in there four years he's freshly out
[0:15] of the Marines and uh he's told me a
[0:17] little bit about his testimony and uh so
[0:20] if he comes here's what I'll probably do
[0:22] I'll probably uh ask everybody who I
[0:25] mean if you can't stay for like a second
[0:27] service we'll probably have like a just
[0:29] a short second service for a testimony.
[0:32] Um, and he has a wonderful testimony.
[0:34] Did you start the live stream yet? Okay,
[0:36] you did. Okay, then I'm not going to
[0:36] share details. Yeah, I'll share it later
[0:38] by God's grace, but thank you, hun. Um,
[0:40] but he has a just a wonderful testimony
[0:42] there. I was just really impressed uh by
[0:46] the honesty that he shared and uh uh the
[0:50] transparency. I just thought it was
[0:51] really special. Um the repentance and so
[0:54] forth. God's done a great work in his
[0:56] life. So, uh, my plan, saints, is that,
[0:59] you know, we can have first service with
[1:01] brother Brian and then maybe we all can
[1:02] quickly get some food real quick or we
[1:04] could, um, maybe order some pizza or
[1:06] whatever. We just got to find a plan to
[1:08] quickly eat as possible. Maybe about 2
[1:09] o'clock just start a little testimony
[1:11] service. Okay. Um, that's the plan. And
[1:14] I know at some point we got to get back
[1:15] into our two services, you know? So,
[1:17] I'll talk to the moms about that. Want
[1:18] to get back into that and give this
[1:19] whole day to the Lord. This is the
[1:21] Lord's day. Praise God. And Brother
[1:22] Brandon did it. It's such a good
[1:24] example. You know, we've done it for
[1:25] years and years and years and just
[1:26] taking a little break for the young moms
[1:28] with the young babies. Hallelujah. By
[1:29] God's grace. So, so thankful for those
[1:31] little babies by God's grace.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Uh, such a joy. Hallelujah.
[1:36] So, that's next Sunday. Really looking
[1:37] forward to that. Uh, Brother Cam invited
[1:39] me out to preach for him. So, I'll be
[1:40] working with some dates. You know, I'll
[1:42] probably go out preach for brother Cam
[1:43] and I'll need a guest minister to come
[1:44] in. He asked me to minister there. So, I
[1:47] I was talking to brother Simon and
[1:48] brother Cam about having them out, you
[1:50] know, to minister for us. So, we'll see
[1:51] how that goes. We always look forward to
[1:53] our brethren. Hallelujah. In the faith,
[1:55] coming to preach God's word. How many
[1:56] love the word of God? Hallelujah.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians chapter 6 here.
[2:02] Verse 10. I just want to This is part
[2:04] three. It's just going to be a short
[2:05] series probably. You know, I do I was
[2:07] studying this weekend to get back to the
[2:08] God hiding himself in simplicity. I was
[2:11] studying on that yesterday and today. Uh
[2:13] but then at the last moment, I kind of
[2:14] felt, well, let me deal with this
[2:16] thought here today and uh hopefully
[2:19] it'll be a blessing uh by the grace of
[2:20] the Lord. It's Ephesians 6:10.
[2:24] Oops, went a little too far here. Pardon
[2:26] me.
[2:30] Hallelujah. And I trust after last
[2:32] weekend with a testimony of my cousin, I
[2:34] trust that you've had more victories in
[2:36] your battles this week by God's grace. I
[2:37] know I have. Hallelujah. And I shared a
[2:40] little bit about that on Wednesday. Um
[2:42] how our brother, you know, went home. He
[2:44] drove three hours on Sunday and he said
[2:46] he still felt the anointing. Said he
[2:48] felt the anointing as soon as he drove
[2:49] into Akran. There must be some type of
[2:51] holy anointing around this city. Praise
[2:53] God.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; And it's every city that has the Holy
[2:55] Ghost.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Sheffield. Hallelujah.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lorraine, you know, wherever it
[3:00] may be. Uh, hallelujah. Albian, you
[3:02] know. Uh, and then he said that
[3:04] anointing stayed on him till he drove
[3:05] three hours away and he was able to see
[3:07] more victory in his life and he woke up
[3:09] Monday morning with the anointing on
[3:10] him. What a blessing. Praise God.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; How you know the anointing's on you?
[3:13] Because you hate evil.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; That's how you know.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; You want to obey the word of God.
[3:18] Hallelujah. You might feel it really
[3:20] heavy. You might not. One thing you will
[3:22] do, you will hate sin and you will love
[3:23] the word of God.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ephesians 6:10.
[3:28] I'll read 10 and 11 and we can all read
[3:30] 12. Finally, my brethren, be strong in
[3:33] the Lord and in the power of his might.
[3:35] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[3:37] may be able to stand against the ws of
[3:40] the devil. Let's read this on three. 1 2
[3:42] 3. For we wrestle not against flesh and
[3:45] blood, but against principalities,
[3:48] against powers, against the rulers of
[3:51] the darkness of this world, against
[3:54] spiritual wickedness in high places. May
[3:57] God add his blessing to the ring of his
[3:59] word. You can be seated. By God's grace,
[4:01] I just have a few slides I want to show.
[4:03] This is from 2016. I preach a little
[4:06] series on the armor of God. So, I just
[4:07] thought I'll just review real quick uh
[4:10] so you can see some quotes from God's
[4:12] prophet, Brother Brandham. We've been
[4:13] looking at a wrestling u we wrestle not
[4:16] against flesh and blood. Okay? And what
[4:18] stuck out to me, brother Ray and brother
[4:19] Malachi, since you guys are visitors,
[4:21] was I went in the Greek and I I found
[4:23] out what that word wrestle meant. It
[4:24] means to throw someone down and choke
[4:27] them out. And I didn't realize, you
[4:29] know, I'd forgotten that. I preached on
[4:30] that, but I'd forgotten that. And then
[4:32] Jesus said that third kind of ground,
[4:34] the word gets choked
[4:36] &gt;&gt; by cares of the world and riches. So
[4:40] those two things will really choke out a
[4:42] Christian.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; Now, if they're in that case though,
[4:44] they're a foolish virgin, right? But a a
[4:46] wise virgin should be able to cast down
[4:48] and get, in other words, get all those
[4:50] uh sins weeded out of their lives.
[4:51] Praise God.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; True.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; But we're still going to wrestle. We're
[4:53] still going to go through we're going to
[4:54] battle sin our whole lives. But we won't
[4:56] let our lives be totally choked out.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; All right?
[4:59] &gt;&gt; So you put yourself in here. Now
[5:00] sisters, your garment goes way down to
[5:02] here.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; So you sisters picture this is you too.
[5:05] It's our brothers too. Now of course
[5:07] that's probably a Roman, right? And the
[5:09] Bible says thighs nakedness. So he's
[5:10] just about ready to show his show his
[5:12] nakedness there. You know Isaiah 47 says
[5:14] your thighs nakedness. Um but just the
[5:17] visual. So this is each one of you here
[5:20] today. I'm up there, but don't just let
[5:22] me stay up there. You go up there, too.
[5:23] Praise God.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; True.
[5:24] &gt;&gt; That's you. You are fighting uh not
[5:28] flesh and blood, not brothers in the
[5:30] church or sisters in the church or
[5:31] people at work. No, you're fighting
[5:33] demonic powers that are around you.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Wickedness in high places. Hallelujah.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; And God has not left you alone to fight
[5:41] by yourself. God's fully equipped you.
[5:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; You got more than enough to win the
[5:47] battle. Praise God.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; And Wednesday, we looked at standing and
[5:51] how God just wants us to stand. So when
[5:53] we're overcoming sin, we're standing
[5:55] like this. Now when we fall short, it's
[5:58] somehow the enemy either knocks these
[6:00] weapons out of our hands or our defenses
[6:03] &gt;&gt; or we just lay them down ourselves.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; True.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; And then after that, once once we got it
[6:09] laid down, that's when he can tackle us
[6:12] and throw us down.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; But like he's not gonna There's no way
[6:15] he could t There's no way a guy could
[6:17] tackle him if he's got the shield up and
[6:20] the sword. Yeah.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to tackle him.
[6:22] Hallelujah.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to throw him nowhere.
[6:24] Hallelujah.
[6:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Because he's going to stop you here and
[6:27] then he's going to cut you here. Amen.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; So, we got to realize this is what's
[6:33] happening in our lives.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; And like I said Wednesday, you've got to
[6:37] put this on.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; You don't go to bed with this on. You've
[6:41] got to put it on. I guess if the
[6:42] anointing stays on you though, three
[6:44] hours away, I guess you it could remain
[6:45] on you. I guess if it's a powerful
[6:47] anointing, I guess I should rephrase
[6:48] that. If you wake up and the Holy Ghost
[6:50] is still on you and you're ready to
[6:52] fight, well then praise God that I guess
[6:53] that's possible. Hallelujah. Brother Ram
[6:55] said Moses lived so close to God.
[6:57] Pharaoh didn't know what to do with him.
[6:58] Hallelujah.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so, uh, I guess you can
[7:02] live so close to God that the
[7:04] anointing's on you when you go to sleep
[7:05] and it's on you when you wake up. But if
[7:07] it's not, you've got to put it on.
[7:09] Hallelujah.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; That's the point we want to make. So,
[7:12] what I what I mean is sometimes we just
[7:13] wake up and we don't put on the armor of
[7:15] God. We don't seek after the kingdom of
[7:18] God,
[7:18] &gt;&gt; right? This is the kingdom of God. Jesus
[7:21] said, "The kingdom of God is within
[7:22] you." Praise God.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; All of this armor, all the defenses, and
[7:26] the offensive sword, all this is in you,
[7:29] and you got to put it on. Hallelujah.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to read through a
[7:33] brief few quotes here. Again, this is
[7:35] from 2016. I thought I'd just briefly go
[7:37] through this brief briefly. And those
[7:39] are all my, you know, I just want to
[7:40] look at just a few. Oh, yeah. The
[7:42] scripture says, "G up now the loins of
[7:44] your mind." So, brother Ram says the
[7:46] first thing and the Bible teaches the
[7:47] first thing is the belt of truth on the
[7:50] loins. And brother Ram said, you know,
[7:51] that that this belt holds up everything
[7:54] else.
[7:56] So, you know, I don't know if that
[7:57] drawing was exactly accurate, but we
[7:59] know the first thing Paul tells us is
[8:01] get your mind right in the morning.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Get your mind on the gospel.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Get your Why would you put your mind on
[8:08] bad things? Let's put your mind on good
[8:10] things. The gospel means good news.
[8:12] Hallelujah. Amen.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; It's able to save sinners. Praise God.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "See, it's the
[8:17] belt that holds the rest of it together
[8:20] &gt;&gt; in the day when there's all kinds of
[8:22] isms." He said, "Gird yourself with the
[8:24] truth." Jesus said, "I am the truth."
[8:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the truth, un having the
[8:31] true beliefs of the word of God holds
[8:33] everything else together. You got to
[8:35] believe the truth. That's why false
[8:36] doctrine is such a curse,
[8:40] &gt;&gt; then if you have false doctrine, you
[8:41] don't even have the belt on,
[8:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[8:44] &gt;&gt; That's true. Because it's the truth of
[8:46] the word. Hallelujah.
[8:49] &gt;&gt; Uh, brother Ram said, "It's good to see
[8:50] the truth buckled around you knowing
[8:53] where you're standing."
[8:55] Hallelujah. You have the whole armor
[8:57] buckled on down uh good and tight,
[9:00] pulled down with the truth of God's word
[9:02] anchored in your heart and of course
[9:04] mind as Peter said the loins of your
[9:07] mind. Hallelujah.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; And he says now when you've got the
[9:12] truth, brother says all devils in hell
[9:14] can't upset you.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; Because you know the truth. How can a
[9:18] devil upset you when you know the truth?
[9:20] You know he's lying. Hallelujah.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that beautiful? Praise
[9:25] God.
[9:26] He says, uh, when they went to the war,
[9:28] they had a big belt that buckled it
[9:30] together, held up their loins, their
[9:33] shields, kept the enemy's spears off.
[9:35] When the loin began to get weak, hang
[9:36] down. They had to tighten up their belt.
[9:38] Bring them up tight again.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; So, in other words, we got to bring our
[9:42] thoughts when we get go through trials.
[9:43] Bring your thoughts back onto the word
[9:45] of God. Tighten your thought your
[9:47] thought life up a little bit.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; You're getting too loose thinking about
[9:50] things you shouldn't think about. Think
[9:52] about the things of God. Hallelujah.
[9:54] Amen.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; See that? That's why every thought must
[9:57] be brought into captivity to the gospel
[10:00] &gt;&gt; or else you're going to get loose. Your
[10:01] thoughts are and church, we all
[10:02] experience it. I mean, if if if any of
[10:04] you have a good morning routine, you
[10:06] know what it means to your mind is
[10:08] right. And then the first little thing
[10:11] &gt;&gt; like, well, I'll just check the news or
[10:13] I'll just check that,
[10:15] &gt;&gt; right? And and we we understand, right?
[10:17] We can all understand. Wow, that's Satan
[10:19] trying to get your belt a little loose.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, do we have to deal with
[10:23] the news? Yes, we know Israel's God's
[10:25] time piece, right? All these things,
[10:26] right?
[10:27] &gt;&gt; We want to understand that,
[10:28] &gt;&gt; right? But we got to remember all these
[10:30] things are just little tactics of Satan
[10:32] trying to get our mind loose off the
[10:34] word of God. We've got to keep our mind
[10:36] tight on the word of God.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we all seen these guys,
[10:41] right, brother Mal? We all see these
[10:42] guys ride around and their pants are
[10:44] hanging down, right? And they got we're
[10:46] seeing I'm like, this shows now that's a
[10:48] natural. That's actually a natural of
[10:50] what the spiritual is. Oh, that's good.
[10:52] That's good.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; We laugh at them or we get sad at them.
[10:56] Whatever you do, it's a shame either
[10:58] way, right?
[10:59] &gt;&gt; It's just gross, disgusting, immodest,
[11:01] all these things. It might be a sign of
[11:03] homosexuality, all these things. We
[11:04] understand that. And we don't laugh at
[11:06] sin.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; But that's how we are, church. That's
[11:09] how we would be spiritually if we start
[11:11] meditating on things that don't please
[11:13] God.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; So, you know, we might laugh or snicker
[11:17] or say, "Oh, that's so bad." But what
[11:19] about us? Are we putting our minds on
[11:21] the things of God?
[11:23] &gt;&gt; Let's bring it down to home. Praise God.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; It's easy to preach against Leodysia and
[11:27] the days of No. That's easy, right? It's
[11:29] easy for us to say amen about that. But
[11:30] let's make sure our mind is focused on
[11:33] the word of God. Hallelujah.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:37] Brother Ram says when you begin to feel
[11:39] like slacking, anybody feel like
[11:40] slacking sometime?
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; I was tired this morning. I'm not
[11:43] anymore, but I was tired this morning. I
[11:45] felt like slacking in my body this
[11:46] morning. And oh, it's no use. So the
[11:49] devil said it's no use for you to pray,
[11:50] right? It's no use for you to go to
[11:52] church. It's no use for you to read your
[11:53] Bible. Brother said, "Reach down and
[11:55] tighten the belt a little bit. Pull up
[11:57] the sword a little tighter in your
[11:59] hand." Amen.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Go forward. I like that. Be ready for
[12:03] the march. Hallelujah.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; I can't march throughout my day. I can't
[12:08] march through this service unless my
[12:09] mind is totally focused on God's word.
[12:12] Hallelujah.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; We see it, church. We see it. And this
[12:16] is a wrestling match. Remember,
[12:19] &gt;&gt; if we don't do this, then Satan can pin
[12:21] us down and he's got us all choked up.
[12:24] You ain't gonna say no praise to God
[12:26] today.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; You're not going to sing any songs.
[12:29] You're not going to testify. You're not
[12:30] talking about Jesus. You're not going to
[12:32] say anything today. I've got you
[12:34] defeated.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; That's just what the devil wants.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Come on, soldier. Amen.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Tighten up your belt. Hallelujah.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Tighten up your thoughts.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. As soon as you do that, you'll
[12:45] feel those faith muscles come back
[12:47] &gt;&gt; like, "Oh, this guy's not so heavy."
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; You'll push him off, stand up. I'm
[12:54] feeling a lot better now by God's grace.
[12:56] Amen. Where's my shield? Where's my
[12:58] sword? Now I'm ready to fight. Let's get
[13:00] this day back on track. Hallelujah.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it all starts if we just
[13:09] get loose with our thinking.
[13:13] Hallelujah. God help us.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Now again, I'm just going to hit the
[13:18] highlights here by God's grace. So,
[13:20] brother says, "Oh, yeah. Now, the
[13:21] breastplate of righteousness."
[13:23] Now, the Bible says we have no
[13:24] righteousness of our own, but it's the
[13:26] righteousness of Jesus Christ. And what
[13:28] does that protect? Your heart. Right?
[13:31] &gt;&gt; So, brother says, "You've got the word
[13:33] of God in you doing what's right, the
[13:37] breastplate of righteousness." Amen.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; So, first you got your mind right and
[13:41] now your heart. Your heart represents
[13:42] your emotions. So, you need a shield
[13:45] over your emotions.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says your emotions are
[13:49] shielded with Jesus's righteousness, not
[13:52] your own righteousness. Hallelujah.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, other words, when you
[13:57] put that on, you know Jesus made me
[13:59] righteous.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; I didn't do it myself, brother Ray. I
[14:02] couldn't do it.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; Right. We we we cannot make ourselves
[14:05] righteous. It's not my armor. It's his
[14:08] armor. Hallelujah.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; He protects my heart. And I remember I'm
[14:13] not righteous, but he gave me his
[14:15] righteousness when he died on the cross,
[14:17] rose from my sins, and I believed in it.
[14:19] Hallelujah.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; And what's Satan's desire for you to
[14:25] take off that breastplate?
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Right? So then now you're you can get
[14:28] hit, right? You can get shot there and
[14:30] think, "Well, I'm not righteous. I'm no
[14:32] good." Right? Well, of course you're no
[14:34] good. Hallelujah. Of course, you're not
[14:36] righteous.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; True.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; You're not. Your righteousness isn't
[14:39] enough to fight the devil. It takes the
[14:41] righteousness of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; See, but he wants to take off. He wants
[14:47] to loosen your belt.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; Right. Loosen up your thoughts. Take off
[14:51] the breastplate. And now, well, you're
[14:53] right, devil. I'm not very righteous.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; I am no good. Why should I even go to
[14:58] church?
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Why should I even go to Bible study? Why
[15:01] should I even pray? I'm not righteous
[15:02] anyway. But Jesus gave you a protection.
[15:05] Amen.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus gave you a righteousness. He gave
[15:09] you a shield. Hallelujah. And you can
[15:11] say, "I'm not righteous. But he gave me
[15:13] his." Hallelujah.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to do what's right.
[15:18] Hallelujah.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to witness. I'm going to
[15:20] testify. I'm going to pray. I'm going to
[15:22] seek God. I'm going to draw nigh to God.
[15:24] I'm drawing nigh to God. And then God
[15:26] draws nigh to me.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Because of his righteousness, not
[15:30] because of mine.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; The helmet of salvation.
[15:37] Brother says he says now that's the mind
[15:39] in here. The head covers over the head.
[15:43] And he said now he says look at this. He
[15:45] goes on the brass headpiece knowledge of
[15:48] knowing this. My healing comes from God.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; My salvation comes from God. My
[15:55] experience matches his word. Not the
[15:57] church's idea. The word. Hallelujah.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan would love to get us
[16:04] loosen the belt.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Forget about Jesus righteousness
[16:09] &gt;&gt; and then for forget the idea that uh oh
[16:12] well maybe I can't be healed.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm not saved. How often the devil
[16:17] battles us with that?
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Listen church, if you're battling
[16:19] whether you're saved or not, it's time
[16:21] to put that helmet back on
[16:23] &gt;&gt; because that will protect you. And
[16:25] remember, I am saved. Not by my
[16:27] righteousness, but by grace I'm saved
[16:30] through faith. Hallelujah. And I'm not
[16:32] boasting in my works. I'm boasting in my
[16:34] savior. Hallelujah.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; If you don't feel saved, it's time to
[16:38] put the armor back on. Put your helmet
[16:41] back on. Know that you're saved.
[16:43] Hallelujah.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Same thing for healing. Brother Ram
[16:46] says, same thing for healing, right? Uh
[16:48] the atonement not only healed our souls,
[16:51] it healed our bodies.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; If anybody knows about healing as
[16:53] brother Ray, hallelujah. At least in
[16:55] here. Well, Jose does too. He has a lot
[16:57] of healings, too. By God's grace.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's because God helped them
[17:02] to keep their helmets on.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Now church, some of us are younger, but
[17:05] we're going to come down to that time
[17:06] where we might get a lot of sicknesses.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; There might be accidents at work. And
[17:10] then we got to make sure the helmet of
[17:12] salvation is on us.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, know that I am
[17:17] saved. I am already healed. By his
[17:19] stripes, I was healed. Put that on
[17:21] because Satan's trying to attack. He's
[17:23] trying to get you to take it off and
[17:25] then choke you out and won't let you
[17:27] breathe. Won't let you get any life.
[17:28] Amen. Oh, there it is. the life. Amen.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; He's trying to choke you out so you have
[17:32] no spiritual life to fight him with.
[17:34] Hallelujah. But you have life. And Jesus
[17:36] said, "I give you life that you might
[17:38] have it more abundantly." Hallelujah.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Here's the life. Put on the helmet. Make
[17:43] sure the belt's tightened up. Put on the
[17:45] breastplate. You've got life. Let's
[17:47] live. Hallelujah.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Let's live to the glory of God.
[17:52] Hallelujah.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; As I said Wednesday, why would you spend
[17:55] your whole day on your back like this?
[17:56] The devil just getting victory over. Why
[17:58] would you spend the whole day like that
[18:00] when you don't have to?
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Why would I do that? Why would you do
[18:05] that? Just take a moment to pray.
[18:07] Confess your sins. You'll feel the faith
[18:09] coming back in your members. You'll feel
[18:11] revival. You'll feel emotion for Jesus.
[18:15] It'll all come back. And then you can
[18:17] stand up for Jesus.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "Having done all, do what?
[18:23] Stand."
[18:24] &gt;&gt; That's all he wants you to do is stand
[18:26] for him.
[18:28] Don't let yourself be the word means
[18:30] throw. So they would probably take you
[18:32] by your uh your uniform, right? The
[18:34] Roman uniform. Throw them down like they
[18:36] do in Judah. We study Judah, right? In
[18:38] martial arts. The big thing is get their
[18:40] get their uniform, throw them down.
[18:42] Whether you got to do it over your hip,
[18:43] whatever you got to do, trip them.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; That's Satan's desire to throw you down
[18:48] and then choke you out. You have no
[18:50] life, no influence.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember that man without
[18:56] the wedding garment in the parable when
[18:58] Jes when he said, "Where's your
[18:59] garment?" He had nothing.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; See, it's like he was choked out. He had
[19:03] no testimony. They said, "What'd you do?
[19:05] Come in another way?" He couldn't say
[19:06] nothing. Why? He was spiritually choked
[19:08] out. He didn't make the rapture
[19:11] &gt;&gt; because he'd been wrestled down and he
[19:13] had nothing to share. He had no
[19:14] testimonies to share. Thank God if you
[19:17] got a testimony.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God if God's been watching
[19:22] over you. Hallelujah.
[19:24] And you can testify about the glory of
[19:26] God. Hallelujah.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; The love of Jesus Christ. Thank God you
[19:30] got an experience that matches the word
[19:32] of God. Hallelujah.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Now the feet shout. Now this one doesn't
[19:41] have the picture. They actually had she
[19:43] is what they're called, which is just
[19:44] like defenses for the shins
[19:46] &gt;&gt; all the way up to the knees.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Brother Bam just makes one
[19:50] statement. He says, "Go anywhere, any
[19:52] place, any time, feet shod with the
[19:56] gospel."
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, Satan will try get us to
[20:00] loosen our belt, take off our helmet. I
[20:02] don't I'm not even saved. I don't even
[20:04] know if I'm saved. I don't have any
[20:05] righteousness. Uh my mind just is going
[20:08] to uh my mind's just going to wander on
[20:10] all these things. And then he tries to
[20:12] get you to take off your shoes and your
[20:14] sheav.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; And what does that mean? The Lord says,
[20:17] "Go pray for that. Go visit that person.
[20:19] uh go make that payment where you need
[20:21] to make your payment, right? Go to the
[20:23] bank and make the payment or something
[20:25] or go to that go to that person's house
[20:26] and give them a meal and you're like,
[20:28] "Ah, what good will it do anyway?"
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Why should I help them out? They never
[20:32] help me out.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; True.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; See what it is? He's got He's got people
[20:38] choked out and they can't do anything
[20:40] for Jesus. Praise God.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; They can't go anywhere. They can't do
[20:44] anything. It's all In other words, it's
[20:46] all about them. It's selfishness. It's
[20:48] isolation. It's living for oneself. But
[20:51] we're not to live for ourselves. We're
[20:53] to live for others. Hallelujah.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; But see, putting on the feet, Sean, it
[20:59] caused you to go somewhere, maybe visit
[21:00] a small little church sometime,
[21:03] &gt;&gt; right, brother Malai?
[21:05] &gt;&gt; It might cause you to do that. I went to
[21:07] Sheffield last year, so that was my time
[21:08] to go visit.
[21:10] And you told me I should go for prayer,
[21:11] and I did. Remember that?
[21:13] &gt;&gt; You might not. You have so many
[21:14] testimonies. You might not remember
[21:15] that, brother, but I appreciate you.
[21:17] Brother Ray knew in his spirit I should
[21:19] go up for prayer and I went up for
[21:20] prayer and he told me later. I was like,
[21:21] "Praise the Lord." Hallelujah. Amen.
[21:26] Now, the shield of faith. Brother Ram
[21:29] said, "Faith knocks off the darts."
[21:33] [Music]
[21:35] &gt;&gt; Faith. So, Satan shoots powerful fast
[21:38] darts at you.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I wasn't expecting that. Boom.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; How many you ever had that you're around
[21:42] a sinner, all of a sudden they cuss or
[21:44] they use the Lord's name in vain? It's
[21:45] like boom. Whoa. My I wasn't ready for
[21:47] that one.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Right. What is it? It's a It's an alert.
[21:51] Get up your shield.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Satan shoots quick uh
[21:56] fiery. In other words, they're powerful
[21:58] uh temptations at you. And you've got to
[22:01] have faith. And faith, the word means
[22:03] assurance. Brother Ram tells us, in
[22:05] other words, it's a revelation of the
[22:07] will of God.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, a revelation of God's
[22:11] will will stop every fiery dart that
[22:14] shot your way. Hallelujah.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; The fires of the devil will not touch
[22:20] you. Satan can't burn you because you've
[22:22] got a shield of faith. You've got
[22:24] revelation in God's word. You know the
[22:27] will of God.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it just knocks him off.
[22:32] I like his language there. Just knocks
[22:34] him off.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; They had a dart game yesterday right at
[22:37] the at that facility.
[22:39] And you seen You ever seen a dart where
[22:41] it won't stick? That ought to be us.
[22:43] Praise God. When was the last time any
[22:44] play anybody played darts in here?
[22:46] Hallelujah.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; And you get discouraged because your
[22:48] darts don't hit. That's how the devil
[22:50] feels when his darts don't stick.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Satan shoots
[22:56] darts. He wants it to hit. He wants to
[22:58] hurt you. He wants to bring pain. But
[23:00] church, just raise up the word of God.
[23:02] Just raise up faith. I know what God's
[23:04] word says. I've got assurance in God's
[23:06] word. That can't hit me. That's going to
[23:08] fall off. Satan can't hurt me because
[23:10] God protects me.
[23:13] Hallelujah.
[23:16] And church, I remember, I think we did
[23:18] some history, and their shields were big
[23:21] enough to cover themselves if they just
[23:22] kneel down. There it is.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Kneel down in prayer.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; If they just kneel in prayer, nothing
[23:29] could hit them at all.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why prayer is so important.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you just kneel in prayer, how
[23:37] is the devil going to get a fiery uh
[23:39] temptation? Whether it's greed or lust
[23:41] or the cares world or anxieties, uh
[23:45] &gt;&gt; depression and fear, all these things,
[23:47] how is that going to hit you if you're
[23:49] kneeling in the promises of God and
[23:51] you've got a protection, a supernatural
[23:54] weapon? Hallelujah.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is kneel and take
[23:58] cover. Ah,
[24:00] &gt;&gt; can I just say it like this? This ought
[24:03] to be you taking cover in your prayer
[24:04] closet.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; You've seen those memes. I've seen memes
[24:08] where dads are laying with their
[24:09] children reading the Bible on their bed
[24:10] and the dad's got Bibles holding up
[24:12] there and all the darts of devils are
[24:14] getting extinguished right there and the
[24:18] kids are so happy they're reading the
[24:19] Bible and the dad's holding off. He's
[24:21] got the shield of faith. Church, this is
[24:23] the best shield you got. Hallelujah.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Hold this up and say, "Satan, you can't
[24:28] hurt me because I've already got the
[24:30] promise of God. I'm shielded. I'm
[24:32] protected. I've got a protector.
[24:34] Hallelujah. I've got a provider. I've
[24:37] got God on my side.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; And church, it knocks off all
[24:44] all the fiery darts.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; And remember what it said, above all.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; So, the most important thing you can
[24:52] have above all is faith in the word of
[24:54] God.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; True. And that will extinguish all the
[24:59] fiery darts of the wicked.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Any fiery dart that can come your way,
[25:07] you can defeat it if you hide behind the
[25:10] protection of the shield of faith.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; It can't hurt you. It extinguishes all
[25:17] the temptations.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Whether it's sickness, right? Whether
[25:21] it's uh pornography, right? Whether it's
[25:23] drug abuse, whether it's depression, as
[25:26] we said, whether it's resentment,
[25:28] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[25:30] &gt;&gt; a critical spirit, whatever the devil's
[25:32] trying to get at you. Hallelujah. Now
[25:34] remember, brother Ram battled the
[25:36] critical spirit more than everything
[25:37] else,
[25:37] &gt;&gt; right? You can look at his life, you
[25:40] know, uh
[25:42] you look at his life and over the course
[25:44] of his ministry, he battled most the
[25:46] critical spirit like in standing in the
[25:48] gap 63 where he almost left the field
[25:50] because if he said if they won't hear
[25:52] it, they don't have to hear it.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; And he almost moved up in the mountains.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; But what did what did the angel remind
[25:59] him of? He said, "You're not an Old
[26:01] Testament prophet. You've been an
[26:02] apostolic prophet with many gifts."
[26:05] Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; And so the Lord encouraged him to pick
[26:08] up his Bible. In other words, the Lord
[26:10] encouraged him to pick up his shield and
[26:12] he stopped started blocking all the
[26:14] enemy's attack. I'm not going to leave
[26:16] the bride. I'm going to the bride.
[26:18] Hallelujah.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; The angel said, "You go and do that." He
[26:25] said, "Your wife will leave you."
[26:28] Hallelujah. There's going to be
[26:29] consequences if we put down the armor of
[26:31] God.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; True.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; God, help us to keep it on. Hallelujah.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Lastly, number six. Now remember, six is
[26:39] the number of anointed man. Adam was
[26:41] made on the sixth day perfect with the
[26:42] anointing of God.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Six can be a good number and a bad
[26:45] number. God uses for a good number.
[26:47] Hallelujah.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:51] Little said, "Now you're fortified."
[26:52] Amen. With the word of truth around your
[26:54] loin, preacher, that's what it is.
[26:56] Helmet of salvation, the shield of
[26:57] faith, and the sword waving in your
[26:59] hand. Now look what what it look what it
[27:00] means. Satan, I'm coming to meet you.
[27:05] You meet me in the name of science, in
[27:07] the name of culture or organization.
[27:10] You meet me in the name of this and that
[27:12] the other, but I meet you in the name of
[27:15] the Lord God of Israel. I'm coming after
[27:17] you. Give away. Even death itself can't
[27:21] stand there. Chop a hole right through
[27:24] it.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:29] See, so when it feels like there's bound
[27:31] or like there's fences or there's
[27:33] mountains before you, right? There's
[27:34] obstacles before you, you got to take
[27:36] the word of God and rebuke Satan. Say,
[27:38] "I'm going through." Amen.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; I've started it with Jesus and I'm going
[27:42] through. Hallelujah.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; You cut your way through the trial.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get through this. God's
[27:50] going to help me. And remember, the
[27:51] trial, the fiery trials of your faith
[27:54] are more precious than gold.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; So, the fact you got to fight off those
[27:59] fiery darts, it's a fiery testing,
[28:01] right? The fiery trials of your faith,
[28:04] your shield, are more precious than
[28:06] gold. And you take the word of God and
[28:08] you attack Satan with it.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Can everybody see that? By God's grace.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; So, you've got to be waving the word in
[28:15] our hands. I'm ready to rebuke Satan.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; See, see, church, when we leave our home
[28:20] or whatever it is, we got to be ready to
[28:22] speak the word of God. Hallelujah.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to fall to this. I'm gonna
[28:25] overcome this. Hallelujah.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Because I've got the sword of the spirit
[28:30] and it's life and I'm gonna chop my way
[28:33] through this temptation. Hallelujah.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a blessing. Amen.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the end of my review there.
[28:43] So, hallelujah. How many appreciate
[28:45] those visuals? Amen.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; I thought you might. It's been nine
[28:48] years since I showed them. So, my
[28:50] &gt;&gt; wonderful
[28:50] &gt;&gt; all these years of preaching, it just
[28:52] kind of all blends together if I because
[28:53] I forget. I'm a I'm a man. Now, I want
[28:56] to go a little bit further. Let me go a
[28:57] little bit further by God's grace.
[29:00] Hallelujah.
[29:03] Amen, brother. Thank you, brother.
[29:07] I appreciate everybody's positivity and
[29:09] encouragement. Now, um kind of building
[29:12] on that here, here's where I want to
[29:14] Wednesday, we looked at how, um in order
[29:18] for Satan to wrestle us, we have to
[29:19] compromise. If you don't compromise,
[29:22] there's going to be no wrestling match.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; And we showed some examples of how
[29:26] Brother Brandham compromised,
[29:29] right? Uh the devil said, uh oh, brother
[29:32] Brandham, you can have peace with your
[29:34] mother-in-law as long as you don't go
[29:36] out and preach to the Pentecostals. He's
[29:38] like, okay, I'll take that. I'll take
[29:40] that compromise. And church, look what
[29:42] happened. Flood and death happened.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; So, we never want to compromise with
[29:47] Satan.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:51] That's our uh that's our that's our
[29:53] battle too. Don't compromise. He said
[29:56] remember I'll give you Satan say I'll
[29:57] give you a little and I can have a
[29:59] little of your time.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; It's a compromise. But we do not
[30:03] compromise. We don't make any agreements
[30:05] with Satan. Hallelujah.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every compromise makes you weaker
[30:10] and weaker. Right now, if you would ac
[30:14] uh Matthew 13:22 again, I ended with
[30:17] this and I want to go back to this here.
[30:20] We've got to stand up against anxiety
[30:23] and riches. This is what Jesus said. So,
[30:25] the this is like a foolish virgin type
[30:27] here. They're growing up, but their life
[30:29] is choked out. They're wrestled. They
[30:31] thrown down and they're choked out. They
[30:33] don't have a word in their mouth, right?
[30:35] They're not getting the life of the
[30:36] oxygen of the word. Their spiritual life
[30:39] is being choked out.
[30:41] Okay.
[30:43] So it's uh it's the cares of this world.
[30:45] Now the word care means anxiety. So
[30:48] remember with all these armor pieces
[30:50] each one can be removed with fear.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Again like the devil say are you sure
[30:55] you're saved? And you and then if you're
[30:57] if you if you accept that you'll take
[30:59] off your helmet say I don't know if I am
[31:01] saved.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[31:05] can uh and whatever fiery dart is shot,
[31:07] you know, uh fear can make you put down.
[31:09] I I don't know if I will get well. I
[31:11] don't know if I I don't know. I don't
[31:13] know if what the doctor says is true or
[31:14] not. We got to take what God says is
[31:17] true. Hallelujah.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Doctors Brother said they're good as far
[31:21] as they know.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; But God can give a revelation greater
[31:24] than what the doctor says.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; He's got a word that trumps the doctor's
[31:28] word. Hallelujah.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the same thing riches
[31:35] riches can be used to loosen our belt a
[31:37] little bit.
[31:39] Well, maybe if I skip this service, I
[31:41] could get a little I could get a little
[31:43] more money.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; That's loosening the belt.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Well, if I just get up a little earlier
[31:50] and don't read my Bible, I could work an
[31:52] extra hour of overtime, but I won't read
[31:54] my Bible. That's the devil.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to get up earlier
[32:00] before your overtime to read the Bible
[32:02] if you want to do that.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If not, you'll be choked out
[32:06] and you'll lose the victory of the day.
[32:07] And church, then the thing is, how many
[32:09] days do you stay down?
[32:12] &gt;&gt; How much of the week do we get victory,
[32:14] church? It ought not to be God help us
[32:15] not to just let it be one day. Let's
[32:17] have no days of loss. Amen.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Can we string together a a week of
[32:22] victories by the grace of God? In other
[32:24] words, where we didn't waste any days
[32:26] where God helped us to stand.
[32:27] Hallelujah.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; But these two, Jesus points them out
[32:32] specifically. These two have a great
[32:35] impact on believers.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Anxiety and riches.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God help us. Now, here's what I
[32:43] want to get through. Uh Galatians 5:1.
[32:46] I'm turning a page here. So, let's go to
[32:47] the next thought.
[32:51] Galatians 5:1. Now, I'm looking at the
[32:53] word stand, right? Because either all of
[32:55] us today, we're either standing ready to
[32:57] fight the devil or some of us might even
[32:58] be choked down right now.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; You got to look at you. You might be
[33:01] smiling, might be staring off, you might
[33:03] be sleeping,
[33:05] right? But we're all in one of these
[33:07] conditions.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; We're either standing ready to go fight
[33:10] for the for the Lord Jesus or Satan's
[33:13] got us choked down.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not going to sit. Now,
[33:16] you don't have to say amen. He said
[33:17] you're not going to say amen.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; You're not going to shake Ray's hand
[33:22] after service.
[33:23] Don't even look at brother Jose after
[33:25] service. He did this and Ray did that
[33:27] and Jesse did that. Don't don't even
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Yet everybody might look so happy.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Got your best clothes on.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; It's iron and everything.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; You actually remembered your deodorant.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Just silly stuff, you know. I'm just
[33:41] saying like every you can look good from
[33:43] the outside but be losing the battle on
[33:45] the inside. Hallelujah.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Choked out with no life, no testimony,
[33:50] no oxygen, no life source. Hallelujah.
[33:52] not living with the word of God.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Now look what struck the Galatians.
[34:00] Who knows what it was?
[34:03] Legalism.
[34:05] A demon of legalism.
[34:08] Imagine this. went into the church,
[34:09] Brother Ray, and started knocking off
[34:12] all their swords, knocking down all
[34:14] their shields and threw them down,
[34:17] Brother Ray, and was choking them down,
[34:19] saying, "You have to be circumcised in
[34:21] order to be saved as a Christian."
[34:23] Think about that. A Christian church,
[34:26] Brother Malachi. But if you walked in
[34:28] there spiritually, everybody would be
[34:29] laying down, choked out.
[34:35] And Paul's saying, and Paul said in
[34:36] there, "Are you guys even born again?"
[34:38] And he said, "Maybe I got to travail
[34:39] again to make sure you're born again."
[34:41] How can a born again believer get thrown
[34:44] down by Satan and choked out by
[34:46] legalism?
[34:48] &gt;&gt; But church, it happened. And and then he
[34:50] also says they're bewitched by evil
[34:52] spirits because rebellion is as a sin of
[34:54] witchcraft.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[34:57] &gt;&gt; When see people don't understand that
[34:59] when you take a false doctrine, it's
[35:00] actually a witchcraft demonic spirit
[35:02] that's entered in the church.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; And Paul walked in there like, "Man, you
[35:06] guys started off good. You started off
[35:08] with faith, but every one of you is
[35:10] choked down by legalism.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; What's we're Let's read this together.
[35:14] One, two, three. Stand fast, therefore,
[35:17] in the liberty wherewith Christ has made
[35:20] us free and be not entangled again with
[35:24] the yoke of bondage.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Stand here means to stand firm, to
[35:28] persevere,
[35:29] &gt;&gt; to keep one standing.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; So, they were, think about that, they
[35:33] were supposed to protect the ground of
[35:35] liberty, brother Ray. And that's what we
[35:37] got in the message.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; We're standing here, brother Malagi. And
[35:40] we got we're taking our ground.
[35:41] Hallelujah. This is our fortress. This
[35:43] is our castle. And it's a castle of
[35:45] Christian liberty. Hallelujah.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; But Satan wants to come in there and
[35:49] start knocking over and shooting people.
[35:51] And oh, or just knocking over, wrestling
[35:53] them down and making them believe false
[35:56] doctrines of legalism. And then Paul
[35:58] says, if you do that, you're not
[36:00] standing in liberty anymore. You've
[36:02] actually been choked out.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Right. And your entire castle, in this
[36:06] in this case, your entire church is a
[36:09] bunch of choked out weaklings. Can I say
[36:10] it like that?
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Choked out weaklings because of the
[36:15] legalism of circumcision. He says it in
[36:18] verse two. Behold, I I Paul say unto you
[36:20] that if you be circumcised, Christ shall
[36:22] profit you nothing.
[36:25] Verse three, for I testify again to
[36:27] every man that is circumcised that he's
[36:28] a debtor to the whole law.
[36:31] No, I'm not going to spend a whole lot
[36:32] of time on this because remember about
[36:34] three years ago I preached a a series on
[36:36] uh good doctrine versus false doctrine
[36:38] and legalism right some right everybody
[36:41] remember okay good
[36:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you forgot it's okay if
[36:44] you forgot sometimes I forget too uh
[36:47] yeah oh yeah it's called doctrines of
[36:48] devils now everybody remember
[36:50] &gt;&gt; preach about 20 sermons on doctrines of
[36:51] devils showing what uh false doctrines
[36:54] were and legalism and all the things
[36:56] that go around the message now here's
[36:58] some examples today I believe of
[37:00] legalism. The press, play, and obey
[37:03] movement is definitely legalism.
[37:07] Right, brother Chris?
[37:09] Legalism is your own righteousness apart
[37:12] from the Bible. In other words, you you
[37:14] take your own idea. Well, I'll be holy
[37:16] if I do this, but it's wrong. It's not
[37:18] right in the scripture.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; It's self-righteousness. So, there's a
[37:22] whole group of Christians that say, "We
[37:23] don't need any preachers. I just need
[37:24] somebody to come up here and press play.
[37:26] We all sit down and just watch the
[37:27] words." And there's no living preacher.
[37:29] Oh,
[37:30] &gt;&gt; that's legalism,
[37:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:32] &gt;&gt; That's legalism. They've taken away from
[37:34] the word of God.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; I just I just saw the the blog the blog
[37:38] post yesterday. They said, "How can
[37:40] anybody The pastor said, "How can
[37:41] anybody not say uh we're in the perfect
[37:43] will of God by press and play?" Uh I can
[37:46] because Ephesians 4 11 says, "We need
[37:48] pastors, preachers, evangelists, and all
[37:50] these things until we all come in the
[37:53] unity of the faith." Hallelujah.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; And we haven't come there yet.
[37:56] Hallelujah.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. How can my question is how can
[38:00] anybody not see that?
[38:02] &gt;&gt; That's because they're not born again.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; So that's one form of legalism. And
[38:07] that's what they say, brother. I don't
[38:08] know if you heard it. They say if you
[38:10] press play, that's the token.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; They say if you go to a press play
[38:14] church, that's the token of being a Holy
[38:16] Ghost fil believer. You go to That's
[38:18] just the same as saying you got to speak
[38:20] in tongues
[38:21] &gt;&gt; to know you got the Holy Ghost. It's the
[38:23] same exact thing.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Same legalism. But Paul said, "Don't
[38:27] fall for that. Stand up against that."
[38:29] Hallelujah.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; No matter what the pressure is, no
[38:32] matter what the persuasion, no matter
[38:34] who's saying it. It doesn't matter what
[38:36] man says it. It matters what God says.
[38:38] Hallelujah.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And think about that. They all bow down
[38:43] to this press play and obey and they
[38:45] choke them down.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; You're not going to say Ephesians 4:11
[38:49] anymore.
[38:51] You're not going to read Romans 10
[38:52] anymore. Where blessed are the feet of
[38:54] those who preach the gospel of peace.
[38:56] Hallelujah.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; How beautiful on the mountains are the
[39:00] feet of them who preach the gospel of
[39:02] peace. Hallelujah.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; They're choked out to that.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; All they know is press, play, and obey.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; It's legalism.
[39:10] And if we could take a If God could pull
[39:12] back the curtain of time, brother Ray,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; we would look in their church and
[39:17] everybody's being choked out.
[39:19] This devil's like, "I got him. I got him
[39:21] down. I got him down. You get that one.
[39:23] You get that one."
[39:25] &gt;&gt; And the real believer's already ran out
[39:26] the door with the Holy Ghost.
[39:27] Hallelujah.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Or maybe they're on the outside praying
[39:30] for all these people on the inside.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; But may God help us. If the curtain was
[39:36] pulled back today, each one of us would
[39:38] be standing warriors saying, "Preach it,
[39:41] brother. Preach it, brother. We're
[39:42] overcomers. We're standing in liberty.
[39:45] We're not going to bow down. We're not
[39:47] going to quit. We're going to stand for
[39:48] this message. Hallelujah.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; But it's your choice.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Either fight or surrender.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to fight the good fight of
[39:57] faith. Hallelujah.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Though none go with me, still I will
[40:02] follow.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; No turning back. No turning back.
[40:06] Hallelujah.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:13] Another month is they say you can't have
[40:14] drums in the church. Yeah, brother
[40:16] talked about drums and there are good
[40:18] quotes about drums. There's some quotes
[40:20] against drums. Just like there's quotes
[40:22] about tongues and quotes against
[40:23] tongues.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; It's in everything, church. It's going
[40:27] to be a balance that we got to go back
[40:29] to the scripture. And the scripture
[40:30] speaks of drums and percussions,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:33] &gt;&gt; I preached a series on that, but I'm
[40:34] just giving you some examples.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[40:35] &gt;&gt; If somebody says no drums or no shouting
[40:37] or no rejoic or no screaming, no
[40:39] dancing, they've just knocked off the
[40:41] sword and shield and they got them
[40:43] thrown down choking them out.
[40:46] Hallelujah.
[40:47] That's why I was so blessed. Wednesday,
[40:49] I didn't even remember, Most of you
[40:51] weren't even here. That's okay. You got
[40:52] work and everything. Wednesday, I just
[40:54] started singing, uh, I can sing your
[40:55] love forever. I started dancing all over
[40:57] the church.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; It just struck me like, I'm going to
[41:00] sing of God's love forever.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; And I feel like dancing.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; It's victory, not foolishness. It's
[41:08] victory. I know that. Hallelujah.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't plan that. It's like God
[41:13] struck my heart. It's like I He's been
[41:14] so good to me. I'm literally going to
[41:16] sing of his love for eternity.
[41:18] Hallelujah.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; For eternity, Sister Beatress,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; that means there's no end.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; We're going to keep singing a new a new
[41:28] a new chord or a new verse about the
[41:31] love of God. How is that possible? All
[41:33] things are possible with God.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; But see, they throw him down.
[41:42] and they choke him out. Oh, no drums.
[41:44] Press, play, and obey. The other one,
[41:47] they say, uh, I preached on this
[41:48] numerous times, the you're the greatest
[41:50] of all time. You're the greatest
[41:51] believers of all time.
[41:54] Now, church, if somebody told you again
[41:56] and again, Rey, you're the greatest uh
[41:59] factory worker of all time. Now, the
[42:01] first time you'd be like, brother, I
[42:03] appreciate your kindness, but
[42:06] now for him, he he he'd cast it down
[42:08] every time, right? But for a younger
[42:10] maybe a young believer, if they if
[42:12] somebody says you're the greatest of all
[42:13] time and time again, you start
[42:17] I am pretty good actually. I mean, I
[42:18] guess the more I think about it, I'm
[42:20] good.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; I do go to church. I pay my tithes.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; I dress modestly.
[42:27] I'm think I'm pretty something's pretty
[42:28] special now. I mean, I'm pretty good.
[42:31] But church, that's message preachers
[42:33] that say, "These young people are the
[42:34] greatest young people of all time." How
[42:36] many of them have ever missed a meal by
[42:37] fasting?
[42:39] How many then ever been arrested and put
[42:41] in prison?
[42:42] &gt;&gt; And these preachers today are calling
[42:44] them the greatest of all time. The
[42:46] young, that's just the young people.
[42:47] Then they call their the preachers,
[42:48] these preachers are the greatest
[42:50] preachers of all time.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible says flattering lips workketh
[42:55] through it.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; The more people tell you how great you
[42:59] are, if you're not careful, you're going
[43:01] to let that go to your head.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to loosen up a little bit.
[43:04] Say, "Well, I'm pretty great. I mean, I
[43:06] might as well just I I don't have to
[43:08] pray today. I don't have to read my
[43:09] Bible today. People tell it to me.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; It's one of thems I've seen
[43:15] because nobody can correct you. You
[43:17] think you're so great and and in all
[43:19] real people choke down
[43:22] &gt;&gt; and they can't they can't even say. And
[43:24] church, watch that. When people do that,
[43:26] they don't go fellowship with other
[43:27] people.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; They make themselves were the holy go
[43:31] fellowship with other people.
[43:33] They make themselves we're the holiest.
[43:35] We don't need any fellowship.
