[34:06] I don't think I've ever preached this
[34:07] topic so maybe it'd be familiar I'm
[34:09] sorry or new to many of you by God's
[34:11] grace or if you've been reading in the
[34:13] church age book or spoken word Original
[34:15] Seed in 1962 might be kind of familiar
[34:17] to you by God's grace but we would like
[34:20] to look at this the three showdowns this
[34:23] morning by God's
[34:24] grace verse 22 if you're there amen
[34:28] amen but ye are come unto Mount Zion and
[34:33] unto the city of the Living God the
[34:37] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[34:41] company of
[34:42] angels to the general assembly and
[34:45] Church of the
[34:47] firstborn which are written in heaven
[34:51] and to God the judge of all and to the
[34:54] spirits of just men made perfect now if
[34:58] you know the scripture earlier in the
[35:00] chapter he's talking about Moses how
[35:01] they had to come to Mount Si but he said
[35:03] we have a different Mountain that we
[35:05] come to praise God Mount Zion now verse
[35:08] 24 and we have a different mediator and
[35:10] to Jesus the mediator of the New
[35:12] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[35:15] that speaketh better things than that of
[35:18] Abel see that ye refuse not him that
[35:22] speaketh God help us to obey all the
[35:24] word of God not refuse what his word say
[35:26] says for if they escape not who refused
[35:29] him that spake on Earth much more shall
[35:32] we not Escape if we turn away from him
[35:35] that speaketh from heaven so the
[35:38] mountain we come to is not a physical
[35:40] Mountain it's a spiritual mountain and
[35:42] there's no speaking off a natural
[35:43] mountain today it's off a spiritual
[35:45] Mountain from Heaven is that right
[35:48] praise God let's read a few more of
[35:49] those verse 26 so what a what a a
[35:52] striking convicting passage of scripture
[35:55] here whose voice then shook the Earth
[35:59] but now he hath promised saying yet once
[36:01] more I will shake not the Earth only but
[36:03] also heaven and this word yet once more
[36:06] signified the removing of those things
[36:08] that are
[36:09] shaken as of the things that are made
[36:11] that those things which cannot be shaken
[36:14] May remain wherefore we receiving a
[36:16] kingdom which cannot be
[36:19] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[36:22] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[36:25] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[36:29] fire amen let's just bow our heads if
[36:31] you have a need on your heart just make
[36:32] it known unto the Lord as we look at the
[36:33] three showdowns here this morning
[36:36] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[36:37] your mercy we thank you for your love
[36:39] dear God here we are Lord in your
[36:41] presence Lord humbly we come to you
[36:43] Jesus we ask Lord that Lord you speak to
[36:45] our hearts help us not to refuse the
[36:47] word that we hear from heaven and Lord
[36:50] your Prophet told us it's it's quite
[36:53] simple to know whether it's heaven or
[36:55] man speaking he he said if it's in the
[36:57] word of God for our day then it's Heaven
[36:59] speaking Lord God so help us Jesus to
[37:03] listen to that still Small Voice dear
[37:05] God help us to hear from Heaven Lord the
[37:07] Bible said we are come to that mountain
[37:09] Lord uh Lord spiritually dear God and we
[37:12] know that mountain will come sometime
[37:14] soon dear God whether in the next year
[37:16] five years 100 years we don't know no
[37:19] man knows the day or the hour but that
[37:21] mountain that city is coming Lord It's
[37:23] prepared Lord God and we're looking for
[37:25] it just Abraham looked for it all those
[37:29] years ago dear God speak to us now bless
[37:31] us dear God in thy presence in Jesus
[37:33] Christ's name the church said amen God
[37:35] bless you being there praise
[37:43] God so i' like to look at the three
[37:46] showdowns by the grace of the Lord
[37:51] [Music]
[37:52] um I'd like to uh I have a slideshow so
[37:56] I'm going to pull that up in just a
[37:57] moment here so sister man can you put on
[37:59] input HDMI number two
[38:02] there I like to just show some of these
[38:04] quotations by the grace of the
[38:07] Lord
[38:11] okay okay everybody you see that now I
[38:13] want to start with the Mount Zion so we
[38:15] can understand that by God's grace
[38:18] that's okay no problem my phone was
[38:21] ringing up here I were trying to get
[38:22] people to church and I forgot to silence
[38:24] my phone did everybody forgive me by
[38:25] God's grace I didn't mean to fall short
[38:27] there I just forgot to turn off the
[38:29] sounds we're trying to get Joseph here
[38:30] Joseph Candy by God's grace he wanted to
[38:33] come to church here so bang was going to
[38:35] pick him up on the way here so praise
[38:37] God I trust that they'll get here by
[38:39] God's grace so let's look at these three
[38:43] showdowns by the grace of the Lord how
[38:45] many know we're coming to a showdown
[38:46] praise God we're coming to a time when
[38:49] when God is going to prove who's God
[38:51] Amen aren't you glad my heart my heart
[38:53] bleeds every day because I see man
[38:55] exalting man right men wanting men to
[38:58] rule men thinking they can change things
[39:00] men thinking they can bring a time of
[39:02] Peace men thinking they can bring about
[39:05] uh you know food for everybody and solve
[39:07] all the Earth's problems and brother Ram
[39:09] plainly tells us that n none of the
[39:11] problems are going to stop or solve
[39:13] until Jesus Christ comes back amen he's
[39:15] the one who's coming back to solve all
[39:17] the problems so we want to uh uh look at
[39:20] that and uh Minister on that here this
[39:22] morning by the grace of the Lord so um
[39:26] let's look here I'm I'm pulling this
[39:28] thought here out of um the portion where
[39:31] brother brandom uh is told by the Lord
[39:34] he senses the holy spirit in his study
[39:36] and he senses the Lord tell them pick up
[39:38] your pen and write now how many have
[39:40] read that recently anyone read it
[39:41] recently at all or listen to it maybe
[39:43] nobody okay uh so I want to take a
[39:46] little bit and read some of that not all
[39:48] of it it might take about 15 minutes if
[39:49] I just read it straight but I want to
[39:51] read part of it and I think you'll be
[39:53] blessed by here this morning by God's
[39:55] grace but I want you to hear hear what
[39:56] brother Bram said here's what he said
[39:58] about this inspiration he said I'm going
[39:59] to read something now now if you know if
[40:02] you know spoken word Original Seed it's
[40:04] almost six or seven hours long there's
[40:06] two parts and you put them together I
[40:08] think the first one's like two and a
[40:09] half and the next one's like three and a
[40:10] half or four almost four brother R
[40:13] preaches almost six hours on the spoken
[40:15] word is original seat and it's very
[40:17] Elementary but it's very powerful
[40:19] because he goes back to the beginning to
[40:20] Genesis to show how God's power is in
[40:23] his spoken word that's how he starts
[40:25] everything that's how he does everything
[40:27] and it shows us the power of the spoken
[40:28] word in our lives as you progress and
[40:31] listen through the message what you'll
[40:32] find is that brother Bram said there was
[40:33] three seeds planted in the entire praise
[40:36] God there was a seed planted to the
[40:38] Evangelical Church just like there was
[40:39] three Messengers that went down to visit
[40:41] lot okay I'm sorry that went to visit
[40:43] Abraham sorry two went down to visit lot
[40:46] there's three Messengers right that went
[40:48] to see Abraham God himself in a fleshly
[40:51] uh uh Corporal body there I'm sorry
[40:53] theophany uh and then you had the two
[40:55] angels okay okay and brother B said the
[40:57] two angels represented the two
[40:59] Messengers to different types of
[41:00] churches he said one of the Angels
[41:03] represented Billy Graham to the
[41:04] evangelicals right and he said the other
[41:07] Angel represented all Roberts to the
[41:09] Pentecostals he said but I said there is
[41:11] another messenger he said it's God Among
[41:14] Us that is the third messenger amen it's
[41:17] God in flesh revealing the thoughts
[41:19] intents to our hearts so he doesn't
[41:20] specifically say it but his ministry was
[41:23] the third planting amen it was the third
[41:25] messenger was Christ in flesh planting
[41:28] the sea now church we can look back now
[41:30] that was
[41:31] 1962 we can look back now over 50 years
[41:34] later and we can see how what the fruits
[41:36] have produced right do you know any
[41:39] evangelicals that's what kind of fruit
[41:41] they produced you know any Pentecostals
[41:43] I got family that are Pentecostals I
[41:45] visited a Pentecostal Church in June I
[41:47] see what it's producing praise the Lord
[41:50] how about the third seed how about God
[41:52] look at churches that believe the
[41:54] message that really believe it what are
[41:56] they producing they're producing another
[41:58] book of Acts church amen hallelujah they
[42:01] are church we are amen we're a part of
[42:04] that amen we just must yield and be in
[42:06] the plan of God Amen it's this is what
[42:08] it's produced so look now 50 some years
[42:11] later look what each seed has produced
[42:13] we're longing and hungering I say like
[42:16] this we're hungering and thirsting for
[42:18] more righteousness amen that should be
[42:20] your desire to come to church you come
[42:22] here because you desire to be fed on the
[42:24] word of God desire toink of the Holy
[42:26] Spirit isn't that why you come we are
[42:29] hungering and thirsting for
[42:30] righteousness now most people are
[42:31] hungering and thirsty on Prosperity
[42:34] that's why they go to church to be more
[42:35] prosperous they think every Christian
[42:37] must be rich and that's not God's plan
[42:39] right that's what they think uh like I
[42:42] heard a friend of mine he's a t I have a
[42:44] friend of mine who's now a minor TBN
[42:47] preacher I got some of these friends we
[42:50] don't C we just talk on Facebook but he
[42:52] preached on Daniel and he said how every
[42:55] Christian today should strive for an
[42:57] excellent appearance because he
[43:08] talk he said all Christians Choice wear
[43:10] the best clothes they have and all these
[43:12] things and then and if you're not a
[43:14] millionaire dress like You're Gonna Be A
[43:15] Millionaire he said I see many CEOs out
[43:17] there in the audience I don't maybe see
[43:20] any CEOs out there I want to see people
[43:22] that are are are are are LED of God by
[43:25] the Holy Spirit I want to see adopted
[43:26] Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's
[43:28] what I want to see out in the crowd not
[43:30] necessarily CEOs but I want to see Sons
[43:33] and Daughters who know the word and that
[43:35] are literally hungry and thirsty for the
[43:37] spiritual food of God Amen they Hunger
[43:40] for More of the word they can't get
[43:42] enough of the word brother R said that's
[43:44] one way to know you got the Holy Ghost
[43:46] when you're in the word all the way amen
[43:49] Church let's be in the word all the way
[43:50] praise God and brother Gabe last week so
[43:53] inspired me I was so inspired uh you
[43:55] know because he said a few things and I
[43:57] thought my I really enjoyed that he said
[43:59] and i' I've said this before too um but
[44:02] he was talking about how we should not
[44:03] be scared of the Book of Revelation so
[44:05] that's why tonight I'm G to preach on
[44:06] the Book of Revelation I preached on
[44:08] over the last few months I preached on
[44:09] the Seven Seals the Thunders I preached
[44:11] on seven Thunders and some of the other
[44:13] things for Revelation uh oh the Legacy
[44:15] in church age I preached on that we
[44:17] should not be scared of that so if
[44:19] you're hungering for that tonight we'll
[44:20] preach on that uh so I really was
[44:22] inspired by that and he said also this
[44:25] he said shouldn't be scared of any two
[44:28] quotes we should expect as a man who
[44:31] would grow in understanding we should
[44:32] expect that he might have thought this
[44:34] one time but perhaps God will give him
[44:36] more Revelation at a later time okay we
[44:39] should expect a man to be able uh have
[44:41] to make not be able but just actually
[44:43] make a mistake or grow in Grace and we
[44:45] should able to look at those and not
[44:47] have it cause us to hate one another but
[44:50] love one another and just wait on God
[44:52] Amen and just wait for God to reveal his
[44:55] truth about those quotes and sometimes
[44:57] you know some people have disagreed with
[44:59] me I preach on you know ministers
[45:00] marriage requirements and different
[45:02] things where I've tried to bring the
[45:03] balance on quotes because you have
[45:04] quotes on both sides praise God there's
[45:06] how many topics like that and we just
[45:08] try to stand in between but the worst
[45:10] thing to do is get a chip on our
[45:12] shoulders and be arrogant about anything
[45:14] like we know all about it amen praise
[45:16] God it's not arrogance or things like
[45:18] that that's GNA bring us together it's
[45:20] divine love that's going to bring us
[45:21] together and let's let's keep the majors
[45:24] the majors and let's keep the minors the
[45:26] minors amen that's that's our like I
[45:28] said a few weeks ago uh we were
[45:30] preaching on the tongue a few Sundays
[45:31] ago that's the struggle with uh the
[45:34] message people God has revealed so much
[45:36] to us we got to be careful not to get a
[45:38] critical or arrogant spirit because
[45:40] Church honestly spiritually we know more
[45:43] than most
[45:45] churches praise God we honestly know
[45:48] much more than them and the critical
[45:50] spirit just looks to point out
[45:52] everybody's faults rather than bring
[45:54] them to repentance amen
[45:56] but if you but if you're just trying to
[45:58] correct somebody and you're actually
[45:59] help them along to learn more and gently
[46:02] the Bible said restore them in meekness
[46:04] and instruct them in meekness and all
[46:06] these things and and someone who's got a
[46:08] gift that's apt to do that instead of
[46:10] just pointing fingers at them we should
[46:12] point to the word right and show them
[46:14] how to get right with God Amen
[46:17] Hallelujah that's what we got to be
[46:18] careful in the message not make sure
[46:20] we're not as critical but we're more
[46:22] patient praise God and we should be more
[46:25] loving and that's what I struggle with
[46:27] that's what you struggle with many times
[46:28] sometimes you know the enemy will try to
[46:29] battle us with being critical of other
[46:31] people and I haven't got that message I
[46:32] have a whole message on the critical
[46:34] spirit I'll get to that sometime soon
[46:36] but I just felt impressed to preach this
[46:38] this morning so I want to just look at
[46:40] this here now he stops that paragraph
[46:42] now that's a lot of paragraphs 413
[46:44] that's a lot of
[46:45] paragraphs I want you to listen real
[46:47] closely this here's what the spirit said
[46:50] pick up the pen I'd have to leave some
[46:53] of it go but I've got to bring some of
[46:55] it to
[46:56] you all right now next he says this now
[46:59] this is in the middle of him reading
[47:01] this statement about uh pick up your pen
[47:04] and write he stops here he says Now by
[47:07] waiting I'm sorry but the waiting was
[47:09] not by Moses for the people to get ready
[47:11] to receive Moses Moses thought the
[47:12] children would understand that he was
[47:14] sent brother man stops and says I never
[47:16] wrote it he did so it is now amen I just
[47:21] want to just get you to see that brother
[47:23] vom stops and says I never wrote this he
[47:26] wrote this praise God I want you to
[47:29] notice this even my brother I want to
[47:31] just State this if you read this portion
[47:33] of pick up your pen and write if you
[47:35] read this in the church age book there
[47:37] are some slight variations because
[47:39] brother Bram just made a few reading
[47:40] mistakes he just read the wrong words he
[47:42] injects some of his own thoughts so when
[47:43] it actually gets to the church age book
[47:45] there are some slight differences just
[47:46] so you know because I I read something
[47:48] I'm like huh I never read that so I went
[47:50] back and che check the church age book
[47:51] and there was a few different variations
[47:53] some different words like he switched up
[47:55] former and r a few times and different
[47:57] things like that you know he says a word
[47:59] over and over again and reads the wrong
[48:00] word in the text okay so let's let him
[48:02] be human praise God but notice where did
[48:04] he get this writing from he got it he
[48:06] said the Holy Spirit told me to pick up
[48:08] my pen and WR amen now I want to read a
[48:13] portion of that the pickup in pen and
[48:15] write like I said it would probably take
[48:16] me about oh 15 minutes but I'm not going
[48:19] to take the full time on that because I
[48:21] want to get to the part about the
[48:22] showdowns okay so at the beginning
[48:24] brother BR begins laying uh Genesis 1:1
[48:27] how there's a law of reproduction every
[48:29] seed will produce of its own kind praise
[48:31] God and he speaks about that and he
[48:34] talks about how Christ or Adam was a
[48:35] spoken word uh seed of God and he was
[48:39] given a bride speaking of Eve and how
[48:40] she fell by falling on the word of God
[48:44] okay then he goes into the harmony
[48:47] between Christ and the father amen uh
[48:50] and then he said talk then he gets into
[48:52] the bride he said those in the bride
[48:54] only do his will no one can persuade
[48:57] them different they have thus sayi the
[49:00] Lord or they keep still then they will
[49:02] do the works of God for it is it is
[49:04] himself in them continuing his word to
[49:07] fulfill as he did complete I'm sorry as
[49:10] he did complete in his days all right
[49:13] now next he goes to Joshua and Caleb I
[49:16] want you to hear this quote now brother
[49:17] Ram said the Holy Spirit wrote this look
[49:20] what he says about Joshua and Caleb now
[49:22] let us stand like Joshua and
[49:24] Caleb
[49:26] as we see the promised land coming in
[49:28] sight it's nearing the time to be given
[49:31] Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and
[49:34] represents the promised end time leader
[49:36] to take the church over Caleb represents
[49:40] the True Believer who stayed with Joshua
[49:43] amen so which one do we represent we
[49:46] represent
[49:47] Caleb praise God but brother man said
[49:50] Joshua represents the end time leader to
[49:53] take the church over into the pro proed
[49:56] land
[49:57] Hallelujah that's what he said
[50:00] there he said now notice God did not
[50:04] move Israel until his own appointed
[50:07] time Joshua waited for that time no
[50:10] matter how much people might have said
[50:11] God gave us the land the promise let us
[50:13] go now and take it they might have said
[50:15] Joshua you lost your commission you're
[50:17] all washed up why are you not doing
[50:19] something you used to know thus say the
[50:20] Lord in a moment and what the will of
[50:22] God was but the wise God said Prophet
[50:26] knew the promise of God but also knew to
[50:28] wait for that promise a clear-cut
[50:30] decision from God for this time and when
[50:33] the time come God gave it to Joshua and
[50:36] he stayed with him by the word for he
[50:38] could not trust others he could not
[50:40] trust him so will it repeat again amen
[50:45] now brother's typing this to himself
[50:47] because in this time they were saying
[50:48] brother brandom you know your meetings
[50:49] are getting smaller why are you what are
[50:50] you doing why you preaching against stop
[50:53] preaching against the women wearing
[50:54] makeup and the water bapt AP ISM in
[50:55] Jesus name so he's saying here that
[50:58] every Prophet has to wait upon thus
[51:00] sayith the Lord or they they're just
[51:02] silent and God help us to do the same
[51:05] praise God help us to wait upon the Lord
[51:07] until we know we've got a clear-cut
[51:09] decision from God Amen Hallelujah we'll
[51:12] go far than the Lord if we do that wait
[51:15] on his timing wait on his words now he
[51:17] goes into Moses and says the same thing
[51:19] he can only come at the right time then
[51:21] he goes into Joshua I'm sorry Elijah and
[51:24] says the same thing yeah to place
[51:25] everything back in order before the fire
[51:27] fell the 12 Stones then he goes into
[51:30] John the
[51:31] Baptist now I'm going to get to the part
[51:34] where he gets to our
[51:36] day
[51:39] now here's what I want to read so now
[51:41] everybody can read I'm sorry it's so
[51:42] small I thought I thought that thought
[51:44] would be good but anyway uh if you don't
[51:46] like it maybe just listen here okay now
[51:48] here's where it picks it up now he's
[51:50] coming down to where Elijah and Ahab
[51:52] typed out America today he saids says he
[51:55] has to be for that is history repeating
[51:57] itself from the time of Ahab he's
[52:01] speaking about how his ministry
[52:02] brother's Ministry would be here at the
[52:03] end time because Elijah was there when
[52:05] Ahab was
[52:07] there Israel's history under Ahab is
[52:10] happening right here in America where
[52:12] the prophet of Malachi appears praise
[52:16] God
[52:17] Amen as Israel left Egypt to Worship in
[52:21] Freedom pushed out the natives raised up
[52:24] a with great leaders like David Etc and
[52:28] put the and then put an Ahab on the
[52:30] throne with a jezebel behind him to
[52:33] direct so have we done the very same
[52:35] thing in America praise God I heard a
[52:38] quote I saw a quote this week brother
[52:40] Bram said I don't care if you put an
[52:41] Abraham Lincoln in the in the white
[52:43] house right praise God I don't care if
[52:45] you put another George Washington in he
[52:47] said this nation's gone you know
[52:50] sometimes church I know these are silly
[52:51] thoughts but I think maybe I should run
[52:53] for office because I'll Stand for the
[52:55] word and and then I read these things
[52:57] and I'm like you know because you're so
[52:58] you just want to see somebody stand up
[52:59] upon the word of God but brother said
[53:01] this he all his friends he knew that God
[53:03] the politics got corrupted by it right
[53:06] because it's all moneymaking system but
[53:09] you know in my like I said I love
[53:10] America I love freedom and all these
[53:12] things like that and I think well maybe
[53:13] I should run for office can you imagine
[53:15] me running for
[53:17] office but he says that he said he said
[53:19] it's going to fall now Israel coming out
[53:22] and taking over a land and kicking out
[53:24] the inhabit
[53:25] brother Bram said was a type of America
[53:28] doing the same today our forefathers
[53:31] left this land to worship and live in
[53:33] Freedom so our forefathers left Great
[53:35] Britain right and some of the other
[53:37] places uh to live in Freedom they came
[53:40] over here for Religious Freedom is that
[53:42] right they pushed back the natives and
[53:45] took over the land amen mighty men like
[53:48] Washington and Lincoln were raised up
[53:50] but after a while other men of such poor
[53:52] caliber succeeded these worthy men that
[53:55] soon and Ahab was sat in the
[53:57] presidential chair with a jezebel behind
[54:01] him to direct him oh my now if you know
[54:04] the quotes what did Brother say who is
[54:06] our modern Ahab anybody know
[54:09] JFK right John vit Jerald Kennedy you
[54:12] know God have mercy on his soul you know
[54:15] he was our modern day Ahab because he
[54:18] claimed to be a believer but behind him
[54:20] was an influential woman named uh his
[54:23] wife right I hate to call names jacn
[54:27] Kennedy behind him now brother Brandon
[54:30] balls balls out uh jacn Kennedy and JFK
[54:33] many times because they're Catholic
[54:36] because they they they don't keep the
[54:37] word of God Jacqueline Kennedy because
[54:39] she started wearing really short skirts
[54:41] as the first lady she cut her hair and
[54:43] wore a lot of makeup as the first lady
[54:45] and brother ra said she's putting a sexy
[54:47] or she's wearing sexy sexy things and
[54:49] putting a spirit on all those women all
[54:51] the women in the nation because they
[54:53] know if the president's wife can do and
[54:54] I can do it that's what they think right
[54:57] but not a real true child of God Amen
[54:59] because we're not ruled by the White
[55:00] House necessarily we're ruled by m Zion
[55:03] is what we're ruled by amen the god of
[55:05] not Zion so that's the beautiful type
[55:08] there that the holy spirit gives to
[55:09] brother Brandon Israel kicking out uh
[55:12] the Hittites amorites was a a
[55:14] foretelling a type of America kicking
[55:17] out the Native Americans sad to say and
[55:19] I know they did some awful things right
[55:21] but not everybody was Godly in that
[55:23] early American people but them work but
[55:26] nevertheless they kicked them out but
[55:29] eventually an evil ruler came and now
[55:32] what did this allow if you know history
[55:35] the pilgrims left to escape uh the Ang
[55:38] angelican church if you know your
[55:39] history and they were just a offsho of
[55:41] the Catholic so in other words they left
[55:43] to get away from Catholicism or
[55:46] denominationalism or tradition worship
[55:49] amen or formalism or routine church
[55:52] services where someone told them what to
[55:54] do I shouldn't have to tell everybody to
[55:56] raise your hands right shouldn't have to
[55:57] tell everybody to clap shouldn't have to
[55:59] beg people to come to altar you should
[56:01] hear the voice of God and do what the
[56:02] voice of God tells you to do amen
[56:05] hallelujah it shouldn't be so formal
[56:07] shouldn't be so strict and routine it
[56:09] should be led of the holy spirit amen
[56:11] that's exactly right so the
[56:12] denominational Spirit comes by way of uh
[56:15] of just getting loose getting lukewarm
[56:18] and not following the leadership of the
[56:20] Holy Spirit I'm glad last Sunday we
[56:22] could pray up here for about 45 extra
[56:23] minutes I'm glad at lunch a little late
[56:25] by God's grace I'm glad we had that
[56:27] start second service at 5:00 P p.m.
[56:29] instead of 4 p.m. because we're praying
[56:31] crying and trying to get people to
[56:32] Christ amen hallelujah I appreciate all
[56:35] your flexibility for that by God's grace
[56:37] I know they're long services oh but
[56:38] church we got to be open to just having
[56:40] the spirit move as he wants to move amen
[56:44] hallelujah now next here's why I start
[56:47] using some color to kind of emphasize a
[56:49] few things now it is at such a time as
[56:51] this that the messenger of Malachi must
[56:54] come did he come yes he came he came and
[56:58] went but he came at the right time
[57:00] because that Ahab who was supposed to be
[57:02] a Christian right the leaders are
[57:04] supposed to be Christians all right but
[57:06] he brought in a jezebel a woman that was
[57:09] all painted up with and makeups
[57:10] condemned in the Bible we know that it's
[57:13] condemned but they brought in a loose
[57:16] Spirit towards the things of God they
[57:18] brought in h Catholic ideas they brought
[57:20] in the influence of well it doesn't
[57:22] matter but the whole reason our nation
[57:24] was started was to get away from that
[57:25] nonsense but then the nation backslides
[57:28] and lets it all back in there's no hope
[57:30] for America right as a whole there's
[57:32] only hope for individuals like you and I
[57:34] who can stand upon the word believe the
[57:36] Bible is that right not compromise
[57:39] believe exactly what the word of God
[57:41] says and keep standing like pillars in
[57:43] the church amen living for Jesus Christ
[57:47] amen now I want you to watch these words
[57:50] now I'm gonna put a I'm G to just show
[57:52] something after this just some something
[57:53] simple here
[57:55] then in the latter rain will come a
[57:58] Mount Carmel
[58:01] Showdown so brother R was supposed to
[58:03] come and then there would be a Mount
[58:05] Caramel Showdown now what it means is
[58:06] Mount Zion it just means another
[58:08] Showdown because Mount Caramel happened
[58:09] in Elijah's day right you later on the
[58:11] Holy Spirit identifies the three
[58:12] showdowns he's saying there must come a
[58:14] showdown watch this carefully now to see
[58:18] in the word this subject has been on my
[58:19] mind for about six months and I've just
[58:21] carefully tried to go back and read the
[58:23] scriptures that's I was waiting for the
[58:25] right time I believe this is the right
[58:26] time watch this carefully so if the Holy
[58:29] Spirit wrote this it's got to be in the
[58:31] word how many believe that if brother
[58:33] Brandon wrote there might be
[58:34] contradictions and things like that but
[58:36] if the Holy Spirit wrote it it's got to
[58:38] be in the word because brother said the
[58:39] Holy Ghost will only point you to the
[58:42] word only amen it won't point it won't
[58:45] point you to any man it'll only point
[58:47] you to the word of God Amen
[58:51] Hallelujah he said John was the
[58:53] Forerunner of Malachi for now we're
[58:55] getting some new language Lin
[58:57] forerunners we're getting some language
[58:59] you have to understand so John planted
[59:03] the former rain and was rejected by the
[59:06] organizations of his day all right Jesus
[59:10] came and had a mount Transfiguration
[59:12] Showdown so John was the Forerunner for
[59:15] the former Reign and Jesus on Mount
[59:17] Transfiguration was the what anybody
[59:20] know lad
[59:22] rain he said now the second Forerunner
[59:26] of Christ will sew or plant for the
[59:29] latter Reign who is the second
[59:30] Forerunner of Christ does anybody know
[59:32] brother ramam right John the Baptist was
[59:35] the first Forerunner brother ramam was
[59:37] the second Forerunner of Christ second
[59:39] coming so brother ramam says he was
[59:42] supposed to plant for the latter rain he
[59:45] said he was gonna plant seeds for the
[59:47] latter rain that's exactly what he said
[59:49] church amen and now we can look back 50
[59:51] some years we can see what the seed has
[59:54] produced we're a Bible preaching church
[59:56] we don't add denominations we don't add
[59:58] Creeds we don't give you a license to
[1:00:00] sin but we do give you freedom to
[1:00:03] worship and love God and if you love
[1:00:05] Christ you'll keep his commands amen
[1:00:07] that's what we give you Freedom at this
[1:00:08] church no one leads me no man on earth
[1:00:11] Isaiah Brooks or Craig Mo no man leads
[1:00:14] me the Holy Ghost leads me we're a
[1:00:16] sovereign church we should all be led by
[1:00:18] the Holy Ghost our headquarters is
[1:00:20] heaven
[1:00:22] amen exactly right Church
[1:00:26] but the second Forerunner will s for the
[1:00:28] latter
[1:00:29] Reign Jesus Will Be The
[1:00:33] Showdown and Jesus is the word so The
[1:00:37] Showdown is going to be who has the word
[1:00:40] who really has
[1:00:42] Jesus praise God that's going to be The
[1:00:45] Showdown for he will come back come to
[1:00:49] back up his word I'm so glad he backs up
[1:00:51] his word hallelujah and take is Bride In
[1:00:55] The Rapture so there might come a time
[1:00:58] while we're waiting for him to back us
[1:00:59] up okay Lord back us up here Lord was
[1:01:02] just waiting to back us up please back
[1:01:04] us up Lord things are changing politics
[1:01:06] are changing laws are changing Lord
[1:01:08] please back us up and church he going to
[1:01:10] back up his children he backed up Moses
[1:01:13] praise God he backed up Elijah he backed
[1:01:15] up all these men of God he backed up
[1:01:17] brother R he'll back up us we just got
[1:01:19] to stay with the word because God can
[1:01:21] only back up his promised word amen
[1:01:25] now look at the Holy Spirit writes the
[1:01:27] first Showdown was what Mount
[1:01:30] carel the second was the mount
[1:01:34] Transfiguration and the third will be
[1:01:37] Mount Zion will be hasn't happened yet
[1:01:39] it will be when will that Showdown be it
[1:01:42] will be in the latter rain in the latter
[1:01:45] the latter rain is a time period praise
[1:01:48] God brother said it'll be short he said
[1:01:50] but it'll be for the elect Hallelujah
[1:01:53] won't be a public show it'll be for the
[1:01:55] elect hallelujah amen now here's a
[1:01:58] little graphic there's no movement on it
[1:02:00] brother Gabe is real good at that he's
[1:02:01] got movements I thought I need to ask
[1:02:03] him for some advice on how to do this
[1:02:04] better but here's your three three
[1:02:06] mountains Mount Caramel which was a
[1:02:08] physical mountain now brother R never
[1:02:10] said anything about a 4Runner for that
[1:02:12] one I can't find a forerunner for the
[1:02:14] mount carel Showdown so I didn't put it
[1:02:16] up there because brother didn't say it
[1:02:18] okay but he said Elijah was the man at
[1:02:21] The Showdown and it was a showdown
[1:02:23] against Bale
[1:02:25] nalism that was actually in the Israel
[1:02:28] they were the head of Israel right so
[1:02:31] the capital the government had a baale
[1:02:33] worship a false worship right and Elijah
[1:02:37] condemned that he was the man of God to
[1:02:38] take that out okay now the second Mount
[1:02:41] Transfiguration now we got scriptures
[1:02:42] we'll go after this let me take off my
[1:02:44] jacket getting hot now I just to try to
[1:02:47] take what brother Ram said now look at
[1:02:49] the mount
[1:02:52] Transfiguration John the Baptist was the
[1:02:54] for Forerunner brother bam said he's the
[1:02:57] Forerunner and he and the former Reign
[1:02:59] fell during his ministry praise God to
[1:03:02] the first Reign what did he do he
[1:03:04] rebuked organizations that's what it
[1:03:06] said and pick up your pen and write
[1:03:07] that's what he said now the latter reign
[1:03:10] of this was Jesus himself on Mount
[1:03:13] Transfiguration brother M said and it
[1:03:16] was a showdown with the denominational
[1:03:18] spirit and we'll show that in the Bible
[1:03:20] we'll get our Bibles handy just a little
[1:03:21] bit by God's grace in other words it
[1:03:23] came to time where there's all this
[1:03:25] religious disturbance God has to show
[1:03:27] which side he's on praise God God's
[1:03:30] going to show which side we're on Amen
[1:03:32] is that right we'll either be on the
[1:03:34] right side or the wrong side the only
[1:03:36] way we'll be on the right side is if we
[1:03:37] keep the word of God Amen now this is
[1:03:40] the one we're coming to a Mount Zion
[1:03:43] Showdown it's not a physical Mountain
[1:03:45] yet right but this showdown will be a
[1:03:47] spiritual Mountain praise God and what
[1:03:51] what brother say what is the attraction
[1:03:53] on the mountain it's God fulfilling his
[1:03:55] word hallelujah so that will be God
[1:03:59] fulfilling his word right at the time of
[1:04:01] the Rapture right before the Rapture
[1:04:03] there will be a Mount Zion a spiritual
[1:04:05] Showdown where God is fulfilling his
[1:04:07] word what is he doing he's finishing the
[1:04:09] Gentile dispensation praise God the last
[1:04:12] names that are on the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:14] Life are realizing their names are
[1:04:16] written there before the foundation of
[1:04:17] the world and he God is getting ready to
[1:04:19] be finished and soon he'll turn to the
[1:04:21] Gentiles but he's got to show his mighty
[1:04:23] power one more time it is Gentile church
[1:04:26] and then the Rapture goes and then we'll
[1:04:28] ever be with the Lord Comfort Your Heart
[1:04:30] Church with those words let it comfort
[1:04:32] you this morning amen don't be
[1:04:34] discouraged be comforted the Rapture is
[1:04:36] a comfort not something to be scared
[1:04:38] about it's Comfort to the believer Glory
[1:04:43] Hallelujah he said Comfort one another
[1:04:45] with these
[1:04:46] words now this is where the Holy Spirit
[1:04:49] brought the parallel between forerunners
[1:04:52] and then the actual messenger or the one
[1:04:53] that was was to come so brother Ram was
[1:04:56] the former Reign or was the Forerunner
[1:04:59] to Jesus and then he rebuke organization
[1:05:02] if you don't know listen to indictment
[1:05:05] 1963 he said I condemn every one of you
[1:05:08] or I indict every one of you or
[1:05:09] ministers in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:11] for crucifying the word of God to your
[1:05:13] generation you see the water baptism you
[1:05:16] see Divine Healing and you say the days
[1:05:17] of Miracles has passed he said I indict
[1:05:19] you in the name of Jesus
[1:05:21] Christ that's a real man of God who
[1:05:23] knows what he's talking about
[1:05:25] now Jesus Will in the latter Reign Jesus
[1:05:27] will be there for the latter Reign and
[1:05:29] to show down with denominations and
[1:05:31] Creeds who is our Real Enemy Rome but
[1:05:34] who is Rome going to work with to try to
[1:05:36] destroy us the denominational
[1:05:39] churches and think about some of our
[1:05:41] friends right now that are in
[1:05:42] denominational churches if they don't
[1:05:44] leave that system they'll be the ones
[1:05:46] coming after us if God allows it in our
[1:05:48] day that's right the ones we love the
[1:05:51] ones we say are foolish virgin we better
[1:05:53] be careful how we right we want to hope
[1:05:55] everybody goes to heaven remember that
[1:05:57] message a few weeks ago scarcely saved
[1:05:59] and scarcely lost the foolish virgin is
[1:06:01] barely even saved like lot lot was
[1:06:04] barely saved by a matter of we'd say
[1:06:07] maybe yards or feet or something he's
[1:06:09] barely saved Noah was barely saved right
[1:06:13] Enoch went up way before he was scarcely
[1:06:15] saved that's exactly right now does that
[1:06:20] help does that help by God's grace does
[1:06:22] that help okay
[1:06:25] I don't know have you ever heard a
[1:06:26] sermon on the three showdowns I never
[1:06:27] even heard one did anybody ever hear one
[1:06:29] okay praise God because I was thinking
[1:06:31] well this might be kind of new to
[1:06:31] everybody I try to go slow but slow is a
[1:06:34] hard gear for me to get into okay now he
[1:06:37] keeps now this is more right after he
[1:06:39] talks about uh the three showdowns this
[1:06:41] is right next in the pick up your pen
[1:06:43] and write the last day Messenger will
[1:06:46] appear in God's appointed time it is the
[1:06:49] end time now as all know for Israel's in
[1:06:52] the Homeland talks about the Fig Tree
[1:06:54] putting forth its Bud right the Fig Tre
[1:06:57] is Israel Israel is putting forth more
[1:06:59] people it's putting forth a new
[1:07:00] generation right that's happening in
[1:07:02] Israel right now praise God any time now
[1:07:05] he will come according to Malachi when
[1:07:07] we see him he will not I'm sorry he will
[1:07:09] be dedicated to the word he will be
[1:07:12] indicated or pointed out in the word
[1:07:13] revelation 10:7 and God will vindicate
[1:07:16] his ministry he will preach the truth as
[1:07:19] did Elijah and be ready for the Mount
[1:07:21] Zion show down praise God
[1:07:25] amen hallelujah now let's look at get
[1:07:28] your Bibles handy if you can I'm G to
[1:07:29] have some of you read some verses if
[1:07:30] some of the brothers are ever feels
[1:07:32] comfortable let's look at the Bible
[1:07:34] conditions of the last I'm sorry of the
[1:07:36] past two showdowns then we can kind of
[1:07:38] look at the conditions of our show doubt
[1:07:41] by the grace of the
[1:07:42] Lord
[1:07:44] hallelujah and now church I'm sure you
[1:07:46] feel the same way as I do my there's got
[1:07:48] to come a reckoning day there's got to
[1:07:50] come a showdown where we where where God
[1:07:52] shows that we are the true believers now
[1:07:54] God does in our daily lives we can see
[1:07:55] you know how God vindicates our lives
[1:07:57] keeps us holy Walk In The Word but
[1:07:59] there's got to come a showdown for that
[1:08:01] to prove that denominations if they keep
[1:08:03] going the way they're going Christ is
[1:08:04] not with them they put him outside the
[1:08:07] door and the church said right he is
[1:08:11] outside the door he's trying to get in
[1:08:13] but their Creeds and denominations and
[1:08:16] ways of man and worldliness will not let
[1:08:18] him
[1:08:19] in look at I'm just going to call one
[1:08:21] name one Ministry ever seen maybe I have
[1:08:23] call there's a very famous name uh
[1:08:25] Church in Australia and they're really
[1:08:28] popular with songs okay I'm not going to
[1:08:30] name the name I'm trying not to call
[1:08:32] name I know the holy spirit will
[1:08:33] sometimes but I'm trying not to okay and
[1:08:35] just about 10 years ago they started off
[1:08:37] with beautiful songs we sing some of
[1:08:39] them here and they're absolutely
[1:08:40] beautiful but last Christmas I don't
[1:08:42] know if you saw it was all over YouTube
[1:08:44] and all these things like that they did
[1:08:45] a Christmas special and they they sang
[1:08:48] uh was it away in the manger I don't
[1:08:49] know which I ask my
[1:08:51] wife yeah it might have been away in the
[1:08:53] manger and you know the sleep in
[1:08:55] Heavenly peace it's supposed to be a
[1:08:56] real sweet song church God we can you
[1:08:58] can see it on their website I went to
[1:09:00] their website you can see it on their
[1:09:01] website they dressed up men and women in
[1:09:03] the Roaring 20s uh kind of clothing
[1:09:06] which is short skirts and bobbed hair
[1:09:08] and painted them all up and they sped up
[1:09:10] the the pace of that song and danced
[1:09:12] around in sexual ways all around during
[1:09:14] that whole song A A Manger that was
[1:09:16] their Christmas celebration now you're
[1:09:18] tell and someone would try to tell us
[1:09:20] well God's in Hill song God's in Hill
[1:09:22] song God is not in Hill song
[1:09:24] right go call again forgive me God's not
[1:09:27] in that right now they might catch
[1:09:29] inspiration or anointing but the rain
[1:09:31] falls on the just and the unjust the
[1:09:34] gifts and callings of God are without
[1:09:36] repentance be careful what music we
[1:09:38] listen to make sure the songs are really
[1:09:40] humble and sweet that we download to our
[1:09:42] phones is that right because look where
[1:09:44] that spirit in advance in just 10 or 15
[1:09:47] years that Spirit has gone to just real
[1:09:49] humble worship to now it's rock and roll
[1:09:52] and it's roaring 20s and it's uh hip hop
[1:09:54] and all kinds of things like this all
[1:09:56] this evil all this worldliness that
[1:09:58] they're coping and bringing it right
[1:10:00] into the church and the church smiles
[1:10:01] and snaps their fingers and STS their
[1:10:03] feet and they're blind and naked
[1:10:05] miserable wretched and don't even know
[1:10:07] it but the Church of God should have
[1:10:08] such a Holiness such a purity that we
[1:10:11] should feel the presence of God As we
[1:10:12] sing and have no connection to to
[1:10:14] worldliness no connection to
[1:10:16] denominationalism but only sincere love
[1:10:18] for Christ Jesus amen
[1:10:21] amen I'm sorry to call the name there
[1:10:23] but I guess sometimes the Lord does it
[1:10:25] sometimes and I didn't plan to do that
[1:10:27] all right now let's look at bible
[1:10:29] conditions now try to stay with me
[1:10:33] here now we see the following this is
[1:10:35] the mark Mount carel shown if you want
[1:10:37] to write that down you can read it in
[1:10:39] First Kings 18 17 to 46 I read through
[1:10:42] this and took some notes on it and the
[1:10:44] things that were inspired to me after
[1:10:47] reading pick up your pen and write I
[1:10:48] wanted to point these out by God's grace
[1:10:50] look at the conditions uh that were
[1:10:53] taking place at the first
[1:10:55] Showdown number one Elijah uses the I'm
[1:10:59] sorry issues the invitation for The
[1:11:01] Showdown later he said he did it at
[1:11:04] God's word or will so God called The
[1:11:08] Showdown praise the Lord and if you know
[1:11:11] the second one God called that Showdown
[1:11:14] God's inviting for a showdown does that
[1:11:16] remind you of God and
[1:11:18] Magog God calling a showdown where Satan
[1:11:21] tries to Encompass of fire Holy Fire
[1:11:23] comes down from heaven and vindicates
[1:11:25] God's people oh fire always vindicates
[1:11:27] God's people hallelujah Holy Ghost and
[1:11:30] Fire amen the power of God for Holiness
[1:11:33] and separation always vindicates God's
[1:11:36] people so God said I'm tired of this
[1:11:38] nonsense I'm gonna show who my Prophet
[1:11:40] is I'm gonna show who my people are
[1:11:43] let's have a showdown and see who's God
[1:11:46] Amen number two the 450 prophets of Bale
[1:11:49] were gathered okay so their denomination
[1:11:52] their system of worship was gathered
[1:11:53] against Elijah 450 verse one but they
[1:11:57] that's only if you count Elijah what
[1:11:58] about all those angels that were around
[1:12:00] him Hallelujah I imagine Elijah
[1:12:03] outnumbered the prophets amen Church
[1:12:06] Hallelujah now number three I put this
[1:12:09] in red because I want you to see this
[1:12:11] because the showdowns change a little
[1:12:12] bit the first one was a public Showdown
[1:12:16] right and they battled the
[1:12:18] denominational Spirit of the Bale
[1:12:21] prophets and it was forcing a choice
[1:12:24] amen had to make a choice but Elijah
[1:12:27] said choose you this day whom you will
[1:12:29] serve praise God if God be God serve him
[1:12:33] if ba be God serve him but God's GNA
[1:12:35] prove today who it
[1:12:37] is whether Jehovah or baale and it would
[1:12:40] be proven by fire God said I'm goingon
[1:12:42] to show now who it is by fire this
[1:12:44] reminds me of Aaron's Rod that bued
[1:12:46] doesn't it praise God cor and Dayan rise
[1:12:49] up and say we're all holy we can all be
[1:12:51] preachers we can all walk in there we
[1:12:52] can all Minister before for the spirit
[1:12:53] of God and the Bible said Moses and
[1:12:55] Aaron threw them on the ground their
[1:12:57] face on the ground because they knew
[1:12:58] this wasn't of they doing God called
[1:13:00] them to do this it's not a job you want
[1:13:03] to elect yourself for it's a job that
[1:13:05] God's got to call you for it's not a job
[1:13:08] you choose it's a it's a it's a unending
[1:13:10] call of God that God places on your
[1:13:13] heart and you just ha you just have to
[1:13:15] do it can I say it like that you just
[1:13:16] have to do it praise God and if God
[1:13:19] calls you to do it he'll give you Grace
[1:13:20] to do it amen verse four so I'm sorry
[1:13:24] not verse four point four fire fell that
[1:13:26] the people might know that God was the
[1:13:29] Lord okay
[1:13:31] now number five all the people
[1:13:34] acknowledg God as the Lord after the
[1:13:37] fire fell that's a little different too
[1:13:40] that's a because the Rapture is going to
[1:13:41] be a mystery it's going to be a showdown
[1:13:44] between denominations and Creeds and
[1:13:46] Jesus and we're with Jesus right but the
[1:13:48] Rapture is going to be a mystery and
[1:13:50] they're going to say peace and safety
[1:13:51] peace and safety Church they're not even
[1:13:52] going to hardly know that we're gone
[1:13:54] let's just say oh they're a bunch of
[1:13:55] Fanatics they went out to wherever or
[1:13:57] they just who cares they're all moved to
[1:13:58] somewhere
[1:13:59] else but this was uh known to everyone
[1:14:02] here and everybody answered on Israel's
[1:14:05] side and number the last one this all
[1:14:08] happened at the end of the three and a
[1:14:09] half years of famine and doesn't the
[1:14:11] Bible say in the last days there'll be a
[1:14:12] famine land for the hearing of the word
[1:14:14] of God how you know the Bible says that
[1:14:16] this is the time where people will fly
[1:14:18] all over the world trying to hear
[1:14:19] inspired preaching preaching that's
[1:14:21] right with the word and showing you the
[1:14:22] day and hour that you're living in and
[1:14:24] bringing you to to Christ and bringing
[1:14:25] you to Holiness but thank God we just
[1:14:27] got to drive down the road a little bit
[1:14:28] praise God let to fly all over the word
[1:14:31] now you could go to good message
[1:14:32] churches all around the world but God's
[1:14:33] given us one in all these cities we'll
[1:14:35] take advantage of that because this is a
[1:14:37] famine time but we're also hearing the
[1:14:39] word because God sent us spiritual food
[1:14:41] in due season amen glory
[1:14:46] amen now this is the one I want to read
[1:14:48] because some of these might be famili
[1:14:49] I'm sorry uh little maybe new to here
[1:14:51] but let's read more of these by God's
[1:14:52] grace this is the closer one now Mount
[1:14:55] Transfiguration Showdown was Matthew 17
[1:14:59] 1-9 now how many know this was the
[1:15:02] vision Jesus said tell this Vision to no
[1:15:04] man when you come down the mountain
[1:15:07] praise God and if you know the scripture
[1:15:09] God only called up three men to that
[1:15:12] Showdown Christ only called up Peter
[1:15:14] James and John everybody else missed it
[1:15:18] let's go to Luke chapter 9 let's read a
[1:15:19] little bit on Luke chapter 9 I was so
[1:15:21] blessed when I read this yesterday I
[1:15:22] thought oh my if feels like I never read
[1:15:24] this in the whole Bible isn't that how
[1:15:25] you are when you read the Bible you
[1:15:26] forget things and my pops out oh this is
[1:15:28] like it's brand new again
[1:15:31] glorious Luke
[1:15:35] 9 verse
[1:15:36] 27 but amen can you read 27
[1:15:40] 2829 but I tell you the truth there be
[1:15:43] some standing here which shall not taste
[1:15:45] of death till they see the kingdom of
[1:15:47] God and it came to pass about an eight
[1:15:50] days after these saying he took Peter
[1:15:52] and John and jam James and went up unto
[1:15:54] the mountain to pray and as he prayed
[1:15:56] the fashion of his countenance was
[1:15:58] altered and his rment was white and
[1:16:01] glister amen praise God you love that
[1:16:05] look Jesus foretold them he said some of
[1:16:06] you standing here are going to see the
[1:16:08] kingdom of God coming in power and about
[1:16:11] now the other one says after seven days
[1:16:13] so on the Eighth Day praise God the new
[1:16:15] beginning right eight is the new
[1:16:16] beginning the first day of the week on
[1:16:18] the eighth day he takes those three up
[1:16:20] and what are they going up on the
[1:16:21] mountain to do pray
[1:16:23] and as Jesus prays he's transformed oh
[1:16:27] if we could get a revelation of that
[1:16:28] church that as we pray we transform from
[1:16:31] the natural man into a supernatural one
[1:16:35] are you with me church that's why the
[1:16:37] Bible said be transform that word
[1:16:40] transform is the same Greek word for
[1:16:42] Transfiguration praise God you go from
[1:16:45] just regular to shining bright and Glory
[1:16:47] that's what the power of prayer does
[1:16:49] hallelujah it changes your spiritual
[1:16:51] garments if you're down in a scours
[1:16:52] it'll change you as you pray as you get
[1:16:55] in the spirit remember we did the Bible
[1:16:57] study where we build ourselves up on the
[1:16:58] Holy Ghost Brothers remember that we did
[1:17:00] the Bible study that's how you build
[1:17:01] your spiritual muscles up in Christ you
[1:17:03] pray the Holy Spirit and it builds up
[1:17:05] your faith and you become like Christ
[1:17:08] you become shining the glory of God to
[1:17:10] your family and to your
[1:17:12] workplace amen as he prayed the
[1:17:16] Transfiguration happens Hallelujah see
[1:17:19] the power of
[1:17:20] prayer so this was not a public
[1:17:24] Showdown this was a private
[1:17:27] Showdown I know stay with me here okay
[1:17:31] now it was foreshadowing the Rapture
[1:17:34] brother Ram said I'll show you the
[1:17:35] quotes on this because Jesus is
[1:17:37] glorified on this showdown Moses is
[1:17:40] glorified because he was uh he was
[1:17:42] resurrected and Moses represented the
[1:17:45] dead in Christ that rise first at the
[1:17:48] Rapture so this meeting of Moses Elijah
[1:17:50] and Jesus represents the rapture you
[1:17:53] have Jesus and you have the saints that
[1:17:54] are dead resurrected in perfect bodies
[1:17:57] and then Elijah represents the living
[1:18:00] who never died and they get glorified
[1:18:02] bodies as well oh Hallelujah and church
[1:18:06] all those years I went in the
[1:18:07] denominational churches and read the
[1:18:08] mount Transfiguration I never knew I was
[1:18:10] a part of that but brother brand said
[1:18:12] every one of us are a part of that
[1:18:14] scripture Hallelujah I'm a part of that
[1:18:16] word we must see ourselves in that word
[1:18:20] amen hallelujah it's a top of Mount Zion
[1:18:23] right type of Mount Zion so The Showdown
[1:18:27] was private and they battled the
[1:18:29] denominational Spirit of that day now
[1:18:31] let's first read in Finish reading Luke
[1:18:33] nine brother amen read those three okay
[1:18:35] anybody else want to read my children
[1:18:37] ready to read ma Mai can you read 30 31

[1:18:46] 32 in of his he
[1:18:51] should were with him were heavy with
[1:18:54] sleep and then they were awake they saw
[1:18:56] his glory and the two menle with amen
[1:19:00] thank you now this is to help us here
[1:19:02] learn learn this as we pray in the
[1:19:05] spirit it transforms us does it not if
[1:19:07] not we better get back and pray again if
[1:19:10] our prayer is not transforming us
[1:19:11] humbling us making us more like Christ
[1:19:13] then we need to pray again we need to
[1:19:15] start all over right say Our Father
[1:19:18] which are in heaven Hallowed Be Your
[1:19:19] Name we need to start all over right but
[1:19:22] now after he prays and he's transfigured
[1:19:25] God sends these two prophets to him and
[1:19:27] they talk to him they reveal to him
[1:19:30] about the death he's about to accomplish
[1:19:32] they reveal these Messengers reveal more
[1:19:35] about the mystery of his life of his
[1:19:38] future going away time we'd say like
[1:19:40] that oh my Hallelujah but look Jesus
[1:19:43] isn't ready to receive it remember God
[1:19:45] ordains all things Jesus not ready to
[1:19:47] receive it till this time on his Mount
[1:19:48] Transfiguration Showdown God sends and
[1:19:51] look the spirit of Jesus Christ Christ
[1:19:53] is the spirit of what prophecy Jesus is
[1:19:56] being foretold you're going to have to
[1:19:58] go to the Cross you're going to have to
[1:19:59] go die in Jerusalem the The Messengers
[1:20:02] of God come to tell him about his future
[1:20:04] hasn't God done the same for us told us
[1:20:06] about our future praise God oh my we
[1:20:09] just got to stay with the word church

[1:20:32] praise God you ever said something you
[1:20:33] don't didn't even know you
[1:20:35] said hello ever mutter something you're
[1:20:38] like oh did I just say that happens to
[1:20:41] me all the time I'm human right oh I
[1:20:44] didn't mean to say that Mercy I
[1:20:46] sometimes God is my witness even after
[1:20:47] the Holy Ghost people ask me questions
[1:20:49] and I'll tell a lie without even I
[1:20:51] didn't even know I told a lie that's
[1:20:52] wait no no no wait why did I say that
[1:20:54] for because there's sin in this body but
[1:20:58] thank God there's something to catch
[1:20:59] that sin when it comes out like I was
[1:21:01] just telling a wrong date like that was
[1:21:03] last week or oh that was yesterday oh
[1:21:05] why did I say that so Peter utters this
[1:21:08] he seeing all this happen Jesus changes
[1:21:11] as he prays my look at him change oh
[1:21:14] then Moses and Elijah can you imagine
[1:21:15] he's like
[1:21:16] Lord let's build three denominations
[1:21:19] here and he doesn't even know what he's
[1:21:21] saying
[1:21:24] sometimes we'll say some pretty strange
[1:21:25] things won't we but we should be saying
[1:21:27] the right thing he's in the presence of
[1:21:28] two uh two Messengers and Jesus Christ
[1:21:31] God himself he's in the presence of God
[1:21:33] and sometimes he says the wrong thing
[1:21:35] sometimes we say the wrong thing too
[1:21:37] don't
[1:21:38] we but isn't his grace there sufficient
[1:21:40] to help us praise God and church just so
[1:21:42] you know this was after he got the keys
[1:21:44] to the
[1:21:46] kingdom so look everybody falls

[1:21:50] understand what he's saying let's build
[1:21:52] three Tabernacles let let's build three
[1:21:54] churches let's start an
[1:21:56] organization and verse 34 and while thus
[1:21:58] faake there came a cloud and
[1:21:59] overshadowed them and they feared as
[1:22:03] they entered into the
[1:22:06] cloud the Bible said they entered into
[1:22:09] the cloud you ever enter into a cloud
[1:22:11] before just if it's foggy that's

[1:22:28] starts said God starts speaking after
[1:22:29] that he said enough of you the Bible
[1:22:31] says in Matthew 17 that God interrupted
[1:22:34] Peter while he's talking so Peter's like

[1:23:19] to it or the cloud came down to him but
[1:23:21] he said he was caught up in a cloud and

[1:23:51] God and who called this Mount Showdown
[1:23:53] or this uh Mount Transfiguration
[1:23:55] Showdown God himself called The Showdown
[1:23:58] now this was a private Showdown let's go
[1:23:59] to Matthew 17 here I'm doing pretty good

[1:24:20] Spirit now I'm not going to read all
[1:24:23] these but we are going to read chapter
[1:24:24] 17 if you go back and read chapter 16
[1:24:28] Jesus was constantly rebuking the
[1:24:29] Sadducees if you read that okay and also
[1:24:32] the Pharisees in fact the disciples
[1:24:35] Jesus rebukes them in those scriptures
[1:24:37] and and and Jesus says beware the the
[1:24:39] leav of the Pharisees and the disciples
[1:24:41] are so ambiguous to it they're not even
[1:24:43] aware it just goes over their head and
[1:24:44] they're like saying well don't eat their
[1:24:46] bread make sure you guys pack some
[1:24:47] unleavened bread all these things and
[1:24:48] Jesus come back and say it's not natural

[1:25:54] jesuslord it is good for us to be here
[1:25:57] if thou Wilt let us make here three
[1:25:59] Tabernacles one for thee and one for
[1:26:02] Moses and one for Elias praise God can
[1:26:05] you read verse five to you brother thank
[1:26:06] you while he yet spake Behold a bright
[1:26:09] Cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[1:26:12] voice out of the cloud which said this
[1:26:14] is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:26:16] pleased hear ye him amen praise God so
[1:26:21] the battle here is between Jesus what's
[1:26:23] The Showdown who's the battle we saw the
[1:26:25] battling before Was Elijah against the
[1:26:27] Bale prophets what's the battle here
[1:26:30] well brother R tells us what the battle
[1:26:32] is here so I don't see any there's no
[1:26:33] Sadducees here there's no Pharisees
[1:26:36] here there's only three disciples Here
[1:26:40] with Jesus and two prophets what's the
[1:26:42] battle here look at what brother said
[1:26:44] right
[1:26:44] here we claim no glory for our own like
[1:26:49] on Mount Transfiguration where every one
[1:26:51] of us us is represented there so you
[1:26:54] were there you're rep you're you have a
[1:26:55] representation there someone at Mount
[1:26:57] Transfiguration represents you brother
[1:26:59] Benjamin Hallelujah Brother Scott
[1:27:02] somebody represents you brother Sunny
[1:27:04] somebody represents you on Mount
[1:27:05] Transfiguration it's Elijah amen and
[1:27:08] that's wonderful because we're we had
[1:27:10] Elijah Prophet for our day amen there
[1:27:14] was Moses the one that died and raised
[1:27:16] again there was Elijah the quickening
[1:27:18] Saints that'll be caught up in the last
[1:27:20] days oh they see them when they looked
[1:27:23] back they seen Jesus only now I'm going
[1:27:24] to skip past that's that's what I was
[1:27:26] showing brother said it's the Rapture
[1:27:28] now here now here's where he's saying
[1:27:30] what happened to you Pentecostals a few
[1:27:32] years ago you come out of that mess
[1:27:34] called denomination to make yourselves
[1:27:36] Pentecost so he's basically rebuking
[1:27:37] Pentecostalism right the very next quote
[1:27:40] he says now see Dayan if you now read
[1:27:43] number 16 at home if you never read that
[1:27:45] that's where they try to start the
[1:27:46] denomination Kora and daythan say oh
[1:27:49] we're all holy we can all go in the
[1:27:50] holies of holies you Moses and Aaron you
[1:27:52] have to do all the work and that's why
[1:27:54] they fall in their faces in humility uh
[1:27:56] desperation crying out for those men but
[1:27:58] the Bible said they got swallowed up in
[1:27:59] the Earth for trying to take a
[1:28:01] preacher's place right for trying to
[1:28:02] take a prophet's Place God help us to
[1:28:04] find our place and stay right there
[1:28:07] amen now Dayan had an idea that they
[1:28:10] could all make a great religion out of
[1:28:12] it you know even the Apostle Peter had
[1:28:16] that same idea on Mount
[1:28:20] Transfiguration what was the battle on
[1:28:22] Transfiguration the denominational
[1:28:24] spirit that was in The Bride right but
[1:28:27] yet not filled bride praise God it
[1:28:30] wasn't a public show it was a private
[1:28:32] Showdown but God had to interrupt Peter
[1:28:35] in the midst of his denominational
[1:28:36] thinking and say this is not gonna be a
[1:28:38] denomination this is going to be a
[1:28:40] living organism amen
[1:28:43] hallelujah so Peter had the same
[1:28:45] anointing that is that powerful Peter
[1:28:47] had the same denominational spirit that
[1:28:49] cor and Dayan had on him my goodness but
[1:28:53] God had mercy God didn't swallow up
[1:28:55] Peter in the earth God swallow up Peter
[1:28:56] with eternal life hallelujah what Grace
[1:29:00] Grace Grace God's grace more of Grace
[1:29:03] than know marvelous grace of our loving
[1:29:05] Lord amen Grace that exceeds our sin and
[1:29:08] our
[1:29:09] guilt
[1:29:12] hallelujah thank you
[1:29:14] Jesus so can everybody see that now The
[1:29:17] Showdown was between the man who had the
[1:29:19] Keys of the Kingdom he had a
[1:29:21] denominational Fe on him and God had to
[1:29:23] rebuke him and cut him off and reveal
[1:29:25] his word right there so they would know
[1:29:27] and then Jesus said don't tell that
[1:29:28] vision of no man proving again it was a
[1:29:30] private
[1:29:31] Showdown all right praise God I'm coming
[1:29:34] up okay coming up now here's a few more
[1:29:37] things now I said this earlier jesus'
[1:29:39] body change took place during prayer
[1:29:42] praise God remember the prayer on the
[1:29:45] day of Pentecost while they're praying
[1:29:46] what happened the Holy Ghost fell they
[1:29:49] got a change on the inside now not not
[1:29:51] the physical body but they got a soul
[1:29:52] change during prayer the Bible said
[1:29:55] about the ninth hour that was The Hour
[1:29:57] of Prayer and sacrifice in Jerusalem
[1:29:59] where they blow the trumpets and start
[1:30:00] sacrificing that's the same hour the
[1:30:02] Holy Ghost fell amen oh my Hallelujah
[1:30:05] verse five the two prophets spake of
[1:30:08] Jesus death in Jerusalem with him okay
[1:30:14] now let's now let's go back if your
[1:30:16] Bible let's go back we read uh um we
[1:30:19] read uh Hebrews let's go back here if we
[1:30:23] can take scripture let's go to uh
[1:30:25] Galatians 4
[1:30:29] now Galatians 4:25 let's read a few more
[1:30:32] scriptures about about Mount Zion I want
[1:30:34] to show you a few pictures of Mount Zion
[1:30:36] just you get an idea I always wonder
[1:30:37] where is Mount Zion I found out Israel
[1:30:39] has two really big mountains Mount Zion
[1:30:42] is the largest one and then Mount Mariah
[1:30:44] is the second one Mount Mariah is where
[1:30:45] the Temple Mount is that's where Jesus
[1:30:47] was crucified on Mount Mariah okay
[1:30:51] that's where Abraham took Isaac up there
[1:30:52] on Mount Mariah you can read that in
[1:30:54] Genesis that's in
[1:30:55] Genesis and that's why uh you know both
[1:30:57] Muslims and Jews and Christians all
[1:30:59] three of them claim that that's their
[1:31:00] holy
[1:31:01] place that's the H that's the Holy
[1:31:03] Mountain that's where God was dealing
[1:31:05] with Abraham which all three of them say
[1:31:07] they're they a father only Jews and
[1:31:09] Christians are right amen okay so L
[1:31:13] scripture now Galatians 4 now we read
[1:31:16] Hebrews
[1:31:17] 1222 I'm not going to read that again
[1:31:19] but we are come to Mount Zion how many
[1:31:21] know that's right
[1:31:22] and what is Mount Zion it's the Heavenly
[1:31:24] Jerusalem it's the city of the Living
[1:31:26] God which has an innumerable company of
[1:31:28] Angels the New Jerusalem Galatians 4
[1:31:33] verse
[1:31:34] 25 for this AAR is Mount Si in Arabia
[1:31:38] and anth to Jerusalem which now is and
[1:31:42] is in bondage with their children so
[1:31:44] Mount Si represent the Jews under the
[1:31:46] law right but Grace is represented by
[1:31:48] the New Jerusalem verse 26 but Jerusalem
[1:31:50] which is above
[1:31:52] is free which is the mother of us all
[1:31:56] praise God that new city is the mother
[1:31:59] of us all because we're going to live on
[1:32:01] that city right don't the babies live
[1:32:03] off their mother right that city is the
[1:32:05] mother of us all that's where same city

[1:32:24] and keep us thank God for his Mercy
[1:32:26] thank God that we got a mother amen a
[1:32:28] New Jerusalem Mount Z amen
[1:32:32] hallelujah
[1:32:36] Glory now New Jerusalem is mentioned a
[1:32:38] few more times Hebrews 11 let's go to
[1:32:41] Hebrews
[1:32:46] 11 and let's look at verse I'm trying to
[1:32:49] limit I know where I'm going but I just
[1:32:51] kind of got to limit
[1:32:57] okay it's verse 14 Hebrews
[1:33:03] 11:14 for they that say such things
[1:33:06] declare plainly that they seek a country
[1:33:08] so just like Abraham we're seeking a
[1:33:10] country this is not our home Church
[1:33:12] don't let Aran Ohio wherever
[1:33:14] Pennsylvania wherever you live young
[1:33:15] down area don't let that really become
[1:33:17] your home let's let New Jerusalem be our
[1:33:19] home praise God because that's what we
[1:33:22] are come to the New Jerusalem that
[1:33:24] Heavenly City where Christ is the light
[1:33:27] and Christ uh there's no need of sun
[1:33:29] because Christ is the light thereof is
[1:33:30] that is that right where the Throne of
[1:33:32] God will sit verse 16 but now they
[1:33:35] desire a better country that is and
[1:33:38] Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to
[1:33:40] be called their God for Heath prepared
[1:33:42] for them a city praise God this is Mount
[1:33:45] Zion the city that we're hearing from

[1:33:51] Hallelujah the C with innumerable Angels
[1:33:54] amen uh Revelation three let's go there

[1:34:15] Jerusalem hallelujah amen and he shall
[1:34:18] go no more out and I write upon him the
[1:34:20] name of my God and the name of the city
[1:34:23] of my God which is New Jerusalem which
[1:34:26] cometh down out of Heaven from my God
[1:34:28] and I write upon him my new name Amen
[1:34:32] brother said ask what's that new name he
[1:34:34] said no man knows he said he knows he's
[1:34:36] lying only Jesus knows that name amen
[1:34:40] glory now go to Revelation 21 this now
[1:34:42] the whole chapter 21 is about the New
[1:34:44] Jerusalem if you never read
[1:34:49] it let's read verses 1 1 and two
[1:34:51] Revelation 211 and2 brother Sunny you
[1:34:53] got that I'm sorry brother I'm sorry I'm
[1:34:56] catching you guys off guard forgive me

[1:35:03] yeah thank you brother sorry about
[1:35:18] that amen thank you sir sorry about that
[1:35:21] thank you
[1:35:22] okay so the new city is called a mother
[1:35:25] and it's also called a bride praise God
[1:35:28] see it so it's a city it's a it's a
[1:35:31] spiritual city of God where he's gonna
[1:35:33] place his bride in that City hallelujah
[1:35:36] amen that's beautiful praise God so
[1:35:39] that's the Mount Zion that's what we're
[1:35:41] coming to and brother and the Holy
[1:35:43] Spirit said we're coming to a Mount Zion
[1:35:45] Showdown to see who really is going to
[1:35:47] live in that City who really is the wife
[1:35:50] of Jesus Christ oh
[1:35:52] that's us amen it's those who believe
[1:35:53] the word amen who receive the prophet of
[1:35:56] the day if we receive the Forerunner
[1:35:58] then we'll receive the last one the real
[1:36:00] one who's to come that's Jesus Christ
[1:36:02] amen hallelujah so Jerusalem has both
[1:36:05] Mount Mariah now look at look at this
[1:36:07] naturally here's what the Bible
[1:36:08] dictionary says written in the 1800s of
[1:36:11] these two mountains that on the west
[1:36:13] Zion is higher and more massive I know
[1:36:16] Wendy's been there anyone else ever been
[1:36:17] there before nobody i' never been there
[1:36:20] either I'd sure like to be there
[1:36:22] okay I know I've come to Mount Zion
[1:36:24] because the Bible say I've come to Mount
[1:36:25] Zion I know I've been there Hallelujah
[1:36:28] spiritually on that which the city of
[1:36:29] Jerusalem now stands and in fact always
[1:36:31] stood the hill on the East Mariah is
[1:36:34] considered lower and smaller so that the
[1:36:37] to a spectator from the south the city
[1:36:40] appears to slope sharply towards the
[1:36:42] east so looks if you're looking North at
[1:36:45] jerusalm it kind of goes like this down
[1:36:47] okay so here's the picture a drawing of
[1:36:49] it Zion is the highest Mountain there
[1:36:52] and then it Mar a little bit lower and
[1:36:55] then it goes down and you have the Mount
[1:36:56] of Olives up here where Jesus you know
[1:36:58] went went up to pray up here on the
[1:37:00] Mount of ol now that's kind of a rough
[1:37:02] illustration here's a little bit better
[1:37:04] illustration and I'm sorry sorry if it's
[1:37:06] so hard to see yeah I'm sorry I should
[1:37:08] have made that bigger but Mount Zion's
[1:37:10] way over here new wall I don't even know
[1:37:12] what Jewish quarter is I'm not sure what
[1:37:13] the Armenian quarter is I know what the
[1:37:15] Temple Mount is that's where Solomon's
[1:37:17] Temple used to be praise God and on the
[1:37:19] Temple Mount here is the Dome of the
[1:37:22] Rock that's the shrine the MOs of Omar
[1:37:24] they call is that right MOS of Omar I
[1:37:26] get those mixed
[1:37:27] up okay so see how can everybody see how
[1:37:30] it's sloping down it's a little bit easy
[1:37:31] to see uh that's what that is so it's a
[1:37:35] little bit uh tricky if you're not quite
[1:37:37] sure because sometimes the word Zion
[1:37:40] refers to the that literal mountain of
[1:37:42] Zion right here the highest mountain
[1:37:44] there or other times in scripture Mount
[1:37:46] Zion refers to all Jerusalem and I had
[1:37:49] some examples but I don't have them I
[1:37:50] forgot to put them here but let's read
[1:37:52] this let's read psalms
[1:37:54] 243 who shall Ascend into the hill of
[1:37:57] the Lord how many want to be in that uh
[1:37:59] New Jerusalem how many want to climb in
[1:38:01] that mountain oh my hallelujah amen I
[1:38:04] want to be translated in that
[1:38:06] mountain we don't have to climb it I
[1:38:08] like to be translated to the top of that
[1:38:10] mountain where Christ is who will go up
[1:38:13] to that
[1:38:14] mountain who shall stand in his holy
[1:38:17] place he that have clean hands and the
[1:38:21] Pure Heart who has not lifted up his
[1:38:23] soul unto vanity anybody think of some
[1:38:26] vain things in life video games can be
[1:38:29] vain praise God drinking cussing smoking
[1:38:33] movies can be
[1:38:35] vain meaningless the Bible says if you
[1:38:38] still cuss your religion is not real yet
[1:38:42] how many know that's in scripture we
[1:38:43] read that remember we read that on
[1:38:44] Monday morning because pure religion
[1:38:46] before before God is to visit the
[1:38:49] fatherless uh and and the widows
[1:38:51] remember that in scripture and to keep a
[1:38:53] man's tongue from
[1:38:54] evil praise
[1:38:57] God someone who doesn't lift up their
[1:38:59] soul into Advantage someone who invests
[1:39:01] their time in the right things Church
[1:39:03] invest your time in your you fathers
[1:39:05] invest your time in your children invest
[1:39:07] your time in your family is that right
[1:39:10] if you possibly can invest as much time
[1:39:12] in them because that's not a vain thing
[1:39:14] God loves family amen hallelujah put
[1:39:18] your time into things that matter like
[1:39:21] Jesus said labor not for the meat that
[1:39:24] perishes labor for the meat that's
[1:39:26] Eternal the word amen labor for that
[1:39:29] brothers that's what we need to labor
[1:39:30] for don't lift up our souls under vain
[1:39:33] things nor sworn to well I promise I'll
[1:39:36] do promise I'll do that and deceiving
[1:39:38] people the whole time if you don't mean
[1:39:41] it don't say it church right you're only
[1:39:44] as good as your
[1:39:46] word he so who the one that has Clean
[1:39:49] Hands and a pure heart he shall receive
[1:39:52] the blessing from the Lord and
[1:39:53] righteousness from God of his
[1:39:56] salvation this is the generation of them
[1:39:58] that seek him that seek thy face oh
[1:40:01] Jacob say you love that that's beautiful
[1:40:06] two more things as we close I just want
[1:40:07] to
[1:40:09] close the Bible conditions of the third
[1:40:12] and final
[1:40:14] showdown now turn to Revelation
[1:40:19] 1316
[1:40:24] this is what we call around the message
[1:40:26] The
[1:40:27] Squeeze this is what we call around the
[1:40:30] message as the squeeze Revelation
[1:40:35] 13:16 now some of you that have been
[1:40:37] around I've read these quotes before I
[1:40:38] just want to read them again because
[1:40:40] this is all referring to the Mount Zion
[1:40:42] Showdown we've been through the Mount
[1:40:44] Caramel right we've been to the Mount
[1:40:46] Transfiguration now it's our turn Mount
[1:40:49] Zion Hallelujah to prove in a spiritual
[1:40:53] way who really is the Bride of Jesus
[1:40:55] Christ is denominations and Creeds the
[1:40:58] bride or someone who just loves the word
[1:41:00] the bride the one who loves the
[1:41:03] word hallelujah and the one that can
[1:41:05] live the
[1:41:06] word hallelujah that's right now
[1:41:09] Revelation 13:16 can anybody read that
[1:41:12] one for me Joseph okay sir he calls all
[1:41:15] both small and great rich and poor free
[1:41:18] and bond receive a mark in the
[1:41:23] amen praise to go praise God now how
[1:41:25] many know how many know that in the pick
[1:41:27] up your pen and right portion brother
[1:41:30] bam used this scripture to say that the
[1:41:32] bride would be forced to stop preaching
[1:41:34] how many know that let me read it to you
[1:41:36] I don't have it on the SL well maybe I
[1:41:37] do have it on the slide just bear with
[1:41:38] me here I didn't think I got to that I
[1:41:42] was woken at 3:30 a.m. by one of my
[1:41:44] children and couldn't go back to bed and
[1:41:45] then I fell back asleep and I got a
[1:41:47] pounding headache but I can be free from
[1:41:49] that in Jesus name right brother
[1:41:51] amen exactly right I thought I might had
[1:41:55] this in front of
[1:41:57] me okay this is the next one but let me
[1:42:00] let me
[1:42:01] uh let me read this this is not up here
[1:42:05] this is and pick up your pen after
[1:42:06] talking about Elijah Moses and John's
[1:42:08] Behavior I believe someday the real
[1:42:10] bride of Christ will be forced to stop
[1:42:13] preaching the word of God the Bible
[1:42:16] prophesies of it in Revelation 13:16
[1:42:19] brother BR said well sorry the spirit of
[1:42:21] God says brother says he want to put
[1:42:23] that down denominations will force it to
[1:42:26] stop or take its Mark then when the lamb
[1:42:30] will take his bride and judge the
[1:42:33] for this praise God you love the Lord
[1:42:36] amen so that's one scripture that
[1:42:39] brother Ram says proves a squeeze here's
[1:42:41] where he says it right after preaching
[1:42:43] this now he gets done with a pick up
[1:42:45] your pen and right says do you believe
[1:42:47] why is this been have you a better
[1:42:50] understanding now
[1:42:51] that's why I ask everybody do you
[1:42:52] understand now because I want you to
[1:42:54] understand it's the word friends this
[1:42:56] has been about six hours right close
[1:42:58] five and half or six hours there is so
[1:43:00] much more could be said but surely the
[1:43:02] Holy Spirit by this time has sunk it so
[1:43:05] deep in you that you know what I'm
[1:43:07] talking about we are at the end time the
[1:43:10] seeds are SED now the latter rain is
[1:43:13] fixing to come
[1:43:15] forth praise God which is what the Mount
[1:43:19] Zion Showdown
[1:43:21] that will be in the latter ring where
[1:43:24] the power of the Holy Ghost Falls in a
[1:43:26] great way but say the third pole will be
[1:43:29] operating during that Mount Zion
[1:43:31] showdown in a greater way he said when
[1:43:34] the council begins to tighten up it'll
[1:43:36] be operating in a greater way at that
[1:43:37] time now look now this is immediately
[1:43:40] after
[1:43:41] remember there will be such a
[1:43:43] denominational Gathering pretty soon
[1:43:45] it'll be terrific and they will bring
[1:43:48] themselves together this Federation of
[1:43:49] churches
[1:43:51] and then this kind of a church will be
[1:43:54] put out of operation as far as they know
[1:43:58] I like
[1:43:59] that amen if they lock the doors on this
[1:44:03] church well they'll think they have us
[1:44:05] out of operation but the True Church of
[1:44:07] God will keep on operating whether we
[1:44:09] got emails or texts or not we'll keep
[1:44:12] operating why because we'll be in touch
[1:44:13] with Jesus Christ through prayer that
[1:44:15] transforms Our Lives it'll change our
[1:44:18] minds it'll get us in tune with Christ
[1:44:20] to make ready for the mount Z Showdown
[1:44:22] and he'll communicate that the dead in
[1:44:24] Christ are going to arise and then when
[1:44:25] we see them it's not long until our
[1:44:28] change is coming too amen will be
[1:44:31] operating
[1:44:33] church as far as they think they'll
[1:44:35] think they shut down the church a bride
[1:44:37] of Christ Fellowship but she keeps on
[1:44:39] moving on she's an eternal Church she's
[1:44:42] an eternal bride amen always be the
[1:44:45] Bride of Jesus
[1:44:46] Christ it's at that time brother brandom
[1:44:49] says that Jesus will
[1:44:52] appear and he will show which is his
[1:44:55] bride and which is
[1:44:58] not and remember Christian friends I a
[1:45:02] man I can make mistakes I like that some
[1:45:05] people say brother can't make mistakes
[1:45:08] said I can make
[1:45:10] mistakes but God being God cannot make a
[1:45:14] mistake all the word that's been written
[1:45:16] must be fulfilled Jesus said so so we
[1:45:20] got things here in the scripture that
[1:45:23] must be fulfilled and that is one of the
[1:45:26] things this
[1:45:28] boyot to
[1:45:31] come wow I I listened to this before I
[1:45:34] preached on this before and I read over
[1:45:35] yesterday I'm like oh my goodness he
[1:45:37] just said the boycott is scriptural and
[1:45:40] I went glory to God Amen I knew it was
[1:45:43] written pick up your pen right but here
[1:45:45] he says this is not something this is
[1:45:47] Boycott is actually in the scripture and
[1:45:49] he told us where it is Revelation 13:16
[1:45:52] but there's another Revelation 3:10
[1:45:54] let's turn there I'm trying to close
[1:45:56] Revelation
[1:45:58] 3:10 brother BR said it's scriptural the
[1:46:01] boycott is in the Bible he says and the
[1:46:04] Holy Spirit said it as well and pick up
[1:46:07] your pen and
[1:46:13] right okay Revelation 3:10 amen can you
[1:46:17] read that sir you got your Bible right
[1:46:18] there you're ready to go because thou
[1:46:21] Hast kept the word of my patience I also
[1:46:23] will keep thee from the hour of
[1:46:25] Temptation which shall come upon all the
[1:46:27] world to them to try them that dwell
[1:46:30] upon the Earth amen praise God thank you
[1:46:33] brother now so Church it looks like
[1:46:36] through some of these script these two
[1:46:37] scriptures we have now remember in the
[1:46:39] mouth of what every two or three
[1:46:40] Witnesses right every word be
[1:46:43] established so to pick up your pen says
[1:46:45] Revelation 13:16 the quote we set up
[1:46:47] there said that's a boycott is in the
[1:46:49] scripture and Revelation 3:10 is another
[1:46:53] witness to us that because we've kept
[1:46:55] the word he's going to keep us from the
[1:46:57] hour of Temptation the hour temptation
[1:47:00] is when the Beast pushes the tries to
[1:47:02] push the mark of the beast out on
[1:47:03] everybody and they have to make a choice
[1:47:05] so they can take the mark of the beast
[1:47:06] or not right that's
[1:47:09] right to try them upon the the whole
[1:47:12] world the Bible says now here's what
[1:47:14] brother Ram said
[1:47:16] here this is in 1960 the Philadelphian
[1:47:18] Church age brother Ram reads this
[1:47:20] scripture and here's what he said
[1:47:22] because thou has kept the word of my
[1:47:23] patience I also will keep thee from the
[1:47:25] hour Temptation the church is going to
[1:47:27] come to a place where you're going to
[1:47:29] have to get in this organization or
[1:47:31] you're going to have or you're not going
[1:47:33] to have it all that's all you're either
[1:47:34] going to be organized or take the mark
[1:47:36] of the beast either gonna to organize it
[1:47:38] or go to denomination which is actually
[1:47:40] coming the mark of the beast because
[1:47:42] it's a boycott remember this is December
[1:47:44] 10 L his birthday
[1:47:46] 1960 he
[1:47:49] says that he said this shall come upon
[1:47:51] the whole world to try them that dwell
[1:47:53] upon the Earth behold I come quickly
[1:47:55] hold fast to that which thou Hast that
[1:47:58] no man take away thy Crown he say now
[1:48:02] this great Temptation the our Temptation
[1:48:04] that shall come to try the whole world
[1:48:06] goes into the
[1:48:07] tribulation he says we'll see it it goes
[1:48:09] on tribulation this tribulation not come
[1:48:12] in the days of Wesley so where are we at
[1:48:14] what's this door set before he said this
[1:48:17] is where the church is headed right now
[1:48:19] and already in to L see Church age but
[1:48:21] this little place right in here within
[1:48:23] the last 30 or 40 years has been an open
[1:48:25] door he talking about his his brandom
[1:48:27] Tabernacle this little church has been
[1:48:29] an Open Door sitting right there before
[1:48:31] the people to come in and God will take
[1:48:34] the remnant and seal it off amen and
[1:48:37] they'll just go into a lukewarm and
[1:48:39] he'll spurt them out of his mouth the
[1:48:41] work will be cut short up goes the
[1:48:43] church and here comes the Antichrist
[1:48:45] Spirit moving in for Destruction just
[1:48:47] perfect fits the whole Bible right on
[1:48:50] around you love the Lord let me close
[1:48:52] with
[1:48:53] this there so there's a possible brother
[1:48:56] ra puts this in the church age book
[1:48:58] there's a possible minor persecution
[1:49:00] because the minor persecution will just
[1:49:02] be something like trying to shut the
[1:49:04] doors forcing people to stop preaching
[1:49:07] right but the persecution can't be the
[1:49:09] Great Tribulation because God would
[1:49:10] never let his bride go through that is
[1:49:13] that right would you let your bride or
[1:49:15] your spouse go through awful like that
[1:49:16] no they already was they're already
[1:49:18] forgiven they're already Justified why
[1:49:19] would they have to go through such
[1:49:20] trials as that they don't have to but
[1:49:22] they got to come up to a
[1:49:24] showdown Hallelujah they got to come to
[1:49:27] a
[1:49:27] showdown and God's got to show who's who
[1:49:30] who's really the bride and who's
[1:49:34] not that's why we ought to be pressing
[1:49:36] in as hard as we possibly can you
[1:49:38] haven't prayed long in a while you
[1:49:39] better start praying long we better
[1:49:41] start praying right we haven't been
[1:49:43] feeding on the word like we ought to
[1:49:45] there's no better time like right now
[1:49:47] praise the Lord feasting on the word of
[1:49:50] of God here's what he saids in the
[1:49:51] church age book this may seem farfetched
[1:49:53] to some but actually it's very plain for
[1:49:55] all to see because right now the
[1:49:56] churches are controlling politics you
[1:49:58] know that churches are controlling our
[1:50:01] politics right now and at the opportune
[1:50:04] time we'll manifest exactly how great is
[1:50:06] that control this economical move will
[1:50:09] end up with Rome at the head even though
[1:50:12] the people did not Envision it that way
[1:50:14] this is so because Revelation 17 3-6 it
[1:50:17] states that the mystery Babylon is
[1:50:20] Seated on the
[1:50:21] Beast okay so what is the Beast the
[1:50:23] Beast is the spirit of Rome what's the
[1:50:25] image of the Beast the World Council of
[1:50:27] churches so the World Council churches
[1:50:30] is the visible image of the spirit of
[1:50:32] Rome that wants to swallow up divide and
[1:50:34] conquer and take over the whole world
[1:50:36] but the woman the Roman Catholic Church
[1:50:38] rides on top of that beast and who's the
[1:50:40] head of that woman the
[1:50:43] pope she's controlling the last or
[1:50:45] fourth Empire this Roman Church is doing
[1:50:49] that
[1:50:50] with the World Church system under her
[1:50:52] Rome I'm sorry under her Rome will be
[1:50:55] controlling and this image the church
[1:50:56] system will be Obed to Rome because Rome
[1:50:59] controls the gold of the world thus all
[1:51:01] people have to belong to the World
[1:51:03] Church system or be at the mercy of the
[1:51:06] elements for they cannot buy or sell
[1:51:09] without the mark of the beast in the
[1:51:10] land hand or head here's what the mark
[1:51:12] of the beast is everyone wants to be
[1:51:14] talked about the bible study this week
[1:51:16] this Mark in the head means they'll have
[1:51:18] to take the doctrine of the world Church
[1:51:20] system which is trinitarianism ETC it's
[1:51:23] also universalism right everybody's
[1:51:24] going to be saved no matter what church
[1:51:26] you're in you're going to be saved now
[1:51:28] the mark in the hand which means to do
[1:51:30] the will of the World Church now it
[1:51:33] might come down to computer chip right
[1:51:34] might come down to something like that
[1:51:36] but it's a spiritual Mark Cain was
[1:51:37] marked spiritually right he was marked
[1:51:40] spiritually and so he get now they're
[1:51:42] going to get a mark in their head for
[1:51:44] the doctrine and a mark in the hand
[1:51:45] means to do the will of the
[1:51:47] church instead of the will of God's word
[1:51:51] with this great power the church systems
[1:51:54] will persecute the true bride that's
[1:51:56] what brother R allowed to be written in
[1:51:58] his book he said he read it over all
[1:51:59] those years this image will try to keep
[1:52:02] the bride from preaching and teaching
[1:52:05] Etc her ministers will be forbidden to
[1:52:08] give comfort and Truth to the people who
[1:52:10] need it but before the Antichrist in
[1:52:13] person takes over this complete World
[1:52:15] System of churches the true church will
[1:52:17] be taken away from this world to be with
[1:52:20] the Lord God will catch away his bride
[1:52:22] for the great marriage supper the lamb
[1:52:24] let's stand to our
[1:52:30] feet
[1:52:37] Hallelujah there is a showdown coming
[1:52:39] Church let's bow our heads if we can
[1:52:41] there is a showdown coming God is going
[1:52:44] to
[1:52:45] show who's his bride and who's not his
[1:52:48] bride
[1:52:50] the way to be ready we've been preaching
[1:52:51] on Wednesdays the way to be ready is to
[1:52:53] love God with all your heart soul mind
[1:52:58] and strength Jesus said the one who
[1:53:00] loves me are the one who keeps my
[1:53:02] commands the ones who keep not my
[1:53:04] commands do not love
[1:53:06] me how many want to be ready for the
[1:53:08] Mount Zion Showdown and want to be in
[1:53:10] the bride God bless those

[1:53:15] spear and the bride say
