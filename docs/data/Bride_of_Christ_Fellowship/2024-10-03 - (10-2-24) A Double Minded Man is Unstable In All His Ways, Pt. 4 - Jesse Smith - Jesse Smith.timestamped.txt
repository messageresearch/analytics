[0:00] uh by God's grace we looked at the life
[0:02] of Eli in part one we looked at the life
[0:05] of King Saul in part two um Wednesday we
[0:09] looked at some of
[0:11] the uh some of the i' say false Doctrine
[0:15] you know currently around you know our
[0:17] sister churches and so forth like that
[0:19] of how people idolize uh William brandom
[0:22] and so forth We Believe William Brandon
[0:24] was a prophet of God but we don't
[0:26] worship him uh so we looked at that on
[0:28] Sunday by God's grace I'm sure you
[0:30] remember but uh by God's grace we
[0:33] tonight we want to look at the life of
[0:34] St Peter so we want to look at this in
[0:37] the light of we can see many times
[0:39] through his life how he was
[0:41] double-minded and it's very clear to see
[0:43] that uh and I've never and I preached on
[0:46] Peter Peter of course numerous times but
[0:48] never have I seen it in this light so to
[0:50] me it's the Holy Spirit giving me more
[0:52] understanding giving us more
[0:53] understanding uh that we can by God's
[0:55] grace cast down double-mindedness and we
[0:58] can live a single-minded life how many
[1:00] want that by God's grace I know that's
[1:02] why you're here right you want a
[1:03] single-minded uh walk with the Lord
[1:05] without distraction you want to overcome
[1:08] life's trials and so forth so let's go
[1:10] to James chapter 1
[1:13] ver8 then we'll read uh James 4 ver8
[1:16] James 4
[1:18] ver8 so James 1 verse eight let's read
[1:21] that if we can on three one two three a
[1:24] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:28] ways amen now let's go to James uh 4:8
[1:31] remember James chapter 1 is to the
[1:33] believer who's faithful uh James chapter
[1:36] 1 was not really rebuke it was just
[1:38] saying if you think you're going to
[1:39] receive anything anything from God you
[1:41] can't be double-minded you have to be
[1:43] single-minded now chapter four is a
[1:45] totally different story chapter 4
[1:46] they've got Wars and fights in the
[1:48] church they've got adulterers and
[1:50] adulteresses people sleeping around the
[1:51] church and now James says this is
[1:54] another kind of double double-mindedness
[1:56] this is a worse
[1:58] double-mindedness uh and I don't believe
[1:59] this applies to us because how many have
[2:01] Clean Hands by the grace of God how many
[2:03] have how many have a pure heart by the
[2:05] grace of God that's why I lay here at
[2:07] the altar before service in my home say
[2:09] God created me a clean heart Hallelujah
[2:11] there's any sin show me I'll confess it
[2:13] I just want to live pure before the Lord
[2:15] hallelujah so this is of course another
[2:18] kind of double-mindedness this is the
[2:19] one that we want to avoid by God's grace
[2:21] and I believe we have by the grace of
[2:23] God let's read this one as well ready
[2:25] one two 3 draw nigh to God and He will
[2:29] draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye
[2:32] Sinners and purify your hearts ye
[2:35] double-minded amen may God add his a
[2:37] blessing to the reading of his word you
[2:39] can be seated praise
[2:42] God hallelujah so we'll look at this
[2:44] here tonight uh trust be a blessing I
[2:46] think last time Paige was here didn't we
[2:48] look at David sister Paige is okay if I
[2:49] call you sister Paige sister Carrie
[2:53] sister Sharon you know we're all
[2:54] brothers and sisters uh by the blood of
[2:56] Jesus Christ so uh we're looking at
[2:59] God's grace last time uh Paige was here
[3:01] God's grace to David and uh of course
[3:04] God had great grace on David God has
[3:06] great grace on us too Hallelujah let me
[3:07] set a timer here I'll try to preach
[3:09] about 45 minutes I can't promise that
[3:10] but I'm going to try to stop at 45
[3:12] minutes we'll see how that
[3:13] goes so
[3:15] uh tonight you know let's look at the
[3:18] life of Peter we looked at Eli I said
[3:20] King Saul we looked at the current uh
[3:23] idolatry some people have today on
[3:25] Sunday you know regarding brother
[3:26] William brandham um and then uh today
[3:29] we're look at the life of St Peter I
[3:32] don't think I've ever looked at it in
[3:33] this light so hope it'll be a blessing
[3:35] to you you know I looked at um you know
[3:37] these scriptures on Peter I want to
[3:39] start off by uh reminding you of how he
[3:41] was raised uh he was raised as a
[3:44] fisherman right his father was a
[3:46] fisherman of course in those days the
[3:48] the sons always did the the the
[3:51] occupation of their father right Jesus
[3:52] was a carpenter they looked at Jesus and
[3:54] said isn't this the Carpenter's son
[3:57] right and that was a lowly kind of job a
[3:58] carpenter wasn't a great man it wasn't a
[4:00] great job you know so uh Jesus you know
[4:03] wasn't raised we'd Say by a great man um
[4:05] you know as far as the world standards
[4:07] but of course Joseph was a a true
[4:08] servant of God Amen there was no uh
[4:11] there's no Prophet when he was alive
[4:12] right John the Baptist wasn't born yet
[4:14] Malachi had died you know hundreds of
[4:15] years later or earlier and so there
[4:19] there was no way to talk to Joseph so
[4:21] God sent him a dream right and then he
[4:23] spoke to him about you know a baby Jesus
[4:26] and so forth and God was able to speak
[4:28] to him and he was a just man the Bible
[4:30] said Hallelujah so God has a way to
[4:31] speak to us hallelujah if there's maybe
[4:33] no Prophet on the scene if there's no uh
[4:36] if there's no person with a great gift
[4:38] of God God still can speak to us that
[4:40] ought encourage us tonight praise God
[4:42] because you might go to bed tonight you
[4:43] might get a Dream from the Lord right or
[4:45] maybe next week or you know in the
[4:47] upcoming months here by God's grace uh I
[4:49] think we've all had dreams that we know
[4:51] God was speaking to us hallelujah we
[4:53] looked at that a few weeks ago where job
[4:55] said God gives Men Dreams to seal up the
[4:58] sum of their wisdom so God will give you
[5:00] a dream sometimes to confirm that what
[5:02] you were hearing while you were awake
[5:04] that was the will of God right sometimes
[5:07] you do that sometimes we'll give you a
[5:08] warning like with uh Joseph or sending
[5:10] the angel uh sometimes God does those
[5:12] things but we want to be aware of how
[5:14] God speaks to us but uh Peter of course
[5:17] was raised here as a fisherman uh
[5:19] fishermen were pretty lowly workers
[5:21] right they were the uh they're the Burly
[5:24] right they're the Burly workers on I
[5:26] imagine there were some little ones too
[5:27] but we imagine Peter had was a big Burly
[5:29] guy you know in those big Nets of fish
[5:30] right trying to pull them in and uh and
[5:34] remember he was raised in the Roman
[5:36] culture that was not a very kind culture
[5:39] right to women and children remember
[5:41] remember we looked at the history a
[5:42] Roman man could have his wife and
[5:44] children killed in any moment just just
[5:46] if he said so and the women couldn't be
[5:49] you know they couldn't go to court a
[5:50] woman's word couldn't be trusted think
[5:52] about think about that that was the the
[5:54] culture remember that and then maybe
[5:55] they are under heavy taxation so Peter
[5:58] would work all day he'd pull in the Nets
[6:01] and then the the the the publicans and
[6:03] and all the tax collectors would be
[6:04] right there and you know how they didn't
[6:06] like Tax Collectors they didn't like
[6:07] zakus right they always charge too much
[6:09] they always took too much money so Peter
[6:11] was just living under this cycle of life
[6:13] right he was married you know uh he had
[6:16] a had a wife the Bible said Jesus healed
[6:18] his mother-in-law later on but he was
[6:19] you know raised in this uh in in this
[6:22] system it's kind of like the cast system
[6:24] right where you you just can't get out
[6:25] of it how is he ever going to raise out
[6:27] of being a fisherman what hope did he
[6:29] have for his life what was their life
[6:31] expectancy around that time not very
[6:32] long not like ours right thanks to the
[6:35] Industrial Revolution so we would say he
[6:38] didn't maybe have like a a very hopeful
[6:40] life but one day he heard about that
[6:43] there was a man a young man a young
[6:45] preacher just about his age who was a
[6:48] preacher and he went to see him we know
[6:49] that in John chapter 1 he went to see
[6:52] him and the very first thing Jesus said
[6:54] he saids your name is uh Simon son of
[6:57] Jonas right and he says I'm going to
[7:00] make you a fisher of men now see the
[7:04] Bible wouldn't put that in there unless
[7:05] it was significant now I've never seen
[7:06] the chosen series but people say there's
[7:08] some good moments like that in the
[7:09] chosen series I I don't watch it you
[7:11] know there might be some good moments I
[7:12] know I've seen some healings on there
[7:13] that look really good you know on the
[7:15] advertisements and so forth like that
[7:18] but it must have been the case that that
[7:21] that uh you know that that Jesus told
[7:24] him who his father was because his
[7:25] father had told Peter about who the
[7:27] Messiah would be that had had to be a
[7:29] significant event in Peter's life so
[7:31] Peter out there on the boats they would
[7:33] have been talking about the Messiah and
[7:34] he would have heard it like Malachi
[7:35] heard me preach all these years Dad yeah
[7:37] Dad you keep saying that yeah yeah one
[7:39] of these days the messiah's going to
[7:40] come son yeah yeah yeah Peter would just
[7:42] you know he just go along with it and
[7:44] when he comes he's going to tell us the
[7:45] secrets of of our hearts and he's gonna
[7:48] he's gonna be greater than Moses and
[7:50] yeah Dad yeah I heard it a hundred times
[7:51] Dad yeah now he doesn't act that way but
[7:54] you can imagine Peter right he was just
[7:57] raised around that but then the first
[7:59] time you know Andrew and Nathaniel they
[8:01] all say John they say there he's the
[8:03] Messiah we believe he's the Messiah and
[8:05] he said okay let me let me see about
[8:07] that let me see and no doubt his dad
[8:10] told him about it and the very first
[8:11] thing he tells him his dad's name and he
[8:14] tells him now I'm going to call you
[8:15] sephus which means the Rock I'm going to
[8:18] call you the Rock So before he must have
[8:21] not been much of a rock right and we're
[8:23] going to see it even in his life before
[8:25] Pentecost he wasn't very solid and the
[8:28] church said amen
[8:30] and church that's how we are you know we
[8:31] become Christians and at at the
[8:33] beginning we're not very solid but what
[8:35] does God do he makes us strong
[8:37] Hallelujah right Peter uh followed Jesus
[8:40] for three maybe three and a half years
[8:41] some Scholars say and then after Jesus
[8:43] resurrect resurrected and ascended then
[8:45] he went to the the Pentecost right upper
[8:47] room and that's where he was filled with
[8:49] the spirit of God and after he was
[8:50] filled with the spirit of God he was a
[8:52] different man Hallelujah right that's
[8:54] what we're going to see tonight but I
[8:55] won't be able to go through everything
[8:57] but this is what we see you know he he
[8:59] comes in the presence of Jesus and Jesus
[9:01] tells him who his dad is how could Jesus
[9:03] know there wasn't any way for him to
[9:05] know other than God let him know he was
[9:07] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[9:09] of the heart praise God he had that
[9:12] gift okay and so we see that's how Peter
[9:15] gets his start Hallelujah he meets Jesus
[9:18] In This Very Supernatural way and
[9:20] remember in Matthew chapter 10 I don't
[9:22] want to have time to read all these
[9:23] because a lot of these are familiar to
[9:24] us but in Matthew chapter 10 Jesus calls
[9:26] Peter and the other 11 and he says I'm
[9:28] going to give you power to heal the sick
[9:31] any manner of sickness they could have
[9:33] healed raise the Dead cast out Devils
[9:36] now I've never raised the dead but I
[9:37] have prayed for the sick they've got
[9:38] well I have cast out Devils about six or
[9:40] seven times out of people that were
[9:42] foaming at the mouth and I just prayed
[9:44] for them and they screamed and they fell
[9:45] down like just like in the Bible they
[9:46] fell down like they were dead and uh had
[9:49] to wait a little while wake them up and
[9:50] they're they're in their right mind
[9:51] again praising God so I I know the
[9:54] Bible's real how many know the Bible's
[9:55] real praise God I know the Bible's real
[9:58] Hallelujah but Peter and was G like all
[10:00] the other 11 he was given all of these
[10:02] remember Judas was given that same power
[10:04] too so that proves no matter what gifts
[10:07] you have that doesn't mean you're saved
[10:08] just because you're gifted everybody has
[10:10] at least one gift the Bible says right
[10:12] so what it means we got to be faithful
[10:14] our gifts don't save us Grace saves us
[10:16] amen hallelujah God's grace saves us
[10:18] amen we're saved by grace through faith
[10:21] it is a gift of God hallelujah amen and
[10:24] so we see that uh Peter gets the power
[10:28] you know and he goes out and uh he
[10:30] begins uh the Bible said Jesus sent him
[10:33] out two by two so Peter would go with
[10:35] another man I wonder who he'd go with
[10:37] you know uh he go out there and and they
[10:39] would do Miracles and they they they
[10:41] tell the the communities the messiah's
[10:43] coming Jesus is coming after us and
[10:45] Jesus would come and they do many mighty
[10:47] wonderful things uh but we also as we
[10:50] look at the scripture we begin to see
[10:51] Peter's double-mindedness right we begin
[10:54] to see some of his
[10:56] struggles uh but before that let's look
[10:59] at a few of his uh I'm going to look at
[11:00] some of these good moments here by God's
[11:01] grace because I want to show you the
[11:03] good and then of course the struggles so
[11:06] in Matthew 16: 16 a case I'm going to
[11:08] have you maybe busy putting up some
[11:09] verses up there because I like to cover
[11:12] a lot of ground here if I can uh by
[11:14] God's
[11:16] grace Matthew 16:16 it's amazing Peter
[11:20] gives us two of the most beautiful
[11:23] confessions of faith in the entire
[11:26] Bible two of the most memorable
[11:28] statements anyone's ever said to Jesus
[11:31] came by Peter Hallelujah and Simon Peter
[11:34] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[11:36] the son of the Living
[11:38] God think about that Peter had seen the
[11:40] first miracle water turned to Wine he'd
[11:43] seen that he'd seen 5,000 fed Peter
[11:46] would have saw the baskets they take a
[11:48] fish out and there would have been more
[11:50] fish down there how how'd that happen
[11:52] wait wait let me let me check again and
[11:54] each time they took out there was more
[11:56] Peter saw that and he said uh Jesus said
[11:59] who do men say that I am Jeremiah John
[12:01] the Baptist who do who do men say that I
[12:03] am is Isaiah who do men say that I am
[12:05] and Peter's the one that speaks up he
[12:06] says I know you're the Christ you're the
[12:09] Messiah amen remember Christ means the
[12:11] anointed one Hallelujah Peter had seen
[12:13] Jesus anointed Hallelujah he just wasn't
[12:16] a preacher he was a powerful preacher
[12:19] Hallelujah there's times I wish I seen
[12:21] more power in my life I have seen power
[12:23] in my life at times but I wish I saw
[12:24] more of the power Hallelujah but not so
[12:26] with Jesus Jesus had all power
[12:29] Hallelujah he said all power all
[12:31] authority is given unto me in heaven and
[12:33] earth Hallelujah but then he also said I
[12:35] can only do what the father shows me
[12:37] remember in John chapter 5 he said the
[12:39] son can do nothing of himself except
[12:41] what the father shows him first
[12:44] Hallelujah so we also know Jesus was
[12:46] obedient to the father's Visions or the
[12:49] word that the father spoke to Jesus amen
[12:52] but then also we know John said that uh
[12:54] if if it were possible the world
[12:56] couldn't hold all the books of the
[12:58] testimonies of Jesus amen and Peter was
[13:01] the one right there standing them
[13:02] standing there watching Jesus do all
[13:05] these amazing
[13:06] Miracles Hallelujah now uh let's go if
[13:09] you would here uh let's go to this one
[13:11] Luke 5 one of the first things uh where
[13:13] we
[13:14] see uh maybe a little bit of Peter's
[13:16] struggles in Luke 5 verse4 Luke 5
[13:20] verse4 thanks you're doing a great Joba
[13:23] when he had left speaking he said unto
[13:24] Simon Simon laod out into the deep and
[13:26] let down your nets for a drw next verse
[13:30] and Simon answered said to him Master we
[13:32] have toiled all the night think about
[13:33] that when was the last time you worked
[13:35] third shift thank God I've I don't think
[13:37] I've ever done it by God's grace I
[13:38] worked a real long second one
[13:40] time just to try to make some money in
[13:42] between my college SE semester so
[13:44] hopefully you don't have to do that
[13:45] sister paig that was an awful day I'll
[13:48] never forget that day but he worked all
[13:51] night in this rigorous monotonous job
[13:56] and see they had to work all night
[13:58] because they had to make some money
[14:00] because they know they're going to get
[14:01] taxed as soon as they get up there
[14:02] they're going to get taxed and have to
[14:03] pay it's a it's not a it's not a very
[14:06] glorious
[14:07] life now look at his respect right look
[14:09] at his respect for Jesus he said we've
[14:11] toy it all the day long we've taken
[14:13] nothing nevertheless I like that little
[14:15] speck of faith in there amen hallelujah
[14:17] he already knew he was the Messiah but I
[14:19] like that Speck of faith in there he he'
[14:20] already Jesus already told him the
[14:21] secret of his father who his father's
[14:24] name it already changed his name does
[14:25] that remind anybody of
[14:27] Abraham was it Abra the father of the
[14:29] faith who's the father of the New
[14:31] Testament Peter everybody see that name
[14:34] change Hallelujah right Abra Abram went
[14:38] from Abram to Abraham right father of
[14:41] many nations Peter went from Peter I'm
[14:43] sorry from Peter to sephus Hallelujah so
[14:46] we can see it it's a it's a beautiful
[14:48] example here he said nevertheless at Thy
[14:51] word I'll let down the net in other
[14:53] words I've seen you do great things I I
[14:55] I I I know God's with you I know God's
[14:57] anointed you I'm very tired I've worked
[14:59] all night but Lord I want to obey the
[15:01] word so I'll obey the word it's kind of
[15:03] like when when we don't feel like
[15:05] praying but yet we still pray anyway am
[15:08] right we don't maybe feel like going to
[15:09] church but we go to church anyway and
[15:12] look what God does God gives us a great
[15:13] blessing afterwards amen if we just give
[15:16] a little sacrifice if we just show God a
[15:18] little more dedication right if we just
[15:20] if we can just bring our bodies and our
[15:22] minds into subjection into obedience to
[15:24] the word of God God's going to pour out
[15:25] a blessing how many have seen it before
[15:27] hallelujah amen so how many times just
[15:30] give God the sacrifice just obey the
[15:31] word of God and God will bless you
[15:33] richly hallelujah amen verse uh
[15:37] six and when he had done this uh they
[15:40] enclosed a great multitude of fishes and
[15:42] their net break the blessing was so
[15:44] great they couldn't contain it
[15:45] Hallelujah does the Bible say he does
[15:47] exceedingly abundantly above all we ask
[15:50] or think Hallelujah I've had seasons of
[15:52] of life like that where the finances
[15:54] just flowed in like it's like the an
[15:57] like the windows of Heaven were open
[15:58] I'll tell let the sister shared I've had
[16:00] times I've had Seasons sister every
[16:01] couple weeks I go out to the mail
[16:03] there's an all this money in the in the
[16:04] mailbox unexpected right and there are
[16:07] seasons where I get tested and tried and
[16:08] I don't get those right but there are
[16:11] seasons where God pours out blessing
[16:13] upon blessing is he worthy of Our Praise
[16:17] of course he's worthy in the good times
[16:18] and the bad times but he's given Peter a
[16:21] lesson at the beginning always obey the
[16:23] word of
[16:24] God always obey my voice if you obey my
[16:28] voice everything going to be good
[16:30] Hallelujah we see that today in our day
[16:32] too verse seven and they beckoned unto
[16:35] their Partners which were in the other
[16:36] ship so not only had he worked all night
[16:38] all these other guys had worked all
[16:39] night that they should come and help
[16:40] them and they came and filled both the
[16:42] ships so that they began to
[16:43] sink you can't even contain the blessing
[16:46] that he's given verse eight and Simon
[16:48] Peter saw it he fell down at jesus'
[16:50] knees saying depart from me for I am a
[16:52] sinful man oh Lord now look at the
[16:54] humility of Peter In This Moment he
[16:56] realized I was having a mind battle I
[16:59] was battling
[17:00] double-mindedness so this clearly shows
[17:03] he didn't want to let down the
[17:04] Nets so he just obeyed by okay I'll just
[17:08] in other words I'll just go through the
[17:09] motions and the church said sometimes
[17:11] church we just go through the motions
[17:13] God help us he will that proves to help
[17:17] us amen because he knows we want to love
[17:18] him and serve him we love Jesus but
[17:21] sometimes we're exhausted and we need
[17:23] God to help us to obey so Peter sees
[17:27] this amazing miracle he says what is his
[17:29] first reaction oh I'm such a great
[17:32] man no I'm a
[17:34] sinner depart from me I can you leave my
[17:38] presence I'm not much of a man I'm a
[17:41] sinner Hallelujah and that's what we
[17:44] know when the spirit of God comes it
[17:45] always makes us humble amen no person
[17:48] here me no one musicians visitors no one
[17:52] should get any glory in the service
[17:53] except Jesus Christ amen am in your life
[17:56] in all of our Lives the only person that
[17:58] deserves glory is the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:01] Hallelujah because we realize w wow I
[18:03] could never do this if we ever have a
[18:05] testimony if we ever if anything ever
[18:07] happens to us that's a blessing it's
[18:09] because of the grace of God to us
[18:10] hallelujah that's what Peter recognizes
[18:12] so I like you to see this see he's
[18:14] battling this double-mindedness and we
[18:16] we battle the same thing I know the
[18:17] Bible says this but it's so hard okay I
[18:20] guess I'll do it well we should expect a
[18:22] great blessing Hallelujah right we
[18:24] should because Peter got one by the
[18:26] grace of God hallelujah let's look at
[18:28] the next verse there verse 9 for he was
[18:31] astonished and all that were with him at
[18:32] the draw of the fishes which they had
[18:34] taken
[18:36] Hallelujah so here when when he sees a
[18:38] miracle he's humbled and he calls
[18:40] himself a sinful man
[18:45] Hallelujah so we we want to just
[18:47] remember here that that God is faithful
[18:49] Hallelujah if we can yield ourselves uh
[18:52] Peter learns a lot of great lessons here
[18:54] he learns at the beginning that Jesus
[18:55] has power over fish Jesus has power over
[19:01] nature Hallelujah he learns a good
[19:03] lesson Jesus can provide when I've
[19:05] exhausted all my efforts and I've tried
[19:07] to provide I've tried to do what's right
[19:09] and when I fail Jesus can fill in for my
[19:12] mistakes Jesus can give me strength in
[19:14] weakness there it is amen hallelujah he
[19:17] can give me strength when I'm weak
[19:18] Hallelujah he can provide when there
[19:21] seems to be no provider Hallelujah so he
[19:23] has to learn this great lesson here as a
[19:25] a young fisherman here we'd say a young
[19:28] uh apostle
[19:29] of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah now we want
[19:31] to look at another here's another great
[19:33] one in John 6:68 another one of his
[19:36] famous lines that we've said many
[19:39] times John 6:68 now in in the in the
[19:43] context Jesus preaches about how his his
[19:47] his body is the bread his blood is the
[19:49] wine and 70 preachers scratch their head
[19:51] and say uh we don't can't understand
[19:53] this you speak hard things and then in
[19:56] verse 66 70 preachers leave Jesus right
[20:00] so he had at least 82 preachers
[20:03] following him 70 left right and then
[20:07] Jesus turns around and says do you want
[20:09] to go
[20:10] also remember that Jesus gave him a
[20:13] great test what if Jesus came to you
[20:15] today and said do you want to leave the
[20:16] church too like like all these other
[20:18] people that have left do you want to
[20:19] leave too right see it shows us that
[20:23] there's going to be times when God tests
[20:25] our faith but how many want to pass the
[20:27] test Hallelujah
[20:29] when the test comes we want to be able
[20:30] to pass it by the grace of God and here
[20:33] I love it here Peter passes the test
[20:35] amen he sees 70 preachers leave because
[20:39] they can't understand Jesus's preaching
[20:41] he watches 70 men walk away and then
[20:44] Jesus says do you want to go
[20:46] to Jesus was not a baby preacher he
[20:49] wasn't a Tickler of the
[20:51] ears he asked his inner people so that'
[20:53] be me asking our inner church do you
[20:55] want to leave today do you want to go
[20:57] now you can't because you're my son
[21:00] right but asking the adults do you want
[21:02] to
[21:03] go and he makes these marvelous words he
[21:06] says to whom shall we go thou Hast the
[21:10] words of eternal life Hallelujah he'd
[21:13] seen it operate on him remember Jesus
[21:15] told him who his dad was right told him
[21:18] he's changing his name Peter must have
[21:19] he must have wanted to be a rock he must
[21:21] have knew he was kind of on shifting
[21:23] Sands in his life right he just wanted
[21:26] to be solid he wanted to believe in God
[21:28] dad had told him about the Messiah all
[21:30] these years he just wanted to be sure is
[21:31] this really God or not and Jesus told
[21:34] him yes I am he said you've said right
[21:36] Hallelujah let's go to Matthew 16 I'm
[21:38] kind of jumping ahead of myself amen
[21:40] back to Matthew 16 verse1 16 then go to
[21:42] verse
[21:44] 17 Thou Art the Christ son of living God
[21:47] verse 17 and Jesus answered said to him
[21:50] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[21:52] Flesh and Blood ha not revealed unto
[21:54] thee this is an excellent
[21:56] point if a man talks into believing
[21:59] Jesus then another man or woman can talk
[22:01] you out of it but if God reveals it to
[22:04] you nobody can talk you out of iten and
[22:07] that's what Peter had now later now
[22:09] remember Church in a few years he would
[22:11] deny Jesus but not forever amen
[22:13] hallelujah you might have a struggle for
[22:15] a couple days but God's going to restore
[22:17] you Hallelujah you might have a
[22:19] difficult few days or weeks or months or
[22:20] something like that but if you're a
[22:22] child of God you are going to come back
[22:24] to Jesus hallelujah amen so Jesus gives
[22:26] us this great compliment
[22:29] Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this to
[22:30] you but my Father which is the spirit
[22:33] Jesus said that God is a a spirit and
[22:35] they that worship Him worship Him in
[22:37] spirit and Truth he said but my Father
[22:40] which is in secret which is in heaven
[22:41] hallelujah hallelujah the father had
[22:43] revealed this to so the God is the
[22:45] spirit so the spirit of God had revealed
[22:47] to Peter this is the
[22:49] Christ we've been waiting for him for
[22:51] 4,000 years and he's here Church no
[22:54] wonder he dropped his Nets and said fine
[22:56] I'm going to leave all my funding now
[22:58] who's going to take care of his wife and
[22:59] children in that system they just had to
[23:01] the the Jewish Community just had to
[23:03] come around and help them well I got a
[23:04] little bit of money I can share a little
[23:05] bit of fish here he left his wife and
[23:08] maybe children just in that condition
[23:10] just to be uh just to be uh at the mercy
[23:13] of the other Jewish families in the
[23:15] community but see God called him to that
[23:17] sacrifice and church don't you know God
[23:19] was going to reward him in his family
[23:21] amen it turned it came out to be really
[23:24] handy when his mother-in-law was dying
[23:25] of a fever and Jesus comes down and lays
[23:28] his hand on her and instantly she got up
[23:30] I've never seen a person get up from a
[23:31] fever like that but that's how Jesus
[23:33] operated amen you're laying down lays
[23:35] hands on her get up Hallelujah Peter had
[23:38] seen that Hallelujah right they that uh
[23:41] believe in prophets get a prophet's
[23:43] reward Jesus said hallelujah amen thank
[23:46] God Amen so there although there was
[23:48] suffering and there was tests and trials
[23:50] along with being a disciple of Jesus
[23:52] there were so many benefits Hallelujah
[23:54] I'll say this eternal benefits
[23:56] hallelujah amen and Peter got to to see
[23:59] these benefits verse
[24:01] 18 and I say unto thee that thou art
[24:03] Peter and Upon This Rock now people
[24:06] misunderstand what The Rock is it's the
[24:09] Revelation that the father gave to je to
[24:12] to Peter because that's what he said he
[24:15] said he Flesh and Blood didn't reveal to
[24:17] you the father delivered reveal it to
[24:20] you amen the rock is the Revelation amen
[24:23] the whole church is built upon
[24:24] Revelation amen and what does that mean
[24:26] it's not built on education
[24:29] because we see a lot of churches today
[24:30] they're built on education go to
[24:31] Seminary you have to forgive me I didn't
[24:33] go to Seminary but I went I went to
[24:35] God's spirit and I got the Holy Ghost
[24:37] praise I went to The Upper Room amen I
[24:39] got the Holy Ghost that's what that's
[24:40] all that matters praise God but so many
[24:43] churches today they have the education
[24:45] but then they allow such Wicked sins in
[24:47] the church whereas you can't even
[24:49] recognize it it's the same church of the
[24:51] Lord Jesus from the Bible and we've gone
[24:54] over it like the lgbq community but also
[24:56] adultery and fornication and all these
[24:59] other wickedness that doesn't resemble
[25:01] the real Church of God the real Church
[25:03] of God is Holy Peter said Peter said be
[25:06] holy for I'm holy hallelujah amen of
[25:09] course that's when he wrote first Peter
[25:10] the first Epistle of Peter hallelujah oh
[25:13] it's beautiful Upon This Rock see see
[25:16] the church is built upon the revelation
[25:18] of Jesus now some people say it's built
[25:20] upon Jesus well I agree but it's the
[25:22] revelation of Jesus you got to have a
[25:25] revelation of Jesus hallelujah amen
[25:27] right CU every everybody says well I
[25:28] believe in Jesus or A lot of churches
[25:30] say I believe in Jesus all these things
[25:31] but you have to have a revelation so
[25:34] what the gates of hell do not Prevail
[25:36] against you amen amen that's what we
[25:38] need a revelation for hallelujah we're
[25:41] going to see the gates of hell were
[25:42] against Peter many times but thank God
[25:44] the Revelation held him in the midst of
[25:46] his trials and church it'll hold you in
[25:48] the midst of your trials amen it's the
[25:51] revelation of the Holy Spirit of who
[25:53] Jesus is we know Jesus is the Risen
[25:56] Messiah today amen that's right
[26:00] Hallelujah so here we see two of the
[26:02] greatest confessions of Faith come from
[26:05] Peter because he's got the keys to the
[26:07] kingdom remember Jesus called it he also
[26:10] said it's the key of
[26:12] knowledge right and he said oh Pharisees
[26:14] you got the key of understanding but
[26:17] you're keeping those out that are trying
[26:19] to get into the kingdom of God see so
[26:22] the knowledge that that uh the knowledge
[26:24] that Peter had the key was the
[26:25] revelation of Jesus Christ remember on
[26:28] the day of Pentecost Peter took that key
[26:31] they said how do we get in the Kingdom G
[26:32] uh Peter and Peter said repent and be
[26:35] baptized every one of you in the name of
[26:37] Jesus Christ be baptized in the name of
[26:40] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[26:42] gift of the Holy Ghost Church did the
[26:43] key open the door 300 people walk
[26:46] through that door Hallelujah I'm sorry
[26:48] 3,000 3,000 people walk through that
[26:50] door Hallelujah I'm a little tired
[26:51] tonight that's why I'm messing up my
[26:52] number so it's a long it's been a long
[26:54] week amen woke up at 450 on Monday it's
[26:56] just been it's been a busy busy week
[26:58] this week Hallelujah so forgive me for
[27:00] my little mistakes but 3,000 people he
[27:02] put the key in the door of Salvation and
[27:04] 3,000 walked through that's the door we
[27:06] want to walk through Hallelujah if you
[27:08] haven't been baptized be baptized in the
[27:10] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[27:12] of sins amen hallelujah that's the first
[27:15] Bible verse I really memorized was Acts
[27:17] 238 so if you haven't memorized that one
[27:18] it's time to memorize that one
[27:20] Hallelujah so he's got the keys and then
[27:23] remember that was Acts chapter 2 but
[27:24] remember Acts chapter 8 he also uh uh
[27:28] open the door to the
[27:29] Samaritans they got baptized and they
[27:32] got the Holy Ghost the Bible said they
[27:33] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[27:35] Jesus Hallelujah so Peter opened the
[27:39] door to the Jews the Samaritans they
[27:41] were half Jew and Gentile Jews consider
[27:43] them Mong girls you know uh but they
[27:46] wouldn't worship together like in John
[27:48] chapter 4 Jesus and the woman at the
[27:49] well there but Peter opened the door to
[27:52] them God would accept them God will
[27:54] accept all those who repent and are
[27:56] baptized hallelujah amen that really
[27:58] want to serve Jesus and then Acts
[27:59] chapter 10 was was one of the most
[28:01] amazing ones Jesus gave Peter three
[28:03] visions and each time Peter said no Lord
[28:06] not so he told the Holy Spirit no three
[28:10] times he said rise kill and eat no Lord
[28:13] I've never eat that rise kill e no Lord
[28:15] rise kill e no Lord and then finally
[28:17] after three times God gives him the
[28:19] Revelation Church it proves you'll get
[28:21] the Revelation in the right time and
[28:23] season praise God Amen you can't work
[28:25] your way oh I'm really going to get a
[28:26] revelation this Wednesday night I'm
[28:27] really really I'm finally going to get
[28:29] it no you got to wait on God Church wait
[28:32] on God for the Revelation and God will
[28:34] drop it into your heart Hallelujah you
[28:36] got to receive it you can't reject it
[28:38] you have to receive the revelation of
[28:40] who Jesus is the true water baptism the
[28:43] True Church the true Holy Spirit
[28:45] Hallelujah that points us back to the
[28:47] word of God hallelujah oh that's right
[28:49] amen I'm getting happy now Glory the
[28:52] Gates of Hell will not Prevail against
[28:53] it so he opened the door to the Gentiles
[28:57] in Acts chapter 10 at the house of
[28:59] Cornelius and the Bible said they went
[29:01] and got baptized in the name of the Lord
[29:03] they got the Holy Ghost before they were
[29:04] baptized praise God they said who can
[29:07] forbid water that these having received
[29:09] the Holy Ghost uh should not be baptized
[29:11] like all the others so Peter commands
[29:13] them go be baptized in the name of Jesus
[29:15] Christ amen hallelujah what a beautiful
[29:17] story amen now I'm going to try to move
[29:19] on here by God's grace now Peter had a
[29:22] lot of great uh
[29:24] experiences he was uh we would say a
[29:27] very spur of the moment
[29:30] person now the wives don't have to say
[29:32] Amen but any of your husbands kind of
[29:33] spur the moment they'll just drop
[29:34] everything and go do something you don't
[29:35] have to say Amen
[29:37] sisters or how many brothers your wives
[29:39] are kind of spur the moment they'll just
[29:40] drop anything and go do something else
[29:42] that's kind of how Peter was he was just
[29:45] whatever came to his mind he was zealous
[29:46] about it he would just do it now it it
[29:49] it it was it was a struggle at sometimes
[29:51] but later it turned into a great
[29:52] blessing Hallelujah in other words what
[29:54] seem to be our weaknesses God can make
[29:57] our strengths praise God am if we just
[30:00] stay with the word just stay with the
[30:01] Revelation stay with the word of God
[30:03] stay in prayer stay in repenting stay in
[30:06] feeding on the word if you just stay in
[30:08] that realm God's going to make you
[30:09] strong God's going to make you stable
[30:11] he's going to set your feet on a rock
[30:13] hallelujah oh I've seen it in my life
[30:15] you've seen it in your lives Hallelujah
[30:17] this is what Peter experienced many
[30:18] times there was the spur of the moment
[30:19] remember Matthew 14:28 we know this
[30:22] about walking on water praise
[30:24] God this was a man that walked on water
[30:27] could you pull that up there and Jesus
[30:28] and Peter said to him Lord if it be if
[30:30] it be thou bid me to come unto thee on
[30:32] the water see Peter often gets
[30:35] negativity because he sank but as we
[30:38] know at least he walked on the water who
[30:40] had that idea first who had the idea of
[30:43] like wow anything's
[30:45] possible am I I could walk out to the
[30:48] Lord amen who had that Peter he was
[30:51] gonna and he he and he already had the
[30:53] keys to the kingdom praise God he was
[30:55] Kingdom Minded God help us have people
[30:57] that are kingom minded amen just in that
[31:00] moment like what was it in that moment I
[31:02] mean the storms are raging it's dark I
[31:04] mean Jesus looks like a ghost walking on
[31:06] the water which of us would have thought
[31:07] I want to walk out there that means he
[31:09] was praying right he was praying he was
[31:12] focused on God he was meditating he was
[31:13] staying in the spirit and he had this
[31:16] lead this spur of the moment brother
[31:18] that's what brother Braham calls it a
[31:19] spur of the moment in other words
[31:20] inspiration that strikes you praise God
[31:22] Amen sometimes the inspiration will
[31:24] strike you and you'll just say something
[31:26] and you know it's God
[31:28] well that's what happened here he said
[31:30] Lord if it's you invite me to come out
[31:32] and we know Peter walked out now we know
[31:34] he got his eyes off uh he got his eyes
[31:36] off Jesus that's a great minor keep your
[31:38] eyes on Christ right we've heard it for
[31:40] I've heard it all these years it's true
[31:42] we got to keep our eyes on Jesus that's
[31:43] when we fall is when we stop looking at
[31:45] the word of God we start looking at
[31:47] circumstances of Our Lives that's what
[31:49] we need in 2024 we got election coming
[31:51] up we got two Wars around the world we
[31:54] got hurricanes we need to keep our eyes
[31:55] on Jesus Christ amen
[31:58] right no matter what happens no matter
[31:59] the struggles we have to keep our eyes
[32:01] on Jesus
[32:03] Christ and then you've heard it too I
[32:04] just heard this this week too that it
[32:06] perhaps you know the he said Lord save
[32:08] me perhaps he walked right back on water
[32:11] to the boat like so some people forget
[32:14] about that it's very possible he walked
[32:16] out sank but then walked back so it
[32:19] looks like twice he walked on water
[32:21] right I mean that's that's a man of
[32:23] Faith Hallelujah that's a man Jesus is
[32:25] going to use to birth the church
[32:28] a man who believes in the impossible
[32:31] amen
[32:32] hallelujah this is such a a a blessing
[32:35] to look at the life of St Peter now here
[32:37] we're going to look at another one where
[32:38] the spur of the moment but it's not so
[32:40] much the right
[32:42] inspiration Matthew 17 verse4 you know
[32:44] know this Jesus invites three preachers
[32:47] uh Peter James and John up to mount
[32:50] Transfiguration right and then later he
[32:52] tells him don't tell this Vision until
[32:54] after I'm raised from the
[32:56] dead after the resurrection Direction
[32:58] you know the
[32:59] story they get up there and the Bible
[33:01] said they saw a vision so God gives a
[33:04] vision to Peter James and John they see
[33:06] a vision Jesus is instantly transformed
[33:08] into shining like the sun and there's
[33:10] Moses and Elijah the Bible said Elijah
[33:12] Moses talk to him about
[33:15] Calvary I imagine they went over the
[33:17] scriptures like here's this is all just
[33:19] to assure him to help him to get through
[33:21] Garden of
[33:22] Gethsemane right right and there's Moses
[33:25] he's in the promised land he never some
[33:26] people say never got oh yes he got in
[33:29] amen it was just about 1500 years later
[33:31] amen but he got in amen glory to God
[33:34] Amen and Peter sees it and now Peter in
[33:37] the spur of the moment he's got a vision
[33:38] brother Levi he's breaking a vision now
[33:41] we would think if we're in a vision we
[33:42] would say exactly right right we'd say
[33:44] exactly what was the right thing and
[33:46] Peter we' say Peter drops the ball in
[33:48] this
[33:49] one he said let us build three
[33:52] Tabernacles because of this place and
[33:54] the Bible said while he's talking God
[33:57] over Shadows him God interrupts him
[33:59] right in other words Peter not the right
[34:01] thing to say wrong time right right and
[34:04] brother said it was kind of like
[34:05] building of denomination let's build
[34:07] this denomination right here he said it
[34:10] was the same thing as cor and Dayan
[34:11] that's what the prophet said right that
[34:13] that that denominational Spirit right
[34:16] well we got to build a building we got
[34:17] to make a uh we got we got got to make a
[34:20] corporation an
[34:22] organization and the Bible says while he
[34:25] yet spake a bright Cloud overshadowed
[34:27] them and a voice said this is my beloved
[34:29] Son and whom I'm well Pleasers please
[34:31] hear ye him in other words don't hear
[34:33] Peter In This Moment hear Jesus In This
[34:35] Moment In other words Peter stop
[34:38] planning on this big all these three big
[34:41] buildings just follow
[34:44] Jesus Hallelujah but people what what do
[34:47] people want a big building it's got to
[34:49] be a big church or it's got to be a big
[34:50] home or God's not in it well I'm sorry
[34:52] God stopped this one right here it would
[34:54] have been it would have been a pretty
[34:55] reverent thing to build right right
[34:58] three big buildings for Moses uh Elijah
[35:01] and Jesus that's that's pretty
[35:03] good but God said no it's about hearing
[35:06] Christ amen at this time this ain't the
[35:09] time to build that was back in Solomon's
[35:11] day amen that was a thousand years ago
[35:13] amen Now's the Time Glory Now's the Time
[35:15] not to build a natural Church Now's the
[35:17] Time to build the spiritual church
[35:18] Hallelujah and forgive me sister Carri
[35:20] sometimes I shout too
[35:21] much and what I mean is I shout too much
[35:24] and the next day my throat hurts I can
[35:26] barely talk I just got to control myself
[35:28] I've been telling the Lord for many
[35:29] years Lord help me help me to control
[35:33] myself but see here look so we see uh
[35:36] the spur of the moment Sometimes good
[35:39] sometimes not so good Hallelujah here's
[35:43] another one uh this was after the
[35:44] resurrection John
[35:46] 21:7 you know a man was shouting from
[35:49] the shore oh cast your nets on the other
[35:51] side so Peter and John did that and they
[35:53] got a great uh draw or they got a great
[35:55] uh uh Gathering of fish fish and John
[35:58] said it's the Lord now I like what Peter
[36:01] does he puts on clothes when he goes to
[36:03] see Jesus that's what most churches
[36:05] don't do especially the women they strip
[36:08] down and then they go to church that's
[36:11] the wrong thing to do and the church
[36:12] said the Bible said women should wear
[36:14] modest clothes I was seeing it when I
[36:16] was in the Assemblies of God I'm like
[36:18] why are these women dressed like that
[36:19] look like they just went to a worldly
[36:21] dance the Bible said so he had he had
[36:24] his outer garment on when he went to see
[36:26] Jesus he put on
[36:28] clothes Hallelujah God help us amen
[36:31] right people they they read this and
[36:33] they don't even think about that but
[36:35] that's what 1 Timothy 2:9 said Paul told
[36:38] the women be modest in your clothing
[36:40] right be modest remember uh uh I think
[36:43] it's after we'll read this after that
[36:45] therefore the disciple whom Jesus loves
[36:48] to Peter it is the Lord now when Simon
[36:49] Peter heard that it was the Lord he G
[36:51] his Fisher coat into him for he was
[36:52] naked and they cast himself in the sea
[36:55] so he just had his tunic on the tunic
[36:56] was kind of like a t-shirt a long
[36:57] t-shirt uh down to the about The Shins
[37:00] and it was just like a t-shirt that's
[37:02] what it was but it probably had like
[37:03] holes for his arms or whatever you know
[37:05] and with that t-shirt he was
[37:08] naked naked in other words he was
[37:10] immodest you could see some of his uh
[37:12] body parts so he put on a coat but look
[37:15] it's the spur of the moment oh there's
[37:17] Jesus I'm putting clothes on and I'm
[37:19] going to go swim to him I want to get to
[37:20] him as fast as I can and when he got
[37:23] there uh they had to make sure it was
[37:25] him and he said give me some give me
[37:26] some bread or give me give me some some
[37:27] meat give me some fish Hallelujah and he
[37:30] ate the fish but here's another spur of
[37:32] the moment nobody else jumped out of the
[37:34] boat it was Peter there he goes jumping
[37:36] out of boats again there right walking
[37:38] out of boats jumping out of boats this
[37:39] guy he just moves he's just got to do
[37:43] something sound familiar to anybody in
[37:45] here I've got to go do this I gotta do
[37:47] the I gotta do
[37:48] that seemed like a like brother M said
[37:50] shifting Sands or what do they call it
[37:52] shifting winds you know just one from
[37:54] one thing to the next constantly moving
[37:57] sometimes it work out sometimes it
[37:58] didn't work
[37:59] out Hallelujah see but double-mindedness
[38:02] you know we we see it sometimes
[38:04] sometimes uh we struggle with the right
[38:06] thoughts right uh Peter said let's build
[38:09] Tabernacles that wasn't really what God
[38:11] was looking for at that
[38:12] moment Hallelujah now let's go back to
[38:15] Matthew 16:22 I'm I'm kind of a little
[38:17] bit jumping around so you have to pardon
[38:19] me how am I doing on time
[38:21] okay about 35
[38:24] minutes here's another one wow this is
[38:26] such a
[38:28] reminder to us now remember earlier in
[38:30] the
[38:32] chapter Jesus said who who do men say
[38:34] that I am and Peter says Thou Art the
[38:36] Christ Jesus said you've got the keys
[38:38] and you got a revelation from the father
[38:40] and the Gates of Hell won't Prevail
[38:41] against you just in a few sentences
[38:44] later Jesus pulls him aside and said
[38:46] listen I've got to go give my life I've
[38:48] got to die and but I'm going to be
[38:50] raised I'm G to be given to the hands of
[38:51] the Gentiles but I'll be raised from the
[38:53] dead verse 22 then Peter took him and
[38:55] began to rebuke him imagine rebuking God
[38:58] Church don't think bad at Peter
[38:59] sometimes we get mad at God too when God
[39:00] doesn't do what we want him to do God
[39:03] how could this person pass away how
[39:05] could I lose this money how could I how
[39:07] can I lose my job and we started saying
[39:09] God what what's wrong what God you're
[39:12] wrong no God's never wrong right we're
[39:15] the ones who need our minds changed so
[39:18] see let's not let's not bash Peter I'm
[39:20] not bashing Peter Peter will be a
[39:21] million times of Christian I'll ever be
[39:24] that's for sure but look at him you know
[39:27] in this he just got the keys and look
[39:29] what he says he says the wrong
[39:32] thing and he begins to pull him aside
[39:35] right M stand up I always use
[39:36] you let me pull let me pull you aside
[39:39] Jesus Jesus you're not going to go
[39:43] die okay I've got the keys no he didn't
[39:46] say
[39:47] that he said be it far from you this you
[39:50] not it's not going to happen what does
[39:52] Jesus say thank you
[39:54] buddy he said he said this to Peter so
[39:57] he looked at Peter I'm not going to say
[39:58] to you he said Peter he said get thee
[40:01] behind me Satan now all the all the all
[40:04] the disciples saw this he just gave him
[40:06] the keys and now he calls him the devil
[40:08] what kind of what what kind of ministry
[40:10] is
[40:11] this the devil has the
[40:13] keys but see they they had to realize he
[40:15] was speaking
[40:17] spiritually he wasn't speaking to that
[40:19] individual he's speaking to that wrong
[40:20] anointing on the individual right the
[40:23] individual was going to be saved he was
[40:24] a real man of God a real believer but he
[40:26] was just IM mature at that point just
[40:29] saying things impulse no no no no way no
[40:33] way we've seen too many miracles no way
[40:35] no no Lord no no telling God no now
[40:39] Church we're all guilty like I'm saying
[40:41] I'm not bashing Peter but we all do it
[40:44] sometimes sometimes we think God it
[40:45] should have went this way why didn't go
[40:46] my way I thought I thought you said this
[40:49] I thought this I thought that your
[40:51] thoughts don't matter my thoughts don't
[40:52] matter what matters is God's grace amen
[40:55] God giving us the grace to go through
[40:57] our lives and the struggles of life and
[40:59] still praise Him amen he says the Peter
[41:02] I said it to Peter Satan Satan you are
[41:05] an offense unto me for Satan you don't
[41:08] Savor you don't enjoy love the things
[41:11] that be of God but those be of men so
[41:14] Peter was thinking long term he was
[41:15] thinking three big
[41:17] Tabernacles right he was he just had
[41:20] this natural thought oh like it we saw
[41:23] later in the in the gospels will at this
[41:25] time Lord will at this time you rest the
[41:27] Kingdom of Israel he was thinking
[41:28] another uh big Solomon Temple you know
[41:30] he was thinking all these promises about
[41:32] the Millennium and and the the church
[41:34] age hadn't even started yet he was 2,000
[41:37] years ahead of the
[41:39] thing right because we're coming up on
[41:41] 2,000 years of church ages right right
[41:43] we're coming up on that I think it was
[41:44] what 19 something we're almost there by
[41:47] God's
[41:49] grace so see again the spur of the
[41:51] moment he goes from one moment to saying
[41:54] wow Lord's really blessed me I got the
[41:55] keys and I got I got real Revelation I'm
[41:58] going to be the leader of the church
[41:59] nobody else got the keys hallelujah
[42:01] praise God you know and then Jesus says
[42:04] Get Behind Me
[42:05] Satan right so we see this can can
[42:09] everybody see the double-mindedness
[42:11] here I can walk on water well no I can't
[42:15] uh I got the Keys of the Kingdom Jesus
[42:17] you don't have to go die Satan get
[42:19] behind me right there's just these these
[42:23] incredible highs and lows in his life
[42:25] can everybody see that by God's grace
[42:27] Church why am I saying this so it
[42:29] connects to
[42:31] you you know I've had different people
[42:33] tell me over the years you know a couple
[42:34] Brothers called me one time crying not
[42:36] from our church but they said brother
[42:38] Jesse I I said this certain thing and
[42:40] did I blashe the Holy Ghost and is God
[42:42] ever going to forgive me and I said of
[42:44] course God's going to forgive you look
[42:46] you've already got saved you're
[42:47] Sanctified you're filled with the Holy
[42:48] Ghost yes you might have said something
[42:50] awful but in your heart did you really
[42:52] mean that no so we would say the same
[42:54] thing about Peter in Peter's heart did
[42:56] he really mean if Peter would have known
[42:59] the plan of the Cross amen and how the
[43:01] cross broke every uh every demon power
[43:03] over the church and the power that would
[43:05] flow into the church would Peter have
[43:07] ever said that of course not right so
[43:10] what is it God forgives our
[43:13] ignorance God forgives our our ignorance
[43:16] God knows like the Bible said he pies us
[43:18] like children in the Book of Psalms
[43:20] right he remembers we're just dust
[43:22] Hallelujah he doesn't punish us as much
[43:25] as we deserve Hallelujah he chasen us I
[43:27] guess maybe the better word he doesn't
[43:29] chasen us as much as we really deserve
[43:33] it but Peter had to battle this
[43:37] double-mindedness we see it also now
[43:39] this is a good one too um in John
[43:41] chapter 13:8 I mean they're all good
[43:43] they're all good
[43:46] examples John 13:8 this is of course uh
[43:49] the night of the Lord's Supper The Last
[43:54] Supper Peter say to him Thou shalt never
[43:57] wash my
[43:58] feet now look at this statement Lord
[44:01] you'll never wash my
[44:04] feet uh that was kind of a Spur the-
[44:06] moment thing wasn't it now Jesus had
[44:08] already served him the bread the wine
[44:11] he'd already leaned into John and say
[44:13] John asked him who the who's the
[44:15] betrayer going to be and remember just a
[44:18] few moments before that the Bible said
[44:19] all the apostles or disciples thought is
[44:21] it me is it me is it me so Peter just
[44:23] wondered is it me is it me then the Lord
[44:25] said no it's the one who I give the
[44:26] bread to and then he missed that they
[44:28] they misunderstood even
[44:29] that then a few moments later Jesus
[44:32] takes off his garment so among among men
[44:35] that must be okay he washes their feet
[44:38] or he goes on to wash his feet and says
[44:39] no Lord he says you'll never wash my
[44:42] feet never never but within a few
[44:44] moments he's fully washed he goes from
[44:47] never to
[44:49] fully never to yes right now amen
[44:52] hallelujah see the double-mindedness of
[44:55] of a man like Peter who's strong willed
[44:57] and he was raised amongst this Roman
[44:59] environment and raised to work for a
[45:01] living and just had to do it and just
[45:03] had to to bring the fish in and provide
[45:05] for the family and pay heavy taxes and
[45:07] look like he was trapped in his
[45:09] life but that attitude that that type of
[45:12] mindset that type of mentality if it was
[45:14] properly channeled would be used for the
[45:16] kingdom of God hallelujah to start the
[45:19] church amen that's the kind of uh
[45:24] personality Jesus chose God chose to
[45:27] start the church someone with a lot of
[45:29] mistakes kind of like your pastor amen
[45:32] or your favorite preacher or whoever you
[45:34] know who who whoever you look up to
[45:36] right whoever you might look up to or
[45:38] whoever might be a leader or speaker
[45:40] anyone who might be a a some type of a
[45:42] well-known Christian I'm not well known
[45:44] that's what I'm saying but just a leader
[45:45] in the church you know they have
[45:47] mistakes but God's grace is there every
[45:50] time to forgive them and give them a
[45:52] fresh start praise God if they'll stay
[45:55] true to God God will make them stronger
[45:57] In the End Amen they have to come back
[45:59] to God though right what did Satan want
[46:02] what Satan wanted to Peter to just run
[46:04] away and never come back but we're so
[46:06] glad Jesus came looking for
[46:09] Peter amen hallelujah that's right Jesus
[46:12] came looking for his disciples because
[46:14] all the disciples had scattered like
[46:16] sheep Smite the shepherd and the Sheep
[46:19] will be scattered the prophecy said but
[46:21] the great Shepherd went looking for them
[46:23] Church don't you know he comes looking
[46:24] for you
[46:25] too when you're straying when you're
[46:27] wandering off and you're not where you
[46:29] should be who comes looking for you the
[46:31] great Shepherd the Lord
[46:33] Jesus I see so many parallels of course
[46:35] in our lives I can't get to all of them
[46:37] here
[46:38] tonight but I'm going to close with this
[46:40] I'm coming up on my hour or my 45
[46:42] minutes so yeah I'll try to preach an
[46:43] hour okay all right let me set that
[46:45] timer okay I'm coming up on my 45
[46:47] minutes
[46:49] um now think on on this all this H all
[46:52] these things are happening on the same
[46:54] night now the night of Jesus's arrest
[46:57] think of the double-mindedness here at
[46:59] first you know he's having the supper
[47:01] with the
[47:02] Lord he's wondering am I the betrayer oh
[47:04] no I'm not oh thank God you're not going
[47:06] to wash my feet wash all of
[47:10] me uh it just it's just constant change
[47:15] you know just try trying he's trying his
[47:17] best praise God church we would have
[47:18] done the same thing praise God we would
[47:20] have done the same thing we you and I
[47:22] would have been the Dy Thomas right
[47:25] we're we're not bashing these these men
[47:27] these are Mighty Men of God like I said
[47:29] I would say I'm the least in the Kingdom
[47:31] but these are Mighty Men of
[47:33] God hallelujah but we see here that
[47:38] uh it becomes a very difficult situation
[47:41] here this night because as soon as uh as
[47:44] soon as they get done with feet washing
[47:47] the Bible said they sing A Hymn and they
[47:49] go out to the Garden of
[47:51] Gethsemane remember what happened there
[47:54] Jesus said I need to pray
[47:57] he said you he said you uh it would have
[48:00] been eight you eight stay there Peter
[48:02] James and John come with me I need your
[48:04] prayers think about that if somebody in
[48:07] your life really needed prayer would you
[48:09] be able to intercede for
[48:10] them I actually forgot something before
[48:12] this before they left remember uh Jes or
[48:15] Jesus said uh no Peter said he said Lord
[48:18] he said I would die for you he said I'll
[48:21] never deny you and Jesus said before the
[48:24] crows three times I'm Sor yeah
[48:26] you'll deny me Thrice before the
[48:28] crows you'll deny me
[48:30] Thrice now look there there there's that
[48:32] spur of the moment right the wrong one
[48:34] that false
[48:35] confidence he's so confident I've had
[48:38] communion ever feel like that when you
[48:39] come out of communion sometimes I feel
[48:40] like that I'm on the mountain oh I got I
[48:43] got communion with my Lord I'm on the
[48:44] mountain amen he's just had communion
[48:47] he's Washed by Jesus I'll never I'll die
[48:49] for
[48:50] you within a matter of a few feet right
[48:54] maybe a few yards he goes out to the
[48:56] Mount of Olives and he can't even pray
[48:58] he falls asleep and Jesus goes back and
[49:01] said can you pray with me yeah I'll try
[49:03] to I'll try to break through tonight
[49:04] Lord I try to break through sometimes we
[49:07] have trouble breaking through too don't
[49:09] we and then by the time he's like well
[49:12] just sleep on get your rest right I
[49:15] can't even my closest disciples can't
[49:17] even pray for me but yet he just said
[49:19] I'll die for
[49:20] you then we know the story Judas comes
[49:23] kisses Jesus betray us thou uh your
[49:26] Master with a
[49:27] kiss what does Peter do
[49:32] shink he's he's had communion he's
[49:34] washed he's ready to he's ready to
[49:37] manifest what he spoke in there right he
[49:40] he spoke oh I'm I I'll die for you and
[49:43] look Church in all of his Zeal right his
[49:46] Zeal eats up his
[49:48] wisdom he says I'm gonna I'm gonna
[49:50] protect my Lord I'm going to protect my
[49:52] master and he cuts off his ear he misses
[49:55] thank God he missed
[49:57] that sounded like Moses killed a man
[50:00] David killed a man that same battle that
[50:03] we have as men right to protect or to
[50:06] rule or to uh just to be
[50:10] strong to have our way to to to kind try
[50:13] to back up our
[50:15] claims and yet he even fails in that and
[50:17] then Jesus heals malus's ear and says
[50:20] don't you know Peter those who take the
[50:22] sword Die By The
[50:24] Sword even in that moment so see and
[50:26] mind he's like this sword is going to
[50:28] help my Lord and Jesus said no no so see
[50:30] again double mindedness no you need the
[50:32] sword of the word amen that's the sword
[50:35] we need Hallelujah the sword of the word
[50:37] of God
[50:38] hallelujah it's not so much the the gun
[50:41] that we
[50:42] have it's the faith that we
[50:45] have so see again this double-mindedness
[50:48] a double-minded man is unstable in all
[50:50] his ways so see how Peter was unstable
[50:52] no you're not okay yes you can wash me
[50:55] uh I'll die for you and then I we see
[50:57] this no he
[51:00] doesn't my Matthew
[51:04] 2669 Peter comes to The Darkest Hour of
[51:08] his
[51:10] life think of the darkest time of your
[51:13] life hopefully you're past it I'll say
[51:15] like that but you might not
[51:18] be the darkest hour is life Matthew 2669
[51:23] now Peter sat without in the palace so
[51:25] he's kind of in like the Courtyard
[51:27] outside of the palace when Jesus is
[51:29] going on trial and a damsel came unto
[51:31] him and said thou was with Jesus of
[51:33] Galilee next
[51:35] verse but he denied before them all so
[51:38] everybody heard
[51:40] it I know not I don't know what you say
[51:45] You're With Jesus I don't know what
[51:47] you're talking about just a few hours
[51:49] maybe an hour later two hours earlier he
[51:51] just said I'll die for
[51:53] you see the double mindness
[51:59] and of course we know Peter got Grace
[52:01] but this is his Darkest Hour See sir
[52:04] Church the devil puts some of us under
[52:06] such condemnation sometimes we need to
[52:08] remember God is rich in
[52:11] Mercy if anybody had a right to feel
[52:15] condemned it was
[52:17] Peter you've heard it before Judas
[52:19] denied him once Peter denied him three
[52:24] times right Judas just did it with the
[52:26] pH es there in the
[52:28] Sanhedrin Peter did it in front of this
[52:30] whole crowd right
[52:33] here and Judas never denied that he knew
[52:35] him he just sold him out for money Peter
[52:39] denies he even knows
[52:41] him I don't I don't know who he is I
[52:43] don't know and he gets more and more mad
[52:45] as it goes on right at verse uh
[52:48] 71 and when he was gone out into the
[52:50] porch another made song so these these
[52:52] little
[52:53] girls these little foxes spoil the vine
[52:56] right right these little these little
[52:58] little tender girls a big Burly
[53:01] fisherman who's scared of nothing he's
[53:02] walked on water he's got the keys to the
[53:04] kingdom my goodness he's seen Miracle
[53:07] upon Miracle upon
[53:09] Miracle because of the threat of
[53:14] arrest the threat of arrest brother ram
[53:16] calls us he lacked real Christian
[53:20] Courage how many want courage for the
[53:22] days ahead I do Church they've this
[53:26] administ ation has banged down the doors
[53:28] of Christians they've locked up
[53:29] Christians just for praying outside of
[53:31] abortion clinics would you be willing to
[53:34] do that would you keep the
[53:37] faith I'm talking about real Christian
[53:39] Courage now I'm I'm not talking about
[53:40] playing
[53:41] church this is the moment of arrest
[53:45] possible
[53:46] death he just said a few hours ago I'll
[53:49] die for you and now he's shying away
[53:51] from that double-minded he's unstable
[53:55] because of what the pressure of
[53:57] fear but God does not give the spirit of
[54:01] fear but a power love and a sound mind
[54:05] my prayer tonight is that God would help
[54:07] me to be ready if if he if he calls me
[54:10] to go to a moment like this that I would
[54:12] keep the
[54:14] faith that I'd have real Christian
[54:16] Courage
[54:18] Hallelujah and be able to stand in the
[54:21] midst of any Obstacle of any threat our
[54:25] faith would stand and we would not deny
[54:27] the Lord
[54:31] Jesus the made saw him and said to them
[54:33] this fellow was also with Jesus of
[54:36] Nazareth next verse and again he Deni
[54:39] with an oath I give my oath I do not
[54:42] know the man I promise I don't know the
[54:46] truth about God's word I don't know the
[54:48] message I I'm not associated with
[54:49] William Bram right right or if you live
[54:52] in the days of Martin Luther I'm not
[54:54] associated with Martin Luther I don't I
[54:56] don't know anything about John
[54:58] Wesley right no I don't know anything
[55:01] about isry I I don't believe in miracles
[55:03] you know that's how people would do it
[55:06] today right same thing but we're not
[55:09] ashamed of what we believe we believe
[55:11] the Bible God's real Hallelujah God's
[55:13] word cannot change Jesus Christ is the
[55:15] same yesterday today and forever
[55:18] hallelujah praise God Amen that's right
[55:22] again he denied I give a oath I don't
[55:25] know the man verse 73 three and after a
[55:27] while came unto him they that stood by
[55:29] and said to Peter surely surely you're
[55:32] one of those see they knew he denied it
[55:34] twice already he said for thy speech be
[55:37] rathy you talk like a Galilean you got
[55:40] that akran
[55:41] accent some of you got I know our
[55:43] sisters got that English accent right we
[55:46] love that sister we love
[55:48] that verse uh
[55:50] 74 then began he to curse and to swear
[55:54] now he starts cursing
[55:57] and swearing I know not the man and
[56:00] immediately the crew could there be
[56:02] any more embarrassing moment for the man
[56:06] who held the keys to the kingdom I'll
[56:08] say like this for the pastor of the
[56:09] church that's why I start crying like oh
[56:11] God keep me from this I don't want to I
[56:13] don't want to deny Christ no matter what
[56:15] you allow in my life God help me to be
[56:18] faithful help me not to deny the Jesus
[56:21] who saved me the Jesus who loves me who
[56:24] healed my mom of cancer when I was 8
[56:25] years old and she's alive
[56:27] today done the Miracles that you and I
[56:29] have seen the healings we've seen the
[56:31] dreams we've had that have come to pass
[56:33] the prophecies and God has given us God
[56:36] help me to never deny the Jesus who
[56:38] loves me and who loves us hallelujah the
[56:41] Jesus who loves you God don't let me
[56:44] deny you I want to be true I want to say
[56:46] yes I know Jesus yes I believe the Bible
[56:49] every word of it
[56:52] Hallelujah yes I believe in the
[56:54] Supernatural this the nine gifts of the
[56:55] Holy Spirit yes I believe in the
[56:57] pre-tribulation Rapture Hallelujah yes I
[56:59] believe God's one person hallelujah amen
[57:02] yes I believe the Roman Catholic Church
[57:03] is the mother Harlot yes I believe that
[57:06] Hallelujah yes I believe William
[57:08] brandham was a prophet of God yes I
[57:10] believe Martin Luther John Wesley and uh
[57:13] William Seymour and William brandham
[57:14] restore the church
[57:16] Hallelujah yes I believe that verse
[57:20] 75 and Peter remembered the word of
[57:22] Jesus which said to him before the
[57:24] Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and he
[57:26] went out and wept
[57:29] bitterly oh
[57:31] my so finally all his all his
[57:35] double-mindedness all his shifting
[57:37] catches up to him and he
[57:40] realizes look what I've done look what
[57:43] I've done I've sworn on it I've cursed
[57:46] on it I wonder what he cursed I wonder
[57:48] if he cursed the day he was born now we
[57:49] look at that as a cuss word but is that
[57:51] a cuss word I don't know or was he
[57:52] cursing something else somebody else I
[57:55] don't I don't know was he cursing the
[57:57] followers of Jesus I don't know but he
[58:00] cursed he cursed and swore and gave
[58:03] Oaths that it was not that he wasn't a
[58:06] part of it he denied it but yet did
[58:08] Jesus leave him no ma'am no
[58:12] sir Jesus let him go through the next
[58:14] that was Thursday night right Thursday
[58:16] night Friday Saturday and into Sunday
[58:20] Jesus let him go through we'd say parts
[58:23] of four of the hardest days of his life
[58:25] remind you of anybody
[58:27] Jonah three days and nights in the belly
[58:29] of the whale because of what
[58:32] Disobedience all these foreshadows of
[58:34] Peter that's a foreshadowing of Peter
[58:36] amen oh but on that third day hallelujah
[58:39] amen on that Sunday Jesus rose and he
[58:42] showed himself first to women because
[58:44] they weren't ashamed to go to the Cross
[58:46] amen I thought the sisters would say a
[58:48] little amen a little louder on that one
[58:49] by God's
[58:51] grace God bless you I'm just joking but
[58:54] it was sisters that were faithful that
[58:56] went to the cross the men ran like a
[58:57] bunch of uh eaglets I'll say it like
[59:00] that or Lambs I'll say it Lambs brother
[59:03] I don't want to say chickens they're not
[59:04] chickens they're Eagles they're Lambs
[59:06] they W they ran like a bunch of lambs
[59:09] but the women stayed
[59:11] there and then the Bible said sometime
[59:13] after that morning then the Bible said
[59:15] he appeared to
[59:17] sephus and by the night time he was
[59:19] gathered up there and then he appeared
[59:21] in the midst and Peter got to see him
[59:23] another time so he got to see him twice
[59:25] on Resurrection Sunday today Amen
[59:27] Hallelujah Jesus personally visited
[59:29] Peter to show him I'm alive Hallelujah
[59:33] so see Church in the midst of your
[59:34] mistakes stay with God if we if you feel
[59:38] condemned confess that sin don't let the
[59:41] devil condemn you you're forgiven if you
[59:44] confess the Bible said God forgives you
[59:46] of all unrighteousness and he cleanses
[59:48] you and you walk in the Light of Christ
[59:51] as he's in the light Hallelujah there's
[59:54] cleansing power in the name of of Jesus
[59:56] Christ amen for the awfulest thing you
[1:00:00] could think of any guilt the enemy might
[1:00:03] put on you there is Mercy he even denied
[1:00:06] him he was the leader he was the one who
[1:00:10] knew Jesus so intimately one of those
[1:00:12] three inner uh disciples who had the
[1:00:14] most intimate relationship with
[1:00:19] Christ brother BR made that statement he
[1:00:22] lacked real Christian Courage God helped
[1:00:25] us to have real
[1:00:26] Christian Courage because most of us our
[1:00:29] faith hasn't been tested like Peter's
[1:00:32] was now some of them i' I've always told
[1:00:34] amen's great testimony he was tested
[1:00:36] because his dad kicked him out of the
[1:00:38] church if you're going to go to that
[1:00:39] church um you can't live here and his
[1:00:41] face did that test that's a great test
[1:00:44] most of us haven't been kicked out of
[1:00:46] our homes for believing the truth but
[1:00:48] our brother's face did the test that's
[1:00:51] right revi yeah let's say let's all say
[1:00:53] praise the Lord can we praise the Lord
[1:00:54] that's right that's right family reject
[1:00:56] you but that's what Jesus said I come to
[1:00:59] bring division in the family that's what
[1:01:00] he said I turn a father against a son
[1:01:03] Allelujah a son against a mother right a
[1:01:06] daughter against a mother-in-law and so
[1:01:07] forth I don't come to bring peace I come
[1:01:09] to bring a sword to divide who's the
[1:01:12] Sheep amen hallelujah who's the goats
[1:01:14] Hallelujah that's what the word of God
[1:01:16] does I'm trying to finish up here
[1:01:20] sorry that real Christian
[1:01:24] Courage he says Peter he was good with
[1:01:26] his sword when Jesus got in trouble he
[1:01:28] pulled out his sword he could flop any
[1:01:30] way cut the high priest he cut his
[1:01:32] servants uh ear off with a sword but
[1:01:34] when it come to real Christian Courage
[1:01:36] Peter didn't have
[1:01:39] it he was good with his sword he could
[1:01:42] duel he said as good as anybody but when
[1:01:45] it when it come to spiritual courage he
[1:01:47] didn't have it so he failed right
[1:01:49] there he said but brother after he went
[1:01:52] up to Pentecost he put on the whole
[1:01:55] armor of of God Amen he got the real
[1:01:58] sword let's say the real sword ready the
[1:02:00] real sword he had the sword but it was
[1:02:03] the wrong sword Hallelujah it was a
[1:02:05] sword of man and I'm trying to figure
[1:02:07] this out and this is about my physical
[1:02:09] strength as a man but he needed the
[1:02:11] sword of the word and that's what we
[1:02:14] have if we eat the book then the sword
[1:02:16] comes into our mouth
[1:02:18] hallelujah amen he got the full armor of
[1:02:22] God when he went up to Pentecost so what
[1:02:24] do we learn again if we want real power
[1:02:26] real courage we must be filled with the
[1:02:28] Holy
[1:02:30] Ghost saved is good you get saved just
[1:02:32] like Peter Peter got saved but then he
[1:02:34] got the Bible Jesus said he prayed Lord
[1:02:36] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[1:02:38] is truth he prayed that in John 17 so we
[1:02:42] know 50 days later Jesus's prayer was
[1:02:44] answered Peter got more Sanctified he
[1:02:46] got separated unto God and then he got
[1:02:48] the Holy Ghost he was filled with the
[1:02:50] Holy Ghost that's what we need today the
[1:02:52] real Holy Ghost we need a deeper walk
[1:02:55] with God more experience with God more
[1:02:57] power in our lives how many need more
[1:02:58] power amen oh yes my hands up
[1:03:02] too so I'm going to close
[1:03:05] now by God's grace friends remember my
[1:03:09] notes are kind of scattered here so
[1:03:10] pardon me
[1:03:13] here Peter had seen all these things
[1:03:15] he'd seen the the Miracles he'd seen
[1:03:17] walking on water he'd seen the storms
[1:03:19] he'd seen all these things but it when
[1:03:20] it came down to the threat of arrest he
[1:03:23] showed he didn't have the power he
[1:03:25] needed
[1:03:26] so Jesus had to come and talk to him
[1:03:29] about forgiveness right he said Peter do
[1:03:32] you love
[1:03:33] me what what' Peter say he said yes Lord
[1:03:36] I love you what' he say feed my sheeps
[1:03:38] right feed my sheep sorry he said Peter
[1:03:41] do you love me yes Lord feed my sheep
[1:03:46] Peter let me ask you one more time do
[1:03:47] you love me and I love what Peter said
[1:03:49] he said Lord you know all things
[1:03:51] Hallelujah you know I love you he said
[1:03:54] then feed my sheep
[1:03:56] now look the very next thing what does
[1:03:57] he do he flips back to that
[1:03:58] double-mindedness again he said oh what
[1:04:00] about John what's John going to
[1:04:02] do and Jesus said John's gonna do
[1:04:05] whatever he wants don't worry about John
[1:04:07] you put your eyes on
[1:04:09] me see that see how men see how men are
[1:04:12] Levi smile me too buddy sometimes I go
[1:04:15] from that to that and I'm like I got I
[1:04:17] try to go with the spur of the moment
[1:04:19] sometimes it works out sometimes it
[1:04:21] doesn't but God is gracious God is
[1:04:24] merciful we need the faith faith of God
[1:04:27] and in closing remember this is the
[1:04:30] man that after he got the Holy Ghost he
[1:04:33] put the key into uh he put the key of
[1:04:37] faith into the day of Pentecost 3,000
[1:04:40] people got
[1:04:42] saved nobody else has that said about
[1:04:44] them but
[1:04:45] Peter 3,000 Souls but yet had a suffer
[1:04:49] through the shame of I denied him I
[1:04:52] couldn't stand up for Jesus to for a few
[1:04:54] little girls no doubt that the devil
[1:04:56] brought that all that into his
[1:04:58] mind right but then God gave him so much
[1:05:01] Faith he walks by a paralyzed man and
[1:05:02] said such as I have I give to you rise
[1:05:05] up in the name of Jesus Christ glory
[1:05:08] amen God filled him with so much power
[1:05:10] he'd walk by and said if I can just get
[1:05:12] in the shadow see now you're in my
[1:05:13] shadow me think about that if he just
[1:05:15] walked if someone just put a sick person
[1:05:17] in the shadow of Peter they were healed
[1:05:19] praise God that's how much power he got
[1:05:22] that's what God can do with someone
[1:05:24] who's yielded now maybe for us it be
[1:05:26] like that that's a sign of an apostle
[1:05:27] but church we could lay hands on the
[1:05:29] sick and they should recover we could
[1:05:32] speak with new tongues the Bible says
[1:05:34] hallelujah the Bible tells us these
[1:05:36] things we could prophesy the Bible said
[1:05:38] God wants to pour out his spirit and
[1:05:40] this is what God did with Peter and then
[1:05:42] God even let him walk into Tabitha's
[1:05:45] house and pray for a dead woman and God
[1:05:48] raised her up from the dead hallelujah
[1:05:50] amen a man or woman that can get their
[1:05:53] their their personality channeled in
[1:05:55] into the power of the Holy Spirit God
[1:05:57] can do wonders with that individual how
[1:05:59] many want to be used by God tonight
[1:06:01] let's stand to our feet by God's grace
[1:06:02] musicians can
[1:06:06] come
[1:06:13] Hallelujah I'm sure church if you're
[1:06:15] anything like me you see yourself in the
[1:06:17] life of
[1:06:19] Peter so tonight let's pray that God
[1:06:21] would give us a single mindedness on the
[1:06:24] word of God you know maybe some maybe
[1:06:26] the Lord took me down some of these
[1:06:27] thoughts because some people will battle
[1:06:28] condemnation here tonight or like maybe
[1:06:31] like a thought well God can never
[1:06:32] forgive you surely God could forgive
[1:06:35] you the Bible said the blood of Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ forgives us of all our
[1:06:39] trespasses a l l all of our
[1:06:44] trespasses there's nothing too hard for
[1:06:47] the Lord your mistakes it's not too hard
[1:06:49] for God my mistakes it's not too hard
[1:06:52] for God he specializes in forgiving
[1:06:53] those amen amen he specializes in
[1:06:56] another chance and then church if we're
[1:06:59] stay faithful he can use us in Greater
[1:07:01] ways than we've ever been used before
[1:07:03] praise God let's bow our hearts here
[1:07:07] tonight father God we thank you for Lord

[1:07:19] what a wonderful man of God Lord he's
[1:07:22] just made more real to me these last few
[1:07:24] days have I've been looking at his life
[1:07:27] seeing how he battled
[1:07:32] double-mindedness he was unstable at
[1:07:34] times
[1:07:35] Lord then other times he was stable and
[1:07:38] you used him in Mighty ways especially
[1:07:40] after Pentecost especially after he was
[1:07:42] filled with the Holy Spirit Lord God
