grace of the Lord praise God like to look at this thought tonight as we had planned to look at the twelve New Testament mysteries so we'll start there by the grace of the Lord and I'd like to start with a little different scripture let's go to John 15:15 I like to start with this scripture tonight it's kind of the the background of what we're trying to look at here so John 15:15 like to greet everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus and all of our Saints with us today and our visitors we're so happy to have them by God's grace and I just posted it to Facebook that we're preaching this so hopefully there'll be a link on there hopefully somebody won't go on that link if not maybe later but we're so thankful for what God has done and we just got to get it out I just want to share with somebody who's never heard of before amen hallelujah and I know these mysteries have changed my life not just intellectually but literally changed my life change my heart changed my desires change the whole course of my life amen these mysteries that have been revealed by the grace of the Lord so John 15:15 and this is kind of what my first point is going to be but as you'll see the secrets are revealed Jesus's secrets are revealed to his friends and that's that's the hole that says I was studying and preparing and prayer and studying that's the thought that came to me is that if we want to be Jesus's friends then we have to know his secrets right we want to know his secrets we want to know what's hidden to the loss we want to know we want to know we don't want to be lost we don't want to be strangers we want to be his friends and his friends he tells his friends everything that he does amen all right so 15:15 let's read that together I know it's a big long one but we can handle it let's Reena on three one two three henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you let's have one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make a known into God here tonight father in heaven we raise our hands or we raise our hearts to you or looking Lord as we heard this morning Lord we're looking to Jesus Christ all of our eyes are on the banner of love of Jesus Christ hallelujah we're one army marching Lord marching to the skies Lord but before we take that heavenly flight Lord this army of God Lord we're rallying upon this flag this standard of the love of Jesus Christ and oh God above all we just want you to love us and we want to love you and we want to be your friends and and we want to be your bride Lord God we want to be yours Lord Jesus we want to serve you with all of our hearts just let your Holy Ghost take control now speak to every heart here and those livestreaming are those that we'll listen to in the archive and we trust you to be glorified in Jesus Christ's name never I said Amen god bless you to be in seated praise the Lord so we like to welcome everybody here again we're happy to have everybody here by the grace of the Lord and this whole month we wanted to take some time and share our core beliefs our foundational beliefs that are straight out of the Bible by the grace of the Lord so we welcome you in the name of Jesus we sent out 2,500 of these and so far we've had two responses so that's good Lisa B's had some responses I'm I'm happy you know the Bible says few there be that find it so you know we know there's gonna be less and less as we go on but that's good I don't want to be discouraged by that I want to be encouraged I want to keep fishing I want to keep trying to win souls by the grace of the Lord so we sent the pillar of fire post cards out and we're grateful for the response we have we heard we have heard from amen so tonight you know as planned we're in look at the 12 New Testament mysteries by the grace of the Lord and then next week we'll look at the book of Revelation unveiled we'll just hit the highlights of the revelation next week by the grace of the Lord I've been preaching I think I'm at part 79 on the revelation series here at the church so we've been preaching a lot of sermons on that but I want to hit the highlights for those who've never heard it before by God's grace so we appreciate everybody again being here and supporting this let's start with these twelve New Testament mysteries but I want to start with that thought about the mysteries and Jesus rejoiced in the mysteries of God being hidden Jesus was rejoicing about that he wasn't sad about that he wasn't upset about it Oh some people don't see it like like others do that that's how we would feel and our human compassion but Jesus had the mind of God right and he rejoiced and he's rejoice that God hid it from the wise and the prudent but he revealed it to humble little children humble little children so at school and I was preaching on the mysteries to like our sixty kids there I said you know God likes a nice game of hide-and-seek coming I said how many children know that how many who likes I didn't seek out there's any of the kids like I didn't seek out there yeah God likes hide-and-seek God hides himself and then he wants us to come seek Him he hides himself and then he whispers and he shouts however he gets ahold of you and he draws you to himself because the Bible says the glory of God to conceal a thing but it's the honor of kings the bestir spent so god is the one who really likes hide and seek the best of all amen and I'm glad to seek Him praise the Lord I want to seek him and find him amen but remember Jesus said this he was speaking of course to his disciples his seventy that came back they were rejoicing oh we've got power to cast out demons and and Jesus said notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you just don't get excited about being able to have some power over demon but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven hey rejoice that God has recognized you as a true son or daughter of God that's what we need to get excited about is that God knows about you me at you and I in heaven a then and that we're accepted in the beloved praise God that's something more to get excited about than just having power temporary power here on earth in that hour Jesus rejoice in his spirit and said now remember he was a man of sorrows but here's one time he got excited he rejoiced and said I thank thee Lord O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has to reveal them unto babes even so father for seemed good in thy sight in other words Jesus was saying Lord thank you that you saved these wonderful blessings and these powerful revelations for those who really want it amen and you're not gonna just you know cast your pearls before swine right he wasn't gonna do that Thank You Lord that only the people that really want to receive it will receive it amen that's what he was rejoicing over Lord you you're gonna you're gonna meet every person's need who's really hungry for you then you won't you won't lose one all those who want to know God can know God amen and Jesus rejoiced in that he said thank the Lord that you've revealed it unto these humble little followers amen now this is this is what struck me as I was preparing I believe I was studying a lot on this on Friday night Jesus uses the illustration of friendship to explain who knows the mysteries I hope this helps you now some churches know the mystery some don't but the churches that know the mysteries they're the Friends of God amen and we're not you know we're not trying to exalt others above but we have to look at a reality we had look at the the reality of it who really wants to know Jesus and know all about him those are the true Friends of God those who just want well I just want I just don't wanna go to hell I do want to be famous I want money I want popularity I'll go to God for that those aren't really Jesus's friends those real friends of Jesus or who are willing to take the good and the bad the blessings and the corrections they just want all of Jesus amen and they don't mind me and a partaker of his sufferings either amen because I want to know him in the powers resurrection and also want to be a partaker of his sufferings praise God so I can appreciate how he suffered in order to rule and reign over this universe amen but this is the illustration uses friendship because greater love then no no man I'm sorry hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends and there's conditions if you want to be a friend of God you've got to meet the conditions if you do whatsoever I command see so if someone's not willing to to obey the Word of God they cannot be a friend of God they've got to obey the word and they've got to obey all the Word of God amen this Holy Word so see friendship is based upon conditions I can't I can't say I'm your friend if I talk evil of you or if I uh if I trash your car if I trash your home or if I trash your name you can't really consider me a friend but if I respect you and I try to do what you asked me to do then you can call me a friend and that's how it is with Jesus we've got to do what Jesus commands us and then we're called the Friends of God they meant now of course Jesus already knows who his friends are going to be right as we said earlier he knows the chosen seed he knows all those he has for known and then he's called them predestinated them and glorified them already so we know it's a finished work in this in this time-space continuum here we don't know for sure so God gives us this time to show and prove to everybody which side were on and I want to be on the side of I'm Jesus's friend hallelujah I'm gonna do whatsoever he commands and here's our text for tonight he said I'm not calling you servants anymore because a servant doesn't know what is Lord doeth but I've called you friends for all things that I've heard of my father I have made known unto you and that in that encouragement today all that God wants you to know you're supposed to know he's gonna let you know everything he wants to happen and go on he's not gonna hide anything from you you have full access to all of God's mind amen all God wants you to have you can have it because you're a friend of God oh that's beautiful jesus said search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and look but here's here's the sad part with those religious Pharisees he said but you will not come to me in other words you will not be my friend that you might have life so we've got to come to Jesus we've got to come to the word if we want life amen Jesus invited of course come unto me all ye that Labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest did the Pharisees ever come and say I'm burdened with all these laws and regulations and legalism did they ever do that no they never got tired of that they never got tired of the sin they never got tired of the hypocrisy but you and I did you and I got tired of all burdens of our own sin so he came to Jesus and he gave us a light burden amen he took away all of our burden and gave us a light burn our sin burden and he gave us a burden to minister for Jesus amen he said learn of me see you but in order to learn of Jesus in order to be Jesus friend you got to realize he's meek he's lowly and then you find rest so if if we're gonna learn from a humble one we've got to humble ourselves just like brother Branham said or just like we know any it's fact if you go to any classroom if you don't respect that teacher you're not gonna learn anything from them because you think you already know more about it than they do and that's how Jesus is you got to come humble you got to come and say I can learn today there's things I need to work on my life needs work I need more of God's grace I need more of God's love and we got to come a humble like that and not act like we know everything about God in the Bible we got to come home oh by the grace of the Lord Jesus said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore repent behold I stand at the door and I'm knocking he's so gracious he says come to me but then he says I'm gonna come to your door knock isn't that isn't that the the best friend you could ever ask for he invites you to come but if you don't come he'll come to your door and he'll say how you get can I come in can I be your friend can I come eat with you can I come teach you can I come fellowship with you what a friend we have in Jesus and if any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come to him and he what's up with him and he with me Oh glory and member the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do and we know did God hide anything from Abraham no he revealed everything to Abraham God said for I know him that he will command his children in his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment so God is not gonna hide anything from those who are his friends he's gonna let them know what he's doing and I love this the secrets of God belong unto the Lord our God but those which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law in that beautiful church I have seven children I might not have much inheritance money to give to them but one thing I have to give to them is the will of God amen because they but the secrets of God the will of God belong to me and guess who else they belong to my children that's what the Bible says if I can't give them anything else one thing I can give them is the will of God the revelations of God and I can say these are the ways of God walk in them amen so the whole point and this is the whole point of this sermon today why why are the mysteries so important that you they do all the will of God that that's why the mysteries are so important why do you preach all mysteries why do you care about mysteries the mysteries are important because our Lord my friend tells me what he wants me to do and I'm gonna do it because I'm his friend and I care what my friend my lord my ruler my Creator I care what he thinks and I want to be his friend that's why the mysteries are so important so you can be a true friend to Christ remember Abraham the Bible said believe God and he was called the friend of God so if we are God's friend we've got to be like Abraham we've got to do all the will of God keep all the will of God that makes us the friend of God amen now and just remember this is this is interested you adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God then we can't mean both friends with Jesus and the devil you can't be friends with both whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spear that dwelleth in US lusts to envy don't you know God's a jealous God let me know that God has done so much he's given us everything he really wants your worship he really wants your friendship amen he deserves your friendship he died for your friendship and we don't we shouldn't flirt with the world we shouldn't give our things ourselves to Satan and the things of the world we should just be solely friends to Jesus Christ because it's empty it's hatred with God if you love the things of the world then you actually hate God and the Bible said the word friendship there is philia which is not a gap a love it's philia so it's fondness all the world is so great or I remember when I used to get drunk or smoked and that was so great when we used to stay up and do these evil things if you have those feelings you need to cast those down as we are this morning cast out anything that exalts itself against the Word of God amen don't be frightened even lick them down and start stomping your foot and clapping the gospel song right get back in the spirit get yourself in the love of God get yourself back in friendship with Christ because this is M nity against God to have any fondness aw it was so great when I used to be able to do this in the world and so oh I felt so good no it didn't because the end of that is death that end of all sin is death I'm almost done with this intro love not the world neither the things are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that's in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world amen and the world passeth away in the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever praise the Lord I'm gonna live forever okay well you know how to do it the Lord that's right you'll live forever do the will of God amen okay now I think already here so the conclusion is only Jesus's friends want to know the mysteries so the fact that you're here tonight it proves to some degree you want to know God's mysteries that gives you a good chance to be friends with Jesus because the rest of her all the others love the world more than they love Jesus they're lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God and so this proves that if you love the things of God and you want to know what God thinks about the word and what he thinks about your life that proves real a real good application err that you're a friend of God and you want to be on his side amen glory now let's start here I think we're starting here now this is a fresh thought I had to we're looking at the 12 New Testament mysteries but I'm also going to cover the consequences of not knowing them because there's a consequence if you don't know the secrets of God there's consequences to that because he's inviting everybody to come I want to tell you some secrets I want to tell you how to live this life I want to tell you more about my kingdom so if you reject that invitation there has to be consequences right what if you reject the invitation to your court hearing you're gonna get fine right your there's consequences to every rejection of any higher power even in our natural world you have to suffer the consequences so the grace of God I just felt it was important for those who would be streaming this short service or listening this shorter service that we let them know that there are consequences to not being the friend of Christ so we don't want the consequences we want the rewards we want the blessings of being a friend of Christ amen all right now I didn't get a chance to I had a special order as I was you know praying in studying last few days I put these in a special order and it kind of builds its way to a real kind of climax in other words what I mean is I put these in a special order so that the 12th mystery was the very last mystery that was going to take place who knows the last mystery that's going to take place the rapture of all these mysteries which is the last ones going to take place the rapture and after that then God goes back to the Jews right so I Holy Spirit was working on me working with me to put him in an order but I don't it was actually after I made this outline so it was I don't have it in that order but I want you to know if you can place these by the leadership of the Spirit of God you can place these in the order that the mysteries keep building and building and building and the very last one is where Jesus I'm taking my wife before the before the tribulation sets in I'm gonna rescue her because she's mine Satan don't touch her Jezebel system don't touch her she's mine she's already washed she's already forgiven she's already perfected Satan get your hands off her she's mine it's time for the wedding ceremony and it's also time for the marriage reception praise God the wedding supper of the Lamb in the sky amen time for three and a half years with my sweetheart alright so let's look at these like I said these are not in the order I wanted to do it so when I did the outline I had you know the general mysteries first that dealt with the church and then I built them up in the middle was that your enemies the mysteries of your enemy you got four you have to know your enemy how many know you have to know your enemy any good athlete anybody knows you got a study tape of your enemy if you want to do good again your enemy you're not just gonna walk in there and beat up some team that you don't know anything nothing about usually you need to know their tendencies you have to take notes on them you got to know what they're gonna do and we know what Satan's gonna do he's gonna try to discredit God's Word and say God's Word doesn't mean what it says but you and I can say get thee behind me that devil every word of God is yay and amen hallelujah every word of God will come to pass hallelujah so the first mystery is Israel's blindness during the Gentile dispensation if you want to know where brother BAM preaches this it's in sirs this the end time it's December 30th 1962 yeah thank you brother I was gonna say yes thank you I needed that I got my year Simon listen to the 61 sermons Revelation chapter 5 and so forth yes sir 62 now the main scripture is Romans 11:25 that's the main scripture so let's read that I'm gonna read it Romans 11:25 and some of these I'm just gonna go kind of quickly because I'm gonna try to spend the most time on the ones that are most important to us but all these are necessary these are all secrets of Jesus and I hope somebody gets excited because I hope somebody gets cuts to the revelation that Jesus has been whispered all these secrets to me all these years and I didn't even know it he's been sharing all these seekers with me except for granite let's give thanks that God has whispered Christ has been whispering this is what I only tell my friends tell this to everybody I tell this to my closest friends Oh glory Romans 11:25 thank you Jesus for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in amen so the mystery is this here's the revelation of the mystery Israel cannot recognize Jesus Christ as their Messiah until he is done saving the Gentiles yet God in His mercy will still save any faithful Jew who is true to the Jewish faith that's the mystery and where's all kinds of scripture on that like I said I had four scriptures on the it's for touch sake if there's any seed of God if there's any desire for anyone listening or here to be a friend of God you'll want to hear more of this that's how it was with me I heard one restore truth about the this two seeds in the Garden of Eden and I couldn't get enough I've been in it ever since I'm still listening looking for more revelation because I want to know the mind of God I want to be his friend glory that's the first one now that's here's the consequence I'm sorry here's another scripture the Bible actually said Paul and Barnabas they put a they put a lot in the sand they said okay since you're gonna blast him our gospel he said I'm putting a line in the sand from henceforth I'm only going to the Gentiles so he made an official proclamation we're done with the Jews were going to the Gentiles and you also know I don't think I had this one up here yeah I didn't get a chance but I want to put a charter timeline didn't have a chance to do that and I spelled that word wrong too so forgive me time alene but I want to show it to where Paul says I'm the minister to the uncircumcision so I'm the servant to the the Gentiles and Peter said I'm the minister to the circumcision the Jews but that's in Galatians chapter one and two all right there's our scripture jesus said this as well how many know of Jesus had this jesus said that Israel be trodden down of the Gentiles I'm sorry Jerusalem will be so the Muslims are going to have control of the Temple Mount until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled once the Jews get that back they got control with Jerusalem oh my now you know the rapture if it didn't already take place it's going to happen soon because we don't know exactly well the temple be built before the rapture after we don't know it looks like after but jesus said they'll not have control of it until all the gentiles that come in so we want to pay attention to what our friend tells us we don't want to let that slip right next so what's the consequence of not knowing this mystery well some may be angry with Israel for rejecting their Messiah you know them they may condemn Israel they may be condemning people that are actually getting saved a church we don't want to condemn anybody that's gonna be saved others may curse them I forgot my s there others may curse them but God already promised to bless Israel so that's the consequence of not having this revelation you don't know or you might be against the very people God is trying to bless God has brought them back to Israel God's bringing them back after they were scattered all over the world they're trying to bring them back and people might sit there with with a bad attitude or an evil spirit towards God's own people and God said can I forget a mother may forget her babies he said but I can't forget Israel because she's itching the palm of my hand I died for hey I died for Israel so the concept and this is one of the the least of the consequences right maybe trying to curse whom God has blessed okay that's a pretty easy one let's keep going now this is the one I want to do last because I believe just kind of I just felt led of the Holy Spirit I believe actually build so that 12th one the 12th one will be the last one that'll be the rapture and that's the end of the mysteries but anyways the rapture is also called the catching away or the caught up experience where the dead in Christ rise first they meet Christ in the air and then we which are alive and remain our bodies are changed and we go to the sky so what is the revelation Jesus will resurrect the dead Saints first and then change the bodies of the living Saints and take them away to heaven before pouring out his wrath and judgment now we hear a lot of preaching about this so I'm keeping this one shorter and if you want to read that this is a beautiful chapter to read about how we're either going to be saved spared from the wrath or we're going to have to go through the wrath so what's the consequence of not going in the rapture not understanding the rapture mystery all those without the revelation will be left behind and we'll have to endure the hour of temptation which is the temptation to take the mark of the beast and the wrath of God during the church relation period that's an awful consequence they're going to make a decision do I die and let this government system kill me or did I take the mark of the beast and be separated from Christ eternally that they're gonna have that choice do I die or what do I do but the Bible said because you've kept my words Jesus said I will keep you from that hour temptation amen he's going to keep his friends from that hour temptation according to Revelation 3:10 because you've kept the Word of God Oh hallelujah so there's awful consequences to not knowing the revelation of the rapture you're left behind and you're left with this life-or-death decision do I want to die do I want to do I want to wander around do I run from the government or whatever or whatever happens during that Tribulation and do or do I take the mark of the beast Oh God keep us from that amen keep us from that okay number three this was a very general one I'm not going to spend much time on this but there's one body of elect use and Gentiles so before there was a mental wall partition only the Jews could be saved I remember that from Ephesians chapter 3 there we used to be a middle wall of partition separated the Jews from the Gentiles but the Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ knocked down that wall amen and all these scriptures prove it it was a mystery so the revelation is any Jew or Gentile with the baptism of the Holy Ghost is part of the family of God with the same benefits and inheritance amen it used to be us we used to be the ones who had no inheritance but now Jesus broke down that wall and now we inherit all the blessings of God you and I used to be kept out but now it wrought in ain't ahead they've always had all the blessings you know since Moses yeah they got all these blessings and we're the ones who want to get in and now we can come in and then I say thank you Jesus I want to come in I want to be a part of the family of God I want the blessings of God if I know their inheritance Jesus you're my inheritance you're my portion amen hallelujah so what's the consequence we saw this in the scripture there are consequences to not understand this mystery if you understand this you may see gait yourself from the opposite group just like Peter did Peter got so self-righteous he stopped hanging around with Gentiles cuz he didn't understand the mystery everyone understand that memory separate itself Paul went up to him said you're to be blamed he he buckled to the pressure and he kind of got he thought about what word Jews were a little bit better than these Gentiles for fear the Bible said because he didn't quite maybe he lost the revelation the mystery or maybe he forgot it or maybe he was just too much pressure but without this revelation you'll separate yourselves and so I can't have nothing to do with the other group also let's read this Romans 11 21 this will be bless your heart if you're not careful you don't have this revelation you're and this is what we have to be very careful of in the message I think brother Brian will agree with me as a minister the gospel pride is one of our biggest hindrances in the message because we know we're not out in Babylon we know we're not worldly dressed in worldly you know doing all these kind of things but then we stop hunger after God and we can come to a stance in other words we can come to an antichrist denominational spirit and even though we're not a denomination we can get the spirit of a denomination and not hunger and thirst for more of God amen because look at the Bible said Romans 11 21 for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee so what's the Bible say you better not get prideful or God is gonna break it off that's what the Bible says Gentiles don't get prideful like you're so much better you're you're so much holier than the Jews God will break you off take heed be happy be thankful what you have rejoice in what you have do all that you can for the kingdom of God before the rapture take advantage of the blessings that we have and don't get caught up don't don't get exalted that's why I want to keep going fishing that's why I want to keep seeing salsa I don't try to get as many souls as we can say if I want to keep sending missionaries I just want to keep doing all for Jesus Christ because I don't want to get complacent because I know the spirit of complacency brother man said the Antichrist spirit sits right there on your chair next to you let me know that he's trying to cool you off oh you don't have to don't don't pull on the word don't hunger for more of God you're fine at least you're not a Catholic you know at least you're not a denominational person he tries to make you that proud Pharisee well thank God I'm not like them we don't want to be like that we must always remember that he saved us that we were old wretched in sand and porom blind and naked and we ought to be thankful that we have eyes to see so see that's a great application to this mystery that we cannot be prideful because God can break us off at any time and I know that's that's sobering isn't it Church time you say Amen that's sobering praise the Lord number four this great mystery the New Testament church is the Bride of Christ Paul said I speak a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church so this is a mystery we're not just not we're just not like a church or a body of believers or we're not a business you know we are actually the wife of Jesus Christ so any Jew and here's what here's the reaction revelation any Jew or Gentile with the baptism the Holy Ghost is placed in the throne position as brother Brian preached this morning of bride or wife of Christ the husband and so because we know we will be placed around his throne throne we live our lives in a way that we judge everything now while we're on this earth we judge it either this is right or this is wrong because we know we're gonna be placed in a judgement seat so our lives judge everything now amen that's the revelation you ever ever feel like you're being watched does anybody ever feel like to be much I'm not talking about Big Brother I'm not talking about you know conspiracy theory but this week I was thinking about that like my everywhere I go I feel like I'm me and watch and the Bible says the eyes of the Lord run to and fro upon the earth watching all your actions that's what I want I always want to know that God is watching me so I can please him I never want to forget that he's around I want to oh yes Lord even if my if it's just meeting my children and I'm in the you know in the kitchen or if it's just the children I you know out in the garage I want to remember that Jesus Christ he's right there watching me and I've got to judge things they're like I would judge it if I was in heaven praise the Lord that's the revelation we need to judge things right now and if we can't like Paul said if we can't judge little problems in the church now how are we gonna judge angels later on how are we gonna judge demons if we can't judge the problems now oh yes so what's the consequence of not knowing that the church is the wife of Christ well some may understand their relationship to Christ as simply servant rather than spouse and here's what they do they miss out on the intimacy that Christ offers to all in other words they just have a church joining experience instead of a loving experience they don't have a romance with Christ they have like a duty yes sir yes sir no sir yes sir although there's part of that too don't get me wrong but that's what they do love and the care and the tender affections that Christ has for his people they see God just like stop it stop it stop it stop doing that stop it stop it that's all they know they don't know about God's mercy and his tender kindness his loving kindness is better than life so if they don't have the revelation they don't see God as a loving father and I have a call where brother Brahim said every Christian is like a child in the sight of God because when Abraham was 99 years old God came to Abraham he said I'm a lady I he said you need to rest from me or I'm sorry you need a nurse for me I'm the breasted one amen brother have said all of us are like children of God that need to just be a child and just lean in God's wisdom and just pull ups are just pulled upon His goodness and receive His goodness as humble little children hey amen and so with out without that revelation they will not be in the throne either I forgot to put that up there they will not be in the throne if they if they can't judge what's right and wrong now they won't judge it there either they can't be trusted with that type of responsibility how many want that kind of responsibility I do by God's grace I want to be able to judge it now judge it now if I judge it now there I'll judge it right there - because I'm judging by his Spirit praise the Lord all right number five the mystery of God in Christ the Godhead so the Bible literally calls this in Colossians 2 - the Bible literally calls the Godhead a mystery it says the mystery of God and of Christ so what's the revelation behind this God is one invisible person he is not three persons God in the fullness of his Godhead became visible in a human body named Jesus Christ that is the mystery that is the revelation of the mystery of who God is is God three people you know I disagree with the wonderful man Rick Warren although I think he leans a little bit towards economic a chemical movement but I've read his book and in his book he said God was not lonely in the beginning because he had three people to talk to not Church you know you and I know that's really wrong that's that's an awful understanding brother because brother Brandon tells us God was lonely Amen church so with the wrong doctrine you got the wrong understanding with the wrong doctrine you think God has just a group and he's talking in a group with three people all the time that's nonsense but God was all alone and he felt he knew there was something inside of him and he went to have fellowship with his seed that were inside of him oh thank you Lord amen now I went over this last week remember there's a father son Holy Ghost the son became flesh in a body of Jesus Christ but the Bible said it please the father that in Jesus should all the fullness dwell so all that was all that God was was in Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily so that means the father was in Jesus because the Bible says the father's in me the father that dwelleth in me he do the works the Holy Ghost was in Jesus because the Bible said the spirit abode on him and remained on him and God giveth him the spirit without measure under Jesus and the Bible said God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and with power so if you and I understand that God had right the father son Holy Ghost was all appearing in one body and that one body's name was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can everybody see that by God's grace if you place all these scriptures together you're gonna find that it's a mystery but there's a revelation to it it's one God manifested in three different ways hey man one person and all that God was he poured into Christ amen hope everybody can see that by the grace of the Lord so what's the consequences of not knowing this you understand God as three gods and be guilty of idolatry or polytheism and last week we saw how the Beast I think Alice was here last week yeah that's right and she saw how the Beast was gonna the Antichrist spirit will blaspheme the name of God and they change God's name from Lord Jesus Christ and they change it to father son Holy Ghost and they blaspheme the name of God we don't want a blasting to God's name we want to exalt the name of God and that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so si can everybody see how there's great consequences if you don't have the revelation of God it proves you don't want it you're really not a friend of God and you're guilty of all these other consequences because you haven't received God's will amen godly Luther halfway done ever take a deep breath okay everybody on the live stream take a deep breath here we're halfway through I know about you but this is more than life to me these mysteries just bring me to life I don't know I just to think that God would show me brother Brian of all people why would God show me why would he show like a millionaire or billionaire why would God pick up a little you know piece of trash a worm like me you know why would he do that it's because of his foreknowledge it's because of his love it's because his mercy because he foreknew that we were his children praise God now 1st Timothy 3:16 says that great is the mystery of godliness and then the scripture shows how God restored godliness he did it through sending Jesus Christ and we know godliness is restored to man through the stature of a perfect man faith virtue knowledge patience patience godliness I believe is next yeah patience godliness brotherly kindness charity so godliness is restored demand and then here the botton Ephesians 4 the Bible says that we must grow up into the stature of the fullness of Christ so the revelation is God makes you like himself by incrementally adding more of his character to your life before he seals that character into your soul amen hallelujah amen glory that's why every service is important that's why every day is important of a feasting on the Word of God it's God putting more character into your life he's adding faith and burnt you a knowledge he's giving you all this and then when it's a finished product then he seals it away and then all that godly character is living in you it's a part of you and now you can express it to everybody that you come in contact with it's a great mystery sister Connie ain't ahead that mystery of godliness amen and so this is how God does it he gives you faith you want to be baptized you get recast off your unbelief you want to get baptized you get faith then you get virtue and that's strength to live it publicly like Ruth that virtue to live before the people and then now is now you understand why you're living this way and then temperance now you can control your physical body and then it gives you patience to wait on God and wait for God and then it gives you godliness where you can be just like God you can love the unlovable you can be good to someone who curses you you can be good to them because you're a child of your father in heaven and the last thing God gives you before he gives you the Holy Ghost he makes sure he gives you brotherly kindness so treat the people in the church like you ought to treat them you're not going to mistreat your brother not gonna try to pull a false deal on brother vang your brother Briner you're not gonna try to post something fast on them you're gonna have kindness toward your brother and sister in Christ I love that amen and put off with divine love the baptism of the holy spirit that's right it's a great mystery so what's the consequence of not knowing this revelation well a church goer or whoever will become more like the world than Jesus Christ their lives will be ungodly right because they don't they do not have the revelation of godliness so they ultimately become ungodly and untamed to the gospel they don't get self-control you don't get temperance they're uh they can't control themselves why just can't overcome customer I can just can't overcome drinking I can't overcome lust and and pornography they can't overcome it because they're they won't receive what the character God's trying to add to their lives they don't understand the mystery they don't understand that God's trying to grow you up into a real living monument of Christianity Hey reliving Memorial of Christianity they don't understand that they don't want understand it because they love the things of the world more than love God oh my number seven now here we go start getting into our enemy the Bible says in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7 that we know the mystery of iniquity and brother Branham said the mystery of iniquity is the Antichrist spirit and eventually that Antichrist spirit will head up into one person called the Antichrist and we believe that person will be the Pope of Rome I know that's hard I know that's rough but it's the truth and we can prove it by the Bible if you read those scriptures you'll know that so what's the revelation the revelation is God makes you fully aware of your enemy so you're not ignorant of Satan's devices thus with the full armor of God you overcome all sin hallelujah so if you have the revelation of iniquity and you know what it is you'll be able to combat against it praise the Lord amen the Bible says we are not ignorant of Satan's devices we have to be aware how does God usually tempt me how does God usually try to get I'm sorry how does I'm sorry not God how does Satan usually try to tempt me how does he work on me does he wait till I'm tired does he send somebody in and try to get me round up and I got trying to get try to blow up my temper or something like that and then when we know that we can pray against that and ask God to give us the virtue that we need and over to cat in order to cast that temptation down the next time it comes upon us amen so that's the revelation now you're aware of your enemy no I was gonna work out Hanyu brother branham said he got moody whenever he got tired so bro damn new and I get tired Satan's really gonna come after me how many would raise your hand say Satan battles me when I get tired - absolutely so bro Ram knew and as soon as brother Rama had a way to a way to make Satan stop tempting him brother Ram said I would take that and I put it in their face I put it in the face of the devil but Ram said the devil tells me you have no friends and so brother man would watch his friends drive from Georgia to Jeffersonville for one service and brother hand where he would take that and say Satan I'm putting that in your face look at all these friends I got they drive 1,000 miles to hear me preach one time I got plenty of friends get behind me Satan that's what you and I can do yeah whatever lie is telling you find something that goes against that and put it right in Satan's face it'll be a while before he comes back on that one the way to you forget about that testimony and you guys say Lord remind me of that testimony that's right so what's the consequence of not knowing the mystery of iniquity churchgoers will be deceived into thinking their worship is acceptable but will actually be vain worship they may believe a lie and be damned by it according to 2nd Thessalonians 2:13 the Bible said God will give them up I've tried to give them truth I've tried to give them truth I've tried to be their friend but he said if you don't want the truth he said I'll give you a lie and you'll be damned by that lie because you'd rather have the lie than the truth you'd rather walk in iniquity and think you're doing the right thing then accept the truth of God don't want to be a blind person I don't want to be blind I want to have my eyes open I want to honestly see what I have what is my life is my life truly reflect Christ or not I want to know what the real condition of my spiritual life is I don't want to walk around here blind and and think I'm something when I'm nothing I mean I know I'm nothing but I want to be something with Christ so you understand I want to be something with Christ I know I'm nothing of my own self but with Christ I can be a more than a conqueror all right we're moving good now 8:00 all right this is beautiful I love this man the Bible said the mystery there's the mystery of the Seven Stars in Jesus's hand in Revelation chapter one so what's the revelation the revelation is that God helps you recognize the light or star for your age or time period that you may imitate that example and shine with the same radiance hey man in other words God has sent a star to every generation remember every time period and they're supposed to recognize they're supposed to hear the voice of that angel right for their day they're supposed to see how the power of God flows out to their life and they're supposed to imitate that life because that life is the closest thing to st. Paul's life amen and lord help me to imitate that life because that's a life that's worthy of the gospel so we know the lights we know who they were Paul was the greatest light he was the light I rainiest Martin these are stars of God Columbo Luther Wesley we know brother Branham is the seventh light here and so God gave us a star in the end time so we can see how did brother Branham handle temptation how did he handle money how did he handle his family how did he handle temptation how did he handle all these things we can look at his life and God thought thought so much of it that he gave us all of his thoughts on tape as well amen we're the first Asian ever have their thoughts are right on tape amen to hear the actual voice right didn't have to you know if we didn't live in his day we can still hear his literal voice Oh Oh how He loves you and me Oh how He loves his church so what's the consequence this is very dangerous churchgoers will reject the light or truth of their time and choose to walk in darkness and I've heard some of my friends even speak blasphemy about the light of our time in other words they've said well brother Branham was of the devil they've said things like that and can you imagine saying about that about Paul Paul's of the devil can you imagine saying that that's blasphemy so it's very important that we if we don't understand don't say anything bad against God's servants right touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm if you don't understand it just just don't say anything about it because you're rejecting the light for your day it's like saying there's no such thing as the Sun yet the sun's burning you know it's giving you a nice tan there there's no such thing as the Sun that's that's that's an evil thing that'd be ludicrous that'd be ridiculous you'd have to be insane and the same thing is true you have to be insane to say that the Ministry of brother Branham was not a Bible based holy ghost film ministry amen if you actually listen to it and study that light and look at that light and examine that light you'll see it was the true light of God hallelujah all right we're getting close getting close number nine Babylon Mystery Babylon all bye ah so the revelation of this is God reveals to you who is the first or Mother Church of impersonation so who's the first church of impersonation it's the Roman Catholic Church and then the revelation is once you know that now you can come out of her or her daughter's I didn't put that up there but we know that anything that's tied to the Roman Catholic Church you come out of it because it's a cage of unclean and hateful bird that's the Word of God now I have three videos on my YouTube page and it shows I think it's either 17 or 21 heirs of the Roman Catholic Church and it's very plain to see all the wrongs you know by the scripture the scripture proves so it's plain to see that and so we have the revelation how many got the revelation and tuck tail and run out of there as fast as they could I did and I had no more association with right because we know this it's the system we love the people but it's a system that is confused system Mystery Babylon mystery confusion it's a confused system they got the word all mixed up but you and I know the perfect interpretation the word because our friend Jesus told us amen glory and he gave us a thus saith the Lord to make sure we knew it was right hahaha that's right so what's the consequence of not knowing Mystery Babylon well they'll remain in an antichrist organizational system full of unclean spirits and because they don't come out of it they actually an eventually partake of the punishments because they won't stand up against it that means they they allow it they say it's acceptable and because they say it's acceptable they have to suffer the consequences that go along with that because in their lifetime they didn't stand up for Jesus in other words they were ashamed of the gospel and they have to suffer the consequences of not standing up for Jesus Christ the word is this helpful with anybody by God's grace tonight all right I thought it would be good to review I wanted to put this number 11 actually that's the that's the book I'm feeling lead to right next oh I don't know if I told sister Wendy but or Connie but my book went to the editor so it's with the editor another they're gonna write hell up and and I got good feedback she said you must have paid good attention in grammar class I said well maybe but my wife really helped me out the most because she's already wrote one book about essential oils but anyways I just want to encourage you that that's give me a lot of encouragement you know because I want to if Todd Terry's and I go to the grave I want to leave something behind where the people can say this points us closer to Jesus Christ I will leave something behind if I can the will of God the Bible said Paul said in Ephesians 1:9 that God has made known to us the mystery of his will in other words you and I if we're the Friends of God we know what God wants us to do we're not wandering around saying I wonder what God's got me do I wonder if what you know if God wants me to do anything today we know what God wants us to do its stay with the word and then he'll reveal the position our position for us whether we're farmer doctor preacher mother grandmother whatever he worker you are will he'll reveal your position to you and you've just got to stay in your position praise God those who do the will of God have wisely pleased him accomplishing their destiny and the revelation of that will be that Christ will say well done because you've been faithful with the little church in Akron I'll make you rule over much in the Millennium now that's what I'm hoping to hear everybody bear with me I'm just making that part up good because that's what Jesus says if you're faithful with a little I'll make you ruler over much you were faithful with the new your little family now I'm gonna make you ruler over a whole nation so we want to be faithful we want to do the will of God we want to know what God's called us to do that's the revelation so what's the consequence of not knowing the will of God well you choose not to the will of God and become a stranger to Christ walk in your own will which is ultimately selfish iniquities this one goes very closely with the mystery of iniquity if you don't walk in God's path and you're gonna walk in the wrong path you're gonna get off the beaten path but how many know the Bible said thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path we're gonna walk in right ways when I'm walking godly ways we're doing what God's called us to do oh my almost done church bare with me or almost done I know you've heard it 10 times here I've heard me preach it 10 times but where with me or hope you're enjoying this here by God's grace amen mystery number 11 now this one's so long I can't get into this one but this is so long this this is a whole sermon of itself jesus said it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and then there are seven mysteries within this one mystery I me know that with Matthew chapter 13 and rogram says that as well there's seven kingdom mysteries it's in Matthew 13 3 250 let me just read over them real quick here I'll jump out of this one I'll jump into this one because I preached a whole separate service honor so the first mystery is there are four kinds of grounds that the Word of God falls on which are four classes of people there's two kinds of saved and there's two kinds of lost that's the first mystery of the kingdom of God so you are gonna be one of these how many want to be a good ground will then be honest with God's church that's all we got to do just gotta be honest with God Oh God I had a hard day had a rough week all right whatever it is I fell short Lord forgive me be honest with God let's not hide anything from our friend amen you wouldn't hide anything from your friend if they're rid of your friend the second one is the wheat and the tares we know all about this there's two seeds right of course it goes back to Garden of Eden with the serpent seed but now it's a spiritual seed either your other of your father the devil or of your father the Heavenly Father the Lord Jesus Christ there's two kinds of seeds there's only two kinds the third one is the grain of mustard seed this has a two-fold application this has the application of faith because Jesus said faith is like a grain of mustard seed and if you just keep water in that faith it'll produce something good but also it has a second application brother Branham said it's a mustard seed he said it's like a denomination it's planted and then if that little if that little air of the domination grows up it'll house all the birds and he calls those unclean spirits in other words it's the Antichrist system so the third mystery cannot can be good but can also be bad it depends which side you're on how many are on the seat of the side of faith by God's grace how many got mustard seed faith tonight amen I know yeah and you can move mountains even with a grain of seed of a mustard seed faith you can still move a mountain hallelujah for the the leaven hid in three measures of meal this has one of three applications it could be the Father Son Holy Ghost false doctrine which was the three-cornered Club brother Branham saw or it could be the three unclean spirits like frogs in the sixth vow which it would be Satan the spirit of Rome and the Pope Antichrist or it could be the threefold blasphemy of the Beast which is blaspheming God's name God's tabernacle and God's saying it could be one any of those or it could be all three of those because there's three of them and this is a whole sermon I don't have time I know you're all staring they're like I'm gonna read that real fast you know but that's a whole sermon already and I got the link to it if you would listen to the link I could give it to you the treasure hid in the field that's the fifth one this parable seems very similar to the six parallel and brother branham liken humans unto the merchants and the one great pearl as Christ so we're supposed to sell out everything and go by and make sure we can have that field that has that one great pearl that one great person Jesus Christ amen brother branham called the pearl of great price I think I'm sorry I think I overlap that was the one I just said this is in the field and there's a great treasure in the field sorry so he gives two illustrations of the pearl of great price and brother Brahim said he found that pearl his mother said that he said when I receive the Holy Ghost my mother said that boys lost his mind I said but no matter what mother thought I'd found that pearl of great price so that for a great price is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I've sold out everything just give me that pearl just give me that valuable jewel that valuable gem Jesus Christ amen glory and the seventh one was the net cast of the sea and program told us what that was he said the gospel will attract all kinds of people good people but also tract tears as well snakes wiggle worms you name it you know brother man talks about wiggle tails Turtles the true the true fish will be kept but anything that's not a genuine rainbow trout will be cast back out into the water the guy the gospel attracts all kinds of people does that help by God's grace there's seven mysteries within that one mystery of the kingdom of heaven all right last one and this really this could be the last one too but this last mystery is so crucial it's that pro of great price Christ in you the hope of glory Paul said this mysteries been hidden from from nations I'm sorry from from keep from people's and from prophets this has been hit on down all through the ages and the mystery was that Christ just didn't want to be around you he wanted in you he just didn't want to be above you you didn't want to be with you he wanted more than that he wanted to be inside of you amen that's Colossians 1 25 to 27 so what's the revelation those who are born again or baptized with the Holy Ghost have the constant abiding presence of the Holy Ghost in their souls and they are sealed as God's eternal possession so that means there's no going back brother Jose there's nothing in me that wants to go back to the world all right and trade nothing for my journey now I'm gonna make the rapture somehow whether I got to go through like they say hell or high water if I got to go through torment or whatever like David said if I go down to hell now art with me there - amen no matter what I've got to go through I'm gonna make it somehow because he's promised that he sealed his presence inside of me he's done so much for me there's no desire in my heart to go back to the things of the world I'd say it's hard when you get hurt you know like David said I could have handled the battle if you know would have been an enemy that would have beaten me up he said but it hurt when it was one of my friends it hurts when you get it really hurts when you get hurt by somebody in the church I mean know what I'm talking about but we got to have what we got to have that brotherly kindness praise the Lord we got to be able to forgive and love people in the family of God amen glory so what's the consequences of not being born again those who reject the seal of God or the born-again experience do not belong to Christ because they're not sealed they're not a finished product and possess a corruptible soul and they have little chance of being saved because remember your soul is either incorruptible the Friends of God is their divinities they're in your soul or it's corruptible it can fade away it can be abolished right it can be it can have an ending point and here's a good point let's say to our feeder you know one of the one of the restored truth is that hell is not eternal hell does not last forever and think about this it's true because in order to to be in hell forever you'd have to have eternal life to burn eternally and what kind of God would make be punished for all eternity would that be a merciful God no God is merciful church and it's merciful that sinners have a corruptible soul that even if they reject his love at some point the suffering or punishment will stop just because he's so merciful does that help you by God's grace I heard that thought and I thought my that's beautiful it's so true what kind of God would punish somebody eternally without end just for a hundred years of disobedience let's say they live 100 years old but God is merciful he'll end that he gives him a corruptible soul God is so merciful to us so lastly just so and you and I know this we've all seen this these mysteries can be understood intellectually without having that love or that great for that pearl of great price because that's what the Bible says I can have all I can have to get the prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all face that I could remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing the church you and I could have not and I believe it I believe I believe it and you could still not be God's friend but how many want to be his friend amen now how once you come here we'll close with that by God's grace do you appreciate that little message there does that help oh I just thank the Lord for that I think that's an I've already started the rough draft relieving this the next book I'm gonna start by God's grace just because I think the people need to know it don't you we already got a great book on wrote on the church ages we got a book on the seals I feel like we need a book on the mysteries if we can just borrow grams our revelation just put the scriptures in there and if it's a real seat of God they'll believe it if it's a real friend of Jesus they'll want to keep those commands because he's our friend that's just of our heads and might you just play what a friend we have in Jesus they're by God's grace in church odd I saw some you raise your hands you want to be his
