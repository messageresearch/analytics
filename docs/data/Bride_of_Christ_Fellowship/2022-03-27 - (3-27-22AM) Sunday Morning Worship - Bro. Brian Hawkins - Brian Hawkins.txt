there was persecution in the days of the early apostles and the bible said that persecution was there but god used it to spread the gospel so i just thought that was a very spiritual look at the war you know we know there's wars rumors of wars pestilences all the way to the time of the end uh but there's a preacher who knows in the message you know some of the saints there and he said perhaps perhaps it's god you know causing this dispersion in order to spread the word so we don't know uh but we know god's in control of all things but let's remember that of course we're called by the apostle paul to pray for peace that the saints can have a life of peace and spread the gospel so let's pray for peace in this situation brother brian mentioned benjamin gandy let's pray for benjamin

[Music] salvation [Music] within me them this morning praise the lord thank you musicians amen now it's by his grace so we're here this morning amen not just because of the snow but just because we could be out in the world doing other things but by his grace we're here serving the lord amen send greetings from our home church brother jim and everybody else back home and just been through some times over the past several months i lost my brother in october and lost a a good friend which i counted as a brother just recently a couple weeks ago so it's been some a trying few months you know i'm sure other people here have felt the same same type of thing so i'm not alone and that but but the lord is gracious amen this last week was the first time that i administered in about the six months so i want to say somewhere around there so bear with me this morning so i'd like to try to do a little bible study this morning if you would uh turn with me in revelation uh chapter three and i am nervous this morning so but as usual i'm just trusting that it wouldn't be it won't be long before i feel comfortable because you know it's i i pretty much always feel comfortable uh being here it's a just a good group of people and i just appreciate coming and talk to y'all i don't feel worthy enough to to to speak to you all you're wonderful people you got a good teacher and so we'll just do the best that's within within me as long as the lord leads amen so revelation chapter 3 and verse 14. i'm just going to get settled in here take this look here's there revelation 3 14. it says and unto the uh angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou art cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich now see i think people have the wrong idea when we read this scripture when they say when he's saying i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich i think people have the wrong idea as far as it's the the natural that they want to be rich they want these worldly goods they want gold silver pearls whatever it might be they want to be increased with goods and that's where the rebuke is coming from you're saying you're rich you're increased with goods but you're worthless to me but we want to have the desire of the real gold amen and keep in mind that uh what what gold represents gold represents deity amen excuse me uh and white raymond that thou mayest be clothed and that the the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent see be grateful when he corrects you because when he when he corrects you that just shows that he loves you you know don't get to the spot where stop correcting me you know i'm i'm getting tired of you correcting me telling me i'm wrong all the time while he's trying to bring something about in you he's trying to make you better amen and it's not because he's he's mad at you or dislikes you it's because he loves you so verse 20 it says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me see there's a communion going on to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let's bow our heads most gracious heavenly father just thank you for the the privilege to be here to stand behind this pulpit one more time and lord god there's nothing good in me but what you've put there in the grace that you've given oh father and there's nothing more that i depend on than the blood of jesus christ and your righteousness and every good thing that you've made oh god just appreciate your loving kindness and and the the patience that you have with us oh lord and just pray that you would help us uh to minister your word this morning i pray that you would guard my lips guard my heart guard my spirit that i wouldn't say anything wrong or contrary to your word father we just pray that the uh the ears of the the hearer and the mouth of the speaker that each would be blessed and that would be anointed help each one of us not just the speaker but help each one of us to get out of the way to receive what you have to to say to us on uh this morning father i just pray that you would be with the needs those that are sick and afflicted we pray that you would reach out and touch them this morning by the hand of your mercy may they be healed may they rise at will this day father we thank you in all things in jesus christ's name we do pray amen amen you may be seated thank you so over in matthew 6 and 18 uh it says that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly see it kind of goes back to what we were saying about the gold that people have the misrepresentation or the uh misunderstanding uh about a reward or the gold that they think it's some uh earthly riches which we know that these uh riches on earth these earthen uh riches they will they will rust they will tarnish they will they will fall away but by uh but he will never he will never uh fall away amen so it's it's our motive it's our objective of what reward we're looking for and uh so uh he shall reward thee openly lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal see you hold your treasures in your heart and you hold your treasures the the spiritual treasures no nobody can take that there's no thief that can enter in and take it away from you amen so laid not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where mother and and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither uh neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen and over in job 23 i'm just kind of setting the uh setting the foundation i guess you could say for the message so bear with me just a few scriptures to go through uh job in 23 and 10. it says but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold and again that's not as an earthly uh as an earthly treasure and that i shall come forth as gold there's a process that goes through to that you have to go through in order to make gold so you could pick up a golden nugget it's just a golden nugget but it's really not much until it's refined into something uh there has to be a refining process to to take place and see it's a different kind of a gold a gold that's tried in the fiery furnace that went through the fire of death that went through cavalry and come out a lot of this gold you got now tarnishes it'll canker it'll rust if you can mark this down saint john or james 5 1-4 and you'll get what is said or what it is said go ye rich men now with the coming of the lord weep and howl for your miseries has come upon you your gold is conquered in you see that's the kind of gold that cankers but the gold that jesus gives is the holy spirit for gold signifies deity is that right but the gold that jesus gives is the holy spirit the golden oil of the spirit pours into your heart and oh my says counsel of you come and buy of me of gold if you want to get rich malachi chapter 3 verse 1 it says behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiner's fire and like fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi now who were the sons of levi the sons of levi were the were the the priests of the old testament that was the priesthood but remember uh remember that was old testament priesthood but the bible says that we were of a royal priesthood amen made to be kings and priests so this is we're going to be purified he's going to go through the refining process to bring forth a bride worthy amen so to continue on in that verse it says and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness not in sin but an offering in righteousness you can't do you can't have something you can't have dross you can't have waste in your life but you have to come with righteousness amen so if you remember the priests would offer up if you go back to malachi 1 they would offer up second best god doesn't want second best he said give me of the choice lambs not of the second best not the lame and the maine and and the the the handicapped uh uh the the lambs or or something that that has a blemish in it i didn't mean to say a handicap but the uh a lamb that had a blemish in it he didn't receive that that's not what he wanted he wanted the choice lamb he wanted the best lamb out of the flock so we are not to be like those priests and and uh just giving up because they were just wanting something they were wanting popularity they wanted the the choice names for themselves they wanted good meat so their service was in vain because it was not pleasing unto the lord that's not what the lord had wanted they were so cold in their service to god they only went through the motions they you know they they did just enough to get by well i came to church this week i uh i might go next week you know uh i did my service it it's it's not it's not just in in going to church but it's what you get out of church going to church you're getting fellowship you're coming to praise you're coming to worship you're coming to fellowship with the with those of like precious faith amen and it's uh like iron sharpened with iron you're a little weak throughout uh through the week uh you you feel spiritually drained you come and get refreshed it's a it's a revival when you come to church it's a revival when you get into the word of god it's a revival when you praise amen glory amen see if we love him we'll do those things and and our actions will show what's on the inside amen but what i'd like to speak on this morning is a refiner's fire and fuller soap now over in first peter uh chapter one of verse 6. it says we're in ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations how many people gets weary you know throughout the week you're tempted and you're tempted and and you're just getting so weak because you're getting tired of fighting off temptations see temptation isn't sin but giving into the into the lusts of the temptation giving over to lasheviousness or malice and all these things that's what's that that's what sin is when you give into that temptation but when you overcome that temptation it does it is not sin amen so it's that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ this is something to be cherished for the trials of your faith are not just not just more as it says in there but it says much more precious than that of gold so it's something it's something to be cherished it's something to be uh something to stand before in ah there's something that's great about going through these trials amen see there's there's oh my do you realize the power of the statement that there is much that is much more precious than of gold it's much more than the gold that you got on your finger much more than the gold hanging around your neck it's much more precious than these earthly things amen but do you know what it uh do you know what it used to take to to make gold we we've got the we've got a refining process with all this technology and and they've they've got it uh down to a science now but uh but what it used to be is uh is that uh what is a refiner's fire i guess we'll we'll start that way what is a refiner's fire a refiner uh is also known as a foundry in this day so we have steel foundries aluminum foundries all these different foundries uh that mine precious metal that's how you get your that's how you get all your your cell phones and all these things they they mine the the mineral of whatever it's made of whether it be steel aluminum brass uh it goes through a mining process and in order to get that uh precious metal out of there it has to go through a refining process which means that it has to be heated up and get the dross taken out of it because it when it goes to the foundry when the refiner receives it it is it's not in its pure state as i said you could pick up a golden nugget you can go painting for gold or whatever but it's not it's potentially gold but until it goes through that refining process then it becomes much more precious it becomes much more valuable as it goes through the refining process and the same is with us we we come we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies but as we uh we repent we be we're baptized in the name of jesus christ we receive the holy ghost we were much more valuable than what we were amen we become something more precious than what we were because when we were picked up we were just full of we were full of sin we were full of dirt we were full of waste amen but going through the refining process we become something much better amen so going through refiners fire they put in us in a smelting pot way back in uh before what we have today uh they would put it into a refining pot i can't remember what you call the pot but they would put the the the ore or whatever it might be and then they put it right in the middle of the fire right in the hottest part of the flame so it uh through time it it gets hotter and hotter and it melts down but when it when the heat is applied when the heat is applied you'll see in this melting pot that it starts separating the dirt starts separating the dross or the waste starts separating from the pure material so there's a separation that happens the dirt is taken out it's scraped away see when we're tried with fire all of the impurities have to come out when we see anger jealousy etc that's what men what's manifested from within us that's the that's kind of good and that's kind of bad it's it's it's bad that it's there but it's good that you you've come to the record you've recognized that there's something that doesn't belong amen so it's it's kind of good and it's kind of bad so you think you're all good and righteous because you think you haven't sinned at all in the past week but when pressure comes it tells you something different there's something within you when you're when you become under pressure you're going to see things that you don't like hopefully you see the things that shouldn't be there because if you don't see them then you need to get the isaf see we were we were told to counsel we were counseled to buy gold tried in the fire white raiment and if you don't have it then get the isaf the isab is something that's going to help you see to remove the scales from your eyes so you could see amen so you could see the things that are unlike christ that it could be removed out of there amen so when that pressure comes and and you could think of pressure as in heat so when the heat when heat is applied pressure happens so you add a you get a pressure cooker cooker and you start adding the heat and the heat and the heat what happens after a while and not just not just a pressure cooker but if you take a a closed vessel and you put heat and heat to it heat to it it's going to cause pressure what happens if there's no relief to it it explodes and then the whole thing is ruined that's where the temper comes out when you see that temper you know you're getting under pressure you know something doesn't belong there but it's the purging of uncleanliness it's a humbling it's in humbling yourself recognizing that there's a characteristic unlike him than making the proper change you need to be worried if that watchman is sleeping on the inside and you can't accept correction because people wonder well how do i know if i have the holy ghost can you receive correction from the word that's one if you can't receive that correction then you don't have that holy spirit amen amen see this is a time of separation it's a separation from what you want and what you have yes and right now it's a mix we have we are flesh and spirited it's a mix but it has to be a separation time the wheat from the chaff amen you're mixed in with the world it's a separation you got to separate from the things of the world there has to be that kind of separation amen in jeremiah 6 and 29 it says the bellows are burned or it's worn out from continual blowing the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the founder or the refiner melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them now what are bellows you ask i'm glad you asked that bellows it's an apparatus for producing a strong current of air as for uh sounding pipe uh and you know these great big churches that have these big organs and the in the pipes in there they they've got what's called bellows to put through the sound uh what it does is it puts the air through so what i'm referring to is a bellow for fire uh it increases the draft to a fire consisting of a flexible uh valve chamber that is contracted and expanded by pumping the force air through a nozzle anybody seen a bellow i brought one with me but well i'm not going to take it out i probably should have brought it out so you can see but a bellow what i have it looks like a spade if anybody's played cards it kind of looks like a spade it's got a nozzle then it's got the body and it's got handles and it's got a hole in the side of the body where it draws in air and then when you push it it pushes air out so it's a sometimes when people hyperventilate it's like a bellow so if you does that help you understand this a little bit better that's what a bellow is is that and what it's doing is it's fanning to the coals and it's making that fire hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter the more you blow uh the more you push or get that bellow into action the the hotter the fire is going to get amen so a fire can either consume or it can purify see god is a consuming fire but he is also as a refiner's fire removing impurities but see through the smelting process when it's heated when it's in that smelting pot the thing about it is when that separation takes place a dross is being separated from it and and you scrape that away but the pure mineral stays the pure thing stays and and we're cautioned about the the wheat and the tears uh be careful not to pluck up the tears uh with uh because if if you take up the tears you're gonna take up the weed also amen yes so god has a consuming fire but that pure mineral is going to stay there amen amen matthew i know i have a lot of scripture but i got to i got to back up what i'm saying but matthew chapter 3 verse 10 it says and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire now what happened when jesus walked by that fig tree and he wanted he was hungry there was no fruit there what happened he cursed that fig tree and it died and it withered see and now the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth fruit good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire it's going to be removed if you don't have good fruit you're going to be removed from service verse 11 it says i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire amen whose fan is in his hand or it's the same concept as a bellow whose fan it is is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire unquenchable fire now not to sound like i'm condescending but an unquenchable fire is something that you can't put out right oh and it's going to eat any it's going to burn up anything in its path it's just going to take everything every anything that's around it's going to take it out yes now again a bellow is used to to fan flames to make the fire hotter repeatedly they they heat the material but when they when they do that when it becomes in a solid form what they do is they have an anvil a big solid piece of steel uh if you know what an anvil is and what they did uh never mind i'll leave but what they're doing is uh i think back then they they had a foot pedal so so what happened with the bellows it was they would just do it with the foot they would take heaven into the coals they would take it out and they would hammer they would hammer they would hammer and knock the slag off slag is also a term for for dross it's a waste it's knocking anything and pure off of it so they're they're blowing they're hammering they're blowing they're hammering and it's a process over and over and over again how many feel that they have that and you know you you suffer under temptations you're buffeted day in and day out it's it's it's war and you're just going through trial after trial after trial and it says lord give me a break i need a break that's what your threshold is but he will not put on you more than what you were able to handle amen because if the material gets too hot it will vaporize and god knows that now see you were chosen as a as a vessel before the foundation of the world he knew what you were going to be able to handle what you couldn't so he will push you to your limits to get out of you when he knows what your potential is you just think that you're all dirt that you're worth nothing that's true to a point but he knows that there's something worthwhile inside of there if you just pay attention and you follow suit and don't resist them amen he chose you before the foundation of the world he knew you'd be able to handle that pressure he is purifying for himself a peculiar people zealous of good works amen so you go along you know you're a christian but you you you just had a a little hiccup you you made a little mistake does that mean that you're lost no the fact that you're wanting to get up and continue on shows that you are his son because you can say i know i'm wrong but lord come and correct me i want to be right i want to have a pure heart amen i want to be pure now going back or going to the part in jeremiah it says the letters consumed of the fire now a different translation gives this it says the bellows burn with fire yet land is the only outcome see the point lies in the fact that the lead was used as a flux in in smelting silver ore now flux is a a mineral added to the metals uh to help with the fusion process and it uh it prevents the the uh formation of oxides so it it keeps it from getting dirty again and it helps with the with the fusion process amen it it it helps uh because when you separate uh when you're hammering you know all those electrons in there they're just scattering and getting inside excited but with the cooling process all those electrons come together again and the more heat that's applied the more scattered they are but when it gets cold the unity just comes together even more amen so it's through the tempering process hammering hammering hot hot hot hammer hammer hammer and it's just over and over and over but there's something coming out of you amen the founder or the refiner in this case uh supposedly went on with his work till the lead was melted but he found no silver at all so the the bellows were burned and it was done in vain because there was nothing that come out of it so the bellows are burned from blowing and blowing and blowing and being close to that fire it's just all worn out because it just it just couldn't take that so through that process it's done in vain because there was there was nothing there was nothing pure inside of there amen but when there is nothing precious the lead just burns up uh so the founder or the refiner is melting in vain which is a loss to the refiner so when he's trying to correct you when lord is trying to correct you and trying to correct you and trying to to lay things out before you and you're resisting then it's a waste now see uh i think it was in a uh i can't remember which message it was in but brother brandon was talking about uh how he saw the spirit i think the gentleman was up in a balcony and uh and brother branham said uh he was saying what the man was going through so he uh discernment that's the word i was looking for he discerned what the man was going through and the people around him kept trying to get the get the gentleman to go up there and he never responded so that's kind of the same situation here when the lord calls you answer the call when he's trying to correct you receive the correction because when that man walked away he probably didn't have another chance god is only obligated one time to come by your way one time if you if you refuse that one time it may be your last but not all gold is good valuable gold so not all that say not all that say lord lord have we not uh cast out demons in your name but he will say depart from me ye workers of iniquity is that right i never knew you so not all gold is good gold you have that that's i can't remember the the technical term but it's also known as uh fool's gold now see it looks like gold see on the uh on the outside it it it looks like gold but the when you put it to the test it'll absolutely show that it is not gold amen but having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof see that's the fool's gold it's a deception trying to deceive people but the lord knows what's on the inside amen the lord knows what's on the inside of your heart you could deceive man all you want but you will not deceive god he knows what's on your heart now see they use a flux usually lead or borax or something similar that is added in a certain recipe to aid in the melting process it causes a reaction to help separate the metals from impurities through the refining process excuse me when it's cooled the materials separate from each other then when it becomes solid it's beaten to get the remaining drops off to make it more more pure or more valuable it's refined again to get more of the impurities out see we're buffeted into perfection the lord may add some things in our lives that cause us to become uncomfortable that's so we separate from the things of the world all all of the things might be in the same melting pot but they need to become separated now see we wonder why we go through so many trials it's a work in your life to get the malice and the lust and the backbiting and all the other imperfections out it's not done until all the impurities are chipped away and the pearl of great price is all cleaned up amen james chapter 1 excuse me verse 2 it says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing now see in the olden days way before that technology that we have now the refiner had to keep a watchful eye on that smelting pot see much like god has to always keep an eye on us is that right but he will never leave you he will never forsake you that the metal has to be heated to an almost an exact temperature once it reaches that exact temperature it's getting close to the final product if the refiner is careless the metal could start to vaporize if it overheats it weakens the material but that's okay it's not a complete loss because you could put it back in with the same material so when you get into a backslidden condition it's not a total loss you're not lost you just get into fellowship with believers again amen because you could repent you could become you could be recycled amen oh my so when you when you fall it doesn't mean that you're completely gone repent amen and get a refreshing of the holy spirit to be tried one more time amen today they have ray tech guns it's a laser gun to monitor the heat before they had to watch it uh for it to be done so how did they know it was done you ever hear that they have to see the reflection see silver and gold when it when it's done it gets so shiny that the refiner could see its reflection it's not like a mirror so don't don't think of it that way it's not a crystal but it gets it gets shiny enough to where the refiner can see his reflection so when we're going through the the the diver's temptations when we're going through the the heat of the battle and all these fires and all this correction when he when the lord sees the reflection he could say that is my son i see myself in him amen so that's how the refiner knows that the practice product is done when he could see himself in that material amen and see people should see christ in us amen and we walk with christ in us the hope of glory giving others hope in a lost and dying world see we're preaching the gospel we're preaching the gospel even if we're not using words oh i i think i've said it here before that i saw a thing that preached the gospel use words if necessary but people will see the actions of a believer i don't know if you know brother ronnie long he was out ministering for us here a little while back and when they were at the hotel they were in an elevator and this little girl uh said i think it was to her mama said look mommy there's some christians that not how you want to be people would recognize and see that you were a christian amen but see in the time of time of trouble they they might they might ridicule and make fun and persecute you but in the time of trouble they're going to know who to run to and you know what they do they're going to be just like nicodemus when they come to jesus when he came to jesus in the nighttime they're going to come to you private because they don't want all the other people that that heard heard them making fun of you coming to you and asking you questions amen amen i've seen it i've had it happen to me so yes it happens they're going to know where to go to because uh just like that that that uh that young man uh was with that woman in in in the house i think she was cooking i can't remember exactly the the details of it but there was a tornado coming by and she was at peace and the young man was wondering how she could be at peace but she was she was a christian she knew where she was she was at peace so why was she worried and this young man was was so told about he was he was so nervous about this potential tornado and then he was asking well how are you so calm because i got peace with my lord and savior now see we're on this earth preaching the gospel trying to reach to those that are lost amen we're not trying to again they have the misunderstanding of what a christian what's so wrong with being a christian in this day a christian is a they do good deeds at least they're supposed to they do good things but why do people hate them so much is it because they're doing good why are they fighting against the bible so hard what is so wrong with the bible when it tries to get people to do good what is wrong with it of course i'm biased because i'm a christian and i believe the bible to be the truth but they're scared of it why are they scared of it because they don't want to get they don't want to get right they're not at peace yes they love the things that they're doing right they love that spirit that's on the inside and they continue to pet that spirit yes they love their drinking they love their smoking they love their carousing they don't want to do anything different because if they know once they come into this presence they i think they actually know deep within that there's a changing that will happen if they and i think they're afraid to change they're afraid of that change to happen because they're no longer going to smoke they're not no longer going to drink they're no longer going to gamble they're no longer going to do these ungodly things right amen the strength of a christian we're not out to make fun of them we're out to save their souls so when we try to correct them look there's a better way to come we it's because they love you there's a love on the inside of them they don't want them lost we don't want them lost we want to show them the right path to come it's not to say that that we're better than you it's not that and if anybody does that then shame on them because we're not better than anybody the difference between us and a sinner is we have an advocate with the father we can go to the father and say lord forgive me and that's how we receive that peace we're not better than anybody we just have a god that's better than everybody amen but god rejects outward services as worthless to atone for sins it doesn't matter how rich bill gates is it doesn't matter how rich the zuckerberg is it doesn't matter how rich these people are they're not going to buy their way to heaven they're not going to buy the blood of jesus christ but he counsels them to buy of him the gold so forsake all your worldly treasures bill gates and zuckerberg and everybody else that's that's rich out in this world your riches are worthless in this world or in the world to come it might get you places in this world but it's not going to get you it's not going to get you to the streets of gold and we don't long for the streets of gold just because it's gold we long for the streets of gold because of the who's in the presence of the streets of gold amen i long to be there with my savior amen amen but god rejects the outward services as worthless to atone for sins sacrifice and incense were to to direct them to a mediator but when offered to purchase a license to go on and sin they provoke god with it the sins of god's professing people make them an easy prey to their enemies they dare not show themselves saints may rejoice in hope of of god's mercies though they see them only in the promise sinners must born for fear of god's judgments though they see them only in the threatenings they are the worst of revolters and are all corrupters sinners soon become tempters they are compared to or supposed to have good metal in it but which proves all dross nothing will prevail to part between them and their sins reprobate silver shall they be called useless and worthless when warnings and corrections and rebukes and all means of grace leave men unrenewed they will be left as rejected of god to everlasting misery let us pray then that we may be refined by the lord as silver is refined just remember you're either going in you're in the middle or you're coming out of a trial but he will not put on you more on on you more than what you are able forgive me lord and try me one more time i'll be yours dear lord if you'll be mine if i fall or if i fail let me rise and try again forgive me lord try me one more time one more time yes i might have followed this this day or that day but lord one more time forgive me lord that's the heart of a believer one that has a broken and contrite spirit one that is not proud in spirit but like i said of a broken and a contrite spirit one that is able to receive correction one that is able to be refined by the fire no matter how hot it gets they're willing to go through the fire they're willing to go through the the trials they're willing to come through these things they're willing to be refined proverbs 17 verse 3 it says the finding pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord trieth the hearts and in proverbs 25 and 4 it says take away the drost from the silver and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer it is a vessel of honor amen removing the impurities to recover the purest of the mineral and purging of all uncleanliness isaiah 1 and 25 it says and i will turn my hand upon thee and purely pour purge away the draws and take away thy all thy ten ten is an alloy separated from the silver similar to draws but it's not complete garbage tin is still a useful mineral we use tin we use molten tin i work at a glass factory so when you have all this this all this material that gets melted down it goes through a refining process where the defects are removed through a heating process so with heat it removes the defects but when it gets into what we call a bath it it floats on molten tin so to to us to in the glass industry tin is a valuable uh mineral it's something that we use to get through the float process so again tin is something that's that's separated from the silver and like i said it's similar to dross but it's not complete garbage but still we have the potential people out in the world we try to separate from them but they're not complete garbage there's still a potential for a value it is not complete garbage and that's how a a believer feels is that at least they ought to that they have uh compassion for those that are uh if you're not a pure believer they have compassion on those that want you to be valuable they want them to become a believer amen amen but did you ever see them when they was fixing uh to mold a bell some famous bell for a church chime or or something that had to give a certain ding you see you're ringing a chime and i'm talking about pure material here you see if you're ringing a chime it takes a certain range for each bell and it takes certain materials to go in there so much brass and so much steel and so much of other oars to go into this bell if it's just straight brass it won't ring right it's got to have all kinds of materials thrown into it to make it ring the right kind of a tone and the man who has put the mold up and set the mold he knows exactly what it takes to go in to that uh in that cupid cupola i'm not sure how you say that cupola what it takes to go into that that that metal to make that bell ring that tone see god is our great cupola he is the great refiner's furnace that where he has to put these things upon us and trials and persecutions and things to mold it together for the working for his perfection to make our testimony ring for a certain time and a certain note that he once rang out on us in a certain day we're made different all of us are made different amen we're all made different we see different but we all see one thing and that's jesus christ let's look at him and the only way you can see see him if he looks contrary to this word you're not looking at him for that's that is him so if you see a creed or some certain denomination that that you just think i belong to that and that's enough if it doesn't look at that word then look away from it look to that word and that's what we're looking for christ the manifestation of god's word he is the vindication of god's word amen now that i spoke to you about refiners fire you have a little understanding of what the refiner's fire is and its purpose i'd like to talk about the fuller soap now malachi 3 and verse 22 it says but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiner's fire and fuller soap this is what we read earlier fuller soap what is it washing clean with soap or lie now the washing process parallels that of the refiner process soaking alone will not clean the garment right those that do laundry you know if you if you got dirt and grime on on your garment just throwing it in a in a pot of water to soak it is that is not the cleaning process because if you leave that garment sit soak in there sit and idle for for a period of time what happens it gets to stink it doesn't so we know that just just because you receive the word and then you sit there and you don't act on it it's it you become stinky so it's not an idleness so soaking alone will not clean the garment but there has to be some kind of a friction take place there has to be a scrubbing take place so back in the old days they had uh uh what we have now is a washing machine and what you have in there is a is a is an agitator of course they make it now with without the agitator but the agitator would just go back and forth back and forth and it would agitate and it would just make those clothes rub against each other or and it would rub that soap that's in there and it and and soap doesn't really it aids in the cleaning process but if you just throw soap on it and you leave it there it doesn't do anything so it's a combination you need to go on so it's not just in justification it's not just in sanctification but it's going on to perfection with the holy ghost amen so when that agitator's in there of course back in the old day like i started saying they had a they had a washboard and it was the same concept as that they would rub it rub it up and down they would rub it on the washboard they would add the soap into it they would put it in the water and they would rub it on the washboard and what's that doing that's creating friction to get the dirt out of there and if you go back even further before washboards boy when they got the washboards they thought they were technologically advanced but even way back they would use rocks they would take it to the river stream and and whatever uh like the bed of the river they would take it what's in there the rocks in there and they were just but it's the friction it's the fiery trials that we have to go through to get us clean amen so it's not just in soap it's not just it's sitting uh soaking in water but there's a friction that takes place there's action that has to take place amen see when you add the soap to it it still needs to be rinsed we still need to be rinsed with the washing of the water of the word amen whoo revelation 3 18. uh we read it earlier it says i canceled you to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment white raymond if you have something white are you going to go out to an italian restaurant you're going to eat spaghetti or lasagna or anything like that no we're not most people shy away from that okay i got some white on i am not eating sauce if they're conscientious about it but what is it about a white raymond white as you know is going to be hard to keep clean because if you get a little bit of dirt on it you see that there's a blemish in it already it's dirty so he's saying he he's counseling to buy uh the the gold tried in the fire and then he's saying a white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou may see now what is it about white what's so what's so important about white why is he signifying a white raymond why not a black raymond raymond is closed by the way uh why not blue i'm kind of partial to i'm kind of partial to blue myself i like black i like gray those are my colors but what is so significant about a white garment purity virginity undefiled unspotted amen now jesus speaking here in john 15 and 3 it says now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you so it's the word that does the cleaning in our lives amen we you type ourselves as as the garment we want to be white we want to be unspotted from the things of the world but it's through the word that he is uh that he has spoken to us that's what has cleansed us amen and titus chapter 3 and verse 4 sorry i'm talking fast i think i'm running out of time titus chapter 3 verse 4 it says but after that the kindness and love of god our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy i mean that seems elementary that we're past that right by now right that we know that it's not of our works ephesians 2 8 we already know that right but it says not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost amen which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life amen in mark 9 mark chapter 9 verse 1 it says and he said unto them verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power and after six days jesus take taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them now here's here's the whole thing right here and verse 3 it says and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fooler on earth can white them so it's not even man's intervention man can't even wipe that garment amen but it has to be of god amen that's how pure god is we can't do anything about that amen and verse 4 it says and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were talking with jesus now as i said you can't get more pure than this it's beyond man's capabilities amen so as no fooler on earth can white them there is no no launderer a fuller is a launderer just like a refiner as somebody who's who's refining the uh a process or a founder so oh my so we know that it's not of us amen if i could i'd like to to go through this and share something with you just to kind of help support some of the things that i've been saying this is looks can be deceiving it's something that i it's an article that was i uh it just says larry uh through the messiah messianic light website uh written by larry this is something that he put in there it says looks can be deceiving bear with me if you need to stand up you can stand up but it'll be a few minutes with this one of these coins is dated 1964 minting began not long after president kennedy was assassinated this coin is comprised of 90 silver and 10 percent copper the same alloy used in all silver coins in the united states in 1964. sometimes they are called junk silver because they are relatively plentiful and have no new numismatic collector value based on silver prices at the time i write this the melt value of this coin is around 8.75 one of the coins uh is dated 1969 and is the least worn and best looking of the three beginning i wish i had them here to show you but i don't have any uh beginning in 1965 the makeup of u.s coins was changed though a special alloy was used for the for the kennedy half dollar from 1965 to 1970. this coin is made of uh 40 silver and 60 percent copper based on silver prices at the time i write this the melt value of a 1969 kennedy half dollar is around three and a half dollars because it has less silver in it than the coin of 1964. so the third coin is dated 1971 the newest of the bunch the last year for the special alloy for half dollar coins was 1970. beginning in 1971 the kennedy half dollar like all other circulated u.s silver coins was made from about 92 percent copper and 8 percent nickel this silver coin contains no silver at all and has a melt value of less than 10 cents but the lord said to samuel do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature because i have rejected him for the lord sees not as man sees man looks on the outward appearance but the lord looks on the heart so you might be able to put on an outward show but it's what's on the inside amen in some ways people are like these coins we may may appear to be the same or perhaps just as these coins exhibit different levels of where we may appear to be either better or worse than others in some aspect and though we may not always be able to tell the difference god knows what is inside we may show some kind of good that conceals the imperfections within but god sees through the facade god knows the heart amen so how pure is pure it says but who can endure the day of his coming and who can stand when he appears for he is like a refiner's fire and like like fuller soap he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver we read that already but sterling silver is used in jewelry and fine flatware is 92.5 percent by weight pure silver and seven and a half percent by weight some other material usually copper pure silver is a softer material and the alloy made with copper increases its hardness but the alloy material also makes the silver more prone to tarnishing sterling silver is hard and easily tarnished because it is impure oh this is a good one procter gamble trademarked the name ivory for its new soap product in 1874. according to png's website the founder's son harley proctor was distracted in church one sunday trying to come up with the name with a name for his new soap when he heard someone reading psalm 45 and 8 he knew what to call it all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made have made thee glad i don't know do you remember the tagline for ivory soap proctor procter gamble they claimed ivory soap was 99 and 41 hundredths percent pure ivory is so pure that it floats another of its taglines but being 99.44 pure means that something amounting to 0.56 percent must be impure so through all that it's not even all that pure so just a little tidbit to share with you about coins and a little bit of soap anybody use ivory you ever hear of ivory everybody okay okay this morning all right uh i've never heard anybody say no yet revelation 19 and verse 6. praise the lord it says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints who prepares the bride herself she herself makes herself ready with the preparation of the gospel being prepared means to be ready beforehand in advance i'm pretty sure that i've said it here uh being in the service we had what's called a mobility bag you had to have things pre-packed in case that they called said hey we're sending you over yonder well you don't have time to pack things up so you have to have things in preparation you have to be ready you have to have your soul you have to have your spirit you have to have your whole being ready for when that when that time of the rapture comes because you're not going to have time to take care of things for when that trump sounds and he call it that's the time of going away it's not going to be hey i'm letting you know i'm taking you up yonder it's a happening now thing so you got to have things ready now there's no time for you to wait there's no time for you to prepare it's a happening now when that calling away happens when you hear that voice if you hear that voice you're going amen and i want to make sure that i'm ready amen the bride has to purify herself and be disconnected we're separated from all draws amen or all sin amen well what does a bride-to-be do to get ready all the brides here one of the most important things to a bride is the garment right the groom is probably important too but on the wedding day they're concerned so concerned about the garment that everything is ready that everything looks okay their hair is in place there's the the gown looks the way that it should be there's nothing there's no dirt there's no no no rips or tears or anything they're they they're so concerned about the wedding gown the wedding garment it's so important to a bride amen and what we what we've read we know the the the garment is the the righteousness of saints so we must be righteous amen that's in preparations it's not our righteousness but it's taking on his righteousness he became sin for us that we would take on his righteousness amen some like to get away from in this day some like to get away from that old white gown because it's so traditional it's so cliche it's so this it's so that they want to be so individualistic or so individual individualist in this day they they just want to do something away from the norm because everybody else was doing it it's so old amen but i want to continue on with this amen i want to continue on clothing myself with his word again what does white signify it signifies purity white is an inherently positive color is associated with purity virginity innocence light goodness heaven safety brilliance illumination understanding cleanliness faith beginnings sterility spirituality possibility humility sincerity a lot of ideas protection softness and perfection oh that was a good one softness oh my hallelujah but we're arrayed in fine white linen because our scarlet sins have been washed white as snow amen and it's not something that man can do but it's something that the lord has done saints are righteous because he is righteous so if you think that doing your laundry is absolutely worse job to do ever our god is the greatest laundromat ever amen i'll have him do my laundry anytime he's a founder man and he's a laundromat amen i'll try not to be too much longer so if you're wondering what religion is well i don't want to be religious why don't either how can you say that because in religious in the religious realms they do things that are so ceremonious and and it's over and over and a lot of times it's not even pleasing a lot of times it's not even right right it's not in the traditions of men but pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted unspotted unspotted from the world amen we're preparing for his promise character is the victory needed to handle the promise amen character is essential for power not that we desire power to rule the world like a politician or a villain or a dictator but power without character is satanic we gain character through the testing and the trials of fire and being cleansed by the washing of the water of the word character is what defines us it's not in your mistakes it's not in your faults and your failures that's not what defines you but your character of how you handle those things that's what defines you how you handle people how you interact with people how you handle god's word how you receive god's word that's what defines you it's not in selfishness of caring the word why i got a law to myself it's not us for no more but it's whosoever will going out reaching to the lost it's a dying world we're preaching this word as dying man today man amen amen it's a responsibility to be a minister wouldn't you say brother jesse it's a high responsibility because you have people looking to you and hanging on to every word what you say the conduct that you carry would you have confidence in brother jesse if he was out carousing with women hanging out in the bars not every friday night every saturday night hanging out in the gambling parlors would you have confidence in that man no you wouldn't why because it doesn't measure up to what the word says you wouldn't have a confidence in this man being your pastor if he was out cheating people causing wrong or making raw deals or shady deals with people because it's deceptive you can't put your trust in somebody like that but it's a character i believe you have confidence in him because of his character people of a congregation have confidence in the pastor because of their character now if they've got the right character follow that man as he follows christ amen now i'm going to put the responsibility on you because we are all ministers of christ is that right we all minister the gospel you might not be up here behind a pulpit screaming and spitting and shouting and and and whatever else but you're out and about amongst the people those your neighbor your coworker your family even though they might call you and say that you're in a cult you could still minister to them all in their response because you're being refined by the word of god you're learning how to handle the word of god you're learning how to rightly divide the word of god you're learning how to handle truth you're learning how to deliver the you're not delivering the promise but you're presenting the promise to people you are a lively hope you give people hope whether you think that you're not worthy of it or not people see your life and you give them hope you are a light to the world it's not our light but we carry his light within us so therefore you are a light to the world you carry the gospel all the burden is not put on the preacher not on the on the pastor not on the on the prophet nor the the fivefold ministry all the burden isn't put on them yes you carry some of that burden you come and you hear the word of god you go and repeat the word of god this is where we we become shaped this is where questions are answered how many times have you found it that you've had a question in the word and then it might be a week you might have read something lord i don't understand it but if you give it over to god in prayer i'm telling you because it happened to me i know it's happened to brother jesse if there's something that we don't understand we give it over to prayer to god and given by time by and by it will come forth the answer will come you just have to hold on don't give up just because you haven't gotten the answer in a week or a couple weeks or a month or a year but how many times have you sat in a service not saying anything to anybody i was just reading on that scripture man i've been wondering about that and there's a there's a minister and it's not another man don't don't think that i'm saying it's a man because we already said that it's it's beyond man's capabilities but it's being led of the holy spirit coming and speaking to you the things that you have need of i've prayed you know we have the lexicon it's easy to go back and try to to to get get the understanding we have all these commentaries out there to try to understand the word of god or to to understand a certain passage we've got google we've got we've got oodles of internet out there but until god makes it real to you it has to be a revelation to you it's worth the wait i've i've had it that i didn't understand something and i prayed about it and i prayed about it and i prayed about it lord i don't understand it i don't understand it but one day there's that one day don't lose hope because one day you'll get your one day it was made real to me i didn't have to go ask somebody i didn't have to go to the lexicon actually i was trying not to because i was putting god to the test i know that sounds uh what's the word i want to say it almost sounds blasphemous but i was putting the lord to the to the test to make sure that he was going to be there for me so and i did and he delivered just because you don't see something right away just because you don't see a miracle happen right away it doesn't mean that god is isn't working amen now i got way off i got to come back but i was talking about character character is what defines us and tells us what our placing is because if you if you look at your character and you can't line up with what's black and white in this in this bible you know if you're you're of the other seed amen yes sir but you can't take all of your worldly goods is that right but what you're going to take with you is your character you could save up all the all the money you want to you could deceive all the people that you want to get more money and and and get more of this worldly good but you're not taking it with us bill gates isn't taking all that with them sorry i don't know of any people that are richer than these people so they're some of the richest people in the world but they're not going to take it with them guess where it's going it's going to the next generation because he can't take it with him and then the next generation they can't take it neither yep you can live high on the org here while you're on in this world and you're forsaking god the whole time but until you give over to him then things start happening in your life i'm gonna i'm gonna start closing ezekiel 22 and verse 17. it says and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man the house of israel is to me become dross all they are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even the dross of silver the lord is looking for something pure of a broken and a contrite spirit amen therefore thus saith the lord god because you are become dross behold therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tend into the midst of the of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury and i will leave you there and melt you yay i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you but the lord saw how unclean israel become so he said he would put them in the fire to melt and separate the uncleanness he was very displeased with them why because they wouldn't be obedient the lord loves obedience well you might say well that was back that was back in ezekiel that was back in in the old testament well there's going to be a separation time and it's going to be in the everlasting fire that shall now be quenched it will be an unquenchable fire choose your destination carefully amen go ahead stand your feet i've got more but for time's sake but i think you get the point i think you get the point just like to share this with you as we close something to something to uh to dwell on here a little while back i was getting uh my safety glasses and uh i'd come across two sisters this is the first time i'd come across their path and uh they were dressed modestly so i was inquisitive as to why they were dressed so modestly so uh to my complete surprise they they told me that they were uh they were catholic they went to a catholic church so uh well come to find out you know brother bran have talked about there are so many denominations in this world we know that there are so many denominations that we've got denominations inside of denominations and inside of those denominations you've got more denomination so we see that it's a it's a never-ending process they're always going to have their own idea they're going to go off by themselves and stay instead of staying with the true word of god but seeing that they were they were dressed in as as holiness i felt compelled to to say something uh to them as as far as uh being witnesses uh uh to those that are out in the world you know so what you are what you do is a testimony what you are is a witness as you're you're walking amongst those out in the world but i told the daughter to keep doing what she's doing regardless of the criticism how many have received criticism just because you wear skirts and dresses and what's so wrong with wearing a skirt and a dress why it's so old-fashioned and well you wear short shorts and you wear pants or whatever it might you wear what you want to be you want to be your individual self because that's what this world is and uh they just want to do their own thing again what's so wrong with wearing a skirt because i think it's something that strikes in their heart that they can't submit to yes sir so i i i thought later that i wish i had told her that she was more of a warrior than what she realizes sisters you're more of a warrior than what you realize since i can't tell them i'm going to tell you yes you are more of a warrior than what you realize that's right you know we have men of decades and centuries long going out to war they were warriors yes yes we have women this in this day that they're letting to go to combat and i completely disagree with that i completely disagree with it because it's a well one that's not where a woman belongs two it's a distraction to me i think it's a distraction in my opinion this is my opinion i think it's a it's a distraction to the rest of the marines soldiers airmen and sailors and it causes more breakups in a home because when you're around something so much you tend to fall with it you tend to take part with it in a way that you shouldn't yes sir so that i know i'm kind of getting off on that i i try to bring it back here but you are more of a warrior than what you think a stay-at-home mom a lot of people have the misconception of what a stay-at-home mom is well they stay at home and they do nothing all day well if they homeschool their pro my wife probably works harder than i do not so much of physical labor but in taking care of the children taking care of the house doing the school taking care of appointments doing all this other stuff and yet staying true to god matter what the pressures that come yeah men have their pressures women have different pressures they're under a different pressure than what we are and it seems like we hold them to a different standard to what men are held to yeah it's easy it's easy for a man to just go out and throw on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt or whatever and just blend in it's much easier for a man to blend in but there's something different about the bride there's something different about a woman a righteous woman a proverbs 31 woman amen there's something different about it there are churches there are churches there are churches and there are bride there's a bride and that bride is going to be different from all the other ones from all those churches is it going to go unnoticed no they're going to notice that there's something different just like you sisters walking around walking amongst these people out in the world they're going to notice something is different right off the bat they're going to notice something is different continue to take the stand that you do even when people that claim to be a christian downplay the importance of modesty they defend the very act of exposing certain parts of a woman's body they're truly deceived and thinking that it has no effect on men and they use homosexuals to cover that case in point i saw something on facebook where uh somebody had on there this this was years ago and uh it's it it bothered me so bad but the the they they were trying to come across saying that if uh if uh if a woman that likes women can control themselves around an immodestly dressed woman then it's not the clothes that the person is wearing but it's the person it's the man's fault the man should be able to control himself well i'm going to say it like this and i know that that the brother is recording this and i know this is streaming over the internet and i know that somebody's going to hear it outside of this room but i'm going to say that is so far from the truth because it's a perversion a woman can't feel i don't care what transition she goes under a woman cannot feel the same feelings of a man and a man cannot feel the same feelings that a woman feels biologically you are a man or you are a woman so to say that if a woman that likes women can control themselves something on the inside see when when a man looks upon a woman immodestly dressed something happens to that man there's a there's a process that's why men have to look away because something is taking place in the mind and in the body that a righteous man has to fight that desire off that's why it's important to dress in modesty to keep from your brothers falling to keep your brothers from entering in a place that they shouldn't be to keep their mind pure that's why we have that's why brother brandon had a cross on his rear view mirror that's why a righteous man in his heart is going to turn his eyes away from that immodesty because something has taken place in his mind and a righteous man doesn't want to contend with that battle that's a battle that that man does not want to take yes sir so you see the importance the importance of modesty when a woman is trying is dressed in a way that's revealing herself potentially it's going to cause that man to enter into sin that's the importance of modesty not only that it causes adultery amen i know it's not the most popular thing but that's something that i got to speak out against i feel compelled to say something of the importance of how you dress amen the importance of a woman of a righteous woman dressing appropriately musicians count i'm just going to read a portion of this scripture it's in john 17. let me find the spider i'll start at verse 9. says i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are while i was with them in the world i kept them in my name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world i pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world but that thou shouldst keep them from
