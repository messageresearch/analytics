========================================

God's promises to Israel here in Romans chapter 11 I preached on this a couple years ago but it would have been three years ago by now I think by God's grace when I preached uh through the book that the Lord had me right by God's grace Romans 11 verse1 definitely encourage you know we're more than halfway done through the book I think there's 16 chapters so we're more than halfway by God's grace hallelujah amen I'll read verse one and then we'll read verse Two by God's grace I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin let's read verse two on three one two three God hath not Cast Away his people which he fornew what ye not what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying amen let's have have one more word of prayer if you m on your heart let's make it know to God Heavenly Father we just come again humbly into your presence Lord God anoint us God speak to us here Lord Jesus speak to me Father God and we just want to make our request unto you Lord you know what we have need of so bless us here tonight in your divine presence Lord God father we want to say Lord thank you that our eyes are open Lord this chapter clearly shows how Israel is blinded father thank you for letting our eyes see the Gospel of Jesus Christ what a wonderful beautiful thing it is as we saw on Sunday Lord the righteousness of Jesus Christ thank God that we can see it Lord God and Lord It's not by our works but by Grace we thank you for Amazing Grace in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you being seated praise God so let's get through this uh read through this chapter here it's like I said it's a little bit of a review from a few years ago if anybody can remember back to those uh the series when I preach on the spiritual blindness of Israel Hallelujah so we read verse one uh Paul says hath God uh Cast Away his people and he says uh God forbid so God has not forsaken Israel Hallelujah because then he says uh because I am a Seed of Abraham Hallelujah of The Tribe of Benjamin so he puts himself in there of course he's speaking of that day at the present day he's speaking of the present day Jews was God finished with present day Jews and he says no he said even I am a Seed of Abraham verse two God hath not Cast Away his people which he forew so now we get this uh again the Revelation from chapter 8 about predestination God fornew hallelujah forn knowledge was first Hallelujah God forew who would choose him and then because of his for knowledge then he could predestinate the events of Our Lives amen so we see this Paul brings forn knowledge into Israel and understanding Israel's place so that means just apply it to today that means God knows all about the Israel Hamas war god knew about October 7th right that's when it started right The Invasion just like we all remember September 11th in America right right we remember that because it was such a disastrous day well God forew it yet God allowed it right take gives me Comfort God allows what happened today or what happened this week for you know our family you know God foresees everything he allowed it for a purpose amen God has for knowledge and as we go through the tests and trials God many times wants to see what we're going to say about it how we're going to act about it praise God are we going to give God praise or we're going to withhold the praise amen as we saying we always got a reason to praise Hallelujah so God is Not Cast Away Israel and then he goes to this idea of Elijah uh he say don't you remember what uh God said about Elijah he made intercession to God against Israel verse three saying Lord they've killed thy prophets and and dig down thine altars and I'm left alone and they seek my life so he felt like he was all alone right Elijah thought he was the only one left right and so anyone that says prophets don't make mistakes or prophets are infallible you know of course they're wrong but it's another clear example right and I ran into one of those people this week again on the comments and I asked him what about all these things that brother brandom you know corrected later and he said well we don't he said we just believe every word and we'll let God figure that out later but God doesn't uh ask us to to to be ignorant of things right God doesn't ask us to believe things that we know or clearly there see seems to be some contradiction God's not saying turn off your discernment God's not saying turn off your brain when you come to church right your understanding your knowledge but the Bible said grow in knowledge somebody asked me that oh yeah um one of the sisters from Junction City I guess she went to a wonderful meeting there in Alabama she said I've believe I have the Holy Ghost brother Jesse uh I said praise the Lord she said but the devil's been fighting me this whole drive up from Alabama that's a long car ride kind of like Abraham right all those miles he was walking the devil was battling him and the de she said the devil's been telling me you can't have the Holy Ghost because you don't understand the whole Bible I said Well when the people got the holy ghost in the Bible some of the Bible wasn't even written yet right right and if if you have to understand the whole Bible to know you're born again then Jesus was wrong when Jesus said the Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth after you already got it right so and then I shared you know Peter said grow in Grace sorry grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord battling little dry throat here sorry so Peter says you still got to grow right you still got to grow as a Christian even though he's born again he still got to grow as a Christian Hallelujah pardon me I just got a little dry throat there I don't have a water up here uh L you want to get me a water there could you get oh yeah okay thank you I usually don't drink water when I preach but usually don't have a a runny nose when I preach either or bat on a cough or anything like that all right so um get back here to the scriptures by God's grace verse four but what sayith the answer of God unto him unto Elijah I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baos I love this um God Saves a Remnant God always has a small group that he will have as Believers hallelujah thank you hun appreciate that Dar thank you thanks for ministering to me doesn't the bride always minister to the the groom is that the scripture are we going to minister to Christ brother man always use that illustration right so I love this God forn knows and so God can reserve a small group now do you remember that that story how did God Reserve 7,000 well God reserved some of them by uh which which man was it he hid uh prophets Obadiah was it Obadiah Obadiah had prophets and he fed them bread and water out in the cave can you imagine that you know God says I'm going to save some people how does he do it he lets them hide out in a cave right that's the same God that would send fire down from heaven for Elijah the same God right like I said there on on Sunday the same God that saved Shadrach mear and abedo in a literal fire then allowed Daniel's parents to to be slaughtered same God same God so what what we must understand is that whatever God allows God just is putting us to the test and he wants to see us stand upon the word of God Amen whether delivered or whether not delivered just like those three Hebrew children no matter what happens we're not going to bow to the devil hallelujah we're going to keep the word of God hallelujah we're going to obey the word of God so no matter the test you go through the same answer in every test stand on God's word Hallelujah by God's grace help us not to compromise on our faith Hallelujah I want to preach a I've had that thought for a while I just want to preach a Ser a sermon called compromise so I've been looking at that meditating on that you know trying to gather some scriptures on that compromise right we don't want to compromise on the word of God hallelujah pardon me okay now so God reserves 7,000 so God had 7,000 he said are not going to Bow the knee I love how God always reserves himself a Remnant and now we get to verse five even so then in this present time also there's a Remnant according to the election of Grace Hallelujah so Paul says just like there were 7,000 in the Days of Elijah he said so there is a small group today that will recognize Christ and as we'll see still be saved even though they're blinded so God always has a Remnant when it looks like there's nobody else when when it feels like we're the only one oh there's other people hallelujah there there's others Hallelujah now before the Rapture Church it will get down to the last person with the baptism of the Holy Ghost will have it the last one that's going to get it is going to get it by God's grace but then the Bible says at that moment he that's holy let him be holy that means he that's got the Holy Ghost he's got the Holy Ghost he that's righteous he that's a foolish virgin let him be a foolish virgin so at that Rapture moment you are what you are right that's what the Bible says in revelation 22 so at some point it's going to be that final one gets the Holy Ghost the final one gets saved and then when all the names on the on the book are redeemed and are experiencing the grace of God then Jesus will come back to Rapture the bride Hallelujah because we can see that plainly in scripture so there there's going to be a moment when that final one the final one elected to the Holy Ghost the final one elected to the foolish virgin uh will have that experience and then Jesus will come and rescue the bride Hallelujah just like he did with uh just like he did with uh uh Enoch was rescued right before the the flood Hallelujah Enoch was rescued Before the Flood Elijah was rescued Hallelujah each time there's a Rapture that they were rescued by the grace of God now uh even Esther Esther was rescued from Death Hallelujah verse six now and if by Grace so if there is a Remnant by Grace then is no more works okay otherwise Grace is no more Grace but if it be by works then is no more grace otherwise work is no more work that's quite isn't that quite a statement wow what a statement if you are if you are in God's elected group if you're in that called out group you didn't work it up God just gave you Grace to be there now the difference is God gave God offered the grace to everybody but you were the ones that accepted it praise God you're the one that accepted that gift receipt and said yes I'll go into that Variety Store boy I need to go in there tonight and get some I need make sure honey make sure I check out before I leave here by God's grace I check out with some Grace and peace and hope you know how about that and kindness I was saying I'm not gonna say what I'm saying I better leave that alone by but see uh we didn't work for it like we didn't earn it it was by God's grace it's like like Abraham you know we just walked in the grace that was given to us right awesome we just we just heard the voice of God we just followed the voice of God it's by God's grace and every time we stumbled God forgave us and we kept going on Hallelujah right it's by Grace we didn't you know we didn't work it as far as like we didn't earn it by our works it was offered to everybody we told other people about the message how many people have we invited to church and how many people why didn't they come well that was their choice but it was offered it was all offered by Grace Hallelujah you know church and really you know the victories we've had it's been by Grace right uh you know yeah we sacrificed we prayed you know small things like that but really the victory was God because greater is he that's in us than in than he that's in the world like the victory was because of him Hallelujah and yes yeah we did we did surrender we did obey by his grace like we finally obey right like I've said many times you know if God ever does anything good in my life it's because I finally yielded amen I finally got I finally obeyed the word of God it took a while but by God's grace we obeyed amen amen same thing with Abraham finally you know finally he obeyed remember God had to visit him time and time again until he finally believed Hallelujah that's Grace hallelujah amen right Abraham didn't earn a body change it was God's it was just God's calling for him amen hallelujah and he walked into it but wasn't lot invited yes lot was invited too but he chose to go down to Sodom and goor right or Sodom rather he chose to go down there but it was offered to him he knew about the prophet amen he knew about the promised son he knew about Sarah he knew about that Hallelujah so it's not by our works but it's by Grace hallelujah amen always it's going to be by Grace Hallelujah so just always keep that in your heart and mind it's or saved by remember Paul said I labor not by works but by the grace that's given unto me and let me go back to that illustration you either got five bags of gold five talents of gold two or one According To Jesus that was given to you by grace and all that you can purchase with that was a gift like you're just using somebody else's money God's money your talents and and everything you can purchase on this Earth remember the Bible says buy the truth and sell it not every you can everything you can buy and purchase and invest in the kingdom of God was you didn't you didn't pay for it it was just given to you right amen like that ability you have to see dreams or the ability that you have to testify to people that was a gift of Goden that was still not your money that was God's money that's why it's all it all goes back to God all the glory goes back to God hallelujah so so we have to apply it to Elijah how could Elijah overcome how could Elijah uh not give up it was Grace how could Elijah call fire down from heaven it was Grace it was shown to him amen he didn't have the he didn't have the power to call it down like that verse in the previous chapter Elijah didn't go up to God and say God you come down here and you send fire now it was he didn't Ascend up to heaven and none of us can Ascend down and get the lord it's all given by Amazing Grace Hallelujah like brother R said if God ever gives you a healing you didn't work yourself into it it was given to you by Grace works his faith expr 1965 if you want the reference on that one I appreciate that brother cams in that uh no it was the Sunday morning service it was Easter morning I I took a little section of that might have been a two-hour sermon but I took a little section of that and and just showed all those quotes it's got to be revealed first he even healing is a gift right even healing is a gift of God but said you'll never work yourself into it in other words it's got to be part of the plan of God am now the and the only way to miss that is unbelief right right so the main thing to do is no matter what if we're seeking healing or financial restitution amen no matter what we're seeking it's confess confess God's going to do it hope hope and trust God will do it and if and and when God drops down and you know he's going to do it now that's a revelation praise God but hope in the Lord don't give up on God don't walk away as we saw on Sunday don't don't turn around and don't stagger amen right right don't walk away from it just stay right with it amen hope in the Lord the Bible says hallelujah hope until faith comes right Hallelujah hope until Faith Comes that's right because it's not by our works it's by Grace Grace is unmar favor it's by the favor of God I just always love that uh scripture from Psalms uh the way I know God favors me is because my enemies don't triumph over me remember David said that that's the way I know God favors me cuz I don't fall to my enemies amen they can try to discourage me try to curse me they can try to do all these things but I don't fall to them I don't suit to their level I don't walk away from God I just stay with the word of God hallelujah I'm not a perfect representation but I sure am on the Lord's Side hallelujah hallelujah praise God won't desert the faith because God didn't desert me on the cross Jesus didn't leave me on the cross Jesus Jesus didn't say well I actually want to get down no he he he bore the pain for me he went all the way for me I'll go all the way for him in my humble little expression of Love Hallelujah my humble expression of Faith I'll go all the way with Christ hallelujah amen now so see it's not by our works ultimately it won't be our works it'll be by grace verse 7 what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded okay Accord according as it is written God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day of course that's in Isaiah 29:10 but we're not going to read that and David said let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back always I say then have they stumbled that they should fall God forbid okay he's talking about the whole of Israel as isra stumbled that they'll fall and they'll never get back to God he said God forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy Hallelujah okay so they stumbled so we could have an opportunity with with Grace amen right now just you know all we can do is give thanks that's all we can do brother R always explains it like this if you listen to the seals and right even in uh I was listening to uh the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel because we just saw Daniel you I was like I want to listen to this by God's grace but brother always explained it like this he said we should be so humble because God blinded his own children that we could be saved that so think about your children think about our children think about blinding them and denying them of privileges so somebody else can have blessings that that's the simp simple way brother Ram explains the fact that we get Amazing Grace God blinded his own children what would you deprive your children you would deprive anything hardly right like we want them to have the best right but God in his love he says well they many of them have rejected me so I'm going to Blind them that have rejected me all the day long you know they they called him be elub you know they they they they they they uh they tried to kill him they tried to Stone him they tried to do all these things God protected him remember many times he walked they tried to throw him off a cliff they triy to tempt him with his words they try to to catch him in and catch him in his words and make him uh make mistakes and everything and the member of the Bible said all day long he held out his hands for them am Hallelujah but then when the the crucifixion they said let his blood be on us then what did Jesus do he blinded them they stumbled that we might accept God's grace Hallelujah so we thank God yes we thank God for Amazing Grace Hallelujah but see they're not going to fall they're not going to be down forever God's going to lift them up Hallelujah and you can see it you can see it uh it's the group I was on their website this week Temple Institute that's Israel's uh that's one of the the the conservative groups of Israel that's trying to get the temple rebuilt now of course they haven't succeeded because they need that location the Dome of the Rock right that Muslim shrines there but their hope and their dream their desire is to build the temple and then they know the Messiah will come to the temple and he will right he'll be right next to it the Bible said Jesus would be on the Mount of Olives there's two scriptures that say that Zechariah I think it's 14 and then uh Revelation 14 if I'm not mistaken I might be wrong with the Zechariah but I know Revelation 14 for sure he's going to stand right next there's a little Valley between Mount of Olives and Mount Zion where's he at there he is all these Bible names in here Malachi and all these things where quote quot all these scriptures nature and virtue and everything Hallelujah Lydia but right Jesus will stand right there on Mount Mount olives Hallelujah and there'll be a temple there Hallelujah and the 144,000 will look at Jesus and then they'll weep from house to house but then a fountain will be open it won't be a natural Fountain but a spiritual Fountain Hallelujah where they can come and enjoy the Waters of life like we enjoy right now amen how enjoy the Waters of Life hallelujah amen where sometimes God's mercy uh Haven it feels like it's just flowing out towards us right we just feel like waves of God's us you know waves of God's water just gushing out towards us hallelujah blessing after blessing hallelujah amen gift after gift Grace after Grace H it's it's a fountain that's open hallelujah amen forgiveness after forgiveness second chance after third chance and so many chances it's a fountain amen and you thank God you can't turn it off amen I don't want it off thank God it's it's constantly flowing until we go in the Rapture Hallelujah let it flow Hallelujah Let it Flow by God's grace I love it amen but one day God will open that Fountain to Israel praise God they're blinded right now they can't see it right now but one day they'll eyes open and they'll see a fountain in the House of David Hallelujah and the Bible say it's a spirit of Grace and supplication Spirit of Grace amen hallelujah Grace Grace unmar favor Hallelujah am and supplication is prayer right it's specific prayer that's what supplication is a David or Daniel made supplication to God for his people one to know the right time it's a specific prayer supplication and and Israel have the spirit of Grace favor and supplication specific prayer and the Bible said a nation will be born in one day all right yes little review here by God's grace now verse 12 now if the fall of them be the riches of the world a spiritual riches right and the diminishing of them The Riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness in other words if if the Gentiles have this great blessing how much more will Israel get a great blessing when God returns to them if we enjoy all this now what are they going to get hallelujah amen they're going to get a great blessing amen I just reading about it today you know there's so many scriptures that speak about this how Israel is going to be uh the house of the Lord the joy of the Lord the joy of the whole earth praise God Amen so many wonderful promises Millennial promises verse 13 for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am an apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office this answered I think n nature had a question about Paul being the uh the Paul being the pattern for for the uh believers and he is here here he magnifies his office as a Bible writer as an apostle Apostle means one sent Paul was sent to make churches to make converts praise God to set them in order he was sent even to prison sent to prison to write the Bible praise God hallelujah think about that and I heard I heard brother Donnie say thisday I was listening to brother Donnie this morning I heard brother Donnie say that you know imagine being in the first century church right and you're up there you're you're preaching and reading quotes qu from a man who's in prison Paul let's say we're like colossia or Ephesus and I got up here now let's let's I'm going to preach tonight and I'm going to unroll this letter we got from Paul and the people watching would say oh look there are cult you know look at this cult they're reading a they're not reading just the Torah now they're reading a message of a man who's in jail and he spent a lot of time in jail he just wasn't in and out once you know he was in there a lot and they say oh he's a cult they're a cult they just quote this Prophet all the time Prophet who's in jail I thought wow that really blew my mind like that really made it real for us right he's in jail you know he's not perfect he says he does things that he hates and one time uh he said something wrong and the high priest slapped him remember the high priest slapped him there he didn't know he was talking to the high priest and he got slapped because he made a mistake he reviled the Lord's high priest but you know just the reality of wow we're in a similar situation I'm reading quotes from a prophet right who gets mocked and made fun of and accused but what did that Prophet do he spoke with thus sayith the Lord amen now it's not a perfect parallel because you know brother R's sermon books are not all thus sayith the Lord right but there are Bible teachings in there there's a lot of Bible teaching and there's numerous thus say the Lords in here hallelujah and so you know it's just the similarity of you're quoting a man that uh wasn't perfect well who isn't right Muhammad wasn't perfect Buddha wasn't perfect of course but see when we're quing Jesus now we are quing a man that was perfect Hallelujah remember God sent Paul God sent John Wesley uh Martin Luther brother random Hallelujah and so we got to be careful Jesus is the only one right and are the Bible writers are the only ones those words are absolutely infallible Hallelujah so it takes a great balance by God's grace now verse 14 if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them so Paul wanted to stir up some of these blind Jews so somehow their blinders could come off isn't that something that's just that's really uh really shows the love of Paul Paul knew they were blind but he said I still want to try to provoke them and see can I save some of them Hallelujah the church if you ever feel like you know your friends or family blind don't give up on them keep trying to provoke them not in a good way I'm talking a good way I'm not I'm not talking a sinful way in a good way just testify them tell them the good things God has done for you praise God he says verse 15 for if the casting of them away of them be the reconciling of the world which shall the receiving of them I'm sorry what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead there's the dry bones coming back to life right they were cast away but God's going to bring them back it's like being from dead to Alive praise God have you seen those Jews ever do their dances they can really shout have you ever seen them pray at the Wailing Wall and dance at the Wailing Wall it's really intense it's really heartfelt so what is it going to be like when they get the Holy Ghost if they're having that much joy and that much Victory if they're having that much time with God what's it going to be like when they're born again it's going to be just like Acts chapter 2 hallelujah amen it'll be noise abroad even more praise God 144,000 of them that's quite a Revival hallelujah it's going to be like life from the dead like that song You Brought me Back to Life Hallelujah verse 16 for if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy if the root be holy so are the branches and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree so we're in God's eyes a wild olive tree right we our our Gentiles were wild in other words we didn't have the law of God right we the Angels didn't visit us they visited the Jews right we saw that in Colossians right Israel had all the Oracles of God right they had all the promises of God we were not I'm sorry we were far off from the blood of Jesus Christ but now the blood has brought us close to God hallelujah so see we're close to God now and the Bible says the word must be nigh us even in our lips praise God so now that we're close to the blood now the word has got to be in our mouth Hallelujah all right thank the Lord now so God looks at at us we used to be a wild Olive Branch but W grafted in among them and with them partak us of the root and fatness of the Olive Tree so we're like just like the Candlestick we're drawing on the same life that Israel Drew on amen hallelujah praise God the fatness of it the richness of it hallelujah we're drawing on the grace of God the power of God hallelujah Verse 18 boast not against the branches so here's where we don't want to we don't want to be prideful and exalt ourselves like we're so much better than Israel right that's what the Bible says here but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee thou will say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in that's that's true remember they stumbled so you could you could receive it right and now we get the other illustration one illustration is stumbling they fell so we could we could win the race right here's another one though they were cut off that we might be grafted in so there's a couple illustrations he gives well because of unbelief they were broken off see God gave them uh 1500 years of the law Moses received the law they had, 1500 years now look we we at this point we have 500 more years in Israel we've we've had God's grace 500 more years Hallelujah the presence of God the testimonies of God the supernatural things of God the word of God hallelujah the fresh Revelation we've had 500 additional years than Israel got talk about Grace amen talk about favor hallelujah it's been given to the Gentiles okay they were broken off that you might be grafted in verse 20 because of unbelief that they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high- minded but fear of course this doesn't mean the uh the the sinful fear it means honor give God honor uh yesterday at bible Club at the middle school they asked one of the kids what is fear mean what does fear of God mean and they couldn't answer right and so we tried to give them illustrations uh you know and it's kind of like uh it's kind of like on Narnia where the lion right asan he's real kind but he's also real powerful right so it's like you got to got to have that respect it's kind of like a actual actually like a real animal in real life right brother Austin kind of like with dogs right if it's a real strong dog right you gotta you got to be real you got to be happy about it but you got to be real careful not to make it mad Hallelujah right you got to have that respect right it's kind of like even uh owning a firearm right there's power in there so you got to respect that you got to respect that that that that gun right you just can't just throw it around you can't just drop it all around can't just leave bullets in it you know and safety's off you know you can't you can't can't do that right you got to respect the power That's What God Says church we got to respect God's power Hallelujah so be not high minded so don't be prideful right that's one thing I I've said it before we battle most as as the the message Believers we battle Pride the most because we know more but that shouldn't make us prideful that should make us more humble humble right because we're now accountable for all that we know right it just makes us more accountable verse 21 so here's why he tells us to honor God for if God spare not the natural branches take he lest he also spare thee not so always keep that in mind God can get rid of us whenever he wants now we're we're trusting by Grace right we're we're trusting in the grace of God but Paul's talking about having a prideful attitude right so if we remain humble then God will bless us but if people get prideful God can cut them off if they get prideful right like that good example we saw was Nebuchadnezzar he got so prideful I built this Kingdom I built these Hanging Gardens these wonders of the world and Daniel said because you didn't see that was God now you're going to be a beast for seven years right and you're going to live amongst the animals and the Dew of heaven will be all over you and you'll look like an animal with the claws and the beard and everything God humbled him right because he thought this was all because of me so see Church no matter what we build on this Earth we got to remember wasn't because we're special it's because God gave us Grace hallelujah amen if any if anything good comes out of your life it was God's grace like a lot of people say uh well I just I just I just caught like if there a business person they'll say I just caught it at the right time I invested at Amazon at the right time it was my great decision no you were just it was just ordained for you to do it right it was just ordained and now what are you going to do with that benefit that's what God's going to hold you accountable for Hallelujah right we all wish we could have lived there you know right before Amazon we could invested in Amazon and our stocks would be so high but it was ordained for some people other people weren't ordained to Hallelujah now he says verse 20 two behold therefore the goodness and severity of God so that there there it is that responsibility right that that that respect that fear for God the honor for God God is good but he also can be very severe right a Lon can be very beautiful and soft but can also be very Fierce right on them which fell severity so Israel but toward thee goodness if if thou there's that if there's that conditional promise right it's unconditional in God's sight because he knows who's predestinated to accept it but for us we got to act like well we know it's conditional right so we know we know there's uh there's uh consequences to our decisions Hallelujah there's the if if you continue in his goodness otherwise Thou shalt be cut off so he's talking to the Gentiles the Gentiles will be cut off because they won't continue in God's goodness now anybody with an honest heart anybody here of course sees it plainly but but anybody can see most churches have not gone in the goodness of God because of things they allow like abortion right and transgender and homosexuality right and adulteries right you know it just you name the sins we can see plainly but very few people in churches can see that they're not continuing in the goodness of God right God gives you Grace so then you can serve him uh respectfully the Bible says in Godly fear all the days of your life praise God but then people mistreat Grace they they do despite the spirit of Grace as Hebrew says and so the severity of God will fall on them okay in other words brother man says Grace if you you mistreat it it becomes disgrace it's a disgrace to have a woman married woman in a church disgrace it's absolute Abomination right but they they they can't see it they're blinded by their own sin but don't forget the goodness and the severity of God hallelujah and if you continue in the goodness of God remember the goodness of God leads you to what repentance Amen in other words if you continue repenting amen and following God's will he will bless you Hallelujah he'll bless us we got to continue in that constant repentance and loving God blessing God praising God Amen verse 23 and and they also if they by not still in unbelief shall be grafted in for God is able to graft them in again that's something God can cut off a a branch and then God can keep it alive just like that Rod that budded in in the holiest of holies hallelujah praise God no doubt that Rod was dead and old and it and and in the natural Lydia would know in the natural that branch is so old you couldn't graft it in it's been too long but nothing is too hard for God Amen amen amen hallelujah Let It Be an encouragement just like Abraham and Sarah they were so far you know being able to procreate and have children but nothing is too hard for God hallelujah he can grab them back in he can bring life back into their bodies and they can bring forth an Isaac hallelujah amen glory now he says verse 24 for if thou W cut out of the Olive Tree which is wild by nature and were grafted contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own Olive Tree so other words the tree didn't match our nature as Gentiles Gentiles were not Gentiles were not holy people right just look just look at the opposite of Israel right look at the amorites the the Philistines you know look at all their look at all their idolatry and if you didn't know I just put a a video out today about I just had a few extra minutes I put out a video about gluttony brother Ram said the sin of gluttony is repeating today right because uh the Bible said they were eating and drinking right giving in marriage and marrying Hallelujah that's one Idol people have like I told you we had three preachers tell us that that's the idol they struggle with well I trust God will help them by God's grace the first step is recognizing you got a problem that's the first step Hallelujah whatever sin it is right don't hide your sin confess your sin to God Hallelujah that's right now so we we were grafted into a holy tree but Gentiles were not Holy Verse 25 here's where we really get down to the the final uh final part of the the chapter here the the real I think this is the most important scripture right here for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery this is a mystery I've been preaching a mystery this whole chapter anybody realize that it's a mystery this whole chapter is a mystery Israel's blindness right hold chapter two in my book I already preached it to you three years ago um lest you should be wise in your own conceits okay so don't be don't be ignorant uh try to make yourself wise blindness is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in okay so God is going to keep Israel blind until the last Gentile gets the holy ghost or gets saved amen right wise and foolish right so that's how we know and remember the Bible said uh the Bible said the time must be shortened so that somebody's even saved so think about when chrisan think about when you and I came in the message you know there was lots of people being baptized well now there's less and less and less I heard I heard a story from brother Donnie years ago he said he used to go to Africa and they would have you know tent meetings and revivals they'd sometimes baptize hundreds of people he said the last time he went back they baptized five and they've got thousands maybe 5 10 thousand people so each even everybody can see we're dwindling down we're getting to the final people being saved by God's grace now we don't know the last one right we don't know but thank God people are being saved hallelujah amen amen let's not remember again don't be prideful right we can't be prideful we got to continue in God's grace Hallelujah continue in God's goodness God's been good to me praise God I'm going to keep his commands Hallelujah this this is a gift to be saved this is a gift to have the message of the hour this is a blessing to have the Revelation that we have hallelujah amen now verse 26 and so all Israel shall be saved as is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob of course that's speaking of Christ when Christ returns now he means all Israel all the elect right and we know that number 144,000 okay so that's what he's talking about he's talking about all the elect that want to believe that election the called out group that will trust in God now verse 27 for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes so see most most Jews that are sinners are enemies right they're enemies of the Cross but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake and then we just see that wasn't on The Daily wire wasn't there a Jew and a Christian what and they fired the Christian if I'm not mistaken remember that see they're enemies I think the Christian said Christ is King and then the Jew fired the Christian if I'm not mistaken something related to religion that's at least what the the rumor was by God's grace but they're enemies right I mean think about it it's offensive to anybody if I said there's only one way to eternal life what if you're talking to a Muslim what if you're talking to a Jew that's well am I going to hell then am I going to hell then you see how it's it's offensive but Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life no man comes into the father but by me Hallelujah now the Jews are different they can be blinded because they still got a covenant with God Muslims don't right that's why it's really that's why Jesus has has to appear to some of the Muslims to save th the elected ones Hallelujah now verse 28 as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes he says but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes amen so these 144,000 are beloved unto God in other words God loves how they're trying to get that red heer ready to sacrifice now we don't know they're saying they might sacrifice it on April 22nd that's only what 12 days away my and that's an anticipation of a re Temple and the Messiah coming back think about that my goodness look at and remember they got all the they got all the garments for the high priest the priests the Levites they uh I saw it too they they have all the uh uh all the instruments you know to to kill the the bulock to to to collect the blood and sprinkle the blood they have all the instruments they've spent decades getting this ready they got all the colors from all the animals where the Bible says you got to get the the purple from these these sea creatures you got to get the purple and red from these sea creatures they went and did that and God looks down and said they're my beloved Hallelujah in other words they they'll honor my word they want to keep the word of God they want to be grafted back into the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen and here we sit we we're grafted into the Holy Spirit God help us to take advantage of the grace that's given to us amen that's what we are doing tonight Hallelujah we are grafted into it by the grace of God now verse 29 for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance we use this many times just for gifts in people's life but it it certainly applies to the Jews and the Gentiles right in other words God has given us the gift of Grace right now the Gentile dispensation and that's without repentance God ain't going to change that that was God's Great purpose right he gave Israel 1500 years they stumbled at it so he blinds them he said I'll give these people a chance and he said I'm calling them my beloved amen hey this is my beloved we read it in chapter nine remember Romans nine from Hosea I'm going to call the people beloved that were not beloved I'm going to call a group my people which were not my people we are God's people and we're God's beloved hallelujah amen no matter what happens in our lives amen amen like I was even praying today while I was singing I was like oh my and I I've said this before if God doesn't do one more great thing for me he's still done so much for me that I'd still serve him and praise Him Hallelujah he's still worthy he's still worthy of it all Hallelujah because he's been good to me he's been so gracious merciful the gifts and calling of God are without repentance God will not take it back verse 30 for as ye in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they shall obtain Mercy Hallelujah so Israel didn't believe so we could believe but then the Gentiles are going to not believe at the end talking about the Sinners so that the Jews can then believe again in other words God gives God gave all the Jews a chance to accept Christ and now God's given all the Gentiles a chance to accept Christ then he's going back to the Jews that's Grace that's Grace right there Hallelujah giving everybody a chance to hear this message remember Jesus said Matthew 25 14 let me read that fresh to your hearts this is the only explanation I believe is Mak sense of why the Rapture hasn't happened you might have your thought you know this is just my humble thought here and this Gospel of the Kingdom must or shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then the end shall come why hasn't the Rapture happened because not every nation has heard the message of Jesus Christ I'm talking about this message the water baptism the Holy Ghost right they got to have a chance to hear it didn't Jesus have to send his two his disciples two by two to each one of those cities right didn't he have to do that yes they all deserved a chance to hear remember Simon said he think they found the first message believer in Thailand the first not not the H hundredth the first doesn't that Nation don't those millions of people deserve a chance to hear the message absolutely absolutely right so God's going to be gracious God's going to be merciful don't get PR we can't get prideful we got to stay humble and keep trying to give people a chance to hear the gospel now it's easy for us now because we got internet praise God but for the preachers that need to go we need to help them praise God so I'm going to keep my ears open next time Simon wants to go or somebody else wants to go we got to try to support them a little bit that we can Hallelujah we've done that over the years like we helped Ben NAD last time he went um some other people too I can't think of them right now it's been a while remember because the co kind of shut things down for a while we've helped send preachers to take the gospel Hallelujah even if they're doing just Evangelical work they can still win Souls praise God now thank you for your patience here almost done by God's grace all right verse 32 for God hath concluded them all in unbelief that me he might have mercy upon all praise God God Hallelujah in other words God the Bible says remember earlier in Romans chapter 323 for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God hallelujah other words God knows everybody's going to sin so God has to have mercy on everybody praise God and thank God he prayed for he paid for that on the cross Hallelujah he paid for the sins of the whole world Hallelujah on the cross because all were in unbelief Hallelujah so he had to have mercy on all of us verse 30 33 oh now here's how Paul responds Paul imagine Paul writing this and he gets to the end of the chapter he's like oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God have you ever left a sermon or a song special and thought oh my that was so wonderful what a deep Revelation from God we've had some anybody had some lately walked out how many when brother digs here walked out here like wow that was so refreshing oh God's grace and mercy he told me he said brother Jesse I didn't get any of that from my notes that was all you guys pulling on me he said I could not have studied for that he said you guys pulled that out of me he said your church is says more amens than a church that's a mega church he preaches at mega church he says he he got more amens out of our church than mega churches in the message Hallelujah now don't get don't don't get prideful now fear God remember fear God respect God honor God but here Paul finishes as he writes the mystery wow this one stumbled so this one could go on this one was caught off so this one could be put in and then Paul says oh the depths of the goodness of graciousness of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out who would have thought God would have let this people he would have let the gospel come for let the law come for 1500 years until the very last person would believe and then because they rejected Christ then you know in other words he would he would get a bride for for Christ and then when they would reject him he would get a bride from the Gentiles Hallelujah and then go back and get what the Bible calls uh Unix the Bible calls 144,000 Unix not the bride but Unix he had a he gave Israel a chance to be bride but because they rejected it he gets a bride amen and then after that after he gets his bride then he gets some Unix for heaven hallelujah praise God oh my that's powerful he said oh The Depths and the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God for who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath been his counselor right like uh brother raham always talked about this brother raham said if I was God he said and I sent my word to somebody in the book and they didn't believe it brother M said if I was God I'd probably be done with them he said but God is more gracious than humans are like if you send a letter to somebody and said hey would you repent and get baptized and they threw it in the trash what would you do you'd probably like okay I'm done I wash my hands with that I'm done but brother Adam said but God goes beyond that if they won't receive the written word he said then it'll send them angels and then brother said if they won't receive the Angels then I'll send my gifts my nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and then he said if they won't receive that I'll send them five preaching gifts Amen brother R was saying God Is So merciful god goes to extra lengths oh The Depths and the riches of the knowledge of God hallelujah amen think about how God is gracious in this hour God sent us William brandham with thus sayith the Lord and discernment gifts to tell people the thoughts and intents of their heart and point us back to the Bible we should be so grateful oh The Depths and Riches of God to us hallelujah we could be in denominations or the we could be in the Catholic Church worshiping a wafer but here we are worshiping God Almighty hallelujah amen The Depths and Riches of God hallelujah and each time it was God Grace coming to us we didn't go looking for it God came looking for us hallelujah amen undeserving Hallelujah he had mercy on all of us praise God The Depths and the riches and the wisdom of God who's known the mind of God or who have been his counselor a lot of people thought the mind of God was the Rapture was going to take place on Monday at the eclipse you what they're saying now is well now we got 40 days I think it's May 19th they got 40 days from the eclipse America can still repent well I'm sorry if you missed it on that one you're probably going to miss it on this one too right you know I'm glad I preached that beforehand Hallelujah by God's grace because it just again proves we got to look to the scripture for all of our answers look to every scripture for the answers like the one thing they were saying the there was you know when when that uh when that eclip Eclipse came in 2017 there was there was seven cities that were Salem uh and that means Jerusalem which means peace and so that means uh God was offering peace to us seven times to America what does that mean what what does that mean and then you know this time in 2024 there was Seven Cities supposedly um that were called Nineveh and now God's offering us repentance and mercy what does that mean what do you mean we who accepted God's peace or did we accept God's peace or not in 2017 did we or not it just got worse since 2017 right and then now uh you know Nineveh who and what did they do in Nineveh Church they fasted they ripped their clothes and they got in ashes where has one American done that yet they haven't they just go about their regular lives that doesn't make any sense it wasn't in the Bible praise God now we we had we we could have been so sure because brother Ram said it's thus sayith the Lord America already had her last chance in 56 50 years after the isusa Street Revival in 1906 50 years Jubilee she already had her chance right that's how sure we can be by God's grace hallelujah what a blessing that we can be sure oh who can know the mind of the Lord who ha been God's C well God you should have done this and you you know here's how you should do it no no no let's let God do it praise God let's let God do it however he wants to do it verse 35 or who hath first given to him and it shall not be recompensed unto him again right who is who's somebody that first gave God something nobody God gave us life amen and then we can take the other side the Bible said when you give to God you lend to the Lord who is God not repay paid back who's God not paid back anybody paid a tie or offering or Special Love offering and God didn't pay you back I'll just say like this week I've I've lost very little compared to what God's given me by Grace Just gifts just gifts God has been so gracious I mean by looking over the course of these last few years I mean God is just he he's a way more giver than we are Hallelujah of course of course he is he's Eternal he's perfect amen he's way more gracious and then the Bible said in Psalms he's not punished us after all of our sins either amen he's blessed us beyond what we deserve and punished us less than what we deserve that's amazing grace that's favor that's an unmar favor from God who's given to God where God doesn't give it back to him oh yeah I just read Malachi 2 today God said return unto me and I'll return unto you and they said how do we return He said in your tithes and offerings youve Rob God now that doesn't impact us but look I'm talking about the nation look at the nation these preachers will get up there and and they'll blast like tithing like it's some sin I mean if you're against tithing just be happy the person's given 10% Like how much do you give they probably don't even give him 2% you know like why why black that now you should blast it when people say it makes you righteous because you don't have any righteousness of your own we just read that in the Bible right in Romans your our righteousness comes from Christ amen right but it's this idea of just being generous because God loves a cheerful Giver Hallelujah ah verse 36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen so of God is all things everything we get is from God through God is All Things praise God and to God are all things of from to so what wherever the wherever the blessing is going whether it's coming to you or whether it's going out from you it's all going back to God it's God's giving it all out and it's all coming back to him in other words he sees all your your sacrif he's going to give it right back praise God hallelujah now in closing said all that now in my book there I just want to close with this because I forgot this thought I was looking through here right before service there's six evidences in there that even blinded Jews can be saved okay one of them is Paul's teaching in this chapter Paul said blinded is israels Israelis are not forsaken for all time they're not forsaken um spiritual blindness is only temporary it's not permanent because God will graft them in again and it's and that blindness is only on part of Israel now it's the majority but there's a small minority that is called The Remnant so God didn't blind all Israel most of it but not all he still got a believing remant today Hallelujah so that's the first proof the second proof is Jesus's prayer on the cross he said father forgive them they don't know what they were doing so people can blaspheme like Paul people can blaspheme Jesus and they didn't even know what they were doing and Jesus will forgive them Hallelujah the third one just real quick foreshadowing in the life of Jesus I'm sorry life of Joseph Joseph forgave his brothers did they deserve it no they they were blinded to what God was doing amen hallelujah they were blinded it was God was LE God was allowing them to throw Joseph in the pit and take him off to Egypt to save life Hallelujah God blinded the Jews so he could save our lives amen but God's going to graft them back in at the end hallelujah amen where did I get these wounds from the house of my friends but I still love you let me give you a change of garment let me give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah let me give you 100 44,000 the Holy Ghost I'll change your garments amen like William gives us all these clothes from Ghana he gives these and so does beatric and they give us all these clothes a change of clothing a baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God the fifth one is the fifth seal the fifth seal proves Hallelujah the fifth seal proves God Saves blinded Israel now this was a just an interesting fresh thought that came to me off was prepared you know we talk about church after we die we won't have to pray anymore right we won't have to pray that's because we got the Holy Ghost but did you catch that in the fifth seal the blinded Jews were crying out to God they were still interceding for God think about that they cried out in life and they cry out in death think about that they they're still praying they're still praying now the Jews that were mared in the Hol of brother said every Jew that was killed since the time of Jesus is under the altar saying Lord how long holy and true Dost thou not judge our righteous blood they're still praying even in heaven amazing and does God ignore them no Jesus answers back and said wait a little season the rest of your brethren must be martyred as well and then you'll get brand new bodies Hallelujah then you'll get new white robes by the grace of God they're praying in heaven and they're in heaven Hallelujah but for us when we die we won't be praying in heaven we'll be praising in heaven hallelujah praise God hallelujah remember the 24 Elders they sing the songs right and they they sing songs that say thank God he's redeemed Us by his blood out of every Kindred T tribe nation and tongue hallelujah thank God he grafted us into the holy tree praise God oh my just interesting thought there blinded Jews are still praying now their prayers don't end and lastly um no I'm sorry fifth God's righteous judgment based upon your knowledge so the Bible is clear God judges everyone based upon what they knew right so God will judge a blinded group based upon what they saw what they saw spiritually they can't see spiritually there's my hour but God God will only judge someone based upon what they knew not what they didn't know right and that goes for every person that's right because the Bible said the word of God remember in Romans 1 and2 Romans 1 and two we're judged there's no excuse on the day of judgment because the the law of God is written in every heart and in other words every every person knows right from wrong and they'll be judged by what they know all right and then the last one was God's covenant with Israel through Abraham that Covenant still stands Hallelujah remember there's remember there's eight covenants and each Covenant stays intact remember that uh let me try to see if I can name them I I don't know if I can name them right now but edenic Covenant the adamic Covenant the noic Covenant Noah abrahamic Covenant the Mosaic Covenant Glory I'm feeling good now the davidic Covenant Hallelujah the New Covenant and then the Eternal Covenant I got them all amen wow hallelujah praise God I didn't expect that amen I guess if you write it though you might remember it spend out that time writing but notice we're in other words we're still enjoying the benefits of Noah's Covenant amen God's never going to flood the Earth again Glory praise God right we're still enjoy we're still enjoying the Covenant of Abraham because we're blessed all those who bless us are blessed Hallelujah and no man can curse us hallelujah though they can steal from us they can't curse us hallelujah you know why I'm preaching that they can steal from you but they can't curse you Hallelujah I I have a feeling God will God will uh make them answer Hallelujah either in this life or the next because what you did to the least of these my brethren you did it unto me and that's in the negative sense but God blesses it in the natural sense but see we're still we're still benefiting from the no noic Covenant and the div I'm sorry and the uh uh abrahamic Covenant well that means if Israel turned down the New Covenant which was writing it on the fleshly tables of our hearts that means they are still going to be judged by the Mosaic Covenant and the davidic Covenant David's Covenant does everybody catch that by God's grace so there's six proof I'm sorry there's six proofs right there that they can still be saved even though they're blinded how many know that God doesn't leave himself without a witness couple more verses here I know got to go a little bit longer here but just a little bit um this this this came to me while I was studying there Hebrews 13 12 I'm sorry Hebrews 3:12 sorry Hebrews 3 Trace Hebrews 3:12 chapter 3 take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief what did we just read the Gentiles will keep the goodness of God unless they have an evil heart of unbelief right in departing from the Living God see that that should be our desire we should have in our hearts I'm never going to leave the truth I will always serve God I've just got to endure my test and trials amen I just got to make it through Hallelujah I just got to crush this wave and wait till until this wave crosses over Hallelujah I just have to make it through this Valley of the shadow of death I know another Mountaintop is coming hallelujah praise God next verse verse 13 take heed uh now 13 but exhort one another now that means encourage encourage one another daily now this is what I was thinking maybe trying to send like a daily I don't know if I can keep this up but the Bible said we should encourage each other every single day right now of course they didn't have cell phones in those days right so it meant they would encourage themselves every day that they saw each other or their families would encourage each other their you know the Believers that were with them in other words we don't want to spend our days discouraging each other's Faith every time we see each other we want to encourage them right exhort one another daily while it's called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin now we get a good we get a good lesson in here if we encourage people they're going to say off for God right but if we're uh if we don't if we discourage them they're going to get hard on God see that that's why we got to be so kind and anytime you see now we don't want to overlook sin but any time we see something good and positive we want to encourage somebody like that Mal I really enjoyed that plane today boy that was awesome and it's his mind he might be saying well I missed that note and I missed that note and I heard that and I heard that but man it was so wonderful you did a great job I so proud I love that song I I love how you did that right find something to encourage somebody about encourage them because there's a lot of discouragement in the world right no wonder brother Bram said every time I go and feel a little blue I go turn to Romans chapter 4 19 and 20 Abraham was strong in faith he didn't stagger at the promise of God he gave God Glory Hallelujah I don't stagger at the promise of God I don't forsake God I don't abandon God I keep giving God praise hallelujah amen so see there's a great testimony there a great lesson right there church let's keep encouraging one another in the word of God let's be kind to each other let's called this also means to strengthen people hallelujah verse 14 for we are made partakers of Christ if there's that conditional part right our our human part if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end so think about how think about how confident we're when you got saved or you got the holy ghost or you had a a refilling of the Holy Ghost in your human Spirit think about how confident you are you've got to keep that confidence amen what's it what and what's the secret to that daily encouragement amen find something that will encourage you in God every single day Hallelujah Glory find something whether it's you know our podcast or uh they have they have podcast where they just play brother Braham sermons or another church has podcast where they play their church music or something like find something to encourage you every single day praise God and when you're with the Believers encourage them as well by God's grace isn't that amazing of all the things Paul could have said Paul said encourage one another every single day Glory I'm work I'm working my way up I might actually have if you count all my videos I made and then all the podcasts if you come I might have 365 maybe once I get 365 I'll share one a day with everybody on the text that way I can try to encourage everybody daily you know some Churches have like uh they have like a pastor email every morning the pastor you know get sent out at at 5:00 am every morning the pastor just does a little bible study and teaches them a few things about God and it just comes right to their their inbox now if somebody wants to help me with that I'll I'll do the teaching if you can do the videos and the emails if you want a daily pastor Pastor email of encouragement of the day I just need some help by God's grace I got enough videos I could do it by by by now Hallelujah but look what it says this is so important to encourage each other every single day by God's grace when we see each other right for us acts 16 verse4 and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained to the apostles and Elders which were at Jerusalem and so the churches were established in the the faith and increase in number daily the word established means to strengthen wow so if somebody brings you the word of God to obey that's going to strengthen you yes right I can't you know some sometimes I go back and listen to sermons I preach I can't even believe I preach that sermon I'm like who is that man up there preaching he's so zealous he's quoting scriptures and I'm like I'm forgetting all these scriptures like who is that man up there right but this just goes to show God gives you the word that you need in that hour hour and whatever you hear in that hour you got to receive it and find a way to have it encourage you praise God hallelujah you have to because we can't remember everything right we the B God said God will stir us up by way of remembrance right but each day just like Paul they had they did the apostolic uh circuit right or the Evangelical e evangelist circuit they had to go from church to church to encourage the Saints and I'm here to encourage you tonight praise God Amen as someone that battled anger all week I'm here encourage you to be joyful today Hallelujah cuz we all got a battle to fight Hallelujah acts 18:23 last verse let's stand to our our feet Malachi can come to the piano play goodness of God here by God's grace wouldn't that be good how many enjoying God's goodness we don't get the severity of God we get the goodness of God Israel at the time they rejected Jesus on the cross they got severity they got at the Holocaust severity severe chastisement but we get the goodness of God hallelujah that's why I don't believe we're going to be hunted down for the you I necessarily don't believe we'll be hunted down for the Rapture or have to just to me it seems like God would be gracious to us that's that's what I'm leaning for I'm hoping for by God's grace everybody understand I'm not prophesying but if we you know if we get the goodness of God then I would expect God to be gracious to us hallelujah but even if we get severity even if there's a test or persec we won't get severity even if we get tested or tried very hard then we can say like job the Lord
