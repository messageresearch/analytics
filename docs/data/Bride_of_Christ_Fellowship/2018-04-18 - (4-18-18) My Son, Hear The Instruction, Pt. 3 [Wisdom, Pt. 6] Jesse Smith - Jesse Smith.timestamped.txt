[44:52] Lord God I pray you'd speak to every
[44:54] heart Lord Jesus may every heart humble

[44:59] what the Spirit is saying tonight Lord
[45:01] God we know every gathering Lord with
[45:03] you as an appointed gathering Lord God
[45:05] you knew this service would take place
[45:07] before the foundation of the world so
[45:09] speak to us here tonight Lord we need to
[45:11] hear from you we need strength we
[45:13] life we need hope we need wisdom we need
[45:16] your word Lord God we need your spirit
[45:18] help us now in Jesus Christ's name and
[45:21] the church said Amen god bless yours
[45:23] being seated praise the Lord so we like
[45:30] to look at this is part three of my son
[45:33] here the instruction I think will may be
[45:34] finished tonight by God's grace like I
[45:37] said there was 23 verses where Solomon
[45:40] addressed my son so we want to look at
[45:42] that tonight by the grace of Lord part
[45:44] six over all of our series now part one
[45:46] remember he told his son to do these
[45:48] things to hear obey cry out seek the
[45:53] fear of the Lord accept God's correction
[45:56] and he told him to avoid evil company
[45:59] violent greedy friends and strange women
[46:03] and the rewards would be eternal life
[46:05] longer life favor Phil Barnes
[46:08] pleasantness peace deliverance from evil
[46:11] men and women health good doctrine and
[46:14] Happiness praise God now last week we
[46:16] saw this for part two last week he told
[46:19] his son to keep or guard his heart
[46:22] in other words imprison your heart don't
[46:25] let your heart your emotions leave
[46:27] Christ Prison we'd say Christ place for
[46:30] you and then he told his sons ponder
[46:32] your path they might do that this week
[46:35] sit down and think about your life and
[46:36] what direction it's going hopefully you
[46:38] did I know I did many times and just
[46:40] pray and think and reading the Word of
[46:42] God ponder your path and then he told
[46:46] his son keep wise words before your eyes
[46:49] constantly read the wisdom of the Holy
[46:52] Spirit he told his son keep your word or
[46:56] your pledge don't break any promises
[46:58] humble yourself if you say something
[47:00] don't avoid it he told him keep it
[47:04] humble yourself and go keep your pledge
[47:06] keep your friends he said don't even go
[47:09] to sleep before you make your word come
[47:13] to pass in other words make sure you
[47:16] keep your word and then he said avoid
[47:18] estranged women he gave him a second
[47:21] third and fourth warning to his son to
[47:23] avoid strange women
[47:26] then also we learned we must avoid
[47:28] compromising situations like flattering
[47:31] words when we know a sinner or someone
[47:33] who's got a questionable character is
[47:35] just praising us and you know we know
[47:37] they don't live the word all the way
[47:39] they make compromises we've got to avoid
[47:43] any flattering lips because Satan's are
[47:46] slick talker and we must not be alone at
[47:49] night because member of Salman said I
[47:51] looked out my window and I saw this
[47:52] young man coming down at nighttime and
[47:54] he got caught by the harlot so we saw
[47:57] that last week he again tells his son
[47:59] all these words of wisdom how many
[48:01] grateful for the wisdom of the Holy
[48:02] Spirit amen
[48:05] now so part three let's look at this
[48:08] here let's take your Bibles let's go to
[48:09] chapter eight if we can proverbs chapter
[48:11] eight proverbs chapter eight I'd like to
[48:21] look at verse 32 this is the fourth and
[48:23] final time that Solomon addresses the
[48:25] children so many times 23 times he says
[48:29] my son four times he says he children or
[48:31] my children and this is the fourth and
[48:33] final time he addresses the children so
[48:35] it's just it's really interesting and
[48:37] it's really neat 'fl that we look and
[48:38] see what did the Holy Spirit tell him
[48:41] the wisest man ever outside of Christ to
[48:44] tell his children because we need to
[48:45] know it today by the grace of the Lord
[48:48] 8:32 8:32 now if you recall at the
[48:54] beginning of this series part 1 I
[48:56] finished the sermon in chapter 8 I don't
[49:00] know if you remember that or not
[49:00] probably not but that's ok yeah and I
[49:03] was showing where brother Branham was
[49:05] talking about how Christ was the logos
[49:08] before of the foundation of the world
[49:09] and he said that little light was like a
[49:12] little child playing in front of its
[49:14] father remember that and that was in
[49:17] chapter 8 verses 22 to 31 he said I can
[49:20] see the logos now playing before his
[49:23] father and the father proud of his son
[49:25] the logos that little eternal light you
[49:29] know dancing and jumping and playing and
[49:32] just having fun we'd say or just
[49:34] enjoying life in front of the Eternal
[49:37] Spirit Father and that's
[49:39] Chapter eight now he gets gets done
[49:42] laying this down in verses 22 to 31 and
[49:46] then in verse 32 now he dresses the
[49:50] children and he says in verse 32 now
[49:53] therefore hearken unto me o ye children
[49:56] for blessed are they that keep my ways
[50:00] so God was showing through Solomon
[50:03] Christ's wisdom Christ in His wisdom was
[50:06] there before the foundation of the world
[50:08] it was alive
[50:10] its origin is at God with God is God is
[50:14] the manifestation of God
[50:16] and he says children then because you
[50:19] know this because wisdom is God he said
[50:22] keep my words keep my ways and he says
[50:25] for blessed are they that keep my ways
[50:28] amen here instruction and be wise and
[50:33] refuse it not how many remember when you
[50:36] were a sinner and you would just keep
[50:38] refusing the words of your mother and
[50:39] father I don't remember that
[50:41] or you refuse the words of a preacher
[50:43] you just refuse him you know it and the
[50:46] longer you dinner the easier got right
[50:49] because you start becoming calots the
[50:52] Bible said you become calloused to to
[50:55] the Holy Spirit and the Prophet tells us
[50:57] you know the the longer you tell that
[50:59] spirit know though the more faint it
[51:01] grows and the harder it is to hear the
[51:04] voice of the Holy Spirit
[51:06] I hope our ears are open to the Holy
[51:08] Spirit unyte amen that we came here to
[51:10] hear we didn't come here to criticize we
[51:13] came to hear and say lord help me to
[51:15] become a better Christian tonight give
[51:18] us ears to hear Lord but we used to
[51:22] refuse it you know in children you know
[51:24] we see I see it all the time I work with
[51:26] children but I see many times they're
[51:28] trying to refuse what I'm asking them to
[51:30] do they don't want to do what I tell
[51:32] them to do and they'll sit there and now
[51:34] wait one or two or three or four seconds
[51:36] and I'll ask them again and then I'll
[51:38] wait another three there they're trying
[51:40] to refuse it and that's what we we were
[51:43] battling ourselves as an even as adults
[51:45] don't we there's times God shows us the
[51:48] Word of God but we refuse it we turn it
[51:52] down we say not now we couldn't do
[51:53] now couldn't happen now but how God
[51:56] wants us to accept it and obey it right
[51:59] now praise God
[52:00] how he wants us to find today as the day
[52:03] of the deliverance praise God he wants
[52:06] us to receive the word today not to
[52:09] refuse it but to accept it
[52:11] I like verse 34 blessed is the man that
[52:14] heareth me watching daily at my gates
[52:18] waiting at the posts of my doors amen so
[52:23] now solomon likens wisdom to a city a
[52:27] sin as you know in the old days they had
[52:29] gates and at nighttime they would close
[52:31] the gates nobody got out nobody got in
[52:33] right early in the morning at some point
[52:36] if they knew there was no danger and the
[52:37] watchman was watching on the watchtower
[52:39] they'd opened the gates and they'd start
[52:41] business they'd have the court right
[52:43] there at the gates they'd have
[52:44] interaction and trade and commerce right
[52:47] there at the gates and now the wisdom of
[52:50] God the Holy Spirit is saying blessed
[52:52] are they who watch daily at my gates
[52:56] blessed are those who are constantly
[52:59] waiting from the voice of the Holy
[53:01] Spirit amen
[53:03] blessed of those who are waiting to grow
[53:05] an understanding of the word of God and
[53:10] blessed are they who wait at the posts
[53:13] of my doors it's kinda like this now in
[53:16] America most people this is all they
[53:18] know about waiting that's all they know
[53:21] Black Friday Thanksgiving oh they'll
[53:25] wait in line that's all they know about
[53:27] waiting because this is where their
[53:30] treasure is hallelujah
[53:33] they'll get up at 4 a.m. to go get the
[53:35] deal now they'll just stay up all night
[53:36] used to be they get up before you now
[53:38] they just stay up all night and they'll
[53:40] wait for the treasures of the world as
[53:43] many hours as it takes right no I've
[53:48] seen where they pay people to keep their
[53:50] spot lines so they can leave and come
[53:52] back and get their spot they're so eager
[53:55] to wait for natural things and I've said
[53:58] it before it's a shame that people will
[54:00] get up at 4:00 a.m. but can't come early
[54:01] to church and pray you know they can't
[54:03] even get an early to church but they can
[54:05] get early the best buy something's wrong
[54:07] with
[54:07] that spiritual condition and that's a
[54:10] small line because if you know the
[54:12] launch of phones they go all the way
[54:14] around the corner if you've ever seen a
[54:17] phone launch for the latest phone it'll
[54:19] go literally around the corner
[54:21] that's what sinners do I said I think
[54:25] that's what carnal Christians will do
[54:27] they'll wait on natural things instead
[54:30] of on spiritual things but this is what
[54:34] you and I should look like in the
[54:35] spiritual sense right God's Word God's
[54:40] wisdom is like a city and it's got walls
[54:43] and I'm sorry this is so close I just
[54:46] swear on today to stay low warmer you
[54:48] know in the morning but God's Word
[54:51] we'd like God's houses like this and
[54:54] we've got to lay ourselves or we've got
[54:56] a spiritually stand in line at the gate
[54:59] of doubts house and say God I'm ready to
[55:01] come in I want to come in I want I want
[55:04] your understanding
[55:05] I want your knowledge I need your wisdom
[55:07] amen it depends what which one you need
[55:10] if you need electronics really bad or
[55:12] you need a phone really bad you'll wait
[55:14] for it but we need to be like those
[55:16] Saints that lined up outside random
[55:18] Tabernacle hallelujah spiritually and
[55:21] wait upon the word of the Lord amen
[55:24] see many of those people were sick and
[55:26] that's why they were waiting they were
[55:28] desperate but we've got to be able to be
[55:31] desperate without a physical sickness
[55:33] we've got to see our spiritual condition
[55:34] and weight upon the wisdom of God amen
[55:38] open your Bible in the morning you get
[55:41] up a little earlier or for some of you
[55:43] maybe stay up a little later and get
[55:45] some time alone with God and say Lord
[55:46] Here I am I'm finally waiting upon you
[55:49] and God's been saying this whole time
[55:51] I'm waiting for you to wait upon me is
[55:54] that right that's what the Bible said
[55:57] blessed is that man or woman who waits
[56:00] at the gates of God City praise God I
[56:06] know some of you probably get two
[56:09] appointments early don't you if the
[56:13] doctor's office opens at 9:00 you're
[56:15] there at 8:50 right you got an
[56:18] appointment at noon you'll be there at
[56:19] 11:45
[56:21] and you'll sit there and wait and if the
[56:23] doctors late for half an hour you'll
[56:25] weigh because you need to see the doctor
[56:27] how much more doctor Jesus hey man I
[56:30] mean think about that that's how
[56:32] important your daily walk your daily
[56:35] communion with the Holy Spirit that's
[56:37] how important it is we've got to wait
[56:39] upon the will of God we need some more
[56:42] of this by God's grace I was just
[56:44] waiting for you to open the church doors
[56:46] brother I was so hungry to hear the word
[56:49] of God now when you see hunger like that
[56:51] then you see God move more amen
[56:54] because those who hunger and thirst
[56:56] after righteousness shall be filled
[56:59] amen and that's a reality this is what
[57:06] the scripture said this way tells us
[57:07] children be blessed and if you're gonna
[57:09] be blessed you've got to keep the word
[57:11] and you've gotta wait upon the wisdom of
[57:13] God now that's the end of that because
[57:17] that's the end of that section there I'm
[57:20] sorry I didn't read verse 35 let's read
[57:22] verse 35 for whosoever fine with me find
[57:24] its life and shall tain favor of the
[57:27] Lord so when you find wisdom at God's
[57:29] house or God's City you find life so
[57:32] wisdom is life amen I'm sorry that's the
[57:35] wrong slide their wisdom is life now
[57:38] remember brother Troy preach it how the
[57:40] Bible is the book of life and this name
[57:42] is life you could also call this book
[57:44] wisdom because if you find wisdom you
[57:47] have life right wisdom leads to life
[57:51] that's what the scripture says he that
[57:53] but he's got to be found the wisdom of
[57:56] God must be found it's never just
[57:58] stumbled into it's something where we've
[58:00] got to apply ourselves and we've got the
[58:02] hunger and just like a Mary we've got to
[58:04] come and forget about other things and
[58:07] sit at the feet of Jesus we got to find
[58:10] the wisdom of God and if we find it
[58:12] nobody can ever take it from you hey man
[58:15] they got that hallelujah verse 36 but he
[58:19] that sitteth against me wrong with his
[58:21] own soul all they that hate me love
[58:26] death isn't that striking when people
[58:28] hate the wisdom of God it shows they
[58:30] love death and they're destroying their
[58:32] own Souls
[58:35] they're saying they're saying god I
[58:37] don't want to live eternally with you
[58:39] right they're saying I'd rather spend
[58:41] eternity now we know they won't be
[58:43] eternal but they'll come to niall ation
[58:45] at some point but then what they're
[58:46] saying is I would rather be apart from
[58:48] Jesus Christ than with Jesus Christ
[58:50] there's only two choices I know about
[58:52] you but I want to be right the feet of
[58:54] Jesus amen
[58:56] but this is what wisdom leads to it
[58:59] leads to eternal life and if you really
[59:04] love wisdom it shows you love what God
[59:06] made you
[59:07] you love who God made you you love God's
[59:11] creation the Bible even says the husband
[59:13] must love his wife like he loves himself
[59:15] and Paul said every man loves himself
[59:17] even a senator loves himself and will
[59:20] give himself some new shoes or might
[59:22] like you know some of our family friends
[59:24] though the alcohol or cigarettes because
[59:26] they want to try to please their flesh
[59:28] they love themselves they'll spend money
[59:29] on themselves or look at themselves
[59:31] something nice for their birthday
[59:33] everybody loves or should love himself
[59:35] we should love ourselves in the fact
[59:37] that we are creation of God were bought
[59:40] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:42] we're his property amen so we should
[59:44] love God's property and take care of
[59:46] ourselves
[59:47] receiving the wisdom of God receiving
[59:49] the life of God amen glory but to hate
[59:53] that hate God's wisdom is to love death
[59:57] that's the opposite now in verse now the
[1:00:01] my son I move on here the my son
[1:00:04] statements now moved to chapter nineteen
[1:00:05] so they jump from chapter eight all the
[1:00:08] way to chapter 19 so we have your Bibles
[1:00:10] let's go to chapter nineteen here by the
[1:00:11] grace of the Lord you know many times
[1:00:20] you know
[1:00:20] people will and I think we don't we all
[1:00:24] can relate to this we just want to hear
[1:00:26] our voice from God or we want to hear
[1:00:28] you know like I have a supernatural
[1:00:29] dream or something like that I don't
[1:00:32] know what to do and lord show me what to
[1:00:34] do and so many times we're so we're so
[1:00:36] busy looking for something supernatural
[1:00:38] that we forget that God laid out
[1:00:40] hundreds if not a thousand of wise
[1:00:43] proverbs right in the Word of God that
[1:00:45] tells us what to do
[1:00:47] praising the heart not that there's
[1:00:49] anything wrong with seeking God for a
[1:00:50] vision or or seeking God for a voice or
[1:00:53] a gift of operation or something like
[1:00:56] that if you have confidence in
[1:00:57] somebody's gift or something there's
[1:00:59] nothing wrong with that
[1:01:00] but we must remember there's 31 chapters
[1:01:03] here of God sent Holy Ghost wisdom amen
[1:01:06] and like the Bible said together we have
[1:01:09] to set these things in front of our eyes
[1:01:11] instead of other things in front of our
[1:01:13] eyes the wise words of God must be in
[1:01:16] front of our eyes
[1:01:17] amen now we've gone through 15 of 23 my
[1:01:22] son statements those were in chapters 1
[1:01:25] to 7 now let's go to number 16 here's
[1:01:27] the 16th time Solomon says my son
[1:01:30] chapter 19 verse 27 and church Ivan
[1:01:39] through Proverbs I've been taking notes
[1:01:40] on every single verse kinda like my own
[1:01:42] little commentary you know to help me to
[1:01:44] remember these things and understand
[1:01:46] these and every single day God knows my
[1:01:48] heart something real pops up like wow
[1:01:50] something new oh my I forgot about this
[1:01:52] what why is where this could help out
[1:01:54] this this could help out that this can
[1:01:55] help out me God's Word is just waiting
[1:01:58] to be received amen
[1:01:59] he just waiting for people to line up at
[1:02:01] his door at his gates and open the gates
[1:02:03] and let that man say come on in there's
[1:02:05] plenty of wisdom for you yeah amen
[1:02:09] there's plenty of wisdom but we got to
[1:02:12] come and wait at his gates that's right
[1:02:15] verse 27 now this is just one simple
[1:02:19] scripture and then we'll jump into
[1:02:20] chapter 23 but 19:27 another my son sees
[1:02:28] my son to hear the instruction that
[1:02:30] causes thee to air from the words of
[1:02:32] knowledge just a very simple scripture
[1:02:35] so young children I look at my son and I
[1:02:37] look at the children my children if
[1:02:38] anyone instructs you on how to sin or
[1:02:42] miss the mark then Solomon says don't
[1:02:45] listen to them if any of your friends
[1:02:47] encourage you to lie or steal or cheat
[1:02:50] or lust or anything like that
[1:02:52] you've got the cease from listening to
[1:02:54] them praise God very simple but this is
[1:02:58] the wisdom of God if anyone causes you
[1:03:00] to miss the mark
[1:03:01] you must stop listening to them separate
[1:03:05] yourself like God said separate yourself
[1:03:08] come out from among them and I will
[1:03:09] receive you say the Lord and you'll be
[1:03:12] children unto me praise the Lord
[1:03:14] that's exactly right now go to chapter
[1:03:16] 23 I just want to like I said emphasize
[1:03:18] all these times the Holy Spirit had
[1:03:20] Solomon say my son chapter 23 15 we're
[1:03:26] getting there by God's grace look at
[1:03:27] that 17 to 23 we're almost there
[1:03:29] amen glory 23:15 my son if thine heart
[1:03:37] be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine
[1:03:45] let's read 16 - yeah my
[1:03:49] Rane shall rejoice when thy lips speak
[1:03:51] write things let not thine heart envy
[1:03:55] sinners but be thou in the fear of the
[1:03:57] Lord all the day long I wonder what God
[1:04:02] wants me to do today I got one good
[1:04:03] answer for you fear God all day I don't
[1:04:06] know anything else to do then fear God
[1:04:09] all day that's one thing you know is on
[1:04:11] your daily agenda is it not church it
[1:04:14] ought to be every day on there fear God
[1:04:16] respect God Reverend Scott verse 18
[1:04:20] first surely there is an end and thine
[1:04:24] expectation shall not be cut off now I'm
[1:04:27] gonna stop right there now a wise
[1:04:30] hearted son who speaks right things will
[1:04:34] rejoice the heart of his father
[1:04:36] the reigns actually means the word
[1:04:38] kidneys I didn't do much studying on the
[1:04:39] kidneys I was gonna look at that some of
[1:04:41] you know something you might know more
[1:04:42] about kidneys I don't know anything
[1:04:43] about kidneys but the word means reins
[1:04:46] or kidneys or inward parts shall rejoice
[1:04:49] so I just want to emphasize that to our
[1:04:55] children because we have numerous
[1:04:56] children here tonight and I'm sure
[1:04:59] livestreaming as well children you want
[1:05:04] to make your parents rejoice you want to
[1:05:08] make your parents very happy don't you
[1:05:13] when you say the right thing when you do
[1:05:17] the right thing it puts a deep joy in
[1:05:21] the hearts of the parents and it's only
[1:05:23] something a parent can understand right
[1:05:26] parents I see some older ones nodding
[1:05:28] there and I'm nodding it is a it is
[1:05:31] something it is such a happiness so down
[1:05:34] deep that the Bible gives it the most
[1:05:36] strong language this is the strong
[1:05:38] language the reins of the heart the very
[1:05:41] depths of your heart it rejoices the
[1:05:46] parents you know some of my happiest
[1:05:48] times I would say some of my favorite
[1:05:52] cards I've got you don't get greeting
[1:05:53] cards from people I really appreciate
[1:05:55] them my favorite ones probably the
[1:05:57] favorite one to me probably was from my
[1:05:59] dad a couple years ago I think I turned
[1:06:01] 35 and he hero
[1:06:02] me a card it's the first card he ever
[1:06:04] wrote me in my life and and anything he
[1:06:06] said he was how proud of me he was of me
[1:06:08] and and how God he was thankful what God
[1:06:10] was doing in my life and that meant so
[1:06:13] much to me because as a man you know as
[1:06:15] a man or even as a daughter no doubt you
[1:06:18] want to please your parents you want
[1:06:21] them to be happy with what you've become
[1:06:24] I don't want to let down my parents just
[1:06:27] like I don't want let down my wife I
[1:06:28] don't wanna let down my children I don't
[1:06:30] want to let down my boss I want them to
[1:06:33] be happy with what I do
[1:06:34] how many kids amen to that and so
[1:06:37] nothing will make the parent heart
[1:06:40] happier than to see their children speak
[1:06:44] the right thing
[1:06:46] so children that's one way you can live
[1:06:48] for other people how about how many know
[1:06:50] eternal life is living for others right
[1:06:53] children if you say the right thing do
[1:06:56] the right thing it will actually bring
[1:06:59] joy to your parents this is the Holy
[1:07:05] Spirit's instruction to children bring
[1:07:09] joy make your make your parents rejoice
[1:07:15] hallelujah the time you I've had the
[1:07:18] privilege of baptizing for my own
[1:07:19] children I've rejoiced every time it's
[1:07:22] just you know I think I've cried every
[1:07:24] time each one came to me first it was
[1:07:26] Malachi and then Acacia then Lydia and
[1:07:29] then Haven and each time I think I've
[1:07:31] wept just tears of joy that I it wasn't
[1:07:34] me pressuring them they felt the pull of
[1:07:37] the Holy Spirit and responded to the
[1:07:39] Holy Spirit and nothing can make a
[1:07:42] father a mother's heart more joyful than
[1:07:44] to see their children say the right
[1:07:46] thing and do the right thing amen
[1:07:50] it rejoices the rain's the very depths
[1:07:54] of the heart now he says fear God all
[1:07:57] day long children know that God's
[1:08:00] watching you all day long because
[1:08:01] there's the end there is a reaping to
[1:08:04] what you're sowing do not envy sinners
[1:08:07] because we know their end is death in
[1:08:10] hell don't envy them they're not happy
[1:08:13] if they were happy why would a
[1:08:15] multi-millionaire
[1:08:16] like Robin Williams commits suicide if
[1:08:18] money makes you happy how could a
[1:08:22] multi-million dollar person just in
[1:08:24] their life because they're so depressed
[1:08:27] money does not make you popular or happy
[1:08:31] neither does fame there's one thing that
[1:08:33] makes you happy that's walking in wisdom
[1:08:35] of the Holy Spirit that's what the Bible
[1:08:38] says that's the only thing that's gonna
[1:08:40] make you happy not for money not for
[1:08:42] fame that were a pleasure of this life
[1:08:45] but it's walking in the wisdom of God
[1:08:48] amen that's exactly right we know the
[1:08:52] end of sinners it's a parent I love this
[1:08:58] he says your expectations shall not be
[1:09:01] cut off so in other words it's hard
[1:09:03] sometimes to keep the word children but
[1:09:05] you've got to keep the word and just
[1:09:07] trust God will bless me amen
[1:09:09] your expectation your hope your faith
[1:09:13] will not be cut off God will reward you
[1:09:16] amen because the Bible said you can't
[1:09:18] plead against a possible repeat reason
[1:09:21] without that trust that faith that
[1:09:23] revelation breather cometh to God must
[1:09:25] believe that he is and he's a rewarder
[1:09:28] of them that diligently seek Him amen
[1:09:32] children God will reward you if you
[1:09:35] honor your parents God will reward you
[1:09:37] but you've got to do it diligently
[1:09:39] you've got to be faithful you've got to
[1:09:42] always say the right thing God will
[1:09:45] reward you and now for us adults we got
[1:09:48] to be better at diligently seeking God
[1:09:51] yep there's things that come up in the
[1:09:53] morning I know there's things that come
[1:09:54] up in the night things that come up in
[1:09:56] the day things that come up all the time
[1:09:57] but we've got to let the Holy Spirit joy
[1:09:59] come up in our hearts aim ahead and make
[1:10:02] time for prayer make time for worship
[1:10:04] make time for here in the Word of God
[1:10:06] it's exactly right now let's continue on
[1:10:10] now he says it again the 18th time in
[1:10:13] verse 19 of the same chapter he says my
[1:10:16] son again so these are all like little
[1:10:18] paragraphs written to his son let's go
[1:10:22] to verse 19 23 19 here
[1:10:26] my son and be wise and guide thy heart
[1:10:30] in the way now look at verse 20 veena
[1:10:36] among wine-bibber 'he's among riotous
[1:10:40] eaters of flesh to all the fancy foods
[1:10:43] right all the drinkers for the drunkard
[1:10:45] and the glutton shall come to poverty
[1:10:47] and drowsiness shall close a man with
[1:10:49] rags hearken unto thy father that begat
[1:10:53] thee and despise not thy mother when
[1:10:55] she's old buy the truth and sell it not
[1:11:00] also wisdom and instruction and
[1:11:03] understanding the father of the
[1:11:05] righteous shall greatly rejoice Oh
[1:11:08] hallelujah and he they began at the wise
[1:11:11] child shall have joy of him thy father
[1:11:15] and thy mother shall be glad and she
[1:11:17] that bear thee shall rejoice think of
[1:11:21] the prodigal son when was the father the
[1:11:23] happiest when the father say we need to
[1:11:25] have a feast we need to kill the fatted
[1:11:28] calf children when did he say that he
[1:11:31] said it when his son came home and
[1:11:33] obeyed the word of the Lord he humbled
[1:11:35] himself and said father I've sinned
[1:11:38] against heaven and earth I'm the guilty
[1:11:40] one amen and children that's what you
[1:11:43] need to do say I'm guilty take
[1:11:45] responsibility for your sins and cause
[1:11:48] to God for mercy amen it's exactly right
[1:11:52] and that was when he was the happiest he
[1:11:55] said go get a ring go get a rope he's
[1:11:57] not a servant make him a son restore his
[1:12:00] sonship and that's what Christ did not
[1:12:02] say man when we came back from the pig
[1:12:05] pens of sin put a ring on him put a seal
[1:12:08] on him put a covenant on him given the
[1:12:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:12] and let him get his position back that
[1:12:14] he had before the foundation of the
[1:12:16] world
[1:12:17] that's right amen glory now look at he
[1:12:23] says here he said obey be wise guide
[1:12:25] your heart now first remember we read
[1:12:27] last week he said keep your heart so he
[1:12:30] first said imprison your heart and now
[1:12:32] he says guide your heart so you've got
[1:12:36] to imprison it and then guide it where
[1:12:38] it's going to go so as you keep it in
[1:12:40] and keep everything out all the evil
[1:12:43] things out and you keep yourself sealed
[1:12:45] into God's presence now you've got to
[1:12:47] guard your heart guard your emotions
[1:12:49] that you don't get out of control
[1:12:52] Holly they gotta see you gotta guide
[1:12:55] your heart your you gotta control your
[1:12:57] feelings control your emotions control
[1:13:00] your thoughts and when you do this you
[1:13:04] actually produce or bear the fruit of
[1:13:06] temperance that's right
[1:13:10] so you keep your heart you keep it in
[1:13:12] prison you you have a wall around it
[1:13:14] right you protect your heart you don't
[1:13:16] let anything in but then you've got to
[1:13:18] go somewhere you've got to guide your
[1:13:20] heart as well remember proverbs 25 I
[1:13:25] love this twenty-eight he that has no
[1:13:28] rule over his own spirit is like a city
[1:13:30] that's broken down without walls when
[1:13:33] people can't control their feelings
[1:13:34] their emotions or their thoughts they're
[1:13:37] open to every attack of Satan any trick
[1:13:41] Satan can throw at them they get they
[1:13:43] get caught they get defeated because
[1:13:45] they haven't built up what's called the
[1:13:47] guidance of the heart
[1:13:49] they haven't watched their heart they
[1:13:52] haven't got enough wisdom to know that
[1:13:54] I've got to control this I've got to
[1:13:56] keep it and I've got to guard it and
[1:13:59] I've got to be ready to defeat the devil
[1:14:01] in that day of temptation amen we've got
[1:14:06] to control our feelings emotions and
[1:14:09] thoughts be wise listen to the Word of
[1:14:13] God be wise and guide your heart in the
[1:14:16] right way
[1:14:17] guide it in the way it should go now
[1:14:23] here's more on this now right after this
[1:14:26] he says oh it's avoid drunk errs and
[1:14:28] sinful feast with gluttons which lead to
[1:14:31] poverty and rags so those who overeat
[1:14:37] those who over drink come to poverty and
[1:14:40] rags hearken to your
[1:14:44] father despise not your mother when
[1:14:45] she's old remember Jesus's words about
[1:14:48] Korbin member corben in mark chapter 7
[1:14:51] remember that the Pharisees were telling
[1:14:54] the people oh you don't have to take
[1:14:56] care of your mother and father just take
[1:14:58] the money that you would have given to
[1:15:00] your parents and give that as an
[1:15:02] offering to the temple because those
[1:15:04] Pharisees were selfish they were lovers
[1:15:05] of money right and so Jesus had to
[1:15:09] correct them and said you've made the
[1:15:11] Word of God of none effect by your
[1:15:13] tradition see they were despising their
[1:15:17] parents when they were old for whatever
[1:15:19] reason they didn't want to give their
[1:15:20] money to their parents when their
[1:15:21] parents took care of them and the Bible
[1:15:24] said children hearken to your father
[1:15:26] don't despise your mother when she gets
[1:15:28] old but listen to them honor them by the
[1:15:35] truth the Bible says and don't sell it
[1:15:37] to get wisdom instruction and
[1:15:42] understanding see with all thy getting
[1:15:44] get something that's one thing we're
[1:15:47] supposed to get every day is the wisdom
[1:15:49] of God we're supposed to go to the gate
[1:15:52] wait at the gate wait to the doors open
[1:15:55] and then walk in and get as much wisdom
[1:15:57] as you can what a what a blessing what a
[1:16:00] promise that we can walk into God's
[1:16:02] gates and courts and take out all the
[1:16:05] wisdom that he can give us by God's
[1:16:07] grace amen don't sell out your morals
[1:16:11] children don't sell it out by the truth
[1:16:15] make a transaction exchange while your
[1:16:19] unbelief for truth and don't sell it out
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:24] but leave this message and don't sell it
[1:16:26] out praise God I don't know let people
[1:16:29] tell you bad things about brother
[1:16:30] Branham you listen to what brother
[1:16:32] Branham said listening to the tapes and
[1:16:34] I brother Branham here what a real
[1:16:36] prophet of God says look how he lives
[1:16:39] his life look how humble he is look at
[1:16:41] him don't sell it out don't sell it the
[1:16:44] Bible truth if the Bible says it we
[1:16:46] believe it that settles it
[1:16:47] don't sell it out children it's hard we
[1:16:52] know like with our children it's hard
[1:16:54] you know they're attracted to sports or
[1:16:56] they're attracted to
[1:16:57] fashion and cutting the hair maybe it
[1:16:59] and wearing tight clothes and they might
[1:17:02] be attracted to all these things but
[1:17:05] ultimately it comes down to two voices
[1:17:06] it's either the voice of God or it's the
[1:17:08] voice of death Satan and the children
[1:17:12] have to trust that the trust God that
[1:17:15] God's ways will lead to life amen
[1:17:18] don't sell it out it's brought you this
[1:17:21] far children it'll bring you all the way
[1:17:24] home to heaven hey the head
[1:17:25] glory amen so buy the truth make a
[1:17:32] spiritual transaction whether Bram said
[1:17:34] that's what later see is not doing today
[1:17:36] like I said they want to make natural
[1:17:37] transactions at best buy at the Apple
[1:17:41] store well Graham said Jesus's counsels
[1:17:44] turfs very serious to the point he
[1:17:47] dresses he directs his last day Church
[1:17:49] to one hope we have one hope and that
[1:17:51] hope is Christ he says come unto me and
[1:17:54] buy it's evident from this phrase buy of
[1:17:57] me that the Laodicean church is not at
[1:18:00] all dealing with Jesus for the spiritual
[1:18:02] products of the kingdom amen
[1:18:05] the spiritual products the spiritual
[1:18:10] blessings of God so we said temperance
[1:18:13] is a spiritual product how many want to
[1:18:15] make a transaction for temperance and
[1:18:17] glory amen
[1:18:19] I don't want to make a transaction for
[1:18:21] divine healing price of the heart for
[1:18:24] faith revelation you see these are all
[1:18:27] things that need to be made transactions
[1:18:30] for and the best way to do it is on our
[1:18:33] knees in prayer another way to do it is
[1:18:36] to receive the word while the preachers
[1:18:38] preaching it say that's right
[1:18:40] I believe it it's revealed to my heart
[1:18:42] I'm going to stay with that word amen
[1:18:44] we've got to make a transaction in other
[1:18:47] words we've got to cast out unbelief
[1:18:49] doubt criticism fear pain unbelief we've
[1:18:53] got to cast that down and say I'm
[1:18:55] getting rid of that Jesus you take care
[1:18:57] of that I'll receive your products amen
[1:18:59] glory all spiritual products are so
[1:19:06] available today you know let's get a lot
[1:19:07] easier to make natural transactions you
[1:19:10] can do Apple pay on your phone
[1:19:11] and you can send somebody on the spirit
[1:19:14] on a natural transaction just over your
[1:19:15] phone within a matter of seconds if I
[1:19:18] want I can send 50 bucks to my wife in a
[1:19:20] matter of seconds it's just like that
[1:19:23] and that's how easy it really is see
[1:19:26] that's just that's copying what God did
[1:19:29] that's how easy it is for us to have a
[1:19:32] transaction of receiving God's Word in
[1:19:34] our hearts hey man boy I don't know
[1:19:41] about you but you know we had wonderful
[1:19:42] meetings this past Saturday and Sunday
[1:19:43] but every time I leave when I'm not
[1:19:45] preaching I've received something from
[1:19:46] God
[1:19:47] every time my hope my strength my
[1:19:51] courage my discipline my dedication my
[1:19:56] loyalty every time I hear the word of
[1:19:58] God God is adding something to me I'm
[1:20:00] making some spiritual transaction amen
[1:20:03] I'm not going to leave this door unless
[1:20:05] I made a transaction say Jesus help me
[1:20:08] to be more like you forgive me of this
[1:20:10] I'm grabbing the hold of your promise
[1:20:12] amen you've got to do that or else
[1:20:16] you're gonna get real low real low
[1:20:20] see that's what later to see a dozen one
[1:20:22] they want all the natural products
[1:20:24] they'll make every exchange they'll go
[1:20:26] to every means like I said anyway
[1:20:28] they'll go PayPal you know the
[1:20:29] godiscover PNC they'll go every way they
[1:20:33] can to make natural transactions but
[1:20:35] Jesus saying buy the truth make a
[1:20:38] transaction so you'll live the truth
[1:20:43] that's what the scripture says by the
[1:20:45] truth sell it not brother Branham even
[1:20:48] says look he says what about all these
[1:20:49] churches and schools and hospitals and
[1:20:51] missionary ventures etc God is not in
[1:20:54] them as long as their denominational
[1:20:56] seed in spirit if they're just doing it
[1:20:59] to say well we're better than the
[1:21:00] Lutheran's or we're the biggest mega
[1:21:02] church and we're better than the other
[1:21:04] churches in the area because we sent
[1:21:06] twenty thousand dollars instead of ten
[1:21:07] thousand dollars if they're doing it
[1:21:09] with that spirit God doesn't even
[1:21:11] receive a church right it's got to be
[1:21:14] the right act with the right spirit or
[1:21:17] else you're just trying to do God a
[1:21:19] service without it being his will that's
[1:21:22] how we should
[1:21:23] - we shouldn't well I'm gonna come early
[1:21:24] the price I can be more spiritual than
[1:21:26] Jesse it's not a competition it's so I
[1:21:30] can die to myself and Christ can live in
[1:21:32] me Amen because I'm fighting myself and
[1:21:35] I've got to overcome myself amen
[1:21:37] that's your motivation to come to way at
[1:21:41] the gates of Christ's City his city of
[1:21:45] wisdom hey man glory look at verse 26
[1:21:50] here I love this part right here my son
[1:21:56] give me thine heart and let thine eyes
[1:21:58] observe my ways I love don't you love
[1:22:01] that Solomon he he could have asked for
[1:22:05] anything right we know and he says one
[1:22:07] thing he sent said son give me your
[1:22:09] heart in other words love me more than
[1:22:13] you love anything else that's what I'd
[1:22:16] say to my son Malachi give me your heart
[1:22:19] watch how I live my life watch how I
[1:22:22] love Jesus Christ and that's what every
[1:22:24] parent desires how many parents desire
[1:22:26] that children look around at your
[1:22:27] parents hands look at look at your
[1:22:28] parents hands around look at your
[1:22:30] parents hands every parent wants you to
[1:22:33] give them your heart in other words love
[1:22:37] them above everything else except God
[1:22:40] because when you're loving them you are
[1:22:42] loving God look at Solomon he could have
[1:22:45] had anything he had all the money and
[1:22:47] riches and he said give me your heart I
[1:22:49] want your love I want your devotion
[1:22:52] watch my life amen
[1:22:55] what a beautiful is portion of Scripture
[1:23:01] give me your heart and let thine eyes
[1:23:04] observe my ways now look he says this in
[1:23:07] part because next he's gonna get into
[1:23:09] this strange woman again so he must be
[1:23:11] talking to teenage boys here because we
[1:23:14] know what is Sampson knew he gave
[1:23:15] Delilah his heart right instead of
[1:23:17] giving God his heart
[1:23:18] look at verse 23 no I'm sorry verse 27
[1:23:23] for a is a deep ditch and a
[1:23:27] strange woman is a narrow pit she also
[1:23:29] lies in wait as for a prey and increases
[1:23:31] the transgressions among men so he says
[1:23:36] give me your heart don't give your heart
[1:23:38] to lusting after women don't give your
[1:23:41] heart to lusting after a man how many
[1:23:44] people have we seen coming the message
[1:23:45] and then they leave the message for the
[1:23:47] sake of lust just a relationship with
[1:23:49] somebody oh I've seen so many of friends
[1:23:52] from the past so many people that got
[1:23:54] baptized people I looked up to and I
[1:23:58] thought my these people are really
[1:24:00] spiritual and within a matter of years
[1:24:03] they're not even coming to church and
[1:24:05] don't even don't even live the message
[1:24:09] you see because they never gave God
[1:24:11] their heart and and you better you and I
[1:24:15] better understand God's going to test
[1:24:17] every one of us to really show what's
[1:24:19] inside of our heart right all the tests
[1:24:24] and trials are to prove what's in you if
[1:24:27] you fail a test it proved your heart
[1:24:30] wasn't strong enough in that area praise
[1:24:33] God and God trying to show you your
[1:24:35] weakness so that you'll you'll make a
[1:24:37] transaction amen you'll leave that and
[1:24:40] you'll accept God's Word and you'll obey
[1:24:42] God's Word amen give me your heart son
[1:24:46] because these bees women these he
[1:24:49] says are deep ditches these immoral
[1:24:52] women he says not only are they
[1:24:56] their narrow pits they are predators
[1:24:59] they are the lions that Paul was talking
[1:25:02] about the devil is like a roaring lion
[1:25:04] seeking whom he may devour the devil
[1:25:08] doesn't come like a lion he isn't like a
[1:25:10] roaring lion but he's disguised behind
[1:25:13] evil women evil men is that right
[1:25:18] that's how Satan's disguise children
[1:25:21] he's disguised as this beautiful girl
[1:25:23] but with the evil heart or a handsome
[1:25:26] young man
[1:25:26] who's got an evil heart that's the
[1:25:29] roaring lion in our day many times he's
[1:25:34] a predator and he will cause increasing
[1:25:39] of transgression Court of the Bible
[1:25:40] that's what it says in verse 28 she also
[1:25:43] lieth in wait as a prey and increases
[1:25:45] the transgression the Hmong men so she's
[1:25:47] causing other people to increase their
[1:25:49] sinning
[1:25:53] and remember they're religious like we
[1:25:55] saw last week she paid her vows she paid
[1:25:58] her ties she paid her offerings she paid
[1:26:00] all those things but she says I've got
[1:26:02] this bed and and her talk was smooth as
[1:26:04] oil and all these-- and she she's
[1:26:06] painted this picture all the husband
[1:26:08] won't be home yet she's so religious
[1:26:11] right she goes to church just because
[1:26:15] someone goes the message church children
[1:26:17] don't mean you want to get involved with
[1:26:18] him they've got to come God's provided
[1:26:22] way they've got to come through a
[1:26:24] character life they got to come through
[1:26:26] a real godly experience and they got to
[1:26:28] come through your parents now I'm
[1:26:29] preaching that because Lydia's 13 now
[1:26:31] and there might be some boys that start
[1:26:33] liking her in the next few years so I'm
[1:26:35] preparing her heart and I'm preparing my
[1:26:38] heart to anyone that keeps sinning and
[1:26:44] anyone that makes you want to sin
[1:26:47] instead of obey the word is the wrong
[1:26:49] person for you I don't care how much
[1:26:53] they come to church I don't care if they
[1:26:54] play it and sing specials we've all seen
[1:26:57] people that sing specials and don't live
[1:26:59] the right word we've seen preachers that
[1:27:01] preach and they don't live the right
[1:27:02] word it's not how religious it's how
[1:27:06] loyal they are to truth have they bought
[1:27:09] the truth and not sold it out amen see a
[1:27:14] godly woman my son maokai a godly woman
[1:27:18] will make you want to be more righteous
[1:27:20] okay even when you're wrong her chaste
[1:27:24] or innocent now chase means innocent or
[1:27:27] real Christian woman is so innocent or
[1:27:29] chaste that even when you're wrong her
[1:27:32] innocent spirit will make you want to do
[1:27:35] what's right
[1:27:35] it'll humble you and make you want to
[1:27:38] repent and do what's right and the
[1:27:39] church said that's in first Peter 3 1 &
[1:27:42] 2 she should be so holy so pure so
[1:27:48] innocent as she makes you want to repent
[1:27:51] and get right with God now how many
[1:27:57] stirrers are we gonna find like that out
[1:27:58] in the world we can find any artifice
[1:28:02] gonna find any that are so innocent and
[1:28:04] pure wearing short-shorts showing off
[1:28:08] their body parts hello how many innocent
[1:28:13] women are we gonna find out in the world
[1:28:16] now how many innocent women are gonna
[1:28:17] find the church well and our church
[1:28:20] hopefully will find a lot more but see
[1:28:23] this is the wisdom this is wisdom from
[1:28:24] 3,000 years ago church right 3,000 years
[1:28:29] ago we're thankful for the wisdom of God
[1:28:34] now he ends the chapter with this whole
[1:28:37] section on alcohol so verses 30 through
[1:28:43] 35 major on alcohol I preached on that
[1:28:45] recently when I looked at the the
[1:28:47] liberties now remember wine is a Liberty
[1:28:51] as long as it's used for medicinal
[1:28:53] purposes and as long as you don't use it
[1:28:56] to cause somebody to stumble right
[1:29:00] because that's what Paul says Paul says
[1:29:02] if you're drinking wine will cause
[1:29:05] somebody stumble you said I won't drink
[1:29:06] any wine or eat any meat or whatever as
[1:29:09] long as the world stands because we know
[1:29:13] Jesus drank wine so it must have been a
[1:29:14] very small amount of wine or it was
[1:29:17] either watered-down one of the other is
[1:29:18] either small amount or is watered-down
[1:29:20] couldn't be I don't see how it could be
[1:29:22] anything else as I read all these
[1:29:23] history things these articles and
[1:29:25] commentaries so you know this but just
[1:29:28] so just to back it up psalmist says who
[1:29:31] has woes who has troubles who has
[1:29:33] sorrows who has contentions and fights
[1:29:36] who babbles with their mouths who has
[1:29:39] wounds and red eyes who has the who has
[1:29:42] them they all belong to drunkards
[1:29:45] drunkards people that can't quit the
[1:29:49] bottle and then in verse 33 the Bible
[1:29:53] said that wine will increase your sexual
[1:29:55] immorality so it's only going to wine
[1:29:57] will only magnify your lust battle and
[1:30:04] it will all
[1:30:05] magnify perverse words that you say it
[1:30:09] doesn't help
[1:30:09] it actually magnifies and makes it worse
[1:30:13] that's what verse 33 says let's read
[1:30:16] that by the eyes shall behold strange
[1:30:17] women and thine heart shall utter
[1:30:19] perverse things when he's drinking
[1:30:23] here's a little I mean this is common
[1:30:25] sense but I looked up I just looked up a
[1:30:27] medical journal and it said they did a
[1:30:30] 10-year study on public health problems
[1:30:32] associated with early drinking from the
[1:30:34] seventh grade so Lydia what grade are
[1:30:36] you in
[1:30:37] seven okay so Wow so it's from your to
[1:30:39] 7th to 12th grade this is just the
[1:30:41] abstract now I didn't go in the deed I
[1:30:42] don't even read the whole thing I just
[1:30:43] read the abstract okay I just read the
[1:30:46] results and it says early drinkers now
[1:30:48] this is in seventh grade to 12th grade
[1:30:50] and experimenters so see children don't
[1:30:53] even experiment with it don't even give
[1:30:56] Satan a chance to get in your life
[1:31:00] experimenters were more likely than
[1:31:02] non-drinkers to report academic problems
[1:31:04] so they fail in school they have more
[1:31:07] substance abuse they get into more drugs
[1:31:09] once they start drinking and delinquent
[1:31:12] behavior in both middle school in high
[1:31:14] school by young adulthood early alcohol
[1:31:17] use was associated with employment
[1:31:18] problems they can't keep a job you can't
[1:31:22] trust a person to do a job that drinks
[1:31:25] too much or smokes or does marijuana or
[1:31:29] you name it the opioid I can't even say
[1:31:32] how do you say that Oh Boyd okay I can't
[1:31:35] say it sorry but anyone who's addicted
[1:31:38] to these type of things and it's not a
[1:31:39] laughing matter I'm not laughing at that
[1:31:41] I'm what I'm saying is that you can't
[1:31:43] trust them to keep a job and they'll get
[1:31:47] into other substance abuse and they'll
[1:31:49] have criminal and violent but criminal
[1:31:51] and violent behavior do any of our
[1:31:54] children want to be dropouts and stop
[1:31:55] learning at school then you are children
[1:31:57] do that many of our children want
[1:31:59] handcuffs on them to be taken off to
[1:32:00] jail I don't hope not
[1:32:04] well then the thing to do is avoid
[1:32:06] alcohol praise the Lord avoid it now you
[1:32:11] have it at communion that's the only
[1:32:13] time you have it and that's to remind
[1:32:15] you eat each week about the living power
[1:32:17] of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:32:19] amen not each week every time each time
[1:32:22] we have it but we're having this Sunday
[1:32:23] night so we're having a community this
[1:32:25] Sunday night at 4 p.m. by God's grace
[1:32:28] that was in the email so see children if
[1:32:31] you want to stay out of jail if you want
[1:32:35] to stay in school and learn if you were
[1:32:37] to make mom happy and dad happy
[1:32:39] avoid wine avoid relationships that are
[1:32:43] wrong and love your parents with all
[1:32:46] your heart amen
[1:32:47] but God is first I'm not exalting
[1:32:51] parents above God I under hope you
[1:32:52] understand what I'm saying
[1:32:52] love your parents give your parents your
[1:32:58] heart praise God and that's what science
[1:33:03] I mean science says this look at verse
[1:33:05] 34 this is quite a it's kind of kind of
[1:33:07] funny statement you know the Bible we've
[1:33:09] seen that little sarcasm in the book of
[1:33:10] Proverbs chapter 31 we saw some a few
[1:33:14] Sundays ago but look at verse 34 yay so
[1:33:16] if you're if you're drinking too long
[1:33:18] yea thou shalt be as he that lie down in
[1:33:21] the midst of the sea I feel I'm tired I
[1:33:23] need a nap I'm just gonna go sleep in
[1:33:25] the middle of the ocean or he that lieth
[1:33:29] upon the top of a mast on a ship so
[1:33:34] kinda looks like this and I covered up
[1:33:36] he's gotten easy-to-understand on so
[1:33:38] when you drink too much it's like you're
[1:33:41] saying I just want to go sleep in the
[1:33:42] middle of the ocean I'm really tired I
[1:33:45] think I'll go lay down I think that's
[1:33:47] going to turn out good for him I don't
[1:33:49] care the children are doing swimming
[1:33:51] lessons I don't care how long you can
[1:33:52] float you can't float that loan to get
[1:33:54] back to land if you're out in the middle
[1:33:55] of Pacific or the Atlantic or wherever
[1:33:58] you are and then the Bible said it's
[1:34:01] like well I think I was just laid out on
[1:34:02] a mass and I'm sorry
[1:34:03] he's got a shirt on I forgot to cover
[1:34:05] right up there I didn't want to offend
[1:34:06] any sisters so I I forgot I forgot to
[1:34:08] put that up there but how about going
[1:34:09] take a nice nap on the top of a mass
[1:34:12] which it was your would you like that
[1:34:15] you know yeah it's gonna give you real
[1:34:18] big back pain after a while and that is
[1:34:22] how foolish it is to start experimenting
[1:34:24] with alcohol and drugs and evil women
[1:34:29] and also
[1:34:31] perverse words that's how foolish the
[1:34:34] violets that's as foolish as the Bible
[1:34:36] could make it it's like taking a nap in
[1:34:39] the middle of the ocean
[1:34:40] sleeping on a mast avoid those things
[1:34:44] with all your heart
[1:34:46] amen let me go ten more minutes I'll try
[1:34:49] to finish up here by the grace of the
[1:34:51] Lord I just want to give the children
[1:34:53] some visuals so you remember you know
[1:34:56] this is the wisdom of God this is life
[1:35:00] you can't put a price on the value of
[1:35:03] this sermon tonight because it's not my
[1:35:06] words it's God's words with all your
[1:35:10] getting get wisdom children right
[1:35:13] nothing is to be desired nothing that we
[1:35:17] could desire can be compared to the
[1:35:19] wisdom of God hallelujah now let's try
[1:35:26] to maybe finish this up I think I got a
[1:35:27] couple more I'm on 20 of 23 I was hoping
[1:35:29] to get done tonight okay go to chapter
[1:35:32] 24 now chapter 24 he finished chapter 23
[1:35:35] these are all the times Solomon in his
[1:35:37] wisdom addressed my son verse 10 that's
[1:35:41] right verse 13 24 verse 13 my son eat
[1:35:45] the honey because it is good and the
[1:35:48] honeycomb because of the sweet to thy
[1:35:49] taste so shall the knowledge of wisdom
[1:35:52] be unto thy soul when thou has found it
[1:35:55] then there shall be a reward and the
[1:35:57] expectation should not be cut off so if
[1:36:01] I'm preaching wisdom tonight and you're
[1:36:03] eating it it should taste like honey in
[1:36:05] your mouth that's if you're a believer
[1:36:09] these words are like honey oh it's so
[1:36:12] sweet
[1:36:13] God's Word is so true I've tasted I know
[1:36:16] it's true I've tasted that the Lord is
[1:36:18] good amen right glory November he says
[1:36:25] your faith will be rewarded but he
[1:36:27] doesn't say when you've got to trust him
[1:36:30] that in God's time he'll reward you for
[1:36:32] keeping his word that's right now go to
[1:36:36] verse 15 and 16 lay not way
[1:36:41] Oh wicked man against the dwelling of
[1:36:43] the righteous spoil not his resting
[1:36:45] place for a just man Follis seven times
[1:36:49] and rises up again but the wicked shall
[1:36:53] fall into mischief so see the point that
[1:36:57] he's making is that a wicked man will
[1:36:59] remain wicked but a righteous man will
[1:37:03] may he might stumble in the wickedness
[1:37:04] but you know he's going to rise again
[1:37:06] and seven is the number of completion
[1:37:08] right so you have a complete victory
[1:37:10] over whatever he stumbles over amen
[1:37:13] complete victory is promised to the
[1:37:17] righteous we may fall but we get up by
[1:37:22] God's grace now this is quite striking
[1:37:25] this is something I've never this is one
[1:37:26] of those times that have just jumped off
[1:37:28] the pages in verse I believe it's uh
[1:37:34] where did I verse 17 yeah yeah 17 yeah
[1:37:39] this is quite striking and I was trying
[1:37:41] to think of a Bible example this and I
[1:37:42] couldn't think of one but just look at
[1:37:44] what the Bible says verse 17 18 rejoice
[1:37:46] not when thine enemy falls oh we got to
[1:37:49] be careful with this one and let not
[1:37:52] thine heart be glad when he stumbles now
[1:37:54] the trouble is sometimes the enemy's
[1:37:56] right in your own church or right in
[1:37:58] your own family and the church said Amen
[1:38:01] I'll say it verse 19 fret not thyself
[1:38:05] because of evil men I'm sorry I ever
[1:38:07] skipped 18 lest the Lord see it so if
[1:38:10] the Lord sees you happy that when your
[1:38:12] enemies fell you're happy oh thank God
[1:38:15] that brother fell I'm so glad this evil
[1:38:17] thing happened to his sister
[1:38:18] look what God's gonna do on this earth
[1:38:21] now I don't say this don't say anything
[1:38:23] about the eternal consequences it's just
[1:38:25] saying about counts the consequences on
[1:38:27] this earth look what it says in verse 18
[1:38:31] lest the Lord see you and it displeased
[1:38:34] him and he turn away his wrath from him
[1:38:36] Wow
[1:38:38] we should feel sorry when our enemies go
[1:38:41] through hard times in church that takes
[1:38:43] a real move the Holy Spirit in your life
[1:38:45] because every bone in you says well this
[1:38:47] brother did that this sister said that
[1:38:49] they do they're just getting what they
[1:38:51] deserve
[1:38:52] they're just reaping what they saw
[1:38:55] but if God sees us rejoicing about that
[1:38:58] God will see that and he'll lessen their
[1:39:00] punishment on this earth that was
[1:39:03] striking is like I never read that
[1:39:05] before so it helped me to humble myself
[1:39:08] and say Lord the enemies I have helped
[1:39:12] me not to rejoice help me to love them
[1:39:14] and help me to pity their condition they
[1:39:16] don't know how to repent they don't know
[1:39:18] how to serve you they don't know how to
[1:39:20] treat a real man of God or a woman of
[1:39:22] God or a child of God they don't know
[1:39:23] how do that have them forgive them they
[1:39:25] don't know what they're doing
[1:39:30] so it seems like the only time we can
[1:39:32] really rejoice it is once Satan's cast
[1:39:35] into the lake of fire now you the one
[1:39:37] time you can say holiday play but we
[1:39:41] obviously we won't be happy when we see
[1:39:44] ones that we knew humans going to hell
[1:39:46] we won't be happy because Paul said I'd
[1:39:49] rather be cursed me than to see them my
[1:39:51] brother's lost we'll be we might be sad
[1:39:54] we might ah but the one time we can
[1:39:57] rejoice is when the the devil and his
[1:39:59] angels are cast in that lake of fire and
[1:40:01] now there's no more temptation to any
[1:40:03] man or woman amen
[1:40:05] not striking Church if you don't get
[1:40:07] nothing out of it hope you got that do
[1:40:09] not rejoice when your enemy stumbles or
[1:40:11] God will shorten their punishment
[1:40:14] striking verse 21 24 21 my son fear thou
[1:40:21] the Lord and the king and metal not with
[1:40:26] them that are given to charge so don't
[1:40:28] play around with leaders of the
[1:40:30] government right don't mess around with
[1:40:32] them that's why I don't get into bashing
[1:40:34] I don't mass Trump on Facebook I never
[1:40:36] bashed Obama on Facebook
[1:40:37] I don't bash anybody I try not to bash
[1:40:39] them like that if I've got to bash
[1:40:40] somebody then it's not really me bashing
[1:40:42] I believe it's behind the Pope but I
[1:40:44] believe it's the holy spirit bringing
[1:40:45] correction to them because brother BAM
[1:40:47] said there's got to be a voice cry out
[1:40:49] against the sin done in this city
[1:40:50] there's got to be some voice crying out
[1:40:53] against the evils but see he said don't
[1:40:56] mess don't start meddling and and don't
[1:40:58] know try to get into situations like
[1:41:00] that
[1:41:01] look at verse 22 for the calamity shall
[1:41:05] rise suddenly and who knoweth the ruin
[1:41:06] of them both my of
[1:41:08] King these things also below verse 23 to
[1:41:14] the wise it is not good to have respect
[1:41:16] to persons he that saith unto the wicked
[1:41:19] that righteous him shall the people
[1:41:21] curse nation's job for him but to them
[1:41:24] that rebuked him shall be delight and a
[1:41:27] good blessing should come upon them so
[1:41:29] see church if you want a good blessing
[1:41:30] there's times you got to rebuke people
[1:41:33] right that's what the Bible said to them
[1:41:36] that rebuke him a wicked person a good
[1:41:40] blessing should come upon them see and
[1:41:43] for me I'll just be honest it's really
[1:41:45] hard for me to rebuke people so I if I
[1:41:48] have the strength to do it then I know
[1:41:49] it was really God in me when I do it
[1:41:51] right to their face right all right over
[1:41:54] the phone or however you do it but a
[1:41:56] good blessing will come on you for
[1:41:58] standing up for truth amen so there are
[1:42:03] times when we rebuke God will bless us
[1:42:06] verse 26 every man shall kiss of his
[1:42:09] lips that giveth a right answer
[1:42:11] I like verse 27 this is for your work
[1:42:13] ethic now remember this is part of his
[1:42:14] sentence to his son prepare thy work
[1:42:17] without and make it fit for thyself in
[1:42:19] the field and afterward build on house
[1:42:21] so before you build a house prepare the
[1:42:24] land right before you build something if
[1:42:27] it's gonna last you've got to build it
[1:42:29] the right way you've got to work at it
[1:42:32] you've got to to give it a sure
[1:42:34] foundation you've got to do it the right
[1:42:37] way so whenever you work do it the right
[1:42:41] way don't do a half-hearted job as we
[1:42:45] tell you son prepare the field before
[1:42:48] you build the house you need a solid
[1:42:50] foundation and the best solid solid
[1:42:53] foundation I know is the Word of God
[1:42:55] look what he says let's keep going there
[1:42:59] that was verse 34 third 30 yeah 30 now
[1:43:03] I'm sorry I was burst 2728 beam out a
[1:43:05] witness against thy neighbor without
[1:43:07] cause and to see not with thy lips o
[1:43:09] children watch your mouth always say the
[1:43:11] truth say now I will do so to him as he
[1:43:13] had done to me I'll render to every man
[1:43:15] according to his works okay so we must
[1:43:17] follow the golden rule children do unto
[1:43:20] others as you would have them do unto
[1:43:21] you don't go
[1:43:22] after neighbor just because he is
[1:43:24] something wrong to your property don't
[1:43:25] go after him and return him back return
[1:43:27] kindness for evil return a program
[1:43:32] should return a slap with the kiss he
[1:43:34] says right now verse 30 is another 30 to
[1:43:39] 34 is more on work ethic I went by the
[1:43:42] field of the slothful by the vineyard of
[1:43:44] the man void of understanding and lo was
[1:43:46] all grown over a thorns and nettles had
[1:43:48] covered the face thereof and the stone
[1:43:50] wall there was broken down then I saw
[1:43:52] this and considered it well I looked
[1:43:53] upon it and received instruction so
[1:43:56] children remember you can learn from
[1:43:58] every situation the children are
[1:44:02] supposed to learn from their parents how
[1:44:03] we know we just read that tonight he
[1:44:05] said son observe my ways give me your
[1:44:08] heart
[1:44:08] well now Solomon saying if you walk by a
[1:44:11] field and a man hasn't kept his garden
[1:44:13] he hasn't kept his field he said
[1:44:15] consider that lazy man and learn from it
[1:44:18] in the last three or four years I've
[1:44:20] walked into some pretty messy apartments
[1:44:22] trying to help out people and they're
[1:44:25] lazy but they they have all the trash
[1:44:27] around but they're sitting at the video
[1:44:28] games playing video games oh how sad is
[1:44:32] that church how sad is that everything
[1:44:36] is falling apart or you know having
[1:44:39] trouble paying the rent or having
[1:44:40] trouble keeping a job everything's
[1:44:42] falling apart over the last few years
[1:44:43] I've just seen it with my own eyes and
[1:44:46] instead of condemning them we should
[1:44:48] look at that and learn from that and say
[1:44:50] God I'm gonna work harder when I get
[1:44:52] home let's say into our feet that's my
[1:44:56] time learn from remember Jesus of all
[1:45:00] people jesus said remember who remember
[1:45:02] Lot's wife a bad example so the Holy
[1:45:08] Spirit again pulls up a bad example of a
[1:45:11] man who can't keep his he can't keep his
[1:45:13] field clean right he can't keep his
[1:45:15] crops coming he's so lazy he can't keep
[1:45:19] his house in order his life in order
[1:45:21] right
[1:45:22] and he says you take a look at this and
[1:45:25] you understand this learn from this now
[1:45:32] he goes
[1:45:33] bit further he said these people like to
[1:45:34] sleep all the time yet a little sleep a
[1:45:37] little slumber a little folding of the
[1:45:38] hands to sleep so shall thy poverty come
[1:45:41] as one that travaileth and I want as in
[1:45:43] our man oh just so tired I just got to
[1:45:48] get more sleep I slept 12 hours last
[1:45:50] night I just need to take another nap I
[1:45:52] had the I didn't have to go to work due
[1:45:54] to a course I haven't worked for the
[1:45:55] last three weeks collected my
[1:45:58] unemployment or I don't know what
[1:45:59] they're doing selling drugs or whatever
[1:46:02] stealing I know people have done that
[1:46:03] they steal from the store and says they
[1:46:04] don't have a job how wicked is that and
[1:46:07] the Holy Spirit said learn from that you
[1:46:10] don't want your life to become that you
[1:46:13] and me somebody looks at the field they
[1:46:15] prepare it they get everything set order
[1:46:17] and then you build a godly life you
[1:46:20] build a testimony that can stand the
[1:46:22] test of time that's a real Christian
[1:46:26] well we're almost done so maybe next
