[0:01] so I want to preach on this thought
[0:03] uh Wednesday you know we had a short
[0:05] little bible study there I I was bad on
[0:08] a headache you know so that's why I sat
[0:09] down and preached uh right from my
[0:11] little recliner there on Wednesday I was
[0:14] just too tired to kind of stand and
[0:15] preach that whole time but God that was
[0:17] the only time I felt really sick all
[0:18] week so I thank God for that but
[0:22] um we finished uh that the the sermon
[0:25] from uh when David numbered the people
[0:27] Wednesday but today you know I got this
[0:29] uh I've had this thought on my heart for
[0:31] months I've been talking about it well
[0:32] not at least one month the double-minded
[0:34] man is unstable in all of his ways so I
[0:36] want to look at that tonight or this
[0:38] morning rather the double-minded man is
[0:40] unstable in all his
[0:43] ways and the Lord Vindicated this in a
[0:45] couple ways you know I've I've heard
[0:47] different preachers preach on it I was
[0:49] studying it and then I'd found uh Simon
[0:53] preached three years ago and I was
[0:56] sitting in the back and I took a
[0:57] screenshot of one of these scriptures on
[0:59] the unstable man I was like something
[1:01] just struck me in that moment brother
[1:02] William probably knows what you probably
[1:03] know what I'm talking about something
[1:04] will just strike you like this is you
[1:06] know this might be a regular sermon but
[1:07] that thing just struck me and so I felt
[1:10] like uh it struck me for the right time
[1:12] and season praise God so I'm going to
[1:15] preach it here today uh hope it'll be a
[1:16] blessing to you and uh I want to start
[1:21] in James
[1:23] 1 verse 8 then we'll read James
[1:26] 4:8 I'm going to preach through the text
[1:28] of these verses vers so we get the
[1:31] context so we get the understanding on
[1:33] who he's talking to who is James talking
[1:35] to right we know James was likely the
[1:37] first book ever written down in the New
[1:40] Testament right he was the we'd say half
[1:43] brother of Jesus right uh course Jesus
[1:47] was not conceived of the natural seed uh
[1:50] but he was we'd say his stepbrother in
[1:53] the same family so James was a son of
[1:55] Joseph and Mary we believe one of they
[1:57] at least seven children right they at
[1:58] least seven so Jesus was born into a big
[2:00] family and God took care of him
[2:01] Hallelujah so God takes care as the big
[2:03] big families I'm a witness of that but
[2:05] James wrote this and U you know I've
[2:07] recommended this you even before I came
[2:08] in the message I've told people when
[2:10] when they became a Christian I said read
[2:11] the book of James for some reason the
[2:13] Holy Spirit put it on my heart when I
[2:15] first got saved I read the book of James
[2:16] it did so much for me it showed you the
[2:18] basics of Christianity just how a
[2:21] Christian should act right how a
[2:23] Christian should uh manage their daily
[2:25] life what kinds of things should they
[2:26] say how should they treat the poor you
[2:28] know there's so much revelation in here
[2:30] and they even got the latter R in here
[2:31] brother William even the latter rain is
[2:33] in the Book of James it's amazing to
[2:35] think all God can place inside of these
[2:37] books Hallelujah there's so much
[2:38] Revelation for us how many you believe
[2:39] that amen James 1 ver8 we look at a
[2:43] double-minded man is unstable in all
[2:47] notice all his ways
[2:51] Hallelujah James 1 ver8 let's read that
[2:54] then we'll read James 4:8 i' like to
[2:55] hear your voice if you can 1 2 3 a
[2:58] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[3:03] ways now go to 4:8 James
[3:07] 4:8 then we'll have a word of prayer if
[3:09] you have an unspoken need raise that to
[3:12] the Lord
[3:16] today now what you'll find church is
[3:18] that the words double-minded are only
[3:20] used two times in the entire Bible right
[3:23] here by James no one else uses them
[3:26] right they have different words like
[3:27] wavering and tossed and all these things
[3:29] but the only person who ever used them
[3:31] are James so we really need to look at
[3:32] the Book of James to understand this
[3:35] double-mindedness and I'll just say like
[3:36] this to begin with we all battle with
[3:38] this at
[3:39] times but again there's two degrees of
[3:42] It kind of like we've been looking at
[3:43] there's two degrees of
[3:45] backsliding right we looked at that a
[3:47] few weeks ago right there's minor and
[3:48] then there's major and I don't know if
[3:51] you caught it here but uh in this
[3:53] chapter here in this chapter James 4:8
[3:56] we see the major
[3:58] double-mindedness we in James 1 is the
[4:00] minor James 4 is the
[4:03] major all right because we all feel like
[4:05] I'm sure we've all felt since we've been
[4:07] a Christian we felt like everything was
[4:09] unstable in our lives how many could say
[4:10] Amen to that right I'm not ashamed to
[4:12] say that amen there's been times I felt
[4:14] unstable in my Christian Life I thought
[4:16] what's going on what what is happening
[4:18] what in the world's going on we've all
[4:20] felt that and so James lists he shows
[4:23] two groups these groups sometimes got to
[4:26] battle unstable feelings and then this
[4:29] group has the battle unstable all right
[4:32] so let's read this one two three draw
[4:34] nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you
[4:38] cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify
[4:41] your hearts ye
[4:43] double-minded uh if you have a need on
[4:45] the heart let's just make it known to
[4:46] God you can raise your hand or let's
[4:48] just bow our heads however you want to
[4:49] make your need uh known to the Lord
[4:51] father God we thank you for today bless
[4:53] your people Lord they've sang your songs
[4:54] Lord God they've come out to the house
[4:55] of God bless your people Lord God they
[4:57] made this great effort to be here I know
[4:59] some are back and sickness Lord we're
[5:01] probably all batt on tiredness Lord just
[5:02] from working uh these these uh seasons
[5:05] of a lot of work Lord God I know a lot
[5:08] of people have a lot on their plates so
[5:09] father God just use me today but by the
[5:12] sweetness of the Holy Spirit Lord God
[5:13] help me to get out of your way and may
[5:15] the Holy Spirit deal with each and every
[5:16] heart bless each and every heart guide
[5:18] them discern them help them strengthen
[5:20] them Lord God give them the portion of
[5:22] the Holy Spirit Lord that they have a
[5:24] need of for today give them their daily
[5:26] bread I pray Lord God in Jesus Christ's
[5:28] name I ask it amen God bless you as
[5:31] you're being seated praise
[5:36] God so like I told you for over a month
[5:39] you know the Lord's been dealing with me
[5:40] on the the double-mindedness and I took
[5:41] a picture of Simon's sermon when he
[5:43] mentioned it three years ago and it's
[5:45] just been waiting there in my photos app
[5:47] you know you every every few months I
[5:49] got to empty out all my pictures off my
[5:51] phone onto my home computer because I
[5:52] run out of space on my phone and uh I've
[5:55] just always left that one there brother
[5:57] Simon you know he was preaching and
[5:58] brother Steven was sitt sitting right
[5:59] there where brother Claude is how many
[6:01] remember brother Steven he married
[6:02] Elizabeth right they got a little baby
[6:04] girl now he sent us a picture and but
[6:06] brother Steven was sitting right there
[6:07] and I took a picture in the back right
[6:09] where sister Anna is sitting right there
[6:10] and for some reason the Simon had the
[6:12] scriptures up there and for some reason
[6:14] it struck me I believe it's for this
[6:15] time in season so uh you know God will
[6:18] vindicate his word hallelujah I believe
[6:19] God already has Vindicated it but maybe
[6:21] we just haven't seen it and I haven't
[6:22] seen it maybe like I I thought I had
[6:24] till right now so let's look at this
[6:26] here uh by God's grace
[6:29] so a double-minded man is unstable in
[6:32] all his ways and of course you can put a
[6:35] double-minded woman in there as well how
[6:36] many know that by God's grace Hallelujah
[6:39] like the Bible says you know we're Kings
[6:40] and Priests unto God it doesn't mention
[6:42] the female element right it doesn't say
[6:44] kings and queens it just says Kings un
[6:46] God but so we know that includes all
[6:48] females as well praise God because not
[6:50] only are men called to pray women are
[6:52] called to pray Allelujah so we we know
[6:55] that uh it's speaking of both and here
[6:57] it is as well so there's double-minded
[6:59] men
[7:00] and there's double-minded women and uh
[7:02] the Bible speaks that we should uh
[7:05] overcome this by the grace of God and it
[7:07] gives us the uh the way to do it
[7:10] Hallelujah I first want to read the
[7:12] definition there's a couple definitions
[7:13] of double-mindedness it means
[7:16] wavering so a wavering person is
[7:19] unstable in all their ways they waver
[7:22] another word is uncertain now how many
[7:24] know we got a battle uncertainty
[7:25] especially with this election coming up
[7:27] I thought about my should I stack up on
[7:29] uh
[7:30] uh dry food should I stock up on toilet
[7:32] paper like Co you know you know you just
[7:35] you go through all this un uncertainty
[7:37] right uh another word is doubting a
[7:41] doubting man or woman is unstable in all
[7:43] their
[7:44] ways another definition is divided and
[7:47] interest a person who has divided
[7:49] interests well I'm interested in the
[7:50] world I'm interested in God too a
[7:53] double-minded person is unstable in the
[7:55] rest of their lives okay every are of
[7:57] their life you another uh another
[8:00] concordance I looked at brother William
[8:02] said uh double-minded means two-spirited
[8:05] you got two Spirits
[8:08] right and uh it also means uh
[8:11] vacillating between opinion and purpose
[8:14] so you just Ro it's like a rotation well
[8:16] my purpose is this today for the world
[8:18] or you know money or popularity or lust
[8:20] but then I then I rotate back to
[8:24] God now how many already can tell you
[8:26] know we battle this almost every day
[8:28] right so what is this sermon on uh very
[8:30] familiar right very familiar topic it's
[8:32] on
[8:33] sanctification it's on the the greatest
[8:35] battle ever fought how many still figh
[8:37] in that fight you didn't give in this
[8:38] week did you all right some people come
[8:41] to church but they actually give in
[8:43] right thank God they come to church but
[8:44] they they've given in and the the Ser
[8:47] the services don't help them they don't
[8:49] worship God oh God help us to be true
[8:51] worshippers praise God help us to be
[8:53] Warriors that will fight the good fight
[8:54] of Faith anybody feel like fighting
[8:57] today Hallelujah yeah we got to fight
[8:59] the devil once to try to creep in our
[9:01] services right we've had testimonies
[9:02] about that where devil right while I'm
[9:04] preaching the devil's on somebody's
[9:05] shoulder telling them to do something
[9:07] and we they've had to come up for prayer
[9:08] we've had to cast that devil off amen
[9:10] hallelujah we've seen it by God's grace
[9:12] it's a
[9:13] reality uh brother Bram said it it's
[9:15] it's part of the battle this is the
[9:17] battle time right where the God's got
[9:19] trying to get his word God's trying to
[9:20] get his word to his people but the enemy
[9:22] is trying to distract you or make you
[9:23] think less of the preacher or make make
[9:25] you think less of your brother less of
[9:27] your husband less of your wife you know
[9:29] the enemy is trying to get you to think
[9:30] the wrong things but we got to think the
[9:32] right things Hallelujah we got to get
[9:34] the word of God on our minds amen you
[9:36] got to have the love of God remember the
[9:38] greatest thing we can have is Charity
[9:40] Above All Else the Bible said have
[9:42] fervent charity among yourselves
[9:45] Hallelujah so find a way you can love
[9:47] your brother your sister you know
[9:48] anybody in the church find a way to love
[9:50] them think of how Christ loved you
[9:52] that's how you can love them Hallelujah
[9:54] if Jesus loved me despite my failures
[9:56] well I can surely love somebody else
[9:58] Hallelujah cu only Jesus knows and I
[10:00] know how much I fail amen and if Jesus
[10:03] can love me despite my fails surely I
[10:05] can express that same love to other
[10:06] people listen who are created in the
[10:08] image of Jesus that's what the Bible
[10:11] says how can you say you love God whom
[10:13] you haven't seen But then uh not love
[10:15] somebody that he created Hallelujah
[10:17] that's that's the test amen if we can
[10:19] love others we can surely love God
[10:22] hallelujah so friends we're told here by
[10:25] the
[10:25] scripture uh we're not to rotate between
[10:28] purposes root rotate between interests
[10:31] rotate uh uh or waiver back and forth
[10:34] between purposes and ideas we're
[10:36] supposed to find the truth and stay with
[10:38] the truth hallelujah now if You' got
[10:40] your Bible here James 1 verse verse two
[10:43] James 1 verse
[10:45] two and did I yes I left my Bible in the
[10:49] office I thought I brought that up here
[10:51] oh I think I got
[10:52] it no I don't okay that's okay I don't
[10:56] use I don't I'll use my uh app
[11:04] here James 1 vers1 if you're there it's
[11:06] the greeting James a servant of God and
[11:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12
[11:10] tribes which are scattered abroad
[11:12] greeting so his letter is to Jewish
[11:14] Christians right but we know we know the
[11:17] gospel of the Jews and Gentiles it
[11:19] coincides perfectly right how many
[11:21] remember that the Bible said Paul was
[11:23] giving the ministry to the Gentiles and
[11:26] Peter was giving the ministry to the
[11:28] circumcision and what they met what they
[11:29] do they argue and fuss and debate no the
[11:31] Bible said they gave him the right hand
[11:32] of
[11:33] Fellowship amen right is that right
[11:36] church so we see this was written to the
[11:38] early Christians who were Jews they they
[11:40] were of course uh they were going to be
[11:42] tempted to get into legalism and
[11:43] circumcision saves you and you must keep
[11:46] all the all the laws of the Torah
[11:48] there's wisdom in the Torah right and
[11:50] and many of the the moral laws still
[11:52] pertain to the New Testament the holy
[11:54] spirit gives us understanding in that
[11:56] Hallelujah I've wrote on that
[11:58] extensively I've uh preached on that
[12:00] extensively we should have a good
[12:01] understanding of that by the grace of
[12:02] God if not then that's Sunday questions
[12:05] are about s Sunday night questions and
[12:06] answers that's what that's for amen
[12:08] bring those questions boy we sure had a
[12:10] lot last week amen verse two my brethren
[12:13] counted all joy everybody say all joy
[12:16] joy when you fall into diverse
[12:19] Temptations count it a joy wow God's
[12:22] allow me to be tested with my health or
[12:24] tested with my relationships he's
[12:26] allowed me to be tested with my finances
[12:28] praise the Lord am he must know that I
[12:30] can pass the test amen like job amen if
[12:34] he is allowing me to be tested well then
[12:35] I can be joyful praise God I'm going to
[12:38] come out better after this test is over
[12:40] Hallelujah he's going to refine me
[12:42] brother Mercy he's going to let me go
[12:44] through the fire remember brother Paul
[12:46] or brother Aaron Preacher Brother Aaron
[12:48] riddle preached on that the remember the
[12:49] the seven steps of the fiery process we
[12:52] go through there's seven steps we got to
[12:54] go through the fiery process but we're
[12:56] going to come out more pure on the other
[12:58] end praise God
[12:59] it's no fun going through the burning
[13:01] it's no fun going through the trials but
[13:03] Paul but James says count it all joy
[13:06] it's going to produce Joy once you get
[13:09] through it it's going to produce Joy
[13:10] you're going to see like William has in
[13:11] beatress over 40 years in the message
[13:13] you're going to see all the trials all
[13:15] the church splits all the arguing all
[13:17] the fussing for the real believer it
[13:19] makes them true to God and it gives them
[13:21] Joy it gives them a hope for heaven
[13:23] hallelujah amen you know I never got to
[13:26] YouTube I'm going to preach on YouTube
[13:27] tonight A a little bit way and nice way
[13:30] like I always do amen I got to preach
[13:32] against all of our sin you know but uh
[13:35] in other words the the point of the fear
[13:37] of the Lord we'll get to that the point
[13:39] is you should keep growing in wisdom
[13:41] until the Bible says you should have all
[13:44] wisdom Hallelujah and I got five
[13:47] scriptures to prove it so can't nobody
[13:49] tell me that we can't have all wisdom
[13:52] that's not good grammar but that's true
[13:54] amen you know so we we should be able to
[13:56] look at the life of beatric and William
[13:57] and other saints that serving God for
[13:59] years say wow they're walking in all the
[14:02] wisdom of God we should see it in their
[14:04] spiritual life their their the
[14:06] relationships their finances and the
[14:07] church
[14:08] said I mean either God's a liar or he's
[14:10] not amen he God's true amen he's not a
[14:13] liar amen if we believe God's word and
[14:15] we should be a look at our lives if
[14:17] we're growing in the fear of the Lord
[14:18] growing in wisdom we should see wisdom
[14:20] in every area of Our Lives
[14:22] amen what a
[14:23] stability where where they just we stay
[14:26] faithful to God true to God we're we're
[14:28] we're we're stable with with all with
[14:30] our battles right we're stable through
[14:31] our trials we're just stable serving God
[14:33] all the time through the good times
[14:35] through the dancing times through the
[14:36] morning times we're stable we love Jesus
[14:38] amen and nothing's going to make us
[14:39] waver
[14:41] Hallelujah that's what I tried to make
[14:43] my life just to be as stable in fact we
[14:45] had sister Wendy visited last night and
[14:46] she said well I just knew you guys were
[14:48] going to be at home you're at home all
[14:49] the time I took that as a compliment I
[14:51] said that's because we're stable amen
[14:54] you don't find us running off to this
[14:55] and that running all over there we got
[14:57] to post a duty amen
[15:00] like uh like like that story uh uh sir
[15:03] con sir Knight The Splendid way I got to
[15:05] stay at my little uh my little well in
[15:08] the story there there there's a
[15:09] wellkeeper and when he was young he W he
[15:12] was a soldier for the king and he wanted
[15:14] to go on some great adventures and the
[15:15] King said well uh here's a well that we
[15:18] don't have a a guy to guard it anymore
[15:21] and so he said well I'll guard it till
[15:22] somebody else comes along but The Story
[15:25] Goes The King never let anybody else
[15:26] come along the king had to be the only
[15:29] Keeper of the of the well for 40 years
[15:32] he kept the well and that's a type of a
[15:34] pastor right pastors don't get to go out
[15:36] on great adventures and missionary
[15:38] Ventures all these things they got to
[15:39] keep the well but the king said you
[15:41] don't know you keeping the well clean

[16:17] faith Works patience would you say
[16:19] brother Jesse my faith needs to be tried
[16:21] yes God is going to constantly try your
[16:23] faith that's why every week at school we
[16:25] have tests every week why to make sure
[16:27] you're learning so why does does God giv
[16:29] you tests almost every day every week to
[16:31] make sure you're
[16:32] learning right to make sure you're
[16:34] learning make sure you pass the test
[16:36] amen and then he rewards you at the end
[16:38] of it amen just like I try to reward my
[16:40] kids we give them little tickets and
[16:41] then they can buy you know prizes like
[16:43] they can buy treasure box or extra
[16:44] recess or something like that we try to

[16:53] faith needs constantly tried and
[16:56] tested but God won't give you a test you

[17:17] God in the trials amen just let him come
[17:19] on right like here's another one well
[17:22] praise God if we made it through the
[17:23] last one we'll make it through this one
[17:25] praise God in other words what am I
[17:26] saying don't complain that we go through
[17:28] trials all the time
[17:30] God trying to test you and he just told
[17:31] you count it all joy he just said let
[17:34] your trials be a joy to you like uh you
[17:37] know sometimes we might think when is
[17:39] this ever going to let up I got news for
[17:40] you it's not praise God I've been
[17:43] serving preaching here 18 years I've
[17:45] been a Christian for 24 years it's not
[17:46] going to let up we got to keep the
[17:48] battle we got to keep being strong
[17:50] praise God we got to keep overcoming let
[17:52] patience have her work let God create
[17:54] patience in your heart
[17:56] Hallelujah let it make you a pillar of
[17:58] the chur church let it make you a real
[18:00] pillar of Christianity let it make you a
[18:02] real example of being a Christian praise
[18:04] God others can fall away if they want
[18:06] others can compromise if they want but
[18:08] not me I'm going to be faithful to the
[18:10] word of God
[18:11] hallelujah I'm going to let patience
[18:13] work in my life I'm gonna give God
[18:16] praise Sundays when I don't feel like it
[18:18] Wednesdays when I don't feel like it I'm
[18:19] going to keep giving God praise because
[18:21] I know what the Bible says hallelujah
[18:24] God will bless us if we do that now
[18:26] here's where it applies to us I believe
[18:28] this portion in James 1 applies to you
[18:30] and I I'm going to say this James 4
[18:34] should not apply to you and I but some
[18:36] of us it might if we're not born again
[18:38] or we're not serving God with all of our
[18:39] hearts that's I'm going to say that
[18:41] plainly James 1 should be you and I real
[18:44] Believers real Christians that are
[18:46] dedicated love Christ want to serve
[18:48] Jesus Christ want to go in the Rapture
[18:50] they want to miss a tribulation James 1
[18:52] should apply to you and I amen that's
[18:53] right that's right James four is a
[18:56] double-mindedness that will apply to the
[18:59] makeb believer or the foolish virgin
[19:01] that's my humble
[19:02] opinion right and just like I I preach
[19:05] this I have a note I want to read
[19:06] here who remembers when I preach that
[19:09] there's two kinds of backsliding who
[19:10] remembers that but said we backslide
[19:13] daily that means we turn up we turn our
[19:15] thoughts away from
[19:16] God but we don't backslide like well
[19:18] today I'm going to love people tomorrow
[19:19] I'm going to murder somebody that's
[19:21] that's that's the wrong kind of
[19:22] backsliding right or today I love my
[19:24] wife and tomorrow I'm going to do evil
[19:26] or today I love my husband but tomorrow
[19:27] I'm going to do evil to my husb husband
[19:29] you know that's that's wrong that that's
[19:31] the wrong kind of backsliding that's the
[19:33] backsliding if there's no power of God
[19:34] in a person's
[19:36] life right and remember who who remember
[19:38] when I preached the secret sins there's
[19:40] two kinds of secret sins there are
[19:42] secret sins that are awful like achin
[19:44] and like these preachers this another
[19:45] preacher 73 year old preacher this week
[19:47] he's a worldwide known preacher he's 73
[19:49] and he got caught in a fair
[19:51] 73 and everybody thought he was the this
[19:53] wonderful man I we saw people they were
[19:56] crying oh he's my favorite preacher he's
[19:57] a Baptist preacher he was so Stern
[19:59] against everybody all these things
[20:02] 73 Men we better take up our cross daily
[20:05] and follow God Amen what am I talking
[20:07] about all these Temptations you're going
[20:09] to battle it till they put you your body
[20:11] in the grave amen they're going to
[20:13] battle it till we get our body Chang and
[20:14] death is swallowed up in life amen what
[20:17] a warning Hallelujah no matter how much
[20:20] you how and how well you can preach and
[20:22] no matter what you're gift in your life
[20:23] you got to keep your heart pure
[20:25] Hallelujah the purity of Christ
[20:27] Hallelujah
[20:28] see the more power the more influence
[20:31] right time goes on Satan know knows how
[20:33] to work on people but God knows how to
[20:35] deliver us amen God knows how to give us
[20:37] a way of Escape in every trial amen
[20:40] hallelujah God can help our teenagers
[20:41] Escape right there in the high school
[20:43] can he Hallelujah God can help the
[20:44] preachers escape the musicians amen our
[20:47] brothers and sisters God helps every one
[20:49] of us Escape if we really want to escape
[20:52] Hallelujah remember even King AB amik
[20:55] said Lord he said Lord you know the
[20:56] Integrity of my heart I don't want to
[20:58] take Sarah if she's not if she's already
[21:00] married and God kept him from if you
[21:03] want to be kept from sin God will keep
[21:05] you from
[21:06] sin Hallelujah if you really don't want
[21:09] to sin God will help you not to sin
[21:12] Hallelujah so it comes down to real
[21:16] sincerity Hallelujah so I showed you
[21:18] there's two kind and then there's a
[21:19] secret sin like uh David you know well
[21:22] David David said Lord forgive even my
[21:24] presumptuous sins even the sins I didn't
[21:26] even know I was going to be tempted by
[21:27] right
[21:29] and that that's what we have you know we
[21:30] have secret sin like I've said you I if
[21:33] I'm going to sin I don't want the people
[21:35] to see it I don't want anybody to see it
[21:36] I just want to be be between God and I
[21:39] that would never cause a stumbling block
[21:41] and say oh see I knew this preacher I
[21:43] knew Christianity is nothing like that I
[21:44] don't want to ever bring any reproach
[21:46] upon Christ
[21:47] Hallelujah that's that's what that's
[21:49] just my humble little Revelation that I
[21:51] would when I battle sin I I battle it
[21:53] daily but but may God help my sin to be
[21:55] so secret that people can't even see
[21:57] that I'm struggling
[21:59] right but I'll keep bowing I'll keep
[22:01] overcoming I'll keep praising God I'll
[22:03] keep letting patience have her perfect
[22:05] work amen hallelujah till the victory
[22:09] comes verse five now here's what you and
[22:11] I need if any of you lack wisdom let him
[22:15] ask of God that given that giveth to all
[22:18] men liberally and upth not and it shall
[22:20] be given to him what is he talking about
[22:22] he's talking about you and I going
[22:23] through trials and when we go through
[22:24] trials we feel like we don't know what
[22:26] to do so what do you need to do do ask
[22:29] God for
[22:30] wisdom Hallelujah remember we're getting
[22:33] this whole context is getting down to
[22:34] verse eight the double-minded man he's
[22:36] talking about Believers sometimes
[22:38] Believers even honest Believers like you
[22:40] and I can be unstable in all of our
[22:43] ways he hasn't rebuked anybody yet has
[22:46] he no you're going to see that in
[22:48] chapter four he starts rebuking people
[22:49] this might be a three-part series I can
[22:50] tell already I'm not making anything
[22:52] anything through here I thought this
[22:54] would be a short sermon man but see he's
[22:57] saying so when we go through trials of
[22:59] our patience and and we feel like oh God
[23:02] how much more can I take God how could
[23:04] you allow this to happen he said that's
[23:06] the moment you got to ask God for
[23:09] wisdom hallelujah amen give me wisdom my
[23:12] faith is being my patience is being
[23:14] tested I don't know how much more I can
[23:16] endure so God I need your
[23:20] wisdom so ask of God so when you're
[23:23] going through a tough time what do you
[23:24] got to do pray got to talk to
[23:26] God Church said
[23:29] uh is this so is it is it difficult is
[23:31] the Christianity really that difficult
[23:33] not really they asked brother Bram
[23:35] brother Bram how do we get closer to God
[23:37] he said read your Bible and
[23:40] pray yeah is that is that so mysterious
[23:43] no I mean just you you seek God first
[23:45] you get hungry for God you love God you
[23:47] praise God you draw nigh to God so he'll
[23:49] draw nigh to you praise God Amen but
[23:53] then why do we fight that so much
[23:54] because the devil is fighting on every
[23:56] hand he's trying to discourage us right
[23:59] he's trying to defeat us but you are
[24:01] more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus
[24:04] praise God you're more than a conqueror
[24:09] Hallelujah all right everybody see that
[24:11] now everybody doing good okay all right
[24:14] so look at the context it's to Believers
[24:16] the 12 tribes the Christians that are
[24:18] still Israelis but they're Christians
[24:21] verse six but let him ask in faith
[24:24] nothing wavering so that's why when you
[24:26] come up for Prayer church sometimes I
[24:27] think I've wish now you go back to your
[24:29] seat and you just start praising God
[24:31] make sure whatever we prayed for you go
[24:33] water that confession with
[24:35] praise right you got to make sure you
[24:37] don't lose it by the time we pray and
[24:39] the time you get back to your seat you
[24:41] sit out and you're like ah may maybe God
[24:43] didn't hear my
[24:45] prayer no you gotta you got to just walk
[24:47] back there and say praise God God heard
[24:49] me amen amen and I'm gonna wait on God
[24:52] God's going to give me the wisdom that I
[24:53] need praise
[24:56] God right nothing wavering for he that
[25:00] wavereth is like the wave of the sea
[25:02] driven with the wind and tossed that's
[25:05] how we just hate to feel that don't we
[25:07] we feel like this circumstance will
[25:08] drive me to feeling like this I'm like
[25:10] oh I don't want to feel this again and
[25:11] then something else will drive me over
[25:12] here and now I feel this and now that we
[25:15] just want to be stable in our
[25:17] lives it's so difficult to be tossed
[25:20] from this emotion over to that fear and
[25:22] doubt and worry and anger and Stress and
[25:26] Anxiety we just get F all around and God
[25:29] said put your anchor in Jesus Christ
[25:32] amen ask for wisdom and and don't doubt
[25:35] God's going to hear your prayer
[25:40] amen let's not be like a wave of the sea
[25:44] let's be a like a ship that's got an
[25:45] anchor to it praise
[25:48] God verse seven for let not that man or
[25:52] woman think that he or she shall receive
[25:54] anything of the Lord so get the so do
[25:57] you see the context you're going through
[25:59] a trial your faith is being tested you
[26:02] feel like you don't have enough patience
[26:04] and the Bible says you better pray and
[26:06] ask God for wisdom and believe it or
[26:08] God's not going to hear you go God's not
[26:10] going to hear your prayer unless you
[26:11] have real Faith right you're going to
[26:13] continue to be tossed from anxiety to
[26:15] frustration to temptation to lust right
[26:18] to anger to bitterness to fear to comp
[26:21] you're just complex the complex toss all
[26:23] around but you got to say God I believe
[26:25] your word you're going to give me wisdom
[26:27] I'm trusting in God amen amen he will
[26:30] never fail wellow we could probably s
[26:32] that with a little more Gusto after this
[26:34] Hallelujah he will never fail me because
[26:37] I trust in God
[26:39] Amen
[26:41] Hallelujah then now we get to verse
[26:43] eight now now we see the context brother
[26:45] Jose don't we verse eight a
[26:47] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[26:50] ways that's right this is where we'll
[26:53] feel unstable uh my my my marriage feels
[26:56] unstable or my parenting feels unstable
[26:58] stable my job feels unstable my finances
[27:00] feel unstable my health is unstable my
[27:04] Direction with God my walk with God my
[27:06] my future feels unstable when we don't
[27:09] have the wisdom of God everything seems
[27:11] unstable but the Bible tells us ask God
[27:13] believe don't doubt and God will give
[27:16] you stability praise
[27:18] God
[27:20] hallelujah and has he rebuked anybody
[27:22] yet for any sin no this is for the
[27:25] believer this is for you and I this is
[27:28] for our greatest battle that we've ever
[27:30] fought
[27:32] Hallelujah is that
[27:34] true now I put up verse n you'll see now
[27:37] he switches into another thought verse n
[27:40] let the brother of low degree rejoice in
[27:42] that he is exalted okay go to verse
[27:45] 10 but the rich in that he has made low
[27:48] okay so he's now here now he's talking
[27:49] about the different types of the people
[27:50] in the church there's there's humble
[27:52] people right there's people that you
[27:54] know we're just you know wondering well
[27:56] they've only been to church a little
[27:57] while where do they stay with God but
[27:59] then there's poor people in the church
[28:00] there's rich people there's highly
[28:01] esteemed
[28:02] people so he starts off the letter by
[28:04] saying this you got to have a revelation
[28:06] of the wisdom of God for your life or
[28:08] else you'll be tossed all over the seas
[28:10] of life amen oh thank God there's an
[28:13] anchor in Jesus Christ today
[28:17] Hallelujah see and then he talks about
[28:20] even your uh uh yeah even of your riches
[28:22] or your life it's just like grass that
[28:24] Fades hallah the girls pick some of
[28:27] those uh some of those berries over at
[28:30] uh uh the East Liberty Park and uh I
[28:34] they they hit all the berries off and
[28:36] and uh I I I took the branches out of
[28:38] our van I threw them down there I come
[28:40] here to today to church there they are
[28:41] they're all withered away within one day
[28:43] the the Cur the day before they're
[28:45] beautiful green bright today they're all
[28:47] faded away that's what the Bible says
[28:50] that's what it's like riches you can't
[28:52] trust in riches Hallelujah can't trust
[28:55] in your your youth right you're gonna
[28:57] get old
[28:59] Hallelujah you can't trust in anything
[29:01] there all you can do is trust in the
[29:02] word of God
[29:03] hallelujah for the word of God shall not
[29:06] pass away
[29:08] Hallelujah Heaven and Earth shall pass
[29:10] away but my word shall never pass away
[29:13] hallelujah amen two kinds of
[29:16] double-mindedness this is the kind that
[29:18] we battle well is god with me or not is
[29:20] God going to help me through this trial
[29:22] or not right am I going to make it
[29:24] through this year or not right that
[29:26] that's what we wonder God
[29:28] how am I going to get through this will
[29:29] I get through this is how's it possible
[29:33] that I'll overcome this with God all
[29:35] things are possible Amen to Believers
[29:39] praise God so ask God for wisdom and
[29:43] then claim it can I say like that this
[29:46] is one time Glory I know this amen this
[29:48] is one time you can claim this promise
[29:52] right for healing you don't always know
[29:53] if God's going to heal you for people
[29:55] dying you don't always know if God's
[29:56] going to heal you but this one you know
[29:58] the perfect will of God is to give you
[29:59] wisdom Hallelujah because it says right
[30:02] there if you doubt you're not going to
[30:04] get the wisdom but see that that's why I
[30:07] love you know when people come up for
[30:08] prayer over the years I pray for them uh
[30:10] they they've prayed for the peace of God
[30:11] in their minds and I've told them this
[30:13] is the perfect will of God for you to
[30:14] have peace in your heart you don't have
[30:16] to wonder does God want me to waver does
[30:18] God want me to be uncertain does God
[30:20] want me to be doubtful the answer is
[30:22] no yes God's going to let let you go
[30:25] through trials you're going to be tested
[30:26] it's going to be difficult but wants you
[30:28] to have wisdom in the midst of the trial
[30:30] hallelujah it's the will of God
[30:33] hallelujah amen I hope the holy spirit
[30:36] is dealing with somebody today by God's
[30:38] grace now uh go to chapter 4 verse
[30:42] one now let's look at the context of the
[30:44] second time
[30:46] James teaches on the double-minded man
[30:49] or
[30:50] woman because we can surely relate to
[30:53] the double mindedness of well I'm going
[30:54] through a trial I feel tossed all around
[30:57] but I'm still
[30:58] believer this is the one I hope we don't
[31:01] experience so much if we do like I said
[31:04] like I'll just say like this if we do
[31:05] with these things it's time to check up
[31:07] and make sure you're born again
[31:10] Hallelujah because even Paul in
[31:11] Galatians 2 or three Paul even doubted
[31:14] the Galatians were born again when they
[31:15] let circumcision back in the church he
[31:18] said I might have to come and uh uh work
[31:20] with you till you're reborn he says to
[31:23] make sure you got the birth because how
[31:26] could you be born again and allow
[31:28] something like this sometimes church is
[31:29] good for a
[31:30] checkup I got to go to the doctor every
[31:32] year for a checkup I'm actually starting
[31:34] to like it now because my numbers keep
[31:36] getting better by God's
[31:38] grace I'm actually liking it now it's a
[31:40] good time for a checkup and this is a
[31:42] good checkup for us right here with a
[31:45] double-mindedness for whence come Wars
[31:47] and fightings among who you the church
[31:51] the 12 tribes God's people what there's
[31:56] Wars amongst God's people sometimes
[31:58] there are I've been through a few have
[32:01] you ever been through
[32:04] some I got to laugh there I got a couple
[32:07] laughs there yeah they've seen him over
[32:08] the years so many wars right thank God
[32:12] that's why I was saying thank God for
[32:13] the seasons of Peace amen I didn't know
[32:15] what I was saying when I said that now I
[32:17] know what I'm saying hallelujah right
[32:20] that's why ASA he got those battles and
[32:22] God gave him 10 years a peace oh what a
[32:25] blessing Hallelujah
[32:27] but where do Wars and fightings come
[32:29] among you Christians message
[32:32] Believers come they not hence even of
[32:35] your what lust every war is a lust is is
[32:40] lust uh
[32:42] originated it stems from lust every
[32:46] fight among Christians is a a fight
[32:48] about
[32:49] lusts because if you had the love of God
[32:52] you wouldn't fight about it and the
[32:54] church said some of you already said
[32:56] amen you got to say Amen twice
[32:58] got the double
[33:00] amen even the lust that war in your
[33:03] members see so it's that sin nature
[33:06] inside of people they just want to go
[33:08] fight against that person they want to
[33:09] war they want to start a war against
[33:11] that person what is it it starts from
[33:13] the lust inside of
[33:14] them remember the Bible said in
[33:18] Proverbs Strife only comes from Pride
[33:21] how many remember that let's can you
[33:23] pull that up there CA uh bless your
[33:26] heart your hold Z and a you've been a
[33:28] real Warrior this weekend honey well
[33:30] every weekend
[33:36] Strife Pride I've heard yeah
[33:49] uh I think it's only by Pride
[33:53] only pardon me thank you for pay yes
[33:55] Proverbs 13:10 sorry only only by Pride
[33:58] cometh contention I was saying Strife
[34:00] it's the same word but it won't pull up
[34:02] unless you got the exact word only by
[34:04] Pride cometh contention but with the
[34:06] well advised is what
[34:10] wisdom so James he you know he preaches
[34:13] uh he writes chapters 1 2 3 chapter four
[34:15] he says where do Wars and stries come
[34:18] from among the Believers from the lust
[34:20] inside of them so see that's how you
[34:23] know when you ever get a feeling like
[34:25] I'm really against that brother I'm
[34:27] really against that that sister I got to
[34:28] straighten them out I'm talking about
[34:29] with the wrong
[34:30] attitude right you know pride has
[34:34] overtaken your life and the church said
[34:37] because the only reason contention will
[34:39] come and William and be have seen this
[34:41] over the years right I've seen over the
[34:42] years the only way that contention can
[34:44] come is if somebody gets prideful and
[34:45] they want to argue and fight about
[34:48] something right so what kind of people
[34:50] should we be as Christians should we be
[34:53] Fighters against each other no we should
[34:55] fight the devil let's save our fighting
[34:57] from the devil Hallelujah and the church
[34:59] said oh my it's beautiful oh the
[35:02] revelation of the word of God verse uh
[35:04] let's go back to James 4 verse two like
[35:07] I said this one's been hanging on the
[35:07] shelf for about over a month just
[35:09] waiting to preach about I'm just waiting
[35:11] for God's you know little push he kind
[35:12] of pushes me along and he'll give me a
[35:13] little piece there like I was telling
[35:14] brother Austin he gives me like a piece
[35:16] for the puzzle there another piece oh
[35:17] pretty soon I see oh they fit right
[35:19] there all
[35:20] right amen now I can see God's picture
[35:22] amen hallelujah verse two James 4:2 ye
[35:27] love and have not so people lust they
[35:30] don't get what they want so they start a
[35:33] war everybody see that so Wars in
[35:37] churches uh fightings in churches come
[35:40] because people don't get what they
[35:42] want so they start a war now what is it
[35:45] mostly most of the time it's preachers
[35:47] who want
[35:49] money I'm not surprised I didn't hear
[35:51] any many amens but that's the
[35:54] truth most of the time it's preachers
[35:56] who want money
[35:58] right because that's that's us that's
[35:59] how the church is run they got to have
[36:00] ties and offerings to run the church
[36:02] right other times it's for power or
[36:06] influence right hallelujah it's a lust
[36:10] that people
[36:11] have they lust but they don't get what
[36:14] they want so they start a war in the
[36:15] church and desire to have and cannot
[36:18] obtain they can't get what they want ye
[36:21] fight in war yet ye have not because ye
[36:23] ask not so here's James this this
[36:26] applies so much to our prayers right
[36:29] sometimes we sometimes we don't get
[36:31] things we want because we don't pray
[36:32] enough about
[36:33] it
[36:36] Hallelujah like you know someone come up
[36:38] for prayer but I might ask you know well
[36:39] have you prayed about it yet well if the
[36:41] answer is no well you gota really need
[36:43] to pray about it right sometimes the
[36:45] reason we don't have things is because
[36:47] we don't pray about it enough and church
[36:50] I'm not I'm not I'm not talking about
[36:51] you know it's it's it's it's it's it's
[36:53] the minute before bed brother William
[36:54] you're like Lord help me Lord I love you
[36:56] Jesus I'm going to bed could you do this
[36:58] amen you're sleeping that's that's not
[37:01] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[37:02] seeking God for it I'm talking about
[37:06] you're really seeking God maybe you're
[37:07] going to spend half an hour I remember
[37:09] that one time John gram and I at this
[37:11] altar but is over in w we prayed for 45
[37:13] minutes after church for miracles and
[37:15] then God that next year started giving
[37:16] us Mira it was 2009 2010 my wife got
[37:19] healed of the migraines and the Miracles
[37:21] just kept pouring out for 45 minutes we
[37:23] prayed there not four seconds not four
[37:26] or five seconds 45 minutes everybody
[37:29] with
[37:30] me see people they want things they
[37:33] don't get they want because they
[37:34] probably haven't prayed about it enough
[37:37] Hallelujah am I making sense everybody
[37:40] yes all right everybody still with me
[37:42] did I lose anybody you're thinking about
[37:43] things over there things over there did
[37:45] I lose
[37:48] anybody verse three uh ye ask and
[37:51] receive not because you ask a miss that
[37:53] you may consume it upon your lust so now
[37:54] he gives us the other the other thing is
[37:57] one problem is you don't ask about it
[37:59] the other way is you ask based upon your
[38:01] lust so God's not going to give you
[38:03] that because you want it for the wrong
[38:06] reasons
[38:08] right it's something they want that they
[38:11] shouldn't want so God doesn't answer
[38:13] their prayer
[38:15] Hallelujah like that one time I told you
[38:17] the brother said I claim this woman is
[38:19] going to be my wife what he was asking
[38:20] upon is lust and she got married to
[38:22] somebody else he told me and he told uh
[38:25] somebody else he said I claim that woman
[38:26] she's going to be mind well you asked
[38:28] upon your
[38:30] lusts you can't claim nothing unless God
[38:32] told you to claim
[38:34] it right now he's happily married with
[38:36] another woman right so just he was
[38:38] asking upon his lust and not asking to
[38:40] the will of
[38:43] God all right now here's now here's what
[38:46] we're now look at verse four so this
[38:48] church this tells you the context verse
[38:50] four ye
[38:53] adulterers and
[38:55] adulteresses and he's writing to people
[38:57] people that are in the church so chapter
[38:59] one is to the people that were
[39:00] Christians but they're just battling you
[39:02] know in their mind they're battling
[39:03] double mindness in their mind but
[39:04] chapter four is these people actually
[39:06] committed we'd say adultery natural or
[39:11] spiritual right because he calls him you
[39:13] are adulterers and
[39:17] adulteresses Hallelujah know ye not that
[39:21] friendship with the world is hatred or
[39:23] enemity from God With
[39:25] God these people were spiritual
[39:28] adulterers with the world right they
[39:31] they had these lust that they wanted
[39:32] well no doubt God didn't answer their
[39:34] prayer God's trying to keep them from
[39:36] sin Hallelujah he's trying to keep them
[39:38] from scars and pains in their life
[39:40] amen right and this is this is probably
[39:44] natural adultery as well because what
[39:46] did the Corinthian Church have they had
[39:47] a brother in fornication sleeping with
[39:49] the
[39:50] stepmother and that was the Church of
[39:52] God
[39:54] hallelujah so see there you know there's
[39:56] all kinds of churches
[39:57] thank God that you know I know mess of
[39:59] churches that have had they struggle
[40:00] with sexual
[40:02] sin that doesn't mean they're not true
[40:04] churches it means they're immature
[40:07] church just like the Corinthian Church
[40:10] and the church
[40:11] said if you're still struggling with
[40:13] sexual sin or if you're struggling with
[40:15] uh suing your brother like the
[40:16] Corinthian Church you are an immature
[40:18] church amen that's right but if you can
[40:20] handle the Deep things of God then
[40:22] you're an Ephesian church amen
[40:26] hallelujah glory to God any Smiles out
[40:29] there and anybody got a
[40:31] smile thank you Lord amen thank you for
[40:34] your mercy
[40:37] amen he said don't you know that
[40:39] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[40:40] the world is the enemy of God he's
[40:42] telling the church this you can't commit
[40:44] adultery and do these things and be a
[40:46] friend of God you're an enemy of
[40:50] God why cuz you're fighting amongst each
[40:52] other right fighting over husbands and
[40:54] wives right cuz there's fightings and
[40:55] wars and adultery was one of them
[40:57] wow it just struck me right
[40:59] there brother Bram said brother brother
[41:02] William Brother Bram said this and I've
[41:03] heard other pre Preachers say it too in
[41:05] those Pentecostal moves they'd have
[41:07] weekends where the husbands and wives
[41:09] would all come to a service and they put
[41:11] their keys the men would put their keys
[41:12] in there and a different woman would
[41:14] take that key and go home with a
[41:16] different man for the weekend in
[41:17] Pentecostal
[41:19] circles brother R said he said I can't I
[41:23] I'd have to go look for the tape or the
[41:24] quote uh but brother brother R said you
[41:27] wouldn't believe the adulteries I've had
[41:29] to work with with preachers and their
[41:30] wives he said I'm not talking uh uh
[41:33] Lutheran he said
[41:37] Pentecostal
[41:39] right he's talking to the church
[41:41] following the message of the hour and
[41:43] they're struggling with fights and Wars
[41:45] among them some of them are adulterers
[41:47] in the church sleeping around well truly
[41:50] they're not born
[41:51] again right but they they know the TRU
[41:53] they know a little bit about the truth
[41:55] but what's happened they've got lust
[41:56] that they haven't overcome oh God help
[41:58] us to crucify to mortify the lust of the
[42:01] eyes in the flesh Hallelujah like I said

[42:37] jealous if the spirit of God saved you
[42:39] from your sin forgave you all your sin
[42:41] then the spirit of God wants all your
[42:43] love
[42:44] Hallelujah if God's spirit showed you
[42:46] love and saved you out of your life of
[42:48] sin God's spirit don't want you go

[47:30] Temptation Jesus had to resist three
[47:32] times right brother William three times
[47:34] he had to say it's written he didn't use
[47:36] a miracle he didn't use a prophecy he
[47:39] just used the written word amen amen and
[47:41] that's how we can defeat the Devil every
[47:43] time just use the written word the Bible
[47:45] says this the Bible says that the Bible
[47:48] says that I'm obeying the Bible
[47:51] Hallelujah that's simple
[47:58] okay so we know how to overcome this
[47:59] brother Jesse
[48:00] yes repent of your sins right submit
[48:03] yourselves to God obey the word of God
[48:06] you have to resist Satan and then Satan
[48:08] will flee from
[48:10] you hallelujah how many appreciate the
[48:12] good news that you won't battle that
[48:13] mind battle
[48:15] forever H how many believe in Seasons
[48:18] where you go through seasons and you you
[48:20] won't always being a tough season I can
[48:22] say Amen to that trials and tests I've
[48:25] gone
[48:25] through they don't last forever troubles
[48:27] don't last always that's a good song we
[48:29] need to sing that troubles don't last oh
[48:32] troubles don't last always oh it's a
[48:35] good it's a good gospel song you got to
[48:37] pull it up on YouTube Hallelujah verse
[48:40] eight draw not to God so see you got to
[48:42] obey God's word you got to resist Satan
[48:45] and you got to spend time with God
[48:47] hallelujah draw night to God now he's
[48:49] remember he's talking to adulterers
[48:50] people that would sleep around the
[48:52] church draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh
[48:55] to you cleanse your your hands ye sinner
[48:57] he calls them
[48:58] Sinners he but in verse one he said
[49:01] there's Wars among you so see there's
[49:03] Christians that are really into sin in
[49:05] the
[49:06] church they have wars among them there's
[49:09] fightings among them there's adultery
[49:11] sexual sin among them right they're
[49:13] fighting at one another and he says
[49:15] resist right draw not to God you sinners
[49:19] in other words we we sinned and we got
[49:22] to confess our sins we got to show God
[49:25] that we're really sorry for what we we
[49:27] did that's called thorough repentance
[49:29] brother Bram calls
[49:32] it and purify your hearts ye what sound
[49:37] like a familiar sermon I heard one
[49:40] time so clean your hands don't touch
[49:43] those things anymore don't don't tap on
[49:45] those things anymore don't touch that
[49:47] person anymore and the church said
[49:50] cleanse your hands purify your hearts
[49:54] God help me to think the right thoughts
[49:58] do you remember there's three evidences
[50:01] of true repentance you remember that
[50:02] it's in the it's in the uh Greek let's
[50:05] see if I can remember you have to change
[50:06] your mind about your sin yes you have to
[50:09] abhor your sin and you have to make
[50:12] amends for your
[50:13] sin right so there's three things if you
[50:16] really want to repent you got to change
[50:18] your mind I'm not I don't think that
[50:19] anymore about that I don't I don't no I
[50:21] I disagree with those thoughts I now I
[50:23] think God's
[50:25] thoughts and you got I hate that I hate
[50:27] when I fall in that sin I hate that sin
[50:31] I hate it and then third I'll make up
[50:33] for it I'm going to draw an ey to God or
[50:36] if it's against a person I'm gonna go
[50:37] love that person I'm GNA say something
[50:39] nice about that person even though that
[50:40] person says something bad about me right
[50:43] that's real
[50:45] Christianity how many agree with
[50:49] that verse 9 see what I feel like church
[50:52] we just need more preaching of the
[50:54] word right the the go preacher they they
[50:57] it's all quotes all the time but what we
[50:59] need is a fresh balance we got to have
[51:01] quotes from brother brandom and we got
[51:02] to have the word right because brother
[51:05] Ram God's Prophet points us to the word
[51:07] of God
[51:09] hallelujah he said look in the Bible he
[51:11] said if there's a mistake on the quotes
[51:13] look in the Bible those four beautiful
[51:16] words glory to God Amen questions answer
[51:18] is part one 64 I think it is look in the
[51:22] Bible so oh now now we see double-minded
[51:25] okay so now we see double minded in a
[51:27] new way it's people that are making wars
[51:29] in the church fights in the church and
[51:31] adulteries in the church sexual sin in
[51:33] the
[51:34] church those are double-minded now the
[51:36] church that's a totally different
[51:37] double-mindedness than chapter one
[51:40] chapter one is you're going through
[51:41] trials oh God how am I going to make it
[51:43] through this financial trial how am I
[51:44] going to make it here and God said don't
[51:46] be double-minded just ask for wisdom
[51:48] I'll give it to you praise God that's
[51:50] one type of
[51:51] double-mindedness the other one is Mercy
[51:53] you are so double-minded you can say you
[51:55] love God and then go sleep with another
[51:57] man's wife or sleep with another woman's
[51:59] husband you call yourself a Christian
[52:01] repent purify your heart you
[52:05] sinner the Bible uses name calling so
[52:07] I'm going to use name calling you know
[52:09] you sinner right
[52:11] sinner right there's among you it's
[52:14] among the people of
[52:16] God just like the Corinthian Church and
[52:19] Paul said you didn't even mourn over it
[52:21] that this man everybody knew about this
[52:23] young man sleeping with his stepmom and
[52:24] nobody even mourned about no one was at
[52:26] the alter saying God forgive that
[52:27] brother for a sexual sin oh it's awful
[52:29] it's so sad to be in the church nobody
[52:31] was doing that praise
[52:33] God so Paul said get that brother get
[52:35] him out of the church
[52:37] amen give him over to the devil for the
[52:40] destruction of the flesh that his Spirit
[52:42] might be
[52:43] saved
[52:46] Hallelujah see church when we see sin
[52:48] amongst ourselves what we got to do we
[52:49] got to pray at the altar for people that
[52:51] sin against us in the church and the
[52:54] church said
[52:56] make sure I got a good Amen on that
[52:58] one verse eight verse n be afflicted and
[53:01] mourn and weep see they weren't weeping
[53:03] over the sexual sin
[53:06] adultery let your laughter be turned to
[53:08] mourning so see it's like that in every
[53:11] church every church has to be tested
[53:14] every church has to go through Wars
[53:15] fightings adulteries all just any type
[53:18] of sin and these people are far from God
[53:21] and God said confess your sin then come
[53:23] near to me praise God the ones that are
[53:25] near to God should be the the ones who
[53:26] mourn over sin I'm looking at everybody
[53:28] here because we all want to say we're
[53:30] near to God well then you should be the
[53:31] ones mourning over
[53:33] sin because you're the one that's close
[53:35] to God's heart you're a person you're a
[53:37] Believer after the heart of Christ so
[53:40] where's your mourning everyone
[53:42] understand what I'm
[53:44] saying let your laughter be turned to
[53:47] mourning and your joy to heaviness see
[53:49] there's a time when there's a heaviness
[53:50] on the church right there's a time when
[53:51] there's a joy in the
[53:53] church Victoria was just asking me Daddy
[53:56] uh if you're going to dance can you let
[53:58] me know so uh if if we if if if we dance
[54:01] she's going to miss out on the dancing
[54:02] because she can't crawl around Lydia you
[54:04] know around the organ I said I'll let
[54:05] you know when we dance well you can
[54:07] dance anytime you want but I thought
[54:08] that was really precious where she
[54:12] she I said well I'll let you know next
[54:14] time I was just about thinking about
[54:15] dancing last Sunday I almost danced last
[54:16] Sunday we were singing reason the praise
[54:18] I almost s there she is hallelujah see
[54:21] but you know you you can feel it I can
[54:23] feel it we can all feel it when there's
[54:24] heaviness on the church CU of sin
[54:28] we can also feel where there's Victory
[54:30] Hallelujah joy
[54:32] peace
[54:35] Unity so what's the recommendation in
[54:38] verse 10 humble yourselves in the sight
[54:41] of the
[54:43] Lord and He Shall lift you up so see
[54:45] people that are in sin they're so low
[54:48] they're so I just dramatize they're so
[54:49] low they're so far from
[54:51] God but it takes humility and then God
[54:54] will bring you back into his presence
[54:55] where you feel like like oh now I'm now
[54:57] I'm getting something out of the word
[54:59] now I feel close to God now I'm loving
[55:01] God's word now I can get now can I I can
[55:03] have joy in my life even if I'm going
[55:04] through a trial I can have joy at
[55:07] church but if not see where our sin
[55:09] takes us our sin takes us to this place
[55:11] we see we feel far away from God there's
[55:13] no joy in it
[55:15] anymore right there's mourning uh
[55:17] there's heaviness all these things but
[55:19] the Bible said draw night to God he'll
[55:21] bring you back into his presence
[55:24] hallelujah hallelujah
[55:27] so see a double-minded person in this
[55:29] chapter has dirty hands and a dirty
[55:33] heart because he said purify your hands
[55:35] you Sinners purify your hearts you
[55:40] double-minded can everybody see this now
[55:42] there's two types of double-mindedness
[55:44] just like there's two types of
[55:45] backsliding just like there's two types
[55:47] of secret sins why because you got four
[55:49] types of of
[55:50] Believers so the wise and foolish right
[55:53] and you got the make believer they hang
[55:54] around as to unbelievers never hang
[55:56] around us they won't even come to church
[55:58] that's why said we got three kinds of
[56:00] Believers in every in every Gathering
[56:03] almost H do you but see James 1 is for
[56:07] the wise virgin where you're not you're
[56:09] not you're not adulterous you're not
[56:11] starting Wars and fights among you
[56:13] you're just struggling God I need I need
[56:16] faith for this trial I need wisdom in my
[56:19] life right now and I don't want to
[56:22] waver I don't want to be tossed back and
[56:25] forth well I know what I'm doing well no
[56:27] I don't feel like I know what I'm doing
[56:28] now I want to be stable on the will of
[56:31] God
[56:33] hallelujah now chapter four is something
[56:36] else they're living in adultery there
[56:38] are wars in the church there's fights in
[56:39] the church and he said you better purify
[56:41] your hearts in Minds in your hands you
[56:43] double
[56:44] minded same Greek
[56:47] word but it's on a different level the
[56:50] wise version she just gots it going on
[56:52] up here right double just struggling

[57:00] pray Lord Jesus stra straighten out my
[57:02] heart and mind today God help me to be
[57:03] focused on you right but that's
[57:05] different than the that's different from
[57:07] James 4 James 4 they're sleeping around
[57:10] they're contentions in the church
[57:11] they're fighting amongst each other
[57:12] they're going out and attacking people
[57:14] in the
[57:16] church everybody see that have I
[57:19] preached the Bible plainly this
[57:22] morning Hallelujah is that plain enough
[57:24] so everybody can see it
[57:28] glory to God what's unstable

[1:00:01] I think let's see help me Holy
[1:00:04] Spirit help me yeah I think I'll go this
[1:00:06] route let's go to uh 1
[1:00:09] Samuel chapter
[1:00:12] 229 this is a man I mentioned numerous
[1:00:15] times
[1:00:17] Eli
[1:00:19] Eli I think Eli among a few other
[1:00:22] examples is a prime example of a
[1:00:24] double-minded man
[1:00:28] he's a prime
[1:00:30] example we Pi we pick him up in in 1st
[1:00:33] Samuel 2 but who remembers 1st Samuel 1
[1:00:35] 1st Samuel 1 is Hannah she said she's
[1:00:37] praying and fasting for a child and she
[1:00:39] makes a vow she's crying and weeping
[1:00:40] before God and Eli walks up and says why
[1:00:43] you drunk
[1:00:44] woman sister why you drinking in the
[1:00:46] church you a you know drunkenness and
[1:00:49] she said no no Eli my my soul is being
[1:00:53] poured out before the Lord I want a
[1:00:54] child and he said God God heard your
[1:00:56] prayer God did hear her
[1:00:59] prayer the next year you know she was
[1:01:02] expecting had Samuel
[1:01:04] right so look he's moved by God look at
[1:01:06] that brother William he's moved by God
[1:01:08] with thus sayith the Lord God heard your
[1:01:09] prayer or maybe that's a Word of Faith
[1:01:11] because she didn't have he didn't have
[1:01:12] thus say the Lord behind it but he said
[1:01:13] God heard your prayer a Word of Faith
[1:01:16] Hallelujah Assurance faith is Assurance
[1:01:19] it's a revelation of the will of God
[1:01:20] Amen said God heard your prayer Hannah
[1:01:23] you're seeking God you're fasting for a
[1:01:25] child God heard heard your prayer
[1:01:26] Hallelujah God honor that man God
[1:01:29] honored that
[1:01:30] woman but now we fast forward a few
[1:01:33] years things have turned out really
[1:01:35] awful for Eli 1st Samuel 22930 can you
[1:01:40] put up there hun so I can read
[1:01:42] it that one I didn't get time to put
[1:01:44] that in mind wherefore kick ye at my
[1:01:46] sacrifice and at my offering which I
[1:01:48] have commanded in my habitation and
[1:01:50] honor thy Sons above me now just leave
[1:01:52] that up
[1:01:53] there God had to visit Samuel to rebuke
[1:01:56] Eli because God couldn't visit Eli
[1:01:59] anymore Church you're just going to be
[1:02:02] surprised here you know maybe you won't
[1:02:04] be but this is so much like
[1:02:07] today people can have God speak through
[1:02:10] them but then they can be double-minded
[1:02:11] and then God won't talk to them anymore
[1:02:13] because God resists the
[1:02:14] proud remember Eli between this Eli had
[1:02:18] let his sons work the
[1:02:21] sacrifices and remember they would
[1:02:23] commit adultery oh there it is tiing
[1:02:25] perfectly thank thank you Lord amen I
[1:02:26] just I just said a little prayer Lord
[1:02:27] help me to tie this together Glory he
[1:02:30] said you adulterers and
[1:02:32] adulteresses you double-minded and Eli
[1:02:35] knows his sons are fting with these
[1:02:38] wives laying with them committing
[1:02:40] adultery and he lets them continue to do
[1:02:44] it and not only that he let them say
[1:02:47] well I'm taking the fat the the the son
[1:02:49] said I we're taking the fat and the
[1:02:51] people are like no that belongs to God
[1:02:53] and they said well you're either going
[1:02:54] to offer it or have no offering they
[1:02:56] said fine you can have
[1:02:59] it right they just fine you preachers
[1:03:02] you bunch of backx and preachers you
[1:03:04] know and the Bible said it made them
[1:03:06] hate those sacrifices well you know
[1:03:08] because it wasn't a pure sacrifice the
[1:03:10] preachers were pre was living in such
[1:03:12] sin it wouldn't allow the people to have
[1:03:14] a pure heart as they gave sacrifices to
[1:03:17] God and Eli knew
[1:03:20] it he and he and because he did this he
[1:03:23] honored his sons above God see anytime
[1:03:27] anytime we let our children or anytime
[1:03:30] we let ourselves sin we've honored
[1:03:32] ourselves and sin above God I was hoping
[1:03:35] for a little amen more Amen on that one
[1:03:36] by God's grace good buddy good always
[1:03:39] say Amen to the word of God I need me
[1:03:41] too especially when guest preachers
[1:03:43] comeing anytime we sin we've honored
[1:03:47] ourselves above God and God told and
[1:03:51] David told the people he said God will
[1:03:53] honor those who honor God hallelujah and
[1:03:56] so God's going to dishonor Eli in his
[1:03:59] death but yet he could say God gave me a
[1:04:02] word God gave Supernatural God gave me
[1:04:04] the spoken word ah there it is amen I
[1:04:07] had the spoken word power I spoke and
[1:04:09] said God heard your prayers and God
[1:04:10] manifested a child out of a barren woman
[1:04:13] he could say I've spoken the word I've
[1:04:15] done the third pole I've done all this
[1:04:18] but yet he was double-minded in his
[1:04:21] ways he said well I'll turn my cheek to
[1:04:23] that because that that's of course
[1:04:24] that's my son you know that's my family
[1:04:27] God called my family to serve God I'll
[1:04:28] just I'll just turn no no he should have
[1:04:31] went there and said no boys you're out
[1:04:32] of this even if I got to do it all
[1:04:34] myself I'll do
[1:04:35] it
[1:04:38] Hallelujah even if I have to do the
[1:04:40] whole thing myself I'll do it just to
[1:04:42] make sure it's done right
[1:04:43] Hallelujah and God was looking for him
[1:04:45] to do that sacrifice but he didn't do
[1:04:47] that he was too
[1:04:50] prideful to make yourselves fat with the
[1:04:53] chiefest of all the offerings of Israel
[1:04:56] my people so they were living large Eli
[1:04:59] and his sons were living large well
[1:05:01] everybody else they just they weren't
[1:05:04] living like them they were living above
[1:05:06] them verse 30 look at this my goodness
[1:05:09] is it amazing how this repeats wherefore
[1:05:12] the Lord God of Israel saith I said
[1:05:14] indeed that thy house and the house of
[1:05:15] thy father should walk before me forever
[1:05:17] but now is this sound famili anybody you
[1:05:20] were given a forever promise but because
[1:05:22] you disobeyed it's taken from you
[1:05:26] that's King
[1:05:27] Saul God Samuel told Saul you'll have it
[1:05:29] forever but because you disobey God's
[1:05:32] taking it from you give it to somebody
[1:05:33] better a man after my own heart
[1:05:36] hallelujah how many people have lost
[1:05:38] forever
[1:05:39] promises know for Generations your
[1:05:41] family would have been here if you just
[1:05:43] would serve God if you just would have
[1:05:44] been
[1:05:45] faithful I Believe In Forever promises
[1:05:47] amen now the forever promise we're going
[1:05:49] for is eternal life amen hallelujah but
[1:05:53] see there's generational promises that
[1:05:55] go along with people right that's what
[1:05:57] Esau and Jacob was all about Esau's like
[1:05:59] I don't care about this Birthright just
[1:06:00] give me the food let me just feed my
[1:06:02] flesh I'm just hungry but Jacob was like
[1:06:04] I want the spiritual blessings I want to
[1:06:06] be connected to the Messiah I want to be
[1:06:08] connected to God I want to walk like God
[1:06:10] change my walk so that I can go from
[1:06:12] Jacob supplanter to to Israel a prince
[1:06:15] of Power with God and Men Hallelujah in
[1:06:18] other words put me in the family of God
[1:06:20] Amen make me a spiritual Warrior for the
[1:06:22] faith Hallelujah
[1:06:26] but now the Lord sayi be it far from me
[1:06:28] for them that honor me I will
[1:06:31] honor and they that despise me shall be
[1:06:33] lightly esteemed look what the sons were
[1:06:35] doing it just struck me now the sons
[1:06:37] were causing a war in the church they
[1:06:39] were causing war against the people
[1:06:41] bringing offerings and he just Eli Just
[1:06:43] Let It
[1:06:44] Go but yet he had the power of the
[1:06:46] spoken word I speak to you had he right
[1:06:48] right something something like that now
[1:06:49] brother man was a true true man of God
[1:06:51] what I'm saying is that Eli had that
[1:06:52] same power speak the word Hannah
[1:06:56] it's
[1:06:57] yours oh but I'll turn a blinded eye
[1:06:59] towards the sin this the wars in the
[1:07:01] church I won't address it no you better
[1:07:03] root it out you better get it out of
[1:07:06] there or it's going to turn into
[1:07:08] something like this and remember his
[1:07:09] second sin remember his second sin he
[1:07:11] let the lights go out in the Holy place
[1:07:14] the holy place is right here how many
[1:07:17] how many know this is the outer Court Bo
[1:07:19] we sure take a good care of our outer
[1:07:20] Court brother Mai you took good care of
[1:07:22] the outer court today buddy look at him
[1:07:24] brother Jose you look so good on the
[1:07:25] outer Court he he looked so good last
[1:07:29] week you look good every week brother
[1:07:32] but you know what I'm saying we take so
[1:07:33] much time boy I did my hair this morning
[1:07:35] got the got everything all dressed up
[1:07:37] nice and ready that's the outer Court
[1:07:40] the holy places right here the spirit
[1:07:43] the mind did you get your thoughts on
[1:07:45] the right things
[1:07:46] today Hallelujah did you cast down did
[1:07:49] you cast down did we cast down anything
[1:07:51] that exalts itself against the word of
[1:07:53] God before we're coming to church that's
[1:07:55] what Eli forsook he let the light go out
[1:07:58] and the Bible said the the seven manora
[1:08:00] was the light and and the Bible said ye
[1:08:02] are the light of the world Amen so the
[1:08:05] Candlestick represent the church ages
[1:08:07] the light of the world and Eli let the
[1:08:09] light of his church age go out
[1:08:11] Hallelujah because he let sin come in
[1:08:13] the
[1:08:14] church
[1:08:16] Hallelujah so not only that he let his
[1:08:19] sons do all this he he stopped the
[1:08:21] service for the holy place so what that
[1:08:23] means the Hol of holies is going to come
[1:08:24] back and rebuke him see that
[1:08:26] because he he oh I just shck me right
[1:08:28] there my goodness the outer Court was

[1:08:35] was polluted the holy place was polluted
[1:08:38] so nobody was getting to the Hol of
[1:08:39] holies so God had to send somebody else
[1:08:41] God had to send a revivalist a real
[1:08:43] prophet of God man named Samuel
[1:08:45] hallelujah oh my that's beautiful I
[1:08:47] never seen that brother the OU Court was
[1:08:49] polluted the most holy place I'm sorry
[1:08:51] the holy place was polluted so nobody
[1:08:53] was getting into God's presence so God
[1:08:54] had to send a a fresh Revival oh God
[1:08:57] send us a fresh Revival amen people that
[1:09:00] love God Amen people that will purify
[1:09:03] their hearts and their
[1:09:05] minds people that will be
[1:09:08] single-minded not
[1:09:10] double-minded
[1:09:12] Hallelujah so Eli would flip he'd be
[1:09:14] like oh yes praise the Lord and the next
[1:09:16] thing he' like oh that's okay I'll let
[1:09:17] that sin go oh no praise the Lord
[1:09:19] hallelujah glory to God I believe the
[1:09:20] message no no I'm going to do this I'm
[1:09:23] going allow this to happen see how he's
[1:09:24] double-minded can everybody see that
[1:09:29] and God had to tell this brother William
[1:09:30] to a little
[1:09:31] boy Eli was so far from God he had to
[1:09:34] have a little child rebuke him think
[1:09:35] about that oh my goodness a
[1:09:38] child out of the mouth of babes God has
[1:09:42] perfected
[1:09:44] praise that's speaking of Praise but
[1:09:46] here now we can see it also speaks of
[1:09:47] the wisdom of God hallelujah so you
[1:09:50] children just know children look at me
[1:09:52] just know God can use your questions
[1:09:54] right God can use your worship for God
[1:09:58] God can use that to help out some of us
[1:09:59] adults sometimes right little Z right
[1:10:03] Jen if you love God and you talk think
[1:10:05] about praying and worshiping your love
[1:10:07] for God can help some of us older Saints
[1:10:10] some of us
[1:10:12] mature mature Saints because that's what
[1:10:15] God did with Eli a man of God preacher
[1:10:18] right
[1:10:20] priest all right look at that go to
[1:10:23] chapter 3: 13 a first 1 Samuel 3:13 I'm
[1:10:27] almost done I I'm almost done I can see
[1:10:29] how I could preach on this I could
[1:10:31] probably preach for four hours on this
[1:10:32] topic here so I better stop after this
[1:10:34] one give me a couple more uh couple more
[1:10:38] minutes by God's grace 1st Samuel 3 13
[1:10:40] and 14 13 for I have told him that I
[1:10:42] will judge his house forever for the
[1:10:44] iniquity which he knows stop right there
[1:10:46] leave it up there church see there's
[1:10:48] things in our lives we know it's wrong
[1:10:50] church if we don't get out of our Lives
[1:10:52] God's going to make us suffer
[1:10:55] and it's not going to be our it's not
[1:10:57] going to be God's fault it's our fault
[1:10:59] if you know you have iniquity and you
[1:11:01] don't do something about it it's time to
[1:11:03] it's time to get chased time for a big
[1:11:06] spanking and the church said he knew it
[1:11:10] he knew my son shouldn't be sleeping
[1:11:12] around he knew my son shouldn't be uh
[1:11:15] taking the sacrifice he knew he knew uh
[1:11:18] there should be light in the Sint in the
[1:11:19] Holy
[1:11:21] Place uh so how does that apply to us
[1:11:23] well brother Jesse
[1:11:25] you know your
[1:11:27] life Hallelujah you know what the Bible
[1:11:29] says everybody here know what the Bible
[1:11:31] says I know you do because you ask such
[1:11:33] deep questions sometimes I say I don't
[1:11:35] know the answer and I'm supposed to be
[1:11:36] the one who's studying the Bible all the
[1:11:38] time and I am but sometimes I don't know
[1:11:42] Hallelujah bless you see that it's the
[1:11:44] iniquities that we
[1:11:46] know that's the one we got to confess
[1:11:48] that's the one we got to
[1:11:50] overcome Hallelujah
[1:11:52] church that's what God demands of us if
[1:11:55] we really want our first love if we want
[1:11:57] our first love what is the fear of the
[1:12:00] Lord loving obedience what do how do we
[1:12:03] want to serve god with loving obedience
[1:12:05] but if iniquity gets in there what
[1:12:08] happens it it feel it feels like listen
[1:12:10] it feels like we love sin more than we
[1:12:12] would love God that's what it feels like
[1:12:14] because we're feeling with the members
[1:12:15] the sinful members of our flesh does
[1:12:17] everybody understand you think why don't
[1:12:19] I love God anymore why don't I love
[1:12:21] worshiping God why don't I love going to
[1:12:22] the house of God praising God why don't
[1:12:24] I love my brother and sister anymore
[1:12:25] something got in there an evil spirit
[1:12:28] some iniquity got in there because his
[1:12:31] sons made themselves vile and he
[1:12:33] restrained them
[1:12:35] not so of course what is restrain like
[1:12:37] you got to I know you got to restrain
[1:12:38] the dogs don't you sometimes yeah you
[1:12:40] got to hold them back right so Eli let's
[1:12:42] use that picture Eli had his sons like
[1:12:44] dogs they were dogs
[1:12:47] actually they had dog nature uh and see
[1:12:52] he should have kept them back from going
[1:12:55] after the women he should have kept them
[1:12:57] back from from uh disrupting or
[1:13:01] dishonoring the sacrifices but look he
[1:13:03] let go the leash sister let go the leash
[1:13:05] and what those what what do those
[1:13:06] untrained dogs do when they're off the
[1:13:08] leash what would they do they'll attack
[1:13:11] and so like wolves their two sons go
[1:13:13] over there they attack the women and try
[1:13:15] to get up all the adultery they can and
[1:13:17] then they attack and try to get all the
[1:13:18] food they can and the Bible said they
[1:13:20] made themselves
[1:13:23] overweight because of of the lust of the
[1:13:26] flesh lust of the eyes pride of
[1:13:30] life Hallelujah hope this is hitting
[1:13:33] home with somebody Hallelujah you don't
[1:13:36] have to say Amen too loud on that one
[1:13:38] verse 14 see his job as a preacher was
[1:13:41] to restrain them hold them
[1:13:44] back if I know sin if I if I know there
[1:13:47] sin if I know there s sin in these dogs
[1:13:49] I'm going to hold them back I'm not
[1:13:50] going to let them ravish and attack
[1:13:53] that's what our job is as parent parents
[1:13:55] that's what my job as is as a
[1:13:58] pastor right restrain Hallelujah to lead
[1:14:03] by
[1:14:04] example and therefore I've sworn unto
[1:14:06] the house of Eli that the iniquity of
[1:14:08] Eli's house shall not be purged with
[1:14:10] sacrifice nor offering
[1:14:17] forever
[1:14:19] Hallelujah so let's look at Eli for a
[1:14:21] moment was he unstable in all his ways
[1:14:28] uh while you're waiting I put up 1st
[1:14:29] Samuel
[1:14:31] 4:13 was his health unstable yes he was
[1:14:35] so overweight when he heard about the
[1:14:37] ark being taken he fell his his weight
[1:14:39] caused him to fall over he almost passed
[1:14:41] out hit his head and he died because he
[1:14:43] was
[1:14:44] overweight and his sons were too the the
[1:14:46] Bible said that they made themselves
[1:14:48] overweight with the sacrifices now how
[1:14:51] do
[1:14:52] they I better not say nothing about that
[1:14:54] so he was unstable in his health uh yes
[1:14:58] he was unstable in his parenting and the
[1:15:00] church
[1:15:01] said couldn't parent them the right way
[1:15:03] God bless you Faithful parents God bless
[1:15:06] you Faithful grandparents Hallelujah
[1:15:09] that's right be faithful be faithful
[1:15:12] parents but he would sometimes oh it's
[1:15:14] okay if they do this no you better not
[1:15:16] do that oh it's okay if you do this un
[1:15:18] just
[1:15:19] unstable it's okay for you to sleep with
[1:15:21] them no
[1:15:22] no well you we better we got to go to
[1:15:25] church we got to go to church uh it's
[1:15:27] okay for you to sleep with them you know
[1:15:28] just back and
[1:15:30] forth so part I'll say like this partly
[1:15:32] obeying God partly disobeying God church
[1:15:36] we want to love God with all of our what
[1:15:38] Hearts soul mind
[1:15:41] strength heart soul mind strength give
[1:15:45] it all to God why Church why would we
[1:15:49] want to hold anything back from
[1:15:51] God he's he's our maker he formed us why
[1:15:53] would we want to hold anything back from
[1:15:55] god let's give God all of us I tell you
[1:15:57] it's a joy to give God all of you
[1:16:00] because now you finally feel free he's
[1:16:01] got all of me amen he's got every part
[1:16:03] of my life I've given to him everything
[1:16:05] amen hallelujah he's got full control he
[1:16:07] can do whatever he wants in my life I'm
[1:16:09] right here hallelujah brother man said
[1:16:11] God knows where to find you don't don't
[1:16:12] ever think you ever fall out of God's
[1:16:13] sight God knows right where you are and
[1:16:15] he'll use you right when he wants to use
[1:16:16] you that's a peace of God I live with
[1:16:18] that brother William for decades God's
[1:16:20] going to use me whenever he wants to use
[1:16:22] me if he wants to send me to Iowa to
[1:16:24] preach against porn I'll do that praise
[1:16:26] God the one the one brother was there he
[1:16:28] was visiting from Texas he goes to a big
[1:16:30] a mega mega church wonderful church as
[1:16:33] far as I know in Texas and he he got up
[1:16:34] and he said he told me he said brother
[1:16:35] Jesse he said you know brother he said
[1:16:37] you can preach that because you've
[1:16:38] experienced that now I don't know if
[1:16:41] it's a compliment or a
[1:16:44] rebuke because he's like in other words
[1:16:46] he's saying I've never I've never been
[1:16:48] there and that that might be the case
[1:16:51] but see God couldn't use him to preach
[1:16:52] it because he's never struggled with it
[1:16:55] see what you've struggled with and what
[1:16:57] you've overcame God can use you to help
[1:16:59] somebody else overcome Hallelujah so he
[1:17:02] was writing what he said but I don't
[1:17:03] know if it was an attack or if it was a
[1:17:05] blessing or a compliment oh yeah you
[1:17:07] were you there that's right yeah you out
[1:17:09] there yeah I don't know if you heard it
[1:17:10] or not at the table so I I know well is
[1:17:13] that a compliment or a blessing or curse
[1:17:15] or I'm sorry a rebuke or a blessing so I
[1:17:17] don't
[1:17:18] know but see that's what we got to be
[1:17:21] mindful of church we gotta be we got to
[1:17:22] make sure we're not unstable in our
[1:17:24] parenting or in our health some people
[1:17:26] say I want to be healthy and you drink
[1:17:28] all this popping nonsense or all all
[1:17:30] sugary coffee like you're
[1:17:33] double-minded right you can't you can't
[1:17:35] do that and say I'm GNA get healthy
[1:17:38] right you're double-minded see you you
[1:17:40] go back and forth right but that I'll
[1:17:44] say like this that might be just one
[1:17:45] like for me that was one place where I
[1:17:47] struggled I preach it I don't think I
[1:17:48] don't think Austin Lena were there that
[1:17:49] day when I preach I preach it over there
[1:17:50] in that Sanctuary I think you guys were
[1:17:51] sick that day I showed a slideshow with
[1:17:53] all the things I used to eat and
[1:17:55] amount of sugar in them I think you guys
[1:17:56] were sick that
[1:17:57] day but so in my life at that time when
[1:18:00] I had all those uh rashes that was my
[1:18:03] one struggle I wasn't double minded with
[1:18:04] the word it was just that I was D just
[1:18:06] double minded with that area of my life
[1:18:09] I thought well hey I'm a preacher I work
[1:18:11] hard I might as well get some uh Dr
[1:18:12] Pepper and a Baconator after work I
[1:18:15] might as well I'm a preacher I mean I
[1:18:17] work hard you know what a bunch of
[1:18:20] nonsense what a bunch of
[1:18:22] double-mindedness I I deserve a big
[1:18:24] bacon ater
[1:18:25] I worked hard this week well then it
[1:18:27] turns in not just once a week now it's
[1:18:28] twice a week now it's three times a week
[1:18:30] and now you got an
[1:18:32] infection now you're
[1:18:34] sick I know see I know what I'm
[1:18:36] preaching I'm not preaching something I
[1:18:38] don't know I know what I'm preaching
[1:18:39] amen right we we all know what
[1:18:41] double-mindedness is
[1:18:44] like so Eli's this classic example
[1:18:47] unstable in his health unstable with
[1:18:49] parenting unstable spiritual he'll go to
[1:18:52] church he'll let them sacrifice but
[1:18:55] the Suns ruined the sacrifice and don't
[1:18:58] have light in the sanctu the sanctuary
[1:19:00] of the Holy Place partially serve God
[1:19:03] not all the
[1:19:06] way purify your hearts you
[1:19:10] double-minded purify your hands ye
[1:19:14] Sinners that's what Eli didn't do he
[1:19:17] should have purified his hand say son
[1:19:19] Sons I'm kicking you out you you're done
[1:19:23] then he you should have said people
[1:19:25] bring me the oil we don't you know we
[1:19:26] don't have we don't have oil in the Holy
[1:19:28] place we're breaking the word of God he
[1:19:30] should have said bring the
[1:19:32] oil right he should have said no I don't
[1:19:34] need any more food I'm good this is all
[1:19:36] my body needs I don't have to Gorge
[1:19:37] myself every time I eat and the church
[1:19:39] said amen we don't have to do that we
[1:19:42] don't have to have snacks between meals
[1:19:45] you don't have to eat every single meal
[1:19:46] you can fast
[1:19:48] sometimes
[1:19:50] said I mean it's just ridiculous but
[1:19:53] it's a double-minded this why I do this
[1:19:55] no I do this no sometimes I'm good some
[1:19:58] no let's be Let's Be True in every area
[1:20:00] of our life Hallelujah let's be stable
[1:20:01] in our
[1:20:03] lives

[1:20:07] to stop it I want to share a little
[1:20:08] quick testimony but that's not going to
[1:20:09] be on the live stream okay um because
[1:20:13] it's a more personal
[1:20:15] one so Eli trembles oh yeah yeah yeah
[1:20:18] I'm sorry 44 I I didn't see there it is
[1:20:21] I want you to see this church look how
[1:20:22] double-minded this man was

[1:20:28] for news what how how' the battle go uh
[1:20:30] did did we get the victory is the ark
[1:20:32] still ours Eli sat on a upon a seat by

[1:24:20] to come to my meetings be prayed for he
[1:24:22] said at least let your pastor know ask
[1:24:23] permission from your pastor CU he's
[1:24:25] expecting you to be there to help the
[1:24:27] service your post of Duty look
[1:24:30] up but church I've seen that over the
[1:24:32] years oh yeah yeah one one time my
[1:24:34] brother came and said oh brother we had
[1:24:35] the greatest meetings these big name I I
[1:24:37] love the big name preachers too now
[1:24:39] they're off the word but the brother
[1:24:40] came he said oh we felt like the Rapture
[1:24:42] was going to happen we had such a
[1:24:43] Revival and the very next week skip
[1:24:45] church the week after that he was
[1:24:46] falling asleep in our services what
[1:24:48] happened to that great Revival were the
[1:24:50] greatest meanings you ever had how come
[1:24:51] that didn't last it's because you're
[1:24:53] double-minded
[1:24:56] Hallelujah you tremble at the you're
[1:24:58] just an Eli I'll say like that you're an
[1:24:59] Eli amen you can tremble at God's
[1:25:02] presence when when when it works for you
[1:25:04] or or or you know when you have your
[1:25:05] lusts met or all these things but you
[1:25:07] don't honor God every day God wants an
[1:25:09] everyday honored life of Christianity
[1:25:11] amen God wants a consecrated
[1:25:13] single-minded Christian walk
[1:25:19] amen God help us not to be Eli well when
[1:25:23] that preacher comes then we'll finally
[1:25:24] have church why can't we have it
[1:25:26] now now don't get wrong don't I love
[1:25:28] special meetings too I get excited too
[1:25:30] but like I told you with Brother McBride
[1:25:32] we prayed what was it um Monday Tuesday
[1:25:35] Wednesday
[1:25:36] Thursday we prayed uh two and a half or
[1:25:40] three extra hours and I thought we're
[1:25:41] going to have a dancing service well it
[1:25:42] turned out a little different sometimes
[1:25:44] God does different things than what we
[1:25:45] think I was praying thinking oh God
[1:25:47] bless us with dancing rejoicing Miracles
[1:25:50] we got something else didn't we
[1:25:52] Hallelujah did we still get the word the
[1:25:54] Lord yes in fact my wife said she's
[1:25:56] never seen God so uh so thoroughly give
[1:26:00] us a word from the Lord than when
[1:26:02] brother Denis McBride was here
[1:26:04] last I thought that was quite a
[1:26:07] thing but see if we tremble at brother
[1:26:09] McBride but we don't tremble just at the
[1:26:11] pastor or just at brother Simon or you
[1:26:13] know the people we hear the most well
[1:26:15] then what are we doing we're playing
[1:26:17] favorites and we'll tremble at the Ark
[1:26:19] of God but then we'll allow iniquity in
[1:26:21] our lives see church it's the stability
[1:26:23] there it is
[1:26:24] it's the
[1:26:25] stability God give us stability where we
[1:26:28] don't wander off the path and then
[1:26:30] wander back in can we just have some
[1:26:32] singleness of mind can we just have a
[1:26:34] real fire for God all the days of our
[1:26:36] life how many want that by God's grace
[1:26:39] let's stand on our feet God bless
