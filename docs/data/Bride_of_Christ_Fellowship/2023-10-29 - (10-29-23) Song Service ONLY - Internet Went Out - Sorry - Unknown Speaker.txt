the word of God let's go to Exodus 1211 and then we'll read in Deuteronomy 10 but Exodus 1211 I just want to read two portions of scripture here before we have you be seated by God's grace Exodus 12 Exodus 1211 we'll read 111 1213 I kind of had this thought kind of sitting in the I'd say like the back burner or whatever you want to call it for a few weeks here i' like to preach this morning on the Lord God of gods just a simple little lesson on uh God's character the Lord God of Gods Exodus 12 verse 11 I'll read uh 11 and we can all read verse 12 and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover let's read verse 12 together one two three for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord I'll read verse 13 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt praise God how many thankful for the blood of Jesus praise God if the blood of lambs could do that what will the blood of Jesus Christ do Hallelujah it'll do much more hallelujah amen Deuteronomy 10 verse1 17 we'll read that as well Deuteronomy 10 verse 17 there's one of the I think there's five or so scriptures that call God the Lord God of gods Deuteronomy 10 ver 17 and 18 verse 17 says for the Lord your God is God of gods and the Lord of lords a great God listen to How it describes him a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward you can't bribe him you can't play around with him you can't pretend with him he's a great and terrible almighty God he doesn't respect one person above another aren't you glad children should be glad women should be glad young people old people everybody should be glad he doesn't respect persons Verse 18 he doth execute the Judgment of the fatherless and the Widow and loveth the stranger Hallelujah giving him food and rment let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God Heavenly Father we come to you you're the Lord God of gods and we worship you today Lord we' read your scripture here this is just taking a topical context here Lord God I pray You' to anoint me anoint your people Lord that's what causes all the difference is the anointing of the Holy Spirit directing Us by the word of God hallelujah so may we have both spirit and Truth the anointing and the true revelation of the word of God today as we always desire Lord God to be true worshippers so father just take control now of the service I pray You' minister to the needs of your people these are your sheep the Bible say
