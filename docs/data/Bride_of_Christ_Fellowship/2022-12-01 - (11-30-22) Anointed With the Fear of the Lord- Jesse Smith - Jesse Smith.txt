TRANSCRIPT
========================================
by God's grace I was expecting some visitors but it looks like they're not going to be able to make it let's go to Isaiah chapter 11. this morning I met with one of the friends from the Baptist Church and so he said he would try to make it tonight that's okay if he couldn't make it um but we're willing we'll pray for him in a moment as well by God's grace let's go to uh Isaiah chapter 11 verses 1 and 2. like to take a different thought here tonight you know I've been doing a lot of series but I'd like to take the thought on Anointed with the fear of the Lord I'd like to mention that on Sunday about the fear of the Lord like to revisit the fear of the Lords we like to look at that here tonight by the help of the Lord Isaiah 11 verses 1 and 2. here we see the anointing of the fear of the Lord It's a attribute of being Anointed with the Holy Spirit after this we'll read one more portion of scripture but let's read this together if you if you're able to let's read it on three one two three and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord so we can clearly see it's an anointing praise God fearing God is an anointing of the Holy Spirit and also let's go to Proverbs 14 26. as I've been studying this topic you know this week I've just felt I think we all need to revisit the fear of the Lord from time to time don't you I know in my life I certainly do that's why I was crying up here at the altar and you know I try to do that every service just Lord search me try me Hallelujah mold me shape me fill me you know that's uh that's what every Christian should Desire by God's grace Proverbs 14 26 and 27. I'll read verse 26 myself and then we can all read 27 verse 26 says in the fear the Lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of Refuge let's read verse 27 1 2 3 the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snares of death amen how many of you need on there they're hardly like remembered here tonight let's have a word of prayer as we go into the presence of God to hear one more time father God in heaven we thank you Lord God for your mercy Hallelujah all glory to Your Name Lord I read that I believe in Psalms this morning Lord you said you will not share your glory with anyone else Lord so we give you Lord Jesus all the praise all the glory the reason we're here and not out in the world or in some Hospital the reason we're here is because of your grace and your mercy and your love we want to give you thanks and praise for that Lord God we recognize your blessing upon our life Lord God recognize your head you've said about us Lord God thank you Lord Jesus for every good and perfect gift Lord all glory to the name of Jesus tonight father God I just humble myself and when I recognize Lord I need a fresh revisiting of the fear of the Lord and so Lord I pray you'd use me as your vessel Lord as your microphone but God cleanse My Heart Lord while you're using me Lord cleanse my heart dear God hallelujah help me to reverence Your Name Lord God help me to Lord God embody the word of God that I'm preaching Lord God I know preachers will be judged Lord even more harshly Lord so God help me to live what I preach God help me to be a faithful witness Lord God and Father I just pray your Holy Spirit would anoint us afresh Lord God with the anointing of the fear of the Lord God be with each and every need Lord as we prayed there in the room there's many that are sick in The Afflicted Lord that are battling cancer I pray for my co-worker who's got breast cancer I pray in Jesus name God she could look to you God help us to be a light help me to be a light and a witness Lord I haven't really talked to her for many many months here Lord God so I pray God you give me an opportunity Lord for those our family members were Becky and Gene we

praise all the glory we'll lift our hands high to you we'll sing we'll raise our voices to your Holy Name Lord Jesus we ask all these blessings in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I'll try to preach about our Lord willing tonight here by God's grace and I'd like to look at Anointed with the fear of the Lord I have a few quotes I'd like to show here you know I looked up in the in the message and brother Branham only mentioned the fear of the Lord just four times you know so um uh you know it wasn't a subject maybe that he hit uh so so much but uh it's all throughout the message you know reverence and respect for God and love for God and humility you know a lot of these uh a lot of these statements of course are very closely related so I would like to look at this here and uh you know we know the word anoint means to rub on you know so if you said I'm anointed uh you know with uh with calmine lotion or something like that you'd rub it on or if I'm Anointed with any type of lotion it's it's something you rub on like I put oil in my hair now my hair my hair is Anointed now with coconut oil you know I know it's silly but that's the truth you know I try not to use all that other stuff well when you're anointed it's rubbed on you so if we go to the spiritual now you know uh we have to be in contact with God if we want to be anointed he's got to contact us right we got to be in contact we got to invite the presence of the Lord the Bible says draw near to God he'll draw near to you praise God so if we want God to rub his Spirit upon us and to minister to us and put his Blessing on our life we've got to draw an eye to him praise God how many know that by the grace of the Lord praise God hallelujah and so we want the anointing of the Lord and we know it comes through fellowship with the Lord so we read our texts here and I actually actually added another text we'll get to that I want to end with that one but what is fear I I think the best way for maybe us to understand it is profound honor uh because that's kind of what Webster says you know if we just look in the in the uh the Hebrew it means morally reverence now morally means you're you're doing what's right that's that's moral no matter who's whose Community it is but we're in God's Community praise God so we know morality is obeying the Commandments praise God now reverence here is this reverence is this honor uh which for us is integrity honesty it's respect so it's moral reverence it's doing what's right with with a sense of reverence with a sense of Honor like I'm going to honor God I'm going to show him uh total respect praise God and this is an anointing as we'll see here we'll get to that here by the grace of the Lord so it's an anointing where you're doing what's right and uh it's in all honesty you're not putting on a show in front of anybody it's it's just complete honesty praise God that's what God loves amen and honest heart a heart that's doing right and a heart that is honest praise God and so you know we want to just take this thought now Anointed with this profound honor for God now of course brother Brown says we should in the message respects we should respect one another we should fear one another in other words brother Brown said I never want to sin and cause the church to think less of me I never want to sin and lose someone's confidence where they don't have confidence in me anymore like a scandal or something or you know something incredibly awful you know you we don't want to never do that um but you know even more so our main objective should be to have fear for the Lord our main honor should be to God almighty and church that's one thing we ought to remember that God is constantly watching us praise God you know I used to be afraid about you know the live stream this was years ago well someone's going to see our service and kind of nervous on Livestream I'm way past that now you know uh but the reality of it was you know is that and I even mentioned it a few years ago is that my whole life your whole life is live streamed before God and the angels praise God and church they don't they don't go to sleep right they're not going to miss something in our lives you know they're God's always watching you know uh and of course not to punish us but he loves us and he wants us to walk on the right path amen Jesus said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten you know sister who I was thinking of your testimony uh this week my wife and I were on a date and I heard Christmas song I started tapping my foot and I instantly thought of your and I said Lord Jesus forgive me you know I thought it was like a snow song or something like that see that's the power of a testimony sister when you share that with somebody else you know it's a real blessing I thought I see I was getting into the wrong you know just I just was in the flesh and I thought oh I need to get back to fear of the Lord I remember what the holy spirit said to you and I thought wow that really brought me back to that like I remember you know it seems so it seems so maybe uh innocent you know just a a song about snow and Christmas it seems so innocent but it actually takes your heart away from the things of God right yeah you know what it came to me it's actually worshiping the creation more than the Creator you know you're thinking about a special time of the year and gifts and trees and snow and which all things we love who doesn't love getting a gift it's a sign of love and we do it you know because Jesus did it for or God give it God gave us the greatest gift you know and who doesn't like snow a little bit of snow you know uh who doesn't like that but the round of it is when we get into that Spirit we forget about the creator of all that and really our whole lives should be worshiped to that Creator praise God and not to worship the creation more than the Creator so I want to just you know just say a moment on this that when we fear the lord we have moral reverence for God we're doing what's right and we are doing an honesty and integrity praise God and church I need this just as much as anybody praise God there'll be no one that receives any Glory equal to Jesus Jesus will get all the glory praise God and you know honestly as I'm getting older you know now I'm 42 and I can see I can easily see how people can have the Solomon Solomon syndrome and how people that even new brother Branham could fall away I could see that because you get in you you get in the routine of things and Things become common and you become tired you know and you become sore and you just you're just getting older and I feel like this too God as we showed a few weeks ago with isolation God will leave us a little bit in our anointing God will leave that anointing in our minds to test us and so we can see what's in our hearts so and he'll do that so he'll show us that we cannot trust in ourselves no matter how many years we've been the message no matter how many years I've been a preacher no matter how many years I've been a father or a teacher or a husband or no matter any of these things God is trying to show us we cannot trust in ourselves we've got to trust in God all the day long praise God all the day long where we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and so I feel like I need and I think you need a healthy dose of fear praise God the fear of the Lord now here's our text I just think this is a beautiful look at this beautiful picture here in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence so when you're Anointed with the holy spirit of fear you're confident in God because you you're you're you're honoring him you know you're honoring the word you're keeping the word of God so see what's the opposite of that confidence is doubt so if we're not if we're doubting our stand with God it's because we don't have the fear of the Lord we do we displeased the Lord or something like that so I just think it's a beautiful picture when we're confident in the lord it's because we feared him we've we've honored him amen we we've obeyed his word praise God and now the next look at the next verse it's the children shall have a place of Refuge when you're Anointed with the spirit of the fear of the Lord you feel safe in God's arms Hallelujah you feel safe like you're in the secret place like this morning it was raining like crazy right it was raining like crazy and when I finally got into the school I finally got into Panera that's where I met with my friend for the little uh you know counseling session when I finally got in there I was like oh I can let off the pressure now I can I can close up the umbrella I'm not I'm still soaking wet but I'm not going to get any more wet right that you know the school in my in the the restaurant that was my place of safety and that's what it is spiritually when we're obeying the word of God oh I'm I'm walking with God I'm obeying the word of God I'm honest before God I feel safe in God Amen amen it's a beautiful picture beautiful picture of of your our walk with the Lord and I love this this next part it's just beautiful how the Lord places together he's your confidence he's your your place of safety your safety zone the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life and the and to depart from the snares of death so when we are fearing God and honoring God it's as if we've just escaped a trap that was set for us and now we're we're away from the trap and we're just drinking Waters at the Fountain of Life so in other words without without the fear of God we're very thirsty we're very thirsty and we're lacking and we feel like we I'll say like this we feel like we're spiritually weak we feel like we're spiritually deprived when we're not walking in the fear of the Lord but when we're walking the fear of the Lord the Lord is our life to us praise God the word gives us uh we enjoy the drink of it praise God Amen we feel alive Hallelujah when we're walking in the fear of the Lord the church said that's the word of God I mean it's just such a beautiful picture Hallelujah and I just wrote a picture that's the guy on Spring you know it's I showed it to you a number of maybe a year ago by now maybe more it's the the spring that's underneath it's a fountain underneath uh Mount Moriah where Jesus was crucified and where uh Simon's Temple was built David's Tabernacle was it's a stream it's a fountain there's water that just gushes through here all the time just flows and here's a picture of it uh here where it's coming out here the guy on Springs so the spring the water just rushes you know and and of course this is where the you know the the Tabernacle was built you have the the city wall the old wall you have the valley here the kids around Valley if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on that Valley it's been a while since I looked at that part but just again the picture there the fear of the Lord is as a Fountain of Life so when we're walking in honor for God it's like we are at this Fountain and we're getting a fresh drink we're not uh starving we're not dying of thirst we have life we have refreshment amen hallelujah we have everything we need to keep going praise God that's when we're walking in the fear of the Lord it's a beautiful picture of what the uh the scripture gives us an idea what is the fear of the Lord it's this spring where it's constantly flowing Hallelujah there's constant uh there's constant Supply Amen Hallelujah by God shall supply all my needs amen glory according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus what is Paul saying he's saying Paul is saying I fear Jesus Christ because I fear Jesus Christ it's like a spring and it's like a fountain bringing all that I have need of because I'm keeping the word of the Lord Amen in other words I'm not drinking the devil's wine a writer I'm not drinking I'm not eating at the devil's table but I I'm at the table of the Lord I'm I'm drinking the life of God and I I'm enjoying the presence of the Lord praise God Hallelujah a little bit closer at this verse now so we're taught not to Cast Away our confidence in the book of Hebrews right cast not away therefore your confidence the Bible says so it's equivalent to not losing the fear of the Lord okay and also fearing God is is our hiding place so when we honor God when we obey God it actually gives us a hiding place in God from all the storms of the world from all the all the attacks of Satan all these attacks and all these uh mind battles I'll say like this that's what I was telling my friend this morning you know the Mind battles that's the hard part about it Like You Can Be You Can Be recently saved you can be recently filled with the Holy Ghost you can be recently have a Revival you can have Reese all these recent things but then all of a sudden a storm will come but your hiding place the way you'll get through that is by honoring the word obeying the words say God anoint me with the spirit of fear Hallelujah the holy spirit of fear Hallelujah so we are confident we're obeying the word of God we're keeping the commands this is my safety zone amen hallelujah this is my safety Place Hallelujah where I'm keeping the word of God and we know this but fear is a pre prerequisite rather to wisdom wisdom is the skill at Living the right way or in other words wisdom is living in the perfect will of God it's not walking in a permissive path that would cause pain and heartache and suffering and embarrassment or guilt the devil will try to put on you or something like that it's walking in the perfect will of God that's wisdom and the Bible said it's the principle thing it's the main thing to get on an Earthly Journey so Church wisdom has to be the baptism of the Holy Ghost up there so wisdom has to be the same as love I think I proved that on Sunday as well when I was preaching on Sunday uh because the Bible says that wisdom was with the Lord before the foundation of the world and wisdom was the Lord's daily Delight Amen in other words the the logos was the daily Delight of God Amen the visible manifestation of God moving and creating that was the Delight to the invisible Spirit Hallelujah the invisible father so charity has to be just another name for the wisdom of God because that's the principle that's a principle thing we need on this life Hallelujah oh it's beautiful praise God hallelujah so just so far what we've heard so far the fear of the Lord is your confidence the fear of the Lord is your safety zone the fear of the Lord is your starting place for wisdom and the fear of the Lord is your fountain oh how many can say Amen to that hallelujah amen thank God bye that's just four of them right there's more but this is the ones I could get to today when I started looking at this thought here so again I found this picture online of course another uh I forget what they call them now uh it's quoting Psalm 9 verse 9. the Lord is a refuge for the oppressed a stronghold in the times of trouble so when the enemies bring in waves of of unbelief waves of Doubt waves of sickness waves of of of anger right or waves of fear when we go to obeying the word of God we climb up in the tower the Lord is a refuge right the Lord fearing God honoring God respecting God's word putting God's word above everything else amen hallelujah it's a strong tower praise God it is our refuge it's our safety zone in other words I can say I know I'm saved because I'm obeying the word of God hallelujah I know the devil can't touch my soul amen because I'm obeying the word of God hallelujah oh I think it's beautiful look at these are the pictures God gives us it's the beautiful a fountain of spring a tower a place of Refuge a place of safety Hallelujah the fear of the Lord is a mighty tower praise God so is the name of the Lord now I want to read you're familiar with these but we want to read them over again the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding so again the beginning so our path you know our our journey is we're heading towards wisdom we're heading towards the perfect will of God we're heading towards the best life we could live but the starting place is fear God honor God with Integrity right be morally right be morally in the right know that you've we've done right by the grace of God that's the starting place the first step towards being in that place where we want to be the perfect will of God and wisdom is the principle the first in order of rank thing therefore get wisdom with all thy getting get understanding that's why you know the world the world there's a great move right now you know with uh uh at least in America there's a great move now with just like worldly wisdom like famous talkers like you might have heard of him Jordan Peterson he's a real popular guy now he's not a Christian his wife's a Christian if I'm not mistaken but he gets millions and millions and millions of views because he's just preaching these these these moral principles like men should be men and women should be women and you should be responsible get to work on time just you know simple things right um and they'll pay all kinds of money to get this people will listen to podcasts we talked about that uh you know ebooks audiobooks people listen to all these things and it's not even Christian it's not even a Christian author and and look how the You Know The Enemy the enemy kind of impersonates this with all their work they're trying to get just good moral principles but they're not really getting to the main principle which is Jesus Christ praise God they're getting to these they're learning a wise principles and it's maybe it's no doubt from the Bible if there's anything good it had to come from the Bible First but there in other words they're putting so much effort into just worldly wisdom how much more should we put effort into God's wisdom oh my praise God because it's the principal thing it's the very first thing we must get is the wisdom of God well before we get the wisdom of God we've got to get the fear of the Lord we've got to get the honor of the Lord back praise God Hallelujah now another picture here now that end goal right is wisdom that we're starting with the fear of the Lord we're moving towards the wisdom wisdom is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her and happy is everyone that retains her that tree of life so true happiness will only come through the wise life wisdom comes by fearing the Lord praise God so see we've got to go back to that order it's fearing the Lord that it's wisdom and then it's happiness Hallelujah I think we all want to be happy don't we if we get to our deathbed if the Lord you know the Rapture doesn't happen we want to be able to look back and say I lived a happy life and the only way it can be happy according to the word of God is if we walk we've made decisions with the wisdom of God in other words I made this decision at this time because I knew it honored the Lord right this is years ago I'm going to share this testimony I probably shared it before I think I shared you know maybe a couple months ago but again is there come a time in our church when there you know we had uh our family had a really close family and uh you know the family took a a step away from church they took a step towards business and uh it was at that moment my heart was broken and the way they they took the step was to stop studying the scriptures and and stop coming to Sunday night services and then it wasn't long then Wednesday nights where every now and then sometimes Wednesday nights then sometimes no Wednesday nights sometimes and then then no Sunday nights for sure and at that moment when I saw that it was it was a testing time for me it was uh it was just a like a a like a soul-shaking Time and so I laid at this Altar and if I'm not mistaken it was this altar maybe the other one I just cried out to God and I said Lord I want to choose the right way you know other people are choosing a different way help me to choose the right way what's the right way and during that time I was preaching the church ages and brother Ram gave us that beautiful quote the secret to Christianity is increasing your service to God it's not less service it's more service to God and church that was uh that was the word that I needed at that season and my prayer was Lord I'm going to keep doing the services more services and more fellowship and more time in the word of God I'm not going to change my direction anyway at all I'm going to keep walking this direction because I know this direction honors you they said Lord as of indication let my children receive the Holy Ghost before this other family by God's grace I have numerous children that claim to have the Holy Ghost now time's going to tell like with all of us right as soon as we make a confession what does Satan do he comes he points all of his guns at you right he's gonna he's gonna test you with your confession even when you're saved right like I was talking to my friend this morning he got saved and he said he went through all this he got all these all these attacks I said let Satan try and attack your profession you just said you're a Christian you just said you believe in Jesus Christ you just said you're being saved and all your peace is gone because the enemies attacked you with these mind battles he's trying to get you to forget what happened in your soul praise God hallelujah amen but by the grace of God and I and you know I still talk to this friend with their you know I talked to the friend in the family none of the children in that other family even claimed to have the Holy Ghost none of them but here four or nine or four three or four whatever two or three or four are actually claiming to have the Holy Ghost and to me it's God vindicating that I chose the right path because wisdom is Justified in her children amen I think that's a natural that's actually a spiritual lesson but actually it applies naturally praise God and I know all my children are going to be tested just like I was tested but just like I overcome they can overcome too by the grace of God is my okay okay yeah all right thank you I didn't know if he was sick or something like that I know Chris was battling there with the headache and I didn't know if we need to pray for him or something like that okay Hallelujah so wisdom is this tree of life you know where uh it's a place where we find life and remember there's also life in the fear of the Lord there's life there it's like a fountain it's a life-giving fountain of water but then it leads us to the tree Glory Hallelujah so fear the lord the waters will lead you to the fruit praise God hallelujah and there's just a simple picture now I just typed in Spring and tree right there's something so this this is the waters but look you can't have the wisdom you can't have the fruits you can't have you can't have a tree without the fear of the Lord first right and that's what that's what David said he said do not stand in the council the ungodly so don't take your advice from sinners take your advice from the word of God amen hallelujah thank God Amen I like podcasts like anybody else but I I'd say question everything is that the word of God I like ebooks just like anybody else is that the word of God I talked to my brother different ones about business and all kinds of things and uh I'm just saying like we all have to do this we ought to recognize the fear of the Lord is the waters but here's we've got to be planted By the Waters amen Hallelujah we got to be planted and draw in that fear of the Lord and the Bible says then we'll bring forth our fruit in due season praise God looks like a park we go to right there in Silver Creek doesn't it looks like that one it's got except it's got a bridge over it I just love that I love when you can see the The Roots going right down in there they're just drinking right I mean they're right by the water hey Hallelujah if anybody's if anybody's not going to run out of water it's that fella right and that's how we should be if anybody's going to be a real servant to Christ it should be us amen we're going to stay in the fear of the Lord hallelujah church that's I need a hearty Amen to that as well my whole life Hallelujah all of us and that's what we'll see in the scripture God encouraged us to stay in the fear of the Lord every single day it's going to be a battle but we've got to be willing to fight praise God we must fight to stay in the fear of the Lord and I'm I have to fight all day long too Hallelujah we got to stay planted by the rivers of water so fears on the necessary place you start on your way to the wisdom or the the wise life the perfect will of God and then continually continually fearing the Lord is the driving force for more wisdom so to lose the fear of the Lord is then to lose out on wisdom and what's the opposite of wisdom foolishness right we don't want to be foolish virgin so that's why we got to keep the fear of the Lord honor God obey the word of God God Is Watching I'm reverencing God I'm doing what's morally right amen hallelujah it's my Hiding Place amen it's your hiding place it's your Refuge it's your fountain praise God now how do we obtain fear there's at least three ways you have to hate evil first hate evil you also have to depart from Evil and they have to seek after God's will no doubt there's others but these are the first three I found as I Was preparing all right so Proverbs 3 verse 7 be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil Church anytime we convince ourselves and I'm guilty we we sin every day anytime we anytime we convince ourselves it's okay for me to sin we've just taken a step away from the fear of the Lord because the fear of the Lord will make you depart from Evil I know this is wrong I've got to do I have to I have to live differently right I've got to choose I've got to choose differently right each one of us we can't be wise so so that so in other words be not foolish right to be not foolish fear the lord and depart from evil the fear of the Lord is to hate evil so the the very anointing of the holy spirit makes you hate evil when you got that anointing on you you don't want to think wrong you don't want to say wrong you don't want to do wrong you're watching every word you're watching every action praise God you're in that secret place amen hallelujah you're not leaving that secret place you're staying in the place of protection Hallelujah and so then he gives examples see pride when we choose our way we think we know about it arrogancy and the evil way the thrower mouth do I hate see look God hates all these things God hates all sin so we need a fresh anointing of the fear of the Lord Hallelujah I'm right there in with you every single one of us praise God now of course we we ended the service with this on Sunday we see God's will through quiet time with the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says if you cry after God's word you lift up your voice and you seek in search then you'll find the fear of the Lord now let me see if I got that scripture yeah I do if you seek her as silver and search for her as his treasures then Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God hallelujah so see it's a seeking you know our life has to be a seeking out you know I was couraging my friend this morning I was telling him you know if you have major mind battles and this guy has some major mind battles so we got to pray for him at the end of the service I said you gotta if you have major mind battles like that like one of them I'll just share with you because some of you know about it brother I mean you know about it night terrors or where the where the enemy paralyzes you remember that I've never had that but I told her I told this this friend I said this is this is a test God allowed it and God wants to see you cry out for deliverance right you know I've had numerous friends and my brother Simon different ones that have had this come upon they can't move and it's it's a fearful thing but it's a great test it's a test of the of the battle of the mind and so God wants to see you cry out you got to cry you got to seek for deliverance amen see God's allowing it so you'll he'll draw you closer to him praise God because we all have struggles we all have trials we all have bad habits or something we all we all need deliverers from something praise God we don't need victory in our lives and so whatever God allows it's always a test to see if we're going to cry out to God do we want to be delivered do we really want to be uh walking the truth and I said then you I said once you get Victory then you got to get up early and you got to transform your mind before everything else I'm gonna get up at 4 30 all week this week I'm a little tired but I'm doing okay I'm starting to go to bed earlier so but I've realized I've if I need more time with God if I'm struggling here I've got to get some time with God and there's no other time any other time so I got to get up early see I gotta seek it like I'm seeking to become a millionaire but it's greater than that it's an eternal Heir that's a new word there Eternal Heir instead of I'm an error I'm an heir of Salvation born of a spirit washing his blood amen I don't want to be a millionaire a millionaire I want to be an eternal Heir praise God Amen different air so not AR or a i r e but h-e-i-r Hallelujah there it is amen hallelujah you know I've seen these videos this week on YouTube and they say they say oh here's the billion dollar mindset here's the million dollar man's mindset you know what that is that's for the that's for the worldly Treasures that's for the foolish things of the world but the real mindset is seek God first amen seek God and you'll find then you'll understand the fear of the Lord then you'll find the fountain amen hallelujah and if you've seen that fountains and then you'll find the tree of life amen hallelujah the Eternal Heir Hallelujah I'm an heir of Salvation purchase of God born of a spirit washing his blood amen they'll play on words there praise God is something we have to actively seek after praise God he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord but he that is perverse in his ways despises them so here this verse is about walking see when we're walking and doing what's right the Bible says we're walking in the fear of the Lord okay so our whole our whole walk today your walk with God tomorrow your walk with God should be in the fear of the Lord you should be reverencing God you should be respecting God all day honoring God all day thinking about oh does this decision going to honor God if I say that if I do that is this going to honor God if I do this is this going to honor God if I say that and then even ask yourself did that honor God Lord let me pray about that did this honor God well did I Take God in consideration before I made this decision that's walking in the fear of the Lord that's staying at the spring and drinking from the spring Hallelujah here's a good one for us let not thine heart and be sinners do not envy a sinner I don't care how rich or handsome or pretty or whatever they are do not envy them at all because their end is eternal hell now Eternal Eternal separation from God there is no such thing as eternal hell it's Eternal separation from God do not don't let your heart wish you live like them you know the fact they put all that makeup shows how empty the more the more you got to put on the outside the more empty you are on the inside right that's so true the more you got to flash and look at how much money you got that shows how empty you are because you're trusting in things that will pass away but you and I are trusting in something that can never pass away praise God hallelujah eternity Hallelujah don't let your heart Envy these people be thou in the fear of the Lord all day long praise God I could maybe I could change the lyrics to this song I'm Gonna Stay in the fear of the Lord I'm gonna stay in the fear of the Lord gonna stay in the fear of the Lord and the devil can't do me no harm you like that maybe we'll sing that at the end all day I'm gonna walk in the fear of God all day I know he's watching me but the best part is I know he's with me amen I know he loves me because he's just me just saying that amen I know God loves me church if anything we know God loves us hallelujah we're just as children we're learning how to please him I deal with children all day they're not perfect all day even the ones that were really good during the first part of the year now they're getting lacks on me now they need a lot of Correction because I become common to them and church the same thing we let God become common to us we've got to get the anointing back we can by the grace of God we can get it back every day but the Bible said walk in that honor of God all day I'm going to fear God all day and no and notice if you want to be happy walk in the fear of God all day isn't a great feeling when you get to end the day and say thank you Lord you kept me from this you kept me from that you kept me from that you kept me from that is that a great feeling to have and yeah one time during the day or a couple times during the day you failed God but isn't it great to say Lord thank you for keeping me from that thank you that my life is spared from these things what a blessing and like we can go to we can go to bed happy at the end of the day praise God hallelujah but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into Mischief see a lot of people go to bed with problems because their own mischief but church we can go to bed with peace in our hearts we can go to bed happy yeah I've got a few little things but it's not because of my Mischief right it's just that's how the that's how the world works I'm being tested or whatever right but we're happier if we walk in the fear of God lord protect me let me always stay in tune with your holy spirit amen let me go with all the while with a song and a smile fill my day every day with with love amen let me walk with the Heavenly Dove all day Hallelujah happy as that man that fears God always happy as that man or woman who's always wondering am I pleasing my Lord right now is this what the Lord wants me to do you know I thought about preaching a sermon on how to be happy there's so here's a couple of them fear God all day long and then Jesus said happy are you when you keep communion so we just had community on Sunday so everybody should be pretty happy by God's grace amen if you're keeping communion remembering the Lord and then walking the fear of God a merry heart maketh medicine so constant praise constant glory to God constantly worshiping God that's what I told my friend this morning Philippians 4 be anxious for nothing do not be careful for anything don't let anxiety or stress overtake you but with everything through prayer and Thanksgiving make your request known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus we can't let we can't walk into Mischief we can't walk into stress we can't walk with anxieties we've got to cast those on the Lord and we've got to instead give thanks back to God we've got to walk in the fear of God hallelujah and the Bible said if we do that we're happy when we always fear God Hallelujah this life is too fast not to be happy right this this life goes way too fast not to be happy with what God's done for us Hallelujah like brothers said we don't want our lives crying with a crabbiness or a an anger or a bitterness at the end of our Lives you know we don't want that we want to be crowned with God's glory praise God we want to be Cloud a crown with God's fear with God's love with God's anointing praise God a happy heart maketh good medicine Hallelujah so the way to be happy is to honor the Lord fear the lord so the conclusion of the matter I love how Solomon tells us this the wisest man this was after he'd Fallen away from God and you know it seemed like he wrote the first book Song of Solomon first you know he had only had one wife instead of a thousand seemed like he wrote that book first and then he wrote Proverbs or maybe Proverbs was right before Song of Solomon either way those first two books were just so astounding but it seems like he writes Ecclesiastes after the end of all his failures His Thousand wives his building Idols he left the fear of the Lord and he says the the whole matter the conclusion of my life the conclusion of every life amen the secret to every life is to fear God and keep his commands boy I think how many uh I think how many people are getting to see by the millions of views and they're clicking on uh what's the secret to life what's the secret life we got it right here and it's free right and there's no ads in it praise God hallelujah there's no ads and you don't see uh Ecclesiastes 12 broken up and well here's the ad for you know Quaker Oats or something like that you know you don't you don't see that there's no ads in the Bible hallelujah thank God Amen and it's it's God here reminding us and it's just amazing with Solomon and you know the story but God said as anything and he asked for wisdom he asked for the Tree of Life right rather than a money tree he asked for a tree of a tree of life of wisdom he asked for the fear of the Lord and he got it but then he even fell away he even fell away from that the wisest man became a very foolish man right so see church again it doesn't it doesn't matter what gifts we have or what gifts we don't have the main thing is to fear God and keep his commands amen because that wisdom was just a gift just I'm just saying just in other words you got it you gotta you gotta operate that gift you have to be faithful with that gift so he had the greatest gift and then God because he was so faithful with it God gave him money and riches and all these things and wealth and fame but then he let that turn him away he started trusting in that rather than in the original thing the fear of God the wisdom of the Lord I said he comes down to the end of his life he said I've tried laughter you've ever read Ecclesiastes lately he tried laughter to fulfill him he tried building to fulfill women to fulfill him he money he tried all these things and he said it's all vanity but there's one conclusion there's one secret to life it's that Fountain of fear of God and the Tree of Life the wisdom of God hallelujah Hallelujah there's one secret to life he said let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter and church May Our Lives be summed up in this what is the conclusion of our whole life what's the whole point of our life fear God honor God in every single area that we can fear God give him reverence moral reverence and keep his commands for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil praise God now church I'll say just very plainly tonight I'm very thankful God has a sea of forgetfulness because I can still remember my failures from today or yesterday whatever day but I'm so thankful the Lord has to see it forgetfulness praise God hallelujah the devil can remind me of it but God God throws it in to see a forgetfulness and so any secret thing we do or any public mistake we make or any any mistake we make with our family our friends our worker co-workers whatever they might remember the devil might bring it up but God won't bring it up and church we can repent of that and we can feel forgiven and we can be happy again because we know by God's grace we won't do it again amen and if we do it again there's grace and mercy for that as well praise God like I showed you brother Brown he constantly battled the critical spirit constantly from the beginning to his ministry all the way to the end he battled criticism thinking you know criticizing people can't say something good about people constantly now see church we may constantly battle something we may constantly battle it but God's grace is sufficient praise God there's going to be times Hallelujah there's going to be a lot of times when you're drinking from the fountain Hallelujah and you're walking in the fear of the Lord there's going to be times you might step away from that fountain but there's Grace to bring us right back Hallelujah there's Grace for that you know have you ever thought about it how many ever I think we can all relate to being like Jonah right we know what to do but then we purposely go against it and the church said that's why Jonah is such a powerful story that's why God put it in there right because we can all whether we hear the voice of God or whether we just read the voice of God in the Bible we all know we should do something and then we turn from that path and we disobey and we lose the anointing of the fear of the Lord it dries up you're physically speaking but it's a symbolism and we forget or we purposely go against it but did God ever give up on Jonah did God help Jonah accomplish his purpose that's the best part amen amen even though I were disobedient even though I'm disobedient we're all disobedient God is going to help us in his love how even if we got bad attitudes praise God he's going to help us in his love and bring us back to the truth amen well the Ram's attitude was if they don't they don't want to hear about preaching they don't have to then God brought him back he said well Lord now if you give me a new heart and I can go out to the people again and I can have a heart for the people again that's what that's what God does for us friends that's what God does for us Hallelujah so the conclusion the whole point of this life is to fear God and keep his commands now there's a bunch of examples it's still the same thing in the New Testament um we see a save thief on the cross Ephesians 5. second Corinthians 7 first Peter 2. I wrote down a couple more uh let's if you got your Bible let's go to Hebrews chapter 12 here I want to read this one I heard this A good sermon preached today Hebrews chapter 12. all right now verse 28 Hebrews 12 28 wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with what reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire let me read that again because that's a powerful verse did you catch it Church Grace and fear are in both or both both both attributes are in the same scripture let us have Grace which is God's unmerited favor so we may serve God reverently with fear the fear of the Lord the honor of the Lord so Grace of the Grace Grace had taught My Heart To Fear amen thank God Amen Amazing Grace that's beautiful I never knew where they got that scripture from until right now praise God where'd he get that verse from Amazing Grace Grace has taught My Heart To Fear see fearing God respecting God knowing God is watching that comes from a life that's lived by Grace praise God let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and fear that's what Paul said if anybody knew Grace it was Paul because Paul was he was consenting for Christians to be killed he was trying to get them to blaspheme and then he said at the end of his life he said I'll bring my body into subjection I'll do anything I'll do I'll go to any means so that I am not a Castaway Hallelujah Grace was teaching him to fear God Grace was teaching him not to trust his flesh Grace was teaching him not to give in to the lust of the flesh Grace was teaching his heart to fear and the church said amen Hallelujah Grace will do that today amen Grace does that for you and I Hallelujah Grace teaches our hearts to fear God Hallelujah you know we see it every you know every couple months there's somebody else that leaves a message or some other preacher that falls whether in the message or on the message see they didn't let Grace teach their hearts to fear they thought they could get away with this relationship or this money scheme or whatever it is they thought they could get away with it like Grace would cover it no Grace teaches you to run from it amen hallelujah Grace teaches you to hate evil praise God and you know what some of the things they say I've heard one a while ago it's been a while now but the preacher said well God forgave David of his adultery so God would forgive me of it and he was having an affair with like a teenage girl in his office or something like that that's why it's a good thing pastors well it's a good thing not to have offices like that you know where you have a woman out there as a secretary and all these things like that just not a good thing you see but that's the Old Testament mindset that's under the blood of bulls and goats that's not under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better things amen hallelujah it's a higher calling Hallelujah so see they don't understand what real Grace is Grace teaches reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire a couple weeks ago and I'm going to just share a simple thought a couple weeks ago we cut down that lilac bush Austin started it and I I got to finish it you did a good job buddy I bought one bought a I went bought a Ryobi chainsaw you know so I got up my chainsaw and we had all these all these branches and I thought oh we're gonna do a fire today it's going to be finally we got it going but this fire took off like I wasn't even ready for and pretty soon it's almost spreading you know in the grass and so my wife's like okay Jesse you got to stop that it's gonna it's gonna spread I'm like yeah it's probably going to spread here I wasn't watching the fire very good so I had to run next to the fire with the rake and try to push these these on fire logs and church I've you know I thought I was tough and I could handle it you know I'm like oh come on this is just fire I was pushing and I I was I was running by and pushing I thought you know it wasn't moving too fast but once I got in the presence of that fire it felt like I got like a total I felt like I wanted to ask Malachi is my face red or something like that here it hurts so bad I got so close to the fire and I just had to run away and just kind of make sure I was okay and you know other times you know those those little licks of fire will burn through my pants and burn through my shirts and everything like that but I just couldn't believe how hot this fire was and then I thought about this the Bible says our God is a consuming fire if the if the power that fire would make me turn my face away and and scream and run right and I didn't scream but I felt like screaming I felt like a little child running away from that fire if if the natural fire would do that what about the Holy Fire of Jesus right and this is what this is what Paul tells us you know I was blown away by the the power of that fire but the Bible says our God is a consuming fire we need to receive the kingdom of God and serve god with Grace and the Bible says with reverence and godly fear Hallelujah I think it's a great scripture Church to keep that one in Mind by the grace of the Lord beautiful scripture I want to make sure I get uh let me I just want to share this example there's a certain uh YouTuber group that we like most the time but a couple months ago I come home and uh you know the kids get their hour of screen time and uh you know most of the most of the YouTubes are funny or you know something like that you know trick shots and stuff like that you probably know what I'm talking about but I'm not going to say it that naturally but they had a certain show and afterwards the one of the guys was dressed up like a game show host and he was doing this lewd sexual thing there's a lewd sexual Movement Like a sexual dance and as soon as I saw that I said that's the last time we're watching this and it was the last time we haven't watched that one since and if they have it we've got to have a talk when we get home and I that was a moment where I felt like the fear of God struck my heart like that cannot be in my house and the church said amen it's like the fear of God like and everything else might have been funny and wholesome you know just clean fun on there but when I saw that man do that sexual move like that I said that is not going to happen in my house again because I have to have the fear of the Lord and that was a lesson I had to learn you know that's how we have to do it with with everything in our life you know we have to when we see something like evil like that we've got to make a stand right against it because if not what the Bible says we it's like Samson we start flirting you know with the things of the world right we start flirting and how much evil can I allow into my life but the Bible says walk in the fear of the Lord all day long and maybe that's why you know sometimes in our homes be included maybe we're not happy because we made compromises and we haven't feared God like we ought to because if there ever be ought to be a place where we're happy and I'll be the house of God in our house and I'm guarantee you're gonna be happy at work all the time I know sometimes I don't like going to work either I do it I thank God for it I said I'm not always happy as there but we ought to be happy at home praise God because we can we can create the atmosphere in our house praise God but that was one moment I just want to share with you I wrote down there as I was praying I thought yeah I want to share that one lewd movement like that I said I'm not there's a spirit behind that and think about that church this man did a sexual movement and my little children are sitting right there but before before that I never would everything was good before that everything was fine but see how the enemy tried to get in there and he tries to take he tries to take the boundary a little bit further I remember brother random watched Ten Commandments and River of No Return I don't know what he watched in there so we can't say we you can't watch anything unless it's the Bible we can't say that but we sure do need a lot of wisdom in this hour we sure need the fear of the Lord in this hour I told this story a while ago but one time my brother met with me he was trying to rebuke me for my YouTube Ministry and the fact we had church services on YouTube we were in a Subway and I'll never forget this this guy was he was very zealous for the Lord and I appreciated Zeal the Lord I differ with him on his Doctrine he basically worshiped his brother Branham but we sat there we were sitting in a Subway a small Subway I'm across from him there's probably a line of like three or four people in line it's a small Subway and I said okay brother what you want to meet with me about something and he just he started talking the more he talked he got redder and redder but and then he said that YouTube and when I scroll on YouTube and your videos are on YouTube when I scroll then there's a porn video on there and there's all kinds of things and he raised his voice and he said you shouldn't allow this and I was just sitting there like well I wasn't he he's almost yelling in this Subway and I'm like I'm like embarrassed like but I just let him go he kept talking pretty soon he calmed down he was crying and by the end I of course the whole time I respected it because I knew it was right um YouTube or any video surfing platform can be a real awful thing if you don't use it now what he didn't know is that the reason those videos are on there is because maybe somebody in his family was clicking on that because I don't have any of those bad videos on my feed and I didn't tell them that because I didn't think about it at the time or maybe he was cooking the wrong thing maybe that's maybe he was freshly repented from that but I just want to share that that was another moment where I saw the fear of the Lord I thought that was really good now I let him get it all out and he was he balled me out in front of everybody I mean I'm just taking it like I can't wait for my turn I said dear brother I said you know the reason I did the YouTube Ministry I shared them you know all the four reasons you know I can't travel overseas anymore I got a big family maybe my family will watch it one of my family members did who just died a couple weeks ago you know thank God she got to hear she got to hear it helps me be a better teacher I mean of the word of God it keeps me in the word of God I mean all these reasons and I said we've got testimonies from around the world of people not wearing makeup anymore people being baptized people saying they got the Holy Ghost I said we have testimonies around the world and by the end he's like okay well maybe it's not too bad you know he said maybe that maybe that's okay but I just want to share that that was a real moment of zeal for the Lord and I could tell he really feared God like he didn't really want to see those evil videos pop up on his feet but I told him I said brother that don't pop up on my feet no I'm not justifying YouTube like I've told you before if it's a if you're having a struggle you need to get rid of it I had to pray just a couple weeks ago God help me not to scroll it I wasn't even watching it I was just wasting time scrolling on it and I said God forgive me and by God's grace I still got the victory by God's grace just not wasting time but those were two moments you know I seen that at my house and I said that will not we do not watch that again that man was shaking himself like that no will not do that again that show was out and then this guy just with the Zeal of the Lord with the fervency of the Lord and I thought man I respect that guy right now he's got some false Doctrine but he almost worships brother Brandon but I respect the fact that he has the fear of the Lord when it comes to visual sins and The Temptations now Church what I found is that the goodness of God leads us to repentance and what is repentance repentance is turning from Evil and what is the fear of the Lord to hate evil so the fear of the Lord is absolute major that we need to master by God's grace because it leads us to Salvation the first salvation glory and it leads us through sanctification it even leads us after we get the Holy Ghost praise God because like brother Ram's example like Peter's example won't even eat with different cultures just like these examples we constantly need to live in the fear of the Lord praise God and I'm going to close with this I'm right at one hour yes I'm right at one hour and I told my wife I mentioned I'd just do one hour today I'm really gonna try it so we get up at 4 30. I really need to get home earlier now the most beautiful part of this whole thing to me is that Jesus Christ was anointed with the fear of the Lord and so we just have to look at the Life of Christ and then we will see how uh someone with the anointing of God can walk in the fear of God all day long I was thinking about that yesterday I'm like how in the world could you the Bible says you we would not have enough books to write all that Jesus did and that was just in three and a half years of ministry three and a half years of ministry may God hope that there's just a few pages about my life right and your life I mean you can't even think of all the books we could fit in here the next room the Next Room John says I suppose you couldn't even have enough books that could write all that the Lord Jesus did all the testimonies all the people that he helped that means all throughout the day he was walking the fear of the Lord helping people encouraging people delivering people healing people teaching people right in the temple all the day long but the Bible said he was anointed with the fear of the Lord I'm gonna make sure so here's the verse we started with there shall rise a root a rod out of the stem of Jesse branch the church who's this talking about who is the branch out of Jesse and out of David the Lord Jesus Christ and the spirit of the Lord should rest on him now count this I might preach this on Sunday the spirit Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom the spirit of understanding the spirit of counsel the spirit of Might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord six remember way back in 2018 when I preached the numerology series 6 is the number yes it's the number of Fallen man and beasts but it's also the number of the anointed man Adam was created on the sixth day with full anointing there's not seven or eight pieces of armor with the full armor of God there's six pieces hallelujah hallelujah thank God Amen I want to look at each one of these Lord willing but and shall make him so God shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord in other words he'll quickly recognize evil Hallelujah and he shall not judge look at this he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes that reminds me of Joshua that one time Joshua failed he judged the givenites off of his eyes what he saw instead of seeking God for the Revelation not in his heart and church how many times do we judge things by what we see rather than if you know was that exactly the right thing or was it not neither reprove after the hearing of his ears so he was able to have discernment based upon what he heard and what he saw he could we know the Bible said he could discern thoughts and hearts he knew the very thoughts and intents of our hearts and so with these six anointings on him the Lord Jesus Christ impacted the world and now for the for all of human history but also for all eternity praise God these six anointings oh it's a beautiful picture and so what does Paul tell us walking all honest and all honestly I'm sorry let us walk honestly rather remember honesty is part of uh reverence as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness now we're not doing that we're not riding in the streets we're not getting drunk not in the chambering of lanternness not in the strife and Emmy not here where we might get tripped a little bit strife and being other people but he says put you on in other words get out that get out that anointing oil praise God get out that lotion Hallelujah get off that coconut oil for me got dry skin you got dry scalp he said but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ get anointed and do not make provision for the flesh because the fear of God will make you turn and run away from evil right to fear the lord is to depart evil and not only depart the fear of the Lord is to hate when you sin and do not make an opportunity for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof let's stand to our feet musicians you can come Anointed with the spirit of the fear of the Lord Hallelujah we're so thankful church we have confidence today we're so thankful we have a refuge we saw we're so thankful we have a starting place to get to that tree of life wisdom and we're so grateful we have a fountain praise God today how many appreciate the fear of the Lord let's bow our heads here you know just telling these stories about my life I want to be I want to be more Anointed with the spirit of fear [Music] the spirit of moral reverence especially in the church especially my home my daily life foreign [Music] it's a choice heading into that scripture but the Bible says You must choose to put on the fear of the Lord with our heads about church let's think about our lives here such a blessing we get to do this at least three times a week usually thank you foreign [Music] that spring of fear of the Lord the Fountain of the fear of the Lord that moral reverence profound honor for the Lord Jesus Christ may we say Lord I I honor you so much I'm not going to do this Lord I honor you so much I'm going to depart from this Hallelujah I honor you so much I'm not going to do this again I'm sure like me if you're like me Church you understand that we need reminders about the fear of the Lord the conclusion of the whole matter this is the whole secret to Christianity let's pray together father God I thank you for tonight Lord God lord you put this thought in my heart back on Thanksgiving when I talked with brother William there I drew it all out on the paper I used that paper today I felt led today God to start preaching on this today Lord just as a reminder to me Lord I'm the one that needs ignore God I'm sure we all do but Lord of my heart I know I'm the one that needs the Lord God how would that Zeal all the time where we depart from evil Lord and help us to hate evil help us to hate seeing evil things hearing evil things doing evil things Lord rub it over our hearts and our minds Lord we say rub it all over our shoulders our arms our neck let your anointing Lord be upon us here today we're drawing close to you Lord you see the church Lord I'm not going to ask them to raise their hands but Lord you see which ones Lord are coming close to you now Lord God may you rub your fear on them Lord may you anoint the refresh Lord anoint me afreshold God Hallelujah with a special anointing lord of the fear of God for it will lead me to the Tree of Life Hallelujah it will make me happy hallelujah thank God thank you Jesus it will be a refuge for me dear God we thank you for these blessings we thank you for these promises Lord God Lord tonight we put on the Lord Jesus Christ will not make provision for the flesh Dear God we appreciate your mercy and your love Dear God as we're here in your presence

your promise is yea and amen we're confident you will help us overcome what we're fighting right now Lord God hallelujah we're confident you'll never leave us nor forsake us or we see this great anointing on the Lord Jesus Christ and Lord we know that same anointing could be on us not to the full measure but Lord to a measure to a portion that you've ordained Lord God we want to walk in that full portion Lord God that you have for us today Lord God we want to walk all day in the fear of the Lord so we bless your holy name we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise tonight in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said let's see this little song we choose the fear of the Lord [Music] the Lord fear of the Lord is [Music] come on foreign [Laughter] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]
