[Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] by one door keep going through it keep pressing on a lot of good things happen this time I think I got a lot more power granny actually procrastinating financial support whereas we use that once to get there by God's grace I guess it's all your reading that it did you'd be the first to return confronted him by God's grace this one took actually a lot more faith than the other ones I waited for three months for brother not to make a decision I'm going to go back he gave me the dates for the Randi in Texas found me a cheap ticket I'm very great cheap half the price I ordered it and then within a week Ron had a dream this is I'm not going so I've already got this ticket sitting there and I had no idea what to do I'm like well if you're not going I don't enjoy traveling when I was pretty much gonna go sister Esther who was our interpreter of the first trip came as Dane was us for 10 days at her house she caught wind that I wasn't going and she called the missionary heard the message that she interpreted message and brought hurry and he text me and said no we need you please calm well and then he had me to rearrange the dates and that's how this all numbers 12 this is kind of where my mind set my up press process was on as I went this fine Hebrews 5:12 says for Wednesday for when for the time when you ought to be teachers we have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat so you might my intention servicer was to grace a little bit of meat but obviously they needed the milk more in verse 13 says for for everyone that it uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness of faith but strong meat belongeth to them that are foliage even though it by reason who my reason of use have their senses exercised which are both good so let's bow our heads with amen you're a father aren't you this lonely just love you Lord we thank you for getting everyone here see God lower north they're still standing guard this this work the word you said in this day Lord God they have not left to went back to the denominational in this evil evil food the fresh man of the fresh kill of our day and that's what we feasting on every day voice what we're resting on board that this meat is strong enough to give us strengthen our ego Whedon's godless and lure that we can start laughing don't worry when you start stirring this nest like you have been lording when it's time to make this my door will be ready to fly with glory on when looking for huge things got going Lord you promised it Lord we believe in God and we're going to hold to these things you've given us of the son of Jesus Christ that's just a little personal here of God Lord showing what you've done Lord the door you opened god the favor we've gained entirely or we just love you so much so we had two weeks off work we flew out got flu I'm on a Monday Ohio time I've got there on a late Tuesday yes it was a rainy Tuesday night highlighted so first off I'd like to start back from my first trip probably the second service we did here we have Bill O'Reilly thank God for him God leading him to ask me to go he actually may have found helped me find my position may be my calling I don't know man don't look at the MS it seems like this might be the way to go there Ames I'm not sure the nurses pastor I want an interpreter wonderful sister diamond and then here's the brother Gilbert I met him only by shaking hands and hello I'm God bless you and that was it well in this trip he turned out to be very very resourceful very very helpful by the grace of God I got to go I got to meet him again at this trip but like we said before sister Esther was actually a hired interpreter by the churches back years back and brother Lou Gramm flew in was able to somehow contact her and she was interpreting for him and by her interpreting for him she came to the knowledge of this message behavin and apart well she might be one of the only few Thailand believers in the world by God's grace and I'm aware of well here's the brother right here this is a powerful hit that guy right here he looks I don't know if you can tell me he looks like another bill Cobb from our church net police Phillip cop but he speaks like my grandpa Garza broken up English witness time to go you gog oh brother that's cool you do so that's how he special very very energetic very he doesn't move fast but his voice is Hobbs and actually the only thing with his very voice so he I was walking into the airport trying to find him sister Esther had sent me two pictures of them I I got it now I was very nervous on this trip and I knew absolutely nobody I have no idea when I got into Chicago my wife dropped me off Chicago she left she pulled out and then I went right into dream speak the language I don't even know what's gonna happen I don't even know this missionary guy he's gonna like me and the entire time I felt like I was in a dream why didn't I do it I mean man I gotta go back you know Chuck's from work and I got a I got a jobless man well you know what I didn't do anything I just jump out of that plane and I flew out there and I get off finally arrived in Italian walk out I walk past him he's looking for the smile says hey that's not him I go to the place of designation to meet looked around the drought I don't know where this guy's head where's Yeti I don't know I looked around for about 20 minutes so I got back on my phone and looked at his picture they walked back over this gentleman that from the side of it it's not be here and sure how I go music it's a mouth and then here come find out for the Luke Ram and brother Gilbert are best buds for 20 years but they have a friendship and that's true for the Lutron was staying what it was little Gilbert in this house we stayed there this is mother Gilman's hot little apartment there his wife and the son for the state keep your jewelry the size of this little thing here basic of the dryer that's a good job site when all the stuffs of the walls the drywall is coming in the drywall on it bathroom and at breaktime musical right wall sometimes about where to lay down for this this bit felt like late on drywall so hard so it took me about three nights to get used to it very hard so this Thursday and what they all kind of things much a new era Church a little imitation sister so they started to worship I'm sue back there thanks to God the main purpose of InFocus is it matches what else is there you want if you don't want to do too much you don't want to feed over feed them you don't know how this resume the same time I may never ever get a chance of well by the grace of God he got on me to get into these churches on the radar share the Word of God and that's what we're doing I said brother Luke are you sure you don't want to preach he's a noble of you you okay so he goes up he does a little introduction for me by God's grace he's to be just greeting the people he says made about a missionary company from assignment uh so then I picked up what I thought would be a good thing and since of God I started teaching remember that burial study I on this trip I used every angle I could to teach math every kind of this way that way from this rate from underneath from every kind of way he'll not only just hit the people but to get rid of loop in he's never even brother Lou Gramm was blown away by these teachers he's never sat under a teacher to go verse by verse by verse all right he's a preacher he is a real inspirational preacher he goes up there and doesn't eat dogs he just starts preaching but he's never sat under a teaching ministry thanks God not to brag or anything you know you know what little I do but little my gift is he was blown away just by that just by a tiny little Ohio teacher right he was he would sit on his little he's got a little tablet and as I'm teaching he would he would type everything all my studies together and then he'd send about twelve Springs like listen to this a lot and he was so blown away by the teachers he was sending it all over the world Wallace process so we're able to teach this the pastor's daughter right there nice some lady she married her husband was actually Wow sit in the back there he saw as he was taking the song speak English so did that wonderful boys miss me so as I'm teaching have a look at her say the words say the word look at her and her eyes I was just leaving you know the climax to the end so she was really touched by the Word of God and sinks of God I did that touch the difference between father son Holy Ghost I didn't question I just went Lord Jesus Christ as Lord Jesus Christ did not disagree they were so blessed I guarantee I'll have another bite the daughter was so blown away that afterwards she came up to me like I got like a magnet it said no what no what no what do you think on the speaking in tongues dish Levites only goes she was trying to take it back I said only there's five times they spread the tongue sorry there's five times where the Holy Ghost falls in our backs yes only three and not make it in initial evidence you cannot make it an absolute so she had many questions for me afterwards because she's seen Saints God the things we know the things we've been taught it's brand-new what we played 15 years ago to us something fresh from what I've seen Italian all they teach jesus loves me grace and mercy prosperity back celebration and if you study what we read in Hebrews 5 and 6 when I start out with they are not even pause the very milk foundation it's not even funny everything but really really good here glory the very next day was like to Pattaya well they say patio which is a two hour drive itself this is one that's like a vacation resort town over there we actually drove there the first trip and got to meet this pastor he used to be at the Embassy in South Africa that's how you met as one very intelligent very smart the first time we met Friday night prayer meeting Jesus but most later which reduce himself and Saints I started to teach on the mystery of the Gentile dispensation I have three servants unlike what I want to build something it has a juicy and kinda scripture together his I forgetting elevate teach and then people chatter go first and st. Thomas James I just I've got to the point the first service where I was going to introduce them now to the Gentiles hidden in the Old Testament and I was dealing with this scripture right here you know there's two great mysteries of Bible yes mr. Massad head is a great mystery other great mysteries this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and His Church and as I was going back all the way I was of this what he's the first Eve the second he was within the episode Cory as I was revealing to this something happened there was a huge there was a stairway the one up to the second story were reading and the brothers slept up top there's a stair right there there was a sound like someone's breaking through those stairs and it was so loud when I was when I just revealed that by the grace of God open that up to them the stairs like they're going to explode and then everybody turns it goes Satan was so upset would have come to find out the very floor tile buckled up from underneath and I go alright now this I think this after the service design one day the world has happened the tile started buffer for me and I kept the Satan's foundation is and after the noise stops instant respectful district reverence because what now meets know the word he was hearing thing and it was touching not only it's hard for the harlot who's that so they lined up another service for me but this time of being a hotels and you can see here in the back it's ten if you can't believe Siemens it shot up an angle but the floor is actually coming up now here's where we stayed up in the upper room there of the churches so and the green had desperately Gilbert is back he stepped on that when I stuff on the other one brother Luke round stuff in the other room because he's and this is how we lived right here for about three or four days and brother Luke Brown would come in and start preaching to me know I'm trying to study start recording it on his little little digital device there and send it all over and keep preaching to me he's a preacher wonderful brother no the very next day they let an outreach service and a hotel every morning the churches and they're just the overpaying right here and that's really eat that every morning that's where we had our breakfast so we go to this hotel and here's a group of people Buddhist whatever off the street just got an invitation and they allowed me to teach there by God's grace able to teach them give me a little schoolers to get my Bible started running Scripture and what I hit I hit another angle on that because what else is there we have to get these people to - baptism amen remember of all the steps of grace baptism is the only one that comes with a covenant or promise that's right so we can get up to take that they never promised nolle no God has to do with me please talk to them about half hour 45 minutes out so where's your part there by God's grace there uh go find an interpreter then we had a lot of Prayer afterwards a lot of prayers weeks one all on baptism and eleven people the sight of that you had 14 the first trip this time we had eleven that's great oh it seemed like they hit just at once that's the new you now I want to show this this lady right here - pod - pony used to be a witch gave her heart to God and now everything she touches turns to gold she's actually the hotel manager of the most prosperous for Melanie she has loads loads of money by her daughter draining cars isn't that she's a member of other surf on search she all four of us Sherpa and me and everyone with $300 the first offering I've ever gotten from a lady and she

absolute water she's very serious never smile lady got about one time and after that we went to eat again whatever and she's just in there so we had a wonderful time of fellowship there now the next day was a Sunday both brother sir Ponce and brother pleased you another Sunday school study before careers through the Bible study at 9:30 and I taught on your testimony versus the earth and I went through that whole study brother sir final just blown away good bless where's that go I always run that back to the flood right because remember and the preaching of the word always comes to the prophet and that was inna then what the best of the preachers pick it up which was no one is hard free she and that the world started to crime it bust up the thousands of deep bust up and the world went into repentance but that repentance went right into the earth and the promise showing what in the New Testament again but this time that that's been fire array that whole thing they were extremely blessed they couldn't wait for the next service so we're able to step but what I'm giving them week I'm testing their appetites this church I'm expecting the next time I'm Malou firm has three to four services and next time we go back here by the grace of God Saints the next time Sunday morning we had breakfast again by God's grace toast and jelly next service we went out all again all the people were getting baptized showed up and wonderful service they can worship Saints they love to worship God a lot of female worship or leaders that's all right by God's grace we want to talk I I finished them I was able to bring them up to the Gentile dispensation to the church ages I stopped the right short of crops of introducing prophet I stopped right at churches and at the end of service by the surf on goes have you heard anything like that he said that new comers to come with congregation so I got them to believing the church ages they believed that that was amazing I said brother 10 brightness you have to be able to he's like so after service we went and we went to down to the beach attire there really Gilbert there's a lot of pictures in fact mostly pictures of brother from brother Gilbert another look round thank God here we're waiting fair will show up lining the concrete they're trying to wait on them trying to work out now we make sure we're all repented ready to go I got race the syrup on was really happy with the outcome as well thanks God went to the ocean their ocean one by one we vampires all eleven in the name of Jesus Christ a little nervous who was gonna do the baptisms but brother Luke Oh cousin brother Simon will be doing the bathrooms you gotta be buried amen all power is that name in fact a little bit I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give I'm going to reveal to you by grace you may hear it or know it but I've always had one question on that one mole and the Lord reveal it twenty miles over time grace God so I'm gonna give that that little look at you you may have heard me and I don't know but I've always had one other question what time did that this one as well so we had these baptisms if everyone was blessed of course we know we they are at justified state of essence there is absolutely no knowledge of syncopation no way deep but we had to work with them at their love what do you do you know Philip with unit was one thing they had say they were clean back then that's right very good what do we do here we are just trusting than what we did that's these receipt I don't know what they are but we're trusting these are seeds yes sir and they're believing for a greater walk the baptism I'm very well everyone's happy went back and change the night we drove back from Pattaya back to camp Bangkok then they were able to schedule another meeting you can see you might with my days off for a few weeks October 10th we had a house meeting and I made the biggest house for some reason when I go to finally I end up a blog which I need the last time I went seriously people these people were beyond this this was quite the biggest house that have been the back in a six-car garage into that the front was just monstrous all attached then I was nervous because I knew how much they were and I heard they had ties with many you know Betty his car drove me around the last time well guess who's doing mobsters that many ins people what do you want me to do I do I hit it hard or what do I do and the Lord brought me to proverbs 31 this is from all my fears away and my boss saw when somebody gives me a hard time on the job Chuck Chuck finds out about he's as Simon property was he says give strong drink under him that is ready to perish if the rapture is tomorrow these guys are not there already old as you I'll show you and wine to those that be of heavy hearts let them let him drink and forgiveness poverty just what Alejo is he is lying wretched poor naked visible and they don't even and remember his misery don't is open mouth for the dumb and the cause of all such are pointing to destruction speak fool just in it open thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor II don't think they live in a mansion them prior um beyond richer than they are that's right spiritually revelation we're the wealthiest people on the face yes sir yes sir God said you must strong drink oh why see what they do he said just open your mouth all right lord so I started hittin baths is nice but I brought it in a different angle again and this is it was just a hot that was just a by the time we did got there and I were to have late due to traffic they were already in advance of a study but when they shot when they found out we were there they said they they said alright we want to do another study so blue-crowned gets up there you introducing me and they brother deal what this is best to be a no interpreter really Gilbert did his best to interpret he's an absolute wonder at us let this help to us and now here's the the owner and his wife and if you see up there or they haven't been he's right there they pictured the many hanging in the houses whatever and here I'm touching up on the mystery of baptism wrapping it up in a different angle the fact that I've ever taught us before so I got to teach that by God's grace not caring I just went boulders that could be just hit just taught and at the end of the study you don't know what they're gonna do they could run you out they could know everything was good the old man came up to me this brother right here the old man came up to me in my left ear and he said no sorry my right ear he says he says brother I've heard this before but now I understand on the inside I was just rejoicing because now this man is accountable yes he has his own little group here that called cell groups and he leads that group and now he has to know he's got next choice but you understand the spirit of one thing but not seeing it is enough but when you see it now absolutely so all that well this is sister Suzanne for my first time she does these 60 some years old jesus loves me thinks I'm in the world of me and they were all and one chord very good ever the meeting went very well absolutely then of course the Asian people don't take selfies one camera all right then after that after this meeting you went to another we got invited to another church they the same night big big pastors this is the brother like their old man a lot of these pastors of their old men built their churches for years and years and years highly respected by the other Christians all pastors know each other all respect honor well this is their all church he is just building a brandy he wanted to he's a little proud of his new church which means what you see it you can understand this is gonna be a new church building a couple million dollar house of God and it is bigger than what you can imagine there's a whole upstairs the walls right here after these pillows walls outside of that is always completely window they didn't have a service that day but he said I'm supposed to teach and another cell group when you keep for me so he is welcoming with white old white white open arms and I think I actually have an invitation to preach at his church that grace will see because I taught the same study the angle I pot now we went to the cell group all very very welcome people there we are I'm company Randall trainer before we teach we teach by God's grace start downloading the Word of God and this time saying see that big square here I taught him the seven revelation rock foundations first principles of the gospel just Harlem yes and I use this because if you look at what we started with Hebrews 5 in the beginning right says and then he was six to go to the first principles yes sir and I started teaching on those first principles - and notice there's only six of these principles but the Bible said the st. Paul he said I laid the foundation he doesn't know other as ladies I did the foundation then in another scripture ISA he said and Jesus Christ is the chief Cornerstone of that foundation even Jesus Christ this was Christ I said now when the first church and I started working the first church and I said and then there are six other tiles the Gentiles passed this way I started working and now the foundation and I said when Satan got to some hanging on the hands he started rocking and he ripped that foundation out the church was still full power and he went to another about were some work that dead works and this and that he ripped that one out and this truth will still hold power but when the church finally when he say the start of yield that foundation on baptism let's start rocking and reeling that rock out stripping the people that back to the foundation he found the key to the power yes and when notices but member with the Catholic Church he took that foundation out and then he took his headstone I said I'd called this brother I said any naka industry pieces I said this is sinking sand this is not Baraka foundation I started to I brought it from that angle this brother of these are these are all Trinitarian strict father son Holy Ghost baptism Trinitarian brother I started teaching today teaching to him at the end of the end of the study he said that is the truth even anything did not fight he said so he knows he understands he's God your sister Suzanne oh well just one of those things guys as long as I could mean Balu Craig touching the ITO going to buy guns various and of course you got to eat after you teach us how would they do it over now usually now here's the question got a real to me this after I taught a baptism twice on them seven foundations originally I'm dealing the baptism and I always had this question Romans 6:3 nobody not that many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death okay verse four therefore we are buried with him by baptism into you so what our baptism in name of Jesus Christ represents what the death of Jesus right and they use the name of Jesus Christ because that's the name of the sacrifice right he's the one to die for you right yes when did Jesus Christ get baptized in his name John the Baptist the first hormone to of Jesus Christ into water he didn't say right the father did not say the voice from heaven did not say no he said this is my beloved son right Bal Transfiguration Jesus Christ our Savior reaches adoption but all the father said which is important this is my beloved son well pleased hear ye so where did it take place but look what he's saying here well we're very with him by my bachelor's in two days yes you're very baptized into his death Jesus Christ on the cross

intervening Susie no and after that after that minister Danelle everything I said I lost all confidence with such as a know-it-all and I was supposed to preach at his pastors church that Sunday and because of this it already gotten back to his passion that came through this one they said Simon's it is praying to extremely baptism to extreme to preacher so the next day we're free this brother brother George [Music] somebody she wanted me me to meet him so we all like to meet this brother for the gorge absolute warrior wonderful Christian brother me is Jeff link he's been possible just by chance and he we had fellowship for about an hour sitting in this coffee shop area or blah listen this and he said brother I'm going to he speaks pretty good you know she's I'm gonna go and look at this he wants to spread of church and I hike as well his own branch out you know what he said he said I'm going to look at the building I want to rent and this man and me but look like what he wants to go with you lose your shirt so we just tag along with him so they go to this to this meet the miscibility right brother sister Sarah so we show up at this place and he comes to find out the place he one has already rented out and it's actually now a meeting room and so they had him free feel pretty much prosperity and prosperity and you sure God he'll put you cook out first will give you the desires your Hartnell so then he got done preaching and he end up leaving and then they did their little business meeting MLM multi-level weakened meeting or multi-level marketing but then the main system they had sister there that's actually called that meeting there she found I am with a teacher as well and she wanted me to read chapters notice the shirt on work its Isaiah 40 verse 31 I went up there and talked on the end times just I went into the best I can't any danger Noah days a lot all those things it was a fig tree all those things do all the Tiger all together just best I could by God's grace so Sarah is actually now interpreting for us so he taught as best he could the main sister earning of course they don't have English names sister blast was so blessed she called her best friend and I at the teacher so we went home not knowing anything and sister Sarah and sister bless switch numbers context so then the very next day they called an emergency Bible study they say that thanks of God that morning I woke up and since now sister Sarah's with us in our cooker she was supposed to fly home she had no clothes she had nothing so I had to take her out I bought her clothes because you're supposed to take care of the trigger you know fire food clothing whatever she might be for hotel three or four enough for five nights took care of her there did all those things and then she when we were out shopping she got the Collison cross they want to do emergency right now what and I had put on that evil shirt again look at this place I am rubbing these shoulders with wealthy they called me this place is called the wellington area there's 12 towers all in a circle and in the center it's a resort a three-story pool sauna spa hot tub everything on top looking out until all the towers exercise every one of these towers has its own meteor and I got to teaching the nicest meeting I've ever father I didn't have deodorant on I wasn't ready but I had this shirt on and we waited there right there we're right right there and one sister come up she looks at me she looks at my shirt she says the Lord just gave me that scripture today to read she says and from that point on she wouldn't leave my face she's just like nothing understand the Holy Ghost when we read that scripture my study that what does it mean wasn't me so we did our emergency bottles to me this is sister joy and this is the wonderful the night before sister blessed sister brother a but when he found out my name was Simon he said Peter I'm Peter so I call him a brother Peter this is there this is their group these are for Eagles I guarantee it I taught all the way into the Gentile dispensation they were all just blown away these two I hear these three actually these four here absolutely treated me like a she lives here at the Wellington her husband's very very wealthy they lived there she treated me with Alba most probably the best I've ever been treated my life this brother right here can barely speak English but each with me driving all over he turned to me some these saints of God just being around you guys I got the same feeling the exact same these are real Eagles these have a pastor they were so blown away by this study know not only the disc supernatural thing happen with this history I taught on the seven churches jet compensation and I had written up here this is my board I had seven as a hall over the slide showing the seven the candlesticks uh uh Navin going down with seven times some of this seven that time that and after the study this sister says she said burn assignment one day years ago she had looked at her hand and a scarlet-colored seven appeared on her hand her right hand she goes I wondered about that my entire life I said sister look already sure I looked seven seven seven I said you're probably Brian I said how caught in this rapture boys and then from now these two supernatural things happen they said whenever I come in so these Jesus absolutely love me that right after the study they said we must take you to meet her pastor they took me to meet this brother bill in wand he's the baby of the biggest number of churches in Bangkok 80 church he's the biggest pastor and I got to meet him out of nowhere just got just ordaining in the footsteps yes Lauren just cookie in her place they took me to meet him underneath this pavilion and he he meets me here and there's a there's like a little round table he said sit I sit quick everybody scatters leave me there at home sleep then you just these look at me pacing back and forth almost like you know I'm just kind of smile and all of a sudden he starts talking to me we talked about 40 30 minutes a Sunday he says I'll give you 40 sister Joann runs right up to me as he's saying this is it she was I don't think you ever see what happened here he never talks to nobody he said missionaries nobody he was she was you must be Timothy nespa this is your son you know like in braces he loves me for some reason I just God has given me favor with this brother right here and those four peoples those four my Eagle clan right there so then he arranges me for Sunday night I'm free to teach at his truth God just opening doors so also that night we got to know eight I think it's the next thing I got to go to another cell group meeting I thought I should be on the free stuff I did it there's a little song worship some prayers and then this brother right here is the leader of it in the blue big man okay he started hitting Catholic Church there Protestant I said you're positive he said yes brother I said you know what that means you do I think so I know we protest the Catholic churches and yes yes so then I waited he started dropping bombs on the great of Babylon and I waited for a moment and really good with some practices so I started dealing with with first Timothy for showing the doctrines of the any day is doctrines of devils not abstain from meat forbidding to marriage and I just brought that and your scorn well what is this they have never he taught against the Catholic Church further he said like four or five years and they never even heard the scripture then I was able to show them why in the Catholic Church quit letting the priests in area because in two thousand five two thousand four I was sitting listen to NPR radio station and a man died even though burns comes up and he was given that they were interviewing it means that he's an actor but he's Catholic he said I was raised up in the other order of the Jesuits the opposite order reasons but I learned all the history of the judgment he says he's saying it's over here he said you know what they taught me he says it's right over there he's done I'm just saying I'd like to turn it up like he said he said the reason the Catholic Church quit having a priest marries is because if the priest would die early the church would have to pick up and take care of a wife and children so he did it to save money so that was really good as well so they gave us an interpretation invitation to come to their church on Sunday mornings we went to their church Sunday morning by the grace of God so we had a little nice little service there God did got throw away some nuggets things by God's grace so then we went to this is an this is called the book of Acts church on Sunday so we met their pastor we weren't allowed to preach but he taught on grace by the grace of God so that's the passion trees are all businessmen businessmen that are preachers so there's a pastor right there a little crew there we sat down in appreciation grace you're good we ain't and then we went to service I brother wants church and this is their main headquarters right here had a wonderful time they can worship very well by God's grace they love God for their sister laughter there is two verses back here so they gave me 45 minutes we weren't there and we taught and trying to bring it right back to baptism but I didn't anything I just kind of want to give him I just I don't wanna get doctrine I want to get white is that one a little more favored because I know that happened bad he said he'll have you back next time I come so I just wanted it a little bit I wouldn't hit and when I taught on your chest and they burst of the earth again I taught him that and that was things of God that wasn't even a little too deep for that if you can imagine if you can imagine the mind Center this this area they're just not taught the Word of God so actually to go back and explain even the system join Joann and sister less about what that and bring her tight again through and try explain to it and they took me out to dinner after that sister Joanne Stubbe Weston brother Peter and then and there I was able to explain one more time and say oh not like now I see so we're able to do that we had another I fly out Monday morning so they had another they wanted to get together again that night so he went now this is another media group they had when them towers everyone's done with decorated different beautiful just amazing the loop reign in the revelation area sticking hungry sister Johanna asked some questions just hit the scriptures you know listen this then she actually took me up to her apartment but something she was Simon you're the only corner I've ever let in my house she says if it wasn't for that shirt you wore he's in the I she said I would even talk to you because she don't trust formulas so God has given me tremendous favor with these things I believe these are Eagles but appear they're even gives me just loves me and he's a he is just a wonderful time fellowship at the end of this day they dropped me off at midnight I didn't fly up till 6 a.m. I said I want you guys waking up at 3 or 4 just drop me off at midnight ok but before that we have two hours of the final study just question after question feeding they wanted this group here this is all summer balcony you can see the big pool way out here whole entire they wanted me to postpone my departure another week so they could just stay with that group before and your mom said it was a long day yes well I can't so Stacy God the Lord has given me much press very prosperous but Lou Gramm s full confidence in this hey man in fact the next trip he's already drawing it out for me he's a scribe in fact his first dream he said God came to him and he lifted him up and put him on a high table a chair he said they said Lord what am i what am i administer over my mister of finances and my ministers and the Holy Ghost he says you're a minister to your team chemistry which he said was and something to do with postage and something to ascribe you or something like that so what he does is he he does internet witnessing rewrite call as soon as downloads from the years and she come out that every person he's ever met you know it's all information but then he's also possible he's practice started 20 or 30 churches themselves he's a rewarder of God so now the next meeting it has end of March this is flying to Bangkok we're gonna head down to diet for three days meetings come back up then we're gonna fly to Vietnam and he has five churches and wasn't to preach at for a week in Vietnam end up in Ho Chi Minh City and fly back he said then go back to go go to idle so that's my next trip by God's grace we're praying on it he says he said brothers if you don't come back but I guess he's really blessed by the teaching so anyhow that's about it please keep these four Eagles in your prayer brother Stewart on companion thanks of God I believe these I think these are super right here I really believe the way this scheme the date they love me they treat me like royalty absolutely so but that's about it but I gots grace but that was that comes the two weeks ago was a blessing I believe we've accomplished a lot more this time laughs I have just as many invites to come back though now
