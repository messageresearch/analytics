that's my fault he's really been practicing by God's grace so I'm gonna appreciate his willingness to step in and serve so while you're turned uh we're gonna do Revelation 3 verse 7 we just like to look at that one verse tonight we're just gonna look at that thought that I mentioned a few weeks ago about the gospel versus the word so we look at that thought tonight by God's grace real beautiful thought I just was really blessed by that thought and then we'll get into a few other things like I said the Deacon requirements and church voting everything like that praise the Lord so this all deals with the open door so we'll look at this here let's read that we'll just read this together by God's grace on three one two three and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy either that's true either had the key of David either openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth amen let's have one more word of Prayer as we bow our heads here Heavenly Father were grateful for this opportunity to be in your house Lord God thank you for the songs we can sing Lord we worship Your Majesty tonight we remember how powerful you are you're the king of kings lord of lords and father we sing this song Lord what will it be when we can be there with multitudes of angels with multitudes of believers and we crown you Lord of all what will it be like that my father what a wonderful thought that is for us here tonight Lord God we're small in number here but just like Eli she found out or his serving a haze' found out there's more with us angels and there are with the sinners so God we're so grateful Lord Jesus for the heavenly company and for the heavenly family the heavenly support that we have the heavenly hosts that's with us here tonight we're grateful for your mercy love Jesus teach us tonight through thy war and Lord as we look more at this open door and I pray your spirit will be with us in a special way in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you me and see the praise God alright so Malachi can switch over whenever you're ready by God's grace or Lydia whoever's back there sorry one more announcement here before we start I received some really good instrumental music from brother of on carrion in New York his daughters and some of the sisters in the church there have some beautiful absolutely beautiful instrumental music you've been listening to it at home it's just I mean as soon as we play it just kind of creates this beautiful atmosphere at the home so I have I think I have 10 copies of this one now 15 copies of this one 10 of this one so brother Vaughn said they'll send me some more of this one but I have in my office so if I forget I'm sorry I don't have my office I'm right here so I'm gonna set it right here hope I don't forget to give them to you after service by God's grace but every family an individual can get both you're gonna love them they are just beautiful so and I said can I pay you for mother Ron's like no this is just a Ministry of our church you know he's just a servant of the Lord you know he he's probably I mean imagine the money these costs are professionally made you know probably costs thousands and thousands of dollars but that's the kind of brother he is he's just a real gracious and giving brother and that's just quite a testimony there brother Vaughn so if I forget you know pardon me is that not coming sorry about that let me try it again so I just want to remind you about that by God's grace [Music] okay thank you so we're on the Philadelphia Church H all this were getting married from airwest but this is part 7 and part 47 in the series so we're happy about that we're almost if 50 which is a Jubilee and I guarantee I have a Jubilee when we get to 50 by God's grace whether in my house or here I'm gonna have a Jubilee because God is so good to us and we're very thankful we read our text here now we'll just look at our summary tonight well the Braja brother Adam summarized this portion of Scripture and I'm gonna just turn there real briefly we look a little bit more at the open door like I said I'd probably take half the sermon I'll just set my timer for an hour I'll probably take half the sermon look at the open door and I'll take the other half to look at deacon requirements by the grace of God how many do that brother branham said the deacon office is more strict than any other office in the church how many knew that the deacon office is more strict than the pastor that's what brother Brahim says so brother Adams looking to be a deacon and I'm I'm already a deacon so I've got the strictest office plus other offices so I got to make sure out real strict with that office and you'll see why you know in the scripture you'll see why it's because he's guarding the word he's got to guard the word anyways we'll get to that so let's look at the summary brother Graham says now this is the age the Philadelphia church age is the age of brotherly love the great missionary age of the open door and the reward was a pillar being made a pillar and the revelation of three names the name of God aren't you glad you know the name of God today Lord Jesus Christ the name of the City of God New Jerusalem and God's new name which brother Graham tells us we won't know until the new heavens the new earth when he reveals his new name people like the guest today and say it's William Mary and Branham or Branham Christ and all this false doctrine it's just awful but brother Graham tells us it won't be revealed until the future home so I'm willing to wait if you are Amen I don't want to inject anything into God's plan I'll just wait until God reveals it praise God and brother have said is the revelation that was given to this church so I want to bring out now some quotes I mentioned it about two N's days ago brother Ram said there's missionaries with the gospel of paper and tonight I've got the gospel of paper tonight we have these tracks out there this is the gospel of paper passing out tracts here but I have nothing here this is the gospel of paper and the missionary age the Philadelphia church age was big on this just like many people are today brother Graham is gonna say over and over as we go through these quotes he said nothing against this nothing against passing tracts that's part of he's that's part of the gospel you have to have the gospel in the word form he calls this the word form where he says the gospel on paper you've got to have Bibles how many appreciate your Bible I do right in fact the age where they didn't have any Bibles was the darkest church in time to know that Thyatira it was the darkest church age because they didn't have the gospel on paper so you and I should say Amen that we've got the gospel on paper because now we can check is that preacher tell me the truth or do I need to bring correction now you can no but see they it's important but this is actually not the most important part of the gospel we know the gospel with power is the most important part so look what he says here brotherly love the RAM said it was a great age of missionaries and missions the world has never seen a time it even goes over into our time now seen the time I'm sorry now when the world ever seen such a time of missionaries everywhere oh I'd say the last hundred 50 years it's been one of the most outstanding times of world history for missionaries getting into all parts of the world with the gospel as far as I look at this point now he starts breaking in this thought now pay attention I hope those colors yeah those look okay they look really bright on my screen but they look really good there I think hopefully that's okay so I just want you be able to read it he said now as far as literally just going sending the gospel on paper don't you appreciate a voice of God for making these I don't agree with all their doctrine because now they got doctrine but I do appreciate how they make the gospel on paper and they do a fine job they do a high quality job he says and tracts and books and so forth the gospel has long ago went to every nation under the heavens long ago so the world every nation has already received the gospel on paper but how come the end of the world hasn't come yet or the Rams gonna tell us it's because the power of God has not been preached in every nation and this is our job now this is what Americans should be doing sending missionaries to every country to preach the power of God now just send paper there but take take the written epistles there praise God take somebody who's a written epistle who's a living epistle who's has the Word of God written upon the tables of fleshly hearts and I'm gonna list about four missionaries I know that have supernatural vindication so God does have some but you know we need some more by God's grace need some more so you see that goes to prove that that wasn't what Jesus was talking about he never said go into the world now look that never he never said go in the world and build a Bible School he never said that well Graham and neither did he say go into all the world and pass out literature right he never said that those things are what do you say fine now some people there are some quotes her brother Bram he kind of gets a little harsh on people that do this but what he's just trying to make a point like this is not all we should do we should have preaching we should pray for the sick we should preach to divine healing we should see miracles amongst the believers aren't you glad we see him from time to time do we want to see more absolutely I feel like we should see more but we're glad for what we see but he said Jesus never said actually to do this he said to girl go and preach amen now here's the scripture where it's this one hasn't been fulfilled because the word preached he's going to tell us later means to demonstrate the supernatural power of so bro I'm sorry Jesus says this in Matthew 24:14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached into all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come praise God so see we are not going to see the end of the world until the Holy Ghost gospel with supernatural vindication is preached to every nation and we've got some merry we've got some very violent nations don't we North Korea right use our name in Saudi Arabia Iraq Iran where they will literally kill you if you go there and preach so what are we waiting we're waiting for the leadership of the Holy Spirit to get in there you said brother Jess they should be in there by now well not necessarily it all depends on the leadership of the Holy Spirit because remember the Holy Spirit drove the Christians out of Jerusalem remember that in the book of Acts Holy Spirit drove them away in order to scatter the gospel so there might be a time and season we're waiting for for God to send the messengers and the preachers apostles into certain nations we're waiting for the times it sees it right because remember brother Adam said don't get off set if the rapture has taken place he said there's nothing wrong with God God's right on time tonight don't get all upset nerves like oh it's our fault you can't lay any charge to the God's elect you can't say for the bride's fault you can't lay any charge to the bride of Jesus Christ amen she's doing all she can do she's waiting for God to open the door to Iran amen to open the door to Japan in fact it's just being open right now amen Vietnam right now Simon's get ready to go in there by God's grace they'll kill Christians and he's going in there and may by the grace of Lord that's his plan right now you're talking about we need men of faith don't we but more than that church what Abraham say is the the reason for all his success the prayers of the saints that's why you and I have to pray for brother Simon praise God that's why you and I had to pray for all the missionaries amen if I felt a burden to go I would go I feel burdened a pastor aren't you glad you have a pastor as soon as I feel that leadership to go I'm gonna go one now God does raise up another pastor so I can go amen but I gotta have the time and ability but right now I feel led to pass through this church amen and I have for the last 11 years and you get the decide if I get to do it one more year on Sunday so you get to decide if I'm going to Pastor and the year by God's grace it's the leadership of the Holy Spirit so see buh-bam saying the word has already gone to every nation the gospel and paper form it's already been gone it's gone to every nation now with the internet now the word in digital form the preaching in digital form can go to every nation but we need preachers there that will preach the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit and it's going to happen now let's look more of this thought he keeps going back to this song now we have taken this age right here where we are tonight on the Philadelphia Church age in that age there evangelize and as missionary all the complete world with literature it's our in that age of John Wesley it reached every nation with literature Jesus said when this gospel is preached all the world for a witness unto me then the end shall be well then if that what was he was talking about spreading out literature sending out missionaries with reading writing arithmetic and passing out tracts and making people shake hands and believe that there's a God if that was all was that he's far past his coming he says uh-huh so it shows that the gospel he said Paul said the gospel didn't come in word only but through power and manifestations of the Holy Ghost we're waiting for apostles to get so anointed with the Holy Ghost that they're not scared of machine guns at the airport when they land on in a foreign country and the church said we're waiting for missionaries filled with the Holy Ghost that don't care if the population is Muslim and they kill Christians but they walk in here and walk through the gates we'd say at the airport they walk through there and say I haven't come here by my power I've come here in the name of Jesus Christ that's already boy that's the gospel and power right now you have a lot of gospel literature which like I said we're grateful for that but what we're waiting for we are we should be praying for is for God to anoint somebody who's fearless now how about us now we should be fairly fearless at our jobs I should be fearless right we should be fearless at the grocery store we should be fearless everywhere we must have that same desire amen he said that when Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel he said go into all the world and demonstrate he said oh I like that demonstrate the power of the gospel taking the word he said that what it says and show the people when it says and then make it manifest to them oh that's the way that proves it so we have this idea of other Ram said that word preached Jesus had preached all nations that word preached means demonstrate the power of God and of course you can't do that without a gift of God you have to know your gifts you have to know what God has called you to do and then you get in the channel of that and then God will bless your gift amen now this is the scripture boat program is quoting I'm sorry it's so small but I want to fit it all on one slide and brethren this is first pertains to one brother and when I came in to you I came not with excellency of speech or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God so see Paul was not a fine-toothed scholar Paul was not a eloquent speaker Apollo's was how many number that Apollo's was very fine he was just like so articulate and he was so wonderful to listen to but Paul said I didn't come like that so what does that show Church that shows God has all kinds of preachers some are very perfect and eloquent they never spit on you they never raise their voice they're just so eloquent and so just so now they look like an archangel up there then you got others up there that look like the Rams that they got bulldog faith he look like a bulldog they got bulldog faith and they stand there with the gospel and they take God at His Word because God is a God of variety I've always thank God for the riot e we have here just of nationalities you know I just love that you know Asian African American what else Chinese yeah a man thank you we got I just love the variety with the same and true with preaching Paul said I wasn't the most eloquent man he said but one thing I had he said I tremble look at that he said I trembled at the Word of God now we're gonna get to right here for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling so Paul was voice he was trembling before God saying God guide me by the Holy Spirit help me not to get caught up with wisdom help me to get caught up with the power of God and that's a missionary now remember he's a prophet he's a missionary and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the Spirit and the power Amen that your faith should not stand the wisdom of men but in the power of God so that's what brother Adam says this is what Jesus meant when Jesus had go preach to all nations he was talking about demonstrating the spirit and demonstrating the power amen thank you Jesus hallelujah now now let's look at the gospel of power brother Graham brings it out just a little differently he said they opened up many doors during that age the Philadelphia Church age the door of the gospel the door to the mission fields the door back to Christ and everything was opened during that age and you can see what they did the brethren done a great job out of it so although it was just the word the gospel in paper form at least they did a good job with it praise God whatever you're called to you whatever I'm called to let us at least do a good job of what we're called to do like brother Branham said you know whatever you're called you'd be the very best at it be the best father you can be but be the best teacher you can meet be the best student you can be whatever you are be the best you can be he's sending from John Wesley the star after the Sardis age after he come over waking him up from the Sardis a teachin from the past 150 years he said great missionaries like of no other time or age before has covered the entire earth think of that every nation on the heavens has heard the word it completed many many years ago see but not the gospel just the word the letter killeth but the spear giveth life so now he calls he call it first the gospel paper and now he calls it just the word if we just have the work if you just have a Bible like I said having a Bible is wonderful but we want to see the Bible live grace God want to see this Bible whatever God said we want to see God live it out right that's the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit now brother Graham told a story about three people that went overseas and did missionary work a young boy and two young girls and then he makes this statement afterwards so I'll just I'll just sorry I was listening to the story this morning on the way to work so I'll just rehearse it brother Graham said he was boarding I think he was going to Rhodesia I think if I remember right he was getting on a plane he saw some Americans and he looked at their passports he said you American yes he said where you from he said over from Kentucky perhaps no you're just in my backyard I'm from Jeffersonville Indiana and he said you wouldn't be that brother branham he said yes I am that brother branham and he said that cured him right there so in other words I didn't want to talk to him anymore and he said the guy brother I said can I talk to you about some principles of the gospel and they said sure he said he said he said we're missionaries he said we're both missionaries he said can you in the name of the Lord Jesus put your finger on one soul that you won to Christ in three years and they said no no but Ram said I hate to discourage you he said I appreciate what you're doing he said about you two ladies should be helping your mommy in the kitchen at home because a woman is not to go out and preach right and he said he and then he gets into the story of how they hadn't won a soul in three years and yet how he went there and he said we say hundreds or thousands gave their life to Christ amen and though now he tells his story afterwards because he was saying how they were Methodist and they weren't born again they didn't believe in holiness that believin supernatural and so see they're trying to do God a service but not doing it according to the Word of God nobody's got a business going in the fields unless they receive the Holy Ghost and the preaching the power demonstrations because it's the only thing that'll move those people and look what uprisings you got now and everything it's because that the true gospel has been preached to them been given to them in the word form well see what that is that's the continuation of the escape one of the Luther's age where give the world the free press that's right or the free Bibles you see that church that idea that Luther had where they were having the printing press and their print out the bibles that just carried over to the philadelphia church age which it was a good thing but jesus one of them to have the open door of the name of jesus christ the power of the baptism right the power of the deity of of the supreme deity of jesus christ and the supernatural power of the name of jesus so see they hadn't really gone on into the power they were carrying over the idea from from from Luther's age of the gospel and paper form now watch the time coming after the great missionary move that swept across the nations a brotherly love to what they had nothing against it seen he's not saying it's ok it's ok to have it it's ok nothing against this of literature whatever more in the different parts of the world now the church denomination has gone back to education and works again they've gone back so see most churches when they go overseas they just do this or they just build a hospital or which is good like I have a friend who is the part of World Vision I'm gonna hurt a World Vision they you know so my friend I I was talking to him a few weeks ago on the text I love this guy he runs marathons and they raised money so they can take that money over to Africa and then dig wells that's a wonderful thing I mean it's a better than I made a donation well I wanted to support him I think that's if you're willing to run 26.2 miles the give people water and hygiene that might die otherwise I'll support that there's nothing wrong with that that's part that's part of the gospel but if that's all they're doing they're leaving out the other part of it praise God they have that literature or they have schools or they have hospitals that's fine but the main part of it but most of them won't even preach the other part the part of Paulo baby the part of the Holy Spirit coming upon the people getting them to repent come to Christ and see God for miracles they have they don't breach that part this is just part of it it's a good part that wasn't what Jesus said though Jesus said you must preach and he said these signs will follow them that believe amen so here's the four missionaries I know that supernatural vindication brother Maxwell Lee I preached for him four times in South America American he pre-shared one time back in 2014 he was here 2014 i always remember because it was one year before we moved into our thirds right here we moved in here in the fall of 2015 so maxwell Utley he said some of the most supernatural cases I've ever seen when they've done been doing missionary work he walked into a house that had demons in at one time and a demon-possessed person was running at him and when he got there the Holy Spirit on brother Maxwell flew through the man up against the wall and then fell down and then he walked into room where a woman was levitating laying on a bed and instantly she fell down under the bed and woke up revived the Holy Ghost was casting out demons just by him walking into the room what is he Church he's a missionary he goes all over South America preaching and sharing this message you know you don't have to ask him about the power behind this message this message has power and in a pen he said another time they were preaching one time in a park I think I told you this but I'll share it again for Sierra's sake you know for my children too we can't forget these testimonies in the book of Judges they forgot the Bible said they didn't tell the next generation all about God and so the next generation grew up and didn't know the testimonies so you and I have to tell the testimonies of Christ or else these children aren't going to know about the power of God until they experience it themselves he said they're on a park and they were preaching they're having service and there's a big crowd of believers you know none believers and a man walked up to the crowd a big old muscle man I said where's the pastor and all the people in the church got scared and said there is any and it was just like the maniac that came up to brother Branham and he said you need to stop preaching all these things and brother Maximo said the man pulled his fists back to punch him and Maxwell he said in his mind he reverted back to his tighter his martial arts training and he was going to do a sidestep trip him and throw him down because that's what he's trained to do he was like he was into martial arts his whole childhood he said in before he could even move he said the Holy Spirit threw the man down at his feet and held on to his feet and he was pleading for forgiveness just like brother happened to brother branham and he's telling me this with tears coming down his eyes Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever most recently he said oh I'm seeing our testimony and he gave me a voicemail my whatsapp my whatsapp app he's sheriffs testimony they went into Jonesboro no that's not Jonesboro it's that I'm sorry it's that city where they had that mass killing in Guyana who members that remember Jim Jones remember that where they Jane where they drank the kool-aid the poison kool-aid I don't remember the city in Guyana many ways they went to that City last year preach the gospel and brother Maxwell said a whole gang of sinners repented and all got baptized in Jesus Christ's name and he said they went back this year and built a church therefore and I think there was a thousand people that died in that mass killing in 1977 remember that well I mean we must some of us weren't live I wasn't alive but I remember reading about it okay and we just passed the anniversary a few weeks ago I remember I saw it on Facebook and they were trying to encourage people to stay away from cults I'll say amen to that stay away from any call where a man will tell you to kill yourself and your there's going to be a an alien rapture or something like that you know that's awful it's he's evil anyway so see they're having dramatic soul saved dramatic signs america's wonders God still has apostles today men glory Don frog he's from Minnesota he does a lot of prison missionary work he goes too easy was he's in Africa right now actually I just saw his post I don't know him but we've got we wrote by letter and email and he just posted on Facebook he went to a city in is it Swaziland is that the way to say Swaziland sister okay thank you he went to little village in Swaziland and they took a picture with the woman who was paralyzed six years ago they prayed for her they left a few weeks after they left she was instantly healed and they went back this year and got a picture with her six years later and she's all smiling and happy the paralyzed walk by the power of Jesus Christ want to take it took a missionary to go there with power Amen hallelujah that's what I like and they still go they ditch their you prison work they go in prison and they try to win souls they if you have any extra message books let me know send in the Minnesota because they send them into prisons all the time Craig Brewer of course most of us know brother Craig he's going to Japan right now and he was telling testimonies of people that were sick with headaches or different I forget the healed illnesses but he was telling testimonies they prayed for them and they were instantly healed right there in Japan just this year about the grace of God brother Jason to Mars he's goes into I'm sorry he goes into Turkey I believe it is and has done some work in Iran and he wrote a whole book about how God is moving in Persia ancient Persia which is modern-day Turkey modern-day Iran and there's numerous miracles of them receiving healings of having dreams and prophecies come to pass proving that our God is alive and well amen now those are missionaries I know of course I don't know many people there's probably hundreds more going around the world now I put this up here but let's not forget the the quotes of brother Branham here if we want to see more power and accurate we've got to be more sincere because mother have said sincerity brings power we must consent confess our sins because that will bring faith and then faith works by love and then if we've got love it will cast out all fear so we can have faith right and then we must pray we must pray down the blessings of God brother Branham said we must pray first and then we'll receive a revelation of healing or revelation of a prophecy the trouble is most people don't want to pray you can say men then they get about a man most people don't want to pray most people don't most people hardly you want to come to church on a Wednesday night let's say they believe the message right I many do they just can't maybe travel with you know schedules or whatever more but at least they should be live-streaming right and then brother Branham said if you got the Holy Ghost you you're in the word all the way you're gonna be in the preaching your love all the preaching of the word of God that's the evidence that you got the Holy Ghost that you want to hear all the word that's being preached by the Holy Ghost today let me close with this here for this half of the sermon Hicks I'm at 32 minutes I got that was worked out really good not half way Jesus first Commission to the Apostles was for Supernatural Jesus's last Commission and the Apostles was for Supernatural this is his last words he said when he left the earth he said these signs shall follow them that believe his first Commission to the church what was it Matthew 10 heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead freely you receive freely give or as God shows you you do what he said do the last Commission of the church was the same thing the last words that fell from his sake her lips as he was going up going to the all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in mine they shall cast out Devils now look at this next stop here look at this next word he said oh here's the sign of a believer we said we say this or Chris or Church members say this oh here's a sign of Leever he goes at the church he's a good man he pays his debts well the RAM said that's fine are nothing to say about that he has a educators children that's Danny I have nothing to say about that he said but that's not the sign of a believer even to preach the gospel is not a sign of a believer jesus said these signs follow the believer amen so you must do all these other things but on top of doing all that on top of all that you must have the supernatural power of God in your life that's the sign of a believer see you've got all the word operating in your life hey Laurie in my name they shall cast out devils they speak with new tongues they take up serpents they drink deadly things will not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover hey I don't you love that amen that's Jesus first Commission in Matthew 10 it's his last Commission in mark chapter 16 that these signs follow them that believe amen now we've been over that numerous times so I want to go to this thought and then I'll go to the Deacon thought I said this on Sunday night after brother Simon for each how many enjoyed his serve services wow that was beautiful that was such a wonderful day of sermons you know if you didn't listen that you you really would like that by God I think everybody here maybe you did most people here did you'll really be blessed by those sermons there by God's grace now here's the endtime condition let me go back to that when I was trying to do I was trying to string together a chain of scriptures to show how awful the conditions are spiritually in this age and you and I have got to overcome them and we will only by the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will turn our hearts back to Paul Peter back to st. John the Holy Ghost will turn our hearts back to the Apostolic fathers but look how wicked look at this string of scriptures I got about seven scriptures look how wicked this hour is that we live in the first one Jesus said because the Nick WA T shall bound the love of many shall wax cold so in other words there'll be many that will have no real love how many ever I may see it on a daily basis there's no real Christian love right and why is that why is there a lack of love if you see people in the church center that don't reach out and love anymore or they're not really active in the church or they don't when you shake your hand don't really feel out of love why is that there's a Nick WA T in their lives how many understand that because of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold when you don't feel like coming to shake brother Jesse's hand at church something's wrong you got some iniquity in your life right when I don't feel like coming to shake your hand or give you a hug if you're a brother if we don't feel that love it's because iniquity got in somewhere right you were enticed you were drawn away by your own lust and now you can't even love the very people that are the body of Jesus Christ how could you not love the body of Jesus Christ because you've got sin in your life that's exactly right that's what Jesus said because iniquity of boughs because people just get more and more bound in their sins they don't love anymore they don't have the real love of Jesus Christ now tie this in let's do a chain let's chain that up with this scripture start seeing this link of truth this this chain of truth all through the scripture and except those days should be shortened now look at this church can you get can we wrap our minds around this there shall be no flesh even saved so in other words there's going to be less people say as we draw closer to the end we're gonna see less people saying now I'm not trying to create I hope you understand this church I'm not trying to create an humbly I not in other words I don't want you to come and say well I guess nobody's gonna get saved today I don't want you to have that attitude I want you to have an attitude of eight and you will have your bread but we have to understand as time goes on where it's less and less people actually get saved because Jesus said I've got a short in two days or else no one will be safe because it's gonna get last and less and less two years harder brother daughters say they had ten days of meetings in it South Africa he said an eight souls got saved I mean we're talking in we're talking about where the field is supposed to be right with harvesters that eight people he said he had all these are the preachers he named that went in through and very coffee all these brothers you know that we've heard all that we love their ministries ten days of services and eight people got sick 8 and Jesus said I've got to shorten it or else Nolan will be saved how many understand we're living in a dangerous time because Jesus said because the Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it jesus said this 2000 years ago few would find it well what is it gonna be today with Adam if it was few and in 2,000 years ago what's it gonna be today now sring these three got you you see the chain Milton here I'm building a chain I'm tying these thoughts together so you understand how awful this time is and nobody you see and I want you to think well it must be Jessie's fault I don't want you to think that well must be the piano players father unless we must not blame other people it's Satan's fault and it's the fault of the people letting sin abound in their lives without repenting Amen show me where I'm wrong or show me where these churches where the best show me whether message churches are wrong in their preaching they're not wrong they're right the problem is people are loving sin more than they're loving God amen that's the problem because Nick witty abound the love of many shall wax cold in wax it's increasing more and more there's less real love for God they lose their love for the church so they don't come to church they lose the love for you so can't even call me on your birthday or you don't just sit on me they don't love you they can t put a little happy birthday on Facebook or something you understand what I'm saying the church can't even say happy birthday just that's the little thing now what about if somebody's poor don't have any money and nobody will give them any money we're supposed to be a family if I know you would ever need I'm gonna help you if I don't either I don't know about it I forgot or I got sinned in my life and that can only I couldn't be the only choices right the Bible said in James chapter 2 if you see someone destitute of food and clothing and you don't help them and say oh I have a warm night and you don't give them a coat your faith is dead pead dead and the church said if you see somebody that don't have a car you can go to church if you don't help them to get their car fixed or you don't offer them a ride to church I might imagine and say your faith is really weak I won't say dead but I would say it's getting pretty weak now you can't force somebody to come to church but did we try to meet the needs of the church how can we say we love the body how can we say we love Jesus if we don't love who Jesus created oh yeah James said you can't you can't love Jesus who you can't see you can't love him without loving those he created glory I don't really have that in my notes Oh hallelujah amen that must be for us now now here's number 4 we're making a change let no man deceive you by any means so don't let even me if I fight to preach a false doctrine and I need corrected don't let anyone deceive you for that day shall not come except there come up falling away first remember jesus said that tears must be bowed what first before the rapture first the tears must unite in their ecumenical council and they must all fall away into apostasy first buying the tears first then gather the wheat to my garner hey then have a met have a meet up in the air the dead in Christ will rise first then we which are alive and remain shall go with them to meet the Lord in the air but first gather the tears and let them be fallen away into apostasy 'he's exactly right do you see the picture that the bible is painting about the end times I think that's another video I want to do I want to do a video about the end times and if people can't see that's today they're totally blind they're on their way to hell I hate to say that but if they can't see this is the condition of churches I'm not talking about sinners I'm talking about churches churches that say they're the mouthpiece of God but if they're lukewarm Jesus has already spewed them out and they're no longer talking for Christ I'm glad we can talk for Christ tonight amen and if he loves us he'll rebuke us amen it's not fun and I got a quote from this sermon and Philadelphia sermon 1960 where brother have said woe to me if I don't rebuke denomination woe to me if I don't bother the churches he said if I did it he said Jesus would he said I hate to do that he said I hate to feel like I'm picking against women not immoral women not good me or immoral men's I'm picking on men's immoral men right it's immoral churches he said it but if I didn't preach them woe unto me Paul said right how many know the book of Revelation there's three woes we know that so in other words Paul's saying woe unto me the woes the judgments of God are going to come upon me if I don't tell people the truth of the gospel woe unto me if I don't bring some basketball program said Jesus will send me to hell I don't preach against those denominations there has to be a defection there has to be an apostasy where people literally turn from the truth of the scripture just to believe whatever they want I'll just believe whatever I want they've totally turned their backs they've defected from the faith they turn their backs and the Bible said they trample underfoot the Son and fresh that they were what sanctifies how many know that Scripture okay scripture number five on the chain I mean oh brother have said every soul hangs on a chain over hell and every chain is only strong as its weakest link there are no weak links in God's Word so you and I might feel the heat sometimes the trials and the fiery trials of our faith but one thing we know our chain will never break amen because we don't preach any half-baked biblical doctrine all of our doctrine is straight from the Word of God amen hallelujah and this NOSSA than the last days perilous times shall come which means hard to bear dangerous savage I mean I always say it's hard to bear some of these trials that we face they're savage trials it's savage people are savage right they've know no regard they can't recognize the presence of the holy ghost get recognized when they need to repent can't recognize the Word of God it's a savage time number six now look at this this is what I was saying less and less people saved because the preachers are getting worse and worse and more seductive and more tricky but evil men and seducers shall wa increase or wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived jesus said I've got a short in the days that there are left before Armageddon right or the tribulation I have to shorten these days or else no flesh can even be saved that's the awful condition that we're living in right now and that's why I as a pastor I got to stand here and when you have been and all the faithful church members all the ones that really love the word have to hear me continually ball out the same sins that people the church do and I'm sorry you have to sit through it we just pray for them but if I let that go on and don't tell them it's wrong guess what God's gonna make me and the day judgment and then I'll be a foolish virgin or Allah or worse but if I preach the word and brother and said you preach the word and live what you preach then there's a great reward for all those that do that amen I'm sorry I have to sit through that sometimes but I've got to deal with that's my job that's my job the Bible said rebuke them that sin and I hate to do it but woe to me if I don't it's gonna get worse and worse more deceptive they think they're save they're think they're in the message they think they're going the rapture and they're not and how will you know the word this Bible Church will tell us if we're right with God or not this wonderful gospel of word gospel on paper right but the Holy Spirit will direct us to the parts of the paper that will set us free okay that's six now here it's go to seven okay I just added this in because this is the condition that we have to battle today Jesus said I know your works in Laodicea thou art neither hot nor cold I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm now lukewarm means sometimes hot sometimes cold sometimes up sometimes cool sometimes really excited sometimes not because out lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth so you can't go dancing you can't be the mouthpiece of God you can't talk for God anymore now look at this this is the hard part this is where brother Adam preached a sermon and knoweth it not and he said this is the most awful condition of being in the entire Bible is this because you say I'm rich I'm increased with Goods and I have no more need of the Holy Ghost preaching I'm just paraphrasing I'm so rich enough I'm so strong spiritually I'm so close to God and I don't have any more devotion to Christ you can't either preach at me you can't help me by your preaching because I don't need anything I'm good I've already made a bow just amazing I'm already the message I made it I can just I don't have a need of anything my brother Graham said that is so different than the book of Acts chapter 4 after they got the Holy Ghost and seen miracles they got in jail for one night he said they went into upper room and prayed and God shook the place and they said God make us more bold and he said those who have the Holy Ghost were crying out for the Holy Ghost like they didn't have anything that's how you know a true believer today they're crying out for more the Holy Ghost even though they got it amen glory amen that's the scripture amen but see people come to message churches and thank God for the faithful Saints you know to me they say that you know they say they believe the message but they don't cry out for more of God well isn't that the same thing that we see here I don't have any need of it brother Jess I don't ever really need to repent brother Jess I never need to come up for prayer brother Jess I don't really need to pray more come to church more we don't need special meetings there yeah we got enough look at the attitude and see it's deceptive right it's more and more deceived more and more not less and less more and more deception and Jesus says you don't even know that your wretched miserable poor blind and naked so let's summarize the stay that we live in few people will be saved and find the path of life the number will continue to decrease and I'm not preaching this to discourage you I'm not trying to be negative I'm just showing you what the prophecy is of the last days how many can understand and weak understand I said I showed you about six seven eight nine I showed you a string of nine scriptures nine now I'll say this few people will love with Christ love how do you remember what pure religion is you got your Bible or let's go there let's go to a James chapter one I'll just put it up here I think I can switch over quick I don't remember what pure religion is the word religion is not bad as long as it is pure every understand that you know as people say oh you just got a man-made religion well yeah domination you've got man-made covering but the Bible said there's such a thing as pure religion if any man among you seem to be religious and can't bridle his tongue he deceives his own heart this man's religion is in vain and I share this with the brother he asked me where's the scripture that says there's no custom so I shared this with you if you're still cussing and your religion hasn't taken effect yet praise God or let's say cursing people well you're not the judge we're to judge their fruits let me know that you can judge fruits how you agree to serve on this by the way we can judge their fruits but we can't judge their eternal destination unless here's the exception unless you're right Paul and the Holy Ghost comes on you and you'll get you - and say holy - you son of the devil the only exception went right the Holy Ghost no part of this that you so the devil may you be blind for a season to cause blindness now that's the exception if not we cannot judge people's eternal destination but jesus said you will know them by their fruits understand that's the difference but if a man or woman can't bridle their tongue and does all and hates without a cause like Jesus said it's the same as murder and they can't do it their religion hasn't even taken effect the guy cry Christianity hasn't even had a real effect in their lives now here's what I want to say pure religion and let's get down to some of this especially this holiday season let's get down to some more of this God has opened up some doors where I've been able to do live into this here good let's pray to God open up for all of us pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless how many know of any children that don't have a father home that's people we should pray about visiting now I'm not going to ask for hands but how many have done that in the last six months if not let's pray about it this is pure and undefiled religion you visit the father's and the widow follow us and the widows in the midst of their affliction so when you see people hurting children that don't have a dad or mom could be either one or you see women that don't have husbands in their dirt poor whatever more if you don't visit them then our religions not really taking effect when we see people struggling and we don't help out something's wrong with us does everybody understand it that's the condition we're living in Jesus said the love of many shall wax cold they're gonna be cold towards the father's well let them deal with it they've got food stamps let them deal with it themselves no you and I are to be their food stamps you and I are to be their help see and this is what I love too so there's three parts to it and to keep himself unspotted from the world don't have anything to do with the world something we can all ask God for help with don't let me get tied to this app on my phone and too much worldliness and too much worldliness don't let me get tied to the things in the world I'll keep myself unspotted from the things in the world I keep all the worldly things off me I'll just live pure I won't join in that worldly Association I won't join up with worldly things I'll just remain over here clean and white in the eyes of Christ now we have some pure religion now we're walking pure before God when we care so much about children that don't have dads when we care so much about widows that don't have husbands and we all we want to do is keep the devil office now we're getting pure religion before God how many can say men I just thought I'd need to put that in there that's Christ's love that's pure that's pure religion and this is going to get smaller and less and less and less as we see that Day approaching few people will be hot with Christian works I guess those two can go together I'll put those together few people escape the seducing teachers who's teaching will only grow more inductive and remember how it operates it lets you enjoy fleshly lusts that's what the Bible says they are teachers of unrighteousness so false teacher will let you live in sin without rebuking it will give you a license for immorality that's called lasciviousness in the King James Version a license to sin there is no license that crowd a Christ fellowship to sin if you're in sin repent of your sin and if you're a real Christian you probably I do it every day right I mean you God forgive me I didn't mean to say that I didn't mean to do that have mercy Jesus forgive me help me to overcome that next time you see few people will recognize their need for more of God and repent because the lukewarm spirit says I don't have any need of that brother just I'll have to fast on Saturday you understand you have to be led but I feel led to fast not about you but I feel that the fast I don't need to do that I don't need to help out any children that don't have dads I have to help out any widows you see the love of God will constrain you to do it if you're real Christian I'll say like this if your Holy Ghost still Christian you give me a real Christian me foolish virgin I'm talk about a Holy Ghost feel Christian that's what I'm talking about okay let me close a deacon requirements has that been OK by God's grace we went a little deeper in the word of paper verses the word with power and I wanted to show that string of scriptures that show the endtime conditions that we have to overcome we have to overcome that now let's take your Bibles here let's go to Acts chapter 6 verse 1 to 7 I think we just have time to read these and then we'll go through a quote and I think we'll be okay now as I said I'm already a deacon if I could I would sit in the back because that's where the Deacon needs to be program so that nikka needs to see everybody who walks in the door but many times I'm preaching in solidness I can't sit out there huh let's go through some Deacon requirements I do a lot of deacon requirements want to help people with food or bills or things things like that let's look at some of the deccan requirements Acts chapter six verse one sorry it's taking me so long mercy and those days when the number of disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring among the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily administration so look there's a little bit of murmuring complaining in the early church I'm gonna believe that's about how many believe this is a book of Acts church do that church sometimes there's murmuring in a real book of Acts church well why they don't help us out and how come they don't do this her see sometimes we murmur don't we but there was a murmuring here Oh somebody's there not getting food every day see Christians should help people that don't have food then the twelve called the multitude the disciples under them and said there's not reason that we should leave the Word of God and serve tables now this is what I would love to do I would love at some point to have so many deacons that I could don't have to worry about Deacon work and I can just be a preacher and a preacher and a prayer warrior that's what I'd like to be but brother Branham was pastor Deacon trusty solid leader for seventeen years I can do it for a few more years until God raised up some more deacons wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business so giving people food every day is a business and that's what a deacon office is it's for business but we will give ourselves continually to the work to prayer and to the Ministry of the word so see I want to get the spot where I can just give myself to prayer and preaching that's all I have to do pray and preach pray and preach right now I've got a lot more but I'm hoping God trusting God will send me more deacons and the sang please the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith in the Holy Ghost and Philip and pro chorus and a mic our and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of enik whom they set before the apostles when they had prayed they laid their hands on them and the Word of God increased the number of disciples multiplied and Juicin greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient unto the faith so do Ekans arose from the need of people just needing food everyday and the preachers like well I can't do this I've got to study and pray I need to give myself to the ministry so they said oh let's let's create an office of a deacon let's have men that are devoted to the business of God now go to first Timothy 3 8 through 13 this is what it rose from and if we're Christians and we see people don't have food and we don't help them then we are backslidden Christians because these book of Acts Christians made a special office just to make sure all the believers had food every day amen you cannot love someone without meeting their daily needs I'm gonna say it again we cannot love people we cannot be real Christians without caring about do they have their needs met you can't be a Christian without caring about people's daily needs I'm sorry I'm in Corinthians 1st Timothy 3 8 through 13 sorry about that likewise must the Deacons be grave not double-tongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and let these also first be proved see you gotta watch that Deacon for a while I watch that person's this one this person worthy to be a deacon then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless have to be a blameless Christian to be a deacon alright I lost my spot verse 11 even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things just like a pastor a pastor his wife have to be faithful so do a deacon and his wife have to be faithful let the Deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own house as well so deacons at some point have to desire children just like brother Brandon brother Branham was a pastor before he was even married how many know that okay now the Bible says a pastor has to have children well so we see if brother bran was allowed to be a pastor we have to apply that to us as well so a person can be a pastor or a deacon as long as they have plans or a desire to have children okay so that's what we said so we say for Deacons it's like in the case of with Adam and sister both they don't have children yet but they desire children right they would like to have a family just like was the brother cams you know brother cam was a pastor before he had children he was married but they didn't have children yet and then after he became pastor then he started having children so just so you know just like brother Brandon alright verse 13 for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves of a good degree and a great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus so deacons need to be bold which we're gonna see why they need to be bold in a little bit because they got a guard the house of God they're God's policemen for the house of God and brother BAM said anybody that will get upset with the Gauley Deacon has the wrong spirit on them in other words if you can't take correction from a deacon shame on you you got the wrong spirit on you see cuz they got to be bold they got to be looking out to protect the Spirit of God that's in the church these things are right unto thee hoping to come under these shortly alright oh yeah well let's read verse 15 but if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth see we need to learn how to behave in the house of God that's why God has pastors that's why God has deacons the deacons gonna help us learn how to behave in the house of God all right now they asked well around this question now before I do that let me go this is our bylaws this is a mystery brother Adam I thought I emailed it to you okay this is what our bylaws say because we have to have bylaws according to the government the office of a deacon will consistent maintain the spiritual and natural wear welfare the assembly they shall assist the president that's what the government calls the pastor they call the pastor the president whoever is the head of the group is called the president like the president and CEO of you know Microsoft or whatever they just had that title so I'm the present here but I don't walk around saying oh I'm the president you know yippie or you know I don't do that they show sis the president and all the duties required they shall police the church keeping this assembly in accordance to the Word of God in reverence that's one of their main jobs to keep it reverent in here they must fulfil the qualification scripturally outlined and what we just read there is a minimum one-year membership at the Assembly to re-review qualified they must also assist in serving communion to act as asurs at all services so communion of course is helping you know with the the wine the bread and also if someone needs a seat the deacon has to help them find their seat they show okay we're yeah okay yeah they should be ready anytime to assist the need of every saint whose burden and a need of spiritual consultation or general welfare they have no authority to spend church funds except for food clothing and financial help to the needy so they're not to pay the bills the treasurer is supposed to pay the bills they shall be voted on once per year by the congregation to remain in their service they shall hold offices until their successors are duly elected and qualified if there is a replacement now listen this is during the absence or disability of the president or pastor the deacons should exercise all the powers and discharge all the duties of the President so if I get sick or I go down the Deacon runs the church they exercise all the authority of the president if I'm sick and I can't exercise that authority or I can't you know I'm in a coma or something like that they have to take over because they're the next high office behind the pastor never understand that alright so let's look at that question how far brother Branham can or should a deacon go to keep order in the church should we keep the order or wait until brother Nevel tells us what we should do so I might exceed this answer and then we'll close of this oops sorry wrong I was looking at another scripture just a moment Carmy okay I know it's really small you don't strain your eyes I don't think I can make that any bigger can I know um so that's brother brand that should we wait for the brother brother Nevel to tell us what to do and he said that isn't brother Neville's job that's your job see you don't tell brother Neville what to preach on how to preach see that's your job you deacons you're supposed to do that you take care of that that's nothing - brother Neville that's your job now he gives a nice illustration if a policeman's out here on the street and he sees a man stealing property out of the back of a car should he call the mayor and say now mayor your honor sir I'm working out here for you on the police force now I find a man up on the street he's stealing some of the tires off a car last night now I just wonder what's your opinion of that huh he said see that wouldn't be sensible would it no sir if he's doing something wrong arrest him see a deacon has to sense when someone's doing wrong and breaking the reference of the church I've had to do in the last few years I've had to go to people children playing with toys you know I love the children but if they're playing with toys I'm the one that's got to say I've had to do that right and then ask people to move seats from time to time you know if we come in there there's more people there's lack of seats or something like that to ask people to move if a child is being really loud sometimes I'll walk over you know to somebody with the child whether it's a man or woman I'll say can I help you with the child well if they're really loud I anticipate where they're gonna need to leave and then I'll be ready to open the door so they can walk out without without having opened the door just to save them a step if people are dropped you know if children drop things or something like that or children are running I'll try to whisper say running here please don't run here so as a deacon you have to be sensitive to the move of the Holy Spirit those are just some small examples now if a man's doing some wrong in the church here or anybody stop them and talk to them don't be arrogant but if they won't listen speak in a way that they know what you're saying see like you tell a child walk back there walk back there and he's misbehaving Deacon's nature place there's four of you now programs talking the Deacons he said there's two of you in the front and there's two in the back he's sitting on the corners or something like that watch real clothes for renegades and everything else coming like this you see and you be on the guard you just get your post to duty stay there that's your seat or stand right there beside the wall and watch everybody who comes in now especially in this day when people are walking to churches with guns and just murdering people how many understand we need deacons today we need deacons that will stand the door and try to stop somebody in case they come in we need deacons to protect the people now he said have two in the front two in the back well if we have just Adam and I you know and I'm preaching now I want Adam sent right back at the back door case anybody comes in or case of child is running in or in case he needs to help somebody leave or something like that and in our church and other churches you have to watch the hallway you know when little children leave sometimes they get distracted or sometimes we've had in the past where children have left out and we're not sure which ones but they leave out and they do little tricks and little stunts and they do things out there they mess around and you know just mess up things and they're just playing around because they don't want to come in here to church well Deacon needs to take care and find out who's doing that and chase them down and make sure they're and make sure the people aren't talking the bathroom you know we're talking too loud or just not there not being reverent well the band said if you want a fellowship he said go out to your home he said this is the place where we fellowship with God you have little conversations but keep your conversation short out there we're here to talk to God and this is actually in this sermon but I don't have time to get to it a deacon takes care of the house of God someone to come in speak to them be there to greet them so like a chef feel they have deacons right at the door to shake your hand when you come in gonna take your coat know but Adam if he gets elected all right I can't do that if I'm elected usually I'm up here praying or in the songs ready I wish we had more deacons to do that we could use more deacons he said see you're the policemen can I show you to the cloakroom would you be seated could could we hand you a songbook or something now we like for you to enjoy yourself and pray we're happy you're here with us tonight lead them down to a place and would you like to be closer would you like to be back there whatever more that's hospitality a policeman is a military police to the Army courtesy yet with authority see you know what a military police is actually if he carries out his rights I think he's like our chaplain you see it's courtesy and everything but yet he has an authority you must mind him these rookies they get out there and get drunk why he puts them in their place and so as a deacon to put them in their place now remember the Deacon is a policeman and a deacons office is actually more strict than any office in the church he says there it is I don't know of any office any more stricter than the Deacons office so a deacon is supposed to be nitpicky and the church said off to repeat that on Sunday to make sure I hear everybody say Amen a deacon is actually more strict and picky about reverence than even the pastor's see why because he's got a real job he's God's man he's God's man just as much as the pastor is God's man certainly he is God's servant now he just goes through and he says you don't ask brother Nevel you know if you have to ask brother Nevel how to do a deacon work you should know and he can work his and so brother Adam does get elected on Sunday then I'll probably take next Wednesday and go over some more deacon concerns because we could really some help by God's grace okay let's stay on our feet by God's grace I'm gonna pass these out and then you can look up here if you like up I'm going to pass these out this is just the rough draft in the ballot I'm just gonna give them to the people vote on Sunday I guess I'm an email list everybody and that it can't be here I will give one week to get it in they can email it to brother van or myself so the first one is pastor you can either check for myself I'm the current officer or you can check pray and wait for another different pastor for that crow ministry or can check and write something else in like I think so-and-so should be pastor you can do that you can write whatever you want a deacons I swear it's different this year I'm the first name I'm a current officers a deacon brother Adams name is up there and yeah it has to get 2/3 of the vote to be a deacon so I know how many people would pay ties so I'll take that number and to find the percentage what's what's 2/3 percentage of that he gets two thirds of the vote then he you'd be a deacon for us for a year the next one this is where my format gets really awful right here it should be it should be on the left not centered but trustee we just have to right now we could use in another of course we could use we will use more deacons we can use more trustees but brother van and I are current trustees you can turn the page treasurer I really don't want to be the treasurer but no one else wants to be the treasurer so I have to it doesn't the taxman said that doesn't look good so I hope I don't get audited but I'm the only one that wants to do it which I understand I understand there's a lot involved with money you know then you know everybody's giving and it kind of got a battle you know in your mind you huh but I'm glad people give you know we're glad people get but if anybody wants to be a treasurer I'll write their name and no one's let me know that they want to be treasurer but any man that's qualified is open to do that and sunday-school burn Sunday School Superintendent that's me as well now we haven't had Sunday school since the beginning of I think it was May because we didn't have families bringing their children for like a month or five weeks so I said dude I'm just gonna stop Sunday school because people aren't coming and I understand if they've you know they've had you know new children or they live two hours away or something like that you know I understand but it's got to be a burden of the people if the bird if the people have a burden to come to Sunday school which I hope we do this coming year I'm willing to teach it again by God's grace but the people have to be willing to make a sacrifice I can't force anybody to come you know what I mean I can I can beg them I can preach about it but I can't force anybody to come they have to make an active sacrifice they have to put Christ as a higher priority than anything else and then lastly there's four options there if you want to request a personal interview with me if your sister I've got my wife sit in and you want to discuss questions or concerns I'll sit down with anybody just let me know the second one if you feel someone's not qualified you want to talk to me about it check that I'll talk to you bout it if you feel someone new might might be qualified and want to recommend them and want to talk to me about it let me know and then I want everybody check that last one if you completed this with sincerity based on your leadership of the Holy Ghost and then just sign your name you give this to bang or I but not this I'm gonna give you a different sheet this is just the rough draft you know I'm gonna make it look better I said that much time you know before church okay there's any questions about that just yes sister Connie yeah no yeah I know what you mean yeah no that won't take away because I still know the total number of people voting as long as yet but he asked to have two thirds just like I have to have two thirds to know when we divide it everybody has an individual vote ever have an individual so yeah yeah I appreciate that it's good question if it has an individual opportunity how many know the Deacon is God's man he's just as much God's man as the pastor is God's man unappreciated godly deacon I appreciate a godly pastor I'd appreciate a galley treasure and Sunday School Superintendent that's what we want we just want godly people in the officers of God and I tell you I could use the help I've said it you know off and on over last couple years I don't want to fill all these offices other than pastor I don't actually I actually I do want to be a trustee I do wanna be a trustee is then I have a say in the direction of the church if I see like something's wrong or you know voting and different things like that should we do this should we rent this buy this or whatever I do like to have a saying that but just so you know I do we do want as much help as we can get all right so praise the Lord let's just buy ads and word of Prayer here and we'll just go before the Lord I know it's gone late I didn't mean to go tonight I really didn't but we're thankful to be in the house some more tonight we'll
