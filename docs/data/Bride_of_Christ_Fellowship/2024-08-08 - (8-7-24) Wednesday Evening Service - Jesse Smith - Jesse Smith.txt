God's grace good to see sister Lena God bless you Sister how you doing praise the Lord let's give her round Applause amen good to see her tonight by God's grace is brother Austin here he awesome wonderful praise the lord we just prayed for you thankful we can make it by God's grace Hall so we'll just amen what a blessing so we'll start in Ephesians chapter 2 you know I was using Zechariah 4 ver7 but thought tonight I'll just go back to looking at Grace Ephesians chapter 2 here tonight verse eight iians 28 also want to thank you know you think Kristen's mom brought this today I think she drove must have been 12 hours today to bring us this foran she's not even done driving she's still on the road so christen's Mom really loves our family you know and loves his church lyia by God's grace so thankful what a gift you know people care about you they really show a lot of really go out of their way to show the love of God so thankful for that sure this be a great blessing to us here God's grace before we read uh Ephesians 2 ver8 remember this weekend we have service Friday Saturday at 6 6:30 P.M Services brother uh Dennis McBride's coming from Charleston South Carolina and then Lord willing uh he'll get in about 1:30 one o00 on Friday I'll pick him up and proba a little fellowship if you want to be a part of that just let me know I'll tell you where we'll go we probably since he's staying right here at the comfort in Su we'll probably just go over to chipot or something like that Panera wherever he wants to go and uh if you want to Fellowship just let me know probably around 2 o' or 2:30 somewhere along there God's Gra and then Sunday at 10 a.m. how looking forward to the services this weekend praise God now these are the delayed anniversary Services they're supposed to be in June but then the church had the leak and we're almost done I think almost everything's done by God's grace so starting to clean out and get everything back in order here it's nice to be back in the sanctuary praise God hallelujah so Ephesians 2 ver8 a very familiar scripture we're saved by grace through faith Hallelujah we'll read eight n and 10 U why don't we read uh 8 n and 10 together that's a little bit extra reading for us tonight I think I'd like to hear your voices and it's good to read the word of God because Grace uh Grace as we saw a few weeks ago Grace will produce a love for Holiness uh Grace teaches we should deny anything ungodly that's what it teaches so Grace teaches to live a holy life and here we see grace gives us uh salvation and then helps us realize we are created for God's workmanship we're created to do something for the kingdom of God Amen so let's read 8 n and 10 ready one two three for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before Ed saying that we should walk in them amen may God add his Blessing to the Ring of his word you may be seated I just saw that a fresh tonight we were created in Christ Jesus isn't that wonderful go uh God thought of you in his mind you were in the the mind of God hallelujah before the foundation of the world Paul tells us actually in the previous chapter uh so what a blessing to know that I'll set my timer here uh just so a Paige knows I usually preach about an hour on Wednesday nights okay all right all right I'll take the freedom I got there appreciate that you know every Sunday page I usually preach about an hour and a half I just get caught up in Heavenly places I just can hardly stop preaching because I love Jesus so much and sometimes it happens on a Wednesday night too so we're just thankful to be here in the house of the Lord here tonight so this is part five we looked at four previous sermons with the same title uh the message of Grace we looked at how Grace was extended to Adam and Eve we looked at how Grace uh was extended to Noah Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord the Bible says Abraham found the grace of God and then last week we closed with how Israel just as a nation was given Grace and we know they'll always have God's grace because they have God's covenant when God makes a a covenant promise he can't break the promise he can't swear by anything else because there's nothing greater than him so he swears by himself amen uh the book of Hebrews tells us that and even the fact Israel is still in existence today Pro proves that God's grace is with them with all the missiles shot at them and the constant Wars they go through and how many times Jerusalem has been destroyed and rebuilt it just proof that God's grace is for Israel and remember we preached on Romans earlier this year we finished the entire book of Romans and the Bible says that uh once God has done with the done with the Gentiles he'll cut off the Gentiles and he'll graft back in the Jews so the Jews will come back into the Holy Spirit uh in other words they'll receive Jesus Christ as their Messiah they can't see it now because they're blinded to it but once God's done with the Gentiles he saved every last one then he can graft back in the Jews praise God and the Bible said don't be high minded don't boast yourself and and don't feel like you got everything figured out the Bible says uh serve god with reverence and godly fear and be thankful you're connected to Christ amen Christ is the vine you are the branches amen so let's remember we're only we only have anything because of God's mercy on us that God uh cut us off as a wild branch and uh grafted us into a holy tree you know we would be nothing except God uh grafted us into him Hallelujah we we have nothing to boast on praise God it was God who cut us off of the of the wild tree and put us into the Holy One it was God that brought us his love and his Mercy praise God none of us had any righteousness our righteousness was as filthy rags amen there's none that seeketh after God no not one amen and so I want to now look at the next character tonight I want to look at Moses tonight right um so uh I might even get into David we'll kind of see I never know usually usually I go slower than what I think I'm going to go you know so usually it takes me longer to get through my notes you know by God's grace so but that's quite normal uh I think I'll just skip down to Moses here and if you have your Bibles you know you can pull up numbers 20 verse1 I'm going to start there uh and I'm preaching this uh this thought from a sermon from 1961 from God's Prophet brother William brandham he passed away of course in 1965 but but I was I've been listening to his sermon and P pulling out the important points I want you to see from the scripture these are points that he uh preached as well and I think you'll you'll like these here by God's grace so I'll just read this here uh and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here ye now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock this is not one of the highlights of Moses's life this is one of the low lights of Moses's life life this wasn't like you know he when when he stuck out his rod and and the waters parted on the Red Sea and he just let him on over that was a a highlight of his life this is one of the the failures of his life and uh uh you know God's Prophet said remember Moses that great leader God should have killed him when he went down there to glorify himself by smiting that rock and said you see what I can do in other words you rebels must we fetch you water from this rock and see you know the Bible tells it later that that Moses glorified himself Moses uh was making it he was putting himself into this like like he had the ability to get water for let's say two million people uh that's just one person's estimate there could have been a million there could have been three million it was just a large amount of people praise God and uh nobody can supply water in the wilderness except God but Moses puts himself in there like like I'm going to go fetch enough water for two million people God wasn't pleas with that and God said because you magnified yourself you will not go into the promised land right God kept them from going into the promised land there while he was alive because of his Disobedience he magnified himself and remember God never said to Smite The Rock God said to speak to the Rock so not only did he put himself in there you know he magnified himself like well I can fetch water like but he had no ability to do that uh but then he even disobeyed God he disobeyed the word of God God and he smoked the waters right the first time and no Waters came out he smoted it again look God gave him a little warning there aren't you glad God gives us warnings right look at God's mercy there he should have just stopped oh that's right I was supposed to speak to the Rock but in still and in his uh the Bible said that that the Bible actually said that they provoked Moses in his anger see because he was angry the first time it didn't come he said W Smite it again he got angry again and he was he was upset with the people he was name called the people now we don't want preachers at name call the people right but then we know Jesus you know called the Pharisees some really strange really uh harsh names I'll say like that he said you serpents you uh you you den of vipers and you den of you brood of vipers you know there's times where you got to pull out those names but it must be led of God hallelujah it must be led by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah but in this moment it was it was anger it wasn't God's spirit it was anger that he was calling them you bunch of rebels and so we see that you know he stepped out of the will of God he should not have smoked The Rock he should have spoke to the Rock and he should not have put himself in the picture he should not have glorified himself he should have glorified God hallelujah now Church what's what's amazing uh now if you pull up numbers uh uh 12:3 what What's amazing is that uh Moses is called the meekest man on the earth that means the the most humble that means the one who who who most puts God first there was nobody on the earth during moses' time who put God first than him remember it's like the same thing with job remember God said is there anybody like job devil remember he said that he's a perfect man there's none like him so see that there are you know God knows who's really trying to be humble God knows aren't you glad God looks at your life God looks at all of our Lives amen and he sees how we're trying to Humble ourselves and serve God God sees your efforts of of of humbling yourself and and and the Bible said dying daily God sees that you want to serve him amen hallelujah but look the Bible says you know he was the meekest man on the whole Earth but I'll say it like this he wasn't always Meek but when he was humble when he was repenting when he was when he was aware of God when he was worshiping God then he was a very Meek individual and this proved it you know we're not going to read all this chapter but remember in this chapter uh his brother and sister Aaron and and Miram were making fun of him because he married a I'm sorry minite yes in E I'm sorry Ethiopia Ethiopia and uh and they were making fun of him and God looked at the brother and sister and said you should not make fun of him and and what did Moses do he went quick to prayer he went to pray for them now church God help us to pray for the people that make fun of us amen is that the first thing we do when someone sends us an awful text or an awful email it ought to be right or someone gives us a a dirty look to our face or someone maybe says a cuss word to us or something is the first thing we do when to pray for them it ought to be praise God Moses had this type of meekness but see he wasn't always the meekest man and church you know as as much as we are Servants of God and we love God and we're we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't always act like it and the church said what I'm trying to do is get us to be humble here tonight right just remember remember how humble we must be and church I'll say like this there might be moments you and I might be some of the most humble Christians people might ever meet but there's also times where we're prideful and we don't honor God the way we ought to those moments ought to be recognized we ought to repent and say God make me humble again Hallelujah let me remember your grace Hallelujah let me not be prideful let Lord don't let me put anything into this I can't do anything I need you Hallelujah I need you every hour I want to remain I want to abide in you Lord Jesus I want to abide in the vine so you know uh we can see how uh Moses you know he he he loved God but he also stumbled at times he needed the grace of God hallelujah here's one I just you know I think could be important to see Exodus 4:24 and if you uh haven't read this recently I just you know I was kind of shocked Again by it today it been a while since I read this and it came to pass by the way in the end that the Lord met him and sought to kill him God was seeking to kill Moses God was chasing Moses down brother Austin can you imagine you imagine God chasing me down to kill me not to bless me to kill me right yet he was the meekest man on Earth is that the scripture see how we need to be balanced in the scriptures Hallelujah we need to remember this now remember this is at the beginning of his ministry this is Exodus 4 he just met the burning bush just met the burning bush right and then he's getting ready to go down after this he go he goes to meet Aaron he's getting ready to go down to deliver uh Israel and God's coming to kill him because he hasn't circumcised his son see this is where we see neglect God sees our neglect right God sees our neglect but I love this this also is his grace in order to get him to obey the word of God hallelujah this is God's grace God could have just killed him right but we know the story who saved his life church that Ethiopian sweetheart of his Hallelujah that's right look at verse 25 then Zapora took a sharp Stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art thou to me now there's numerous uh interpretations of this some people say this is a positive thing some people say it's it's her kind of complaining I don't know so uh verse 26 so he let him go so the Lord let Moses go because his wife interceded for him talk about Grace now my wife saved my life on a couple of occasions but not like this Hallelujah I was choking one time and oh yeah I was choking twice and both times my wife saved me so I got I got a lot to be thankful for amen I could I can relate a little bit to Moses not all the way by God's grace but then she said a bloody husband Thou Art because of the circumcision so he neglected it all those years and it was God's grace that God gave him a wife who would step in and fulfill the circumcision the ceremony when he wouldn't she did see see Brothers some and I'll say to the married men and the brothers if you're not married you're going to be married Lord willing someday Brothers we're going to battle neglect God God's called us to be leaders but sometimes we neglect our duties God calls us to be strong men Faithful Men do the word of God leaders but sometimes we don't lead the right way and the brother said amen I'm not perfect I make mistakes I wish I was a better father a better husband a better Pastor uh than I am but I can be better if I humble myself Hallelujah and but I also want to recognize when there's times times when I neglect things times I don't obey the word of God I gotta remember God's grace will bring me out of it hallelujah amen glory brought Moses out it'll bring you out Hallelujah it'll bring us out if our hearts desires to be like Moses Brothers and sisters to be humble Meek Christians remember the meek inherit the earth amen the meek those who are humble realize they're nothing trusting God for everything those are the kind of people God's going to reward and give you a portion of this Earth in the Millennium Hallelujah and the future home those are the people God's going to reward those like Moses who do the will of God it wasn't perfect but neither are you and I Hallelujah there's only one perfect man that's the man Christ Jesus Hallelujah and he is now the high priest the mediator in heaven he's ever living to make intercession for your neglect amen or your mistakes or my mistakes he lives to do that praise God and that shows he's loving that shows he's merciful that shows he has Grace for us hallelujah amen go to James uh 4 verse5 there sister Olia you got your Bibles of course you guys all can go thank you this was just made fresh again to me I had forgotten you know I guess I just you know I'm human I'd forgotten that God is a jealous God even in the New Testament you know we always hear about the difference between the Old Testament New Testament I agree the New Testament is better promises but I forget many times how God is still jealous in the New Testament and here's the scripture that proves it James according to the the history James was the first one who wrote a book of the Bible in the New Testament he's the first one he was the leader of the church in Jerusalem remember he was uh I think the second Mar if I'm not mistaken if I'm not mistaken Stephen and then James if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on that so I'm open to correction on that one please correct me you know after church now remember he's talking about in the first four verses uh he's like don't be don't have friendship with the world he says don't be an adulterer don't be a fornicator that means that means be true to your wedding vow you know as we saw on Sunday night remember sisters and brothers you young people it's so important that you you stay uh pure physically God your body's a temple the Holy Ghost and and God places great value on that Hallelujah save yourself for marriage amen be abstinent until marriage Hallelujah God places such value on that it's a it's a great price in the sight of God hallelujah but here we see you know uh James says do you think that the scripture says in vain you think it's useless that God says the spirit that dwelleth in US lust us to Envy or is jealous you think the Bible just says that in vain like that's useless and remember he's talking about Christians they they'll go to church remember like they'll go to James's church but then they'll go a man he'll go sleep with another man's wife and James says don't you know that God's a jealous God shouldn't do that and some of the people would go down they would come to church James's Church they go out and then they'd worship other Idols they'd bow down to other idols and James says don't you know God's jealous don't you know God wants all your love and church doesn't he to deserve all your love he went to the Cross Hallelujah he conquered death Hell In The Grave he's worthy of all your life amen He Paid a Debt he did not owe he we owed a debt we could not pay we need someone to wash our sins away Hallelujah be like rhyming tonight amen hallelujah now I sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid a Debt that I could never pay Hallelujah that's right right but see James say don't you know you're a Christian Jesus Is God Jesus Is God hallelujah he's God uh remember uh in John 14 uh it was uh Phillip Philip said show us the father Jesus and he says have I been so long with you Philip that thou Hast not known me don't you know that I in the father and the father's in me amen hallelujah Thomas looked at his hands and said my Lord and my God Jesus Jesus Is God God is uh Emanuel is God Is With Us Amen Hallelujah Jesus was God In the Flesh Hallelujah God manifest In the Flesh and James says don't you know that Jesus is jealous of our love think about you husbands would you want your wives just going out and flirting with other men of course not would you wise want your husbands go flirting with other women of course not why because you're jealous of their love right in a in a Godly way you they promised to love you didn't you promise to love Jesus hallelujah amen good to see brother Mercy tonight brother God bless you that's a real treat to have you on a Wednesday night brother we have three special treats tonight what is it triple blessings I mean they just they keep pouring out on us all the time verse six so God's jealous even in the New Testament now but look even though God's jealous what does he do he knows we're not perfect what does he do he gives us more grace amen we might we might miss the Mark we might uh make God offended the Bible said the Bible said you can offend the Holy Spirit grieve not the Holy Spirit but see because of that we don't lose our Salvation what he does he gives us more grace Hallelujah Grace to try it again Hallelujah and not fail this time gives us more grace that's why I love when The Headstone came back in Zechariah 4 they were shouting Grace Grace amen it was just emphasizing we need an extra portion of Grace Hallelujah everyone look the Bible says he gives more grace amen even to that original early church right some people in that early church remember the Bible said in James 2 some people in that early church when a rich person would walk in they would push out the poor people oh no I'm sorry you got to move let let's let these people with the the nice garments let and the big rings and the fancy hat let's let them sit right up here in front the early church got caught up in that sometimes but what does God do he gives us more grace Hallelujah and church let's just be humble however God wants to send us to the correction let's just receive it right like brother said brother BR said my wife is my correction so who's the one that corrected brother Brandon the most his wife who corrects me the most my wife Hallelujah right who corrects you the most well you fill in the blank amen but let's receive correction wherever it comes Hallelujah because we know it's God's love to us it's God giving us more grace so we can be right Hallelujah because that's what we want to be we want to be right not for our righteousness but for the glory of God see wherefore he sayith God resists the proud see but giveth Grace unto the humble Hallelujah all right now now I could be wrong on this but it looks like three times God could have killed Moses I could be wrong on this but just hear me up after he killed that man when he was 40 years old God could have killed him remember that in Egypt remember that church God could have killed him next time he didn't circumcise his son God could have killed him think about that a prophet of God a prophet of God could have been killed by God but God showed what and now I don't think it's in the Bible but brother Ram said about the one I read earlier about uh Moses smiting The Rock in numbers 20:10 brother said God should have killed him or could have killed him now that might have been an exaggeration I don't know but let's say it wasn't let's say God could have done that that would have been three times God could have killed him but God showed Mercy every time how many times have we fallen short of God's glory but yet God has shown us more grace Hallelujah we might have to sing uh the uh The Reckless Love of God but it's not Reckless we we don't call it Reckless what do we call it the precious love of God we might have to sing that at the end right because we don't deserve it but God still God's love gets poured out on us amen right it's just the love of God it's an expression of God's grace and love that's who he is God is love amen he's just expressing his character to us aren't you glad amen that if we fall short he gives us more grace Hallelujah he doesn't take the grace away and say no I'm done with you no I'm gonna give you more Grace I'm not going to give you what you deserve I'm Gonna Give You Grace oh my the B David said that in the Book of Psalms remember that David said you've not given unto us what we deserve H Allelujah now I'm just adding my words there that's not the official King James version I'm kind of just guessing on the words there out of memory but you understand that so what do we see we see God you know he has a right to be angry sometimes right but the Bible said his anger won't last forever amen glory to God hallelujah he was mad at Moses right at least once we can prove it by the scripture right when he when he just failed to do the circumcision God was going to kill him now what about us parents parents how how careful we should be to make sure we raise our children the right way I'm looking at the parents right we should be we should be so careful right and and we are but many times we need reminders right I like I like God's grace God God's grace gives us a chance to reset right let's start this over again let's try this again like I told you I just recently uh hit the reset button on some of the standards in our house I just had to reset it last month I appreciate that I'm glad I'm glad God can show me things where I need to be corrected I'm glad God Loves Me Like That amen I'm glad for the precious love of God hallelujah amen see and there's times God gets angry but his anger won't last forever the Bible says hallelujah so if this is true you know at least two or three times God could have killed Moses but God showed Moses Grace and then God put him in the Hall of Fame of faith in Hebrews 11 what a man who should have been killed God May puts in the Hall of Fame yeah that that that's the kind of God we serve amen a God who takes the the nothings and the uh The God Who takes the former murders and he makes them real children of God hallelujah glory to God Amen see Church there's hope for us amen there's great hope for us hallelujah that if we continue to live by faith and not walk by sight but walk by faith if we continue to walk by faith and receive more of God's grace then God has great precious promises in store for us amen if we can just endure the light afflictions Paul tells us in second Corinthians if we can just endure those then we will have such a greater weight of Glory waiting for us in heaven hallelujah amen and if all we get is a white robe that'll be enough for me brother Mercy if I if my mansion's small or I my Mansion gets deleted that's fine as long as I get to be there with Jesus Hallelujah that's all I want amen all I get is a white robe if all I get is eternal life and I don't get a crown just let me be with Jesus throughout all eternity Amen Let Me worship the one who died for me and changed my life amen and gave me extra Grace despite my failures hallelujah praise God Amen that's the God I serve amen the God who gives more grace so this is a new testament confirmation you know that that God is jealous over our time right we've been preaching about you know men overcoming uh pornography right God's jealous over that time God's jealous what you look at on your phone God's jealous of that he's jealous what the songs you sing you should only sing for Jesus Hallelujah God's jealous of what you watch you should only watch Christian movies Hallelujah right God's jealous right because uh Jesus said if a man looks on a woman lust he's already committed the act in his mind and every movie has one of those scenes in it well almost every movie and I remember this as a young Christian imagine this 20 I became a Christian 24 years ago when I became a new Christian I watched a video where even in the dis the old Disney movies the cartoons they would put immoral pictures right in there they was just flashing in there it's like the subliminal message you couldn't even watch I think it was Rescuers Down Under if I'm not mistaken they put uh an x-rated picture right there and you can see it right in the I itan just flashes before you I mean this is what the devil does he takes something that looks good but he sneaks some sin in there but remember that cartoon doesn't glorify Jesus doesn't teach you to love Jesus but the Bible teaches you to love Jesus Hallelujah you are created to love Jesus amen hallelujah you weren't created to love Disney you're created to love Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so God gave Moses more grace Hallelujah now there's a few more things I want to say I'm going to read this uh uh brother Bram makes this uh observation and when I say brother Bram it's just like quoting Billy Graham or something like that or Martin Luther you know I I've written a book I wrote about Martin Luther John Wesley uh all all those uh wonderful iranusatensions he said Moses wanted to show he had a little authority a little power so he Saidi bring you water this rock he said God should have killed him for it God should have separated him that he broke God's law right there and notice he smoted it twice and the Bible said that rock in the wilderness was who that rock was Christ right and so see even in Moses's failure God uses failure to point to something that The Rock was going to to be smitten twice once physical now this is a little deeper here once physical as Jesus was smitten on the cross and once spiritual at the end time how many believe that by God's grace and we're going to show you the scripture go to Hebrews 6 Hebrews 6 ver6 people think oh Jesus he could not be crucified again well not physically of course but spiritually even so many churches are crucifying the word of Christ today we would say in other words they're speaking evil they're blaspheming against the word of God the Bible says You must repent of your sin and if a church says no you don't have to repent God just accepts you as you are that's that's crucifying the word if if if the church says well God doesn't do Miracles anymore they've just crucified the word they put him to a an open shame right because they're going against the word of God hallelujah Hebrews 6:6 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they what do they do they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame now we believe the writer of Hebrews was Paul but I'm not going to argue with it it doesn't say I'm not going to argue with anybody but it it fits all of his previous writings but but the point is Paul's saying people today they can uh when they when they deny the word of God it's as if they're crucifying the Son of God another time right that's what the Bible says so we must be very careful to believe all the word of God to accept all the truth of God's word amen you know some people don't believe in uh Mark chapter 16 let me go there uh Mark 16 I believe it's verse 15 I just want to just give those examples if people say these things don't exist anymore well you're a little too late to tell me that because I've seen almost all these before in my life amen a little too late to tell me that that uh these Supernatural things don't happen anymore if they say these Supernatural things don't happen they're crucifying the Son of God aresh they're putting him to an open shame because openly they're preaching it from their pulpits oh God doesn't speak in tongues anymore God doesn't heal the sick uh God doesn't do these Miracles they're crucifying aresh the Son of God remember that had to be because Moses Smit The Rock twice he smoted it I'm sorry SMI Smith's not of work he smoted it twice sorry and I teach English too for a living I teach it for my profession and I can't get it right sometimes see how God has Grace go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature next verse 16 he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damn leave it up there now now there's are cases where people can't get baptized if they're dying on their death bed and they they and God will save them but if they have a chance and someone will say oh no I don't have to be baptized they're crucifying the Son of God aresh because Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved right and and if they say you don't got to repent they they they broke into acts 238 where Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins remission means sending away so you got to repent of your sins and God will send your sins away and that'll make you the happiest person you've ever been I know because I've experienced said amen I was told I told that to Malachi this week I said the second happiest day of my life was when I married your mother I smiled so much my cheeks hurt oh man I think when I was uh I was waiting there I think I was like massaging my cheeks to make him to try to take some of the pain away but the happiest day of my life is when I finally repented of my sins and I said Jesus I'm not living for the world anymore Jesus I'm Living For You Hallelujah that was the happiest day of my life Hallelujah so uh next verse eight or 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils I've cast out devil seven times people but if anybody says oh you can't do that that's not real they've just crucified the Son of God a fresh that spoke of Moses smiting it twice Jesus was smitten on Calvary 2 years ago and he's being smitten today why are they smiting him today because the Antichrist is going to rise right they're all they're going to bring all the world religions together and then they're going to say you can't buy or sell unless you you take this Mark we just saw at the Republican National Convention how many saw that they opened up with a Hindu woman uh from California praying to the one true God and it was a Hindu god it wasn't Jesus and while she prayed to the Hindu god they had crosses up here and they had uh uh they had the the Star of David over here all the symbols of all the religions because they're trying to promote this one world religion I'm sorry I'm not trying to be different but that's blasphemy there's only one true God and his name is Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what the Bible tells us there's only one true God hallelujah but see that's the they're already pushing that one world religion to the Republican party and I'm not democrat or republican I voted a long time ago I voted for Jesus Hallelujah that's the sign I got in my front yard 2020 24 Jesus is our only hope amen hallelujah now I'll vote probably Republican right because I always do but it's it's ultimately in God's hands amen God will raise up whatever leader he wants and he'll pull down the other ones amen so all we can do is go say pray God give us the Right leader Hallelujah his timing is perfect he's right all the time we're wrong all the time God's right amen hallelujah see this is how they crucified Jesus today churches Jesus said in John or I'm sorry Jesus said in Matthew 7:14 broad is the way that leads to destruction and many go there on he said but narrow is the way that leads to life and few everybody say few few there be that find it Jesus said very few people out of these eight billion very few are going to find it what's a few out of eight billion I don't know maybe a million I don't know half a million Jesus said few there be that find it Hallelujah so thank God that we found the narrow road that leads to life I found that road and that road is named Jesus because he's the way he's the road amen he's the way the truth and the life Hallelujah no man comes under the father except through Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's right thank God uh they shall speak with new tongues I've heard speaking in tongues my whole life amen we've heard in our church six times by God's grace speaking in tonu is real now there's a lot of impersonations of it there's a lot of wrong but there is a genuine real one Hallelujah and if they say there's not they're cruci ifying the Son of God aresh 18 and this is what Moses was speaking of Christ was the rock we'll show that in a little bit and they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I just saw this out in Iowa a couple weeks ago remember that testimony that young mother the doctor said uh all your arteries are clogged up and you don't have much time to live I I don't remember all the details but I just prayed for her and the next day Monday she went back or two days later she went back and she had another EKG and she said her heart was completely f and she's a nurse Hallelujah I just laid hands on the sick and they recover just like Jesus said amen it wasn't me it wasn't my ability I just did what he said that's all Moses can do that's all you and I can do just do what Jesus says hallelujah now we don't take up serpents that means you get bit by a serpent while you're out doing the work of God right just like Paul remember on the island of Mita it bit him he threw it off in the fire that's what we got to do now remember that we just got to cast down anything that bites you just cast it down and move on Amen evil thought bites you just throw it down keep moving on Hallelujah Glory now what verse did I say I want to bring up I already forgot it yes thank you hey buddy got great job First Corinthians 10 great job proud so proud of you buddy 1 Corinthians 10 not in a prideful way you know uh in a humble way Glory ah verse four and did and all did drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that foued them and that rock was Christ Christ was the rock that Moses smoked right and he smoked it once it didn't bring water he smoked it twice and then it brought out water Hallelujah see that's what that represented even in Moses's failure God uses our failures to glorify him Church don't we know Romans 28 that God will make all things work together for our good because we love him and we're called according to his purpose amen we ought to know that by now amen God will take our mistakes amen and it'll make it glorify him Hallelujah I I know this as a fact in all my mistakes as a pastor or father or husband I always see how I learn something very valuable from that now sometimes I even forget it and I need to be reminded again but I know in some of my biggest mistakes I'm like oh that's right I know I shouldn't have done that now and it's it's just amazing it's like the holy spirit will bring those things to my remembrance right when I need them not to repeat that same mistake twice what is that that's God giving me more grace I don't deserve it I didn't earn it but it's God giving us more grace because he's a loving God he's a god of Second Chances third chances fourth chances he's the god of 490 chances because Peter said I'll forgive seven times Lord he said 70 times seven amen he's the god of 490 chances hallelujah oh my we know there's many more than that now remember Church you know we and I'll say like this I pull up Galatians 2:20 I preached this a few years ago at one of our Easter services I'm sorry Good Friday services and I said this I brought up the scripture and I showed how just a simple idea you and we will either crucify Christ and or or we crucify our own will so there's going to be a crucifixion in our lives one or the other Hallelujah so we must make the decision I'm going to Crucify My sinful desires every day I'm gonna die to myself look what Paul said what did Paul said Paul said I am crucified with Christ amen hallelujah nevertheless I still live now the other verse says he dies daily we'll pull up that one next remember that brother Austin yet thank you sir yet not I but Christ liveth in me so the only way Christ can live in US is if we crucify the Bible said the lust and the affections thereof every day I told this to Malachi I've told this to my children my family every day I got to crucify the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh your body wants something you you're not supposed to have or the pride of life you want to chase that Almighty dollar every day it's like you go to bed you got the victory you wake up and there it is and you got to crucify it again I just wish you would stay dead amen right just wish you'd stay dead but no we got to be like Jesus we got to be like Paul told us and we we must crucify our desires and our and and we must learn to be a real disciple of Jesus Christ we must take up our cross and follow Jesus Hallelujah just like he took up the cross for us hallelujah he said the life which I Live Now In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God see you don't live by your faith you live by Christ's faith we already read it in Ephesians 2 Faith is a gift of God see you live by Christ's Faith Christ Christ gives you the anointing of his faith who loved me and gave himself for me Church you are loved by God tonight you're loved by God he gave himself for you right that he might he might uh save you and then he might uh make you zealous over your the purpose for your life not for somebody else's life for your life don't try to be like anybody else now you can find somebody in the Bible if they got your same gift and your same calling amen but don't patter yourself I gotta be like that guy I gotta be like that you got to be exactly who God made you to be Hallelujah just be yourself just be who God made you to be praise God everything will work out now Die daily I didn't forget this time 1 Corinthians 15 we're already in chapter 10 that worked out pretty good but my Bible there it is uh 10:31 I'm sorry 1531 sorry 1531 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily he said I'm crucified with Christ and I must die every single day so church now we can plainly see why Moses had to Smite The Rock twice right he had to be smitten on Calvary and at the last time he had to be smitten because the world's going to reject him the world's going to crucify him and they're going to accept the Antichrist think about that he's going to sit in the temple of God he's going to sit in the rebuilt Jewish temple whenever gets rebuilt and he's going to declare that he is God and exalting himself above all that's called God and they're going to want that rather than Christ Jesus that's right that's what the Bible said he's got to be crucified at the end time right but we'll know the Bible says we have wisdom to know that Antichrist hallelujah we're not all left without a witness we're not all helpless or hopeless we've got the wisdom of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah his number 666 is is easily found by vicarius and I can't say that fil day you know how to say it fil day that means Vicor of the son of God who's the Vicor of the Son of God the pope of Rome right the vicer that's what that's his title Vicor of the Son of God that means he's the substitute for the Son of God no he's not no he's not most of all his teachings are outside of what Jesus said Hallelujah I don't have time to go into that but I got videos on that if you want to listen to that one about God's grace I just put them out last week all so and three times you know God's Propet brother brandom said that uh Christ was going to be crucified a second time right we see that because he's going to be rejected Christ is going to be rejected uh the Bible said there must become a great Falling Away first remember that verse second I think it's second Timothy 3 let's read that so that's that's the falling away they're going to crucify and put him to an open shame I think it's second Timothy 3 well this I'm sorry this is this will work but I'll I'll find the other one too uh 2 Timothy 3:1 this know also that in the last days perilous that means Troublesome how how many know we got trouble in America there's trouble all around the world perilous time shall come for men should be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents see children need to obey their parents the Bible says that will be a condition of the end time unth thank ful Unholy they don't live a separated life under god without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away all right that's the first one no notice in the last times all these conditions are going to happen in church these things are found in churches right we don't find these just out in this out in the world this is found in the churches right they love Pleasures more than lovers of God if the pastor preaches longer than 15 minutes I'm walking out of the church you've already sat through 45 minutes God bless you right they don't sing my song I'm complaining to the Deacon board just they just love love themselves more than they love God you know they they'll build I'll say like this they'll build themselves a million dollar house but how much are they giv to the missionary World it won't put nothing in the missionary plate building up your retirement what about the kingdom of God got to give themselves a pool and a sauna and all these things and if you just got rid of the pool you could to send that $10,000 and give a a church uh food for a whole month or two months but you've got to have your swimming pool I don't know why I'm preaching on swimming pools maybe I'll find out tonight maybe somebody will send me a message on YouTube um thanks for I was just going to buy a pool no I'm not going to buy a pool wouldn't that be great Hallelujah I think the other one if I'm not this is my memory now I'm going by memory so forgive me uh 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 it's right before Timothy second Thessalonians I believe this is the Fall Away brother William it might be he's saying amen so hopefully we're both right here yeah there it is verse three yes sir second Timothy 2:3 this is speaking of the Antichrist let no man deceive you by any means see don't any preacher deceive you make sure he's preaching the word of God for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first there it is there's that crucifying Christ a second time just like Moses showed us and that man of sins that's the Antichrist the son of predition means destruction who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he is God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God so there is coming an antichrist he's going to sit in the Jewish temple once it's rebuilt and he whatever he says he's going to magnify himself above the Bible above Jesus Christ Hallelujah but in order for this to happen the churches have to fall away from the truth they have to crucify the Son of God in order to receive the son of predition think about that they're going to crucify the Lord Jesus Christ in the spiritual realm not the physical everybody catch that he's not going to be crucified a second time physically it's going to be spiritually but you and I are not going to do that we're going to crucify our fleshly sinful desires and we're going to live by the faith of Jesus Christ Hallelujah God help us I imagine we're get some good preaching on that this weekend so I'm looking forward to that he's going to come in here and preach on crucify with Christ or something God can do whatever he wants I'm just I'm hope I'm hoping by God's grace amen now I want to read a story where uh brother brandom tells a story this is from 1963 where he let God down you might remember this there was a woman brother R prayed for um and God healed her temporarily but then she went in the hospital and she died and she was a young mother she had at least one child remember do you remember this story um and the woman died and brother R was all confused and he tells us the story he says Lord God you owe me an understanding after me go going out there and telling that husband and him coming to the Lord after You' done these things for him and all like that and then you take his wife like that so brother Rah was upset Lord uh you just saved this wife's husband and now you took his wife you owe me an understanding brother Braham said when you tell God something like that he's going to leave you sitting alone now think about Moses right Moses neglected to circumcise his son and God was going to come after after him kill him brother Brandon speaks in a prideful way and says God you owe me something and God left him he said for a couple days we even couldn't even feel the couldn't even feel the spirit of God for a couple days see because we get prideful right we say things shouldn't say right we get prideful uh we think we know something we think we we deserve something right God owes God doesn't owe us nothing God doesn't owe you and I God doesn't owe me anything right because he already paid it all he already gave me everything he already gave me eternal life Hallelujah he already gave me forgiveness of all my sins Hallelujah he says he don't owe me nothing now this is the Old Kentucky grammar from n 1963 he don't owe me nothing I'm in debt to him well God just let me pout it out for a few days you know so brother R Likens himself to a little baby pouting see that's how humble brother Brandon was I was just like a baby pouting God why don't I feel your presence all these days are going by I don't feel you I don't feel like you're talking to me and God had to show him it's because you exalted yourself sound like Moses sound like anyone familiar you know that sometimes exalts themselves and says prideful things oh you don't have to say Amen but you know who it is it's you it's me like God why didn't you heal this person why did this person die right and and we might say it out loud now surely we think it but God keep us from saying it out loud help me not to think that Lord forgive me Jesus you know I trust you especially when tragedies happen that's when we're most tempted to speak against God because we think we want we think our life should go our way rather than God's way God has a perfect plan remember the Bible says people don't consider when people die tragically people don't consider that God is sparing them from an awful future where's that verse anybody remember that verse I don't have it on my I don't have it up here right now people don't consider that they don't consider that but God in his Mercy he knows the right time to take people right he took his own son after 33 years and he never sinned he never did anything wrong yet God's timing is perfect he works at the pace of perfection the church said brother Aaron's sermon still with you everybody still got your first love Brother Paul's sermon still with you Hallelujah well he just let me pot it out for a few days and after about three or four months one day I was sitting on the creek bank and the Lord spoke to me in a vision and said now go to her mother and say this to her mother did not her time to die come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek at a picnic so the Lord show brother Bram that mother should have died a year ago she was swimming and she was drowning in the water but God spared her life for one more year to spare her and then also save her husband see so God gave her extra year of Mercy Hallelujah see he he didn't know that when he said you owe me uh this doesn't make sense this is not the way I thought it should go he wasn't thinking that when he said that he didn't know that church there's a lot of things we don't know the Bible says God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are so much higher than our ways he knows just how to do it amen he knows just how to design your life my life he knows exactly what to do at just exactly the right time he doesn't need to be questioned he needs to be worshiped he needs to be believed that's what he deserves man brother man say the Lord told him she should have went out and gone to heaven at that time but I had to take her when she was ready to go so she herself wasn't ready she would have went to hell and she drowned there but God gave her another year to get right that's the God we serve amen a god who's rich in Mercy he said then I got down and cried imagine brother getting down and PR he said Lord Jesus forgive me your poor stupid servant I should have never said that Lord a servant of God who's preached all his life and dedicate his whole life to Jesus Christ he said Lord I'm so sorry I should not have said that I'm just poor I'm just a poor stupid person sometimes Church don't we feel like that way some way we're just don't don't you feel like Paul sometimes I'm the chief of all Sinners I feel like Paul sometimes Lord why am I such a failure why do I fall short in this why Lord forgive me but Lord it keeps us humble and it makes us more like Moses Hallelujah remembering the grace of God REM remembering that God wants to pour out an extra portion of Grace upon us how be thankful for God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah I think I'll close in just a moment here let me uh I think I'll close with this here go to Romans 4 this a for scripture but I'm going to close with this Romans chapter 4 keep your spot at verse I'm going to read this quotation again from William brandham I just want to read this briefly I'm almost at an hour I'm at 53 minutes think of that 53 minutes on a Wednesday night I'm talking about closing already um before we read Romans 4 brother Bram said a man walked up you and said uh he was attacking God he said brother Bram God is unjust God because he let Moses down he said Moses toiled with those Hebrews for 40 years in the wilderness and let him down because he wouldn't let him go into the promised land so see a man's attacking God to brother brandham what does brother Ram say brother Ram said oh nonsense I'll say like this God don't let anybody down Hallelujah God won't let you down God doesn't let me down God gives us exactly and if our heart's in the right spot we recognize God's hand is in this and the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah God doesn't let people know God doesn't fail that's what I'm saying God doesn't fail us God does exactly what he wants to do and it's exactly for our good the Bible says somehow it's going to work out for our good Hallelujah it has to he's the author and finisher of our faith that means he authored it he wrote it all out and then he's going to make sure it comes to pass he's going to bring to pass everything in your life that needs to come to pass not that you want to come to pass but what you need to come to pass amen I teach that in first grade there's a difference boys and girls between wants and needs you can't have everything you want but you sure got to have your needs if you're going to survive I feel like I'm in teacher mode already two weeks early amen but that's for us God's not going to give you what you want God's going to give you what you need Hallelujah am just like he gave Moses amen he gave him what he needed he needed correction because he was exalting himself he needed an angel to chase him down I'm going to kill you because he neglected his son he needed to see God's grace on his wife his wife saving his life and and you know William brandham said that William brandham said Zapora was God's choice for Moses and if you know it God chose your SP for you too God chose brother amen just for you I know she's amen God chose my wife just for me she put her right there when I was 17 and right when I needed a a girlfriend I thought I needed a girlfriend God said I'm giving you a wife I'll take it Hallelujah uh August what was it August 29th August 28th was our first date 1998 24 26 years we're going to celebrate that together by God's grace but brother brandom looked at that preacher said nonsense God didn't let Moses down he let Moses into the promised land 1500 years later amen hallelujah amen he if you go to Matthew we don't have to go there but Matthew 17 you know who did who did Peter James and John see on Mount transfig ation he saw Elijah and who who did he see Moses made it to the promised land God Will Never Let You Down hallelujah amen glory if you've got a desire on your heart and it's a Godly desire God will make sure you have that desire amen you might not see it on this side but you will see it sometime hallelujah amen but R said Moses was as alive as he ever was amen standing there talking to Jesus before Jesus went to Calvary him and Elijah standing together talking imagine not only did God let Moses in there God let him talk to his own son the sinless beloved Son of God he got let he got to talk to the Lamb of God and get him ready to go to the Cross hallelujah oh my Moses and Elijah appeared to Jesus Peter James and John on Mount Transfiguration Moses was not dead he was alive God didn't let him down he made it into Palestine oh I love the word of God don't you glory but said see the grace of God provided that for Moses God's grace so God didn't fail him God can't fail that preacher's that preacher is crazy that would say God failed he's a crazy preacher don't listen to him now I'm closing with this I preach hour I'm so 58 minutes man you remember this um Romans 4:18 who against hope believed in hope so in other words Moses was I'm sorry Abraham now is believing in the impossible now we're just showing a we're just showing the power of forgiveness with these verses okay I know talking about Abraham but remember God showed the same forgiveness to Moses God could have killed him maybe three times at least two it looks like for sure because he killed another man and they didn't circumcise gers God was chasing him down to kill him he says who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which is spoken so shall thy SE be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb so they were both so old at 190 that the reproductive parts weren't working it was dead they're no longer working but because God had come to Moses and come to Sarah he believed that God would do it because he had a promise and so any promise in the Bible we can have hope in even if it doesn't look like God's going to do it God will do it Hallelujah God will perform it praise God verse 20 and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God now any Bible reader knows Mo or Abraham staggered at least five times right he went down to Egypt he went to the king ailec he laughed at God's promise and I remember that Genesis 17:17 he laughed at God he laughed in God's face right he took Hagar I mean he did he he just he made numerous mistakes but when God records Abraham's life God doesn't remember the mistakes Hallelujah that's an act of God's grace Hallelujah he didn't stagger he didn't stumble at the promise of God he was strong in faith giving God glory that's what we need to do tonight give God glory in the midst of our trials amen even if the promise hasn't happened yet trust God give God glory because it will come to pass if God promis it amen verse 21 he was fully persuaded that what God had promised he was able to perform and therefore was imputed to him for right righteousness and it was not written for his sake Alone Oh I like that one amen he said it wasn't for him alone he said that it was imputed to him he said but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification see this was written not just for Abraham's sake it was written for our sake amen that we should be strong in faith just give God glory as we wait on the promise even after we make mistakes just remember God will give you more grace he'll forgive all your mistakes and he'll call you an overcomer and he'll reward you and answer your prayer and he'll give you that promise that you waited so long for because God is rich in Mercy Hallelujah last quote William brandham said when I think of Abraham all the mistakes he made and Moses his mistakes but but when Abraham's commentary was written in Romans 4 the Divine commentary was written Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief no no never was even accounted to him glory Paul said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God and William Bram said my humble prayer before the grace of God that's here this evening I hope my testimonies wrote like that that God won't see my mistakes and that's true because it said this is written not just for Abraham's sake but for us also amen he says that when my commentary is written my obituary that it won't be read out that I made mistakes and done wrong but God will only see the things that I tried to do for him he'll take the grace of God that I believed in and that's what I'm solely trusting in for upon my merits I could no more go to heaven than any of the rest but upon the grace of God I'm depending yes it's Grace that I'm depending on Amen let's stand to our feet musicians can come let's give God a round of applause amen hallelujah let's sing that of course your grace still Amazes Me Your Grace is still a mystery amen how many thankful for God's Amazing Grace tonight that's exactly one hour praise the Lord amen worked out really good we sure love the word of God don't we hear we love the word of God hallelujah despite all of our failures despite all our mistakes our sins our iniquities our transgressions God says I'm going to give you more grace I might chase you down until you repent but I'm going to do it because I love you God loved Moses God said Moses you're the meekest man on this Earth remember God said there in numbers 12 he told he told Aaron and Miram there's none like Moses on the whole earth you know I'll give people dreams and Visions but Moses isn't like that I talk to him face to face he's such a he's such a friend to me praise God he's such a friend but yet God in his Mercy would chase him down to get him to recognize his neglect and show him that he should obey the word of God how many thankful for amazing Grace tonight let's have a word of prayer as we pray just talk to the Lord you I'm not saying somebody failed this week I don't know if you failed this week but if you did let me encourage you there's Grace for you there's more grace God is he's Eternal he doesn't run out of Grace Hallelujah you might feel like a poor stupid servant like brother BR and we don't like to use those words I don't call people those words I hardly ever use those words but you might feel like a failure but yet God will give you more grace let's just pray and talk to the Lord father God we thank you for tonight lord it's been such a blessing to be in the house of the Lord here tonight Lord God to sing to Worship You Lord to pray to hear the word of God Lord that's such an encouragement to our lives Lord God I'm thankful for the message of Grace

Lord God that we would recognize how freely you forgive us and you give us more grace you don't record when we stagger at the things of God you don't record it in heaven yes we must be corrected here on Earth we might get get chased down here on Earth but in heaven it's not recorded because it wasn't recorded about Abraham and Lord we know also in Romans 4 it says David said the blessedness of this man to whom the Lord will not impute his iniquity hallelujah thank you Lord David never lost his salvation he just lost the joy of it Lord God so Lord may we have the joy of Salvation here tonight Lord God give us Grace Lord God to remember you're a jealous God to give you all of our time all of our praise all of our worship may we not try to love the world or the things of the world

might live in us because we live by the faith of the Son of God bless your people hear their prayers tonight I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen let's sing this song If anyone desires prayer you can
