[46:15] have them tonight let's go to First
[46:17] Peter chapter
[46:19] 4 by the grace of the
[46:21] Lord like to take a little different
[46:24] thought last few Services you know we've
[46:26] had some guest Ministry and it's really
[46:29] inspired me a little bit to uh Go a
[46:32] different direction we've been you know
[46:33] doing the Ephesians series and so forth
[46:37] but I really want to look at this
[46:38] thought let's go to Ephesian I'm sorry
[46:39] First Peter chapter
[46:43] 4 I think I'll start this little Series
[46:46] tonight I got about 30 I got about 45
[46:49] minutes now to preach on this and we'll
[46:51] try to finish it Sunday morning Sunday
[46:54] night like I said we like to do a Comm
[46:55] communion service on Sunday night with
[46:57] feet
[46:58] washing and we're willing to do that and
[47:00] I really felt GL to do that since we
[47:02] have the new new Believers being
[47:04] baptized tonight I want to give them a
[47:06] chance to partake in communion by God's
[47:09] grace communion was also preached by
[47:11] Brother Jim last Sunday so I thought I
[47:13] just felt a burden felt like I need to
[47:15] call communion by God's grace yeah so
[47:18] First Peter chapter 4 brother amen if
[47:20] you're not here then remind me we'll
[47:21] have to set up a a communion shortly
[47:23] after so you can take communion I forgot
[47:26] about that you'll be out you're probably
[47:27] working this Sunday right yes okay yeah
[47:29] remind me on that wey surely want you to
[47:31] be a part of that by God's grace 1 Peter
[47:34] chapter
[47:37] 4 like to start at verse 12 1 Peter 4:12
[47:41] I've had a title tonight like I said I
[47:42] like to take a little different thought
[47:43] I kind of want to deal with salvation a
[47:44] little bit uh I'd like to deal with this
[47:47] title called scarcely saved scarcely
[47:50] lost I got to kind of deal with that
[47:52] little thought right out of here on the
[47:54] scripture first Peter 4 verse 12 there
[47:58] say amen amen beloved think it not
[48:01] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[48:03] is to try you ever think it's strange
[48:05] When Trials Come Peter said don't think
[48:07] it's strange right as though some
[48:11] strange thing happened unto
[48:13] you but Rejoice wow so when you go
[48:16] through a fire trial
[48:18] rejoice in as much as you are partakers
[48:20] of Christ's sufferings that when his
[48:23] glory shall be revealed you may be glad
[48:25] also with exceeding
[48:28] Joy now look at this in verse 14 if you
[48:31] bear the reproach of Christ if ye be
[48:33] reproach for the name of Christ happy
[48:36] are ye so if you suffer persecution for
[48:38] the name of Christ you should be
[48:40] happy for the spirit of glory and of God
[48:43] resteth upon you that's why you're being
[48:45] persecuted because the glory of God is
[48:47] resting upon you if it wasn't it
[48:49] wouldn't persecute
[48:51] you on their part he's evil spoken of so
[48:54] they speak evil of God or the word that
[48:56] you believe but on your part he's
[48:58] glorified amen but let none of you
[49:01] suffer as a murderer so this is when you
[49:03] sin that's not suffering for being a
[49:05] Christian so let none of you suffer as a
[49:07] murderer or as a thief if you steal
[49:09] something and get persecuted that's not
[49:11] God's that doesn't have nothing to do
[49:12] with God God didn't anoint you to do
[49:13] that or as an evildoer or as a busy body
[49:17] in other men's matters so gossiping Goss
[49:20] is you don't get if you get persecuted
[49:21] for gossiping that's you deserve that
[49:24] right verse 16
[49:26] yet if any man suffer as a Christian
[49:28] amen let him not be ashamed but let him
[49:32] glorify God on this behalf I got to
[49:35] suffer because I'm a Christian praise
[49:37] God I glorify God for that now verse 17
[49:41] so Peter is speaking about Christian
[49:43] persecution right and now he gets into
[49:46] judgment Jud Judgment Day for the time
[49:48] has come that judgment must begin where
[49:52] at the house of
[49:54] God if it
[49:56] first begin at us what shall the end be
[49:59] of them that obey not the gospel so
[50:02] judgment starts here what's going to
[50:04] happen what's G to be the end of those
[50:05] people that aren't
[50:06] here Verse 18 here's where I got my
[50:09] title and if the righteous scarcely be
[50:12] saved where shall the ungodly and The
[50:15] Sinner
[50:16] appear wherefore let them that suffer
[50:18] according to the will of God so if
[50:20] you're suffering and you're in God's
[50:21] will commit the keeping of your of their
[50:24] souls to him in
[50:26] wello as unto a faithful Creator let's
[50:29] bow our heads in a word of prayer if you
[50:30] have a need on your heart just make it
[50:31] known unto God scarcely save scarcely
[50:34] lost let's look at this thought here
[50:36] Heavenly Father Lord we have needs Upon
[50:37] Our Hearts speak to us here tonight Lord
[50:40] we're having we're planning on a shorter
[50:41] service help me Lord God to find the
[50:43] thoughts and just lead me and guide me
[50:45] if my notes don't match the needs of the
[50:47] people as you led me to these thoughts I
[50:49] pray just guide me away from them that
[50:51] your people might be blessed and
[50:52] received from you tonight for you are
[50:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:56] strengthen us feed us help us correct us
[50:59] Lord God and raise us up if we're
[51:01] downtrod and raise us up heal us if
[51:03] we're sick oh God we need you tonight
[51:05] Lord minister to your children we love
[51:06] you so much with all of our hearts in
[51:09] Jesus Christ's name the church said amen
[51:11] God bless you you're being seated there
[51:13] praise
[51:13] God so we want to take this thought
[51:16] scarcely saved scarcely lost as the
[51:18] title says I'm dealing with um I'm
[51:22] dealing with those that are right near
[51:24] the borderline of being saved and being
[51:26] lost some will be scarcely saved some
[51:30] will be scarcely lost okay so I want to
[51:33] just look at that thought here Mal I do
[51:35] have a little slideshow buddy so if you
[51:36] can get
[51:37] that remote I'd appreciate that I'd like
[51:40] to look at this little thought here
[51:42] tonight by the grace of the Lord and I
[51:45] know it would be a blessing to you and
[51:47] going to bring it all the way down you
[51:48] know this is a trying time thank you sir
[51:51] and we got to be
[51:53] ready okay it's on all right
[51:56] uh you know a lot I just want to say a
[51:57] few things you know A lot's happened in
[51:58] the nation this past week and you you
[52:01] notice a lot of racial things uh but I
[52:04] want you to know a lot of that is just
[52:05] being done for
[52:07] Ratings uh for television
[52:10] ratings uh for example I was talking to
[52:13] a police officer yesterday and I said
[52:15] you know it's a shame all this things
[52:16] and and he said you know he said a lot
[52:18] of that is done we've seen that happen
[52:19] for years he said a lot of that is done
[52:21] is just for Ratings the media will catch
[52:23] one bad example of maybe a cop being un
[52:26] unjustice or something like that and if
[52:28] and if that cop was unjust then they
[52:30] should receive Justice right uh but most
[52:34] cops how many hundreds of thousands of
[52:35] cops around the nation are good cops and
[52:38] they save people they help people right
[52:41] they try to bring people you know help
[52:42] and so forth like that uh so one thing
[52:45] we don't want to get is our evil spirit
[52:46] on us a root of
[52:49] bitterness uh and remember that God
[52:52] loves all people no matter your skin
[52:54] color praise the Lord uh you know uh I
[52:58] used to be a tease a lot you know
[52:59] because my skin was always darker than
[53:01] everybody's in school you know when they
[53:03] call me they they called me they said I
[53:05] was a black boy when I was in school I
[53:07] got so dark I don't get I kind of get
[53:08] dark now but I was so dark when I was
[53:10] younger some people thought I was black
[53:13] because I just spent all summer out in
[53:14] the sun I get really really dark and
[53:16] they used to call me evil names and make
[53:18] me cry it would you know I go home to my
[53:20] Daddy and tell my dad you know he's
[53:22] white as all white can be you know I
[53:24] tell my dad so he used to call me you're
[53:26] my only black son Jesse that's what he
[53:27] used to tell me and it made me feel good
[53:30] that he was proud of me even though my
[53:31] skin was a lot darker than everybody
[53:32] else you know I got pictures I was
[53:34] really dark as a child really dark uh
[53:37] but you know there's always been so I've
[53:40] experienced a little bit of that and and
[53:42] when I was I'm Mexican or Spanish or
[53:43] Indian whatever I don't I'm gonna find
[53:45] out pretty soon here they would call me
[53:47] evil names for Mexicans you know they
[53:49] call me all those evil names I had to
[53:52] deal with that and so I've dealt with
[53:53] racism just a little bit I just want to
[53:56] say you know just keep your heart
[53:57] positive and love everybody pray for
[54:00] those if they done wrong pray for Mercy
[54:02] you pray the Justice be done but pray
[54:03] that God will change their hearts and
[54:05] they'll repent of the evil they've done
[54:06] if they've shot and killed somebody or
[54:07] they've done some evil God can change a
[54:10] murderer's heart look at Saul look at
[54:12] Moses he was a murderer and God got a
[54:14] hold of his heart right but the fact is
[54:16] Media pumps it up and they put it on
[54:18] Facebook and Twitter and they got all
[54:19] this tension on it so it creates better
[54:21] ratings for them that's what they're
[54:23] trying to do if you if you look at the
[54:26] whole skate of the United States is
[54:28] there uh officers in every town in every
[54:30] state doing these kind of evil things
[54:32] that maybe one or two did no they're
[54:34] blowing it up to try to get people have
[54:37] ratings and and Satan loves to do that
[54:39] doesn't he but the Holy Ghost loves to
[54:41] bring Divine love praise the Lord just
[54:44] keep that in your hearts and mind yes
[54:45] there some there's an evil cop there's
[54:47] bad cops out there guess what there's
[54:49] bad preachers out there there's bad
[54:51] mothers out there that do evil things
[54:54] there's bad teachers I'm in the teacher
[54:55] profession there's bad doctors out there
[54:57] isn't there pray for them pray for them
[55:00] but not all are like that and we don't
[55:02] want to get caught up in an evil spirit
[55:04] I just I didn't a chance to say that
[55:05] Sunday I just I could have said more but
[55:07] I just never stopped right there I want
[55:08] to do a little bit teaching there but if
[55:09] you have any questions about that you
[55:11] know just pray and maybe call me or
[55:13] email me or something like that but the
[55:15] thing to do in this hour is have Divine
[55:16] love the Bible said it's going to be
[55:18] like the days of Noah Jesus said that in
[55:20] Matthew 24 and Luke 17 as it was in the
[55:23] days of Noah and lot so shall it be in
[55:25] the days of the coming of the son of man
[55:28] what was Noah's day all violence it was
[55:31] sons of God that looked at sexy dressed
[55:32] women they saw the daughters of men and
[55:34] marry them based upon their looks rather
[55:36] than their Godly character right it was
[55:39] full of violence and lots day was
[55:41] homosexuality right so look at the
[55:43] combination that's what we should expect
[55:45] yeah that's that's that's what the
[55:46] nation's never going to repent but the
[55:48] bride will amen she'll get her life
[55:51] right she'll get filled with the Holy
[55:52] Ghost she'll be serving Jesus all right
[55:54] now let's look at this scarcely saved
[55:56] scarcely
[55:57] lost now I just want to uh go back over
[56:00] the scripture let's go to so let's go
[56:01] back to 1 Peter 4 I want to start at
[56:03] verse 16 yet if any man suffers a
[56:06] Christian let him not be ashamed but let
[56:07] him glorify God on this behalf so if you
[56:11] suffer if you're a Christian and you get
[56:12] persecuted just for being a Christian
[56:14] you should glorify God for that I think
[56:16] a brother amen you know he's taking the
[56:18] stand as a chrisan as a message believer
[56:20] and he's taken persecution from his
[56:22] family for that some of you also have
[56:23] done that right and that's suffering
[56:25] just for being a Christian you haven't
[56:27] done nothing wrong you just decided to
[56:29] take the way with the Lord's despise few
[56:32] and you suffer because that you should
[56:33] glorify God because of that amen verse
[56:36] 17 for the time has come that judgment
[56:39] must begin at the house of God and if it
[56:41] first begin at us what should be the end
[56:43] of them that obey not the gospel so
[56:45] notice the US in this scripture is those
[56:48] who are in the house of God and not just
[56:51] in the house of God but obeying God
[56:54] because the phes and Sadducees and aans
[56:57] they were all in a house of God they
[56:58] thought they they claimed to be in the
[57:00] house of God did they not but that's not
[57:02] where the real judgment was going forth
[57:04] they were reading Moses's law but God
[57:06] had moved on past Moses and moved into
[57:09] the New Testament praise God so we're
[57:11] talking about us of that day Paul was
[57:14] Peter's Church the message of the hour
[57:17] praise God that's what we have today we
[57:18] have Pentecostals but they're living off
[57:20] the message of another hour lutherans
[57:23] are two hours or three hours behind that
[57:26] right Wesley and uh they're two hours
[57:29] behind that and so that's not the
[57:31] message of the hour the US is the
[57:33] message of the hour who God is working
[57:35] with right now and that's us amen so
[57:38] judgment begins with us right uh and if
[57:43] if if if the righteous be scarcely saved
[57:45] amongst us what about those that don't
[57:48] obey the gospel so the fact that you're
[57:50] here tonight proves you want to obey the
[57:52] gospel amen that ought to make you happy
[57:54] and rejoice amen now Verse 18 here's why
[57:56] I want to start getting down to a little
[57:57] bit of teaching on the three kinds of
[58:00] Believers in four classes maybe you
[58:02] never heard that before but brother Ram
[58:03] taught that okay so let's look at this
[58:05] verse
[58:06] 18 and if the righteous scarcely be
[58:09] saved now scarcely means hardly if the
[58:12] righteous scarcely be
[58:16] saved where shall the ungodly and sinner
[58:19] appear now notice he he names three
[58:21] there righteous ungodly sinner
[58:25] but if you take the US in verse 17 now
[58:27] you got four
[58:29] groups and that's exactly what Jesus
[58:31] said there are four kinds of Hearts
[58:33] every person on the entire Earth Falls
[58:36] within one of the four kinds of hearts
[58:38] and the seed of the word is planted on
[58:40] all four Hearts praise God and each each
[58:44] heart produces a different crop if any
[58:46] right amen so if the righteous scarcely
[58:50] be saved where shall the ungodly and
[58:52] sinner appear so my title is scarcely
[58:54] saved scarcely right or scarcely lost so
[58:56] I'm dealing right with that line between
[58:58] being saved and being lost we're dealing
[59:00] with that line there and so today's
[59:02] service and then Sunday morning we're
[59:04] going to deal with that and just show uh
[59:06] the characteristics of these people uh
[59:08] that are scarcely saved and then
[59:10] scarcely lost and it'll help you by
[59:12] God's grace I know it will by God's
[59:14] grace so uh scarcity also means very
[59:17] rarely so if the rightous very rarely be
[59:19] saved where should the ungodly and
[59:21] sinner appear amen all right that's
[59:24] quite a sobering thought right pretty
[59:26] sobering hard the righteous are hardly
[59:29] saved or they're with difficulty so it's
[59:33] not it's not easily as well that's one
[59:34] of the Greek words okay so verse 19
[59:37] wherefore let them that suffer according
[59:39] to the will of God commit the keeping of
[59:42] their souls to him in well-doing as unto
[59:45] a faithful Creator so listen if you're
[59:47] suffering for a good cause you got to
[59:50] commit your soul to God and just do the
[59:52] right thing amen do well well doing
[59:56] right even when you're being treated
[59:58] evil you must treat others well that's
[1:00:00] what he's saying here commit your soul
[1:00:02] to God if they're going to mistreat me
[1:00:04] if they're going to separate from me and
[1:00:05] I have no more friends or if I have no
[1:00:07] more money because I'm cut off or
[1:00:09] whatever more whatever persecution comes
[1:00:12] upon you just do good just do what God's
[1:00:15] word said do commit your soul to God and
[1:00:17] God will take care of the rest amen
[1:00:19] that's what he's saying here now let's
[1:00:21] look at this here uh let's review this
[1:00:23] if you haven't read the church age book
[1:00:25] or maybe you haven't listened to three
[1:00:26] kinds of Believers brother Bram said
[1:00:28] there are two kind of Destinies there
[1:00:31] are the Saved and the lost Glory now
[1:00:35] those that are saved they get a new
[1:00:37] garment the Garment uh the people that
[1:00:39] get the Holy Ghost get got the Garment
[1:00:41] on right now amen because Jesus said
[1:00:44] you'll be endued with power from on high
[1:00:46] and endued means clothed with power from
[1:00:49] on high so that's in the soul so in the
[1:00:52] in the soul a Christian if you could
[1:00:53] look past the the the Flesh and the
[1:00:55] spirit down to the soul and look at
[1:00:58] their look at their soul the Soul's
[1:01:00] actually clothed with a white garment
[1:01:02] we'd say they are a saint they're
[1:01:04] walking in white amen so some people get
[1:01:08] saved now on earth right they get the
[1:01:10] white garment now but some will get the
[1:01:12] white garment at the white Throne
[1:01:14] judgment the other Destiny is lost where
[1:01:17] you burn in the Lake of Fire uh with
[1:01:19] fire and brimstone right and you'll burn
[1:01:21] burn burn and at some point you'll cease
[1:01:24] to exist total Annihilation amen not
[1:01:27] eternal life not burning eternally
[1:01:29] either but Annihilation at some point it
[1:01:31] will cease to exist all right now Within
[1:01:36] These two Destinies you have four
[1:01:38] classes you have two on each side okay
[1:01:41] so I tried to find pictures that might
[1:01:43] help you this is a picture of the Bride
[1:01:45] going in the Rapture uh the elect is the
[1:01:48] the highest quality of a Believer
[1:01:49] they're the wise version they're called
[1:01:51] holy and they can be jew or Gentile and
[1:01:54] they got the oil which is the Holy Ghost
[1:01:56] amen that's the highest quality of a
[1:01:58] Christian brother man says is a genuine
[1:02:00] Holy Ghost still believer for your day
[1:02:02] an hour you cannot get the Holy Ghost in
[1:02:04] a Baptist church today because they
[1:02:06] don't preach the whole word of God Amen
[1:02:09] right because you have some good
[1:02:10] Baptists uh in Acts chapter 19 that were
[1:02:14] baptized with Apollos but they couldn't
[1:02:16] get born again until Paul came with the
[1:02:18] Revelation on the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:20] Ghost they laid hands and they received
[1:02:22] the Holy Ghost amen Glory the next type
[1:02:26] of Saved is called the foolish virgin
[1:02:28] these are the Righteous they're not holy
[1:02:30] they're righteous but the holy ones are
[1:02:32] the ones who have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:35] Gentiles and Jews that were Souls under
[1:02:37] the altar so a a lot of people are going
[1:02:40] to be foolish virgin they'll be saved uh
[1:02:43] but they're going to be scarcely saved
[1:02:45] these are the scarcely saved right here
[1:02:47] they why are they scarcely saved because
[1:02:49] they get saved right at the white Throne
[1:02:51] judgment amen they don't have eternal
[1:02:53] life before that they're giv eternal
[1:02:55] life at the white Throne judgment now
[1:02:58] the the the first group of the Lost are
[1:03:00] the make believer these are the filthy
[1:03:03] that's a picture of Judas he's leaving
[1:03:04] he's gonna be go betray the Lord and
[1:03:06] he's gon to sell out the Lord for 30
[1:03:07] pieces of silver and this can be a Jew
[1:03:10] or Gentile or a worker of iniquity Jesus
[1:03:12] said depart from me workers of iniquity
[1:03:14] I never knew you yet you did miracles in
[1:03:17] my name right and Judas did miracles in
[1:03:19] the name of Jesus he was sent out two by
[1:03:21] two with the apostles and they come back
[1:03:23] rejoicing saying the devils are subject
[1:03:25] un us and Jesus said don't rejoice in
[1:03:27] your signs Miracles and wonders Rejoice
[1:03:30] that your name is written in heaven amen
[1:03:32] that right that's what Jesus said to
[1:03:34] Rejoice get excited about your name
[1:03:36] being written in heaven tonight amen
[1:03:39] glory and then you have the unbeliever
[1:03:41] like Pharaoh that's a picture of pharaoh
[1:03:43] from the movie about Moses right that's
[1:03:46] Pharaoh unbeliever the Bible calls them
[1:03:49] unjust and that can be jew or Gentile it
[1:03:51] can be
[1:03:52] anybody now does that help a little bit
[1:03:55] does that help okay now a few month or
[1:03:58] last fall I preached on Saul and David
[1:04:00] and I showed how uh Saul was a type of
[1:04:03] the foolish virgin and David was the
[1:04:04] type of the wise virgin now I'm not
[1:04:06] going to go through these quotes because
[1:04:07] I already went through them if you want
[1:04:09] them I can email them to you now there's
[1:04:11] two Destinies we said they're saved and
[1:04:13] lost now the saved are the vessels of
[1:04:15] Mercy the wheat are the saved the Sheep
[1:04:19] are the saved the children of God are
[1:04:20] the Saved and the good seed are the
[1:04:23] Saved these are all representing the
[1:04:25] saved amen but you have the lost the
[1:04:27] Lost are vessels of Wrath they're tears
[1:04:30] they're goats Children Of Satan and Bad
[1:04:32] Seed oh my I'm glad I'm none of those
[1:04:35] amen amen I'm glad thank God for his
[1:04:38] mercy so but brother Brandon preaches
[1:04:41] this message and he says in 1963 he says
[1:04:43] I've always preached there's three kinds
[1:04:45] of Believers and that's true so you have
[1:04:48] this you have three kinds of Believers
[1:04:49] you have a Believer who's saved but then
[1:04:52] you have in the lost you have a make
[1:04:54] believer like Judas and an unbeliever in
[1:04:56] the lost right you have three kinds of
[1:04:59] Believers okay brother BR teaches that
[1:05:01] here and uh it's on November 24th in the
[1:05:05] evening service I'm not going to read
[1:05:06] through that we've already read through
[1:05:07] that but the church age book brother
[1:05:09] says there's another class of believer
[1:05:11] so God gives them a greater Revelation
[1:05:14] see the word just keeps opening to us
[1:05:16] amen it keeps opening as you read more
[1:05:19] remember there's many sermons where
[1:05:20] brother said I can only hit the
[1:05:21] highlights he said you need to go back
[1:05:23] and dig and find more nuggets and things
[1:05:25] like that he said he Lov finding nuggets
[1:05:26] in the scripture well he teaches in the
[1:05:28] church age book we have another type of
[1:05:30] believer so we have three kinds of
[1:05:32] Believers right three kinds of Believers
[1:05:34] but there's two kinds of
[1:05:36] Believers there's a wise virgin or
[1:05:38] there's a foolish virgin amen they're
[1:05:41] both Believers but one only goes so far
[1:05:44] with God the other goes all the way
[1:05:46] let's go all the way with Jesus can we
[1:05:48] tonight let's go all the way with Christ
[1:05:51] amen let's not stop and say this is far
[1:05:53] as I'm going I'm not surrendering
[1:05:55] anything else I don't want any more of
[1:05:57] God we need more of God Amen that's why
[1:05:59] we come here I need more of the Lord I
[1:06:01] need growing grace I need more of him I
[1:06:04] never get enough of him that's should be
[1:06:05] our attitude tonight amen glory so we do
[1:06:09] this fits we have three kinds of
[1:06:10] Believers in four classes we have that
[1:06:15] he teaches that on page 279 of the
[1:06:16] church age book uh here's where he says
[1:06:19] it literally and it's really small I'm
[1:06:20] sorry I I didn't mean for you guys to
[1:06:22] see this he said secondly there's
[1:06:24] another class their names in The Book of
[1:06:26] Life and they come up in the second
[1:06:28] Resurrection such are the foolish virgin
[1:06:30] and the righteous okay so now let's go
[1:06:32] back to our picture here so now we have
[1:06:35] this picture we have saved or lost we
[1:06:37] have three kinds of Believers and then
[1:06:39] we have four classes within those kinds
[1:06:41] of Believers and church this is
[1:06:43] something that can only be brought out
[1:06:44] by a
[1:06:45] prophet amen you'll find other people
[1:06:48] preaching this except brother Bram amen
[1:06:50] I never heard anywhere else brother BR
[1:06:52] said there was four crosses how many
[1:06:53] knew that death when Jesus died there
[1:06:55] was actually Four crosses three on
[1:06:58] golgatha and
[1:06:59] Judas now there's the quote I don't time
[1:07:02] to read it it's from the faith once
[1:07:04] delivered to the Saints in
[1:07:06] 1953 so now you have four
[1:07:09] crosses which represents four types of
[1:07:12] classes of people you have Jesus
[1:07:14] representing the wise virgin right the
[1:07:16] most highest quality believer you have
[1:07:18] the sav Thief he was scarcely saved he
[1:07:22] was hardly saved I mean he got saved at
[1:07:25] the very last moments of his life praise
[1:07:29] God because we have scripture that shows
[1:07:31] he was mocking and making fun of Jesus
[1:07:33] the Bible says both thieves were mocking
[1:07:35] and making fun of Jesus and then he gets
[1:07:37] a heart change at the last few moments
[1:07:38] of his life amen how merciful is God to
[1:07:41] scarcely Save The Sinner amen but Jesus
[1:07:45] wasn't like that Peter wasn't like that
[1:07:47] right Peter had a few moments where you
[1:07:48] know he he he cursed God he cursed and
[1:07:51] said curse words right uh he denied
[1:07:53] Christ but then he got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:55] and spent the rest of his life serving
[1:07:57] Jesus so he was not scarcely saved amen
[1:08:00] he was well saved we' say so you have
[1:08:03] the sa them Judas hung on his own tree
[1:08:06] the Bible said hung himself on a tree
[1:08:08] cursed is he that hangs himself on a
[1:08:10] tree Jesus was hung on a tree right and
[1:08:13] then you have the lost the so brother
[1:08:14] said you have four crosses well that's
[1:08:16] because there's four classes of
[1:08:18] Believers right four kinds of people and
[1:08:21] three there's three kinds of Believers
[1:08:22] we'd say just to stay with brother Ram's
[1:08:24] terminology let's just say four classes
[1:08:26] of Believers or four classes of three
[1:08:28] Believers sorry so four classes is a
[1:08:32] clear Bible
[1:08:34] Doctrine and that's why I'm preaching on
[1:08:36] this I feel led I'm going to go with
[1:08:37] some more examples I felt led to preach
[1:08:39] on this
[1:08:41] here so we've gone through this you have
[1:08:43] two Destinies three kinds of Believers
[1:08:45] four classes within these three kinds
[1:08:48] you have four crosses brother Brandon
[1:08:50] said you have four let's read that
[1:08:52] Revelation 2211 let's read that death
[1:08:54] there's four there's four uh conditions
[1:08:58] you can be in when the Rapture takes
[1:09:00] place there's only four four
[1:09:03] conditions because there brother man
[1:09:05] said there's four classes and it's
[1:09:06] totally 100%
[1:09:09] scriptural Revelation
[1:09:11] 2211 brother amen can you read that for
[1:09:14] sir he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:09:17] still and he which is filthy let him be
[1:09:20] filthy still and he that is righteous
[1:09:22] let him be righteous still and he that
[1:09:24] is Holy let him be holy still let's say
[1:09:26] praise the Lord ready praise the Lord
[1:09:28] that's the word of God there's going to
[1:09:30] come a time when you will you will just
[1:09:32] still your your your uh condition with
[1:09:35] God will take a
[1:09:36] pause and that moment brother Ram said
[1:09:39] is the rapture amen glory he that's
[1:09:42] filthy still let him be filthy there's
[1:09:46] coming a time when he that's holy is
[1:09:48] going to be holy still forever amen
[1:09:52] GL your of the the Christian or believer
[1:09:55] that you are it's going to come to a
[1:09:56] still a pause Point amen and we want to
[1:09:59] be the ones that are holy praise God at
[1:10:03] the very least righteous right like I
[1:10:05] asked the pastor one time I said brother
[1:10:06] you you have a hundred or so people in
[1:10:08] your church you know brother mam says a
[1:10:10] holy ghost filled Christian is so hungry
[1:10:11] for the word and you see signs Miracles
[1:10:14] and wonders sometimes in their life and
[1:10:15] they love the word of God they're in the
[1:10:17] word all the way I said how come how
[1:10:19] come we look at our as pastors we look
[1:10:21] at our churches it doesn't seem like
[1:10:22] everybody's like that and he said that's
[1:10:24] easy he said I'm trying to help people
[1:10:27] to be the best Christians that they can
[1:10:28] be if the best predestinated Christian
[1:10:31] somebody can be is a foolish virgin and
[1:10:33] we're supposed to help them be the best
[1:10:35] foolish virgin they can be to God Amen
[1:10:38] but for those who are predestined to be
[1:10:40] wise virgins or Holy Ghost no Christians
[1:10:43] we're going to make you the best wise
[1:10:45] virgin you can possibly be glory because
[1:10:48] we don't know who's who praise God Only
[1:10:50] God knows but your Works tell what you
[1:10:52] are by their fruit a tree is known amen
[1:10:56] glory I thought what wise words and I
[1:10:58] really needed to hear that from a
[1:10:59] minister who's been pastoring longer
[1:11:01] than me and I thought well how come
[1:11:03] everybody says they got the Holy Ghost
[1:11:05] but we don't we don't see more of it
[1:11:07] it's prob it's probably because either's
[1:11:08] not the timing of God for maybe these
[1:11:10] things but if people don't have all the
[1:11:12] fruits and all these things in their
[1:11:13] lives then maybe the highest they can
[1:11:15] possibly live is a foolish virgin we
[1:11:17] don't know so a preacher like everybody
[1:11:19] can be a wise virgin even though we know
[1:11:21] not everybody might not become that so
[1:11:24] God help us to live the highest
[1:11:25] Christian Life we can live amen glory
[1:11:28] like what Paul say he said make your
[1:11:30] calling election sure amen so you prove
[1:11:33] to everybody by your life and show God
[1:11:36] how much you love him and serve him and
[1:11:38] do the works of God and love God and
[1:11:40] that will prove what you are God help us
[1:11:42] to prove what we are amen hallelujah
[1:11:45] Peter proved what he was and he said
[1:11:47] even though I denied him he he said
[1:11:49] Jesus you know I love you right I'm
[1:11:52] going to prove that I love you amen
[1:11:55] right and the history on St Thomas
[1:11:57] everybody gives Thomas a a hard time but
[1:11:59] all the disciples did the same thing
[1:12:01] Thomas did when when they first heard
[1:12:02] news to those women remember those women
[1:12:04] came back and said our Lord has risen
[1:12:06] they said shut up what are you talking
[1:12:07] about you women you're just silly
[1:12:09] nonsense they did the same thing right
[1:12:12] Thomas just took it a step further and
[1:12:14] said well I've got to see the nail
[1:12:15] prints I gotta see all these things like
[1:12:17] that but Thomas he proved that he was
[1:12:19] saved because he after after doubting
[1:12:22] Christ when Christ showed in himself he
[1:12:24] was the one that took the gospel
[1:12:26] farthest into Asia amen he traveled more
[1:12:29] miles than any other Apostle he was
[1:12:31] proving what was on the inside of him he
[1:12:33] did believe he just needed a little more
[1:12:35] signs to believe it and if you need a
[1:12:37] little more signs just keep asking God
[1:12:40] God will give it to you God loves you
[1:12:42] and then prove what you are amen glory
[1:12:45] give needed signs a lot of people need
[1:12:48] signs there's nothing wrong with signs
[1:12:49] but once he shows you that sign you
[1:12:51] better run with all you've got to show
[1:12:53] everybody what side you're on Amen said
[1:12:56] that's why I come to church to show the
[1:12:58] devil which side I'm on amen glory
[1:13:01] that's why I come tonight to show you
[1:13:02] which side I'm on I got about 15 minutes
[1:13:06] here to show you what side I'm G here
[1:13:09] Glory now it's scriptural Church brother
[1:13:12] BR taught this it's in the church age
[1:13:14] book he quotes all these scriptures here
[1:13:16] here's another one turn to Second
[1:13:18] Timothy 2:20 there's four types of
[1:13:20] vessels did you know that there's four
[1:13:24] conditions you can be in there's four
[1:13:25] grounds we'll get to that there's four
[1:13:27] kinds of vessels that God can use and
[1:13:29] God uses all the vessels don't say he
[1:13:31] don't use a wood vessel he does he used
[1:13:34] Pharaoh he used Judas right he used them
[1:13:37] for their purpose he pre by
[1:13:39] predestination he knew what they desire
[1:13:41] so he worked out so that they would be
[1:13:43] used for their
[1:13:44] purpose absolutely remember God had to
[1:13:47] harden Pharaoh's heart to use him for
[1:13:49] his purpose to get bring glory to
[1:13:50] himself God knew Pharaoh didn't would
[1:13:52] never believe so he would to harden his
[1:13:54] heart in order to get him to use him to
[1:13:56] glorify God and yet Pharaoh was
[1:13:59] lost second Timothy
[1:14:02] 220 but church we don't know who's lost
[1:14:04] or who's saved so make your calling
[1:14:06] elections short tonight show everybody
[1:14:08] which side show everybody who you love
[1:14:10] with all your heart Jesus Christ amen
[1:14:13] second Timothy
[1:14:14] 2:20 well Scott you got that can you
[1:14:16] read that for us sir thank
[1:14:22] you
[1:14:27] amen now I forgot verse 21 let me read
[1:14:29] that if a man therefore Purge himself
[1:14:31] from these he should be a vessel unto
[1:14:32] honor so see now Paul is saying you need
[1:14:34] to be a vessel of Honor right here's the
[1:14:37] four kind of vessels you be a vessel of
[1:14:38] Honor Sanctified and meat for the
[1:14:40] Master's use and prepared unto every
[1:14:43] good work how many love the Lord amen
[1:14:45] four kinds of vessels four kinds of
[1:14:48] conditions at the Rapture four crosses
[1:14:51] amen glory here's another one there's
[1:14:54] four kinds of grounds now we're not
[1:14:56] going to read that one uh because we
[1:14:58] we've been over that I just preached on
[1:14:59] that when we preached on the seven
[1:15:00] Parable mysteries of Jesus Christ out of
[1:15:02] Matthew 13 and brother brand preached
[1:15:04] every revealed every one of those
[1:15:05] Mysteries to us amen so there's a good
[1:15:08] ground that produces three kinds of
[1:15:10] fruit now even with now this is a little
[1:15:12] deeper inside of the Holy Ghost filled
[1:15:15] Christian there's three levels of fruit
[1:15:17] there's hundredfold there's 60-fold and
[1:15:20] there's 30-fold how many you know that
[1:15:23] glory god had I imagine Apostles might
[1:15:26] be a h
[1:15:27] hundredfold or maybe a mother that
[1:15:29] raised an apostle she might be 100 fold
[1:15:32] right because because of her faithful
[1:15:34] teaching to that Apostle she's the Fifth
[1:15:37] Gospel right he goes out there and wins
[1:15:39] Souls maybe while dad's at work you know
[1:15:41] she helps ra and the Bible said husband
[1:15:43] and wife share their heirs together the
[1:15:45] grace of life amen amen they inherit the
[1:15:47] same uh reward but within the Holy Ghost
[1:15:50] filled Christian you have those that are
[1:15:52] hfold returned
[1:15:53] 60 and 30 now that's a good message
[1:15:56] there we're going to go over that too
[1:15:57] about rewards uh there's a thorny ground
[1:16:00] where they grow for a while but they get
[1:16:03] choked out and they never produce the
[1:16:04] right fruit these are these are foolish
[1:16:07] virgin they don't get the they don't
[1:16:08] have the Holy Ghost so that they can't
[1:16:10] produce real Holy Ghost filled fruit
[1:16:12] they can't do it right then you have
[1:16:16] Stony grounds like Judas uh never had a
[1:16:18] fleshly a real heart change toward God
[1:16:21] and then you have those that are on the
[1:16:22] way side that don't even get they don't
[1:16:24] don't produce anything praise
[1:16:26] God next uh this is what we read so I
[1:16:30] added this for tonight and I got 15
[1:16:33] minutes Paul said or Peter said there's
[1:16:35] us we're the Christians he said if you
[1:16:37] suffer as a Christian he said happy are
[1:16:39] ye amen he said but if the righteous
[1:16:43] scarcely be
[1:16:45] saved where will the ungodly and The
[1:16:48] Sinner
[1:16:49] appear because these knew like Judas
[1:16:52] knew was Godly and what was ungodly did
[1:16:54] he not he sat there and heard Jesus
[1:16:56] preach for three and a half years but
[1:16:58] that's really something praise the Lord
[1:17:00] and he and he he hit it so well nobody
[1:17:02] knew when he left nobody knew at that
[1:17:04] dinner table he was going to go betray
[1:17:05] Christ now Jesus revealed to John right
[1:17:08] John was leading him his bosom John's
[1:17:10] the only one that
[1:17:11] knew but that's why they're called
[1:17:13] ungodly because they could have been
[1:17:14] Godly but they chose to be ungodly but
[1:17:18] the sinner never even was right with God
[1:17:20] never had any desire for God that's like
[1:17:22] pharaoh right oh my never repented never
[1:17:26] had never tried to even serve God just
[1:17:28] said I don't believe there's no God of
[1:17:30] Jehovah I don't believe in all these
[1:17:31] things nonsense now brother BR said this
[1:17:35] brother bam said AB lot could never be a
[1:17:38] Abraham he said Abraham was a silver
[1:17:40] dollar lot was a penny how many know he
[1:17:42] said
[1:17:43] that lot was scarcely saved that's what
[1:17:46] we're gonna preach a little bit on
[1:17:47] Sunday barely saved hardly saved the
[1:17:51] Angels had to drag him out of of Sodom
[1:17:54] the Bible said he tried to persuade him
[1:17:56] and he kept lingering they had to grab a
[1:17:57] hold of his hand and his daughter's hand
[1:17:59] and drag him out but Abraham you have to
[1:18:01] do that he was already separated he was
[1:18:03] not hanging around those
[1:18:05] sodomites Glory he was living so holy so
[1:18:09] separate he wasn't even attached to it
[1:18:10] he didn't feel any fire he didn't see
[1:18:12] any smoke or he didn't feel any smoke or
[1:18:14] anything like that now he saw from afar
[1:18:16] off but he was living so Godly out there
[1:18:18] he was a different type of Christian
[1:18:20] amen he was a higher type of Christian
[1:18:23] he was the father of the faith not
[1:18:25] impersonator of the
[1:18:27] faith amen remember the scripture we
[1:18:29] preached on lust he was tormented every
[1:18:32] day because of what he saw and what he
[1:18:34] heard because the lust of his eyes not
[1:18:37] Abraham praise God so if our eyes if
[1:18:41] we're looking at the wrong things and
[1:18:42] hearing the wrong things something's
[1:18:44] wrong with our walk with
[1:18:45] God that's that's not a wise virgin life
[1:18:49] that's a foolish Christian life now we
[1:18:50] all fall short but see your Works will
[1:18:52] prove Pro what you are if you keep
[1:18:54] enjoying those thing or keep trying to
[1:18:56] live on both sides oh
[1:18:58] my then you better get to the altar real
[1:19:01] fast right you better come out and get
[1:19:03] born again amen and receive the P power
[1:19:06] because that will take you out of that
[1:19:08] life into a life separated under Christ
[1:19:11] now Mrs lot was scarcely
[1:19:13] lost just barely lost she was on her way
[1:19:16] out and what happened brother man said
[1:19:19] it was the cries of her
[1:19:20] children right and her grandchildren the
[1:19:23] cries of her children turned her around
[1:19:24] and brother said another place she was
[1:19:26] uh going to miss all of her C parties
[1:19:28] and want to look one more time oh oh my
[1:19:30] worldly
[1:19:32] life and the Bible said she turned into
[1:19:34] a pillar of
[1:19:35] salt right scarcely lost so with this
[1:19:40] these few sermons here I'm preaching
[1:19:42] right along here to show you the
[1:19:43] difference scarcely saved scarcely lost
[1:19:46] but it'll help you if you're way out
[1:19:48] here because it shows you that you're
[1:19:49] not one of those scarcely saved amen
[1:19:51] glory it'll help you and this like I
[1:19:53] said it's right out of the scripture I
[1:19:54] felt inspired the sodomites were never
[1:19:57] even Believers in the first
[1:19:58] place Bible said they actually laughed
[1:20:01] uh the Bible that said actually lot
[1:20:03] son-in-laws actually laughed at him and
[1:20:04] said yo you're a joker you know you're
[1:20:07] sporting you that the fire and brimstone
[1:20:09] was goingon to rain out of heaven right
[1:20:11] and they laughed at and they made fun of
[1:20:13] the preacher remember brother said this
[1:20:15] is like brother Brams ministry Billy
[1:20:17] Graham and or Roberts right here yes now
[1:20:20] what about those that I don't know I'm
[1:20:21] not I don't know who to put in there I
[1:20:23] don't want to say I don't know for sure
[1:20:26] those that maybe take the mark of the
[1:20:27] beast or something like that now you can
[1:20:30] take this all the way down they they
[1:20:31] keep getting um they keep getting
[1:20:34] smaller and smaller but you can take it
[1:20:35] down now Moses he was definitely the
[1:20:37] highest quality I didn't have somebody
[1:20:39] there yet balum was lost the Bible said
[1:20:41] the midst of darkness is reserved
[1:20:43] forever for balum and then Barack he was
[1:20:45] he was a he was a moabit king he was a
[1:20:48] he was a heathen to begin begin with he
[1:20:49] said let's curse Israel now what kind of
[1:20:51] person would want to curse God's people
[1:20:53] somebody that's never been saved yes
[1:20:57] right cursing the one that God blessed
[1:20:59] so he was never saved to begin with you
[1:21:02] probably have a core in here right a
[1:21:04] Dayan core Dayan in there those that
[1:21:07] were lost and things like that it keeps
[1:21:09] going on and on and on okay now I got 10
[1:21:11] minutes okay so bear with me here I got

[1:21:19] we're focusing on that slide I already
[1:21:21] got so let me go back to that one it's
[1:21:24] the one I think back
[1:21:29] here uh just so you

[1:22:00] looking for that's what we want to look
[1:22:01] at we want to spend a little time just a
[1:22:03] few services on this because I looked up
[1:22:05] every time brother Bram said scarcely
[1:22:06] saved I want to see what brother Bram
[1:22:08] said about it and then preach that by
[1:22:10] the grace of the
[1:22:12] Lord because this will help us uh to
[1:22:15] understand what is the mindset of a wise

[1:22:44] say this for those being baptized
[1:22:45] tonight Lydia and AA brother braham's
[1:22:48] preaching he said God loves a sinner and
[1:22:50] everything that's on Earth will praise
[1:22:52] him someday even the Sinners will praise
[1:22:54] Him Som because every knee will bow see
[1:22:57] knee shows praise right shows honor
[1:23:00] someday you'll bow to his knee or your
[1:23:03] your knee to his feet you'll bow as a
[1:23:05] reconciled by his works of
[1:23:07] reconciliation as you accepting him as
[1:23:08] your propit and be Washed by the Water
[1:23:11] of the word and the Waters of separation
[1:23:13] and become altogether child living God
[1:23:16] you'll worship Him in peace outside of
[1:23:18] that is a fearful thing so brother says
[1:23:20] outside of this is a fear thing it's
[1:23:23] fearful to live outside of
[1:23:27] that he says now he quotes our scripture
[1:23:30] for if the righteous be scarcely saved
[1:23:33] where will the Sinner and ungodly
[1:23:35] appear and that might happen to you
[1:23:37] before you leave the door brother
[1:23:39] brandom says brother always bring it

[1:23:51] said might be in a coffin by the end of
[1:23:53] the week he said he would just bring it

[1:23:57] them to see where are you at with God
[1:23:58] don't take this service lightly examine
[1:24:01] your heart and life and see where you
[1:24:02] stand with God tonight
[1:24:05] amen he said will you be reconcile this
[1:24:09] afternoon by Believing on him and
[1:24:10] accepting him as your personal savior
[1:24:12] one hand again before how many hands

[1:24:18] him God he's doing an alter call he said
[1:24:20] God bless you little fellow that's good
[1:24:23] A little boy raised his hand he said I'm
[1:24:26] reading this for our little girls that
[1:24:29] want to be
[1:24:31] baptized you say he's too young brother
[1:24:34] ra says oh
[1:24:36] no he says oh no he isn't Jesus said
[1:24:40] suffer the little children to come unto
[1:24:43] me they say brother B that person is too
[1:24:46] young to come to you he said no Jesus
[1:24:47] said let the little children come yes
[1:24:49] sir honey boy you're welcome bless your
[1:24:52] little heart God save you may mommy take
[1:24:55] you to the church to be baptized and
[1:24:57] call upon the name of the Lord or as
[1:25:00] little Samuel you remember not much
[1:25:02] older than you that was called a prophet
[1:25:04] he heard the voice of the Lord the first
[1:25:07] open vision for a long time in
[1:25:10] Israel that thought came to me for
[1:25:13] tonight with this baptism that's going
[1:25:15] to happen then I'll close it just a few
[1:25:17] more
[1:25:18] things if you know the history of Samuel
[1:25:21] Samuel the his name actually means Asked
[1:25:24] of
[1:25:26] God why because Hannah asked for a child
[1:25:29] of God right so Samuel means Asked of
[1:25:33] God Samuel was asked of God he was uh
[1:25:36] Hannah asked God for a son and so God
[1:25:39] chose a son and gave it to Hannah you
[1:25:41] were asked of me you were asked of me so
[1:25:43] I'm giving you to your mother Hannah
[1:25:47] right and Samuel was weaned probably for
[1:25:50] three or four years in those days in
[1:25:52] other countries children nurse until
[1:25:54] they're three or four or five years old
[1:25:55] in some countries I don't know if you
[1:25:57] ever seen it it looks kind of strange
[1:25:58] but you have a 5-year-old a
[1:26:00] four-year-old nurse and a mom that that
[1:26:02] was common back in those
[1:26:04] days and so Samuel a four-year-old boy
[1:26:07] will say was taken to the house of God
[1:26:09] if you know the story the Bible said the
[1:26:12] word of God wasn't revealed to Samuel
[1:26:14] till one night one night he's sleeping
[1:26:17] and he heard Samuel Samuel and he went
[1:26:18] to Eli and said Eli did you call me no
[1:26:21] son go back to
[1:26:22] sleep goes back to sleep Samuel Samuel
[1:26:26] yes Eli I'm here he said no go back to
[1:26:28] sleep he does a third time and Eli
[1:26:31] perceives the Lord must be talking to
[1:26:34] him he's hearing voices out there and
[1:26:36] church I hope you can hear a voice
[1:26:38] tonight it don't have to be a loud one
[1:26:40] it's probably a still Small Voice
[1:26:43] amen if will just listen the Bible said
[1:26:46] it was because Samuel hadn't known the
[1:26:48] voice of the Lord yet God help us to
[1:26:50] hear the voice of God and know when God
[1:26:52] is speaking to
[1:26:54] us then you know the
[1:27:00] story but as Samuel grew Samuel was
[1:27:03] raised as a servant as a priest and
[1:27:05] Prophet unto God Samuel was a new
[1:27:07] generation of Believers in Acts 13 the
[1:27:10] Bible said that all the judges judge
[1:27:13] until
[1:27:14] Samuel and then God started raising up
[1:27:17] prophets Samuel was the first of a new
[1:27:20] generation why because a mother had a
[1:27:22] burden said I want a son and Lord if you
[1:27:25] give me a son I'll give him back to you
[1:27:28] oh I see all the desires of all of our
[1:27:29] hearts Lord let our children do
[1:27:32] something new praise God I when I give
[1:27:34] it back to you Lord use this child from
[1:27:37] the young age amen don't let them walk
[1:27:39] out there but I will take them Glory I
[1:27:42] will take my children to the house of
[1:27:44] God that they'll learn to serve you from
[1:27:46] a young age amen hallelujah praise
[1:27:50] God and I'll give the child back to you
[1:27:53] because I the child was asked of you I
[1:27:56] asked you for this
[1:27:58] child and Samuel was such a godly man
[1:28:02] that when Israel wented a king and
[1:28:03] rejected God God had to remind Samuel he
[1:28:07] said Samuel don't feel bad they haven't
[1:28:09] rejected you they rejected me Samuel
[1:28:14] took it so personally why because his
[1:28:16] heart was knit to God's heart when they
[1:28:18] said we don't want a prophet anymore
[1:28:21] Samuel personally and God had to say
[1:28:23] well listen that's just because our
[1:28:24] hearts are so nit close together don't
[1:28:27] take it personal Samuel they didn't
[1:28:28] reject you it's because they don't love
[1:28:31] me but this child's this this boy this
[1:28:34] man's heart from a child was so
[1:28:36] dedicated to God his heart was knit
[1:28:38] around God that even felt rejection when
[1:28:40] God was rejected help me to have that
[1:28:42] kind of Heart church amen help my
[1:28:44] children have that kind of a heart that
[1:28:46] when the word is rejected they feel
[1:28:48] rejected because they're so in love with
[1:28:51] that word am man oh my that's how Samuel
[1:28:56] was his heart was so knit to God church
[1:29:00] he was so close to God from serving God
[1:29:02] at a young
[1:29:04] age that the Bible said he judged all of
[1:29:07] Israel on a circuit how many know what a
[1:29:09] circuit is electrical circuit you have
[1:29:11] wires connecting from point A to point B
[1:29:13] to point C right and they've all got to
[1:29:15] be connected in order for electricity to
[1:29:16] flow through there that's what Samuel
[1:29:19] Samuel was he was electrical circuit he
[1:29:22] was a circuit of fire amen and he go on
[1:29:24] a circuit traveling all around Israel
[1:29:26] teaching them judging them prophesying
[1:29:29] them the Bible said he was so close to
[1:29:31] God the men of Israel would tremble when
[1:29:34] he would come to bring a
[1:29:35] word the Bible said are you come to
[1:29:37] bring Jud judgment or you come in peace
[1:29:40] B they would tremble a man of God like
[1:29:43] that all because he was given to God
[1:29:46] dedicated to God at a young age
[1:29:49] amen and took him into the house of God
[1:29:51] God at a young age my mother drugged all
[1:29:55] four of us uh I'll say like this my mom
[1:29:59] drugged me when I was younger she
[1:30:00] drugged me to church three times a
[1:30:03] week somebody told me that I thought
[1:30:05] that was pretty funny drugged me to
[1:30:07] church she drugged me when I was younger
[1:30:09] drugged me to church three services
[1:30:12] every week and all six of us my dad
[1:30:14] would stay at home he didn't want to
[1:30:15] serve God in the public like that he
[1:30:17] didn't believe in denominations which
[1:30:18] was good in some sense but bad because
[1:30:20] he wasn't serving God the way but she
[1:30:23] drugs six kids every Wednesday night and
[1:30:25] twice on Sunday back to the house of God
[1:30:28] and she's got three preachers out of
[1:30:30] those six amen amen and one daughter of
[1:30:33] course she can't preach but she's in the
[1:30:34] message and so forth and all of them go
[1:30:37] to church every
[1:30:38] Sunday it's just like Hannah Hannah said
[1:30:40] if you give me children I'll take them
[1:30:42] back to you I'll take them back to your
[1:30:44] house they will dwell at the house of
[1:30:46] God amen amen that's the thing to do
[1:30:49] keep your children in the presence of
[1:30:51] God Amen
[1:30:53] and if you train them up in that way
[1:30:54] they they'll not depart from it when
[1:30:55] they're older
[1:30:59] beautiful he was such a servant that he
[1:31:02] dedicated his life to traveling teaching
[1:31:04] in a circuit preaching the gospel uh
[1:31:06] judging Israel and the Bible also said
[1:31:09] I'll close to this the Bible also said
[1:31:11] God let none of the words of his mouth
[1:31:14] fall to the
[1:31:15] ground
[1:31:17] amen all because a mother wanted a child
[1:31:20] and she said if you give me a son I will
[1:31:22] dedicate him back to you yes and God so
[1:31:25] honored that four-year-old from all the
[1:31:27] way up God never let one of those words
[1:31:30] fall to the
[1:31:31] ground let's stand to our feet
[1:31:35] here now if you got your Bible go to
[1:31:37] back to revelation 22 I'm going to close
[1:31:39] with that
[1:31:42] again when someone either obeys or
[1:31:45] disobeys the word of God like we said
[1:31:46] like uh either denying the water baptism
[1:31:50] or denying the message or denying the
[1:31:52] Revelations or they they live worldly
[1:31:55] and dress sexy or or smoke and drink and
[1:31:58] cuss and enjoy dirty movies and
[1:31:59] everything like that their very Works
[1:32:01] prove which one of these they are their
[1:32:03] very life proves which one they are how
[1:32:06] many believe that revelation 22 verse 11
[1:32:09] let me go back to
[1:32:13] there remember you're not saved by works
[1:32:15] but works the right Works show you are
[1:32:19] saved and with all your heart make your
[1:32:22] calling and election sure let everybody
[1:32:24] know which side you're
[1:32:26] on because we don't want to be scarcely
[1:32:28] saved or scarcely lost we want to be
[1:32:29] truly saved we want to be sealed by the
[1:32:32] Holy Ghost amen verse 11 he that is
[1:32:37] unjust let him be unjust still he which
[1:32:38] is filthy let him be filthy still he
[1:32:40] that's righteous let him be righteous
[1:32:42] still there's the foolish virgin and he
[1:32:43] that's holy let him be holy still now
[1:32:45] here's Jesus and behold I come quickly
[1:32:48] and my reward is with me to give every
[1:32:50] man according as work shall be so
[1:32:53] whatever fruits they produce that you
[1:32:54] get a reward for that praise God works
[1:32:58] are important right you get a reward for
[1:32:59] your works but they don't make you saved
[1:33:02] you already are saved verse 13 I am
[1:33:05] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:33:08] end the first and the last blessed are
[1:33:10] they that do his Commandments that they
[1:33:13] may have right to the tree of life and
[1:33:14] may enter in through the gates of the
[1:33:16] city for without our dogs now that means
[1:33:18] homosexual dogs Sorcerers hor mongers
[1:33:22] and murderers and AD doters and whoever
[1:33:24] loveth and maketh a lie I jesus sent my
[1:33:27] angel to testify unto you these things
[1:33:29] in the churches I'm the root and
[1:33:31] offspring of David and the Bright
[1:33:33] Morning Star and the spirit and the
[1:33:35] bride say come tonight we're asking
[1:33:38] everybody come to the baptism of the
[1:33:40] Holy Ghost come to Jesus sell out all to
[1:33:42] Christ amen don't let your Works be just
[1:33:45] righteous let's make them holy praise
[1:33:47] God amen amen let him that Hearth say
[1:33:50] come and him that is a thirst come and
[1:33:53] whosoever will let him take of the Water
[1:33:56] of Life freely let's bow our heads
[1:34:01] here now as you bow your heads I'm going
[1:34:03] to read this from Brother BR
[1:34:10] said in this is in the Sixth Seal
[1:34:12] brother said and Jesus knows when that
[1:34:14] last believer comes in then his
[1:34:17] intercessing days is over he comes forth
[1:34:19] and to claim what he's interceded for
[1:34:21] for he's doing the kinsman redeemer work
[1:34:23] now and comes forth to receive his own
[1:34:26] he said oh my that ought to set every
[1:34:29] Chris to searching himself and holding
[1:34:31] his hands before God and saying cleanse
[1:34:35] me oh Lord look into my life and let me
[1:34:38] see where my bad part is let me get it
[1:34:40] out of the way right quick see for if
[1:34:43] the righteous be scarcely saved where
[1:34:45] will the Sinner and ungodly appear it's
[1:34:48] checking up time
[1:34:50] amen so with all heads bowed how many
[1:34:54] would hold your hearts up to God and say
[1:34:56] cleanse me Lord look into my life and
[1:34:59] make sure every part is Right In Me Amen
[1:35:03] brother man said the very fact that
[1:35:05] Jesus here is going to stop saving one
[1:35:08] day and if you're holy still you'll be
[1:35:10] holy you'll have a pause if you're
[1:35:13] righteous you'll still be
[1:35:15] righteous you can't go any higher with
[1:35:18] God oh my church may God cleanse us here
[1:35:22] tonight cleanse our hearts Lord God lord
[1:35:25] you knew I I preach a shorter message
[1:35:27] Lord trying to get this baptismal done
