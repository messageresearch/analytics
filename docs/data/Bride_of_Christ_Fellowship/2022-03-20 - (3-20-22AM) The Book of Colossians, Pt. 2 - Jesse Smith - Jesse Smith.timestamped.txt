[33:56] here in this divine presence in jesus
[33:58] christ's name and the saint said
[34:00] amen god bless you as you're being
[34:01] seated praise god
[34:08] glory
[34:11] okay
[34:13] so i have uh some some slides we want to
[34:16] show to show the notes here looking at
[34:17] colossians part
[34:19] 2 book of colossians part 2.
[34:22] like i said it'll kind of relate you
[34:23] know to the outreach and things as we we
[34:26] believe in doing outreach and i got my
[34:27] date wrong i was going to preach this
[34:28] march 6. i forgot to change that
[34:31] that was quite a while ago
[34:34] but then i just felt kind of compelled
[34:36] to go on the doctrine of devils series
[34:38] and we may get back to that lord willing
[34:40] it's a 20th
[34:42] okay so
[34:44] i hope that was a help last week you
[34:46] know as we looked at rapturing faith how
[34:48] many believe rapturing faiths in heaven
[34:49] praise god it's going to come down into
[34:51] you now there's another aspect of it
[34:52] where the ability to receive it is
[34:55] already in you it's part of the seed
[34:56] it's part of the calling of god god's
[34:59] purpose for your life praise god brother
[35:00] ram said like a seed like a like an
[35:02] acorn seed everything it has need of is
[35:04] already inside of it right everything
[35:06] it's going to be is already inside of it
[35:08] so if we're going to live and be a part
[35:10] of the rapture if we're going to miss
[35:11] death it's already inside of us praise
[35:12] god it's god's purpose for our lives and
[35:15] so we just got to water the seed right
[35:17] we got to water it the bible says it's
[35:18] got to be planted watered but god gives
[35:20] the increase amen god's going to direct
[35:23] our lives you know as he has been for a
[35:24] wonderful way now i just want to briefly
[35:27] i guess i'll go really quick through
[35:28] this uh try to keep it about an hour
[35:30] because i i kind of need to study in
[35:32] between services for that second service
[35:33] in case somebody comes you know
[35:35] uh i didn't get all the notes done
[35:38] that i like to i'll just give you a just
[35:40] real brief preview i kind of uh
[35:44] i kind of got this i just kind of put
[35:45] our picture on there
[35:47] um just defining what an expo is an expo
[35:50] is a verbal uh explanation of the
[35:53] message and so i have some scriptures on
[35:55] here you know daniel
[35:56] and how we're in the end times and
[35:59] uh
[36:00] you know the mysteries are actually
[36:02] there in plain sight you know they're
[36:03] actually laying right in the bible so
[36:05] uh and then i go through the 12 new
[36:06] testament mysteries
[36:08] uh and then i get into brother brahms
[36:10] you know ministry
[36:14] just the every every part of his
[36:15] ministry that was so powerful this is
[36:17] why we know he was a true servant of god
[36:18] right
[36:20] but i want to add some more of those
[36:21] testimonies i want to add some video
[36:23] testimonies in here in case we get
[36:24] visitors
[36:25] and then just how we enjoy the
[36:27] fellowship of the mystery the bible says
[36:28] we enjoy the intimacy of the mystery so
[36:31] we see that in our daily lives right we
[36:33] see god doing miracles answering our
[36:34] prayers
[36:36] we see the love of god in our family we
[36:38] see the love of god in our local church
[36:39] so i'd like to spend a little more time
[36:41] on that so
[36:43] i know everybody loves me here and so
[36:45] you'll be patient with me
[36:48] i just you know as i said i feel a
[36:49] burden to
[36:50] you know
[36:51] reach out to akron i have some quotes on
[36:53] that as well by god's grace so
[36:55] so just reviewing remember real quick
[36:57] the reason i feel compelled the holy
[36:59] spirit to go over the book of colossians
[37:01] because
[37:02] brother brahms vision
[37:04] he was asked if he'd be judged and he
[37:07] said he asked what about paul will paul
[37:10] be judged as a leader and he said yes
[37:12] and he said well i preached the same
[37:14] word
[37:15] so in other in other words the the
[37:17] epistles of paul are what we must know
[37:20] and understand now church you'd be
[37:21] surprised a lot of people don't even
[37:23] know what the bible says yet they're in
[37:25] the yet they're in the message
[37:28] right
[37:29] so we know there's a balance you have to
[37:30] uh you have to read the bible you also
[37:32] have to listen to brother branham but
[37:34] you also have to pray
[37:36] amen you have to do at least those three
[37:37] things praise god and if you're
[37:39] imbalanced in one of them then your life
[37:41] is going to show it praise god
[37:43] because that's why god sent the voice of
[37:45] the the seventh angel right he sent a
[37:47] messenger we need to hear the voice but
[37:49] we must also read the bible and we must
[37:51] also pray hallelujah
[37:53] and so
[37:54] millions were resting on that millions
[37:56] were resting that brother branham
[37:58] preached what paul preached praise god
[38:00] because we're all going to be judged by
[38:01] what paul preached each and every person
[38:04] because
[38:05] paul's revelation from jesus christ
[38:08] is the judgment standard anyone that
[38:10] adds to it anyone that takes away is
[38:12] cursed according to paul
[38:15] uh okay now we're gonna and then this
[38:17] this quote just meant a lot to me from
[38:19] souls that are in prison now
[38:21] but uh thus saith the lord he said
[38:23] malachi the fourth chapter has to come
[38:26] someone's gonna rise up and fulfill that
[38:27] praise god
[38:29] and he said what is it gonna do what is
[38:30] turning of the hearts it's turning our
[38:32] hearts back to the doctrine of the
[38:33] fathers right the commandments of the
[38:35] fathers back to the bible
[38:39] praise god and so he says out of
[38:40] denominational differences and come back
[38:43] to the bible back to god so church when
[38:45] you read your bible you're getting
[38:46] closer oops sorry you're getting closer
[38:47] to god amen and the church said
[38:50] amen praise god i want to hold on to
[38:52] that real thought real hard real solid
[38:53] today amen
[38:55] see when you so in other words when you
[38:57] read your bible when you're reading
[38:58] listen brother branham praying you're
[39:00] drawing closer to god amen you have that
[39:03] remember brother man said you want to
[39:04] get close closer to god you want to grow
[39:06] in the love of god read your bible and
[39:08] pray amen hallelujah
[39:10] so it's a he said it's a great time what
[39:12] a great time we're living in how many
[39:13] you're thankful to live in this time
[39:15] amen
[39:17] now just real briefly the book is just
[39:18] divided up into four sections the
[39:20] greeting and thanksgiving lord willing
[39:22] we'll get through the first part today
[39:24] and then we'll start lord willing next
[39:25] time looking at the uh the godhead and
[39:27] i've already preached four sermons on
[39:28] that so this will tie kind of closely in
[39:30] with that i kind of stopped that series
[39:32] uh there's a couple more mysteries i
[39:34] need to preach
[39:35] i need to preach the seventh mystery and
[39:38] i never finished the first mystery of
[39:40] the godhead i think i preached through
[39:41] all of them if i'm not mistaken
[39:43] uh preached that to the saints here so
[39:45] um again remember colossae was that is
[39:48] that pile of dirt right there
[39:50] it's a pile of dirt it's 12 miles from
[39:52] laodicea 12 miles very far
[39:55] uh and it's it's it's unexcavated today
[39:59] uh so here that's the map of turkey so
[40:01] there's laodicea and colossi is 12 miles
[40:04] that way there's ephesus so paul of
[40:06] course you know
[40:07] spent a lot of his missionary work there
[40:09] in turkey
[40:10] and the thought that really blessed me
[40:12] was the fact that god sent
[40:14] colossi the message and they only had 10
[40:16] years to receive it they only only had
[40:19] 10 years to put it into practice but god
[40:21] thought so much of it that he still sent
[40:23] the message there praise god
[40:25] in other words wherever there is in
[40:27] other words wherever there is
[40:28] predestinated seed god's word is going
[40:29] to get there
[40:31] praise god
[40:32] uh you know there's a there's a few
[40:34] examples i'll share just come to my mind
[40:36] there was a brother um
[40:38] in brother brother brooks's ministry who
[40:40] was healed of aids
[40:42] he had aids they prayed for him he was
[40:44] healed but then he died of something
[40:45] else just a year after that
[40:48] and think about that you know god sent
[40:49] the message he got healed he got healed
[40:52] of aids but then he only had a year to
[40:54] live on this earth
[40:57] to me that's the mercy of god because
[40:59] god knew this was the best time for him
[41:00] to go and look god allowed him all those
[41:02] years to kind of maybe fight against the
[41:04] message but then he got the healing he
[41:06] got the revelation right before it was
[41:08] time for him to go praise god just
[41:10] beautiful just
[41:11] god is the one who knows god has a set
[41:13] time for us to be here a set time for us
[41:15] to go praise god
[41:16] now church you've got to be grateful
[41:18] some of you are rather vague we've
[41:19] already had two decades to serve god in
[41:21] this message amen sister beatrice had 40
[41:24] years
[41:25] in this message praise god 40 years
[41:27] where others may only get one year
[41:29] two years three years uh brother cam
[41:32] they had a death at their church a few
[41:33] months ago uh the brother just got
[41:35] baptized within that year
[41:37] within that year his brother
[41:39] uh brother craig's
[41:41] mother's second husband
[41:43] uh he was there the last time i preached
[41:45] at camps he was there he was in the back
[41:46] saying amen you know he had just been
[41:48] baptized maybe a year before
[41:51] and then he died
[41:52] and just think of that you know
[41:54] god all those years 60 years we'll say
[41:57] he was there he was there but then god
[41:59] had a certain time in a certain place
[42:00] for in other words he he didn't receive
[42:02] what brother craig his you know his what
[42:04] his his wife's son was preaching he
[42:06] didn't receive it all those years to
[42:08] that last year hey
[42:09] my goodness amen the church just hang on
[42:12] amen just hang on for your family
[42:13] members hang on for your friends amen
[42:16] just hang on
[42:17] god's got a a purpose in doing
[42:19] everything
[42:21] remember god is church god is striving
[42:23] with man
[42:25] god is wrestling hallelujah god is
[42:27] wrestling with our loved ones amen
[42:30] he's constantly knocking at their hearts
[42:32] door he's just have confidence in god
[42:34] amen just trust god amen
[42:37] god will bring it to pass hallelujah god
[42:38] will do god will save all those who want
[42:40] to be saved amen
[42:42] so they had less than less than a decade
[42:45] after receiving the letter
[42:48] to manifest christ or to continue to
[42:50] grow in christ
[42:51] now church this means they didn't even
[42:53] hear the book of revelation
[42:55] praise god they had the holy ghost as
[42:58] paul said they had christ in you the
[43:00] hope of glory and they but they didn't
[43:02] have the book of revelation
[43:04] praise god
[43:06] in other words god god ordains how much
[43:08] revelation you're going to receive
[43:10] god ordains how much you're going to
[43:12] hear how much you're going to receive so
[43:14] we ought to say thank you lord i've
[43:15] received all this and lord the bible
[43:17] says to whom much is given much is
[43:19] required amen
[43:20] so
[43:22] may god help us amen
[43:24] to meet the requirement that he has for
[43:26] us amen hallelujah
[43:29] too much that's why we do that's why we
[43:32] do the youtube ministry the podcast
[43:33] that's why we send the postcards much
[43:35] has been given to us amen so much will
[43:38] be required of us hallelujah
[43:40] amen
[43:41] now we looked at the city i'm not going
[43:43] to spend more time on that but remember
[43:45] uh
[43:46] colossae and uh laocia they never saw
[43:49] paul's face let's read that so just to
[43:51] see you got that colossians 2 verse 1.
[43:56] i'd like you to see that as well it's
[43:57] because we'll be
[43:58] referencing numerous scriptures
[44:04] colossians 2 verse 1. for i would that
[44:07] ye knew what great conflict i have for
[44:10] you
[44:12] praise god
[44:14] and for them at laodicea and for as many
[44:16] have have not seen my face
[44:19] in the flesh
[44:21] so paul had a great burden for the
[44:23] saints even though he never visited them
[44:25] even though he never saw them paul had a
[44:27] great burden for them how many got a
[44:28] burden for the message churches
[44:30] i do that's why we want to get the truth
[44:32] out there praise god
[44:33] that's why if other churches won't
[44:35] answer questions we want to answer the
[44:36] questions
[44:38] because there's there's people sitting
[44:40] in all kinds of churches that have
[44:41] questions
[44:42] and a lot of preachers are afraid to
[44:44] answer them
[44:45] i've heard numerous preachers say they
[44:46] don't have time to answer them that's
[44:49] you ought to make time to answer them
[44:50] praise god
[44:52] you ought to make time and let me just
[44:53] remind you that quote since i got it i
[44:55] think i got a quote down here i'd like
[44:56] to show about that
[44:58] we ought to make time
[45:02] remember this quote from who is this
[45:03] melchizedek
[45:05] now let's go down here talk about the
[45:07] godhead a baptist minor a few weeks ago
[45:09] came up to my house and said i'd like to
[45:11] straighten you out on the god
[45:12] god had some time when you got time well
[45:14] let's see did brother abraham have time
[45:16] to be corrected or not
[45:18] they come to his house now church today
[45:21] it's not so much come to your house it
[45:22] comes to your phone
[45:24] you got time i get them all the time
[45:27] you got time to be corrected
[45:29] and this guy come knocking on his door
[45:32] i'm starting no i'm sorry called me up
[45:33] rather called him up so yeah so now it
[45:35] is like the cell phone
[45:36] i said i got time right now
[45:39] amen
[45:41] because i want to be straight and we lay
[45:42] aside everything else to do it so see
[45:45] preachers or people that won't answer
[45:47] the question something's wrong because
[45:48] brother branham had time to answer and
[45:50] the bible says if we've got truth what
[45:52] are we afraid of
[45:54] we should have not we have nothing to be
[45:55] afraid of if we got the truth that we
[45:57] should be able to stand on it praise god
[45:59] like you heard that quote if i've got
[46:01] gold i'm not afraid to melt it down
[46:03] because i know it's only going to drive
[46:04] more dross out of it praise god
[46:07] it's only going to make it more solid
[46:08] hallelujah
[46:11] he says and in other words we lay aside
[46:14] everything else to do it
[46:16] do you remember this one from the fist
[46:17] seal this one come to my heart this
[46:18] morning brother brown's testimony about
[46:20] going beyond the curtain of time which
[46:21] we just referenced was put in a magazine
[46:25] and a minister wrote him and said
[46:26] brother branham your vision sounded
[46:27] really scriptural until you talked about
[46:30] a horse being there a horse in heaven
[46:33] he said heaven was made for being human
[46:35] beings not horses
[46:37] so brother ram took the time to write
[46:39] the brother back now
[46:43] writing a letter takes a lot more time
[46:44] how many can say amen to that
[46:46] you we can text and i can get back to
[46:48] you in 10 seconds
[46:49] now writing a letter put in the mail
[46:51] that's a different thing
[46:53] he said well i sat down so he had to
[46:54] personally set down
[46:56] to correct the brother
[46:59] see he didn't say i don't have time for
[47:00] these people
[47:01] he made time
[47:03] right because he has the love of god in
[47:04] his heart that's the thing if you have
[47:06] the love of god in your heart you want
[47:07] to answer questions
[47:09] now the bible says there's some foolish
[47:10] and unlearned question
[47:12] the holy ghost will direct us when
[47:13] there's foolish and unlearned and we can
[47:15] we can avoid those
[47:16] but when it's an honest question we
[47:18] should lay aside everything
[47:20] now not your children not feeding your
[47:22] children and taking care of your
[47:22] children now not laying aside your job
[47:24] you go to work
[47:25] but get to it after work brother bram
[47:27] didn't have a job right as far as a job
[47:29] outside the preaching
[47:31] so you can lay aside everything and do
[47:33] it
[47:34] so brother brandon said i wrote he said
[47:35] i put a letter right there and said my
[47:37] precious brother i'm surprised at your
[47:39] wisdom and not knowing the scripture
[47:41] i did not say i was in heaven i always
[47:43] said i was in a place like paradise
[47:45] because christ was still above
[47:48] see but i said if it might satisfy you
[47:50] turn over to revelation 19 when jesus
[47:53] comes out of the heavens of heaven he's
[47:55] riding a white horse and all the saints
[47:57] are with him riding on white hot white
[47:59] horses he said absolutely right he said
[48:02] and up in that place there's one that
[48:03] looked like an eagle ox he says why
[48:06] where's them horses that come god elijah
[48:07] amen
[48:09] he just goes to show you the human mind
[48:11] just wants something to pick on that's
[48:13] right
[48:14] so here's two examples a trinitarian and
[48:16] someone that's
[48:18] questioning brother branham's vision
[48:19] brother branham made time to correct
[48:21] them praise god
[48:23] see because if you've got the truth
[48:24] you're not afraid of questions
[48:26] do you remember i mean how many how many
[48:28] have listened to brother on the
[48:29] questions and answer sermons many times
[48:31] he says he says many times it's hard
[48:33] thing to take questions
[48:36] so like when we do our 3 p.m bible
[48:37] studies it's a hard thing it ain't
[48:39] always a easy thing
[48:40] because i don't have all the answers
[48:42] right only god does
[48:44] but i want to i that's why i like the
[48:46] youtube that i can train myself to take
[48:48] questions
[48:49] right the bible says be instant in
[48:52] season and out of season praise god how
[48:53] many how many know that by god's grace
[48:56] see it's training me to do that i wasn't
[48:58] at first able to do that but now by the
[49:00] holy spirit i consider i can take any
[49:01] question from anybody and i just want to
[49:03] be able to say if i don't know i don't
[49:05] know
[49:06] but if i know i want to tell you where
[49:08] it is in the bible
[49:10] so see these churches never saw paul's
[49:12] face but paul was still burdened for
[49:14] them
[49:18] and uh here epiphanous we'll get to him
[49:20] in a moment he's the one that
[49:21] established the church now let's go to
[49:23] colossians 4 12 though in 13 because of
[49:25] course we won't be preaching on that
[49:26] text here today
[49:28] lord willing in the future but let's
[49:29] read verses 12 and 13.
[49:32] of course paul is ending the letter here
[49:34] and he says in verse 12 4 verse 12
[49:36] epiphus who is one of you now look it
[49:39] looks like epiphany was from colossae
[49:42] that's what it looks like he's one of
[49:44] you
[49:45] a servant of christ
[49:47] saluteth you always laboring fervent for
[49:49] you in prayers and that ye may stand
[49:52] perfect and complete
[49:54] in all the will of god
[49:56] so again the greatest prayers you can
[49:58] pray for one another lord i pray for
[49:59] vang i pray for brother amen i pray for
[50:01] brother austin i pray for brother jose i
[50:02] pray for my brothers my prayer our
[50:04] prayers should be that you'll stand
[50:06] doing the perfect will of god amen amen
[50:09] like david did the will of god for his
[50:11] generation praise god
[50:13] he fulfilled all the will of god for his
[50:15] generation because church if you get
[50:17] outside the will of god you become like
[50:19] jonah you become like balaam
[50:22] praise god like lot you become like that
[50:25] when you get out of the perfect will of
[50:27] god lot should not have pitched his tent
[50:29] toward sodom
[50:31] because sodom led to the death of his
[50:33] wife
[50:34] and children and son-in-laws
[50:37] see so there was a better option for lot
[50:39] he chose the permissive will of god yeah
[50:41] they had to separate from abraham but he
[50:43] should not have chosen the worldly
[50:45] worldly approach amen and may god help
[50:47] us in all of our decisions not to choose
[50:49] anything worldly amen
[50:51] if we're going to decide on one side or
[50:53] another let's sign on separation and
[50:55] holiness amen
[50:57] we gotta have jobs you gotta do that but
[50:58] in other words if you have a choice
[50:59] between being around more worldly things
[51:01] or godly things then go take the way
[51:03] with the lord's despised view amen
[51:06] learn remember jesus remember god's wife
[51:09] amen
[51:10] remember that in other words remember
[51:12] those uh that were foolish virgin at one
[51:14] time but then fell away
[51:17] right
[51:18] remember that kind of life that gets
[51:21] connected to the world remember that and
[51:22] avoid that praise god like like james
[51:25] said stay unspotted from the world amen
[51:28] amen keep the world's dirty spots off
[51:31] you praise god
[51:33] i don't know did you see the dirty spot
[51:34] that fell on the uh uh or that came out
[51:37] of disney this week disney put out a
[51:39] movie last week did you see that well i
[51:40] got little first graders right so the
[51:41] kids come up and say i always i always
[51:43] ask them monday what's the best part of
[51:45] your weekend
[51:46] and they'll say like you know playing or
[51:48] uh you know but last last monday it was
[51:52] like oh we saw the disney movie i'm like
[51:54] oh okay did you like it some of them
[51:56] like yeah one of the guys uh one of the
[51:59] little boys his dad's a song in a church
[52:00] and he said we watch it my dad shut it
[52:02] off right away
[52:03] i was like oh
[52:05] well anyways i went online and of course
[52:07] i would never watch those movies but i
[52:08] listened to a preacher who did watch it
[52:10] now see
[52:11] he's not a message preacher
[52:13] but
[52:13] again
[52:14] but the movie was called turning red and
[52:17] it's about a young a young girl who
[52:18] enters into puberty
[52:20] and she starts going through her cycles
[52:21] and that's something disney's doing in
[52:23] the videos about that
[52:25] and in that
[52:27] uh i guess there's two cases in that in
[52:29] this
[52:30] children's cartoon
[52:31] just came out
[52:33] there's two there's two instances where
[52:34] she contacts her dead relatives
[52:36] with satanic with satanic uh seances
[52:41] and uh the whole point of the movie is
[52:43] to show as she enters into puberty and
[52:46] starts having changes in her body in her
[52:48] life she's allowed to sin and do
[52:49] whatever she wants she can be like an
[52:51] animal
[52:51] because that's her that's she's being
[52:53] she has her own truth
[52:55] and they talk in the this in this kids
[52:56] video they talk about strippers she
[52:58] becomes
[52:59] thinks about becoming a stripper
[53:01] this is disney
[53:03] right
[53:04] now church all you gotta fast forward is
[53:05] 20 years remember when they put out i
[53:07] watched the lad and you know 30 years
[53:08] ago whatever they that jasmine's half
[53:10] naked in there now they might not have
[53:12] said stripper but she was basically
[53:13] stripped
[53:15] remember ariel and the little mermaid
[53:16] she's basically stripper that's
[53:18] basically what she is
[53:20] right so none of them are good amen
[53:22] none of those are good
[53:24] and you'd be surprised how many message
[53:25] people there's a brother in canada he
[53:27] let me know he and i were sending
[53:28] messages he's a canadian preacher he
[53:30] said you'd be surprised how many message
[53:32] people what let their kids watch disney
[53:34] because brother ram used walt disney as
[53:36] one of his illustrations
[53:38] it's called the key to the door
[53:40] he said he said walt disney now brother
[53:42] man wasn't saying disney was okay he's
[53:44] just using him he said he was he was he
[53:47] was so poor in his garage remember he
[53:48] saw that little mouse he thought i'll
[53:50] make a cartoon about a mouse and that's
[53:51] where i got mickey mouse from
[53:53] brother i was just showing how different
[53:54] inspiration comes to people he wasn't
[53:56] saying disney's good
[53:58] but message people some of them are so
[54:00] carnal they'll take that quote and
[54:02] they'll say it's okay for us to watch
[54:03] disney and church they'll set their kids
[54:05] in front of that walk away and look what
[54:07] they're getting fed
[54:09] they're getting programmed by satan amen
[54:11] but you and i on a if we're going to put
[54:13] put our kids in front of something it
[54:15] ought to be the word of god amen
[54:17] i mean they're going to grow up they're
[54:18] going to have tablets they're going to
[54:19] have phones all these things but if you
[54:20] give them something give them the word
[54:22] of god only praise god
[54:24] because look look look look where it's
[54:26] at right now praise god
[54:28] so in other words it's okay to be a
[54:29] beast is what they're saying it's okay
[54:31] to be beastly which the bible says
[54:33] without the holy ghost the bible says
[54:34] they're natural brute beasts amen
[54:40] and this is the world right and this is
[54:41] what people love this is what uh so i
[54:43] thought thank for that little boy his
[54:44] dad's a song leader i said well he's got
[54:46] some good discernment there
[54:48] but i'll tell you
[54:49] he's actually lacking a little bit to
[54:51] even trust disney to come into his home
[54:54] like you got the disney app you better
[54:55] delete it off your phone
[54:57] praise god
[54:58] now i wouldn't expect our church to have
[55:00] that but if you do delete it amen
[55:02] it's only going to
[55:04] steer you towards hell because that's
[55:06] what that's what comes out of it
[55:09] now uh
[55:10] more on the background there
[55:12] they had many uh many nationalities
[55:15] praise god in the church of colossae
[55:18] at least uh uh at least three or four
[55:20] there
[55:22] and then uh eprefus's job was to inform
[55:25] paul of their faith now i forgot to put
[55:27] that in there he was also saying what
[55:29] great faith they have but then also
[55:30] talking about some of the heresies that
[55:32] it entered into the church and so the
[55:34] letter was to encourage them but also to
[55:36] correct them
[55:38] now remember i closed remember i closed
[55:40] with these
[55:41] you know and we were closing there and
[55:43] and imagine if you were praying for a
[55:45] people what five things would you pray
[55:47] for
[55:49] you'd pray for brother jesse you pray
[55:51] for me right let brother jesse have be
[55:54] filled with the knowledge of god's will
[55:57] to know what god wants done
[56:00] to have all wisdom and spiritual
[56:02] understanding
[56:03] right that's what i pray for you too
[56:06] may brother vang walk worthy
[56:08] unto all pleasing
[56:10] may our brothers here be fruitful in
[56:13] every good work do you know that church
[56:15] every work that you do there's going to
[56:16] be fruit to it
[56:19] whether if you help the poor
[56:21] whether you uh give somebody money or
[56:23] lend somebody money hopefully give it
[56:24] away try out the land jesus said try not
[56:26] to he said give it away and don't don't
[56:28] don't ask for a bag don't don't hope you
[56:29] get it back
[56:31] in everything you do for others there's
[56:33] going to be fruit that comes out of it
[56:35] praise god
[56:37] amen and then we want to see we want to
[56:39] see good fruit not corrupt fruit praise
[56:41] god
[56:43] our prayers should be help our sisters
[56:45] to increase in the knowledge of god
[56:48] help them to know more about god
[56:51] help our church to be strengthened with
[56:53] god's might that's that's what we
[56:56] what we should pray for the bible says
[56:59] the paul says this is what i'm going to
[57:01] pray unceasing
[57:04] how many need more strength throughout
[57:05] the week
[57:08] my hands up too i need more strength
[57:10] i'll tell you about this week by friday
[57:11] i was about ready to pass out
[57:13] i was so tired all the work in late
[57:15] summer we had late service on wednesday
[57:17] good service but my boy
[57:19] tired and when i woke up at 4 20 on one
[57:21] of the mornings couldn't go back to bed
[57:23] well i'm just going to go through the
[57:24] day with only four hours of sleep or
[57:26] five hours of sleep you know just can't
[57:27] go to sleep i don't know what why not
[57:31] you know
[57:32] but praying for you to have all might of
[57:35] god's strength
[57:37] according to his power
[57:39] so that euger so that you have all
[57:41] patience
[57:43] all the patience you need for your
[57:44] spiritual journey that's what paul
[57:46] prayed for amen hallelujah and also that
[57:50] you'll have all the long suffering you
[57:52] need praise god
[57:54] and all joyfulness
[57:57] you'll suffer a long time with joy
[58:00] oh man my goodness that's real
[58:02] christianity praise god amen
[58:08] that's what we ended with
[58:10] uh last time now if you've got your
[58:12] bibles colossians one let's read verses
[58:14] five and six i'm going to read that
[58:15] again
[58:17] i want to make some thoughts or some
[58:19] statements on this
[58:21] for the hope which is laid up
[58:23] so they heard of the hope which is laid
[58:25] up for you for the colossians in heaven
[58:28] where's your hope at church it's in
[58:29] heaven
[58:30] praise god
[58:32] we'll get to that in a moment
[58:33] your hope is in heaven
[58:35] where have ye heard before in the word
[58:37] of the truth of the gospel so the gospel
[58:39] the good news told them that their hope
[58:42] is in heaven
[58:43] hallelujah
[58:45] verse 6
[58:46] which has come unto you the gospels come
[58:49] unto you as it is in all the world
[58:52] and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also
[58:55] in you since the day that you heard it
[58:57] amen and knew the grace of god and truth
[58:59] hallelujah
[59:01] so church let me say like this since the
[59:02] very day you heard the gospel of jesus
[59:04] christ it is producing
[59:07] wonderful fruit in your life praise god
[59:09] amen
[59:11] the very day that you heard it amen
[59:13] the gospel has such an impact on you
[59:16] praise god
[59:17] the bible is supposed to have such a uh
[59:19] overwhelming influence on you hallelujah
[59:21] you should be so influenced that the
[59:23] very day you heard it it should impact
[59:25] you and people should be affected by the
[59:27] love of god in your heart praise god
[59:30] amen
[59:33] from the first day
[59:35] see so when you have faith when you
[59:36] receive the anointing of faith on the
[59:38] statue of man
[59:39] from that moment it's instantly
[59:41] producing fruit in your life
[59:44] now we're going to talk about fruit with
[59:45] the four kinds of grounds in just a
[59:46] moment here because there's different
[59:48] kinds of fruit there's fruit before
[59:49] you're born again and there's fruit
[59:51] after you're born again and the church
[59:52] said
[59:53] don't be afraid to say amen because i
[59:54] got a scripture for it
[59:57] john the baptist said bring forth fruits
[59:59] worthy of what
[1:00:01] repentance you're first so the very
[1:00:02] first thing you do repent there's fruit
[1:00:04] to that amen
[1:00:07] in other words church there's fruit all
[1:00:08] the way from justification to
[1:00:10] sanctification but then there's a
[1:00:11] special kind of fruit that's a fruit
[1:00:13] when you're born again of the holy
[1:00:15] spirit praise god
[1:00:16] amen
[1:00:18] that's why church we can say there are
[1:00:20] some fruits the wise virgin i'm sorry
[1:00:22] the foolish version will have
[1:00:24] but it won't be the full
[1:00:26] fruit of the spirit like the wise virgin
[1:00:28] has
[1:00:29] all right that's a little deeper concept
[1:00:31] that's a little deeper that's what our
[1:00:32] next podcast is about too so we try to
[1:00:34] go pretty deep on that one amen i'm
[1:00:36] still working on i'm about halfway
[1:00:37] through editing it it takes me a little
[1:00:38] which one hour one hour at a time praise
[1:00:40] god
[1:00:43] now church your hope your hope is laid
[1:00:46] up
[1:00:47] it's reserved for us
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:52] so your hope has a location praise god
[1:00:56] your hope is has a special place for it
[1:00:58] praise god
[1:01:01] and the bible said it's behind the
[1:01:02] heavenly veil
[1:01:05] jesus is our hope amen your hope is not
[1:01:08] just like a package sitting in heaven
[1:01:10] your hope is a living breathing eternal
[1:01:13] person jesus christ amen hallelujah your
[1:01:16] hope is alive amen amen
[1:01:21] the bible says in hebrews 6 which hope
[1:01:23] we have
[1:01:24] as an anchor of the soul
[1:01:28] both sure and steadfast
[1:01:31] which enter if into that within the veil
[1:01:35] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[1:01:38] even jesus made a high priest forever
[1:01:41] after the order of melchizedek
[1:01:44] glory
[1:01:46] see church when when uh when the storms
[1:01:49] of life come the bible says it's an
[1:01:51] anchor for the soul so think of a ship
[1:01:53] letting down an anchor
[1:01:55] the storms of life are going to come we
[1:01:57] ended last sunday with it right probably
[1:01:59] said a hundred foot tall wave right
[1:02:02] he said but thank god that jesus has a
[1:02:04] string attached to our boat amen and
[1:02:07] he's going to pull us through every wave
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:10] when the nation when there's he said
[1:02:11] there's distress of nations and
[1:02:12] earthquakes and and all the end times
[1:02:14] pestilences all these things he said
[1:02:16] jesus christ has a hold of that rope
[1:02:18] amen that string and he's going to pull
[1:02:20] us through and he said we will crest
[1:02:22] every wave praise god
[1:02:24] the waves are going to hit us amen have
[1:02:26] you been hit by any waves this week
[1:02:28] but if you haven't there's going to come
[1:02:29] some waves amen
[1:02:32] and your anchor for your soul the bible
[1:02:34] says is one place it's in heaven praise
[1:02:37] god
[1:02:38] my what a word for the people that are
[1:02:39] going to have an earthquake in 10 years
[1:02:42] and their whole town is going to be
[1:02:44] destroyed amen
[1:02:46] imagine the whole city being uh uh
[1:02:48] destroyed
[1:02:49] think about where you work think about
[1:02:51] your whole factory destroyed
[1:02:53] you come there and it's all in ruins
[1:02:56] but paul told them you have an anchor
[1:02:58] for your soul praise god amen
[1:03:00] when the storms of life come when trials
[1:03:02] come your your soul has an anchor your
[1:03:05] soul can grab a hold like an anchor
[1:03:07] grabs on a rock your soul grabs on jesus
[1:03:09] christ who is the rock amen
[1:03:14] and your hope is in heaven praise god
[1:03:17] you're anchored there
[1:03:19] so believers who hear the word it
[1:03:21] affects the very day they start
[1:03:22] believing and then they have an anchor
[1:03:24] that will keep them in the storms and
[1:03:26] the anchor is located in heaven and the
[1:03:29] anchor's a person the person of christ
[1:03:34] paul said jesus is your hope church
[1:03:37] first timothy 1 verse chapter 1 verse 1
[1:03:39] lord willing if the lord terrorists will
[1:03:41] preach on that book one day
[1:03:43] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[1:03:45] commandment of god our savior
[1:03:48] and the lord jesus christ which is our
[1:03:51] hope
[1:03:53] now church what does hope mean you ever
[1:03:55] think about that what does the hope mean
[1:03:57] it's an anticipation it's pleasurable
[1:04:00] anticipation
[1:04:03] right so we we we we're hoping for like
[1:04:05] the next steak dinner right like we we
[1:04:06] we know what hope i hope we can go there
[1:04:08] or i hope i can go get some fuzz
[1:04:10] sometime you know we have that hope
[1:04:12] right like that's a natural hope
[1:04:14] well i hope i can sleep in
[1:04:16] i hope i can get some rest
[1:04:18] like you're it's something you oh i
[1:04:20] anticipate that i hope somebody comes to
[1:04:22] the service tonight
[1:04:24] right you know we have all these
[1:04:26] anticipations
[1:04:27] oh it's going to be great anything you
[1:04:29] anticipate and look forward to with
[1:04:31] pleasure is your hope amen
[1:04:34] and so in the midst of trials we have to
[1:04:36] understand there's a pleasure to the
[1:04:38] coming of christ amen hallelujah
[1:04:41] we're anticipating the coming of jesus
[1:04:43] with pleasure praise god that's what
[1:04:45] hope is and jesus is our hope amen
[1:04:49] it's confidence in him as the the greek
[1:04:51] says it's expecting him it's expecting
[1:04:54] that he'll come with pleasure praise god
[1:04:58] amen
[1:05:00] this is what the colossians had and they
[1:05:03] were only going to have it for 10 more
[1:05:04] years whether they left or whether they
[1:05:06] died in that earthquake
[1:05:08] i don't know the history i haven't
[1:05:09] studied that far in it to look and
[1:05:10] actually see the history on it
[1:05:13] now get your bibles let's i'm gonna ask
[1:05:14] some readers out here some adult readers
[1:05:16] so but austin can you get ready uh maybe
[1:05:18] brother amen or sister who or whoever
[1:05:20] could read there but lydia you got a you
[1:05:21] got a bible hunt malcolm you got a bible
[1:05:23] all right i need some readers here
[1:05:26] now notice in verse 6 church they
[1:05:27] receive the grace of god and truth now
[1:05:29] this is going to go along to help austin
[1:05:31] alina who are new to the word
[1:05:35] that god uh grace is a gift from god but
[1:05:38] it's either accepted or rejected
[1:05:41] now let's show them one two three four
[1:05:44] now you only need two or three witnesses
[1:05:45] in the mouth of two i'm going to give
[1:05:46] you four
[1:05:48] there's at least four witnesses that
[1:05:50] grace can be rejected
[1:05:53] right grace can be forfeited
[1:05:56] and so i want them to see that by god's
[1:05:58] grace like god's grace amen
[1:06:00] so lydia can you get hebrews 12 15 uh by
[1:06:03] the a brother i'm sorry yeah brother
[1:06:05] amen can you get uh jude 1 4 and then
[1:06:07] but austin can you get galatians 2 20
[1:06:09] and malachi uh second corinthians 6 1.
[1:06:13] so now see that's
[1:06:15] that's a great difference
[1:06:16] this is this is what separates us from
[1:06:18] many churches we understand grace
[1:06:20] correctly
[1:06:22] churches
[1:06:24] many churches uh pervert grace they say
[1:06:27] you have grace no matter what that's not
[1:06:29] true
[1:06:31] you only have grace no matter what if
[1:06:32] you're predestinated and god's the only
[1:06:34] one that knows that praise god
[1:06:36] hallelujah
[1:06:38] but just receiving the word you can hear
[1:06:40] it one time or hear it one time and like
[1:06:42] it for at least in the case of judas's
[1:06:44] spirit you can like it for three years
[1:06:46] but then turn it down
[1:06:49] see and now we've seen around the
[1:06:51] message they can hang around for 30 or
[1:06:53] 40 years brother bang and then walk away
[1:06:55] and i say i don't believe it he wasn't a
[1:06:56] messenger i don't even know if i was
[1:06:58] baptized the right way we've seen it
[1:06:59] with people we've met
[1:07:02] they don't even know
[1:07:04] is this right anymore
[1:07:06] they've been so deceived by the enemy
[1:07:09] they don't even know a revelation
[1:07:10] because it never was a revelation to
[1:07:11] them amen they never got the revelation
[1:07:14] of the word it just it was just
[1:07:15] intellectualism
[1:07:16] but it wasn't revelation unveiling amen
[1:07:19] in other words that was always a mystery
[1:07:21] to them water baptism is still a mystery
[1:07:23] to them because it never was unveiled to
[1:07:25] them praise god
[1:07:29] okay so uh lydia uh hebrews 12 15 says
[1:07:34] god's gift of grace can be failed go
[1:07:36] ahead lydia
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:47] so
[1:07:48] this i think was speaking of not
[1:07:50] mistaken was esau
[1:07:52] he failed grace in other words god's
[1:07:54] grace came to him but he failed it and
[1:07:56] instead of letting grace control his
[1:07:57] life he let roots of bitterness control
[1:08:00] his life
[1:08:01] let's get to that we'll get to the
[1:08:02] grounds the four kinds of grounds we'll
[1:08:03] get to that in a moment
[1:08:05] so you can fail the grace of god
[1:08:09] hallelujah
[1:08:10] uh next uh i think amen can you do jude
[1:08:13] 1 verse 4
[1:08:14] for there
[1:08:16] unawares who were before old ordained to
[1:08:19] this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:08:22] the grace of our god into
[1:08:24] lasciviousness and denying the only lord
[1:08:27] god and our lord jesus christ amen
[1:08:29] wonderful
[1:08:30] now notice they were still preaching
[1:08:32] grace but they turned grace into
[1:08:34] lawlessness and the bible said they
[1:08:37] denied the lord when they did that now
[1:08:39] no doubt church they kept preaching the
[1:08:40] lord jesus they they kept preaching that
[1:08:42] but when they changed grace into
[1:08:44] lawlessness they denied the lord amen
[1:08:46] but yet with their words
[1:08:48] with their words they never say that but
[1:08:50] with their doctrine they said it and
[1:08:51] that's what jude says that's where they
[1:08:53] denied the faith that's where they
[1:08:55] denied the lord in their teaching praise
[1:08:57] god
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:00] uh
[1:09:00] austin galatians 2 20
[1:09:05] i please crucified with christ
[1:09:07] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[1:09:10] liveth in me and the life which i now
[1:09:12] live in the flesh i live by the faith of
[1:09:14] the son of god who loved me
[1:09:18] okay i wrote down the wrong scripture
[1:09:19] then
[1:09:21] it says i will not frustrate the grace
[1:09:23] of god in galatians
[1:09:27] anybody see it
[1:09:29] 21 i was one verse off thank you sister
[1:09:32] well she's helped me twice there so
[1:09:33] she's she's really on it right here
[1:09:36] she must be reading the bible out
[1:09:37] brother okay read 21 brother i do not
[1:09:39] frustrate the grace of god
[1:09:42] yes
[1:09:45] amen thank you brother let me fix that
[1:09:46] in case i ever reference this again
[1:09:50] thank you
[1:09:53] all right so god's gift can be rejected
[1:09:56] in this case they were saying you've got
[1:09:58] to be circumcised to be saved
[1:10:01] brother brother austin the uh another
[1:10:03] example might be you've got to believe
[1:10:04] in brother brahma to be saved that's a
[1:10:06] lie
[1:10:07] brother abraham said it's not me it's
[1:10:08] the word of god that you got to believe
[1:10:10] now you want to respect god's prophet
[1:10:12] but see anything added on to being
[1:10:14] anything add on to salvation is a lie
[1:10:17] it's frustrating the grace of god
[1:10:19] exactly it's actually rejecting the
[1:10:20] blood of jesus christ
[1:10:22] praise god
[1:10:27] i've got i could have said something
[1:10:28] there uh look at cornelius cornish
[1:10:30] didn't even know about water baptism yet
[1:10:31] he got the holy ghost
[1:10:33] so that means he must have went through
[1:10:34] the act of repenting sanctification
[1:10:36] without the water baptism because that's
[1:10:38] just the outward show
[1:10:40] amen he already had
[1:10:42] the the answer of a good conscience
[1:10:43] toward god in his heart amen hallelujah
[1:10:46] thank god
[1:10:49] and then he got the holy ghost and then
[1:10:51] he hadn't been baptized yet so he's he
[1:10:52] comma peter commands you be baptized he
[1:10:55] got baptized just as outward sign praise
[1:10:57] god so all the saints knew that he was
[1:10:59] baptized the name of the lord
[1:11:02] see grace can be failed it can be
[1:11:04] perverted or changed it can also be
[1:11:06] frustrated
[1:11:08] or rejected and then malachi 2
[1:11:10] corinthians 6 1. hopefully this is right
[1:11:12] if not we're asking naomi she's going to
[1:11:13] tell us the verse
[1:11:22] amen thank you okay got that one right
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:26] thank the lord so see this is what
[1:11:28] happens brother uh austin people get
[1:11:30] receive god's grace but it it doesn't
[1:11:32] take effect in their life they hear
[1:11:34] about it but they don't let it take
[1:11:36] effect in their life
[1:11:37] it they received it in vain right i mean
[1:11:40] how many have all got gifts and you
[1:11:42] never use them
[1:11:43] anybody ever got a gift and you don't
[1:11:44] use it
[1:11:46] simon got me a great gift it's one of
[1:11:47] those jackets you put on and it has a
[1:11:49] battery and it warms up i didn't use it
[1:11:51] all winter i just forgot about it
[1:11:52] malcolm took it out one time and it was
[1:11:54] cold i should have wore it on a couple
[1:11:55] of times i was shoving out there
[1:11:58] but actually i've received that grace in
[1:11:59] vain or that gifting in vain i got to go
[1:12:01] get that out
[1:12:03] i thought about wearing in the mornings
[1:12:04] when it's really cold i just put it on
[1:12:05] you know while i'm studying and praying
[1:12:06] you know
[1:12:07] staying warm boston
[1:12:10] uh unmerited favor
[1:12:13] so unearned blessing unearned favor
[1:12:17] that's grace in other words you didn't
[1:12:18] earn it nothing you did for it it's just
[1:12:20] a gift
[1:12:22] yes praise god good question
[1:12:27] that's exactly right good very good yep
[1:12:30] very good very good
[1:12:32] and so see any gift can either be
[1:12:34] accepted or rejected any gift and even
[1:12:36] the gifts in your life right
[1:12:38] that man with the one talent he buried
[1:12:39] that talent in the ground
[1:12:41] he didn't have to do that
[1:12:43] he should have invested in it praise god
[1:12:45] at church if there's a gift in your life
[1:12:47] you're not sure you're investing in
[1:12:48] let's talk about it and i'll help you
[1:12:49] out praise god
[1:12:51] if it's money i can help you out with
[1:12:52] money or what whatever you need if
[1:12:53] you've got a gift of your life let's
[1:12:54] let's exercise it praise god
[1:12:57] let's not leave any let's not leave
[1:12:58] anything wasted praise god
[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:02] you got a burden on your heart let me
[1:13:04] know about it but this is what i found
[1:13:05] if you've got a burden and it costs
[1:13:06] money god will provide that burden
[1:13:09] that's what that's what perry green told
[1:13:10] brother brother and told perry green as
[1:13:12] well
[1:13:16] now look more at verse six now let's get
[1:13:17] into this here this is what i said so
[1:13:18] this one i was gonna encourage brother
[1:13:20] austin you know and lena they're praying
[1:13:21] for the holy ghost but be encouraged
[1:13:23] because you have even fruits before
[1:13:24] you're born again
[1:13:26] this parable is about the fruits at the
[1:13:28] completion of someone's life the parable
[1:13:30] of the foregrounds we'll get to this
[1:13:32] here we'll get to this in just a moment
[1:13:33] this is about the end of a person's life
[1:13:36] but
[1:13:37] before the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:39] there are fruits you you'll show
[1:13:41] remember the bible said fruitful and
[1:13:42] every good work we just read that amen
[1:13:44] so all your works should bring forth
[1:13:46] fruit
[1:13:48] all right now verse six
[1:13:49] the word of truth brings forth fruit
[1:13:52] so if you have the true word it'll
[1:13:54] produce true fruit praise god
[1:13:56] now let's recall this four grounds
[1:13:58] parable this speaks of the end of a life
[1:14:01] right
[1:14:04] but there are also fruits of repentance
[1:14:06] in justification sanctification but when
[1:14:08] he saw many of the pharisees sadducees
[1:14:10] come to his baptism he said to them o
[1:14:12] generation of vipers who hath warned you
[1:14:15] to flee from the wrath to come
[1:14:18] bring forth fruits they're i'm sorry
[1:14:20] bring forth therefore fruits
[1:14:22] meet or necessary for repentance praise
[1:14:25] god
[1:14:26] and that's what you two have showed
[1:14:27] praise god amen you showed the fruits
[1:14:30] worthy of repentance
[1:14:32] like we were talking brother it's not
[1:14:33] worthy to repent and then go cuss and
[1:14:35] swear the next day
[1:14:37] that's not fruit
[1:14:40] that's what the bible calls worldly
[1:14:41] sorrow and godly sorrow that's worldly
[1:14:43] sorrow
[1:14:44] and i've seen that so many times brother
[1:14:46] people that come to visit they leave not
[1:14:48] nobody here but people that visit leave
[1:14:50] they'll cry and i'll pray for them but
[1:14:52] then they'll go out and do the very same
[1:14:53] sin the next the next day that's just
[1:14:56] saying i'm sorry god but not being not
[1:14:58] but not accepting lord i'm accepting the
[1:15:00] power to overcome it amen hallelujah
[1:15:04] amen amen
[1:15:06] that's worldly sorrow and we got to be
[1:15:07] careful that doesn't us seep into our
[1:15:09] lives
[1:15:11] where we allow a sin to go on for months
[1:15:13] and weeks and years
[1:15:15] and and if we don't if we don't have
[1:15:17] power to overcome it that's different or
[1:15:19] if we need god to do a supernatural
[1:15:20] miracle that's different but i said
[1:15:21] there's some things brother that uh that
[1:15:24] take god to do it
[1:15:26] like even his sickness remember he had
[1:15:28] the brother braham had the sickness he
[1:15:29] looks like a demon like a squirrel
[1:15:30] looking thing every seven years it came
[1:15:32] back that was something he could never
[1:15:33] do on his own god had to do that
[1:15:36] paul's eyes remember he uh god allowed
[1:15:39] that in his eyes that's something god
[1:15:40] had to take away because god allowed
[1:15:42] that to humble him but then it would it
[1:15:43] would also have been something god would
[1:15:45] have to take away
[1:15:46] so see there's some areas of our lives
[1:15:48] that we're responsible for amen but
[1:15:50] there's some that that god is allowing
[1:15:52] there to lay there to teach us either
[1:15:54] humility or dependence on him obedience
[1:15:58] some and you got to seek god in your
[1:16:00] life you have to seek god amen you have
[1:16:02] to and god may be laying it there so you
[1:16:04] will seek him amen
[1:16:06] god may be leaving something in your
[1:16:08] life there so you will seek his face
[1:16:10] hallelujah
[1:16:12] amen
[1:16:16] so see
[1:16:17] anyone
[1:16:18] even if they're not born again can have
[1:16:19] fruits in their lives and i see good
[1:16:21] fruits in your lives you too
[1:16:23] hallelujah
[1:16:24] just like in the little ones too i
[1:16:25] baptize them i see them
[1:16:27] singing worshiping come in the house
[1:16:29] lord memorizing verses right nature
[1:16:33] wish i had a mind like you
[1:16:35] i missed my day
[1:16:37] no no i could still i could probably do
[1:16:39] it if i tried it but uh yeah i
[1:16:40] appreciate the
[1:16:42] the fruits you see the fruits of
[1:16:44] someone's sincerity praise god
[1:16:46] now so the end of your life
[1:16:48] you will come to one of these grounds
[1:16:50] amen
[1:16:52] the worst is the wayside that's the one
[1:16:54] who it falls on though it's not even
[1:16:55] it's not even in the in the garden it's
[1:16:57] off to the way side of the garden and
[1:16:59] the birds come around and eat the seeds
[1:17:00] right away that's jesus said that satan
[1:17:02] coming on snatching the gospel out of
[1:17:04] your heart that you heard
[1:17:06] so that's pharaoh right pharaoh his
[1:17:08] heart just get harder and harder and
[1:17:09] harder god knew he never would believe
[1:17:11] so that's why god hardened his heart by
[1:17:13] predestination god knew that he's a
[1:17:15] vessel and a dishonor we've had good
[1:17:16] questions about that in the sunday
[1:17:18] school
[1:17:19] god knew they'd never want to do it
[1:17:22] so he they're the wayside now the
[1:17:24] estonia is judas we're going to look at
[1:17:25] judas in a moment notice the the seed
[1:17:28] brings forth a little bit of fruit or
[1:17:30] not fruit the the seed grows a little
[1:17:32] bit
[1:17:33] doesn't bring forth any fruit
[1:17:35] but the trouble with that one is the
[1:17:37] ground
[1:17:38] the ground isn't the right ground the
[1:17:40] heart isn't the right kind of heart
[1:17:42] praise god the other one wasn't even on
[1:17:43] the on the path right i'm sorry it
[1:17:45] wasn't even in the the garden this one's
[1:17:47] in the garden but there's stones there
[1:17:51] okay that's a judas iscariot heart
[1:17:54] in other words can i say like this
[1:17:55] church
[1:17:57] the person wasn't really sincere as they
[1:17:59] should have been can i say it like that
[1:18:03] they didn't really get down to the real
[1:18:05] depths of repentance praise god in other
[1:18:08] words they didn't they weren't
[1:18:09] they weren't as serious as they should
[1:18:11] have been they weren't as sincere as
[1:18:12] they should have been
[1:18:13] that's a judas heart
[1:18:16] and i'm gonna say like this they weren't
[1:18:17] as honest as they should have been
[1:18:21] may the holy spirit help us to be honest
[1:18:28] because if you know if you know the
[1:18:29] parable here's what i'm going to get to
[1:18:30] in a little bit if you know the parable
[1:18:32] how does jesus describe the best heart
[1:18:34] he said it's a good
[1:18:36] and what honest
[1:18:38] heart well this kind the foolish version
[1:18:41] they're still saved but what does that
[1:18:43] mean it does that means they're not as
[1:18:44] honest as the wise virgins
[1:18:47] the church said
[1:18:49] and they had it for a while so that
[1:18:50] means they weren't very honest either
[1:18:52] and what did judas hide judas hid it so
[1:18:54] well oh my goodness hallelujah
[1:18:57] he hid his sin and his sinful heart so
[1:18:59] well that at at the
[1:19:01] at the at the supper the passover supper
[1:19:04] jesus said what are you going to betray
[1:19:06] me and they all look around and say is
[1:19:07] it i
[1:19:09] he was so he was so good at being and
[1:19:11] brother austin knows this too because we
[1:19:12] know people they're so good at being
[1:19:14] dishonest they believe the lies that
[1:19:16] that they say right through their mouth
[1:19:17] praise god
[1:19:19] they're so good at lying
[1:19:21] and being dishonest that they believe
[1:19:23] and can fool people
[1:19:26] by their dishonesty
[1:19:29] like judas
[1:19:30] for three and a half years he deceived
[1:19:32] those preachers
[1:19:33] and not jesus but three and a half years
[1:19:36] 11 other men brother 11 other preachers
[1:19:38] he deceived because he was dishonest in
[1:19:40] his heart
[1:19:44] may god help us to be honest
[1:19:49] now the one we got to watch out for was
[1:19:51] be here none of us are going to sell out
[1:19:52] jesus hallelujah and the church said
[1:19:56] i sold out everything for jesus i'm not
[1:19:58] selling out jesus he's i sold out
[1:19:59] everything for him praise god amen i
[1:20:01] left everything for him
[1:20:04] but here's what we got to watch out for
[1:20:07] not to let things and cares of the world
[1:20:09] choke out the effects of the word of god
[1:20:12] we have to have a good and honest heart
[1:20:15] now i preached a few weeks ago remember
[1:20:16] this brother austin
[1:20:19] the very first
[1:20:20] six steps the first things that six
[1:20:23] things to know as a new believer are in
[1:20:25] hebrews chapter six
[1:20:27] he says and we'll move on from these if
[1:20:29] god permits it
[1:20:31] and that was a beautiful that was a
[1:20:32] beautiful sermon that night a beautiful
[1:20:34] service the whole service was great it
[1:20:36] was beautiful service because it opened
[1:20:38] up in a way i never understood the very
[1:20:40] first one paul lists is what most
[1:20:42] churches fail
[1:20:44] on
[1:20:46] see they they never repent from dead
[1:20:48] works that's the key
[1:20:50] works
[1:20:51] you have to repent from all your sinful
[1:20:54] works hallelujah
[1:20:55] right
[1:20:56] they just say come to church oh you said
[1:20:58] a prayer you're saved
[1:21:00] that's not the gospel the gospel is
[1:21:02] repent of all your dead works amen
[1:21:05] hallelujah that was powerful my that
[1:21:07] really opened up to me that day
[1:21:10] so judas never did that he never
[1:21:12] repented from all the dead works he
[1:21:14] might have repented of some for a little
[1:21:15] bit but now all the dead works and then
[1:21:18] the churches got this wrong they they
[1:21:20] instead of having faith toward god they
[1:21:21] got faith toward preachers
[1:21:23] or they got faith toward brother branham
[1:21:25] which we would love brother and we have
[1:21:27] we have confidence in him but our faith
[1:21:29] is not in brother branham or any man our
[1:21:30] faith is in christ hallelujah
[1:21:33] or they got faith in riches
[1:21:36] right
[1:21:37] or they got i'll say this well yeah
[1:21:39] that's right i'll say that
[1:21:41] and then here's the one most of them and
[1:21:42] they all fail on this one too brother
[1:21:44] bang there's different baptism there's
[1:21:46] water and there's holy ghost amen
[1:21:48] and they fail on that
[1:21:50] they say as soon as you get saved in the
[1:21:51] water you're filled with the spirit
[1:21:53] they're wrong the bible proves that the
[1:21:55] bible's right praise god
[1:22:00] so your cma church my assembly of god
[1:22:02] church brother they didn't have this one
[1:22:04] right how am i going to how they ever
[1:22:05] going to move on to perfection right
[1:22:07] how they ever going to move on to
[1:22:08] perfection if they can to get these
[1:22:10] right
[1:22:11] hallelujah i'm going to make a video on
[1:22:13] that one day by god's grace
[1:22:14] the lord will help me
[1:22:16] lay on of hands
[1:22:18] the bible says there's laying on hands
[1:22:20] for healing
[1:22:21] for ordination as well
[1:22:24] right and the bible says you have to
[1:22:25] understand when to lay hands on
[1:22:27] praise god in other words you don't
[1:22:28] ordain someone lay hands we ordain them
[1:22:30] in the ministry until they're proved
[1:22:32] that they're a real saint praise god
[1:22:35] hallelujah
[1:22:36] and you don't lay hands on people to
[1:22:37] pray for them
[1:22:39] unless you uh first talk to them and
[1:22:40] make sure they've confessed their sins
[1:22:43] because the devil don't the devil don't
[1:22:45] have to move if they don't repent of
[1:22:46] their sins
[1:22:49] the resurrection of the dead they got
[1:22:51] they think there's just one resurrection
[1:22:52] there's two
[1:22:54] they just
[1:22:55] don't got that and eternal judgment
[1:22:59] they think it's eternal punishment but
[1:23:00] it's eternal judgment
[1:23:02] that soul is judged that's lost they're
[1:23:04] judged unworthy of eternal life and
[1:23:07] they're eventually annihilated
[1:23:09] but the judgment lasts eternally but
[1:23:11] thank god the grace lasts eternally as
[1:23:13] well amen hallelujah praise god eternal
[1:23:16] life hallelujah
[1:23:17] so that's why brother austin
[1:23:19] this is why we have fruit even in
[1:23:21] justification signification we have
[1:23:22] fruits that we must bring forth
[1:23:24] hallelujah amen amen
[1:23:27] i'm trying to move on boy this sixth
[1:23:28] verse must have been jam-packed with
[1:23:30] revelation this verse i can't get past
[1:23:32] verse six here see we're responsible for
[1:23:35] how we receive the word of god and what
[1:23:37] kind of ground we allow in our lives
[1:23:40] because jesus christ said the parable is
[1:23:42] this the seed is the word of god
[1:23:46] now look jesus says everybody that paul
[1:23:48] said the whole world has heard the
[1:23:50] gospel my
[1:23:52] in paul's day in 60 a.d
[1:23:55] he says as it it's come to you as it is
[1:23:58] in all the world
[1:24:00] see the gospel the seed of god's word is
[1:24:02] spread to all the world god gives
[1:24:04] everybody a chance to grow in the
[1:24:06] knowledge of god god gives that chance
[1:24:08] to everybody oh there's such power in
[1:24:10] the word of god amen have you seen it
[1:24:12] grow in your life church amen
[1:24:14] have you seen god have you seen god
[1:24:16] water a seed in your life and then enjoy
[1:24:19] the blessings of the fruit of that seed
[1:24:21] hallelujah glory amen
[1:24:24] thank you jesus
[1:24:26] like with austin alina coming back how
[1:24:28] many seeds and prayers did we plant with
[1:24:30] the word of god
[1:24:34] with jose's healing of glaucoma and
[1:24:37] banging who is dad being healed how many
[1:24:39] seeds did we plant a prayer
[1:24:41] how many seeds did we plant in the
[1:24:43] hearts in our hearts praise god let god
[1:24:44] seed be planted in our hearts
[1:24:46] how many times do we water it and then
[1:24:48] god brings forth fruits amen
[1:24:51] god's word is a seed hallelujah
[1:24:54] let it fall on a good and honest heart
[1:24:56] praise god and let god water that and it
[1:24:59] will bring forth in its season
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:06] now
[1:25:07] you have the same responsibility with
[1:25:08] every gift
[1:25:10] just like this this is speaking of a
[1:25:12] husband and wife and hopefully you
[1:25:13] enjoyed oh hopefully you enjoyed the the
[1:25:15] video i put out about husbands loving
[1:25:16] your hopefully our husbands are doing a
[1:25:18] good job with that i put that out this
[1:25:19] week so if anybody ought to be doing a
[1:25:21] good job that'll be our church amen
[1:25:23] doing a good job hobbies loving your
[1:25:25] wives
[1:25:27] hallelujah
[1:25:29] the bible said husbands should love your
[1:25:31] wives as christ loved the church
[1:25:33] and gave himself for it
[1:25:38] that doesn't mean you worship your wife
[1:25:39] but it means
[1:25:40] once you're done with your business how
[1:25:42] can i help my wife how can i give myself
[1:25:44] to help her out
[1:25:46] praise god
[1:25:49] there's got to be a balance like i was
[1:25:51] talking to a brother and he said we were
[1:25:52] doing a lot of uh a lot of home
[1:25:54] construction
[1:25:56] and they were this brother was doing a
[1:25:57] lot of home construction but he said the
[1:25:59] so the holy spirit put on his heart it's
[1:26:00] time to take a break from that and spend
[1:26:01] more time with the family that's what
[1:26:03] that's that's what that that's what this
[1:26:05] is
[1:26:07] right a man has to he he
[1:26:10] there there's a hundred things we can do
[1:26:11] at our houses brother to fix them right
[1:26:13] i can think of easily 50
[1:26:16] all right fix that gotta fix that
[1:26:18] but so you're never gonna get those done
[1:26:20] in one day right you're never gonna
[1:26:22] never gonna fix all those problems so
[1:26:24] you gotta be sensitive to the holy
[1:26:25] spirit
[1:26:26] how can i get done some of what i need
[1:26:27] to get done but then also minister to
[1:26:30] the needs of my family
[1:26:31] and show them love and show them
[1:26:33] affection and show that show them the
[1:26:36] love of jesus christ i got to make time
[1:26:38] for that too in fact i would say that's
[1:26:39] the most important thing to do amen
[1:26:42] make time for the family
[1:26:45] because the bible says
[1:26:48] if a man doesn't use knowledge or
[1:26:50] understanding of how to treat his wife
[1:26:52] his prayers will not be heard
[1:26:55] so see there's responsible
[1:26:56] brothers if you're given a gift of a
[1:26:58] wife a gift of children you've got to
[1:27:00] treat them right or else god's not going
[1:27:02] to hear your prayers
[1:27:04] because you have sin in your life
[1:27:07] so see there's responsible no matter
[1:27:09] what gift we have no matter what the
[1:27:10] gifts we all have in our lives we got to
[1:27:12] be responsible with them and we have to
[1:27:14] have a good and honest heart praise god
[1:27:19] now many of the colossians had fruitful
[1:27:20] hearts
[1:27:21] now here's where i kind of jumped ahead
[1:27:23] of this on judas and brother amen has a
[1:27:25] good testimony about this brother
[1:27:26] remember
[1:27:27] brother amen had a good testament about
[1:27:29] this but amen said in his cma church and
[1:27:31] correct me if i'm wrong on this brother
[1:27:32] he said the way they would keep members
[1:27:35] coming is that right
[1:27:37] is to kind of fearmonger them he didn't
[1:27:39] use that word that's what i'm using
[1:27:42] in other words they'd keep you coming by
[1:27:44] fear and say if you don't keep coming
[1:27:45] back to our denomination if you don't
[1:27:47] pay your tithes if you don't pay your
[1:27:48] money he said you might be they said you
[1:27:50] might be a judas is scared
[1:27:54] now that's the wrong approach you don't
[1:27:56] you don't bring people back by fear you
[1:27:58] bring them back by faith amen
[1:28:01] you would say because you're not a judas
[1:28:03] i'll expect you to be back next week
[1:28:04] amen i tell you because i know you're a
[1:28:07] peter amen or a paul amen or a tabitha
[1:28:10] amen or a priscilla amen i know you're
[1:28:12] one of those you're a lydia praise god i
[1:28:14] know you're one of those amen because i
[1:28:16] know you're one of those i'll see you
[1:28:18] next week and we're going to keep
[1:28:19] pressing the gospel and god will be
[1:28:20] glorified amen
[1:28:26] but when you honestly examine your life
[1:28:28] like that's what brother amen said on
[1:28:29] the podcast it's beautiful now that i'm
[1:28:31] in the message i don't battle am i a
[1:28:33] judas anymore because i can look at the
[1:28:35] different kinds of ground
[1:28:38] i can see i don't have a stony heart
[1:28:40] towards god amen
[1:28:42] i've got a heart of flesh towards god
[1:28:45] in other words i feel the love of god i
[1:28:47] can be moved by the leadership of the
[1:28:48] holy spirit praise god
[1:28:50] amen
[1:28:51] i can learn and grow as a christian i
[1:28:53] can grow in god's grace amen in other
[1:28:56] words i'm not hiding anything from god
[1:28:58] i'm not hiding i mean i'm not hiding
[1:29:00] anything from anybody now there's things
[1:29:01] you don't confess to other people in
[1:29:03] other words my life is an open book i
[1:29:05] want all my sins all my sins are
[1:29:06] confessed praise god i live honest
[1:29:08] before god and man i have a good heart
[1:29:11] amen hallelujah
[1:29:17] and that's a beautiful testimony we can
[1:29:19] all look at our lives
[1:29:21] so you see the the judas ground they
[1:29:24] heard it and they're happy they got
[1:29:25] gladness for a little bit no no no judas
[1:29:27] saw all the miracles
[1:29:29] he saw walking on water he saw every
[1:29:31] single one of the dead the withered hand
[1:29:33] come back
[1:29:34] he saw all these mighty miracles
[1:29:37] and he was happy about it at the
[1:29:39] beginning
[1:29:40] but he did not have root in himself
[1:29:43] and when affliction and persecution
[1:29:45] arose for the word's sake there
[1:29:47] immediately judas was offended
[1:29:51] he was originally glad now look the
[1:29:53] bible says he wasn't rooted and grounded
[1:29:56] in what love
[1:29:58] he was excited about the miracles
[1:29:59] excited about oh we got a new rabbi new
[1:30:01] teacher new church movement revival's
[1:30:03] coming but he didn't have the roots of
[1:30:05] love in his heart to really love the
[1:30:07] word of god
[1:30:09] the turn turn to john 12 6 brother
[1:30:11] austin we read that john 12 6.
[1:30:15] here it is
[1:30:19] he was not honest he wasn't honest with
[1:30:22] jesus at any time brother amen he's
[1:30:23] going to wind up to jesus and say jesus
[1:30:25] will you pray for me i don't love the
[1:30:26] poor like i should
[1:30:28] brother vance any time he could have
[1:30:30] said i'm being greedy jesus will you
[1:30:32] pray for me that god will help me and he
[1:30:34] never did that instead he hid it from
[1:30:36] jesus now of course he couldn't hide
[1:30:37] everything from jesus
[1:30:39] jesus knew from the beginning he was
[1:30:40] going to betray him
[1:30:42] but he tried to hide it from jesus he no
[1:30:44] doubt hid it from all the other 11
[1:30:46] preachers
[1:30:48] his dishonesty
[1:30:53] and then look how different that was
[1:30:55] from cornelius
[1:30:57] oh it's so beautiful man
[1:30:59] that's a good thought amen
[1:31:00] hallelujah
[1:31:03] john 12 6 brother sorry john 12 6.
[1:31:12] this he says
[1:31:20] yes sir
[1:31:21] so his statement was brother austin up
[1:31:23] in verse uh five why wasn't this
[1:31:25] ointment sold for 300 pence of money and
[1:31:28] given to the poor but he didn't say this
[1:31:30] because he cared about the poor he said
[1:31:32] this so because he had the he had the
[1:31:34] money
[1:31:34] and he could probably steal from that
[1:31:36] we don't know how much he stole we don't
[1:31:37] even know if he stole but the bible said
[1:31:39] he had a thief's heart
[1:31:40] and then he sold out jesus at the end so
[1:31:42] it's likely he was stealing the whole
[1:31:43] time but we don't know
[1:31:47] see
[1:31:49] but then cornelius on the other hand
[1:31:51] he didn't even see jesus's ministry
[1:31:54] he just heard somebody preach about it
[1:31:56] and he went to praying fasting and
[1:31:58] giving alms amen i didn't hear you
[1:32:00] praise god amen he just dedicated
[1:32:03] himself but now look church judas he saw
[1:32:05] the miracles happy for a while but
[1:32:06] pretty soon he started despising the
[1:32:08] poor can you imagine that
[1:32:10] he didn't even care about the poor
[1:32:11] people that they would help he'd go to
[1:32:13] services he'd say amen he'd do all he's
[1:32:15] just like everybody else he just acted
[1:32:17] like everybody else but in his heart
[1:32:19] he didn't care now church let me tell
[1:32:20] that to you if there's something in your
[1:32:22] heart that you don't agree with the word
[1:32:23] let's repent of it now praise god
[1:32:25] be honest
[1:32:28] be honest
[1:32:30] because no matter how great miracles you
[1:32:31] see if the heart is not rooted and
[1:32:33] grounded in love amen there's a
[1:32:35] possibility it can be a stony ground
[1:32:39] and that's what we see when people fall
[1:32:40] away from the message
[1:32:42] and they blasting the word of god or
[1:32:44] they deny the word of god
[1:32:48] see beautiful thought that's beautiful
[1:32:50] thought from the word of god
[1:32:52] all right now
[1:32:55] i felt like there was more i want to say
[1:32:56] on that one but church look at your life
[1:32:58] for a moment you know the bible says
[1:33:01] we're not this
[1:33:02] that's a judas heart we're not going to
[1:33:04] be that let's examine our hearts we just
[1:33:06] have to constantly make sure amen we got
[1:33:08] to check up every week praise god
[1:33:11] now if you have a garden how many know
[1:33:12] you've got to check out more than once a
[1:33:13] week on your garden
[1:33:16] got any gardeners out there praise god
[1:33:18] any amens out there
[1:33:19] if you check up on your garden once a
[1:33:20] week is it going to do very good
[1:33:22] probably not it's not going to do as
[1:33:23] good as if you check on it every day
[1:33:25] i know there are seasons where my wife
[1:33:26] sends the kids out to water every day
[1:33:29] because it's not a rainy season
[1:33:31] right right brother brother jose
[1:33:33] he's got a man back there so see it's
[1:33:37] not enough to just check up every sunday
[1:33:39] and wednesday
[1:33:40] we got to check up on our hearts and
[1:33:42] make sure the cares of the world are not
[1:33:44] choking out they're not choking the
[1:33:45] effects of the word in other words the
[1:33:47] word is having the biggest influence in
[1:33:49] our lives
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:52] and then if you're if you have an honest
[1:33:54] heart
[1:33:56] you'll pull those you'll confess those
[1:33:58] cares lord forgive me you'll keep
[1:34:00] weeding
[1:34:01] right anybody knows you're going to get
[1:34:03] weeds you can pull the weeds brother one
[1:34:05] day the next day there's weeds again
[1:34:06] there
[1:34:07] how does that happen
[1:34:09] it's frustrating
[1:34:11] right you can live a good day
[1:34:13] a good day of victory and the next day
[1:34:16] you have an awful dream versus awful
[1:34:18] morning wake up with a bad attitude and
[1:34:20] you got to cast that down amen
[1:34:22] you got to weed out that heart and make
[1:34:24] sure it's a good and honest heart praise
[1:34:26] god
[1:34:30] all right verse seven
[1:34:33] so the colossians let's read verse seven
[1:34:35] colossians 1 7.
[1:34:37] i'm at uh whoa 59 minutes already okay
[1:34:42] hard to believe that colossians 1 verse
[1:34:44] 7.
[1:34:46] i'll try to go a little faster through
[1:34:47] here by god's grace
[1:34:50] i just thought that was a beautiful
[1:34:51] thought i had that thought this week you
[1:34:52] know listen to brother amen's testimony
[1:34:54] about judas that's so beautiful
[1:35:00] it's not fear that's going to keep us
[1:35:01] here it's faith that's going to keep us
[1:35:02] in the word of god
[1:35:04] and we just honestly examine our lives
[1:35:07] well lord forgive me if i've got off
[1:35:08] balance here forgive me if i've cared
[1:35:11] too much about that lord forgive me
[1:35:13] i want to be good i want to have a good
[1:35:14] heart i want to have an honest heart
[1:35:17] colossians 1 7.
[1:35:18] as you also learn of epiphus our dear
[1:35:21] brother i'm sorry our dear fellow
[1:35:22] servant who is for you a faithful
[1:35:24] minister of christ who also declared
[1:35:26] unto us your love in the spirit
[1:35:31] now notice the colossians church heard
[1:35:34] the word of grace through epiphanes it
[1:35:36] wasn't through the prophet of their age
[1:35:41] but yeah did they but
[1:35:43] who can answer that do they have the
[1:35:44] love of the spirit yes or no
[1:35:46] yes they never met the prophet they
[1:35:48] never saw but they still had the love of
[1:35:50] jesus christ amen hallelujah
[1:35:52] we can have it here too amen hallelujah
[1:35:55] we never met brother braham we have no
[1:35:56] stories to tell when i was in brother
[1:35:58] ramsey's meetings i have no stories of
[1:35:59] any of those things but i do have the
[1:36:01] story of the love of jesus christ coming
[1:36:03] down into my soul amen
[1:36:06] it was shed forth abundantly on me when
[1:36:08] i received the holy ghost amen
[1:36:10] hallelujah
[1:36:12] see you don't have to meet the prophet
[1:36:13] to have the love of jesus christ
[1:36:16] i would thank god for the prophet
[1:36:18] but not it's not everybody's testimony
[1:36:22] now eprefus was a deer or beloved
[1:36:25] co-slave of paul
[1:36:28] that's what fellow servant means a coast
[1:36:30] slave
[1:36:31] church we got to look at that my life
[1:36:33] is a life of loving slavery to christ
[1:36:37] i'm just going to do whatever the master
[1:36:39] tells me to do
[1:36:41] praise god
[1:36:44] i don't want to do what my flesh wants
[1:36:46] to do because i know that's the way i
[1:36:48] know that's the gates to hell and the
[1:36:49] church said
[1:36:51] amen
[1:36:52] let us see ourselves
[1:36:54] as
[1:36:55] beloved co-slaves of the gospel
[1:36:59] so we're all slaves together praise god
[1:37:01] we're all slave we're all slaves for
[1:37:02] jesus amen
[1:37:04] we're all servants to jesus we're
[1:37:06] serving jesus's purpose not ours
[1:37:12] and he was a faithful minister a
[1:37:14] trustworthy minister
[1:37:16] and each one of us
[1:37:18] if we're honest will be trustworthy
[1:37:20] see look i'm going to look at i want to
[1:37:21] spend some time looking at the character
[1:37:23] of this man epiphanes for a few moments
[1:37:25] his name means lovely
[1:37:27] so beloved ephesus beloved lovely that's
[1:37:30] what that means
[1:37:31] he's double loved amen
[1:37:33] his name means lovely
[1:37:37] fellow labor with paul he taught the
[1:37:39] colossian church the grace of god and
[1:37:41] truth and he was designated a faithful
[1:37:43] minister of christ on their behalf
[1:37:45] he was at that time with saint paul at
[1:37:47] rome when this letter was written 80 57
[1:37:51] and we know paul's estimate of him
[1:37:53] faithful my beloved
[1:37:56] okay
[1:37:57] so his name means lovely the lovely
[1:37:59] brother
[1:38:00] here's another one from the easton's
[1:38:01] bible dictionary that was from the
[1:38:02] lexicon
[1:38:03] uh this is from the bible dictionary
[1:38:06] again his name means lovely he's a dear
[1:38:08] fellow servant faithful minister
[1:38:10] he's evidently with him at rome when he
[1:38:13] wrote the letter to the colossians so
[1:38:14] paul's in a prison remember he's writing
[1:38:16] a letter to the colossians which he
[1:38:18] never knew never met he just heard about
[1:38:20] them from ephephris
[1:38:23] he was a distinguished disciple probably
[1:38:26] the founder of the colossian church
[1:38:29] and he's called a fellow prisoner
[1:38:31] so here's the picture can you imagine
[1:38:33] paul in a prison
[1:38:35] and he must have said it's time for
[1:38:36] visitors
[1:38:37] who walks in epiphanes walks in
[1:38:40] my beloved brother paul can you imagine
[1:38:42] him running to paul
[1:38:45] i don't know if he i don't know i don't
[1:38:46] know if they got to go into cells like
[1:38:47] that i don't know or were they behind
[1:38:48] the bars i don't know
[1:38:50] but he said oh paul how are you doing my
[1:38:52] beloved brother they'd probably weep and
[1:38:54] cry you know you've been in prison all
[1:38:56] those months
[1:38:58] so many prison trips so many pr
[1:39:00] being in prison prison sentences just
[1:39:02] for preaching the gospel of christ
[1:39:04] and paul he'd hug him and say how are
[1:39:07] the colossians doing
[1:39:09] you started that church in akron how the
[1:39:11] akronite's doing
[1:39:14] i never met him
[1:39:16] how's their faith how's the church doing
[1:39:19] oh paul let me tell you they have the
[1:39:20] love of jesus christ in the church
[1:39:23] notice he didn't mention any miracles
[1:39:24] although miracles follow love right
[1:39:27] he mentions their love in the spirit
[1:39:30] their love
[1:39:33] and so paul says you know i feel led of
[1:39:34] the holy spirit i like to write this
[1:39:36] letter
[1:39:37] to the
[1:39:38] colossians pick up your pen
[1:39:42] pick up your pen and right like the holy
[1:39:43] spirit told brother brandon amen
[1:39:45] pick up your pen and write
[1:39:48] so then paul goes to writing the book of
[1:39:50] colossians
[1:39:51] through epiphus
[1:39:56] now
[1:39:57] i just i mentioned this earlier last
[1:39:58] time but they had 10 years left right so
[1:40:00] they get a letter and the clock is
[1:40:02] ticking the clock is ticking
[1:40:04] 10 years before the earthquake
[1:40:08] in church if time goes on just like
[1:40:10] there was no church in colossae there
[1:40:12] may never there might not be a church in
[1:40:14] akron
[1:40:15] or napoleon or happy valley
[1:40:19] only god knows how long these churches
[1:40:20] are going to last
[1:40:22] so we have to do our part
[1:40:26] while we have the time to do it
[1:40:28] right
[1:40:29] because this was a holy ghost filled
[1:40:30] church the colossae church but yet god
[1:40:32] let that church be destroyed
[1:40:34] or at least at least the city
[1:40:37] hopefully the people got out
[1:40:40] but some it's something to keep in mind
[1:40:41] church it ought to make us humble praise
[1:40:42] god
[1:40:44] in other words lord i don't know how
[1:40:46] much time i got help me to use it wisely
[1:40:48] for the kingdom of god
[1:40:50] help me to always be about the father's
[1:40:52] business
[1:40:56] now i want to put some quotes in here
[1:40:57] now here about our outreach a little bit
[1:40:59] here
[1:41:00] i'm going to share a few quotes brother
[1:41:02] brahm says about winning souls
[1:41:04] and he that wins souls is wise now
[1:41:06] remember the bible said the fruit of the
[1:41:07] righteous is the tree of life amen
[1:41:10] the word of god
[1:41:12] and he that wins souls is wise
[1:41:16] so we know there's a foolish version and
[1:41:18] a wise version the wise version tries to
[1:41:20] win souls
[1:41:22] now church what i find in most message
[1:41:23] churches
[1:41:24] they don't really reach out to the
[1:41:25] public denominations more reach out to
[1:41:28] the public than message churches
[1:41:30] that's not a good sign
[1:41:33] but it does fit in with the fact that
[1:41:34] jesus said few there be that find the
[1:41:36] narrow road
[1:41:38] we ought to be a church now i've talked
[1:41:40] to different pastors they say well we
[1:41:41] just pray for them and god sends them in
[1:41:42] that's true too but what about giving
[1:41:44] other people a chance to hear the word
[1:41:45] of god
[1:41:47] we've done that we've we prayed for god
[1:41:48] to send in people he has praise god
[1:41:53] right but the wise want to win souls
[1:41:56] so epiphus then he was a man god called
[1:41:59] to a community praise god just for a
[1:42:02] short time he probably was born in
[1:42:04] colossae raised there he heard about the
[1:42:06] message amen he took the message back to
[1:42:08] his hometown praise god and then he was
[1:42:10] burning he always prayed no wonder he
[1:42:12] always prayed for that church because it
[1:42:13] only had 10 years left amen and a short
[1:42:16] life span
[1:42:17] no wonder he was always making prayers
[1:42:19] for that church
[1:42:22] brother braham said it should be that a
[1:42:24] man was called of god
[1:42:26] to a community
[1:42:28] that encourages me i don't know about
[1:42:29] you i hope it encourages you but that
[1:42:31] encourages me
[1:42:34] god has called you and i to akron ohio
[1:42:38] and if he had to lay there like elijah
[1:42:39] did on top of the mountain at the brook
[1:42:41] cherith and expect the crows to feed him
[1:42:43] he ought to stay till his divine mission
[1:42:46] is fulfilled
[1:42:48] no matter if he gets a penny
[1:42:50] or not it should be the call of god
[1:42:53] first
[1:42:54] but it seemingly it's changed today to
[1:42:57] the call for money in other words
[1:42:59] preachers only go places for money
[1:43:03] or a bigger position and something on
[1:43:05] that order or to become a more popular
[1:43:07] person in a bigger church or something
[1:43:10] like that
[1:43:11] hallelujah how many want to be faithful
[1:43:12] to god's call for this community amen
[1:43:14] amen
[1:43:18] program said do you realize the
[1:43:20] responsibility of this city of tempe
[1:43:21] here i believe is resting upon your
[1:43:23] shoulders
[1:43:25] i believe that god has made you
[1:43:26] lighthouses each of you you you have a
[1:43:28] responsibility of the sins of this city
[1:43:30] is resting upon ministers upon the
[1:43:32] church people the pilgrims and we're as
[1:43:34] we're journeying through do you believe
[1:43:36] that i believe that
[1:43:38] the responsibility of this city is
[1:43:40] resting on our shoulders
[1:43:42] that's why we pray for the city
[1:43:44] that's why we pray for our family praise
[1:43:46] god that's why we pray for our loved
[1:43:47] ones amen
[1:43:49] it's resting on us just like it rested
[1:43:51] on epiphus
[1:43:54] the souls in colossae were resting they
[1:43:56] were constantly on his mind burdened
[1:43:58] about it now church think about who
[1:43:59] you're a burden for don't just think
[1:44:01] about it as you go through the week
[1:44:02] think think for a moment
[1:44:04] who are you burdened about
[1:44:07] which souls do you have a burden for
[1:44:09] just think about that for a minute
[1:44:17] who do you sit there if you're in your
[1:44:19] car by yourself think about i wish they
[1:44:21] could just receive it oh i should send
[1:44:22] them i saw a man's name i used to work
[1:44:24] with
[1:44:25] on my uh
[1:44:26] on one of my notes on one of my phone
[1:44:29] i'm like i haven't seen him for three
[1:44:30] years i'm gonna send him a text this
[1:44:31] morning so i sent him a text i heard
[1:44:33] back from him but he just came to my
[1:44:34] heart his name is ken
[1:44:36] i invited him to church i gave i offered
[1:44:38] him my book all these things he turned
[1:44:39] it down he just came to my heart
[1:44:42] see just different people will come upon
[1:44:43] our hearts
[1:44:44] and we should be burdened for them we
[1:44:46] should pray for them amen
[1:44:50] now here's here's a very can ever
[1:44:52] everybody receive this this is a real
[1:44:54] challenging quote right here
[1:44:56] okay so let me let me let me just
[1:44:57] preface that before i read this
[1:45:00] as most of you are already reading it
[1:45:01] which is okay
[1:45:03] he says the world is so dead and empty
[1:45:05] to you anymore till you simply can't
[1:45:07] have any pleasure here
[1:45:09] nothing but just winning souls to christ
[1:45:12] is all you can get pleasure out of this
[1:45:15] is a challenging quote because i just
[1:45:16] made jokes about you're excited for a
[1:45:18] steak dinner you're excited for fun
[1:45:20] excited to go to the park now kids it's
[1:45:22] okay kids you know it's okay for parents
[1:45:24] too but you know what i'm saying like
[1:45:25] this is a very challenging quote i think
[1:45:27] brother is just trying to lay it in here
[1:45:28] really hard because we should enjoy
[1:45:30] coming to church
[1:45:31] we should enjoy fellowshipping with the
[1:45:32] saints we should enjoy a nice meal the
[1:45:34] bible says the gift of god but brother
[1:45:36] is making a point here
[1:45:39] christians should have burdens to see
[1:45:41] sinners saved
[1:45:43] right
[1:45:44] and then he uses ezekiel 9 a very
[1:45:46] familiar portion to us
[1:45:50] do you know the marking angel that was
[1:45:51] sent forth to see what the holy ghost
[1:45:53] said only seal those who sighed and
[1:45:55] cried for the abominations done in the
[1:45:57] city did you ever read it
[1:45:59] not those who shout and dance those who
[1:46:01] sighed and cried for the abomination did
[1:46:02] in the city only ones that was sealed
[1:46:07] okay so this is a very challenging quote
[1:46:10] but we have to balance it out with all
[1:46:11] the other quotes right
[1:46:14] like for example
[1:46:16] did you know brother brahm wouldn't have
[1:46:18] the meetings uh brother bran was trying
[1:46:20] to set up some meetings to preach the
[1:46:21] trumpets remember that
[1:46:23] now the holy spirit then revealed to him
[1:46:25] though he'd already preached it in the
[1:46:26] in the sixth seal
[1:46:28] he preached the trumpets and the sixth
[1:46:29] seal
[1:46:30] but before god showed him that he was
[1:46:32] gonna set up meetings and he made this
[1:46:34] quote and if you want it i can find it
[1:46:36] but it just kind of came to my mind but
[1:46:38] ram said we can't have the meetings now
[1:46:39] because i got to take the kids back to
[1:46:40] arizona because they have testing to do
[1:46:44] so look at that brother branham adjusted
[1:46:46] that when services would take place for
[1:46:48] his family's education and the church
[1:46:50] said
[1:46:52] but yeah there's other quotes where
[1:46:53] education is of the devil education to
[1:46:55] the devil but yeah he wouldn't have
[1:46:57] services so his kids could take tests in
[1:46:58] school
[1:47:00] see how we got to have a balanced church
[1:47:01] in our lives
[1:47:03] so you gotta have a you have to have a
[1:47:04] balance on quotes
[1:47:06] program said we like education when it's
[1:47:08] in its place
[1:47:11] but there's some people say oh you're a
[1:47:12] sin and going to college or you're
[1:47:14] sinning learning that's nonsense
[1:47:16] you're only sinning if you're going
[1:47:17] against the will of god amen but if i'm
[1:47:19] in the will of god then nothing can stop
[1:47:21] me and god is for me amen
[1:47:23] hallelujah that's why no god's for me
[1:47:26] amen
[1:47:27] hallelujah i've always tried to follow
[1:47:29] his will by god's grace
[1:47:30] i prayed about it before i do it pray
[1:47:32] pray before you do it
[1:47:36] so see he's saying he said in other
[1:47:37] words make winning souls
[1:47:40] your greatest pleasure in life
[1:47:42] praise god
[1:47:44] make that the greatest pleasure lord
[1:47:46] help us to win a soul like when austin
[1:47:48] and lena come back you know that ought
[1:47:49] to be our greatest pleasure praise god
[1:47:51] you know when i dance remember when i
[1:47:52] danced for lord was it last sunday
[1:47:54] i was reminded that i told god if you
[1:47:57] uh or when austin gets out of debt then
[1:47:59] i'll dance for the lord remember that
[1:48:00] brother when i said that
[1:48:01] that's why i danced last night i was so
[1:48:03] happy i was like that's right it's all
[1:48:04] paid off now i never dance for the lord
[1:48:06] amen hallelujah
[1:48:08] because that's a victory amen
[1:48:10] the debt is drowned in the sea of
[1:48:12] forgetfulness amen
[1:48:14] that's when they dance when they got a
[1:48:15] victory praise god
[1:48:17] hallelujah
[1:48:19] you know y'all didn't know that that's
[1:48:21] why i was dancing i promised the lord
[1:48:22] lord if you get them out of debt i'll
[1:48:24] dance for you praise god
[1:48:25] i'll just rejoice and praise your name
[1:48:27] amen
[1:48:28] just my appreciation for the lord
[1:48:32] because that was all god
[1:48:33] that was all god
[1:48:36] now the same quote he said i want to ask
[1:48:38] you a question how many members of your
[1:48:39] family how many members of your church
[1:48:40] tonight if that angel passed by and seen
[1:48:43] those people so consecrated to god that
[1:48:45] the lost souls was on their hearts day
[1:48:47] and night they just cried inside for the
[1:48:49] abominations done in minneapolis here
[1:48:51] how many would he seal tonight just
[1:48:53] think of that for a moment this is a
[1:48:54] very challenging quote
[1:48:57] see it's a great thing to think of and
[1:48:59] remember that's the word of the lord
[1:49:03] okay so in other words he's saying
[1:49:05] if if the bible said that in ezekiel how
[1:49:07] many people would the holy spirit find
[1:49:09] in their homes praying god save so and
[1:49:11] so god save save their lost soul they're
[1:49:13] so lost god
[1:49:15] help them to get saved help them receive
[1:49:16] repentance help them to get baptized in
[1:49:18] water how many people are praying for
[1:49:20] that
[1:49:21] now how many want to pray for that
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:25] that's what we should be praying for
[1:49:27] had that desire i'm going to go share
[1:49:29] the message with my hometown amen glory
[1:49:32] and he did praise god and a little
[1:49:34] church rose up brother bang a little
[1:49:35] church rose up in colossae
[1:49:38] hallelujah because they heard the
[1:49:40] message of the prophet
[1:49:43] now i just want to share this see we're
[1:49:44] doing church everything we can to get
[1:49:46] the message out
[1:49:47] there's two there's one good looking guy
[1:49:49] in black and there's one ugly guy in
[1:49:50] orange there
[1:49:52] i just want to show you church we just
[1:49:53] put out the podcast a few weeks ago we
[1:49:56] got 42 downloads
[1:49:58] very humble beginning
[1:49:59] but i've already gotten three or four uh
[1:50:02] messages thanking me for doing it
[1:50:05] that's a blessing and they're looking
[1:50:06] forward to all of our future topics that
[1:50:08] we cover
[1:50:09] see people are hungry for truth
[1:50:11] i don't know i don't know about you but
[1:50:12] i get kind of tired of the political
[1:50:14] podcast i get tired of the other podcast
[1:50:16] you know
[1:50:17] you need you need something to chew on
[1:50:18] praise god
[1:50:19] you need eternal life
[1:50:21] so seven countries in rome or in europe
[1:50:24] have downloaded it two in africa one in
[1:50:26] south
[1:50:27] south america no none over here yet this
[1:50:29] side of the nation or this side of the
[1:50:30] world rather
[1:50:32] so it's a good humble start by god's
[1:50:34] grace
[1:50:35] and those are the countries that it's
[1:50:37] got into our little podcasts there
[1:50:40] just a humble little start
[1:50:42] so i'm grateful for that i wonder if
[1:50:43] that was brother william right there i
[1:50:44] wonder if that was him there

[1:50:48] that sorry
[1:50:50] i don't make bets
[1:50:51] now let's compare that to our youtube
[1:50:53] channel we started in 2012.
[1:50:55] this has reached 138 countries this is
[1:50:58] just the top 10.

[1:51:01] brother william right here's brother
[1:51:02] here's ghana again
[1:51:04] i wonder how many of those hours so
[1:51:07] almost 2 000 hours of the vid our videos
[1:51:10] have been watching ghana i wonder how
[1:51:12] many those are brother william
[1:51:13] i'm just joking
[1:51:16] so we still we still got about you know
[1:51:18] one uh a little over one million and a
[1:51:20] quarter
[1:51:21] and look church the average amount that
[1:51:23] we're gonna get to witness to somebody
[1:51:24] is five minutes
[1:51:26] the first five minutes
[1:51:28] that's the average amount
[1:51:30] but yet from those five minutes we've
[1:51:32] had many testimonies around the world
[1:51:34] i'll never cut my hair again
[1:51:36] on the haircut video i'll never wear
[1:51:38] makeup again praise god
[1:51:40] that's all god needs god just needs a
[1:51:41] voice
[1:51:42] god just needs a seed amen praise god
[1:51:45] amen and he'll find it'll fall on some
[1:51:47] good on his hearts amen
[1:51:49] he just needs some some sowers of the
[1:51:51] seed praise god amen
[1:51:53] like that one i'll never forget that one
[1:51:55] uh the person got baptized and he said
[1:51:57] you saved my life that woman said you
[1:51:59] saved my life through the water baptism
[1:52:00] video now that's her words not mine
[1:52:03] in other words they need to know real
[1:52:05] repentance what's that brother
[1:52:07] from argentina praise god praise god
[1:52:12] amen

[1:52:21] beautiful
[1:52:23] and see we're we're pointing them what
[1:52:25] are we trying to get fruits in their
[1:52:26] life
[1:52:27] there's fruits to every work
[1:52:29] right either the wrong fruits or the
[1:52:30] right fruits
[1:52:32] praise god and that's what we're
[1:52:33] directing people to
[1:52:36] so i thought this would connect well
[1:52:37] with epiphys he took the gospel to his
[1:52:40] community and that's what we're doing
[1:52:41] we're taking it here to the community
[1:52:43] but thankfully through the internet we
[1:52:44] can take it worldwide too
[1:52:46] and so we're slowly
[1:52:48] uh
[1:52:49] growing by god's grace and trying to get
[1:52:51] the word out so what's what i want to
[1:52:54] end with let's be like epiphanes praise
[1:52:55] god
