[17:32] [Music]
[17:47] first actually I want to share a little
[17:53] game my hat this week well I was this
[18:00] week I was reading the book of Exodus
[18:02] and I was reading about Moses and then
[18:05] the plagues that he had and I won't
[18:08] behold I had a dream about it so I think
[18:11] it was Thursday morning I had a dream
[18:13] that um my wife were driving and we saw
[18:16] a bunch of insects ladybugs fireflies
[18:20] you name it it was like a plague across
[18:23] the whole world and we're here for some
[18:24] reason we're going to California
[18:26] we were driving there I'm like look this
[18:28] is the plague in the Bible where Moses
[18:31] summoned all the plagues but I remember
[18:34] that only the Egyptians got hit but not
[18:36] the Israelites so they were protected
[18:38] like okay cuz we didn't get hit by the
[18:40] bugs or anything and then we drove from
[18:42] California to Wisconsin and then there
[18:45] was a tornado that came and then we were
[18:47] under a bridge and uh you know we're
[18:51] talking about getting up bring your
[18:52] gifts then God spoke through my wife it
[18:56] was like kind of like I don't know how
[18:59] to say it but she spoke through my wife
[19:00] and sees and God said if you don't move
[19:03] then you're gonna beat me in heaven
[19:04] right now I'm like oh no that means
[19:07] we're gonna die if we don't get out of
[19:08] here right now so we quickly drove and
[19:10] we drove all the way to Georgia but then
[19:13] my wife and I we were talking about you
[19:14] know church and like upbringing and nine
[19:16] gifts of the Spirit like wow this is
[19:18] amazing God's talking to us you know and
[19:21] then I saw my college buddies and I was
[19:25] thinking about a song in my head and
[19:29] it's a song about to sing and uh this
[19:31] guy was singing it I don't know who he
[19:32] was and the song was called at the
[19:35] midnight cry the Bride of Christ will
[19:37] rise and then when Jesus steps out on a
[19:40] kottakkal children it's pretty much
[19:42] talking about the rapture and then I
[19:45] don't know why the guy was seeing it and
[19:47] that it was a nighttime I was looking up
[19:49] in the sky and I saw the moon eclipse
[19:51] and was at midnight and as soon as the
[19:54] moon finished eclipsing I saw the cross
[19:56] of Jesus and that I knew that was I felt
[20:00] like it was gonna be the rapture at that
[20:01] moment and I woke up from that dream and
[20:05] I was telling my wife about it oh my man
[20:07] this is powerful and I had a dream just
[20:09] this morning about a few hours ago and
[20:12] it was about I was working and then we
[20:16] had a board meeting and then when I was
[20:18] at the board of me I saw Jesus and he
[20:20] was going one by one with every
[20:22] co-worker that I had he said will you
[20:24] follow me and they all said no but then
[20:26] when it came to me he never asked me
[20:27] that he never asked me if I should
[20:30] follow him right now I'm like okay so I
[20:32] went back to work I was thinking about
[20:33] in my head I was thinking about I heard
[20:35] William Brown he was talking about
[20:37] Halloween for some reason it was talking
[20:41] about how people there are people who go
[20:43] to church and then their hearts are so
[20:45] far away from God but yet they still
[20:47] like to go Halloween and do do all those
[20:49] stuff you know and yet they're in the
[20:51] message and stuff like family Wow and
[20:53] then I was thinking about that and then
[20:55] this part speak me I heard wedding bells
[20:58] ring really loud like I really thought
[21:01] the rapture was happening when I was
[21:02] sleeping that that's how loud it was and
[21:04] how scared I was not scary but like I
[21:08] was like so nervous I'm like oh man this
[21:11] the rash is happening right now and like
[21:14] my welcome or my wife woke me up before
[21:16] uh right after is so I'm like wow praise
[21:19] the Lord two weeks I mean yeah this week
[21:21] I had two dreams about the Lord coming
[21:23] the rapture happening it's
[21:26] so I want to sing a song I jumped about
[21:30] [Music]
[21:37] [Applause]
[21:39] of a mighty rushing wind
[21:46] and it's closer now
[21:57] and I can almost hear the trumpet
[22:03] that's Gabriel says like oh yeah the
[22:12] midnight cry
[22:15] we'll be going home when Jesus steps up
[22:27] on a cloud and all its children
[22:33] the dead in Christ all right
[22:39] [Music]
[22:44] and those that which we beg will be
[22:52] quickly change
[22:55] [Applause]
[22:58] after midnight cry

[23:16] fulfilling
[23:21] head size of the time
[23:26] they're a pyramid
[23:30] [Music]

[36:04] the Holy Ghost observe I lower the
[36:07] bhakti small espíritu Santo as you
[36:09] follow that you desire to see God move
[36:12] and gifts come on tell you think I think
[36:14] that but I el momento de Dios activist
[36:16] so that's the order and the right
[36:18] approach to gifts it's a lower than para
[36:21] obtener little Don let's have a word of
[36:24] Prayer vamos a tener una palabra de las

[36:42] administer to us through the Word of God
[36:46] la palabra de Dios encourage every heart

[37:06] for your glory or a to Gloria in Jesus
[37:10] Christ's name and normally he was a man
[37:12] I mean God bless she's been seated
[37:25] all right so Lydia we have a few quotes
[37:29] and slides if you'd like to switch over
[37:32] and that's show those now I told you I
[37:37] was gonna print out a little sheet for
[37:39] you so I have a little sheep for you
[37:40] today I'll pass it out at the end they
[37:42] have you're not okay with them I don't
[37:44] know
[37:44] oh ha ha pasado finale and maybe we'll
[37:48] take about ten minutes of prayer at the
[37:50] end and we'll just pray and ask the Lord
[37:54] to reveal if God has used any gift in
[37:58] your life a final visit and hermano
[38:02] Desmond o today ASEAN para buscar Nelson
[38:04] York a donation okay d'Asti NFR honest
[38:07] Avila and the purpose is so that you can
[38:11] be faithful with your gifts propose it
[38:14] to have to say I feel I don't today
[38:19] oh now I didn't read Luke 19 normally I
[38:24] must look at this in a way but we read
[38:26] it last week and Jesus gives everyone
[38:31] one pound I know on talento which in
[38:37] today's standards will be about $15,000
[38:39] okay I'll do a aproximadamente Kings a
[38:43] million dollars
[38:44] Jesus calls that a very little amount
[38:49] Kenya can see that because he tells the
[38:52] servant you've been faithful with a very
[38:54] little fearful sobre lo poco I feel of
[38:59] feeling and then we saw how the faithful
[39:03] servants in McComb oil feel fear beau
[39:06] had a five-fold increase or tenfold
[39:09] increase incremental Oh cinco EDS basis
[39:13] praise God
[39:15] a lot of sales in your now I want to
[39:17] just go over some foundations for a
[39:19] moment or the or the basic truths about
[39:27] gifts are basically load honest because
[39:30] we know like with charismatic churches
[39:35] or Pentecostal denominational churches
[39:43] many of them make speaking in tongues as
[39:46] the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[39:48] yes conceal and carry blood and linguist
[39:51] la we then see le petit anse anthem but
[39:54] we know that's not exactly right okay no
[39:58] noise correction because when they spoke
[40:00] in tongues on the day of Pentecost was
[40:04] in Pentecost this everyone understood
[40:07] the tongues via linguist and today most
[40:14] people speak with tongues and few
[40:17] understand yeah boy which i hain't the
[40:20] Evelyn Lang was in no song anthem Venus
[40:22] and there's five times the Holy Ghost
[40:24] fell in the book of Acts a sink over the
[40:27] sky or liquid into Santo and a liberal a
[40:31] chose three of them had tongues
[40:35] tonight the a of to Iran linguist but
[40:37] two of them did not well though they
[40:39] have not we Adam and then Paul says he
[40:42] Pablo DC do all speak with tongues
[40:46] language and that's in first Corinthians
[40:51] 12:30
[40:52] yes M primera Corinthians DOS a treinta
[40:56] and so that's that
[40:58] our that's our position on that doctrine
[41:03] Trina because I've seen numerous people
[41:07] speak in tongues and then later fall
[41:12] into a complete life of sin mostarda can
[41:15] be the complete other picado so that
[41:18] proves speaking in tongues is not the
[41:20] seal Ling what no and he'll tell you
[41:24] because when you have the seal porque
[41:26] cuando tienes a yo it's a permanent mark
[41:30] on your life that means you're
[41:34] permanently faithful to Christ
[41:37] their momentum na marcado para el Senor
[41:40] hisses and we believe in tongues a
[41:42] Muslim linguist we believe
[41:44] interpretation but it's not the evidence
[41:49] of being born again everything Jesus
[41:53] told us the evidence he said when the
[41:58] spirit of truth comes Vanga it'll guide
[42:02] you into all truth
[42:05] so someone who's clearly are truly born
[42:07] again
[42:09] I'm antenna see though that no I wa is
[42:12] in the word all the way in obeys all the
[42:17] Word of God we looked at that a little
[42:22] bit on Wednesday night so you can watch
[42:26] that if you like to watch that saved on
[42:33] youtube now here's a few bullet points
[42:40] as Holy Ghost filled Christians we seek
[42:47] the giver Baca Moselle dad or first
[42:51] remarry not the gifts no so I was raised
[42:56] in a church that sought the gifts and
[43:01] they they tried to urge me to speak with
[43:04] tongues and they said Jesse just keep
[43:09] saying I love Jesus over and over
[43:12] aaaah - Ian Jessie Montaigne telly
[43:16] siendo you are more hassles your mind
[43:19] and there's a great anointing there and
[43:23] I jumbled up some of my words because I
[43:27] was emotional motion odd oh and they
[43:32] thought I spoke with tongues but I did
[43:37] it and as soon as they're done praying
[43:40] for me for me I went outside and played
[43:44] football
[43:45] Yahoo got a football but if I'd have
[43:48] been truly born again I would have
[43:52] declared the wonderful works of God
[43:56] because that's what acts 2 says edge of
[44:00] those and so they were they were sincere
[44:05] but sincerely wrong so we seek Christ
[44:10] the giver first and then the gifts
[44:15] follow and that's what 1st Corinthians
[44:21] 14:1 says means capital rocket or say Oh
[44:26] No
[44:26] listen follow charity and desire
[44:32] spiritual gifts praise God and Jesus
[44:39] says in mark 16 these signs shall follow
[44:44] them that believe so see we follow
[44:51] charity or the leadership of the Holy
[44:55] Ghost then signs follow us see we never
[45:03] put the signs in front of the word but
[45:12] the Bible says we should desire them and
[45:16] the Bible said we shouldn't be ignorant
[45:18] of them so we have to preach on them
[45:26] I'm okay pretty car so radio so we're
[45:29] not ignorant of them all so we must
[45:35] cover the best gifts so there's a few
[45:41] things we're allowed to cover in life
[45:44] not much but we should cover spiritual
[45:49] things that means so what what someone
[45:55] else has to see we want what God has
[46:04] want God's will for our lives we want
[46:09] God's leading amongst the church so we
[46:15] covered after that and then love
[46:19] motivates the gifts
[46:26] so before gift operates we we first we
[46:37] first know that love is our motivation
[46:45] now we looked at last week how gifts are
[46:52] Jesus's love tokens for the marriage of
[47:02] he and his bride and brother Branham
[47:08] says gifts are like bait on a hook so
[47:19] sometimes the manifestation of a gift
[47:22] will attract someone sometimes seeing a
[47:31] miracle will lead someone to Christ but
[47:38] the only way they stay with
[47:39] Christ is to get hooked on the word
[47:48] because we know anyone can see a miracle
[47:54] but then later fall away from God's Word
[48:01] is available on seniority now the
[48:05] Prophet also says gifts run the church
[48:07] and keep it clean now we know running
[48:16] the church would be like the fivefold
[48:18] ministry so God gifts men to run the
[48:33] church with the preaching gifts now the
[48:42] nine gifts of the Spirit keep it clean
[48:47] now preaching can too of course but this
[48:53] is the the the ministry of the laity is
[48:56] in keeping it clean praise God Casa Mira
[49:05] how's your wife understanding it pretty
[49:07] good so far okay good good so make sure
[49:12] we're doing a good job I want to go too
[49:15] slow or you know or too fast or slow
[49:17] okay yes sir so different for me you
[49:21] know I'm usually a million miles a
[49:24] minute you know I want to give two exact
[49:27] quotes from william branham
[49:32] and i want to share with Kylie
[49:35] since he's new God sent a man named
[49:40] William Branham he passed away in the
[49:47] 1960s
[49:49] by you and me no I think oh but he had a
[49:52] tremendous supernatural ministry the the
[49:59] most important part of his ministry was
[50:01] that he restored Bible work Bible
[50:03] teaching so that's why you refer to me
[50:12] say brother Branham said dear man he was
[50:19] also a prophet because he foretold
[50:25] antici for all of the event and so if
[50:28] you hear me say the Prophet said I'm
[50:33] usually referring to William Branham
[50:36] okay so I hope that helps you by God's
[50:38] grace
[50:41] one thing he foretold was that rock and
[50:46] roll would take over churches so he said
[50:51] that in 1965 and now we see mega
[50:56] churches that live on rock and roll so
[51:03] that was foretold you know 50 years
[51:05] before it happened
[51:11] so here's what he said about gifts
[51:14] there's nobody can ever see God's gifts
[51:19] operate but what it thrills them is it a
[51:27] thrill to a church when God operates
[51:31] supernaturally in the context of the
[51:36] quote brother Branham was speaking of
[51:41] Solomon and the Queen of Sheba and how
[51:48] she was so amazed
[51:57] at the gift of discernment and the gift
[52:01] of wisdom in Solomon's life here's
[52:06] another quote oh you're fine
[52:13] God's gifts has always caused an
[52:16] enthusiasm praise God I got to do
[52:23] something nice for him after service so
[52:26] don't leave brother I got you some nice
[52:28] for you now from the Bible the Bible
[52:33] teaches this in 1st Corinthians 14 gifts
[52:44] gifts they make visiting unbelievers
[52:48] testify to God's presence so whether
[53:00] it's through an interpreted tongue or
[53:05] the preaching of the word God discerns
[53:10] people's secrets when God does that the
[53:17] unbeliever acknowledges that God is with
[53:22] you how many ever had that happen to
[53:26] them where a preaching gift or a gift of
[53:34] the Spirit reveal some secret that you
[53:39] had in your heart oh my it's happened to
[53:43] all of us if not get ready you hang
[53:47] around God long enough he's gonna tell
[53:50] your secrets if you can tell the king of
[53:54] Syria his secrets there Elisha you
[54:02] listen to Elisha long enough
[54:03] [Laughter]
[54:06] which is brother branham's ministry
[54:11] it'll reveal your secrets praise God
[54:16] amen
[54:17] so those are some foundations now I
[54:25] mentioned some quotes last week and I
[54:31] wonder have you read them this week and
[54:37] I'm reading this to encourage you
[54:42] because we all go through seasons some
[54:47] seasons we feel closer to God than
[54:49] others some seasons were more faithful
[54:55] than others but God's grace never leaves
[55:01] us God will not forsake his children we
[55:11] so many times emphasized the
[55:16] supernatural things God did through
[55:20] brother Branham just like evangelicals
[55:26] just like evangelical churches or just
[55:30] like Baptist churches they remember the
[55:36] great things of Billy Graham's ministry
[55:45] and that's what we want to do today so I
[55:50] want to read these quotes here and show
[55:54] how brother Branham fell short at times
[56:00] but we know there's so many other times
[56:04] he was obedient to God
[56:06] and God did supernatural things through
[56:12] his ministry
[56:14] the same is true with us when we're
[56:18] disobedient we're gonna feel low we're
[56:25] gonna feel like we're not even saved but
[56:30] we are saved amen we are God's children
[56:36] we're not gonna feel like it but we all
[56:41] fall short of God's glory but God
[56:46] promises to raise us up the righteous
[56:52] man falls seven times but the Lord
[56:57] raises him up so the first one is from
[57:02] 1956 sometimes I look at myself and
[57:11] think I've been such a jellyfish in my
[57:13] life that's a lot of words that's okay
[57:18] but I'm not gonna read all of it but
[57:19] thank you I've waited and missed many
[57:28] thousands of souls in the kingdom
[57:37] because I've depended too much on a
[57:40] spiritual gift me a vision then I'll
[57:48] turn around and let someone talk me into
[57:52] something else he said but I have to
[58:01] come to the spot till I feel it's a
[58:07] faith and I must step out there because
[58:14] it's a promise
[58:15] praise God a simple example is like
[58:20] coming to church
[58:25] don't feel easy to come to church we
[58:29] should still come because he promised to
[58:33] gather whoever two or three are gathered
[58:38] you have a promise to meet Jesus this
[58:42] morning
[58:44] it's my promise you don't have to depend
[58:47] on a spiritual gift for that now like I
[58:57] said last week he said he missed many
[59:01] thousands of souls but no doubt God
[59:09] would have saved them some other way
[59:15] because the Bible said God will not lose
[59:17] one praise God like when Judas fell from
[59:25] his position God raised up Matthias in
[59:30] his place now we know eternally Paul
[59:35] will be take that place but history says
[59:41] Matthias preached in many communities as
[59:47] a missionary started many churches and
[59:52] then died as it through crucifixion like
[59:56] Christ see God will find a way to save
[1:00:02] the souls Jesus leaves the 99 and he
[1:00:10] goes to get the one praise God then he
[1:00:19] says sometimes I stand around like a
[1:00:21] jellyfish and it makes me discouraged
[1:00:28] with myself anyone ever get discouraged
[1:00:33] about yourself
[1:00:38] it's time to keep your eye on the
[1:00:41] promise by God's grace I aim to do and I
[1:00:51] realize every devil of Hell will shoot
[1:00:57] at me but by God's grace I aim to keep
[1:01:02] my eye on the promise so see we're all
[1:01:06] gonna feel like failures at times we're
[1:01:10] all gonna feel like failure sometimes we
[1:01:14] got to turn our eyes to Christ don't
[1:01:19] look at ourselves but look at the
[1:01:22] sacrifice the blood of Christ in heaven
[1:01:27] and let our courage be renewed let your
[1:01:34] mind be transformed have a new start
[1:01:39] have a new season a new beginning a
[1:01:43] fresh start with the Lord now this is a
[1:01:54] long quote but it's preached in
[1:01:55] jeffersonville he's talked about people
[1:02:02] doing worldly things like sports games
[1:02:11] Mews mints television Hollywood he says
[1:02:20] your soul is growing on that kind of
[1:02:23] trash I'm gonna change the word that's
[1:02:29] the reason people don't have real hunger
[1:02:31] for God I was looking at an article
[1:02:38] online and it said you might people see
[1:02:43] my people might see eight commercials in
[1:02:46] an hour
[1:02:48] Oh Joe commercialism and most of those
[1:02:52] have some type of sexual temptation on
[1:02:54] them so see people's souls grow on
[1:03:04] that spirit of lust or may I say they're
[1:03:14] feeding on those unting spirits so
[1:03:21] that's why they don't want to feed on
[1:03:23] the things of God unless they'll say
[1:03:29] it's okay for me to watch a game it's
[1:03:35] okay for me to watch a movie but it's
[1:03:39] not really if all this trash comes along
[1:03:42] with it because it it makes you feed on
[1:03:49] the world rather than feeding on God's
[1:03:50] Word and the Prophet says you ought to
[1:03:59] have your Bible out somewhere laying out
[1:04:05] before God on your knees praying for the
[1:04:13] sins of the country he said I'm guilty
[1:04:17] with you so he noticed how he could be
[1:04:22] praying more and we could all raise our
[1:04:26] hands and say I should pray more but
[1:04:31] we've got to follow that up with action
[1:04:35] so we got to pray more tomorrow don't
[1:04:41] put it off to next year do it tomorrow
[1:04:47] he said I've made up my mind by the help
[1:04:54] of God I'm determined to press towards
[1:04:59] the mark I'm gonna skip some words here
[1:05:07] he said I'm lagging behind and become a
[1:05:13] spiritual enemy ax I'm sorry Anna
[1:05:16] Anna Anna Mia anemia anemia sorry
[1:05:26] never the same the under asana trust
[1:05:31] instead in the nearest cell the
[1:05:37] hallelula by now I should read the
[1:05:41] sentence before head I'm sorry the
[1:05:43] beginning part of the sentence
[1:05:47] seeing the works and the things I've
[1:05:50] seen that's right I'm sorry
[1:05:55] seeing the works and seeing the things
[1:05:57] that I've seen and lagging behind it's
[1:06:04] every understand he should have been
[1:06:08] further up the road you and I should
[1:06:14] probably be further up the road right if
[1:06:19] we're honest with ourselves but God is
[1:06:26] great
[1:06:27] in translations and moving people up the
[1:06:31] road like with Philip praise God he
[1:06:39] naturally translated him up the road in
[1:06:46] other words God can help us catch up if
[1:06:52] we fall behind God is the great restorer
[1:06:57] I hope these quotes help you I'm a
[1:07:05] jellyfish I'm lagging behind there's
[1:07:14] another one 1953 he's preaching on do
[1:07:23] you now believe
[1:07:29] I'm not calling any down because of
[1:07:34] unbelief because I pray God forgive me
[1:07:40] of my unbelief
[1:07:44] I'm ashamed of my faith
[1:07:48] there's many personal dealings and
[1:07:55] face-to-face talks and experience that
[1:08:01] God has given me I feel ashamed of
[1:08:09] myself I publicly confess it I ought to
[1:08:16] have mountains of faith but I see he
[1:08:22] realized he didn't have mountains of
[1:08:23] faith but he knew he should have so he
[1:08:31] couldn't rebuke the people so I hope
[1:08:36] this helps you understand also recognize
[1:08:42] this though if you get a genuine rebuke
[1:08:46] from a preacher and it's led by the Holy
[1:08:52] Spirit then that preacher must be
[1:08:58] walking in obedience to the word I can
[1:09:03] show you many times brother branham
[1:09:06] rebuke denominations never understand
[1:09:12] see there's time and that's because
[1:09:14] we're in a season of obedience but
[1:09:20] they're seasons where we can't rebuke
[1:09:23] because we need the rebuke praise God is
[1:09:29] that what it says the RAM said I can't
[1:09:32] rebuke you because I'm falling short but
[1:09:39] then in the indictment sermon
[1:09:43] he rebukes every preacher that teaches
[1:09:50] there's no more miracles and refuses to
[1:09:56] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:00] Christ when they've seen though when
[1:10:04] they've seen the truth of it and he
[1:10:08] indict them in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:12] to indict means to formally charge now
[1:10:21] if that's not a rebuke I don't know what
[1:10:23] is so I hope this helps us understand if
[1:10:32] it does say Amen see I normally put
[1:10:36] quotes of the Prophet that are all
[1:10:42] teaching that are all exploits of faith
[1:10:47] they're all speaking the word but here I
[1:10:52] wanted to show you some more humble
[1:10:54] quotes that showed his humanity and how
[1:11:02] he had to wrestle against flesh and
[1:11:03] blood just like you and I wrestle
[1:11:10] against flesh and blood I'll tell you he
[1:11:13] won the wrestling match and so can you
[1:11:17] praise God so can I Amen praise God but
[1:11:24] the only thing I say is god help us have
[1:11:29] faith and as we see manifestations of
[1:11:35] God's presence it increases our faith to
[1:11:43] believe in Him praise God now gifts are
[1:11:48] manifestations of God's Spirit so we
[1:11:55] want to see our
[1:11:55] faith rise but that comes by seeing God
[1:12:02] using his gifts so we see how they're
[1:12:07] connected praise God
[1:12:11] now I just want to go through two quick
[1:12:15] quotes concerning your gifts the first
[1:12:24] one he says first find out if it's
[1:12:28] scripture for you to do it if it's in
[1:12:34] the scriptures not just wrote in one
[1:12:38] place but I mean completely scriptural
[1:12:44] through the Bible for you to do it your
[1:12:49] position and I'm gonna skip down first
[1:12:54] see if God called you so God's only
[1:12:59] gonna call you through the Bible God's
[1:13:04] not going to call you to a gift outside
[1:13:06] the Bible the easiest example is women
[1:13:13] preachers Jesus never called a woman to
[1:13:21] be an apostle and Paul said I never
[1:13:26] allow a woman to teach men all the other
[1:13:33] examples of women that have authority in
[1:13:38] the Bible are in their area as been
[1:13:44] leadership through the priesthood
[1:13:49] Deborah is the most used example she was
[1:13:54] a judge but that's not spiritual in the
[1:13:59] priesthood that's that's political like
[1:14:05] we'd say in the government
[1:14:09] and the fact was Israel was Baxter then
[1:14:13] at that time so the men weren't leading
[1:14:18] as they ought to
[1:14:23] so they lacked male leadership so God
[1:14:28] had to raise up a woman in the
[1:14:32] government who had a gift of prophecy
[1:14:38] praise God
[1:14:41] next now brother ram tells us to try out
[1:14:45] a gift but of course we pray first if
[1:14:57] the gift is not even in the Bible for
[1:15:00] you to do it then you won't try it out
[1:15:07] no matter how much you pray about it
[1:15:11] so first fine if it's scriptural then
[1:15:17] you pray about it
[1:15:19] before you try it out so it's easy to
[1:15:25] look at a preacher and as an example
[1:15:31] I'll use myself as soon as I came to the
[1:15:35] message and I go to message churches
[1:15:41] like the first one I went to his brother
[1:15:43] Samuel is up there as soon as I walked
[1:15:49] in I knew I was called to the pulpit I
[1:15:55] felt like a magnet pulling me to the
[1:15:57] pulpit but I waited upon it I prayed
[1:16:06] about it I just let the Lord deal with
[1:16:10] it and then about three years later was
[1:16:17] when I started preaching
[1:16:20] [Laughter]
[1:16:27] praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus
[1:16:30] glory Bray's God but I had to take that
[1:16:43] step of faith because faith is a
[1:16:49] revelation it was revealed to me I'm to
[1:16:53] be at the pulpit it wasn't a step of
[1:16:58] Hope it was a step of faith and we've
[1:17:05] got to be careful not to take steps of
[1:17:09] hope
[1:17:11] first let God reveal your gift then you
[1:17:18] step out in faith to act upon it praise
[1:17:25] God
[1:17:28] now the prophets talking about a song
[1:17:30] leader he said God has give you talent
[1:17:42] you say well brother branham God hasn't
[1:17:45] given me nothing I wonder how many
[1:17:50] people come to church with that attitude
[1:17:55] how sad that is whether William they'll
[1:18:00] go years people will go decades and feel
[1:18:04] like God gave them nothing that's
[1:18:12] impossible
[1:18:14] the Bible said the gifts are given to
[1:18:16] every man so that we all profit
[1:18:24] everybody has a divine portion a measure
[1:18:31] of a gift the Bible says
[1:18:34] whether your portion is small medium or
[1:18:40] massive or large you have a divine
[1:18:43] deposit you have a divine talent God has
[1:18:51] given to you and you and I are supposed
[1:18:54] to use it for others glory you should
[1:19:00] live for the people in this room if
[1:19:04] nobody else you should live for the
[1:19:08] people in this room I know it's hard to
[1:19:11] save souls I get discouraged sometimes
[1:19:16] too but God always encourages me when he
[1:19:23] uses my gift to help all of you because
[1:19:29] that's what the gifts are for Lord
[1:19:32] they're for believers they're not for
[1:19:36] unbelievers they're for believers but so
[1:19:43] many people say they have nothing you
[1:19:47] know that's a sin I believe to say God
[1:19:50] hasn't given me anything that's like the
[1:19:57] man that buried the tail in the ground
[1:20:01] he just forgot about it the trouble is
[1:20:05] you forgot what God gave you amen
[1:20:08] you so buried it down under years of
[1:20:11] depression or years of doubt and fear
[1:20:19] that we forget what God has given to us
[1:20:24] we forgotten the move of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:29] in the pound's parable he put a napkin
[1:20:33] around it in the pound's parable he
[1:20:38] wrapped a napkin around his money and
[1:20:44] we'll be all so we see just covered
[1:20:50] you want to hide it from his own sight
[1:20:54] so he covered it up that's what people
[1:20:59] will do today
[1:21:01] they're so pissed about their gifts
[1:21:06] they'll just put it out of their sight
[1:21:09] they'll look at anything else other than
[1:21:14] God's call for their life look at money
[1:21:20] in business jokes in Hollywood Sports
[1:21:28] and shopping you name it look at
[1:21:33] anything else but God's divine gifts in
[1:21:38] their life he says you don't know maybe
[1:21:48] see you may just go try something maybe
[1:21:55] you've never went out and testified to
[1:21:57] somebody try that going everybody can't
[1:22:08] do that we all know Simon can do it
[1:22:13] Simon save that so this socios I was
[1:22:17] pointing you but I had three point back
[1:22:19] at me sister see actually two pointing
[1:22:21] you sat right Simon can he just he just
[1:22:24] came up like this he said brother Jesse
[1:22:26] he said you've got to listen this
[1:22:28] serpent seed sermon
[1:22:37] excellence I see me enter little pimping
[1:22:40] he urged me to listen to it I'll say
[1:22:45] like this he compelled me to listen to
[1:22:47] it because that's scriptural Jesus said
[1:22:55] the last call for the wedding supper
[1:23:01] he said go to the highways and hedges
[1:23:04] and compel them to come in hallelujah
[1:23:10] now Simon doesn't do that with everybody
[1:23:14] but he does it with a lot more than I do
[1:23:21] because everybody can't do that but if
[1:23:26] you're not sure and if you never tried
[1:23:30] try it today man try tomorrow
[1:23:35] try this week get prayed up and see if
[1:23:41] you can't testify to somebody there's
[1:23:47] something you can do that you can put it
[1:23:53] to God he says he said you have to yield
[1:24:03] so with gifts it's all about yielding to
[1:24:06] God's Spirit in other words we got to be
[1:24:11] willing to do something thank God we're
[1:24:17] willing to come to church now God's
[1:24:21] calling you for another level of being
[1:24:24] willing you got to be willing to give
[1:24:30] more to the kingdom of God coming to
[1:24:35] church is not going to be enough to go
[1:24:37] in the rapture that's part of it but you
[1:24:44] got to be willing to give more of your
[1:24:46] life to God you got to be wise with your
[1:24:51] time because if you're saved you'll
[1:24:57] either be foolish with your time or wise
[1:25:02] with your time and if you're wise with
[1:25:05] it you'll have extra oil to go out to
[1:25:12] meet Christ
[1:25:14] yeah to go into the marriage supper so
[1:25:19] how we deal with our time reveals which
[1:25:24] condition were in we ought to feel
[1:25:28] blessed God give us a few extra years to
[1:25:33] use our time for the kingdom of God if
[1:25:38] you haven't yet redeemed the time and
[1:25:42] you don't yet know your gifts or you're
[1:25:46] not investing in your gifts thank God
[1:25:51] for another year to service make this
[1:25:54] the year you purposely redeemed the time
[1:26:08] well BAM even calls whistling a gift did
[1:26:10] you know that he calls whistling a gift
[1:26:20] and don't that's why sometimes I whistle
[1:26:25] during song service I just love to do it
[1:26:29] but a man who sings has to yield his
[1:26:34] voice like our brothers with the song
[1:26:41] special like Naomi songs specialist was
[1:26:45] a Wednesday night has to be something
[1:26:53] that you yield or sacrifice for others
[1:27:01] he says the man who could sing yielded
[1:27:04] himself he give in to it
[1:27:12] in other words he surrendered
[1:27:16] we might not feel like it we've got to
[1:27:20] give in to it we've got to let Christ
[1:27:24] lead us
[1:27:27] instead of leading ourselves and he says
[1:27:32] that's how he yields to visions he talks
[1:27:40] again about men singing and men
[1:27:41] whistling the same this the same way you
[1:27:50] yield to whistling what he says is the
[1:27:55] same way he yields to a vision read it
[1:28:01] all together it's for one edification of
[1:28:07] the glory of Jesus Christ the Son of God
[1:28:12] so if you feel like you got a gift
[1:28:16] make sure it's scriptural pray
[1:28:21] beforehand get anointed then yield
[1:28:28] yourself try to do it I got a little
[1:28:36] scripture on my heart
[1:28:37] bear with me go to Ezra got Azra I just
[1:28:41] read it this morning my what a
[1:28:42] tremendous Scripture it was here Ezra I
[1:28:47] gotta look it up it was right here sorry
[1:28:50] I'm gonna preach a little bit on this
[1:28:52] tonight oh here it is yeah
[1:28:55] Ezra 822 it's so small please don't
[1:28:57] strain your eyes as you're 822 it ties
[1:29:01] right in with gifts
[1:29:03] Ezra 822
[1:29:13] a dress or short length goes now brother
[1:29:28] amen sings a song called in your
[1:29:33] presence and that's where I'm strong
[1:29:39] that's where I belong
[1:29:42] I sang that growing up in the
[1:29:44] Pentecostal church in the 1980s and 90s
[1:29:51] I loved the song then I loved a lot more
[1:29:58] now especially when he sings it because
[1:30:03] he's got the revelation of the message
[1:30:09] as her 8:22 now in context Ezra's
[1:30:15] leaving Babylon to go back to Israel and
[1:30:26] let's read verse 22 for hours ashamed to
[1:30:29] require the king a band of soldiers and
[1:30:31] horsemen
[1:30:32] to help us against the enemy in the way
[1:30:35] to avert winds at the penetrate ropa a
[1:30:38] gente de caballo cannot defend the
[1:30:41] assemble in amigo and El Camino because
[1:30:43] we had spoken under the king saying
[1:30:47] diciendo the hand of our God is upon all
[1:30:51] them for good that seek Him
[1:30:56] sobre la busca but his power and his
[1:31:00] wrath is against all them that forsake
[1:31:02] him verse 23 so we fasted and we saw our
[1:31:11] God for this and he was entreated of us
[1:31:20] did you catch that revelation in there
[1:31:24] when is guy
[1:31:25] hand upon you when you're fasting and
[1:31:30] seeking his face and notice the Bible
[1:31:36] said all a double L now just preachers
[1:31:45] any servant of God male female younger
[1:31:51] old when they're seeking God the hand of
[1:31:56] God is upon them the anointing of the
[1:32:00] Holy Ghost is upon all them that seek
[1:32:05] God glory that's why I like that song in
[1:32:12] your presence that's where I'm strong
[1:32:15] and to presence yeah I yet on the euro
[1:32:19] so I fourth day after I spend time
[1:32:20] praying in God's presence
[1:32:21] I walk to the pulpit amen
[1:32:29] I'm gone I feel like I'm gonna slay some
[1:32:33] demons or something like that because
[1:32:38] the hand of God is upon me I don't care
[1:32:42] what anybody says I don't care who's
[1:32:46] here don't care who's livestreaming when
[1:32:51] the hand of God is upon you God is going
[1:32:55] to use your gifts because you've just
[1:32:58] spent time seeking his face to Tiempo
[1:33:03] with candles rostro he's anointed you
[1:33:05] for the job can you say Amen
[1:33:14] that's why fasting is so important that
[1:33:16] poor SSK like you know is muy importante
[1:33:19] it truly brings humility you never be as
[1:33:25] humble as you want to be until you
[1:33:32] fasted a you and me in that scriptural
[1:33:36] Psalms 30:5 Cinco verse 15 35 15 Kings
[1:33:52] II know it's 13 sorry I said 35 13 or
[1:33:59] something I think they think of dressing
[1:34:04] but as for me when they were sick my
[1:34:06] clothing was sack cloth you're one the
[1:34:09] way your thing for tomorrow maybe Steve
[1:34:11] if he leaves you I humbled my soul with
[1:34:15] fasting preheat oh my you know me Alma
[1:34:18] and my prayer returned into my own bosom
[1:34:22] Amiata fiance well via I miss em so see
[1:34:29] that david says he humbled himself
[1:34:31] through fasting nowadays I can tell me
[1:34:34] yours in me you know and notice it said
[1:34:40] his soul Alma and see then the prayer
[1:34:48] returned in other words the spirit gave
[1:34:51] witness of God's Spirit in authority vo
[1:34:55] then recompense is speedy to the Neos
[1:34:57] our spirit bears witness with his spirit
[1:34:59] no it was pity to leave a car guard in
[1:35:01] the spirit to videos and that's how many
[1:35:04] times I know yes
[1:35:07] which I bet that you'll say what God
[1:35:09] wants me to preach as I'm studying
[1:35:14] Commerce to the end oh I'll feel the
[1:35:17] presence of the Lord
[1:35:18] yo siento la presencia your and I get a
[1:35:20] witness from God that this is truth
[1:35:26] but then I gotta check it by the word
[1:35:30] and then you receive it and don't you
[1:35:34] tell a receive it then you rejoice or
[1:35:37] then you repent just like we all do does
[1:35:44] that help by God's grace you know who
[1:35:47] wants God's hand upon them so I tell you
[1:35:52] that I don't want God to remove his hand
[1:35:54] from me no I don't want that no that
[1:35:56] mean
[1:35:57] because remember his hand is his
[1:35:59] protection okay sumon oh no I brought
[1:36:03] the handle and for him to remove that oh
[1:36:05] my now we're in trouble here
[1:36:07] where was the mana for vamos Italian
[1:36:09] problemas that means we gotta stay in
[1:36:12] step with the Holy Spirit's leading and
[1:36:18] and did he heal a cell espírito Santo
[1:36:22] praise God I want to read this quote
[1:36:27] about God will drive you to your gift
[1:36:32] Sita
[1:36:33] some of us back onto CeeLo as you
[1:36:36] soo-dong I'm not going to read all of it
[1:36:40] but it is scriptural at the beginning of
[1:36:44] this purpose series we showed through
[1:36:49] the scripture how God had a drive Paul
[1:36:53] to his ministry God had to drive Moses
[1:36:59] to his ministry God had to drive David
[1:37:06] to the ministry and so God will do the
[1:37:12] same for you so if you don't know your
[1:37:16] gifts God will take you there I can see
[1:37:23] that in my life
[1:37:26] in 2012 God started driving me into
[1:37:29] deeper teaching and then
[1:37:38] are the teaching YouTube ministry based
[1:37:46] upon that I wrote the modesty book now
[1:37:54] seven years later today I can see the
[1:38:00] fruits of that leading like on Labor Day
[1:38:05] weekend on that Friday morning I got a
[1:38:13] voicemail from California of a man that
[1:38:18] doesn't know the message but he found my
[1:38:22] book read it and he thanked me for
[1:38:27] writing it he said it took away all the
[1:38:32] confusion about modesty he said years of
[1:38:40] confusion he said his daughters would
[1:38:46] argue about the scripture and they dress
[1:38:52] immodestly but he said God used the gift
[1:38:59] to give him a Bible definition for
[1:39:02] modesty and he said what a gift to the
[1:39:08] body of Jesus Christ praise God but God
[1:39:15] had to drive me to that sure wasn't easy
[1:39:20] but brother Scott encouraged me he said
[1:39:22] every man has to do three things plant a
[1:39:30] tree write a book was the third one
[1:39:36] brother have a child okay
[1:39:39] plant a tree write a book and have a
[1:39:41] child plant a tree write a book have a
[1:39:48] child or have a baby
[1:39:51] [Laughter]
[1:39:54] that's a lot of wisdom see God had to
[1:39:59] drive me to that it wasn't easy neither
[1:40:07] will your ministry be easy God wants you
[1:40:12] to overcome in other words you've got
[1:40:17] tools to overcome that's prayer that's
[1:40:24] the word that's your gifts that's the
[1:40:28] body of Christ
[1:40:29] that's your brothers and sisters you
[1:40:33] have all these tools to overcome the
[1:40:37] gates of Hell hallelujah each one of us
[1:40:46] has a different ministry one works
[1:40:51] different each has a separate ministry
[1:40:59] all that comes in the CRO beautiful all
[1:41:02] that comes in the Christ has a ministry
[1:41:04] I forgot to highlight that one see you
[1:41:09] gotta get in Christ amen you gotta be
[1:41:13] born again all those in Christ have a
[1:41:17] ministry not only the preacher but you
[1:41:23] have a ministry something you can do
[1:41:27] amen
[1:41:29] let's say praise the Lord but usually
[1:41:36] God has to drive you into your correct
[1:41:42] ministry like a child child what doesn't
[1:41:49] want to do something you better Drive
[1:41:52] that job to do it
[1:41:55] right last year at school I'm a school
[1:42:03] teacher of six-year-olds two children
[1:42:11] miss their mother so much they didn't
[1:42:16] want to stay at school so the moms had
[1:42:20] to drive them physically into the room
[1:42:25] into my hands and then run down the
[1:42:30] hallway I guess I'm a pretty scary
[1:42:34] figure for a six-year-old but by the end
[1:42:41] of the year they're the ones hugging me
[1:42:44] and loving me separation anxiety is a
[1:42:49] reality sometimes you have to be driven
[1:42:54] into something and so let's recognize if
[1:43:03] God is driving us into something now for
[1:43:10] us at our church this is the way I feel
[1:43:14] this God is having me preach it again
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:20] and again and again and again to try to
[1:43:29] drive us to find our ministries it might
[1:43:35] not feel like a good thing but it's the
[1:43:40] will of God because I showed you the
[1:43:43] last quote or the quotes last week well
[1:43:48] the Brandon said it's just as essential
[1:43:54] that you are in your position in the
[1:43:59] house of God as the pastor hallelujah
[1:44:06] so be it hallelujah
[1:44:14] see we gotta find our position as you
[1:44:19] follow the Holy Ghost the signs will
[1:44:25] follow you look back at the signs and
[1:44:32] then you can see where you're where you
[1:44:34] been right well I
[1:44:40] whenever I Drive home from Toledo to
[1:44:42] Akron I pass the Lodi sign every time as
[1:44:53] I'm driving forward I can look in the
[1:44:59] rearview mirror and I see that I passed
[1:45:04] Lodi the same things happens in the
[1:45:08] spiritual I Drive past another here Li
[1:45:13] another healing brother William I just
[1:45:17] passed another healing that's where I've
[1:45:20] been that's following me that must be
[1:45:26] where God wants to use me praise God now
[1:45:30] that's what we got to do we got to see
[1:45:32] where God has taken us we have to look
[1:45:40] back at our lives honestly and see when
[1:45:45] was there a real time God anointed me to
[1:45:51] help other people praise God that's
[1:45:57] probably your ministry notice I said
[1:46:01] probably because God may use you one
[1:46:06] time for something and then never use
[1:46:10] you for that again praise God a man no
[1:46:19] they asked brother Branham should we
[1:46:20] seek we should we all come together and
[1:46:23] seek for our ministry fella BAM said no
[1:46:34] don't do that
[1:46:36] he said usually believers run from it
[1:46:49] you take a man that always says Lord
[1:46:51] I'll do this I'll do that God knows he'd
[1:46:58] be prideful or a stuffed shirt a stuffed
[1:47:10] shirt of prideful is prideful now this
[1:47:15] quote is used often and it should be but
[1:47:22] it's got to be balanced out - with other
[1:47:24] quotes like the one I read earlier about
[1:47:31] every one of you has a ministry and you
[1:47:36] need to be interested in your ministry
[1:47:41] now we cannot neglect our gifts so that
[1:47:48] quote cannot abolish what the scripture
[1:47:53] says so at the beginning of your walk
[1:48:00] with God
[1:48:04] you're not gonna pridefully try to find
[1:48:07] a gift
[1:48:11] you're gonna humbly wait on God until he
[1:48:16] shows you the gift after that it changes
[1:48:23] now you invest in that gift
[1:48:27] now you don't avoid it now you seek
[1:48:30] after it and that's a scripture once
[1:48:38] you're driven to it then you invest in
[1:48:42] it and you give yourself completely to
[1:48:45] it because that's Paul's advice to
[1:48:49] Timothy does that make sense now do we
[1:48:58] need to read that or is everybody
[1:49:00] familiar with that scripture
[1:49:01] great raise your hand if you want me to
[1:49:03] read that scripture seemed like
[1:49:05] everybody knows okay couple all right
[1:49:07] let's go okay first sir second Timothy
[1:49:09] three that's good I like I like honest
[1:49:15] people I like that now I was so ashamed
[1:49:17] in school I would never raised my hand I
[1:49:19] didn't want people to think I didn't
[1:49:20] know but now I'm like I don't care
[1:49:22] people know if I don't know I want to
[1:49:23] know
[1:49:24] lost my fears second Timothy three let
[1:49:33] me find the scripture here I may be in
[1:49:41] the wrong book I'm sorry I am in the
[1:49:44] wrong book first Timothy 4 forgive me
[1:49:52] verse 12
[1:49:54] first Timothy 4:12 sorry to see you have
[1:50:01] to balance William branham's quote with
[1:50:04] the word the quote is right and the word
[1:50:17] is right but you can't go overboard on
[1:50:20] the quote or else you'll never have a
[1:50:24] gift you'll never recognize your gift is
[1:50:28] ever understand that's why that quote
[1:50:30] can only work for so long people use it
[1:50:38] as a crutch we'll see I don't have to
[1:50:39] seek for God for a gift but we just saw
[1:50:47] how if you seek God God hand comes upon
[1:50:50] you and if God is ever gonna use - it's
[1:50:59] when his hand is upon you Amen that's
[1:51:07] right
[1:51:09] let no man despise thy youth but be thou
[1:51:12] an example of the believers in Word and
[1:51:14] conversation in charity in spirit
[1:51:15] in faith in purity see now same flow the
[1:51:21] Locrian test in palabra conductor amor
[1:51:25] espíritu fare till i come give
[1:51:29] attendance to reading to exhortation to
[1:51:31] doctrine like sorta see own Alliance
[1:51:37] agency I'm gonna read this wrong but
[1:51:41] does it say neglect the gift that's in
[1:51:44] thee cuz you're not old enough in the
[1:51:47] message no doesn't say that in fact he's
[1:51:51] talking to a young man who's fearful
[1:51:55] older they're not gonna respect me
[1:51:56] because I'm not old like Paul yes ignore
[1:51:59] the gift he said neglect not the gift
[1:52:03] that is in thee just read that one
[1:52:09] element a prophecy a con line position
[1:52:13] de las manos del verse 15 meditate upon
[1:52:16] these things give thyself wholly to them
[1:52:20] I almost said partly that thy profiting
[1:52:22] may appear to all see we're trying to
[1:52:31] emphasize this thought you can't ignore
[1:52:38] the gifts in your life you must also run
[1:52:43] from them you're supposed to run to God
[1:52:52] so he can help you handle that gift the
[1:52:58] church said that's a good Amen right
[1:53:01] there verse 16 take heed unto my unto
[1:53:06] thyself and unto the doctrine continue
[1:53:09] in them for in doing this thou shalt
[1:53:11] both save thyself and them that hear
[1:53:12] thee alright everyone understand now we
[1:53:26] just saw a quote our brother Graham said
[1:53:27] don't see good
[1:53:29] don't see gifts you'll be a stuffed
[1:53:30] shirt now let me give you a quote now
[1:53:33] this is the quote about Jerry Steffi
[1:53:46] Jerry Steffi but the brand didn't want
[1:53:51] him to waste his painting gift it's too
[1:53:59] bad to see a tail it
[1:54:00] that wouldn't be developed if God thinks
[1:54:09] that much about paints glory
[1:54:15] how much more about singing how much
[1:54:20] more about divine healing if he thinks
[1:54:25] that much about oil-based paints how
[1:54:32] about the Holy Ghost oil gift I'm just
[1:54:35] trying to say it somehow Amen if he
[1:54:39] cares so much of the natural oil what
[1:54:41] about the spiritual door there's a
[1:54:44] preacher in here somewhere
[1:54:45] there's a preacher
[1:54:53] so hard going slow today thankful here's
[1:55:05] a quote from 1954 where brother Branham
[1:55:12] says an evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:55:19] wanting to do something for God so you
[1:55:24] have to balance all these quotes with
[1:55:27] the word yes if you don't know your gift
[1:55:31] weight but if God shows you your gift
[1:55:37] don't wait invest in it and please
[1:55:43] my request is just my request please let
[1:55:45] the pastor know so I know your gift
[1:55:50] you've got a gift of praying and fasting
[1:55:55] yeah you know and someone is in bondage
[1:55:59] or addicted
[1:56:02] the Bible says praying and fasting
[1:56:04] breaks the chains do you believe that
[1:56:11] absolutely it does we prayed and fasted
[1:56:14] for Christopher years later he was
[1:56:22] healed of his seizures we prayed for
[1:56:33] Samuel who had cancer we fasted for him
[1:56:42] he was healed months later a lot faster
[1:56:47] in josé's a witness of that because
[1:56:49] those people are his family
[1:56:58] I'm skipping here I'll give you my
[1:57:01] estimation of what I think the closest
[1:57:03] thing to an evidence that a man is a
[1:57:06] Christian its travail of soul a person
[1:57:26] always hungry and thirsting for God day
[1:57:33] and night they can't stand it they gotta
[1:57:38] do something for God praise the Lord
[1:57:45] they're full of love and so travail all
[1:57:53] the time
[1:57:56] and now he goes into prayer and quotes
[1:58:02] the Book of Psalms he that sews and
[1:58:10] tears will return again rejoicing with
[1:58:13] precious sheaves praise the Lord so see
[1:58:24] we got to balance these quotes with the
[1:58:28] scripture I know I'm going long let me
[1:58:33] check my notes here okay
[1:58:40] yeah let me finish with this quote and
[1:58:41] then I'll get to this sheet and then
[1:58:42] we'll be done maybe you can about 15
[1:58:44] more minutes here if God would have
[1:58:51] asked me about a group of people
[1:59:02] if God would have asked me do you want
[1:59:05] all your church to shout I'll just kind
[1:59:06] of paraphrase it sure do you want them
[1:59:13] to all speak in tongues
[1:59:15] sure you want them all to dance in the
[1:59:18] spirit sure
[1:59:22] all right that's very good but what
[1:59:26] would you rather have them do hallelujah
[1:59:29] let me it let's be wrong we don't see a
[1:59:32] lot of this all the time in our church
[1:59:36] right and the church said and that's
[1:59:40] okay if it's not your gift
[1:59:41] don't try to impersonate it if you don't
[1:59:45] have victory and dance sometime you
[1:59:46] ought to get victory and dance it's
[1:59:47] glorious
[1:59:51] it's been a few weeks since I've done
[1:59:53] that but it's been glorious I'd rather
[1:59:58] have a church that had such a burn on
[2:00:00] their heart for prayer and just stayed
[2:00:09] at the altar day and night and in their
[2:00:17] house constantly in prayer humble trying
[2:00:22] to get people to come to God making
[2:00:29] phone calls in the hospital visiting the
[2:00:32] sick trying to get people to come to
[2:00:36] church and do right I'd rather have that
[2:00:43] and all the other put together amen
[2:00:47] it belongs in the church I'm sorry
[2:00:51] although the others right it belongs in
[2:00:54] the church praise the Lord now here's
[2:01:03] all yes I'd put prayer first because if
[2:01:08] you've got prayer all the other will
[2:01:12] take place amen
[2:01:15] and some people don't dance they don't
[2:01:17] pray enough and repent of their sins
[2:01:21] praise God you gotta pray you gotta talk
[2:01:26] to God amen if you've got that if you
[2:01:32] get so hungry for God shout it will take
[2:01:36] place amen
[2:01:38] we get so hungry for God speakin in
[2:01:43] tongues will take place if you got so
[2:01:48] hungry for God he said you'll keep
[2:01:55] hungry keep yourself right I guess keep
[2:01:58] yourself right but if you see yourself
[2:02:04] getting indifferent or disinterested I'm
[2:02:08] talking about prayer because no man
[2:02:12] would have rather Prayer than everything
[2:02:13] else if our church is not interested in
[2:02:19] prayer then we're probably not gonna see
[2:02:25] all the other things because if you do
[2:02:28] prayer the rest will come hallelujah
[2:02:39] if you see yourself getting
[2:02:41] disinterested
[2:02:42] you've got a different spirit stay right
[2:02:50] before God with humble with your veil of
[2:02:55] soul just be that good old-fashioned
[2:03:00] Holy Ghost field saying can I just hit
[2:03:06] right and the church said I'm trying to
[2:03:11] close bear with me I can prove by the
[2:03:13] Bible that's the first time the angel of
[2:03:18] God went over the lands to see what the
[2:03:23] Holy Ghost
[2:03:26] he only sighed
[2:03:28] I'm sorry only sealed those who cried
[2:03:33] inside for the abominations done in
[2:03:34] accra Ezekiel chapter 9 I want to ask
[2:03:46] you a question what would take place
[2:03:48] today if the Holy Ghost went through
[2:03:53] Jeffersonville Akron to seal those this
[2:04:01] afternoon who would be at home praying
[2:04:08] God send a revival just so hungry for a
[2:04:13] meeting
[2:04:14] Oh God look at the sins of the city
[2:04:19] isn't it terrible God won't you please
[2:04:23] send a revival God send some good
[2:04:27] preacher send someone where would the
[2:04:32] Holy Ghost seal think of that praise God
[2:04:41] who would he steal an Akron little
[2:04:45] bigger who'd he steal in Ohio that's a
[2:04:48] little bit bigger who would he steal in
[2:04:50] America who's that home sighing and
[2:04:53] crying saying God send a revival because
[2:04:56] that's what God did the first time all
[2:05:08] right I'm skipping that we'll get to
[2:05:11] that next time here's the nine gifts to
[2:05:13] the spirit and with a manky do me a
[2:05:16] favor give everybody one of these we'll
[2:05:20] just take about ten minutes
[2:05:22] well I only have 12 so give it to the
[2:05:26] Saints that usually come to Akron if we
[2:05:28] have leftovers we'll give it to the
[2:05:29] visitors but I don't know if they're
[2:05:30] leftovers well that's out of ink I just
[2:05:34] I need to order ink it just ran out
[2:05:36] recently I sorry my
[2:05:41] now I just want you to take a few
[2:05:43] minutes we're gonna invite the musicians
[2:05:45] up in just a moment I just want to have
[2:05:47] some music playing as music drives out
[2:05:49] demons multi Cobra marinade for the yah
[2:05:57] multi cover I'm gonna put a come on yeah
[2:06:00] and I'll have some pens ready in a
[2:06:03] little bit but just let me explain so I
[2:06:05] want to give some examples of the gifts
[2:06:06] of the Spirit now the brown ones are the
[2:06:17] ones we're probably not as familiar with
[2:06:22] the black ones are we're pretty familiar
[2:06:24] with now word of wisdom helps you make a
[2:06:35] decision to building a to build
[2:06:39] skillfully upon your life in the perfect
[2:06:41] I'll just say this helps you do the
[2:06:42] perfect will of God
[2:06:43] [Music]
[2:06:46] because the Bible said wisdom builds its
[2:06:49] house so a person will give you a word
[2:06:54] of wisdom and it will help direct your
[2:06:56] life now word of knowledge
[2:07:05] well Bram said his knowledge of the word
[2:07:09] you didn't know the Bible said that
[2:07:13] somebody brought it to your attention
[2:07:15] and now you know and knowing opens the
[2:07:19] door jesus said jesus said knowledge is
[2:07:25] the door of not or I'm sorry call it the
[2:07:26] key of knowledge and I'll give examples
[2:07:30] of these in a moment faith but man says
[2:07:34] you already know you got what you asked
[2:07:36] for
[2:07:39] you speak faith and you know what's
[2:07:41] going to happen gifts of healing can be
[2:07:46] instant healing I'm sorry gifts of
[2:07:47] healing take time to heal
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:52] miracles are something spontaneous and
[2:07:55] supernatural that happened instantly now
[2:08:01] prophecy for us will be in the form of
[2:08:03] dreams many times although it could come
[2:08:09] just as a thus saith the Lord prophecy
[2:08:14] now discerning means judging so the
[2:08:17] sermon judges spirits and the thoughts
[2:08:24] and intents of people's hearts and we
[2:08:30] know tongues are usually either tongues
[2:08:31] of men or tongues of angels an
[2:08:36] interpretation tells you what the tongue
[2:08:38] said okay now let me give some examples
[2:08:45] and then after this we'll take about 10
[2:08:46] minutes to write down I'm leaving you
[2:08:48] that space so you can write down some
[2:08:49] from your life just give me a couple if
[2:08:56] you got a lot then you've got lots of
[2:08:58] gifts so let me give a few my wife and I
[2:09:03] have two dreams that seem to be
[2:09:04] prophetic because they foretold what was
[2:09:07] going to happen we had dreams that were
[2:09:11] prophetic so Kristyn dreamed about a
[2:09:23] sister wearing pants
[2:09:30] in other words she'd be backslidden she
[2:09:42] laughed about it said it would never
[2:09:45] happen within a couple years that had
[2:09:48] happened so that was foretelling
[2:09:53] something that was a warning about
[2:09:54] something that's gonna happen she didn't
[2:09:58] heed the warning now she's been married
[2:10:01] and divorced and just her life is ruined
[2:10:04] I would hate a thousand philadelphia
[2:10:09] people I got it and laughs because she
[2:10:13] didn't obey the Bible and the church
[2:10:15] said I had a dream about a pastor
[2:10:19] son-in-law everybody said he had the
[2:10:27] Holy Ghost well I had a dream he was
[2:10:32] playing tennis in a woman's bikini kind
[2:10:35] of thing it was pink his wife is outside
[2:10:41] the tennis court watching him just
[2:10:43] having a good old time well I went told
[2:10:50] the brother about it I said the Lord has
[2:10:54] telling me this he didn't laugh it off
[2:10:57] but he shrugged it off and said no
[2:10:59] that's not gonna happen
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:05] years later they've left the message and
[2:11:12] they take pictures on facebook on their
[2:11:15] friends on Facebook playing tennis he's
[2:11:21] got his shirt off pair of short shorts
[2:11:24] on they weren't pink they were not pink
[2:11:32] but his wife's out there in short shorts
[2:11:37] playing tennis with him now you tell me
[2:11:42] was that foretelling the future or not
[2:11:46] because God always gives warning before
[2:11:49] judgment to me that's foretelling the
[2:11:58] future so if you're a dreamer
[2:12:04] make sure you pray out before you go to
[2:12:06] bed cuz Satan can't get in there I've
[2:12:11] had dreams that I didn't like and I
[2:12:12] rebuked him in Jesus Christ's name
[2:12:19] and honestly that's the only time it's
[2:12:21] ever been prophetic in my life second we
[2:12:31] had the Sermon through a dream with Amon
[2:12:33] and who about a year ago their dream was
[2:12:42] referencing wolves entering into the
[2:12:44] church and when they let me know that
[2:12:53] that same scripture I just preached on
[2:12:56] in text I was I was ministering on that
[2:12:59] same Scripture so their dreams and they
[2:13:01] had dreams of certain people like wolves
[2:13:04] attacking them and the church attacking
[2:13:07] them was just them yeah just you guys
[2:13:09] and I just had that scripture on my
[2:13:13] heart and I just shared it with my wife
[2:13:15] that actually that night I just shared
[2:13:18] it with my wife and I got a text from
[2:13:19] amen saying that Scripture came to his
[2:13:22] mind and it discerned the spirit in that
[2:13:45] conflict perfectly that spirit was
[2:13:52] trying to attack them and attack me it
[2:13:59] was trying to tell me what to preach
[2:14:03] praise God and there was some more
[2:14:06] details on that I told you about it
[2:14:08] later or last year but see that judge
[2:14:13] what spirit was attacking them and me it
[2:14:17] judged now the good thing is one of them
[2:14:21] came back to repent that's the good
[2:14:24] thing
[2:14:27] see so that's another vindication
[2:14:31] repenting of that wrong spirit as they
[2:14:36] get the wisdom I was talking to a pastor
[2:14:42] who was accused of being a failure as a
[2:14:44] father
[2:14:50] all because he led his boys play
[2:14:52] basketball I felt the Bruns of God come
[2:14:58] upon me I'm just on the phone I start
[2:15:03] quoting quotes from brother Branham in
[2:15:04] scriptures like a Russian river coming
[2:15:06] out of my mouth and showing the balance
[2:15:15] with sports the brother rejoiced on the
[2:15:22] phone and said that was a gift of wisdom
[2:15:25] I didn't say it he said it praise God
[2:15:32] and it set him free from that
[2:15:34] condemnation praise the Lord directing
[2:15:41] his life because we'll wisdom builds the
[2:15:44] house knowledge I heard preached first
[2:15:55] Corinthians 6:12 and the Bible said you
[2:16:02] should not be brought under the power of
[2:16:04] anything when I read that scripture my
[2:16:11] heart was set on fire I posted that
[2:16:17] scripture in my room up on the wall I
[2:16:22] started quoting that scripture every
[2:16:24] time I had a tobacco addiction or
[2:16:26] pornography addiction or whatever it was
[2:16:28] I started quoting that scripture the
[2:16:36] beautiful thing was I don't even know
[2:16:37] what's in the Word of God
[2:16:41] but once I had knowledge of that the key
[2:16:47] of knowledge opened the door of
[2:16:48] deliverance and that's the first sermon
[2:16:55] I preached in January 2004 was on
[2:16:57] addictions praise God
[2:17:04] another one on knowledge a preacher
[2:17:09] called me and said he was being accused
[2:17:13] that he should have preached and be a
[2:17:15] deacon I told him I pray for him
[2:17:26] I just felt led to share with my wife so
[2:17:31] my wife shares a scripture that Philip
[2:17:32] was both a deacon and a preacher
[2:17:34] evangelist share it called the brother
[2:17:43] back he started crying on the phone and
[2:17:51] he's still preaching this day see that's
[2:17:54] knowledge of the Lord that's what the
[2:17:57] gift is for so God used my wife with the
[2:18:01] gift of knowledge she wasn't Janette me
[2:18:07] she was just sharing what the scripture
[2:18:09] says okay last one I don't have up here
[2:18:16] but tongues interpretation in 2010
[2:18:24] Steven Kressel gave a tongue and
[2:18:29] interpretation at our church I was
[2:18:35] preaching in Columbus but they recorded
[2:18:39] it being recorded it and after the
[2:18:43] interpretation came it said why would
[2:18:48] you die you need to be revived
[2:18:56] Davida so I went and asked everybody in
[2:18:58] the church I went to ask everyone in the
[2:19:02] church who felt like they were
[2:19:06] spiritually dying three people told me
[2:19:11] they did see the Bible said try every
[2:19:16] spirit that's the only time in our
[2:19:22] church's history that we've had an
[2:19:25] unknown tongue interpretation and it was
[2:19:29] right on nine years ago praise God now
[2:19:38] at the bottom those are just ministries
[2:19:39] I'm not gonna go over those I've tried
[2:19:41] to divide a male and female this is a
[2:19:43] growing list I'll keep building this men
[2:19:45] can preach deacons prophesy with all
[2:19:47] nine gifts they can labor in prayer
[2:19:49] which we just saw program said I'd
[2:19:50] rather have prayer a ministry of prayer
[2:19:52] than any other ministry testifying in
[2:19:56] evangelism the Shepherd's they weren't
[2:19:57] preachers but they could testify what
[2:19:59] God had showed them music and dance
[2:20:01] that's what we course our music ministry
[2:20:02] with Malik I'm brother amen females can
[2:20:06] prophesy of all nine gifts of the Holy
[2:20:08] Spirit prayer and fasting Anna had the
[2:20:10] ministry the Bible said she served God
[2:20:12] at the temple of God with the Ministry
[2:20:14] of prayer and fasting alms deeds and
[2:20:18] clothing for the poor Tabitha did that
[2:20:20] in Acts chapter 9 laboring in the gospel
[2:20:23] ministry traveling with and financially
[2:20:25] supporting preachers was a ministry of
[2:20:27] the sisters like Susannah and Mary
[2:20:28] Magdalene they just traveled with them
[2:20:30] and supported their ministry with money
[2:20:33] testifying and evangelism Anna testified
[2:20:36] to everybody about Jesus being born the
[2:20:39] woman at the well testified to everybody
[2:20:40] that Jesus Christ discerned her life
[2:20:42] Priscilla testified with her husband
[2:20:46] Aquila to Apollo's so she just testified
[2:20:49] that the Holy Ghost was real remember he
[2:20:51] didn't know about the Holy Ghost he knew
[2:20:53] about baptism and sanctification but
[2:20:55] didn't know about the Holy Ghost so she
[2:20:57] was there as a witness the Holy Ghost is
[2:20:58] real I'm full of it that's a real
[2:21:01] testimony right there and music and
[2:21:03] dance in the women

[2:21:10] hand or you you can pray let's just pray
[2:21:12] for about 10 minutes and ask the Lord if
[2:21:14] you'd remind us of any ways where you've
[2:21:17] been used in a gift or of someone else
[2:21:20] in the church you've seen some of these
[2:21:21] gifts I tried to list some like I said
[2:21:24] they don't happen all the time I know
[2:21:25] there's more than that you know those
[2:21:27] are the ones
[2:21:27] yesterday I was that came to my mind as

[2:22:47] person I gave that person that word they
[2:22:51] didn't even know it in a set of free
[2:22:54] maybe God will give you wisdom see where
[2:22:58] God used a church that gives you an idea
[2:23:01] where you may use for the future the RAM
[2:23:03] even said God doesn't take dystrophy
[2:23:05] look it up if God gave you a gift he's
[2:23:10] not gonna take it from that made you

[2:26:31] house of God as the pastor or something
[2:26:34] or Deacon or trustee as you getting its
[2:26:37] position right in the house of God and
[2:26:42] Lord hoping that everyone would be so
[2:26:44] hungry to pray and realize it's a great
[2:26:48] evidence of a Christian to perm to

[2:26:52] do something for God we have ladies on
