amen you may be seated into our place hey man I believe this is a time for the bride of Jesus Christ to come into our place amen brother Branham told us we are living below our means again I believe it's time for the bride of Jesus Christ not to be living down here earthbound any longer but it's time for us to come into the heavenlies a man it's time for us a raise above the things of the world and coming to what God truly has forced the fullness of the word it's our saints of God it's time we don't hold back and we get into our place that God has given us amen if you look at these scriptures here in verse 14 in whom we have redemption through the blood in the only way that we'll get into our place is we must come through the blood a man Christ went to his place a man he shed on the cross of Calvary he said it's finished he went to the place of giving his all saints of God but what about you and I he left the example and he went to his place that you're not through the same blood could come into that place things of God between me that I might become here manna lujah teacher God you are Jesus Christ - the same time you are the light of the world amen there's the position that you must come to and it's yours tonight just step into the grace of God amen what is the blood represent how do you get to this place it's only by the grace of God and by the life of Jesus Christ coming into your life rebuking the things in your life they aren't supposed to be there that's not their place the life of Jesus comes in maybe does not stop and he keeps who are you and you how many thankful for that how these thankful that God still working on me you might be 20 30 40 years you might have made all kinds of mistakes but the grace of God still pulls you to your place you might have given up on you but God says to that keep on coming your place is here this is the bonus of the word you are the bride of Jesus Christ overcome layer to see you do not care what the world says my word says you'll overcome this is the place of overcomers I don't know it's not a place of defeated you might have been defeated when you walked through that door but you're not going out the same you're coming into God heavenly places in Christ Jesus I believe the word has that kind of effect that you can lead different than what you can you know you might have been struggling with cancer when you moved in here you might not even know you have cancer but the Word of God the supernatural word can change things you might be healed of cancer and never knew you might have been healed multiple times and never even notice why because you did not forsake coluan to come into your place the house of God in the Word of God works don't you love it tonight hallelujah amen so it says in the scripture it's do that not saints of God it's always through the blood if you do not come to the blood you have no place with him hallelujah there was a message set forth by Moses wasn't a message saying kill the lamb take the book you know what if they did not do that they weren't in a position to be saved amen you must have that modify you must have the token of the Holy Ghost saints of God amen what is the hope so what does the Holy Ghost do lead you and guide you into your place hey man what is it all truth needs you and guide you into all truth how many one side you've learned more hey if you haven't learned more I say you need to come to an altar tonight I'm not talking here I'm talking about revelation you should pay growling ISIL or you're not going say some blunders for notes or tonight get back in that ship and glory because that almond tree that was once dead begin to grow again hallelujah ladies the Lord will say this to forgive one another yes sir because if you don't forgive the Bible plainly says you don't have forgiveness yes sir no grudges are gonna go to heaven face of God sometimes you are your own worst hindrance but saints of God in this presence when the light begins to shine into the darkness don't stay in that place any longer then come up higher into the glory of norm praise the home baby what is here he says that he might have preeminence Saints oh god the only way will come up higher the only way we'll be into our place is we make sure we put him in his place he must be first place first above your wife above your children above your job I love your finances above anything it must be Jesus first please Lord it's the time we get there the devil would like to you know how it works we all fight the same battle the saints of God no my god first my god his first Haman and his word is first this word must have preeminence you know you don't accept anything that's contrary to this word you don't have to yes when those rattlesnakes come to the door yeah come on in to my place no let's send those round sticks how do I do it put them at will it says in the word right here I'm not very smart and I don't know very much but I know what this word says I can't make this work to come to pass but there's one who can if I stand on his word that place will come in to me and I will be free he will know somebody morning as a savior right they want to be saved they want to feel alright they won't know they're not going to hear so many wanted Mazar here so many wanted miss candy and just want to feel better praise the Lord rain falls on the just and unjust alike they feel better after leaf yes well we're not talking about the unjust tonight before talking about the ones that have coming to their place we're talking about the saints of God that come on a Saturday night Jesus Christ you have not been sanctified this is the time you have not received the Holy Ghost this is the tiny food easily read this is that time praise the Lord you know what you come into your place put the devil in his you know his place is let me show you right there those demons that gate kind of telling you you're not ride you're not this you're not that have you ever gave them those to Jesus you just keeping this to him pray so give up to Jesus Lord your word says I ain't got time for these ain't got time for you devil God's word study one percent me I'm not presenting myself he's bringing me this place praise the Lord somebody want him as a healer a savior I'll feel good God but what about a ruler what about a king what about a lover ooh there's where God has to be a man do we fall short sometimes yes we do but that's why there's the blood because he knew when you fell short and you got out of your place you could scream out for forgiveness and right back up put it somewhere else it's gotta be in this place amen enjoy place so what does this bring this brings subjection husband and wife your husband's wives have their place I'll sit down aim it back to you it's true husbands and white have their place right amen saints of God your husband should be led of God you should be praying over the decisions you may not have have something going about hey man you have a right to did you have a responsibility to discipline the blue children but if you do it anger you're not doing it right you're out of your place I'm glad God doesn't just put me in anger he's our example yes praise the Lord you love me baby no nowhere that's run the praise the Lord anyway yes well the man have you ever done that have you ever discipline your children anger yes I had did I go to him to ask forgiveness yes I did I want them to know dad he's human and he needs the blood just so much today their daddy makes mistakes hey man but I know where to go to get back in my place and it's on my knees before my maker it's on my knees the one that called me no one that purified me the one that changed me the one that's polling mean the one that's calling me to this position take to go I think we missed that place a lot but say to God our prayer closets should be where we're at I don't care if it's a way we're loving I'll care who is you get to praying before God you watch the Holy Ghost go and bring them into their position his promises are real they're not just something you have has we throw around but it's something you believe that God said it I believe it his word can I said by the man I don't feel that way cast your feelings aside God's Word said it I believe in word can I like Superman I just keep saying the word keep saying the word keep saying what the man said one place he said even if you don't believe it keep confessing the word until your body does oh yeah hmm it says this is a mystery brother Graham said this and think he makes children he said this is a mystery now the woman should be in respects to heaven husband even the second place I believe the entire Bower the reverence was spoke up to said the woman seeing the revit she reverence her husband reverence her husband then her husband all these sisters although where's his brother going that seat on brother Jesse no listen now then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife that is why what resident reverence him as a son hallelujah you know the devil would like to break this unity at home anyway husbands make mistakes I will sit down and say you middleman husbands make mistakes they say that forgiveness that you come back to again and you pray about it together hey you got to have that unity together in the home amen you're sure children see that example they see that example let the example be of one of holiness hey man Amen if we fall short of it know that the blood of Jesus Christ still brings us back in wrong place there's grace tonight but I'm dependent on bracelet sisters brothers sisters I make so many mistakes I feel so sure I'm dependent on the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ he that began a good work in me he's faithful to complete what is completion to bring me into the place that he saw me before the foundation of the world to bring me hey listen uh this is farther down the quote he says just like what does a man a woman every time she get marry she puts her veil over her face she's coming to her husband the head just like Rebecca did she has a veil over her face to meet Isaac she has no more head Isaac's her head and the church ought to be so submissive now so submissive to the Word of God that it fails its own face it doesn't want its rights anymore this is our place it's right right lord help us to get there I believe a lot of us had this desire but we struggling to get there the saints of God that's not what he's called you to do he's not called you to struggle in the get there he struggled you to quote his promises and walk right on into my you know we're looking like oh I know but it's a skinny day by day by day oh the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord trust the voice that's talking to you the voice isn't gonna lead you wrong man why cuz the voices if less the voices not according to this word now I never be so close to deceive the very elect amen but there's a voice that always coincides with this word and my sheep hear my and another though why because where they follow - they're followed to the place that God intended for them to be the bride of Jesus Christ ready waiting for rapture full power full the supernatural yes Amen the supernaturals real sights of God amen we should shoot me something that's foreign to us to see the supernatural move how do you say that read the book of Acts that's right what are we supposed to rewrite the look of X was a supernatural an operation absolutely yes well that was only that was only apostles no that was every one of them what was Stephen I love Steve I preached on Stephen II reason that's King get out of it Stephen wasn't an apostle right but he's very life matched the word look at it go back and read it starting in chapter 6 of Acts go back and read it what did he do he was full of the Holy Ghost signs and wonders was following him and he they lied on him made false witness of him I persecuted him and what did he say at the very end the whole scripture the worst chapter 7 he took them and revealed to them Jesus up to that point amen and then he said Father forgive them exactly matching the word that's the place of eternally thanks of God we should accept anything less than that we should match the Word of God line upon line I can't do that you're right you can't do that but they're greater is he that is within me oh he's so undoing it yield yourself to the voice of God yield yourself to the Word of God yields your time for the Spirit of God for Supernatural change you yes what is it I was reading this today that veil what does he do that government of the shoulder here in the church age book there he says when the bride is seen community gu2 committed to the groom there's a lot of halfway committal around this message of the hour we're just going to spray track now there's a lot of halfway Camille's they know about the Prophet they know they can't get away but they haven't really given their all to God praise the Lord saints of God coming to your position there's such freedom there's such Liberty there suit beauty such beauty raise the Lord commit it to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she's transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and the care and he alone no one else nor the man no other power has any right and responsibility oh he wants to do their hey man hey man you say you know girl that I've done that once but man I'm talking less the everyday experience amen let's clearly commit it to God hey man you got problems I commit them to God I'll give it my life to you I'm searching the best I know how god I failed the Lord I'm coming harder I'm gonna give it more give it my all even there's a humbling that needs to be done in this giving Christ his position and when there's a dying up to self that needs to happen a little bit more yes yes brother Matt's praying that he dies out a little bit more yes I believe John the Baptist did the same thing I must decrease our thoughts our desires our once we still got them and we need to die out a little bit more amen there's more I'm expecting the same things that happen in the book of Acts to be flowing from our churches no going to any person I'm talking in a little group here yes little group here hey Kyle loves I love this church this is this is right home hey this is even why I just do I don't know I can't help it I love it yeah why because you truly want you just want it you want God to move I don't want to play Church I don't know about you I don't want to play Church I don't want to be a make-believe I would be a fake believer I marry you believe a lot of times we come from a humble humble beginning but sometimes we get a little handy and high-minded how do you know that brother Matt look your brother Saul King Saul yeah he was a humble being read back through it he was hiding amongst the stuff when they when they called him out he was hiding from his position I believe it's a First Samuel 11 I was looking a lot but I was in there in that in that very moment right there he won his first victory and when he won his first big tree there were ones that didn't want salt to be king hey man they didn't want him to be king so they made they said we don't want him to be king but when he won his first victory the others called out said let's kill him and soul today there'll be no killing today because salvation let's come to the house of the Lord that was Saul but look worse all got to the place because he forgot where he came from st. Oh God don't forget the place you come from hey babe don't forget your God is watching Maybank no forgetful Laurie don't forget the graces step down wonder how many thankful to that a man I wish sometimes we get a revival just start right there hey David did to restore to me we must put Christ in his place he must have the preeminence the three full purpose of God is what what is the three cool person of God he says first to express ourselves completely God in Christ second is where we're at right now second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express express himself through them thanks to God he wants people that he can express through listen nobody can take your place nobody can take your place your place is just is wonderful as anybody else's place yes it is no brother Brian oh my I'm not saying about that one one one our Father but without you he went to preach the way he did a man if he didn't have anybody to receive it but there was somebody to receive that message why because that same person that received that message fed on that message and it changed them from glory to glory into the image that they reflected exactly what the Bible says I don't know yeah Lord be it unto me how many just say be it unto me can I be it unto me Lord according to thy word hey man Mary didn't know how it was gonna happen but she accepted she accepted God's Word and God's the one that brought it to pass but she must accept God's Word when God speaks to you respond you know brother Matt might say one thing but the Spirit of God might say something deeper in your heart the you and your you am not alone going to the knows who did that was that brother Matt no that's the president of Almighty God coming down at you because maybe you've got now to your place done something wrong but God loves you so much that he comes down and says listen you aren't naked I'm showing you now getting under the blood get it under the body get it under the blood that's the love of God how do you know that brother Matt it's a grace of God that leadeth you to repentance which is your place you love me man hey we must put Christ in his place and every believer we must suffer Christ in his place he must be first in our lives the very first scripture that came alive as he was sick he first the kingdom of God and I'll add all these things up to you he has not failed have I failed time and time again but he reminds me of it thank the Lord for his long-suffering brother BAM said this he said God in these last days when he gets the preeminence as' preeminence in the church the position his place in the church how many say just be it unto me Lord put a little boy down a little bit oh boy you know this old flesh we like to protect him in his position all right brother we're getting his comfort zone a little bit too tonight amen let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 32 how many loves the word yes amen dinner on me chapter 32 appreciate the liberty tonight any memory appreciate the Liberty to hold you long got a lot here MA amen I know brother Jesse can preach a long time we're good that's right you guys are seasoned his wife rolls her eyes amen you don't owe me chapter 32 verse 11 it says as an eagle stirreth up earnest and flutters over young spreadeth abroad her wings and taketh them embarrassin all girl ain't ya what is this eagle doing why would the eagle do this yes because she wants the Eagle to come to its place I saw this today let me let me get to him right here says she decides that her babies will not walk like chickens so she watches them until they fully feather out she watches over them then one day she it's time to change position it's time to change time it's time to the Lord

late God is right on time you know the problem with us a lot of times we're time teams it doesn't happen now remember God's eternal yes he's right on time and he's not in a hurry right they took 40 years to work on Moses how long will take on you to get a new one one minute of work the saints of God that one minute work nobody else can take your place nobody else what did she do nothing ever recorded about her she got the place ready already you might be the one that preys but you might be the woman yes sir yes sir the by my shoulder joint is out of joint I don't work right but when this body comes in this place it even this well would she bother some prayer yes a man praise God maybe you see your brother or sisters down how many there you know praising God giving their little part a beautiful body it's moving into instead I'm saying hey-ya or so listen no so these flutters over the room so it's big angle the vamps at one place is 14 wing walking foot wingspan I could be wrong here but he's big wheeze yes sir I'm brother man I got a long time six foot seven this before but this eagle comes over this this butter to give you think of it's bird it's like it gets uncomfortable I'm gonna never send the service and that pretty walk down into your few and begins to blow all over you he doesn't know you from Adam he don't know who you are but he walks right down into your Pew who is that that's the Holy Ghost the wind of the Holy Ghost hallelujah that wind of the Holy Ghost you know what it begins to do maybe almost something goes alright this equals better even stuck in this yes yes so the evil begins to realize why does the Eagle do this because she sees the true potential in the limit she knows the little eagle is built just like she is how do you she knows something illegal in do exactly what she does the work should I do you do oh it's high up here I don't know I'm here to tell you if Papa God knows if that spirit come he's ever had happened in church mother Jessica on a subject man and he just won't get off of it just won't get off oh he just stepped all over your toes I've said this before you with some steps on your toes you better dude if you don't move you might be dead [Music] you ever have somebody step on your toes yeah those steps on your toes if the wind comes home and blows you that winds me notice an eagle dude it learns to mounted sweet it doesn't flop no mmm praise this is why why does the mother say I don't like the bit better your saints of God sometimes that comes that way because there's a besetting sins sitting in our life there's things in our life that we should not be doing we know better than do and we still hold on to amen praise the Lord but Matt included amen you don't look at this man up here like he's something big special yeah they're their position they have a place but they're walking the same walk you do they've been sometimes they're struggling just as hard as you do and still have to stand up here behind the pulpit and give everything they've got to God they don't feel like I don't want to amen but the Holy Spirit comes down the anointing comes down and then God just takes over the saints of God he's blowing applause he's saying these feathers will not take you interruption these feathers will harm you from playing sometimes we're so earthbound yeah when we were when we were in school I came up with these things in parachutes and you ran with a parachute on it well they put away the best on you jumped that it was harder to run that parachute right but I tell you when you got that person off you felt light is a bit when you got that weight off yeah he felt light as a feather and God sends the Holy Ghost down when he blows on you and you say know what I'm sorry and God blows things out of your life that's why we don't per se yeah even so much more than a approaches why because there's more oppression coming tables coming right things we got a fight but yours are safe in this is our comfort zone by the time the song service over the word says Amen and the preacher big news to come something change amen yes Laurie spreadeth abroad or wings so the single think about this the seagull stands over that's good isn't it good to have an eagle prophet come with me of Jesus Christ from revelations Amen of the wings of the old and new Testament the wings weren't here were abroad yeah you know I think it's in songs that Doug David talks about feathers all those fenders that every one of those scriptures you know an eagle they can't pry those about it good the pliers there's some patent when you see the revelation of who he is and how big he is and how much he cares you I don't know if it does some of you but it puts me in comfort to know my God's got everything under control oh my god soft bit the David fell amen because he knew I needed to see somebody that wasn't perfect he's all fit I saw Jacob and a grace yes amen he saw that there were things in the scriptures that gave me encouragement they even though I'm so short my god still is better he knew I needed a new idea to think he's covered he knew I need a transgression discovered he knew I needed healing so my god already provided it when he said it is finished it was finished hallelujah you love me he beareth them on the wings the brother n tells the story about this he says the eagle there's a great storm coming the ones the little eaglets are down on the grass and blade and their mama I think it's a great Norman was coming about that time mama said that's enough I believe God is about ready to say that's enough and those little Eagles take their mouth and put a word you know so lips today they didn't grab their talents but the word was where in their mouth and when you begin to speak the word it will take you up higher thanks for going speak the word yeah spit why cry maybe filter through the Bible yes even though I daughters in this this is what the spirit let me do who you gods right on time yeah sorry about that I didn't get anything from the word yes yes we're not of those that are we driving this evil wants this maturity to come please hallelujah his children yeah it's time for maturity yes Papa God says it's time for the children glory it's time for you to company evolution it's calling for you to come into your place Oh Lord how many's not satisfied with just a little bit brother branham one program said he is I'm filled with the Holy Ghost that's good enough he said no brother man lastly Muricy yes hey man let me get raised the Lord you love him yeah there it is since I got the ambition to move on out to meet him uh I receive your Holy Ghost that settled it it didn't with me I'm just look just still taking it and moving higher and higher takes a guard our position is not to just be satisfied with a little bit keep going higher and higher and higher until this world doesn't see us you know would you think sheesh I needed I'm thankful walkins I got for my god - yes ask you Lord you know sometimes and I found this here recently sometimes we walk the dog said anything and don't talk to God about this your show chain though yes yes check it

wings oh I love this here I mean two more quotes here come on we'll move on hmm I'm normally not this long-winded that's my kids amen normally good amen he says now it's a very curious thing that she does she goes inge it's Emma's hi there's little Leo's there's not murmuring a little bit they got their little bit be set in the feathers if you're Mervin murmur it a little bit you haven't got your beak set in the feathers just right go looking for where to set your beak in set your beak and begin confessing what the Word of God says even though there's no manifestation in your life that's what Mary did is it not yes that's what Mary did she said I'm pregnant I'm pregnant and God for the supernatural brought her body right into her confession she knew what was happening on the inside I'm the bride I'm part of the bride of Jesus Christ yeah I'm don't take anything less it's a man let me some fish babam in Hebrews 6 and one says let us go I do perfection what is perfection maturity yes or maturity Hebrews 5:11 says be not dull of hearing thanks I'm going the way that we mature is getting into the spirit we must hear what the Spirit says we must walk in the spirit must live by the spirit we must pray in the spirit we must sing in the spirit how much should we be in the spirit especially right now because the sun's coming water then it's ever coming what does the Sun do the Sun at this time right now July August you see that that that crop coming up almost to the full height but from now on the Sun comes hot why because it's changing it's bringing that corn into full maturity how much more do we need listen hey yes I'm talking let's get down to business with God tune out things in the world turn on our problems and get a channel right with God give you the Son of God you know that son of God does it change it tomato from green bread how does he do it but man I'm sure it just doesn't quit trying to make it happen open yourself up and who brings it to maturity he does who's gonna present this bride yes yes your loving hey Peter says this is new one of the plagues desire the sincere milk of the word if they may grow thereby there must be a maturation there must be a growing he also spall said this is when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things it's time for us to the church dressed mature yes anything what is maturity bring into our perfection you know so many times I thought when we were perfect you know what I'm perfect everything I'm gonna speak the word it's gonna happen you know we near it perfection look at it and by Moses what was he a perfection he couldn't do anything yeah how do we get perfecting yourself yes amen how many would agree with me there's something yes sir yes sir y'all we all you know in different ways maybe it's like physical spiritual thought right battle yeah they're going through something but you know that's how God the church if you do not suffer you will not win think about David how many never you might need this place right now think about David running from soul thinking what did I do wrong how many stopped this why am I going through this sure sure what did I do wrong right David had to go through that 42 the way he had to go through suffering before he was fit to be Mackey gives a different perspective to where you're at right now doesn't it you think God isn't working on you I was telling brother Jesse right now just a few minutes ago about Moses Moses when he came to the backside of the desert they just said he went to the backside desert and then 40 years later this happened look at God work on Moses because by the time God came to him in a burning bush Moses had a speech impediment Moses had seven weaknesses brother branham said all right he knew human weakness I can't do it I have no message I have no eloquence I have all these things but right there he was at perfection in the sign of God yeah how many feels like you're weaker than you've ever been baby you're getting right on time for god yes coming into full maturity you're covering the place the Holy Ghost gonna take possession and move through you ain't that you're loving a man's musicians come hey it's time saints of God would come into our place you know Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 it talks about the fivefold ministry let me just read through these scriptures here and he gave some apostles and some prophets some evangelists some pastors and some teachers we need all what's it for for the perfecting of the Saints without a fivefold ministry according to the Bible there's no perfecting how many once at all pray for pray for your pastor pray for the teacher pray for the evangelist pray for him because they go out and they do work you know what it's doing it's bringing your brothers and sisters it's bringing the body into the perfection that we take a rapture no bigger than anybody else they're called to serve amen that's what they're called to do but by they're serving God works and brings his bride into maturity for the works of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Jesus Christ listen till we all come in unity of the faith this is our position and of the knowledge of the sun-god until a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now we henceforth be not children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness II but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
