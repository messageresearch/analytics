[20:10] let's turn tonight to first Timothy a
[20:14] man the book first Timothy first Timothy
[20:21] the Lord helping us oh I forgot about to
[20:24] hook and put it right there Chris long
[20:27] amen
[20:31] 5:24 chapter 5 verse 24 first Timothy
[20:36] chapter 5 verse 24 well speak to you
[20:39] tonight on the reason the bride doesn't
[20:43] go through judgment I mean we got
[20:46] everybody repented this morning now
[20:47] we're going to show you the benefit of
[20:49] it amen amen I think I think I am going
[20:53] I'm done with that repent repent but I
[20:55] think I think I got her in there today I
[20:57] think so brother Jesse I was thinking
[21:00] would you said that I had forgotten
[21:02] about that little remark you know when
[21:03] he talked about him
[21:04] they said one time a preacher I think it
[21:07] was moody or one of them said he had
[21:09] such a strong voice and they went
[21:11] intestine ku sticks one day and he
[21:12] hollered repent the guy fell on his face
[21:14] I did the technician oh god help me Lord
[21:16] you know
[21:17] I said well I I said you know III I
[21:20] don't know that we had so much of that
[21:22] this morning but I think everybody was
[21:24] able to do a little adjustment here Amen
[21:26] in their self you know it's some
[21:28] difference a wonderful thing actually
[21:30] whenever you're saved and you've got the
[21:32] Holy Ghost or you're saved at least and
[21:34] you're trying to seek on to greater
[21:36] parts of God and greater depths of God
[21:38] it's a wonderful thing not to have to
[21:40] get into that part of it you know to
[21:42] know that all that's behind you now and
[21:44] you're not really so much as even trying
[21:46] to cry out to God to be a Christian oh
[21:49] I'm a sinner you know it's just as a
[21:50] peaceful feeling to know that really for
[21:52] us now is just a matter of little
[21:54] adjustments along the way you know and
[21:56] he talked about us wearing a white dress
[21:58] and everything and it's nice to know
[22:00] that all we have to do is just put a
[22:02] little detergent on it and clean it up
[22:03] every now and then amen we've done got
[22:05] past the hard stuff we're now in the in
[22:07] the easy journey now a lot of people say
[22:09] that this ain't the easy part maybe not
[22:11] but the difference between being a
[22:13] sinner and being this I think this is
[22:15] the easier part of it myself amen first
[22:18] Timothy chapter 5 verse 24 now let's
[22:20] look just a little while at some things
[22:23] here and I'm gonna deal with the white
[22:25] throne judgment I touched it just a
[22:26] little bit today but I'm gonna kindly
[22:28] drop into it tonight the Lord helping us
[22:30] and I know that God will be with us and
[22:33] everything we try to accomplish because
[22:35] he promised he would be here even right
[22:37] here tonight
[22:37] amen don't you believe that lo you are
[22:40] all right two verses and we're gonna let
[22:42] you be seated some men's sins are open
[22:45] beforehand going before to judgment some
[22:49] men they follow after likewise also the
[22:53] good works of some are manifest
[22:56] beforehand and they that are otherwise
[22:59] in other words the negative or the bad
[23:01] or the evil cannot be hid so in other
[23:04] words what he's saying here is that it
[23:06] doesn't really matter whether you've got
[23:08] good works or bad works it's going to
[23:09] show itself eventually at some point in
[23:12] some place and what you're doing it's
[23:14] absolutely going to be manifest what you
[23:17] are if you're a Christian a real genuine
[23:18] Christian and your works will reflect
[23:21] that very thing if you are otherwise it
[23:24] will be reflected as well and that's why
[23:26] it's important for us to know while
[23:27] we've got an opportunity whether we've
[23:29] got eternal life in our hearts
[23:31] because if we don't we're missing the
[23:33] most the best opportunity than what
[23:36] we've got of what we've got here in this
[23:38] day to get right because how does the
[23:40] Bible say now
[23:42] today right this moment is the day the
[23:44] time or the hour of salvation
[23:46] call on the Lord while it can be found
[23:48] of you because there is coming a time
[23:49] where we won't be able to find him as
[23:51] far as Gentile people and what more
[23:53] they'll call on him and so forth and he
[23:55] he won't be won't be there for him in
[23:57] that way
[23:57] now we read this one more time son men's
[24:01] sins are open beforehand going before to
[24:05] judgment some follow after all right
[24:08] let's pray over the word Lord Jesus
[24:10] thank you for the word now we pray that
[24:12] you'll speak to us give us your favor
[24:14] and your grace and your mercy as we
[24:15] commit the service now both speaker and
[24:17] listener in Jesus name Amen god bless
[24:20] you may be seated may the Lord bless you
[24:22] real good
[24:22] now I'm kindly excited about bringing
[24:26] this to you tonight because when I hit
[24:28] this a little bit this morning I felt
[24:30] that little zing zing and I like it when
[24:32] I feel that I know it's the right
[24:33] channel I know it's what we're supposed
[24:35] to talk about and you know as I said to
[24:38] you this morning if you use your own
[24:39] mind and your own thoughts sometimes
[24:41] when you're trying to put things
[24:42] together you can really make a mess out
[24:44] of it if you're trying to use your own
[24:45] thoughts but God knows exactly what all
[24:48] of us need and knows the avenues that
[24:50] need to be taken he knows the little
[24:52] steps and what more that needs to be
[24:54] taken as far as where you are in your
[24:58] walk with Him where at what stage you
[25:00] might be in or what placement you might
[25:01] be in or situation or circumstances you
[25:05] might be facing everyone it might be
[25:06] God's mindful of all of it and what I
[25:09] love about him is that he can come in
[25:11] here and take a message and he can
[25:12] tailor that message for every single one
[25:15] of us in all of our different ways you
[25:17] know each one of us are called to
[25:18] different places some of your husband's
[25:20] in here and fathers and mothers I was
[25:23] teasing Kristen little bit ago when she
[25:24] come to the door first time I've seen in
[25:26] the weekend and I said hello my name has
[25:28] been NORAD nice to meet you I understand
[25:30] you're the pastor's wife you know she
[25:32] run around these kids all the time and I
[25:33] laugh one preacher said that a new
[25:36] mother stays back sit like that for
[25:38] three years you know because they don't
[25:39] never get in church and they never ever
[25:41] always them kids you know and III know
[25:44] everybody's got different little things
[25:45] that do and and if you don't think your
[25:48] pastor's got a hard job preaching here
[25:50] in the church and trying to get things
[25:52] going
[25:52] you ain't never live with a
[25:53] schoolteacher I have I've seen it
[25:55] firsthand they're not done with school
[25:57] when the bell rings they bring school
[25:58] home with them they got hours on top of
[26:00] that he don't have just hours of school
[26:02] but he's got hours of study to get ready
[26:04] for these messages during the week and
[26:05] so it's a hard job but everybody's got
[26:08] their their vocation in life I was
[26:10] talking to brother there and we was
[26:12] getting acquainted a little bit and I
[26:13] asked him I said what do you do for a
[26:16] living he said well I'm in between jobs
[26:17] I'm trying to get situated in a
[26:20] different Avenue and I said well that's
[26:21] fine I said what did you do Lord he said
[26:23] everything from carpenter to truck
[26:25] driver to I almost started gonna throw
[26:27] preaching at one point I just I was
[26:29] waiting for it but I didn't hear it but
[26:31] anyhow everybody's got their own little
[26:33] ways of doing things and everybody's
[26:35] been called to a certain position
[26:37] everybody's you know got their way
[26:38] brother there was telling me he's into
[26:41] computers and securities and things like
[26:43] that and I'm a business guy as far as
[26:44] education goes I like business and I
[26:46] like business models and all of that
[26:48] that stuff would bore you to death but I
[26:50] like it I enjoy studying these case
[26:53] studies of these firms and how they
[26:55] develop and all that and so it comes to
[26:57] the gospel every one of us have a
[26:59] different placement you remember some
[27:01] months ago when I preached to you about
[27:02] everybody having their gifts among the
[27:04] body and everybody being a gifted body
[27:06] and has their place well when it comes
[27:09] to the things of God God has laid out
[27:11] all of these little positions and all of
[27:14] these things as it hath pleased him and
[27:16] we notice what the Bible taught us that
[27:17] all of this is as it has pleased God and
[27:20] we might all have different ways and all
[27:23] that but the word and this is what I was
[27:25] trying to get to you here in this
[27:27] opening talk the word has a special way
[27:30] about it when you let the Lord get a
[27:32] hold of it that he can touch the
[27:33] businessman and the truck driver and the
[27:35] securities guy and the teacher and the
[27:37] housewives and all these other people
[27:39] and just get in there with the same
[27:41] scripture that he might use like repent
[27:43] for example and hit everybody in the
[27:45] whole church because God has laid his
[27:48] word out for all races all classes all
[27:51] intelligences all levels of education
[27:54] all
[27:55] of financial every what they might be
[27:57] he's laid the word out where it can
[27:59] touch every single person and God did it
[28:02] this way because when it comes to
[28:04] bringing judgment in the last hours and
[28:06] we come to the last time the Holy Spirit
[28:09] doesn't want to have people stand before
[28:11] him and say okay now I want to get the
[28:13] rich class to get their judgement time
[28:15] okay now all the whites now all the
[28:17] blacks now all the Chinese the Asian
[28:19] ever what you might be all of the ones
[28:22] from Latin America alright it's your
[28:24] turn all right now everybody that's over
[28:25] six foot tall
[28:26] now you make your way up here I don't
[28:28] think God does things like that I don't
[28:31] think he classes us by our color of our
[28:33] skin or by how he was raised or where we
[28:35] come from the word is what they say in
[28:38] the world one size fits all handle that
[28:41] Amen it fits all of us in a certain way
[28:43] and when it comes to judgment it doesn't
[28:46] matter is expression goes if you were
[28:48] born with a silver spoon in your mouth
[28:50] or if you're a beggar on the street God
[28:52] gives every single one of us an
[28:54] opportunity to get right with him don't
[28:56] you think so I think he gives us all an
[28:59] opportunity our consciences are built I
[29:02] mean our human conscience is built in a
[29:04] way to where that when God is dealing
[29:06] with us and God is talking to us even
[29:08] when we're sinners we might be sitting
[29:10] on a barstool might be laying in the
[29:12] gutter filth of the world ain't no
[29:14] telling where we that might be in a
[29:16] church room might be sitting in a Bible
[29:18] study might be sitting in a you know a
[29:20] robe quired and God starts dealing with
[29:23] your conscience that there's more out
[29:25] there in life there's more to this thing
[29:27] called God than just what you're
[29:28] standing there in church or maybe
[29:30] standing there in the pits of sin and
[29:32] God starts dealing with you maybe
[29:34] there's a savior out there maybe there's
[29:36] somebody out there that loves me and
[29:38] cares for me I believe God wants to deal
[29:40] with every single one of us on that same
[29:43] level and give us all the same
[29:45] opportunities to get right with God
[29:47] when it comes to the judgment God will
[29:49] judge the world but not my not my
[29:52] socio-economic class not my degrees of
[29:55] school not my what you did or what you
[29:58] didn't do who your daddy was or how much
[30:01] money he might have had or ever what it
[30:03] might be he ain't gonna judge us on our
[30:05] last name he ain't gonna judge us on our
[30:07] first name
[30:08] when the judgement hour arrives he is
[30:10] going to judge the world by Jesus Christ
[30:13] and our attitude hallelujah to what we
[30:16] thought about Jesus Christ in this last
[30:17] day he's going to judge us based upon
[30:20] what our attitude toward him was and
[30:22] then how he reciprocated back and what
[30:25] we did with that reciprocation sometimes
[30:27] God will talk to us we don't realize
[30:29] it's God but sometimes he'll talk to us
[30:31] and he wants us to recognize he loves us
[30:34] and cares for us and sometimes we
[30:36] slapped God right in the face I mean
[30:38] humanity does they slap him right in the
[30:41] face and they ignore his advances of his
[30:43] promised word instead of them opening up
[30:45] their heart and saying oh that's
[30:47] Almighty God dealing with me they pass
[30:49] it off as some kind of a figment of
[30:50] somebody's imagination but it's God
[30:53] dealing with them just the same the
[30:55] Bible said that it'll come to a place
[30:57] they'll say no so often that God will
[31:00] sear their conscience with a hot iron in
[31:02] other words they can't feel it no more
[31:03] doesn't matter how much you preach to
[31:05] them no matter what you say they cannot
[31:08] respond to the grace of God and forgive
[31:10] me for this next remark I don't mean it
[31:12] to sound ugly but you could pray for
[31:14] them until your eyeballs fell out of
[31:15] your head you could pray for them until
[31:17] your tongue got thick and you'd almost
[31:18] amen go completely mute but if they've
[31:21] crossed the line between mercy and
[31:23] judgment there's not enough anointing
[31:25] oil there's not enough preachers there's
[31:27] not enough scriptures in the Bible to
[31:28] bring them back once their conscience is
[31:31] sealed and God turns away from them
[31:33] that's it there ain't no more mercy left
[31:34] for them what an hour for some people in
[31:37] this world you think of this lady you'll
[31:39] see an age where there'll be thousands
[31:41] upon thousands that will go by the way
[31:43] of the grave this month before we get to
[31:45] Thanksgiving time there'll be tens of
[31:47] thousands go to the regions of the lost
[31:49] not knowing Jesus as a personal Savior
[31:52] but rather being guilty of turning him
[31:54] away and rejecting his advances of his
[31:56] promised word you see God makes advances
[31:59] on us like a boy would a girl when I met
[32:02] Samantha I flirted a little bit I know
[32:04] it's hard to believe but I did I did
[32:06] brother Jesse I flirted a little bit I
[32:08] happen to like her I thought she was an
[32:11] alright kid and I'd smile bigger than
[32:13] I'd smile with the other girls and I
[32:15] laughed louder when I would the other
[32:16] girls you know because I liked her and I
[32:19] think sometimes in a simplistic way of
[32:21] saying
[32:22] we got these youngins here I tried to
[32:23] say these things I preached here in
[32:24] Akron in a way that all these youngins
[32:26] can get this and I try to give you a
[32:28] mental picture of how Jesus does believe
[32:31] me it could be as simple as you just
[32:32] setting in a Walmart somewhere somebody
[32:34] meant God and you feel the chill going
[32:36] down your back that could be the Holy
[32:37] Ghost trying to get your attention
[32:39] oh it may not be that way it may be
[32:41] something else you might have been
[32:43] sitting in the ballgame and somebody
[32:44] held up a sign Saint John 3:16 you might
[32:49] have thought about God that might have
[32:51] been God trying to get your attention
[32:52] sometimes we don't think about how God
[32:55] does things maybe it was when you were
[32:57] sick and mysteriously somehow you got
[32:59] well and you don't know how you got well
[33:01] maybe you've been in the persecution of
[33:03] another country and God saw you through
[33:05] to safety God trying to get our
[33:07] attention
[33:08] he makes advances on his promise word he
[33:11] displays himself as somebody that wants
[33:13] to be your boyfriend he wants to go
[33:16] deeper than be boyfriend's he wants to
[33:18] marry you and we've got to come to the
[33:20] place where we realize when God makes
[33:22] advances to us as his children we've got
[33:24] to receive what it is that God wants now
[33:28] what would you think if I was to say to
[33:29] Samantha you know my wife Sam y'all may
[33:32] not have got to meet my wife she's a
[33:34] beautiful lady five foot one I call her
[33:36] the little girl at the big voice and she
[33:38] didn't get in here singing as we came
[33:40] but she's got a big mouth a big singing
[33:42] ballad amen that's what she tells me
[33:44] anyhow and I like I like her attitude or
[33:49] spunk you know I like that and I said
[33:51] you know you're feisty and I like it I
[33:53] like that feistiness out of you I never
[33:55] could have married one of these little
[33:56] old flowers always wilted and all that
[33:58] kind of so I could've done it brother
[33:59] Jesse I have been miserable
[34:01] I needed somebody had a little bit of
[34:03] pep in her step you know talking about
[34:05] and and you know what would you think
[34:07] mean much as I think of Samantha and I
[34:09] would say to her hey I like you want to
[34:11] go get an ice-cream sometime or
[34:13] something like that get away from me
[34:15] number one you broke and I don't think
[34:18] you're even handsome well I could have
[34:21] come back the next day and said now now
[34:23] listen I like you I like your spunk I
[34:26] like your attitude I want to take you
[34:28] out for a root beer float she said I
[34:31] tell you to get away from me I don't
[34:33] like you you got a big nose
[34:36] how long y'all think I'd put up with
[34:38] that before eventually I'd move on to
[34:41] another girl Jesus is the same way he
[34:45] makes advances of his promised word he
[34:47] tries to get the people's attention and
[34:49] they keep slapping him in the face
[34:52] there's coming to judgment one day a
[34:54] reckoning day where every man a woman's
[34:56] gonna have to give an account for the
[34:57] things they've done in this life amen
[35:00] and they're gonna find out the very one
[35:02] that could have gave him eternal life
[35:03] they rejected his advances of his
[35:05] promise word now let's turn to
[35:07] Revelation chapter 20 for just a moment
[35:09] let's look at the picture of the
[35:11] judgment that's coming after a while and
[35:13] I just want to show you something in
[35:14] this I know we're very familiar with it
[35:15] but I just want to catch just a couple
[35:17] of phrases and the scripture to kind of
[35:19] outline if you will what I what I'm
[35:21] trying to get to tonight
[35:22] revelation 20 verse 11 I saw a great
[35:25] white throne and him that sat on it from
[35:28] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[35:30] away and there was found no place for
[35:33] him I saw the dead small and great stand
[35:37] before God and the books were opened and
[35:39] another book was opened which is the
[35:41] book of life and the dead were judged
[35:42] out of those things which were written
[35:44] in the books according to their works
[35:48] now you see the picture of this great
[35:51] judgment time coming
[35:52] notice the heaven and the earth flee
[35:55] away from him that sets on the on the
[35:58] throne but there's one group it ain't
[36:01] running nowhere because the wife ain't
[36:04] afraid of her husband hallelujah
[36:06] she's not afraid standing there of the
[36:10] great judge of the heavens and the earth
[36:11] naw Brad on the outer but she don't run
[36:14] anywhere because she is the promised
[36:17] word made manifest vindicated word
[36:19] standing there in a glorified body
[36:21] sitting on the throne with him that's
[36:22] what Paul said that would you said no
[36:24] you're not saying you'll judge angels
[36:26] and there you're sitting there in the
[36:28] throne of God the rest of the world as
[36:31] we know it is afraid of that face they
[36:33] fear until maybe their boughs would
[36:36] loose until their knees would knock
[36:38] together until they would write it hide
[36:40] but there's nowhere to hide from this
[36:41] face that sits on that throne it's the
[36:43] same all-seeing eye that watched them
[36:45] down in time when they rejected the
[36:47] advances of the promise word
[36:49] he's watching him even now he knows
[36:52] right down to the very soul of who they
[36:54] are and remember my friends Paul
[36:56] describes to us in Hebrews chapter four
[36:58] that we are naked and open in the eyes
[37:01] of him of whom we have to do said the
[37:03] King James other versions of the Bible
[37:05] said of him of who we are responsible
[37:08] him who we are accountable to we are
[37:10] naked in the eyes of him Jesus Christ
[37:13] there's nothing you can hide forgiveness
[37:16] as this sounds ugly I don't mean this an
[37:18] ugly manner but what would happen if
[37:20] some of us walked in here their clothes
[37:21] off you walked in here naked everybody's
[37:25] had that highschool dream about giving
[37:26] the public speech in her underwear every
[37:28] one now I'm trying to say something not
[37:31] trying to be funny but what would happen
[37:34] if you come in this church tonight naked
[37:36] well you there's parts of you if you've
[37:38] got any sense or common sense or
[37:40] something about you at all there's a
[37:42] fear there there's something a scare
[37:44] there you wouldn't want nobody to see
[37:45] you in that condition you want to run
[37:47] and grab some clothes on right quickly
[37:49] somebody help me something's happened
[37:50] I've lost my way I'm standing here naked
[37:53] but men talked about that when he said
[37:54] the lady is seeing people you go to the
[37:56] street corner be a man without any
[37:57] clothes on you tell him that he's naked
[37:59] and he tells you to shut your mouth and
[38:01] get away I'm fine the way I am he said
[38:04] that's the way churches are in the last
[38:05] day he said they don't want to be
[38:07] dressed in the Word of God they want
[38:08] their own garments he said but yet in
[38:10] the eyes of God they're naked wretched
[38:12] miserable blind and they don't even know
[38:14] it now we could cover ourselves up
[38:17] because there'd be a fear or shame
[38:19] they're just like man does with his soul
[38:22] he tries to cover up his soul cover up
[38:25] his conscience try to drown it out my
[38:27] religion and other type of things but in
[38:30] the eyes of God he's still naked
[38:32] I want you listen me carefully children
[38:34] of God Jesus not only sees the good
[38:37] parts but Jesus sees the embarrassing
[38:39] parts he sees the parts that we want to
[38:42] cover up he sees the things that we
[38:44] would honor hide from somebody else
[38:46] things that we want nobody to know about
[38:49] Jesus sees every bit of it now coming
[38:52] back to what Paul said here in Timothy
[38:54] you'll notice that he said these words
[38:56] that some some their sins come open
[39:00] beforehand oh I got to say something to
[39:03] you
[39:03] God let it be that I qualify right there
[39:07] let my sin come open beforehand don't
[39:11] let my sin go on the judgment don't let
[39:13] me be caught up there at the judgment
[39:15] bar with Smith missing something right
[39:17] down through here God helped me that my
[39:21] sins come exposed now you realize the
[39:24] opportunity that we've got when the Word
[39:26] of God gets right in your face and the
[39:28] Holy Spirit gets in your lap and tells
[39:30] you what you need to do to get right
[39:31] that's a blessing to you my friend you
[39:34] can't get mad at Jesus and say God you
[39:36] are not talk to me that way
[39:37] you ought to be the happiest person how
[39:40] to letter that God would expose your sin
[39:43] and help you be right because if you
[39:46] wait to there it's too late there won't
[39:48] be no mercy for it there here we've got
[39:50] mercy here we've got grace here we've
[39:52] got the ability to repent and make it
[39:55] right and say god I'm sorry
[39:56] I want you to forget me but there
[39:59] there'll be nothing left but your works
[40:01] that'll be the only thing you stand
[40:02] there with look at what he said there in
[40:05] Revelation 20 he said they're judged
[40:08] according to their works would you want
[40:11] to have to stand before God with your
[40:13] works alone look at a mirror Matthew 7
[40:16] that's what reason they come the way
[40:18] they do
[40:18] we were talking out a little bit last
[40:19] night Jesse how those come I preached I
[40:22] prophesied I've done this I done that
[40:24] yeah sure sure they come telling that
[40:27] because that's the only thing they've
[40:29] got I've thought to myself and other
[40:32] times why didn't they come up saying
[40:33] I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:35] I'm born-again Christian they couldn't
[40:37] say that because they're standing in
[40:38] front of the presence of that light
[40:40] they knew they wasn't mourned again so
[40:43] the only thing they had was to display
[40:45] an exhibition of their works god I've
[40:50] done this I've done that you know no
[40:52] words God don't send me to hell cuz I'm
[40:53] pretty good guy that's the key ain't
[40:56] none of us good guys that's the thing we
[40:59] got to understand grace didn't come to
[41:01] save good guys grace come to save
[41:03] sinners how do you God came to say the
[41:07] last time alone so he became the lowest
[41:10] of the low that he could make us the
[41:11] highest of the high God didn't come to
[41:14] save save people
[41:16] you can't save save people people that
[41:19] think they don't need God they don't
[41:20] need to help they don't need nobody to
[41:22] deal with them don't need nobody to give
[41:24] them a handout lord of god I've got this
[41:26] stand back Michael Stanback Gabriel I'll
[41:29] handle the business that person right
[41:31] there when they stand on the day of
[41:33] judgment they will stand there with
[41:34] their works and their works alone now
[41:37] watch this Paul said going before to
[41:40] judgment now some men they follow after
[41:43] that can you imagine kind of blending in
[41:47] with this morning you remember I told
[41:48] you people get to a spot but it comes to
[41:51] repentance --is and things that when
[41:54] they're repenting and they're really
[41:56] keeping their heart tender before the
[41:58] Lord God honors them for that but you
[42:01] realize that we've arrived at a you know
[42:03] a position if you want to call that I
[42:05] believe it's a position just like the
[42:07] bride would have a position I believe on
[42:09] that false vine it's a position just the
[42:11] same we've arrived at the positioning of
[42:14] these men and women that will not repent
[42:16] at the preaching of this last day
[42:18] preachers that's why brother ben said
[42:20] we're coming back to a spot what would
[42:22] be preaching the souls in prison that
[42:24] can never be saved now listen to me that
[42:27] don't mean they leave Church they don't
[42:30] mean they don't sit on these pews it
[42:33] just means they won't repent they won't
[42:35] be still won't be touched they won't be
[42:37] influenced by anything you watch people
[42:40] in this day and age I watch them when I
[42:42] preach to them you know I'm watching
[42:45] every one of you
[42:47] III pay attention to how they act how
[42:50] they behave when the words going forth I
[42:52] watch to see who's responding and who
[42:55] ain't responding
[42:56] I don't always mean naturally or
[42:58] physically maybe an Amen or glory or a
[43:01] hallelujah or something like that but I
[43:03] watch to see the attitude of the person
[43:04] to see how they're answering back to the
[43:07] Word of God to see whether or not
[43:08] they're connected with what's being
[43:10] preached and I see people again and
[43:13] again and again and again setting in the
[43:15] pews and there's no connection between
[43:17] me and the Holy Spirit and them we're
[43:20] entering a place where those that will
[43:22] not repent are coming in that spot to
[43:25] preach to those that cannot be said
[43:26] preach to those that are eternal life
[43:28] preach to those that can never
[43:30] five the sudden appears dead but yet
[43:35] still claiming to believe footbe
[43:37] followers of the message now what does
[43:40] God do with a person like that now when
[43:42] you and I the Lord deals with us he says
[43:44] repent say yes Lord sorry forgive me I
[43:46] like what brother Jesse did this morning
[43:49] and I've had it in my mind all day to
[43:52] mention this I almost forgot it to the
[43:53] Lord remind me of just now but I liked
[43:55] how you said this morning just ask God
[43:58] to forgive you
[43:59] he waited just a few moments they bout
[44:01] to get a chance to compose himself and
[44:02] he said all right ain't it wonderful
[44:04] that Jesus forgave you I thought he's
[44:06] the first preacher in 27 years of
[44:08] preaching that I've ever heard bring it
[44:09] on just exactly like it I thought it was
[44:11] wonderful usually say ask God to forgive
[44:15] you for hours later they're still asking
[44:18] but I like what he did this morning
[44:20] because I said that's what the Bible
[44:21] said ask and if you ask and as you ask
[44:25] believe that what you've said will come
[44:28] to pass how many times does it take me
[44:31] to ask God to forgive him before he's
[44:32] already heard my prayer and has already
[44:34] answered my prayer I believe it by faith
[44:36] if I say I'm sorry I don't have to say
[44:38] the second time he heard me the first
[44:40] time this is not Catholicism we don't
[44:43] drag our knees on concrete we don't rep
[44:45] beads we don't kiss Peters toe we don't
[44:47] beat ourselves trying to find peace with
[44:49] God faith is what brings us peace with
[44:52] God faith in his promise work that I
[44:55] asked him according to his promise it's
[44:57] up to him to forgive me or not and if I
[45:00] do it God's Way he promised to forgive
[45:01] me hey man he promised to do what he
[45:04] said he was gonna do either's a man of
[45:06] his word reate and if I believe he's
[45:09] said it then I've got to believe that
[45:10] it's exactly for me and what he promised
[45:13] in that way but some men sins go on to
[45:17] the judgment why is that I want to use a
[45:19] few examples and I know I've you've
[45:22] probably heard a lot of this before I
[45:23] don't mean to bore you with new detail
[45:25] all details but I I think sometimes you
[45:30] got to go back and revisit some of these
[45:31] things to keep him fresh in you and I
[45:34] think about people like Marilyn Monroe
[45:36] most photographed woman on the face of
[45:39] planet Earth
[45:42] course they say she's the most beautiful
[45:43] woman I said well I said she was a
[45:46] pretty girl but later on in life you
[45:48] know they don't realize because a lot of
[45:50] people don't know this about Marilyn but
[45:52] she had collagen put in her nose she had
[45:53] a little rubber thing put in her chin
[45:55] had enhancements all over her body from
[45:57] the top of her head to the soles of her
[45:58] feet to keep her looking young keep her
[46:00] looking like she was looking she was
[46:02] manufactured beauty because you see a
[46:06] lot of these people where they realize
[46:08] they're not they get under the influence
[46:10] of a spirit and that devil tells him
[46:12] Elvis Presley you look at how this
[46:15] Presley was a handsome man stayed a
[46:17] handsome man of course so you would look
[46:19] handsome too if you use shoe polish on
[46:21] your eyelashes to keep him black and
[46:23] dark like it and your hair by the way it
[46:26] wasn't a natural thing oh no he had all
[46:28] kinds of enhancement surgery and all of
[46:30] this started out a handsome boy but kept
[46:33] it going through all kinds of little old
[46:35] ways he had eye trouble for a lot of
[46:37] years people don't realize this he had a
[46:38] lot of bad eye trouble because of all
[46:40] that shoe polish he kept in his eye
[46:41] little chemical things and stuff getting
[46:43] in his eyes all the time just about ruin
[46:45] his eyes trying to keep him dark
[46:47] eyelashes afraid to turn gray of course
[46:49] because then women wouldn't throw their
[46:50] undergarments at him it's a spirit these
[46:54] things that get a hold of people I was
[46:56] told a story sometime back in the summer
[46:58] and I may have shared this with you but
[47:00] I'm going to tell it again Dottie Rambo
[47:03] who wrote a lot of these great songs if
[47:04] you know Dottie she wrote songs like see
[47:06] the bright light shine if that isn't
[47:08] love one of the most prolific
[47:10] songwriters of gospel music and I guess
[47:13] the 21st 20th century 21st century
[47:15] probably won't be another one like her
[47:16] she was just dynamite one of the best
[47:19] since Fanny Crosby wrote hundreds of
[47:21] songs good friends with Elvis Presley
[47:23] and said Elvis called her over one day
[47:25] and said Dottie I need you to come pray
[47:28] and so her and her husband buck Rambo
[47:29] they got the car drove over to where
[47:31] Elvis was at I think it was Graceland
[47:33] the time and he's sitting in his floor
[47:35] with his Bible open and he's sitting
[47:38] there and an Indian position of you know
[47:40] his legs crossed I what we used to call
[47:41] Indian style he sent her with his Bible
[47:44] on his lap and he's praying and he sees
[47:47] Dottie and Buck walking he said you got
[47:49] to pray for me right now
[47:50] he's gripping his Bible and he said I
[47:52] just can't find him I just can't find
[47:54] him
[47:54] they
[47:55] Don they prayed and they said Elvis
[47:57] hollered and wailed and screamed and and
[48:01] cried out to God and when they left that
[48:04] room he was left there clutching his
[48:05] Bible saying I just can't find him
[48:08] I just can't find him you see my friend
[48:11] many of these people that refuse to
[48:14] repent God shuts a door on them and no
[48:17] matter how much they cry no matter how
[48:19] much they cry out he shuts the door on
[48:22] them and there's no way back that's why
[48:24] he's sitting her holding his Bible I
[48:25] just can't find him I just can't find
[48:27] him now when you get a person in that
[48:30] condition such an unrepentant attitude
[48:34] then God who cannot deal with their sins
[48:37] today
[48:38] now you understand when you and I do
[48:40] something wrong I mind you there's 50
[48:42] scriptures I could read I'm gonna let
[48:43] you pass to read hold him and a few
[48:44] weeks from now whatever he brings it
[48:46] back maybe but we could go to the book
[48:48] of John he said in little children I
[48:50] write unto you that you sin not but if
[48:52] any man sin he has an advocate with the
[48:54] father Jesus Christ the righteous when
[48:57] we do something wrong God deals with us
[48:59] we repent of the thing today it stops
[49:01] today never to return again until we
[49:03] make another mistake we repent again it
[49:06] goes away under the blood of Jesus
[49:07] Christ that's because you got a
[49:10] repentant spirit but what about the
[49:13] people that don't Paul tells us what
[49:16] happens here their sins accumulate their
[49:20] aggregated for example Marilyn Monroe
[49:23] has been dead for many many years but
[49:25] she's still sending even though her
[49:27] body's laying in a mausoleum Elvis
[49:30] Presley is still committing wrongs and
[49:33] sins his music is still aggregating sins
[49:37] against his example when he stands
[49:40] before God he won't just answer for all
[49:42] of the years up to 77 when he drew his
[49:45] last breath but he'll have to answer
[49:46] from 77 all the way to 2000 whatever
[49:49] when Jesus takes his home he'll have to
[49:51] answer for her because his example is
[49:55] still out there before humanity
[49:57] how many men pulled up Marilyn's picture
[50:00] and lusted after how many people made
[50:03] some movie about Marilyn Monroe flashed
[50:05] a picture up there at Maryland and in
[50:07] their mind in their heart committed
[50:09] like Jesus said when a man looks on a
[50:11] woman to lust after he's committed
[50:13] adultery with her with her didn't say
[50:16] whether she was living or dead or not
[50:18] you say well where to god she's dead God
[50:22] can't hold nothing against her counting
[50:23] a lot of these sins remember they visit
[50:28] generation after generation somebody's
[50:31] got to give an account for it
[50:32] remember the prophet of God said that
[50:34] whenever you confess your sin he said it
[50:37] goes into the blood of Jesus Christ it
[50:39] breaks up back all through the the
[50:42] generations it goes back through all of
[50:43] that and it goes where back to the head
[50:46] of the one that started it in the first
[50:48] place which was the devil Satan has to
[50:53] give an account for everything he's ever
[50:55] taught me into doing he's the one to
[50:59] blame for it because the blood of Christ
[51:00] takes it all the way back people can say
[51:07] well she's dead but it doesn't matter
[51:10] her pictures her influence is still
[51:12] living on how can God stop a sin that
[51:17] would have never been stopped here in
[51:19] time because they had an unrepentant
[51:20] attitude this is why they stand before
[51:23] God at the day of judgment their works
[51:25] is all they've got Lord I was a pretty
[51:28] good guy remember that evangelist Danny
[51:30] Greenfield that stood in the light he
[51:32] said he thought he was a pretty good guy
[51:33] seven of the bride of that light got the
[51:35] law realize he wasn't let me tell you
[51:39] something Church of the Living God we
[51:40] may think oh my that the light gets
[51:42] pretty bright sitting here in church but
[51:44] should I thank God that it's bright like
[51:46] it is because you don't want to meet
[51:47] that at judgment time and a man when
[51:52] that Holy Ghost preacher pulls out one
[51:54] of them Holy Ghost candles and he
[51:55] illuminates that like you're hunting for
[51:57] deer hey man is the brightest light and
[52:00] you think Lord I'm an awful person you
[52:02] ought to just not walk out shout out of
[52:05] this church thinking God thank you for
[52:07] letting me see everything that's in my
[52:09] life everything this room that I can
[52:11] deal with it right now makes it hard
[52:14] sometimes the preaching of the word gets
[52:17] very hard like that because we go to
[52:18] looking at ourselves and what we're all
[52:20] about
[52:20] and we thank to ourself man
[52:23] I'm an awful person but where would you
[52:26] rather thank it here over yonder I'd
[52:30] rather think it here now watch he said
[52:33] some will follow after now some sins
[52:36] come open before Hanna there's also
[52:39] those like Ananias and Sapphira who
[52:42] whenever having the opportunity to maybe
[52:45] repent or make right God already knew
[52:48] that their heart was hardened that their
[52:50] face was set like flint
[52:52] so Peter sets up court why did you lie
[52:57] to the Holy Ghost
[52:58] yeah well God didn't even give him a
[53:01] chance it's not wrote in the Bible how
[53:02] many chances they got but I'm sure they
[53:04] got chances because God don't call a man
[53:07] to judgment without a first warning
[53:08] inversed God brought him in and dealt
[53:12] with him and told him listen you you've
[53:14] held back part of the price
[53:15] why'd Satan fill your heart to do such a
[53:18] thing and then here come wifey have you
[53:24] done all that the Lord told you to do
[53:26] solve an old arrogant type spirit you
[53:32] know one place the prophet of God said
[53:33] maybe Anton stood so far maybe that was
[53:35] a deacon in the church
[53:37] big time failure probably a lot of
[53:40] people wouldn't have called him out
[53:41] because they wouldn't want to lose their
[53:42] financial gain praise the Lord somebody
[53:47] let me tell you something real mini
[53:49] garden got their eyes focused on that
[53:50] know how I right now I stand before you
[53:54] the dumbest preacher that ever lived
[53:56] I'm the dumbest preacher though I'm
[53:57] smart estab Angeles that ever lived
[53:59] because places that would support me
[54:02] greatly financially thousands of dollars
[54:04] would support me I go and preach the
[54:06] gospel and I ruin it all they don't
[54:08] never want me back if I was a smart
[54:12] Evangelist like some of these guys out
[54:13] there today this all out for the meal
[54:15] ticket they would find the places to
[54:17] preach it paid to most and they would
[54:18] just keep hitting him and hitting him
[54:19] and hitting him and preach nice of
[54:21] course preach sweet of course but Jesse
[54:23] make everything nice and never preach
[54:25] the gospel never get down hard tell
[54:27] everybody how elected they are how alive
[54:29] Jesus is and how great the message is
[54:31] and the message and the message and the
[54:33] message and a message and then they go
[54:34] home and
[54:35] leaves exactly the same way that come in
[54:38] miserable miserable and questioning Who
[54:43] am I where am I going
[54:44] I gotta get right with God we need some
[54:47] gospel preachers they ain't worried
[54:49] about almighty dollar but Almighty God
[54:51] yes sir we need them we need them I'm
[54:58] gonna say this I know that Internet's up
[54:59] here but you know I heard men talk about
[55:04] other churches okay places that I used
[55:09] to attend they're talking about
[55:11] pastoring churches and things of that
[55:13] nature I hear different folks talking
[55:16] about pastoring and it sounds like a
[55:18] business transaction it's a place you
[55:22] know a business almost the church has
[55:25] become that way what's going to happen a
[55:27] lot of these men standing before their
[55:30] flocks it's gonna have to give an
[55:32] account for not telling the truth simply
[55:35] because it would affect their own
[55:37] personal bottom line the church isn't a
[55:40] business the church's judgment house
[55:45] hallelujah somebody judgment begins at
[55:49] the house of God that's what the Bible
[55:51] said this is where we judge ourselves
[55:53] according to the word and the faith or
[55:56] not we're not supposed to come out here
[55:57] and pat everybody on the head and tell
[55:59] you how pretty you look at how handsome
[56:00] you are and how much bride you are and
[56:02] all that I can do all that to but when
[56:05] you walk out of you think well am i
[56:06] bride and am i how do I know because you
[56:10] live with yourself and you don't need
[56:15] nobody to judge you you're your own
[56:16] judge of who you are you live with
[56:19] yourself you know yourself better than
[56:21] anybody you know them places that are
[56:23] naked in God's eyes right and you never
[56:29] bear those parts to me or nobody else
[56:31] but God sees them just the same
[56:32] that's hebrews chapter 4 if you like to
[56:35] read it let's just go there let's just
[56:37] go there let's just read it hebrews
[56:40] chapter 4 let's see if we're naked or
[56:43] not in his eyes
[56:45] hebrews chapter four let's pick it up
[56:47] verse 14 or excuse me verse 11 I mean to
[56:50] say let us labor therefore to enter into
[56:53] that rest a city man fall after the same
[56:55] example of unbelief for the word of God
[56:57] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[56:59] any two-edged sword piercing even to the
[57:01] dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[57:04] the joints of the marrow and is a
[57:05] discerner of the thoughts and the
[57:07] intents of the heart
[57:08] neither is there any creature at you by
[57:11] the way that's me by the way that is not
[57:14] manifest in his sight and what Paul said
[57:17] whether it's good whether it's bad all
[57:19] will come into manifestation everything
[57:22] will be shown but all things that's me
[57:25] and you again are naked and open oh God
[57:31] naked and open in the eyes of him with
[57:35] whom we have to do you say well I I'm a
[57:41] religious guy better be I do religious
[57:43] things that might be the covering on the
[57:46] outside that might be the covering you
[57:49] chose but in the eyes of God we're naked
[57:52] the only thing that will cover us up
[57:54] from being naked in the eyes of God as
[57:57] we must have the baptism of the Holy
[57:59] Spirit that is the believers garment
[58:02] that keeps us from being absolutely
[58:04] naked in Lady ousia
[58:06] it keeps us from being naked in the eyes
[58:08] of God it keeps us from all amen
[58:12] just to be covered in the Word of God
[58:14] hallelujah that word is what covers us
[58:17] up God as ice all to keep us that the
[58:20] shame of our nakedness do not appear
[58:21] amen amen amen
[58:24] oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus amen
[58:30] the Bible even tells us the name of the
[58:35] Lord is a strong tower the righteous run
[58:38] a thin to it and they're safe that's
[58:40] proverbs 18:10 if you'd like to read it
[58:43] he tells us that the rich man's wealth
[58:46] is a strong City as a high wall his own
[58:48] conceit before destruction the heart of
[58:51] man is haughty and before honor is
[58:54] humility he that answereth a matter
[58:56] before he heareth it is folly in a shame
[58:58] to him
[58:59] the spirit of a man will sustain his
[59:01] infirmity but a wounded spirit who could
[59:03] bear the heart of the prudent getteth
[59:05] knowledge and the ear of the wise
[59:06] seeketh knowledge and a man's gift makes
[59:10] rooms for himself and and brings him
[59:12] before great men he that his first his
[59:16] own cause seemed is just but his
[59:18] neighbor cometh in search with him see
[59:21] you understand what he's saying he's
[59:24] saying that in other words if a man is
[59:27] his works if he's wise he seeks for
[59:31] God's way doesn't seek for his own way
[59:35] if he wants honor he seeks it through
[59:38] humility glory to God if he wants peace
[59:41] he seeks it through ending the war
[59:44] between him and Jesus Christ I'll tell
[59:48] you something brother the Bible said
[59:49] that we're at war with God when were not
[59:51] saved did you know that our minds are in
[59:54] natee against the things of God we are
[59:56] at war there's a wall of partition
[59:57] between us oh I know Jesus tore it down
[1:00:00] but you've got to accept that pardon
[1:00:02] first if you don't accept it first
[1:00:03] there's no way that it can be accepted
[1:00:06] the wall is still there between you and
[1:00:09] God you're at war with him that's why
[1:00:10] when you get new armor on he gives you
[1:00:12] shoes of gospel peace you're at peace
[1:00:15] with God you're no longer worrying about
[1:00:17] things
[1:00:18] am i save does God love me no no you
[1:00:21] know that beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:00:22] Solomon here is describing how that a
[1:00:26] person achieves great things the name of
[1:00:29] the Lord is a strong tower the righteous
[1:00:31] run into it and they're safe Oh God if
[1:00:35] here's my Taliban why do I build my own
[1:00:39] place of protection
[1:00:41] we've been talked about in the days of
[1:00:44] Noah he said in the days of Noah there
[1:00:45] were other boat builders among everybody
[1:00:49] trying to build their own way and make
[1:00:51] their own way into the kingdom you have
[1:00:53] to come God's Way God's way look at some
[1:00:58] of these little principles he lays in
[1:01:00] there he that answereth a matter before
[1:01:01] he hears it it's folly and shame the
[1:01:06] heart of the prudent seeks knowledge and
[1:01:08] the ear the wise seek knowledge in other
[1:01:11] words
[1:01:12] if a man is going to be anything at all
[1:01:15] he's got to realize first that he's
[1:01:17] nothing and that there's a higher
[1:01:21] knowledge that there's a higher wisdom
[1:01:23] and there's a higher honor that he has
[1:01:26] to seek but he can't seek it in himself
[1:01:28] for the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:01:30] tower the righteous run into it and her
[1:01:33] safe
[1:01:34] oh I just love the word don't you and
[1:01:39] lets us know my hallelujah that if we're
[1:01:43] naked in the eyes of God then God sees
[1:01:46] all of our ambitions God sees all of our
[1:01:49] goals and our dreams and if God wants us
[1:01:54] to get somewhere he'll make room for us
[1:01:57] to get there if we trust him if we have
[1:02:02] confidence that he's the leader he'll
[1:02:04] make room for us to get there but like
[1:02:08] Solomon saying you try to do it through
[1:02:09] your riches try to do it in your own
[1:02:11] conceits try to do it in your own way
[1:02:13] it's folly to answer a matter before you
[1:02:16] hear it in other words sit down and
[1:02:18] count the cost a little bit god what is
[1:02:22] that you want me to do the prophet of
[1:02:23] God likened to a man going to work he
[1:02:25] said you show up on a job and you're
[1:02:27] standing around maybe for an hour or
[1:02:28] something like that and you still don't
[1:02:29] know what you're supposed to do you go
[1:02:31] to the boss and say hey would you hire
[1:02:32] me for well you want me to do around
[1:02:35] here
[1:02:36] Levin said you do God the same exact way
[1:02:38] if you want to know what God sets you
[1:02:39] here for you go back and ask him Lord
[1:02:41] what is that you want me to do why is
[1:02:44] that purpose how to do what you want me
[1:02:47] to do I want to follow your will you sit
[1:02:51] down you count the cost you take a look
[1:02:53] at what the real matters of life are all
[1:02:55] about and then real matters is what
[1:02:57] God's thought for you was but here in
[1:03:00] this judgment time God deals with
[1:03:03] everybody in the afterword according to
[1:03:06] their works well what a horrible thing
[1:03:08] that is we don't never want to stand
[1:03:10] there with our works in conference God
[1:03:13] the prophets said there's a conference
[1:03:14] where every man will meet every woman
[1:03:16] will meet a place selected and there'll
[1:03:18] be a great white throne judgment said he
[1:03:20] said now you may miss this conference
[1:03:22] this morning's on my church he said but
[1:03:24] you'll never me
[1:03:25] that one you may bypass all of them
[1:03:28] through your life you said but you'll
[1:03:29] never bypass that one Oh
[1:03:31] al l will appear before the judgment
[1:03:33] seat of Christ did you know the bride
[1:03:35] will even appear before she'll appear
[1:03:38] for rewards sake not for judgment we
[1:03:43] have to give an account for the life
[1:03:44] that God gave to us a man he said what
[1:03:47] were your stand me at that conference oh
[1:03:50] he said we'll have to give an account of
[1:03:52] everything notice this in Hebrews
[1:03:56] chapter 9 verse 27 he said it's
[1:03:58] appointed unto men once to die but after
[1:04:01] this the judgment of the words after
[1:04:03] this life then judgment awaits for every
[1:04:05] man woman they've got to give an account
[1:04:07] to God for everything they've ever done
[1:04:09] they've got to give an account to God
[1:04:11] for the life that he placed in their
[1:04:14] hands and here's the key of it Jesus
[1:04:17] give us the principle when he said and
[1:04:18] when a man seeks to save his life he'll
[1:04:21] lose it
[1:04:23] hallelujah come on somebody but if
[1:04:26] you'll seek to lose his life he'll save
[1:04:28] it in doing so oh well you see you see
[1:04:34] how Solomon was bringing out the
[1:04:35] principle that the Lord is our strong
[1:04:37] tower that you if you want to know
[1:04:39] what's right if you want to know what's
[1:04:41] true you've got to give away all of your
[1:04:43] human thinking you got to yield to his I
[1:04:48] tell you the hardest lesson for many
[1:04:52] Christians to learn and I mean it is the
[1:04:54] hardest lesson is the one that it seems
[1:04:57] to be the easiest which is let go and
[1:04:59] let God that's a tough one but if we're
[1:05:04] spiritual like we should be that is the
[1:05:06] that is the theme if you will of our
[1:05:09] walk with God let go and let him have
[1:05:11] control yes sir absolutely oh thank you
[1:05:16] Jesus
[1:05:17] all right I've been up here almost an
[1:05:19] hour now someone trying to wind down in
[1:05:20] just a little bit but you understand
[1:05:22] what I'm saying to you tonight all right
[1:05:24] second Peter chapter 2 verses 4 & 9 the
[1:05:27] Bible tells us that these angels that
[1:05:30] sent about the ones that fell with
[1:05:32] Lucifer in the beginning and cast them
[1:05:34] down to hell deliver them the chains of
[1:05:35] Darkness to be reserved verse 9 the
[1:05:39] Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly
[1:05:40] out of temptations and to reserve the
[1:05:44] unjust under the day of judgment to be
[1:05:46] punished so he reserves him penny man
[1:05:51] tells you there's a burning hell now but
[1:05:52] you believe you may know such thing as a
[1:05:53] burning hell now he's in a prison house
[1:05:57] and I said I don't believe that it's a
[1:05:59] burning hell but the prophet of God said
[1:06:01] in souls in prison
[1:06:03] God don't throw a man into a burning
[1:06:05] hell to judge him before he stood trial
[1:06:07] first he's got to stand trial oh I know
[1:06:13] the question well what about the rich
[1:06:14] man in that flame it didn't mean it was
[1:06:16] a natural flame it's symbolism he's
[1:06:20] talking about the torments brother BAM
[1:06:22] said it was such a terrible thing he's
[1:06:25] describing the same way brother Branham
[1:06:26] didn't when he had the vision he said if
[1:06:28] they would put hot pokers through my
[1:06:30] body he said would have been a bit of
[1:06:32] pleasure compared to what that was
[1:06:34] that's what the rich man was trying to
[1:06:35] say tell father Abraham to put it a cold
[1:06:39] drop of water you think a drop of water
[1:06:41] would have cooled the flames of hell
[1:06:44] he's given an example the King James
[1:06:47] Version and the English of the King
[1:06:49] James has given us an example of what
[1:06:50] this prison house is like and brother
[1:06:53] BAM said when he started to descend down
[1:06:55] into that realm he said it was a sickly
[1:06:57] smoke he smelled he said that's when
[1:07:00] them women came to them green eyes on
[1:07:02] who ooh
[1:07:03] who would like that and so forth cried
[1:07:07] matter he said there was no mama there
[1:07:08] cried daddy there was no daddy there I
[1:07:11] cried out Jesus there was no God there
[1:07:14] he said I was all alone falling with no
[1:07:16] bottom underneath me falling falling
[1:07:18] falling to prison house you think of the
[1:07:22] thousands that are event into that place
[1:07:24] since hell was created for the devil's
[1:07:27] in an angel there reserved just like you
[1:07:31] know when you go out to fancy restaurant
[1:07:33] you know they want you to reserve your
[1:07:34] place so they've got a table reserved is
[1:07:37] for you you walk in there isn't Jesse
[1:07:40] Smith oh yes come right this way mr.
[1:07:41] Smith they take the little card off the
[1:07:43] table and right there's your table God
[1:07:45] has got a place reserved for the unjust
[1:07:50] they have a special reservation all but
[1:07:53] here's what makes me dance and shout I
[1:07:54] do too but it ain't in hell it's in
[1:07:59] heavenly places with Christ Jesus
[1:08:01] but the problem said that is the
[1:08:03] position of the believer how it's
[1:08:06] reserved for the elect of God it's
[1:08:09] reserved for the Holy Spirit that has
[1:08:11] entered into the people of God we has a
[1:08:14] reservation as well God knows how to
[1:08:16] deliver us out of temptation he knows
[1:08:19] how to take us away from that in other
[1:08:21] words which would drag us to hell God
[1:08:23] knows how to deliver us from it hey man
[1:08:26] thank God he does some I said but rather
[1:08:30] be in don't you think they're being
[1:08:33] tormented in the flames now no if I
[1:08:35] believe what brother brems said and
[1:08:36] souls in prison I can't the lake of fire
[1:08:42] it falls after the judgment comes the
[1:08:45] RAM tells us what happens judgment is
[1:08:48] set up here on the earth the white
[1:08:49] throne mother Jesse sit right here on
[1:08:50] this earth and down from heaven comes
[1:08:53] holy fire but that holy fire mingles
[1:08:56] with the elements of the earth and it
[1:08:58] turns into a lake of fire this earth
[1:08:59] will burn as a lake of fire and the
[1:09:02] unjust will be thrown into this lake of
[1:09:04] fire it'll burn the earth all the way
[1:09:06] back to the elements right back to the
[1:09:08] very purity that it started from
[1:09:10] everything will burn back to its
[1:09:11] original way and sin forgot him that can
[1:09:14] destroy body you know the scripture but
[1:09:18] fear who who can take and destroy soul
[1:09:21] and body in hell and one way of looking
[1:09:25] at it hell as the grave hell is Hades
[1:09:26] that's true my body is in prison in the
[1:09:30] earth whenever I go and I die if I even
[1:09:34] don't go by the way the rapture if we
[1:09:36] don't go by the way the rapture when I
[1:09:38] die brother Jesse they'll take my body
[1:09:39] and they'll stick it in the ground
[1:09:41] my body is reserved it is imprisoned in
[1:09:44] Hades and I have no guarantee of ever
[1:09:48] getting out of there if I'm not born
[1:09:50] again to the Holy Spirit but here's what
[1:09:52] I like if I'm the Holy Ghost filled
[1:09:55] Christian whenever my body goes
[1:09:57] underneath this ground sure Satan may
[1:10:00] have had a claim on this body when I was
[1:10:02] a sinner but before I take my
[1:10:04] breath there's been a claim made on this
[1:10:06] body by the holy ghost and when I go
[1:10:09] down there's the spiritual little flag
[1:10:11] it says this property this is property
[1:10:13] of Jesus Christ Alleluia amen and how do
[1:10:16] I escape from hell because my Lord Jesus
[1:10:19] was imprisoned in Hades as well and his
[1:10:21] body released from Hell he defeated not
[1:10:24] only had itself but the grave as well he
[1:10:27] defeated this natural Hades because he
[1:10:29] lives I can live also a menace a
[1:10:34] reservation God reserved it for you and
[1:10:37] I Oh oh but you know two people living
[1:10:41] in torments and this not sure I believe
[1:10:43] they're in torment I don't say that if
[1:10:45] they go down to the regions of the loss
[1:10:46] or not in torment they're in torment to
[1:10:49] them you know it's a it's a horrible
[1:10:52] thing but the RAM said in one place tell
[1:10:54] metell was pressing he said the millions
[1:10:56] of souls that Elvis put there he said
[1:10:58] her morning around him and tormenting
[1:11:00] him all the time
[1:11:02] utilizing that I'm in this place your
[1:11:04] music is what put me here I'd rather
[1:11:08] talk about flames a fires it was a small
[1:11:12] thing compared to what they're having to
[1:11:15] suffer right now in that region here it
[1:11:17] is coming upon Christmas time the
[1:11:19] prophet of God said what if that bony
[1:11:21] frame could crawl into the church this
[1:11:22] morning and testify to us many years ago
[1:11:26] I preached a message I stole it from a
[1:11:29] guy named out of night he's a pastor in
[1:11:31] morgan's in North Carolina and he was
[1:11:33] preaching a message many years ago about
[1:11:34] the voices from hell I stole it
[1:11:37] I did it I stole it I stole the message
[1:11:38] I never come up with it was his idea and
[1:11:41] I said hey buddy you didn't copyright it
[1:11:44] so I'm taking it hey I remember him
[1:11:48] talking about when he be in those youth
[1:11:49] camps and be preaching to young people
[1:11:51] and he'd start calling up people to
[1:11:53] testify out of hell I took this message
[1:11:56] some time ago a little spot out there
[1:11:58] and I was preaching to some people and
[1:12:00] so I just started I was acting out all
[1:12:03] the parts and so what I said now we call
[1:12:05] Evers Presley and I became Elvis you see
[1:12:07] I just talked like Elvis like I was
[1:12:09] talking I did my part we got after the
[1:12:11] meeting this other boy this old boy
[1:12:12] walked up was shaking me by the hair so
[1:12:14] I thought that was you know was
[1:12:17] the pastor said he's not Elvis Presley
[1:12:21] he was acting out that he was homeless
[1:12:23] Presley I laughed at him but I stood
[1:12:29] there and I thought if these men could
[1:12:32] testify Marilyn and the rest of them
[1:12:34] could testify what would they tell us
[1:12:37] stand right here in this church and they
[1:12:40] tell us young people they tell us older
[1:12:41] people they tell us middle-aged people
[1:12:42] whatever you do accept your opportunity
[1:12:45] if your sins come open now
[1:12:47] let them come open hey man if God wants
[1:12:51] to deal with you because you don't want
[1:12:56] to come to this place what if we called
[1:13:00] up one of the main ones that we read
[1:13:03] about in the Bible the rich young ruler
[1:13:04] lifts his hell is lifted his eyes up in
[1:13:08] hell rather levan takes the text and
[1:13:11] then he cried he said that's right and
[1:13:12] then he cried yes lift his eyes up in
[1:13:15] hell but really when to sit on the earth
[1:13:16] there was a different picture given some
[1:13:19] Pharisees standing there saying oh this
[1:13:21] good old brother he believed the message
[1:13:23] all the days of his life
[1:13:24] he gave and gave and gave and gave he
[1:13:29] sure did but he also took and took and
[1:13:31] took and took until the Bible said in
[1:13:34] another place he said to himself so take
[1:13:38] your rest take your ease the voice come
[1:13:43] back to him this day your soul will be
[1:13:47] required of you God's taking it
[1:13:50] seriously brother whether we are not we
[1:13:54] may not sense him we may not feel him we
[1:13:56] may not seem we meant noise around but
[1:13:58] God's taking it seriously whether we are
[1:13:59] not what we do in this life God's given
[1:14:04] us the understanding now I'm coming to
[1:14:06] my text here and then we're going to
[1:14:07] quit the reason the bride don't go
[1:14:09] through judgment all these other parts
[1:14:11] more they make you kindly sad a little
[1:14:12] bit that's kind of what I want you to be
[1:14:14] I want you to be a little sad I want you
[1:14:17] thank God this sorrow works repentance
[1:14:19] but the reason that the bride doesn't go
[1:14:22] through judgment y'all ready y'all ready
[1:14:24] for this
[1:14:25] the reason the bride doesn't go through
[1:14:27] judgment is because the Prophet said the
[1:14:29] Bible said the
[1:14:30] word of god says we were already judged
[1:14:34] in Jesus Christ at Calvary Oh hallelujah
[1:14:40] brother branham said if I'm a part of
[1:14:43] Christ when he died I died in him here's
[1:14:49] another reason notice again in John he
[1:14:53] said if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:14:55] the light the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:57] cleanses us from all sin and we have
[1:15:00] fellowship one with another method Jesse
[1:15:03] quoted this morning at a st. John there
[1:15:05] are in the general epistle first John we
[1:15:08] talked about he that is born of God
[1:15:11] cannot commit sin for his seed remains
[1:15:13] in him that's right on the flesh body
[1:15:15] the outside man he's a sinner he's
[1:15:17] always going to be a sinner don't try to
[1:15:19] change him that's what he is
[1:15:21] listen you can drag his body the altar
[1:15:23] every day but the body ain't gonna get
[1:15:24] saved it's gonna take the resurrection
[1:15:26] rapture to do that I can drag him into a
[1:15:30] prayer closet I can make him look at the
[1:15:32] Bible but he don't know eaten he's never
[1:15:34] and nor does he want to be saved
[1:15:36] he's of the evil one Amen that's why
[1:15:39] when the body says I ain't going to
[1:15:40] church I'm tired tonight as I shut your
[1:15:42] mouth you ain't in charge Amen I tell me
[1:15:45] you're going to church whether you like
[1:15:46] it or not come on somebody a man a this
[1:15:49] body is a sinner it doesn't want to live
[1:15:52] right it doesn't want to live holy but
[1:15:57] that part of my soul that's been
[1:16:00] redeemed glory to God that part that's
[1:16:06] been touched by the Holy Ghost
[1:16:09] it is so sinless that not even God can
[1:16:14] see an ounce of sinner in me I have been
[1:16:28] described the Holy Ghost and fire has
[1:16:31] burnt away any remnant of what I used to
[1:16:36] be
[1:16:39] now I need a body to match my soul in
[1:16:45] this body there may be tattoos I don't
[1:16:48] have any but somebody may have been a
[1:16:50] tattoo thing when they was in the world
[1:16:51] girls or boys like may have holes in
[1:16:54] their ears they may have scars from will
[1:16:58] use to get knife fights and bars and
[1:17:00] everything like that sometimes I see
[1:17:02] this girl right here I hit the habit of
[1:17:04] beer bottle 1942 whatever it is but when
[1:17:08] their bodies are changed God will take
[1:17:11] away all of them holes God will take
[1:17:14] away the beer bottle cut not only that
[1:17:17] brother Jesse but he'll take away from
[1:17:18] us every strain every temper every less
[1:17:22] thing every impatient thing anything
[1:17:25] ungodly that was handed down to us in
[1:17:27] this first birth got a life out of it
[1:17:29] God as though it never was in there in
[1:17:31] the first place
[1:17:32] friends do you understand when we get to
[1:17:34] the other side do you realize the reason
[1:17:36] why that the bride can no longer ever
[1:17:39] dwell in sin is because there's nothing
[1:17:41] in her to sin with excuse his sisters
[1:17:44] but the prophet of God said he even
[1:17:46] takes the sex organs and the sex glands
[1:17:48] those are gone after we get changed
[1:17:50] hey listen brother sister there's glands
[1:17:53] in your lips girls that's the reason why
[1:17:55] and boy notice boy and girls plural and
[1:17:59] then one I told him a day I realized why
[1:18:01] nevermind he's outnumbered I'll say that
[1:18:06] much let the cat out of the bag that's
[1:18:13] the reason you're not supposed to kiss
[1:18:15] because you got glands in your lips and
[1:18:17] it's a potential sex act when you cross
[1:18:20] them lips and touch the lips together
[1:18:23] then glands cross over potentially it's
[1:18:24] a sex act God will hold you accountable
[1:18:26] for things right but when our bodies are
[1:18:30] changed there won't be one remnant of
[1:18:33] anything sexual in our bodies meaning
[1:18:37] that the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:18:38] evil will be completely done away with
[1:18:42] we'd never be able to partake of a tree
[1:18:44] that never existed got a wipeout as
[1:18:51] though it never took place in the
[1:18:53] beginning
[1:18:54] that's real redemption for us right
[1:18:58] the reason the bride don't go through
[1:19:00] judgment another reason because the
[1:19:02] blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed her
[1:19:04] of all of her sin amen
[1:19:07] another reason the bride don't go
[1:19:09] through judgment is because her name was
[1:19:10] on his book before the foundation of the
[1:19:13] world
[1:19:14] the prophet of God said that Jesus
[1:19:16] Christ dipped his finger in his side and
[1:19:18] these are all symbols but they mean
[1:19:19] something you dipped his finger in his
[1:19:21] side he wrote with the blood of Jesus
[1:19:23] Christ the name of Jesus Christ on the
[1:19:25] last girl I said his name was the first
[1:19:26] name that went down well it's his book I
[1:19:28] reckon he oughta put his name in it and
[1:19:30] they said the bride member was every
[1:19:33] bride member was placed subsequently
[1:19:34] underneath those names just one after
[1:19:36] another after another in their Road in
[1:19:38] the blood of Jesus Christ when was a
[1:19:39] having it it happened when he was slain
[1:19:41] before the foundation of the world your
[1:19:43] name didn't go down there the day you
[1:19:44] got saved it was there already before
[1:19:46] you got saved that's the reason you
[1:19:47] could get saved because it was already
[1:19:49] there but greater than that those names
[1:19:52] that were identified with the Lamb those
[1:19:55] were sinless individuals from the
[1:19:58] beginning oh oh oh but you say they come
[1:20:04] into time and they've done some sin and
[1:20:06] sure they did but once they get wrapped
[1:20:08] back around and what that book said
[1:20:10] about them God don't see that other part
[1:20:12] I ran notice I love this remark right
[1:20:20] here but I'm talking here in the
[1:20:23] questions and answers he said the church
[1:20:25] the lukewarm anything outside of the
[1:20:27] elected bribe will go through the
[1:20:28] tribulation they're not raised in the
[1:20:30] first resurrection the rest of the Dead
[1:20:32] lived not for a thousand years just the
[1:20:33] foreordained predestinated elected
[1:20:36] bribed by God's own elections who is it
[1:20:38] ready ma'am I don't know I can't tell
[1:20:39] you but I know it's going to be there
[1:20:41] because the Lord said they would there
[1:20:43] are the ones that will go through the
[1:20:44] tribulation because the rest of them
[1:20:46] will go through the tribulation they'll
[1:20:48] go down and then killed before the
[1:20:49] Millenium and the righteous will come
[1:20:51] out on the Millenium out in the
[1:20:52] Millenium rather and live a thousand
[1:20:54] years after the
[1:20:55] thousand years there'll be a great white
[1:20:57] throne judgement calm and dead both
[1:20:59] riding ron was raised up the books are
[1:21:01] open the book of life is open and the
[1:21:04] Saints the wife and the husband fully
[1:21:07] they'll set and judge the world and why
[1:21:15] because you were a part of him before
[1:21:19] the foundation world let me say
[1:21:20] something as I close I know you're tired
[1:21:22] you got work in the morning and I'm
[1:21:24] tired too and I didn't have to work
[1:21:26] tomorrow my work tomorrow is my Sabbath
[1:21:27] they may I say that but it ain't true I
[1:21:32] got to work with these kids I got school
[1:21:34] tomorrow but I'm gonna say this to you
[1:21:38] imma quit this is the reason why you can
[1:21:41] repent this is the reason why you have
[1:21:45] that tender Spirit in your heart this is
[1:21:47] the reason why no matter how hard you
[1:21:49] get or how aggravated or how frustrated
[1:21:51] or how backslide you might get in your
[1:21:52] lifetime that's the reason somebody is
[1:21:54] always a pulling on you that's why
[1:21:58] somebody's always keeping you from going
[1:21:59] too far when you could take that next
[1:22:01] step that next step you'd be a goner
[1:22:03] something keeps you from taking that
[1:22:04] next step what does that God's Amazing
[1:22:09] Grace he saw a bride he saw who she was
[1:22:13] where she came from where she was going
[1:22:15] he saw that she'd be a part of him
[1:22:17] Alleluia just like my little daughter
[1:22:20] there Annelise just like these young uns
[1:22:22] here when Jesse was on the football
[1:22:25] field throwing touchdowns a man when I
[1:22:30] was out on a skateboard riding around
[1:22:32] BMX and freestyling hard to believe I
[1:22:35] did it but I did it son I on the outside
[1:22:42] it was me but there were attributes on
[1:22:46] the inside of me my girls were living
[1:22:49] inside of here couldn't see him couldn't
[1:22:52] fellowship with them but they were right
[1:22:54] here my children was in me this is the
[1:22:57] reason the bride don't go through
[1:22:58] judgment because she is him he is her
[1:23:03] there one not two there one
[1:23:08] for the bride and the groom is joined
[1:23:10] together what do we say at weddings I
[1:23:12] now pronounce you man and wife
[1:23:14] that the Twain will be one flesh this is
[1:23:18] the reason the bride can't go through
[1:23:19] judgment because God can't judge himself
[1:23:21] and if you're a part of him and you are
[1:23:24] him he can't judge you either woo how
[1:23:29] some of y'all are sitting still right
[1:23:30] now I don't know I'm about to run away
[1:23:33] that's the reason God can't judge us
[1:23:37] because we're a party Oh glory stand
[1:23:43] with me oh thank you Jesus thank you
[1:23:49] Jesus but there is a reckoning day
[1:23:53] coming someday Paul said in first
[1:23:55] Corinthians six no you're not the Saints
[1:23:57] well judge the world you see the real
[1:24:05] bride of Jesus Christ I mean the real
[1:24:08] one yes she's been touched by the hand
[1:24:11] of Almighty God and brother once he
[1:24:15] touches you there ain't nobody can
[1:24:17] untouched what he's touched remember
[1:24:21] what he said about doors he said I open
[1:24:24] things that no man can shut him and then
[1:24:26] I shut things no man can open what's
[1:24:29] he's moved on you
[1:24:29] there ain't no unmoving it what Scott
[1:24:32] deals with you
[1:24:33] there ain't no underling whatever he
[1:24:36] does it was for a purpose it was for a
[1:24:39] reason God helped me to always listen
[1:24:42] help me to always be sensitive help me
[1:24:44] to feel help me to see
[1:24:46] help me to thank help me to believe
[1:24:48] whatever advance you make upon my heart
[1:24:51] help me God to be receptive help me that
[1:24:54] I can listen and be sensitive oh you say
[1:24:58] you preaching this and all of us are
[1:24:59] saved just saying I'm not talking about
[1:25:01] getting a brother I'm talking about
[1:25:03] staying saved because let's face facts
[1:25:08] time makes you hard experiences make you
[1:25:13] hard you see a lot of things you
[1:25:17] experienced a lot of things it puts a
[1:25:19] little something in you you know you're
[1:25:20] gun-shy
[1:25:21] you know you've been hurt by people that
[1:25:23] you trusted it's a little harder to
[1:25:25] trust that person next time around you
[1:25:27] know I'm talking about sometimes you
[1:25:29] just it's hard it's hard to get that in
[1:25:31] your brain well I'd like to trust them
[1:25:33] but I remember that situation that one
[1:25:35] time God helped me Lord no matter what
[1:25:41] experiences I have helped me to remain
[1:25:43] sensitive at any time you move on my
[1:25:47] heart any time you deal with me that I
[1:25:49] could be ready
[1:25:50] I could be listening and I could be
[1:25:53] repented and repented that I can be
[1:25:57] responsive and that I could be touchable
[1:26:01] and teachable can we pray together with
[1:26:07] your heads bowed today I want you to
[1:26:09] think over your life just a moment I see
[1:26:15] them I see a real blessing and what's
[1:26:17] been brought today
[1:26:19] because I realized that as hard as some
[1:26:26] of these things sound they're a blessing
[1:26:29] to a Christians life because it means
[1:26:32] God loves us enough to talk to us and
[1:26:33] say hey I want you to think about who
[1:26:36] you are I want you to judge your
[1:26:39] attitude judge your responses thank you
[1:26:43] Lord for that
[1:26:44] thank you Lord now with your heads bowed
[1:26:48] if you just like to take just a moment
[1:26:52] and talk to the Lord and say God I just
[1:26:55] want you to know Lord that if you got a
[1:26:58] deal with me on anything I want to be
[1:26:59] dealt with here I don't want anything to
[1:27:02] meet me at the river I want to be
