Jesus praise the Lord Jesus so good to be in the Lord's house this evening amen amen we got uh just a lovely day of Fellowship around the word with the Lord Jesus just just shut in with God Amen secret and and just enjoyed the day to be uh Den presence and praise God not to say that we didn't have a few battles with the devil along the way Devil's never going to leave you alone that's right right and so we just uh we just realize that he's uh always about his business but it's good for us to be about the father's business amen praise the lord well I'm sure we realize we were just a few in this evening but uh that doesn't bother me none at all amen man I cut my teeth preaching to a congregation about this size right here and uh so we we know all about uh it's not going to affect my attitude at all matter of fact sometimes the Lord comes in special way when we're just a few like this and so if I get down amongst you he's got me on kind of a short leash here that's and I always was taught that if you put a dog on a short leash makes it mean so if I get mean it's it's not my fault and uh so but we just we know if you if you uh say Amen to the preacher why it six him on the devil right right right so that's our job this evening is to to root out the enemy and that Jesus said he came came to destroy the works of the [Music] devil and we've come to continue in that Worden praise God I would like for you to turn with me into the Book of Proverbs Chapter 6 as you're making your way there I'll uh I'll give some disclaimer to this passage of scripture not that we need to make excuse for the Bible but uh we read realize that uh sometimes when we read a text that it could be uh uh you know people get preconceived ideas from the very beginning but trust me we have a we have a direction where we're going and so and I realize you know we don't we're not preaching to the the world out out about us but we look at our congregation and we and we preached to who's sitting here yes sir yes sir don't uh don't be alarmed at the text just follow along all right amen amen we'll begin reading at verse 27 Proverbs Chapter 6 and verse 27 can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned so he that goeth into to his neighbor's wife whosoever touches her shall not be innocent right men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he's hungry but if he be found he shall restore Sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house but who so committeth adultery with a woman lackthe it destroys his own soul a wound and a dishonor shall he get and his reproach shall not we WIP away yes sir let's pray together Heavenly Father here this evening We Gather in that name that is above every name Hallelujah Lord we stand behind this sacred Podium realizing oh God that what we would say to the people Lord that we will be held accountable for at the day of judgment Lord we realize that this is not just peoples or a congregation yes but this is the very purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ would be ever so careful Lord not to say anything that would that would hinder them hurt them in any way but Lord we would pray that you would give us the words of eternal life Lord that it would stir their hearts oh God Lord that there would be such a a a moving of your spirit amongst us oh God that when would leave this place our hearts would be as those from emus and say did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way and we would pray father that it would not be the lips or the thoughts of a man Lord that it would that it would be the unfailing body word of the son of man Lord that would speak to our hearts this evening Lord yes we pray God that your grace would come cover all of our sins for we lord have all sinned and come short of the glory of God lord and I stand as the chiefest of Sinners Lord father I'm just looking to you this evening for the for the grace Lord to to move forward into this thought and to speak Lord those things which are needful in the hour that we live help us oh God we ask in Jesus lovely name we pray amen amen amen God bless you friends have your seats this evening and we're just uh would we're going to title our message for the sake of the recording that we're going to T we're going to title it fire and there a subtitle scars of Disobedience amen scars of Disobedience and I came to this thought few years back I was ministering for a little congregation about this size and I went over to the pastor's house that evening he we got to talking and we had old acquaintance renew I had first met them actually the first time I ever met the brother was down in Logan Ohio by the way and uh uh little brother Joel PTZ and uh good friend of mine and and we uh became quite good friends and so we were together one evening and fellowshipping and you know how brothers would get together and well I had a an experience like this one time and he had an experience and we realized that we were both of the uh had experience and he at that time was presently a member of a volunteer fire department and I had told him about some firefighting experience that I had had and we went back and forth and and I was telling him about uh fighting some fires up in Montana big forest fires and what more he began to tell me about some of the things that he had and he said hey I want you to see a website and so we went up to his office there and he pulled up a website and he started showing me uh you know some uh very interesting things about new fire fighting equipment you know and you know how uh you know us Brothers we like things with a lot of Chrome on it you know and so he would showing me one of these uh uh new uh uh ladder trucks and and uh some new pumper equipment and then he was showing me some exhibitionary type uh uh firefighting equipment trck fire trucks that had been uh basically had been high performance souped up and put on the drag strip for uh exhibitionary purposes to uh earn money for the they did exhibitions for to raise money for the local uh volunteer fire departments oh my we're just admiring all this red paint and chrome and you know and bells and whistles and so we were really interested in these things and then he said man you got to see this and so he he took me over to a he put it on a a a a training video and uh now i' I've been in the Marine Corps and I've experienced a lot of you know a lot of training videos and safety videos and things like that where you know you kind of expect to see uh you know dramatization of some kind of a mistake that was made and you know the guy dropping the hammer and it coning somebody on the head and you know and thankfully he had hard hat on you know that kind of thing and but this was a a a an actual fire that had actually taken place and and so uh the fire is is a big Warehouse type building and they bring a big fire truck up there and we're just watching the video and uh big uh extension ladder goes out over the top of the building and there's a superintendent there you can tell he's like the chief or something like that he gets two of his his uh veterans no doubt to put him in this situation and takes him up the ladder well they're in full uh dress you know full helmet and mask and and all their firefighting equipment and he's got a helmet and his and his walkie talkie in his hand and he runs up the ladder and and he's just kind of got his shirt sleeves on you know and he gets up to the top of the ladder and he's pointing out some things and it's like he's giving some final instructions and then as he gives these final instructions you know it's like he's going to turn to go back down back down to command and at that very moment the roof of that building it fell in and an Inferno come up out of that uh uh uh building and engulf those three men over that ladder and I was just shocked I was like I didn't want to see that you know just and and and and but it was one of those it was transfixed I couldn't take my eyes off of the video and I watched those three men burn alive as the camera zoomed in on him it was horrific most unbelievable thing I I was shocked I was I was I was scarred instantly I could to this very moment I closed my eyes and man I could still see the pain the the the the the the over those men that were overcome by the flames and that burned their bodies and they fell and they were they were just convulsing in pain and I was shocked I I stepped back I said oh brother you could have went a long time without showing me that right I wasn't expecting to see that I didn't and it it left a mark yes scar just a video like that yes to see something like that and it left this Scar and I I I shook myself and and I wasn't mad at the brother and but you know I just I was like no nobody should see something like that amen yes sir I'm sure it has its place in the right environment and things like that but did it just caught me so off guard yes sir and so I I I just I I I just told the brother I'm going to have to go CU I had to preach the next morning and so I went home back to the hotel my wife she hadn't seen it my wife she quickly was in the arms of Morpheus the god of Dreams she was gone into the land of the etheral but I would lay there and torment then every time I would close my eyes I just seen those men dying my brothers firefighters they were dying and I didn't want to see that I want I wanted it erased for my mind but it was too late right fire had come into my bosom so to speak right right my eyes had seen it there's it's amazing thing our eyes and our mind are photographic that way yes sir and so I I I just I I just laid there in torment and finally I just got up and I went to prayer lay I was just kneeling there at the the chair and and it was as just a a if you could imagine just like a presence like a breeze just came in the room and I felt a peace piece that I couldn't manufacture on my own I was in torment up to this very moment and this piece dropped down and I heard heard these words just as plain as anything can man take fire in his bosom right has clothes not be burned and I knew it was in the Bible but I didn't know where not too good with that with chapter and verse but I remembered it being in the Bible so I went quickly and looked at my concordance and I found the Bible verse and I read it and as I was reading this Bible verse I I I I was on my computer and I I clicked on a uh commentary and it it it gave me this thought that that said that fire is uh uh it said that the it said it actually gave this this example that in Africa that they believe or they the tribes teach there they're children that fire is like an animal and that the animal would actually consume its victim and then die with its victim after it has consumed all the wood and that because the fire has all these characteristics of something that is alive right and I read this in the commentary I said isn't that striking and as I read that and I and I thought but it's talking about adultery and we can equate that with sin right yes we can equate that with with the enemy of our souls and so we realize that it goes back to the original sin right goes back to and so we begin to speak and think that fire is light life like yes but yet in order science tells us that there are certain characteristics that uh uh that that something has to have in order to be aive right and fire has I think there's five characteristics that something has to have in order to have life and and but fire is lacking in one area it's like a virus is not really a life it's lacking it requires something it requires a host in order to be a life and fire is likewise it requires a fuel it requires a matter in order to and and it attaches itself to that in order to become lifelike and so we see that sin also right that it as it is not life for the Bible says that that sin is equated to death amen and so now in sin and fire now take on this harmonious existence yeah right so that you can see one when you see the other you can understand the effects of of of of sin when you can understand the effects of fire right right right and so it's lifik but yet it is the enemy to all life right stay with me that here's fire is life like yet it is the enemy to All Life water in a flood can come through and many things will die the deer die the squirrels die many things but alligators don't die right frogs don't die Turtles don't die but the water kills all these other things but yet these other things they live but fire comes everything dies amen trees die plants die grass dies animals die people die everything dies and so is it when sin comes When sin entered into the world then death entered into the world it was the first thing that entered in after sin entered into the Garden of Eden when a man took another man's wife right right right and now then it left this scar on Humanity that every one of us bear sir you say we we bear the we bear the scar of the original sin right yes sir because now we're born of a woman right and we all got a belly button right it tells us that we're that we're under the curse of of sin you see and so when Adam took fire into his bosom you say did Adam take fire his bosom exactly brother tells us that the law of God of Moses was in effect even all the way back in the Garden of Eden right right and so that we realize that when they mingled the seeds that the woman went out for the protection of her husband that he was not to take her back right right but he said he went to her took her back because he loved her and with knowledge plunged the whole earth into sin and death right right oh my amen so now it's lifik it's like an animal that could consume whatever could catch and then died with its victim we see that fire doesn't stay in one place you start a fire it will spread yes sir it'll move out it'll it'll attach itself to anything it can catch it's lifelike it has a voice hisses like a snake right pops and makes noise it it it it it has a tongue that's right you see that's right fire has a tongue it it it has it consumes things now it it completely consumes takes it back to its carbon particles all the way back it it converts whatever it attaches itself too it converts it into what it is right so when fire attaches itself that that eventually it wouldn't just go away and leave us a Pulpit here this looks like an old Naughty Pine pull pit it would get onto this thing and burn but when it was done we wouldn't have a pull pit anymore right we might have a pull pit in a million years after it all goes back and went back into the seed and come back grow us another tree and we cut it down make another pull pit out of it who would be here to see it you see so it consumes and turns it into fire itself yes and when it's finished what it started is ruined it's ruination it's destroyed I remember when we were fighting fire at Montana it's called the foxy fire and this this fire we we were just doing mop up we weren't actually the ones that were jumping into the fire we kind of come in from behind the back and we did a lot of the mop up you know make sure that it didn't start another fire somewhere else and so the fire had jumped the fire lines and had come into another area so we all got in the truck and we're driving around and we got to the other side of the ridge this big canyons and mountains red mountainous area bitteroot Valley we came around we we saw the fire as it was on the other side of the mountain and but we can see that it was pushing up this smoke and debris was on the other side of the mountain and we could tell by the way that the fire was acting that they it's what they call crowned out that it had actually come to its its uh Zenith it was as hot as it could get and the the fire was actually moving they estimated somewhere around 20 miles an hour and this fire was moving it came over the top of the hill we watched it as it came over the top of the hill there was huge 100 foot pine trees big giant virgin Pine Forest as this fire would run down through that Pine Forest those trees would explode because they're full of uh turpentine they're full of a sap and that sap is what makes turpentine or paint thinner it's very flammable and so that Pine carar would explode inside of those trees it would be super heated instantly and those trees would explode and blow fire and smoke 200 feet over the top of the tree canopy it was the most amazing wall of fire that you could ever imagine moving 20 miles an hour off of that mountain we were over a mile away and we were having it was like we were standing next to a blast furnace incredible but it moved off of that mountain and in just a minute what was a beautiful green beautiful forest in a few minutes was Jarred black twigs and burnt remains nothing left right right just in a few minutes yes sir brother B tells us a [Music] story I got several little episodes I'd like to tell we find that I I know a man I don't know all the details how the brother was burned but I've known him for many years and he he he he carries some very very ugly burned scars on his body and way up his arms and his legs and his hands but from what I understood was that he was that time he was running from the Lord and it was actually an opportunity to make some money quick money but in order to do it he would have to commit a horrible crime and as he was actually in a meeting with some other men to make the arrangements to get paid off to go and do this crime there was a leak on a propane bottle out underneath the mobile home where they were at the furnace kicked in and when the pilot light lit and the furnace kicked on it ignited all that propane around the building and he was wearing some uh you know just a polyester type shirt and trousers that fire instantly ignited his clothes and burned them off his body just within a second and it put third and fourth degree burns over his entire body went into his lungs and left him in ICU for many days and burnt hands and his arms and to this day every time that that brother looks and sees those scars on his body he knew that he got those scars because of the crimes that he was about to commit right and that it was just a hand of God that had laid those scars upon him to prevent him from even taken another man's life right and God had actually protected him but those scars that he bore looked like God's judgment upon him but they actually were his protection right that's true and that later it was through this horrible accident that actually led to his conversion amen so that he could see the scars of his Disobedience right that he had taken this fire into his bosom this this desire to commit a horrible crime but yet it left the scar friends and oh let me tell you amen when we when we get outside of the program of God oh you may not come away with horrible burn scars that everybody else can see but there'll be scars there will be a mark that'll be L there scars that I bear today because of rebellion and things that I did as a child and things that my parents did they left marks on me yes sir that's true as far as I know my mother never laid a hand on me in anger I got a few switchings in my life there were never nothing serious my stepfather never hurt me physically but both of them left filthy pornographic material laying around our home as a child until this very hour I remember things that I saw when I was just a little boy things that I heard my mother saying things that I heard my mother and father do amen as a child that left marks and scars into my spirit that I can never erase as long as I live yes sir those weren't my Disobedience it was theirs right and we find that our Disobedience will leave a scar somewhere yes it's to leave a scar somewhere oh parents leave scars on their children husbands leave scars on their wives wives leave scars on their husbands amen we make scars on our brothers pastors leave scars on their congregation the congregation leave scars on the pastor amen but when it all said and done we realized amen that it was our Disobedience that left the stars in the hands of Jesus yes amen he wears the scars of my Disobedience Hallelujah yes I said oh Jesus how is it possible yes that's true I won't keep us long this evening but my clock said it's only 4:08 so I'll try to I'll try to find the right time we haven't started yet oh think about it friends where are we this evening we realize that as fire does these things so does sin amen that's true sin is the enemy of all life yes sin spreads yes right so many times people think that they can hide their sins the Bible says know you not oh man that your sin shall surely find you out amen Bible says that talks about the Disobedience of men that some it comes before them and others it comes behind right yes yes it sin spreads how many times have we s that a that a father will will will take a casual drink or will be a h you know just a maybe just a be a chain smoker and and and will whip his boys if they drink whip his boys if they smoke scold them and discipline them with everything that all the wrath of a father right and yet he's guilty himself that never it never stays localized right sin never stays localized it won't stay localized in a in in an individual it'll spread out amen that's even sometimes brother ra said unconsciously right yes sir and so it consumes sin will just not you know affect one little part of the body yes you know woman that just wants to maybe just paint her toenails just because maybe she thinks it's attractive or whatever it won't won be long till she be showing those sh those toenails off right right it won't be long until it'll move from her toenails to her fingernail that's right yes after a little while she'll it spreads you see it won't just stay there and after a little while it'll get over on her daughters right right brother right but pastor's family has a sin it won't be very long till that sin will be through the whole church right brother right why because sin is not going to stay in one place it's like fire that's true it consumes it'll turn the whole individual into that very sin you say oh if I've sinned am I am I doomed no amen that's why we have firemen right amen they're there to put the fire out amen that's why we had the gospel amen why the Bible types the word of God is water amen amen so we can we can always quench the and stop the fire before it gets too far by by by applying the very word of God that area of our life and and and and stop that thing Hallelujah was tomorrow will be the anniversary of our 911 attack on the Twin Towers I was there at Ground Zero here a while back and I I saw that great cavernous hole down where they had dug all the way down in the bottom to pull all the debris and everything out of there I remember what the buildings looked like and pictures and what more and that the fact that they could all come crashing down in a moment is not so I mean it was horrific 3,000 Souls lose their lives but the part that got me the part that just stirred me was when I turned and there was a little fire substation right there on the corner of ground zero and on that substation it showed the pictures and had a bronze plaque of each one of the men that had given their life across the street all right and and something in my heart just said well what would cause a man knowing that that building was going to come crashing down knowing that there was flames and and and and Airplane Fuel and dead bodies and all these things that were that were falling all around what would cause that man to run into that fire it just came to me because there was a bigger fire burning inside of here than there was in there it was a bashing of fire that was that was kindled in his soul to save lives and I began to think to myself you know that that's the very thing amen that burns in the heart of every gospel preacher that he would run into the into the Flames of sin that he would condemn Satan at every turn even though in himself he realized a his vulnerability and realized that in himself there's many human weaknesses but yet he would be able to call out sin and preach against a Le souls to Christ hallelujah oh my it destroys I tell a little story about a some of this is from personal experience and so then others from a I think I saw something on a on a uh I think it was maybe a Little House on the Prairie something like that I it was I think Laura Les tells part of the story I think that's where I got it a little bit of is but I I just it's just a story the names have been changed to protect the or the guilty but back in the day in the times of the settlers they were coming out to the West when they would come into an area they wouldn't build them a house first first thing they did they built a barn and then in that Barn they lived in that Barn right along with the chickens and the cows and the Hogs horses right and then they would go and dig them a little Dugout and put a roof over it then they would go live in The Dugout the cows and the chickens and the Hogs and the horses would live in this nice big barn and seemed logical but that was their only way of survival and so it was It was kind of the centerpiece of the of the homestead was the barn it's where they kept the F for the animals it's where they kept their canned goods for their for their own consumption so they kept their tools their animals it protection from the harsh winter the summer the wind the barn was the most stable structure on the build on the on the property because it was all their living revolved around the barn yes yes so there was a little family that they had homesteaded they had built a nice big barn and they had several cows and a couple of nice draft horses and implements and they were doing quite well for themselves had a nice little farm going had some cattle they built him a little house and everything was going quite well the family had one little boy and the tradition was that when they would the end of the week or whenever they would load up a wagon and maybe have some extra corn that they had harvested or maybe they had some potatoes that they had dug extra eggs maybe some cream whatever that they had been able to Surplus they been able to gather at the end of the month and they would carry that into the little town not too far and as they would go into the little town then there would be some trading with go yes it TR the dad would take maybe some of his you know things maybe he had made some wagon wheels or or he had maybe cut a little extra cordwood or whatever the case might have been right he would go over and he would trade with the men the mother she would take maybe some canned goods and maybe some vegetables that she had took out took out of the garden maybe some extra dress or something that she had stitched up she'd go and trade that and so the women would get over here they would do their trading men would get over here and they do their trading and so after all the trading was done and dad had bought all of his goods and loaded up his wagon and he had his flour and his feed and his coffee and his sugar and maybe extra seed and extra ax handle or two or whatever that he had need of mother she would come with her you know with her uh you know with whatever she had need of and goods and what more maybe extra Skillet or something you know and they'd come and they'd put it all in the wagon and then had a little extra time and maybe if Dad had a few extra coins he'd go his a little boy a big old long Licorice Whip or something like that he could chew on does he like licorice real good black licorice the best kind amen I guess I'm the only one likes well I can eat a lot of them and so then and then mother you know she'd go over with the women they'd all sit around maybe they'd be stitching on a quilt or something and they'd get to cackle in like a bunch of chickens it's what hens do you know they just C can't ever shut them up they just go and go but then you know the men they all get over there you know what they do they Crow the men they get over there and they Crow what they're doing they're bragging and you know maybe dad you got he they got over there they pass the old jug around a few times maybe one old man stuff him a pip full of tobacco and he smoke his pipe and another roll him a cigarette and have him a cigar other pulling a big plug of the backer off and there was a chewing and a smoking and a spitting well you can't get a bunch of men like that together very long before they go to cussing and then they go to lying right right they go to telling tall tales and all these little things and what was going on the whole time was that little boy sitting right and he was hearing all the things that they were saying learning all those new words words right right learning all that new behavior and after a little while he got that licorice in the back of his jaw yeah chewing on that black liquor and when he had spit it looked like tobacker juice so he had spitting and he was s around there listen at them men grow after a little while Dad load up in the wagon it all go back to the farm right well after a little while you know little boy he gets a thinking up there in the barn and get back in the Loft kick the hay out that there was this little little they got video games now back then little boys had to use her imagination so he got up there and he got to talking and he got him some stick pistols and he got him a gunfight up there and he had to battle at the h k Corral and Oh my he was riding and fighting engin and everything else and he was a he got there wrestling with the dog and you know and he was a fighting and everything and he was a fighting a big old Grizzly bar and you know he was having him a a Time little imagination and he got him a big old piece of hey there big piece of straw and he put it in his mouth and got to thinking hey if I let this on fire and so he went into the house and he stole some of his money his matches went out there and he struck a match and LD it on that piece of straw he could pull on that straw and he' get a little smoke come out of his nose then all of a sudden mama called him and so he put that little thing on he hit it and he covered up his sin right and he went back in the house boy he really got away with that well the next day he got up there and he thought hey I'm going to go do that again and the next day he went did it again but one day little tiny little spark fell down in the boards of that old attic that old barn down in that fine dust that fine dust is very very flammable and he didn't realize it and so he kicked The Hil over everything he hit a sin for one more time thinking I'll get away with it again and he runs to the house to eat his supper and before he could get to the house he see smoke coming out of the top of the bar and it was out in the west and it's real dry and the wind was blowing and just in a few seconds what had started out as the most insignificant little spark right had fallen down and had turned into a raging Inferno and the whole Barn was engulfed and it burn burnt the bar it burnt the chickens it burnt the Hogs it burnt the milk cow it burnt the horse it burnt the wagon it burn everything right sir everything that they had worked for it had burned it to the ground sir they lost everything because there wasn't no fire trucks in those days come to the res right and so you fire sin that little sin yes it had destroyed the family yes sir so you would think that bad little boy an evil Wicked little child he should be beat should be run out of the family but you would say why didn't they do that to him because it wasn't his fault right he was only the the real criminal was the daddy that taught him how to do those things you see so the sin started with the dad and it bled over into the to the son and then that fled over to the mother until the whole family was consumed by the just one little yes say oh my what what do we do we we got to call upon God we got to pray that the Lord will cleanse us of every spot of every sin of every transgression no matter how small or how great amen we all need the blood of Jesus Amen and not all there's no hope for us they just this is just a just an unending cycle of sin and and death and sin and death and sin and death and and it just always there that fire of Satan is always there he's always starting these fires right yes I got to thinking one time I got a story it's up in yellow St national forest and there was a lightning strike and it caught um started a force fire well it was on the east side of the mountain and the fire was coming down off the mountain and they didn't know what to do and they called in a professional a fire uh expert and they said you know what are we going to do to stop this fire and he goes we've got to cut a fire line they said well how will we do that he said you've got to get in here with some big equipment he said you got to cut this a path across this mountain right here in front of that fire you've got to stop it the only way to stop it is a fire line you've got to go in there and before the Fire gets there you got to cut out all this Timber you got to you got to cut it down with bulldozers so the only thing you can do and so they called in the man to help him and then they said but we can't do that it'll mess up the ecology the environment right right we'll be destroyed if we do that he said then why did you call me in here for you wanted didn't know how to fix it I told you how to fix it now you don't want to fix it so deal with it yourself he got in his car and drove away right after a little while they called him back they said it's too late you got to come and help us you got to you got to help us to he said it's too late now right it had done burn everything he told him to cut out of there it had already burned that it had come down and got all the way down into the little town and burnt the whole town down right he said now you can have saved all this if you would have dealt with it back here what I'm saying is many times amen what what we got to do is we got to deal with it before it gets to that amen we've got to deal with it and so we find I believe that in order for him to actually stop the fire what they had to do is to build another fire Amen to to burn out this whole section of woods they had the only way they could stop it was to build another fire and so sometimes you got to fight fire with fire right right I got to thinking about that I said Lord Satan comes and these little sins and these trespasses and these little foxes and these little things that they're always coming into our lives and attacking us and sicknesses and diseases and and and and little complexes and and mind battles and and afflictions and and and diers and all these things that have come against us that are wicked and of the devil I just don't know how to deal with it all and then the Lord began to reveal to me that this fire that started back in Genesis yeah that brother baham tells us that sin is righteousness perverted right I thought oh my so now then these things that were that Satan was taking this right out and he had perverted it because a Tre is a right act perverted what is a lie but truth perverted right what is what is sin but it's righteousness perverted so we find then that that is this is this perversion if if if sin is like a fire but it's a perversion then there had to be a real there had to be a real and the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews he said because God is a consuming fire that there had to be a righteous Fire there had to be a holy fire there had to be a fire that came from God Amen when those priests offered on the altar a strange fire god slew them for that but there was a right way to do that amen if they went and got the fire that God had started God would have receive their sacrifice right amen oh Hallelujah that's true and so then we find that John the Baptist he comes one day and he said there's one standing Among Us Now who shoes I'm not even worthy to un loose right yes he said I indeed baptize you with water but he that cometh after me he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire amen so then we think about now this righteous Fire what is been able to do we we we find that that the scars of Disobedience that they leave a mark but we find that the fire of God yes sir it leaves a seal thank you Lord amen amen oh it seals you yes amen think about it when when Noah needed to seal the ark he had to put fire Amen to the pitch and get the pitch fire under your fire to get it hot in order to seal the ark Amen in order for you to receive a seal so that Satan amen is sealed out amen it takes a fire of the Holy Ghost upon your soul Amen to seal God in amen hallelujah so we find that as Sin spreads so does the Holy Ghost spread amen but said that the Holy Ghost and the devil they can't sleep in the same bed hallelujah oh what is it when a man gets saved and full of the Holy Ghost then what does he do it it begins to bleed over and his children see a difference said the legion was so full of the devil he said when he was delivered he wanted to go with Jesus Jesus said no go back home and teach your children right hallelujah oh why because now it was a fire was burning in his soul that he can go back and he could take that fire back to his children back to his home back to his wife back to the T he can show the whole T they want to get rid of him they want to get rid of Jesus they wanted the demons and they wanted their Pig right right amen right oh my hallelujah oh can you take this fire into your bosom not seal it'll even it'll even signature upon your soul amen you can't come into the presence of God Amen and leave amen the same way you ohy to God it consumes start out it started out like a little button right he said but after a while it was like the foxy fire amen it comes rolling out and burning and consuming amen until the whole man has been consumed amen it converts amen oh man every gets full of the Holy Ghost it converts him it changes him yes it changes it begins to change everything around him he's able to create an atmosphere man said our faith can speak a world into existence and we can go and live in it right we are amateur creators we create amen our own atmosphere amen when we consume everything around us that fire that's in our soul it turns everything around us into fire hallelujah oh praise God that fire destroys yes sir amen because I'm fighting fire with fire amen I'm fighting Satan's perverted fire that's come against my soul to destroy me to take me down the only thing I can do Amen brother said what can turn a storm it's a greater storm oh I've got to build a bigger fire Amen on the inside of my soul by feeding at the word of God what is it that gasoline is flamable flamable without a spark he it's just dead mechanics oh if I can ever get the gasoline of the holy spirit amen to strike fire amen the spark of the holy spirit amen the two mechanics become the Dynamics oh my hallelujah hallelujah they'll destroy every trace of sin everything that comes against me sickness comes against me amen my fire takes care of it because it kills everything destroys everything that's unlike it amen Amen brother man said of Satan come through that fire amen he'd be my brother that's right but he can't come through it he can't live in it he can't exist in it yes oh praise His name watch one time I got we got a there were there were it's called being coded we got the code on our on our radios it's a it's a tone that that comes over and it it means it gets your attention we got the code that said there was a house fire a structure fire then it tells us it was in a little grocery store it tells us where it was at we knew where it was at and we were just a little little volunteer group everybody was gone to work that day I had gotten in early and there's one other guy that had gotten in early was about six 6 7 o'clock in the evening Sun wasn't quite down about like it is right now so we ran to the fire department we got in the truck we said what do we take well we're not really qualified to you know to we weren't really veteran firemen we just kind of helpers I said let's just take the tanker so that way we'll have plenty of water when we get there there's other they have a local fire department and there's another little town next door they have a local fire department they'll bring their they'll bring their veterans in there we'll just Supply support we got there there was nobody there and all we had was our old tanker truck and we had some we had some respirators and you know our fire gear and everything so I didn't know what to do how you know wasn't wasn't an experienced fireman I've never been in uh in a structure fire I've been on Plenty of uh wildfires and prair fires and horse fires and structure fire is a different animal see all kind of chemicals and and there's Plastics and there's there's things that are burning in there very toxic you've got to have the right gear on you've got to be fully equipped and you've got to know where to spray where not to spray how what what kind of a of a of a stream of water do you need to put in there do you want a full blast or do you need to just put a fog you know there's different different techniques to deal with these kind of fires I wasn't too sure of all this stuff but so I I just R over there kind of you know but I see the people's plac is burning there's something inside of me said I got to deal with this right yeah I gotta help these people so I I put on my gear and I I put on my helmet I got my backpack on my oxygen I put that mass respirator on and I got all geared up and I got my oxygen burned I got that hose big old twoin hose that hose at full power there a't no one man can handle the pressure coming out of that hose pick you right up off the ground you sling you around like a rag doll that's power coming through that hose amen amen amen so I got a hold to that thing I started I can barely hold that hold up I'm a big man I'm strong back then I was framing houses every day I don't know how strong I was I that hose up I started dragging that hose hard as I could and I couldn't hardly move that hose all full of water right you know about every three feet take pounds don't take very long it adds up I'm drag in that ho oh God I'm Christian I I'm not afraid to die I'll go into this fire I couldn't get the holes there what am I going to do I don't know how to deal with this all of a sudden the back of that hose come up and got real light and I felt this big old hand hit me in the middle of the back I looked back and it was my uncle a veteran firefighter been in many fires it was a just a just a he knew the ins and outs of how to fight fire he slapped me on the back he said come on son right behind you he shov me right into the fire run right in there he said put me some fog here let me some water over here he started just telling me what to do I was just spraying I was a good right you

boys hey walked on the earth amen when was volcanics right said I want mountains over here he was walking in the of fire gory he was a consuming fire Oh Glory bless your name amen oh that was one of the most encouraging days of my life and I realized today there's many things I have to go through right even 30 years veteran Ministry I preached in it over 20 countries of this world many times I still had to fight my old dirty temper yeah I still got to struggle against old L yes yes just like when I was a baby Christian right I still got a call come and help me I hand yes all right I'm right behind you I was with children I was in the firey furnace I was in the de oh I was there in the midst of the Red Sea praise be to God hallelujah I was there when the death angel came I was there down in go I was with the children of Israel I was with he was with him there he's with you now H little children amen oh my glory firefighters we thank you we learn learn a term it's called levels of involvement levels of involvement is what tell the firefighter what they have to expect when they pull up on location so one day we got a call and way up in the mountains and our old truck wasn't that good we're wi and around up through the mountains we can see the fire we're doing our very best to get to it and when we finally the First Responders were there and they're telling us we have a structure fire that is fully involved and we're thinking oh my how terrible is this and we pull into the little town it's called Golden New Mexico and we pulled into the little town and there's just a humble bunch of people there there's not very many people I know 50 60 people in the whole town and one of the main buildings it was the old uh they called it golden because there was old mining town it was actually the home of the man that owned the mine the mine had closed down all 100 years ago probably they had taken that old house old wood frame house they turned it into an antique store and the place was on fire we pulled up on location we couldn't even get close to the place there was fire coming out the gables it was coming out from under the floorboards there was fire out every windows out the front door of the building pour there was glass bottles that were down the driveway that were melting and bending over it just so hot we couldn't get anywhere near close to it so all we could do is just take our hoses and kind of spray the buildings on both sides of it and just let her go there's nothing we could do about it and so all we can do is just sit down and on the back of our truck and some of the neighbors they brought us it was kind of a cold winter they brought us hot cocoa and we sat down there all we could do is watch it burn because it was fully involved come on now and I thought to myself you know one day when Moses went up into the into the mountain he said I got to see this great sight a bush that burns yet it is not consumed and Moses got so close to that burning bush that that fire that was inside of that burning that it got over inside of Moses and Moses became fully involved in so much that he became a on man invasion in reports he was a weapon of mass destruction Hallelujah he was going down to take over Egypt and him and his wife his little bo amen and and oh think about it he was fully involved and he said who will I tell them that that sent me down here to do this and the voice from the tree he said you tell them that he is that he is right amen yes that Ain what he said was it right he said you tell him that he was that he was no right he said you go down there and tell him I am that I am amen what was that there fire that was on the inside that bush when it got on the inside of Moses that Moses now St as the spoke hall because he became the very voice of the third you heard the voice of the first two signs that the Bible says that they do not hear the voice of the second sign they will hear the voice of the third sign and Moses was the voice of the third son it was the destruction that would come upon the people if they didn't hear the voice of the first two sons amen what has come upon the Earth in the last days but it was the voice that was in the pillar of fire showed itself in Houston Coliseum and that identified Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 amen if you want to know who sent me here it is I am that I am sent me because it's a fire amen that cannot be qued amen fire that can't be bured out it moves what brother God takes his man but he leaves the fire amen hallelujah he leaves his Spirit behind yes oh Paul amen he met that Pillar of Fire on the road to Damascus yeah he did amen what was it he said who art thou Lord right he said I am Jesus Oh Hallelujah Sten amen he met the pillar of fire in the upper room oh what happened when they went to destroy him when they went to Stone him amen what was it brother said he was like a house of fire on a windy day stepen was fully involved amen all they could do throw stones at him right amen when they got done with him what did he do he they just had to sit at him drink cocoa right watching burn Hallelujah why because he was set on fire with a consuming fire of the Holy ghosten Glory oh said about the woman at the he said once she had realized that he was Messiah when he realized that he could tell her the thoughts and intents of her heart he said there was nothing to shut her up she was like a house on fire on a hot windy day oh let me tell you back in New Mexico where I you can't just burn your trash you I got about sometimes you know 0.5 to four five% humidity they like here I can preach all day and never sweat a drop right it just evaporates immediately amen here you get ringing wet in just a little while but what is it out there they say that you cannot burn without a permit sounds denominational to me yeah come on D they say you can't burn without a permit and if the wind gets up over 10 m hour you got to put the fire out that sounds like a lot of churches I go to amen oh you can't Rejoice you can't get on fire amen unless a song leader gives you permission you got to have your own little fire permit and then you better not get two out of control it down start fire here oh i' have a little [Applause] bur get over amen amen yes Hallelujah that's true go said said what they do today is they tell about how it was way back when yes so they come to oh back in the day oh back when brother Brandon was here oh when he would walk into the building there would come such a presence into the building he you wouldn't want to lift your head why ain't it here today why ain't that Spirit here today why is it when he would inure every demon power and he would speak in the name of Jesus and wave his hand across the people and the people would be healed by the hundreds yes yes sir why don't it happen today because all we got is a painted fire right right all we can do is read him a quote of how yes sir all we can do is tell them oh brother Brown was here yeah brother Brown said yeah brother Brown told that woman brother told that man oh my and there clap their hands and say Amen praise the Lord oh but where's the god of Elijah where is the god of fire why today the same yesterday today and forever oh my if there were just somebody that would get fully involved amen just get so fully involved the devil we just have to sit down drink Coco right amen well I burn up beautiful wonder I was with the fire department I bought me an old hound dog AKC register Blood Hound she's beautiful she's the only other girlfriend I ever had I love that old girl man she she was beautiful she had ears about that long her old G's hung all she had big droopy eyes she's gorgeous she had a wrinkled face right oh my she slobbered all the time man I just loved her to death she a sweetheart my wife was jealous of him I went running into the house of the truck the wife come running out of the house with a glass of tea in her hand this ain't no lie this really happen the dog beat her to me and I knelt down and hugged the dog and she kissed me big old sloppy lick all side my face I wi you do she gave me the tea in the she was glad when the dog died oh but I I had that old dog and I trained her for search and rescue and so in order to train the dog for search and rescue I had to be trained for search and rescue and so there were certain things that we had to learn in order to be a rescue Personnel that when somebody's lost out there they're in a panic and you're using your animal to try to locate these lost people sometimes they're just little children and so you're searching through the woods and you get out there and sometimes you're way into the night and you're just following the dog you don't know where you are and you're just following flashlight and sometimes you get out there and get lost yourself because it's in the night you can't see nothing it's cloudy or whatever maybe it's in a blizzard and you're out there looking and so then you have to go fully equipped you can't just go run off into the woods and your shirt sleeves but you have there's a certain equipment that you have to carry with you that's got food for yourself and for the victim if you were to find it imagine that there's there there's you have Compass you have GPS you have uh you have a a blanket you know a survival blanket that can wrap around you you have H these little chemical hand and feet warmers because sometimes people are freezing they know they got to have somebody to keep them from getting Frost by there's all this equipment that has to come with you but there's one thing that was the most important part of your pack and that was Fire Starting equipment that you had to have something that that was tender you had to have something you had have magnesium Strikers you had to have big lighters you had to have farmer matches you had to have all these different kinds of Fire Starting equipment had to be in your pack at all times because rule number one is that when you found the victim or if you got lost yourself you just got you and your dog and you're out there in the middle of nowhere and you don't know where that dog has led you cuz you're not paying any attention you're following that dog's nose he's looking for the victim right and so you get out there and maybe maybe the dog loses the trail or maybe it gets cold or whatever and you can't go nowhere maybe you get injured and so then they they tell you that the first thing that you have to do is prepare some sort of shelter build a fire and stay still don't don't move around find stop build a fire bu the Shel that's the rules when you're lost wow that'll preach if you realize that you're lost friend sir just stop yes sir turn around repent get down on your knees pray build a fire amen call God tell him know you know that he's met with you otherwise you're freak death right hypothermia you don't have to be below freezing to die to freeze to death needs to be 55 de and you will die of hypothermia amen 55 degrees you said well that's not too cold it's not too cold when you're healthy right but when you're dehydrated and you've run out of all your calories and you have no no fuel inside of you to build enough fire am to keep you warm when that all depletes friends 55 degrees you will freeze to death you will go to sleep and die amen oh let me tell you and that's a lot where a lot of churches are today brother said they're they're 40 below zero right right amen spiritually 40 below zero oh my let me tell you amen sometimes we could be in a church that's that's on fire for God but we ourself because me we have allowed Satan to put the fire out by throwing wet blankets on us and wet blankets on and has stopped the mo of God in our Liv so many times till now our spiritual thermometer has dropped down below zero and we're dying spiritually sitting right on the Pew of a Holy Ghost Field church right right and you say oh God what will I do well there's a way to build a fire now you don't just go gather up a bunch of wood strike a match and throw it down on there that won't start a fire right right that will just put your match out and that's what a lot of people do is they come in the back door they come into church they got all this Tinder laying around here they strike up their little match Hallelujah bless the Lord throw it on there W nothing happened today and they do that over and over till they finally they just what's a use mat and they just sat there and freeze the death right right right in church right because they're lost Bible said if our gospel be hid it is hid from them that are lost right right so we find today there's a way to build a fire yes sir yes and what you got to do is you got to get something that's real flammable yes the most flammable thing I know of is the word of God yes sir amen amen you get a little word you put a little line upon a line a precept Upon A precept right yes sir and you and you get you a promise and you put it down in front of you and then if all you got is one little spark just one little little spark of then you put it on that promise and then you get down like this yeah and you get your hands around that little promise and then you begin to pray and he begin to breathe on that promise that little bit of tender and after a little while yes sir it'll start burning amen praise God oh but you don't just start chucking big chunks of wood on top of it no you gotta you got to Fan it you got to just say oh bre yes [Music] yes and is that little you begin to breathe on that little that little that little coal begin to burn yes it'll begin to get bigger and bigger and you can put another promise on that he's a God that Health me amen he cleanses me from all of my iniquities he heals all of my diseases amen glory oh he redeem us me praise God Heen you start old Psalms 103 on there and you just begin to praise oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm not forget your benefits here today Lord and it don't matter if it's 40 below outside you just keep laying promise on there thank you God promise on there promise on there after a little while that fire start getting bigger right and bigger and you can start putting that to on there and you can serve Malachi four upon it oh my it's getting bigger Revelations 10 oh my seven thund God

really struck me when you see little sin in somebody's life let's try to stop it before it gets big yeah I thought for the home Church especially as me as a pastor sometimes I see little things come up I really need to I need God to help me with that praise the Lord I think every Pastor would right but think about you and your families and children and your loved ones and when you see a little sin come up let's ask God to help us to take care God's gra to avoid as much damage as possible absolutely let's just pray over that we won't close yet but let's just say prayer that God would help us to we see that damage going on that we would stop it you're remind me of scripture about the little leav leav at the whole lump remind me of that fire having the same effects as leav perverted fire we say heavenly father Lord that so struck me Lord that tonight as a pastor Lord I hear every service Lord I see the people in and out Lord trying to keep my life pure before you imagine every Pastor is like this lord they're just a shepher they look at the sheep and they love the sheep and they care so much but Lord as Pro the prophet said when they start to wander away Lord uh it's hard for the shepherd we know Lord that brother Bram like it unto you Lord how you break a leg and you bring that land back lord uh put them right on your shoulder maybe carry them right in your bosom and and feed them closer Lord and sometimes Lord we see that we see uh ones we love family members people in the church Lord friends we see them get a little bit of sin God help us Lord help us to go as Galatians 61 said go in the spirit of meekness and restore such a one who's overtaken in The Fault Lord God to try to preserve the damage Lord I think of that perverted fire think a forest fire all the damage it would cause the story our brother told about wishing would have uh made a little cut or a little pain at first to to preserve a little bit of the forest Lord God littleit the property or how it types to us as well Lord God we see a brother stumble when we see a sister stumble and we can do something about it help us to do something about it give us the wisdom the meekness the humility also the strength and courage Lord God we don't want to see them take fire in their bosom in the wrong sense and be burned and have scars of sin we want to see them take the Holy Ghost in their heart credit Jesus believe Jeremiah said let my heart let their hearts be wood and your word is fire Prophet Jeremiah said that Lord let us do that Lord God yes give us Grace and wisdom Lord as we care so much for the Saints no doubt our friends and family Lord God we thank you for this message Lord what a message that Jesus for such a time as this no doubt you're never late you're right on time dear God thank you for this message Lord you encourage others to listen to it Lord you might know there's a real fire lord that must consume Our Lives must consume every bit of it Lord as we close it a

he'll flee from Let the Fire of God push back the other one Lord push back may we resist any evil thought and evil conversation Lord let it be Holiness unto the Lord oh all of our Lives all of our Lives Jesus that's our desire we want to be in the word all the way through fully involved I want to be fully involved what you're doing in aan Ohio Lord God be fully involved yes I don't want to take
