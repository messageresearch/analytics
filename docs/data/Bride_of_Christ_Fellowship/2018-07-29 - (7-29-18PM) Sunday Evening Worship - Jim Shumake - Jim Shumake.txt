God amen praise God I see this here by God's grace [Music] above [Music] [Music] you know that I mean we were in his mind and then and he thought of us above everything else have your Bibles tonight turned with me I'll try not to be lengthy this evening in Ephesians the fourth chapter as I said we've been preaching at home a series on the characteristics of the Holy Spirit and wanting to see and know that we are the bride amend and you know when you are joined one with another they said you become bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and spirit of his Spirit and then you become one Amen with the bride and the bridegroom become one and with that thought in mind we've been preaching this series if we're one with him then the same spirit that he had would be found in each one of us I mean being living lived out through our lives and manifested in our lives and I want to continue all that thought this evening if you have your Bibles turn with me to Ephesians the fourth chapter Friesians chapter 4 beginning at verse 30 Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 see just what the Spirit would say under the church tonight a man ask that you would pray for me and the Lord would help me to be brief in my comments but yet get the word across the man in a timely manner him and pray for the little church there in Albion my son text me while I was back in the back room wanna know how services went this morning said services went very well at the home church and he said please greet everyone there for us he said he wanted to be here he wanted to come with us and he was just wore out this week had a real hard week at work it's decided they were going to stay home and attend service at the home Church but he said to be sure to tell Jesse and Kristen he said hello and so didn't want to forget to do that amen but just pray to Lord have his way in the services tonight amen and beat it a little church there Joe Martin is ministering the Word of God for me he be ministering they starts where we start our service at five o'clock at homes so just keep him in your prayers that guy would just use him in a mighty way to speak to a little body of Christ there also Ephesians chapter 4 verse 30 and just see what the Lord would say tonight him in and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby we are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sakes as forgiving you amen let's just pray Heavenly Father we gather tonight once again with grateful hearts thankful for all you've done for us Lord and thankful for your word of what it means to us we thank you for another opportunity to just give praise and worship unto the one who's worthy of all our praise and worship tonight Lord God we just love you and appreciate all that you've done for us thus far father and and just can't wait to see him and what you continue to do for us Lord we know your word promises that you would be a provider of all our needs and father we just a meant place the need tonight amen of your spirit to come and minister the word father for I'm an empty vessel without that spirit Lord God I can do nothing but God I commit myself unto thee tonight ask that you would come and speak through my lips word it would encourage this little portion of the body of Christ Lord God we ask tonight Lord God that you regard my lips once again let's that say something it would be contrary to the word but let all things be said to bring this portion of bride closer and father to glorify the wonderful name of Jesus Christ we love you Lord and we thank you for all you've done for us we pray Lord that you would have your way in this service be there at the home church lord god minister through brother joe to the people as they they come Lord God expecting to hear not from a man but hear from you Lord God we pray you would fill brother Joe's lips Lord God with what you would have them to hear tonight have your way into services where the bride meets around the world and we'll give you the glory for it all in Jesus name amen you can be seated this evening amen I want to speak a thought tonight on forgiveness the spirit of forgiveness a man how many believes that Christ had a spirit of forgiveness in you amen you can't know the forgiveness of God and not know that he had a spirit of forgiveness upon him a man we read over the Psalms 103 psalm amen David wrote a song said blessed Lord O my soul and all those we bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits a man how many knows we got a lot of benefits Amen there are through Christ Jesus tonight he says forget all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities he didn't say he just forgives some of them but it says he forgives all your iniquities what a benefit to know that God forgives all my iniquities you know I know what all my iniquities were I know what all my sins were I know what they are and to know that there's a God who could look at me and say they never they were never there in the first place that makes me feel good tonight amen that's the kind of God we serve that's the spirit that God had in him he says he forgiveth all thine iniquities a man who heals all thy diseases who redeemeth my life for destruction who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercy this is the Spirit of God we're looking at here who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that my youth is renewed like the Eagles then we go down to verse 10 it says he hath not dealt with us after our sins Oh aren't you glad tonight that he didn't deal with you after your sins if he dealt with me after my sins I'd be in Hell right now amen but he hasn't dealt with me after my sins he says nor rewarded US according to our iniquities it's not rewarded me according to what I've done I mean not not not giving me amen what I deserve Amen but he showed mercy and grace upon me tonight amen as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward Mercy towards them that fear him and aren't you glad for the mercy of God how many knows the mercy of God tonight it's so great amen when you think of what he's done in here he says as far as the East is from the west so far have they removed my transgressions our transgressions from us in other words we're completely forgiven tonight him here aren't you glad for that hey man I'm so glad tonight that God completely forgave me tonight amen I mean there's no there's no there's no little thing that he's holding against me there's no little that is there a man in the background but when God looks down at me a man he says what sins are you talking about when he looks at me he looks through the blood of Jesus he says I don't see any CNC me I look at myself and I see my shortcoming I look at myself and I see my affairs amai but his brother branham said one time he said when God looks down upon him he sees that that that that covering of blood round about him he says and then when those sins I bet him I missed I missed moves are my mistakes amen when they would come to God he looks down and it he said those things go up and they hit that bumper like a bumper of blood and God never sees something mean I mean I'm glad for that tonight I mean I'm so glad for that he says he said that was the spirit that was in Christ he was a forgiver remember when they hung him on the cross remember he stood they died they brought one a malefactor I believe the Bible says he said they brought there was one mouth to mouth factor let him put him when they put him to death and there were they come to the place was called Calvary and there they crucified him the malefactors one on the right hand the other on the left hand and Jesus said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing forgive them they don't know what they do he says then they parted on cast lot they've been so we see that it was this spirit was on Christ a man no matter what they've done to it no matter what it what it was what did what what's in that was come against him a man he looked down and he said Father forgive them a man who was he talking about when he said them Church we all look at he was a freak she was saying forgive the ones that were crucifying them you know who crucified it you crucified him I crucified if it was my sins that put him on that cross but he said forgive them he was looking down through eternity he saw Jim schumake down there and he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing hey man and he looked at my said that he put them under the blood hallelujah oh I'm thankful for that tonight amen and you know what we're talking about the Spirit of God we're talking about manifesting the Spirit of God amen and we come around and we look at the what God has done for us and if he was a forgiver maybe that same spirit forgiveness will be in our heart it will be in my life it would be in your life hey man it's not like I said this morning it's not how much we could shout or how long we grow our hair or what kind of a dress we wear or don't wear that that manifests whether we are the bride of Jesus Christ both of us both flesh was my spirit but if the Spirit of Christ is in us then we will have that same forgiving spirit in our hearts tonight how many knows that to me the tree that is the Spirit of Christ and I quoted this quote this morning but I got it wrote down here it says Oh what we need in jeffersonville is thousands of lived voices not your voice but the voice of Christ the Spirit of Christ speaking out of the bride of Jesus Christ he says speaking out the thunder of God thundering out the sweetness and holiness and purity and undefiled lines walking around the earth today without blemish yes sir real Christians how many won't be a real Christian this morning it said real Christians that Thunder against the enemy that's what thunders against the enemy he said he said the devil don't care how loud you can holler he said well I shouted I shouted and run around church he said the devil don't care how loud you can halt her the devil don't care how much you can jump he said the devil don't care how loud you can shout he said but what hurts the devil is when he sees that sanctified holy consecrated life to God amen that one who is full that's filled with the spirit totally consecrated life giving over to God when he sees that life he says he said that's what puts the devil to fly that's what shakes the Damned away man he stood always says he said with that hurts the devil to see that sanctified Holy life of God and he says you could say anything to a person like that do anything to a person like that amen offend a person like that maybe like they did Jesus Christ then you know what he said they just go right on amen and like it never took place I see more problems in churches because that spirit is not manifested than anything else amen I see that spirit I've been through church splits I've been through this that and the other thing and you know what I bet everyone goes right on worshiping God like everything's okay and they can't forgive their brother who lives right next door come on church it's the truth amen and when we see that that's not the Spirit of God it not to God was a headache forgiving spirit Father forgive them they don't know what they do hey man and whatever we wherever we find the Holy Spirit the true Holy Spirit in a person that same spirit will have to be in them too we can say we're Christians we could say we're bride but I can know I'm bride like I said this morning by that Spirit of Christ living out of me live voices in there that's what thunders out against the devil and spirit wherever the Spirit of Christ was a man wherever that Holy Ghost was in a person's life that same spirit manifest itself I don't have time to look at all the examples but I want to look at a few of those examples tonight we look at a man by the name of Stephen how many remember Stephen in the Bible we spoke of him this morning amen but when Stephen was being stoned to death here he was he was preaching the gospel to the ungodly the Gentiles and to the to the the Sadducees the Pharisees they met he would tell them you uncircumcised stiff necked he was and he said they couldn't take it a man they couldn't believe that he would speak to them like that but he was speaking the truth and love trying to get them to come to the knowledge that he had of Jesus Christ a man and he said when he was doing that hey man the Bible says that they were so cut down inside that they begin to Nash on him with their teeth they hated him they hated him without a cause here he was trying to love them amen trying to show them the error of their ways and what did they do to him they hated him without a cause and they couldn't forgive him for what he'd said - how many knows it to be the truth you know sometimes there's a preacher or maybe sometimes there's a brother or sister you go say something to somebody just trying to show them the error of their ways you know what they pump that's the way you feel I will come here again how my knows that he said that's the Spirit of Christ he said there was Stephen he says they were he was being he was being national of this teak because the people ABA couldn't take what he would say and what did Stephen do is that the Bible says here in acts 7 the 55th chapter of Acts 750 first verse of Acts 7 he says he was being full of the Holy Ghost being full of her first time I want you to notice that the Spirit of Christ was upon him full of the Holy Ghost he looked steadfastly in heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God and he said behold I see the heavens open the Son of God standing on the right hand of God and they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord in cast him out of city and stoned him and the witness was laid down to closer to the feet of a young man named Saul you know the story maybe Saul later converted to Paul idea and it says and they stoned Stephen calling upon the name of the Lord saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit a man look at the offense brought a death sentence pronounced against him notice though he says that Stephen being full of the Holy Ghost looked up and he said and he knelt down he cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge lord lay not this sin to their charge white because the Bible says he was full of the Holy Spirit and if the Spirit of God is in us that same Holy Spirit it'll have the same desire that Christ had that see reconcile to see forgiveness a man regardless of what you know or you don't know what he did to me you don't know what they said it didn't matter him II maybe look what we did to Christ look what we put him on the cross him and he still said Father forgive them a man they don't realize what they're doing Oh Church him and this spirit has got to be found in the bride of Jesus Christ tonight maybe I and there's more turmoil more problems because we struggle with this thing of forgiveness we can know tonight that that spirits in us we don't have to hope so we don't have to wonder about it and you're sitting right here tonight if you've got a problem with forgiveness whether you need forgiveness or whether you need to offer forgiveness a man you know right now whether you're right with God where that spirit is right with God or not the the Word of God says when the Spirit of God is there that same spirit that Christ had on the cross will be in us no matter what takes place how many knows to be the truth a man if we ever seen a person that could demonstrate this like the man by the name of Joseph remember Joseph in the Bible over in Genesis amen it may we find out that Joseph was hated of his brothers man he was treated wrong by his brothers he was sold off into slavery and you know the story how it goes I can't go back and do all all the picking up on this but when we find out that all the things than the offenses that his brothers and all the people did against him that hey man he still had that Spirit of God in him I mean knows he had to chose it was the perfect type of Jesus Christ to probably not say Amen so we find out that as he began to have all these offenses come against him any and every time they did he just try to make the best of it he just try to make the best of it a man and he never we never had that bitterness well up inside of him never one time church he made why because he had the Spirit of God in him we find out later on we find out he ends up in Pharaoh's Kingdom there and and he the Pharaoh has a dream and they're gonna be the seventeen years in the seven five years of the seven lean years I mean and so he goes and interprets the dream for Pharaoh how many knows the story I'm talking about maybe eight so he gets over there and he interprets the story from Pharaoh and he tells me not what you need to do what you need to do he says is when you get these seven five years he says you need to store up he said because there's seven lean years coming if you don't store it maybe it's gonna be devastating it's gonna be death to the people if it so that's the way the story goes but when it gets all done telling says here's what you got to do here's what you got to put somebody in charge make sure this had done to all that and when Pharaoh now notice that this was this was it a this wasn't a Christian this was people that were observing a man who had the Spirit of God in him maybe when they saw Joseph over I think it's in the forty first chapter of Genesis about verse 38 it says hey man what you need to do is you need to put somebody in charge of this you need to get somebody in charge of this program and Farrell looks at his people and he says can we put anybody else in charge rather than this man seeing that the Spirit of God is in him the Spirit of God they recognize that Spirit of God in here maybe and so we show the Word of God testifies in Tencent that the Spirit of God was in him like no other man is there any man like Joseph he said church I thought what was that is your perfect type of Christ is there any man like Joseph ami he said in Joseph a man was put in charge that he began to lay up and he begin to do all this and he begin to do what needed to be done I mean and we find out that a man when the fat years were over and the leaner started in that people started coming and Joseph was doling out the food he was doling out the good now remembers the story and when he got to a certain place a man we find out that his brother ended up right in his court begging for food how many knows the story they didn't even recognize who he was they didn't even recognize this Joseph that was their brother that they'd sold off into slavery and it came to a place where Joseph said food and I'm not gonna get in the whole store but you know the story how he sent food with them and they came back and he sent food with him again any money in their sacks and all that hey bet you know the story how many knows the story but what I want to get to in to the place where it came time when Joseph could not contain himself anymore and he wanted to reveal himself to his brothers a man when he got to that place we pick it over up in Genesis the 45th chapter and Joseph could not retain himself before all them there stood by him and he cried because every man to go out from him he says and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known to his brethren and he wept aloud Egyptian the phrase house heard it and Joseph said unto his brethren I am Joseph he does he said nothing my father yet live and his brethren all of a sudden realized oh we're in trouble now this is the guy that we sold into slavery this is the guy that we took his coat this is the guy we did all this terrible thing dude this is the guy that we hated without a cause just like we did Christ hated without a cause yes he says this is the guy we did all this to and it says they were troubled in his presence you know why they were troubled because in the world it's dog-eat-dog it's an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth well what they didn't see a man that inside their brother Joseph was the spirit of Almighty God inside of Joseph a man they need not been troubled inside of Joseph was that spirit of forgiveness they made churches then the Bible said that you ever seen a man like Joseph who the Spirit of God dwells in a man he had nothing but that he had no choice but to forgive him because the Spirit of God was in and if the Spirit of God is enough we have the same forgiveness in our spiritual is that right he said Joseph came to his brother and he says they were troubled at his prayer and Joe said Abra come near to me I pray you and they came near he said I'm Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt don't you realize what I'm telling you I'm the one that's Feeny I'm the one that's doing all this stuff to you he says he says now therefore be not grieved nor be angry with yourself that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life maybe don't get graved about this God sent me before you to preserve life I thought to myself Jesus Christ was sent for the same thing amen to preserve life and he didn't hold it against me he didn't hold it against me that he was sent and had to give his life in my stead he didn't hold it against me he said frankly forgive them Lord how many know that Joseph's done the same thing that Spirit of God was in him amen to forgive his brethren and he and God said he said before me to preserve life he said now that's what I'm doing here you see the spirit of forgiveness a Benny a lot everybody that he could have hold it against his brother held against his book but he did he forgave them hey man how many believe God did the same thing for you and me oh why he had a lot that he could hold against me but he flanked Pratt flat flat forgave me of it all I mean but then you know anybody they thought well they still didn't know and they were going on and he continued to feed him and provide for their needs and he brought him down into the land brought his daddy down land you know the story I don't want to get into all that that the sermon itself but when they brought him down the land they lived together there peacefully in that spirit of forgiveness with upon Joseph and he and he spoke kindly to them hey man he forgave one another just as God for Christ's sakes forgave us he wants us to do the same thing that spirits in us but then find out that Jacob dies a man a man Joseph looks around and brothers he goes buries a day comes back and now they're really worried because they think it was all a put-on if this wasn't real they meant he was just doing this because daddy was here you know what sometimes we put on a real good face amen when somebody else is around but when it comes down when nobody else around we said I still have this little bitterness in my heart how many knows this to be the truth he said when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead Genesis 50 he says Joseph will prevent your per venture hate us and certainly request requite us all the evil that we have done unto Him see he they were looking at it as the world looks at it today they were looking at a little I for an eye tooth for a tooth amen now he's going to get us a man he said and they sent a messenger Joseph saying my father did command before he died saying so shall you say unto Joseph forgive I pray you now the president the the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of your servants of the God of thy father and Joseph begin Cohiba hey man what was it hey buddy begin to repayment that's that Spirit of Christ in him amen that spirit of love he said I can't believe you'd think this was a put-on I can't believe you would think this isn't real I can't believe that his brethren fell down on their faces they said behold where thy service he said fear not for him I omit in the place of God am I the one that's gonna bring judgment no it's not me to do this thing but he says as the spirit gods in me I just flat frankly forgive you for it all I mean how many knows he did you thought evil against me but God meant it to be good to bring to pass good as it is this day to save much people alive I thought to myself that's exactly what God did a man he flanked Frank frankly forgave us all that many people might be saved hey man he said I forgive you and then you thought you do you did this to me as an evil thing you did your sins your iniquities and all he said but I'm gonna forgive you at all that life might be preserved a man oh that's a spirit of Christ and he wants to see manifested in our lives tonight Amen everywhere that spirit was in Christ and Steven and Joseph a perfect type of Jesus Christ brother have said Joseph was a perfect type of Jesus Christ how many know is that to be the truth he says he was born amidst his brothers hated of his brothers loved of his father a man and why didn't they hate him because he was a seer because he interpreted dreams because he had visions it made they hated him a bit why did could he do all those things because the Spirit of God was in him they hated him because the Spirit of God was any me they hated him for a just cause and so they hate Jesus and so did they hate Jesus because he was spiritual they called him Beelzebub they hate his church today those have brothers and sisters because the Spirit of God that moves on the born-again believers they still despise it hey man I'm a knows it to be the truth or you think you're something you think you're good amen no we know we're just we can't help what the Spirit of God is on us hey man he said I noticed for a just cause they hated him and they suppose they've killed him and thrown him into a ditch he was taken upset right hand of Pharaoh just that Jesus was taking up a sit at the right hand of the Father he made a perfect type brother branham said of Jesus Christ no man come to Pharaoh except to Joseph no man come to God except through Jesus Christ a man is that right he says watch him he said watch him in his temptation there in prison hey man there was a baker and a butler one of them lost one of them was safe hey man bye Joseph for telling what would happen at Jesus one on the cross one thief was saved one was lost Jesus foretold it would going to be that way is that right a perfect type of Jesus Christ amen and notice when his brother he was rejected him and he was rejected he was given a Gentile bride Oh Church David aren't you glad he would give it a Gentile bride who would be bold and gold freshman's by spirit of spirit have the same spirit in here hey man he was given a Gentile bride rejected by the Jews received by a Gentile bride to fulfill the scriptures I'll take unto my people a gent out of the Gentiles for my namesake I think I'm not people a Gentile yeah out of the Gentiles for my name he meant there you are living right there in this day the very living Spirit of God right at the end time now shadows and types falling everywhere he says oh I like that he said it's a type of perfect type of Jesus Christ a man that type that said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing he flat forgave us amen he flattened forgave his brethren amen without any without any strings attached so to speak it is and church if that spirit is in us if we are his bride in this hour that same spirit will manifest itself in our lives to our brothers and sisters just like the Word of God says here said we are he said let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice amen don't grieve the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption if that spirit say you don't agree but with allowing those things to creep back into your life Church I'm not saying you don't have the Holy Spirit tonight but don't grieve it and then by allowing these things to come back into your life the Word of God say he said be kind one to another he said tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake forgave you he said if that spirit was in you and you claim that spirits that we all claim to have the Spirit of God inside to be the bride of Jesus Christ we will have that same spirit of forgiveness in us how many know to be the truth I'm reading a little book came in it's written by a denominational preacher Amen I know that's a bad word and some people but I read a lot of books him in the little different commentaries and books I mean I love to read after Charles Spurgeon I've learned so much from him a man I love to read after these different authors and I'm in a book right now by a Charles swindoll him in you probably have heard him on the radio he's a Baptist minister I believe but he wrote a book called improving your servant in that book he had some stuff to say about forgiveness and it was really I thought wow that fits perfectly into this thought so I'm gonna share a couple of those thoughts with you tonight if that's all right amen I might not have it verbatim because I can't remember exactly what he said in the book but it was good and it expired me inspired me and I want to hope it does that to you tonight too amen but and I'll tell you what I get to those places but anyhow amen he was talking about forgiveness amen and when he talked about forgiving he said sooner or later we as Christians we'll all have to deal with forgiveness and we deal with it how we deal with it if we deal with it with the Spirit of Christ in it just shows what we are made of another one this shows whether you are a bride or not hey Ben whether it is you're the one that needs forgiveness or you're the one that needs to forgive there's two sides to the coin he said that spirit of Christ will still be in either decision that you make how many knows that to be the truth he said and then he went to the scripture a bit in Matthew the fifth chapter and I want to share this with you tonight him you he says therefore if you bring forth a gift to the altar this is if you're if you are the if you are the one that maybe has offended something like somebody by somebody it's something you said something you did or something you didn't do that you should have a mint and all of a sudden her brother is offended how many have ever done that I wish I had another hand but when you do that a man you need to you need to handle it in a certain way and here's where I think the problem lies and I want to I want to just talk about this a little bit tonight Indians that all right he says therefore Jesus said over in Matthew the fifth chapter he dealt with this very very subject therefore if you bring your gift to the altar and remember that has that there and and there remembers that thy brother hath ought against thee how many knows what odd is that means anything the slightest little thing brother Branham says ought is just a one place in the message brother Branham says ought is just a funny little feeling think about that it's not some great big sledgehammer aunt just the funny little feeling a little bit saw what that brother but that's sister you know he ever been there he says if you if you're a worshiping and you remember you have aw our brother has ought against thee it says leave thy gift before the altar in those days when they would come into worship in order to be accepted worship they would bring a gift a little sacrifice or a gift amen but church we have the the supreme sacrifice we don't have to bring a sacrifice a gift anymore we bring our sacrifices as a sacrifice of praise our sacrifice might be a song of worship and we come to worship God our sacrifice might be a specialist or what we gave a meant or how we sing out to God I mean whatever it might be your form of worshiping God when you come here amen to worship God or wherever it might be you go he says when you when you come to worship a man and you realize that somebody's got on against you he says you stop right there and leave your gift at the altar he says go thy way first be reconciled unto thy brother then come and offer your gift but you know what I think the problem is hey man we we have these little under toes and undercurrents and churches they man may I pray to God you don't have them here I pray to God I'm just speaking like a barking up the wrong tree but Church a man when I think of human nature I think you know it's a real good chance I mean we all could struggle with something like this and I'm not trying to point the finger but Jessie I'm not putting two finger nobody in your congregation but I wonder you know but spirit of God I had several ways I could ago and I was praying to my wife I said pray with me I know which way to go Lord show me which way to go and spear to God led me this way so I'm gonna believe that the Spirit of God wants this said tonight is that Alright so when I when you when you read it says stop before stop when you give before they alter stop right there but I wonder how many times we come to church and we know there's a little feeling you know somebody doesn't feel quite right about something that you said or something you've done and you go right ahead and just raise your hands they glory to God hallelujah sing the songs and you smile and you think so good it's contrary to the Word of God that worship is contrary to the Word of God that's not worshiping God in the spirit amen they that worship Him must worship Him in the spirit the Bible says we have to worship Him in spirit and in truth and that's a false thing in our lives if we know there's something there we're contrary to the Word of God if we just continue to go right on worshiping I mean if you know her brother got something if you know something you did bother somebody if I did something I know that bothers that brother it says I have to stop what I'm doing right there because God doesn't receive the worship from that point forward he says stop right there and go he doesn't say wait for your brother to come and see you why you're not in church why you're not worried so you stop right there you go to that brother and the Bible says be reconciled unto that brother you know that word reconcile it's a it's a Greek word I'm not gonna try to pronounce it but I always like to look and see what those words mean what's it mean be reconciled to thy brother it says the word means to change the mind of anyone to reconcile to be reconciled to renew I like this but to new to renew a friendship with one that you like you had it before to renew it Oh church amen amen you know how little like that can ruin a friendship you know little things like that could get in a church and just cause a big rift amen just a little it says you are to go first and be reconciled you are to change that person's mind you are to renew that you are to take that mind that he had that ought against you and you are to change it when he sees you are genuinely want to have that thing done away with he says you are to have that spirit of reconciliation in you they man how many knows we have to have it hey there that sphere was in crisis is over second Corinthians 5:19 God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself while bringing us back into fellowship with him hey man he says not imputing our trespasses unto them but having committed unto us the word of reconciliation him and he was in the world reconciling the world unto himself not holding our trespasses against us a man he wants us to have the same type of Spirit in us tonight in church if we have anything less I mean we can tell everybody all day long we're bride a man but I mean if we're bride we'll have the same spirit of the bridegroom with us because we become one with him how many knows to be the truth but so you go to the bread oh well what if he won't be reconciled what if he won't accept me what if we won't take my apology but what do i do then amen you make yourself so sincere you make him know whether he wants to accept it or not you let you be genuinely true in your reconciliation they made you say I am so sorry what would it take to make it right whatever it would take you have to humble yourself like Christ did amen to bring reconciliation to bring that fret to renew that friendship back the way it was before whatever it was happen he said that spirit has got to be in you he said until you do that don't even bring your gift to the owner well what if he won't accept me brother he says you know what you do then he says you commit it to God you've done your part amen now it's up to that brother now we're on the other side of the coin of forgiveness we'll get to that in a minute amen amen but you know what a lot of people say well just why don't the guy just suck it up it wasn't that big a deal you know have you ever felt like that hey Marion let's speak let's speak real here I made it right with God I went to God and I said listen lord I you know I didn't mean that the brother took it the wrong way you know I didn't mean it lord please forgive me even if I go to him he just could still be angry I just don't I just don't want to go through all this well that sounds real good that sounds real good and you might feel good you got it all right with God but that didn't change that didn't reconcile your brother he still feels the exact same way he did before you made it right with God and not only that but that's not what the Word of God said to do the Word of God said you stop you go you get reconciled then you come back and worship a man but a lot of us say oh I made it right with God they come right on in to church and begin to worship the glory hallelujah amen and the problems still there I mean and it grieves the Spirit of God it says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed even when you go contrary to what the Spirit of God supposed to telling you to do a man that's a grieving to that Spirit of God that all right I'm not evangelist church man I'm a pastor I deal with things in the church that need dealt with a man I'm sorry if you want evangelist tonight I'm in I'm pastoring tonight is that Alright amen so what if you make it right I like the analogy that I read in this book and I might now get it exactly right so don't hold me if you got the book and read it say that's not the way it went but it's like this hey man I made it right with God it's okay it's all everything's all right it's not all right he said it would be like me jumping in my car out here we're getting ready to leave and I hook it in Reverse and I back right into Jesse's brand-new Nissan whatever it is that big bus and Jesse standing there talking her brother to door he looks over he says I can't believe her budget back in my car you know he's gonna be a little offended but then Jesse looks and I jump out of my car and I drop to my knees and I say oh god please forgive me for doing that please forgive me for being so clumsy oh and while you're at it Lord God would you please help Jesse to get over this and help me when he goes to get it fixed and everything will come out all right I jump my car say it's been wonderful to be here with you this weekend brother Jesse now I'm heading home baby it's all right I made it okay with God how do you supposed brother Jesse feels but that's what we do when we try to sidestep dogs I will make it all right I mean it doesn't change it doesn't renew the friendship a man it doesn't it doesn't cause reconciliation hey man the Bible says that we've got to go to that brother until we do we are out of the will of God I hope brother Jesse gets over it but he won't church we need to do what God said to do amen and until we do the problem doesn't go away Jesse doesn't feel any better whoever who Cara backed into him and doesn't feel any better I might feel better you might feel better you might feel like you do but your concreted word the Word of God says stop leave your gift go get it right then come back and worship and everything then you say everything okay I stopped I went to Jesse I told him hey what I did he said he said that's okay I got good insurance brother Jim do you got good I got good insurance here it is maybe and if they don't fix it right bring it all I got a guy over home that'll fix it man it looked like brand-new and I do - he's great but anyhow hey man Church what is that spirit of reconciliation have got to be found if we are bribed and that spirit sent us we've got to have that same type of forgiving spirit that right we've got to be willing to go and make it right until we do Church were only play in church we're only kidding ourselves and a lot of problems are in churches because a lot of people are doing just that thinking it's okay it's alright it's not alright you said if you have a little funny feeling if you have odd any little thing he says you stop and you go make it right with that brother is that right well what about if it's on the other side of the coin what about if I'm the one that's respondent to having been offended what do we do then God didn't leave us without instruction just as the instructed us on this he instructed us on the other we find later on this same chapter or the same book of Matthew back in the 18th chapter we come and we find a man by the name of Peter excuse me ma'am by the name of Peter comes to Jesus it said Lord how awful anselmo often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him how many times a man do I have to put up with Jim backing into my car dope that guy know how to drive and then Peter says til seven times and if you look in the the book that was quoted on this is the rori Study Bible amen published by Moody press I mean it talks about back in those days why why did why did Peter say seven when he picked seven times I wonder death yeah but if you look at there it said back in the days of the Jewish laws and all the things he said there was a law of them he said the Jews they were a brother could offend you once he could offend you twice he could offend you three times but after that it was gloves off it was that was it that was done he had three times the charm so you know what Peters feeling real benevolent feeling real good about himself he said Lord how many time do I have to forgive my brother when he sends against me he says I'll double it and add a little four boot he says til six times no seven times you know what Jesus looks at him he says I say unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven if you look that up in a little thing when you click on it with a with a computer that means countless times nots 490 times it means countless times he says don't not just once but countless times and I'm so glad that's the spirit that God had he didn't say oh brother Jim I'll forgive you this time but don't make that same mistake again no matter how many times I make a mistake no matter how many times I fall he's willing to forgive me countless times a man he puts my sins in to see a God for he just forgives me time after time after time amen oh I'm so glad of that if it wasn't just all forgive you for your two times but I've had it up to here no he said he says his mercy endureth forever oh thank God I mean if that spirit is us we'll have the same spirit towards a brother or a sister no matter how many times if it broke Jim you know how hard that is maybe it sure for us it's hard but with him all things are possible in there it's with the spirit that's in it that we can do that amen not by ourselves he says countless times therefore and then he begins to tell a little parable I want to share this with you tonight therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain King which would take account of his servants now we began to reckon one he brought unto Him which owed and he began to reckon him and you know what that word reckon means it means to keep an account of what's going on with your servants he said the King began to look at the account that was you know how many singer/song an old account was large and growing every day how many ever sing a song because I was always sinning and never stopped to pay and when I look me above and saw such pain and woe I went on to the keeper and I sailed it long ago I got it reconciled they mean well if you haven't sung it's a good song hey bit but it there was a record in heaven being kept and God says you know what I want that record done away with I want that record to be put in a sea of God's for you I want that record never the more I don't want any more reckoning to be done him in he said when he began to reckon with one who brought unto Him which owed him ten thousand talents but for as much as he could not pay his LORD commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children all that he had and payment to be made and the servant therefore fell down and worst was saying Lord have patience me I will pay you all and the Lord of a servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave his dead a perfect type of Jesus Christ he was telling a parable you know parable is a story that that depicts a truth or or or something they want to make known and he told this story and that's exactly what Jesus did for you and me amen i order debt I could not pay he paid a debt he did not owe him an I needed someone to wash the slate clean hey man and he sent his life's blood and he washed that slate clean for me tonight I stand here completely forgiven because of what God did for me on television aren't you glad for that thank you oh that's a spirit that was in my Lord amen he had compassion he loved me so much he said be kind one to another forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake forgave you if that spirits in us tonight Church amen we'll do it the same way he did he said but then what happened he said the servant fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience me and the Lord forgave him but that same servant went out and found one of his fellow-servants that owed him a hundred pence I owe two million bucks I went out and found somebody there owed me ten dollars Church hey man can you imagine this the great sin debt that was upon each one of us in Christ just Frank frankly forgave us all he just forgave us all but then he went on he began to tell are you seeing what the Lord is trying to say here she said that same sever went out and found one of his fellow-servants which owed him a hundred pence and he laid hands on him he took him by the throat saying pay me what you owe me and a fellow servant fell down just like I did and said Oh forgive me have patience with me I'll pay everything that I owe you and he would not but he cast him into prison - he should pay the dead and when a fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry they came and told their Lord what all that was done and the Lord after the Lord after that he had called him said unto Him thou wicked servant we come to church and we just act so holy we come to church we act just so pious amen but yet we can't forgive a brother one little offence when God forgave us of all that he did we come to church and we hold oh you don't know what that brother said he wouldn't even shake my hand after church maybe he didn't see you maybe he was busy I don't know but you know how many problems build up over one little molehill like that one little thing you know that Jesus said that's wicked is a wicked spirit that's not the Holy Spirit he says that wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because simply because you asked me to simply because that's what your desire was he says should thou not have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as I had pity on you shouldn't you have done the very same thing Church hey shouldn't we have the same thing on the brother hey man after Christ has forgiven us all of our sin all of our debts have been all that great account that was grown shouldn't we have stunned the same thing to our brothers and sisters tonight yes absolutely the Lord was wrought and he said you wicked servant i forgave you all should you not have done it had pity on thee as I had pity on thee the lure was raw and the Bible said they delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due him you know that word tormenters it's it's it's from the same root word we read over in Matthew the eighth chapter says when Jesus entered the Capernaum he came at him a Centurion beseeching the same Lord my servant live the home sick of the palsy grievously tormented he was sick he would die he was in great pain physically great pain Jesus said I'll come in healing that word torment means to vex to be Grievous to have grievious pains in the body or the mind to be harassed to be distressed the same root word loot over in Luke 2:16 chapter he said then he'll he lifted up his eyes talking about that rich young ruler he said he'll he lift up his eyes being in torment seeing Abraham afar off and Lazarus boozing and he cried and said father Abraham have mercy on me said Lazarus the tip dip the tip of his finger in the water to cool my tongue for I am tormented by these flames he was in intense pain that word is a Greek word Amen I'm not gonna try to pronounce it either he said it cause it means to cause intense pain to be an anguish to be tormented to torment or distress oneself amen and Jesus said he turned him over to the tormentors because he wouldn't forgive his brother he turned him over to the tormentors Church I wonder how many people sit in church and they are tormented they are in great pain they're in great anguish amen because I mean they look at her brother comes to the door they think of that little odd that he committed and rather than just forgiving saying all right you know I know you didn't mean to do it and move on like Christ did for our sake like the Bible says we are to do forgive one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you he says they sit when they sit right there he says how many married people hey men who marriage goes awry amen that person just constantly with a bitter spirit him and it just begins to eat away and I'm gonna eat away at him and eat away at him and all of a sudden they just find himself constantly in misery they can't even worship God he says so likewise shall the Heavenly Father do also unto you if from your heart you forgive not every one his brother their trespasses so well this is just a this is just a parable brother Jim the parable ended in verse 34 he said now he says that's exactly what'll happen to you that's exactly what happened to me we can't come here and worship God we can't come here and claim to be the bride of Jesus Christ when we're in torment we're eating alive with it poison acid of jealousy and malice brother branham culpa he says you can't come and worship what that is he says you need to do what Jesus Christ did you need to if the Spirit of Christ is really in us this evening church if that spirit is really in us we will look to the brother and do what brother Branham said in Christ the mystery here we are going back to that same scripture that same message we used this morning we're talking about Christ being revealed in the bride in this hour right the Spirit of Christ being revealed in the bride in this hour he said if her brother you think he's a little wrong or a sister say Lord don't let never let me have the root of bitterness bring up in me he says cuz it'll affect him whoa not just you it'll affect him it'll take the Christ out of my life that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred it will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you or to run him away from a tabernacle it'll kill the Spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor do everything don't do that he says that's not the Spirit of Christ he says you just waxed that much closer if the spirits in you yes you just waxed that much closer drop the buckle love one another anyhow talk nice about one of their say nice think about what he says then then God will bless you you know why the churches sometimes aren't being blessed you know why there's people sitting there in anguish and torment that's because we're still not manifesting that spirit of forgiveness in our lives the Bible says that we are to grieve not the Spirit of God whereby we are sealed unto the day of redemption doesn't say that spirit wasn't there it says we grieve that spirit away from us Amen how is it he said by having an unforgiving spirit yes sir Church we can sit here and claim to be bride and wonder why we don't get something out of the service and wonder why things aren't moving and wonder why brother Jesse can't break through or wonder why we can't seem to get the victory amen if we would search our hearts tonight each one of us search our hearts tonight and say where's that spirit of forgiveness in me am i manifesting a christ-like spirit amen or am I still having a problem am I still fighting with this thing if I still holding this bitterness they men towards a brother or sister when they've already asked me to forgive them yes or maybe I need to go to someone who who I have offended and I sit here and say well I've made it all right with God him and contrary to the word wonder why we can't get the victory Church hey man I want you to know one thing if we have a problem like that we can call ourselves bride all day long but that spirit is not being manifested in our lives believe it tonight I got about they're hours worth of stuff but I could go to him in I think I'm gonna stop right there tonight if that's all right brother Jesse maybe just stand your feet with me the secret when your brother offends you Church what do you do when your brother offends you do you hold that bitterness in your heart or do you say you know Lord God I forgive you just as God for Christ's sakes forgave us man let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sakes forgive you if we failed to do that if we try to do it our way and say well I made it right with God or or I just you know the brother should just get over it and this side the other event or if we just can't quite get rid of that little funny feeling we have towards somebody when they've come and ask us amen call and claim to be bride of Jesus I'm here to tell you tonight Church we can know whether we're bright or night if that Spirit of Christ is in us and his spirit was the spirit of forgiveness would you bow your heads with me this evening I wonder tonight Amen if we'd be honest in our hearts if there's some here that know that they need to go make something right with somebody and say well Jim just give me the strength to go and do what the Word of God says to do if there was someone that that maybe you've offended and you need to go and get that person reconciled I mean because God has given us that spirit reconciliation amen and you haven't done it yet amen know that you're contrary to the Word of God if you're in that position you like say Oh Jim just pray for me that I would be able to get this thing taken care of and the person would receive it in the spirit of Christ it just took your hands they pray for me budget maybe you're on the other side of the coin and amen that person has come to you and you just hold them you just can't seem to quite get over there every time you see them there's a little bit off and it is eating away at the eating wait wait you know what it'll finally do that acid I want the Bride of Christ to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that that spirit is in thing I want to add brother calms him and we'll say brother I won't forgive you just like Christ forgave me and it's just I could never happen and that friendship is renewed and we're restored in the fellowship it's like I am this crushed because God for Christ's sake forgave me when I came and I just simply asked Lord if there's someone in here with that problem tonight or God for those that indicated they have needed prayer in this area father we ask that you were just common ministers have your way Lord God maybe not a message we would shout over and or jumped and run the island the Lord God a serious time as we see the Day approaching amen do we see the spirit of forgiveness in our lives it's got to be there helpless father forgive us where it's not have your way in this service tonight for I speak to someone's heart that they might deal honestly or God to know in Jesus name Amen brother Jesse in binding prayer - sure glad pray
