[31:49] days with the Saints to get in one
[31:52] Accord and then the fire the wind the
[31:55] testimonies just wonderful super
[31:57] Supernatural works here by the grace of
[31:59] God Acts chapter 5 verse one it's very
[32:03] course Very uh sobering chapter you know
[32:05] I guess you know I was trying to preach
[32:07] a sober message on the Sunday evening
[32:10] there you know with the recent current
[32:11] events and this is a very sober chapter
[32:14] here as
[32:16] well the grace of the Lord Acts chapter
[32:19] 5 verse
[32:25] one I'll read verse one and two and then
[32:27] we can read verse three together here
[32:29] but a certain man named ananas with
[32:31] safire his wife sold a possession and
[32:33] kept back part of the price his wife
[32:36] also being privy to it and brought a
[32:38] certain part and laid it at the apostles
[32:41] feet but Peter said ananas I'm sorry I'm
[32:45] sorry let's read verse four three
[32:46] together ready one two three but Peter
[32:49] said ananas why hath Satan filled thine
[32:53] heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to
[32:56] keep back part of the price of the land
[32:59] amen may God add his Blessing to the
[33:01] read of his word you may be seated
[33:02] praise
[33:03] God very sobering text here watch the
[33:07] time by God's grace Andy for my
[33:12] sake sobering uh topic you know as we
[33:16] mentioned on Sunday night with death
[33:17] anytime death is involved it's a very
[33:19] sobering topic and so here we find in
[33:21] the early church uh this is the first
[33:24] moment we'd say of death in the church
[33:28] and so here we see uh this of course
[33:31] follows chapter 4 uh the Bible said in
[33:34] verse 30 three that the apostles were
[33:37] given great power and witness of the
[33:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ and great
[33:42] grace was upon them all notice that
[33:44] great fear and great grace remember
[33:47] church this is what God wants to restore
[33:49] in our church hallelujah we're restoring
[33:52] we're going back we're the Omega here's
[33:55] the alpha so we got to pattern our Our
[33:57] Lives after the book of Acts Hallelujah
[33:58] we've been doing it since we come in the
[34:00] message you know wife and I been doing
[34:02] that since you know about 2001 end of
[34:04] 20012 2002 so here we are about 21 years
[34:08] trying to pattern Our Lives after the
[34:10] book of Acts praise God it's been a
[34:11] tremendous experience if I can use that
[34:13] word from the song Our God is tremendous
[34:15] amen it's been tremendous because of
[34:17] where we came from we know where we came
[34:19] from and we're thankful where we are
[34:21] right now praise God we can clearly see
[34:23] that our desire is to be like the book
[34:25] of Acts church and notice in verse 34
[34:27] chapter 4 uh neither was there any of
[34:31] them that
[34:32] lacked because the people that owned
[34:34] houses or possessions or lands maybe
[34:36] extra they went and sold it in order to
[34:39] feed all these poor Christians okay
[34:42] because there was 3,000 remember the
[34:44] Bible said that God added daily so this
[34:46] was a church you know multiplying
[34:48] multiplying um and so they needed food I
[34:52] love this God already had it prepared
[34:53] God always has everything we need
[34:55] already prepared of hallelujah it's
[34:57] already taken care of Amen so when
[34:59] there's a need you know God will raise
[35:01] up somebody to take care of that need
[35:03] it's already taken care of praise God
[35:04] just like with brother brandham you know
[35:06] he had the IRS case what what do you
[35:07] have to pay back I think it was 50,000
[35:09] or 40,000 he's like how can I ever do
[35:11] this well God already had millionaires
[35:13] in the church to pay for it I don't know
[35:15] if brother could ever pay them back or
[35:17] not I don't think he did but God already
[35:20] had it provided praise God if the devil
[35:21] pulls a scheme against you God's going
[35:23] to bail you out praise God God knows God
[35:26] had to allow in the first place right so
[35:27] God knew all about it Hallelujah and it
[35:30] was an unjust thing but God bailed out
[35:32] brother brandham Hallelujah because
[35:33] brother Bram did nothing wrong uh but
[35:35] here we see that God already had
[35:37] Believers that had lands and possessions
[35:41] and gladly sold them just to give the
[35:43] people food shelter or clothing just to
[35:46] put clothes on the backs of the
[35:47] Christians praise God and they just laid
[35:50] the money at the apostles feet praise
[35:52] God and then but we see that here we see
[35:55] uh uh these Believers now socalled
[35:58] Believers right they weren't really
[36:01] Believers and the the point of that is
[36:03] because the the Bible said Peter said
[36:06] Satan filled their heart that's very
[36:09] specific language that's the same
[36:11] language for Judas
[36:12] scariot Satan filled their hearts their
[36:15] hearts were not filled with the Holy
[36:16] Ghost aren't you glad your heart is
[36:18] filled with God's spirit amen hallelujah
[36:20] praise God Amen aren't you glad
[36:22] Hallelujah but see anti and of fire they
[36:24] were make believers they were just like
[36:26] Judas
[36:28] right they were just like Judas because
[36:31] they were hanging around and remember
[36:33] you know this is this is very deep
[36:34] teaching here I'm going to just just
[36:35] rehearse some deep teaching here
[36:38] people's names can be blotted off the
[36:39] book of life before they're born
[36:42] again right so in other words somebody
[36:45] could be saved but then they could sell
[36:48] that out like Judas right the Bible said
[36:50] his name was on uh the book Jesus said
[36:52] don't Rejoice because you can cast out
[36:54] Devils Rejoice because your names are in
[36:56] heaven
[36:57] but Jesus said if you don't serve God he
[36:58] said I'll blot your name off if you
[37:00] don't overcome I'll blot your name out
[37:02] so we know that's what happened with
[37:03] Judas right none of the disciples knew
[37:06] the the the the thief's heart that was
[37:07] in his heart right none of them knew
[37:09] that he hid that from everybody but he
[37:11] couldn't hit it hide it from God
[37:12] Allelujah because Jesus searches
[37:14] constantly the hearts of the Believers
[37:17] he searches the Reigns of our hearts and
[37:20] so that's a very deep teaching some
[37:21] people say well uh they they take the
[37:23] calvinistic side you know if you're
[37:25] saved there's nothing you can ever do to
[37:26] lose it that's wrong right but then some
[37:29] take the Armenian side you know you can
[37:31] be filled with the Holy Ghost and then
[37:32] be lost no that's not true either the
[37:35] truth is once you're sealed with the
[37:37] Holy Ghost then there's no way you can
[37:38] lose salvation praise God and even for
[37:41] foolish virgins once they're saved
[37:43] they're always saved they can't they
[37:45] can't get saved and then get lost and
[37:46] get saved and get lost they're always
[37:48] saved they Jes Jesus said they've
[37:50] already passed from Death un life and
[37:52] Jesus has the for knowledge that they
[37:54] will never sell it out praise God so it
[37:57] all depends on your perspective is it
[37:58] man's perspective or is it God's
[38:00] perspective even for the foolish virgin
[38:03] God's perspective is they were always
[38:05] saved they were always my Remnant they
[38:07] could not never be lost hallelujah amen
[38:10] but it's those make Believers that they
[38:12] can go through the acts of being saved
[38:15] and they can be forgiven but then they
[38:17] can sell it out and we saw many examples
[38:19] you know like we have Judas okay we have
[38:21] balum and there's other examples I can't
[38:23] think of right now but I made a video on
[38:25] it and we could maybe watch that time
[38:27] but the point is here that this these
[38:29] two are definitely of the Judas es
[38:31] scariot and notice what caused it again
[38:35] money see church we got to be real
[38:37] careful with money right they lied about
[38:39] their money and we'll look at this here
[38:42] in just a moment but look so what got
[38:44] Judas money got Judas think about that
[38:47] he saw Jesus multiply the fish and but
[38:49] he was but he was he knew God could do
[38:51] great things but he got so caught up in
[38:53] what money he had right he saw Jesus
[38:56] Jesus could multiply all these things if
[38:57] Jesus can multiply all that can he
[38:59] multiply what I have need of
[39:02] right but he got so caught up that he
[39:04] sold out Christ and he even LED them to
[39:07] arrest him right he he was he led them
[39:10] to persecute Jesus he led them to that
[39:13] but a real child of God wouldn't do that
[39:15] praise God now look but look a real
[39:17] child of God will they sometimes deny
[39:19] Christ like Peter they
[39:20] might but they'll always come back
[39:23] they'll always repent no matter how long
[39:25] it takes they'll come back because they
[39:26] are genuine predestinated child of God
[39:29] hallelujah amen like I had a gentleman
[39:32] I'm not going to name his name but
[39:33] there's a gentleman and he's emailed me
[39:35] over the years and he he was the one
[39:37] that was weeping when I made that video
[39:39] about 25 acts that you can labor for the
[39:41] Lord and will bless it he said I was
[39:43] raised in the message I just got the
[39:44] email this week he said and everybody
[39:47] when I was growing up told me I had
[39:49] gifts of the holy spirit maybe it was
[39:50] preacher I don't know what it was some
[39:51] type of gift but then he said uh he
[39:55] backs he said I now I have all these
[39:57] Wasted Years and he said but now I've
[40:00] come back to God and but my family seen
[40:02] me waste all these years I walked away
[40:03] from the message and he said without
[40:05] God's help I'll never be able to repair
[40:07] my family situation now Church think
[40:09] about how God has blessed some of us
[40:11] where we don't have those situations he
[40:13] don't know if his wife or children could
[40:15] ever forgive him for the evils that he
[40:16] did but he's come back to God and he
[40:19] wants to serve God and he wanted to know
[40:21] you know if I have a gift will God use
[40:23] me I said
[40:24] absolutely I said God God could use Paul
[40:28] when Paul hold the he held the coats of
[40:30] the men that murdered
[40:32] Stephen if God could use Paul and how
[40:35] did God use Paul Paul said it wasn't me
[40:37] it was the grace of God that was in me
[40:39] amen hallelujah I said yes you always
[40:42] have those memories you always have that
[40:43] guilt but use that as motivation God
[40:45] looked past all my my mistakes God
[40:48] brought me back even though I made those
[40:50] mistakes and so I'm going to use that as
[40:52] motivation I'll never do that again
[40:54] hallelujah amen I haven't heard back
[40:56] from him I'm hoping to get a good email
[40:58] back from him I've told that to people
[41:00] before you got to use your mistakes as
[41:02] motivation remember the Revenge sermon
[41:03] we did a few weeks ago you got to make
[41:06] any failures you got to use that and and
[41:08] say I'm gonna take revenge on that I
[41:10] won't do it again by God's grace
[41:13] Hallelujah see the child of God will
[41:15] always come back to
[41:17] God remember brother man you know that
[41:19] woman that ran up to him on the current
[41:20] of time R said oh she said my precious
[41:23] brother he said I don't even know who
[41:24] she was and the voice said brother ra
[41:26] you baptized her when she was past
[41:28] 90 amen she said if you wouldn't have
[41:31] went I would not have been here see God
[41:33] has a predestinated plan for every
[41:35] Ministry praise God see think about that
[41:38] a 90y old you know let's not give up
[41:40] let's keep trusting God let's keep
[41:41] praying to God let's see what God will
[41:43] do Hallelujah if they're predestinated
[41:46] they'll be there and if they're
[41:47] predestinated for you you'll have some
[41:49] part in it praise God you'll be either
[41:51] praying for it or you'll be involved
[41:52] with it praise God Amen but see these
[41:56] were the Judas es
[41:58] scariot so they sold a certain amount
[42:01] you know they saw the Believers doing
[42:02] that and look it's all say Judas is
[42:04] always trying to imitate just like Cain
[42:06] Cain was trying to imitate the real
[42:08] worshipper but they can't do it the
[42:10] right way see they they did it they did
[42:12] it the wrong way they came and laid it
[42:14] at the apostles feet and said let's say
[42:16] they sold it for 10,000 but really they
[42:18] sold it for
[42:20] 20,000 they kept back part of the price
[42:24] and laid it at the apostles feet and
[42:25] they had a greed let's lie to the man of
[42:28] God let's lie to the church in other
[42:31] words but Peter and now notice here's
[42:33] the next gift we see and this is a
[42:35] powerful gift it's called
[42:38] discernment now maybe this was Vision as
[42:40] well we don't know for sure we're not
[42:42] told if he had we know Peter was a
[42:43] prophet no doubt about that just read
[42:46] the book of H first Peter and second
[42:47] Peter especially second Peter chapter 3
[42:49] where it speaks of the day of fervent
[42:50] heat no doubt he's a prophet but we're
[42:53] not told all we know is somehow he
[42:55] judges the spirit and says no you didn't
[42:57] sell for that
[42:58] amount he says you've lied to the Holy
[43:01] Ghost and verse four and while remain
[43:03] was it not thine
[43:05] own and after it was sold was it not
[43:07] thine own power it was yours the whole
[43:09] time why hast thou to conceive this
[43:12] thing in thine heart thou not lied unto
[43:14] men but unto God see they were not lying
[43:18] to Peter they were lying to God but they
[43:21] lied to God's Representatives they lied
[43:23] to God's children so it was if they were
[43:25] lying to God didn't Jesus say when
[43:28] you've done it unto me you've done it to
[43:30] the least of these my brethren amen
[43:32] hallelujah when people mistreat you
[43:34] they're not mistreating you really
[43:35] they're mistreating Christ but when
[43:37] people bless you they're blessing Jesus
[43:39] amen same thing
[43:43] hallelujah oh
[43:46] my and ananas hearing these words fell
[43:49] down and gave up The Ghost and great
[43:51] fear Came Upon all them that heard these
[43:53] things now last night in our Bible time
[43:55] we just read about Lev
[43:57] uh now he was faithful at the beginning
[43:58] but I think he got off at the end that's
[44:00] just my humble opinion anyways he was in
[44:02] that meeting brother R's meeting where a
[44:04] young man and woman came and sitting on
[44:06] the front row and they were kissing and
[44:07] hugging all over in front of everybody
[44:09] and brother Lee said he was right there
[44:11] he said I think he said that was the
[44:12] most nervous he'd ever been in his
[44:14] life because he felt the the he felt the
[44:17] Holiness of God against this couple kind
[44:20] of kissing and slopping all over each
[44:22] other and brother Ram tells the
[44:24] testimony later brother raham says uh
[44:27] speak whatever you desire the holy
[44:29] spirit says speak whatever you speak
[44:31] it'll be brother could have judged them
[44:34] and what would happened they would have
[44:35] died or brother ramam could have mercy
[44:38] and it's on the tape brother raham says
[44:40] I give you your
[44:41] lives and they have mercy and brother
[44:43] level said that was the most uh hardest
[44:46] I ever prayed in my whole life that God
[44:47] would show Mercy on these people see a
[44:50] real child of God they don't have
[44:52] Vengeance in their heart they don't want
[44:54] to see bad things happen to people they
[44:56] want to see people repent praise God now
[44:59] look brother Ram was given the same
[45:01] power that Peter had right here why had
[45:03] the same baptism amen hallelujah had the
[45:06] same Doctrine Hallelujah the same word
[45:08] amen same power Hallelujah he spoke to
[45:11] Little Fish and the fish's life came
[45:13] back Hallelujah he spoke to little posum
[45:16] and the mother posum was well hallelujah
[45:18] amen hallelujah same God same word same
[45:22] power
[45:24] hallelujah amen
[45:27] it's the same same gospel like we said
[45:28] last
[45:29] week and this you know Malachi also
[45:32] actually brought up last night this
[45:33] reminds us of Elisha with the she Bears
[45:35] was it 42 children I think 42 children
[45:38] lost their lives now we don't know if
[45:40] that like brother said was that just
[45:41] Elisha being angry or was that one of
[45:43] these Peter
[45:45] moments
[45:47] right so we don't know but here Peter
[45:51] clearly has a a case where he's got life
[45:54] and death in his power
[45:57] but Church what's interesting look at
[45:58] the grace of God and hopefully this
[46:00] makes somebody say Amen here look at the
[46:02] grace of God it wasn't long before this
[46:04] Peter lied three times about
[46:09] Christ I don't know him I don't know him
[46:12] I've only lived with them for three and
[46:13] a half years I don't know the man I've
[46:14] only walked on water I've only cast out
[46:16] Devils I've only preached for him for
[46:17] all these things I don't know the
[46:20] man and yet God didn't strike him down
[46:22] what is that that's Divine Mercy amen
[46:25] that's for knowledge amen hallelujah
[46:28] that's God's Sovereign will in other
[46:30] words God knew Peter would repent of it
[46:32] praise God but apparently ananas and Z
[46:34] fire would never repent of it just like
[46:37] Judas instead of Judas going back and
[46:40] saying Jesus forgive me I'm sorry he
[46:42] would and hung himself see it's got to
[46:45] be
[46:46] predestination here's a man that lied
[46:49] not long ago but then he says that these
[46:52] people lied to the Holy Ghost and they
[46:54] die not him him that is the grace of God
[46:58] if I've ever seen it what about Sarah
[47:01] lied right to God's
[47:03] face God said no you did laughe no you
[47:07] did laugh Sarah brother man tells us God
[47:10] couldn't strike her because she's part
[47:12] of Abraham she's part of the promise and
[47:14] see Peter was a part of Christ amen but
[47:17] don't don't forget you're a part of
[47:18] Christ too hallelujah amen because when
[47:21] you make mistakes when I make mistakes
[47:23] what do we do we come back to Jesus
[47:25] Hallelujah
[47:26] try me again amen forgive me again I
[47:29] want to serve you that wasn't the real
[47:31] me like Lena was telling us Lena says
[47:33] she loves that Romans 7 scripture it's
[47:35] not I that sin it's the sin that dwells
[47:37] within me praise God the things that I
[47:40] want to do I don't do sometimes the
[47:42] things that I I don't want to do things
[47:43] I hate that's what I do but it wasn't me
[47:46] it wasn't the real J it wasn't the real
[47:47] Soul it wasn't the real soul of the
[47:49] believer it was a sin nature and God's
[47:52] got Mercy for that sin's already been
[47:54] judged Hallelujah
[47:56] amen it's already been judged but your
[47:59] Soul's already been forgiven praise God
[48:02] my sins already been judged my soul's
[48:04] already been forgiven hallelujah it's
[48:07] past tense
[48:09] Hallelujah that's why Peter a man who
[48:11] lied can get up there and say you've
[48:13] lied to the Holy
[48:14] Ghost now he's got more power now he's
[48:17] on a different level he's followed On's
[48:20] he's coming to canaan's land amen he's
[48:23] crossed over Jordan in canaan's land and
[48:26] this is like heaven to Peter praise God
[48:29] he's got the Holy Ghost now praise
[48:31] God like we were saying those brothers
[48:33] that argue about who's well not argue
[48:35] but uh praise each other as the greatest
[48:37] of all time how can they be born again I
[48:39] don't know I'll leave that up to God but
[48:41] Peter was no longer arguing about who's
[48:43] greater he he knew the only one that was
[48:44] great that was
[48:46] Christ because they lied to the Holy
[48:48] Ghost didn't lie to
[48:51] Peter oh it's a fearful
[48:54] thing the Bible said in verse six that
[48:57] the young man arose wound him up carried
[48:58] him out and buried him and it was about
[49:01] the space of three hours after when his
[49:03] wife not knowing what was done came in
[49:06] and Peter answered unto her tell me
[49:07] whether ye sold the land for so much and
[49:09] she said yay for so much now look at
[49:12] that Satan had so filled her heart she
[49:15] she couldn't even sense that something
[49:17] had happened there she couldn't even
[49:18] sense the severity the seriousness of
[49:21] the
[49:22] atmosphere see they she had to been like
[49:24] Judas she's beyond the point of feeling
[49:27] the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit like
[49:30] I can just walk in here amongst the
[49:31] church I can just lie like I can li like
[49:34] I lie anywhere like I'm in a bar like
[49:36] I'm in a I don't know wherever Library
[49:40] whatever you can't do that she lost her
[49:43] sense uh the Bible said her conscience
[49:45] has been
[49:47] seared and she couldn't sense the fact
[49:49] that my husband died something happened
[49:51] to him she couldn't even sense
[49:53] that she was so far far
[49:57] beyond verse 9 then Peter said to her
[49:59] how is it that ye have agreed together
[50:01] to tempt the spirit of the
[50:04] Lord behold the feet of them which have
[50:07] buried thy husband are at the door and
[50:08] shall carry thee out then she fell she
[50:11] and then fell she down straightway at
[50:13] his feet and yielded up The Ghost and
[50:15] the young man came in and found her dead
[50:17] and carrying her forth buried her by her
[50:20] husband and great fear Came Upon all the
[50:21] church and upon as many as heard these
[50:24] things
[50:26] now I was reading uh Billy Paul's
[50:27] testimony Billy Paul said he's seen that
[50:29] a couple times in brother bram's
[50:30] meetings where brother bradam would say
[50:33] something and then people would just
[50:34] speak out against it and the people
[50:36] would die I think it was two times I
[50:38] think Billy Paul said and it had to pack
[50:40] people out dead in the meetings because
[50:43] they defied the spirit of God it's a
[50:46] fearful thing to fall in the hands of an
[50:48] Angry God it's a fearful thing like I
[50:51] told you before the most close I've ever
[50:54] seen to this was when that uh our former
[50:56] Church blasphemed God's revelation on
[51:00] serpent seed and they had a whole couple
[51:02] years of 20 funerals or something like
[51:04] that uh it was told to me it was a
[51:06] season of death to speak against the
[51:09] word of God like
[51:11] that so what does it make us do it makes
[51:13] us be careful what comes out of our
[51:15] mouth but church we don't live in fear
[51:18] now we live in we live in the fear of
[51:20] God respect of God but we don't live in
[51:22] fear like well I'm going to be one of
[51:23] those lost ones no you know you know
[51:26] you're that's not in your heart you know
[51:28] God the Bible said I love this scripture
[51:30] the Bible said God is able to keep you
[51:32] from falling amen you don't want to fall
[51:35] so God's able to keep you from falling
[51:38] that's how I know I'm not going to fall
[51:39] amen he's able to keep me praise I've
[51:41] been TR I've asked him to keep me from
[51:43] going too far praise God I've asked him
[51:47] so he's faithful praise
[51:50] God none of us would ever look at acts 5
[51:53] and say well that could be me someday
[51:54] impossible ible I never go that far why
[51:58] because he's changed me praise God Amen
[52:01] Hallelujah I'd rather be if if I had the
[52:03] choice i' rather be you know I'm saying
[52:06] like this I I I I want to be so safe in
[52:08] Christ I'd rather be the poor person in
[52:10] this situation getting the hand me outs
[52:13] than the rich person I would say Lord
[52:16] put me on that side put me as far away
[52:18] from being a Judas as I possibly can let
[52:20] me be a real Saint let me be a real
[52:22] believer keep me from falling praise God
[52:28] heyen like brother BR said brother Ram
[52:30] said you know when he
[52:33] saw maybe you heard this lately said
[52:35] brother said when he saw Oral Roberts
[52:39] University he said they have millions of
[52:41] dollars he said I think they have a
[52:43] hundred typewriters typing up all the
[52:44] letters and brother BR said I got one
[52:45] little typewriter he said Lord I guess
[52:48] you couldn't trust me with that much
[52:49] money now we don't know one way or the
[52:52] other but brother Ram looked at it like
[52:54] it was God's doing
[52:56] brother R said so see now he said now I
[52:58] don't got to go beg for money every
[53:00] service the church
[53:03] said he said and and Oral Roberts has to
[53:06] go to the big church look he has to
[53:07] compromise and he has to go to the big
[53:09] churches where they're giving big
[53:10] offerings I think he said I got he's got
[53:11] to get $10,000 per day that was back in
[53:14] the 60s what do they got to get now I
[53:17] see all these sellouts you know uh
[53:19] they're like you know even today all the
[53:21] Benny henss of the world are like I feel
[53:23] you know they'll read like a verse like
[53:24] it's uh
[53:26] you know Psalm 119 ver10 all those
[53:28] numbers are up to like let's say
[53:30] 1, you know 19 something dollars they'll
[53:34] say the Lord tells me that's the verse
[53:36] for you and you got to send me
[53:38] $1,190 come on that's you don't see that
[53:41] in the
[53:42] scripture it's just it's a it's a fake
[53:44] discernment it's a lie and anybody with
[53:47] the Bible said anybody with any
[53:49] discernment would know that's a lie the
[53:51] elect cannot be deceived praise God
[53:56] Hallelujah but brother bam said that you
[53:58] know he just took it as if I'm poor if
[54:00] my Ministry is smaller then that must be
[54:02] God's Will and church that's what I want
[54:03] to say
[54:04] too if I'm small and nothing I'd rather
[54:07] be that God Must Have Known that's the
[54:09] right thing for me praise God because I
[54:11] know I'm right in my father's hand
[54:13] hallelujah amen hallelujah I know my
[54:15] life and I'm trying to live as close as
[54:17] I can to Christ I know I'm right where
[54:19] he wants me to be I don't want to be
[54:20] anywhere else I want to be where Jesus
[54:22] wants me to be praise
[54:24] God
[54:25] Glory
[54:28] Hallelujah you know we just humbly say
[54:30] Lord if I miss anything then just show
[54:32] me and correct me
[54:37] Hallelujah so we're given discernment
[54:39] he's given power of life and
[54:42] death Peter's given that a man who used
[54:46] to
[54:47] lie
[54:49] right but God forgave him praise God God
[54:52] gave him another chance hallelujah oh a
[54:55] beautiful
[54:56] testimony God's mercy on Peter you know
[54:58] we've been talking about Peter a lot
[54:59] lately so I don't know I think Lydia
[55:01] wants to write a book about him sometime
[55:04] rightn now I just found this website I
[55:06] just want to read a few things I was
[55:08] just trying to get some other ideas you
[55:09] know I read some quotes from Brother
[55:10] brand just a moment but this one website
[55:12] said God allowed it because he ofor sin
[55:16] and this was the beginning of the church
[55:17] this is the birth the the brand new
[55:20] church and this is the first major sin
[55:22] that came in the church lying lying
[55:25] about
[55:26] money right and they have all these
[55:28] examples of all these men just given all
[55:30] let's say let's call 10 grand or
[55:31] whatever land today is pretty
[55:33] valuable let's say 100,000 okay that's
[55:36] about how much land would probably be
[55:37] today if not more they lay a 100,000 and
[55:41] then these two Liars come up and say
[55:43] well we sell this for for for 20,000 but
[55:46] they're keeping 880,000 no wonder God
[55:48] would allow
[55:51] that so God AB that sin second
[55:54] it's
[55:55] hypocrisy they're trying to act like
[55:58] they're generous but they're they're
[56:00] thieves so God judged it because of the
[56:02] hypocrisy and third it was a lesson for
[56:06] the rest of the church keep the church
[56:09] clean don't try to lie to the Holy Ghost
[56:13] so Church you think God likes an honest
[56:15] person or a
[56:16] liar God likes honesty this example
[56:20] should prove it to us plainly God wants
[56:22] us to be
[56:23] honest
[56:25] Hallelujah and remember this is not Old
[56:28] Testament well brother J that's just the
[56:29] Old Testament this is the brand new New
[56:31] Testament Holy Ghost filled church amen
[56:33] this the book of Acts church amen these
[56:35] are these acts 238 youngans Hallelujah
[56:37] that's the only kind the word can bring
[56:39] forth
[56:40] Hallelujah so we should strive to be
[56:43] like this it shows God hates sin
[56:46] wholeheartedly God hates
[56:50] hypocrisy so this is these are make
[56:53] believers and God judged their bold
[56:57] flagrant sin I like that God hates
[57:01] covetousness see they were Covetous they
[57:03] were thinking well I want to take care
[57:05] of me but I want to make myself look
[57:06] good in front of the
[57:08] church right they're
[57:10] Covetous I'll give a little bit but I'm
[57:13] keeping most of it yeah all these other
[57:15] people are like I'm just trusting
[57:18] God see hypocrisy and they desired the
[57:22] praise of men they wanted to be like
[57:24] these other
[57:25] people that played a part in the church
[57:27] and feeding others they want to look
[57:29] like everybody else but yet keep some
[57:31] back for
[57:32] themselves so see they never really had
[57:34] Faith to begin
[57:36] with right because if they had Faith
[57:38] they would have said well God gave it to
[57:39] me and I'm led by the Holy Spirit to
[57:41] give it and I'm I have nothing to worry
[57:42] about because God's leading me to do
[57:44] this that's just what the Bible said the
[57:47] Bible said God just wants us to be
[57:48] cheerful givers and the church said it's
[57:51] whatever you give is fine just be glad
[57:53] about it just be glad you got something
[57:54] something to give hallelujah
[57:59] amen that's what God loves God doesn't
[58:01] like a ly Giver right like an is's fire
[58:06] so this is a reminder to us that God
[58:08] looks at the heart no matter what we say
[58:10] no matter what we try to project the
[58:11] church God is looking at our
[58:14] hearts God's looking at the truth God
[58:16] hates sin and God wants the church to be
[58:20] pure that's why I saying refiner fire
[58:23] tonight God wants a pure
[58:26] church that's honest and gives just out
[58:29] of the generosity no matter what they
[58:30] give they're just honest about it and
[58:32] they just
[58:35] give remember uh I'm going to read
[58:37] Revelation 2:23 can you pull it up here
[58:39] actually you're probably faster and I
[58:40] can find
[58:41] it good we're doing good Revelation 223
[58:45] see oh you beat me verse 23 there and I
[58:49] kill her children with death that's
[58:50] speaking of the Protestants and all the
[58:52] churches shall know that I am he which
[58:54] ser churches the Reigns of the hearts
[58:55] now look kill again this is this a this
[58:57] is very
[58:58] scriptural just like ananas and
[59:01] Safa if they lie to me if they have
[59:03] false religion I'll kill them with their
[59:05] false religion and everyone will know
[59:07] that I know the
[59:11] hearts and I will give unto every one of
[59:13] you according to your Works amen what a
[59:15] what a blessing that is for us God sees
[59:17] all of our works whatever we give God is
[59:19] going to pay you back amen every time
[59:22] you give to somebody God's keeping track
[59:24] he going to make sure He blesses you in
[59:26] return praise God hallelujah amen now
[59:29] let me read some quotes from Brother
[59:30] brandom here this is communion 1965 this
[59:34] is the last recorded message of brother
[59:36] Braham he only taught the communion I
[59:38] think Perry green preached the service
[59:39] and they only recorded I think it's like
[59:41] a 35 minute communion service afterwards
[59:44] in the last thing the last part brother
[59:46] Ram
[59:48] says he says me and the church the Lord
[59:51] has let me speak to in these last hours
[59:54] We Believe believe we're in the closing
[59:55] time we believe God has given us this
[59:57] message it's been ordained of God it's
[1:00:00] been proven by God Amen it's been showed
[1:00:03] of God now we must come to him with
[1:00:05] reverence and with love and with purity
[1:00:07] of heart and mind and soul this message
[1:00:10] has been proven by
[1:00:11] God hallelujah all these people that
[1:00:14] knew brother brandom all these
[1:00:15] testimonies of brother Ram his gift that
[1:00:17] he led by that was led by God all these
[1:00:20] Bible verses he's pointed to God has
[1:00:22] proven this message is right
[1:00:26] amen I still got a man who left the
[1:00:28] message recently he might listen to this
[1:00:29] but he was trying to text me today and
[1:00:31] talk to me about that and I was trying
[1:00:33] to say brother with all the kindness in
[1:00:36] my heart trying to say brother this
[1:00:39] message is the Bible Revelation I said
[1:00:40] it's not brother bram's Revelation it's
[1:00:42] God's revelation that he gave to brother
[1:00:44] Bram I said there's no contradictions in
[1:00:46] the Seven Seals in the water baptism in
[1:00:48] the Lord Jesus Christ the godhead uh you
[1:00:51] name it modesty there's no
[1:00:52] contradictions in those things that's
[1:00:54] why we know it's God's
[1:00:56] interpretation
[1:00:58] amen I said brother R plainly said I
[1:01:00] don't come that anybody will follow me
[1:01:03] said I come that men might have a true
[1:01:05] relationship with Jesus Christ and
[1:01:08] that's what we've got hallelujah amen
[1:01:10] we're not married to denomination you're
[1:01:12] not married to me you're not married to
[1:01:13] any preacher you're married to Christ
[1:01:15] Jesus Hallelujah because no matter which
[1:01:17] preachers come or go no matter what
[1:01:19] friends or family members go you still
[1:01:21] know Christ and he's your power he's
[1:01:23] your life he's your anchor he's your
[1:01:25] best friend he's your everything praise
[1:01:28] God hallelujah is it then we just sing
[1:01:32] he's your companion and he's your best
[1:01:34] friend who's there when you got nobody
[1:01:36] to talk to
[1:01:38] Jesus sometimes we wait till he's the
[1:01:40] last one that we have to talk to but
[1:01:41] he's still our best friend he's still
[1:01:44] our companion that's what this message
[1:01:46] has done it's given us a real
[1:01:48] relationship with Jesus
[1:01:50] Christ I shared that quote with
[1:01:53] him so so brother R says you know now
[1:01:56] this is not a prophecy but it's just
[1:01:57] interesting he says it you know the hour
[1:01:59] will soon arise right Among Us will be
[1:02:02] the holy spirit will speak out like it
[1:02:03] did in ananas and safire how many say
[1:02:06] God help
[1:02:07] us hallelujah
[1:02:09] amen God help us and I prayed that like
[1:02:12] I told you I prayed that for all these
[1:02:13] years Lord don't let sin come in that
[1:02:15] door if it does clean it out while we're
[1:02:18] here I believe God has honored that like
[1:02:20] I told you I we haven't had many
[1:02:22] preachers at all Hardley come in here
[1:02:24] that preach false Doctrine to
[1:02:26] us right now you know me I'm a teacher
[1:02:30] i' like to study the scripture if we
[1:02:32] would have got false Doctrine I would
[1:02:34] have told you about it right or you
[1:02:36] would have asked you would have asked me
[1:02:37] about yes you would have asked me
[1:02:39] about because brother R said if I he
[1:02:41] said if I ever take anything off the
[1:02:43] word you're Duty bound to come and talk
[1:02:44] to me about
[1:02:46] it praise
[1:02:48] God so God has been very gracious to us
[1:02:52] he said see that hour is arriving see
[1:02:54] now you just remember that see God is
[1:02:56] going to dwell among his people that's
[1:02:57] what he wants to do now now that's
[1:02:58] perfect because it's restoration God is
[1:03:01] restoring us back to the book of Acts
[1:03:04] church so may God make us the most
[1:03:06] honest people we can possibly
[1:03:09] be not to lie about anything not to
[1:03:12] stretch the truth just tell the truth
[1:03:13] like it is now my wife will tell you
[1:03:16] sometimes I make mistakes I sometimes
[1:03:18] exaggerate in my stories so may God
[1:03:21] forgive me for that I don't want to do
[1:03:23] that anymore I'm I need God's help in
[1:03:26] that
[1:03:29] Hallelujah mainly it's just because I
[1:03:31] don't remember the
[1:03:32] details and I'm really excited about the
[1:03:35] testimony I'm really glad what God did
[1:03:37] and it maybe it just seemed like that to
[1:03:38] me you know everybody was screaming or
[1:03:40] shouting maybe it just two people
[1:03:41] screaming or shouting I don't
[1:03:44] know but my my point is to show and to
[1:03:47] to testify that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:03:49] yesterday today and
[1:03:52] forever now it's hard to it's hard to
[1:03:54] exaggerate about that in appointed
[1:03:56] service
[1:03:57] right Hallelujah next quote in the
[1:03:59] church change book brother man says he's
[1:04:01] talking about returning re repenting and
[1:04:03] coming back to our first love he said
[1:04:05] God tells them to remember so let's
[1:04:07] remember the book of
[1:04:08] Acts evidently something had left their
[1:04:10] minds they had forgotten something he
[1:04:12] told them to turn back in their minds to
[1:04:14] their point of origin the origin was the
[1:04:16] first age of Pentecost they'd fallen
[1:04:19] from it they had forgotten in the the
[1:04:21] glory and The Wonder of it it was time
[1:04:23] to go back in their minds and then in
[1:04:25] reality back to when they could say for
[1:04:27] to me to live is Christ back to Purity
[1:04:31] when ananas and sa were dealt with
[1:04:33] brother calls that
[1:04:36] Purity two people dying in the church
[1:04:39] was Purity because God said I'm not
[1:04:41] going to let that leevan
[1:04:43] grow and these are Judas es scariot
[1:04:46] right I'm not going to let them continue
[1:04:49] I'm going to back up my church my church

[1:04:52] them clean and church that's what we got
[1:04:54] to want we just got to want our church

[1:05:08] gotta remember
[1:05:10] that brother Raam said see back to the
[1:05:12] purity of ananas and

[1:05:17] truth and not to lie to the Holy

[1:05:42] to worry about because you it's always

[1:05:46] GNA be the second time it's always going
[1:05:47] to be the same you don't have to worry
[1:05:49] about anything if you just tell it right
[1:05:50] the first time praise God
[1:05:57] man said what a reproach it is to drift
[1:05:59] from
[1:06:00] God to the acts that defile his name let
[1:06:04] those and he quotes that good scripture
[1:06:05] let those who name the name of Christ
[1:06:08] depart from sin and keep their vessels
[1:06:10] pure for
[1:06:12] God look at what you once were in your

[1:07:22] good like I did something right
[1:07:24] finally by God's grace somebody was
[1:07:27] blessed amen hallelujah but I thought my
[1:07:29] was like wow I looked at that video and
[1:07:31] then the one brother said uh he said
[1:07:33] brother Jess he said your videos are
[1:07:34] different he said every time you're
[1:07:35] behind that Pulpit he said the spirit of
[1:07:37] God is speaking through you I'm not
[1:07:39] perfect at all but that's what the
[1:07:41] brother noticed he's from Minnesota I
[1:07:43] said well praise so in my mind I'm like
[1:07:44] Lord help me to go back to that help me
[1:07:46] to help me to take this seriously praise

[1:07:55] like it was my last sermon before I
[1:07:56] would die like each sermon brother and
[1:07:58] said that's how a preacher should preach
[1:08:00] this is your last chance to point
[1:08:02] somebody to Christ Hallelujah preach
[1:08:03] with that type of sincerity that's the
[1:08:05] purity of the early church and we're a
[1:08:07] part of the book of Acts church
[1:08:13] amenu I want to read a quote uh if you
[1:08:15] got your Bible go
[1:08:17] to uh Luke 14:26 I'm going to call Lydia
[1:08:20] and Malachi to read because they're
[1:08:21] right up here they got their Bibles in
[1:08:23] hand
[1:08:24] so Lydia go to Luke 14 Mali go to
[1:08:26] Matthew 10:28 Lydia Luke
[1:08:29] 14:26 and Mali Matthew 10:28 I know it's
[1:08:33] hard to remember with all those numbers
[1:08:34] but let me read this brother I was
[1:08:35] talking about um Israel and the church
[1:08:38] this is from 1953 I'm almost done here I
[1:08:41] try to close at eight I got 15 minutes
[1:08:44] that's PL time but way I'm talking about
[1:08:47] uh Israel and kades barnea and we'll
[1:08:49] have L read that in just a moment says
[1:08:51] there you are Kadesh can you do it now
[1:08:52] remember what was Kadesh Barne
[1:08:54] God's people with Moses were trying to
[1:08:56] cross over into the promised land but
[1:08:59] the majority they sent 12 Spies two of
[1:09:01] them believed Joshua and Caleb believed
[1:09:03] they could take the promised land 10 of
[1:09:05] them
[1:09:07] doubted now what what was the reason you
[1:09:09] remember the reason why those two
[1:09:10] believed because they had a different
[1:09:12] Spirit than everybody else aren't you
[1:09:14] glad you got the holy spirit amen you
[1:09:16] didn't receive the spirit of the world
[1:09:18] you didn't receive the spirit of
[1:09:19] Hollywood you didn't receive the spirit
[1:09:21] of entertainment you receive the spirit
[1:09:23] of Jesus Jesus Christ Hallelujah the
[1:09:25] Holy Ghost amen that's why we believe
[1:09:28] all things are possible God's going to
[1:09:30] work God's going to move CU we got a
[1:09:31] different Spirit praise God Amen
[1:09:34] Hallelujah that's why I believe that's
[1:09:36] why you believe that's why we act
[1:09:39] different because we've got the Holy
[1:09:43] Spirit he said can he said there you are
[1:09:46] cadus can you do it yes God promised it
[1:09:48] to you I'm not to bring pre peace but a
[1:09:50] sword so he goes from kades barnea to
[1:09:54] Jesus what a
[1:09:56] connection crossing over the promised
[1:09:58] land to Jesus preaching on in his
[1:10:00] initial part of his the beginning of his
[1:10:02] ministry I come to separate father and
[1:10:05] mother husband wife sister brother and
[1:10:07] everything and he that won't forsake his
[1:10:09] own and follow me is not worthy to be
[1:10:11] called
[1:10:12] mine and he that puts his hand in the
[1:10:14] plow and even turns a look back is not
[1:10:16] worthy that's right brother I tell you
[1:10:20] it means a whole lot more than run up
[1:10:22] and shaking hands with a preacher and a
[1:10:24] few drops of water sprinkled on you see
[1:10:26] we don't got that we don't got that to
[1:10:27] worry about that's right brother it runs
[1:10:29] a whole lot more than walking up to the
[1:10:31] Altar and taking communion walking back
[1:10:34] and sit down your seat it means there
[1:10:36] here here's what the gospel means
[1:10:37] brother Ram says it means a selling

[1:12:45] God keeps his word we're more than
[1:12:47] conquerors in Christ
[1:12:50] Jesus Hallelujah numbers four I'm sor
[1:12:53] sorry Luke 14 Lydia 1426 and
[1:13:08] 27 all right leave that up there so
[1:13:12] Jesus of course using hyperbole he's not
[1:13:14] hyperbole he's not saying you need to
[1:13:15] hate your mom and dad he's saying
[1:13:17] anything that keeps you from following
[1:13:19] me you've got to reject it you got to
[1:13:22] walk away from it as if you hate it he
[1:13:24] said because you cannot be a disciple
[1:13:27] disciple means learner you can't learn
[1:13:28] the message unless you take up your
[1:13:30] cross daily and follow
[1:13:32] me right I've said it many times a cross
[1:13:34] is a slow death I was showing the I was
[1:13:36] showing the kids at the middle school I
[1:13:37] said they would nail their you remember
[1:13:39] that they nail their feet together and
[1:13:41] they have to lift they have to push up
[1:13:42] to get a breath and then they got so
[1:13:44] tired they have to come back down and
[1:13:46] then their arms will be pulling out like
[1:13:48] the arms will be pulling out of joint
[1:13:49] and they run out of breath they got to
[1:13:50] do it again and then get a breath and
[1:13:53] then come back down and it's Suffocation
[1:13:56] it's slow Suffocation but Jesus said
[1:13:57] that's what you and I do every day we
[1:13:59] slowly suffocate the the desires of the
[1:14:02] flesh we've got to fight against we got
[1:14:04] to crucify our desires Jesus said that's
[1:14:07] the way you become my disciple he said
[1:14:09] you got to hate family mother anything
[1:14:11] anything that will draw you away from
[1:14:12] the word of God you've got to separate
[1:14:14] yourself from that and you must die to
[1:14:16] yourself every day then you can be a
[1:14:18] Christian praise God sin killing
[1:14:21] religion amen thou stick to your ribs
[1:14:23] brother brother sister
[1:14:26] Hallelujah have some meat on your ribs
[1:14:29] now I could use some of that praise
[1:14:31] God Matthew 10
[1:14:34] Malachi we get the same idea Matthew 10
[1:14:37] now it was 28 but Malachi it's a long
[1:14:39] text I don't have enough time I got down
[1:14:41] to about eight minutes
[1:14:44] here these are the scriptures g g or
[1:14:47] brother R uses for sky blue sin killing
[1:14:51] religion in other words clean
[1:14:55] living
[1:14:57] now that's a great scripture man uh I
[1:15:00] might as well read it I mentioned The
[1:15:01] Sparrows Mali read
[1:15:03] 2829 and well just read 28 to 31 you're
[1:15:06] a fast
[1:15:22] reader
[1:15:26] amen that's a great scripture think
[1:15:28] about you know Israel and Hamas let's
[1:15:30] say we are in that situation with the
[1:15:31] war and everything we you know the B
[1:15:33] Jesus tells us Don't Fear the person who
[1:15:35] can take your life fear the person who
[1:15:37] can cast your soul down that's real
[1:15:40] that's real a spiritual
[1:15:42] maturity right when you're more fearful
[1:15:44] of God than a person who wants to kill
[1:15:46] you right and then Jesus says not even a
[1:15:50] bird falls down except the father knows
[1:15:53] about it and he says aren't you more
[1:15:55] valuable than a sparrow doesn't God know
[1:15:58] you're going up and you're coming down
[1:16:00] doesn't God know all the hairs on he
[1:16:02] knows the very hairs on her head praise
[1:16:04] God one time I count I think I lose like
[1:16:06] eight or nine every night in the shower
[1:16:08] got to pull them up there pick them up
[1:16:09] and throw them away nine or 10 every day
[1:16:11] God knew every one of those amen he
[1:16:14] counts our hairs he knows everything
[1:16:16] praise God he's watching over us praise
[1:16:20] God and then he says verse 32 who
[1:16:23] whoever therefore shall confess me
[1:16:24] before men see tell people about Jesus
[1:16:26] oh yeah the doctor asked me yesterday I
[1:16:28] was at the doctor or the secretary she
[1:16:30] saids what's your religion I said
[1:16:31] Christian she said oh good I said
[1:16:34] exactly right I'm a Christian praise God
[1:16:36] I said God bless you have a great
[1:16:39] day see you can't be ashamed of
[1:16:41] it he says uh I will confess also before
[1:16:46] my Father which is in heaven verse 33
[1:16:47] but whosoever shall deny me before men
[1:16:49] him will I also deny before my Father
[1:16:51] which is in heaven think not that I'm
[1:16:53] come to send peace on the Earth right we
[1:16:55] all pray for God give me peace give me
[1:16:56] peace but Jesus says Christianity
[1:16:58] actually creates uh it creates war
[1:17:01] against itself in other words Satan gets
[1:17:03] upset so Satan starts fighting the
[1:17:05] truth but God has to allow
[1:17:08] it right whatever God we went through
[1:17:11] that last Wednesday night right whatever
[1:17:12] happens God allowed it God allowed the
[1:17:15] disciples to get arrested right put
[1:17:17] hands on them remember I put hands on
[1:17:18] Mal guy last week they put hands on them
[1:17:20] God allowed it so we got to trust God in
[1:17:23] the midst of the trial Don't Fear the
[1:17:24] ones who put their hands on you fear the
[1:17:26] one who can toss your soul into hell
[1:17:29] should say toss but cast your soul now
[1:17:31] whatever the word is it's not
[1:17:35] toss
[1:17:36] verse 35 for I am come to set a man at
[1:17:39] variance against his father and against
[1:17:42] the daughter against her mother and the
[1:17:43] daughter-in-law against her
[1:17:44] mother-in-law so these scriptures really
[1:17:46] encourage us when the rest of our family
[1:17:48] doesn't believe because Jesus said
[1:17:50] that's what I've come to do I've come to
[1:17:52] make you believer I've come to make you
[1:17:54] a city on a hill in your family I've
[1:17:56] come to make you the salt of the earth
[1:17:58] in your family
[1:18:00] Hallelujah and a man's foe shall be they
[1:18:03] of his own
[1:18:06] household
[1:18:09] Hallelujah verse 37 he that loveth
[1:18:11] father mother more than me is not worthy
[1:18:13] of
[1:18:15] me he that love a son or daughter more
[1:18:18] than me is not worthy me I think a
[1:18:20] brother amen he loved Jesus Christ more
[1:18:22] than his
[1:18:23] family willing to be kicked out with
[1:18:26] nowhere to go
[1:18:28] Hallelujah he loved Christ Lord love
[1:18:31] father and
[1:18:32] mother praise God
[1:18:34] to and that's a man Jesus said I'll
[1:18:37] confess you before the father because
[1:18:40] you confessed me before
[1:18:43] men verse 38 he that taketh not his
[1:18:46] cross and boweth after me is not worthy
[1:18:48] of me he that findeth his life shall
[1:18:52] lose it but he that loses his life his
[1:18:54] life for my sake shall find it praise
[1:18:57] God Amen that's the only way to find
[1:18:59] your life is to lose your life that's
[1:19:02] the only way you're going know what God
[1:19:03] wants you to do when you get rid of
[1:19:05] everything so you have nothing to do
[1:19:07] except serve God
[1:19:10] hallelujah I love verse 40 he that
[1:19:12] receives you brother Jesse receives me
[1:19:15] and he that receives me receiveth him
[1:19:17] that sent me praise God Amen oh thank
[1:19:20] God
[1:19:21] Amen Jesus said there this chain if you
[1:19:24] receive the preacher then you receive
[1:19:25] the one that sent the preacher and then
[1:19:27] you receive the one that sent Jesus that
[1:19:29] was the father Hallelujah now the Bible
[1:19:32] says if you have the right Doctrine you
[1:19:33] have both son and the father that's
[1:19:38] right verse 41 he that receives a
[1:19:40] prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[1:19:41] receive a prophet's reward and he that
[1:19:44] receiveth a righteous man in the name of
[1:19:45] a righteous man shall receive a
[1:19:47] righteous man's reward I like to preach
[1:19:48] that someday I don't have the thoughts
[1:19:50] now but I like what's the difference
[1:19:51] between a prophet's reward and and a
[1:19:53] righteous man's reward maybe it's
[1:19:55] Abraham and lot I don't know that sounds
[1:19:56] like it'd be pretty good right
[1:19:58] there because the Bible said AB lot was
[1:20:01] a righteous
[1:20:02] Soul right lot was a righteous soul but
[1:20:05] Abraham was the
[1:20:07] prophet and whever shall give a drink
[1:20:09] unto one of these little ones a cup of
[1:20:12] cold water only in the name of a
[1:20:13] disciple verily I say unto you he shall
[1:20:16] nowise lose his reward God remember
[1:20:19] brother man says we should labor for
[1:20:21] Eternal Rewards
[1:20:23] right in this case giving water to
[1:20:25] people Christians right helping out
[1:20:27] Believers anything we can do to help out
[1:20:30] somebody uh with their life make their
[1:20:32] life a little easier Jesus says when
[1:20:34] you've done it to them you've done it to
[1:20:35] me and I'm going to reward you how many
[1:20:39] know he's faithful praise God I'm trying
[1:20:41] to close
[1:20:44] here
[1:20:49] hallelujah acts 512 let me go back there
[1:20:58] now Church look at the Purity and look
[1:21:00] at what the Purity
[1:21:02] produced we read 1 through 11 already
[1:21:04] tonight we'll close with this it's about
[1:21:06] 8 o'clock so that's really good
[1:21:10] time and by verse 12 and by the hands of
[1:21:13] the apostles were many signs and wonders
[1:21:15] wrough among the people and they were
[1:21:17] all with one Accord in Solomon's porch
[1:21:19] and of the rest dur no man join himself
[1:21:21] to them but the people magnified
[1:21:25] them so remember this is right after the
[1:21:27] death of these two nobody just joined
[1:21:30] the church after that there was this
[1:21:32] holy awe about
[1:21:37] them people magnified them and the
[1:21:39] Believers were the more added to the
[1:21:40] Lord multitudes both men and women in so
[1:21:44] much that they brought forth the sick
[1:21:45] into the streets and laid them on beds
[1:21:47] and couches that at the least the shadow
[1:21:50] of Peter passing by might over
[1:21:52] overshadow some of them the same man who
[1:21:54] denied Christ three times church if this
[1:21:56] doesn't bless your heart to know that
[1:21:58] God redeems his children something we we
[1:22:00] need to shake ourselves a little bit
[1:22:02] here tonight amen hallelujah he lied but
[1:22:05] God forgive him he was the uh he was the
[1:22:07] preacher on the day of Pentecost
[1:22:09] Hallelujah he opened the door of Faith
[1:22:10] to the Jews he opened the door of Faith
[1:22:12] to the Gentiles he opened the door of
[1:22:14] Faith to the Samaritans praise God
[1:22:16] hallelujah God uses him to speak life or
[1:22:19] death over them and now the man just
[1:22:21] walks in the street and his shadow
[1:22:23] Hallelujah is a manifestation God uses
[1:22:26] the shadow to miraculously heal people
[1:22:29] just the shadow of the man Hallelujah
[1:22:32] and then later on what does he do he
[1:22:33] separates from the Gentiles so he's a
[1:22:36] man that's so easily beset but what he
[1:22:38] knew how to do he knew how to lay down
[1:22:40] the sin that so easily besets him praise
[1:22:43] God Amen and run the race and start
[1:22:45] running again for God's glory he's a man
[1:22:48] who KN who knew he knew how to have
[1:22:50] Victory he knew how to go through trials
[1:22:52] but he knew how to start back again
[1:22:54] praise he could get back to his first
[1:22:55] love there it is amen hallelujah he was
[1:22:58] able to remember what it was like and
[1:22:59] repent and get back to serving God
[1:23:04] hallelujah there came also multitude out
[1:23:06] the cities round about unto Jerusalem
[1:23:08] bringing sick folks and them which were
[1:23:10] vexed with unclean spirits and they were
[1:23:13] healed everyone let's stand to our feet
[1:23:15] musicians can come here so this is what
[1:23:18] an honest Church produces praise God
[1:23:22] this is what a pure Church
[1:23:28] produces I called this in my notes I
[1:23:30] called this is a Street
[1:23:32] Ministry this was such a powerful honest
[1:23:34] Church they could go out into the
[1:23:36] streets and people are getting healed
[1:23:37] out in the streets remember Mike mosy I
[1:23:39] don't know if you heard his testimonies
[1:23:41] he said numerous times he he's prayed
[1:23:42] for people in Menards Lowe's Home Depot
[1:23:46] all those places and people have got
[1:23:48] their healing right there in the low's
[1:23:52] right right there right in public he
[1:23:54] said the people will cry and they'll
[1:23:55] feel the healing and yet God allows him
[1:23:58] to stay there in the wheelchair a god
[1:24:01] who's rich in Mercy and he is but God is
[1:24:05] writing a
[1:24:06] story God has a testimony for each and
[1:24:09] every
[1:24:11] person see it takes it out into public
[1:24:13] so let's be mindful here let's be
[1:24:15] mindful tonight let's be mindful
[1:24:16] tomorrow if we run into people that need
[1:24:17] prayer let's be mindful our God is with

[1:31:26] someone who needs something we can say a
[1:31:28] word of prayer for them Lord
[1:31:47] God in Jesus Christ's name amen I forgot
[1:31:51] I just ended the prayer there because I
[1:31:53] forgot I have a coworker a first grade
[1:31:55] teacher
[1:31:57] who was in remission of cancer but now
[1:32:00] they think it's back she's not at work
[1:32:03] and she's lost feeling in her entire
[1:32:05] left
[1:32:06] arm and so we had prayer at our school
[1:32:09] yesterday in the morning just five
[1:32:10] minutes of prayer I'd like your prayers
[1:32:12] too her name's
[1:32:15] Amanda she's Pro yeah she's probably
[1:32:18] been teaching maybe 10 years more more
[1:32:20] than me would you pray for
[1:32:23] her you know the first scripture I asked
[1:32:25] the teachers you know could you bring a
[1:32:26] verse and the first one they
[1:32:29] read was if you speak to this mountain
[1:32:32] and don't doubt the mountain will move I
[1:32:36] just thought that was faith
[1:32:38] building let's pray her name is Amanda
[1:32:41] she has four children no three and
[1:32:44] they're all three in
[1:32:47] college it would just mean a lot to me
[1:32:49] if you just pray father God
[1:32:54] Lord be with Amanda Lord she has Faith
[1:32:56] In
[1:32:58] You Lord she can't feel her arm she
[1:33:01] can't raise her
[1:33:03] arm she's probably
[1:33:06] 50 Lord Jesus I ask you'd heal her Lord
[1:33:09] just like we've asked for Robbie
[1:33:12] Davis Lord we want to be led by the Holy
[1:33:15] Spirit many times I don't know whether
[1:33:18] to speak to the mountain Lord I don't
[1:33:19] know but I just ask in Jesus Christ's
[1:33:22] name may you bring healing to my
[1:33:25] friend and may those teachers of
[1:33:27] Arrowhead see a miracle Lord God I want
[1:33:29] to see it to not that they'll see him
[1:33:32] not that they'll give me any credit cuz
[1:33:33] I'm nothing I can't heal anybody but I
[1:33:36] believe Lord God I know Hallelujah all
[1:33:39] things are possible Lord to them to
[1:33:41] believe and it would just be a testimony
[1:33:43] Lord God that maybe I'm the one that
[1:33:45] called the prayer meeting they would
[1:33:47] just see
[1:33:48] that your word is true my wife dresses
[1:33:51] is the right way when they see my
[1:33:52] daughters come they would know that this
[1:33:54] is the truth dear God that you would be
[1:33:57] glorified God because I know I'm nothing
[1:33:59] I'm a failure to begin with as brother
[1:34:01] said we're all failures but I ask for
[1:34:03] healing in the name of Jesus Christ Lord
[1:34:07] God he said you have not because you
[1:34:09] asked not so I ask in Jesus holy name
[1:34:12] please heal Amanda Lord God may it be
[1:34:14] another great Victory Lord Jesus for thy
[1:34:17] Glory but Lord we know your will will be
[1:34:19] done father God
[1:34:25] and I ask the same for Robbie remember
[1:34:26] that man with two children please don't
[1:34:28] let him pass onto the grave Lord God now
[1:34:32] of course we would accept it as your
[1:34:33] will if he did but Lord in our own
[1:34:35] compassion we want to see him made
[1:34:39] well we ask for healing for Robbie as
[1:34:42] well for Amanda and
[1:34:44] Robbie Lord because we know one day it
[1:34:46] might be our mom our dad it might be
[1:34:49] us it might be me
[1:34:52] so Lord we want to pray for others Lord
[1:34:54] God while we have the
[1:34:58] strength so we ask in the Holy Name of
[1:35:00] Jesus we ask for healing guide us Lord
[1:35:03] to speak your word guide us to believe
[1:35:06] your
[1:35:07] word guide us to be lights help us to
[1:35:10] walk in the spirit Lord
[1:35:11] God that even our hands laid on somebody
[1:35:14] could bring a healing Lord they feel the
[1:35:16] anointing of the Holy Ghost Grant it
