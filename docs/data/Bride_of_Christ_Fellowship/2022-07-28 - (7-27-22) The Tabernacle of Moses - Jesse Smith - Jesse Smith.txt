week i'd like to teach on the tabernacle because also you are new to this i looked it up it's been since 2007 since i preached it i preached in 2009 in iowa it's been quite a number of years ago so i thought be good to refresh that god's grace exodus chapter 25. trust me a blessing to you this is just a tremendous study so many beautiful types shadows imagine williams heard a number of sermons on this topic over the years i imagine that's probably how just one verse we'll have you be seated after we read and pray here exodus 25 verse 8 exodus 25 verse i got some pictures i'll get to eventually you know where it's really it's good visual learning experience it gives you a nice structure to think about the old testament and then of course the new testament three works of grace and also your three parts to your being it's just a beautiful lesson you know brother branham got some of these thoughts from clarence larkin as i've seen in this book a lot of good thoughts from larkin on this with the three parts to man's being so i know he'd be blessed tonight praise god and just trust the lord here to speak his word as we saw you know sunday night i thought it would be a really easy sermon to preach but i couldn't get through it so people must have been pulling somehow so keep pulling by god's grace and you'll have whatever you desire praise god exodus 25 verse a very simple scripture let's read this on three if we can ready one two three and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell amen as blessings word may be seated i do have some slides to show here so we will preach here we'll try to go an hour now i've been going an hour and a half so we'll just be open to whatever time we can get here so i think cam showed this picture about austin when he was here if i'm not mistaken remember this picture brother okay so this was the tabernacle of moses remember two million people came out of uh egypt maybe two and a half million i heard some historians say today so these are all tents of you know of course all the all the israelites here and then this is the tabernacle so this was when it was all finished so at the end of exodus when the holy ghost came down uh and filled the place so this would have been exodus chapter 40. but god started teaching them about this in exodus chapter 25. so i like to look at the tabernacle of moses here tonight and i said it's been many many years well since i've appreciated this so but as i said a few weeks ago we preached on the waters of separation recently so over the last five years or so so it was a little fresh on my heart i want to look at the purpose and the the pattern of the tabernacle here i have lots of scriptures i got a lot of time today to study so i was able to get them a lot on here so hopefully i won't have to want to turn too much so you can maybe have your bible handy there but our text says let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them so god requests a place with his people where he can dwell with them praise god amen now of course we know god is omnipresent god god by foreknowledge is here praise god amen and if we're worshiping god then we know god's presence also comes down so he's here in another way other than by omniscience he would be here anointing our bodies right so we can raise our hands when we're tired we worked all wednesday right we might be tired but the holy ghost will lord our bodies to raise our hands praise god and give god glory and clap and shout amen and maybe stomp a few times if we sing praise god in the sanctuary amen you might want to happen get out the tambourine you know but god's spirit comes upon our flesh and then it comes upon uh our minds and our soul as well by the grace of god but here in the old testament god wants to dwell among them so they can physically seek god god was always one who was revealing himself we know that's the name of what jehovah and elohim means the self-existent one who's always revealing himself that's right he's he's so great he's so he's so eternal he's so unlimited that we'll never be able to fully understand unless we have eternal life amen in this life we'll never be able to even scratch the surface of his greatness that's why he's constantly revealing himself through the prophets through the church ages and here at the end of the church ages amen he's revealed himself right as the son of man son of god son of david he's reviewing himself as god in christ supreme deity in jesus christ amen that's how he's revealed himself today hallelujah thank god amen and we know him as jesus christ hallelujah now verse 9 says according to all that i show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall you make it so god said i'm going to dwell among you you're going to build me a house a temporary tent a tabernacle or sanctuary drum and i'm going to tell you how to build it and i'm going to tell you all the instruments you need praise god that's right in other words if you want me to dwell with you and i want to drug you you got to come according to my pattern amen amen that's how it is the new testament as well praise god if you come according to god's pattern god's going to bless you on a wednesday night praise god just like a sunday night just like a sunday morning amen if you come according to god's pattern god is going to answer your requests amen as he constantly does praise god now see once it's well and then it was going to be set up so this was going to be set up like it was in heaven praise god moses's tabernacle was going to be a uh imitation of the heavenly tabernacle god bless you brother good to see you tonight sir and then god said there i will meet with you and i will commune with you above the mercy seat so before the people of god you know they would only see god in his supernatural like maybe on mount sinai and they were afraid and then they begged god they said god we don't want to see the thunder lightning would just speak through the prophet right but then god was so merciful god said i want to dwell among you praise god amen i want more than just the prophet to see me i want all my people to see me praise god that's how she'll be tonight amen more than just a preacher more than just a song leader or more than just a piano player or something or deacon or trustee everybody should want to see god amen amen everybody should want a special communion with god hallelujah amen that's what it is church probably tells us he says pray every day read your bible every day he said before you make any decision ask god about the decision and be neutral and he said in some way or another god will talk to you praise god amen we don't have to hear a voice all the time we don't have to have a dream every time or we don't have to have some type of a feeling or a tickle down our spine or goosebumps which we appreciate that praise god but it doesn't have to be that god speaks to his children in many ways he wants to meet with us he wants to commune with us he wants us to enjoy his presence and talk with him and god wants to have fellowship with you praise god amen glory amen but he said i'll meet with you above the mercy seat from between the two cherubs which are upon the ark of the testimony of all the things which i will give thee in commandment under the children of israel so god wanted to meet and then speak to israel praise god that's right now hebrews 8 lays it out for us kind of plainly and he says who serve unto the example and shadows of heavenly things as moses was admonished to god when he was about to make the tabernacle foresee saith he god said that thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mount so god went up and he climbed up the mountain all by him well with some of the elders but then he went a little bit further beyond and moses was in the prince of god for 40 days that's right and while he was up there he got the tables of stone but he also got the vision of how to build the tabernacle amen amen so god in a secret meeting place up up on top of a mountain praise god god met with this prophet up on top of a mountain hallelujah that's right sounds like when he met peter james and john about transfiguration praise god sounds like what he met brother branham on the mountain amen god meets with his believers on top of mountains sometimes and he gave him the pattern of the heavenly tabernacle praise god and he said you make something like this sort of like this much less grandeur right but you make this upon the earth and moses said i will praise god now remember church there is many of these instruments in heaven revelation 8 3 says an angel come and takes a golden censer which is like a container that holds incense right and we'll have a picture of it later and they put incense into that and he would offer with the prayers of saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne so heaven has an altar praise god heaven has an altar of incense heaven has a mercy seat amen heaven has many instruments praise god and many of these pieces of furniture and moses saw what it was like and god said you make this like the pattern i'm going to show you be obedient and if you do that i'll come in fellowship with you amen glory i'm not going to try to preach my voice out like i did sunday night i gotta be careful now in exodus 19 he said you've seen what i've done to the egyptians and i bear you on ego wings and brought you into myself isn't that how god brought you out of the world don't you feel like god just picked you up out of your desperate condition it's like papa eagles just come flying along i'm going to rescue them and that's what remember austin gave his testimony he just prayed that that bitter prayer right that sincere prayer church that's how it was for you when you were sincere when you really cried out to god that's when papa eagle come around and brought you out of the world and brought you to himself amen that's what he said i bore you on eagle's wings now if you there's another if see the condition it's always conditional if you obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine now you know i'm sorry you new testament readers know the beauty of this scripture right because peter tells us you are peculiar people now that's right so let's not just leave it all to israel thank god that they were procured people they are still god's people but you are now god's people right now your eyes are not blinded your eyes are wide open you're tuned another day you're not blinded by the night you are god's people when you believe and keep his word if you love me keep my commands amen amen glory amen you'll be above all the people of the earth for the earth is mine amen praise god church spiritually that's how we are we are above all the sinners of the world because we're up in the mind of christ we're up in heavenly places the bible plainly says it yes the bible plainly says you're already accepted in the beloved amen i tell you paul's departure say you're going to be paul said you are you're already accepted in the presence of jesus christ amen hallelujah amen thank god thank god it here's my prayers amen amen glory amen and he told israel you will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation and these are the words that thou shalt speak under the church of israel so god himself brings this people to himself so when god brought when god sent moses it was really eagle wings bringing them out moses and aaron the bible said were the eagles bringing them out praise god you brought them out by a mighty hand amen swiftly praise god and now they become separated from egypt and now they are a kingdom of intercessors that's right amen see church when we give up on our prayer life or we're not painful like we ought to we're we're not fulfilling the role that we should because that's what you are you're a priest that's right you've got to pray for one another right and the more we pray the more blessings we get praise god that's right that song is true when the prayers goes up the blessings come down that song is true true because jesus says you have not because you asked that james said it to you praise god that's right see we are a kingdom of prayer warriors amen amen hallelujah because the world is not praying they're only asking god for blessings right they're not really interceding they're not being priests but we're the ones who are supposed to intercede and pray for us you can pray until the walls come down amen so keep praying praise god don't give up keep uh interceding before the throne of god god will do the right thing in the right time we must only be patient and patience possess your soul glory yes amen now church this was a progression of god's dwelling place so we had moses in the wilderness this was a temporary sanctuary right in the wilderness it was not in the promised land but david through joshua david eventually he conquers mount zion as he lifted that that's a beautiful type there right there type of rapture amen beautiful amen uh and then david uh puts a a temporary tap attempt on mount zion in the promised land so first he had a one out in the wilderness that wasn't the right location now he's got the right location but it's still temporary it's not made of stone right it's more temporary but then solomon comes praise god and solomon builds a permanent structure a structure of stones gathered from all around the world praise god oh my hallelujah a dwelling place for god almighty praise god and he makes it a permanent place which is a type of the millennium praise god amen now for those historians out there uh psalmist temple lasted uh a while i don't remember the exactly i think it was around five around 500 bc when the the psalmist temple was tore down in 445 bc the issue was declared to rebuild the house of god and that's when it's removable uh and ezra them rebuilt the tabernacle uh just a small one it was a it was a it was a smaller house praise god it wasn't a big house but it was a smaller house but still the bible said when the capstone was coming down there were shoutings crying grace grace unto it amen and the bible said don't despise the day of small things amen amen amen and then that one got tore down and then king herod built the one that jesus was worshiping him that's right and then that got torn out in 1870 and there's not been another one since but church i'm telling you pretty soon there's going to be another one here another jewish temple according to thus saith revelation chapter 11 amen hallelujah israel will again rebuild the temple we don't know if it's before the rapture or after the rapture but church can you imagine if we see that temple started being built before the rapture we will be in revival mode amen that'll be the latter time even if we don't see it we'll be in a latter rain time amen because it's not safe to worry amen the former latter reign must come in the first book as it did at the beginning in other words this bride must return to being the price he was at pentecost amen glory praise god hallelujah not believing it praise god amen because i see jesus working in my life praise god like the book of acts amen hallelujah thank god oh it's a great blessing and then that was of course a type of the millennium but then there's coming the greater one the last one amen as far as we know we might go on other worlds brother william and we might do some other things on other who knows there's trillions and trillions of galaxies out there who knows what we're doing the entire uh future home you know who knows but i like larkin's drawing here it's so beautiful i love this is one of my favorite drawings of all time i think but here god jesus sets up the permanent home praise god this is this is what this is what he wanted all along but throughout the old testament he was teaching us a lesson like a school teacher amen i like school teachers amen i don't know about you and he was teaching us through moses and then david and then solomon and then jerubal and then through herod right and then through the book of acts church he's teaching us i want to dwell with my people glory i'm getting closer and closer and closer to my people so much so one day i'll be so close the bible says they'll never leave my side amen hallelujah and i'll wipe away every tear from their eye praise god amen amen amen so just look on hallelujah akron avenue that's where i live in there how hallelujah or praise the lord avenue something like that now here's what it's going to look like from heaven praise god all those angels get to see this come down i don't know where it will be when this comes out but the final permanent dwelling place our home is going to come down heaven unites with earth amen praise god lord the rapture is like heaven and earth will kiss and be united like husband and wife amen hallelujah glory and that's church where we get to live hallelujah hallelujah bob said there'll be no more seats i'm not sure about that picture but maybe those are just big legs i don't know but we'll find out one day no doubt that's a minor let's make sure we get there first praise god that's right loretta says the greatest invitation you can ever have in your life is to go to the marriage supper of the lamb praise god and then if you go there surely you'll live there with christ amen you got we have the greatest invitation there ever was to go to jesus's wedding and be married to him amen now church i told you this there's at least five applications to the tabernacle of moses israel's approach to meet with god during the old testament it represents jesus body like brother can preach that was a beautiful thought uh i'm gonna have a few signs on that the third is it represents jesus's work as the heavenly high priest fourth that represents new testament believers being god's tabernacle so you're the tabernacle and then it represents how you and i approach to meet god right now amen and that's where the water separation was so powerful for me and all the churches that god sent me to to preach that message now let's look at the first one israel's approach to meet with god i already showed you god wanted them to be a kingdom of priests right and there are so many details i'm not going to get into most of the details but but church just say you know in when this tabernacle was set up daily sacrifices allowed them to commune with god so let's read that you've got your bible just go to exodus 29 this one's important so i want to read it and you can clearly see the tidy exodus 29 38 now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar two lambs of the first year day by day continually so two lambs had to die every single day if these people wanted to fellowship with god the one lamb thou shall offer in the morning and the other landmass should operate evening and one with i'm sorry and with the one lamb attention flower mingle with the fourth part of a hint of beaten oil and a fourth part of a hint of wine for drink offering so look you got you got flour oil wine right and you have all the types of the holy spirit in there right flower's the word you know oils the baptism holy ghost and of course wine is a stimulation of revelation right lord this was every day praise god oh i love it amen every day a lamb died in the morning lambda lamb night at night and you all said uh oil wine and flower all throughout the day praise that every day praise god now church can't you see how you need to seek god every morning sure can't you see you gotta you gotta talk to god before you go to bed sure this was old testament what about the new praise god these are the old testament priests that didn't have as good as promises as we have see why it's so important you have morning prayer time and evening prayer time amen he said god stir my spirit god make me strong amen stimulate me somehow today praise god amen let the preacher preach a good message to stimulate me praise god and let me paul in the word of god to help him hallelujah let's tell one another praise god verse 41 and the other lamb shall offer evening and thou shalt do according to the meat offering of the morning in the orbit of drink off in there for a sweet savor an offering made by fire unto the lord this should be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle the congregation before the lord where i will meet you to speak unto thee now church you know burnt offering if you don't just listen burnt offering the entire animal was sacrificed to god man didn't get nothing right right with some of the other animal sacrifices like the thank offering of different ones uh the sin offering god would get apart and man will get a part yeah but not with the burnt offering right you can take it back to noah you can take it back to abraham when they really wanted to show devotion to god it was a burnt offering don't worry and that represents god i am sacrificing all of me to you praise god hallelujah i'm giving you everything i have lord i'm laying over to all of myself i'm giving you all my thoughts all my time all my praise amen amen i'm surrendering and i'm gonna lose i'm gonna sacrifice so that i can worship you amen hallelujah what a joy to worship god tonight praise god what am i saying you can give a burnt offering tonight yes that's right give yourself holy to this service ain't nothing right like the preacher's not preachers have to do it like we'll sweat you know we'll give ourselves my voice will be sore the next three days like it was sunday night i'm trying to give a bird offering to you all right take it to god rather for your benefit praise god i've got to give my offering but so to you everyone's got to give their offering praise god and no notice this was every day the priests had to make sacrifices morning evening in order for god to meet with you church if we want god to be with us we got to make time to meet with him praise god amen amen oh glory amen verse 43 and there i'll meet with the children of israel and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory so see when we want to see god's glory when we want to see people blessed or we want to weep or we want to have joy or we want to have the blessings of god the fruits of the spirit we've got to make the sacrifices amen and when we make the sacrifices god will bless our sacrifice we'll feel his presence we'll enjoy his glory we'll be happy to be a christian thank you jesus amen and i was sanctifying the tabernacle of the congregation in the altar i was thanked by also both aaron and the sons to minister to me in the priest's office and i will dwell among the children of israel and will be their god and they should know that i am the lord their god that brought them forth out of the land of egypt that i may dwell among them i am the lord your god so in church when we make dedicated sacrifices to god every single day will know god sure man praise god amen that's what god said in second corinthians chapter six and paul paul said separate yourself don't mix yourself uh unequally yoke with unbelievers come out from among them and i'll receive you saith the lord amen see god was separation that was a total sacrifice praise god like i just you know i get reminded of it every day almost every day i get an email or text some video or some sermon i preached was a blessing to somebody so today i got one from a man who uh married interracial marriage and he said i just want to encourage you for the courage you had to preach that with that video out he said that blessed me i was set free by that amen amen see every day you get the glory of god the glory of god comes back amen hallelujah you're faithful to god you love god you're devoted to god then the blessings will come back to you cast your bread on the waters make the sacrifice in the morning make the sacrifice in the evening and the glory of god will be with you amen amen hallelujah isn't that what life's about church helping others isn't that what it's about it's not about helping ourselves eternal life is about living for others what can we do today that will help somebody tomorrow that's what god's interested in that kind of living sacrifice a burnt offering we can give ourselves holy unto the lord now church you and i you know i know what we can give up and give a burnt offering unto god amen right and some of us get online and we do it well i like to shop i like the price and i like to get the right price sometimes we spend a little too much time price shopping praise god and we could be a little more devoted give a little bit more of that time to go to jesus or we get caught up on a video that probably wasn't it wasn't the best video for us praise god that's true or hit the snooze when we didn't need to now if you need to get rest get your rest don't hurt your body because that it's going to hurt it's going to hurt a third of you right that's when you're going to get like me you're getting headaches for weeks when you don't sleep enough but i got i don't have a headache for a long time now because it's summer break but you got to take care of yourself in other words but we all know there's areas right there's errors at times if we can make this total sacrifice unto god that we know we'd have a closer walk with god we see his glory more god amen amen church we see it every now and then in the service right god come down and answer a prayer what was that everybody gave a burnt offering sometimes even calling you to pray right you're not expecting it you might not even want to come up but if i call you up i appreciate you coming up praise god because i know there's power and prayer amen amen i know my prayers can't do everything i'm not i'm nothing right you know with the body move praise god the holy ghost is just as much here as it is out there praise god amen hallelujah amen it's a total sacrifice it's a burnt offering unto god amen morning evening and there's if you do that church you've got some oil in there got some wine in there thank god i'm bored again i'm gonna say that one tonight more morning get some oil in there praise god get some stimulation oh i haven't heard that's a beautiful thought i never heard that revelation before hallelujah and the bread of god's word amen amen daily bread give us this day our daily bread now before we start look at these individual furniture pieces remember this is what i preached years ago uh 2017-18 no one whether jew or gentile could enter the tabernacle you couldn't even come in the gate until your sprinkle with the waters of separation whether you're brand new proselyte a gentile or a seasoned jew you are not getting in there if you are unclean praise god that's what numbers 19 is all about now in order to get in a red heifer had to die had to be totally red there could be one white hair on it amen right they only come around every every so many generations i read one place where the jews kept the water separation for 300 years can you imagine keeping a bowl of water without spilling it for 300 years now that's dedication right there we can have a cup in our house on the table spill i mean it'll spill within five minutes every cup yeah but the water's the separation 300 years they kept they would burn it they'd take the ashes apply water to it keep it in a container and if you got if you were by a dead body or if you contacted contacting anything dead they had to sprinkle you with that and then seven days later you could come back to the house of god but you were not coming to the house of god without being sprinkled that's right church that's why we shouldn't come to church with bad attitudes that's why we shouldn't come to church with bitterness between each other all right right we shouldn't come to church with with with sins in our lives in other words we should be sprinkled before we come even in the dark amen we should be clean we should be accepted in the sight of god and we shouldn't come here we should know better glory we got to grow up and mature praise god before i come in those doors everything's right between my savior and i praise god amen amen that's what that last one is about the fifth application will ramp said from one side to the other typing everything even the water separation the red heifer couldn't be a brown one they made the waters of separation to sprinkle the people after they'd sinned and gone outside the camp now they hissed up the cedar wood all mixed together how the wood and the tabernacle all the bracing altar the labor the shoe red everything pointed to christ and in him we are complete in jesus christ everything in the tabernacle points to jesus christ here it does the bible said jesus was without spot or blemish just like the red heifer there never came a yoke on the red heifer brother rabbit says jesus was never in the yolk of a denomination praise god and the bible said the red heifer had to be killed outside of the camp that's right and the bible said jesus died outside the city that's right outside the canyon that's right see christ was not yoked with any organization he didn't fool with them he wasn't yoked up with all this nothing he says now here's a picture and our arse idea of the red heifer look how far away it was outside the camp that's that's the solomon's time look at that big solomon's temple there this is how far the red heifer had to be because this was going to become sin right this had to die as a sacrifice this couldn't be inside the camp it had to be outside the camp church it had to die outside the camp it had to be cursed so they could be class amen jesus had to be cursed with our sins that we could be washed amen amen praise god and then before they sprinkled anybody they had to take that blood of the heifer and sprinkle it seven times at the door of the tabernacle standing for seven church ages praise god hallelujah right and the bible said jesus is one red heifer sacrifice was once and for all praise god in church i was happy to say there was blood for ephesus submyrna pergamos thyrotira sardis philadelphia and thank god there's blood for laodicea today thank god there's blood for you and i am amen the same love that forgave martin luther the same blood that forgave paul the same blood that forgave brother branham is the same blood that forgives you and i praise god amen hallelujah amen the red heifer was the one that died praise god that was the perfect sacrifice amen and all of us sinners benefit from it thank god amen thank you jesus for the blood of light amen now there's a picture of taking the ashes and you know putting the water in there and then here's a picture of the hyssop they would take the hyster before they came in and they had to sprinkle the people that were unclean maybe they touched a dead body of an animal or maybe maybe someone died in their home and they saw they walked in on us they had to be sprinkled and there's a picture of hyssop i mean it's just there's some that are purple and some that are not so i don't know if they lose their purpleness at the end of the season i don't know but david said purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me i'll be watering snow this is after he committed the adulterous act and murder all right he says lord let that hyster be taken let that priest bring that hyssop over to me and let it be sprinkled i want to come back to the house of god i want to be right again create in me a clean heart oh god amen renew a steadfast spirit in me they don't compromise with lust or murder or anger created me a heart like yours what's he going to use his son common brother says just common it's all around history you can find it anywhere common faith the blood of jesus christ applies the spirit of god just applied just commonly in other words like a common prayer lord forgive me i am so i confess that i did this i should not have done it i knew better i've done this before forgive me just get sprinkled with a common sprinkle that's right every single person imagine if someone died or dog died or animal diet you've got to get sprinkled this was a common everyday occurrence you go down there if you imagine if you took it if i just took it and just sprinkled you right in the face you know you you close your eyes and you know you just you'd accept it but that was god's way if you even want to get in this tabernacle first you got to accept the sprinkling and peter said we should be sprinkled with the blood of jesus christ in other words we should receive an anointing a small anointing of god's spirit to repent of our sins amen amen i was clean but then i got dirty by watching this or by saying that or thinking that or planning this or lying about that yeah that's right i got dirty i knew better the lord now cleanse me and the bible said you were cleansed it was very simple praise god very simple jesus i want to cleanse you with common issue praise god common faith right common confession if any man says he doesn't have sins that man's a liar ah but thank god there's plenty of on the road to the tabernacle right now just grab the heads up or the priest priest grab the history sprinkle me wash me because i want to be a worshiper amen hallelujah praise god don't leave me out of the tabernacle i want to worship i want to be in god's presence amen hallelujah now this other idea all the males had to appear at least three times a year before the uh before the lord at the tabernacle and that was at the season the third month uh would have been the fifth month and the seventh month okay for the seven feasts but some of the feasts are together right we know that there's three feasts in the third month there's one feast in the fifth month that's the feast of weeks and there's three months or three feasts in the seventh month okay so in other words disappear three times and you'll hit all the seven festivals praise god and now notice the bible says when you come i want to see this i want you to see this church those men shall not ever say not appear before the lord empty don't come to church with your hands empty i'm only asking you to come three times a year right guys like when you come bring a sacrifice bring something praise god because as every man as he's able what are we able to bring god i'm not asking for money i'm asking for you to bring god a song or bring god a worship or bring god yourself make yourself a priest unto god let god use you tonight even get in the spirit and god will give you a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge or a tone or interpretation don't come empty come full say god use me i'm giving myself as a sacrifice how many times have we had that like remember when sister naomi helped out sister lydia i don't know if you remember that i prayed for lydia it wasn't helping but our sister dealt with her and she said as soon as she gave that testimony uh lydia said just like the holy spirit just gave her a clear perfect all all the pressure all the pain all the all the depression just left right there you never know how it's going to be so you got to be sensitive to the holy spirit praise god praise the lord that's right you never know sure someone needs some something in the prayer line you say the preacher will say just the right thing you need to hear and god will answer the prayer amen you never know but don't come empty come and give to god as you're able give base upon the conditions that god bless that's my church i don't mind coming to church and looking like a fool because i come here to give god praise because he's blessed me so much amen amen how can i not give you grace i cannot put on that crazy silly jesus hat that looks like looks like a gangster hat because god healed my mama cancer i'll do anything to tell people that jesus loves him he's alive he still heals because he's been so good to me he's blessed me i'll do anything for him praise god i don't want to come empty i'm going to come full and give god a real sacrifice [Music] amen notice the men not sisters are not excused but he puts the emphasis on those leaders praise god hallelujah now there was so many ways to sacrifice if you couldn't make so if you could you just came those three times well there were still times if you were a leper and you got healed you still had to go you had to go as soon as you were healed and offer a sacrifice that's right when a woman had a baby male or female she had to go right away and after she was healed up she'd go right away and make a sacrifice even church even when your beasts had babies that's right the church said yeah right even when your animals had babies you got to go sacrifice for the firstborn some other animal had to die because you had first-born bulls yeah or first-born cows or whatever it may be you had to sacrifice other animals for those imagine how often you'd be in the house of god probably like this right right like us amen constant sacrifices but this is god and god was showing the world this is my people these are my kingdom of priests these are people that know me better than anybody else this is the nation that knows me i'll exalt them i'll use them this was the nation that god carved mighty men out of this nation amen not the other nations this nation a nation of kingdom of priests who sacrifice who believe god's word amen church one day during the year the bible says there was one day when god forgave everything for the whole year this year it's october 4th and 5th it's called yom kippur yeah it starts on the sundown of october 4th and ends on the sundown of october 5th that's the day of atonement that's the day where god says i'm going to forgive everybody's sins at this day and only the high priest could go once a year the bible said but not without blood amen if we're going to be forgiven we need blood amen that's why we have to trust in the blood of jesus christ pray about the blood of jesus christ think about the blood of jesus christ amen amen focus on the blood of jesus christ need amen because we're saved without works amen amen that blood took our place nothing we did everything he did praise god amen that's the lord god almighty so leviticus 16 if you want to read it at home this entire chapter details the day of atonement there's like my goodness i looked up the website there's about 20 or 30 40 things to do on this day it was a day filled with all these types and shadows the high priest had to do things the people had to do things there's just so much it was an annual year-long atonement foreshadowing jesus once for all atonement with his own blood praise god so see it was once in the year once in the year everybody had a clean state that's kind of how a perversion of january 1st in america oh everybody gets a new start everybody's going to go on a diet how long does that last once a year we got a fresh start church again i'm a fresh start every single day praise god and i thought there's more power than that just having a fresh start every day today's a new day right i didn't do good yesterday i'm gonna start a new day today praise god i'm gonna get on a roll by god's grace with everything spiritually and naturally but the bible said in hebrews 10 10 once and for all jesus gave a sacrifice one sacrifice for all sins amen praise god lamb of god now here's here's a visual for you now here's the tabernacle remember you before you could even get in the gate you've got to be sprinkled if you were unclean right now if you were not unclean you could just walk right in there without your time the first thing you would see is a brace and altar that's where the animal died we'll get to that the laver was a a pool of water where the the priests washed their hands after the killing of the animal and then here's the holy place now this is actually two rooms austelina uh the holy place is the small uh the yeah the bigger room and the small room is the holiest of holiness right okay so we'll go through this and this is a great lesson i've used this in my life i use it all the time sure all the time yeah this is how i picture myself in every service now if you could zoom out here is what here's what god saw
