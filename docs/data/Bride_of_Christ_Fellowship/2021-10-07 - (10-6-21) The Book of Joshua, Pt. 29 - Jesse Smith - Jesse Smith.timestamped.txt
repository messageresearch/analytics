[1:43] service where the word of god is
[1:44] preached and we know there's life and
[1:46] death in the power of the tongue and
[1:47] we're trusting the life of jesus christ

[1:51] speak through yours as well as you say

[2:32] glorified in everything said and done
[2:34] lord may you have preeminence tonight
[2:36] god may you do what you've been longing
[2:37] to do in our lives hallelujah as we obey
[2:40] your word and as we love you god more
[2:42] and more we pray you'll make us ready
[2:43] for your soon coming in jesus christ's
[2:45] name and the saint said
[2:47] amen god bless you as you're being
[2:48] seated there praise god
[2:51] so let me just take here a few moments
[2:52] and we'll just look at a a few thoughts
[2:54] here about the gospel we'll just try to
[2:56] lay it out
[2:59] briefly by the grace of god
[3:03] the gospel is a beautiful story how many
[3:05] can say amen to that
[3:06] there's the word gospel means good news
[3:09] jesus christ came preaching the gospel
[3:11] you know what his first word was
[3:13] repent
[3:15] so if you want to hear the good news you
[3:17] first got to repent of all the bad
[3:19] things you've done
[3:20] praise god
[3:21] and that's how when we become christians
[3:23] that's how it happened for all of us
[3:24] here who have become christians we heard
[3:27] the good news but to make it good news
[3:29] we had to know the bad news the bad news
[3:32] is that we're we've all fallen short of
[3:34] the glory of god right we all sinned and
[3:36] come short of god's glory we're on the
[3:38] path to hell unless we repent of our
[3:40] sins
[3:41] repent means to turn around and go the
[3:43] opposite direction praise god and so the
[3:45] gospel comes to say turn around and
[3:48] choose life that you might live
[3:51] the gospel comes to say reject satan and
[3:54] reject death and reject hell and accept
[3:57] eternal life praise god that's a
[3:59] beautiful message amen and we are the
[4:01] ones of church we're the carers of that
[4:03] message amen
[4:04] that we have the good news of the
[4:06] glorious gospel of jesus christ so let's
[4:09] go back to john 3 16. we'll try to get
[4:11] some scriptures up here
[4:13] and uh just look at this briefly i just
[4:15] maybe i'll take about 15 minutes we'll
[4:17] see how the lord directs
[4:19] but i just want to clearly present this
[4:20] here
[4:22] uh because i don't know everyone's
[4:23] background and it's just it's always
[4:25] fresh to hear it again by god's grace
[4:27] amen the gospel never gets old if it
[4:29] does and the bible says then we haven't
[4:31] been adding anointing to our lives
[4:34] right that's what the statue of reverend
[4:35] man is all about if we do all those
[4:37] things then the bible says
[4:39] we will not be forgetful right of the
[4:41] gospel we'll be fruitful we'll abound
[4:44] and an entrance will be made into us for
[4:46] eternal life
[4:47] if we keep adding the anointing of the
[4:49] holy spirit that's what the gospel is
[4:51] more anointing of the holy spirit amen
[4:54] john 3 16 we read that for god so loved
[4:56] the world so god loved the world gave
[4:59] his only son jesus christ that whosoever
[5:01] believeth him should not perish but have
[5:03] everlasting life how many believe in
[5:05] christ tonight
[5:07] amen now look at verse 17 for god sent
[5:09] not his son
[5:10] into the world to condemn the world but
[5:12] the world through him might be saved so
[5:16] god doesn't want anyone to be lost
[5:18] right so that's why he sent his son he
[5:20] sent his son to save praise god
[5:22] jesus's first coming was for salvation
[5:26] now church his second coming is for
[5:28] judgment
[5:29] hallelujah so he came first when jesus
[5:31] walked the earth he came to save amen i
[5:34] didn't know you did not come to condemn
[5:36] but here at the end time we're so close
[5:38] to his second coming here he's coming to
[5:41] rescue his bride for all those who are
[5:43] believers but all those who reject the
[5:45] good news they will be judged the bible
[5:47] says
[5:48] now look here the next let me look at
[5:50] the next verse here verse 18 he that
[5:52] believeth him is not on him is not
[5:54] condemned but he that believeth not is
[5:57] condemned already
[5:59] because he hath not believed in the name
[6:01] of the only begotten son of god now that
[6:04] includes billions and millions of people
[6:07] right because uh billions of people do
[6:09] not believe on jesus christ as the
[6:11] messiah
[6:12] the muslims the hindus and uh all the uh
[6:16] religions of china and japan all these
[6:18] billions of people do not believe on the
[6:20] name of jesus christ so at this point
[6:23] they're headed for hell but you and i by
[6:25] god's grace can be used by god to win
[6:28] the souls that want to accept jesus
[6:30] christ we can we can be gospel spreaders
[6:34] praise god to those people who are
[6:35] longing for eternal life amen hallelujah
[6:39] verse now look at verse 19 now here's
[6:41] for you and i
[6:42] this is the condemnation of
[6:45] the easter jesus's red letter words
[6:48] why are people going to be condemned and
[6:50] go to hell jesus answers it because
[6:52] light is coming to the world but men
[6:55] loved darkness rather than light
[6:58] because their deeds were evil
[7:01] so church it comes down to this a person
[7:03] will be saved because they love jesus
[7:05] christ more than they love sin
[7:08] and people will be condemned because
[7:09] they love sin more than they love jesus
[7:11] christ
[7:12] so this is what john 3 16 is all about
[7:15] god love god loved people so he sent his
[7:18] son so people would grab the light and
[7:20] walk in the light rather than
[7:22] lay a hold of darkness
[7:24] that's the word of god amen now look at
[7:27] verse 20 for everyone that doeth evil
[7:29] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[7:32] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[7:35] now look jesus says there's going to be
[7:37] people that hate my light that hate the
[7:40] word of god and the light is truth
[7:42] there's people today that just hate the
[7:44] truth
[7:45] right they they can't stand the truth
[7:47] but jesus said those are the people that
[7:48] will be lost but those who love the
[7:51] truth those are the people that will be
[7:52] saved amen and we are amongst that group
[7:55] that believe the light we believe the
[7:57] word of god and we are destined to be
[8:00] saved because of god's mercy praise god
[8:03] now look at verse 21 how are we saved
[8:05] but he that doeth truth
[8:08] cometh to the light
[8:10] see so you must do truth and you must
[8:13] come to the light that his deeds may be
[8:16] made manifest that they are wrong in god
[8:19] so when a person is living in sin
[8:21] they're in darkness they don't know
[8:22] jesus christ and they're disobedient to
[8:25] jesus christ but when the light shines
[8:27] on them they have a choice am i going to
[8:28] remain in darkness and walk away from
[8:30] the light or am i going to walk into the
[8:32] light and be saved
[8:34] amen church that's the good news the
[8:37] good news is you don't have to live in
[8:38] darkness you can live in the light amen
[8:41] hallelujah and the way to get there is
[8:44] to repent and say you're sorry and
[8:46] that's what jesus said that your deeds
[8:49] may be made manifest
[8:51] so a real christian experience is when
[8:53] you come to the altar or you you're
[8:54] praying with a friend a christian and
[8:57] you say jesus forgive me of all my sins
[9:00] i'm sorry for my lies maybe my uh maybe
[9:03] my stealing right uh of my curses i'm
[9:07] sorry of my fornication having sex
[9:09] before marriage i'm sorry my adultery
[9:12] having sex with someone outside of
[9:13] marriage i'm sorry for my blasphemy
[9:16] using your name as a cuss word
[9:18] right i'm sorry of of all the wickedness
[9:22] of this world right homosexuality
[9:24] bestiality transgenderism all these
[9:26] things i'm sorry for all these
[9:28] abominations but i'm coming to the light
[9:30] because i want to obey the light
[9:33] i believe jesus christ is the son of god
[9:35] and i'm coming for salvation today amen
[9:38] that's the gospel truth if i ever heard
[9:40] it amen
[9:41] because jesus said when you come to him
[9:43] you must come to the light and you must
[9:45] love the light more than you love
[9:47] darkness
[9:48] amen i know we are amongst the most
[9:51] unpopular churches and unpopular
[9:53] churches uh and preachers but that's
[9:55] okay jesus said few there be that find
[9:58] this narrow road god wants all to be
[10:00] saved but he knows only few will find it
[10:04] amen now let's go to acts 2 38 by god's
[10:07] grace
[10:08] there's one way
[10:09] to come that's to repent and then after
[10:12] you've repented of your sins you are
[10:14] fully buried under water you're baptized
[10:17] under water you're not sprinkled you're
[10:19] baptized under the water and that water
[10:21] represents death you go under death your
[10:24] old your old life is dead and gone and
[10:27] you raise up a new life praise god a new
[10:30] christian hallelujah so acts 2 38 peter
[10:33] said them repent let's turn from all
[10:35] your sins and be baptized every one of
[10:38] you in the name of jesus christ for the
[10:40] remission that's the sending away of
[10:43] your sins how many glad god sent your
[10:45] sins away
[10:46] i don't live in my sins anymore they've
[10:48] been sent away
[10:51] when you're a sinner those sins that
[10:53] they they're a burden to you you're
[10:56] walking with the burden of oh i've done
[10:57] this and i i got all these problems and
[11:00] because you haven't confessed your sins
[11:02] but when you come to jesus christ and
[11:03] you confess your sins he takes all those
[11:06] burdens away and then you can run to the
[11:08] people that you've hurt and say forgive
[11:10] me i'm sorry why because the burden of
[11:12] sin is gone you're forgiven and you're
[11:15] guaranteed to go to heaven amen
[11:17] glory it's repentance and then being
[11:20] baptized in water calling on the name of
[11:23] jesus christ
[11:25] for that is the name that every knee
[11:27] shall bow to every tongue will confess
[11:29] that jesus christ is lord for the glory
[11:32] of god the father
[11:34] amen and then sometime after that you
[11:37] receive the feeling of the holy ghost
[11:39] you get so full you might scream glory
[11:41] you get so full you might shout amen you
[11:44] get so full you might speak in tongues
[11:46] but one thing you'll do is you'll give
[11:48] god glory for the wonderful works he's
[11:50] done amen
[11:52] that's what they did on the day of
[11:53] pentecost they said how do we hear all
[11:54] the wonderful works of god in our
[11:56] language if you're really born again
[11:58] you'll worship god with all your heart
[12:00] praise god
[12:01] and then after that you will strive
[12:03] daily to live a holy life like that song
[12:06] says let my life be a symphony let my
[12:09] life be a song of holy holy holy unto
[12:13] the lord
[12:15] hallelujah how do you know you love
[12:16] jesus you come to the light let's go to
[12:18] another one john 14.
[12:21] how do you know you love jesus you keep
[12:22] his commands
[12:24] that's what coming to the light means
[12:26] four times jesus said this he said if
[12:29] you love me you'll keep my commands
[12:32] verse 15 john 14 verse 15.
[12:39] everybody says i love jesus but not
[12:41] everybody obeys jesus
[12:44] that's the real proof how you know if
[12:45] you love jesus you do what he says
[12:48] hallelujah you come to the light you
[12:50] don't stay in darkness and love sin and
[12:52] love darkness and cussing and swear and
[12:54] dirty sexual shows and all things like
[12:56] that you don't love that you leave the
[12:58] darkness and you come to the light
[12:59] praise god
[13:00] hallelujah
[13:02] john 14 verse 15. let's read it together
[13:04] one two three if ye love me
[13:07] keep my commandments praise god
[13:10] verse go to verse 21 let's read that one
[13:13] two three he that hath my commandments
[13:16] and keepeth them he it is that loveth me
[13:19] and also we'll stop right there go to
[13:21] verse 23 let's read that one two three
[13:23] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[13:26] man loved me he will keep my words and
[13:29] the church said
[13:30] how many times does jesus have to repeat
[13:32] it till we get it church here he repeats
[13:34] it three times and i think there's a
[13:36] couple more in that chapter if you love
[13:37] me obey me if you love me do what i said
[13:40] amen if you're glad i died for your sins
[13:42] then obey what i said because i'm trying
[13:44] to make you like me praise god amen i'm
[13:47] trying to put my jesus i'm trying to put
[13:49] my spirit in you so that you can glorify
[13:52] the father amen
[13:54] so you can finally glorify the one who
[13:56] created you and you can be what father
[13:59] god made you to
[14:01] amen hallelujah that's the gospel
[14:04] hallelujah if you love jesus you'll keep
[14:06] his commands amen
[14:09] we've got people that have kept his
[14:10] commands for 40 50 years here praise god
[14:13] has it been a joy brother
[14:15] has there been trials
[14:17] but have you received grace for every
[14:18] trial
[14:20] let's say praise the lord praise the
[14:22] lord 40 50 years serving god not
[14:25] wavering but constant steadfast every
[14:27] trial that comes you knock it down every
[14:29] devil that comes you cast him off amen
[14:31] you just keep marching glorifying god
[14:34] proving that you love jesus amen proving
[14:37] that you're walking the light that you
[14:39] love the light and you despise darkness
[14:42] and you want to be with jesus for
[14:43] eternity
[14:45] oh that's the good news if i ever heard
[14:47] it praise god
[14:48] how did it heal your church
[14:51] now if i could just briefly say a few
[14:53] more things
[14:54] the way to be saved is to hear a
[14:56] preacher the bible said how can you hear
[14:59] except a preacher be sent
[15:01] romans 10 14 can you board up there
[15:03] honey
[15:04] this is the way if you come to church
[15:05] tonight that's the best thing you can do
[15:07] if you want to be saved
[15:08] because jesus said i'm sending the
[15:10] preachers look what he said how should
[15:12] they call on him in whom they've not
[15:14] believed how can you call on jesus if
[15:16] you don't believe in him
[15:18] and how should they believe in jesus of
[15:20] whom they've not heard how they're going
[15:22] to believe in somebody unless you hear
[15:24] about him and how should they hear about
[15:26] him without a preacher
[15:28] so jesus chooses just simple humble
[15:31] nitwit preachers like me hallelujah and
[15:34] he said he sends them or he'll send you
[15:36] to the preacher and you hear the good
[15:38] news that's how you hear about jesus you
[15:40] believe what that preacher said because
[15:42] you feel the holy spirit here you see
[15:45] the word of god written by the holy
[15:47] spirit and you say that's the light that
[15:49] i want to walk in amen
[15:51] and you believe this is how jesus set it
[15:54] up come hear a preacher the preacher
[15:56] that loves me will preach my truth and
[15:58] if he preaches it and you receive it
[16:00] you'll be saved
[16:02] hallelujah
[16:04] that's the word of god
[16:07] hallelujah
[16:08] now there's so many things i could say
[16:10] but i hope i'm laying that in there
[16:12] now once you get saved though you're
[16:15] going to want to stay with the church
[16:18] because jesus says once you're saved you
[16:20] become a sheep and a sheep cannot leave
[16:22] its shepherd
[16:24] that's right
[16:25] right there's one time a sheep did lose
[16:27] it what did jesus do he went to go find
[16:29] him amen and where did he leave him out
[16:31] there with the sinners and the wolves no
[16:33] he brought him back to the church amen
[16:36] he brought him back to the other sheep
[16:38] so if you're saved you will not wander
[16:40] out there if you do jesus will bring you
[16:42] back amen
[16:44] hallelujah
[16:47] bring you back where there's other sheep
[16:49] and where there's protection from a
[16:51] shepherd hallelujah
[16:53] that's the gospel way there's no other
[16:55] way to do it church
[16:57] this is god's way hear a preacher
[16:59] believe it and then you assemble with
[17:01] the saints until jesus comes back
[17:04] or you die and go to meet him early
[17:05] praise god hallelujah
[17:08] now if you would go to first john 2 19.
[17:11] if you got it it's in the back of the
[17:12] bible a case you'll put up here
[17:14] if it's difficult to find first john 2
[17:16] 19. look what john john wrote this and
[17:19] john lived with jesus for three and a
[17:21] half years
[17:23] and then jesus left jesus sent his holy
[17:25] spirit and filled john and then john
[17:27] wrote this
[17:28] they these are the lost the lost people
[17:30] went out from us but they were not of us
[17:34] for if they had been of us they no doubt
[17:39] have continued with us but they went out
[17:42] that they might be made manifest that
[17:44] they were not all of us
[17:46] so john said when people left our church
[17:49] it proved they were not believers like
[17:50] us
[17:51] because no doubt if they were believers
[17:54] they would have stayed with us
[17:56] a sheep is going to be indefensible a
[17:58] sheep has no defenses except the
[18:01] shepherd praise god and you and i cannot
[18:03] be strong believers we cannot it's going
[18:06] to be very difficult to be saved unless
[18:08] we stay with the sheep the fact that you
[18:10] stay here proves you're a sheep amen
[18:13] if people leave and they never come back
[18:16] that proves they were not sheep to begin
[18:17] with
[18:18] is that right that's what john says this
[18:21] is the holy ghost saying that those who
[18:24] have uh the are saved they will obey the
[18:27] word of god and they will stay with the
[18:29] saints
[18:30] hallelujah that's exactly right
[18:33] now
[18:34] maybe i'll just do one more here by the
[18:35] grace of god
[18:37] uh there's so much uh first corinthians
[18:39] 1 18. yes let's go with that one then
[18:41] we'll just move on to this
[18:42] uh this message i hope i'm preaching the
[18:44] gospel to you tonight in the the most
[18:47] simplistic form praise god
[18:49] if you love jesus you'll keep his
[18:51] commands
[18:53] hallelujah and he's peter said repent
[18:55] and then be baptized if you have not
[18:57] repented i encourage you to be repent
[18:59] tonight if you have not been baptized i
[19:02] don't know if we can baptize you tonight
[19:03] but we'll baptize you as soon as the sun
[19:05] comes up tomorrow
[19:06] we'll have to go to portland's lakes
[19:07] whenever they open up and we'll baptize
[19:09] you we don't have a baptismal pool in
[19:10] here but if you want to really be
[19:12] baptized and be a holy ghost feel satan
[19:14] and christian we'll baptize you in the
[19:16] morning praise god
[19:18] hallelujah
[19:19] now
[19:20] first corinthians 1 18. let's look at
[19:22] that
[19:23] got that hon could you put that up there
[19:26] first corinthians 1 18
[19:29] for the preaching of the cross is to
[19:31] them that perish foolishness in other
[19:34] words people going to hell don't want to
[19:36] hear about the cross
[19:38] but if you are going to heaven you love
[19:40] the cross amen because the cross is
[19:42] where jesus took all your whippings
[19:45] the cross is where jesus paid for all
[19:47] your sins
[19:49] he took your pain that you might be
[19:51] healed
[19:52] he took your punishment that you might
[19:54] be forgiven praise god
[19:57] it was a substitutionary sacrifice
[19:59] that's what a sacrifice is something
[20:01] takes your place amen jesus christ took
[20:04] our place he was beaten so he didn't
[20:06] look like a man he was bloodied so we
[20:09] didn't have to be praise god and the
[20:11] believers love hearing about that
[20:13] hallelujah
[20:15] that jesus christ loved us so much he
[20:17] bore the cross for us and then he
[20:19] defeated death which is a proof that we
[20:22] if we die in christ we'll raise with him
[20:25] amen praise god hallelujah
[20:28] but unto us which are saved it is the
[20:31] power of god preaching is power power
[20:34] means authority
[20:36] preaching is authority over the devil
[20:39] hallelujah when the word comes forth if
[20:42] you say amen you believe that and you
[20:44] plan on acting on that that gives you
[20:47] authority over satan
[20:49] the word of god the simple preaching of
[20:51] god's word tonight anyone who receives
[20:53] the word can have instant authority over
[20:56] satan amen that's the way god set it up
[20:59] praise god
[21:00] hear the word believe it accept it now
[21:03] you've got power amen
[21:06] all you gotta do is confess your sins
[21:07] and say lord i'm sorry i did this i'm
[21:09] sorry i did that i don't ever want to do
[21:11] that again now you've got authority now
[21:14] you've got kingdom power praise god now
[21:16] you're going to overcome
[21:18] that's exactly right praise god
[21:21] now look at verse 19.
[21:24] for it is written i will destroy the
[21:26] wisdom of the wise and will bring to
[21:28] nothing the understanding of the prudent
[21:30] so preaching is so foolish
[21:32] god hides eternal life in foolish
[21:34] preaching it looks foolish to the world
[21:37] right they think a big beyonce concert
[21:40] right or or some rock and roll concert
[21:41] they think that's a great thing that's
[21:43] foolishness to god
[21:45] right
[21:48] or that the maybe the uh whatever the
[21:50] super bowl whatever it is they think
[21:52] that's something great that's
[21:53] foolishness
[21:54] that's nonsense the real the real thing
[21:57] is right here tonight it's the gospel of
[21:59] jesus christ oh but it's so humble amen
[22:02] but that's where jesus that's the only
[22:03] place he feels welcome that's the only
[22:05] place that keeps his word amen jesus is
[22:08] not welcome at the super bowl he's not
[22:09] welcome at the nba game because they
[22:11] don't want him there they worship devils
[22:13] there but we worship jesus christ the
[22:15] risen savior of the world
[22:17] amen because he's welcome here tonight
[22:20] praise god
[22:21] amen
[22:23] so we're foolish to them but they're
[22:24] foolish to us so it depends whose fool
[22:27] you want to be i want to be a fool for
[22:29] jesus
[22:30] i'll always believe in jesus i'll be a
[22:32] fool for you they can make fun of me
[22:34] they can mock me they can do whatever
[22:35] they want but i believe jesus i'm
[22:37] choosing the light i'm turning down the
[22:39] darkness
[22:41] amen next verse 20.
[22:44] where's the wise where's the scribe
[22:45] where's the dispute of this world hath
[22:47] not god made foolish the wisdom of this
[22:49] world between one
[22:51] for after that in the wisdom of god the
[22:53] world by wisdom knew not god it pleased
[22:56] god by the foolishness of preaching to
[22:58] save them that believe
[23:01] so you go to the white house tonight
[23:02] you're not going to hear the gospel
[23:04] they think they're saying all nice
[23:05] things about coven and trying to keep
[23:07] everybody living in fear and shoot them
[23:09] up with things we don't even know what's
[23:10] in there they think that's that's great
[23:12] that's foolishness
[23:14] that's not eternal life eternal life is
[23:16] here tonight because jesus is here to
[23:18] forgive jesus is here to heal jesus is
[23:21] here to save amen this is the real
[23:23] eternal life this is what gives you hope
[23:25] this is what gives you strength this is
[23:27] what gives you joy this is what gives
[23:29] you a future amen
[23:31] it's only in jesus christ praise god
[23:33] you'll find it nowhere else yes we're
[23:35] supposed to respect the president yes we
[23:36] respect all these guys and we pray for
[23:38] them that they'll repent praise god but
[23:41] there's one place where life comes and
[23:43] that's in the gospel of jesus
[23:46] amen
[23:48] praise god now
[23:50] i think i laid that pretty clear there

[24:07] doctrine the word what is doctrine
[24:09] doctrine doctrine means an instruction
[24:12] so i already gave you some doctrine
[24:14] tonight if you want to get saved repent
[24:15] be baptized
[24:18] the name of jesus christ that's
[24:19] instruction

[24:39] give how to be a good husband
[24:43] how to be a good wife and the sister
[24:44] said brothers brother said amen amen
[24:48] how to be an obedient child there's
[24:50] steps i can give you an instruction
[24:52] that's called doctrine and look what the
[24:54] bible says whoever transgressed that
[24:56] means purposely disobeys and does not
[24:59] abide or live in the doctrine of christ
[25:02] the instructions of christ does not have
[25:04] god
[25:06] if you don't obey the instructions of
[25:08] the gospel you don't have god amen but
[25:11] thank god there's more to this verse
[25:12] amen i'm glad the holy spirit didn't
[25:14] stop there he kept writing amen
[25:17] he said he that abides who lives who
[25:21] continues in the instruction of christ
[25:23] he has both the father and the son
[25:27] hallelujah
[25:29] that's how you know you're in the gospel
[25:31] that's how you know that jesus christ is
[25:33] truly your savior you abide in the word
[25:36] you live in the word you love the word
[25:38] you obey the word you die for the word
[25:42] ah
[25:44] let's say praise the lord
[25:47] i don't think i preached his heart on
[25:48] wednesday night a long time
[25:50] but you're all pulling like that so
[25:52] we feel the pull praise god amen now
[25:56] i'm going to stop right there now let's
[25:58] go to as far as with that introduction
[26:00] that was only
[26:01] my timer stopped so i'm sorry so give me
[26:04] a few minutes now i'm going to preach
[26:05] here to the uh
[26:07] the main church of course everybody can
[26:08] receive some of it
[26:10] but let's take a few minutes on this
[26:12] we've been uh preaching on the book of
[26:14] joshua and if you don't know joshua he
[26:16] was the prophet that followed moses
[26:18] moses brought israel out of egypt after
[26:21] over 440 years of bondage they were
[26:23] slaves they were brick makers right but
[26:26] moses brought them out by the power of
[26:28] god moses brought him through a red sea
[26:30] the red sea stood up
[26:32] and there's evidence that that's there's
[26:34] evidence of that right we got the video
[26:36] there's evidence today scientists have
[26:38] found that the red sea parted
[26:40] hallelujah
[26:41] just like they got evidence for southern
[26:43] gamora they got evidence for everything
[26:45] amen
[26:48] evidence i saw yesterday for king
[26:49] hezekiah they got all this evidence oh
[26:52] it's just a humble if you want to find
[26:54] it god will show it to you amen
[26:57] he says it's these doubters it's these
[26:58] haters it's these sin lovers that
[27:00] despise the things of god but god's word
[27:02] is true it's forever set on heaven god's
[27:05] word will never fail us amen
[27:07] hallelujah every day they find more and
[27:09] more proof that god's word is right
[27:11] hallelujah that means there's more and
[27:12] more proof that we're going to heaven
[27:14] hallelujah
[27:15] thank god
[27:17] praise god hallelujah
[27:19] so moses brought him out but then moses
[27:20] made a mistake he was out in the
[27:22] wilderness and and god said speak to the
[27:24] rock and give these people water and
[27:26] moses said you bunch of rebels and he
[27:28] smoked a rock and god said because you
[27:30] glorified yourself you'll not take them
[27:32] in
[27:33] so god said go up there moses get ready
[27:35] to die now god was going to be gracious
[27:37] he was going to resurrect him in a few
[27:38] days
[27:39] because satan's going to say where is
[27:40] that body where's that body but but
[27:42] moses died and then joshua now had the
[27:45] anointing and god said as i was with you
[27:47] joshua i'll be i'm sorry as i was with
[27:50] moses so i'll be with you
[27:52] and so god did the same thing they
[27:54] crossed the jordan river much smaller of
[27:55] course but god pulled back the water and
[27:58] two million people walked over strong
[28:00] into the promised land praise god and
[28:03] that's where we pick up today after five
[28:05] or seven years of battles now joshua is
[28:08] giving these tribes of israel their
[28:10] inheritance
[28:12] all right now
[28:15] tonight lord willing i just want to show
[28:16] this tonight i want to look at asher now
[28:18] let me expand the page here just a
[28:20] little bit it might help you a little
[28:21] bit
[28:21] so this would have been about uh
[28:24] 2500 years ago
[28:26] but we can learn lessons today the bible
[28:29] says all these old stories were written
[28:31] for our understanding
[28:34] in other words you and i were when we
[28:36] were sinners we were in egypt
[28:39] right
[28:40] we were slaves to sin and the church
[28:41] said amen don't forget where you come
[28:43] from don't forget where you come from
[28:44] church
[28:46] don't forget you were once lost but
[28:47] thank god you're found amen
[28:49] you were in egypt like they were
[28:51] spiritual egypt but god brought you out
[28:54] and brought you through the water
[28:55] there's that water baptism praise god
[28:58] right and then he brought you the
[29:00] wilderness to test you to see if you
[29:02] would obey all the word of god
[29:04] hallelujah then if you obey all the word
[29:06] of god then he brings you into the
[29:08] promised land or not or here across
[29:12] jordan this is the jordan river god had
[29:13] to bring the people into jordan which
[29:15] represents the baptism of the holy ghost
[29:18] or being filled with the spirit of god
[29:19] so there's three steps to being filled
[29:22] with god's spirit
[29:23] there's getting saved out of egypt being
[29:25] baptized there's the testing of
[29:27] sanctification and then there's the
[29:29] baptism of the holy ghost
[29:31] and once you get in here you fight great
[29:33] battles but then eventually church don't
[29:34] you want to settle down
[29:36] after after fighting devils and after
[29:38] fighting battles don't you want to find
[29:40] a place that's your own
[29:42] don't you want to find a place where you
[29:44] can just settle down and rest and just
[29:46] enjoy the blessings of god
[29:48] that's what god has for us we leave the
[29:51] world and we have to then we develop in
[29:53] through the second step we develop good
[29:56] habits and then when when god's ready he
[29:59] brings us in the promised land and we
[30:01] fight off great battles but then we get
[30:03] a time of rest where we can enjoy the
[30:05] blessings of god the peace of god the
[30:08] joy of god the mercy of god oh the faith
[30:11] of god hallelujah the peace that passes
[30:13] all your standing amen we can find where
[30:16] god wants us to be and we can be assured
[30:19] that we are doing what god's called us
[30:20] to do
[30:22] that's what that's their story and now
[30:24] it's our story
[30:26] so this was the story of israel 2500
[30:28] years ago but now it's our spiritual
[30:30] story
[30:32] all right
[30:33] so
[30:35] um
[30:36] let's review this real quick
[30:38] so we've looked at the tribe of reuben
[30:41] based upon the prophecy of the holy
[30:43] ghost he was later his tribe was
[30:45] disgraced and demoted and replaced by
[30:48] judah so there's a sad story of someone
[30:51] who who was the oldest and should have
[30:53] had the birthright but because of his
[30:55] sexual sin he lost all of his blessings
[30:59] that's the story of reuben very sad
[31:01] story but he's still saved because he
[31:02] repented at the end right now simeon and
[31:05] levi they had an awful start they were
[31:07] murderers
[31:09] but god forgave them now simeon his his
[31:12] his descendants fell into insignificance
[31:15] but levi repented that and all his
[31:17] descendants were brought into the
[31:18] priesthood they were the ones who
[31:21] ministered in the ark of the covenant
[31:23] they're the ones that brought the blood
[31:25] of the sacrifice into the holiest of
[31:27] holies oh my church god can do great
[31:29] things with someone who's fallen god
[31:31] wants to redeem your life god has great
[31:34] things for your life if you'll repent of
[31:36] your past sins and be dedicated to god
[31:38] god will do great things for you
[31:41] he took them from murderers
[31:44] to the ones ministering the holy things
[31:46] of god
[31:47] and he brought him out of darkness into
[31:50] the light and not just the sunlight the
[31:51] shekinah light amen hallelujah the holy
[31:55] spirit light praise god he takes levi
[31:57] out of the darkness of murder and into
[31:59] the light of the holy spirit
[32:02] what a what a testimony
[32:04] now judah was just all around a faithful
[32:06] boy
[32:08] and because reuben fell in sin god
[32:09] exalted judah up and that's where we get
[32:11] jesus christ is the lion of the tribe of
[32:14] judah because judah was such an obedient
[32:16] son in his offspring they got exalted to
[32:19] the head of israel and that's why david
[32:22] was of the tribe of judah praise god
[32:24] that's why all the good kings came out
[32:26] of judah because the holy spirit said
[32:28] your seed will hold the scepter of god
[32:31] your seed will be the lawgivers amen and
[32:34] they will be the holders of the scepter
[32:36] until shiloh comes until jesus comes
[32:39] church jesus has the scepter tonight
[32:41] praise god
[32:43] jesus has the authority tonight jesus is
[32:45] our king tonight that's why we come here
[32:47] to give our king praise and honor
[32:50] amen
[32:51] that's right
[32:53] now dan was a small tribe he was honored
[32:57] in samson's life i never heard of samson
[32:59] he had that long hair he couldn't cut it
[33:00] for all those years of his life i don't
[33:02] think he cut it for about
[33:03] uh would have been about 40 years of his
[33:05] life
[33:07] because he judged israel 20 years after
[33:09] the holy ghost first came upon him so
[33:10] he's probably a teenager or maybe late
[33:12] late teens early 20s and he he ruled for
[33:15] 20 years and then he got then he
[33:16] disobeyed with delilah right got his
[33:18] eyes popped out cut his hair but then
[33:20] the hair grew back
[33:22] and god's grace came back to him yeah
[33:25] church if you've lost your power jesus
[33:27] wants to give it back amen and the way
[33:29] to do that is wait upon the lord and
[33:31] he'll renew your strength like the eagle
[33:34] amen
[33:35] there's the eagle and dan's anoint dan's
[33:37] uh remember dan's uh flag dan standard
[33:41] was the eagle praise god huh there it is
[33:43] samson he's brought he got his strength
[33:46] back like the ego praise god
[33:48] that was the banner their tribe was
[33:49] under the eagle flag
[33:52] but later after samson died the whole
[33:54] tribe went into idolatry they set up a
[33:57] calf can you imagine a cow they set up a
[33:59] cow and bowed down and worshipped that
[34:01] they were so deceived see they left the
[34:03] light for the
[34:04] darkness what a mistake church we should
[34:07] not bow down to anything we should only
[34:09] bow down to jesus christ
[34:11] bow down to no government right or no
[34:14] family member praise god don't bow down
[34:16] to any sin only bow down to jesus christ
[34:19] and say jesus i worship you give me your
[34:22] power give me your authority to overcome
[34:24] all these false spirits
[34:26] all these i idols give me grace to
[34:28] overcome these idols and you know what
[34:30] he will
[34:32] amen
[34:33] that's what the word of god says church
[34:35] now naphtali
[34:37] was a great tribe
[34:40] they helped barrick and deborah get the
[34:43] victory
[34:44] uh years after joshua had passed away
[34:47] but then the beautiful thing about
[34:49] naphtali if i'll just skip ahead to that
[34:52] it's hard to see here i don't think i
[34:54] can zoom in yeah the beautiful thing
[34:56] about naphtali does this look familiar
[34:58] we looked at this last wednesday night
[34:59] does capernaum sound familiar jesus
[35:02] christ made his home base capernaum
[35:06] and all of his almost all of his
[35:08] apostles he called out of this area
[35:12] so naphtali has prophecy that says he's
[35:15] going to be he's going to have goodly
[35:17] words and he's going to be swift like a
[35:19] deer
[35:20] and that was prophetic of jesus praise
[35:23] god
[35:24] jesus was the deer that the shulamite in
[35:27] song of psalms come quickly come quickly
[35:29] simon come to me quickly like a deer i
[35:32] want to be with you set me as a seal
[35:34] upon your heart praise god hallelujah
[35:37] and then the bible said the holy spirit
[35:38] of jesus is the seal in our hearts
[35:41] praise god
[35:42] so this prophecy was speaking of jesus
[35:45] christ and his apostles had the the uh
[35:48] the agility and the beauty of a deer the
[35:51] swiftness of a deer they had a swift
[35:53] quick ministry it was only three and a
[35:55] half years
[35:56] they had a short ministry but they were
[35:58] speaking good words they were speaking
[36:00] life they were speaking resurrection
[36:02] they were speaking eternal life they
[36:04] were speaking victory they were speaking
[36:06] healing they were speaking deliverance
[36:08] and god backed it up just like god backs
[36:11] us up amen
[36:12] if you want to be free you can be free
[36:14] tonight if you want to be delivered
[36:15] tonight you can be delivered tonight
[36:17] it's all done by the goodly words of
[36:20] jesus christ
[36:21] amen
[36:23] praise god
[36:25] now
[36:27] and then we looked at gad last last
[36:29] sunday
[36:30] dad was a tribe that
[36:32] had warriors that lost they were really
[36:34] great wars but for some reason they kept
[36:36] losing but the holy spirit said you just
[36:38] keep believing and by the end you'll get
[36:41] the victory and that's what happened in
[36:42] the days of david in david's time they
[36:44] overcame all their neighboring enemies
[36:46] the moabites and all the other enemies
[36:49] uh the the the gorgeous side gurgicites
[36:51] i believe they overcame all them because
[36:54] god promised them just keep fighting and
[36:56] you'll get the victory
[36:58] out of god also came elijah the tishbite
[37:03] because that's part of gilead praise god
[37:05] and he brought forth justice as god's
[37:08] mouthpiece he came out of gad amen
[37:11] and that's what god said he said dad you
[37:13] will judge israel and that's exactly
[37:15] what he did praise god through the
[37:17] prophet elijah brought down the
[37:18] judgments of god he called fire down
[37:21] from heaven he called all these
[37:22] judgments upon ahab and jezebel the dogs
[37:25] will lick your blood right that was the
[37:27] judgment upon them they had space to
[37:29] repent but they repented not church we
[37:32] ought to rejoice god's giving us a few
[37:33] hours here we can repent amen
[37:36] god's giving us space to repent of our
[37:38] sins and so we must take advantage of
[37:40] that praise god
[37:42] amen now
[37:44] i'm going to skip past this
[37:46] let's try to look at asher for a few
[37:47] minutes i think you're going to be
[37:48] encouraged by asher
[37:50] there's just a lot of there's just a lot
[37:52] of uh simple
[37:54] uh life related blessings we can see in
[37:57] the life of asher
[37:59] now from what i study church he's the
[38:01] youngest of all of them as far as i
[38:02] could study of the fir of the the
[38:05] the wife leah
[38:07] out of leah
[38:09] okay because remember out of rachel know
[38:10] he came the youngest was benjamin but
[38:12] out of the first wife leah here's the
[38:15] youngest so we would say you know in
[38:16] those days the youngest wasn't look look
[38:18] it wasn't looked on too good
[38:20] remember in bible days
[38:22] remember uh jesse he went to samuel's
[38:25] i'm sorry samuel went to jesse's house
[38:26] and he said i'm gonna make one of your
[38:27] boys kings did they even get the
[38:29] youngest one
[38:30] do they even say hey david come on in
[38:32] the prophet's here we might be king did
[38:34] they even call for him
[38:36] they thought no way could the youngest
[38:38] be a real man of god he's just the
[38:41] youngest got any youngest in here
[38:44] god has a plan for all of us moses was
[38:46] the youngest ah
[38:47] hallelujah god can use you if you're
[38:50] united to the holy spirit praise god
[38:55] so asher's this insignificant youngest
[38:58] from leah not even from the really loved
[39:00] wife rachel
[39:03] but because god saw what was going to be
[39:05] in this young boy's heart now look he
[39:06] had a lot of people to learn from didn't
[39:08] he brother william
[39:09] he could learn from the oldest reuben
[39:11] he could get lessons from naphtali he
[39:14] could get all these lessons from
[39:15] issachar zebulun judah right judah oh
[39:18] man i can learn from all my brothers in
[39:21] church that's what we all do to these
[39:22] saints like brother william we all learn
[39:24] lessons from his life
[39:26] if you're struggling you can ask me but
[39:28] consider asking a saint like brother
[39:29] william or his wife beatrice praise god
[39:32] that had been through the battles before
[39:34] the bible said the gray head is wisdom
[39:37] amen
[39:38] you're not the only one who's gone
[39:40] through these battles he's going through
[39:42] it all these saints have gone through it
[39:44] and if we need help we ought to reach
[39:46] out to get some help praise god because
[39:48] god's got help here god's got some
[39:50] veteran soldiers here amen
[39:52] the bible said god doesn't give a new
[39:54] temptation everything you've gone
[39:56] through somebody else has already
[39:58] overcome amen
[40:00] and god will give you encouragement
[40:02] he'll give you the word that you need
[40:04] he'll give you the authority to overcome
[40:07] satan at every one of his tricks
[40:10] amen
[40:12] and let no man despise your youth either
[40:16] right
[40:18] the bible said if you're young be an
[40:19] example to all the other believers
[40:21] that's right
[40:22] hallelujah don't make an excuse well i'm
[40:25] young i can enjoy sin no
[40:27] crucify the lust of the flesh
[40:30] be an example for all of us to see
[40:32] because we all know the older ones are
[40:33] going to be an example thank god for
[40:34] them
[40:36] they proved that you you and i can make
[40:38] it if if if they go on as the lord
[40:40] tarries they've already proved we can
[40:42] make it too
[40:44] amen
[40:45] because there's no temptation
[40:47] what's going to be given the future
[40:49] except what they've already
[40:50] overcome praise god
[40:53] so don't lose hope church
[40:55] don't be discouraged god is with us
[40:58] god is not going to give us something we
[40:59] can't handle praise god
[41:02] no matter how young how old how
[41:04] insignificant you may feel don't feel
[41:06] insignificant that's the devil you have
[41:08] a significant place in this world you
[41:10] are going to make an impact on somebody
[41:12] and the impact is get them saved
[41:15] the impact is you spreading the word to
[41:17] them so they live eternally
[41:21] brother ram said in eternity after the
[41:23] new jerusalem i was hurt listening today
[41:24] he said we're going to walk around
[41:26] brother where he said we're going to
[41:27] take a short trip he said for 500 years
[41:30] that's right
[41:32] we made a little trip to jeffersonville
[41:33] a few years ago right a one-day trip
[41:36] but in that place church amen
[41:42] that new jerusalem will say okay i'm
[41:43] checking out for a little bit i'm gonna
[41:45] go on a little journey when you're gonna
[41:46] be back 500 years
[41:49] and brother man i said you'll be walking
[41:50] around the mountains and all these
[41:52] places he said pretty soon you run that
[41:53] sister the church i forget a name sister
[41:55] gertie or something he said oh they're
[41:56] sister gertie now she's not old like she
[41:58] was on earth she's young she's like 20
[42:00] years old
[42:01] brother mj how are you now
[42:03] 20.
[42:04] so he look at his baby's skin look at
[42:06] that
[42:07] no wrinkles
[42:08] do you have any white hair brother no of
[42:09] course not
[42:11] so he's at this perfect age that's what
[42:13] we're going to look like when we have
[42:15] eternal life
[42:16] praise god amen
[42:18] i'm twice your age i'm 40. this is what
[42:20] you look like when you get 40.
[42:21] unfortunately
[42:23] but he said will we walk around brother
[42:25] the mountains for a couple hundred years
[42:27] we'll run into a sister from the church
[42:28] and say oh sister gertie how you doing
[42:30] and brother said she'll be there
[42:33] petting a tiger
[42:35] just petting it
[42:36] and you'll walk up and say oh little
[42:38] tiger you'll pet the tiger and it'll
[42:40] purr like a
[42:42] kitten they'll say how you doing they'll
[42:45] lick your hand if you want to get a ride
[42:47] on it go ahead
[42:48] right
[42:50] what good thing is god going to withhold
[42:51] to them that love him
[42:54] and brother brahm said before
[42:57] you start thinking about what you want
[42:58] to do next before you have a need he
[42:59] talks about grapes he said before you
[43:02] call for the grapes god will already
[43:04] answer it amen
[43:06] you'll be hungry for some grapes and
[43:07] before you ask god you'll turn around oh
[43:09] there's the graves oh let's sit down and
[43:11] let's have some fellowship he said well
[43:13] just feast on the grapes amen
[43:16] and he said after about 500 years you'll
[43:18] go back
[43:19] he said and then you'll present yourself
[43:20] before the lord
[43:22] and they'll say how long have you been
[43:23] gone
[43:24] he said ten days he said i've been gone
[43:26] two thousand years
[43:28] it'll just go so fast church because as
[43:31] as awful as it is here the opposite is
[43:34] true there things get harder here we get
[43:36] worn out here but there things only get
[43:39] better praise god
[43:40] they only be able to get better and more
[43:42] young and more happy we just get better
[43:44] all the time amen
[43:46] it's the opposite of here
[43:49] and god gives us all these promised
[43:51] blessings
[43:53] the nations will be healed there'll be
[43:54] no more no more war between the nations

[44:00] wars
[44:02] china taiwan right
[44:04] north korea south korea there'll be no
[44:07] more wars because the bible said jesus
[44:09] is going to give fruits for the healing
[44:11] of the nations
[44:12] oh there's going to be no more battles
[44:14] like that there's going to be no more
[44:15] blood stains no more bloodshed it's all

[44:19] joy it's all going to be happiness and
[44:22] you can have that if you come to the
[44:23] light
[44:25] amen
[44:26] what promises we have as christians
[44:31] i just thought i'd lay that in i thought
[44:32] that was so beautiful he said i'm going
[44:33] to go for a journey i'll be back in 500
[44:35] years

[44:40] brother william
[44:41] an extra 1 500 years i was out there
[44:44] enjoying the mountains and enjoying
[44:46] god's nature and worshiping god and
[44:47] brother man said every night he said
[44:50] before the sun would go down or
[44:52] something he would say we'd all present
[44:53] ourselves before god and say papa god
[44:56] how are you tonight
[44:58] and the holy spirit will come down
[45:00] and talk with us we'll feel the sweet
[45:02] cool winds of the holy spirit i'll say

[45:06] in this eternal place
[45:08] thank you for saving a wretch like me i
[45:11] remember when i was lost but now i'm
[45:13] found we would have communion just like
[45:15] god came down with adam and eve amen in
[45:18] the cool of the evening jesus will come
[45:20] down and be with us every day because he
[45:22] loves us he died for us and the bible
[45:25] said for god so loved the world god so
[45:27] loved us he wants to spend eternity with
[45:30] us
[45:31] oh
[45:32] that's a reality that ain't no fantasy
[45:34] that's a reality
[45:36] he said behold i make all things new
[45:40] all things are going to be made new
[45:42] praise god
[45:44] if you don't get them here haven and
[45:45] karis are going to get your horses over
[45:46] there
[45:47] there's going to be whole mountains full
[45:49] of them
[45:50] and you can take as much time as you
[45:51] want
[45:53] and go chase one down and say hey
[45:54] sweetheart come here ah yeah go feed it
[45:57] you already have some fruit ready to
[45:58] feed it can we go on a little ride and
[46:01] maybe they'll be able to talk i don't
[46:02] know but you'll be able to get on there
[46:04] you'll have all the desires of your
[46:05] heart and just be praising jesus say oh
[46:07] this is so wonderful praise god i'm so
[46:09] full of the love of god
[46:12] eyes not seen ears not heard the things
[46:15] that god has in store for them that love
[46:17] him
[46:19] oh my praise god i just thought of you
[46:21] that really blessed me i was listening
[46:22] that on the way to church tonight so
[46:24] asher
[46:26] uh let's let's uh let's uh here
[46:29] i don't know if i can do that let's go
[46:31] i'll go to genesis 30 verse 12 and 13.
[46:33] let's look at asher he was uh one of the
[46:35] twelve sons of jacob genesis 30 12 and
[46:38] 13.
[46:49] and zilpah least made bearer jacob a
[46:51] second son and leah said happy am i for
[46:53] the daughters will call me blessed and
[46:55] she called his name
[46:57] asher
[46:58] so what does asher mean it just means
[47:00] happy
[47:01] leah was so happy that her mate had a
[47:03] baby
[47:04] and she said lord i'm happy i'm gonna
[47:06] name him asher because that means i'm
[47:08] happy she was happy to have children now
[47:11] today they don't want children right
[47:12] that's why they abort them
[47:13] right that's why they uh they'll take
[47:16] birth control pills they don't want them
[47:17] but in the bible days that was a huge
[47:19] blessing
[47:20] now if we made mistakes god gives us
[47:22] forgiveness praise god right there's
[47:24] forgiveness but there's also grace to
[47:27] know the truth and believe the truth and
[47:29] live the truth hallelujah
[47:31] children were a blessing then god said
[47:33] children are still blessing today praise
[47:35] god
[47:36] hallelujah now the prophecy of jacob was
[47:40] genesis 49 verse 20.
[47:42] first book of the bible
[47:44] chapter 49 verse 20.
[47:48] out of asher his bread shall be fat
[47:51] and he shall yield
[47:52] royal dainties
[47:56] okay so we've never really heard that
[47:58] fat bread right we never really heard
[48:00] about that
[48:01] but it just means that the bread will be
[48:03] the best bread you're going to ever want
[48:04] to find
[48:06] praise god this tribe this man was going
[48:08] to produce
[48:10] such bread and bread was a daily
[48:12] substance right
[48:13] that was a daily necessity you had to
[48:15] have bread at the table every day
[48:17] but this bread was just not going to be
[48:19] a regular bread it was going to be the
[48:20] best bread
[48:22] in other words they were going to pay
[48:23] such attention to detail
[48:25] the very simple things of life were
[48:27] going to be the very best things of life
[48:30] they weren't going to cut corners
[48:33] they were to make everything in life
[48:35] just a beautiful blessing they were the
[48:37] very best they could with whatever they
[48:39] had
[48:40] how many want to live like that
[48:42] we want to live the best we can with
[48:44] what god has given to us amen
[48:47] this was ashes
[48:48] and uh the next one and he shall yield
[48:51] royal dainties
[48:53] so there seems to be some connection
[48:55] with royalty now remember no kings came
[48:57] out of asher but they must have been a
[48:59] bunch of chefs praise god
[49:01] and they would make the finest foods for
[49:03] royalty
[49:05] right remember king saul said if i
[49:06] become king i'm taking your daughters to
[49:09] cook for me
[49:10] where do they get where to get all these
[49:12] good uh menus where they got these good
[49:14] recipes from asher's tribe
[49:17] history says their children were the
[49:19] most beautiful children
[49:20] their children knew the most about food
[49:23] see we've heard about all these warriors
[49:25] right that can catch arrows and
[49:27] all these strong tribes but here's one
[49:29] that they focused on the food
[49:32] they were gifted in the area of service
[49:34] food service
[49:35] and by the holy spirit god looked at
[49:37] them and said they're going to make the
[49:39] bread fat and they're going to do royal
[49:40] dainties they're going to be such
[49:42] wonderful servants unto the kings in
[49:44] queens
[49:46] see because god needs everybody needs a
[49:48] place
[49:49] right we all got to have a place we all
[49:51] can't be kings right
[49:53] we all can't be president
[49:55] we all can't be mayor we all can't be
[49:57] pastor right
[49:59] we all can't be the
[50:00] the top person but god has a special
[50:03] place and god was really going to honor
[50:05] asher because what they were called to
[50:07] do they did it well
[50:10] church how many want to do well what
[50:12] god's called you to do
[50:14] does anybody want to do an average job
[50:15] for god well i just i just did what i
[50:18] had to do to get by
[50:20] or do you want to specialize in it
[50:22] i don't want to preach average
[50:24] sermons i want to preach sermons that
[50:27] change people's lives amen that's why i
[50:30] study that's why i pray that's why i
[50:31] preach as much as i do because i want to
[50:33] see it beautiful i want to see it beyond
[50:36] just what you'd hear at a regular church
[50:38] i want to see the holy spirit give
[50:39] people this fat bread amen hallelujah
[50:43] this wonderful sermon where they can eat
[50:45] here they can feast on the word of god
[50:47] it's royal food it's royal food for the
[50:50] priesthood of god amen
[50:52] hallelujah praise god it's not just a
[50:55] common i've heard that sermon before but
[50:57] you're going to hear something new it's
[50:59] going to be so rich amen it's going to
[51:01] be so good you're going to enjoy it
[51:03] you're going to know this is a special
[51:05] word of god
[51:06] that's how i want to live as a preacher
[51:07] now how about you
[51:10] as a father as a grandfather
[51:13] as a worker on your job what kind of
[51:15] servant are you going to be for christ
[51:17] are you an average worker how about our
[51:19] students we got a lot of young kids what
[51:21] kind of student you want to be you want
[51:22] to be a c student
[51:23] now that's all your ability wonderful
[51:25] that that's all god's given you because
[51:27] not everybody has academic skill like
[51:29] that
[51:30] some people more have more music skill
[51:32] right or artistic skill or singing or
[51:34] all these other talents that they have
[51:37] but in other words how do we want to
[51:39] serve god do you want to have a just
[51:41] common everyday kind of christian thing
[51:43] or do you want to be someone who really
[51:45] does well what god's called them to do
[51:47] how do you want to do well
[51:50] see here's what we see he would be
[51:52] linked to food his ministry was in food
[51:55] ministry
[51:56] now notice church
[51:58] where does he live by he lives right by
[52:00] the
[52:01] sea
[52:02] right by the sea
[52:04] so that that gives him what fish
[52:07] all kinds of uh seafood dishes
[52:11] so he's got bread he's got royal
[52:13] dainties things that these other guys
[52:15] that you know they don't live by the big
[52:17] ocean or the big sea they don't get any
[52:19] of that they have such dainties they
[52:21] have special foods that the other ones
[52:24] don't give
[52:26] and god called them to that
[52:28] right
[52:30] remember we saw that some of these
[52:31] warriors remember uh some of these other
[52:33] warriors
[52:35] remember god was going to have all these
[52:36] wars well look do they live by the ocean
[52:38] no
[52:39] they weren't called to do that
[52:41] church god has called you to do
[52:43] something that only many times only you
[52:45] know what it is
[52:47] and whatever you do the bible says do it
[52:49] with all your heart that's how it's

[53:38] this down to close give me about maybe
[53:39] 10 more minutes

[53:53] and 25. sorry about that brother it was
[53:54] the same one we read tonight but we're
[53:56] finally getting back to that
[54:00] and of asher so this is moses
[54:03] years after the previous one uh genesis
[54:05] 49 was uh uh asher's dad jacob well here
[54:08] now we're at moses after asher died and
[54:10] now his his his descendants here are
[54:12] getting prophecy
[54:15] uh verse 24. and if ashley said let
[54:18] asher be blessed with children let him
[54:19] be acceptable to his brethren let him
[54:21] dip his foot in oil
[54:25] thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as
[54:27] thy days so shall thy strength be
[54:30] church i don't know about you
[54:33] but did anybody hear anything negative
[54:35] in that prophecy
[54:38] by the way and there's some people
[54:39] hallelujah
[54:41] god's going to have prophecy about their
[54:43] lives and it's all blessings
[54:45] and that's not because god likes them
[54:47] more it's because god knows they're
[54:49] going to be faithful with what he gives
[54:51] them and when they're faithful with the
[54:52] little god will bless them with more
[54:54] praise god
[54:56] nothing evil said about asher
[54:58] he's the youngest of leah you know kind
[55:00] of despised not the favorite you know
[55:02] wife different side of the family
[55:05] but god has all these blessings on asher
[55:08] he's going to do fat bread amen he's
[55:10] going to do royal dainties he's going to
[55:13] be blessed with children while other
[55:15] tribes maybe have lots of miscarriages
[55:18] asher's going to have a bunch of
[55:20] children
[55:21] and the bible said children are arrows
[55:23] of the lord
[55:25] that defeat the enemies
[55:27] praise god your children are your
[55:29] weapons praise god hallelujah they're
[55:32] weapons that take down the kingdom of
[55:33] satan
[55:34] and raise up the kingdom of god amen
[55:37] that's why you sharpen your arrows
[55:38] praise god
[55:40] that's why you make sure they're ready
[55:41] to go praise god so when you shoot them
[55:43] out when they're 16 or 17 or 18 they
[55:45] really hit the target and they can do
[55:47] some damage in the kingdom of
[55:49] the kingdom of satan like my mom my mom
[55:51] drugged my mom dragged six all six of
[55:53] her kids to church every sunday and now
[55:55] when she shot them out now three of them
[55:57] are preachers
[55:58] and they're tearing down satan's kingdom
[56:01] praise god amen the arrows have been
[56:03] shot out and they're hitting the target
[56:05] amen
[56:07] where people are being saved forgiven
[56:09] filled with the holy ghost baptized in
[56:11] jesus christ's day because one mother
[56:14] sharpened the arrows amen
[56:16] she saw her arrows as a blessing and not
[56:18] a curse
[56:22] not only that he's going to be
[56:23] acceptable his brethren are going to
[56:25] just he they're just going to love him
[56:27] i'm so glad you're my brother you're
[56:29] just a blessing to me my when i when i
[56:31] was down you were right where right
[56:33] there right when i needed you you were a
[56:35] brother you helped me out of debt right
[56:37] you picked me up when i needed to be
[56:38] picked up you were just right there
[56:40] thanks for being a brother that's what
[56:42] he's going to be he's going to be
[56:43] acceptable to his brethren
[56:46] so everybody in the family is going to
[56:47] love this guy
[56:50] he's got all the blessings he's got the
[56:51] food he's skilled in his food he
[56:54] prepares it he takes special time he's
[56:55] really focused on his ministry amen
[56:58] hallelujah praise god and he's really
[57:00] good to his siblings
[57:02] and he's blessed with a large family oh
[57:05] hallelujah
[57:06] thank god amen and then he dips his foot
[57:09] in oil
[57:10] now this is a natural
[57:12] but i see a spiritual
[57:14] i don't know in other words that olive
[57:16] trees right that's how you get olive oil
[57:18] olive trees you got to pick the olives
[57:20] go step on them and out of the bat comes
[57:23] olive oil
[57:24] so he would have his foot in oil
[57:28] remember when jesus was here on earth
[57:30] and he came into simon the pharisee's
[57:32] house and they didn't they didn't wash
[57:34] his feet with oil
[57:35] they didn't anoint his head with oil
[57:38] but not asher's house asher's house was
[57:40] gonna have his foot dipped in oil in
[57:42] other words he was gonna be clean
[57:44] amen
[57:45] hallelujah he had oil he would all the
[57:48] sweat was gonna be gone all the dirt was
[57:49] gonna be gone he was presenting himself
[57:52] like he was royalty praise god amen he
[57:54] wasn't but he was presenting himself
[57:56] like he was he was cleaned up you can
[57:59] tell the blessing of god was upon his
[58:01] life amen
[58:04] hallelujah
[58:06] now what does this mean for us it means
[58:08] for us yes we want to have clean clothes
[58:10] yes we want to take a shower and brush
[58:11] our stinky teeth in the morning yes we
[58:13] want to do that but this means our foot
[58:15] is in oil this means we're blessed and
[58:18] our lives are are dipped into the holy
[58:21] spirit praise god
[58:22] we have the holy spirit flowing here and
[58:25] what is it doing it's healing it's
[58:27] saving it's forgiving it's leading it's
[58:29] guiding it's placing praise god
[58:32] it's giving you a place in the body of
[58:34] christ you've got your foot in it you're
[58:36] standing in it praise god church we're
[58:38] standing in the blessing of god tonight
[58:41] hallelujah we're standing in his
[58:43] blessings he had his foot dipped in oil
[58:45] praise god in other words we're gonna
[58:47] wash jesus's feet we're gonna anoint
[58:50] jesus feet with her head with oil praise
[58:52] god we're gonna have the holy spirit
[58:54] amongst us praise god hallelujah
[58:58] his shoes will be iron and brass
[59:01] so in other words this this land right
[59:04] by the sea it would have oil olive trees
[59:07] he'd have bread he'd have fish he'd have
[59:08] royal dainties he had all these
[59:10] blessings of life plus
[59:12] when he started digging the ground he'd
[59:14] come across precious metals
[59:17] and then he'd take those and he could
[59:18] sell him whoever he wants no doubt the
[59:20] guys that were doing swords right
[59:22] because these guys weren't the big
[59:23] warriors right
[59:25] but they had they found all these medals
[59:27] under there and they say praise god now
[59:29] we got these and we're just they're
[59:31] under our feet praise god the blessings
[59:34] ah the blessings are above us the
[59:36] blessings are around us and the
[59:37] blessings are under us in other words
[59:39] we're surrounded by the blessings of god
[59:42] amen
[59:43] everywhere i will look there's blessings
[59:45] in my life i look at my family i look at
[59:48] my job i look at my bank account now
[59:50] that's not for everybody all the time we
[59:51] go through trials but everywhere asher
[59:54] looked there was blessings amen
[59:56] hallelujah because he loved the lord he
[59:59] kept the word the bible said if you obey
[1:00:01] the word you're blessed the bible says
[1:00:03] if you break the word your curse let us
[1:00:06] obey the word and be blessed hallelujah
[1:00:10] i'm not talking about being millionaires
[1:00:11] and not nonsense like that remember
[1:00:13] solomon the wisest man ever
[1:00:17] he said lord don't make me poor that i
[1:00:19] steal
[1:00:20] but don't make me rich that i forget
[1:00:22] about you
[1:00:24] so if you've got just that in between
[1:00:26] you ought to shout hallelujah tonight
[1:00:29] hallelujah
[1:00:30] praise god amen
[1:00:32] i don't have too much that i think well
[1:00:34] now i can figure it out now i'm good at
[1:00:36] uh investments now i'm good at at
[1:00:37] bitcoin right or now i'm good at the
[1:00:39] stock market no no no well i ain't good
[1:00:41] at nothing it's all jesus amen
[1:00:44] i want what god has for me i don't want
[1:00:47] to be rich i don't want to be poor i
[1:00:48] want to be blessed i want to do what
[1:00:50] god's called me to do
[1:00:56] like before i wrote this book and sister
[1:00:58] uh you're welcome to have one for free
[1:00:59] if you want if you're a reader if not
[1:01:01] the audiobook's free online
[1:01:04] but before i wrote this i said lord i
[1:01:05] have a burden to share that the mystery
[1:01:07] of god is finished
[1:01:09] i didn't know how much it was going to
[1:01:10] cost
[1:01:11] but then a few years later people
[1:01:12] started sending me money just for the
[1:01:13] book to make it
[1:01:16] i got 6 800 in the mail and i didn't ask
[1:01:19] for one penny
[1:01:22] see because when god wants to do
[1:01:23] something he's going to send you the
[1:01:24] blessing
[1:01:25] you're going to find some under you
[1:01:27] you're going to find some above you
[1:01:28] you're going to find it there you're
[1:01:30] going to find it here and there why
[1:01:32] because you're walking in the obedience
[1:01:34] of god and you're unit to god and god is
[1:01:36] going to use you because you're an
[1:01:38] example you're walking in the light
[1:01:40] praise god
[1:01:43] you're not in darkness you're walking
[1:01:45] the light praise god
[1:01:47] so this church didn't pay one ascent for
[1:01:49] that six thousand eight hundred dollars
[1:01:51] that it costs to make that book
[1:01:53] because when god wants to do something
[1:01:55] oh the blessings are coming
[1:01:56] the bible says they chase you down
[1:01:58] they're going to they're just going to
[1:01:59] come and chase you down all the
[1:02:01] blessings are going to come looking for
[1:02:02] you when you honor jesus christ and you
[1:02:05] obey his word and when you really love
[1:02:07] him he said you'll keep my commands amen
[1:02:10] hallelujah
[1:02:11] and then the blessings of god will
[1:02:13] shower down upon you
[1:02:16] or like when we have a sick man like
[1:02:17] jose had glaucoma he's not here tonight
[1:02:19] he's a spanish brother from nicaragua
[1:02:21] he had glaucoma and he come up crying
[1:02:23] here back in january or was it february
[1:02:27] he said brother they said i got glaucoma
[1:02:28] i'm gonna lose my eyesight he don't have
[1:02:30] insurance
[1:02:31] sounds like a pretty bad deal doesn't it
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:33] but i was just preaching on blessings
[1:02:35] and curses at the end of 2020.
[1:02:38] and i called brother johnny up i think i
[1:02:40] called brother amen up and i said let's
[1:02:42] pray let's rebuke this glaucoma in jesus
[1:02:44] christ's name
[1:02:45] so we prayed the prayer of faith we
[1:02:47] anointed with oil we're crying we're
[1:02:48] praising god saying god please heal him
[1:02:50] god have your will he went to the doctor
[1:02:52] a month later and they said we don't
[1:02:54] know what happened in the machines we
[1:02:55] don't know what happened on all the
[1:02:56] records but you don't have glaucoma
[1:02:59] praise god
[1:03:00] that's a blessing for being in the
[1:03:02] commands of god for obeying god we love
[1:03:05] jesus so we keep his commands amen
[1:03:08] that's one of the blessings
[1:03:10] of being a lover of jesus christ
[1:03:13] and loving the light and hating the
[1:03:15] darkness
[1:03:18] remember when johnny you guys remember
[1:03:19] when johnny walked in here his ankle
[1:03:21] church there's my ankle his ankle was
[1:03:23] about three times that size
[1:03:26] and he said he'd been taking all these
[1:03:27] things and it wasn't working
[1:03:29] but i preached some little message i
[1:03:30] think it was on joshua and he come up
[1:03:32] after service he said brother i know if
[1:03:34] you curse this i'm going to be healed
[1:03:37] curse that infection and i know i'm
[1:03:39] going to be healed now at that point i
[1:03:40] was a little nervous
[1:03:42] you know because he had more faith than
[1:03:43] i did but i didn't look at my faith
[1:03:45] church i looked at the word of god
[1:03:47] because it's not about my faith it's
[1:03:49] about his faith
[1:03:51] all we have to do is obey the word of
[1:03:52] god so i prayed i touched that ankle and
[1:03:55] i said i rebuked that infection in jesus
[1:03:58] christ's name and may our brother be
[1:03:59] healed he said he walked back to his
[1:04:01] seat right back here it was either one
[1:04:03] of these right here and he said while he
[1:04:04] was standing praying he could feel the
[1:04:06] healing taking place and the next day he
[1:04:09] said it was 95 healed on a monday
[1:04:12] morning praise god by the end of the
[1:04:14] week it was back to normal what is that
[1:04:16] that's the power of christ amen
[1:04:19] that's the blessing of jesus christ why
[1:04:21] because we walk in the light we keep his
[1:04:23] commands and all these blessings will be
[1:04:25] around us and lastly let's send to our
[1:04:27] faith lastly he said i'll give you
[1:04:29] strength according to thy days
[1:04:33] in other words church you and i have a
[1:04:35] certain number of days
[1:04:38] god is the only one who knows that
[1:04:40] number
[1:04:42] but because asher was going to be so
[1:04:44] faithful his children were going to be
[1:04:45] blessed he's going to make the most
[1:04:47] delicious bread he's going to have royal
[1:04:49] dainties seafoods
[1:04:51] that only fit for the king he's going to
[1:04:54] have children all around him his
[1:04:56] brothers and sisters are going to love
[1:04:57] him he's going to be a family man
[1:05:00] ah hallelujah don't you see yourself in
[1:05:03] some of these churches
[1:05:05] your brothers sisters might not even be
[1:05:06] believers but somehow they love you amen
[1:05:09] hallelujah
[1:05:10] because you've got the blessing of god
[1:05:12] on your life praise god god and church
[1:05:15] is not that you necessarily you did it
[1:05:17] it's god called you to it praise god god
[1:05:19] wanted you to do that and god gave you
[1:05:21] strength to do it and the bible says
[1:05:23] this last thing
[1:05:25] he says you'll have strength according
[1:05:27] to thy days in other words god says i
[1:05:30] know the exact numbers of days jesse has
[1:05:33] and because i know this number i'm going
[1:05:35] to give him strength to
[1:05:37] glorify me in every single day all the
[1:05:40] years of his life
[1:05:42] sound familiar
[1:05:43] caleb said i'm 85 and i'm just as strong
[1:05:46] when i was 45.
[1:05:48] he said come give me that mountain come
[1:05:50] on giants come over here i'm ready to
[1:05:51] whip you now amen i'm just as strong as
[1:05:54] i was at 85. john wesley was 88 years
[1:05:57] old and he said i'm just as strong as i
[1:06:00] was when i was 40 praise god
[1:06:03] all because he loved jesus christ
[1:06:07] all because he kept the commands of god
[1:06:10] i don't plan on getting weaker
[1:06:13] i might get more gray hair sister but i
[1:06:15] ain't going to get weaker
[1:06:16] i'm only going to get stronger
[1:06:18] praise god that's that's my confession
[1:06:21] i've got to take care of myself i got to
[1:06:23] do my part
[1:06:24] if i sin i'm going to get cursed
[1:06:26] it's going to be a temporary curse not
[1:06:28] an eternal curse
[1:06:29] but there's temporary uh there's
[1:06:31] temporary consequences to decisions
[1:06:34] that doesn't mean i'm lost
[1:06:37] but there are consequences but if i obey
[1:06:38] the word and i daily stay in the light
[1:06:41] i'm gonna stay in your life jesus i'm
[1:06:43] gonna find the
[1:06:44] i'm gonna stay in your life forgive me
[1:06:46] god empower me today let me let my foot
[1:06:48] be an oil let my brother love me let me
[1:06:51] love my children let there be brass and
[1:06:53] iron under my feet just give me
[1:06:55] everything i need as long as i'm walking

[1:06:58] bible says the blood of jesus christ
[1:07:00] will cleanse me from all unrighteousness
[1:07:04] and he can give me strength for each day
[1:07:07] about 15 no about 10 years ago we had a
[1:07:10] guy visit our other church when naomi

[1:07:17] screaming he said let me tell you you're
[1:07:19] wrong he said if you keep preaching like
[1:07:21] that you're gonna burn out in one year
[1:07:24] and i said sir i've already been
[1:07:25] preaching like this for seven years and

[1:07:30] years of preaching i haven't lost one
