[33:07] really good reports you know Simon being

[33:10] and everything I listened to the evening
[33:13] service I think it a chance I didn't

[33:16] the morning but really enjoy the evening
[33:18] service has a tremendous blessing a
[33:20] great word there nice warning as well
[33:23] some really nice revelations there about
[33:26] the Nicolaitans spirit and also how to
[33:28] keep the right spear praise God that was
[33:30] really wonderful
[33:31] thank the Lord for that message that was
[33:33] a wonderful message even malachi was
[33:36] telling me about he's like daddy you got

[33:39] mess i don't praise the lord son thank
[33:42] you sir matthew 13 11 let's read verse
[33:50] 11 together I know I don't do not have
[33:52] any quotes tonight so I apologize about
[33:53] that I went back to work this week so I
[33:55] had a lot less time to study but I said
[33:58] got to study a lot over the weekend you
[33:59] know flying to Iowan back I had quite a
[34:01] bit of study time so I thank the Lord
[34:02] for that Matthew 13 11
[34:04] let's read just verse 11 on three one
[34:07] two three he answered and said unto them
[34:11] because it is given unto you to know the
[34:14] mystery
[34:15] kingdom of heaven but to them it is not
[34:18] given now verse 12 I'll read for
[34:22] whosoever hath to him shall be given and
[34:25] he shall have more abundance but who
[34:28] suffer hath not from him shall be taken
[34:31] away even that he hath now go to Matthew
[34:36] 25:14 now while we're turning there I
[34:50] just had a scripture come to my mind I'm
[34:51] just typing in real quick so I'm gonna
[34:53] find it ok now the 25 will just read but
[35:02] I'll just read 14 and 15 for the kingdom
[35:04] of heaven is as a man travelling into a
[35:06] far country who called his own servants
[35:09] and delivered unto them his Goods and
[35:12] until one he gave five talents to
[35:16] another two to another one to every man
[35:20] according to his several ability and
[35:22] straightway took his journey let's have
[35:26] a word of Prayer if you ever need on
[35:27] your heart let's just make it known unto
[35:28] God maybe raise your hand to heaven or
[35:30] bow your head to the earth Heavenly
[35:32] Father we love you tonight we're happy
[35:34] to be assembled Lord this is how we
[35:36] overcome the devil Lord God by coming to
[35:38] hear the preaching Lord cuz we know when
[35:40] we hear and believe the word it becomes
[35:42] a revelation and the gates of Hell will
[35:44] not prevail against the revelation of
[35:47] your word we're so happy what we receive
[35:49] tonight will never be taken from us Lord
[35:52] God it's an eternal deposit of the
[35:55] Almighty God Lord depositing his word
[35:57] his very life into our hearts minds and
[36:00] ultimately our character we thank you
[36:02] Lord bless your saints that pressed our
[36:04] way out to the house of God bless every
[36:06] effort Lord especially the mother's Lord
[36:08] bringing the children Lord God and those
[36:10] travelling far distances Lord and we
[36:13] just thank you for all the sacrifices
[36:15] minister to every need Lord God and I've
[36:18] known in my life the greater the
[36:19] sacrifice the greater blessing so father
[36:21] we just cling to your promise your
[36:24] Jehovah Jireh just provide every need
[36:26] tonight we'll give you the glory in
[36:28] Jesus Christ's name
[36:29] in Saint said Amen god bless you as you
[36:32] being seated there praise the Lord so I
[36:37] was reading the scripture here in
[36:43] Matthew 13 about the the kingdom of
[36:46] heaven verse 11 the scripture says it's
[36:52] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[36:56] the kingdom of heaven but to them it's
[36:58] not given so I want to just take a
[37:03] thought just just briefly look at this
[37:06] you know if you if you know the
[37:07] scripture here in verse 10 Jesus is
[37:10] speaking to his disciples so this is a
[37:13] private conversation amongst Christ and
[37:17] the twelve because they came and said
[37:19] why do you speak unto them in parables
[37:21] and back Lidia back to verse 11 please
[37:24] huh
[37:24] and I remember the scripture I was
[37:26] looking for here okay yes there's I've
[37:41] to find in a minute here but we see here
[37:43] this thought it's given unto you so the
[37:47] disciples were predestinated to know the
[37:50] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[37:53] to them it is not given now remember
[37:56] this is a beautiful Scripture as shows
[37:58] election right and predestination but
[38:00] memmer don't forget foreknowledge God
[38:03] foreknew the disciples would want to
[38:05] hear it
[38:06] right even Judas wanted to hear at the
[38:08] beginning but he didn't go all the way
[38:10] at the end the Bible said he trotted
[38:14] underfoot the Son of Man and he smashed
[38:16] it with his foot and he left the Bible
[38:19] said he was sanctified but then he left
[38:21] the holy thing for the unholy thing in
[38:24] other words he was climbing the king's
[38:25] highway and he fell off but the Bible
[38:28] said but to them it is not given okay
[38:32] now this is the thought here I had in my
[38:34] heart here that that it's not as if God
[38:38] is just hiding it from him because he
[38:40] doesn't want it because he doesn't care
[38:42] about them
[38:43] you know the scripture I've been
[38:44] preaching it lately where God doesn't
[38:46] delight in the death of the wicked it's
[38:48] because of God's long-suffering and his
[38:51] love that he lets the time go on he's
[38:54] trying to save more Souls we know that
[38:56] and the scripture I'm looking up and
[38:58] maybe he can help me the Bible said Oh
[39:01] is a lack of knowledge that's the word
[39:03] lack yeah let's go to Hosea 4:6 sorry
[39:06] this is this kind of came to me right
[39:08] now so I just wanna look it up real
[39:09] quick
[39:10] Hosea 4:6 and keep in mind as we read
[39:14] this keep in mind where Jesus said it's
[39:16] not given to them because we want to
[39:21] understand this a lot of people read
[39:23] this first part to the the colon there
[39:26] and they stopped okay so let's look at
[39:30] this my people are destroyed for lack of
[39:32] knowledge so churches will use that and
[39:34] say so see they never heard before
[39:36] but that's not exactly what the
[39:38] scripture is saying the scripture saying
[39:41] my people are destroyed for lack of
[39:42] knowledge because thou has rejected
[39:45] knowledge so that the the truth is
[39:49] Israel had heard the knowledge of God
[39:52] but they lacked the ability to obey it
[39:57] amen and so when Jesus says and keep it
[40:00] up they're little because we're gonna
[40:01] read the rest when Jesus said it to you
[40:03] it's given to them it's not given it
[40:06] wasn't as if Jesus was saying well you
[40:08] know they're not gonna hear it no they
[40:10] did hear it they just didn't want to
[40:12] believe it
[40:12] amen and that's what makes people
[40:15] accountable alright that's what makes
[40:18] the entire world accountable they'll
[40:20] hear about Christ
[40:21] they'll hear God sent a prophet they'll
[40:23] hear about miracles there he'll about
[40:25] here about revelations and they'll hear
[40:27] about the end times and the rapture
[40:29] right everybody hears about it the
[40:31] tribulation everybody knows about the
[40:32] tribulation almost everybody knows about
[40:34] it but see the reason they're destroyed
[40:38] is because they lack the knowledge in
[40:40] other words they rejected it when they
[40:42] heard it they turned it down and Jesus
[40:45] said it's like a seed that fell on the
[40:47] stony ground right it springs up for a
[40:50] while maybe they're interested but then
[40:51] a but then it gets it gets burned out by
[40:54] the Sun or maybe it falls on the side
[40:57] to the road and a bird comes up and eats
[40:59] the seed and Jesus said that Satan
[41:02] snatching the word out of their hearts
[41:04] amen
[41:05] he said because you rejected an ouch
[41:09] I'll also reject V that thou shalt be no
[41:12] priest to me seeing thou has forgotten
[41:15] the law so not only was it just
[41:18] rejection but they so much they so much
[41:22] rejected they forgot about it see I also
[41:26] forget thy children I what a striking
[41:29] thing nothing could hurt the Jews more
[41:31] than when God forsook their children but
[41:33] they were so Baxton and they didn't even
[41:35] realize well they didn't realize the
[41:37] judgment that were gonna come upon him
[41:39] and it would hurt their children so I
[41:41] hope that I hope this balances it out by
[41:43] God's grace I want I want to balance
[41:45] that out and make sure you understand
[41:47] that because it's something that was
[41:50] quickened to me recently I'd forgotten
[41:52] about that because I hear people say
[41:54] well we're destroyed for the lack of
[41:55] knowledge with either we don't know we
[41:57] don't know but that's not what God's
[41:58] saying God's saying you had a chance but
[42:00] you didn't act on it and so that brings
[42:03] responsibility to you and I that because
[42:05] we hear the message Church I hope
[42:07] everybody's listen on a live stream too
[42:08] because we've heard the message that
[42:11] means we're more responsible praise God
[42:13] that means we got to be more diligent
[42:15] with the things of God but what happens
[42:18] as I travel and I'm not this time aiiow
[42:20] what about travel to numerous places
[42:21] over the course of the last few years
[42:23] what I see amongst message people is
[42:26] they hear it but then they get
[42:28] complacent on God brother branham makes
[42:31] the statement I can't remember the
[42:33] sermon it's in but he says a log in the
[42:37] river rots twice as quickly as a row or
[42:41] as a log that's not in the river how
[42:43] many know what I'm talking about
[42:45] he said if you throw a piece of wood in
[42:47] the river you know right out faster
[42:49] because it's in the fresh water right
[42:51] the moving water if you just leave a log
[42:53] on the ground it's not gonna ride out as
[42:55] quickly and program said that's the date
[42:58] all right that's the that's the nothing
[43:00] danger but that's I guess it is the
[43:01] danger for the unbeliever that is the
[43:03] danger for the unbeliever who doesn't
[43:05] stay obedient and responsible with the
[43:08] Word of God
[43:09] praise God
[43:11] and so we have a greater responsibility
[43:13] as I travel more and more the last few
[43:15] years and see what I see I see more of
[43:18] that I see a lot of people that are wood
[43:21] chopped out but they're just rotting in
[43:23] the water
[43:24] but you and I can't rot we don't want to
[43:27] rot in the message we want to stay
[43:29] attached to the tree that's planted by
[43:31] rivers alone or amen but what happens is
[43:34] that people get complacent and they get
[43:36] read because they reject God's knowledge
[43:38] God in a sense kind of cuts them off
[43:41] we'd say now I'm not saying eternally
[43:44] cuts them off what I'm saying is like
[43:46] that message I preached a few years ago
[43:48] about the waters of separation Israel
[43:52] was a privileged people but if they let
[43:55] something die in their tents they were
[43:57] cut off from worship remember that
[43:59] nothing from numbers 19 if something
[44:02] died they had to wait three days after
[44:04] being sprinkled and then to wait four
[44:06] more days for a total of seven days
[44:08] before they could be purified and then
[44:11] after the seventh day they could go back
[44:13] to the house of God and worship but if
[44:15] they got lazy ungodly might lay out of
[44:17] church for a few weeks
[44:18] right they may it late they might lay
[44:21] out for a few months
[44:22] praise praise God no not a good thing
[44:24] but to help us with our understanding
[44:27] and so we understand that we've got to
[44:30] be responsible and that's what a lot of
[44:34] people who run away from in the message
[44:35] they don't want any responsibility they
[44:38] just want the pastor to do it or the
[44:39] deacon or the psalm leader or something
[44:42] like that but like brother BAM said God
[44:44] wants to be in the entire laity he's the
[44:46] God of the entire church not just the
[44:48] pulpit he wants the pulpit he wants the
[44:51] musicians he wants a deacon he wants
[44:53] that but he wants everybody praise God
[44:56] amen he wants to be feared by all the
[44:59] saints amen
[45:01] now if we could let's now let me take a
[45:07] pause remember a few weeks ago and I
[45:10] preached our time and seasons I think it
[45:11] was when Ray was here I remember when I
[45:13] showed the quotes about brother Branham
[45:14] when it was a time for him to be silent
[45:15] and his wife to him just be quiet
[45:19] I and then remember he had a vision
[45:21] after that and I told you I said I
[45:23] wonder what
[45:23] vision was I forgot to read that let me
[45:25] go back and read it to you because I did
[45:26] some research to dig it up I think
[45:28] you'll like it by God's grace so program
[45:31] he had a fever nine days and he missed
[45:34] all the meetings and he could hardly
[45:36] talk he's whispering and he sat down to
[45:39] meet emotion or over and said Mita
[45:41] sometimes I wonder I wonder what's the
[45:44] matter why would their meetings be there
[45:46] and God let me lay like this I said why
[45:48] was it I said sometimes I wonder if he
[45:51] even called me how many member now that
[45:53] I've read how many remember now so
[45:56] brother may have says I wonder if God's
[45:58] even called me to preach and this is a
[46:01] what years as 1960 April 1960 and Meeta
[46:08] said ain't you ashamed of yourself
[46:12] she just told me bill don't you know
[46:15] that God knows what he's doing with you
[46:17] just just be quiet so see this was a
[46:22] season for brother Branham to be quiet
[46:25] and not complain right and that question
[46:29] did God even called me to preach right
[46:32] you know already a picture taken with a
[46:33] pillar of fire you know it had
[46:35] tremendous meetings in India where half
[46:37] a million or thought well I'm sorry
[46:38] three thousand three hundred thousand
[46:40] people got saved or healed and then
[46:42] overall at this time I believe he had
[46:44] over half a million commerce to Christ
[46:46] already and then he's asking because of
[46:48] nine days of fever lord have even called
[46:51] me to preach how many can how many can
[46:53] relate to brother Branham and say
[46:55] sometimes in your darkest hours
[46:56] sometimes it gets it gets hard how many
[46:59] could say Amen now brother banner has a
[47:02] vision I'm gonna skip the vision because
[47:03] I'm gonna go to the interpretation to
[47:06] save time but Ram said I looked after he
[47:08] saw vision he said I looked and I seen
[47:10] something make a flicker over to one
[47:11] side I looked and there my wall opened
[47:14] up and I seen Jesus how many ever heard
[47:17] me say
[47:20] twice in my life in a vision I believed
[47:23] I would see him again before the end
[47:24] time seemed again and now I looked and
[47:27] the skies was right out there and I just
[47:28] looked like I looked through the wall
[47:30] and there was the Bible standing right
[47:32] like this the great big Bible standing
[47:34] in the skies there was something got
[47:36] light around the Bible and now the Bible
[47:38] come a real pretty golden cross and it
[47:40] stood out like this and the lights
[47:41] coming from all around it and out of
[47:43] that cross he walked so Jesus came out
[47:46] of the cross which came out of the Bible
[47:49] I like that the Holy Ghost come out of
[47:52] the word amen glory he said the Bible
[47:58] reflected the cross the cross reflected
[48:00] him and he come walking out and walked
[48:03] right down to eyes at I can see it just
[48:05] as plain I can see that cross reflecting
[48:07] his hair standing there hung down over
[48:10] his face he looked down at me like that
[48:14] he said you are waiting for your new
[48:17] ministry to be confirmed to you that was
[48:19] speaking the word or opening the seals
[48:21] the third bolt
[48:23] he said I've already confirmed it to you
[48:26] memory smoke squirrel six squirrels in
[48:27] existence had he who right had been
[48:31] spoken had given the spoken word it's
[48:34] already confirmed you've got to accept
[48:36] it he says and I sort of listen to him
[48:39] just a minute and it come into my mind I
[48:41] didn't hear that it just come into my
[48:43] mind like a man that's been a sinner all
[48:46] his life and he knows there's a Bible he
[48:48] knows there's a God but all at once he
[48:50] hears a sermon that something tells him
[48:51] it's you then that same word has been
[48:54] there all the time yet it's confirmed to
[48:56] him and then he says Lord forgive me but
[48:59] it won't do any good until he accepts
[49:01] his salvation then he goes out and is a
[49:04] Christian no matter how much he cries
[49:06] how much he begs he's got to accept it
[49:09] and he said to me Jesus said you've got
[49:14] to accept the third Pole the same way
[49:16] you've got to believe it
[49:18] Church I just wonder you know as we go
[49:21] along I wonder at what point we're gonna
[49:23] accept the the plan of God for our lives
[49:25] maybe you have already I'm just saying
[49:28] if you haven't
[49:29] there's got to come a time when you and
[49:30] I accept it there had to come a time
[49:33] when I accept
[49:34] the fact I'm a preacher I'm accepted the
[49:36] fact I'm a pastor I accepted the fact
[49:38] I'm a teacher I accepted the fact God
[49:41] heals the sick sometimes when I pray for
[49:42] them we've all got to come and accept
[49:44] the fact that God has a ministry for our
[49:47] lives and that we're willing to do it if
[49:49] he'll help us amen
[49:51] well the RAM said I'm afraid of defeat
[49:54] so look at him he's so honest he tells
[49:56] the people I'm scared of being defeated
[49:58] in the third poll can you imagine that
[50:01] God has another ministry form but he's
[50:04] scared to go into it I think that's
[50:08] pretty common right we know God has
[50:13] special gifts in our life but we're
[50:15] afraid to operate in them well tha have
[50:20] said anything I'm afraid I'll bring a
[50:23] reproach I'm always afraid of it
[50:25] watching think I'll call the wrong thing
[50:27] because I took warning of the Bible how
[50:30] that Moses was given great power and he
[50:32] smoked the rock instead of just speaking
[50:34] to it I remember Elijah because he went
[50:36] bald-headed them little children teasing
[50:38] him was about being bald-headed and he
[50:40] put a curse on those shirt and 42 of
[50:42] them killed by bears
[50:43] that wasn't the Holy Spirit it was a
[50:45] prophet angered I went through all those
[50:47] things coming to that and he stood there
[50:49] talking to me and he said now listen
[50:52] Jesus says but you walk with too many he
[50:57] said to walk with me
[50:58] now you finish the quote to walk with me
[51:00] you'll walk alone I thought maybe more
[51:04] people would finish it I'm sorry if you
[51:05] didn't know that quote but Jesus said to
[51:09] walk if you want to walk in the third
[51:11] Pole you can't walk with all these other
[51:13] people and I was gonna share it next its
[51:15] denominational people amen
[51:18] I don't know yeah to walk with Jesus you
[51:23] gotta walk alone now think about now
[51:25] think about the interpretation of
[51:27] brother and never left his family to
[51:29] walk alone he stay with his family he
[51:32] never left his church although Satan
[51:34] tried to get him to leave his church
[51:35] right to go up in the mountains when he
[51:37] had that when he had that C word complex
[51:42] sorry
[51:44] Satan try to get them do that but see
[51:47] what
[51:47] that he had to leave the influence of
[51:50] other men and only be influenced by the
[51:52] Holy Spirit well Graham said I had seen
[51:57] that in my life he said I had been
[52:00] catering too much to denominations and
[52:03] everything you see somebody trying to
[52:05] tell you what to do and what not to do
[52:08] look how humble our prophet is brother
[52:09] Aaron he can admit that he was catering
[52:11] to man more than God praise God now
[52:16] maybe he was just catering this much but
[52:18] he was he that was still that much a
[52:21] potential God could use to do great
[52:24] things in his life in ministry do we
[52:28] want to give 90% church or do we want to
[52:31] give a hundred percent how much do we
[52:34] want to give of our gifts how much how
[52:37] much do we want to really be influenced
[52:39] by all of Christ the word so God was
[52:43] showing brother brand this is 1960 he's
[52:46] 51 years old God showing him you can't
[52:49] even be influenced this much by
[52:51] denominational people now how about us
[52:53] for most of us it's not denominational
[52:56] people that's going to influence us it's
[52:58] family members or friends right or
[53:01] coworkers or mother message people that
[53:04] got a denominational spirit hey
[53:06] hallelujah and let me just share this
[53:10] part of the testimonies from the weekend
[53:12] on Sunday morning I preached at the
[53:14] church and I was preaching on Talent you
[53:17] know the white is deception red is
[53:19] murdering black is money and then fourth
[53:23] is spiritual death why just showed my my
[53:25] personal understanding of that how
[53:27] Satan's trying to get into message
[53:29] churches and he's trying to divide
[53:31] churches and get people divided and have
[53:34] people money-hungry the black horse
[53:36] rider but of course they kill the
[53:39] pastors influence first they kill the
[53:41] pastors influence they take their own
[53:43] tithes and offerings and they separate
[53:45] themselves build their own Kingdom and
[53:47] then they die spiritual death in church
[53:50] I didn't even know it but brother Brooks
[53:51] told me afterwards there's a passer
[53:53] sitting on the front row that had done
[53:54] that to him
[53:57] and it was just a clear sign that God
[54:00] was discerning the life now looking back
[54:03] now I can see he was a little nervous I
[54:05] was preaching but I didn't know that you
[54:07] know I wasn't aware of that but now it's
[54:11] up to brother Brooks and those those to
[54:13] follow up and see if they can follow up
[54:15] and try to get that fixed the night
[54:18] before at the other church we were
[54:20] preaching and God did another
[54:22] discernment I had called up a brother on
[54:24] the front row over here and I called him
[54:26] up and I kind of did an illustration
[54:28] with him about Jesus and his talents and
[54:31] I said brother if Jesus said to you what
[54:35] have you done with the talents I gave
[54:36] you have you been faithful and everybody
[54:40] the church knew that he had talents he
[54:43] wasn't devoting to the Lord
[54:44] so after church he come up he fell on
[54:46] his knees in the back office saying
[54:48] brother Jesse brother Brooks pray for me
[54:50] that was God speaking to me tonight
[54:52] because he the he'd left off I'm not
[54:55] going to tell the details but he left
[54:56] off some of his talents cuz there was
[54:58] some sin in this family you know his
[55:00] wife had left him and different things
[55:01] like that
[55:02] but his wife had come back and he wasn't
[55:04] investing in his talents because of some
[55:06] things that had happened but he
[55:08] recognized that I called him out it's
[55:11] almost like a brother man in a sermon
[55:12] line of course but it wasn't I'm not a
[55:14] prophet I'm not trying to claim I'm a
[55:16] prophet what I'm saying this Holy Spirit
[55:19] is the spirit of discernment the word is
[55:21] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[55:23] of the heart
[55:24] amen so it lets us know when that
[55:26] happens the words here amen the Holy
[55:29] Spirit's here hallelujah because he
[55:31] discerns him so see he tells him now get
[55:34] back to us to walk with me you'll walk
[55:36] alone that doesn't mean you abandon your
[55:38] family doesn't mean you abandon your job
[55:40] but you stop being influenced by what
[55:42] other people say and you only take the
[55:44] word the Rev said I've been catering too
[55:49] much to denominations but see you've got
[55:52] to follow him now remember the vision
[55:54] that he gave me about the fish as you
[55:56] know and how that you couldn't teach
[55:57] supernatural signs the Pentecostal
[56:00] babies you remember that there it is and
[56:01] right at the brim of the new message so
[56:04] what was it brother Branham had tried to
[56:07] explain the first two poles to the the
[56:10] preachers remember that
[56:11] and brotherman said it caused a major
[56:14] impersonation praise God
[56:16] it caused preachers to go up and stomp
[56:19] their feet and saying I smell Devils
[56:22] because brother Branham could look in
[56:23] his hand he could look at his hand on
[56:25] the first pole and he could see the type
[56:27] of disease it was well when brother Han
[56:29] tried to explain these things people
[56:31] start impersonating it so then people
[56:33] started saying I smell devil or I hear a
[56:35] devil she would smash the brew different
[56:38] little things that would that kind of
[56:40] made it seem like they were more
[56:41] spiritual and the angel said you should
[56:44] not have tried to explain that to the
[56:46] preachers now to me brothers and sisters
[56:50] it's not thought my thought but it looks
[56:52] like he was kind of casting pearls
[56:53] before swine maybe that's kind of what
[56:57] it looks like to me because remember we
[56:59] all fall short of the glory God but
[57:01] member of course God forgives the
[57:02] Prophet and member every bride member
[57:04] there's no condemnation in there in
[57:06] Christ Jesus God will make everything in
[57:09] the permissive will work out to the
[57:11] perfect will because everybody's got to
[57:13] make mistakes except Christ amen so see
[57:16] just as God was merciful to David just
[57:18] as God was merciful to Paul just as God
[57:20] forgave Moses for killing a man and Paul
[57:22] for holding the jacket when receiving
[57:24] God's own God forgive brother Brandon
[57:26] God will forgive you and I the blood of
[57:28] Jesus Christ covers all of our sins amen
[57:34] no more than the vision left me I said
[57:37] amen Lord and my wife was standing there
[57:41] almost fainted and I jumped up out of
[57:44] the bed now remember he's got a fever
[57:45] nine days in a row and I could talk as
[57:48] good as ever I ever did so his fever
[57:53] left him and the problem with his throat
[57:54] the the cracked voice or the lost voice
[57:57] and left him he said just in a second
[58:01] every bit of the fever left me
[58:07] showing I said I like free look at
[58:09] me he said what I say come over there
[58:11] looking at me look through those sinuses
[58:12] said tell me what happened brother
[58:13] branham I said you believe my story he
[58:15] said how could I doubt it it's happened
[58:17] I said that's it that's it friend listen
[58:19] God knows how to hold you on an ash heap
[58:25] he knows how to do something for you
[58:28] until he can get the message over to you
[58:31] see to get you to do something and the
[58:36] Church said sometimes search we wonder
[58:39] why we struggle in life right
[58:41] wonder why is this struggle so long why
[58:44] is this now this was nine days
[58:46] he missed preaching opportunities he
[58:48] missed campaigns he missed special
[58:50] meetings why God was trying to get to
[58:53] see you've got to walk alone you cannot
[58:56] be influenced you can't try to explain
[58:58] some of these things to these these
[58:59] people don't try to explain it just stay
[59:02] true to the word praise God so church of
[59:06] Parana ash-heap sorry there's a net in
[59:08] here he said he said if your honor
[59:10] a sheep river going through a difficult
[59:12] time the thing to do is hang on to God
[59:14] don't doubt your calling don't doubt
[59:17] what God's already done for you but try
[59:19] to stay strong and try to see what God's
[59:21] trying to teach you so you can do
[59:23] something many times it's something
[59:25] we're not doing God's trying to open our
[59:28] eyes listen to the sermons especially
[59:30] close to that time because God wants us
[59:32] to do something praise God
[59:35] see brother God want to program to do
[59:36] something to not doubt the third Pole
[59:39] and to stay away from being influencing
[59:43] or influenced by the denominational
[59:45] trying to just don't try to explain how
[59:48] God does everything just explain the
[59:50] word Amen Alleluia so I hope that's
[59:55] helpful you know there's one thing
[59:59] praying about I'm not going to share the
[1:00:01] details there's one thing I'm praying
[1:00:02] about perhaps maybe God's got me on a
[1:00:06] sheep on a certain area in my life so I
[1:00:08] want to I want to be aware of that and
[1:00:11] I'm praying about it to see what what
[1:00:14] the Lord will do and I I told my wife
[1:00:15] about it just as a witness so that if
[1:00:18] something comes to pass soon we'll know
[1:00:20] it was the Lord I'll know was the Lord
[1:00:23] okay now let's go to Matthew 25 hope
[1:00:26] that was a blessing remember I told you
[1:00:28] and I remember some of the Saints were
[1:00:30] here I told you I wanted to go back and
[1:00:31] read what vision was that what vision
[1:00:33] did he have why did God allow brother
[1:00:35] Branham to get sick like that it was
[1:00:36] because he was catering too much
[1:00:38] denominational people explaining too
[1:00:40] much and he had to walk more alone with
[1:00:43] God Matthew 25:14 all right now I read
[1:00:53] this for our text so the kingdom of
[1:00:55] heaven what is the kingdom of heaven the
[1:00:56] baptism of Holy Ghost so this is for
[1:00:59] people that are born again into the
[1:01:01] kingdom of heaven it's as a man
[1:01:04] traveling in a far country who called
[1:01:06] his own servants and delivered unto them
[1:01:07] his goods
[1:01:10] now notice again whose money whose goods
[1:01:13] are they is it the servants or is it the
[1:01:16] rich man rich man so as we start looking
[1:01:20] at this and these these series are going
[1:01:22] to overlaps the purpose series and the
[1:01:24] Kingdom of Heaven series they're gonna
[1:01:25] overlap a little bit as we look at
[1:01:26] talents and your purpose in life and
[1:01:28] things like that if you have a
[1:01:32] supernatural gift it's God's gift not
[1:01:34] yours and God puts a great value on
[1:01:38] spiritual gifts it's a very valuable
[1:01:41] thing I'll show you the value in a
[1:01:42] little bit according to John Gill the
[1:01:44] English Protestant minister of the 1800s
[1:01:49] but look at verse 15 so he delivered
[1:01:53] unto them as Goods and he unto one he
[1:01:55] gave five talents to another two and to
[1:01:57] another one it's every man according to
[1:01:59] several ability and straightway took a
[1:02:01] journey so God by foreknowledge says
[1:02:03] well this person's gonna have a greater
[1:02:05] ability I'm gonna give this person a
[1:02:07] greater ability because of their love
[1:02:10] for me because their desire so I'm going
[1:02:13] to
[1:02:13] them five talents and he says this one
[1:02:16] there have a still great desire I'm
[1:02:18] gonna give them three years it to two
[1:02:21] talents and they says this one I'm gonna
[1:02:23] give them I know their desire I'm gonna
[1:02:25] give them one talent because remember he
[1:02:29] bases everything not by but romances not
[1:02:32] by his desire does he predestinate but
[1:02:36] by his foreknowledge amen hallelujah
[1:02:41] now before yeah before I get to some
[1:02:45] quotes let me read you the value so John
[1:02:48] John Gill the Protestant preacher he
[1:02:52] tells us one talent and I'll use gold
[1:02:56] because it's just it's a better teacher
[1:02:58] it gives you a better idea one talent of
[1:03:02] gold from the Bible was equivalent to
[1:03:07] 375 English pounds of silver or 4,500
[1:03:15] pounds of gold so I'm just gonna use
[1:03:17] gold to convert these there's a website
[1:03:19] you can use and you can convert pounds
[1:03:21] from the 1770s when John Gill was alive
[1:03:24] those English pounds you can convert to
[1:03:27] convert those to US dollars so let me
[1:03:30] say this the one talent Christian had
[1:03:35] eight hundred sixty thousand or about a
[1:03:37] million dollars okay so each tale it's
[1:03:39] about a million dollars the two talent
[1:03:42] preacher had about 1 million seven
[1:03:45] hundred thousand dollars or about two
[1:03:46] thousand we'll just run it up and the
[1:03:48] five tail it had four million three
[1:03:50] hundred thousand we'll just round up to
[1:03:52] five thousand I'm sorry five million
[1:03:55] okay so does that give you an idea
[1:03:57] Church about how valuable the gifts of
[1:03:59] God in your life are if you have to get
[1:04:01] them knowledge right if you have faith
[1:04:04] all these things and you should have
[1:04:06] seen some of the faces when I preached
[1:04:07] on that I had numerous people cry no
[1:04:09] even because they knew they weren't
[1:04:10] investing in the gifts got to given them
[1:04:11] and I've seen tremendous testimonies but
[1:04:14] currently they weren't investing in them
[1:04:16] or it ought to make us real sober right
[1:04:19] it ought to make us up a little bit and
[1:04:21] shake us a little bit and say God has
[1:04:24] given me a lot of money spiritually amen
[1:04:27] he's giving you a lot of money naturally
[1:04:28] too but forcing got a lot of big bills
[1:04:31] but it's the spiritual money that's most
[1:04:34] valuable praise God so a one talent
[1:04:39] preacher has about equivalent of 1
[1:04:42] million dollars a to talent preacher 2
[1:04:45] million 5 talent
[1:04:46] 5 million and he's got to invest that
[1:04:49] preaching gift he's got to go trade it
[1:04:52] he's got to go out and invest in it amen
[1:04:54] he's gonna go out and preach the gospel
[1:04:56] amen I think you'll like him about
[1:04:59] talent but Ram said in 1950 he said I
[1:05:03] believe that gifts and callings are
[1:05:04] without repentance you're born here in
[1:05:07] the world with these gifts just the same
[1:05:11] as you're born to be a musician you
[1:05:13] might give your child give it all kinds
[1:05:15] of lessons but if that musical talent
[1:05:17] isn't in it it'll debt never do no more
[1:05:19] good is that right but we're born the
[1:05:23] same way in the spiritual realms for
[1:05:25] gifts and callings of God are without
[1:05:27] repentance ok so I know different people
[1:05:31] that have taken piano lessons not in our
[1:05:34] family but other lessons and it doesn't
[1:05:35] do them any good you can give them less
[1:05:38] than after lesson and it's never gonna
[1:05:40] do any good that's because they don't
[1:05:41] have a talent from God but if somebody
[1:05:44] has a talent it'll start to manifest
[1:05:47] there's a gift there right like I've had
[1:05:51] people come up even when before Malachi
[1:05:53] was playing piano I had people come up
[1:05:55] and look at him when he's first hour
[1:05:56] playing said he's anointed of the Holy
[1:05:58] Spirit in fact he was brother ray his
[1:06:01] brother ray the first time mother I
[1:06:01] heard you play Malachi he said he's
[1:06:03] anointed he's anointed and yeah we gave
[1:06:08] Malachi lessons but at some point
[1:06:10] there's a time when the the gift started
[1:06:13] just manifesting itself the interest was
[1:06:16] there the effort was there the desire
[1:06:18] was there praise the Lord
[1:06:25] the next quo
[1:06:26] said dreams and singing our gifts from
[1:06:31] God he said what about a man who doesn't
[1:06:34] dream a dream his subconscious would be
[1:06:36] way back way back at the wall he never
[1:06:39] gets to it
[1:06:39] he sleeps around nothing alarms him now
[1:06:41] he can't help because he doesn't dream a
[1:06:43] dream and neither can this one help
[1:06:45] because he does dream a dream what do
[1:06:47] people what a few people that dreams
[1:06:49] dreams if you say dream me a dream you
[1:06:52] couldn't do it it's impossible somebody
[1:06:54] know what he's saying
[1:06:55] even if you have a gift you can't force
[1:06:57] it to operate if you have a gift of
[1:07:00] dreaming you should have saw in Iowa I
[1:07:02] asked both churches how many people have
[1:07:04] had a dream come to pass
[1:07:05] there was like five to ten people in
[1:07:06] each church and I told them that's the
[1:07:09] spirit of prophecy we always wonder
[1:07:11] where is the spirit of prophecy how come
[1:07:13] people are prophesied well how many
[1:07:14] people are praying to prophesy how many
[1:07:17] people are consecrated so God can trust
[1:07:19] them with a consecrated dream very few I
[1:07:25] didn't get a whole lot of amens on that
[1:07:26] and I hope because a lot of people are
[1:07:30] not dedicated or diligent with their
[1:07:33] gifts and our church said like I asked
[1:07:38] them how many you pray over the gift and
[1:07:41] said God increased my gift no hey maybe
[1:07:43] one hand went up out of all those people
[1:07:46] so God has given them like two million
[1:07:49] dollars or a million dollars and there
[1:07:51] let it set in there under the mattress
[1:07:54] right there let me just lay there I mean
[1:07:57] the least you could do is give it to a
[1:07:59] bank and least you'll get a couple
[1:08:00] hundred dollars every month at least you
[1:08:03] could do put it in a CD account right or
[1:08:06] put it in a give it to the banker let
[1:08:08] him take your money you know give it
[1:08:10] good increase good interest you and I
[1:08:14] must not bury our gifts in the world
[1:08:17] like this we must not bury them in the
[1:08:20] fear in a message Church we've got to
[1:08:23] invest in them we've got to not be
[1:08:25] afraid we've just got to cut off any
[1:08:27] other voice and just hear the voice of
[1:08:30] Christ hey man
[1:08:33] hallelujah but how many people want to
[1:08:35] be responsible for the talent very few
[1:08:38] programs so the reason Jesus doesn't
[1:08:40] Marrs because he can't trust people with
[1:08:42] it because he knows their life they're
[1:08:44] not very dedicated to it so he's not
[1:08:46] gonna send more gifts and more operation
[1:08:48] because they're not dedicated to it
[1:08:49] they'll get off the mark
[1:08:51] st. no slip in there and it'll become a
[1:08:53] hindrance rather than a benefit I don't
[1:08:55] want to be a benefit for the kingdom of
[1:08:57] God
[1:08:57] I want my preaching to be a benefit
[1:08:59] that's why I got in the closet this
[1:09:00] morning that's why I try to get in there
[1:09:01] every morning I try to lay here at the
[1:09:03] altar I want to be a blessing I want God
[1:09:05] to speak if I speak no one's help but if
[1:09:08] God speaks everybody's blessed hey man I
[1:09:11] got a humble myself though I got a
[1:09:13] belittle myself that Christ might be
[1:09:16] magnified in me he said now God made you
[1:09:23] so you dream a dream if you're a seer he
[1:09:26] made the other ones so he did not dream
[1:09:27] a dream but a seer or prophet is not
[1:09:30] something laid hands on and wished him
[1:09:32] over him a prophet a prophet is born
[1:09:35] from birth gifts and callings of God
[1:09:36] without repentance God told Jeremiah
[1:09:40] before you is even formed in your
[1:09:41] mother's womb I knew you and sanctified
[1:09:43] you ordain your prophet to the nation's
[1:09:44] see it's without repentance now the man
[1:09:49] who dreams the dream can't help it the
[1:09:50] man who doesn't dream a dream can't help
[1:09:52] it but a seer his subconscious is
[1:09:54] neither back there neither is it here
[1:09:57] it's right here he doesn't go to sleep
[1:09:58] he just breaks from one dimension to the
[1:10:00] other wide awake he can't help it he
[1:10:02] can't do that on his own will it's God
[1:10:04] but if you're giving a gift and don't
[1:10:07] use it for the glory of God
[1:10:08] then God's going to make you answer for
[1:10:11] it at the Day of Judgment now Church
[1:10:14] that's the white throne judgment and the
[1:10:17] church said but Rev says if you don't
[1:10:21] use your gift you're gonna answer the
[1:10:23] day judgment that's not that's not
[1:10:26] that's not the judgment seat of Christ
[1:10:28] that happened some time after the
[1:10:30] marriage supper or some time after I'm
[1:10:32] sure that's not that that's the white
[1:10:34] throne judgment other words the people
[1:10:36] that don't invest in their gifts are not
[1:10:38] born again and that's the reality of it
[1:10:44] because that's what brother man
[1:10:46] says plainly the people that go off and
[1:10:49] bury their gift in the world are the
[1:10:52] ones that are gonna go in the
[1:10:54] tribulation not know about you but that
[1:10:57] that puts a lot of seriousness and
[1:10:59] ruther Brooks called it sobering he said
[1:11:00] these were sobering sermons that makes a
[1:11:03] lot of us it should make us very serious
[1:11:04] about the things of God he says please
[1:11:14] without any reflection I hear on the
[1:11:16] radio when I'm in the middle part of the
[1:11:17] country here man named mr. Foley
[1:11:19] I believe they call him by a slur name
[1:11:22] or given name red red Foley he sang a
[1:11:25] piece here I hear not long ago called
[1:11:28] peace in the valley what a marvelous
[1:11:30] voice but what's he using for it
[1:11:31] God will require that so red Foley was a
[1:11:34] worldly singer but he's like Elvis he
[1:11:37] would convert over collect I don't want
[1:11:39] to call names yet kind of like Amy Grant
[1:11:43] huh me no Amy Grant is it me no Amy
[1:11:46] Grant no one okay she was a famous woman
[1:11:49] in the 80s I grew up listening nursing
[1:11:51] about thy word is a lamp unto my feet is
[1:11:54] a beautiful song well around 1980 or 91
[1:12:00] or 92 converted over like Christian
[1:12:04] Christian singers do today from
[1:12:06] Christian to mainstream in church I was
[1:12:11] in fifth grade and I remember I bought
[1:12:13] her cassette tape when she crossed over
[1:12:16] and that's when I left God I was
[1:12:18] memorizing the Bible in fifth grade I
[1:12:20] was going to a Bible Camp memorizing
[1:12:22] Scripture but as soon as I bought that
[1:12:24] filthy music I'll stop memorizing the
[1:12:26] Bible and that's when I left God right
[1:12:28] there
[1:12:29] oh it just struck me and then when I got
[1:12:31] baptized and got saved
[1:12:33] even before the message the first thing
[1:12:34] I did sister Beatrice was throw away all
[1:12:36] my worldly music so I came back where I
[1:12:40] left him amen Abraham had to come back
[1:12:43] where he left God at the same altar
[1:12:45] Peter had to come back to a fire because
[1:12:48] that's where he left Christ and a fire
[1:12:49] with the maid so had to come back to a
[1:12:51] fire and that's where he got right with
[1:12:53] God and Jesus said do you love me he
[1:12:56] said I love you more than these you know
[1:12:58] my heart Lord
[1:13:01] that's right now
[1:13:04] thank you lord bye thank you Jesus
[1:13:10] so from fifth grade I'll just say like
[1:13:12] this to 13th grade Wow eight years uh
[1:13:17] thank the Lord
[1:13:19] so I ran from God for eight years I came
[1:13:22] back to the place I left him worldly
[1:13:25] music MA
[1:13:28] praise the Lord I think I'll share that
[1:13:30] for a testimony now program said we had
[1:13:37] a Stewart Hamblin that was converting
[1:13:40] our brother Billy Graham's meeting out
[1:13:41] California movie star god bless him and
[1:13:44] he let him write a song to record
[1:13:46] there's no secret what God can do honey
[1:13:49] remember that song there is no secret
[1:13:50] what God can do what he's done for
[1:13:54] others he'll do for you but RAM said
[1:13:58] which taken the first place and all of
[1:14:00] our songs in the nation beautiful one
[1:14:03] many to Christ God makes us answer for
[1:14:05] our talent praise God so boat ramps
[1:14:09] talked about dream so far he's talked
[1:14:12] about singing what was the other one did
[1:14:18] I skip one oh and music yeah music
[1:14:25] alright yeah that's right
[1:14:29] so singing in music so far now brother
[1:14:31] Graham tells us when Moses had this
[1:14:33] thick and God said use what's in your
[1:14:35] hand that was Moses his talent and
[1:14:38] brother Ram said the boy that came to
[1:14:40] Jesus and gave us lunch that lunch was
[1:14:43] his talent okay so I'm just giving you
[1:14:45] some different quotes in other words
[1:14:47] Romero says whatever's in your hand give
[1:14:49] it to Jesus right whatever your whatever
[1:14:52] you're doing give it to Jesus and Jesus
[1:14:55] will bless it amen
[1:14:59] so of course Moses was a ministry of
[1:15:01] being a shepherd right so he went from
[1:15:03] shepherding natural sheep to shepherd in
[1:15:05] God's he baby that was in his hand amen
[1:15:09] I don't know about the boy with the fish
[1:15:11] I'm not sure about that we don't know
[1:15:12] much about his life
[1:15:13] maybe the only thing that we know about
[1:15:14] him all right
[1:15:21] Bertram's talking about a boy who sang
[1:15:23] silent night at one of his services and
[1:15:25] he said did you have a music lesson and
[1:15:30] didn't even know what a music lesson was
[1:15:32] and brother branham said he picked up a
[1:15:34] pipe one day and he blow the
[1:15:36] star-spangled banner without one
[1:15:38] practice can you imagine picking up a
[1:15:39] flute and playing the star-spangled
[1:15:42] banger oh say can you see the rest of
[1:15:47] the boy just saying that he played
[1:15:48] star-spangled banner' and he sang silent
[1:15:52] life
[1:15:54] he said that boy don't need a music
[1:15:57] lesson he was born that way
[1:15:58] he don't need lesson it's just a gift
[1:16:01] and now you hear these singers come on
[1:16:04] the air these fellows with different
[1:16:06] ones I don't want to mention their names
[1:16:07] in public become millionaires in a
[1:16:09] week's time just singing two songs he
[1:16:11] said America has become full of Bali
[1:16:13] Bali whoo and all kinds of programs so
[1:16:16] even the other nations laugh at us for
[1:16:18] our nonsense he said it's just somebody
[1:16:21] cracked jokes or some sing some song no
[1:16:25] doubt these fellows women are good
[1:16:26] singers they're gifted people but you
[1:16:28] know what God will make them answer for
[1:16:31] what they do at that talent that's right
[1:16:34] they better be using it for the kingdom
[1:16:35] of God that's true whatever we have
[1:16:38] let's use it for the kingdom of God's
[1:16:39] sake every town we have let's put it in
[1:16:42] the kingdom of God hallelujah
[1:16:50] now this is a good one let me see how
[1:16:52] much further I should go all right now
[1:16:57] in this quote this is from earnestly
[1:16:59] contending for the faith 1954 when I was
[1:17:07] talking about how birds sing member how
[1:17:08] he sang the song birds in the sky sing
[1:17:10] but was that brother Mannis talking
[1:17:12] about how birds worship the Lord he said
[1:17:16] that's the gospel preached in bird
[1:17:17] language did you know that he said that
[1:17:20] the birds were preaching the gospel
[1:17:22] every time they sing they're preaching
[1:17:24] to the birds he said oh I'm sorry no
[1:17:27] brother I said the birds are preaching
[1:17:28] the gospel to us praise the Lord that's
[1:17:31] what he says maybe that's what the birds
[1:17:33] are doing when they're singing like that
[1:17:34] preaching the gospel to us in bird
[1:17:37] language I think of a chickety chickety
[1:17:39] chickety chickety that's the gospel now
[1:17:49] let me go to the next paragraph him he
[1:17:53] said now you when you hear our brother
[1:17:55] and those birds like that that is a
[1:17:57] spiritual gift I'm out singing try to
[1:18:00] impersonate it once and see how you get
[1:18:02] along in other words one of you tonight
[1:18:06] trap and come up and and close the
[1:18:08] service on piano who'd like to do it
[1:18:10] who'd like to personate Malachi tonight
[1:18:11] who'd like to do it anybody I didn't
[1:18:16] think so which EU men would like to come
[1:18:21] up here and try to impersonate the
[1:18:22] sermon tonight or the young men we only
[1:18:26] got two sorry don't mean to point you
[1:18:28] out or anything but I'm just saying like
[1:18:31] when it's a gift of God like I heard a
[1:18:34] preacher say you know give give one man
[1:18:37] all the quotes in the scriptures see
[1:18:39] what he'll do with it and then give a
[1:18:40] gifted man quotes in scriptures see what
[1:18:42] he'll do with it well we see that all
[1:18:44] the time when people people for each
[1:18:46] peach of sorry when people preach false
[1:18:48] doctrine sorry peach I had a peach
[1:18:50] yesterday when people preach false
[1:18:52] doctrine that's what happens many times
[1:18:54] those people aren't called to preach
[1:18:56] sometimes they are if they're right many
[1:18:59] times in the
[1:19:00] then Satan to seize them and they get
[1:19:02] off in a false doctrine that caused a
[1:19:03] lot of sin and evil immorality and lust
[1:19:06] and things like that
[1:19:07] then Satan just got in and perverted the
[1:19:09] gift but if they never really get a good
[1:19:11] anointing then they work hard of God to
[1:19:13] preach because they're just
[1:19:16] impersonating it because God will come
[1:19:18] and back it up
[1:19:20] he said that gift was in and when he was
[1:19:22] born the gift was another man when he
[1:19:24] was born now it's interesting - I never
[1:19:26] thought I'd be a pastor but because I
[1:19:28] was a successful athlete every time we
[1:19:31] had an assembly to celebrate our
[1:19:32] victories they always hand the
[1:19:33] microphone to me it's like brother Aaron
[1:19:36] the whole time they were telling me
[1:19:37] you're the spokesman you're the
[1:19:38] spokesman I'm like I don't want to talk
[1:19:40] why you calling me to talk why don't he
[1:19:43] when I was 17 years old when I wasn't
[1:19:45] even the leader of the team I can see
[1:19:48] God was trying to prepare me to be a
[1:19:50] pastor now he says this he says but what
[1:20:02] they use their gifts for is what goes
[1:20:04] every man will have to answer first
[1:20:06] Talent God gives men tell and they have
[1:20:08] to use it some can preach like a house
[1:20:10] on fire and other different things but
[1:20:12] God requires these talents and I'm so
[1:20:15] thankful to know that these two brethren
[1:20:16] sitting back there have used their
[1:20:18] talents which they could be out there in
[1:20:20] night clubs and everything else are
[1:20:21] using those sounds but they surrender
[1:20:23] them to the Lord Jesus Christ to win
[1:20:25] souls and I'm happy for that this
[1:20:28] morning and my brother and may the Lord
[1:20:30] ever continue
[1:20:31] he said the little brother they are the
[1:20:33] song leader brother Coble many others
[1:20:36] hear God has give you a talents of song
[1:20:38] leaders maybe you say well brother brand
[1:20:41] he hasn't given me nothing now watch
[1:20:43] what brother man would say if someone
[1:20:45] would come up and say God didn't give me
[1:20:47] any talent watcher Bill Graham says he
[1:20:53] says you don't know maybe you just may
[1:20:59] go try something maybe you've never went
[1:21:02] out and tried to testify to somebody
[1:21:06] praise God
[1:21:08] he
[1:21:09] try that amen someone that says I
[1:21:14] already know anything Iran said go try
[1:21:18] and testify to somebody go try and tell
[1:21:22] about the things God has done for you
[1:21:26] he said everybody can't do that
[1:21:30] how many believing programs right now
[1:21:33] everybody can witless like brother Simon
[1:21:35] I used to feel bad when I could have
[1:21:36] witnessed like brother Simon but I'm not
[1:21:38] brother Simon you know he's small like
[1:21:41] that but he's got he's got the heart of
[1:21:42] a lion he don't he's not scared of
[1:21:44] anybody I've seen him go up and witness
[1:21:46] the guys way bigger than me
[1:21:48] he's something else that you could do he
[1:21:51] says there's something that you can do
[1:21:53] that you can put it to God but now the
[1:21:55] thing you have to do is do what the
[1:21:57] brother do what the brother sing in his
[1:22:00] song yield amen
[1:22:03] so the thing you've gotta do to find
[1:22:05] your gift is yield in other words to let
[1:22:07] the Holy Spirit have his way
[1:22:11] like Malachi had to yield I had to tell
[1:22:14] me okay Marik I need to play every
[1:22:15] service member that Malachi you need to
[1:22:18] play every service I've been trying to
[1:22:20] get Liddy to yield to Lydia play the
[1:22:22] piano she's got a little gift there hope
[1:22:25] it's okay that I use you I know you love
[1:22:27] me I love you too well but see with and
[1:22:31] there's a time and season for every gift
[1:22:32] so remember that there was a time and
[1:22:34] season for every gift but see that's all
[1:22:36] we've got to do is yield to what the
[1:22:38] Holy Spirit's trying to gently push us
[1:22:41] to do he's trying to lead us to do it
[1:22:44] praise God what's God trying to get us
[1:22:48] to do yield to him say yes Lord okay
[1:22:52] I'll obey program goes on to say this
[1:22:58] that the man who could whistle by man
[1:23:00] calls whistling a gift of God whistling
[1:23:04] a man who could whistle and personally
[1:23:08] all the birds had ever lived well then
[1:23:09] that man yield himself to give in to it
[1:23:12] the man who could sing he yield himself
[1:23:13] he give in to now for these things here
[1:23:16] of the gospel of the manifestation of
[1:23:17] visions I just yield myself and give
[1:23:20] into it and that's what does it so it's
[1:23:22] not me it's him and it's something that
[1:23:24] you can't help the man can't help
[1:23:26] because he was born to whistle like
[1:23:28] birds why he's just he was born that way
[1:23:31] the man that sang was the same way to
[1:23:34] see visions is just as common to me as
[1:23:36] it is to them to whistle so you see what
[1:23:39] I mean now it's all together it's for
[1:23:41] one edification of the glory of Jesus
[1:23:44] Christ the Son of God
[1:23:55] here's another one from was this the
[1:23:57] same same year but may have said I was
[1:24:06] sitting back with brother would just a
[1:24:07] few moments ago and a certain little
[1:24:09] fellow that's been around the church for
[1:24:11] a long time it wasn't Brotherhood if
[1:24:12] somebody else he's always one to find
[1:24:14] his place now how many can say amen to
[1:24:17] that you've always wanted to find your
[1:24:18] place I believe I could tell him if he
[1:24:21] just do it program says it's singing
[1:24:28] brother temple so now he names a brother
[1:24:31] temple brother temple had a gift of
[1:24:33] singing about Rams like I could tell you
[1:24:34] it's singing you might do one thing in
[1:24:40] another but you're you're a good singer
[1:24:42] I sure appreciate that if you would just
[1:24:44] turn yourself loose to singing God would
[1:24:49] use you to see how a lot of people
[1:24:52] program could even see in his church
[1:24:54] people have gifts they just don't do it
[1:24:58] you just got to turn yourself loose and
[1:25:00] do it that's what God wants us to do
[1:25:04] turn ourselves loose and do it for the
[1:25:07] glory of God
[1:25:08] try it try it praise God he says but
[1:25:17] you're around over everything else but
[1:25:19] the right thing
[1:25:20] get in the singing there is your talent
[1:25:23] you have to use that wonderful I like
[1:25:27] that old-time singing don't you yes sir
[1:25:29] to hear that that way like that brother
[1:25:30] Neville I sure do Oh hallelujah you have
[1:25:36] to use the talents God gave you and if
[1:25:42] you're not sure it's because you haven't
[1:25:44] tried enough how about that oh well
[1:25:47] that's the court I'm going to use in the
[1:25:48] future
[1:25:48] I don't have any gifts I don't know what
[1:25:52] God's called me do well what have you
[1:25:53] tried
[1:25:54] have you tried whistling have you tried
[1:25:57] singing have you tried testifying to
[1:25:59] your neighbor about the Lord
[1:26:00] have you tried preaching have you tried
[1:26:04] praying for a sick person when they're
[1:26:05] sick up here
[1:26:07] you say well how do I know they're sick
[1:26:09] well the next time let me know I'll let
[1:26:11] you know when there's a sick person I'll
[1:26:12] call you up to pray for them let's see
[1:26:14] if God moves on your behalf
[1:26:22] just turn yourself loose to singing God
[1:26:26] would use you so I had to make a
[1:26:30] decision am I going to turn myself loose
[1:26:31] to preaching or not I had turned myself
[1:26:35] loose to praying for the sick or not we
[1:26:39] often make that decision are we going to
[1:26:42] turn ourselves loose praise God
[1:26:46] all right let me find a place to close
[1:26:47] here give me about five or ten more
[1:26:49] minutes here set a timer
[1:27:03] alright let me head back here to this
[1:27:07] document here alright so let's look at
[1:27:11] this let's go back to the town so we'll
[1:27:12] finish with that one now if you were in
[1:27:17] Matthew 25 just turn back one chapter to
[1:27:21] Matthew 24 verse 1 unless you can pull
[1:27:25] it up here let's look at this now in
[1:27:27] this particular context
[1:27:30] Jesus is actually only talking to his
[1:27:33] disciples so the only ones that heard
[1:27:35] the parable of the talents was the
[1:27:37] disciples which is good especially for
[1:27:40] preachers right
[1:27:41] preachers need to know some preachers
[1:27:43] have one talent like me and then some
[1:27:45] got two and then some got five I'm sorry
[1:27:47] I only got a one-town but I'm trying to
[1:27:49] invest all I can't do it amen to that
[1:27:52] hallelujah I've done everything I can do
[1:27:54] to invest in it study more pray more
[1:27:56] write books meditate pray make videos
[1:27:59] I'm driving everything I can do to
[1:28:01] invest in this gift
[1:28:03] amen we look at 24 good Lydia thank you
[1:28:07] and Jesus went out and departed from the
[1:28:09] temple and his disciples came to him for
[1:28:11] show him the the buildings of the temple
[1:28:13] next verse and Jesus on them see not all
[1:28:17] these things verily I say unto you there
[1:28:19] shall not be here one stone upon another
[1:28:22] that shall not be thrown down now verse
[1:28:27] 4 that it can I'm sorry verse 3 and as
[1:28:30] he sat upon the Mount of Olives the
[1:28:31] disciples came unto him privately saying
[1:28:33] tell us when shall these things be and
[1:28:35] what should be the sign of thy coming
[1:28:36] and the
[1:28:38] 4:25 they all answer those questions
[1:28:41] praise God hallelujah so now do you
[1:28:47] understand when Jesus told the talents
[1:28:48] there's a bunch of jealous preachers can
[1:28:51] you imagine sitting there a few days
[1:28:54] later they'll be arguing well I'm
[1:28:56] greater I've got five no you you sit out
[1:28:58] I've got five because the Bible said
[1:29:02] they were arguing just a few days before
[1:29:04] Christ was crucified it was right along
[1:29:07] the time the fig tree was cursed like
[1:29:08] that's like a week less than a week
[1:29:11] there are you saying I'm a five talent
[1:29:13] preacher you know what look at you did
[1:29:16] you hear about my meetings over there
[1:29:18] and Cappadocia or whatever you know I'm
[1:29:19] just making up Tyree did you hear about
[1:29:22] the meetings I had in Tyree I'm a 5-2
[1:29:24] and a preacher bro brother they're
[1:29:29] arguing who is greater now that was
[1:29:32] after this parable so they come to Jesus
[1:29:36] quietly when will these things be now if
[1:29:40] we look at the parable of tails which
[1:29:42] question is it answering is it the
[1:29:45] question of when shall the stones be
[1:29:46] cast down no is it the question of what
[1:29:51] should be the sign of thy coming yes and
[1:29:54] watch to me the sign of the end of the
[1:29:56] world kind of with the with the one
[1:29:58] talent preacher okay so it's kind of
[1:30:02] both of those because they're so close
[1:30:03] together right cuz my man and the Bible
[1:30:05] tells us I think they're they're tossed
[1:30:07] out into outer darkness I think if I'm
[1:30:09] not mistaken okay so now head over to
[1:30:12] chapter 25 so now we got the
[1:30:14] understanding of this and I love this
[1:30:16] because program said the pastor's job
[1:30:17] I'm just it's my job to tell you what's
[1:30:19] in the Bible I don't have to prophesy
[1:30:22] I'm to speak in tongues I'm going to do
[1:30:24] all the miracles I got to do my gifts
[1:30:28] but one of my most important gifts as a
[1:30:29] pastor is to tell you what the Bible
[1:30:31] says they aim ahead I had a brother out
[1:30:33] there in Iowa said he said I like
[1:30:34] watching your sermons he said how do you
[1:30:36] know all those scriptures I said well I
[1:30:37] just study uh all the time it's just
[1:30:39] God's gift it's not me it's just he's
[1:30:41] now like hearing you because you
[1:30:42] actually mentioned a lot of verses you
[1:30:44] know where a lot of verses are found I
[1:30:46] said well that's just because it's God's
[1:30:47] gift it's not I don't take any credit
[1:30:49] it's just I'm trying to invest in the
[1:30:50] gifts God gave me
[1:30:52] now 25 verse 14 we read 14 and 15 Jesus
[1:30:59] goes on a journey right now the kingdom
[1:31:04] of heaven is like a rich man most of us
[1:31:05] are pretty familiar with this now verse
[1:31:12] 16 then he that had the I'm sure I had
[1:31:16] received the five talents went and
[1:31:18] traded with the same and made them other
[1:31:21] five talents and likewise he that had
[1:31:23] received two he also gained other two
[1:31:26] but he that received one went and digged
[1:31:29] in the earth and hid his Lords money now
[1:31:31] who's that Judas right because there's
[1:31:34] 12 preachers around and Jesus saying
[1:31:37] I've given each of you talents some have
[1:31:42] more than others say hey man you
[1:31:44] remember Peter got all upset but I
[1:31:45] already said he said well what Jesus
[1:31:47] what about John it's John gonna be here
[1:31:49] till you see the Lord's coming anyone
[1:31:51] Jesus say don't worry about me
[1:31:53] I'm sorry don't worry about John follow
[1:31:55] thou me remember that don't worry about
[1:31:58] John remember jesus said John he said
[1:32:01] some are standing here that will not
[1:32:03] taste death till they see the Lord's
[1:32:04] appearing and Peter thought oh well what
[1:32:06] do you mean John gets to live to the
[1:32:07] rapture and Jesus said don't worry about
[1:32:09] John preached the word Peter amen in
[1:32:12] other words don't worry about other
[1:32:14] people's gifts and callings worry be
[1:32:16] concerned about investing in the talents
[1:32:18] God gave you amen
[1:32:21] he knew there be some jealousy amongst
[1:32:23] preachers god help us god help us all so
[1:32:30] Judas is the one who went and buried his
[1:32:32] Lords money in the earth because he
[1:32:36] forsook his bishopric the Bible calls it
[1:32:39] a bishop prickers which is like in a
[1:32:41] position of a bishop as an apostle verse
[1:32:45] 19 and after a long time the Lord of
[1:32:47] those servants cometh and recognized
[1:32:50] with him and so he had received the five
[1:32:52] talents came and brought other five
[1:32:53] talents saying Lord thou delivers unto
[1:32:55] me five tales behold I came beside them
[1:32:57] five talents more his Lord said to him
[1:33:01] well done thou good and faithful servant
[1:33:03] thou hast been faithful over a few
[1:33:05] things I'll make the rule
[1:33:06] many things enter thou into the joy of
[1:33:08] the Lord he also that received two
[1:33:11] talents came and said Lord thou delivers
[1:33:13] unto me two talents behold I've gained
[1:33:15] two other talents beside them his Lord
[1:33:18] sending him well done good and faithful
[1:33:20] servant thou has been faithful over a
[1:33:22] few things I will make thee ruler over
[1:33:23] many things enter thou into the joy of
[1:33:26] the Lord verse 24 then he which had
[1:33:29] received the one talent came and said
[1:33:32] lord I knew that thou were in a hard man
[1:33:36] reap
[1:33:36] now has not sown and gathering where
[1:33:38] there hast not straw now did you ever
[1:33:39] noticed this this is the lie this isn't
[1:33:43] true is God unjust is God is God imp I'm
[1:33:49] sorry is God partial no gods impartial
[1:33:51] so see the servant has a wrong attitude
[1:33:55] about Christ and his words the Bible
[1:33:59] said your words we either justify you or
[1:34:01] your words will condemn you how could it
[1:34:05] be a hard man when he just gave you a
[1:34:06] million dollars ain't head he's a loving
[1:34:09] man he gave you a million of his dollars
[1:34:14] dollars he gave you a precious gift to
[1:34:16] say case you Tamra gotta use that
[1:34:18] million dollars for the kingdom of God
[1:34:21] now as we get older Haman will start
[1:34:23] seeing yours Karras was our seein yours
[1:34:28] but it's just I'm just recognizing the
[1:34:31] gift maybe you can play piano way better
[1:34:33] than other people because it's just a
[1:34:35] gift but that doesn't mean you get
[1:34:39] complacent or you don't practice it with
[1:34:42] it that means your practice harder
[1:34:44] that means you focus more that mean you
[1:34:47] give yourself to where you see God
[1:34:49] blessing your life amen you give
[1:34:51] yourself wholly to that because you can
[1:34:54] see God's hand in it
[1:34:57] praise God and Lydia you got a real
[1:35:04] sense of sensitivity to the Holy Spirit
[1:35:07] you do you got a gift in that air I
[1:35:10] don't know if that's a gift of
[1:35:11] discernment or remember when you come up
[1:35:14] praying for the Holy Ghost and then who
[1:35:17] had God at that very day
[1:35:19] that's a gift like you felt you felt the
[1:35:22] presence of Lord you thought it was near
[1:35:24] got some type of uh because not
[1:35:27] everybody felt that that day I didn't
[1:35:29] feel so there's there's a gift there's
[1:35:33] there's something God invested with you
[1:35:35] he gave you something when you were born
[1:35:38] maokai you were given the town to play
[1:35:40] when you were born probably maybe some
[1:35:42] other things acacia sing you were given
[1:35:46] the town to sing I think you know that
[1:35:49] don't you you were because I'll try to
[1:35:57] sing like you I can't do it well Ram
[1:35:59] said try to impersonate at them if you
[1:36:01] think you can do it if it's so easy do
[1:36:03] it right so see this is a lie God is not
[1:36:14] a hard man now has got a fair man has
[1:36:16] got a strict man yes but he's not hard
[1:36:18] and he doesn't reap where it in so amen
[1:36:21] he's faithful he's true he's fair he's
[1:36:25] just he only reaps where he sews amen
[1:36:29] God's not a thief God's not gonna take
[1:36:32] something that doesn't belong to him
[1:36:33] he's a he's an honest man but this
[1:36:36] servants got some bad attitudes here
[1:36:38] he's got some false doctrine praise God
[1:36:41] sorry there was my time verse 25 and I
[1:36:49] was afraid see what did this what caused
[1:36:51] it to happen the spirit of fear so the
[1:36:54] man took the spirit of fear rather than
[1:36:56] the spirit of the Holy Ghost fear will
[1:37:00] make you bury your talents in the things
[1:37:03] of the world and that's why brother
[1:37:05] sister that's why I know all the people
[1:37:07] that really love our church we'll listen
[1:37:09] tonight even if they're not here and all
[1:37:11] the people that are really dedicated
[1:37:12] will listen to this and they'll hear
[1:37:14] this and the reality is that those that
[1:37:20] really love God they want to invest in
[1:37:22] the gifts that they're given and they
[1:37:24] want to be the dedicated ones but the
[1:37:31] that don't want to be dedicated they
[1:37:33] might have a spirit of fear or they
[1:37:35] might just not be born again so let me
[1:37:39] say like this if you're not currently
[1:37:40] investing in a gift then it's time to
[1:37:43] get down to the business with God some
[1:37:45] say God I don't want to be afraid I
[1:37:47] don't have the wrong attitude I don't
[1:37:49] want to think God in and give me
[1:37:50] something listen the Bible said he gave
[1:37:51] every servant something amen you've got
[1:37:54] something I've got something we've all
[1:37:56] got something now we got to find out
[1:37:58] what is it amen
[1:37:59] if you don't know try something try it
[1:38:03] amen try it do it amen there's something
[1:38:07] try it of course
[1:38:10] pray first don't do anything without
[1:38:13] praying first before I went to preach I
[1:38:17] told you this but I think I fasted two
[1:38:19] days out of the week before I preached
[1:38:20] for brother Brooks and I asked God give
[1:38:23] me a sign and before I even before I
[1:38:25] even took my text a sister Karen Sanders
[1:38:28] gave like a word a knowledge and she
[1:38:30] basically told what I was going to
[1:38:31] preach before I even stepped to the
[1:38:32] pulpit and then at the end of the sermon
[1:38:34] the whole the entire pulpit area was
[1:38:38] filled with people weeping and crying
[1:38:40] and repenting my very first sermon in
[1:38:42] Lima and then it happened the same way
[1:38:44] twice in a row
[1:38:45] that's so God gave me two witnesses and
[1:38:48] I've always hung on to that brother
[1:38:49] Aaron that see I put God to the test
[1:38:51] I prayed him fasted I said God if you
[1:38:54] want me to preach to prove it to me he
[1:38:56] proved it to me I don't doubt it anymore
[1:38:58] although some sermons are more annoying
[1:39:01] to than others it doesn't matter the
[1:39:02] same Holy Ghost is still here every
[1:39:03] service amen
[1:39:04] and if we're obedient than God's
[1:39:06] blessing us amen
[1:39:10] there's times to water church and
[1:39:13] there's time to plant but God gives the
[1:39:15] increase I know you're not every service
[1:39:19] is not every day out there is a harvest
[1:39:21] is it now it's beautiful during the
[1:39:23] summer
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:26] over there we can go there at the
[1:39:27] beginning I forget when we get to begin
[1:39:29] lettuce at the beginning brought to the
[1:39:30] garden a few weeks later blueberries
[1:39:33] when we get out of the garden this week
[1:39:34] Tomatoes
[1:39:35] we got peaches this week I love it but
[1:39:39] this is the harvest season amen but
[1:39:41] there's a different season for every
[1:39:43] harvest praise God same thing true with
[1:39:45] these gifts not invest in them pray
[1:39:50] first before you do something seek my
[1:39:53] advice or seek seek see God's leadership
[1:39:57] and then invest in them but see the
[1:40:00] reason message people a lot of them
[1:40:02] don't invest in the kingdom of God they
[1:40:04] don't know their gift because they're
[1:40:05] afraid to fail we are fair but rancid
[1:40:09] I'm always a failure but God never fails
[1:40:11] amen see and like like we said last week
[1:40:18] the reason they don't they don't pray
[1:40:19] enough they don't pray enough they don't
[1:40:23] obey enough they don't fast enough hello
[1:40:26] they don't give alms enough see they're
[1:40:29] too selfish they're too self-centered so
[1:40:32] how can God use them to help other
[1:40:33] people when all they worry about is
[1:40:35] their self gifts are not for you they're
[1:40:39] for somebody else how can God use some
[1:40:42] of our gifts if we're always looking at
[1:40:43] me me me no I'm not saying people here
[1:40:45] I'm saying just anyone who's listening
[1:40:47] or anyone the message I'm not really
[1:40:49] poor I'm not pointing out anybody right
[1:40:51] I don't know where people's lives are
[1:40:53] but I'm saying our church needs to not
[1:40:56] be afraid if we're letting the Holy
[1:40:59] Spirit we're praying we need to try and
[1:41:01] find what God's called us to do on this
[1:41:03] earth because listen you are gonna stand
[1:41:07] before Christ I'm gonna stand before
[1:41:10] Christ and he's gonna say Jesse Smith
[1:41:12] what did you do with them talents I gave
[1:41:14] you now that's a makes me want to cry
[1:41:17] cuz that's so serious what did you do
[1:41:23] with it now to me that
[1:41:27] that that makes you want to go pray
[1:41:29] right now that makes you want to go
[1:41:31] study tonight you know because I don't
[1:41:34] want to be negligent I don't want to be
[1:41:36] lazy with the money he gave me never
[1:41:40] understand I was afraid I went and hid
[1:41:47] thy preaching gift your Apostle gift in
[1:41:49] the earth lo there thou hast that is
[1:41:52] thine his Lord answered and said to him
[1:41:56] that wicked sea is wicked you think God
[1:41:59] steals from people he said that's wicked
[1:42:02] Jesus doesn't steal from anybody amen
[1:42:06] now wicked and slothful servant thou
[1:42:09] knewest that i reap where i so see you
[1:42:11] thought you knew this about me you did
[1:42:13] it it's not true verse 27 now artists
[1:42:17] therefore to have put my money to the
[1:42:19] exchangers and then at my coming I
[1:42:21] should have received mine own with usury
[1:42:23] take therefore the tale from him and
[1:42:25] give it to him that hath ten talents
[1:42:28] verse 29 front every one that hath shall
[1:42:31] be given but he that shall have
[1:42:33] abundance but from him that hath not
[1:42:36] shall be taken away even that which he
[1:42:38] hath and caste the unprofitable servant
[1:42:41] into outer darkness see there's the
[1:42:42] tribulation there shall be weeping and
[1:42:46] gnashing of teeth that sin to our feet
[1:42:48] here Lydia pull up one more scripture
[1:42:53] here first Corinthians 12 31 I am NOT
[1:42:59] going off the balance I'm not going off
[1:43:01] the deep end tonight but just breathe
[1:43:03] the scripture covet earnestly the best
[1:43:09] gifts and yet show i unto you a more
[1:43:13] excellent way now we all battle coveting
[1:43:15] right we covet cars sometime gonna see a
[1:43:19] new car and mine's got rust all over I
[1:43:21] think boy be really nice to have a new
[1:43:23] car not the van my other little car we
[1:43:28] all battle coveting right we want a
[1:43:30] house or we want a money or you want to
[1:43:32] a spouse or something like we want
[1:43:34] something that's not ours it's somebody
[1:43:36] else's but here's one of the few times
[1:43:39] in the Bible
[1:43:40] God said it's okay to covet okay - what
[1:43:47] what somebody else has in other words
[1:43:49] you want to see God use what somebody
[1:43:52] else has I want to see God use the song
[1:43:56] leader on Sunday I want to see God use
[1:44:00] the brother that speaks in tongues on
[1:44:02] Wednesday night I want to see God use
[1:44:05] the preacher on Sunday morning
[1:44:08] I can't wait oh I really wanted to seek
[1:44:11] somebody healing on Sunday morning is
[1:44:14] there anything wrong with that Church
[1:44:16] anything wrong with it no as long as you
[1:44:19] know the greatest the more excellent way
[1:44:21] is being born again as long as you don't
[1:44:23] turn this into all gifts are greater
[1:44:24] than the Holy Ghost baptism not true I
[1:44:28] don't think we'll ever do that here
[1:44:30] Church if we do I'm in a big trouble on
[1:44:32] the day judgment I'm in big trouble
[1:44:34] I don't think we'll ever do that here
[1:44:37] nothing is greater than the baptism of
[1:44:40] the Holy Ghost the seal of God - the day
[1:44:41] of your Redemption but if you've got
[1:44:46] that then this is your next this is your
[1:44:50] next move and all this means is you want
[1:44:54] to come and you want to see God move in
[1:44:56] our services that's what that means
[1:45:00] you covet earnestly the best gifts now
[1:45:05] what is the best gifts we know wisdom is
[1:45:07] the best gift program says also
[1:45:10] prophesies a great gift because it
[1:45:12] blesses everybody can you imagine ounces
[1:45:15] I'm gonna say I announce tonight and I
[1:45:17] said thus saith the Lord
[1:45:18] Benjamin Austen I'm not saying that
[1:45:21] let's say Benjamin Austen will return by
[1:45:23] the end of this year and give their
[1:45:24] hearts to Lord and get rebaptised now
[1:45:26] what if that happened wouldn't we all
[1:45:28] rejoice now hopefully they're listening
[1:45:30] hopefully they will help but I'm not
[1:45:32] prophesying you know what I mean
[1:45:34] can I talk to Benjamin about it I've
[1:45:36] been texting him but church
[1:45:40] that make us live closer to God if we
[1:45:42] had that well why don't we see it well
[1:45:46] it could be those gifts there's not the
[1:45:48] time for the gifts yet or it could be
[1:45:51] some people are investing in the gifts
[1:45:52] yet especially people that have dreams
[1:45:56] or speak in tongues or interpret right
[1:46:00] now it's easy for me to say that because
[1:46:02] I don't do that so I'm not putting any
[1:46:05] I'm not shaming any anyone or any
[1:46:07] anybody at all what I'm saying is that
[1:46:10] if we want to see more of God we've got
[1:46:12] a covenant and that will make us pray
[1:46:15] more seek God more because we know we
[1:46:19] got to face God one day said it's okay
[1:46:23] to covet Saints so in other words this
[1:46:27] means we need to hunger and thirst for
[1:46:29] righteousness praise God let's have a
[1:46:37] word of Prayer let's bow our heads here
[1:46:38] tonight
[1:46:43] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[1:46:47] blood of your son Jesus
