TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I got some good feedback even online somebody there's one comment on the sermon from Sunday it said this was a beautiful message from start to finish so I said praise the Lord I kept studying on that I was going to make a video on it this morning but then I got finding more quotes and I didn't have enough time to make a video on it so I was going to preach a part two I try this to be a blessing to you amen it's a great encouragement to know uh you're saved Hallelujah and when the devil tries to whisper your lost or you cross the line you can come back with the word of God cuz really it's going boil down to that who do we believe the liar or do believe the truth let's believe the way the truth and the life he has a name his name is Jesus Hallelujah Matthew 12:43 and I love what brother Ram said his great love for god brother Bram said even if God would send me to hell I'd still love him in hell but see the the Lost can't do that they don't love God remember they hate to retain God in their knowledge so even in brother Ram's testimony God would never send him there right because he loved loves God the people that go to hell are the people that don't want to be with God how many want to be with God in heaven Hallelujah for eternity well you're going to be there by God's grace you just trust the word of the Lord hallelujah so God bless you let's go to Matthew 12 now I want to read this because uh it's going to just U apply a little later and I I might even share a little testimony from brother Chris you know he was he and I were text in last week that video of that man I might share that just a little testimony how it's such an inspiration and how God can use people like that which is really wonderful yes amen I love that you know when God anoints somebody man or woman you know to testify it stirs us up I love that God can use that by God's grace so I might share that it's a this is part of this here too okay Matthew 12:43 uh I'll read 4344 then we can all read 45 together by God's grace when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none I'm going to pause right there so I gave my testimony I had some evil spirit that was causing me to be addicted to lots of evil things like tobacco was one of them we went over last week chewing tobacco that was a spirit some type of a spirit to kill my body right to get me to have cancer some type of evil spirit well that Spirit left but no doubt it tried to come back right and so whatever Spirit someone might have you know lust of the eyes lust of the F flesh pride of life alcohol Drugs porn whatever it is that spirit will leave but then it's going to try to come back so we got to be ready when it comes back now for you little ones maybe it wouldn't be something like that but maybe it be lying stealing dishonesty right uh disrespect something like that some type of a sin like a pride thing and you you get deliverance from it you know as far as it'll battle your mind you get Deliverance but you got to be ready it's going to come back you got to be ready to fight verse 44 then he saith I'll return into my house from whence I came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished notice he finds it clean but he doesn't find it filled and that's the difference you know whatever area we struggle with once that spirit's gone we got to fill our mind with scriptures to combat that evil spirit we got to fill it fill our minds with truth and here's how you overcome this here's how you stay free here's how you get the victory you got to fill your mind with something if you don't the devil will get right back in now let's all read verse 45 on three 1 2 three then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation let's have one more word of prayer let's bow our heads if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God God sees all the hands you're Defying Gravity you're defying tiredness you're defying all these things trying to do a spiritual thing Lord God you see the hands Lord I pray you minister to them Lord you see the hearts of those that even maybe can't raise their hands Lord you know the needs of your people I pray you speak to them Lord I'm nothing I uh you give me enough Grace to know I I'm nothing Lord so take control of my vessel use my lips use my tongue my thoughts and Lord speak your word Lord you didn't call mechanical devices to preach the gospel or Angels or the wind or waves or something like that but you called men fallible men to preach your infallible word Lord so do what only you can do here tonight Lord and minister to your people I ask it Lord feed your sheep strengthen them if anyone needs Deliverance may they be set free tonight in Jesus Christ's name I ask it and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I want to do a quick review uh real quick by God's grace just hit some of the scriptures from Sunday we looked at the context of Matthew 12 uh Jesus was talking about Idle Words and that doesn't apply to us because we're forgiven of all of our sins praise God we've already passed from death into life there's no condemnation you know my my wife kind of made me laugh this week she said I went I went to bed one night I was quoting scriptures I was quoting 1 Thessalonians 5:9 I think it was maybe Sunday night or Monday night and I just went to bed quoting that scripture uh for God ha not appointed me unto wrath but to obtain salvation through Christ Jesus our lord I went to bed saying that and my wife kind of made me laugh she said uh she woke up during the middle of night and I was praying in in my sleep that's how I want to go to heaven right there so I hope I passed away if if I live to be along like 120 hopefully I hope when I pass over that's when I pass over when I'm praying in my sleep and I was mumbling some things and I said and by your grace and mercy amen so I told Malachi I said that's hey that's what I want to start I do I want to remember to do that every night pray at pray myself to sleep by God's grace so we want to do that by God's grace but remember friends you won't be judged for Idle Words because you're forgiven of them the blood of Christ forgives all sins now of course we'll we'll we'll deal with any punishment here or any any chastisement here it'll just be small of course and uh but God will he will not hold any he will not lay anything to our charge because we're forgiven Hallelujah and then we looked at the reprobate scriptures uh we will not be rejected we are accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah we are the elect the chosen before the foundation of the world because we want to be like the Lord Jesus Christ and then we saw brother R Define uh blasphemy just in modern terms it's make fun of the Holy Ghost it's it's speak evil against the Holy Ghost he said it's calling the works of God the works of the devil he gives us like a more modern or maybe easy uh way to understand it and then we saw how Paul blasphemed um uh the Holy Ghost uh Jesus even after uh the crucifixion and yet he was still forgiven he was the chief of Sinners so he's the pattern if God can save the lowest God can save you and I so don't ever think God don't have power to save you God can save to the uttermost Hallelujah because he already saved the chiefest the wickedest of Sinners according to the infallible Bible Hallelujah and then we looked at different examples of people that have left the presence of God we saw how the Jews blasphemed and uh we'll we'll kind of pick up there now I I think it was God's grace but I didn't finish the story of the Lutheran Dean so I'm going to finish that here as we start part two I almost texted that for everybody but then I forgot you know by God's grace and we ended with that quote that's a beautiful quote so I'm going to start with that the quote was uh there's a woman she's weeping that light fell right over her what makes her act like that that woman's been so nervous till the Devils even tried to tell her she's cross the separating line that's right Blackness hangs around her but she's healed now so see the Holy Ghost will go to people that are hurting and Inspire them anoint them and set them free Hallelujah and she was crying tears of joy oh I am saved Hallelujah Jesus Loves Me I came here to listen to God's Prophet Hallelujah so how could I be lost I want to hear God's prophet and she gets healed while listening to God's Prophet so beautiful beautiful uh quote there Hallelujah now here's the ones that were I also read previously you say brother brandom I've been so sinful I believe I've crossed a separating line no you haven't or you wouldn't be here tonight how can he make atonement for me I broke my marriage vows I've done this that the other but the man said he's Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice if you're beyond hope if you've broken every commandment if you've done everything there is in the Bible that you ought not to do but besides blasing the Holy Ghost God has a sacrifice provided for you he's Jehovah Gyra he Alters all circumstances Hallelujah and then the last one here is maybe you think you've crossed a separating line you can't be saved that's wrong as long as you got enough God about you to come here to this church tonight there's hopes for you to be saved so as long as a spirit of God's dealing with you think about that church did God deal with you at any time this week oh you shouldn't have thought that you shouldn't have said that shouldn't have went there should bought that right if God shouldn't have watch that right if God dealt with you one time he's still dealing with you Hallelujah proves you're saved now let me finish the quote I I didn't get to finish the Lutheran quote I I showed how brother R prayed for he and he said brother baxer prayed for 72 college students and church they were all on their knees facing uh the wall they were all lined up against the wall praying fill me with the Holy Ghost fill me with the Holy Ghost and brother said they went on laid hands on every person and every one of them got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Hallelujah we got to get down to business with God hallelujah like I told you before I got the Holy Ghost I'd cry out for it I'd go up and have prayer meetings all by myself in my upper room expecting to see angels and then God God gives me the Holy Ghost the day after I get married hallelujah hallelujah so we thank God for his Amazing Grace just keep crying out to God hallelujah now here's the ending to it brother Braham said I went laying hands on each one and all 72 students and the dean receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now remember what did this man do he called brother brandham a devil worker souser right so this is a great example of how a Believer can say harsh words out of ignorance and yet God will forgive their ignorance when they call the work of God the work of Satan now look now look how look how this man was hungry for God he drove through a snowstorm to he brother random and then that wasn't enough when he got discouraged he wrote him a 20-some page letter and then that was enough then I want a face- to-face meeting see if someone really loves God they're going to keep going after God until God shows them the truth hallelujah see look see all of his actions proof he wants the truth he's hungry for truth so God can look on his ignorance of saying that evil thing it was a completely Blasphemous thing but just like Paul God had ignorance I'm sorry God had mercy on him because he was ignorant he just didn't know enough and church all of us fall into that category in some ways tonight we're probably ignorant of something God's going to teach us in the future so we better watch our words uh and just be humble and be open to correction because we don't know it all I don't know it all nobody knows it all except our savior knows it all Hallelujah and brother Ram brother Ram even forgave him and said I'll forgive you for calling me a souser and the Bible gives you authority to do that whosoever sins you remit they'll be remitted so Church think of your loved ones that have spoken evil things pray for them and ask God to forgive them and tell them if you get a chance tell them I forgive you for saying that Hallelujah we must we must remember to do that now I'm going to give a a simple Bible foundation and I'm going to be heavy quotes tonight all right so hopefully you write down some of these quotes go look them up you'll like them I'm going to eventually Lord willing make a video on this and then you can just listen to brother tell all these wonderful stories good I got 45 minutes to rec quotes all right glory to God hallelujah now think about these people that that are blasing the Holy Ghost Cain left the presence of God did he ever return no that's proof he he he Blas him the Holy Ghost right that's proof that's one of the proofs he left the presence of God Genesis 4 never came back Judas left the presence of Jesus did he ever come back no never came back everybody see a pattern here brother Chris you got a question yeah he has died yeah he was a werer yeah right no good good it was for his life but he lived a long time he probably lived probably lived over 900 years probably some some I don't know if the Bible actually gives the number of years yeah like all his contemporaries around him Liv 900 some years so he had an awful existence because he left the presence of God great question question and so uh 1 John 21:19 John says don't worry about don't worry about the serpent seed Church they'll go out from us because they are not of us I just gave you two examples the serpent seed will not remain in the presence of God look at all these people leaving the message and I'm not I don't know God I don't know where they stand with God but if they blaspheme it and they don't get right with God something shows their they're showing their colors in other words because brother baham preached the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Braham re uh point us back to to the lie I'm sorry back to the truth uh that God's one person not three and if they leave and call God three persons and they leave and fornicate and adultery all these things like that their their actions prove which side they're on and if they blaspheme the Holy Ghost and don't repent and and it wasn't done ignorantly well that shows what side they're on as well Hallelujah so notice they went out from us just like Cain just like Judas because they were not of us hallelujah for if they been of us they would have no doubt have continued with us for they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not of all us see see uh God Likens us unto either a wheat seed or a tear right eventually we're going to manifest which side we're on Amen and that's what he says here and so the Gathering Together to church is so important the church you go to is so important because it shows which side you're on Hallelujah that's according in the Bible uh pull up Luke 4 Jesus never missed church he was always in church that was his his habit was to always come to church I don't remember the verse I think it's around 16 but I could be wrong maybe it's 13 his custom was always to be in the house of the Lord oh 16 yes 4:16 and he came up to Nazareth where he' been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read now Jesus had good Customs he had good Traditions do you think he ever skipped Church no no he was always in his father's house Hallelujah so again the sinners will leave the Gathering of the True Believers the serpent seed will leave the Gathering of True Believers but the seed of God will stay with the Believers now people can leave our church if they disagree with me that's fine but just go to a good church right now if you came against me you you know I'm going to preach on you after you leave that's what Jesus did Jesus did don't you know these Pharisees did this don't you know Judas did this don't you know that because people have to know what sin is and what righteousness is that's that's right now Judas left church Judas the Scar left and then on the day of Pentecost how many got the holy ghost out of the 120 all very good let's say all ready all everybody there got it hallelujah amen what a promise amen the elect were in one place and one Accord and if that's the second Exodus what about the Third Exodus hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah what a blessing what a confirmation it gives us God's going to drive out all the goats so that the sheep can remain in the Sheepfold Hallelujah now this is and this is not with any uh bitterness but I just heard back today from bradam Tabernacle the the structure we visited uh Victoria and Caris it's been finished for a long time that multi-millions probably tens of millions of dollars have built that uh Tabernacle and I said I just said is it finished and are you gathering together and the answer was yes it's been finished but the pastor doesn't feel led to gather physically and I thought that's so sad you spent millions of dollars for what the people need a place of worship so the per the pastor doesn't feel led well the word never lead you that way and your dad brother brandham never LED you that way so who's leading you that's a good question I believe it's an evil spirit but I've got the word and the prophet to agree with me Hallelujah and remember those who follow the prophet will be doing like revelation 22 the spirit and the bride and the prophet will all be saying the same thing and the same thing will already been said in the word of God hallelujah oh church we ought to be encouraged tonight we're the bride Hallelujah we stay with the word hallelujah people can say whatever they want and I appreciate the brother for sharing I said thank you God bless you I always said I said thanks for sharing that with me but it just reveals what what kind of thinking is that for someone remember just to compromise on one word look at all the sin we got today from Eve now Adam has a part in that but look and to compromise on that then that's just one of those I made a video with 24 24 sins that's just one of them there's 23 more Hallelujah didn't the Bible say a little leav Lev's the whole lump Glory now I'm off of that now okay you can relax now God can handle our harsh words remember this I preached on this a while ago job said some really harsh things about God I'm just going to do one but job 33:12 job was harsh against God and Joe and David was harsh against God and God forgave them you know what God can handle your mind battles God can handle your bad words right like I gave you the example of me growing up and this uh this friend who said uh that those words on Sunday about the Holy Ghost just just in ignorance right but that person I could I could take that person I could show you in that person's life they're so faithful to God they make such sacrifices to God maybe more than me maybe more than me and I'm not saying I got a lot but I'm just saying I'm a pastor I'm supposed to make sacrifices for God that doesn't mean I'm perfect or anything or I'm so great a person I'm not I'm the least of the pastors that's why I got a small church amen that's the way I look at it but I could show you and say my what a testimony and in one moment of weakness or one moment of being in the flesh do you think that one moment will will will will negate all these other things all these other proofs that the person's a real believer of course not one little moment and then the person's like I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Lord forgive me forgive me do you think God will hold that against a person absolutely not God remembers we're just dust right there's a part of us that's just dust there's a part of us that's Fallen Hallelujah God wants to see us humble ourselves and repent but look at this behold in this Thou Art not just so job's on Earth saying God you're not fair what the the judge of Eternity the judge of Heaven he sticks up his finger said you're not just I will answer the that I will answer thee that God is greater than man there's so many and and remember Allah who rebukes him I I didn't get through all the scriptures but Allah who has to rebuke him you're exalting yourself above God church he called himself greater than God he's more fair than God a man a Believer and then in heaven God's saying he's perfect he's perfect now how can you be perfect only by the blood hallelujah how can you be perfect how can you go to heaven only by the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and yet in heaven God already recognized him as perfect because the blood and because God sees him as a finished product but then God's got to come down and say who is this God God's quoting his name in heaven to the devil God's bragging about him in heaven and then comes down to earth and say who are you God likes to keep us humble Hallelujah but on in heaven Your Love brother Chris amen sister Zer sister Naomi sister Kristen sister Lydia sistera you're loved in heaven Hallelujah we all got to get our correction on Earth but we are are loved in heaven Hallelujah David complained numerous times now we're not going to read but Psalm 22 David said why have you forsaken me did God forsake Him no but David's telling God you forsook me I'm sorry God doesn't do that verse uh Psalm 55:2 attend unto me and hear me I mourn in my complaint and make a noise so he's not just speaking it he's making some type of noise that go along with it oh life is so hard oh life is so hard in leoa oh will I ever get through my tough life we got some of the best lives you could possibly have in the history of the world right yet when we complain we make noises we shouldn't make right that shows they're insane and ignorant they never met in other country so they wouldn't know uh Psalm 771 I Cried unto God with my voice even unto God with my voice and he gave here unto me in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord my sord ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted I remembered God and was troubled I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed say you think God can uh forgive Asaf for that sure yeah y every Believers complain sometimes and what's the difference between complaining and then lying like Abraham what's it I mean it's still sin right Psalm 102 verse1 a prayer of The Afflicted when he's overwhelmed and porth out his complaint before the Lord hear my prayer oh Lord and let my cry come unto thee it's okay to say sometimes I complain to God but just remember at the end of it say God be merciful to me cause me to Hope in your promise cause me to look past my current circumstances help me to raise up in faith with eagle eyes and see beyond my circumstance and know that I'll get through this eventually by your grace hallelujah amen Psalm 142 ver1 a prayer of David a prayer when he was in the cave I Cried unto the Lord with my voice with my voice un the Lord did I make my supplication I poured out my complaint before him I showed him my trouble when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me so see when we feel overwhelmed we can pour pour out our complaint we can pour out our feelings to God and as long as we have respect for God as long as and even if we make a mistake God will forgive us hallelujah because we'll ask for God's forgiveness we'll feel the pole of the Holy Spirit see it's the holy spirit that moves on you and says oh I'm sorry Lord forgive me that's God's spirit praise God if you didn't have the spirit of God in your life you wouldn't ask for it praise God thank God you got it hallelujah thank God you got the spirit of God uh with you to say you're sorry and God take me back take not your Holy Spirit from me let your spirit remain on me anoint me Hallelujah Psalm 44:23 awake why sleepest thou oh Lord sound like anybody else you know Elijah oh maybe you're God sleeping out there well now I don't know if this is David's Psalm or not I forgot to look that up but the the the prayer is like God uh could you wake up and hear me do you think God's taking a nap right now do God I get tired on a Wednesday night have to take a nap look at the prayer of this guy Lord uh could you wake up and help me isn't that a little disrespectful but yet it's in the Psalms for us to learn from sometimes we think God sleeping God's not sleeping but God lets us utter foolish things God lets us utter sinful things to correct us and to teach us for the next time around uh why you sleeping God Arise cast not us off forever oh oh so now God's cast me off no God's never cast us off but we complain like he has and yet God has Mercy on us wherefore do thou hide thy face does God hide his face from us no the thing is we leave God's face it's not God God's always there God's always ready to forgive pardon quick to Pardon we're the ones yeah go God's always knocking can I ask some fellowship good brother you got the knocking sign there God always wants to come in and have Su with us hallelujah uh and Lord did you hide your face and forget our Affliction did you forget me God did God forget us Church think of these things think of the words that come out of our mouths Lord you forget me you're sleeping didn't hear my prayer no the Bible tells us when he doesn't hear our prayers when we ask selfishly every other time he hears it my soul is bowed down to the dust and my our belly cleaveth under the Earth I'll stop right there five uh Psalm 10 verse1 why standest thou a far off oh Lord why hidest thou myself or thyself in times of trouble so it's almost like God when I need you God you go hide yourself and you don't want to help me like we're fighting this fight all by ourselves uh no we're fighting a battle that's already been one hallelujah praise God Amen sometimes in our foolishness we utter well God left me and I'm just here all by myself I'm I'm I'm just out there like David no Christ was in David the anointing was on David hallelujah we're never alone but yet sometimes we act like it sometimes we say it out loud is God going to forgive us of that yeah you better believe it of course God's going to forgive us of that Psalm 13:1 and I'm going to move on hope this a good review for you by God's grace let's be careful what we say about God God's not asking for Perfection he's asking us for humility and then he's asking for Christlike character Hallelujah obey the word next time to the chief musician a Psalm of David how long wilt thou Forget Me Oh Lord forever what a thing to say God's forgot me are you going to always forget me for the rest of my life Lord now the truth is God never forgot him how long will thy hide they hide thy face from me oh yeah I see God you don't you're just hiding your face and I'm praying but you're hiding you're either sleeping or went off somewhere no that's not the kind of God he is he's the faithful God he's a loving God hallelujah he's like a father that pies his children Glory so we see church that we sometimes utter things that are foolish there's a scripture uh yeah go to uh Jeremiah 29 here this is a familiar one then I'm going to look up a quick verse here all right there it is Glory Hallelujah all right okay Jeremiah 29 look at verse 11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayth the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end in other words if you love God God's going to give you an expected end you're you're going to know where you're going there's not going to be any surpris on the day of judgment for us hallelujah because you know God God God knows you God loves you he's going to tell you exactly where you're going to go Hallelujah going to heaven Hallelujah but what's your job Church verse 12 and 13 is your job and 14 then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I'll hearken to you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart see what your job to seek God with everything you got every Sunday yes every Wednesday yes I'm giving him everything I got Hallelujah I got to go to work I gotta eat I got to do all these things I got to make food I got to take care of my children I got all these things but with everything else that I got I'm G to give that to God hallelujah verse 14 and I'll be F found of you sayith the Lord so God promises if you put everything into Christianity you'll find him Hallelujah he ain't going to hide from you right he a ain't going to go to sleep on you he promises I'm right there and you'll know exactly what I'm going to do with you you know exactly where you're going you know exactly uh that heaven is your future home Hallelujah glory to God Amen and if he did that for Jews how much more for the bride under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah who is actually his bride now here's the one I want to bring up I forgot this is what I went looking for uh Psalm 130 verse3 four five these are all good this is a short chapter I like I like to do that it's like it's like eating a good supper here Psalm 130 verse3 if thou Lord sh Mark iniquities oh Lord who shall stand now remember iniquity is what you know you did wrong you uttered something you know it's wrong but listen Church you know we can't let the devil beat us up you said that then you said that there you've got to ask for forgiveness and trust that God forgives you Hallelujah because if God made a list of all Jesse's iniquities that he did wrong I wouldn't be able to stand neither would you that's why the blood washes it all way Hallelujah no one could stand none there's none righteous no not one I love that verse Romans 3:23 there's none righteous so we all need a savior we all need forgiven we all need Grace Hallelujah verse uh four but there is forgiveness foress with thee that thou mayest be feared so see if you utter something evil and you know God's forgiven you then that makes you fear God more you'll be slow to speak quick to listen if you got a mouth if you run your mouth like a motor and you got a machine gun mouth and that just you've always been like that you just run your mouth God will let you say such awful things but if you love him he'll forgive you and he'll teach you not to be a motor mouth anymore he'll teach you to be soft spoken it'll teach you to respect God and keep your mouth shut can I say it like that when you ought to coming off kind of harsh tonight Hallelujah but we need that lesson not to just utter things without thinking about it wait on the Lord let the Lord put a word in your tongue Glory verse five I will wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope so see what are you hoping for for salvation what are you hoping for if I cross the line are you hoping the devil's right or you hoping Jesus is right you're hoping God's right hope in the word hallelujah we must put our hopes in the word I may not be preaching necessarily to everybody here tonight just because of the uh the kind of the response I've been getting but just trust that you got to Hope in the word don't hope in the mind battles don't hope for the worst hope for the best Hallelujah and Jesus has the best Hallelujah Glory now I just made this point earlier you have to strengthen your weaknesses right so if you utter something uh God will forgive you uh but then it teaches you to fear God and to prepare for the next battle that's what uh Chris had a good testimony he was watching this this older man and this older man was anointed he was powerful on the video and he was speaking things about trusting in God and repenting and getting right with God and Chris said it gave him a complete victory in that moment is that right brother absolutely let's thank the Lord for that amen not even a desire that's what God did to me glory to God hallelujah thank god let's thank God again hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen see and I've had people sh share different things about my videos when they watched a video it set them free from that and they got Victory that's what God's doing there now we thank God for that Hallelujah and now like I told our brother now you got to fortify now you got to make this the the mind so strong with the word of God that when that Devil comes back and it's going to be seven times more tempting I showed it to you earlier Jesus told us he he's going to Satan's going to try to make it seven times more tempting you got to be ready to turn him down right yeah you start feeling it come back yes yes sing it brother memorize it do do everything fill your mind with God's word it will never fail see and remember you got to take revenge on the devil pull up 2 Corinthians 7 uh 11 this is for brother Chris he's as a new believer it's for all of us though when we all get struggles when you repent you got to have such an attitude I'm going to defeat the Devil the next time he comes he won't embarrass me again for behold the selfsame thing that ye sawed after a Godly sort what carefulness are wrot in you yay what clearing of yourself see clear yourself from that past sin and what indignation so you got to get angry anger at the Devil that's okay and what fear see fear for God what vem desire yay what Zeal what revenge and all these things you prove yourself to be clear in this matter so you got to be ready when the Devil Comes again you got to be ready to take revenge on him Satan you caused me to take that drug and and and and make myself in this awful condition but now I'm ready to put you in your place Hallelujah I'm ready to take revenge on you and I'm not going to do anything uh to I'm not going to take any man-made thing to change my mind I'm going to take the word of God and change my mind hallelujah amen I'm going to use the word word of God to bring me joy power Victory give me relief Hallelujah the word brings relief that's right uh 1 Peter 5'8 says you better be vigilant in other words you better be paying attention like a soldier who's looking for Invaders you better be V Vigilant watching watching for the devil to try to slip into your life ready for him to come in be sober vilant because your adversary the devils like a roaring lion walking about sinking him he may devide so he's like a lion and now the next time he comes brother Chris he's going to be seven times bigger so picture a lion that you you fought off that line right through that video the de the Lord helped you fight off that devil but now that Devil's going to come back seven times bigger one double three four five and you got to be ready but you've got the most powerful weapon there ever was known in the whole universe you got the word of God the word of Jesus Christ Hallelujah all you got to say is Satan get behind me you're an offense to Jesus Christ my Lord Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah we got a good lesson this I've I shared to you before but in First Kings 20 uh Ahab got a victory over Ben haad but in First Kings 20:22 the prophet came and told him strengthen your position and see what must be done because next spring the king of amram will attack you again so Ahab got a word he's coming back Hallelujah so after his uh defeat Ben haad regrouped and prepared for the second attack now Ahab did some prepar now this is Ahab Ahab married to Jezebel the painted up face Jezebel even he could take some instruction if he could take instruction we should take full instruction Hallelujah to prepare ourselves we know the devil's coming back at the time of War which is the next season could be tomorrow he did he gathered his forces Ahab gathered his forces and fortified his position however he his strategy was less confident than it could have been uh the battle that ensued was a decisive one but God intervened on ahab's behalf giving Israel Victory once more so the victory really wasn't because of Ahab it was because of God protecting Israel Hallelujah that was the battle Simon preached on with uh the god of the hills and The Valleys they said oh God's not the god of the Hills God's and then God comes and says yes I am the god of the hills so he come to back up Israel for his name's sake sometimes God fights for his name's sake Hallelujah just to prove to the devil that he is God hallelujah well that's a good example there's two examples Ahab and the Lord Jesus said once you defeat the devil get stronger because the devil's going to come back seven times hotter it's going to be seven times more seductive or seven times more pleasurable but you got to be willing to fight and you got to fight by the word of God hallelujah now let me let's look I'm going to go some quotes here here the last few minutes here by God's grace I try to give you some good quotes brother ramam said in presuming 1962 down in their heart there's a desire and father Satan wouldn't put a desire in their heart to do right Satan would put a desire in their heart to do wrong Satan would say continue on uh don't go up Let it alone don't believe it that's what he would say so now you know who's talking to you when the holy spirit says come on up do something about it don't stay in that condition change your circumstance Hallelujah go to God pray that's the Holy Ghost working on you you haven't crossed a line you're a child of God hallelujah Glory investment 63 uh July no August 3rd if you've got something in your heart for God and won't express it and so forth just keep putting it off well later on later on and that little desire that you once had to serve God will be taken from you the devil will come in and steal that away and then you won't have any desire to serve him so if you have the least desire he says there must be something that even brought you to this breakfast this morning there is something faith comes by hearing hearing of that word amen and there must be some desire or you wouldn't even have been here now don't let that desire Trinkle off into some little I'll join a church I'll shake a hand or I'll be sprinkled or I'll be something out there let's find the real firm that's established something that's really all right the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so don't don't just come to God get filled with God's spirit praise God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1952 he's in a he's in a a discernment he says I seen a vision break before me of a young lady she went back there and sat down a few moments ago and she thinks that she's crossed a separating line don't let Satan tell you that so see you got to write you don't have to listen to Satan he's going to try to tell you lots of things don't listen to him he's a liar listen to God he'll always tell you the truth hallelujah he'll always show you the way out of the trial Hallelujah don't let Satan tell you that as long as you love God God still loves you it has to be a Creator to create that Creation in your heart to make you love God why do you why do you feel that Love in Your Heart A Creator created that in there why do you love God why do you think about so much why do you think about God all the time because God put that desire there so You' serve God hallelujah don't believe Satan no go believing Jesus with all your heart that Christ loves you so you got a choice you can either believe the devil or believe that Christ loves me I'm going to believe the Bible for God so loved the world Hallelujah I'm one of those remember Jesus even said Jesus said whosoever will let him come I'm one of those whosoever's he said If any man thirst let him come and drink I'm an any man you're an any woman anybody can come to Jesus and you know he won't turn you down hallelujah amen he said and in no wise in no way would I turn anybody away will he refuse me a home in heaven no not one just sing that all the way home he won't refuse me a home in heaven because he loves me he's a lovely Jesus Hallelujah he said sister God bless you Sister Satan's been dealing with you making you nervous telling you cross telling you you cross the separated line and everything like that he's lied you're going home to be well the darkness has all left you now you can go home and be made well God bless you see Church you got to remember when you going through mind battles like that it's Darkness around you you got to get away from that darkness and I know just a place to run right here on your knees in prayer Hallelujah run to Jesus and that Darkness will leave you'll feel it lift Hallelujah Jehovah Gyra 1955 brother man's praying father will you bring that poor wandering back slider back no wonder if he's setting out lied and condemned feels maybe he's crossed a separat line no he hasn't your spirit's still calling as long as it calls you're wanting your wondering child to come home won't you grant it tonight father that the Holy Spirit bring conviction to the audience and bring many wandering children to thee Oh Glory to God Amen now here's a couple brother Ram says here's when you know you've crossed the line brother R said he met a woman in a uh a meeting one time and brother said young lady I believe God's calling you tonight sister she said if I want somebody to talk to me i' want somebody that's got more sense than you brother B said well sister I can only say what the holy spirit's telling me she said I don't want to hear no that no more a year later I passed through the city and the girl become a prostitute her clothes hanging low on her offered me a drink of whiskey I shamed her and she said you know what preacher you remember the night you told me I ought to be saved I said said yes I do she said that was the truth I've crossed the separating line there I've grieved God from my heart like the last time she said I could see my mother's Soul fry in hell like a pancake and laugh at it so see this is when someone has cross the line no more care for God no more care for even their mother see Church see we're not like that we love our moms amen we love our we love our siblings we would never want to see anybody go to hell except the devil and all his Fallen Angels Hallelujah we want to see anybody to go to hell but that's how she knew she'd crossed the line no more desire to get right with god brother said your cons this is a new quote different quote your conscious uh this I didn't put the didn't put the sermon down that's strange I must forgot your conscious even tells you that's the truth unless you've crossed the separating line you cross the separating then you've got to be given over to the mind of the devil delusion to believe a lie and be damned by it thinking you're right so here's someone else that's crossed the line they believe a lie they think they're right and they're they're they're under a delusion and they won't accept anything in the word of God right that reminds us of Romans chapter 1 okay oh yeah here's another one a third one the mark of the beast 1956 he said brother have you sinned so far and cross the separating line till you think that's foolish don't you think it's or do you think it's not the word of God have you gotten that condition or have you still got a little tinkling in there the door isn't all the way closed so see brother says a reprobate mind says the Bible's foolish they'll say it's foolish I don't care who burns in hell that that's a reprobate mind you wouldn't say that because you're saved Hallelujah brother bam said yes say you say yes brother I believe it's a truth and this morning I accept it and from this day henceforth I mean by the grace of God to make my life different Hallelujah see a child of God says Lord let your spirit make my life different when I leave this church amen make me more like you make me a better Christian I accept the promises of God but ra said I now raise my hands to Jesus Christ and ask him to be merciful to me and let the flow of his life come into me and make me a newborn baby in the kingdom of God so my life will be like his life amen he says will you do it tonight and raise your hands to Christ God Bless you that's as simple as as it is do you want Jesus Christ to fill your life do you accept his life that's all you got to do to get right with God Amen all right this is a little longer one but I'm going to skip to the main parts of it well here let me read this one first brother Raam said Judas only played church at the end he wasn't sincere he would have never betray betrayed Jesus he sowed that se of discrepancy he thought he could make friends with the world Mammon and also have friendship with Jesus that's what he did I I think I can go be friends with the Pharisees and I can also be friends with Jesus and I can take their money to betray Jesus no you can't do that you can't betray the word and then think the word's going to save you so look that's the attitude of someone who's crossed the line I can betray the word and then the word will still well well he didn't care but that that's what he would have thought before him hand well the word will still forgive me and I can still make money by betraying the word I can play for both teams no you can't I can love both people no you can't you only love one or the other Jesus says brother Chris yeah it was set in stone because it was God's predestination right because uh for us we don't know who's predestinated but in God's eyes uh Paul said God has he it's like in heaven it's almost like now he didn't do this but it's like he made Vessels to honor and vessels to dishonor so Judas in God's plan was always a Dishonored vessel he was always going to be lost just like Pharaoh Esau uh balum Cain they were always going to be lost but God was pleading with them God was pleading with them not to do it Jesus even called him friend right so they they plead with him and then Judas heard him preach for three and a half years you know he saw he saw all those Miracles and that was God's mercy to him so see that that's the mind of a rep probate well I can make money by betraying the word and I can leave the word and I'll I'll still go to heaven no you won't now here's a good one I think you like this one 1958 contending for the faith now a woman comes into his presence he said don't be shook up because you feel a little strange feeling but it's a glor glorious feeling he said that's not me that's him that's that's not me it's your lord he said be reverent please he said you've had real funny feelings goes through you all the time and especially real late of a evening anybody bad a late evening stuff isn't that right I see you you're sitting down in a chair kind of late in the evening you get tired you can't do work okay so this is an evil spirit coming on her at night time she can't work isn't that right causes even a stomach condition in you so you can't work it's at night and your stomach hurts every night like acids and things when you drink coffee oh I like that and something another on that like you belch up acids out of your stomach so stomach pain at night time that's right I see you moving away from the table where there's stuff like that on by the window near window is that true raise your hand if that's true now something here knows your life I told you how the Bible that Jesus Christ did the same thing did he not right he discerned the woman at the well uh Andrew and Peter nuh Nathaniel he discerned them he said I see a real dark shadow following you too which is the devil and he's almost tempted you to Suicide sometime telling you you'd cross a separating line and that you wasn't never going to be saved is that right now raise your hand she ra raises her hand so see all the stomach pain the night time no energy uh C uh coughing things up spinning things up all this had caused her to feel like she should just commit suicide the devil's saying you've already crossed the line why would this be happening now he says but now sister if I can by the grace of God make it leave you now will you believe him brother BR said now you probably never was any closer to in your life than you are right now to Jesus Christ he says feel that real humble sweet feeling is all around you like something near not your brother but something Supernatural raise your hand it's the angel of the Lord and I'm living now in another dimension in the spirit world I want to pray for you while this anointing now the very thing that's here knows your life I see you I see you now I see you way back as a little girl you're a little girl you're running from something it was something chasing you it was a dog it seemed like you was coming from school or something long ago scares you you've been nervous like all your life that is true isn't it see just more I talk to you the more Vision will show now for the sake of these others let us pray dear God author of Life Lord Jesus who will judge us all at your coming knowing that we're eternally bound people and we'll have to meet you someday standing here in your presence and knowing that right now here at the platform is the spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead confirming every word father Thou Art so lovely he says is he lovely tonight because you make manifest those things that are true you speak the truth and the lady stands here when she's tormented by an evil spirit that's trying to get her to commit suicide and do things wrong but Thou Art here to remove this father and I pray according to Thy word which said you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it I know that your word is true so Satan you evil one that's torment and our sister I adure Thee in the name of Jesus Christ the Living God come out of the woman he said now look this way something has happened to you you're weeping you don't feel like you did do you you feel happy now feel good is that right raise up your hand and you're going believing you're going to be well go home and serve the Lord now run along just be real happy and it won't come upon you no more let's say thanks be to God praise God Hallelujah so God had God had to show brother R the very start of her nervousness and then it just continued all these years where God had almost commit suicide but the Holy Spirit discerned and showed her where it started it showed the root of it and then when God showed her where it started she remembered it it showed her and and it made her realize that Jesus Christ knew her life Jesus Christ loved her Jesus Christ forgive her Jesus Christ wants her to be well Jesus Christ don't want her to commit suicide and she was set free by Jesus Christ Christ hallelujah hallelujah I mean I've heard many testimonies about that over the years brother Brian Hawkins is one of them you know a different people coming to church and the preacher will preach exactly what their life's been like we just saw that last summer in uh Iowa people preach uh and it'll the sermon will tell their whole life that's what the Brother come upet on Sunday morning in De Mo he said You Preach my beginning of my life from the beginning of your sermon to the end you preach my whole life well no wonder he's crying all over the place he knew God was talking to him and see in that presence in that recognition in that Vindication that God is there the person can see the mercy of God the love of God because I didn't know that man from Adam I didn't know that guy from Adam I don't know what they're going through I just preach what the Holy Spirit put on my heart when I couldn't sleep the previous day I tried to take a nap and I couldn't take a nap God said you're not taking a nap you need to write down these sermon notes so I spent my nap time when I went to nap writing down the sermon notes but it was God writing down that man's life and we preach his life by the spirit of God and the man was set free Hallelujah and the next Wednesday I saw him on the live stream he's up there clapping looking around say is this wonderful he's clapping and praising the Lord hallelujah I'm trying to close here it's 8 o'clock all right let me uh just do a couple more now Church we always well I'm sorry now we always think about the side of when people go over into reprobate right we always think about the side of you know Judas and Cain and but so sometimes we forget to look at the other side brother Bram said have faith in God believe him with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength have faith in God if thou C believe all things are possible see Church there's times God is going to challenge your faith to believe you've got to believe right that's what Jesus did many times he said if you can believe all things are possible but other times like in John 5 Jesus did the miracle and the man didn't even ask for a miracle let's let's pull it up John five so see you got to recognize when is the spirit of God challenging you and if he's challenging you accept it but it's got to be really God not just the preacher you understand sometimes preachers will say things they're just doing their best but it might not be for you but you got to know when is God speaking to my heart how you know he'll tell you the secrets of your heart that's how you'll know let's go to John 5 just so you know this man never asked Jesus to be healed this man uh uh Jesus doesn't say oh you don't got enough Faith he Jesus just does the miracle verse six when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said to him wil thou be made whole impotent man answered him now look he don't even say yes or no he don't even say say yes he just says sir he don't even call him Lord he just says sir he he didn't have the Revelation he was Lord or son of David or son of man or anything he just said sir this proves God can do whatever he wants when he wants no doubt God knew he wanted to be healed but he didn't ask for the healing right here he doesn't call him son of David Son of God he doesn't say he don't call him Lord he just says serve I have no man when the water is troubled to put me in the pool he just talks about his problem problem s he just gives God the reasons why he can't get healed and that's enough for God Oh Glory hallelujah amen when God wants to do something God's GNA do it Hallelujah you can't stop him and sometimes you don't have to ask him he'll just do something to bless you Hallelujah that's my God that's how good God is hallelujah for when I'm while I'm coming another one Ste down before me so he just gives him two excuses why he can't get well and Jesus said well I'm greater than your excuses I'm the way maker when you don't have a way I'll make a way for you verse eight Jesus said to him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked on the same day was the Sabbath anybody ever see him asked for healing in this whole conversation he never even asked for it God Jesus knows he wants to be healed but he don't even ask for it Jesus just does it so see there but then there's other times he said if you can believe believe all things are possible to them but you got to believe so there's times he's going to challenge your faith and you got to raise your faith there other times he's just going to do it because you're faithful Hallelujah let me finish this quote what did it brother Braham brother Bram had nothing to do with it what did it the woman's faith in the resurrected Lord Jesus that's all the supernatural one just let your faith Fly Away with him tonight look what he says let your faith fly away just get into his arms and move away how do I get into jesus' arms uh start kissing him didn't the Bible say kiss the son lest he be angry in other words just start saying Jesus I love you I love you so much you've been so good to me thank you for dying for me just start doing that you're G to start loving him Hallelujah you're going to move into his arms church when when when we're we're praying at the end I'm just going to add this in I don't have to be the only one praying out loud you can pray out loud too you have just as much right to pray to Jesus out loud as I do we've all you know and I'm so loud I think sometimes our church is just naturally quiet because I'm so incredibly loud and we're in such incredibly small room right that's how cam Cam's loud I'm loud so maybe I'll feel like all all the years well brother Jesse is loud enough and I don't I don't want to be loud I don't want to make it more loud it's already loud enough in here but just let me remind you you can pray out loud too it don't have to be just me praying out loud you can talk to Jesus Hallelujah I know he hears your prayers I know he hears your prayers your quiet prayers too he hears my quiet prayers too but there's nothing wrong uh just get into his arms and move away just leave this old quacking World Behind I'm not sure where he got that quacking from me must told a story about those Ducks cross he said cross the separation line between faith and unbelief and move off into Faith so many million miles Beyond this chattering of the world here saying the days of Miracles has passed and Jesus died and that settled it he rose again amen 2,000 years has passed and he's here yet tonight in Chicago he said when the ends of time pass and time shall be no more when every Star stops shining and when the moon melts and flies into space and the world is no more Jesus Christ will still be alive Hallelujah so brother man said just start loving Jesus and you'll fly so far on the other side into faith you'll know you're saved because you'll be flying lying up in Heavenly places Hallelujah you he said you'll cross that line into faith you'll cross the line in other words you'll get sealed into the kingdom of God hallelujah hallelujah that's why we need some saints here to tell Jesus how much you love him you can tell him that it don't have to be just me it can be you telling him that that's what he wants he wants you to fly off and cross that line where am I lost or am I saved he wants you to cross that line so far where you know you're saved and that when the stars stop shining and the stars fall to the Earth you'll be in the Loving Arms of Jesus up in heaven oh thank you Lord Amen brother man said sure you say I'm excited I'm not excited I'm happy I got something to be happy about my faith is coming closer in God I find out God's done so many things for me he's Vindicated a work around the world around the world through every critic I'm beginning to believe think about this that what I ask he'll do it brother say my faith is getting so strong I believe if I ask he'll do it I believe I'm such a friend of Jesus he'll actually answer my prayers and the church said Hallelujah I I've crossed so much into Faith I've been I've cross over into being such a Christian I just believe brother Chris is going to hear my prayers Hallelujah that's what we need a Crossing into Oh Glory I love this oh brother's talking about Elisha what did Elisha do to prove he was on God's side what did he do he sold off all of his his his Ox right killed him Ser served him as food he sold out everything brother BR said now that's that shows you how a prophet should do it he burnt every bridge as we call it he killed the ax took the yolks and the plow and made a sacrifice to the Lord showing that all of his Earthly doings were over he was completely sold out to the Lord that's why you know when ha got the Holy Ghost she said that week she threw all the pants out of her closet Hallelujah remember brother Aman told that story you think he got the TV three he got the TV and the video games three separate times but each time the Holy Spirit told him to get rid of it yep he didn't get the Holy Ghost till got rid of it the last time there's got to be a last time amen oh thank God Amen if we can get to the last time I'm struggling with that I'm cutting that off for the last time I'll never go back to that you'll cross over into this land of Faith Hallelujah that's right Church oh he's completely sold out to the Lord that's the kind way every man and woman that comes to Christ ought to completely sell out and get rid of sin and put everything behind them cross the separating line and look only to God from them on what a difference it would be in every man and woman if they would do that am so there's another way one way is just make make love to Jesus kiss his feet love him and you'll fly off and cross the line into Faith another way is to sell out everything and give Jesus everything I'm deleting every every contact that's not a good contact right I'm getting rid of every immoral thing in my life I'm getting rid of I'm confessing my sin to everyone I know I've sinned against I'm I'm selling out I'm burning every bridge if they don't want to be my friend they don't have to be my friend as long as Jesus Is My Friend then you'll fly off and cross over into Faith Hallelujah last one last quote looking at the Unseen 1958 if there ever was a time the church need to step across the line which separates you between faith and unbelief by sight and looking at the Unseen by faith it's now of course that's when you leave everything behind every care what are you caring about tonight Church what's caring that takes you away from the Lord every weary what wearies you tonight that you don't have enough faith for everything that says you can't be a Christian i've smoked too long I smoke I've drank too long I drank alcohol brother random I've lived in adultery I've never done that brother said I don't care what you say and what you've done though your sins be as Scarlet you once pass that barrier of the devil trying to torment you saying you can't do it you can't do it just tell the devil say I can do it for Jesus said whosoever will let him come and drink from the Waters of the Fountain of Life freely leave that sin behind let's stand to our feet musicians you can come see God don't care what you've said God don't care what you've done God's here to forgive you God's here to strengthen you God wants you to be so far crossing the line on the side of faith that there's not even a question you're going to go back to the other side are you going to struggle yes you'll struggle sometimes but you can be so far on the side of Faith well you'll just confess and get right back in your walk with the Lord Lord how many want that kind of a crossing over that's a crossing over I believe I've had but I got to keep reaffirming it in my life how how so brother Jesse die daily I got to keep dying daily I got to be diligent right not to be taken over with with Temptations and snares of the world I got to be diligent because the Roaring Lion's coming back seven times stronger but you know what I can be seven times stronger too because I got the word of God Hallelujah uh don't the Bible say you go from Faith to Faith doesn't the Bible say you go from glory to glory so see the devil gets seven times stronger I get seven times stronger too in fact I get I go eight steps he only goes seven I go eight seven attributes and then the Capstone the Holy Ghost I'm eight times bigger so see he ain't so scary anymore because God's built me up too God's built you up how many want God to build them up amen we better fill we better fill our lives with the Holy Ghost with the word of God if we want to overcome Satan this day we're living testimonies of that we've got to have the power or else seven times worse is going to happen seven times worse the addiction will be seven times worse if we don't get the word of God filling our minds is that right you better listen to brother brandom you better uh read your Bible you better pray you better take notes you better highlight your Bible you better do everything you can do to fill yourself with the power of God hallelujah that's right church that's why when I get up you get up we got to pray right away read our Bible right away put brother random on right away whatever you can do I know as mothers you can't always do uh certain things I know if you're working early you can't always do certain things you're working third shift but you better fill your mind with God's word as soon as you can let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you for today Lord God thank you for your mercy Lord God as that scripture says Lord if you would Mark iniquities who could stand nobody could stand Lord God so Lord we don't stand upon our works we stand upon the grace of God we stand with the full armor of God on WE repent of our sins and we put back the belt of Truth on then we put on the helmet of salvation the breastplate of righteousness the feet shod with the preparation of gospel of peace we put on the shield of faith and we take the sword of the spirit hallelujah thank God for arming us for battle Lord God thank you Lord for these quotes from your Prophet thank you Lord for these Bible verses Lord that direct us to the truth of your word God give us a spirit of revenge against the devil so we won't fall back into trials Lord into Temptations Lord Jesus Hallelujah may we love you so much that we'll cross over fully into Faith Hallelujah be so far from the separating line there'll be no question which side we're on Lord let us remember they went out from us because they were not of us let us gather more with the Saints as we see that day approaching Lord God let us make our calling and election sure let us be diligent Lord

them and your spirit will never let them go Hallelujah Lord you're able to keep us from falling Lord God you're a able to save to the uttermost Lord God you're able to give us faith and an expected end we'll expect to be saved we'll expect to be in the Rapture we'll expect to be the Bride of Jesus Christ let me have that kind of Faith Lord God let each person have that kind of Faith here tonight I ask it in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said how many appreciate the word of God tonight let's thank God for the word of God Amen thank you for sending brother Brandon hallelujah thank you Lord for sending us a prophet like that
