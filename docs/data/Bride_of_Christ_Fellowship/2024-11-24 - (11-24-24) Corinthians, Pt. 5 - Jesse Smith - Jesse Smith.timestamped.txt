[0:00] Corinthian series Believe us part five
[0:02] uh by the grace of the
[0:05] Lord we'll read verses one two and
[0:09] three it's kind of where we left off
[0:11] last week we took a little skip ahead to
[0:13] chapter 13 I got some good feedback on
[0:15] that so I was thankful to the Lord
[0:17] helping us to understand the love of God
[0:19] a little deeper Hallelujah just what we
[0:21] need on life's journey is the love of
[0:22] God hallelujah so let's read 1
[0:25] Corinthians chapter 2 1 2 and 3 by God's
[0:29] grace
[0:58] here we see the amazing character of a
[1:00] prophet of God the first church age
[1:02] messenger uh I would we' call him the
[1:05] great St Paul now he wouldn't call
[1:06] himself that but we would call him that
[1:07] because we appreciate God's servants
[1:09] give them double honor but let's look at
[1:12] here the character of St Paul God's true
[1:14] servant Hallelujah I'll read uh one and
[1:18] two and then we can all read three
[1:20] together and we'll be seated there by
[1:21] God's grace and I Brethren when I came
[1:23] to you came not with Excellency of
[1:24] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:27] the testimony of God
[1:30] for I determined not to know anything
[1:32] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[1:35] crucified let's read three together 1
[1:36] two 3 and I was with you in weakness and
[1:40] in fear and in much trembling may God
[1:43] add His blessings to the reading of his
[1:44] word you can be seated praise
[1:48] God hopefully this will work AAA because
[1:51] I'm going to plug it into the right
[1:52] place today
[2:01] Hallelujah so we want to continue on
[2:03] here by God's grace okay that's going to
[2:05] be
[2:06] good glory to God uh we we didn't read
[2:09] the four we just read the three but I
[2:11] thought I'd shorten it a little bit just
[2:12] to preserve some time here today so
[2:14] we're going to look at uh chapter two
[2:16] here we're going going to go right
[2:17] through by the grace of the Lord and the
[2:18] thoughts that the Lord put on my heart
[2:20] for this chapter I would like to preach
[2:21] them trust it'll be a blessing to you
[2:23] today Hallelujah so we looked at the
[2:25] introduction uh verses 1 through uh
[2:27] chapter 1 veres 1-9 the Believers
[2:29] standing and Grace Paul offers this
[2:31] church that was so full of mistakes he
[2:34] starts off by giving them so much grace
[2:36] Hallelujah brother Ram said that's how
[2:37] we ought to correct people first tell
[2:39] them how much we love them how much we
[2:41] appreciate them tell them what we're
[2:42] thankful for he said then you bring the
[2:44] correction after that so we see that
[2:46] modeled here in the scripture Paul talks
[2:49] about how they stand in Grace they have
[2:50] every gift they need he has Grace and
[2:53] peace for them but then in chap I'm
[2:55] sorry chapter 1 vers 10 he begins the
[2:57] correction on their divisions we looked
[2:59] at that and we'll continue to look at
[3:00] that today here by God's grace so
[3:02] chapter 1 was broken down into three
[3:04] sections the believer standing in Grace
[3:06] then you looked at the divisions in the
[3:07] church as far as who baptized them Paul
[3:10] said he was glad he baptized none of
[3:11] them other than guas and Crispus and
[3:14] then we look he looked at he ended the
[3:15] chapter by looking at Christ is the
[3:17] wisdom and power of God he hid all these
[3:19] wise things uh the mind of God he hid
[3:22] that from the wise and prudent of this
[3:24] world and revealed it unto babes such as
[3:26] would learn Hallelujah aren't you glad
[3:28] to be a baby in Christ today Hallelujah
[3:29] I'm not talking to immature I'm talking
[3:31] about just a humble CH uh child of God
[3:34] who has childlike Faith so let me just
[3:36] state that again we're children of God
[3:38] we're babes in Christ because we have
[3:40] childlike faith not that we're immature
[3:43] so in one way I'd say we're babies in
[3:44] Christ another way I'd say we're mature
[3:46] in Christ so does everybody understand
[3:48] that we're babes as far as we want to
[3:50] have childlike Faith but we're not babes
[3:52] as far as immature and giving into uh
[3:55] sins as we'll get to all these sins that
[3:56] we see in the Corinthian Church that's
[3:58] not kind that's not the kind of a bab we
[4:00] want to be Hallelujah in our spiritual
[4:02] life we want to be mature Paul says but
[4:05] as far as just our approach to God we
[4:07] want to have childlike Faith Hallelujah
[4:09] so chapter two he said and I Brethren
[4:11] when I came to you I came not with the
[4:13] Excellency of speech or of wisdom now
[4:16] he's not talking about the wisdom of God
[4:18] I'm going to emphasize that
[4:20] today because Paul always had the wisdom
[4:23] of God as we said on Wednesday what
[4:25] better W gift is there than wisdom
[4:27] there's none as far as the nine gifts
[4:29] the the greatest gift you can have is
[4:31] wisdom Hallelujah wisdom manages all the
[4:34] other gifts so Paul's talking about
[4:36] something different uh he's talking
[4:38] about worldly speech like worldly
[4:40] knowledge and worldly wisdom uh he
[4:43] declared unto them the testimony of God
[4:46] and he determined not to know anything
[4:48] among the Corinthians save Jesus Christ
[4:51] and him crucified and he had a good
[4:53] reason to do that of course this was the
[4:55] city of Corinth this was like a a port
[4:58] there where a lot of a lot of trade
[4:59] happened it was a very wealthy City and
[5:02] uh I forget how many millions of people
[5:03] were there it was it was a center it was
[5:05] the Roman Center of of that part of of
[5:08] the of the Kingdom uh as far as uh that
[5:11] area near Italy it was the I'm sorry
[5:13] further from Italy and so it was a very
[5:15] important place to be as we'll see here
[5:18] because because the Corinthians they
[5:19] highly valued public speaking and we get
[5:22] a glimpse of this I love this we get a
[5:23] glimpse of this in Acts
[5:25] 17 and when we look at acts 17 we see
[5:28] Paul and Athens which was only 50 m away
[5:31] so Corinth and Athens were very close
[5:34] and we we can see how Paul would come
[5:35] amongst many intellectual type of people
[5:38] or people that were into uh awful sins
[5:41] you know uh but yet were rich and had
[5:43] all these uh extravagant lives we can
[5:46] see how Paul would approach a group of
[5:49] individuals how many believe Paul had
[5:50] the power of the spirit how many believe
[5:52] he had the power of the spoken word
[5:55] that's right he did the Bible said it it
[5:56] was was plain but he but when he came
[5:59] mon of Corinthians he didn't come like
[6:02] like all these sophists or these orators
[6:05] that you would see in in Corinth and in
[6:08] Athens because that was uh they were
[6:10] kind of uh living off the glare of the
[6:13] Greek society right the Greeks magnified
[6:15] worldly wisdom and new ideas and
[6:17] intelligence and and eloquent speaking
[6:20] uh and human dramatic speaking but they
[6:23] lacked the power of God with the word of
[6:25] God hallelujah so that's what we'll see
[6:27] here uh you know just look at the EXT it
[6:29] was a Cosmopolitan City and it was known
[6:32] because it had so many
[6:34] intellectuals and they they placed such
[6:36] value on being a a good orator and a
[6:39] philosopher and public speaking were
[6:41] highly
[6:42] valued so you know they didn't have the
[6:44] internet in those days so they just
[6:45] couldn't go on the news and oh I wonder
[6:46] what's going on on X I wonder what's
[6:47] going on on Instagram you know uh
[6:51] hopefully you don't say CNN or MSNBC you
[6:53] know but they couldn't go on there they
[6:55] had to go out in the streets and they
[6:57] would hear uh these people talking they
[6:59] spend their time out uh in in the The
[7:01] Centers of the city and they hear people
[7:03] discussing ideas and sharing the news
[7:06] and that's how uh Corinth grew it it
[7:09] grew of course as a trade City but also
[7:11] this this worldly wisdom and they
[7:14] presented themselves I like that they
[7:15] presented themselves as wise and
[7:18] eloquent right but we know the the
[7:20] smoothest talker of all of them was the
[7:22] devil but he was the the father of Lies
[7:26] he was so smooth he could convince Even
[7:29] Adam to fall into
[7:31] sin individuals children of God that
[7:33] have never sinned before but he was such
[7:35] a smooth apparently a wise and and
[7:38] eloquent type of serpent he could
[7:40] convince them to sin Hallelujah that
[7:42] that's how slick and Sly brother Ram
[7:44] says that's how subtle the devil
[7:47] is he would they would use sophisticated
[7:49] arguments and pers uh persuasive speech
[7:52] to attract
[7:53] followers and these speakers often focus
[7:56] on the style persuasion and
[7:58] entertainment rather than the substance
[8:00] of their message now we see that amongst
[8:02] you know mega churches today and I'll
[8:04] just say like this you know Joel oin is
[8:06] probably the most uh uh stylish and
[8:10] persuasive and eloquent preacher I've
[8:12] probably ever heard but he's lacking
[8:14] substance he's lacking genuine
[8:16] repentance he's lacking sanctification
[8:18] he's lacking the baptism of the Holy
[8:20] Ghost so just being able to be eloquent
[8:23] doesn't qualify you as a man of God we
[8:26] want to be you know as as clear as
[8:28] possible uh we don't want to bring any
[8:30] reproach upon the gospel but God's not
[8:32] requiring human eloquence or or the
[8:34] style of a of a person's uh speaking
[8:37] ability or their personality God's not
[8:39] interested in man's personality God's
[8:41] interested in the character of his word
[8:44] hallelujah and God's not trying to
[8:46] entertain us God is trying to bring us
[8:48] truth God is trying to show us his
[8:50] presence Among Us that will recognize
[8:52] his
[8:53] presence so in this context of Corinth
[8:55] Paul was choosing deliberately to avoid
[8:59] Pol polishness being so polished and and
[9:01] every word is spoken particularly right
[9:03] and there's no stutters and there's no
[9:05] forgetfulness and it's just a beautiful
[9:07] memorized sermon Paul's specifically
[9:09] trying to avoid that because that's what
[9:11] they were used to that was from the
[9:13] world but Paul said I'm not from the
[9:15] world I come from Christ Hallelujah I
[9:17] was sent by Jesus Christ as a teacher of
[9:20] the Gentiles as an
[9:22] apostle and he wanted to show that he
[9:24] did not rely on human wisdom or
[9:26] eloquence or persuasive techniques but
[9:28] on the power of God that's what I and
[9:30] every Preacher Brother Cam and Simon and
[9:32] and brother Brooks and we must all uh we
[9:34] must all rely on the power of the Holy
[9:36] Spirit I'm not relying on that I know
[9:39] your your your needs I don't rely on my
[9:41] ability I'm trusting God to speak to
[9:43] every person like every service praise
[9:46] God whether it's a Wednesday night or
[9:47] Sunday night or Sunday morning I'm
[9:48] trusting in God I know I have no ability
[9:51] of my my own no preacher does but if we
[9:53] can just yield and let the Holy Spirit
[9:55] uh have his way and if each person can
[9:57] get hungry for God and we can be unified
[10:00] then we'll be in one place and one
[10:01] Accord and the spirit of God can
[10:04] move I just put that picture now they
[10:07] probably had a lot more Idols than that
[10:08] the Bible said uh Paul went there and he
[10:10] saw all there was like just a row of
[10:12] Idols there was all these kind of Idols
[10:14] so when when Paul when Paul came to
[10:17] Corinth is very similar to
[10:19] Athens right and what's the first thing
[10:21] he tells these these ID doubters and
[10:23] remember all these wise men sit around
[10:24] just all the time just saying new things
[10:27] he said I perceive that in all things
[10:29] things you're too
[10:31] superstitious you got all these wrong
[10:33] spiritual
[10:34] ideas uh you you got these ideas that
[10:38] there there's no really uh uh there
[10:40] there's no really foundation for them
[10:42] and our foundation is the rock of God's
[10:44] word Jesus is the rock hallelujah and
[10:47] Jesus said we must build our lives upon
[10:49] the rock of Christ Hallelujah his word
[10:51] amen and see he passed by and he he was
[10:55] watching them worship now of course they
[10:56] would have had an idol probably on every
[10:57] stone here you know you see some Idols
[10:59] up there
[10:59] he was watching their worship and
[11:02] remember these are all great speakers
[11:03] these are all uh can I say it Ted Talk
[11:07] people these are all college professors
[11:11] these are all Mega preachers and they
[11:13] could speak so eloquent so well and what
[11:16] would a prophet of God share he'd say
[11:19] you know I watched your devotion and I
[11:21] found an altar to the unknown God he
[11:23] said that's the one you ignorantly
[11:26] worship right so they were worshiping
[11:29] God they call him the unknown God but it
[11:31] was without understanding they didn't
[11:32] know that that's the really only true
[11:34] God there's no need to worship all these
[11:37] other gods so they would take time
[11:38] they'd worship the god uh of the Hebrews
[11:40] which we know was Jesus Christ
[11:41] eventually became Jesus Christ in the
[11:43] flesh body but but he he tried to
[11:46] correct them you're too superstitious
[11:48] too many different spiritual ideas you
[11:50] should get all your wisdom from the mind
[11:52] of God from the word of God hallelujah
[11:54] and then he ends by saying you know in
[11:57] God we live and in him we move and we
[11:59] have our being as certain also of your
[12:02] prophets have said for we are also his
[12:04] offspring now look at this he tries to
[12:06] connect no even some of your speakers
[12:08] have talked about how we're The
[12:09] Offspring of God and he so he tries to
[12:12] he tries to say well you guys believe
[12:14] this and that's what the truth is
[12:15] there's some truth in what you believe
[12:18] but you don't believe all the truth you
[12:20] have to accept all the truth of
[12:22] God for as much then as we are The
[12:25] Offspring of God we ought not to think
[12:27] that the godhead is like a under gold or
[12:29] silver right or a statue he said or
[12:32] stone Graven by art or man's device he
[12:35] says and the times of this ignorance God
[12:37] winked at but now commandeth all men
[12:41] everywhere to
[12:43] repent now notice how can and brother
[12:46] Austin and Mal and I have talked about
[12:48] this these Street Preachers that we
[12:49] admire we admire their courage right and
[12:51] what what what do we admire when their
[12:53] arguments bring people down to their own
[12:55] sin what's the whole point of of
[12:58] preaching out in the streets what would
[12:59] be the whole point to get people to see
[13:01] their Sinners they need their sins
[13:03] forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ
[13:06] Hallelujah that's the whole point this
[13:08] is the power of the Gospel the power of
[13:10] the Gospel is to bring the reality of
[13:12] Christ sacrifice to the Forefront of
[13:14] every mind so realize we are guilty and
[13:17] if not if we don't repent of our sins
[13:19] we're going to hell but there's good
[13:21] news Jesus Paid the price and we can go
[13:23] to heaven and live with him if we repent
[13:25] of our sins Hallelujah the good news of
[13:28] the Gospel so what would a prophet of
[13:29] God what would a church member say to
[13:31] the most uh eloquent and the most uh
[13:34] influential the richest uh the the the
[13:37] most uh famous people what would he say
[13:40] he said you're too superstitious it's
[13:42] time to repent Hallelujah and so see
[13:45] church we ought to be encouraged when
[13:47] the Holy Ghost comes Among Us and tries
[13:48] to get us to repent of our sins to
[13:51] remind us that if we're still battling
[13:53] if we're battling we need to overcome
[13:55] and God can give us Grace for our our
[13:57] trials our weaknesses he can make our
[13:59] weaknesses strong
[14:01] Hallelujah that's right and then he
[14:03] closes by saying because he has
[14:05] appointed a day in which he will judge
[14:06] the world in righteousness by that man
[14:08] so he says you need to repent and you're
[14:10] going to come to the
[14:12] Judgment every every person will stand
[14:15] before Jesus Christ every knee shall bow
[14:18] every tongue shall
[14:19] confess Hallelujah God ordained Jesus
[14:23] Will judge the world Hallelujah and he's
[14:26] given Assurance to all men because he
[14:28] raised him from the dead so now he
[14:31] brings in the resurrection he brings in
[14:33] the death Resurrection repentance what
[14:36] would you say to the smartest most
[14:38] eloquent uh richest uh Aristocrats you'd
[14:42] bring them to repentance the death
[14:44] burial and sacrifice of Jesus Christ
[14:47] that's what Paul said to the Corinthians
[14:48] right he said it right there I I decided
[14:50] I didn't I wasn't going to know anything
[14:52] among you except Jesus Christ and him
[14:55] crucified Hallelujah and when they heard
[14:59] of the resurrection of the Dead some
[15:01] mocked and others said we will hear
[15:03] again the again of this matter so Paul
[15:07] departed from them anybody see any uh uh
[15:09] casting out Devils
[15:10] here is there any uh uh bloody flux here
[15:15] uh healed like he did on the island of
[15:17] Mita did he uh did he cast out any
[15:20] Devils out of any Sorcerers no but what
[15:23] did he have the wisdom of God what do
[15:25] you think did he have the wisdom of God
[15:27] did he have the power of God yes he had
[15:29] to know he just came to plant some seeds
[15:32] and remember he's going to plant but
[15:33] somebody else might come around and
[15:35] water those
[15:36] seeds right but then who's got to give
[15:38] the increase God's got to give that if
[15:42] God wanted a demon to be cast out God
[15:43] would anointed Paul ready to go and that
[15:45] person with a demon would have been
[15:47] ready to be free from it and wanted to
[15:48] be free from the demon power they would
[15:51] want Satan out of their house amen
[15:54] that's how we got to look at this he
[15:55] didn't walk on water he didn't try to do
[15:57] anything uh
[15:59] anything Supernatural because he wasn't
[16:01] led to do it he was led to give them the
[16:04] wisdom of God to tell them repent
[16:06] believe the gospel Jesus died for your
[16:08] sins then he rose to forgive you and
[16:10] you'll face Jesus someday
[16:12] hallelujah how many believe that's the
[16:14] power of God the Bible say some believe
[16:17] some
[16:18] didn't because the it's the preaching of
[16:20] the Cross that's the power of the Gospel
[16:23] to save them that would believe
[16:25] hallelujah it's the power of God so I
[16:27] know that's the power of God for us
[16:28] today Hallelujah and so Paul when Paul
[16:31] went to the Corinthians how did he come
[16:33] he was in weakness and in fear and in
[16:35] much trembling which was the opposite of
[16:38] all the or many of the preachers they
[16:40] were used
[16:42] to
[16:44] Hallelujah and uh remember I'll pull
[16:46] some scriptures here they were used to
[16:48] having uh the most eloquent preachers so
[16:51] uh it seems like some of these eloquent
[16:52] speakers there in Corinth you know some
[16:54] maybe some of them got saved they
[16:55] started getting to the church they
[16:56] started preaching and teaching you're
[16:58] going to see it they had 10,000
[17:00] instructors look at this next verse
[17:01] though you have 10,000 instructors in
[17:03] Christ that's quite now I know he's
[17:05] exaggerating but that's quite a few
[17:06] guest ministers they had in
[17:08] there I I want to kind of limit Our
[17:10] Guest ministers right for financial
[17:12] reasons but also doctrinal reasons right
[17:15] we just don't let we just I don't open
[17:16] up my Pulpit to anybody hallelujah it's
[17:19] got to be someone that's been tried
[17:20] that's been tested someone I prayed
[17:21] about and and then if they fail the test
[17:23] they won't be back anymore right but
[17:26] Paul said I didn't come the same way all
[17:27] these other preachers are preach to you
[17:29] because because you have 10,000
[17:31] instructors in Christ but not many
[17:32] fathers for in Christ Jesus I begotten
[17:35] you through the gospel so a lot of these
[17:38] people were were born again under Paul's
[17:40] Ministry or heard about Christ through
[17:42] Paul's Ministry and he calls himself a
[17:45] father to them Hallelujah and then you
[17:47] know the next letter the second
[17:49] Corinthians 11 he says for such are
[17:51] false Apostles deceitful workers
[17:53] transforming themselves into the a
[17:55] Apostles of Christ so Paul says you've
[17:57] got these false uh false Apostles right
[18:01] among you it's actually the devil
[18:03] transforming himself trying to
[18:05] impersonate an
[18:06] apostle and they let them preach in
[18:09] their church so how does Paul Come Paul
[18:12] comes in weakness trembling and fear
[18:14] Paul comes in humility not with uh the
[18:17] most eloquent words and the most
[18:19] beautiful sermon and the most deep
[18:21] intellectual thoughts Paul came with
[18:23] repentance
[18:24] Hallelujah right then look at verse 20
[18:28] this is the one that met so much to me
[18:29] when I preach on the doctrines of devil
[18:30] series Paul said they allowed the
[18:33] Corinthian Pastor who is this pastor
[18:35] brother Austin we got to look this guy
[18:36] up in heaven did he make it to Heaven
[18:38] this pastor
[18:40] allowed men to bring them into
[18:43] bondage right with with
[18:45] legalism like a legalism was oh you can
[18:47] only wear long sleeves you can never
[18:48] wear short sleeves at church so don't
[18:51] don't everybody look down at your
[18:51] sleeves it don't matter here it doesn't
[18:53] matter here but they would take them
[18:55] into bondage or your dress has to be uh
[18:58] this many inches above the ankle or
[18:59] below the ankle there's churches like
[19:02] that you know thank God we're not a part
[19:03] of it but but Paul said look what you've
[19:05] allowed you've allowed preachers to
[19:07] bring you into legalistic thoughts and
[19:10] they devour you they take away uh all
[19:12] your joy all your Victory Hallelujah and
[19:15] then the preachers exalted themselves
[19:18] and he said he said they they even let
[19:20] the preachers disrespect them right to
[19:22] their face disrespect the
[19:25] people but see Paul said I've got to
[19:27] come different than the the way these
[19:29] false preachers are coming I got to come
[19:31] in the humility of Christ
[19:34] Hallelujah and my speech in my preaching
[19:37] was not with enticing this means
[19:38] persuasive words of man's Wisdom but in
[19:41] demonstration of the spirit and in power
[19:43] so see when Paul went to Athens now this
[19:45] is different but when Paul went to
[19:46] Athens he demonstrated the gospel by
[19:48] telling you you're superstitious you
[19:50] worship the god the true God a little
[19:52] bit but you need to repent and God's
[19:54] demanding you to repent that's the power
[19:57] of the Gospel he said came in the
[19:59] demonstration of the power of the Gospel
[20:01] now we know in Corinth people were
[20:02] healed uh Paul Jesus told Paul you have
[20:04] much people in this city we know there
[20:06] was signs Miracles and wonders as well
[20:09] but I want you to see what Paul's
[20:10] setting up here he's setting up the
[20:12] power of the Gospel will be different
[20:14] from a a false gospel a man- centered
[20:17] gospel instead of a word- centered
[20:19] gospel Glory now remember God's not
[20:22] against a man being eloquent no preacher
[20:24] was as eloquent as Apollos and that's
[20:27] true because that's what the Bible says
[20:28] about him the bi if when the Bible names
[20:30] a couple things about him he's eloquent
[20:32] and he was mighty in the
[20:33] scripture okay so there's nothing wrong
[20:36] with uh speaking perfectly and and
[20:39] getting every word right and and citing
[20:41] every verse approximately or completely
[20:44] accurately there's nothing wrong with
[20:46] that God's not against eloquence but
[20:48] God's against the enticing words or the
[20:51] the lying persuasive words brother R
[20:54] called them subtle lies as I preached to
[20:55] you a few weeks ago uh from the Rapture
[20:57] 1965 here's where he said it he said
[21:00] these Protestants now these these uh
[21:02] doctors of a Divinity they said oh the
[21:04] Bible's nothing but a book a history of
[21:06] the church and they didn't have it in
[21:08] literature till about 250 years ago it's
[21:10] always been the church now he's talking
[21:12] about exalting denominational tradition
[21:14] instead of the word they're saying oh
[21:16] well we haven't had the Bible that long
[21:17] so see before that we just we just
[21:19] relied on Church
[21:21] tradition they said oh it it was it's
[21:23] the church not the Bible the Bible's
[21:26] just a a history of what the church did
[21:28] he said what a subtle lie that
[21:31] is right and I'll just say like this oh
[21:34] we've got the tapes we don't need the
[21:35] Bible anymore what a subtle lie that is
[21:39] we got some subtle Liars around the
[21:40] message right the same lying Spirit
[21:43] Hallelujah I love a brother said I was
[21:45] looking up in the unveiling of God they
[21:47] had someone remember someone tried to
[21:48] tried to trap brother Bram and they said
[21:50] well surely uh with all the experience
[21:52] of you had uh you can tell us the
[21:54] revelation of the seven Thunders and
[21:55] write a new Bible right and brother BR
[21:58] said that was the devil trying to trap
[21:59] me I said but you're wrong he said yes
[22:03] I've had experiences but revelation 22
[22:05] says you can't add one word or take one
[22:08] word away Hallelujah so brother man
[22:10] caught that lying spirit that subtle lie
[22:12] that would try to break something in the
[22:14] word of God he caught it by the
[22:16] discernment of the Holy Spirit that's
[22:19] right what a subtle eye why we had the
[22:22] Bible for 3,000 years the old
[22:23] testament's been written in the
[22:24] scripture for hundreds and hundreds of
[22:26] years before the coming of Christ just a
[22:28] subtle thing of the devil so you get a
[22:30] smart man or intellectual man or
[22:32] something like that and they they talk
[22:34] so well they can just bring any little
[22:36] lie upon people and people just say uhuh
[22:39] how many of you are checking what I
[22:40] preach on Monday morning anybody
[22:42] checking me who's checking me on Monday
[22:45] night or who's checking me Tuesday
[22:46] morning you ought to you ought to make
[22:49] sure that what I say is the word of God
[22:51] hallelujah and you got a chance
[22:53] sometimes once a week to ask me about it
[22:54] so I appreciate that that's what I want
[22:56] I don't want to ever exalt myself where
[22:57] I'm untouchable I can't be questioned I
[22:59] can always be questioned
[23:02] Hallelujah now Paul's not talking about
[23:04] you know uh uh he didn't have God's
[23:06] wisdom or and this is where a lot of
[23:08] people uh mistake they mistake the Bible
[23:12] and even quotes from God's Prophet
[23:13] brother brandham brother R preach a
[23:15] sermon uh wisdom versus Faith yeah
[23:18] wisdom versus faith and and so people
[23:20] say see faith is greater than wisdom
[23:22] he's not talking about Godly wisdom he's
[23:24] talking about worldly
[23:26] wisdom Hallelujah
[23:28] wisdom versus faith I think it was 61 if
[23:30] I'm not mistaken I've heard it
[23:32] before but he's not talking about faith
[23:34] is greater than wisdom now love is
[23:36] greater than Faith Hallelujah we just
[23:38] preached on that last week and the
[23:39] church said these three but the greatest
[23:42] of these is
[23:43] Charity but see people misunderstand it
[23:46] so let's not forget the scripture get
[23:48] wisdom get understanding forget it not
[23:50] neither decline from the words of my
[23:51] mouth forsake her not and she shall
[23:53] preserve thee love her and she shall
[23:55] keep thee if you love the wisdom of God
[23:58] God's wisdom will keep you in difficult
[24:00] times it'll protect you wisdom is the
[24:03] principal thing with therefore get
[24:05] wisdom with all you're getting get
[24:07] wisdom we put so much effort into trying
[24:10] to make a living right keep things clean
[24:12] and and get our get nice clothes we put
[24:14] all this effort in this but the Bible
[24:16] said with all your efforts get the
[24:18] wisdom of God have a make so make sure
[24:21] you have a time where you're trying to
[24:23] get the wisdom of God Sunday is a great
[24:25] day to do it amen but Monday and Tuesday

[24:29] Hallelujah exalt wisdom and she will
[24:31] promote you Hallelujah who wants a
[24:33] promotion at work don't raise your
[24:35] hand God's talking about a spiritual
[24:37] promotion here now I see where they get
[24:39] it they talk about getting a spiritual
[24:41] promotion exalt her I see a I see a
[24:43] promotional stack right there the statue

[24:49] honor when you Embrace her so God will
[24:52] honor you when you embrace the wisdom of
[24:54] God I wisdom now where did wisdom start
[24:57] wisdom started dwelling with God in the
[25:02] beginning I wisdom dwell with prudence
[25:04] and find out knowledge with witty of
[25:06] witty inventions I love them that love
[25:09] me and those that seek me early shall
[25:11] find me that I may cause those that love
[25:14] me to inherit substance I will fill
[25:16] their Treasures what a promise and the
[25:19] church

[25:23] beginning and if you love God's wisdom
[25:25] God will fill you up with treasure

[25:45] wisdom if you hold on to wisdom and
[25:47] embrace wisdom he'll fill you with
[25:49] treasure she'll fill you with treasure
[25:50] speaking of the the feminine attribute
[25:52] Hallelujah the Lord possessed me in the
[25:54] beginning of his way before his works of
[25:56] old wisdom was set up before from
[25:59] Everlasting from the beginning before
[26:01] the Earth was wisdom was there with God
[26:04] which we would say is the logos of God
[26:06] it's the Holy Spirit the visible Holy
[26:07] Spirit Christ Hallelujah Christ means
[26:10] the anointed Hallelujah so the visible
[26:12] the the uh the manifested spirit of God
[26:15] the visible spirit of God the logos of
[26:17] God is the wisdom of God and church well
[26:20] what are we left with the heart is
[26:22] deceitfully wicked above all things and
[26:24] desperately wicked who can know it
[26:28] don't you some some sometimes we see
[26:30] this on a daily basis my goodness
[26:32] there's still wickedness in me and the
[26:34] church
[26:35] said wow this sin nature is so wicked
[26:38] this I hadn't even thought about that
[26:40] the devil placed that right there I I
[26:42] wasn't even looking for I wasn't even
[26:43] trying and the devil tries to place all
[26:45] these traps and snares but through many
[26:47] snares and toils we've come but God will
[26:49] bring us through every one of them
[26:51] Hallelujah Grace will bring me through
[26:52] Grace will lead me home
[26:54] Hallelujah I was reading in Ezekiel and
[26:57] it's the same in Jeremiah God rebukes
[26:58] them because they they prophesy lies
[27:01] from their own Hearts their own
[27:03] imaginations how long shall this be in
[27:05] the heart of the prophets that prophesy
[27:07] lies yay they are prophets of the deceit
[27:10] of Their Own Heart people lie in the
[27:13] name of the Lord people lie and say the
[27:14] Lord told me this or the Lord led me to
[27:16] do this he'll never lead you to sin
[27:19] hallelujah hallelujah that's your
[27:21] deceitful heart and you're trying to Mas
[27:23] mask your sin uh by calling it from the
[27:25] Lord right God will never lead you to
[27:28] into the sin and so see Paul was saying
[27:31] don't focus on the messenger focus on
[27:34] the message like brother Ram said oh if
[27:36] he's
[27:37] praying if they could forget the
[27:39] illiterate Messengers and remember it's
[27:41] not the messenger it's the message he's
[27:44] come down again with us in the form of a
[27:46] pillar of light and he moves with the
[27:48] same Miracles same signs nothing out of
[27:50] the Bible saying right with the Bible
[27:53] holding it under subjection bringing out
[27:55] his glory showing his power blessed be
[27:57] his holy name I know you must think that
[27:59] I'm crazy but oh that blessed Eternal
[28:01] rest that's in my soul though storms may
[28:04] wave my anchor holds within the veil
[28:07] amen so brother said over and over again
[28:09] don't look at the messenger look at the
[28:11] message and church don't you know the
[28:13] same is true today how many believe the
[28:15] pillar of fire is here amen if anything
[28:18] could ever be done here that would be
[28:19] any good it had to be Jesus Christ in
[28:21] the form of the pillar of fire
[28:23] hallelujah amen cuz I have no power you
[28:25] have no power you have no Authority or
[28:27] or we we we say power of yourself to do
[28:29] anything we must be led of God to do
[28:31] anything praise God but if God's spirit
[28:33] was with brother raham then God's spirit
[28:35] is with this word hallelujah because
[28:37] we're preaching the same message brother
[28:38] Randon preached hallelujah
[28:41] amen he said Lord stand with the church
[28:44] who prayed with me and stood by me in
[28:46] the times of trouble Lord I love them
[28:47] and I offer my prayer that they will
[28:49] look to you Lord may they look away from
[28:51] this Mortal clay of a servant brother
[28:52] man saying may they look to him who is
[28:55] the omnipotent who is and we know Lord
[28:57] that we are finite no matter who we are
[29:00] we're still mortal but not the messenger
[29:02] but the message Grant it Lord that's
[29:04] where we point to Jesus Christ the son
[29:06] of God grant that he'll be so real to
[29:09] everyone here today even to the little
[29:11] children little
[29:12] children that he will become the
[29:14] absolute of the entire congregation we
[29:17] ask it in Jesus name amen gr granted
[29:21] Hallelujah that's what that's what we
[29:22] must realize Christ is here today to
[29:24] help us hallelujah Christ wants to
[29:27] minister to you he said wherever two or
[29:28] three are gathered there I am Hallelujah
[29:31] he came to set us free he came to
[29:32] deliver us to give us wisdom whatever we
[29:35] have need of he's here to help us
[29:37] hallelujah because he's the absolute
[29:40] Hallelujah said a few months later if
[29:42] you haven't got that absolute now get it
[29:44] if You' like to have that absolute that
[29:46] Assurance in your heart of the Holy
[29:48] Spirit raise your hand and say I want
[29:49] something that'll punctuate the word of
[29:50] God and I can see the word of God
[29:52] manifest he said it's all over the
[29:55] building see when people are responding
[29:57] when people are are hungry for God when
[29:59] people are in need of the word of God
[30:01] the Holy Spirit can move all over the
[30:03] building Hallelujah Oh my he said I'm
[30:06] only telling you the truth friend don't
[30:08] let it pass you by I'm nothing I'm your
[30:10] brother don't you pay any attention to a
[30:12] messenger you watch the message don't
[30:14] watch the messenger God will take it
[30:16] away from you now that's why I believe
[30:17] God took brother B at 56 years old think
[30:19] about that brother William isn't he 73
[30:21] now or
[30:23] 72 73 amen hallelujah and you know but
[30:27] God took brother at
[30:29] 56 why we don't know but this I think
[30:32] this is a clue he says he will share his
[30:35] glory with nobody that's right don't you
[30:37] watch the messenger watch the message if
[30:40] a man run in here and he might be black
[30:42] yellow brown ragged if he's got a check
[30:44] for you for a bank draft for a million
[30:47] dollars you wouldn't care what color he
[30:49] was or how he was dressed it's the
[30:51] message he has for
[30:53] you remember said now don't look at the
[30:56] grammar and the things you just remember
[30:58] I'm telling you about Jesus Christ who's
[31:00] here now you believe him with all your
[31:02] heart don't you fail to believe him
[31:05] Hallelujah
[31:07] Glory now I want to break this this is a
[31:09] famous uh sermon brother I don't know if
[31:12] you've heard it perfect strength by
[31:13] Perfect weakness it's a very long sermon
[31:15] but brother Ram lays out a lot of
[31:16] beautiful things how we must all we must
[31:19] all live by the power of God and we can
[31:21] we have no ability to trust our own
[31:22] human strength he talks about Moses
[31:24] Moses made all these mistakes Paul made
[31:27] all these mistakes uh he said and see we
[31:29] we must live by the power of God when
[31:31] we're weak in ourselves and we know we
[31:33] have no strength then we can be strong
[31:35] amen so it's about it's like we talked
[31:37] about last Sunday children taking up
[31:39] your cross and following God who was it
[31:41] was it Eden said how do I crucify myself
[31:43] or how do I how do I take up my cross
[31:45] and
[31:46] follow you cannot give into any desires
[31:49] of the flesh you must crucify them you
[31:52] must take the word of God you must
[31:54] believe God's word you must obey the
[31:57] word of God
[31:58] so I'm going to break into just a few of
[32:00] these quotes brother baham said you know
[32:02] he's he's in paragraph 82 of this sermon
[32:05] and he breaks into 1 Corinthians chapter
[32:06] 2 so when I was reading this this this
[32:08] memory came to me I've never preached
[32:10] this full sermon but maybe I'll have to
[32:11] by God's
[32:13] grace he said but Paul had to forget all
[32:15] he ever knowed in order to know Christ
[32:18] let's see what he said himself about
[32:19] himself what he had to do this man was
[32:21] trained he could speak pretty near any
[32:23] language there was in the
[32:24] world and then he was going to make
[32:27] havoc on the church skipping for this he
[32:28] said see Paul had to
[32:31] realize okay now he said he had to
[32:33] receive Christ listen to what he said
[32:34] how strong and great he was he had to
[32:36] forget it he had to realize that he
[32:38] could not depend upon himself he had to
[32:40] realize that his education was nothing
[32:42] he had to realize that all the training
[32:44] he'd ever had he'd have to forget
[32:47] everything he's ever trained for listen
[32:49] to him now and then that's the scripture
[32:51] we read I never come to you say no I'm
[32:53] Dr Saul from the school of soand so I'm
[32:56] of that great sect of this denomination
[32:59] Paul said I never came to you like
[33:02] that I'm determined not to know anything
[33:05] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[33:07] crucified Paul said I'm determined to
[33:09] know nothing about your abilities I know
[33:12] that there's nothing in you and I'm only
[33:14] determined to know one thing that I see
[33:15] in you that's Jesus Christ and him
[33:17] crucified the crucified savior among you
[33:20] that's all I'm going to recognize
[33:24] Hallelujah can you imagine a a man a pH
[33:27] of Pharisees a teacher of the teachers a
[33:30] man that was trained from childhood for
[33:31] the ministry to be a eloquent man that
[33:34] was smart and Brilliant to come to a
[33:36] class of people like the Corinthians and
[33:37] say I was with you in weakness and in
[33:40] fear and much
[33:42] trembling a man who turned the world
[33:44] upside down the greatest missionary
[33:45] that's ever been known outside of Christ
[33:47] he said another quote confess that he
[33:49] come in weakness not as a trained
[33:51] scholar but in weakness and fear lest he
[33:53] step off the path somewhere in much
[33:56] trembling because he could not trust in
[33:58] his own
[34:00] ability now church that's how I want to
[34:02] come to church that's how you should
[34:04] come to church that's why I try to lay
[34:06] here or lay lay somewhere and say Lord I
[34:08] Have Nothing help me not to get in the
[34:10] flesh help me not to say anything from
[34:12] my thoughts help me to say your thoughts
[34:15] amen right because he said this is how I
[34:16] had to come I can't trust my ability now
[34:19] one thing we can trust is in the ability
[34:21] of the Holy Spirit praise God when God's
[34:24] spirit comes and anoints us to praise
[34:26] and worship repent to AC accept the
[34:28] promise of God we can recognize God's
[34:30] spirit that gives us the ability to do
[34:32] what God's called us to do Hallelujah
[34:34] even Malachi or Lydia as a musician they
[34:36] have to lean on God so it's the ability
[34:38] of the holy spirit in them I think it
[34:40] was a few weeks ago didn't Malachi was
[34:42] saying and he was saying in in the one
[34:43] service just everything was flowing good
[34:45] remember remember you telling that that
[34:46] was on Sunday nights we talk about our
[34:48] favorite uh memories from the day you
[34:50] know our of the services and Malachi was
[34:52] saying I thought I love that that that
[34:54] means God was just blessing every he was
[34:56] just yielded to the holy Spirit now God
[34:58] lets him I'm sure play some play some
[35:00] things that aren't exactly perfect all
[35:02] the time too right just like the song
[35:04] leader does all these crazy songs Crazy
[35:06] mistakes right the song leader wink
[35:09] wink but you know but we have to realize
[35:12] I can't trust in our ability we can just
[35:14] yield our ability to God and let the
[35:18] Holy Spirit Come anoint us and speak
[35:20] what God puts on our heart Hallelujah
[35:22] and play what God puts upon our fingers
[35:24] and upon our minds and then sing as God
[35:26] would lead us to sing
[35:30] Hallelujah that's the reason he was
[35:32] fearing not because he was scared of
[35:33] anything so so when he says I come in
[35:35] weakness and fear he said not that I'm
[35:38] scared of anybody in the church he was
[35:41] scared he would displease God in some
[35:43] way that he'd get his own ability mixed
[35:46] up into it something that he learned he
[35:48] was telling them that I didn't come to
[35:49] you with this Excellency of speech I
[35:51] come to you in the fear that I would
[35:52] come that way but I come to you knowing
[35:55] nothing but Christ and him crucified he
[35:57] reads that verse that we'll read again
[35:59] listen to this man was a warrior who'
[36:02] stripped himself of pride is what we're
[36:05] getting at this whole thing of oh I've
[36:07] got the ability I can do this in the
[36:08] church or I can do this for God when we
[36:10] get that feeling we can't do anything
[36:12] for God that's a prideful Spirit we got
[36:14] to strip ourselves of that prideful
[36:16] Spirit we can't do anything for God
[36:19] except God would come and anoint me for
[36:20] his glory you know we saw Haz at at
[36:23] mustard seed on Friday night he walked
[36:25] by I'm like I know that guy
[36:28] and I said 'lord if it's of you send him
[36:30] my way again and here he come right by
[36:32] me I said oh here's my chance I said God
[36:35] bless you sir I said did you go to
[36:37] Austin Alina's wedding but I was praying
[36:39] in the store Lord send him my way and he
[36:42] was telling me some things that are
[36:43] happened I said look that's God that's
[36:45] God providing a a friend Austin Elena
[36:47] for you and then look God used you to do
[36:49] this he's like yeah he yeah that that's
[36:51] probably right he said I appreciate your
[36:54] positivity I said man it's God setting
[36:56] you up HZ
[37:00] and so uh you know I just that blessed
[37:02] my heart to see him again but we have to
[37:04] strip ourselves of our own thoughts and
[37:06] our own abilities unless you would try
[37:08] to do something within yourselves I was
[37:11] trying to say Lord don't let me say what
[37:12] I want to say and I I've always got to
[37:14] adjust my thoughts how can I minister to
[37:16] him how can I talk about him how can I
[37:18] uh try to show God to him
[37:20] somehow
[37:23] Hallelujah he brother says I hope that
[37:26] gets down deep to us how many want the
[37:27] word of God to go deep today not just
[37:30] head knowledge but down into your
[37:32] soul and I like this and the tape world
[37:34] too that's us how many how many live in
[37:36] the tape world I live in the tape world
[37:39] that's right yeah you're not there in
[37:41] the physical service brother random we
[37:42] live in tape
[37:43] world I enjoy tape World Hallelujah that
[37:46] you realize you've got to become nothing
[37:48] not a know it all not a great somebody
[37:51] but a nobody you got to become dust see
[37:55] so I don't care if people don't like me
[37:56] I don't care if I get less popular I
[37:58] really don't care if I get less views
[37:59] really or anything like that what I care
[38:01] about is can God use me for His Glory
[38:05] Hallelujah remember remember Jesus and
[38:07] Paul both by the end they were rejected
[38:09] they were less popular and brother
[38:10] brandom at the end than they were at the
[38:12] beginning they didn't grow in popularity
[38:15] they got less in
[38:19] popularity he says you got to become
[38:21] dust dust brother Jess brother brand
[38:24] dust yeah you got to become dust did
[38:26] anybody wipe any dust off your shoes
[38:28] this
[38:29] morning butam said that's what you got
[38:31] to become there's some dust on
[38:33] there yeah get some dust that's what you
[38:35] got to become the dust Church the dust
[38:38] now he's going to tell us why he's going
[38:40] to show us the balance you're either too
[38:41] lazy or you're doing too much brother
[38:43] said you got to be right in the middle
[38:44] of the
[38:45] road right you're not lazy because you
[38:47] didn't you you didn't skip church today
[38:49] so don't don't let the devil beat you up
[38:50] you're not lazy we just got to find the
[38:53] balance right brother's going to tell us
[38:56] he said you got to become d us you got
[38:57] to get the place that you know that
[38:59] you're nothing
[39:01] Hallelujah and don't never rise above it
[39:04] for as soon as you rise above it you
[39:05] rise above God think about that oh I can
[39:09] do this I can go do this for God I've
[39:11] got all the faith I've got all the power
[39:13] but says you've already risen above
[39:17] God so now you got to we got to balance
[39:19] this right because there's times God has
[39:20] anointed you and you spoken the word
[39:22] right uh right uh like I've said before
[39:25] I've spoken to different things and God
[39:27] is honored it by God's
[39:29] grace but that would be in humility
[39:32] we're under the humility of the Holy
[39:33] Spirit not a sinful Pride
[39:36] attitude okay so there's a great balance
[39:38] here don't never rise above it because
[39:40] you rise above God you've got to keep
[39:41] yourself in the dust and on the road to
[39:44] Damascus so the picture of Paul getting
[39:46] knocked off off his high horse right and
[39:49] laying in the dust brother said keep
[39:50] yourself there in the dust and say Lord
[39:52] what must I do Hallelujah that's what
[39:55] his question was Lord what do you want
[39:56] me to do amen
[39:58] that's how each one of us should
[40:00] do you've got to keep yourself off your
[40:02] high horses and that's for everywhere
[40:04] here and in the tape world where we
[40:09] live oh what a preacher what a great man
[40:11] he sought God he said oh God I'm weak I
[40:15] don't know what to do I just pray God
[40:16] you strengthen me take my infirmities
[40:18] away from me these things I so he's
[40:19] quoting 2 Corinthians 12 where Paul says
[40:21] three times take take this buffeting
[40:23] demonic messenger from my body right
[40:28] isn't that something I just never
[40:29] thought about that wow a holy ghost
[40:30] filled person could have demon powers
[40:32] all over filling their bodies look at
[40:34] that God spoke back to him and said Paul
[40:37] my strength is made perfect in your
[40:39] weakness then Paul said well when I'm
[40:40] weak then I'm
[40:42] strong he said then I will glory in my
[40:45] infirmities of my weaknesses and so
[40:46] forth I'm thanking God that I got all of
[40:48] it out of me as far as my pride and when
[40:50] I get everything out of me then God can
[40:52] come
[40:53] in but as long as I've got some of
[40:55] myself there then God can't get in now
[40:57] he's talking about Pride Hallelujah
[41:00] there it is we smother him out so
[41:03] brother gives us this illustration we
[41:04] smother God out we drive him away from
[41:07] the poorest of us to the richest of us
[41:09] from the least to the greatest we keep
[41:11] God out of our Lives because of our own
[41:14] selves okay our own Pride you know the
[41:17] longer I'm serving God the the greater I
[41:19] realize pride is the greatest sin it's
[41:22] the greatest one we're tempted
[41:25] with because because most of us will
[41:27] keep the lust of the flesh lust of the
[41:29] Eyes under control but it's that Pride
[41:31] that gets us where we try to think we
[41:34] can do something or we know we think we
[41:36] know what to do but we got to lay in the
[41:38] dust until God tells us what to do amen
[41:41] hallelujah here's a here's a great balce
[41:43] here's I've als often said this the
[41:45] greatest enemy I got is
[41:47] Satan did I read that
[41:49] right the greatest enemy I got is the
[41:52] tape church ministry no no no no it's
[41:56] William brandham he's the one that gets
[41:57] in God's way he's the one that gets lazy
[42:00] so that's one extreme I don't do nothing
[42:02] I'm not seeking God for any leadership
[42:04] I'm just lazy brother Ram said he gets
[42:06] lazy sometimes church so Church don't
[42:08] let the devil beat you up brother Ram
[42:09] got lazy and the church said he said it
[42:13] he's either telling the truth or lying
[42:14] he's telling the
[42:16] truth he's the one that gets to a place
[42:18] sometimes where he thinks he can do
[42:21] something about it and when he does that
[42:22] shoves God right out of the
[42:25] picture right
[42:28] so see both sides you got deci side I'm
[42:30] not going to do nothing about it the
[42:31] other side well yeah I'm going to show
[42:32] them who boss I'm going to show them
[42:33] what kind of faith I
[42:34] got I'm gonna go do this and I'm gonna
[42:37] go show everybody what I got to do so
[42:38] see that brother is going on the
[42:39] extremes here of human of human thinking
[42:43] well I can do nothing about it I if
[42:45] God's just going to work it out whether
[42:46] I pray for brother Keith or not you know
[42:48] God's gonna work go that's
[42:50] lazy other side is well Keith just needs
[42:53] to speak the word well how you better be
[42:54] led by the spirit before you say that
[42:56] right
[42:59] Hallelujah so see we see both extremes
[43:02] here but when I can get rid of that guy
[43:06] who William
[43:07] brandham when Jesse Smith can get rid of
[43:09] Jesse
[43:10] Smith when I can get to a place when
[43:12] he's out the way then God can come over
[43:14] and do some things that William brandham
[43:16] knows nothing about right brother Jose I
[43:19] love this quote
[43:21] Hallelujah let let Jose get out of God's
[43:24] way and then God can do something Jose
[43:25] doesn't know anything about Hallelujah
[43:27] right you can put your all put your name
[43:28] in there
[43:30] Glory that's what Paul's saying this is
[43:32] what I've got to do when I come to the
[43:33] church to the Corinthians I've got to
[43:35] come like this I've got to know nothing
[43:37] I've got to know Christ I got to be led
[43:38] by the Holy
[43:40] Spirit that's when God can use you
[43:42] that's when he can use any of you he can
[43:44] use anybody when we get out of the way
[43:46] but as long as we got ourselves in the
[43:48] way then we cannot all right now
[43:51] remember in the in the sermon if you go
[43:52] listen to it he talks about uh Moses
[43:55] Moses knew you know he was uh to be the
[43:57] the the uh the prophet that that took
[44:00] Israel the promis land and what he do he
[44:01] tried to do it himself by killing that
[44:05] Egyptian brother BR said what did 40
[44:07] years of education produce one stinking
[44:09] Ed Egyptian he said right but see but
[44:12] when he goes out when he runs and he he
[44:14] loses his own Egyptian training and
[44:16] thoughts then he has the mind of Christ
[44:17] then one man comes over to take over the
[44:20] entire country because God's with him
[44:22] Hallelujah because God now had perfect
[44:25] strength in his weakness
[44:27] Hallelujah right I'm not going to bring
[44:29] this promise to pass it's not going to
[44:31] happen when I want it to it's going to
[44:32] happen when God wants it to
[44:35] Hallelujah waiting on the timing of God
[44:38] waiting on the season of God waiting for
[44:40] the leadership of God and no notice many
[44:41] times God's got to Humble people before
[44:43] he can use
[44:44] them he's got to let them fall flat on
[44:48] their face I'm not going to physically
[44:49] trip on my face here but you get the you
[44:51] get the picture he let Moses fall flat
[44:54] on his face he let Paul knocked Paul
[44:56] right off the horse course flat on his
[44:58] face and then God said now I can use you
[45:02] when you're in the dust and you know
[45:04] you're nothing you know you're a failure
[45:06] think of all these failures these these
[45:08] Servants of God had Jonah running from
[45:11] the presence of God I mean Moses killing
[45:14] a man not uh not circumcising his
[45:17] children Paul persecuting the
[45:21] church right holding Steven's coat while
[45:23] they Stone stepen yeah that's right they
[45:25] need to kill this Christian
[45:27] and yet God let them fail to such a
[45:29] degree but then God was showing them
[45:32] though you fail you're when you're weak
[45:34] then I'll be strong in you you've got to
[45:36] know you're nothing you got to know you
[45:38] have no ability you're just a vessel
[45:40] that I'm going to pour my spirit in
[45:41] Hallelujah give you an overflow
[45:46] Hallelujah verse fin get to verse five
[45:48] now so that your faith should stand not
[45:51] stand in the wisdom of man but in the
[45:52] power of God again he's not talking
[45:54] about God's wisdom he's talking about
[45:55] man's Wisdom
[45:58] right he's not talking about uh your
[46:00] your faith isn't in the wisdom of God no
[46:03] your faith is in the wisdom of God he's
[46:04] talking about don't let it be in the
[46:05] wisdom of men sinful
[46:07] wisdom how because remember it's the
[46:10] it's the principle thing all effort
[46:11] should be made to get the wisdom of
[46:14] God and remember how did Paul go to
[46:16] Athens how did Paul go to Athens in the
[46:17] wisdom of the Holy Spirit that's what
[46:20] the what Holy Spirit wanted to do the
[46:21] Holy Spirit wanted to bring out oh they
[46:23] they got ignorant worship but you need
[46:24] to repent you're all going to stand
[46:26] before Jesus Christ Christ he died he
[46:28] resurrected he's coming to judge you and
[46:30] we have we are The Offspring of God
[46:32] hallelujah praise God we are God's
[46:34] Offspring we're God's children and that
[46:36] was the power of God to them the wisdom
[46:38] of
[46:39] God now which one of you have ever which
[46:41] one of us have ever stood in the street
[46:43] corner and preached to Sinners I haven't
[46:46] preached but I've sang and prayed for
[46:47] people just a couple just twice well
[46:49] three times I guess one in or four times
[46:50] two in Guyana two here with brother
[46:52] Brooks and akan we did that that that's
[46:54] the power of God to stand there it's the
[46:57] power of God when the spirit gives you
[46:58] the truth when the spirit gives you the
[47:00] word and tries to cuse Sinners to repent
[47:03] that's the love of God
[47:04] hallelujah that's the charity of
[47:08] God verse six how be it we speak wisdom
[47:10] among them the saints that are perfect
[47:13] or full aged so mature right so here's
[47:15] the maturity where we're not babes in
[47:17] one way we're we're we're children we
[47:19] have childlike Faith to believe God but
[47:21] we're not uh babies with our spiritual
[47:24] character God speaks his wisdom Paul
[47:28] said he speaks God's wisdom among the
[47:29] saints that are mature yet not the
[47:31] wisdom of this world see nor the princes
[47:33] of this world that come to not see Paul
[47:37] saying I didn't come in the worldly
[47:38] wisdom I come in the wisdom of the Holy
[47:41] Spirit
[47:43] Hallelujah but we speak the wisdom of uh
[47:45] wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[47:48] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[47:50] the world unto our Glory or honor think
[47:54] about that God revealed these seven SE
[47:56] seals to us God revealed the marriage
[47:58] and divorce and and the water baptism
[48:00] and all these wonderful Revelations God
[48:02] revealed it to us so it would be for our
[48:04] honor because when we receive the word
[48:06] of God we become like God when we
[48:09] receive the word of God we get the
[48:11] character of God and then God can honor
[48:13] us on the day of judgment because we
[48:15] received God's word we took it to our
[48:17] lives we invested in it and we became
[48:19] like God hallelujah because we're his
[48:21] offspring amen hallelujah
[48:27] and that's why I told you when we have
[48:28] different guest people I try to just
[48:30] bring the if I feel led of the Holy
[48:31] Spirit I try to just bring the uh the
[48:32] Revelation maybe not so high or eat deep
[48:35] you can go either way right high or deep
[48:37] I just try to bring it down to more of a
[48:39] mature level like a repentance and a
[48:40] water baptism and a getting
[48:42] saved right because our wisdom is very
[48:45] deep think about that when we preach on
[48:47] Revelation 10 or the seven Thunders or
[48:48] the Seven Seals it gets pretty deep in
[48:50] here praise God it gets very deep most
[48:55] preachers can't even understand the
[48:56] Seven Seals and I'm not saying that
[48:58] derogatory it's just a deep thing even
[49:01] the church ages a lot of preachers can't
[49:04] understand it but we speak the wisdom of
[49:06] God in a mystery but remember the Bible
[49:09] said if you're a child of God you'll cry
[49:11] out for the wisdom of God in Proverbs
[49:12] chapter two if you want the wisdom of
[49:14] God you'll cry out for it and if you cry
[49:15] out for it God will give it to
[49:18] you so let's look at that what was the
[49:20] wisdom of God in Acts 17 it was
[49:22] repentance the shy that you're going to
[49:24] stand before Christ and be judged this
[49:27] was the power of God the Resurrection
[49:29] the death bar and resurrection and true
[49:32] worship Hallelujah of course we know the
[49:35] the fear of the Lord is the hating of
[49:36] evil that's the beginning of wisdom see
[49:39] Paul was trying to get them to the
[49:40] beginning of God's wisdom repent of all
[49:43] this idolatry God's not an idol God's
[49:45] not a something you can build with your
[49:47] own hands God gave you that God made you
[49:49] that way Hallelujah that you're God's
[49:51] creation you can't create
[49:54] God oh the mystery of God
[49:58] now I like verse eight I'm going to
[49:59] spend a little time on this one here
[50:00] maybe by God's grace we'll see which
[50:02] none of the princes of this world knew
[50:04] so see none of the Sinners knew about
[50:06] the manifold wisdom of God none of them
[50:09] knew about the Seven Seals or the the
[50:11] New Testament Mysteries the Jew and
[50:13] Gentile the wall being broken down
[50:15] between Jews and Gentiles and now both
[50:17] folds come into one fold both sheeps uh
[50:20] both flocks come into onefold as Jesus
[50:22] said in John chapter 10 they didn't know
[50:25] the wisdom of God for had they known it
[50:27] they would not have crucified the Lord
[50:29] Of Glory so think about that if Satan
[50:32] would have known what we have today he
[50:34] would not have let Jesus die on the
[50:36] cross Hallelujah why because you'd still
[50:38] be in
[50:39] Chains because Jesus died on the cross
[50:42] now you're set free because Jesus died
[50:44] on the cross now you're healed now
[50:47] you're saved now you got the Waters of
[50:49] Life flowing out of you Hallelujah glory
[50:52] to God so see the crucifixion and the
[50:55] forthcoming Resurrection ction it made
[50:58] many anointed ones rather than just one
[51:00] anointed one right because Jesus was the
[51:04] anointed one the fullness of the godhead
[51:06] dwelt in Christ bodily now I got four
[51:09] points here I want to bring out
[51:11] here Satan would not have had Jesus
[51:14] crucified if he was going to know he'd
[51:16] lose the keys to his
[51:18] house Hallelujah because the Bible said
[51:21] Jesus died through death he defeated
[51:25] death right because he lived up death
[51:28] came about because of Disobedience Jesus
[51:30] lived a life of obedience so he
[51:32] conquered death Hallelujah he didn't
[51:34] deserve to die but he died anyway to
[51:36] conquer death Hallelujah he never would
[51:38] have done it if he would have known
[51:40] Jesus would have knocked on his door and
[51:41] took the keys of death and hell and then
[51:43] he emptied out uh he emptied out
[51:46] paradise of all the Old Testament Saints
[51:49] he would not have let it he he would not
[51:50] have crucified Jesus if he knew he was
[51:52] going to lose all his
[51:53] prisoners amen Jesus come down there
[51:56] took all the prisoners and said follow
[51:58] me we're going to make a Whistle Stop in
[52:00] Jerusalem hallelujah amen
[52:04] glory and like Moses Moses smoked the
[52:07] Rock and then water came out of the rock
[52:09] Satan would not have had Jesus crucified
[52:11] if he would if he knew Jesus was the
[52:14] spiritual Rock and when and when uh when
[52:17] when actually God allowed Jesus to be
[52:18] smoked when The Rock was smoked all the
[52:21] Healing Waters poured out and it poured
[52:23] out on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah
[52:25] he said I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[52:28] Flesh Hallelujah Satan would not have
[52:30] done that he would have want us to be
[52:32] dry but how many know you don't have to
[52:34] be dry today Hallelujah if you're dry

[52:47] thirsty today you don't have to be uh
[52:49] hungry for God today if you speak to God
[52:52] God will pour out his blessings that's
[52:53] the promise that's what the New
[52:55] Testament accomplished
[52:59] Hallelujah the third thing when he gave
[53:01] up the ghost it allowed the will or the
[53:03] inheritance of the New Covenant to go
[53:06] into
[53:08] action the Bible said an inheritance
[53:10] cannot be given until the death of the
[53:13] testator so Satan would not have had
[53:16] Jesus die if he would have known all the
[53:18] inheritance was going to be given to the
[53:20] children oh oh my Hallelujah church we
[53:24] have the inheritance of God how many

[53:45] many days as we'll be here it's in the
[53:47] inheritance it's in God's Will and God's
[53:49] will will be poured out Hallelujah who's
[53:52] going to stop God from giving out his
[53:54] will Hallelujah
[53:58] oh thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah glory
[54:00] to God thank you
[54:03] Lord Isaiah 53 said we were healed with
[54:06] his
[54:07] stripes so Satan would not allow Jesus
[54:09] to go to Calvary if he knew with every
[54:11] stripe that he received every beating
[54:13] that he received every drop of blood
[54:16] that that he received was actually
[54:18] paying for our judgment Satan would not
[54:20] have allowed him to go think about that
[54:22] with each stripe yes uh your healing was
[54:25] being paid for amen so this stripe you
[54:28] are healed from depression with that
[54:30] stripe you're healed from cancer

[54:39] lust of the flesh every sickness every
[54:42] disease every spiritual attack of the of
[54:44] the devil was paid for and with his
[54:47] stripes you were healed Satan would not
[54:49] have done that if he'd have known all
[54:51] the blessings that we were going to
[54:53] experience oh thank you Lord Jesus thank
[54:56] you Lord
[54:57] brother Bram even said Jesus on the way
[54:59] down to Hell condemned every demon on
[55:02] the way down to Hell as he was going to
[55:04] Satan's house he condemned the demon of
[55:06] depression the demon of Oppression right
[55:08] the demon of sickness and infirmities
[55:10] and blindness and all these uh demonic
[55:13] addictions he condemned every single one
[55:15] until he got to Satan and then he took
[55:17] the keys of death and hell and he
[55:19] overcame he emptied out paradise and
[55:22] that's what he does he's our great
[55:23] Redeemer Hallelujah

[56:12] Beautiful who is lame and all hell
[56:13] turned loose on him right they got
[56:16] arrested they got beaten they got taken
[56:18] to jail right that's right the devil
[56:21] don't like to see God display his power

[56:25] he's finished amen our Christ is
[56:27] predominant take the initiative don't

[56:31] church said Don't Let The Devil push
[56:33] something on you you push it back

[56:37] with that balance right not not you're
[56:39] trying to do too much but you're led by
[56:41] God to push it back Hallelujah like I

[56:56] the I'm talking about the real presence
[56:57] of God hallelujah I'm talking about God
[57:00] stepping down the services doing
[57:01] something Supernatural you start
[57:02] testifying to that you know Satan's
[57:04] going to try to make the church cold
[57:05] again he's going to come come try to uh
[57:08] fight the church and make the church
[57:10] nervous and afraid but we're supposed to

[57:14] Faith hallelujah amen amen hallelujah
[57:17] that's right
[57:19] amen this is uh the gospel the gospel
[57:22] heals our spiritual diseases but also
[57:24] our natural sicknesses
[57:26] Hallelujah Satan wants to try to get us
[57:29] cold on God but we got to tell the devil
[57:31] we're not going to go your way we're
[57:33] going to cast down any thought that
[57:35] magnifies itself against the word of God
[57:41] hallelujah verse n but as it is written
[57:43] eyes is not seen ears not heard neither
[57:46] hath entered in the heart of man the
[57:48] things which God hath prepared for them
[57:50] that love him so Paul says we speak
[57:53] God's wisdom it's just for the Saints
[57:56] right the world can't receive it they
[57:57] don't know
[57:58] it and these are the things uh what God
[58:02] has given us because he loves us think
[58:05] about that the godhead is one person God
[58:07] gave that to you because he loved
[58:09] you the serpent seed the marriage and
[58:12] divorce God gave that to us because he
[58:15] loved us the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:18] Christ baptism thank God we if we were
[58:20] baptized in titles we can be baptized
[58:22] the right way in the name of the savior
[58:26] God gave us that because he loved us he
[58:28] let us understand predestination that
[58:30] we're just not here by accident God had
[58:32] a thought about us and God had to bring
[58:34] that thought to pass God sent us here at
[58:36] exactly the right time right when he
[58:38] wanted us to be here and he sent us to
[58:40] be here in the last days in the seventh
[58:42] Church age of all the church ages he
[58:45] sent us here to be on fire not lukewarm
[58:48] not cold God sent us here to be on fire
[58:50] amen trying to stir up your fire today
[58:52] by God's grace Hallelujah anybody can
[58:54] anybody tell
[58:56] Hallelujah God has prepared the this
[58:58] wisdom of God the mystery of God we
[59:00] speak God's wisdom in the mystery God's
[59:02] prepared it for those that he loves
[59:08] Hallelujah brother Ram said Jesus will
[59:10] answer all of our unanswered questions
[59:12] now I'm talking about future things he's
[59:14] prepared for us right but this verse has
[59:17] a dual application because we're going
[59:19] to look at verse 10 we're going to look
[59:20] at verse 10 just a
[59:22] moment God loved us so much he prepared
[59:25] for us all the things not just the
[59:27] future things in heaven or in the
[59:28] Millennium or the future home but also
[59:31] here on this
[59:33] earth right because what's the next
[59:35] verse say but God hath that means he
[59:38] already has revealed them unto us by his
[59:41] spirit for the spirit searches all
[59:44] things yay the Deep things of
[59:47] God church I was raised in the
[59:49] Pentecostal church I never heard
[59:50] anything about the mysteries of God but
[59:52] when I come to the message now I see the
[59:54] mysteries of God
[59:56] now I I I see how God is one person not
[59:59] three
[1:00:00] Gods right now I see the the god of the
[1:00:03] Old Testament isn't mad but you know the
[1:00:04] god of the New Testament is happy for
[1:00:07] us that's not how we see it we see the
[1:00:09] wisdom of God we understand the plan of
[1:00:11] God it's the same God all the way
[1:00:13] through praise God he's given us the
[1:00:15] message of Grace it's always been Grace
[1:00:17] hallelujah it's never been legalism it's
[1:00:20] always been grace even in the law God
[1:00:22] was gracious
[1:00:23] Hallelujah the law was a school teacher
[1:00:26] to bring us to Christ that none of us
[1:00:28] could keep the the all the laws of God
[1:00:30] except a Holy One except a body that God
[1:00:33] has prepared for himself for
[1:00:36] sacrifice Hallelujah so we must
[1:00:39] recognize that God yes he has things we
[1:00:41] don't know that our future they're so
[1:00:43] amazing for us because he loves us but
[1:00:45] we should enjoy what God has given us
[1:00:48] now the plan the mystery of God how many
[1:00:50] en joining the Rapture series here
[1:00:52] that's part of the mystery that God is
[1:00:54] revealing to us now
[1:00:57] hallelujah what a blessing that is so we
[1:01:00] have a a dual promise God's going to
[1:01:03] give us things now and then it hasn't
[1:01:05] even think about that it hasn't entered
[1:01:07] into our mind the things that God has
[1:01:09] for us I love when people ask me uh
[1:01:13] brother Jesse are we going to go live on
[1:01:15] other planets and I said we might right
[1:01:18] will all of our uh will all of our our
[1:01:20] our animals that pass on be there they
[1:01:23] might but I've got this promise
[1:01:26] it h i can't even comprehend what God
[1:01:29] has for me because he loves
[1:01:32] me of all the things I could want it's
[1:01:34] even beyond that hallelujah praise God
[1:01:37] it's it's beyond what it hasn't even
[1:01:39] come into my mind
[1:01:41] Hallelujah I I can't reach that high
[1:01:43] those thoughts are too high for me I'm
[1:01:45] too low I'm too much of a human Jesse
[1:01:48] Smith keeps getting in my way Hallelujah
[1:01:50] I'm too much of a human but God has
[1:01:52] things that I can't comprehend because
[1:01:54] he loves me because he loves you and the
[1:01:56] cross showed us that he loved us all
[1:01:59] hallelujah oh it's beautiful the love of
[1:02:03] God but God hath revealed them unto us
[1:02:06] by his
[1:02:07] Spirit and the spirit searches all
[1:02:09] things yay the Deep things of
[1:02:13] God so see when we preach on the
[1:02:15] mysteries of God we're not going too
[1:02:17] deep as long as we as long as we stay in
[1:02:19] the word of God as long as we don't add
[1:02:22] anything to the godhead you know
[1:02:23] anything outside the Bible as long as we
[1:02:25] don't add anything to the Jew and
[1:02:27] Gentile or the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:29] as long as we don't add anything in
[1:02:31] there then we can go as deep as we can
[1:02:33] in the word of God
[1:02:36] hallelujah that's right look at that the
[1:02:39] holy spirit will take you deeper in your
[1:02:41] walk with God the holy spirit will only
[1:02:44] take you deeper into you knowing the
[1:02:46] word of God how many believe that's a
[1:02:48] how many believe that's a true verse
[1:02:49] right there the Holy Spirit searches
[1:02:52] deeper into the things of God like last
[1:02:54] year or earlier earlier this year when
[1:02:56] Simon had that Revelation about being
[1:02:58] re-baptized from Joseph remember that
[1:03:00] that was a great Revelation why did why
[1:03:02] was Joseph buried twice it's a type of
[1:03:04] being re-baptized you don't Simon said
[1:03:07] that sat on the shelf for what 20 years
[1:03:10] what the spirit want to do take us
[1:03:11] deeper in the word of God and that's
[1:03:13] every time I preach I experience
[1:03:14] something deeper Hallelujah every time I
[1:03:16] preach I'm like ah there it is that's I
[1:03:18] didn't never saw that before Oh that's
[1:03:19] deeper in the things of God
[1:03:22] hallelujah see God hath revealed them
[1:03:26] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[1:03:27] searches all things yay the Deep things
[1:03:30] of God now how many know he's searching
[1:03:31] you right
[1:03:32] now how many know he wants to search you
[1:03:36] today that's right he searches all
[1:03:38] things he wants to know the condition of
[1:03:40] every heart here
[1:03:41] today for what man knoweth the things of
[1:03:44] a man say the spirit of man which is in
[1:03:47] him so see you're the only one that
[1:03:50] knows what's in your heart the spirit of
[1:03:52] man that's in man I don't know what's in
[1:03:54] Mercy's heart I don't know what's in
[1:03:55] Jose
[1:03:56] Patrick I don't know what's in your
[1:03:57] heart only the spirit of man knows
[1:03:59] what's in a
[1:04:00] man right even so the things of God
[1:04:04] knoweth no man but the spirit of God so
[1:04:07] the things of God are so deep they only
[1:04:09] they only exist in the plan and in the
[1:04:11] mind and heart and soul of God
[1:04:14] hallelujah now now we have received ever
[1:04:16] say now ready now I know you're getting
[1:04:18] tired I'm trying to close here I use I
[1:04:20] try to close I think I'm getting closer
[1:04:21] to my closeth now we have received not
[1:04:24] the spirit of the world but the the
[1:04:25] spirit which is of god that we might
[1:04:27] know the things that are freely given to
[1:04:30] us right they're just freely given God
[1:04:33] wants to reveal and and how does he do
[1:04:35] that if we Su with him if we open the
[1:04:37] door and let him come in and Su with us
[1:04:39] he'll Su with us hallelujah if we spend
[1:04:41] time with God God will reveal these
[1:04:43] things to us hallelujah a deeper
[1:04:45] understanding a more appreciation a
[1:04:47] deeper knowledge of the love of
[1:04:50] God see because these Corinthians didn't
[1:04:53] have a deep love of God they were suing
[1:04:54] each other they were were sleeping
[1:04:56] around right the they were
[1:04:59] prideful they had divisions and I'm not
[1:05:01] talking to you I'm better than you I got
[1:05:05] more money than you and all these false
[1:05:08] preachers we just saw all these false
[1:05:09] preachers mistreating the people doing
[1:05:12] all kinds of wickedness in the church
[1:05:15] they had all these problems but Paul
[1:05:17] said the spirit of God is going to
[1:05:19] freely give us the truth of the wisdom
[1:05:21] of
[1:05:24] God with things also we speak not in The
[1:05:27] Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but
[1:05:29] which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[1:05:32] spiritual things with spiritual like
[1:05:34] even churches there are saying oh we
[1:05:35] need I heard a church in Georgia say we
[1:05:37] need to unhitch from the Old
[1:05:39] Testament that's the last thing we need
[1:05:41] to do we need uh would an eagle want to
[1:05:43] unhitch from one of his
[1:05:45] wings would a husband want to unhitch
[1:05:47] from his wife no you need both
[1:05:50] Hallelujah you don't want to it's we
[1:05:52] need the spirit and Truth we need both
[1:05:54] Hallelujah there's prophecies we as we
[1:05:56] said in the Old Testament that are still
[1:05:58] not fulfilled there's a Rapture Prophecy
[1:06:00] in the Old Testament Hallelujah see
[1:06:02] that's man's Wisdom is teaching things
[1:06:05] outside of the wisdom of God I like this
[1:06:08] the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[1:06:11] spiritual things with
[1:06:14] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:06:16] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:06:18] their foolishness unto him neither can
[1:06:20] he know them because they are
[1:06:22] spiritually discerned now here's some
[1:06:24] examples
[1:06:26] how many know brother Ram said scripture
[1:06:27] must compare with scripture so brother
[1:06:30] Ram is basically quoting uh 1
[1:06:32] Corinthians
[1:06:33] 2:13 brother Bram said I know God I know
[1:06:36] God's moving when a scripture from this
[1:06:39] book agrees with that
[1:06:41] book this is how brother knew the spirit
[1:06:43] was guiding him into deeper things
[1:06:45] especially with the Seven Seals he said
[1:06:47] God would show him a vision of like
[1:06:48] let's say the third the third seal oil
[1:06:50] and wine he said then I take my
[1:06:52] concordance and I I look down every time
[1:06:54] oil and wine is used in the entire Bible
[1:06:56] which is like 30 or 40 times and he said
[1:06:59] I compare the revelation of the third
[1:07:01] seal with the rest of the Bible and as
[1:07:03] long as they agreed he said I knew that
[1:07:05] was
[1:07:10] God now last night we find the first
[1:07:12] seal went forth the rider so helped me I
[1:07:14] never knew it before none of these
[1:07:15] things have I ever known before that's
[1:07:17] right I just don't go up there and take
[1:07:18] the Bible and sit down and sit there
[1:07:20] when it goes to Breaking like that in a
[1:07:22] vision I just pick up my pen and start
[1:07:23] writing and just stay there maybe for
[1:07:25] hours till it gets finished then I go
[1:07:28] back and I found out as I see where he
[1:07:30] said I thought well that looks like
[1:07:31] something I've seen somewhere I get my
[1:07:33] concordance go back is there something
[1:07:36] like that and here it is right here and
[1:07:38] then here it is over here again here it
[1:07:40] is back here and down there and over
[1:07:42] here then I just tie it right in I know
[1:07:45] that's God as long as it's comparing
[1:07:47] scripture with
[1:07:49] scripture and what did Paul tell us the
[1:07:51] spirit of God searches all things and
[1:07:53] Compares spiritual with spiritual
[1:07:56] that's the way it has to do just like
[1:07:59] putting a building together the stones
[1:08:01] have to fit Stone by Stone scriptures
[1:08:03] have to fit scripture by
[1:08:06] scripture now here's some examples like
[1:08:08] I said the third seal the
[1:08:10] oil and the wine right we see oil and
[1:08:13] Zechariah represents the holy spirit and
[1:08:15] wine right we see those together so we
[1:08:17] see the Old Testament verses Zechariah
[1:08:20] agree with Acts chapter
[1:08:22] 2 it's not a different it's not a
[1:08:24] disagreement it's anre agreement
[1:08:26] Hallelujah we see water baptism Matthew
[1:08:29] 28 uh versus acts 238 they're not in
[1:08:32] opposition somehow they're in
[1:08:35] unity Hallelujah and hell they say hell
[1:08:38] is not Eternal because the smoke
[1:08:40] ascendeth up forever and ever but the
[1:08:41] Bible says no murderer has eternal
[1:08:44] life so forever and ever doesn't mean
[1:08:47] the same as
[1:08:48] Eternal scripture has to agree with
[1:08:51] scripture Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit
[1:08:54] will take you down to the deep
[1:08:56] understanding of God's
[1:08:59] word but I want you to know too brother
[1:09:01] manam says the enemy tries to
[1:09:02] impersonate this scripture comparing
[1:09:04] with
[1:09:06] scripture right oh yeah I just saw one
[1:09:07] this week did you know there's people
[1:09:09] today in the LGB whatever Community they
[1:09:12] say it's allowed because of Ruth and
[1:09:15] Naomi because they say see uh when
[1:09:18] people get married they use uh uh Naomi
[1:09:21] saying no Ruth saying wherever you die
[1:09:23] I'll die and
[1:09:25] what and see see what are they doing
[1:09:26] it's it's the devil trying to look oh
[1:09:28] here's a scripture and here's marriage
[1:09:29] and Ephesians and here's Ruth and we use
[1:09:31] those together so God must be okay with
[1:09:33] it what a bunch of trash what about all
[1:09:36] the other Abomination scriptures see how
[1:09:39] the devil does that he tries to pull one
[1:09:41] verse here so see God Compares scripture
[1:09:43] by scripture but Satan tries him imp
[1:09:45] person oh yeah the other one was
[1:09:46] Jonathan and David they had a love for
[1:09:48] each other greater than women and so see
[1:09:50] the homosexuals pervert
[1:09:52] that see that that's the devil he's
[1:09:55] comparing wrong scriptures those don't
[1:09:57] go together right because David uh David
[1:10:00] stood against David had 500 or I'm sorry
[1:10:03] at least eight wives
[1:10:05] Hallelujah so it's it's Satan yeah and
[1:10:08] you have to know you have to rightly
[1:10:09] divide it by the Holy Spirit brother mam
[1:10:12] says why we're living in the last days
[1:10:14] what are we doing about it what are we
[1:10:15] doing you say well what you done perhaps
[1:10:17] what the Pharisees done they belong to
[1:10:18] church and deny Jesus Christ we always
[1:10:21] say today people try to say we compare
[1:10:23] we've got to compare Bible in Bible
[1:10:25] belief scripture was scripture that
[1:10:27] isn't the truth no it isn't the truth
[1:10:29] this Greek word means this and that
[1:10:31] means that the Greek themselves we back
[1:10:33] in counil Nia and them writers back
[1:10:35] there they had different forms one
[1:10:37] believed this way the Greek scholar
[1:10:38] meant this and the other one said this
[1:10:40] one meant it this way and they fussed
[1:10:42] over it we don't need interpretation of
[1:10:43] Greek Scholars or Greek words okay so
[1:10:46] there's a balance on this too right
[1:10:48] there's a balance on this so bam said
[1:10:50] all the way back in 3:25 at the council
[1:10:52] in NAA they were arguing about who had
[1:10:54] the right manuscript
[1:10:57] right but look at their doctrine that
[1:10:59] they lived if they were on Constantine
[1:11:01] side then they agreed with murder so it
[1:11:03] doesn't matter what you're what you
[1:11:04] believe about the Greek your your life
[1:11:06] proves you've got corrupt fruit
[1:11:10] Hallelujah
[1:11:11] yesam said to know him is life the
[1:11:14] person Christ himself not comparing it's
[1:11:17] a revelation that God built upon his
[1:11:20] church and if we don't build upon that
[1:11:22] same church he said the Bible said Abel
[1:11:24] by faith fath faith is a divine
[1:11:26] revelation see faith is a divine
[1:11:28] revelation the whole thing is built upon
[1:11:30] Revelation and unless this is revealed
[1:11:32] to you Jesus said I thank the father or
[1:11:34] thank thee father that thou has hid
[1:11:35] these things from the wise of the world
[1:11:37] and revealed it unto babes such as we
[1:11:39] learn see now the whole thing is built
[1:11:41] there you've got to know the person of
[1:11:43] Christ and let me show you the balance
[1:11:45] here I thought I was closer to closing
[1:11:47] than I I am
[1:11:48] actually I'm going to skip this here did
[1:11:52] you know brother Ram would use a few
[1:11:53] Greek words how many know this a few
[1:11:55] Greek Greek or Hebrew words and Scholars
[1:11:56] would come by and say brother Ram you
[1:11:58] use that Greek word exactly
[1:12:00] right and brother Ram was not an
[1:12:02] intelligent man he he that's what he
[1:12:05] says I think he was intelligent but he
[1:12:06] wasn't intelligent as the cares of the
[1:12:08] world right or the training of the world
[1:12:10] he didn't go to Seminary is what I'm
[1:12:11] saying yeah like I said he's way smarter
[1:12:13] than me he could quot all those
[1:12:15] scriptures and pray for all those sick
[1:12:16] people he's a million miles Beyond me or
[1:12:18] any preacher I know
[1:12:20] probably but brother R was complimented
[1:12:22] by a scholar on his use of the Greek so
[1:12:25] he opened up his concordance and he
[1:12:26] found the right word and then he used
[1:12:29] that word to help explain the
[1:12:31] godhead he said I just learned from a
[1:12:34] little greek scholar sitting here
[1:12:35] looking at me right now come over from
[1:12:37] Greece a scholar in Greek and he began
[1:12:39] to play my tape and he watched the
[1:12:41] message he said brother brandom I know
[1:12:43] that you haven't even gotten education
[1:12:44] but brother randam your words and your
[1:12:45] message run perfect with the Greek
[1:12:47] interpretation of the Bible said it's
[1:12:49] exactly right what you said is exactly
[1:12:51] right so a Greek scholar who knew Greek
[1:12:54] heard brother random used a Greek word
[1:12:57] and said you're exactly right so see how
[1:13:00] there's a balance people argue about the
[1:13:02] Greek and then they fuss over the Greek
[1:13:04] but God led a prophet an uneducated
[1:13:06] Prophet to interpret the Greek the right
[1:13:10] way get why because he was spiritual
[1:13:12] amen he had the mind of Christ
[1:13:13] Hallelujah he could compare he knows
[1:13:15] God's not three persons so he can take a
[1:13:17] Greek he can take the right Greek
[1:13:19] definition and apply it the right way
[1:13:21] and get the right Revelation
[1:13:24] Hallelujah brother raham used Greek to
[1:13:26] prove his godhead Revelation was from
[1:13:31] Jesus Philippians 2:7 but God made
[1:13:34] himself of no reputation and took upon
[1:13:36] him the form of a servant and was made
[1:13:39] in the likeness of men the word form is
[1:13:41] morphe morphe the form by which a person
[1:13:44] or thing strikes the vision an external
[1:13:49] appearance brother Ram was preaching
[1:13:51] about the godhead and the unveiling of
[1:13:53] of God he said God changed himself he
[1:13:56] changes his form Philippians said he
[1:13:59] took the form of a man now the Greek
[1:14:01] word there for form I've been looking at
[1:14:03] all day yesterday think about that all
[1:14:04] day he was in the Greek a prophet of God
[1:14:06] was looking at the concordance all
[1:14:08] day that's what I do some Saturdays
[1:14:10] thinking trying to think out what it was
[1:14:13] I come to find out this word am morphe
[1:14:15] it's spelled e n m o r p h e looking in
[1:14:18] the Greek to find out what a morphe was
[1:14:20] I may pronounce that wrong but reason I
[1:14:22] spell it when if a tape is released a p
[1:14:25] people will the scholars will know what
[1:14:27] I me mean by it and when the Amor that
[1:14:30] means that he changed himself he come
[1:14:32] down now the Greek word means something
[1:14:34] that couldn not be seen yet it's there
[1:14:36] and it changed that the eye can catch it
[1:14:39] so see it's the external appearance by
[1:14:41] which it strikes the vision so morphe is
[1:14:44] the visible image of something and so
[1:14:47] God took upon himself the image of a
[1:14:52] servant he said uh I'm going to skip
[1:14:54] down so what I'm trying to say is that
[1:14:56] God is always was is here the only thing
[1:14:59] he done when he become man he changes
[1:15:01] Mass so now he gives another word for
[1:15:03] Morp is like putting on a mask we
[1:15:05] couldn't see God when he was invisible
[1:15:07] so he put a Morp he put on a
[1:15:10] mask Allelujah and then this in morphe
[1:15:13] he changed himself to what he was to
[1:15:15] what he is or his mask another act
[1:15:19] Hallelujah and the church said so that's
[1:15:21] all God did God was in heaven he put on
[1:15:23] a mask the first mask he put on was the
[1:15:25] logos right then he created angels and
[1:15:29] the angels saw him create the Earth
[1:15:31] right and then he come down and of
[1:15:33] course we know the other times but he
[1:15:34] put on the mask of
[1:15:36] MDC right but he dropped that mask and
[1:15:38] went back up but then he put on the mask
[1:15:40] of a little baby infant Hallelujah and
[1:15:43] that was Emmanuel God With Us Hallelujah
[1:15:47] but thank God he wasn't done he put on
[1:15:49] the mask of a glorified body and then he
[1:15:51] sent back the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and
[1:15:53] then he stepped behind the veil on the
[1:15:55] day of Pentecost and now he's behind
[1:15:57] Peter amen now he's behind Paul now he's
[1:16:00] behind the Saints now he's behind Mary
[1:16:02] it's Christ in you the hope of Glory
[1:16:05] Hallelujah Glory now you're not the
[1:16:08] fullness but you're a part you're a
[1:16:10] measure you're a part of God you are
[1:16:12] genan seed you're a thought of God
[1:16:14] you're an attribute of God but that part
[1:16:16] of God is just as much God hallelujah
[1:16:18] because it's the character it's a spirit
[1:16:20] of God you're an offspring of God you're
[1:16:22] a child of God
[1:16:26] Hallelujah that's what that's what
[1:16:27] brother man preaches in the Masterpiece
[1:16:29] and the unveiling of God that God God is
[1:16:31] now behind the
[1:16:33] bride
[1:16:35] Hallelujah because it's Christ in you
[1:16:38] the hope of glory and didn't Jesus say
[1:16:41] when you've done it to the least of
[1:16:42] these my brethren you've done it unto
[1:16:45] me and didn't Jesus say Paul Paul why
[1:16:48] were you kicking against the my Pricks
[1:16:51] why were you hurting me right but Paul
[1:16:53] wasn't hurting the physical body Jesus
[1:16:55] he was he he was hurting the body he was
[1:16:58] the people the followers the children of
[1:17:02] God hallelujah church that's how if we
[1:17:05] want Unity here if we want Victory here
[1:17:06] we've got to see each other like that
[1:17:08] we're children of God God's hiding
[1:17:10] behind that
[1:17:11] mask God's hiding behind your Veil is
[1:17:15] that right that's what we see God and
[1:17:18] Morp God took on the form of a bride the
[1:17:21] Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah she's a
[1:17:25] many-membered bride hallelujah
[1:17:29] amen finishing the chapter I'm going to
[1:17:31] finish up here I keep saying that but he
[1:17:33] that is spiritual judges all things oh
[1:17:36] brother don't judge me I'm told to judge
[1:17:38] all
[1:17:39] things and remember we're never judging
[1:17:41] Eternal destination we can warn them of
[1:17:43] the Eternal
[1:17:44] destination right whether it's Eternal
[1:17:46] Annihilation or eternal life we can warn
[1:17:49] them of annihilation Eternal judgment is
[1:17:51] the word I'm sorry Eternal judgment and
[1:17:53] yes Eternal annihilation yes it'll last
[1:17:56] eternally but see the Bible said when
[1:17:58] you're spiritual you can go deeper in
[1:18:00] the things of God you compare scripture
[1:18:03] with scripture you compare the Greek
[1:18:05] word to try to understand does that
[1:18:06] meaning compareed with all the rest of
[1:18:08] the
[1:18:09] scripture and he that spiritual judges
[1:18:12] all things yet he himself is judged of
[1:18:14] no man see don't let somebody else judge
[1:18:16] you you know you have to let God judge
[1:18:19] you God is your judge and the church
[1:18:21] said Thank God he's my judge he's also
[1:18:24] my advocate right he's also my attorney
[1:18:26] Hallelujah he's also My
[1:18:29] Sacrifice Hallelujah Paul said he's
[1:18:32] telling these Corinthians don't let
[1:18:33] anyone judge you right be spiritual
[1:18:37] compare spiritual things with spiritual
[1:18:40] things and that's Church in every in
[1:18:42] every trial or trouble we have we've
[1:18:44] always got to remember that go back to
[1:18:46] the word of God what does the word of
[1:18:48] God say about this Hallelujah that's how
[1:18:51] you know you can you you that's how you
[1:18:53] know you're free you're not letting
[1:18:54] other people judge you you you you
[1:18:56] yourself go before God and say God you
[1:18:58] form my
[1:19:00] heart I have a spirit of a man and I
[1:19:02] know what's in me and Lord your spirit I
[1:19:04] want your spirit to go inside of me
[1:19:05] search out my heart see what's in my
[1:19:08] life and show me if I'm wrong if I'm
[1:19:09] wrong correct me
[1:19:11] Hallelujah but I'm not going to let
[1:19:13] somebody else judge me I'm not going to
[1:19:14] let somebody else put me down I'm gonna
[1:19:16] let Christ judge me
[1:19:18] Hallelujah who who hath known the mind
[1:19:20] of the Lord that he may instruct him
[1:19:23] nobody gives God any tips right God
[1:19:24] don't need your advice God needs your
[1:19:27] submission and the church said prayers
[1:19:30] is to change your mind not to change the
[1:19:33] mind of God I preach on that I I've
[1:19:36] shown you the quotes on both
[1:19:37] sides one place brother said you can
[1:19:39] change the mind of God another place he
[1:19:41] says you can't so what was those other
[1:19:43] ones that was God giving people his
[1:19:45] permissive will okay if you want to go
[1:19:47] that route you can go but that wasn't my
[1:19:49] first will that's not what I wanted you
[1:19:51] to do none of us can instruct God but we
[1:19:55] have the mind of Christ last slide
[1:19:58] because our weapons are not carnal But
[1:20:01] Mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:20:03] of strongholds and that's the word for
[1:20:05] complexes the word of God here today is
[1:20:08] so powerful it can pull down any complex
[1:20:11] any sin any fear any battle that you're
[1:20:13] facing the word of God will pull it down
[1:20:15] Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[1:20:18] and forever and he tells us to cast down
[1:20:21] any imagination and every High thing
[1:20:23] that exalts itself against what God's
[1:20:25] word the knowledge of God says and bring
[1:20:28] into captivity every thought to The
[1:20:31] Obedience of Christ what does Christ one
[1:20:32] he wants us to obey the word of God

[1:21:11] the Holy Spirit praise God let's bow our
