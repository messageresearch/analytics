[Music] [Music] i [Music] i [Music] is [Music] what is do [Music] worship let's uh read our let's start with our memory verse and isaiah 12 verse 2. we'll read another text here by god's grace i didn't know if it was too hot uh if it's does anyone want the air on does anybody want to air on okay uh malachi do you know how to do the air conditioning okay do you know how to do it man thank you thank you sir appreciate that i don't know whether to put on the air or not so sorry sometimes people you know some people like it hot some people like it cold i try to find the middle of the road isaiah 12 oh let's read two to five you know six is a b this is a really short short chapter but look at verse six two cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion you know zionist you know new jerusalem is called mount zion in a spiritual sense and it's very fitting to the bride for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee in other words we're supposed to shout because jesus is so great oh we're shouting for eternity praise god jesus christ amen the same yesterday today and forever all right let's read verse two to five here let's begin on three one two 3 behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also has become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth praise god let's go to acts 15 we'll just read one verse there acts 15. uh lord willing tonight i just read verse two uh we'll be looking more at uh taking sides with jesus um but this scripture is important here for verse two i'll just read it because it's a little bit longer when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them the the men that were preaching uh circumcision was required for salvation so paul and barnabas had a lot of arguments with them and certain over of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question praise god so how should the church act today if the church then had trouble and all got together to solve problems how should the church act today the same way by god's grace same way because it's the same church let's have a word of prayer if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto god here dear heavenly father we love you we thank you we come into your presence lord we sing in worship lord as the scripture says we should cry out shout aloud for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of us lord jesus you're great we shout holy praise be to god in your presence we know you're here lord god you promise to be here and lord we'll take at your word lord so we know lord that you are the word and you keep your appointments lord god we ask you to dwell amongst us here tonight by your holy spirit and bless our hearts tonight with your presence in jesus christ's name and the church said amen god bless you being seated i'll try to keep it brief here tonight by god's grace we'll try to just preach about 45 minutes or hour you know i didn't i want to finish this text that i was reading with this brother uh from texas i kept reading it and then i saw oh i'd like to share that too because uh i was reminded of a quote how many remember the quote where brother branham said you know if you're having trouble with your wife you know there's a man that asked brother brandon i'm having trouble with my wife and she doesn't believe the message like we do he said i try to rebuke that spirit he said but it's not going anywhere i remember that quote brother ram said why don't you buy her a box of chocolates instead of rebuking her and you know calling her a devil he said why don't you buy a box of chocolates and he said it actually happened and it and it restored their marriage he went and bought chocolates and she believed after that and so the reason i say that is because chocolates don't cast out devils it's the love behind it amen and the same was true with like i was saying this morning i just called the brother i did we talked maybe for an hour maybe an hour he says it seems all i needed was a kind word an encouragement from a brother as a catalyst to move forward which i'm doing now and you provided it he said and now i have no more kind of condemnation's begun to leave me i brought a i have a peace i've been longing for oh thank you lord it's not the call right it's not the call it's not the text that moves demons it's the love behind it praise god so i just want to express that because it reminded me of this quote where brother ram said a box of chocolates caused his wife to repent you know and then believe the message so it wasn't chocolates it was love and love but i said divine love casts out all demons praise god it's divine love so i hope that's a blessing there uh by god's grace okay now uh tonight i guess i want to be brief um i know we got i got to get my even i even i got to get my body back in the mode of preaching hard twice on a sunday it's been nice you know it's kind of been nice at home you know on a sunday we can just go do the live stream and then we're done you know we don't have to drive home but uh i believe in this i believe it's the right thing to gather together more as we see that day approaching and worshiping the lord in this manner there's nobody else i'd rather be with than god's people that is true i i'd much oh i love like i said i you know like the scripture says i'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of lord uh one day than to dwell in the tents with the wicked i love i love coming to church i love worshiping and praising god and god has blessed us with these musician gifts remember bang just remember a few years ago we didn't have any of this man maybe a couple of years 10 12 years ago didn't have all this we're so blessed and so i just love to raise my hands and sing and worship it's such a great time to be in the house of lord today so i'll just start with that just it's love that removes every uh demon power so let's get now i want to get back to these quotes like i said i'm going to be going back to acts 15. and i got a few more scriptures separate scriptures that kind of came to me while i was just sitting back there so i wrote them down real quick um so we ended this morning by showing how brother branham said brother neville just continue on and now brother ram goes into his ministry in this like first half of the sermon he says there's four things that could happen to him one of them he could die one of them could be he's going off the scene and another prophet is going to rise on the scene he's not sure he said it could be him that steps into the ministry which that's what happened he came into the third poll and there was something else i can't quite remember what he said but he said uh but the church he said talk about the rapture now the church will go home he said if that would take place tomorrow it doesn't hinder us from keeping on today let's make today count so i just want to reiterate that with the church we should make every day count amen for jesus christ because we never know when it will be a chance wouldn't it be a day that would be a red letter day it'll be a special day a day that will uh our testimony one of our prayers will actually come to pass we never know when that day will be so we want to be faithful prepared for that day praise god and we know that god is watching all of our efforts i'm going to read this real quick if you've got your bible revelation i believe chapter 2 um yeah i believe it's uh 19 yeah revelation 219 remember this is the great revelation it came to me about three or four years ago when i was preaching and brother i remember brother john was in the back on a wednesday night and this revelation just came to me from the church age book brother branham said the secret to christianity is increasing your love for god increasing your works for god your service for god he said satan satan's whole battle is going to be trying to get us to to decrease our service for god he said but a christian when he goes through a trial he doesn't quit uh he looks up and says lord thank you help me to get through this trial i'll keep i'll increase my love for you instead of decrease i'll increase it and so this scripture is that great revelation because remember i was talking about how paul could have given up what if paul would have gave up what if all these brothers would have gave up he said make every day count verse 19 i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy work so he starts with works and he goes back to works and the last to be more than the first so see at the end of their life these old saints now were serving god better at the end than the beginning and i can say amen to that i can see that in my life i'm serving god with more faithfulness than even at the beginning praise god and so that brother says is the secret to christianity continue your service in the midst of trial satan just wants you to quit or decrease like like today jeffersonville trying to get us to decrease our preaching but the bible said increase it praise god i like how jesus says i know he said i know what you're going through he says he's been there i know your works jesus knows what it's like to serve jesus knows what it's like to have faith jesus knows what it's like to have persecution and trials and obstacles but ram said remember he was constantly badgered by the pharisees he said but brother he said but jesus took god's word and he learned to live above the criticism i had a brother text me yesterday from arkansas and he said brother he said one of my friends shared your video and he said man it's getting criticized i said that's a good sign i said i'm glad about that tell them to keep posting it if i was if i was a real believer i should be criticized right i should expect it and that's what i expecting more of it this week i'm gonna tomorrow i'm gonna film the token a video uh brother ram said the holy ghost is the token because jeffersonville is saying it's the tapes the tape is a token no it's not brother ram said it's the holy spirit it's the eternal token so they say the tape is the token then they say being a tape church is the token and all they've done church is they've done the same thing pentecost did when they made tongues the evidence they've made a man-made evidence that you can impersonate but the token is the same as it was in the day of pentecost amen god's spirit living in the soul of mankind amen so see it's got to be done it's someone's brother bam said uh he said uh he said if all i can do is put my voice against it he said i'll put my voice against it for that day because the preachers will say well you shouldn't be doing it but ram said brother bram said a man i think it might have been billy graham or oral roberts walked up and said let me lay my hands on you that you'll stop rebuking those women about their hair and makeup and brother ram said no you're not going to lay hands on me about that he then the man said it's not your business he said then whose business is it and that's what i say if other preachers aren't going to preach it whose business is it it's my business it just so happens i'm a nobody and nobody not too many people watching so i can do it by god's grace if nobody else is going to correct that person i'm going to correct them by god's grace because i'll do it in love you know church if i was wrong i want somebody to correct me right all it really is church is just divine love when you see somebody wrong you just go to them in love so really it's an evidence that you actually love people that are wrong you love them so much you don't want to continue to see them walking in the air that they're walking in praise god that's what it boils down to okay so he said make today count now brother ram says this you'll like this he said did you notice when pentecost fell those brothers were filled at pentecost with the holy ghost it wasn't hardly any time until the message had begun to dim down so see day of pentecost ah they're all shouting they're running out on the streets they're praising god they're you know 117 nations watch it 3 000 people get saved but he said it wasn't very long until it starts dimming down he said then they begin to set up churches to hold the fort for christ expecting him to come so see god gives you god gives you an amazing start a powerful emotional start then you start going through trials and he said they set up and you got to hold the fort right keep the castle right don't lose the castle anyone ever played king on the mountain in here we used to play we'd pile up the the the snow and man that was we had the best games on the snow because it's slippery and you could dig holes in your your hill you know you can dig holes and trails in there you know passages and you got to hold the fort you got to stand at the top that's what brother ram says you got to they begin to hold the floor expecting christ to come he said that's the same thing taking place today if the scripture is true i will restore saith the lord praise god all that the palmer and cankworm has eaten now if that is the message and god forgive me i don't know if it is then the time is close at hand because the message he said is over in other words he thought like the mystery of god was finished but he hadn't even preached the seals yet so see there was more revelation to come church i love going through these old sermons because i get to hear how brother random changed by the end because brother amen i've studied so much at the end focusing on the major revelations like you know marriage and divorce and seals everything like that that you know i haven't spent as much time in the older ones when i go back to the older ones i see how much he grew because i got like the other ones like some parts would memorize you know like the token and all these ones so like when you hear the old ones like i know he taught this later and so it's wonderful to see how god could help him grow in his understanding he didn't denominate and just figure he was right god could teach him something new and so he learns this and he says we gotta he said you were we're doing the same thing today it's like we're holding forth we just gotta keep our ground praise god we just gotta keep our church open that's what we gotta do we gotta hold the fort amen don't let the devil shut it down or don't be discouraged just hold the fort keep it alive until jesus comes amen hallelujah praise god i love it then brother braham says all the things he thinks might happen to him uh then he gets to this thought here now this is important i really wanted everybody to hear this uh amen and i talked a little bit about the anointings i want amen to hear this here yeah brother bam said that he said it could be the end of my road it could be the coming of the lord it could be the change of the day it could be the coming of that mighty one if there is to be another one besides what's already come it could be that all those things we'd have to draw from it would be and as i stand here tonight before god and you brethren i don't know i couldn't tell you if i did i'd tell you or i wouldn't mention it bring anything up like this if i didn't know which way if i know which way the thing was going i'd say it but i don't know i can't tell now right here listen to this i'm going right now on meetings without one speck of leading can you imagine that a holy ghost-filled prophet brother amen he said i'm going this is july i'm sorry june of 1962. he's about what nine months away from opening the seals he said i'm going in my meetings traveling around without one speck of leading in other words the angel the angels never told him like the angel used to tell remember go to africa go to india the angel used to tell him but now he's like i don't have one speck of leading yet he's born again so see if i if i ever say that amen don't judge me okay now kai don't be discouraged if i ever say that i don't have that feeling like i don't have any leading of the lord because but ma'am went through that same thing there's times we feel like we don't have any leading now here's my thought about this two months earlier brother ram had that dream about store up the tapes and the dream said don't go overseas stay home and record lots of tapes so that's what i believe that's why he felt like this because god two months earlier had already shut them down and said stay at home make a lot of sermons store up a lot of sermon tapes so you'll have they'll have them later when you go on to meet the lord that's what i believe and i could be wrong on that but i just wanted to read that brotherham said i didn't have one speck of leading oh my praise god see i like it because he's a man he's like me praise god there's a quote later in here where brother branham says you brothers think you got it hard he said it's much harder on me he said you've got you know one church looking to you he said i've got millions of people looking for me what are you gonna do brother graham what's the word of the lord how are you gonna operate he said i've got millions of people waiting for me to give the next word he says a lot he said i've got to sweat it out a lot more than you do oh help us jesus he said i'm going because i don't want to sit up there i like to get out in the woods as well as anybody he said if i'm wrong god forgive me then he says three things could happen to him i'm not going to get into all those right now oh yeah he says i might go into evangelist might be a prophet now here's the next thing i want to notice i want to just uh focus on this for about half hour here his next thought is and i hope everybody can understand this i hope people are listening at home by god's grace because this is an important topic here especially with the tape church movement brother adam starts getting into the fivefold ministry and he starts saying that if you're one of the gifts you can't be any of the other now he later fixed that he later corrected that in standing in the gap but amen and i were talking about that after church standing in the gap is kind of like brother brown's confession sermon where he says i'm i have sins i have complexes and he said pray for me that i could overcome my complexes so if you want to hear a good sermon on that it's standing in the gap 63 june um so this is what we see in the in this in this time so a year earlier brother ram is convinced a prophet this is his thinking a prophet has to sit out in the wilderness all by himself and not be with anybody but god corrects him a year later amen and that's what uh acts 15 is all about we'll get there in just a moment here so i want to be prepared for that so let me read that brother man said i cannot go on the way i've been going because the peoples believe me many times they regard me as being a prophet i do not regard myself that no sir i do not i don't say that to be humble i say that to be truthful i do not regard myself to be a prophet of the lord i haven't that honor so what brother brahm is saying i he said real men of god don't honor themselves and call themselves i'm the prophet right now how many know this though the brother amen i don't know if you know this but there's other tapes where brother bam is under the anointing in the prayer line and he'll say i'm god's prophet to you so when the anointing is so strong there and the angel the lord is standing right there brother man will say if you believe it if he said if you believe me to be god's prophet and if they do though you know god will heal them because they trust god and so that's we got to be careful too you know some people don't like that but brother graham was saying like he's saying i don't have the honor to call myself a prophet but the holy ghost when they would get on him really strong and the angel of the lord standing right there the angel of the lord would permit him to say that oh my that stumbles a lot of people but doesn't stumble me i can understand that because you never want to feel exalted like look at me i'm some big buddy big person people need to look to me so to me brother is being very humble i have in that honor he said i do believe the lord has used me in a special way maybe laying a foundation for a prophet that will come now here's where it gets back but a prophet doesn't operate the way i operate a prophet is an evangelist an evangelist isn't a prophet a pastor is an evangelist an evangelist isn't a pastor and then he quotes the scripture but god is set in the church apostles and prophets and teachers and pastors and so forth okay now here's uh just a few thoughts on this i understand what brother branham is saying but let me share this here how many remember when i preach on the parable the talents how many remember the talents and how remember you can have different amounts of talents so that's how i believe that quote applies to the scripture you some people might just have one talent now what i mean by that you just might be a pastor that's all you will be you don't you're not evangelist you'll never do evangelist work you'll never do prophet work right you'll never do a uh teaching work but i believe it's scriptural and i showed you this morning paul was an apostle and a teacher and a prophet undoubtedly no one can deny that he had three at least those three gifts and i believe he had all five but see the parable the talents is so beautiful because the highest number of talents was five amen and five is grace and there's five preaching gifts amen i think god has a good sense of humor he hides it from the eyes of the wise and prudent reveals it unto babe such as would learn oh thank you jesus oh hallelujah so what i'm saying is that some people will just have one gift like this um well i don't want to call names but there's some people that you know they just they're just a teacher that's all they that's all they do which is okay they just teach god's word they're not a pastor they never prophesy things like that they never prophesy which is okay um and so to me that parable of five two or one five two one the talents that allows there to be this this uh this calling from god where you could have all five gifts of the holy spirit as far as preaching or just two or just one okay or three or four praise god now i see at least three in my life i see a pastor teacher evangelist and i've had people tell me that as well i've see i can see all those three and i told you i've twice shared two things that were prophetic according to my friend jacob he said two of those things i he said prophesied but i i wasn't trying to i just was just praying so i don't consider myself to have any gift of prophecy but i do consider those three and then you know with the nine gets the holy spirit you know brother braham said martin luther had all nine so now you have even more like you have these certain you have certain levels you know you have levels of responsibility five two one you have the different levels so i believe you could have the preaching in there plus the gifts of the spirit you know you could have you could have all this responsibility um but this is the quote where a lot of people struggle and let me just say this i know uh i know at least one pastor bless his heart i'm not going to say where he's from but i invited him to come preach here and he said brother jesse i can't preach there because brother ram said you can't be a pastor an evangelist and church i went to his church and he's so sad uh i can tell he's so sad he's so frustrated just being a pastor and i was just like trying to encourage him you know and i can see how that type of mindset you know if it's not from god it could it could be a discouragement it could limit you when god wants to use you in a in a greater way i can clearly see that now do i believe there's times where you could be more focused on one another yes that's why i haven't gone on any missionary or evangelistic trips overseas for what seven years now yeah 2013 was the last time i just told him no every time no no no sorry sorry i'm saying with my family now i'm pastoring the church now i just feel led to pastor right now that's mainly what i do and there can be times like brother branham brother brown was a pastor for 17 years and then god called him out to be a missionary and evangelist praise god and at the end of his life god called him to be a teacher of the church ages and the seven seals amen we're listening to our house there are to me there's no better teaching tapes than the seven seals if you want to hear some solid teaching my goodness those are the best tapes i've ever heard on teaching just one scripture after another all the thoughts that brother man brings out each sermon is like three hours you know it's just a treasure of uh teaching because he sat there day after day and could just study every day don't have to go pray for the sick or anything just study study study study preach it's one of the most beautiful teaching uh series ever all right that's my opinion okay now okay so here is i want to read now now i want to read i want to go back uh to standing in the gap that i mentioned earlier here's what brother bam says uh remember brother branham is at a restaurant and he sees mountain men remember he does the big sneeze the big wachui and everybody laughs on the tape when they listen to it brother ram said he saw a man a big mountain man and uh he sneezed and and he didn't apologize brother graham said he'd like that he thought that was a real man's man and then there was a man sitting next to brother a man sitting across from another poor man and looked a lot like brother branham and brother ram got in the car with billy paul and said billy one day i'm going to be like those men and billy paul said daddy don't do that he said no i'm going to do that someday i'm just going to be a wilderness man like that like all you know not no haircuts no no shave in his face you know old ratty clothes on problem said i want to be like that and brother abraham is driving along billy paul goes to sleep and the angel lord says carry out your plans and you'll be like that the beggar that old man beggar with the that was sitting next to the big mountain woods man and brother man says lord i don't want to be like that now look at that brother one hour you can be saying i want to be like that the next hour i don't want to be like that doesn't that sound like a human to you doesn't that sound like somebody has mind battles like you and i one minute i'll be like no way we're gonna do that okay let's do it the next minute or yes i feel that i really want to do this next hour no i better not do that so he goes from wanting to be a woodsman and when he live in the woods and dress already until he says no the angel lord in the presence of angel lord no i don't want to do that the angel said your wife will go too can you imagine that your wife will leave you if you go up to the mountains she won't live up there in them hills like that you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you would i said lord i don't want to be like that i don't want you to i don't want to have to live like that i want to do something different now look what he tells the lord but i was told that you'd call me to be a prophet and i want to live in the wilderness like a prophet now look what brother branham says next brother adam says but i was using my own excuse so i could hunt my own good so if i can just say this i know some people might faint if i say this but i'm gonna say it anyway brother brown was being selfish i know people might have a heart attack if so call 9-1-1 or let me pray for you he says it was my own good now let me say this how many know elijah was a wilderness man elijah came from the wilderness a tishbite nope and it's it's clear in the scripture nobody knows where he came from nobody knows where he went other than heaven right he went to heaven the rapture and so brother man that that's in his mind all the time well prophet's got to be like elijah you know out at the uh the brook of cherith right all by himself ravens feeding him you know so brother people are told brother baby you're like elijah you're like a like and so he had this idea sorry about that my fault yeah it's probably my fault so brother ram tells the lord he said lord but i thought i'm supposed to be a prophet and live out in the woods and brother bam said i admitted later i was just saying that so i could go hunting more he wanted to be out in the woods so he could hunt more so he didn't have to be with the people as much see now don't you appreciate that that he was honest i appreciate that now look what the lord says but he said but that was the prophets of the old testament you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that so i hope everybody understands that old testament prophet must be way down here a new testament prophet must be way up here now we're not we're not exalting ourselves remember jesus said even the least in the new testament is greater than john the baptist now i it's hard to understand how can amen how can we be better than john the baptist i have i don't know i don't even it's hard to believe but the angel the lord tells brother branham you've been called a much higher office than an old testament prophet he says you have more gifts besides that besides being a prophet see you have more gifts praise god paul had a gift to be a teacher he had a gift to be an apostle a gift to be a prophet and a a pastor evangelist he had all these gifts and it's a higher calling than an old testament prophet he said you was called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel and in the apostolic form you know of greater things many great gifts now let me read this little list to you let me ask you church who is the greatest prophet ever who's the greatest prophet ever starts with a jay jesus did jesus hide away out in the wilderness all by himself no he was with the people right how about haggai and zachariah remember we preached on that a few months ago were they just hiding out all by themselves or were they working right there with zerubbabel they were right there see so see people had just put it in brother ram's mind see elijah was he was every prophet is like that he just stomps out in the wilderness he says thus saith the lord is not going to be never going to be rained till i call for it and he stomps out right that's what that's what elijah did and people have told brother graham you're just like that you're just like that but then he started thinking well if i'm like that then i can go hunt more and the lord had to correct him on that how about jeremiah does anyone know jeremiah did jeremiah hide out all by himself or was he in the city he was in the city he saw zedekiah church he saw zedekiah get chased down brought back got his eyes poked out they carried him to babylon and jeremiah went with them jeremiah was spared because he didn't rebel against the king but zedekiah was eventually you know taken out how about isaiah was isaiah all by all by himself or was he with the people right amongst the people so see church this is why it's so important we have to take everything brother ma'am said back to the word of god because now i see i see a pastor that he's all sad and discouraged because he can't come preach you know he he's basically locked himself in isolation because he's taken these quotes but not taking it back to the scripture and not even taking it to standing in the gap where you could have more than one gift you could have multiple gifts and i'm not i'm not saying anything against that pastor i love the brother wonderful he let me preach for him a couple times i had a wonderful time at his church the holy spirit was really moving and drawing people to a closer walk with the lord but i'm just saying this is why we have to be we have to be open to learning more right we got to be open to taking every thought back to the word and growing our understanding okay so i hope that's helpful by god's grace i hope that helps you that's what kind of came to me as i was sitting back there i wanted to make sure i read that here so just so you know brother man was using his own excuse his own excuse his own selfish desire was to be out in the woods and the angel lord has to correct him and say no your wife will leave you you'll be a bum and god has to correct him oh great is god's faithfulness praise god great is his faithfulness and then you want to hear what the angel said next he said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where's your reward so see we were talking about remember this morning i was saying how you want to wait on the lord well i guess brother brown was waiting too long he said why do you wait to move so long now i'm not sure let's read it here okay so he doesn't say anything more about that so i'm not sure about what he's talking about but then the angel says you've lost the feeling for the people so the whole reason he wanted to go hunting was could he want to get away from his church he want to get away from all the churches because they he said he'd preach about holiness and the next time he come back they were worse and it hurt brother branham so much he left his family he left everything to preach to them and they wouldn't obey it hurt him so much he said fine he'll i'll just go up in the wilderness and they don't they don't have to hear it if they don't want to hear it so see church we really got to make sure our hearts don't get overtaken in complexes if you ever feel a hard feeling towards somebody please go talk to them and please just love them just love them right don't let satan try to inject something that will cause you to separate yourself from other people you know god wouldn't let brother branham do that and so we've got to stay with our family praise god we must be right here you know that's what happened to my dad when my dad uh got under depression and maybe i'll share you know malachi knows him you know my children know grandpa but when he really got under depression children we had we had a building we lived in there was two stories he'd wake up early one of the first ones to wake up he'd go down in his office and just smoke cigarettes and drink coffee all day he would only come up to eat maybe once or twice and i'd have to go this was every day for years before they got divorced i think he got divorced when i was in seventh grade what grady in malcolm eighth your eighth your seventh okay well you're the eighth next year yeah so you're at the age uh when my parents got divorced same age it really hurt me it really hurt but see the devil isolated him it made him live in the same house but he wasn't there he really wasn't there and i would go down and see him just to spend time with him and every time i go down there brother amen he was sitting like this just reading the bible smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee at his desk all day all day all day uh and so that's what i'm saying like we don't i love my dad and he's you know he's doing a little bit a little bit better but we don't want to let satan isolate us that's what satan was trying to do to brother branham now he would not have smoked and drank you know my dad didn't drink you know maybe not much at all but that's what's the same thing satan was trying to do he was trying to take those gifts and separate them from the people when they were made for the people praise god brother brother amen your singing gift is for the people praise god we need it praise god and when you play the tambourine sister we need that praise god maokai and acacia every one of us everyone that has everybody we need everybody's gifts praise god we might not see until later did you know this brother amen jim shumake didn't even preach or pass now he's pastor up in albion he didn't even start preaching her pastor until like he was in his 50s and he's one of the most faithful pastors i've never i've never seen a pastor love their people so much as him and he even start preaching though he's in his 50s so every service after service he was so faithful to the message and brother pastor after pastor came and they stole the money from the people or they married another woman and had adultery and they just went through one bad pastor after another and finally they the churches split and finally they said we need a pastor and everybody said jim you're lester and it was that moment because nobody else come to visit him it was at that moment brother jim said god spoke to my heart said i am the path and he's been a faithful pastor so let me just encourage you with that not all gifts operate right away there's gifts laying in people's lives you know i hope there's some more in my life too i see some of them but i'd like to see more by god's grace like we can see acacia's singing gift you know now we can see that malachi we can clearly see it with the piano playing and instruments girls with we can hear it but there's more there's got to be more and so we have to just stay faithful to god and not be selfish don't become isolated right like brother tried to isolate himself my dad i say himself don't isolate yourself be with the people love the people even if the people speak evil against you love them anyway praise god amen love them anyway there were some years where it was really hard to come to church here because people were really mean to me but i kept coming i kept coming i didn't give up and now look at me i'm happier than ever praise god we just we all got to go through trials amen what if i would have quit out of have been awful praise i would still be in i'll probably be depressed like my dad i probably i would probably repeat his cycle right because that's what satan likes to do like with you know like gambling or something or adultery or uh you know just sins satan likes to anoint the sons to do like their fathers but we've got to break the cycle praise god and i have broke this cycle by god's grace okay let's give me 20 more minutes here we'll try to finish up by god's grace okay now brother ram he gets so deep into this thought about how you can't you can't mix the gifts he says this let me read a little bit here he says if god called me to be his prophet then i'm certainly not holding the office of one prophets don't evangelize look what he says a prophet hides himself in the wilderness alone with god until he gets exactly directly what god wants him to do now is that the case not always i just i just read you five prophets that were with the people the whole time moses only left for 40 days he came right back that's another one moses he was right with him yeah he was so much with him brother amen that he had to say god i don't i can't judge all these people so god said i'll anoint 70 judges i'll take the spirit on you and i'll put it on 70 others amen see moses it was hard job but he was not separate from the people he was right with the people we'll see brother ramsey he just has this idea in his mind well prophet's got to be just like elijah you stomp you come in stomp that say thor you leave out well that was elijah that was elijah it's not every prophet see he said a prophet stomps right out gives his message and goes back in the wilderness and goes again he's not an evangelist holding meetings now listen this the man said a prophet doesn't hold meetings and getting cooperations and all these things like evangelists do he don't teach like evangelists he has thus saith the lord and that's it and that's all can you believe that if that's what he thought can you imagine if that's if that's all jesus did jesus come and said thus saith the lord here's a sermon on the mount and he walked away and he never healed the sick can you imagine that would have been like a a just such a difference ministry but brother amen he said come over here little children come over here and sit on my lap jesus said come on over here let the little children come unto me amen i love it praise god amen this word is so true brother see see how we can get our minds we can get so sure we're so sure we're right we can be wrong god help help me to be humble that i can be corrected if i'm wrong that's my prayer he said a prophet gives it throws it out and let the chips fall where it may and he goes away again nobody knows where he's at he's in isolation somewhere oh my goodness but even elijah wasn't always like that because remember when remember when the woman that had the baby prayed for it maybe the baby died remember she knew right where to find him right she come and knock she sent her messengers and my the baby's dead go with elijah bring his staff remember that in the book of kings she knew right where he was he wasn't hiding away in some isolation so here's what i think church i think jeffersonville i think in other people they take these one quotes like this that's all he does he just gives thus saith the lord he doesn't teach he just gives us the lord he stomps out with us they say that uh just to just to try to make uh brother brown different from everybody else and they try to start these these uh these false teachings and they don't read on they don't read the rest of it they don't read even the scripture many times elijah wasn't hiding out the whole time in isolation okay now let's go to acts 15 and remember what i just said what i just read brother braham said he don't hold meetings the ramp said a prophet doesn't hold meetings okay he doesn't get cooperation with anybody if you read your bible lately in chapter 15 you know what i'm talking about paul had cooperations and he had meetings with people see brother amen this is why i'm sharing with you in malachi everything by braham says we got to make sure it lines up with the bible if not we'll get a false idea and we'll just go off on some false doctrine i just read it to you said they don't have meetings they don't hold meetings and they don't get cooperation they don't teach people acts 15 1 and certain men which came down from judea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be saved what a false doctrine verse two and where and there i'm sorry when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other men should go up to jerusalem under the apostles and elders about this question was paul going to cooperate with other people yes was paul going to hold a meeting yes oh but every word on the tape is thus saith the lord no it's not no it's not you guys we got to take everything back to the word verse 3 and being brought on their way by the church they pass through venice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they call us great joy unto all the brother well there he's had meetings right there right he's having meetings verse 4 when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and declared all things that god had done with them but there rose up of the certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to be to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses and the apostles and elders came together for to consider this matter here see what it said they came together all the churches all those pastors are apostles prophets they all came together to have a meeting brother ram just said a prophet doesn't hold meetings hallelujah verse 7 and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said to them men and brethren you know how that god a good while ago made choice god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe and god which knoweth the hearts bear them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith now therefore why tempt you god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear but we believe that through the grace of our lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they amen then all the multitude kept silent so this is a pretty big group of people and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them and after they had held their peace look this is awesome peter goes first then paul and barnabas and james is the last one to go and james was one of the first ones to die for christ and remember jay this is the same james that wrote the book of james he was called a pillar in the church like our little baby james there sweet little baby james same same name he stands up in verse uh yeah 13. james answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me simeon hath declared how god did at first visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name now there's a good bride scripture right there why do you take the people to share his name to get to marry them to give them his name praise god i'm glad my wife became a smith instead of a hesterman praise god i took her out for my name and i got a son from my name and daughters for my name verse 15. and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written so this is beautiful how is james going to prove to this multitude that they shouldn't they don't have to be circumcised to be saved he quotes the prophets amen so a prophet like james quotes more prophets and it's because of james sermon here his short sermon and he quotes numerous prophets i believe it's amos and isaiah after james speaks everybody says amen now we're convinced praise the lord so how's god going to convince people today that this message is the truth through the word of god amen through the prophets through all their prophecies that's how i was convinced you're convinced we're all convinced through the word of the prophets amen verse 16 and after this i will return and we'll build again the tabernacle of david which has fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up that the residue of men might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things praise the lord now verse 18 known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world sorry now look uh in verse 19 and 20 james gives four things the gentiles should not do uh verse 20 yeah here it is absane from pollutions i'm sorry pollutions of idols don't get into idols don't fornicate uh don't eat things strangled animals strangled and then don't drink blood and then he says moses now look at verse 22. here it is i'll finish here soon then pleased at the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judah's surname and silas chief men among the brethren and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greetings unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch so they write letters and they send them out to all the churches yeah now look at verse verse 30. so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them and after that they tarry their space they were let go in the peace from the brethren unto the apostles notwithstanding it please silas to abide there still paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also praise god amen this is paul's apostolic pattern as a prophet did he hold meetings yes or no church did he hold meetings yes did he cooperate with people yes or no yes he sat there and let paul let everybody take a turn preaching ah glory praise god he he could have said everybody shut up and sit down i'm the proud i'm the prophet he didn't say that neither did brother branham because he knows we're all led by the holy spirit we all have to have a gift of the holy spirit we must all use that spirit for god's glory and then he let james stand up james stood up and said here's what the prophet said let's do this and everybody said amen hallelujah james i like that write it down and they wrote letters and they said paul barnabas you take it to that one uh you take it this one silas and you just take these letters all out and he cooperated with all the brethren oh thank you jesus this just makes me so happy and then remember verse 36 does do prophets have cooperation let's see and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and let's see how they do paul say let's go into isolation no sir he did not go into isolation he kept ministering now look how he did it church and i'll close with this he went from one church to another the prophet went to the church now it's different today let me say it like this today the church of jeffersonville they bypass all the pastors and they go straight to the people because they got a mailing list and i i've heard it i mean we it's uh it's known to everybody they have a mailing list of everybody who ever orders from them and they send out their ideas just straight to the people that's not how a prophet operates a prophet goes to the church and he goes to the pastor you see that and that's how that's how their false doctrine is even spread they skip the pastor and they come right to the people let's stand our feet musicians you can come here i think i'll just stop with that because i think that's a real blessing i think everybody can see can anybody see that paul had multiple gifts can we see that paul did not isolate himself away from other jesus christ did not operate i'm sorry did not isolate himself from other people he stayed with the people jeremiah isaiah moses haggai zechariah they were all right with the people there may have been times moses went away for 40 days right elijah went off for what three and a half years the brook sheriff well maybe it wasn't their whole three and a half years because he went and uh stayed by that woman's house that that uh fed him with the meat the meat offering and everything the meal offering but church i hope it's clear to you and i that we have to be very careful when we listen to the tapes not that we're going to be deceived but that we just don't take the wrong idea but we know brother brahma was not out to deceive anybody we know he was a godly man a holy ghost-filled man we have to make sure that we don't listen to one specific quote and take that quote too far without taking it back to the word of god how many want to take everything back to the word of god see i thought those were some really important examples bang were you able to hear that one that last one okay praise the lord i want you to hear it too uh just to see that but abraham said prophets don't hold meetings they're in isolation they don't meet with anybody yet paul was with people all the time remember he was how long was he with ephesus church three years he didn't he didn't hide away from the ephesians he was with them he was right there working remember he was with the thessalonicans and he said i don't want your money he said i'm gonna make my own tents he was so with them that he wouldn't even take their money he said i'm going to set up my own tents i'll be a tent worker i just want everybody to see that i'm here to be a servant he was so careful and yet then other times he would receive from the corinthians he received from the philippians at times so we're just led by the holy spirit praise god let's uh you got a song on your heart but you'd like to see okay i want to sing that one again i stand amazed let's sing that one i love it i just love to catch inspiration on a song i like to just sing it and wear it out [Music] let me pull this up [Music] let's start with the first verse i stand the maze in the presence of jesus [Music] is [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] more stop wouldn't die alone [Applause] [Music] is [Music] wonderful [Music] is [Applause] singers [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] let's just worship the lord now church i just want to say you know sometimes i get criticized because i bring out these quotes and people think i'm trying to correct brother branham i'm not trying to correct brother branham i'm just trying to preach the truth brother and brought such great revelations we'll never correct the major things they're already the major things don't need any correction it's these little minor details that makes perfect sense he had to come and finish the mystery of god he gave us thus saith the lord on baptism godhead everything you know all these all these marriage and divorce church ages we have thus all these major doctrines and just on these little minor things they're so important though because we can see if they're not taught right people get the wrong idea and they start making something a doctrine that shouldn't be a doctrine i hope church that you understand i'm not trying to exalt myself or anything like that i just want to know the truth i just wanted to take everything like brother bram said i want to think in man's filter praise god i just want to filter for my mind i just don't and brother bam said he said we shouldn't be just a bunch of yes men maybe i have to bring that quote on wednesday lebron said i appreciate a man who's got convictions just doesn't say i believe everything you say how come people don't use that quote i want to i want the word of god to filter i'm going to take the message and filter it i'm sorry i'm going to take brother sermons and filter them through the message this is the message amen this is the message the revelation of this is the message but the man's sermons point to the message they point to the word of god and this is our filter a thinking man's filter praise god that's okay i don't mind being criticized like i said i just want to be truthful i want this word of god to be preached i want to see our church live it praise god i know there are other churches living it but i want our church to live all the word of god praise god anyone have any needs of prayer tonight anything like that is everybody okay any needs of prayer all right in that case we'll close here let's close with the word do you have a song any other songs okay one more okay let's close then we'll sing that song here then people need to go they can go have you enjoyed the word today i love this i i appreciate it you know i appreciate charis the last two wins in ice carris will come up and say daddy i really enjoyed that servant thank you karis brother jim and jim shoemake on wednesday night said i really enjoyed your sermon brother jesse thank you i hope it helps you church it's really helping me that i can see everything we do must be taken back to god's word the missionary work our church uh we need to train preachers if these brothers want to raise up and preach who knows amen but god raised up anybody we know how to do it we train them in the word and then god may send them out we need to have a we need to have an apostolic church that follows her blueprints her cream this is my greed i don't dream of christ i'm gonna follow my bylaws all of god's problems thank you lord heavenly father we love you these little simple tonight for father i believe your prophet would be happy we take everything he says back to the word not to be arrogant but to be to be right actually to obey what he said he said prove all things test and the bible says try every spirit you lord for sending us a godsend promise now lord help us to rise your prophet said it was the most important thing of the day of the gift of god that can rightly divide the word of truth for the people now help us raise our faith prepare us for thy coming let us love one another let's not isolate from each other but let us gather more jesus christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Music] so me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] you
