========================================

let's go to Colossians chapter 3 verse 12. I'd like to continue on this book of Colossians series here by the grace of the Lord you know last Sunday when I preached on you never did in the first place I got a couple testimonies back on that one so I'm very thankful that George was able to minister to that in fact Emma sent me a message and said brother Jesse I was just reading First John 3 verse 9 that more Sunday morning and I was wondering about that verse and that's the very verse I opened up with last Sunday morning so I thought that's really nice when the Lord he'll discern the thoughts and tense of the children heart praise God so I thought that was a real blessing and so I just thought I'd share that one that was really encouraging Colossians chapter 3 verse 12 here we'll look to the Lord here the Lord to minister here Colossians 3. left off on verse 11 last time and how we could be renewed in the knowledge of Christ each and every day we need a renewed understanding A Renewed knowledge of the Lord praise God so we're grateful for that Colossians 3 verse 12. we can let's read this together on three one two three put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved vows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness and long-suffering amen let's have a word of prayers we have our hearts here again in the presence of the Lord father we're grateful for all these requests Lord God again we remember these needs father we ask God you minister to each one Lord God father we just want to give you thanks and praise again for this opportunity to gather in your house today Lord God and

God and Lord we know you'll continue to renew our minds in the knowledge of your will so father anoint me God anoint your people today Father God we're we're here to feed on the words of Life Lord God

just have your way today Lord Jesus we love you we worship you how great you are today Lord God how great is our God how great is his word Lord Hallelujah so we worship and love you today anoint us now in Jesus Christ's name and Saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I trust you enjoyed Wednesday night you know I sent brother Simon a text and um I texted him nine things you know it was such a special sermon to me I texted him nine things that uh you know he he had touched on in a sermon that either I'd recently preached or gone through and I told him after service I you know I said I don't know if I've ever had a more clear discernment of my life in a sermon in other words I just felt like the Lord Jesus Christ was speaking directly to me that's what I felt like and so I was thankful I was I was grateful um so I think I'll just read that list real quick here so you can hear it might help you because it just helped encourage me to know that Jesus really loves me praise God if he's willing to come down and preach so many things and Simon said he was hurried on that sermon you know he didn't know what to preach he said he was just he said he was just being faithful just coming and you know as a preacher sometimes you know like you got the sermon I'm going to preach this other times you just got to trust God but he preached about you know we're we were called gods in the Bible I just preached that the previous Wednesday he preached about how we're Sons and Daughters I just preached that the previous Wednesday he preached about Ephesians 5 and the mystery of Christ in the church I just preached it on Sunday those actual verses I preach it on Sunday preach about mind battles coming in at night and that's what happened to me on that previous Saturday night I just had this mind battle I think it was it was really awful just a spirit of fear came on me like I told the church and he didn't even know I went through that um he preached about us being tired I was so tired on Wednesday night I don't know why I was just so tired I was almost falling asleep at work during my planning period I was just so tired I don't know why he's talking about being tired and then he's saying you know he's saying that song I bless your name and then it talks about the Midnight Hour how we need to sing song that's that that mind battle came right before midnight when I had that battle it was the song was just right it was right what I had gone through seventh he mentioned Donald Trump and that's kind of what the vine battle was about you know are they going to arrest him and then are they going to come and arrest us next I don't know I mean you might I laugh at that now but when I was laying there in bed it just came upon me like a spirit of fear I was thinking about getting the gun out and getting ready to shoot you know people that might come in to arrest me or it was just you know it's one of those mind battles I'm human too you know I go through I go through my battles um you know in eighth he said he started off by saying you know we battle the unknown right just the unknown like what's going to happen next week what's going to happen next year what's gonna happen with my life that's kind of what I was battling the unknown and then ninth he preached on people being insane in this age and just the day before I was studying for to find that quote when brother Branham said thus say the Lord he said this world will go insane he said it's thus save the Lord so those are just nine now I I could have gone back and found probably more but I've never had a sermon where I felt like it was directly Discerning Jesse you thought this you preached this you went through this nine of them and Nine's a pretty good number Nine's the uh there's nine gifts of the Spirit there's nine fruits of the spirit it's kind of like the number of fruitfulness I thought well praise the Lord I just want to encourage you you know and I thought I told Brother Simon said Don't Let The Devil ever tell you you're not called to preach because I've never had a sermon like that and I appreciate all the sermons like brother amen sermons my sermons for the Dig sermons I appreciate all the sermons but I don't think I've had ever a sermon where it kind of revealed like nine thoughts and intents in my heart you know in in my Christian walk and here I've been serving God since you know 2000 in the message since you know the end of 2001 here 21 years later I don't know if I've ever had a time where the Lord spoke more directly than he did on Wednesday night so that makes me encourage her it makes me more excited to come to church because I'm just I'm anticipating I have expectation as brother amen preach I got expectation God's going to speak to me praise God and he's going to minister to my needs so I think we can all be encouraged today and I just thought I might start off you know maybe just sharing that part of my testimony and by the grace of God so let's look at part eight and you know I just we read our texts and again just briefly the outline of chapter one Paul's greeting Paul's prayer that's the prayer I prayed for the Amish group down there for that they would be in all the wisdom of God and and fulfill all the will of God uh the Colossians needed to know about the Supreme deed of Christ the power of the Cross and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then chapter two the treasures in the mystery of the godhead all the treasures are in Christ we must overcome enticing words we must oh now look in our church in in their battle the Colossians battle they weren't battling physical persecution right they were they weren't getting threatened well we're going to come in and arrest you guys that wasn't it Satan was attacking them through deceiving words through Temptations like mind battles that they would try to deceive them to leave the faith sound familiar sounds like something we could relate to praise God Satan's trying to get us in such awful mind battles where we want to uh where Satan wants to try to convince us to leave the faith leave the truth right and so that's what they were battling they weren't over they weren't battling uh the swords of the Romans they were battling uh Satan's fiery darts in their mind battles and they had to overcome philosophy and legalism and mysticism and people hearing from angels and now we do believe God sends angels we we do believe we have Guardian Angels praise God but when any Angel would say anything that goes against the word of God that's a satanic angel right and so we started chapter three and uh we must set our affection on things above we must have our focus on Heavenly things and then last time we looked at specifics we need to mortify in Christian Living okay now I just was thinking you know I was you know looking at thinking at the you know just preaching a sermon on the book of Colossians and I thought is the Gospel of Jesus Christ still needed in this year do we still need to preach on the book of Colossians can the world use these words that we're going to preach today can the world use them can we can we use them and I thought of course and uh that's what we need more of we need more of the word of God Amen so let's look today to the word of God and here I'll set my timer so we'll try to look at it maybe an hour 15 here we'll try to see how this goes and trust the Lord will Minister tonight I think I might preach a little bit now children I might do a Bible study but I want to preach on how to take care of your body in preparation next Saturday I got to speak at my wife's uh herbal event I kind of want to make tonight my run through right my practice round and then I let my wife listen to it later because she's going to Sheffield and my wife can say well maybe you could add this and maybe I'm preaching a bunch of people that probably do a lot better than I do with my health because you know last couple nights ago I bought some ice cream sandwiches but they're all organic okay so I had an ice cream sandwich last night I try to I try to do it with moderate moderation praise God in other words I will not and I haven't done this I haven't eaten a whole container of ice cream in one sitting I have not done that I've been tempted to do that but I haven't done that but you know I've had great testimonies you know my wife as far as my wife helping me with health overall health I've had wonderful testimonies like the Candida testimony that has been life-changing for me and virtue looked at me last week and she said why do you look so young Pastor Jesse that I'm right I don't I wasn't even thinking about it I don't know and it must be because I don't you know I don't abuse my body so you know she brought that up so much I didn't think about that um but there is there are so many the Bible says golly exercise I'm sorry bodily exercise profits a little so um you know I want to have that little benefit so I can serve the Lord longer so I could be more faithful praise God so that I I really want to take you know I want to take encouragement from that scripture also from Daniel look at Daniel you know we'll look at that tonight and Daniel and his friends said we're going to have a different physical diet then uh was it the Persians or Babylonians Babylonians at that time and look what it did it made they were smarter they actually looked healthier they looked younger so um you know we want to recognize that and the reason behind that is because we don't want to have we don't want to get caught up in the spirit of the days of Noah where it's eating drinking and cares of the world uh like you know like my wife and I have seen we've seen people destroy their physical health and then say God deliver me from this devil yet you were the one that let the devil in your addiction to Diet Coke let the devil in gave you cancer like that was you like say to them you know you let Saint in and said Lord deliver me from Satan you blame it on Satan but it really wasn't Satan it was it was their own choices okay so that's kind of and then you know but it just shows those people that do that they don't have the anointing of the Holy Ghost they've actually turned down that anointing of the Holy Ghost for temperance right that you know so I don't know how that works out you know did they ever have it I don't know did they lose it I don't know um but if it's part of the word of God we want to live it praise God we want to we want to live by every word that proceeds out the mouth of God so let's look to the Lord here you know uh we opened up with chapter 3 verse 12. now we just got I'm going to open up my Bible here too we just looked at all the things we have to crucify in our lives I guess that ties in perfectly with what we're talking about here uh more to reverse uh five I'm going to go down to verse five yeah mortify these things in your in your body fornication uncleanness which was luxurious living so anything that would involve a luxurious life inordinate affection that means Cravings evil concoctions forbidden things Covetous covetousness which is idolatry and then Paul says put off anger put off wrath put off malice put off blasphemy put off filthy communication that comes out of your mouth put off lying in verse 9. and put on the new man praise God put on the new man so we're encouraged to crucify these met these Temptations and Cravings in our flesh in our minds and put on the new man like you'd put on new clothes praise God and then Paul says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved vows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long-suffering for bearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye praise God so I want to look at the word elect here again this elect word is a very beautiful word it means you are picked out by God God picked you he said of all these people that are going to live they're going to choose me and they're going to want my favor they're going to want my Mercy they're going to love the cross they're going to love me he couldn't force you to love him he had to foreknow that you would choose to love him and so you are the elect so he says we are the elect We're The Chosen we're the picked out by God and I like it we're the best of our class and again we don't pat ourselves in the back we're the best and we're we're the elector we're Gods we we have to recognize it's the truth but we don't we don't major on that we don't major on exalting ourselves but we have to recognize that God calls us the elect and that'll encourage us as the elect of God put on God's anointing we are in excellence in preeminence uh applied to the Christian in other words we are the wise virgins praise God we're the Believers that are filled with the Holy Ghost praise God and Desiring or Desiring to be filled with the Holy Ghost and so we have the foolish version don't have that desire until it's too late think about that all the foolish versions that have lived they've never had they've never had that real desire to get born again they never really had that desire but there's going to come a time at the Rapture they're really going to have a desire to be born again but it's going to be too late because the Rapture will already happen it already happens right because they go seeking for it after it's too late so we got to seek for it now praise God Amen that's right put all your heart into the services put all your heart into servant Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah so put on therefore as the wise virgins we'd say in other words clothe yourself so in other words this is a mind choice you know in our minds we've got to put on a mind that we are the elective God that God chose me and we're virtuous which means it's holy me holy means virtuous or separated or full of God's virtue full of God's character and we're dearly beloved that's what the word beloved means we're love dearly so as God's God's elect that are loved dearly he says put on bows of Mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness which is gentleness and long-suffering which is patience and slowness in avenging wrongs so that means church that we're going to have people do us wrong sometimes we might you know as one another as Christians we might do one another wrong but the Bible says have long suffering and be slowness to avenge yourself in fact I think the Bible says we should be so slow at avenging ourselves that we should not avenge ourselves we should let God have Vengeance praise God because vengeance is mine saith the Lord amen I just want to remind us of this I know cam preached a sermon on this wow I don't know if it was here or at his place but he was sure maybe he was just sharing with me on the phone and he actually had uh he'd share this part about Mercy I'd never heard before Mercy is compassion shown towards someone when it's in your power to harm them or punish them so that makes Mercy to me when Kim said I was like wow that was a that was you know when we say oh God have mercy on me in other words God you could harm me uh you could re you could you have you're in a position where you could not bless me I mean you're Justified and not blessing me but I'm asking for your mercy I'm still asking that you would show me compassion even though I don't deserve it right so I thought that was a good thought on Mercy as the Bible says there uh bowels of mercies now I don't I don't think I put it yeah so the word bow means like your intestines or your heart or your liver it means you're inward body parts so the very the very depths of your being have mercy out of the depths of your being so let Mercy come from the very inside of the inside praise God Hallelujah that's what Paul says uh crucify these Cravings crucify uh the sin nature the sin the the sin nature you're battling every day and put on God's virtue put on God's love and and have the very deepest mercies you can have for one another praise God it's a beautiful thought there when it's in your power to punish someone you show Mercy when it's in your it's in your power and you have the ability to harm someone but you don't harm them praise God you show Mercy he said have bowels of mercies praise God I'm going to get to this later but uh you know there's a friend I told you about a year ago this happened to me I told you this I put it on the podcast too I had a really good friend over the years we've been great friends he sent me this text and I sent him a text back and it wasn't the answer he was looking for and uh he said we're no longer friends and everything we've done for all these 20 years was all it was all fake and it wasn't real because I didn't say the right things in other words he was testing me to see what I would say and I was so shocked there I didn't know what to say now church I was mistreated and I I was in a place I could have text back some really harsh things because this wasn't the first time this had happened to me but we still love all of our friends praise God and so I just didn't text back for six weeks and finally I just didn't text I just said Lord this is in your hands when brother Dennis McBride came and uh he preached something and told me exactly what to do he's he said uh if people he said sometimes God has to take friends away for you in order to serve God better and I just come to the altar I wept and cried and I said they just gotta let you gotta let God handle it God brings people into your lives God takes people out of your lives but I realize him that whole six weeks it was in my power to say some really harsh things I could have but I didn't and then six weeks later I got to Texas said please forgive me I had a spirit of critical spirit on me it seemed like we had a lot of critical spirits around here that's okay it's better than uh some other Spirits praise God Amen Hallelujah and uh and then I talked to them on the phone and I even saw them at a a meeting not maybe about maybe about seven months ago and everything was all right I just thought uh I just thought it was just a good example of how I was tempted you know it was in my power to say you've done this you've said this you you did this I could have laid out I could have laid out the whole list of all the things wrong but by God I'll just say this by God's grace God gave me vows of Mercies and that's the scripture we're going to get to a little bit the Bible said God is ready to forgive that could have been a spot where the bank where I was ready to pour out wrath I could have been oh I've been waiting for this this person's not off done me wrong I'm ready to really give them the business right I really tell them how they're they're not much of a message believer how can they be born again I could have poured out all these things but God is opposite God is I'm I was I was just ready to forgive you God God is not taking the attitude well I'm just ready to pour out punishments on brother so and so or sister so God is actually he's ready to give Mercy I know you're going to fall short Jesse I know you're gonna but here I'm ready to show you Mercy he's ready he's got it he's got it all prepared he's got forgiveness all prepared for us amen praise God Amen he's ready to do it praise God that's the kind of love we need to follow after praise God that's the kind of love and mercy we need to repeat and that was just a good example of how I did it from my heart I thought all these great years you know all these great times like brother man I said this little fella doesn't mean that it was hard to say that but then the word of God I was preached was right what I needed praise God I always find it that's how it happens and so let's remember that let's ask God for Mercy let's have mercy on others who may not deserve it but let's remember we don't deserve it all the time either okay now uh I'm now I'm going to focus on this this next verse here uh verse 13 for bearing so in other words when we show Mercy we're actually holding people up now think about that think about that I could have text that gentleman back that brother and I could have tore him to shreds and in his mind he could have fought he could have fallen and said look look at my look at my life look at my testimony but instead of that Mercy will help hold people up in their faith keep standing you're a real believer keep saying you're a real child of God hallelujah see when you show Mercy you actually sustain other people you actually keep them encouraged you keep them fighting the good fight of Faith Hallelujah see hold people up don't tear people down hold people up now we want to tear the devil down every chance we get we want to tear Satan down and Satan we want to tear his kingdom now and every chance we get Hallelujah but we want to hold one another up the entire time we want to forebear each other we want to forgive them which means grant them a pardon I pardon you brother sister I pardon you I'm not going to hold this against you If any man has a core or a blame or a complaint against any even as Christ so how do we forgive even as Christ forgave so also do ye at church that's what I was you know you know are we always ready to forgive you know when we go to God in prayer and we and I'll say like this church you know for the thousands time this year I've come back to God asking for forgiveness right and each time he's ready to offer forgiveness to me I'm ready to forgive I'm coming back I'm ready to forgive you yes you're forgiven I will I will not impute that to you I'm quick I'm going to quickly Grant you forgiveness this is what Paul says and I believe this is applicable for 2023 praise God for thou Lord aren't good see and ready to forgive and plenteous and mercy unto all of them that call upon me praise God so this is the God we serve we serve a god who's a good God he's ready to forgive the Bible said he's slow to anger you know so think about you know the times God's poured out his anger on people and he swallowed up Dora or Cora and Nathan right he swallowed them up in the earth and he had aching you know uh stoned and everything like that and burned with fire got in that in each of those cases God was slow to anger it was a slow process right and these people God had to pour out of judgment on them but we are the children of God hallelujah we're not an Aiken we're not a a Dothan or we're not a core a praise God we make mistakes but we're not fighting against this message we're fighting for this message amen and so if God was so to anger with them that transgressed the word of God how much more is God going to be merciful to us and ready to forgive us who are fighting for the truth praise God amen God has plenty of Mercy for this church because we're calling upon the name of Jesus Christ amen so let's be let's in our hearts let's be ready to forgive as Christ is ready to forgive Hallelujah in church this is the Christian walk right this is the Christian life because now we're into we're into how we can set our affection on heaven and how we can live a Christian Life we can crucify these Temptations and then this is how we model the Christian Life to others we can forgive them and then this other verse remember Jesus prayed on the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do they parted his raiment and cast his Lots so like my example with my friend in the text he didn't even know what he was doing he didn't even know he had a critical demon Spirit on it think about that Church do we always know when we have evil spirits on us like just in our minds do we always know like if we're if we're coveting after something that we don't have do we always know I've got an evil spirit on me don't always know this brother didn't know for six weeks till the Lord woke him up think about that so somebody could have a complex for a long time and not really no not really realize I'm in a bad spot with God now my prayer is Lord show me my complexes as soon as possible praise God show me if I got a wrong thought on something help me to have helped me to have a thought that that glorifies you help me to be loving to each and every person praise God but Jesus prayed father they don't know what they're doing they parted his raiment and cast lots on the cross suffering on the cross and he cries father forgive them they don't know what they do it's a it's a beautiful testimony even as Christ said father forgive them we should say father forgive those who sin against me because none of us have been the Bible says none of us have suffered unto death yet none of us have suffered such persecution where we've had to shed blood as far as I know we might have different testimonies but we never had to fight or you know put our lives on the line to be a Christian as far as I know maybe some of us have I know I haven't personally but again let's look at how Christ forgives God's ready to forgive he's quick to forgive he's slow to anger and then he forgives people because he realizes they don't know what they're doing they have a they have a complex they have a mind battle and they don't even understand the Mind battle that they're going through so Lord forgive them Church like brother Adam says he said if any of us want to see anybody burning hell he said we've got to go back to the Altar and make sure we're saved what a statement what a statement if we want to see any of these people even all the people that speak against me I don't want to see them I don't want to see them go to hell and if I did something's wrong with me right I got an awful complex yes we have to correct people yes the Bible said then the sin rebuked before all Jesus rebuked the Pharisees in front of I mean crowds and he preached whole sermons rebuking the Pharisees but he you know he was trying to offer Grace he was trying to preach the truth so they could be saved he was sent to his own and his own received him not praise God again another verse this is the parable Jesus told about the the king or the ruler who forgave the man this amazing debt this huge debt and the man fell down and said have patience with me and I'll pay thee all then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt so church I want to just say this too you know even in our families and our marriages and our friendships you know there's going to be times where we can't we can't uh we can't get things right right away like we're still learning how to show the love of Christ in certain areas of our life and we gotta and sometimes we have to say Lord and to one another to have patience with me I'm trying to grow in this area of my life like I'm trying to grow as a better husband I'm trying to grow better or to be a better father a better pastor right and so each one of us we're all we're not what we want to be praise God but thank God we're not what we're used to be amen Hallelujah and so here's an example of how God God is patient even though this man the man says have patience I'll pay it all the in the parable the king knows he he's not gonna be able to pay this off this is millions of dollars of debt or however many he wasn't but the desire but God recognized the man's desire amen his desires show patience with me until I can get this right so I want to encourage us let's show let's show patience with one with one another until we can get it right praise God Hallelujah I like that that's a good dog I just had that about this morning so what the Lord do the Lord said I forgive you he had compassion look at that move with compassion a church that's what we need we need to we need to wait until God moves us with compassion we need to feel we need to feel people's struggles praise God I love this how God shows how God is moved with compassion when we see people begging for mercy when we see people asking for help that should move us to compassion in other words we we got to be able to be moved out of a hard-hearted mindset and be moved to a mindset of compassion for others that's beautiful have patience with me I guess that meant a lot to me you know because as my wife and I you know in our marriage there's there's errors I need to grow and like communication and so you know with my wife I've asked her for patience many times and my my wife always gives it praise God when I look at my life and I can see I need I need her to have patience with me I'm sure she would say the same there's areas I need to have patience with her because we we both fall short of God's glory I just love this how God is able to say I I like their heart their heart is right you know they want to make this right eventually and God is moved with compassion because they want to make it right they can't make it right right away but in time they can make it right and so I'll forgive them because of that amen oh that's a beautiful dog praise God so these are the specifics on we need to mortify these things in our life so in other words we need to we could if we have corals or disagreements or complaints about people we can either hold on to them or we can forgive them we can crucify that desire right and instead of tearing people down we can build them up forgive them and not hold blame against them and not complain against them but we can forgive them like Christ forgives us amen oh it's a beautiful chapter this is real meat and potatoes right here praise God because how many of you like would like to go home and or go home or go to church or go anywhere how many you know wherever you go don't you want to experience these type of relationships now how many you you don't have to raise your hand but how many don't have this kind of relationship in your natural family I mean you don't have to raise your hand but in other words you got family members they won't forgive you they have quarrels against you they blame you for things right I mean all of us can look at our lives and we can see relationships that are broken broken relationships because people are not putting on the love of Christ that's why that's why I asked that question is this even applicable for today of course if there's ever a time it was applicable it's today praise God because the love because of the sin shall abound iniquity shall bow the love of many shall acts called amen most people don't have relationships like this where people instead of tearing you down they'll actually Build You Up like sometimes I get comments on my YouTube videos and all's is criticism and so I'll say well did you like anything about it at all was there anything good about any of those videos anything good in that video you know I spent you know 25 hours on that video was there anything good in that at all what am I trying to say I'm just trying to say like can you hold me up a little bit can you try to sustain me a little bit and of course I don't I don't let those things so you know I don't let those things drag me down but the the Christian should try to build each other up and hold you up right and keep you standing for Christ amen that's a real creation praise God to keep you in the faith amen you know not long ago I had a brother from overseas I think it was New Zealand I can't remember which one he was really asking me about when should we uh when should we put people out from under the blood and he's like we should put him out even for little things I'm like brother I said you start doing that you're going to have a real small Church pretty soon you're going to put everybody out and pretty soon you're going to get put out and he ought to get put out for putting all the other people out I said brother I said well he said well then how do you apply this brother random said this and that I said look how brother Branham did it he rarely did it there's one place in the message brother Brown said he said brother Neville and I are going to go around this week and we're going to go to from house to house and make sure there's no disagreements with anybody in the church I don't know if he did it we don't he doesn't give us any updates on and I said brother he said well then when do we do it brother Jesse I said look at look look look in the Bible when did they put people out from other blood in the Bible and the Bible said they only did it when this young man was sleeping with his stepmother and everybody everybody was fine with it that was the only time he told them to put him out for the destruction of the flesh that their Spirit might be saved I said let's apply it like that I said any other questions he said no that's okay we can be done with that now see so it was like it was a Zeal to to yell at you know the Zeal like let's get the Akins out let's is true but friends we all got some Aiken in our in our members right and if we want to we if we want to come up with quarrels amongst each other we could we can pull some stuff back from years ago I could pull things from years ago you could probably read we could all pull uh quarrels against one another from years ago but it's better to forgive Hallelujah it's better to live a life of forgiveness being ready to forgive being ready to Pardon and to hold people up praise God oh if somebody did Did You Wrong years ago and you can't get over it yes then it's time to go to them just like the Bible said go one on one we got to do that but I just thought that was you know a good application of this that Christ so freely forgives us every day think about that every day seven Seventy Times Seven 490. you should you should forgive your brother 490 times in one day and I'm so ready to forgive it I forgive you I forgive you we should have that same mind let the mind of Christ be in you praise God this is Holy Ghost preaching amen praise God so see God loves a heart that says God God loves a heart that says you know I can't I just can't get the victory right now but I want to change I want to be different I want to be a better husband I want to be a better wife I want to be a better brother in Christ have patience with me and the church said God loves that heart just outpatient with me so I'm going to get there by God's grace I'm going to get there and above all this above all this scriptures we just read 12 and 13 above all this putting on all this kindness and long suffering above all this he said put on charity because it's the bond of perfectness in other words love is the glue that keeps our church together love is the glue that keeps a marriage together love is the glue that keeps a brother friendship together or sisters Fellowship together love is the glue the the Greek word actually means a ligament because ligaments hold the bones together so he says above all this have love in other words above all this make sure the different parts of the body have ligaments connected make sure the ligaments aren't torn church I in the playing sports I've had many a torn ligament in my ankle there are times I go up to block somebody's shot brother amen ah and I land on somebody's foot I'll be on crutches for two weeks that happened like four or five times in middle school and a couple times in high school here I am I'm this athlete I'm like going to class because of ligaments torn ligaments torn ligaments it's separated you know it it caused the bones not to work the right way am I am I what I could probably show you this day I got this one huge ankle this ankle is way much bigger than the other one because of of torn ligaments that was swollen up how many ever swollen an ankle before couple okay not everybody good for you praise God good for you don't envy me it's no fun but Paul's saying love is like a ligament that connects bones helps them to stay connected and move the joints to stay connected it's the it's the glue of perfectness it's the glue of Harmony it keeps uh it keeps the church unified praise God when we have love one for another you got to forgive we got to have long suffering we want to be kind merciful humble praise God and above all this love will keep the body of Christ together Hallelujah I'll just show you a few pictures okay is everybody ready for somebody they're not too graphic okay there's a knee that there's a knee that the ligaments are torn and I can't can you see the definition and now that's swollen up now Cam and Simon had that or Cam and Sam had that they tore some ligaments in their knees in high school now this is what happened to me I'd fall down on somebody's ankle and you tear ligaments in there in the in the ankle area that's the ankle okay it's not just a visual Paul is saying above all have this love have have the ligaments connected to one another now Church how many Brews think about this how many Brews churches are there out there because the ligaments are torn the love is torn between a brother and a sister or a family another family how many bruised bodies are out there in the churches spiritually speaking right there's not Harmony the the body doesn't work like it should there's there's pain there there's hurt they're swollen they're swollen pry right Pride swells up Pride puffs up there's a lot of churches that are like this a lot of Pride and a lot of arrogancy and anger swollen up but God wants us to be the right kind of a joint God wants us to be a body that's free from pain free from anger free from bitterness and Malice and Wrath God doesn't want to spread in our ankles when we come to church so make sure you step off the platform the right way brother I will my God so see love keeps us connected and moving forward together in harmony praise God just like the Bible said I was writing on that verse earlier the Bible said if they don't discern the body of Christ then many are weak and sickly among you okay so many people are weak many body many Christian bodies are weak and sickly and have swelling because they don't judge each other the right way right when we judge each other you should say you know what this sister sin against me I'm going to give her mercy because Jesus gave me mercy now you've judged the right way I'm gonna I'm gonna build this brother up instead of tearing this brother down I'm gonna build him up praise God and we're going to have a healthy church amen Hallelujah we're gonna have a healthy family praise God let me bring it down to your house because we're able to forgive we're able to be patient with one another we're able to have long suffering and know God's gonna work this out God God's ready to forgive me I'm ready to forgive people in my family praise God I'm ready to forgive them I'm not going to hold a grudge against them are there pain yes of course there's going to be emotional pain but we don't have to hold that against them praise God yes we have to guard ourselves yes we never want to be abused yes those are all true but at some point we have to forgive people praise God we have to be ready to say since Jesus forgave me I will forgive them I'm not gonna let this hinder my walk with the Lord I'm not going to be a uh this disfigured part of the body of Christ I'm going to be a healthy part of the body of Christ Hallelujah now here I just look at verse 15 here so put on charity so be connected to one another with God's love and let the peace of God rule your heart to which also you're called in one body that's why I preached last Sunday on uh it's as though you never did in the first place and the Bible says we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ I'm not fighting against God right God's fighting for me Hallelujah God's fighting for you praise God I'm not at war with God hallelujah I'm at war with the devil praise God Hallelujah I have peace with God Amen see he said let the peace of God rule your hearts to which you're called one body and be thankful so in these two verses we have these three attributes love peace and thankfulness praise God let that be the testimony of Our Lives Church let us Walk In Love let us let the peace of God rule our hearts and let us be thankful in every situation amen this is Christian Living this will help us overcome the previous chapters enticing words right all those enticing words about legalism and and sensual things and and mysticism and talking to spirits and all these things this kind of life will help us overcome every Temptation amen loving one another having peace with God being thankful in every situation praise God Paul is giving us the keys to Victory praise God amen now this this verse reminded me of this so I pulled that one up there the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so both Paul wrote both of these right so we understand the kingdom of God is spiritual victories in our souls and in our minds praise God it's in living out every day what what Christ died for amen it's living out every day with God's anointing on us praise God amen this is the kingdom of God well brother Jesse I want the kingdom of God well then live righteous have peace and have joy praise God and I say like this I can't give it to you you got to put it on Amen go put it on in the morning or afternoon or whenever you get a chance to put it on put on the blessings of God put on the anointing it's our choice praise God you you and I set our affections on one finger or another we got to look at the word of God and we've got to set our affections on things above we're going to set our affections on the kingdom of God and when we do we have charity we have peace with God we're thankful praise God and we live a righteous life it's the kingdom of God living in US amen that's God's kingdom praise God now let me show you this maybe I can maybe I can show this here I want you to show you know I don't know if I mentioned this one or not but um you know Paul I want to just balance this out again with Miracles you know I love we love when God does Miracles we're all longing for miracles but this thought came to me a while ago let me do the view here I wanted to show you I didn't have time to put it on here so let's this is this is a quote I want to show you look at all the times Paul mentioned miracles to local churches and I gotta I have to fix this so just be patient with me I gotta fix the font size okay so when Paul was writing about Christians and their daily lives look over here on the side here Paul here's Paul's letters Paul's first letter is Romans okay and then his last letter is Philemon so from Romans to Philemon how many times did Paul write to the Saints about miracles it's right here huh uh who can have three plus one Victoria four Skipper two clap now these are the letters to the individual churches in the cities how many times did Paul mention Miracles four times he didn't mention any miracles to the Ephesians Philippians Colossians as well now the church in thessalonica even Timothy the preacher right before he died a church we all love Miracles we all love tongues interpretation prophecy but what did Paul say one day all those things are going to be fulfilled to put away and all it's going to be left is Christ amen hallelujah a glorified body amen I just thought I'd you know the reason I'm bringing this up is because look at this chapter Paul says he writes this colossian church he says crucify mortify these these lusts and he said put on the anointing of God he didn't say put on uh put on Divine Healing although we believe that he said put on these these attributes of a Christian put on the mindset of a Christian and show the love show the love of Christ the thankfulness of Christ amen so the charity of Christ amen let it rule your heart praise God I want to show you that now the three times of course he's talking about the gifts of Miracles and not all work miracles and then Galatians he talks about miracles he says how do you work miracles by legalism or by the hearing of faith of course the hearing of faith I just thought I'd share that with you I wanted to preach on that but I guess I'll just make today that day I preached on it I just want to show that you know that look how Paul emphasizes we've I've preached out through Galatians Ephesians Philippians now I'm in my fourth letter of Paul and look at the emphasis is on mortifying the the sinful nature and being Anointed with the Holy Spirit in your daily life amen putting on these things put on charity put on peace put on thankfulness amen oh I feel like dancing it's victory I know that's a good song buddy Hallelujah that's right that's that's the kingdom of God hallelujah now Church do I believe we're waiting for miracles yes but what do we want our testimony to be when our testimony be complaining until we get the miracle or do we want our testimony to have the joy of God the peace of God until that Miracle comes amen you you know what you know what the choices you know I know what the answer is we want the right testimony praise God now my wife would just tell me I was this morning she was listening to Shane and Shane and we're like wow how do they get all these great songs and this might help Austin maokai with their musician gifts and everything like that I guess Lydia Acacia cares too all those who want to play piano or all those who want to play but I guess Shane and Shane was being interviewed and they said how do you keep coming up with these songs and he quoted Colossians 3 16. he said let the word of God dwell on you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord we we saw Phil last year and the last question this little girl she had her hand up the whole time and finally this guy's like let's let's let her ask a question she's waited this whole time and she said Mr Whitcomb how do you how do you how should I write songs and I was I was you know we were expecting some you know some mystical answer like praying fast or uh you know some mystical answer he said just memorize the Bible I thought Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm gonna write songs I wouldn't do this what should I do what's the what's the secret put the word of God in your mind ah feed on God's word all day praise God Hallelujah I want to do something for God put God's word in your mind you'll do something for God Hallelujah where you want to do it it's in your family in your home in your church you want to do it so write those all around you praise God so I thought it was it was fitting that my wife shared that scripture I said I'm just preaching on that scripture this morning huh it's very fitting you shared that so maybe our musicians knew that or maybe I needed it amen maybe we all need it by God's grace let the word of God dwell now that dwell means let it influence you for good okay now think about that you know since Simon's sermon on Wednesday have I let the word of God influence me more or the world influenced me more the word of God right and each one of us have that choice from service to service from Sunday to Wednesday or Sunday to Sunday after however we got a choice which one are we going to let influence us are we gonna let the word of God influence all throughout the week or we're gonna let the cares of this world influence us now look and Josh here's here's the real advice this is the real command of the Holy Spirit don't just do a little bit of the word but do it abundantly I'm gonna say that again as Holy Ghost failed message Believers praise God if we wanted to be influenced for God we've got to listen abundantly to the word and sing abundantly praise God a little bit of feeding on the word of God is not going to help us the way we need to be helped we need to do it abundantly praise God unless we want a body full of source and a body full of swelling and a broken body unless we want broken families or we want broken marriages or broken relationships with with children and parents we know I'm broken and bruised relationships we want loving relationships praise God and this is what does it we let the word of God influence us abundantly in all wisdom or all Supreme intelligence Hallelujah who had more intelligence those Pharisees or Peter Peter right because Peter said Silver and Gold Have I not such as I have I give it unto you look at that that's that's Supreme intelligence right there I'm trusting in the healing powers of Christ amen that's Supreme intelligence praise God well I've got all these proofs you know the Bible's in Accra I got all these proofs against brother Branham but real Supreme intelligence will point us back to the word of God it'll show us what's the truth about the matter praise God so if we want to have the kingdom of God yeah if we want to have the kingdom of God how many want peace to rule your life I don't want War I don't want spiritual Wars to rule my life I want the peace of God to rule my life well if that's to happen we got to have a great influence abundant influence from the word of God and as we do this we'll teach we know teach means instruct I've been over that many times of any serpents if we have this wisdom we'll teach and we'll admonish which means to warn and is strongly encouraged so it can go either way one another in Psalms which is striking chords and hymns which is praising and spiritual songs also also means praising God singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord praise God in other words we'll encourage one another by singing song specials or sending somebody hey have you heard this new song this song's a blessing right or hey this scripture this scripture is a real blessing this is a real help to us praise God like Simon he preached that one scripture that's a real help to me I was from uh Isaiah 31. and then I looked up other verses about how God will preserve my life yeah I'm going to read that so Simon preached one and I'm going to read it it might help you Proverbs 2 verse 8 this really helped me on I was like I'm just sitting there like crying on Wednesday and I'm like Lord You're so gracious it's like man I I've read that verse before but it never struck me like it did Wednesday night that's what I love about God he brings things out new and old praise God verse 8 he that keepeth the pass of judgment I'm sorry he keepeth the passive judgment and preserves the way of his Saints God is preserving my life you and I we're walking on a certain way we're walking on the way of Holiness amen and God said as we make the right decisions God is going to preserve us on this way praise God that means the storms of life the life like those awful winds we had yesterday praise God almost blew my van off the road those those wins The Winds of every Doctrine will not be able to blow us off the path God's going to keep us now God's going to let us go through some storms he's going to let the storms come but he's going to show us that he's going to keep us on the path amen nothing will be able to overcome us praise God because we've got the Overcomer inside of us amen ah greater see that's in me then he that's in the world praise God thank God Amen oh it's a beautiful promise the Lord gives us beautiful promises here Glory and then he says so I just want to say that again you know and I say I can do better with that I can do better with that you know when I find a scripture a song I need to share with everybody since I have everybody on a text message I need to do better than that so pray for have patience with me can I can I use that verse there I would like to encourage everybody more and I'll tell you what my wife does a good job every Saturday she listens to a sermon for brother and she'll almost every Saturday she'll text me a quote I'm like that's a good quote all right it's just right on timer ooh that's a good one I'm like that's inspired huh Hallelujah that's what it reminds me of that we're supposed to abundantly feed on the things of God and then encourage strengthen one another through songs Praises testimonies like today that's a real encouragement amen Hallelujah and then he says whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus or do all on this account of Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him so all words and deeds should be done in Thanksgiving so it seems like the Colossians are not like our church we're not fighting physical persecution it was spiritual battles they were fighting and Paul says the key to that is crucify the deeds and the cravings and anything that would come crucify that and put on the Holy Spirit praise God put on the anointing of God and again we see this the second time repeating this chapter be thankful in every trial say Lord I Thank you for this trial I'm going to come out like gold on the other side praise God but help us also recognize Lord I've got some dross in my life I definitely got some draws in my members now I think I should hear some amens on that I got drops I got a sinful nature in my members praise God I understand Lord you've got to take me through trials you've got to allow trials to bring me through this so that on the other end I'll have less dross and I'll have gold praise God Hallelujah the character of Christ amen the nature of Christ like that one guy that one guy I think Naomi and Beecher saw the video this guy this preacher online and now he's a divorce preacher he's got two kids that don't even serve God he calls me out he makes this video about me and he says I tried to show brother Jesse the love of God by sending a text two texts is okay to show God's love but how about show me some love and come to me privately before you make an hour-long video blasting me how about you share your concerns with me before you post the video live the love of God we're talking about the love of God Amen and I don't put any word I don't put any weight on what he says because I cannot be cursed because I'm already blessed and his accusations are false but it just again an example of someone saying I had love I sent them two texts well love is more than just sending a text love can be in the text no doubt about that but when you really love somebody you care about them like before I before I preach anything on Billy Paul and Joseph I know I don't know if you know this but I sent them a a 20 minute video just to them privately I said I'm trying to do this privately before I don't want to go public but I might have to and they just wrote back and I said well then I'm going to take it public then because they're influencing millions of people and there's got to be a voice against it praise God brother Brandon spoke against preachers all the time all the time but see that to me showed the love of God first I sent them copies of my books I said I I did it privately first okay and think about Paul think about all the people call Paul called out in these letters that got read publicly uh-huh praise God I don't know how I don't know how I got there anyways I'm not sure how I got there by God's grace it's kind of interesting how that happens whatever you do in word or D do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him Thanksgiving is what we need praise God in the midst of our trials let's be thankful now here we get into the next section this this is the final section Christianity in the home it deals with husbands wives children and servants in the home okay now how many wish you had servants don't raise your hands I told my wife that years ago I'm like well wish we could just like hire somebody you know just to come work for us from like you know six to ten every night you know they could do all the dishes fold all the clothes and sweep the floors and so I wish I wish we had employees but I can't afford that right now and yes I'm gonna train my children into chores they do a lot of chores they do a lot of chores especially as I get older they do a lot of chores you guys are making the Casey makes breakfast every day for nine people where's she at she stepped out probably working but this was the Christian Home in Paul's day he had husbands wives children and service now this is another thought I'm going to drop on and drop it on you like I preached before God never called Paul to and and the the servant system that wasn't his calling in life Paul never said go protest the Roman government and try to end servanthood anybody ever think about that but what did Paul say Paul said change it from the inside out he said servants love your Masters like you love Christ now would that eventually end yes the servant would eventually the servant system would eventually end but does it stumble anybody that God allowed a servanthood a type of slavery is that somebody Buddy when he allowed Israel to be slaves in Egypt for almost 440 years what was it it was for a testimony God does not God did not ordain it but God allowed it look at look at what we've got a lot look at all the violence that God allows the wars look at it let's go on look God allows he allows abortion he allows these things he doesn't support it but he allows it because he has to allow this is a drama right it's a theater everybody's up on the stage and God's got allow people to make certain decisions right but as we know the Bible said prayer can change things amen Hallelujah God wants us to see God wants to see us intercede with prayer God wants to see us to run to someone and try to convict them uh to forgive and not to be harsh praise God God wants us to play the part of a Christian amen hallelujah he wants us to play The Godly part of the story amen so I just thought I'd share that with you by God's grace now did God Amen did God anoint men to end slavery yes or some of our early forefathers they were I preached on that last summer God anointed them to start the the process of slowly changing until we get an Abraham Lincoln amen hallelujah praise God Amen or in Great Britain uh William Wilberforce helped end slavery in England God anoints men and women for such a time as that praise God and you got to be patient you got to trust God am I for slavery of course not is anybody for slavery that's a real Christian of course not but we have to live a Christian Life in the conditions that God allows all right so wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as it is fit as it's your duty in the Lord now this word I just thought I'd share this it's interesting sisters that it's a military term so I'm sure her sisters would like a drill sergeant for a husband right is that is that what the Bible's saying but that I'm joking terminology though that Paul uses submit like a soldier would submit to his drill sergeant and the church said it's the word who ought also I can't see so it just means to put in subjection to obey to submit one's control it's a military term meaning to arrange in a military fashion under the command of a leader so you've all seen the videos right soldiers line up everybody goes right to their position no questions does anybody stop and question the drill sergeant to the general they're just funny I think it like shows I saw about you know drill sergeants and things now in non-mare in non-military use so this word was used for military but also not military it just means a voluntary attitude to give in other words I'll choose okay you can have your way and uh you can have responsibility you can carry that burden I'll I'll take your way so it's a voluntary giving in okay and what's interesting is you know Paul addresses wives here first in the Colossians book but in Ephesians he addresses husbands first I don't know if our Colossians sisters need it I don't know I don't know if there's any order to that or not we all need God's grace amen I just thought I'd share that it um to see the voluntary attitude so our sisters need to have that now as it's fitting the Lord now as if it's against the word you don't have to do that and it's to your own husband not somebody else's husband right I'm diver now then you get you know Brothers not in our church I haven't seen it actually in our church but I've seen it in Lima and other churches I went to where brothers would try to other married men would try to influence younger married couples and it's like whatever that brother said and this couple then that sister would say well the brother said that and the husband's like well I didn't say that and it was just it was a area of Christian Liberty you'd be surprised and church let me say like this even as a pastor as long as I preach something from the word yes you should obey that but if it's something that I do in my life that's my Christian Liberty you and your husband and wife don't have to do what I do that's where Colts come from I've been studying Cults lately because I've been studying Jim Jones they're saying uh these accusers are saying brother Branham has the association with Jim Jones he has one quote with Jim Jones Jim Jones went to one of Brothers meetings a couple of them but then he fell away he he was a wicked homosexual Wicked Man abusive man wicked wicked man if I've been studying Colts again lately and that's one of the things of the cold the leader gets full control over people's lives but the Bible says we're not under bondage we're free in Christ Jesus the Bible said the preacher is just an example I'm just an example you're not you don't have to model everything I do off of my life I'm trying to model my life after Christ amen I don't want to knock you off again I knocked you off a few weeks ago so I just want to make sure I bring that balance you know um and the reason I say that is because of social media and other things you know it's been known that social media often makes people jealous of other people or discontented so I think in this day and age we got to remind our sisters just just be concerned with you and your husband you know and sisters if you're discontented with your husband pray for him praise God pray for him and also submit to him as it is fit in the Lord right because that's one of the things of course that all all women not just the women in Colossians in colossae but all women uh got to learn to submit to their own husbands all right as the scripture says and so just so you know I'm not telling Brothers to be a drill sergeants don't say bro Jesse said that I didn't say that I said a sister needs a voluntary attitude okay because remember whatever you reap that's what you're going to sow if you sow no patience and if you sow anger and if you sow strictness that's what you're gonna that's what you're gonna you're gonna reap that right Brothers I'm now turn for the brothers husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them now this is the word love this word love is the agapo it's not filio filo is like the kiss kind of love or just like friendship kind of love agapo is divine love it's love it's God's love there's my hour it's God's love and so he says husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them so at least in the Church of colossi maybe some of the men were struggling with bitterness against their wives like we said like we said maybe some of the joints had some swelling in them right maybe they didn't have a lot of uh maybe uh the brothers weren't loving their wives like they ought to and this is not sexual love this is a husbands have a uh just a sexual attraction this is divine love this is Selfless Love this is agape love this is the same love where he said you're the Beloved Church of God Amen this is the same beloved word it's Agape you're the Agape bride you're the Agape church so he says husbands have agape love towards your wives in other words again like we said this is the love that doesn't look on conditions well you owe me this you did that so I'm harming you back this is the love that shows Mercy amen praise God this is the mercy love the Divine love and so husbands are here admonish let's not be bitter against our wives maybe a wife doesn't do exactly what we want or a wife doesn't do exactly when we want it to be done we as brothers we're told not to be bitter against them we're told to be patient with them we're told to have long suffering with them praise God and brothers if you're honest you know your wife have to have long suffering with you too right and the brother said and I just thought this was a beautiful picture you know in first Samuel one I'm going to just read that there I was just praying here and I was like oh that's right that's what elkana said to Hannah um the Bible said elkana loved Hannah and I just thought this was a look at just what a beautiful picture he gave her the best food I didn't get I think two or three wives of course we know that's not a good system polygamy is an awful system cause a lot of many many many many trials many troubles but verse 5 but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion so he gave Hannah out of his numerous wives there I'm sorry yeah two wives yeah heniel I'm sorry Penn y the apanaya and Hannah but he gave Hannah the worthy portion of the food for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb so I think this is a good example here of how husbands are to love their wives now Brothers you only got one wife so you can give your wife a greater portion a lot easier okay you don't have to worry about dividing up now if you got eight kids now you gotta you gotta have a portion for your kids you gotta get a portion for your wife but I don't work in the kitchen too much so I can only do that when I go out to eat but you understand you had two wives but he said I love Hannah Morris I'm giving her I'm giving her more or a greater portion now but look at this here even though he loved her with such a great love Hannah was still dissatisfied in life because she wanted a child okay I just thought this was a beautiful thought here uh verse 8 and then elkana her husband said to her Hannah why weepest thou and why Edith thou not and why is thy heart grief am I not better to thee than ten Sons I say here's a man that loved his wife I hope my wife can say that that I loved her really well praise God I I hope so I know other people tell me I do I don't know that I do but other people say brother Jess you do a good job loving your family you do a good job your wife and I said well I'm trying by God's grace I'm not perfect by any means but how many brothers want to be like elkana praise God I want to love my wife in such a way that it's like uh just extra portions of love now of course here she was not upset with him but she wanted a child from God so I just love this how Hannah she had a purpose in her heart you know in other words Church you know we'll have we'll have lots of good things in our lives but if something seems unfulfilled then God's gonna drive us to desire that I mean she he basically said you don't have to desire any children I'm better you than 10 Sons that's a pretty good man right there pretty good man I hope you wear a man like that all my girls marry men like that better than 10 Sons huh I just want you to see that you know even though she had her needs met in that area she still had a purpose in her life that needed to be fulfilled and so desperation drove her to seek God for this praise God and as she saw God God heard her prayer and In God's Time and season that was answered amen what I'm saying is that some areas of our life can be really good but there are certain areas that may seem uncomfortable or may seem unfulfilled keep trusting God keep keep seeking God God will answer amen Hallelujah and brothers that's Ultra I guess the next time I preach a marriage banquility I'm going to call it the elkana banquet I'm gonna say Brothers here's here's ways you can love your wife better than ten Sons so I got to figure out what does Malachi do to help out my wife that'd be one son okay so I know he does the granola he makes granola right on Saturday nights and so I could start calculating what does maokai do here all right now 10 of those I got to do better than that well I've got a I've got a job I really need to study some scripture on elkana how did he do this ten Sons obviously enough late making 10 batches of granola next Saturday night I actually got to make 11 because it's better than 10. it's a lot of love but I just thought you know I'd share that you know here a woman is to submit voluntarily just give in her will and say okay and the man is instructed love show love don't be bitter show love so let's let's get something from that today praise God let's get some today that we can take home with us amen Hallelujah I think that's beautiful you know what's interesting too is that go to John 21 I think I'll just share this too the difference between agapo and Philly Love John 21. John chapter 21. it's just interesting the use of these words there is a difference between agape and filio this is after the resurrection of course verse 15. John 21 15. so when they had dying Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas Agape thou me more than these and he said to him yea Lord thou knowest that I filio d he saith unto him feed my Lambs so Peter is Fresh Off denying Christ and Jesus saying do you have agape love for me and he says he said Lord I have filio love for you in other words he's ashamed he doesn't feel like he's right with God he can't really Express like Lord I love you with all my Oh my he feels like he's been defeated right Jesus is using this word you Agape me Divine love you got Divine love Peter you just denied me three times you have Divine love you don't even have the you don't have the strength to answer say I I have a God now he's going to get on the day of Pentecost amen hallelujah praise God Amen he's going to get eventually but here Jesus says do you have agape love Peter says Lord you know I got feeling in other words he's saying you know I love you but he can't admit he's basically admitting I'm not where I need to be and then he asked him again he said to him second time Simon son of Jonas Agape thou me he said to him feed my sheep now verse 17 Jesus changes it he said he saith unto him the third time Simon Senator Jonas filio thou me Jesus changes it you can look in the Greek so he he he talks to Peter to try to show him you're not where you need to be right he said you have agape love he's showing him he's showing Peter you need more sanctification praise God you don't have this Divine love yet so Jesus says Agape Agape now he says do you have you have a lesser love for me and he says now he's greed now he's grief the Lord knows see the Lord knows our hearts Church and church let me say like this we don't have to hide anything from God God knows right where we're at so see Peter was still in a spot where he wasn't feeling right with God and so Jesus asked him this three times to let him know see do you have Agape Agape no do you have filio love for me because Jesus knew he didn't have agape love yet but he was going to get it praise God because before he left about five or six days later he said go ye up and tarry there in Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Ghost the promise of the father and you'll be in due with power from on high amen you'll be in due with Agape from on high praise God to me this shows the love of Christ do you have Agape of course Lord you know I don't disgrise me I don't have it he said well just make sure you feed my people so see now here's another thought too in feeding and serving God's people God will give you the love you desire and the church said well I wish I was more loving I wish I could experience that kind of love just stay with God's people you're going to get it amen praise God Agape do you have a Divine love for me Lord I've got filio love he says well Peter do you have feel that love for me yes Lord you know I do you know he said then feed my sheep praise God let me say like this to you parents keep feeding your children naturally and spiritually praise God keep feeding the Sheep of God that shows how much you love Christ sometimes you might give them organic pizza too you might you might do that too you might take them out to Chipotle every now and then too the point is God wants us to have agape love Divine love praise God I just want you to see this Akana had this amazing love for his wife that's so beautiful Jesus has this amazing love for his people but what needs help our our love is what needs help praise God and that's what the gospel produces the gospel produces a love that doesn't hold bitterness right that's that's what the gospel produces don't be get don't be getting in other words don't put on bitterness well I'm going to be bitter against you today boy or girl how many bitter honey I'm gonna be bitter against you today the gospel produces I'm going to put on love today God help us all praise God we all need it praise God I need it we all need them that's why we keep coming back to the house of God keep coming back to the house of God to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord now church sometimes now the Bible says you know wives submit but sometimes husbands submit you know that's hard for some preachers to hear especially if they're authoritarian or tyrants or whatever they call them but remember in Genesis 21 verse 12 Abraham went to God and said should I Cast Away Hagar and my son Ishmael and the Lord said hearken unto everything Sarah said so maybe when there's disagreements in marriages you know the the wife feels one way the husband feels another way the husband needs to take that request of the wife he needs to take it to God and see what God says about it how does he feel after that ultimately the choice is up to the man right because she's a submit in all things that's scriptural but I just want you to see again you know the Bible says submit and love but we need submission and love on both sides but the main need of the woman is to submit and the main need of the man is to show the love of God Divine love agape love so see wives are to love their husbands too they're supposed to have agape love for the husbands too right but it's the man that needs to express this this is the one he needs to have he needs to have his mind more on this more often than other times things have the love of God expressed towards his wife praise God make sure I sometimes write down last minute notes I think there was an example I was going to share let me think for a moment here about marriage uh it's not coming to me all right let me try to finish here I thought I'd read a few uh quotes here from Brother Branham my brother Brandon was talking about Oneness different differentiating from uh the message it's like Oneness is the denomination he says uh he says if this falls into your offices tape among you people that's Oneness he said don't misunderstand me now I just just because we disagree he said me and my wife disagree we sure do I tell her I love her and she says don't believe I do now this is an interesting quote brother Brown says his wife was going through menopause right and he said it was a very hard time for for women to go through menopause and in this same Series this is the question if you haven't listened to this in a while I listened to it a few weeks ago it's a beautiful series there's only four sermons and in this series you can hear there's some tension between brother Branham and his wife and so I think she's going through menopause and uh and so he talks about he just puts little things in here about this like here and look he's being honest you can hear him he said we disagree I tell our lover and she says I don't believe I do so then we certainly disagree but I'm telling you that we sure get along all right he says now notice maybe now look he's being honest with maybe I don't show enough signs to her that I do love her I'm out preaching and coming home and getting my fishing rod and go fishing see but down in my heart I love her I just have to stay away from her that's all I don't you know I've told my wife about this quote before I appreciate a different marriage banquets there's another quote in this series where brother Branham says he tries to sit down and spend time with his wife but she always gets up and she goes to wash wash clothes and all these things like that and so it just seems like she she didn't get a lot of time with him because he always want to travel and preach and then you know coming down coming out of those visions you know you got to relax your mind so that's why he want to go out and hunt and go on trips and things like that and so then the times when he'd want to spend time with her she would sometimes she would just go work anyway just go do the housework I gotta do my housework and he here's a 55 year old man 55 year old man okay so you know what what's the point of this the Bible says husbands love your wives so here are we what are we see in brother Brown is he does he admit he's trying to he's trying to love his wife more does he admit that yes I need to show more signs that I love my wife but because of the sacrifice of the gospel and trying to balance his own mental state and the strain of praying for people the physical strain the tone it would take on him it did cause some conflict in marriage but Church did they get along all right and now church then think about that let's say he's he's traveling all the time but what about a pastor and his wife they're they're together all the time right but even though their marriage might be loving they're still going to have some trials in life the point is everybody's going to have trials in life that's the point and this was a trial brother Branham had in his life by God's grace the love of God conquers right have we have patience with each other so if you if you ever said you know brother Jesse we're having marriage trouble well you're in a very good club by God's grace because every married couple has trouble sometimes right you know you don't have to say man I know you do every married couple they get bad like Satan wants what does Satan one do he wants to steal kill and destroy the home that's what he does you can see that's what he's trying to do now steal kill and destroying so let's let's be in an attitude where I can grow as a better husband I can grow as a more I can grow as a I can be a more loving husband I can be a more submissive wife just from those scriptures but again we can we can be both right we can be both when we're led by the Holy Spirit now here's this here's the beers the beautiful side to it but only the one time uh brother bam said his wife ever disrespected remember she slammed the door in his face when a brother random wouldn't spank Joseph and brother Graham said the Lord allowed her to get a tumor after that and brother Rand was praying for sister Meda and he's praying he's a he's I think he's in Arizona if I'm not mistaken he's praying Lord I miss them this morning I pray that you'll help them and bless them may we come back to this place again and now I said they're out there because that you sent me there on a vision and you fulfilled it and now I'm wanting to wait to see what you're going to tell me to do next I pray for be merciful to her and I said help me in the meeting down there and then I kept I said Lord don't let it be malignant the tumor that Mita had and let that doctor wait till that the first of the year to take it out I just hate to see her hurting I said Lord she didn't mean what she did that morning she didn't mean that I said Lord not one time has she ever said one word about me going into meetings staying months or whatever it was not one time has she ever opened her mouth about it she's always sent my clothes to the cleaners washed my shirts and had everything ready to go in the meeting then she wonders how she can serve God so sisters is it wrong to send clothes to the dry cleaners I take almost all my shares to the dry cleaners I don't want my wife or my children to have to iron them they would be iron a long time so isn't that interesting all she does is serve her husband and then she wonders God do I do anything for you well that's you are as you serve your husband that's what brother says you are serving God you women as you serve your husband you serve God of course see as you submit right that's the way the Bible says wives submit husbands love and now when they when then when I come in I'm all tired and worn out from the visions and every praying for the sick people coming from everywhere I'd have to go out somewhere on a fishing trip or a hunting trip why many women would have blowed up at that what'd she do she got my hunting clothes ready for me to go and let me go now look let me go I said Lord she didn't mean that I said she's had to be cut open three times on account of she she was cesarean and I said Lord I hate to see her have to do that again now look I just love this brother Ram is interceding for his wife she's got a tumor and I just love that brother Brandon brings out all the good things that his wife has done he didn't bring up any bitterness right he could have been better she slammed the door right in my face Lord now that would be awful right but at the same time you know husbands sin against their wives too if they're not loving they've sinned against their wives he could have been bitter but here the Holy Spirit allows him to manifest the love of God in prayer Lord remember she did this she'd done that she's even given her physical body over for cesarean C-sections she's never complained when I need to go get away Lord and then he said the voice said stand up now whatever you say that's the way it will be I just love how God gives brother Branham the spoken word to intercede for his life isn't that beautiful he has no bitterness in his heart but he stands there he says Lord thank you for all she's done and look his prayer this wasn't even his prayer his prayer was Lord just let the surgery be after the new year but then God does exceedingly abundantly amen above all we ask and think amen and not only gets rid of the surgery gets rid of the whole tumor praise God he says stand up whatever you say that it will be I wait just a minute I said before the doctor's hands will touch her the hand of God shall take the tumor away and it won't even be found and that's how it turned out so the man would be he'd be there in the service he said is that right honey and you hear a sister of me me to say Amen amen that's right just a good example of husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church let's stand to our feet by God's grace musicians can come I'll stop right there I'll get on the children maybe next time by God's grace Hallelujah how many want the peace of God to rule your heart today so many things were said in those verses that's what I tell you like with Paul's letters they are so concentrated there is so much in there like I could just preach on that one verse today about uh building people up just build people up don't tear people down I mean we could have spent the whole service just on that but see how God put so much in there so that we can live off this our entire lives I got a feeling sister Hua well Jesse's going to be trying to grow and love the rest of my adult life all right darling but also I think the rest of my life sir I'm gonna be learning how to love my wife how to encourage my children and not provoke them I got a feeling our sisters will be learning to submit their whole lives don't you we're gonna be learning our whole lives let's build each other up instead of tearing people down now I've heard preachers church I've heard preachers say we could never live this but I disagree are we growing in some areas absolutely we're not perfect but when I hear preachers say we can't live this I'm like oh no we can live this my wife submits to me I hope she can say I love her Hallelujah oh my children can say I've raised them in the fear and admonition of the Lord I hope my children could say I didn't provoke them to anger I hope I never made Lydia Malachi mad like that amen hallelujah I don't ask him all these questions before service and plan it out so I just trust it by God's grace I haven't provoked them to be anger I hope I showed that Mercy praise God I hope that's my been my testimony because I've showed the mercy of Christ you know why because Christ has been merciful to me how many appreciate the Lord for his Mercy today let's bow our heads here Heavenly Father we thank you for this passage of scripture Lord God lord If the message needs anything it's this Lord we want rapturing Faith Lord we're looking for the latter rain no doubt about that but Lord we need a body of Christ that doesn't have any divisions it doesn't have any swelling doesn't have any broken
