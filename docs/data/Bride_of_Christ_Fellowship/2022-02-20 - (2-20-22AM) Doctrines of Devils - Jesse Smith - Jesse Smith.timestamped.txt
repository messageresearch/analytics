[0:07] first timothy four verse one
[0:09] i'd like to uh preach on doctrines of
[0:12] devils this morning we've you know spent
[0:14] seven sermons looking at the true
[0:15] doctrine
[0:17] the doctrine of the lord jesus christ
[0:19] we'd say revealed to paul
[0:22] and so i want to look at doctrines of
[0:24] devils
[0:25] it's a quite extensive subject
[0:28] so i don't think i'll be able to finish
[0:29] it this morning unless i preach about
[0:31] three hours so
[0:32] i don't think i'm gonna preach three
[0:33] hours though so uh it's a it's a really
[0:36] extensive subject
[0:38] and uh
[0:39] wednesday night i ended the live stream
[0:41] so i could show some examples from
[0:43] around the message
[0:44] about doctrine so i'll review that today
[0:46] because i don't want anybody to miss out
[0:47] when you're working on wednesday night
[0:49] you know and
[0:50] um but there's certain things i don't i
[0:52] don't want it to go public as you know
[0:55] as
[0:55] all churches do that mostly you know
[0:58] but i'll share that lord winning at the
[0:59] end of this sermon this this morning
[1:02] first timothy 4 verse 1 if you have your
[1:04] bibles
[1:09] and we'll break this down lord willing
[1:11] we'll just go through this slowly and
[1:13] see
[1:14] we've already seen how the holy ghost
[1:15] brings doctrine now here we'll see how
[1:18] satan brings in false doctrine
[1:21] first timothy 4 verse 1.
[1:25] let's just read verse one together okay
[1:28] verse one let's begin on three one two
[1:30] three now the spirit speaketh expressly
[1:33] that in the latter times some shall
[1:36] depart from the faith giving he to
[1:39] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[1:43] let's have a word of prayer let's bow
[1:44] our heads here and ask god to minister
[1:45] heavenly father you are worthy
[1:47] hallelujah you're worthy of all praise
[1:49] we say thank you jesus hallelujah you're
[1:52] worthy
[1:53] worthy is a lamb that was slain we know
[1:55] all heaven says holy holy holy without
[1:58] ceasing lord god you are so holy you are
[2:00] so worthy lord god we in our humble
[2:03] little insignificant lives lord it would
[2:05] seem to the world lord god and we humble
[2:08] ourselves this morning lord in our
[2:09] humble little way we just come before
[2:11] you and we ask that the spirit of god
[2:13] the holy ghost the spirit of christ
[2:15] would come and anoint us oh god for this
[2:17] service to hear lord to preach to
[2:20] receive to testify hallelujah to
[2:22] prophesy whatever you'd have to be done
[2:24] today lord god teach us and instruct us
[2:26] the lord god correct us lord whenever we
[2:28] have need of today we ask that your holy
[2:30] ghost will do it lord god for lord you
[2:32] said the spirit will guide us into all
[2:34] truth so lord we're looking for truth
[2:35] today you said you'd provide all of our
[2:37] needs you said you never leave us nor
[2:39] forsake us so hallelujah we expect lord
[2:42] god we we're trusting in your promise to
[2:44] give us what we have need of today on
[2:46] our earthly journey and so we give you
[2:47] all the praise and we ask for your
[2:49] spirit in jesus christ's name and the
[2:51] saint said amen god bless you as you're
[2:53] being seated praise god
[2:57] i do have uh some notes so i'd like to
[3:00] share those here
[3:11] you know lord willing uh you know today
[3:13] we'll preach on doctrines of devils this
[3:15] morning rather and then this afternoon
[3:17] for the sunday school we'll probably
[3:18] start teaching on the denominational
[3:19] spirit because it goes so closely with
[3:21] this i like the children to know why
[3:23] we're not a denomination that's the
[3:24] sermon brother amen came in on
[3:27] and we'll go through that and break that
[3:28] down
[3:30] my wife and i were talking we hope
[3:32] we hope all the children had a good week
[3:33] of honor and mom and dad this week by
[3:35] god's grace you know
[3:36] spent about an hour and a half on that
[3:38] last sunday so hopefully that was a
[3:39] blessing and if we need more let me know
[3:41] we'll do more bible studies on that
[3:42] we'll just drill right into
[3:45] uh them know by the power of the holy
[3:47] spirit you know so we're thankful for
[3:49] god's amazing grace
[3:51] um
[3:53] you know i'll just share this briefly
[3:55] you know uh
[3:56] i preached six marriage banquets you
[3:58] know and that the last one brother cams
[4:00] when they had me come over there a few
[4:01] years ago i shared
[4:03] um i shared what i felt was the most
[4:06] important part of parenting
[4:09] and i the scriptures in proverbs
[4:11] uh or ecclesiastes i can't remember
[4:13] right now but the point was a mother or
[4:16] father whoever's there when the child
[4:18] disobeys they've got to do a uh
[4:20] they've got to do correction right there
[4:24] um i think the bible i think it's
[4:25] ecclesiastes that scripture comes from
[4:27] you don't want to delay correction you
[4:29] want correction to happen quickly
[4:31] and so i said if any compliment goes i
[4:33] could give to my wife i would give that
[4:34] to her where she's able to have those
[4:35] conversations with the children
[4:37] right there right when they make the
[4:39] mistake or shortly after you know
[4:40] whenever
[4:41] life allows it right
[4:44] and i said that's what's formed the
[4:45] character of my children
[4:47] and i think you would say the same with
[4:48] your parents how did you learn
[4:51] to behave it was through the correction
[4:52] right because if it's not corrected it
[4:55] grows worse and worse and worse
[4:57] right so that's what we see in this
[4:59] generation you know we see a generation
[5:00] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[5:03] right why is that well because they're
[5:05] not corrected in love they've got to be
[5:07] corrected in love and brother ram now we
[5:09] don't do this all the time but brother
[5:10] brahm said when you correct them first
[5:11] tell them all the good they're doing
[5:14] tell them all the good things they do
[5:15] right
[5:16] encourage them say thank you for and of
[5:18] course we don't do that all the time but
[5:19] at some point you need to tell your
[5:21] children that you know thank you for
[5:22] doing this and thank you for taking out
[5:23] the trash thank you for cleaning your
[5:25] room thanks for picking up the toys
[5:26] but then you need to bring the
[5:28] correction
[5:29] and uh the sooner it is the better but
[5:32] it must be done in love
[5:34] praise god like the bible said fathers
[5:35] do not bring your children to wrath well
[5:37] of course that would apply to mothers
[5:38] too mothers don't bring your children to
[5:40] wrath don't be so
[5:41] harsh with them that they get angry and
[5:43] they want to fight back or something
[5:45] like that you know
[5:48] so it's the spirit of christ it's the
[5:49] love of god you know manifesting in our
[5:51] lives
[5:52] and we're grateful for that praise god
[5:54] now with time i just thought you know we
[5:56] would go there and uh i wanted to pray a
[5:57] little bit before service we got here a
[5:58] little later so i just want to pray a
[6:00] little extra i hope that's okay this is
[6:01] the house of prayer praise god
[6:03] so thank you for your patience so i
[6:05] wanted to read this as a text so let's
[6:07] pick up where we where we stopped our
[6:08] text
[6:10] when satan brings in a false doctrine he
[6:13] speaks
[6:14] a lie in hypocrisy
[6:17] so the preachers will be hypocrites and
[6:19] we'll look we'll break this down slowly
[6:21] the preachers will be hypocrites
[6:23] and because it's because their
[6:25] conscience which is their their
[6:26] spiritual stop light don't do this or go
[6:29] stop go precaution you know
[6:31] they they forget they just blow right
[6:33] through that that warning
[6:35] their their conscience becomes seared
[6:37] with the hot iron in other words their
[6:38] stop light lost its power
[6:40] right or whatever you could say the
[6:42] power went out there's no conscience
[6:44] there to stop them
[6:45] because they've silenced their
[6:47] conscience so satan anoints them to be
[6:49] hypocrites
[6:51] and they don't have a conscience of
[6:52] right and wrong uh they their their
[6:55] conscience is they don't have the
[6:56] feeling of right and wrong anymore
[6:58] and then paul gives two examples which
[7:00] we'll break down here
[7:02] in a moment
[7:05] these were two that were
[7:06] combating the ephesian church and i
[7:08] remember paul warned them he said for
[7:10] three years i warned you with tears so
[7:12] he writes this letter after he left he
[7:14] would not go back again
[7:16] right
[7:17] uh he left and timothy was there
[7:19] pastoring or i'm sorry doing
[7:20] evangelistic work in ephesus and he
[7:22] brought word to paul in prison and said
[7:24] they're having these troubles and so
[7:26] paul and that's how it wasn't with the
[7:28] colossian church as we looked at last
[7:29] sunday
[7:30] a messenger would always go you know a
[7:32] preacher would go there for paul come
[7:34] back and tell paul how are they they
[7:36] were doing well two of the false
[7:38] doctrines that it incorporated into the
[7:39] ephesian church war where preachers
[7:42] shouldn't marry
[7:43] right that was one of them and paul says
[7:45] that's a doctrine of the devil
[7:48] and another one was you can't eat meat
[7:51] or you abstain from meats
[7:53] paul calls that a doctrine of the devil
[7:57] think about that a holy ghost-filled
[7:58] church with signs miracles and wonders
[8:00] how is satan going to slow them down
[8:01] he's going to give them false commands
[8:03] right satan's going to deceive them with
[8:05] false commands coming from hypocrites
[8:09] but
[8:10] the holy spirit and paul knew there was
[8:12] believers there that would detect that
[8:14] lie amen
[8:15] hallelujah no doubt each group you know
[8:18] there's usually three kinds of believers
[8:19] in every group now we're hoping we're
[8:20] the exception
[8:22] amen uh we but we've seen over the years
[8:24] where you know we're not always
[8:26] but hopefully we'll get to the spot
[8:27] where we are by the grace of god
[8:29] hallelujah we're all true believers amen
[8:32] but uh paul
[8:34] paul no doubt paul said in the letter
[8:36] there to show them
[8:37] uh because god created listen god
[8:39] created both of these to be received
[8:41] with thanksgiving
[8:42] the mayor's union and also meets
[8:45] they're both to be received with
[8:47] thanksgiving
[8:48] and so the holy spirit anointed paul to
[8:51] get word you know from timothy okay and
[8:53] so timothy would sit right there as
[8:54] timothy wrote it out or that sometimes
[8:56] they'd have another man right off the
[8:57] scripture
[8:58] and uh from his words and he would send
[9:01] he would send back this word you know to
[9:03] to ephesus and they would read the
[9:04] letter
[9:05] you know they would read it before the
[9:06] people can you imagine if you're the
[9:08] guilty preacher and they just read this
[9:09] for paul and paul's talking about you
[9:11] you imagine the sunday before you just
[9:13] said you brothers you preachers can't
[9:14] marry and now let's read a letter from
[9:16] paul
[9:18] and all the ministers are sitting there
[9:19] and everybody would turn and look at the
[9:20] minister
[9:22] you just preached it last week and paul
[9:24] said it's the devil
[9:25] see
[9:26] but that that's that's the correction of
[9:28] the holy ghost praise god amen
[9:30] hallelujah thank god amen thank god that
[9:33] there's an absolute thank god that we
[9:34] have the word of god today amen
[9:36] to detect these doctrines of demons
[9:40] and church they try to get in here right
[9:41] they've tried to get in here over the
[9:42] years they try no every church satan is
[9:45] constantly trying to battle churches to
[9:47] get into them but we've got to hold up a
[9:49] standard against him amen we've got to
[9:51] get the standard out and fly the flag
[9:52] and say we're not letting the enemy come
[9:54] in we're driving the enemy out praise
[9:56] god
[9:57] we're not giving the enemy any ground
[9:59] amen we've possessed all these grounds
[10:00] we've taken this spiritual land footstep
[10:03] by footstep by possession by possession
[10:06] and we're not giving it up praise god
[10:07] we're not giving any place to the devil
[10:09] this is god's land amen and we're more
[10:11] than conquerors and we're protecting the
[10:13] land we're keeping the land and in fact
[10:15] we're possessing more land amen
[10:17] hallelujah
[10:18] amen
[10:20] do not let the devil drive you off the
[10:21] land god has given to you
[10:24] is he never trying to the devil is
[10:25] trying to draw the look look at me look
[10:27] at it look at him there he's trying to
[10:29] convince the preachers
[10:31] he's trying to influence the ministers
[10:33] right and then the
[10:35] sisters and then here now this one
[10:36] affects every woman in the church the
[10:38] meats because they're the cooks
[10:41] so see how he's trying to infiltrate
[10:43] he'll go through the preachers the women
[10:44] the family everybody's open season with
[10:47] with satan
[10:51] all right let's go hedge about you
[10:53] satan is going to try to impact and try
[10:55] to uh
[10:56] hinder you frustrate you but never be
[10:59] discouraged praise god because god is
[11:01] faithful amen he promised i will never
[11:03] leave you i'll never forsake you and if
[11:04] you are going through a test then it
[11:06] shows god has confidence in you that
[11:07] you'll overcome and pass that test amen
[11:10] and learn something coming out of it
[11:11] praise god hallelujah because we all
[11:13] need to learn how many need to learn
[11:14] more about god hallelujah we all need to
[11:16] grow in the knowledge and revelation of
[11:19] jesus christ praise god
[11:20] now i put this just up here for uh
[11:22] sister faith is she here today i didn't
[11:24] see her see okay well god bless your
[11:25] faith i'm sure she can hear me
[11:27] can you right through the walls you know
[11:28] uh i just put it up here you know just
[11:30] as a brief uh review of the ministry of
[11:32] william branham
[11:34] you know i'm recently recently made a
[11:35] video about brother branham's human side
[11:37] and how we welcome correction and
[11:39] and uh this is what we really need to
[11:41] understand in this day that brother
[11:43] branham was a human he had a divine side
[11:46] which was the prophetic ministry and
[11:47] also the preaching and teaching ministry
[11:49] but he also had a human side okay and
[11:52] just as a review for uh sister
[11:54] faith there you know he lived from 1909
[11:56] to 65.
[11:57] uh he had a worldwide healing and
[11:59] discernment ministry which was so
[12:01] powerful that all the pentecostal
[12:03] historians count him as the man who
[12:05] started the current revival the healing
[12:07] revival
[12:08] that is still going around the world
[12:10] praise god now satan has infiltrated
[12:12] that i'm going to preach a whole sermon
[12:14] on that
[12:15] lord willing about there's a false uh
[12:18] there's a false anointing that gets on
[12:20] denominational people
[12:22] i haven't seen it too much in the
[12:23] message but you see it all over the
[12:25] mainstream churches like the word of
[12:27] faith churches you know like the kenneth
[12:29] copeland's and the uh uh the bethel's
[12:32] and the hill songs
[12:34] uh
[12:35] and a lot of it and they talk about
[12:37] healings and they may have healings but
[12:39] when when they're
[12:40] when they get impartations it looks like
[12:43] the devil
[12:45] rather than the holy ghost so i'm going
[12:47] to preach a whole sermon on that and
[12:48] just show you it's probably one of those
[12:50] private sermons you know
[12:51] because i don't i don't mean to make
[12:52] people bad or make people look bad but
[12:54] but they're the ones that are exposing
[12:55] themselves making themselves look bad
[12:57] and the bible said we got to rebuke them
[12:59] that sin before all
[13:01] but anyways satan in other words satan
[13:03] has a copycat
[13:05] he's impersonating the real healing that
[13:07] comes through believers amen
[13:08] he's doing so so now his time has gone
[13:10] on he's impersonated healing
[13:13] and
[13:13] when satan's anointing comes on him they
[13:15] get in pain
[13:16] god's holy spirit is not going to give
[13:18] you pain
[13:19] it's not gonna hurt you you're not gonna
[13:21] be screaming like you're in pain you're
[13:23] gonna be screaming like you're getting
[13:24] victory amen there's a different kind of
[13:26] scream amen
[13:28] there's a scream of victory there's a
[13:29] scream of deliverance but it's not a
[13:31] scream of pain and of agony
[13:33] right of being tormented it's not a
[13:35] scream of torment
[13:37] and so we thank god that we have the
[13:38] real holy spirit here today praise god
[13:40] amen
[13:42] but brother man spoke with thus ate the
[13:44] lord many times but i have at least
[13:46] there's over 30 that apply to us that
[13:48] apply to doctrine and uh prophecy
[13:51] there's over 30 for doctrine and
[13:53] prophecy
[13:54] he fulfilled numerous prophecies
[13:56] revelation 10 7 you know malachi 4 5 and
[13:59] 6.
[14:00] matthew 17 11 luke 17 30. fulfill many
[14:04] prophecies in the ministry of brother
[14:05] branham he fulfilled the bible mysteries
[14:07] revelation 10 7 the mystery of god
[14:09] finish and he's turned our hearts back
[14:12] back to the apostolic fathers that's why
[14:14] we love paul so much is because god sent
[14:16] a prophet like paul brother branham to
[14:18] point us back to the bible amen
[14:21] that's why we love him brother abraham
[14:22] so much because he point us back to the
[14:24] word of god that's why we love paul so
[14:25] much amen all these men of god
[14:28] martin luther john wesley because they
[14:29] point us back to the word of god
[14:31] hallelujah
[14:32] amen
[14:34] now here's now here's where
[14:36] uh
[14:38] here's the human side right the human
[14:39] side of brother ram he was fully human
[14:41] though so he had so much supernatural so
[14:43] much bible truth but he was also human
[14:47] and some people stumbled by the fact he
[14:48] died from injuries in a car accident
[14:52] which it doesn't matter how god takes
[14:53] you home god takes people home in many
[14:55] different ways
[14:56] and we don't get to choose that right
[14:58] most of the time
[14:59] some people do you know with suicide
[15:01] which is very awful it's a sin no doubt
[15:02] but it's not uh it's not the the last
[15:04] sin that's not the unpardonable sin
[15:07] uh but
[15:08] it just you know people look at that and
[15:10] they think oh i was a prophet
[15:12] but you see if you look it down through
[15:13] the ages people died from different all
[15:15] kinds of different things
[15:17] and uh you know we should just pray god
[15:19] help me to go when it's my time to go
[15:20] right like we don't want to be like
[15:21] hezekiah
[15:23] right and say well gloria give me more
[15:24] time and then fail god
[15:26] right and waste your god gave him 15
[15:29] more years well he wasted that 15 years
[15:31] and he had alliance with babylon we
[15:32] don't want to live we'd rather go home
[15:34] when god wants us to go home
[15:36] but you know uh
[15:38] the first major we'd say falling away
[15:40] from the message came in the 77 because
[15:43] brother madam just made he made a human
[15:45] prediction he thought that the end time
[15:47] would come before 77. and there's three
[15:50] reasons he said 1977. he said first
[15:53] because no uh democracy had lasted 200
[15:56] years so our our nation started in 1776
[15:58] well what's what's 1776 plus 200. it's
[16:01] 1976.
[16:03] so he saw that in history and he's but
[16:05] he also said if it does it'll break all
[16:07] history so he also knew that you know it
[16:09] could go beyond that but he just had
[16:11] never seen that in history
[16:12] also he calculated the number of years
[16:15] abra from abraham to christ was 1 954
[16:19] years so when he calculated that
[16:21] after uh you know the holy ghost fell on
[16:23] the day of pentecost he saw he thought
[16:25] well the gentiles will have that same
[16:27] amount of time if the jews had this
[16:28] amount of time the gentiles will have
[16:30] that amount of time
[16:31] of course that was a human understanding
[16:32] it was his human guess
[16:34] now remember he never made the
[16:36] prediction with in the name of the lord
[16:38] he constantly said this is not god this
[16:40] is just my opinion based upon dates
[16:43] so see why you know see why a date
[16:45] setting you know it's it's a desire it's
[16:49] a fine desire to want to know when he's
[16:50] going to come but do you see how it's
[16:52] not it's not it's not thus saith the
[16:54] lord
[16:55] right this is not thus saith the lord
[16:58] and that's why i don't really want to
[16:59] get into date setting you know what i
[17:00] mean i don't i don't want to get into
[17:01] that because then people actually feel
[17:02] like maybe it is the spirit of god but
[17:05] it isn't unless it's god and then also
[17:07] brother brahm calculated how many
[17:08] jubilees have there been since the first
[17:10] jubilee in in leviticus 25 verse 8. i
[17:13] was listening to it this week that's why
[17:14] i'm kind of familiar with these uh from
[17:16] daniel's 70th week and brother ram said
[17:19] 1977 will be the anniversary of the 70th
[17:22] jubilee
[17:24] right so he just thought well that must
[17:25] be significant so there's three reasons
[17:27] i think it'll be 77.
[17:29] okay and he never said it was not saint
[17:31] or well it came and went well many
[17:32] people fell away during that time well
[17:34] that's because they weren't they were
[17:35] looking more at brother branham as a man
[17:37] rather than looking at the word
[17:39] in other words they saw the supernatural
[17:41] but they really weren't interested in
[17:42] the word of god
[17:44] right because the word of god never
[17:45] predicted that and so forth now since 77
[17:48] many cults have risen up but we should
[17:50] understand that because satan is
[17:51] battling the message of the hour
[17:54] church martin luther said at the end of
[17:56] his life he said i don't even think one
[17:58] tenth of the people we've seen saved are
[18:00] still serving god today
[18:02] not even a tenth can you imagine think
[18:04] about the people we baptized brother
[18:05] bang over the years i would say
[18:07] i hope a tenth have i would think maybe
[18:09] a little over a tenth have been have
[18:10] stayed
[18:11] you know
[18:12] i hope you know think about it think
[18:14] about otis and tammy remember i mean
[18:17] devon you know look i mean think about
[18:19] this you know
[18:21] how many people we baptize
[18:22] that's just how it is
[18:24] people see the move of god and they want
[18:26] a part of it but if they don't uh make
[18:28] their ground a good ground then the
[18:31] enemy's gonna come and snatch that away
[18:33] or he's gonna raise up you know he's
[18:34] gonna raise up uh weeds and it's gonna
[18:37] choke out the real word of god oh my but
[18:39] thank god that we can have good and
[18:40] honest hearts lord lord help us god may
[18:43] you help us lord to have good and honest
[18:45] hearts to keep all the weeds out of our
[18:47] lives amen
[18:48] that we can stand here and say there is
[18:49] a true seed and i do have good ground
[18:52] and this seed is going to produce fruit
[18:53] hallelujah
[18:54] amen well just like there's 33 000
[18:57] denominations
[18:59] right just like that
[19:01] it's the same thing satan comes in there
[19:02] when people have a desire and if they're
[19:04] not sturdy and strong and solid on the
[19:06] word of god they're going to be deceived
[19:09] so they're going to fall away
[19:10] we'll let them fall away i mean that's
[19:12] their choice you can't force somebody to
[19:13] come to church again force anybody let
[19:15] them fall away let jesus say let the
[19:17] blind lead the blind amen
[19:20] yes give them warnings but after a while
[19:21] you can't warn them the rest of your
[19:22] life you give them warnings as you're
[19:24] filled out of the holy spirit and you
[19:26] let them choose their own path you let
[19:28] them love what they want to love but as
[19:30] for me and my house we will love the
[19:31] lord amen
[19:33] this is the prophecy this had to happen
[19:36] and this didn't happen just in brother
[19:37] ramsey it's been happening in every day
[19:39] like we said with martin luther
[19:42] he saw it falling away a mighty man like
[19:44] that
[19:45] a tremendous man of god yet he had his
[19:47] faults and failures
[19:49] he had a lot of fault he kept the same
[19:51] denominational kind of setup as the
[19:52] roman catholic church um
[19:55] he was anti-semitic so he was against
[19:57] the jews because he thought they
[19:58] crucified christ so some of his writings
[20:00] encouraged people to burn down jewish
[20:02] synagogues
[20:03] that was a big stain on his
[20:05] that was a big stain on his life but
[20:06] church how many know that we're all
[20:07] going to have saints on our lives
[20:09] i'm not excusing sin i'm just saying
[20:11] none of us are above sin
[20:13] nobody's perfect here today
[20:15] i like that like they joked did you hang
[20:16] up your angel wings over there on the on
[20:18] the coat rack did you did you leave him
[20:20] over there no you don't have any angel
[20:21] wings yeah you're not perfect you know
[20:23] you're you when i we fall short you're
[20:25] never going to find anybody who is
[20:27] perfect outside of jesus christ but
[20:29] that's the beauty of it because he gets
[20:31] all the glory he's the sustainer of our
[20:33] lives he's the keeper of our lives he's
[20:35] the redeemer of our lives amen
[20:38] there's got to be one redeemer one lamb
[20:40] amen there's got to be one man amen who
[20:42] can breathe if one man led to all this
[20:44] death adam there's got to be what's why
[20:47] he alone gets all the glory amen
[20:49] hallelujah
[20:51] every age has had falling away every age
[20:54] so we're we're not we're not exempt from
[20:56] that we're going to have to battle that
[21:00] and then some of the greater followings
[21:01] away was with a 2001 here i stand
[21:03] article that exalted uh voice of god to
[21:06] this place
[21:08] where they said the most important job
[21:09] today is making tapes that's that's a
[21:11] lie the most important job today is
[21:13] preaching and living the word of god
[21:16] hallelujah because jesus said go and
[21:18] teach all nations he didn't say go and
[21:19] make tape say man he said go and do that
[21:22] he said preach the gospel amen
[21:24] it's preaching and living i say living
[21:26] for you and i because for all of you
[21:27] you're not all preachers you don't have
[21:28] to be
[21:29] you probably don't want to wish to be a
[21:30] preacher it's not it's not always the
[21:32] easiest thing but you know your job's
[21:33] not so easy either we all got hard jobs
[21:35] amen but i say it that's why i say it
[21:37] preach and live it amen because all of
[21:39] us are involved you got to receive the
[21:41] preaching and you have to receive the
[21:42] life of christ you have to live a life
[21:45] worthy of the gospel
[21:47] well that that move in 2001 really
[21:49] started getting people exalting uh
[21:51] brother joseph and the the
[21:53] jeffersonville movement
[21:55] which i still try to correct him i never
[21:56] hear back from him anymore so i'll just
[21:58] keep trying because that's what a
[21:59] christian does amen
[22:00] and then of course 2012 the believe the
[22:03] sign movement this it brought out all
[22:05] these human mistakes of brother branham
[22:07] now some of them some of the concerns
[22:09] are very legitimate that's why i preach
[22:10] it to you i preached the prove the prove
[22:12] all things series remember that a couple
[22:13] years ago
[22:15] uh some of them are concerns but some of
[22:16] them are just so
[22:18] uh i'd say uh
[22:20] unimportant you know so unimportant
[22:23] uh
[22:25] and it's a lot of these are based on
[22:26] assumptions and not waiting on the lord
[22:30] and this is caused now like like i've
[22:32] heard from a sister who has a sister in
[22:34] who lives in florida who's from brazil
[22:36] she said brazil churches are falling
[22:38] away from the message by the droves or
[22:40] by the scores you know
[22:42] uh
[22:43] because of the influence of believe the
[22:45] sign
[22:46] and of course i debated them you know
[22:48] two years ago and so forth but uh
[22:53] it's as if
[22:54] people were taught wrong because to me
[22:57] how could i ever fall away from the lord
[22:59] jesus christ water baptism
[23:01] i could ever fall away from the fact
[23:02] that god never calls himself three
[23:04] persons how can i fall see i can't fall
[23:06] away from that because i'm founded i'm
[23:08] standing on a rock amen the message is
[23:11] the rock of the word praise god
[23:14] see the reason they can fall away
[23:15] because they were built on sand there it
[23:17] is amen their lives have been on sand
[23:19] man-made ideas or worshiping brother
[23:21] branham or exalting brother ram too high
[23:23] and not showing the human side of it
[23:24] their lives were built on sand so when
[23:26] the storms come when the floods come
[23:29] they fail amen their house was was was
[23:31] destroyed but when the storm comes on us
[23:34] those of us who stand on the rock our
[23:36] houses are built on the rock our houses
[23:38] stand amen we can stand in the storm
[23:41] amen because we're not founded on sand
[23:43] humanity we're we're founded on the
[23:46] solid rock the eternal rock and that
[23:48] rock was christ amen
[23:50] that's why we stand amen that's why they
[23:53] can't blow or blow us away because we're
[23:55] not we're not founded on a man's system
[23:58] we're founded on the revelation of jesus
[24:00] christ
[24:02] amen it's exactly right
[24:06] hallelujah
[24:08] it's a great following way but let them
[24:10] fall
[24:11] hallelujah god knows how to direct his
[24:13] word amen every week brother bang i get
[24:14] numerous emails your video helped me
[24:16] here this helped me hear this i got one
[24:17] this week that said i was i was
[24:19] struggling and i listened to your sermon
[24:20] last week and now i'm saying the message
[24:22] that's what i want to do praise god
[24:24] i'm not responsible uh for where the
[24:27] word goes i'm just responsible for
[24:28] scattering the seed
[24:30] amen so are you that's all we got to do
[24:33] we just got to scatter the seed amen and
[24:35] god will take that seed and he'll fall
[24:37] in all those places
[24:40] glory i think of the sower right right
[24:42] right right amen he just goes like he
[24:44] just throws him out in the field like
[24:45] you know he don't place him well i'll do
[24:47] one right here i'll do one right here he
[24:49] just he just scatters a seed he just
[24:51] scatters it because he knows there's a
[24:53] law of god amen
[24:55] and when he throws it out there the
[24:56] winds of the holy ghost
[24:58] will take those seeds and they'll land
[25:00] and he knows god god is great enough to
[25:03] honor those seeds hallelujah
[25:05] amen he don't even water it himself i
[25:08] mean he'd be good a little bit you know
[25:09] as a as a farmer as a if you have a home
[25:11] garden you water your seeds and things
[25:13] like that but the main water comes from
[25:15] god he knows god is responsible and
[25:18] god's laws will go to the word church
[25:20] aren't you glad god's law watered your
[25:22] seed hallelujah
[25:25] thank you jesus
[25:26] so church we're desiring to stay in the
[25:28] middle of the road now
[25:30] i was going a little slower than i
[25:31] thought so
[25:32] um but here brother adam says this i
[25:34] want to just show you this here about
[25:36] doctrines of devils
[25:37] it's from the church age book
[25:40] now look not some cases in every case
[25:43] a false prophet is one who's outside the
[25:46] word
[25:48] that's why i love joseph branham but
[25:50] i've told him brother you got 11
[25:51] mistakes outside the word of god
[25:54] and i told all his followers
[25:55] contact me i said when are you going to
[25:56] repent of those they won't repent of
[25:58] them they double down and the list just
[26:00] keeps growing
[26:02] see a real prophet is not off the word
[26:05] they're on the word
[26:08] see antichrist means anti-word or
[26:11] opponent of the word
[26:14] that's what the word adversary means an
[26:15] opponent so anyone who's antichrist is
[26:18] opposing the revelation of the bible
[26:21] they might even be holding the bible but
[26:23] if they oppose what the bible says
[26:25] they're antichrist
[26:28] so false prophets pervert the word
[26:32] giving it a meeting that fits their own
[26:34] devilish ends
[26:36] now what's the devilish end i would say
[26:39] of worshipping the tapes what's
[26:41] worshiping brother branham it's idolatry
[26:43] of william branham instead of jesus
[26:45] christ getting the worship now william
[26:46] branham gets it or a tape gets it or a
[26:48] cd can you imagine that or an sd card
[26:50] gets the worship instead of christ
[26:53] that to me that's the end of it and also
[26:56] some men get richer while others get
[26:58] poorer
[26:59] that's right
[27:01] money women popularity
[27:04] some people are getting really rich
[27:06] through this
[27:07] it's a devilish end brother ram says
[27:11] false prophets go off the word they make
[27:13] false prophecies like they say thus
[27:15] saith the lord they said uh we're in the
[27:16] perfect will of god playing tapes and
[27:18] limiting the five-fold ministry that's
[27:20] impossible
[27:21] i challenge that statement on the
[27:23] authority of ephesians chapter four amen
[27:26] that says the fivefold ministry will
[27:29] bring us to a unity of faith it'll bring
[27:31] us to perfection amen until we all come
[27:34] in the measure of the stature of the
[27:36] person of christ amen
[27:38] i challenge that
[27:41] by the holy spirit praise god
[27:43] amen
[27:44] because a false prophet takes you away
[27:46] from the word
[27:49] not to the word
[27:51] see so i don't know what their ends are
[27:53] but that to me it looks like popularity
[27:55] money that's what it looks like to me
[27:58] have you ever noticed how the people who
[28:00] lead others astray bind them closely to
[28:01] themselves by what fear
[28:04] now it's different we have to have the
[28:05] fear of god and you should brother bam
[28:07] said i fear my wife i fear the
[28:08] congregation i don't want to live in a
[28:10] way that causes them to stumble so i
[28:11] would say i feel brother i fear brother
[28:13] bang today because i don't want to fail
[28:15] him i don't want him to think less of me
[28:16] as a christian
[28:18] so that's not the fear we're talking
[28:19] about here
[28:20] this is
[28:21] a false prophet fear is like if you
[28:22] don't listen to me you're lost
[28:24] it's the same idea if your name's not on
[28:26] our book for membership if you don't
[28:28] join our church you're going to hell
[28:29] that's a lie
[28:30] see they're lying on purpose watch they
[28:32] can get your money or they can have
[28:34] influence over you so they can have
[28:35] power that's what that's what those
[28:36] devils want is power over people
[28:38] the only one who has power over you is
[28:39] the holy ghost praise god that's the
[28:41] only one who has power over us yes i
[28:43] have influence and yes i'm supposed to
[28:45] rule the house of god but really i rule
[28:47] by the holy ghost and if i'm ruling by
[28:48] the holy ghost and the holy ghost is
[28:50] ruling your life it's not me it's the
[28:52] holy ghost inside of you praise god
[28:54] and what i preach should align with the
[28:56] word of god that the holy ghost has
[28:58] already wrote praise god amen so you can
[29:00] say when when i'm preaching you can say
[29:02] amen to it because you know it's in the
[29:04] word
[29:06] see they bind themselves you've got to
[29:08] follow me
[29:11] right and i'll just share it like this
[29:12] that jeffersonville movement has just
[29:14] been repeating over and over how the
[29:15] rapture is so close the rapture is so
[29:17] close and i would just think that god
[29:19] would let the rapture go longer because
[29:21] of that
[29:24] because the last 20 years i've been the
[29:26] message everybody's predicting how soon
[29:27] it is and look what god keeps doing
[29:30] oh it's going to be 2013. no it's going
[29:32] to be this it's going to be that going
[29:33] to be and it's going to be 2018.
[29:35] 2019. i just heard another preacher just
[29:37] i i watched a video from him this week
[29:39] somebody sent me a sermon about 1977 and
[29:41] he said it was gonna be 2019. now it's
[29:43] 2022.
[29:45] and he says if i'm wrong i'll come here
[29:47] and apologize i don't know if he did
[29:48] but now but now he's saying it's 2026
[29:51] now i'm like can you guys just stop with
[29:53] it would you please stop getting
[29:55] everybody's
[29:56] this prediction making see they all
[29:58] think they're prophets but they're not
[30:00] you can't think yourself a prophet you
[30:02] can't make yourself a prophet you're
[30:03] born to prophet amen
[30:07] you look at their churches they're dead
[30:08] nobody wants to worship you
[30:10] you've got to rebuke them just to say
[30:11] amen if god's in your heart and you've
[30:14] on the if you've got the fire of god in
[30:15] your heart it's a joy to say amen it's a
[30:17] joy to raise your hands it's a joy to
[30:19] worship and sing to god because you've
[30:21] got the love of god inside of you how
[30:22] could you not worship god amen how could
[30:25] you not love the word of god praise god
[30:27] hallelujah
[30:30] by their fruits they're known
[30:33] the fruit of fear
[30:35] and the fruit of spiritual deadness and
[30:37] lukewarmness
[30:40] these false prophets say if you don't do
[30:42] what i say or if you leave then you're
[30:44] going to be destroyed
[30:46] got to follow the false prophet
[30:51] now he goes on to say this is the end of
[30:52] this quote i believe
[30:54] he said there are false prophets for a
[30:55] true prophet will always lead one to the
[30:57] word
[30:58] and bind the people to jesus christ and
[31:01] he won't tell the people to fear him or
[31:03] what he says but to fear what the word
[31:05] says
[31:06] notice how these people like judas are
[31:08] out for
[31:10] money
[31:12] they get you to sell all that you have
[31:15] and give it to them in their schemes
[31:16] they spend more time on offerings than
[31:19] the word
[31:20] those who attempt to operate gifts will
[31:22] make use of a gift which has a margin of
[31:24] error in it and then ask for money and
[31:26] neglect the word of god and call it god
[31:29] and people will go to them and bear with
[31:31] them and support them and believe them
[31:33] not knowing it is the way of death
[31:35] that's how you know it's off the word
[31:37] that's why i've reached out to joseph
[31:38] branham i've reached out to billy paul
[31:40] branham i've reached out to that other
[31:41] brother who preached 24 false things and
[31:43] none of them can receive it they all
[31:45] just double down on their false
[31:46] doctrines
[31:47] what can i do i can just say the blind
[31:49] will lead the blind
[31:50] and just show christian love and just
[31:51] pray for them that's all i can do
[31:56] now i just want you to see this here the
[31:58] antichrist look at this the opponent of
[32:00] the word the one who's fighting against
[32:02] the word refuses
[32:04] the true bride doctrine
[32:07] so this is how we know this is how we
[32:09] know the antichrist they're going to
[32:10] refuse the doctrine for the bride of
[32:12] jesus christ
[32:14] they won't receive the real revelation
[32:16] of the holy spirit they refuse it in
[32:18] other words they're saying i'm not going
[32:20] to learn that i don't want to learn that
[32:22] i want what i'm going to learn what i
[32:23] want to learn i don't want to learn what
[32:25] the bride's going to learn oh but we're
[32:26] the bride of christ and we learn what
[32:28] our husband wants us to know praise god
[32:30] we can be taught amen we can understand
[32:33] we can grow in revelation because we're
[32:35] being taught by the holy spirit the
[32:37] spirit of the bridegroom
[32:40] so therefore the antichrist takes his
[32:42] own bride now and builds her up under a
[32:45] creed of his own takes his own bride and
[32:47] makes her a denomination and many messed
[32:49] churches have become denominated because
[32:51] they gather what they believe and they
[32:53] can't receive any more revelation
[32:55] she gives birth to other denominations
[32:57] as quoted in this holy scripture give
[32:59] birth to daughters roman catholic church
[33:01] luther methodist baptist pentecostal now
[33:03] it's message
[33:05] a lot of them do not message churches
[33:06] are denominations
[33:08] and she don't be just becomes like her
[33:10] mother natural look at this worldly
[33:12] denominational opposing the spiritual
[33:14] bride the word
[33:16] i like that brother makes it look like
[33:18] the bride is the word well she is the
[33:19] word she's the manifestation of the word
[33:21] amen
[33:22] hallelujah now i just want to just
[33:24] review these briefly
[33:27] the bible says we get all the doctrine
[33:30] of christ and no other doctrine of
[33:32] christ
[33:34] does everybody hear that
[33:36] you get all the doctrine of christ and
[33:39] no other doctrine
[33:41] now there's going to be errors where
[33:42] we'll say well we don't know about this
[33:43] like we're talking about we don't know
[33:45] about this i don't know about you know i
[33:46] can't say thus saith the lord on this
[33:48] you know but in other words we get all
[33:50] the doctrine that pertains to life and
[33:52] godliness there it is amen
[33:54] in other words all godly living
[33:56] we have all the doctrine for godly
[33:58] living hallelujah
[33:59] now here's i'm just going to just go
[34:01] through these quickly jesus said the
[34:02] holy ghost shall teach you some things
[34:04] no he's going to give you doctrine on
[34:06] all things
[34:08] the holy ghost
[34:10] and he's going to guide you or lead you
[34:12] here's the area of your life you need to
[34:13] learn how to do this oh hallelujah he's
[34:15] going to guide us you ever had a guide
[34:16] before they walk you to places that's
[34:19] what the holy ghost is he walks through
[34:20] this area of life and said you need to
[34:21] learn how to do better in this area of
[34:23] your life
[34:24] now you got a choice you're going to
[34:25] follow the guide you're going to let
[34:26] them you're going to follow them or just
[34:27] let them walk on and say well i'm saying
[34:28] here i'm not i can't learn nothing i
[34:30] don't want to learn that
[34:31] you've got to be led we got to be led by
[34:33] the holy spirit we're the sons of god
[34:35] we're the daughters of god if we're led
[34:37] by the holy spirit guided into more
[34:39] truth
[34:44] these are promises this is this is the
[34:46] evidence of the baptism of the holy
[34:48] ghost
[34:49] so for me i can learn to be a better
[34:50] preacher
[34:52] more humble i can learn to be a better
[34:54] father to my children
[34:56] i can learn to be a better pastor amen
[34:57] to the saints
[34:59] i can learn to be a better husband to my
[35:01] wife
[35:02] i can learn that when the holy ghost
[35:04] guides me to that i can be taught how to
[35:06] do better
[35:07] like here's one i just recently learned
[35:09] my wife and i had to talk one time and
[35:11] and uh
[35:13] so i actually did it this morning
[35:15] i said honey how can i help you on
[35:16] sunday morning it's a pressure pack
[35:18] morning getting eight kids ready to
[35:19] leave by 8 50 a.m
[35:22] i said how can i help and she said well
[35:24] could you get zion dress why i got him
[35:26] dressed this morning
[35:28] that's something i can learn i can learn
[35:30] to help out my family
[35:32] or or i could be you know no it's going
[35:34] to be my way or the highway fear me i'm
[35:37] the husband you know
[35:38] i'm the pastor fear me
[35:41] you see
[35:42] it's just simple errors like this can we
[35:44] learn to do better can we learn how to
[35:46] serve others amen we're not let me
[35:48] remind you church let me remind myself
[35:50] you're not here to be served you are
[35:52] here to serve others amen
[35:55] i don't know
[35:56] america wants to sit down like we like
[35:58] sitting on a table come serve me
[35:59] waitress that's not christianity at all
[36:02] that's not christianity you are the
[36:03] waiters amen you're the waitresses amen
[36:06] we're to serve others praise god
[36:09] jesus said the greatest among you is the
[36:12] servant
[36:13] so i look out at our church i say who's
[36:15] the servant that's where we all should
[36:16] be
[36:17] you can have a church of all servants
[36:19] everybody just stays in their place
[36:21] serving the lord and trying to serve
[36:22] other people
[36:24] they had they had on the day of
[36:26] pentecost church
[36:27] if they had it then we're going to have
[36:28] it too because god is bringing us back
[36:30] to the pentecost amen the fullness of
[36:33] pentecost will be in the bride that's
[36:35] thus saith joel 2
[36:37] 23-26 amen
[36:39] that's thus saith the lord
[36:41] not for me but from the prophet of god
[36:45] you have to learn how to serve each
[36:46] other
[36:48] and don't feel bad if somebody don't
[36:49] learn yet have patience with them
[36:52] have patience pray for them brother
[36:54] austin you have a question buddy
[36:56] many ways uh i got in my book it's
[36:58] chapter 11 in my book
[37:00] there's many ways uh
[37:03] people in the bible help with clothing
[37:06] food prayer
[37:09] teaching fellowship encouragement like
[37:12] there was men that came and visited paul
[37:13] and he said you refreshed me
[37:17] so but to do that you have to sacrifice
[37:19] some of your time
[37:21] so it's it's always so simple god is so
[37:23] simple so you just look and you you have
[37:25] to like but also you got to listen to
[37:26] people in the church you know how they
[37:28] doing and ask them questions and that
[37:29] will show you how you can help them like
[37:32] i always try to listen like who needs
[37:33] money because i can help them out i got
[37:34] all this ties sitting here it's not a
[37:36] lot but i got a little bit extra i can i
[37:38] can help people out
[37:39] i just try to listen well how can i who
[37:41] needs it you know who can
[37:42] now people are so humble here they don't
[37:44] ask for help all the time which is okay
[37:46] that's how i am too you know i don't
[37:47] think i've ever asked any of you for a
[37:48] penny and i'll probably not go unless i
[37:50] lose my job or
[37:52] something like that you know
[37:54] and even then i have a hard time doing
[37:55] that
[37:56] but
[37:57] the idea is
[37:59] you look and look for needs in this
[38:01] congregation
[38:03] you know look for needs and how could i
[38:04] help
[38:05] uh now trustees will they've been voted
[38:08] to take care of this so you can look
[38:10] outside this because you're not a
[38:11] trustee uh look outside that and then
[38:13] look to the homes of the people look to
[38:14] the lives of the people how can i be a
[38:15] help to them does that help
[38:17] so we have to do it you know we have to
[38:18] realize we got seven days a week we got
[38:20] jobs first second shift i hardly see
[38:21] these guys you know
[38:23] i already see but how can we do it on a
[38:25] saturday or after our work or something
[38:27] like that we have to look for ways to
[38:29] serve other people
[38:30] okay does that help
[38:33] the greatest look at the life of jesus
[38:34] he just served everybody all the time
[38:36] you know he let the little children come
[38:38] sit on his lap and talk about the
[38:40] kingdom of god
[38:41] you know he would heal people he'd pray
[38:42] for people he'd sit and teach him all
[38:44] day right he'd teach them in the
[38:45] synagogue he teach them on the mount of
[38:46] olives he was just there helping the
[38:48] people
[38:49] praise god good good good question
[38:52] so it's all doctrine and no other
[38:55] paul says though we so he puts himself
[38:57] in there if paul or an angel preached
[38:59] any other gospel than you to you than
[39:01] what you've already preached let him be
[39:02] cursed
[39:04] so there's a curse for changing the
[39:06] doctrine of jesus christ
[39:08] amen
[39:09] as we said before so say i now again if
[39:11] any man preach any other gospel unto you
[39:13] than that you have received let him be
[39:15] accursed
[39:16] and this don't always represent like
[39:17] cursings like demon possession or
[39:19] something like that like that kind of a
[39:21] curse it can be other simple curses upon
[39:24] people's lives like it could be with
[39:26] their finances they could be cursing
[39:27] their finances they could be cursed in
[39:29] their health right just a constant
[39:31] struggle they could be cursed in their
[39:32] families they could be cursed uh with
[39:34] addictions there's all remember that's
[39:36] the deuteronomy 28 it goes through all
[39:37] the curses i've preached on that we have
[39:39] to revisit it but it looks like all
[39:40] these cursings you're going to have can
[39:42] be in your own body right it could be
[39:43] hemorrhoids you know it could be all
[39:44] kinds of things
[39:46] it could be lack of sleep and sleep
[39:47] deprivate deprivation we've talked about
[39:49] that could be that
[39:51] there's lots of different ways the forms
[39:52] the curse comes into
[39:55] it could be spiritual blindness it could
[39:56] be spiritual blindness and taking the
[39:58] mark of the beast
[39:59] that could be a curse
[40:01] it could be dying early because of
[40:03] disobedience
[40:05] right
[40:06] there's many forms the curse comes into
[40:08] but remember this god is rich in mercy
[40:11] he gives warning after warning after
[40:13] warning after warning and when he gets
[40:15] to the spot he
[40:17] god knows they're not going to repent
[40:18] then he sends a curse on their lives
[40:21] and in paul's day it was dead death many
[40:23] of the people in the corinthian church
[40:25] brother died because they didn't treat
[40:27] other people in the church right he says
[40:29] many are sick and weakly among you
[40:31] because they don't discern the lord's
[40:32] body they don't treat the saints the
[40:34] right way
[40:35] so they're under a curse
[40:37] praise god
[40:40] paul says i beseech you and them at
[40:42] ephesus
[40:46] and i charge you preach no other
[40:48] doctrine
[40:50] so see we got one doctrine we got all
[40:52] the doctrine and there's no other
[40:53] doctrine amen
[40:55] he said don't give heed to fables and i
[40:57] look endless sometimes we get like these
[40:59] questions that you'll never get to the
[41:00] end right
[41:01] it just didn't go on and on i can't
[41:03] answer this and so like like to me like
[41:05] that's the flat earth but i enjoy
[41:06] talking about don't get around but to me
[41:07] like how am i ever going to get to the
[41:08] end of this i don't know
[41:10] you know how about how am i ever gonna
[41:12] i'd have to get in a ship and fly up in
[41:13] the air
[41:14] how am i gonna do that
[41:16] so to me like if i if i for me if i
[41:19] studied on that endlessly i'd like i i
[41:21] would never come to the end
[41:23] right
[41:25] and if we're not careful you know
[41:26] conspiracy theories like this or
[41:28] remember when
[41:29] everybody thought obama was the
[41:30] antichrist you remember that brother
[41:33] and they're like oh this the rapture is
[41:34] going to be in obama's presidency and
[41:36] then trump pence you know all the
[41:38] trumpets are going to blow in trump's
[41:39] presidency i mean it's just all this
[41:40] stuff you know
[41:41] they're just trying to distract it's
[41:43] endless step like
[41:44] you're never going to get to the end of
[41:46] this you can't really prove that because
[41:47] you have no thus saith the lord
[41:50] yeah obama act like the antichrist but
[41:52] the pope act like him more
[41:55] he acts more like the antichrist
[41:58] so see that's why we got to get down to
[41:59] doctrine in other words what do i need
[42:01] to do now praise god what can i know
[42:03] right now what can i understand right
[42:05] now what can i do and nail down right
[42:07] now and know that i'm doing god's will
[42:10] and god is pleased with me that's
[42:11] doctrine amen
[42:13] but not these endless fables and
[42:15] genealogies and all this kind of stuff
[42:18] now there are right questions and i
[42:20] can't wait brother bang to find out the
[42:21] answer was i right all these years or
[42:22] was i wrong
[42:23] about the earth
[42:25] because the bible makes it sound like
[42:26] it's flat you know but there's verses
[42:28] that make it sound like it's round but
[42:29] it's something we talk about like we can
[42:31] laugh about
[42:32] and one day we'll get the answer that's
[42:34] for sure how did joshua make the sun
[42:35] stand still how in the world do you make
[42:37] how do you do that well he had to make
[42:39] the earth stand still if the earth is
[42:40] rotating well is the earth
[42:42] rotating all the i mean it's endless i
[42:45] don't all i can say is what the bible
[42:47] says amen
[42:48] right like paul like paul's testimony
[42:50] did they hear the voice or did they not
[42:52] hear the voice there's a big debate on
[42:53] that
[42:54] i shared a debate with you last week was
[42:56] it 430 years israel was in egypt or 400.
[42:59] there's a debate on that nobody can
[43:01] really appear even the uh even the study
[43:03] scholars can't prove it there's just
[43:05] questions that god is going to leave
[43:06] unanswered so we got to be humble not to
[43:08] go down endless gender gene analogies
[43:10] fables think in other words don't focus
[43:12] on things we can't understand focus on
[43:14] the things we can't understand
[43:17] like marriage
[43:19] or food or man-made creeds right that's
[43:22] what we can understand
[43:24] and if i'm wrong god help me i'm just
[43:25] trying to you know give you some
[43:26] examples
[43:28] endless genealogies
[43:31] no no look what do they minister to
[43:33] people they just make people have more
[43:34] questions rather than focusing on the
[43:36] doctrine
[43:37] the things you can't understand so
[43:39] listen it's okay to have questions but
[43:40] that can be a deception of the devil too
[43:42] with too many questions
[43:44] in other words all those how many people
[43:45] feel like you have lots of questions all
[43:46] the time well you have to learn to shut
[43:48] down your mind at some point
[43:51] you gotta say lord
[43:52] give me the anointing of power
[43:53] hallelujah love and a sound mind
[43:57] there's some people that they don't have
[43:58] questions their mind must be a little
[44:00] slower
[44:01] which is okay you know god has a variety
[44:04] some people they just can never shut off
[44:05] the questions what about this what about
[44:06] that what about that what about well
[44:07] pretty soon
[44:09] if you don't bring that under subjection
[44:10] if you don't bring that that that uh
[44:13] part of your character under the
[44:14] character of christ you're gonna be
[44:15] going after
[44:17] endless things endless
[44:20] like there's so many websites now you
[44:21] can spend all your time
[44:23] and there's no end to websites
[44:26] there's no end to youtube or rumble
[44:27] videos i mean they just keep going
[44:29] when are you ever going to be satisfied
[44:31] you're not going to be in your human
[44:33] sense you have to ask the holy spirit
[44:34] give me grace and understanding to focus
[44:37] on what's most important amen i got 80 i
[44:39] got 70 years on this world make god help
[44:42] me to make the most of it amen
[44:44] like the bible said apply our hearts to
[44:47] wisdom
[44:49] that god would teach us to number our
[44:51] days amen i got one shot to make a
[44:53] rapture amen and i'm going to spend my
[44:55] time on what i know is right because i
[44:57] know if i live the doctrine i know the
[44:59] doctrine of the rapture will be
[45:00] fulfilled in me
[45:02] oh amen if i live the doctrine i know
[45:06] i'll be ready for the doctrine of the
[45:07] rapture
[45:08] glory
[45:11] so see it's okay that was wendy's you
[45:13] know this is a funny testament about
[45:14] sister wendy she's that kind of person
[45:15] where she has all kinds of questions and
[45:17] brother she would tell i think she told
[45:18] her testimony a few years ago she had
[45:20] just so many questions for brother
[45:21] brooks and brother craig she just wore
[45:22] them out
[45:23] she's like he's like we don't have all
[45:25] the answers sister
[45:27] and she had to learn to bring that
[45:29] question asking under
[45:30] subjection praise god
[45:33] so see i mean it's it's different
[45:35] personalities right she's just a very
[45:36] inquisitive person
[45:38] right other people could care less
[45:40] now the the danger on that side is just
[45:42] believe everything on the tops we need
[45:44] the leadership of the holy sermon of the
[45:46] holy spirit
[45:48] to judge between what is the holy spirit
[45:50] what is not the holy spirit and help me
[45:51] to follow the holy spirit
[45:53] amen
[45:55] now see all doctrine and
[45:57] no other doctrine
[45:58] whoever abides or continues in the
[46:00] doctrine of christ you have the
[46:02] invisible father and the son
[46:05] but if you transgress it like judas and
[46:07] you don't if you don't live in the
[46:08] doctrine of christ you're not born again
[46:11] that's why doctrine gets really serious
[46:13] what do you teach about the holy ghost
[46:14] what do you teach about
[46:16] the godhead
[46:17] what do you teach about alcohol that's
[46:19] really important
[46:21] what do you teach about
[46:23] i mean you just name the doctrines i'm
[46:24] going to name some here a little bit
[46:26] it's very important because if you don't
[46:29] if you can't be taught by the holy ghost
[46:30] you don't have the holy ghost
[46:35] if there come any under you and bring
[46:36] not this doctrine
[46:38] receive him not into your house neither
[46:40] been in god's speed don't let the
[46:42] jehovah's witnesses don't let the
[46:43] mormons in your house i only let them in
[46:45] one time and they left and they
[46:47] left without answering me and they never
[46:49] came back
[46:51] yeah they weren't ready for me but it
[46:53] was the holy ghost it wasn't me i'm not
[46:55] exhausted myself but they weren't ready
[46:56] for the holy ghost
[46:58] and they said they'd give back to me and
[46:59] they didn't
[47:00] and i told them i sat across that table
[47:02] in chicago falls i said if you love me
[47:03] you'll answer my question well guess
[47:05] what they don't love me
[47:06] that's why because they don't have the
[47:07] love of christ
[47:09] and that goes to all these men or all
[47:11] these people that you know criticized me
[47:12] or whatever or whatever more if you love
[47:14] me you come correct me with love and you
[47:16] wouldn't do it publicly trying to shame
[47:18] me
[47:19] you'd do it privately in love
[47:22] this week brother i had a very prominent
[47:24] preacher come up against me
[47:26] on my video about ministers marriage
[47:27] requirements he's probably the most
[47:29] famous
[47:29] evangelist right now in the message
[47:32] he threw out three comments and they're
[47:33] all quotes from brother branham
[47:36] and he didn't try to give any scripture
[47:38] now look at this that can everybody see
[47:39] this
[47:40] there's no scripture saying where i'm
[47:42] wrong he couldn't find any scripture and
[47:44] brother brahm said the holy ghost will
[47:46] always point you to the tapes though he
[47:48] said the holy ghost will only point you
[47:49] to the scripture
[47:51] i didn't tell you see what they want a
[47:53] quote war
[47:54] instead of a real sincere open look at
[47:57] the mirror of the holy scriptures amen
[47:59] that's what they want they want to quote
[48:01] war
[48:05] and i said i try to say dear brother
[48:07] with all the love in my heart
[48:08] i try to be real kind
[48:10] i said you're just bringing quotes
[48:11] you're not bringing the word of god what
[48:13] about all these other quotes
[48:14] and then this last quote you know i laid
[48:16] it out i'm not gonna i'm not gonna read
[48:18] it to you but on my on this last quote
[48:21] he said i'm one of those who stand with
[48:22] brother branham
[48:25] and i thought well look how prideful
[48:26] that is he don't give any bible answers
[48:29] he's point and he's exalting himself and
[48:31] that's the big i think sister naomi and
[48:33] beatrice would agree with me the biggest
[48:35] sin amongst message people is pride
[48:39] they think they know it all they can't
[48:41] be taught anything
[48:43] right
[48:44] pride puffs puffs up well i'll split the
[48:47] church and i'll do this you know all
[48:48] that all that pride they might be living
[48:50] holy they might not have adultery they
[48:52] might have not fornication they might
[48:53] not have lust of that they might have
[48:54] not rich things but they've got their
[48:56] pride
[48:57] and they can't be taught nothing they
[48:59] know all about it
[49:01] and i was just so shocked
[49:03] and i wasn't surprised though but i was
[49:04] shocked that a prominent minister would
[49:06] try to rebuke me with quotes well i said
[49:08] well what about the quotes that you're
[49:09] forgetting about over here where brother
[49:11] brown does say it's okay
[49:13] what about
[49:14] those and he used the same quote that
[49:17] voice of god uses there's a quote when
[49:19] roller ram says so i say in the name of
[49:21] jesus christ he says don't you add to
[49:23] those tapes brother is not talking about
[49:24] worshiping every word on the tape
[49:26] he said he said he was saying it like
[49:28] moses moses said i call heaven earth to
[49:30] witness against you of the commands that
[49:33] i've spoken unto you there it is amen so
[49:35] the bible commands on the tapes yes we
[49:38] must honor those in other words when the
[49:40] tapes point us back to the bible yes
[49:42] don't add to the word don't take away
[49:44] from the word but they're the message
[49:46] side that's falling away they're
[49:47] exalting every word on the tape and they
[49:49] don't even know it that's because
[49:50] they're blind to the word but we've got
[49:52] eyes that we can see amen
[49:55] i thought that was so strange a
[49:57] five-fold preacher using the same quote
[50:00] joseph branham uses to justify his
[50:02] worship of the tape and i said that's
[50:03] exactly and his wife put a post years
[50:05] ago on facebook and i screenshot it i
[50:07] still got it on my phone today and she
[50:09] said uh don't don't question anything in
[50:11] the message just believe all the message
[50:14] so see
[50:14] the most famous evangelists today
[50:16] probably
[50:18] their family and their their marriage
[50:19] has the spirit of idolatry worshiping
[50:21] the tapes
[50:23] but they're so accepted all over and you
[50:25] know some of our beliefs might not be
[50:26] but that's okay as long as i got bible
[50:28] for mine i'm happy praise god
[50:33] you want to see that i'll show it to you
[50:35] praise god now i didn't mean to say that
[50:37] but
[50:41] now let's finally get this after all
[50:43] those minutes here we go now i can only
[50:44] get to the i had to lay that groundwork
[50:46] everybody okay with that i delayed that
[50:47] groundwork so you could see now as we
[50:49] look at doctrines of devils see how the
[50:50] devil brings these in
[50:52] all right in the end times now i just
[50:55] want to show this to austelina uh
[50:57] there's something called a lexicon and
[50:59] that has all the meanings of the hebrew
[51:01] words from the bible now the lexicon is
[51:03] not perfect
[51:05] like i clicked on devil yesterday you
[51:06] see what doctrines of devils devil means
[51:08] the ones it can mean so it means like a
[51:11] spirit too it means like the one supreme
[51:13] being like almighty god
[51:15] because they used like spirit can mean
[51:17] devil or devil's a spirit
[51:19] so see the lexicon isn't always right
[51:21] lexicon also says god's a trinity of
[51:22] persons and that
[51:24] so see you got to be careful with
[51:25] lexicon too
[51:27] but it does give many helpful
[51:29] definitions right
[51:30] original meanings from the the aramaic
[51:33] or the greek or the hebrew so i just
[51:35] want to show the word depart here
[51:36] brother austin and lena it means to draw
[51:38] away to fall away and you've got to have
[51:40] to sift through these to see which one
[51:42] fits the context of the revelation of
[51:44] the scripture
[51:45] it means to withdraw to remove to excite
[51:48] to revolt against the truth so when the
[51:50] bible says some will revolt or deport
[51:53] depart from the faith they'll revolt
[51:54] against the truth they won't want the
[51:55] truth anymore they'll stand off they'll
[51:57] go away they'll depart from anyone
[51:59] they'll desert
[52:01] or withdraw from the faith
[52:04] so the bible says they're gonna depart
[52:06] or withdraw or fight against the faith
[52:10] why
[52:11] because they gave heed to a seducing
[52:13] demon
[52:15] seducing means deceptive demon i'll tell
[52:17] you church it's get it's getting more
[52:19] and more close
[52:21] i listened to a sermon yesterday for one
[52:22] of those guys doing their impartation he
[52:24] preached so much truth but then that
[52:26] manifestation i i caught a couple of
[52:28] lies in there he said oh if you just do
[52:29] it this way you're going to churches
[52:30] grow bigger and bigger and bigger that's
[52:31] the opposite of jesus
[52:33] that's the opposite of saint paul
[52:35] who got smaller and smaller and smaller
[52:38] and fewer and fewer and fewer as they
[52:39] went along
[52:40] so you can always catch there was so
[52:41] much truth in there so much truth what
[52:43] he was saying but then there's little
[52:44] lies in there see it's getting so close
[52:46] to see the very elected if it were
[52:47] possible but it will not deceive us
[52:50] because we pray we got the holy ghost we
[52:52] fast amen we believe the word of god we
[52:54] preach the truth we're humble we can be
[52:55] corrected by the holy spirit
[53:00] now here's breaking it down so what do
[53:02] they do they turn they hold on to they
[53:04] get addicted to they give heed to a
[53:07] misleading an imposter
[53:10] teaching from a devil
[53:13] they the devil get preaches something
[53:15] about they teach them to do something
[53:17] and they grab a hold on that and they
[53:18] won't let it go
[53:20] this is how doctrines of demons get into
[53:22] the churches
[53:25] they but they first have to let go of
[53:27] the truth in order to grab the lie
[53:30] and they hold on to that they get
[53:31] addicted to that
[53:32] in church these are two examples from
[53:34] the early church
[53:36] two examples from the early church
[53:39] can you imagine
[53:40] i
[53:41] i'll try to explain it here by god's
[53:42] grace
[53:45] remember the holy ghost said people
[53:46] would depart from the faith in the
[53:47] latter or end times this means that
[53:49] people were in the faith once but
[53:51] decided to abandon the faith
[53:54] jesus said people can fall away or can
[53:56] believe for a while
[53:57] before rejecting their belief because
[54:00] fall away means you depart how we know
[54:01] that i don't know all these people say
[54:03] once saved always say have they read
[54:04] their bible lately
[54:06] jesus said you can believe for a while
[54:09] but then fall away from it
[54:14] you can actually have the anointing of
[54:15] the holy spirit for a while but then
[54:17] later reject that anointing and depart
[54:19] and leave christianity
[54:21] but if you're born again you'll never
[54:22] leave amen i'll say this and if you're a
[54:24] real faithful faithful foolish virgin
[54:26] you'll never leave either
[54:28] because they get saved too they get
[54:29] saved too
[54:31] but they just never get the wisdom of
[54:33] god
[54:34] to redeem the time
[54:37] see jesus christ said you can believe
[54:39] for a while
[54:40] but then fall away depart revolt against
[54:43] the faith
[54:46] yes yes yes
[54:48] yes sir wow that's that's very humble
[54:49] brother very humble
[54:52] i would say i did too brother because
[54:53] when i i told in my testimony i was
[54:55] trying to serve god
[54:56] until fifth grade and then i heard amy
[54:58] grant she crossed over into the world
[55:00] and that spirit of seduction just took
[55:02] me away and i was trying to get
[55:03] girlfriends in fifth grade brother van
[55:04] i'm trying to get girlfriends
[55:06] i was
[55:07] sixth grade that that's the spirit of
[55:09] lust
[55:10] he was trying to take me down the wrong
[55:11] road but thank god for the protection of
[55:13] the holy spirit
[55:15] brother i say we all you know we've all
[55:17] probably done this sometime time
[55:19] in our very young life not now you know
[55:21] but in our young life we all we all fall
[55:24] short of god's glory now though every
[55:26] day
[55:26] every day we fall short some some area
[55:28] of our lives good question great
[55:29] question
[55:32] just as a person can give
[55:34] or easily receive god's gifts like faith
[55:37] you can all
[55:41] say about to don't throw away your
[55:43] confidence confidence is an anointing
[55:45] amen may god give us the anointing amen
[55:47] for the rapture how many want to be
[55:49] confident that you'll go in the rapture
[55:50] amen that's an anointing amen don't
[55:53] throw that away if god brings you don't
[55:54] throw it away don't look at anything
[55:56] else just look at the word amen
[55:58] hallelujah
[56:00] see that's why some days people give me
[56:02] up i'm going to rapture the next day
[56:03] they're like oh man they cast it away
[56:07] they had the anointing when they let
[56:08] something deceive them
[56:10] in that case if they're depressed it's a
[56:12] spirit of heaviness the bible calls it
[56:16] they let this demon depression come upon
[56:18] them and whisper in their ear and pretty
[56:20] soon they get anointed with that
[56:21] depression and now i don't have any
[56:22] confidence for the rapture i'm a failure
[56:24] well of course you are that's why you
[56:25] need a savior
[56:27] and that's why you need this grace every
[56:28] day praise god brother man said i'm
[56:30] always a failure amen he said there's
[56:32] only one that's not a failure and that's
[56:34] the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah
[56:38] look at it after the seals i'm always a
[56:40] failure glory
[56:43] none of us uh none of us will ever be
[56:46] perfect amen but we're all pointing to
[56:48] the perfect one amen
[56:50] glory
[56:53] now the just shall live by faith not
[56:55] feelings and the church said
[56:58] you're gonna have feelings brother
[57:00] i've had a woman come up to me last two
[57:02] years ago she'd been serving god 50
[57:04] years brother she came up and said i
[57:05] don't even feel like i'm saved
[57:07] well i said check your life at some
[57:08] point you must have
[57:10] got a complex and i think that's what it
[57:12] was she didn't tell me but she was
[57:13] weeping and crying
[57:14] and she got he's sick and god did
[57:16] america in her life i mean it's amazing
[57:17] so she's back in the house of god today
[57:19] and beautiful testimony
[57:22] but that's why we don't live by feelings
[57:24] because god may take his god may take
[57:27] his hedge from over you like job and you
[57:29] won't feel nothing
[57:31] you'll feel nothing supernatural
[57:34] like you let brother amen get sick right
[57:35] he cried out but amen that's a good
[57:37] example that's sisterhood
[57:39] god let them get sick and they don't
[57:40] feel nothing they pray they pray they
[57:42] sing gratitude and they say oh they
[57:44] don't feel nothing
[57:46] but they know there's faith in a prayer
[57:47] cloth amen
[57:48] they know the gospel is right amen
[57:51] they just hang there just stay with god
[57:53] even though you don't feel it they chose
[57:54] not to live by sight they live by faith
[57:57] amen
[57:58] hallelujah
[58:00] and they didn't cast away their
[58:01] confidence in christ amen
[58:03] look where they are today they're in the
[58:04] house of god
[58:06] a good example
[58:08] but see we're tempted to what draw back
[58:12] and the bible says if you draw back if
[58:13] you leave the faith god has no pleasure
[58:15] in you
[58:17] but we are not amen our church is not of
[58:20] those drawer backers
[58:22] we're of the followers honors we're the
[58:24] keeper honors amen we're the rugged
[58:26] soldiers that keep their confidence we
[58:28] keep moving on with jesus christ
[58:31] amen
[58:34] we believe unto what the saving of the
[58:36] soul
[58:38] until the soul gets a new body
[58:41] a new body to live in amen a glorified
[58:43] body or if the rapture be glorified in
[58:45] theophany
[58:48] we keep believing
[58:50] to the saving to the end that our soul
[58:52] gets a new body a glorified body
[58:59] did you know faith can be thrown away
[59:01] faith can also also be stomped upon
[59:06] so i just showed you throw away throw in
[59:07] your confidence what is confidence just
[59:08] faith in the word
[59:09] right so you can throw away people can
[59:12] throw away their faith they can also
[59:14] stomp and smash on the blood of jesus
[59:17] christ the bible says it and it gets a
[59:19] sore punishment when you stomp on it and
[59:21] you curse against it and you speak
[59:23] against it blast him against it it's a
[59:25] sore punishment it for those who have
[59:27] trod and underfoot the son of god that
[59:28] means to tread down to trample on they
[59:31] look they're rude to preachers my
[59:33] they're read they're rude to you
[59:37] because you're a representative of jesus
[59:39] christ on this earth
[59:42] when they speak evil you're the rude
[59:43] that's why you better pray for those
[59:44] that persecute you pray for them
[59:48] pray for them who despitefully use you
[59:52] when they insult you that's trampling
[59:54] down
[59:55] the message that you're bringing you're
[59:57] bringing the message of jesus christ
[1:00:00] insulting they treat you with insulting
[1:00:03] neglect see they should come to church
[1:00:05] they should listen to you but they
[1:00:06] neglect it
[1:00:08] the bible said there's sore punishment
[1:00:09] for them
[1:00:11] see because what they're living the
[1:00:12] opposite they're living despite they're
[1:00:14] living against the spirit of grace how
[1:00:16] many living by grace today
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:19] grace and peace be unto you amen we saw
[1:00:21] that last sunday amen
[1:00:23] god's favor upon you
[1:00:25] and may his peace be upon you but they
[1:00:27] don't want god's grace they don't want
[1:00:29] god's gifts they'd rather have the love
[1:00:31] of the world
[1:00:32] they'd rather have doctrines of devils
[1:00:36] pretty stern message today by
[1:00:39] god
[1:00:40] the great side
[1:00:41] i knew studying yesterday this is gonna
[1:00:42] be a good sermon
[1:00:43] i feel it
[1:00:45] i start feeling that anointing come
[1:00:46] around here and oh my it's gonna be a
[1:00:47] good one god help me now finishing that
[1:00:49] verse for every creature of god is good
[1:00:52] and nothing to be refused if it be
[1:00:53] received with thanksgiving for it is
[1:00:54] sanctified by the word of god in prayer
[1:00:56] if thou put the brethren now he's
[1:00:59] talking to timothy in remembrance of
[1:01:00] these things thou shalt be a good
[1:01:02] minister of jesus christ nourish up in
[1:01:04] the words of faith and of
[1:01:06] good doctrine
[1:01:08] whereunto thou hast attained
[1:01:13] now search somewhere i want to before i
[1:01:14] get into this i i had more about the
[1:01:16] marriage and the food
[1:01:22] so i'm skipping down here
[1:01:25] oh yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm gonna skip
[1:01:26] past this
[1:01:28] oh man i gotta skip this
[1:01:31] i got some good illustrations i hope
[1:01:32] it'll help austin lina and faith but let
[1:01:34] me skip down here
[1:01:36] yeah so i'm going to bring this through
[1:01:38] here's the attributes of doctrines of
[1:01:39] devils i'll try to go quickly through
[1:01:41] here
[1:01:43] so what do these lying preachers do they
[1:01:45] impersonate the truth
[1:01:48] and they teach demonic desires
[1:01:50] because the holy ghost does not desire
[1:01:52] these lies
[1:01:54] and what do they do they lie as
[1:01:56] hypocrites they do not practice what
[1:01:58] they preach
[1:02:03] so watch a preacher watch my life if i
[1:02:05] don't live what i preach then you come
[1:02:06] talk to me
[1:02:07] because i'm doing everything i can to
[1:02:08] live what i preach
[1:02:10] that's why i lay at the altar that's why
[1:02:11] i lay in my closet that's why i humble
[1:02:13] myself and repent every day because i'm
[1:02:15] trying to live what i preach
[1:02:20] and their consciences their right and
[1:02:22] wrong morality of right and wrong it's
[1:02:25] burned and it's branded and allows them
[1:02:27] to lie
[1:02:28] they've got so used to lying like our
[1:02:30] current administration the white house
[1:02:31] they get so used to lying they can lie
[1:02:33] at a drop of a hat
[1:02:36] even when caught in a lie they'll make
[1:02:38] another lie to protect their lie
[1:02:41] now of course every administration has
[1:02:42] liars i'm not i'm just saying it's so
[1:02:43] obvious now that
[1:02:46] so obvious
[1:02:49] now this is preachers
[1:02:51] preachers will lie
[1:02:53] from the pulpit
[1:02:54] and give people doctrines of devils
[1:02:57] so here's the two examples
[1:02:59] these are clear
[1:03:01] doctrines of devils
[1:03:05] now this is a scripture read god created
[1:03:07] both of these acts marriage and meat
[1:03:09] eating to be a blessing but satan turned
[1:03:10] them into sin
[1:03:13] and these are examples of catholic
[1:03:15] legalism
[1:03:18] and they say and they still to this day
[1:03:20] mandate
[1:03:21] catholic priests cannot marry
[1:03:24] and they don't eat meat around easter
[1:03:26] time it's a command
[1:03:28] if you don't do it you're not a good
[1:03:29] catholic
[1:03:30] and did you know church before i move on
[1:03:32] the catholics said at the council of
[1:03:34] trump that any protestant who doesn't
[1:03:36] accept catholic doctrine is accursed and
[1:03:39] they've never repented of it so don't
[1:03:41] believe all this that the catholic
[1:03:42] church and the lutheran are back
[1:03:43] together i showed that video that's a
[1:03:45] lie from hell
[1:03:47] when those councils meet together they
[1:03:48] have the authority of the pope those
[1:03:50] things never change so see those
[1:03:51] catholic priests they lie and say we've
[1:03:53] got unity they're lying amen
[1:03:55] they just lie right through their teeth
[1:03:56] they're liars like devils
[1:03:59] like serpents amen
[1:04:00] he's the father of lies amen
[1:04:03] so every catholic that's honest today
[1:04:05] and knows history knows that no
[1:04:08] protestant is blessed in the catholic
[1:04:09] mind
[1:04:10] so if they say it they're lying to you
[1:04:12] they don't mean god bless you they mean
[1:04:14] god curse you
[1:04:16] so don't believe them believe the word
[1:04:19] i just gotta lay that in there there so
[1:04:20] you just so you see that stuff sorry
[1:04:22] i'm not sorry sorry not sorry i guess
[1:04:26] i'm not sorry i just don't mean to be so
[1:04:27] rough that's what i'm saying
[1:04:29] they forbid to marry abstain from meats
[1:04:31] notice satan targeted sexuality and food
[1:04:36] it's the same today
[1:04:38] but to me it's the opposite
[1:04:41] to me it's well they were saying
[1:04:42] preachers kept marrying now now the
[1:04:44] church is saying you can marry whoever
[1:04:45] you want
[1:04:47] same devil
[1:04:49] trying to bring a mandated lie upon the
[1:04:52] church and now it's oh you don't have to
[1:04:55] fast
[1:04:57] you can eat whatever you want
[1:04:59] there's no restraint you can drink
[1:05:00] social drinking you can drink wine at
[1:05:02] the you can drink beer at the restaurant
[1:05:04] that's a lie
[1:05:06] see so what it's the same devil
[1:05:10] but just a little different spin on
[1:05:12] their false doctrine and the church said
[1:05:16] because as it was in the days of noah so
[1:05:18] will be in the days of the son of man
[1:05:20] that's what jesus said
[1:05:21] so by the austin elena however it was in
[1:05:23] the days of noah and sodom that's how
[1:05:24] it's going to be at the end time and
[1:05:25] what was it they were just eating and
[1:05:27] drinking marin they weren't even
[1:05:28] concerned about the wrath about the
[1:05:29] destruction
[1:05:30] they weren't concerned about noah and
[1:05:32] getting in the ark they just overeating
[1:05:34] and drinking and all drunkenness you
[1:05:36] know
[1:05:36] marriages all these worldly things
[1:05:40] in other words caught up in the spirit
[1:05:41] of it and of course lot was
[1:05:42] homosexuality they ate bought drinks so
[1:05:44] planted and then fire and brimstone
[1:05:47] reigned the day lot went out of sodom
[1:05:49] even thus shall be in the day when the
[1:05:51] son of man is revealed so that's what
[1:05:52] works we're expecting more of those
[1:05:54] conditions praise god
[1:05:56] and notice paul links meat and sexuality
[1:05:59] together because meat eating of course
[1:06:02] is uh taking the mouth right and the
[1:06:04] bible says the bible likens eating to
[1:06:06] sexuality it's a symbol of sexuality
[1:06:08] right proverbs 30 verse 20 an adulterous
[1:06:11] woman eateth and wipeth her mouth and
[1:06:13] saying i've done no evil
[1:06:15] so eating is a symbolism of sexuality
[1:06:20] and paul connects these in first
[1:06:21] corinthians 6 12.
[1:06:23] meets for the belly belly for the meats
[1:06:25] he said now god is not the body is not
[1:06:28] for fornication but for the lord
[1:06:30] and the lord the body interesting what
[1:06:32] you eat is very connected uh to your
[1:06:35] your sexuality as well whether you're
[1:06:37] abstinent or pure
[1:06:39] right
[1:06:41] and then paul said enemies of the cross
[1:06:43] will
[1:06:44] overeat because their god is their belly
[1:06:49] they worship themselves they worship any
[1:06:52] way they can get more food
[1:06:54] or any way they can get more money they
[1:06:56] worship that that becomes their god
[1:06:59] okay
[1:07:00] now it's all deeper here
[1:07:02] but here i want to bring this in
[1:07:05] should a saved wife in the message or
[1:07:07] christian refuse herself to her husband
[1:07:09] if he's a sinner no sir by the way said
[1:07:11] no sir that's your husband you'll drive
[1:07:12] him farther away from god than ever by
[1:07:14] doing that
[1:07:17] right that's right brother sister you
[1:07:19] married him he's yours you're hit you're
[1:07:21] his
[1:07:22] so the devil at the beginning said
[1:07:24] you're pre you preachers in ephesus
[1:07:26] you're not as spiritually mature if you
[1:07:28] marry a wife and look they could have
[1:07:29] used some of paul's words in first
[1:07:31] corinthians seven
[1:07:32] where paul said if you're married then
[1:07:34] you know you're you care about the
[1:07:35] things of your your wife more than
[1:07:37] things of the lord
[1:07:38] see how this how slick the devil is
[1:07:41] tried to make him feel you're not as
[1:07:43] much of a preacher if you marry
[1:07:45] but then brother branham says there's
[1:07:47] most men right most men that don't have
[1:07:49] the gift of celibacy it's a gift
[1:07:51] most men it will drive you crazy if you
[1:07:53] don't have that outlet in your life for
[1:07:56] the passion god put the passion in there
[1:07:58] right so they can be fruitful and
[1:07:59] multiply
[1:08:01] but look the devil tries to deceive
[1:08:03] these earthly you're not as much of a
[1:08:04] man as paul look at that wow
[1:08:07] the devil said that you'd preach it's
[1:08:08] from these preachers you shouldn't be
[1:08:09] married if you're a real preacher
[1:08:11] because then you can be devoted like
[1:08:12] paul was you're you're a prophet
[1:08:15] but brother brahm says if you forbid
[1:08:16] your husband that sisters you drive him
[1:08:19] further from god so see how see how a
[1:08:21] man is connected with god and his
[1:08:22] sexuality
[1:08:24] see if a man doesn't have that outlet
[1:08:26] he
[1:08:27] he's more attempt to be or he's more
[1:08:28] likely to be tempted away from god
[1:08:31] see how close that is connected church
[1:08:33] that's why our sisters got to be mindful
[1:08:35] of that that's why our brothers got to
[1:08:36] be mindful of their sister's needs too
[1:08:39] praise god
[1:08:40] but the devil said if you're real
[1:08:42] spiritual you wouldn't be married at all
[1:08:46] paul said you devil
[1:08:48] you imagine
[1:08:49] paul reading that i said you bunch i
[1:08:51] wonder who if timothy read that i said
[1:08:52] you bunch of devil preachers
[1:08:55] don't you know a man don't have that
[1:08:56] outlet he's gonna go crazy unless he has
[1:08:58] that gift
[1:08:59] that's why the bible said let every man
[1:09:01] have a wife
[1:09:03] right to avoid what fornication
[1:09:05] in other words a normal man is going to
[1:09:06] sleep around if he because he's got that
[1:09:08] passion in his heart so let him get
[1:09:10] married
[1:09:12] let him get married
[1:09:13] church i'm preaching you doctrines of
[1:09:15] devils today
[1:09:17] a doctrine of the devil you can't marry
[1:09:20] now it's oh you can marry whoever you
[1:09:21] want same devil
[1:09:23] same lie
[1:09:25] but we marry who god leads us to mary
[1:09:26] praise god
[1:09:28] and then we stay faithful to our promise
[1:09:29] we keep our vows
[1:09:32] hallelujah jesus christ said
[1:09:36] oh after jesus you said you know you
[1:09:37] can't divorce for any reason he told his
[1:09:39] disciples you know what they said they
[1:09:40] said who he they said who can receive
[1:09:42] this what kind of man can receive this
[1:09:43] think about that even his own disciples
[1:09:45] so see under sanctification brothers you
[1:09:47] don't have the real revelation of
[1:09:48] marriage and divorce
[1:09:49] that's why these churches out there
[1:09:50] without the holy ghost they'll let
[1:09:52] people marry divorce adultery all these
[1:09:53] things because even jesus own disciples
[1:09:55] are like oh this is harsh can't divorce
[1:09:57] our wives anymore
[1:09:59] of course they didn't
[1:10:01] but when jesus cut off that ability to
[1:10:03] do that
[1:10:05] what happened
[1:10:06] they said who can receive this and jesus
[1:10:08] said all men cannot receive the same
[1:10:11] saving them whom it is given yeah the
[1:10:13] disciples said well maybe none of us
[1:10:14] should marry he said it's only for those
[1:10:16] who it's given to
[1:10:19] he said some men were born from their
[1:10:21] womb never to marry a wife
[1:10:23] he said others were made that way by men
[1:10:26] the teaching of men just convinced them
[1:10:28] never get married
[1:10:29] he said others were made others eunuchs
[1:10:32] decided that because they loved the
[1:10:33] kingdom of god so much
[1:10:36] he said whoever's able to receive it let
[1:10:38] him receive it
[1:10:41] paul said i would that all men now look
[1:10:43] they could use this the the ephesian
[1:10:45] false preachers could say look paul said
[1:10:48] i wish every he wished everybody was
[1:10:50] like him
[1:10:51] and yet those brothers had those
[1:10:52] passions in them and they had to decide
[1:10:54] there and they didn't realize it was a
[1:10:55] devil trying to trick them
[1:10:58] trying to thank god after if they got
[1:11:00] delivered they could get married again
[1:11:01] they got
[1:11:02] thank god for that
[1:11:04] but that was a devil
[1:11:06] trying to deceive them about their
[1:11:08] marriage
[1:11:11] he said i say to the unmarried and
[1:11:12] widows it is good for them if they abide
[1:11:14] even as i
[1:11:15] they could have said see it's good for
[1:11:16] you why can't you be a real man of god
[1:11:18] you preachers and not mary
[1:11:20] that's the devil telling him that
[1:11:23] that's why you gotta have the holy
[1:11:24] spirit and take everything back to the
[1:11:25] word of god
[1:11:27] well you could say well hey preacher
[1:11:28] peter had a wife and he walked on water
[1:11:32] right
[1:11:33] and jesus even healed his mother-in-law
[1:11:35] so what's wrong with preachers having
[1:11:36] wives
[1:11:37] and he even had the keys of the kingdom
[1:11:39] brother
[1:11:41] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:11:45] see
[1:11:46] so unbalanced what are they doing
[1:11:47] they're straining out a net and
[1:11:48] swallowing a camel
[1:11:51] i'm preaching hard today
[1:11:52] help me lord
[1:11:54] see concerning marriage and meat eating
[1:11:56] the devils teach abstinence and yet
[1:11:58] priests rape the victims that shows
[1:12:00] they're hypocrites
[1:12:02] they're lying in hypocrisy
[1:12:05] the nuns do it too
[1:12:07] they rape little girls
[1:12:10] it's all over the news a couple years
[1:12:11] ago it's in my book
[1:12:13] the devils teach absence from meat yet
[1:12:15] they eat fish
[1:12:17] and jesus said anybody got any meat here
[1:12:19] and they hand them a fish
[1:12:21] fish is meat
[1:12:23] and they say if you don't stop eating
[1:12:24] meat you're not observing the reason
[1:12:26] you're good enough you devil
[1:12:29] easter ain't about what i eat naturally
[1:12:31] it's what i eat spiritually
[1:12:33] i didn't praise god amen
[1:12:36] it's about my spiritual diet you devil
[1:12:38] it's not about my natural diet
[1:12:42] paul took time enough church
[1:12:44] to show these people they had doctrines
[1:12:46] of devils and related to their diet and
[1:12:49] their sexuality
[1:12:56] all right uh let's see
[1:13:00] we started started preaching okay so
[1:13:03] uh give me 15 minutes here i'm a set
[1:13:05] timer

[1:13:26] think this will help austin alina you
[1:13:27] know i always want to be mindful and the
[1:13:28] children too so children you guys are
[1:13:30] ready to pay attention your children
[1:13:31] okay i can go over this tonight again if
[1:13:33] you want let me go i made some visuals i
[1:13:34] thought it would be help to you
[1:13:37] yeah just here
[1:13:39] so i just want to understand the
[1:13:40] anointing on the human spirit a little
[1:13:42] more uh we showed this last a couple
[1:13:44] months ago but also i don't know if
[1:13:45] you're here i don't think you were so
[1:13:46] everybody has a soul right but in your
[1:13:48] mind you have these five channels to
[1:13:50] your mind
[1:13:52] the bible says don't give a place in
[1:13:53] your mind to the devil here's what
[1:13:55] happens
[1:13:56] we let old memory come up well i
[1:13:57] remember when brother jesse did that man
[1:13:58] he just i can't believe that
[1:14:00] now every time i think about brother
[1:14:02] jesse i'm upset about brother jesse
[1:14:03] because the devil bring back a bad
[1:14:05] memory well what if brother jesse said
[1:14:07] he's sorry you don't let the devil build
[1:14:08] it back what if brother jesse didn't say
[1:14:10] sorry come talk to me about it
[1:14:12] praise god don't let the devil build up
[1:14:15] a castle to attack me in your mind or
[1:14:18] anybody your mom dad grandma anybody
[1:14:21] right and the holy ghost is to pull down
[1:14:23] those strongholds amen those complexes
[1:14:27] see now here
[1:14:29] um
[1:14:30] i don't know why i put the cigarette
[1:14:31] smoke on there i had a cigarette i don't
[1:14:33] know
[1:14:34] oh i could i think i was showing my life
[1:14:36] you know yeah yeah that's what i was
[1:14:37] showing i'm sorry i forgot to switch
[1:14:38] over no
[1:14:40] no no okay there it is
[1:14:43] i don't know what happened there maybe i
[1:14:44] didn't look at it long enough so i was
[1:14:45] telling by the austin that after i got
[1:14:47] saved i would have i'm sorry before i
[1:14:49] was saved this is what i had i had all
[1:14:50] these evil imaginations
[1:14:52] especially sexual temptations or you
[1:14:54] know desires to go to the pros and the
[1:14:56] football to get rich you know i had all
[1:14:58] the i had all these
[1:15:00] i had all these complexes demon thoughts
[1:15:03] and then what'd that lead to my
[1:15:04] addiction to cigarettes and tobacco and
[1:15:07] drinking alcohol and all kinds of
[1:15:09] right and so the holy ghost comes to
[1:15:11] pull down all those it comes to clear
[1:15:13] out the land amen
[1:15:15] like the holy ghost tell jeremiah he
[1:15:17] said you pull down those strongholds you
[1:15:19] root them up and then you plant the word
[1:15:21] of god there amen hallelujah you clear
[1:15:23] the land start afresh and build
[1:15:25] something that glorifies god amen
[1:15:28] build a life build a thought life build
[1:15:30] a prayer life that honors jesus christ
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:33] build that hallelujah
[1:15:36] you're going to build that in one day as
[1:15:37] you guys know you're going to build that
[1:15:38] one day you got to develop
[1:15:40] habits it takes time
[1:15:43] staining the word keeping your mind on
[1:15:44] the word of god praying more often it
[1:15:46] takes time
[1:15:48] hallelujah
[1:15:50] here's why i want to show here
[1:15:53] let me see if i got any uh
[1:15:55] no i don't okay
[1:15:56] so you have a soul
[1:15:59] and then you here's here's those five
[1:16:01] realms again now like here's what i said
[1:16:03] here many times
[1:16:04] we can be saved in our soul like you if
[1:16:06] you have the holy ghost today you have
[1:16:07] the holy ghost here that yellow
[1:16:08] represents the holy ghost but you can
[1:16:10] also have
[1:16:11] complexes in your mind
[1:16:13] so you can have the holy anointing here
[1:16:15] and i look yours all these other
[1:16:16] anointings of god can be on these but
[1:16:18] you got one memory that's really keep
[1:16:20] holding you back
[1:16:21] that's just like brother branham right
[1:16:23] with uh critical spirits pride
[1:16:27] so in our minds we can have good
[1:16:29] anointing and then the wrong anointing
[1:16:32] right
[1:16:33] now here's another one
[1:16:35] now as you become a christian now i was
[1:16:37] asking a good question about this when
[1:16:39] you get saved you get that anointing of
[1:16:41] faith in your mind right now you got
[1:16:42] faith you got trust in god
[1:16:45] then as you keep going on you get virtue
[1:16:47] where's virtue yeah that's right she
[1:16:49] looks i see i love they smile every time
[1:16:51] they hear their voice you got the nature
[1:16:53] of god there you go
[1:16:55] i love those bible names you know
[1:16:58] you keep going on then you get the
[1:16:59] knowledge of god that's what i was
[1:17:01] saying with uh
[1:17:04] uh
[1:17:06] different people i i don't want to call
[1:17:07] it names there
[1:17:09] but they can have they can all have all
[1:17:10] this public testimony but they can't
[1:17:11] understand that god didn't call women to
[1:17:13] preach they don't have that now they
[1:17:14] don't have that understanding
[1:17:16] they can't understand that tongues are
[1:17:18] not the evidence of the holy ghost you
[1:17:19] know right like at the church brother
[1:17:21] like i'm glad they spoke in tongues but
[1:17:22] pretty soon they're not gonna i mean you
[1:17:24] can't speak in tongues every time you
[1:17:24] have a battle you know
[1:17:26] because god god sends the tongues you
[1:17:28] don't you don't command that's the
[1:17:29] trouble they got they try to command the
[1:17:30] tongues you can't do that
[1:17:32] you can't you don't hold god in your
[1:17:33] pocket like okay well now i'm gonna do a
[1:17:35] gift now no you wait till god gives you
[1:17:37] the gift
[1:17:38] you're waiting say god give me the give
[1:17:40] me the tongue or give me the revelation
[1:17:41] give me the wisdom yes lord okay now i
[1:17:42] got it here you go but it's not like
[1:17:44] well i keep it in my pocket i can use it
[1:17:45] whatever i want that's the lie that
[1:17:46] satan tells them
[1:17:48] and so then they start
[1:17:49] then they start fake speaking in tongues
[1:17:53] just the same as they do fake healings
[1:17:54] and all kinds
[1:17:55] anything you receive it's by grace
[1:17:58] god's grace to you
[1:18:00] but see they can have they can have
[1:18:02] faith in virtue but not knowledge
[1:18:05] right then we get anointed for
[1:18:06] temperance we can control our bodies our
[1:18:08] sexual and other passions of the bodies
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:11] uh then we get patience to wait on the
[1:18:13] lord see god keeps filling your mind
[1:18:14] with all this anointing amen and the
[1:18:17] church said
[1:18:18] then you get broadly kindness am i now
[1:18:21] you're just your mind is all anointed
[1:18:22] with the things of god
[1:18:23] and then after that then you get the
[1:18:25] baptism of the holy ghost praise god
[1:18:28] there's your soul
[1:18:29] and then the fire of god here
[1:18:31] i got one more click to do
[1:18:34] okay no oh yeah then the bible says yeah
[1:18:35] see this is this is the anointing it
[1:18:37] comes add to your faith virtue add the
[1:18:39] anointings
[1:18:41] see you go from glory to glory you
[1:18:43] become a better christian all the time
[1:18:44] you receive more of god's anointing amen
[1:18:47] and then one of these days one of these
[1:18:48] great days the holy ghost fire comes
[1:18:50] into your soul amen jesus said john
[1:18:53] baptized you with water he said but i'm
[1:18:55] coming to baptize you with the holy
[1:18:56] ghost and with fire amen
[1:18:59] hallelujah
[1:19:01] and the pentecostals most times got
[1:19:03] strange fire
[1:19:04] which is a demon fire
[1:19:06] that's right i'm gonna show that to you
[1:19:08] because they they got the wrong doctrine
[1:19:10] they got all this and then they act like
[1:19:11] they're in pain that ain't the holy
[1:19:13] ghost that is not i've never seen that
[1:19:14] that's not the holy ghost yes the holy
[1:19:17] ghost will make you pass out yes the
[1:19:18] holy ghost will make you shake but not
[1:19:20] in pain like a devil does
[1:19:22] because satan comes to torment you satan
[1:19:24] comes to steal kill and destroy
[1:19:27] and the way to know is watch their life
[1:19:29] afterwards
[1:19:31] and all these people have the fruits of
[1:19:33] ecumenicalism one world religion love
[1:19:36] the pope
[1:19:37] okay to divorce and marry and remarry
[1:19:39] okay to fake speaking in tongues it's a
[1:19:40] lie
[1:19:41] they're fruit by their fruits amen jesus
[1:19:43] said by their fruits you'll know them
[1:19:45] thank god that we have good fruit here
[1:19:47] amen our fruit is incorruptible amen but
[1:19:49] their fruit is corruptable you're a holy
[1:19:52] tree so thank god abide in the branch
[1:19:54] abide in the vine branches and bring
[1:19:56] forth the fruit of christ
[1:19:58] amen
[1:20:01] now here again you have your
[1:20:02] i focus on these two parts here
[1:20:10] uh yeah
[1:20:11] so let me go back there yeah so you so
[1:20:13] just
[1:20:14] we don't have to spend as much time on
[1:20:15] the flesh right now maybe we will at a
[1:20:17] later time but it's uh we would have to
[1:20:19] differentiate between the human spirit
[1:20:21] and the soul
[1:20:22] now remember church you can be saved
[1:20:24] yet anointed with the evil spirit so let
[1:20:26] me i just want to show this again so
[1:20:28] australia can get that one so you guys
[1:20:29] got it peter repented and followed jesus
[1:20:32] in mark 1. in john 4 he was already
[1:20:34] baptizing others
[1:20:36] proving he's already saved because how
[1:20:37] can he baptize people to get saved if he
[1:20:39] hasn't done it himself
[1:20:42] in matthew 11 he went out and preached
[1:20:44] to cities
[1:20:45] with all the power to heal every manner
[1:20:47] of sickness and disease
[1:20:49] in matthew 14 he walks on water
[1:20:52] uh now luke 9 should have been up here
[1:20:55] with matthew 11. so i'm sorry but
[1:20:57] otherwise he got all the power and then
[1:20:58] he walked on water two chapters later
[1:21:01] mark in matthew 16 brother austin
[1:21:03] jesus said i've got to go suffer and be
[1:21:05] killed and i'm skipping down here
[1:21:07] peter took him and said lord
[1:21:10] be it far from you to die this will not
[1:21:12] be done unto you
[1:21:14] in other words peter said you're not
[1:21:15] gonna you have to go to the cross no
[1:21:16] one's gonna kill you
[1:21:18] we're gonna have we're gonna have our
[1:21:18] whole lifetimes with this mighty miracle
[1:21:20] ministry
[1:21:22] see peter was leaning on the flesh
[1:21:24] of jesus
[1:21:26] right but jesus turned to peter and said
[1:21:29] get thee behind me satan
[1:21:33] he said it to peter
[1:21:35] who had already walked on water
[1:21:38] he'd already baptized he'd seen all
[1:21:39] manner of miracles he was baptizing
[1:21:41] others
[1:21:43] and i never find jesus apologizing for
[1:21:45] this
[1:21:46] he said thou art an offense unto me he's
[1:21:48] not talking to peter he's talking to
[1:21:49] satan who's influencing peter
[1:21:52] for thou
[1:21:53] lovest not savers not the things that
[1:21:54] are of god but the things that be amen
[1:21:58] remember jesus later later when he the
[1:22:00] night he was arrested he said simon i
[1:22:03] prayed for you satan has desired to have
[1:22:04] you see how satan was trying to get into
[1:22:05] peter's life he was trying to get into
[1:22:07] the man who had the keys to the kingdom
[1:22:09] he was trying to get him to do false
[1:22:10] doctrines right doctrines of devils
[1:22:13] see satan wants to sift you as weed he
[1:22:14] wants to shake up your life and just
[1:22:16] blow away your life and blow all your
[1:22:18] hopes away
[1:22:20] but i prayed for you
[1:22:22] that's your faith doesn't fail amen
[1:22:24] church let's pray for one another amen
[1:22:26] pray that the other person's faith
[1:22:27] doesn't fail pray that their faith
[1:22:30] prevails amen
[1:22:32] we also have to pray for one another
[1:22:33] praise god
[1:22:35] let brother van gaan let brother austin
[1:22:36] say unless all our brothers love our
[1:22:38] sisters stand god help their faith to
[1:22:40] stand in the trial
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:45] and even though he denied christ three
[1:22:46] times he never forsook christ he never
[1:22:49] sold out christ like judas did
[1:22:51] you can have some real bad failures and
[1:22:52] jesus is still going to forgive you
[1:22:54] hallelujah
[1:22:56] you can have satan himself anointing you
[1:22:58] but if you repent jesus is still going
[1:22:59] to forgive you
[1:23:01] that's the love of god
[1:23:04] so what did peter have
[1:23:05] peter had faith i'm just giving an
[1:23:07] illustration here brother i could you
[1:23:08] know i'm i'm not saying this is exactly
[1:23:09] right but he at least had faith to
[1:23:10] preach right
[1:23:11] he at least had virtue to preach
[1:23:13] publicly but then he look look he let
[1:23:15] the dev he had this reasoning well lord
[1:23:17] you're doing all these things no you
[1:23:18] that's not of god for you to go to die
[1:23:20] on the cross he built up a complex from
[1:23:23] satan in his mind
[1:23:25] he reads and said you've only been
[1:23:27] ministering three and a half years or
[1:23:28] maybe three years at this point we have
[1:23:30] the rest of our lives you're not going
[1:23:32] to go die what do you mean talking about
[1:23:33] die we just got we're just getting
[1:23:34] started
[1:23:37] you don't have to die and jesus said get
[1:23:39] behind me satan
[1:23:40] he realized it wasn't peter was peter a
[1:23:43] predestinated seed absolutely
[1:23:46] but he got the other good anointing but
[1:23:48] he didn't have enough of it
[1:23:50] and he got the bad anointing in one area
[1:23:52] of his mind
[1:23:54] so i hope that's helpful by god's grace
[1:23:56] he didn't lose all this right he still
[1:23:58] had this
[1:23:59] but in one channel
[1:24:01] he got a complex he got a demonic
[1:24:03] thought from satan
[1:24:05] now churchill we're humble if we're
[1:24:07] humble we can all say sometimes we take
[1:24:09] thoughts from demons
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:15] i just trust we have a real honest
[1:24:16] church today praise god
[1:24:21] uh
[1:24:22] let me look at this section this might
[1:24:24] be a long section one two okay i already
[1:24:26] looked at those okay
[1:24:30] the next section okay
[1:24:36] yeah let me um
[1:24:38] boy this is a long one here
[1:24:42] okay
[1:24:46] yeah to help me lord i should probably
[1:24:47] be praying during this time help me
[1:24:48] jesus help me to find the right place
[1:24:51] help me lord i sort of need your grace i
[1:24:53] don't want to go too long here um
[1:24:59] okay i got three minutes okay yeah three
[1:25:00] minutes okay so yeah let me just finish
[1:25:01] this up here i'll i'll just start this
[1:25:02] next section okay
[1:25:04] um let's look at more doctrines of devil
[1:25:06] so i'm going to skip ahead here
[1:25:08] i need to that's what i need to learn
[1:25:09] how to do a pray you know about the
[1:25:11] direction
[1:25:14] okay so i'll just go three minutes on
[1:25:16] this i'll stop the live stream i have
[1:25:17] you stand and i'll show you those
[1:25:18] visuals i shared on wednesday so you can
[1:25:21] because we have to start digging into
[1:25:22] those and see how much of this is of the
[1:25:24] devil
[1:25:24] these message doctrines
[1:25:26] now eventually i'll preach on them
[1:25:28] publicly but i'm just like in this early
[1:25:30] stage of studying these
[1:25:32] because you have to be able to classify
[1:25:33] them well if this is a false doctrine
[1:25:35] which devil is this
[1:25:37] right and you have to find examples of
[1:25:39] that in the bible
[1:25:42] right
[1:25:43] it's like the no fasting one well you
[1:25:44] can find that the bible said they'll
[1:25:46] have gluttony you know we can find okay
[1:25:48] that's this but what spirit what demon
[1:25:50] is that
[1:25:51] is that pride
[1:25:52] which one is that
[1:25:54] i believe it's idolatry
[1:25:56] because you're making yourself
[1:25:59] your whole focus
[1:26:01] you're loving your there it is you're
[1:26:02] loving yourself more than god
[1:26:04] you're giving your body more than what
[1:26:05] it needs because you love your body more
[1:26:07] than you love god
[1:26:08] okay so that's what i'm saying it takes
[1:26:10] each one you gotta look at it and say is
[1:26:11] this the devil or not
[1:26:12] what is this is this era of christian
[1:26:14] liberty
[1:26:16] remember every ever christian liberty it
[1:26:17] doesn't make you more like god if you do
[1:26:19] it or doesn't make you less like god
[1:26:20] it's just an area of liberty
[1:26:23] like jewelry it says now of course
[1:26:24] everyone can be taken too far wine
[1:26:26] drinking that can be taken too far
[1:26:29] holy days feast days
[1:26:31] all that can be taken so far
[1:26:35] but which ones are devils
[1:26:37] okay and i've already preached them that
[1:26:38] are you know like making every word by
[1:26:40] the way i'm saying making him infallible
[1:26:42] okay so
[1:26:46] okay actually i didn't even yeah i must
[1:26:47] have skipped that too so here we can
[1:26:49] clearly see doctrines of devils in the
[1:26:50] bible
[1:26:51] mandatory celibacy
[1:26:53] mandatory vegetarian diet it's okay if
[1:26:55] you're vegetarian
[1:26:57] just save the steak for me okay if you
[1:26:58] ever go out
[1:26:59] i'll eat the steak you just set off on
[1:27:01] the side
[1:27:02] uh the rapture is passed paul said that
[1:27:04] eats like a canker
[1:27:05] that's such a demonic see because it
[1:27:07] makes them give up well what is there to
[1:27:08] look forward to see that's why we got to
[1:27:09] always be looking for the rapture praise
[1:27:11] god
[1:27:12] it will the bible says it overthrows
[1:27:13] people's faith well what is there to
[1:27:14] live for
[1:27:16] there's no hope but our hope is jesus
[1:27:18] christ returning amen and each
[1:27:20] generation must have that hope amen
[1:27:22] they must have that hope within them or
[1:27:24] else they'll give up and say oh it's all
[1:27:25] going to it's all going to communism
[1:27:27] it's all going to russia it's all going
[1:27:29] to the democrats or whatever you know
[1:27:31] whatever there's no hope for the future
[1:27:35] oh yeah they say the lord returned in
[1:27:36] 1963 cloud so there's no fasting needed
[1:27:38] that's a brother told me
[1:27:40] boy he's had trouble since then
[1:27:43] five they turned the grace of god into
[1:27:45] lawlessness the bible said
[1:27:48] men of
[1:27:49] men of corrupt ends their end is
[1:27:51] corruption their end is destruction
[1:27:54] men who are ordained to death in hell
[1:27:56] turn grace into lawlessness you can live
[1:27:58] however you want and you're still going
[1:28:00] to have grace that's lawlessness that's
[1:28:02] lashiviousness that's a doctrine of hell
[1:28:09] now these will all be preached in a
[1:28:11] deceptive way right they're
[1:28:13] demon-inspired
[1:28:14] they'll be preached by hypocrites
[1:28:17] that don't live what they preach
[1:28:22] because their consciences
[1:28:24] are numb and they cannot feel the
[1:28:26] conviction of the holy ghost
[1:28:28] like that one guy with fasting i looked
[1:28:30] at him and he's way overweight he's
[1:28:31] probably 50 pounds overweight well don't
[1:28:33] you know you're going to get heart
[1:28:34] disease from that don't you know you're
[1:28:36] going to get cancer don't you know
[1:28:37] you're going to get diabetes and they're
[1:28:38] going to blame it on the devil but you
[1:28:40] did it it wasn't well i guess it was a
[1:28:41] devil one since like they fouled the
[1:28:43] devil's worship of himself
[1:28:45] they accepted the devil's anointing to
[1:28:46] be their own god
[1:28:49] but then they blamed the devil like the
[1:28:50] devil made me do it no you wanted to do
[1:28:52] it
[1:28:58] praise god
[1:29:07] my 15 minutes are up so let's stand to
