========================================

so we had I think we had really good success by the grace of God thank you for your prayers your sacrifice or donations and everything worked out by the grace of God I went we went there were able to pretty much cover them in the majority of all the expenses for brother Ron for our interpreter he stayed in tyre two weeks with us so he sacrificed quite a bit we were able to give him a nice little [Music] donation I know Emma and Lydia had specifically set aside money and we took that there and we were able to don't we stayed with a man who runs an orphanage he's got 35 children under his reign there he's a pastor he deals with the akka tribe and he has put up three or four churches for the tribes of akka and their beautiful buildings and he's pretty much a one-man machine here in fact there's only one person who might be it was Bo Jesse the amount of things that he can do is just I'm in awe of what he done he did he built these churches he built the cross 1/4 of churches and everywhere we saw a white cross where there was red neon around it that was him and I saw him probably 10m just even just driving through town there's I said this probably was and he would donate he'd made these in donating to the churches and he put them all the Tricia's that akka tried but we got to share the word quite a bit and and i was thinking i was talking to my wife on the way here and i think man i wonder why God would send me here and and the only reason these people would even listen to me and accept what we're bringing forth is because we brought it straight from the Bible I didn't need any quotes I took them verse by verse by verse by verse and showed them out of their own Bible even though their translations off show them by their own Bible what the truth is and time and time again the pastor the interpreter says we can ask anything about against it because it's so the word is right we have to know our swords we have to keep our swords sharp we have to know the revelation behind them we have many invites for the round the end day I don't know if you remember my very first trip I come back and do the presentation right here or they were there I came here where was the end there was three generations a grandmother a mother and then a granddaughter and brother Ron was able to contact the granddaughter the young one she's married now and brother Ron wouldn't did a Bible stay with him and they fully see the entire message now they believe the Prophet they believe the church ages believe the messenger original sin all that so now they are hungry more for the word and keep it around in prayer he is moving to Kuwait to get closer to Thailand he is uprooting everything sold his cars house and he is moving to Kuwait to where you're not allowed to witness over there this Muslim so all chased they reckon they said brother all you can do is live a life answer only what is asked if someone asks you something than answer but they don't say because they don't play over there in dangerous territory so so I don't know when we'll be back we'll probably be soon and the Lord delivered my job back on the way and I was driving back from the airport I called my boss and said I said you want me to come back he said no there's no work for you you're done it with a howl of Allah and then an eagle swooped down by the car and I was like and then he goes hold on one minute well give me a day to think on it I said thank you Father Jehovah eagle is in control and so I had I had to take a day off there and waited and then the secretary called said oh we need you Friday and then the next day I kept waiting and then he's called in the next things that all right we need you Thursday so I didn't my last two days of work here so God is faithful he preserves everything I was fully ready to go sign the list but the Lord said no stay right here a little longer so I don't value a job any more or more than the gospel in fact this trip I did not want to go on because only three weeks notice and I told them original I said no rawness like thank you but I felt checked that's my desire that's my will I went in the prayer closet and I said Lord if you want me to go within two days I said this in my heart let something happen and on the flat Friday the second day it happened so but it seemed to happen I know I could go back on my word and went bought the ticket the next day and we're off so anyhow I want to keep you standing let's turn to like I said here I was not planning on on teaching tonight but God must have had his will I didn't have time to get around to sermon unfresh something fresh recently but off to give you something about a month and a half old but it's still good to me this is actually like a culmination of a couple years in the making this study and it's beautiful to see that God would continue to unfold his word and to place it I'm to the point I'm actually to the point Saints to where I love looking at one Scripture and I like looking at I like it dissect it but for me I'm to the point now where I'm I want to step back I'm gonna step back and I want to see the whole picture because as I taught in Thailand this is a mystery book Saints this is a mystery book and it's a puzzle book but if puzzle book the puzzle needs to be put together and we want to be able to place peace as a God gives you a piece here and a piece here you want to put together and a piece here and put together and then as you slowly adds revelational pieces together then we can have a greater understanding and see a greater meaning behind it a more clear nice precise vision of what was laid before what was given to us this was given to us so we want to teach by the grace of God let's turn to Luke 14 I don't want to have any pride or anything but seeing Malachi and Lydia up here I just I just think the Lord Jesus Christ for their gifts being manifested and their willingness their yielded vessels so it's exciting for an uncle to see those things they can't imagine how their mom and dad would feel it alright let's see if we can do here Oh Lorna let's see if we can get this to go there we go Luke 14 verse 16 we're gonna read two passages of Scripture we'll say a word of Prayer and then you can have receipts and we want to teach this hopefully this will be a blessing Saints uh you know you always want to know where we are in the Bible we want to know where we are in the scripture we want to know in the in the the time God's time clock where we at we're exactly precisely are where what are we dealing with here so and I and this one helped me out quite a bit here in Luke 6 14 verse 16 then he said unto them a certain man made a great supper and made many and sent his servant at supper time what is this this is the wedding supper right this is the marriage supper of the Lamb God Jesus Christ had died resurrected he wave goodbye to his a early bride he said I'm going to prepare a place for you he prepared to place and now he's got the wedding table all set the food setting there and he's coming at his bride he says come for all things already in verse 18 and they all with one consent look there in 1 cor hmm began to make excuse the first symptom I have bought a piece some ground and I have needs go and see it I pray that you have me excused and another said I have brought I'm bought five yoke of oxen and go to prove them I pray they had me excused another said I married a wife and therefore I cannot come right let's jump now to [Music] Luke 17 if you think on this portion of Scripture they came they made excuses now remember God is coming to his people right these had to have been Christian people he's not going to to a motorcycle gang or or he's not going to the clubs looking business but he's actually coming to these people and he's saying I'm ready for you will you come and they said no so the thought is who are they listening to why were I was like this why were their hearts and ease what was the read what caused them to become like this and at the end of the study you'll see why they were like this Luke 17 verse 26 just a couple pages further here but Luke 17 verse 26 now notice we read this something everybody's heard this a million times and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded the same day that lot went enough went out of Sodom they rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all let's say a word of Prayer dearly father Lord Jesus will we just Love You Lord we come hopping Oh Lord Lord you know this was not my plan Lord to be standing behind us a little pulpit here God and Lord Jesus Lord my lord it was in your mind it was in her your way O Lord for even for me to teach this study I was not going to teach this for this weekend Lord but Lord you you pre you arranged this in such a way in order we want to bring it Lord as humbly and reverently Lord and with love Lord where we just pray bless the people Lord hear this word our Lord blessed and keep them God Lord just keep us right straight in the narrow Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats if you notice in both these passages in Luke 14 Luke 17 they are they're busy in life they're accomplishing things in the natural the material realm is going very well for them they're doing pretty good you know it's a time of prosperity where they could actually buy these things they could they could go in and whatever their harps desire was they could go and accomplish it the opportunities were there there was nothing to hinder but all things were available sounds like the American Dream I wonder but but at this time of prosperity at the time where you could I just love to see these two brother-in-law sitting next to each other male faithful warriors and go see our brother back and all the saints of God's thing valiantly and on a Friday night you guys are here you guys can do anything you wanted aside to go out and take a nice cold walk but if you could be on your couch leveled up listening to a sermon or at listening tape or making something but you chose to be at the house of God that is a shows tremendous character so god bless your hearts so here at this time and let me give you a little a story here on why about six months ago we had a brother come and preach and he he pulled me aside and we were talking and he said brother and he said a certain something to me he said something I'll show I'll shared leader here he said something to me and I said why did he say that because you know the Bible says you know we got to try every spirit what was the reason for stating this to me he spoke this to me and for some reason this struck me odd you know there's a lot of times how many conversations do we go through day in and day out that never never retained with you that nothing nothing of oh this person said this but nothing's fixed you know you forget about it this that but there's some times when people say things to you and man that sticks to right in your heart and they'll be like hmm well I took that statement I put it on a shelf okay I took that statement and I put it right there and I just waited I waited on God so tonight I'd like to teach on in the days of the open book all right I hope this doesn't seem Antichrist but we want to you'll see by the Word of God we will dial this I want you to see the bigger picture of this okay I want you to see what we're trying to convey by the grace of God now here in Revelations 5 verse 1 we see it interesting we know this that the Prophet said this is the most sublime portion of scripture here in Revelation 5 verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on a throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals right here is the father on the throne he has the book of Redemption his hand into this sealed up and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth nor neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon this is a very important book no Pope as the Prophet said was able to open it and I'll say today no message Pope is able to know it was able to open his book there was no one in heaven in heaven or on earth that was able to even not a born on this book right and when John said this he says and I wept the restorer much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and praise be to God right our Lord and Savior came down in his first coming he lived the perfect life he became the perfect sacrifice Saints a God in three she healed he did everything that could be done in fact everything that needed to be done was done right then they know if you mean healing tonight it was already done back land if you needed Liberty the provision anything you need was done 2,000 years ago amen and that's exactly right but when he came and did these sort of things what he did all those redemptive blessing those seven compound redemptive blessings there was I believe in Isaiah 53 or somewhere around there he did those two thousand years ago he was led by the Holy Ghost onto that cross that Roman curse I think that that Roman cross they cruised to find him and he died oh my goodness for our sins his blood it was shed for us he did something at you or I could never do they men and did he stand there no he rose again and proved that he was God he proved who he was and he not only proved it but he did it for our sakes so every service was for our Saints that what he did back there was just as important right now these little services here but that is for you but we find that same God our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now he come and took this book and we know he broke the seven seals correct and then here in Revelations 10:1 now look at this let's get the let's get the timetables rolling here I did bring a piece of paper here this is kind of interesting I just want to throw these out here notice here and I saw another mighty angel dah 11 flows with the cloud right we know that was that cloud in 1963 correct this is the proper said that on February the 17th Noah went on the ark February 17th no one in the ark 1951 February the 8th William Upshaw was instantly healed in February February 1961 jr. Jackson has that dream of the pyramid February 11th 1961 Danny heavy Denny Henry or oh yeah Henry had that prophecy that ran that translation of that prophecy for Bella Branham now has chosen the correct way that was in February and then here in February 28th of 1963 we see this cloud come down notice the timing okay because remember oh I want to get a timetable here I want to places where we had in the scripture right now why were those people who had a wife or was building a house and this is the oxen what was what happened to them because that's in the timetables that's someone for our day that's for our day that was the marriage supper that's for our day that takes place at the end of Laodicea that is a pre rapture right there so we want to place these things and a rainbow was set upon his head in his face was where the Sun and his feet is filled of fire and he had in his right hand a little open book now he had come down the cloud was formed in 63 the open book and the what he preached the seals just a month later in March correct the seven thunders Robert but now look with this in verse revelations 10 six and I swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that are that re that there that there are then that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that are that are there in that time should be no longer when that happened in 62 63 at that time time is at the end it is the end brother for 50-plus years we're 55 plus years down the road I'm telling you we're at the end okay I can't emphasize that enough we are at the end it is over now look at this next one we know these things right revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God to be finished as he had declared his servants the prophets right we know this and the voice which I heard from heavens bacon to me he said go and take the little book go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the seed upon the earth I went unto the angel he said to me give me the little book and he's telling me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter he shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it it was in my belly my belly was bitter right and he said thou and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings correct this right here is the days of the open book okay the book is opened more and more revelation is coming out more and more nuggets more understanding more we're grasping the word we're seeing the sincere Word of God opening up continually now new thoughts are coming like this it's at a break breakneck speed it's coming just just off like that by just things at least for me it is as far as understanding I'll say like that now where do we go from here if we had to add or if we the can came from this area the open book has come down if we had to continue where are we jumped you from right here by the grace of God we will bring you right there at the days of the open book when I took I actually took a vacation first for in three years this year and but I went to Texas and I went and then brother Andy who was working the first couple days so I had some free time in the morning I woke up may it may imagine this all my vacation I woke up before seven before 6:30 every day with on my own so figure that out so the first day yeah I was up at yak crazy I was up at 6:30 and I'm like why the way it goes oh I'm going running so brother Andy lives just a couple blocks from a nice mile link it's a mile long and I ran around the mile thing twice and on the second mile there I started praising God and worshiping God and I looked down and on the concrete when they poured it someone wrote their name and their name was amber and I thought amber and I was just started worshiping God I said yes Lord you are that amber light if anybody that that that yellowish greenish that had that pie right there just going and you are that amber and my mind went right to Ezekiel and I went back and I started sitting down and I went back because I was up so early that I ran my 2.4 miles or whatever it was I opened my Bible I started reading in Ezekiel so we could let's go to Ezekiel here notice they had to eat the book correct notice in the days of the open book and when you eat something what should it do we were commissioned take the book but what did John say John said give it to me no that was not the Commission the Commission was to so John didn't even understand the way to get it anyhow you're supposed to take it and eat it and by eating it you will gain strength did you know they Ezequiel means God will strengthen I wonder if this plays into the days of the open book in Ezekiel 1 here and it came to pass that Ezekiel the heavens were opened I saw the visions of God and notice here it says God will the name is eco means God will strengthen right and in this last day we're gonna need so much spiritual strength for the journey right amen now notice here in Ezekiel 1 and 4 and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out north and a great cloud the same cloud I bet all that was back in 1963 I wonder if that was something lighted but we see we heat we see here a cloud and a fire and pulling himself and the brightness was about it and I was amidst her up with the color of a mere out in the midst of the fire and this is this is the scripture I thought about when I ran past I saw the name Ambrose just worshiping God and boom amber I started reading and we noticed here in Ezekiel 1 as he's dealing with that the cloud and the amber light and he's seeing God that here comes the one he finds himself in the midst what of the four zooms we see the the man the ox the Eagle the lion all those he's find himself right up there right amen and this is what they you know they the artist conception of them is there one person with four hands and where they would never move to the right or left it always go forward what protecting God amen yeah a little close up there absolutely but notice in Ezekiel to notice and thou shalt speak my words unto them where was they will hear and whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what I say into thee be not thou rebellious like the rebellious I'll open thy mouth and eat that I give thee we are coming to the days of the open book what cause what caused those at the marriage supper what caused those in Luke 17 to be out and about and doing everything prospering here listen as' and they were so relaxed in their heart there has to be a reason and we'll find it in the days of the open book he says he says be thou be that be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat what I give thee why because God will strengthen you hey man if you read you word if you meditate on the Word of God you pray God will strengthen you beyond a certain sister was listening to a minister on the internet then she heard something wrong and she began to pray on it and the Holy Ghost said listen to my prophet only put them tapes on Saints because what the secret of the rapture is you want to hear things to open up you never heard things you listened to that tape a thousand times he hears something new every time boom this strikes this strikes another angle in verse 90s and when I look behold a hand was set unto me and lo a roll of a book was there on see here was an open book we're picking up from revelations 10 and he spread it before me and it was written within without notice it was not sealed yet it was open it was not sealed and what until Daniel so we see a time in history in description my book is open and he's allowed to read what's in it and he must perform certain things that are written within hey man are you with me and he spread it before me it was written within without and there was written there lamentations and mourning and woe right some hard things are written in there things are going to be revealed in there in ezekiel 3-1 morally suddenly we saw the man Eve without findeth whatever you find whatever God every time you jump in that word your pastor he must study constantly these pastors are amazing brothers a one time brother cam went on it went on a trip for I think it was two weeks and I to do for services you know what that's like you get done with one tourist you're like I got a service in three more days I got a prep I got a study back to the scriptures woohoo look at me and I got done with that service oh wait I got him study I got a sermon in three more days it's a never-ending pressure it's always on the calls always on the burners lift up your pastor strength your pastors they never stopped his motherhood hard yeah absolutely so his father her mother fatherhood [Laughter] oh my it says more money suddenly me Saturday Ethan our finest Jesus wrong go to the house of Israel you'll speak into the house of Israel so I open mouth and he calls me to eat that wrong he eat the open book and he said to me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this role that I give me that when I eat it then did I eat it and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey now what was this role supposed to do he ate the open book was delivered to the problem I'm God's it eat it and he ate it what was this supposed to produce in Ezekiel three four and he said to me son of man go and get thee to the house if those won't speak my words unto them whatever he finds in there notice he's not looking for anything specific but whatever he finds in there is the scripture says he must bring it for when when pastor Jesse digs in the Word of God whatever he finds he was bringing a poor boy whatever that's brother whatever that's brother whatever that's brother whatever fine you must bring it for whatever I buy I must bring it boil and it might be different for each one because we are different vessels this man is a warrior totally different than me this brother just brother there are different soldiers sisters different soldiers one from another deformations in life different situations battles roll it'll be different amen he says for thou are not sent to a people a strange speech and of a hard language but to the house of Israel to the true children of God right look at verse 8 behold I have made thy face strong against their faces and then for had strong against their forehead their foreheads and there's an adamant harder than flint if I made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they may be a rebellious house so whatever the prophet found in that book was going to be hard for other Christians to hear this was not going to denomination this was going to the house of the Living God hey man yes yes it was now what does this have to do with anything this is the days of the open book correct now in chapter 4 God commands Ezekiel do not shoot the zeeco to lay on one on a side so many days and prophesy remember we should prophesy again right but whatever we find notice in chapter 5 it says a hints of the common destruction of Israelite but in our days it comes to a coming a rebuilding of the temple of Israel amen but there will be a destruction hit chapter 6 it shows judgment will be striking notice this is all in the days of the open book correct it started in 63-62 right around that time the open book came down where are we at why were those Laxton Lu notice here in Chapter 7 of Ezekiel more of the word of Lord can we say at last our son of man thus saith the Lord God our land of Israel and and the end is come upon the four corners of the land he says it's over it's over are we living like it's over like these are the last fleeting moments of history and any second la San Francisco go on let's fix of sevens vision he saw 1933 could take place at any second look at lamentations they hunt our steps that we cannot go into our streets our end is near our days are fulfilled for end is come our persecutors are swifter than the Eagles of heaven they pursued us upon the mountains as they laid wait for us in the wilderness the promise said you wait till you see revelations 13 people fear persecution in America notice he deals with the four corner of the land it's the end if the end revelations tenis at the time shall be no more it's over just like here in the opening the sixth seal Revelation 7:1 and after these things I saw the four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds the earth of the wind shall not blow the earth or the sea nor any tree destruction the for clergy earth a destruction now is being held back to his niko seven one seven three now is the in come upon thee he keeps saying we're at the end it's over when that that that opening in the seventh sealed that book coming down marked the very end of time is finished and I'll spend my anger upon deandre quality to a court will judge the according to thy ways and recompense to you all upon line abominations and mine I shall not spare thee neither shall I have pity but I work what will recompense thy ways upon D in thy abominations shall be in the myth he shall know that I am the Lord he says thus saith the Lord God and evil and only evil behold is come something is up the street here Saints there is something so diabolical there's something so satanic so close as to to see the reelected that God says it's an evil it strom behold it's come we're at the end we were going to see Satan at its best and and as common end has come it watches for thee behold it come it has come is there earth and see in our hearts tonight is there urgency in our lives tonight gotta mercy your pastor here is calling for prayer and fasting wow what a what what an example in this hour is that a man's harder than the heart of Christ is that the Spirit of Christ wanting that or that a man that's something spiritual things amen I'm not trying to be hard I'm just I am lacing us I want to show you because something was said to me a couple months two months months ago and it stuck with something struck why did he see look at this we've had a lot of deaths lately but the Dames lost - we just lost the sister in our assembly I heard another brother from overseas that just passed look what happens here the righteous parathe perish with no man lay out of the heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come there are some Saints that God is taking away before this evil strike in the days of the open book well I thought the bride wouldn't see death yeah those at the time of his little come but time has went on sings the messenger is gone the majority of those who have seen the Prophet that is that they're all they're all there on them they're on the outside there they're Lully me they're passing away they're going to sleep now notice here at the Ezekiel 7 again verse 7 the morning has come unto thee although that dwells in the land that time has come the time the day of trouble is near and the problem to catch up in the church a new book said in the time and the temptation would come as follows the day of trouble jacob's trouble the day of the tribulation it's coming the time of the temptation to tax your souls we have to make choices soon but I believe saints of God you've already made your choice and you have the seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your heart amen praise be to God when we left a nomination we said that's it we're never looking back when we sold all we had it is finished we have not looked back from there amen let me tell you something when the things of the world I went Italian didn't hear one customer for two weeks and I was on the phone with a man that works with me and in three words I heard certain words if 10 of them in 30 seconds and I thought I and I was just going to work and I said should I just quit this job and just spurned me so bad but notice what does God find here Ezekiel 7 verse 9 and my eye shall not he's what he's bringing some fury he's gonna bring some anger some judgment and my eye shall not spare neither will I have pity I work in pencil according to thy ways and 9 abomination ornamentally and you shall know that i am the lord the god that's mighty for just why is our last name Smith that means to smite and we are going to smite that image until it drops [Laughter] [Music] absolutely can't break your type your your name does a lot with you it sure does and we are going to hit the Antichrist here and we're going to slam the denomination with fear we're going to hit that organizational spirit until in his over a month until I can't smite no more I'm a praise God but look what Christ says here in verse 10 behold the day beholding his cousin pride hath button for or sorry pride has bunted instead of bringing forth the gifts of the Spirit or fighting some spiritual fruit on the tree but what they were in notice that's rod you know in the Ark of the Covenant imparted was enormous it brought forth the correct fruit but notice these this rod right here this branch is was saying what in God in a boy it brought forth crying what is that tie into one of the first scriptures God showed me about woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of Ephraim whose glorious beauty as a flea is it them that are overcome with Revelation stimulation behold the LORD hath my in a strong which is as a tempest or hail over destroying storm and is a flood of mighty water passed down in the earth of the hand the crown of pride the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet it's done this was this study right here as a culmination of almost 5 years he's given me peace here peace here I don't even look for this time I said the Lord of Hosts be a crown for crown of glory for a and for a diadem of beauty themselves with pride and and there are Sun that will be crowned by the Holy Ghost amen what power demonstration of it what is resurrection a man here will display it and notice and for a spear a judgment to him that should have been judgment and for a strength to them that turned the battle to the gate amen but they but they have also aired through wider through strong drink or on the way the in the priest and a prophet of air through strong Greek they are swallowed up a wine they are out of the way through strong drink the air and vision they stumble in judgment for all tables are full of vomit vomit and filthiness and so there is no place sticking with the Word of God let me tell you something what the scriptures say why was that why did the man have come down from heaven the Bible says it was to try them for forty years the man who would come down they gather these little things and they make bread out of it and for forty years did anyone actually when the Israelites did they granted they they gather this bread this manna did they inject any lemon in it or do they eat it pure I wonder it was their injection going on were they were they dialing in with the the genetics of him changing into something else it tastes like it tastes a little bit different were they messing with it if the type is right but they was I don't know now notice for spirit of judgment and he's in June 1:14 notice the seventh from Adam was Enoch right and he was what he saw the Lord he prophesied saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of Saints to execute judgment upon all right all these wrong preachers bringing all these things correct so we see in the days of the open book it's over the days are at hand but also notice in the days of the open book a certain revelation is supposed to be given to Ezekiel to strengthen him what is that revelation there is something that God wants to show Ezekiel in these jiae's God does not come down with an open whoops no look for long there is a reason for everything what was one of the biggest things he shows was the next chapter remember I taught on this a year and a half ago I believe here what does God showing here God finds comes down and he put a form of a hand and took me up by the lock on my head and in the spirit lifted me up between you heaven the earth and brought me to the vision of God of God to Jerusalem to the door the inner gate that looketh toward the north and there was a seat and there was the seat of the image of jealousy was provoked provoked at to jealousy he lifts the prophet up and says in this day you've eaten you're strong now and I'm going to show you something to prophesy against and he lifts him up into the revelation into the spirit and he places them into the house of God this is what Moses set up this is what Solomon set up he takes him to what where God is supposed to dwell to a holy place there's no place like it on the face of the earth there they crucified Him there they took him there hello rewind hey man and behold notice but there in that before the house the gates on the north side they had an image of jealousy right it doesn't say what it was but whatever was it made the heart of God jealous they must have been giving credit or worship to something else besides God come on I shared this here before do you want to see it again go with me to John 6 everyone understand are you seeing where we're facing things why Road side why do you keep hammering on this why do you keep showing this now I see now I understand my god keep remember when I taught him to give me nights last time sure it was the very old testament type of the methylated spirit why am i why is he keep showing any things because we somebody's going to see it somebody they say he's supposed to see it in John 6 notice very powerful portion of scripture here in John 6 notice this in verse 30 John 6 verse 30 everybody there amen let's read this they said therefore to what signs show us now then that we may see and believe thee what does that work notice our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness as it is written they went right to the scripture they quoted something back from the Old Testament from Moses day they did not bury they kept line upon line word upon word every comma period was perfect when they quoted the scripture right you're gonna find this is a quote collected back in time of Exodus he gave them bread from heaven to eat they were telling Jesus what he did but the Bible says that in this day the Jesus Christ would have the gift of the Masonic sign on him and he would be able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart to man and women a night and notice as these Jews are saying they were quarrying of scripture to the Living God in flesh incarnate God in flesh they quoted one scripture to him and little God did he just turned them then jesus said to him barely barely saying to you Moses gave you not that bread in their hearts when they used the scripture and they said he they did not mean God in their hearts in their minds they thought it was Moses they had interjected a man a prophet higher than God when they set a perfect scripture so close to deceive the very elect a Moses did this and Moses to death and brother branham did this and brother Brett let me tell you something the Prophet said I was only there I had nothing to do with this SEMA do you see it an image of jealousy Amen so here a God takes him to the house of God Ezekiel in Ezekiel 5 and he said to me son of man lift up thine eyes now towards the way of the north notice the North has always been what the Eagle Age the North if there's if you see a 7 it's a 7 Church ages Amen if you see a 5 is Grace if you see North it means what it means the north side it is the eagle's dance side it's the north side it's our side amen it's our age it's our gate so I lifted up my eyes the way towards in order to behold the northward of the game of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry notice in this age in the Eagle age there means something that made God jealous a that yes and what does God say see son of man you see this image it makes me jealous he says you want to see more I'll take a deeper into it in the days of the open book in the days of the open book let that see in this day we're 55 years exactly exactly the Bible types cannot lie there has to be an image of jealousy out there again on our age so but now God says you know what well it's not worry that he says he said but turn you again and he shall see greater abomination because it's an abomination but notice here notice if they set if they set an image of jealousy on the north side what spirit is behind them because the prophet go he says now man Michael and and just as you that Lucifer and haven't tried to exalt himself and just be a liar a little higher than his boss he said and he betrayed Michael and made himself a great Kingdom in the north so Satan will always go to the north side to set up a new kingdom set up a new kingdom of the north side in our age a man notice he remembers sin did not begin on earth sin began in heaven when Lucifer taking the main amuses I was in about a denomination make a great big thing went on the North Country and set up a bigger thing to Michael handy was kicked out of heaven shows the spirit that was on in the days of the open book Isaiah 14:12 Howard our fall from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how old are cut down to the ground which in weaken the nation's for the I said in my heart I will ascend into heaven how exalt my throne above the song to God I was sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North once again always pointing to the north side Satan's setting up his kingdom but God says forget that image now I want to show you greater than in other words worse than this and he brought me to the door of the court and when I looked at me holding a hole in the wall they had completely lacked off the house of God it was barred up blacked up no one could get in except those that were allowed then he said to me son of man dig down in the wall and when I dig in the wall behold a door right what does this mean we've been to the I thought to see everybody here and have to go right remember what this means and he said to me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here in the days of the open book in our day in that through house of God so I went in and saw behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel portrayed upon the wall roundabout notice says every form of creepy thing Genesis 1:25 that was the creeping things came on the sixth day Romans 1:23 notice if they reject the true revelation of judgment the to revelation of God had came down in revelations 1 and they rejected it and professing themselves to be in the bride wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into the image making like a the corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and of creepy things this is all tying in here now I'm going to read this portions will be reading here everybody ok still got strength you need wave your hands wave your hands a little bit and praise the Lord say thank you Lord Jesus a matter why because we find ourselves in the time of the open book and it behooves each one of us to enter now in we go home tonight for 10 15 20 minutes whatever open that word to the Lord what will you have your servant to know I'm going to take it and I'm gonna dig down into this word and I believe Lord I believe with all faith you'll reveal something true something that will strengthen you strengthen me shrink it all say van we need this strength we need to know that we have to discern their very spirit within we have to to that point where we don't have we don't even need to see in action as Christ then as they quoted the census said Moses okay God he gave us man of the king from heaven and they meant the product we need to have that kind of discernment in our midst we need to get all nine spiritual gifts right here operating tongues included interpretation included absolutely okay we have to get beside ourselves they might we have to get free of the Spirit John was in the spirit in the Lord today and the Prophet said the majority of people never receive the Holy Ghost because they don't get in the spirit we must be have brother when the Holy Ghost hits you you must not one thing what he thinks or what he thinks or she and we don't if you've ever been in a spirit you don't care it's just you and the husband what I don't want a man you just were she was loud if you wanted you want to show that you you love him amen I've been there a man absolutely where it doesn't matter you jump and shout and you're just running you thanking God for everything he done for you and the majority what you say is I love you I love you living a man that's the truth that if you've been there at this one fine you're in the holy place there God comes down and he says just worship yes then but then he always does he leaves will be like Oh merci you scored that little depression you know all right all right let's go this was what did he see in that first round he broke through that he opened the door he breaks through into the first chamber in the house of God and look what the Prophet says here this is only found in the church age book now as a well-known historical fact that when this era crept into the church when men began to vie for the office of the bishop he's dealing with the clergy with the result of that position was being given to the more educated materially progressive and politically minded men human knowledge and the program began to take over divine Windom wisdoms place and the Holy Spirit no longer controlled man was taking over the leadership of the Holy Ghost right this indeed was tragic a tragic evil for the bishops began to maintain there was no longer requiring a transparent Christian character to minister either the word or the right to the church was elements and Sarah that ceremony they counted this allowed evil man to do choose to Rend the flap right this is the first church age or right in that area with a man named dr. with the elevation of the deeds are the great ones of the day then oh don't don't help you could not say anything against what those brothers teachers because he's you no no no to the place that was not accorded them in Scripture the next step was handed out of graded titles that build up religion a religious hierarchy for soon there were Archbishop's bishops Cardinals Archbishop's always and poll just to the pot or to the to the Pope right with that nickel a attend doctrine and the egg remaining a lag collimation somebody amalgamation but thank you my wife amalgamation God if you could all you if you guys could always see what kind of school I got food oh Christianity with Babylonians I'm doing Nets results had to be what Ezekiel saw in 810 in the days of the open our day this is not pre 63 this is not 33 when the the voice came down and program the 17th person no no this is when the cloud was formed 26 miles high where no vapor can exist a month later the Prophet goes back to Jeffersonville seven days in a row the angel of God would come down and break every seal and now we're 50 years down the road and look what Ezekiel's finding here in the days of the open book thanks God you see how serious a time point we're at now now remember we're still coming back to the original scriptures in Luke 17 and 14 okay why were they so last November there were three deeds the Nicolaitans have three deeds when it comes to deeds number one they form groups number two they rank within the groups and number three pastors are traveling more than the arrow they use of authority over other and that's very scriptural that's very so I have a whole entire entire study on that so we see is the Nicolaitans I've taken over the house of God now they do it's culturally and there stood before them seventy men of the Ancients of Israel and the midst of them stood a man of prominent two prominent name the son of jazz and I are the son of a chef on chiffon with each man his censer in his hand in a thick cloud of incense went up notice they were praying long prayers very religious weren't a very religious hymn Jesus talked about long prayers incense he said those are prayers of saints right that Bertram's said that was the quote there's someone in scripture about that too but no lines back up with Exodus 1 1 verse 5 and all the souls are youing of Scripture numbers 1116 and the Lord said to Moses gather unto me 70 men of the elder visitor whom thou has known to be the elders of the people and the officers over them and bring them to the tablet and congregation they shall stand with me there and I will come down and talk with you there now the spirit of them which is upon thee and put it upon that look they can go back to the Word of God and say look okay we formed a group so what we have all these abominations so what we're doing according to the scripture 70 very close now in the days the open book when the revelation Phaeton's comes down and it is starting to be preached I took you to the end the open books here we've eaten it it's the end at the end god takes in the house of God what is net saints of God it is time now comes down is now time to sigh and cry for the abominations done the city this marched the time to pray for the latter rain this marks the last time we get a chance to pray is at this time I have been now teaching on the Nicolaitans for five years when it first was come to me and now now you see the time line where we're at I hope you can see this this is getting so clear to me sighing and crying for the abominations done in the city right why because judgment must hit the house of God first I want to ask you something at the angel of the came to the city which was the Holy Spirit dressed in white like to his purity if that angel came tight and went through the Pentecostal churches where in the world would he find men has sighs and cries and begs all night in the city who we mark who is he going to fight we're going to find out we've got the Holy Ghost priest soon yeah I'm not here to bring a flowery sermon I am here to show you what God did not want me to teach on what I wanted to teach on he had my pastor get sick he allowed my pastic is sick I did not have time to study for tomorrow's service and all the hair left was this so this is taking eat [Laughter] you're seeing the book unfolded before you this is not my doing this is what he showed now look at this where do we get the fire of God and he said you get that bunch of lukewarm church members down to the altar and let them pray through and what happens when you pray through in prayer or you break through in prayer till the Holy Ghost sets their soul of fire why did the fourth virgin not go on the rapture because they did not pray through and get the Holy Ghost here's a mystery x21 what exactly took place in here before the mighty rushing wind comes in fills a place like a fire like a fire like a fire with fire and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place does it ever say what they were doing in the scripture but on the day of Pentecost there came a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind and those views had been crying and signed for the abomination did in the city a man hallelujah they have just crucified their Lord and Savior Obama but they not only did they crucify him but he rose again and revealed himself to them and now Jesus has descended and they said look what they've done they've rejected the key and God said go or tarry in Jerusalem and they got so filled with sorrow they said Lord how old he's going to be saved how what are we gonna do for you what was the plan for us Lord reveal it Lord forgive them just as you forgave and forgive them they got in the spirit what in the Holy Ghost key my beautiful what will trigger this latter rain what will get us what will get this church Lord and our church in order vacuum and avoid we need a sigh and cry for the abominations done a city hey man now here's what here's I'm gonna get to this point here I'm gonna get to this point Luke 14 Luke 17 why did these people not care about the coming of the Lord church people the Word of God came to them God sent ministers and people to witness and say let's throw over the pulpit let's go let's get ready it's the coming the Lord they said well I've got oxen I just married this his wife over here and all these things right they're consumed with things the world if you look at Ezekiel there's three sections the first ones the Nicolaitans the second ones something else the third one's even worse but I declare to you tonight there was another group preaching to Lydia Gilligan Ezekiel Evan one more over the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate notice back to the east gate not in the house and done but right at the entrance was another group of ministers and behold at the door the gate five and twenty five twenty men among whom I saw jazz night is tournament your and Felicia the son of benaiah princes of the people great ones and look what their message was then he said to me son of man these are the man that devised missed you and give wicked counts from the city what was their message what was their sermons in the days of the open book which say it is not near let us build brother I heard you got a good job well I know you make so much amount of money and Lord be with you I mean I heard you guys to planning family all these things and just I know you want to build this great three you know a three hundred thousand dollar house will you go ahead and do it brother okay you got all you want this Denali absolutely brother gold just go take the loan out it's good to go hey it's been fifty five years well you want to start a business yeah okay let's look into it we get on there that will start dialing in things in we'll look at financing we'll try and get some loans going what kind of business would you okay all right let's let's just what about the coming of the world its material travail instead of soul travail you live in America you can do whatever you want God is a provider and he'll provide you finances God will bless you you you are spiritual Israel you are blessed what you want F gone so you're C 250 pay your times and God reward you openly more than your coffers more than your bank can even hold why wasn't in Luke 14 and 17 because there was people that were that we're getting the message believers at ease go build that big house man look at the economy we're doing great man God made America great again and they met we got Trump Lona boy shall Trump amen Trump's in town look at the economy booming man bring a job six million jobs got it bank prosperity boom Obama's gone he's blessing Israel will be blessed oh I'm not here to tell you those things tonight I'm here to tell you what was told me six months ago and I waited on that Lord why did he say that I believe the man sincere I think there was some in because that doesn't sound like what I would think he would say now notice it is not near there's direct opposition to the word of the Prophet that is not sticking with the word of the law this is not what the Prophet said because this is what the Word of God said to the Prophet more of the world Lord telling me at last I was sent a man thus saith the Lord God of Israel and and the end is come upon the four corners of all the way over the land it's over God anoints Ezekiel to prophesy the end to this group here this group right here notice there's two men in Ezekiel if you read the rest of chapter is he go prophesized to him that no boy it's over look what happens and it came to pass when I prophesied that pilikia the son of Ania died why did he die because his name is Jehovah has delivered no he hasn't it's over destruction is coming he had Adelita prosperity gospel but God said it's over it's an ending don't put your things on your IRA than your stocks and bonds and all those things were there but what happened Balaam he's succeeding succeeded in weakening Israel what did he do he weakened their camp God let him go and weakened their capital oooh - the whole camp God let him do it he did not stop him he wanted to see who in Israel would stay with the word of dr. Haman who has been let the Spirit of God control their lives let them him lead him guiding into all truth I don't care what this ministers preaching I don't care what this ministers preaching big little who enemy what does the word of God reveal today in our day of the open book and when some doctrine starts that's not the Bible truth it pollutes the whole camp what was their message it is not here go build your big old houses go invest and be something big thing or make start some kind of be something and then finally when they listen to this false teacher coming among them and teach them wrong he weaken the camp and cross your mind oh my now let me show you what happened here notice he says they have they're not convinced that's all they don't believe it they just take their tradition what is their tradition all glowing of God Jesus is coming pretty soon you know that can become a tradition [Laughter] he says brother God is coming soon man why is your camp over here what's your what you want on vacation like in a week in like a month you want to go with us maybe in like a year let's plan a year ahead let's do this with that let's go do this this but Lord's the Lord's coming you it's okay it's gonna cost he'll just a tour or we gotta go do this or do that it has this become a tradition and there's nothing wrong with those things I'm see what I'm saying but when it comes to the coming of the Lord and you don't want to prepare yourself but invest in something else because there's a balance amen he says if you believe that there'd be the biggest cry in the city you ever heard it's a tradition it's not a reality to the people it doesn't it doesn't pan out it proves it doesn't they're not convinced that he's coming in the let me say this in the days of the open book ah I hope you're seeing this oh this is like transparent clear transparent gold one cleared hey men cuz I didn't come up with this now let's continue we're not very much on church buildings in these days because we truly believe with all our heart the Lord Jesus is coming soon the seventh church age messenger did not build a big old mega church and he could have filled it the biggest of anything you need to build he were filled in when Mission airs on the field preaching gospel oh shoot on eating a bun meal day how could a million dollar church in the face how can we build a million dollar church in the face of that that was back then and what about now now these men in chapter 10 were preaching it is not here build your houses well what does they have to do look at the effects of it Ezekiel 12 and I'll scatter every scatter toward everyone all that are about him to help him in on being I'll draw out the sword after them and they shall know that I am the Lord and when I shall scatter them among the nations of this first time in the country's pieces but I will leave a few men of them from the sword and from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whether the comedy show know that I am the Lord there is your third pull for the bride there is a judgment coming there's a destruction coming it's the end and evil draws nigh but God says I'll leave up people Joel - harming people amen that was prophesied again people running the streets wives is taking place this is happening like what Olivia people things because you got wrong you wouldn't serve God you wouldn't rip Heather your sins but at that time it'll be too late now why and the word of Lord came to me saying son of man what is that proverb that you have in Atlanta notice they had preached these 25 men and preached this so much what is this proverb that you have in the land of it were saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth these 25 men who stood at the east gate where Moses said that's where Moses camped in the Old Testament at the entrance of the east toward salvation towards the altar the brass ladder the holy place the holiest of Holies they started right at the entrance and they preached this and it affected the people so much it became a proverb it became a saying we got plenty of time okay doing great take ease it's okay those eyelids get a little heavy and just relax a little bit just calm down yourself God knows your heart it's gonna be okay hey you know what was said to me and he pulls it from a quote and he said you know brother and I said no it's not gonna be that and you didn't he didn't he didn't bite back I said no it's not gonna be that something as I said knows why is he trying to ease my spirit and I set that on a shelf from what six seven months until God brought this to me in Texas and I read until oh my goodness in the days of the open book there would be people trying to calm you down to take the fire off of you for lost souls to to pray all night to sigh and cry for the abominations in the city it wants you to just relax and focus all a week plenty of time fifty-five years this could go tundra you know brother man said it could be a thousand years and our great great great great great agree Mike hmm well let's see what can I do what's Mike it's okay but if our goals if we do not let the Lord take control and alter our 10-year goal our five-year goal if we do not ask the Lord why why did they fail in the promised land because Josh Layton system came right in ty tonight Lord what do you want me to do let me give you a testimony I was praying I was talking to somebody I said I want to do this for you and I was serious about it I want to do for something for somebody and I would come home one day and I go into prayer closet and I said lord I want to do this this is this what we did have me do the next day I said lord I want to do this this this this what we have you do the day after that brother books Causton hey when the Holy Ghost told me to call him I said he did for what he said he said you would know I said brother Felix praise God well I was planning on do this this this he says well the Holy Ghost once I do not know what to tell you but I believe he wants he knows that I would tell you like I said brother I'm planning this this this he's nobody to do this is this thank you brother but in my heart I wanted to do this but I I consulted the Lord first and God heard my prayer I had faith that he heard my prayer and he heard it and he did not he chose not to speak to me but he had anointed another son here gifted I said call him and tell him what to do amen [Laughter] set your goals but ask God what would you have [Laughter] amen if he comes today all right it becomes 20 years now it's all right I'm just gonna go the way I mean here Lord if you can use me anywhere Here I am Lord if it's a hundred years from today it was my great great great grin I'm showing you the quote they're using to calm people down because we've got to be looking for right now notice the spirit in the Prophet was saying right but we don't know it could be possibly gonna hurt us now it could be 500 years a thousand ten thousand I don't know nobody knows but a Coquille he comes after the days of the open book in that generation to see that shall not perish till all things come to pass and God opens the book in that time period and the message is it's over saints of God I don't want you to get I don't want to take any fire from you things to be at ease from one second about the coming of the Lord it could be any day any moment any second insanity is all around us total craziness boys don't know there boys and girls on algebra you I mean there's a there must be another level I've been seen it we're there we've crossed the threshold we we bypassed at America's bypassing 56 we've got to be ready tell them they're for the state the Lord I will make this proverb to cease I'm already started here at six months ago I've heard it already heard this and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but they shelled so but say unto them the days are at me and see to God the days are at hand prepare your hearts make sure we're full the Holy Ghost you know the hardest thing for me to do is pray but this must be we must make this our mission the days are hand in the effect of every vision for I am the Lord I will speak and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass and so it will be no longer prolonged see there was a time of prolonging there was a time of silence where God just let the people go and do what with was giving them they were given a storehouse of Joseph's one thousand two hundred three hundred sermons what they do did they stay with the word were they calming the people did they heal the people were they getting them healed or not that was up to them but God said it is now time judgment is at hand let's bow our heads
