[34:46] finish in the Book of Daniel praise God
[34:48] preached and taught all the way through
[34:50] that so very thankful for God showing us
[34:53] his word finding up with the Word of God
[34:55] revelation 2 verse 20 praise God
[34:58] revelation to Revelation 2 verse 20 the
[35:16] scripture says notwithstanding I have a
[35:17] few things against thee because thou
[35:19] sufferest that woman Jezebel which
[35:22] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[35:25] and to seduce my servants to commit
[35:28] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[35:32] two idols it's just our heads of order
[35:35] crab I mean on your heart just make it
[35:37] known unto God this morning that when
[35:40] Father Lord we love you your God we just
[35:42] bow our heads to in order to use this my

[36:02] correct Lord God and to Lord inspire us
[36:06] Lord to walk after your word with all of
[36:09] our hearts Souls - strength we'll take
[36:12] this time making yours orderly for
[36:15] another week to serve your lord help us
[36:17] not to take this life for granted
[36:18] Lourdes as I saw with in company or this
[36:21] week dear god help us never to take it
[36:23] for granted or help us Lord to be
[36:26] mindful in your presence give us wisdom
[36:28] that we might apply our hearts to
[36:29] understanding Lord God teach us to
[36:32] number our days the Bible said we might
[36:34] apply our hearts to vice versa - thus
[36:36] our thank you for your mercy Lord
[36:38] speakers now in Jesus Christ's name
[36:40] George said may God bless your feet see
[36:43] praise God
[36:51] let's look at this thought here this
[36:53] morning we learn some quotations here
[36:56] they're going to be blessed
[36:57] praise God and then once again next
[37:02] Sunday web carry answer just one service
[37:04] next Monday forward to the fellowship
[37:06] with the Saints by God's grace so let me
[37:09] get the quotes up here I hope I liked it
[37:11] I like to show and I know you like to
[37:13] see them praise God so we look at the
[37:18] start here on this woman Jezebel we look
[37:22] at this a little bit further this
[37:23] morning you know this topics always been
[37:25] a blessing to me and I guess part of
[37:29] that was because I preached us on
[37:32] Wednesday night I preached a sermon
[37:33] called repeal of Jezebel on a Wednesday
[37:36] night a few years ago and that was a
[37:38] night Elijah one to give his heart to
[37:40] Lord and he was baptized that following
[37:42] Sunday brother amen
[37:44] I believe
[37:45] not mistaken was the Thursday I'm not
[37:46] sure which side it was but this topic of
[37:49] Jezebel and Ahab and Elijah has always
[37:52] been a crucial one to me because by Babs
[37:55] that's repeating today you know when you
[37:57] pick up your pen and write remember that
[37:59] portion we preach on that this year and
[38:01] gone through that and show that that's
[38:03] repeating in America today but this
[38:05] topic in particular of course meant a
[38:07] lot to me because of that with ya on the
[38:10] Sunday I preached why we're against the
[38:12] nominations amen came into the message
[38:14] then that lens that preachers spell of
[38:16] Jezebel if a lot of you got baptized so
[38:19] because you have that ties to you so
[38:21] this is a wonderful topic and we never
[38:23] want to forget God's presence in our
[38:25] lives
[38:25] Amen man so we're thankful for that so
[38:27] we read our text and remember that's the
[38:29] fourth church age the longest church age
[38:33] brother Graham says you know one of the
[38:35] reasons was so long because the grip
[38:37] that the spirit of Jezebel had upon the
[38:40] churches you know especially the Roman
[38:41] Catholic and so forth she wouldn't she
[38:44] had that grip on there and God had to
[38:46] bring out a Luther you know Martin
[38:48] Luther which we'll get to soon but the
[38:50] messenger was to love a true man of God
[38:51] that converted almost the whole country
[38:53] of Scotland and here's just the reminder
[38:56] you know he dip it up he died about ten
[38:58] years before the church age actually
[39:00] started but his ministry flowed into
[39:02] that church age because it was so well
[39:05] grounded and established by his
[39:06] preaching ministry so we're still
[39:10] looking at the Thyatira church age
[39:11] tonight chart today this morning so
[39:14] we're in the section of the rebuke where
[39:17] brother Branham talks about the rebuke
[39:19] that Christ gave to the church we ran
[39:23] our Scripture and the Bible says because
[39:25] thou sufferest or tolerate so the false
[39:28] church was allowing or tolerating
[39:31] Jezebel to rule them but the true church
[39:34] was not are too bad about that we have a
[39:36] choice as a church this morning we have
[39:37] a choice who are we going to let rule
[39:39] the church or you like the Holy Ghost
[39:41] for the church or the spirit of Jezebel
[39:43] I think we'd all say let the Holy Ghost
[39:46] through the church a bed but that's the
[39:48] happen we got to keep all our sins out
[39:50] they've got to stay under the blood net
[39:53] dip that one step away programs that
[39:55] will get us off of the lead
[39:57] ship of the Holy Spirit in the
[39:58] permissive will of God and I can provide
[40:01] scripture taking the permissive God can
[40:03] prove you're actually insane mentally
[40:06] you say prove Amell Jeff's short Balaam
[40:08] bainham was given thus saith the Lord by
[40:10] God God said walk this way he went back
[40:13] and said well can I go God said fine go
[40:15] and the Bible said that the donkey
[40:18] rebuked him because the madness of the
[40:20] Prophet the madness you see someone has
[40:24] to be having mental trouble uh mental
[40:27] problems you know we'd say demonic
[40:30] influence upon their minds in order to
[40:32] take the permissive will of God many
[40:34] times we see if people will take the
[40:36] permissive will of God in their
[40:37] marriages or raising their children or
[40:40] they'll take some permissive will of God
[40:41] the church they choose or decisions
[40:44] other the major decisions they'll make
[40:45] in life they'll take the permissive will
[40:47] of God rather than the perfect will of
[40:49] God
[40:49] it shows that they haven't prayed
[40:52] through to find the mind of Christ god
[40:54] help us to pray through until we're sure
[40:56] we've got the perfect little guy if the
[40:59] bible said we can prove the perfect will
[41:01] of God
[41:02] that's a remedy romans chapter 12 the
[41:05] Bible says transform your minds by the
[41:07] renewing of your minds
[41:08] that he'd able to prove that which is
[41:10] the perfect will of God
[41:11] he had glory now brother Graham drops
[41:15] down to verse 23 and he says I want to
[41:17] give you a proof of a great truth I've
[41:19] been bringing to your attention all of
[41:21] my may have said verse 23 Jesus said I
[41:23] will kill her children with death and
[41:25] all the churches so he's talked about
[41:28] multiple churches now shall know that I
[41:30] am he which searches the reigns of the
[41:32] hearts I've been saying right along that
[41:34] there are actually two churches in every
[41:36] church age though the spirit speaks to
[41:38] both of them in each age as though they
[41:40] were but one here is plainly stated that
[41:43] there are churches and it stays just as
[41:44] plainly that some of those churches most
[41:47] evidently do not know that he is the one
[41:50] who searches the reigns of the hearts so
[41:53] there's always two churches right
[41:54] there's the false church and the true
[41:56] church and the true church knows that
[41:59] God is constantly searching their hearts
[42:01] that's why their sins go before that
[42:03] remember two Sundays you only preach on
[42:05] that we must put our sins go before us
[42:07] we must confess them that they go to God
[42:10] now and God
[42:10] can put them in the sea of forgetfulness
[42:12] that's right but man said God is going
[42:15] to prove to them that is so now that
[42:18] what churches will be those that do not
[42:19] know the truth of course see the false
[42:21] fine group because the true believers
[42:24] certainly know that judgment begins web
[42:26] at the house of God you're in a great
[42:29] place this morning because if you
[42:31] confess your sin this morning if you
[42:33] serve Christ this morning and so stout
[42:36] rice you're wrong and and believe unto a
[42:39] new start in life or something like that
[42:41] that your judgment then you're already
[42:43] judged and you won't be judged at the
[42:45] great white throne we must be judged now
[42:48] in this life praise God that were not
[42:51] judged later at the white throne
[42:52] judgment he says that they they've been
[42:56] god-fearing judge themselves that they
[42:59] be not judged so true believers come to
[43:02] the house of God allow themselves to be
[43:04] judged or corrected I want to reduce our
[43:08] put this quote up here I watch your eyes
[43:09] here I was going over to light again I
[43:11] just found this last week in a really
[43:12] blessing brother have said even when his
[43:14] mother was dying he came to church to
[43:16] preach and he said it's always a
[43:17] privilege to come to the house the Lord
[43:19] I have never in my life ever seen one
[43:23] time now regretted to come to his house
[43:26] looks like that
[43:27] Amen I thought you had a fight
[43:29] encourages this morning I've never seen
[43:32] that he's seen that either where I have
[43:33] a regretted to go and worship God in
[43:35] God's house but see the wives version
[43:38] the wise group knows that we must go to
[43:40] the house of God confess our sins and be
[43:42] change if not we'll be judged for not
[43:44] taking care of our sins not putting them
[43:47] under the blood the RAM said you must be
[43:49] sure the Holy Spirit will bring forth
[43:51] the holy life and if the desires in your
[43:54] heart if you have to force yourself
[43:55] constantly to try to press and do what's
[43:57] right at the world so hunger and in you
[44:00] then there is something wrong how many
[44:03] can same internet if you have to force
[44:05] yourself to do right all the time and
[44:07] you're not walking the spirit
[44:09] something's wrong because when the
[44:10] spirits going through you you want to do
[44:12] right you have to force yourself out of
[44:15] fear or duty or some feeling like that
[44:18] you do it because you love to do it the
[44:21] Holy Spirit in you will not hunger for
[44:23] the word
[44:24] it will hunger for God if it's hard for
[44:27] you to go to church and press yourself
[44:30] to come when the church is open there
[44:32] are something wrong with that spirit
[44:34] it's trying to keep you away from God
[44:37] Mari the Spirit of God will run you
[44:40] right straight where to the church every
[44:44] time the doors are open her fellowship
[44:48] it's a pretty easy concept if you love
[44:50] God God's fear will drive you to hear
[44:52] God's Word and then you must always say
[44:55] we're the kingdom of God is where the
[44:57] glory of God is pouring out stay where
[44:59] you can be spiritually fed day and night
[45:01] then the first thing you know if not
[45:05] separation comes in the home and
[45:07] worldliness and they get lifted up so
[45:11] people don't stay under the anointing
[45:13] immediately they'll see the effects of
[45:15] the evil anointing in their home life
[45:16] how many believe that by God's grace you
[45:19] believe that if you don't stay in two of
[45:21] the house of God your own home will be a
[45:23] place of sin and unbelief
[45:25] that's right it'll be a place of
[45:27] disrespect for the Holy Spirit instead
[45:29] of honoring and loving the Holy Spirit
[45:32] they'll start offending the Holy Spirit
[45:34] in their homes so see me muscle Rams and
[45:37] above all things but God in this house
[45:39] above everything else if you put God's
[45:41] house first that your house will get
[45:43] line as well amen now program again says
[45:47] this I'll kill her children with death
[45:49] I'm sorry this is the scripture and all
[45:51] the churches shall know that I am he
[45:54] which searches the reins and hearts I've
[45:55] been saying right along that there are
[45:57] actually two churches but the spirits
[45:59] folks speaks to both of them in each age
[46:01] as though they were but one now I want
[46:05] to say this all in here maybe you
[46:07] haven't read this lady I think you'll be
[46:08] blessed now why does God call these
[46:11] churches as churches I'm sorry these
[46:13] churches and churches even though there
[46:15] are the false fine why does God called
[46:17] the false fine churches the truth of the
[46:20] matter is that they are Christians but
[46:21] they are not Christians of the Spirit
[46:23] they're Christians of the flesh and
[46:25] that's something sinners backsliders
[46:29] remember ready to go to hell and go to
[46:32] church are still Christians but they're
[46:34] only Christians
[46:35] they're sitting after the flesh because
[46:37] they're sitting in a building that's
[46:38] common Church that's the only way
[46:40] they're a Christian they're not
[46:42] Christian by the spirit and they're not
[46:43] a Christian by the soul oh my there are
[46:46] only Christians by the flesh because
[46:48] they physically take their body to the
[46:50] house of God all right what a striking
[46:52] statement they're bearing the name of
[46:55] Christ in vain because mark seven seven
[46:57] says howbeit bang do they worship Me
[46:59] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[47:00] of men but indeed they are Christians
[47:03] for what else could they be a
[47:06] is a that is his religion no
[47:08] matter what he how he lives it because
[47:10] he subscribes in theory to what the
[47:12] Quran teaches in the same way a
[47:14] Christian is a Christian as long as he
[47:16] subscribes to the fact that Jesus the
[47:18] Son of God born of a virgin
[47:20] crucified and died and rose again and
[47:22] that he's the savior of mankind etc he's
[47:25] a nominal Christian alongs the church
[47:27] but he is not a true or spiritual
[47:30] believer that kind of leavers one who's
[47:33] been baptized in the body of Christ and
[47:35] is a member of him but nonetheless is in
[47:39] God's order that the tears grow up with
[47:41] the weak and they are not to be uprooted
[47:43] that is the command of God their day for
[47:46] biting and burning has come but not yet
[47:49] see how the binding hasn't happened yet
[47:51] the World Council of Churches in the
[47:54] Roman Catholic Church have not found
[47:55] together yet but they will we know that
[47:58] so any tear that sits in a building of
[48:01] our crisis preach can be called a
[48:03] Christian by the flesh but not according
[48:06] to the mine their divine is not
[48:07] transformed by the Word of God right and
[48:09] their soul is not born again they don't
[48:12] have a life in their soul that's right
[48:14] so the Spirit is speaking to this this
[48:17] mixed group on one hand he's praising on
[48:21] the other hand he's rebuking he has told
[48:25] what is right with the true believer now
[48:27] he warns what the false mind must do if
[48:29] it is thus and justified before God so I
[48:34] want to read this again I'm going to
[48:36] take that one quote right there one hand
[48:38] he's praised the other hand is Ruby the
[48:40] true church at Thyatira they were
[48:42] praised for what their works their
[48:45] charity their service faith
[48:49] and works again because their works
[48:50] increase as the church age went on right
[48:53] God prays that for all these things now
[48:56] the false church were rebuked for
[48:58] allowing the spirit of Jezebel to teach
[49:01] and seduce the people into living sinful
[49:04] lives everybody sees that by God's grace
[49:06] Christ will compliment
[49:08] he'll praise the church but then he'll
[49:10] also rebuke the other churches right
[49:12] praise the true church rebuke the false
[49:15] church amen
[49:18] now that's the building the foundation
[49:19] for this that woman Jezebel motivator
[49:23] says this now this is a great thought I
[49:26] hope you'll catch it here today by God's
[49:27] grace I preached it before I want to
[49:29] just review this a little bit the
[49:31] Apostle James showed us the course that
[49:35] sin takes how many other course of sin
[49:37] it's in James chapter one every man is
[49:40] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[49:42] lust and enticed and when lust hath
[49:46] conceived and bringeth forth sin and sin
[49:50] when it is finished bringeth forth death
[49:53] now that's a picture of exactly what is
[49:56] happening in the church ages so this is
[49:59] the course of sin it starts off with
[50:02] lust and then blust conceives which
[50:06] leads the sin which often leads to death
[50:09] how many two recognizing your own life
[50:11] I'm going to recognize it in each life
[50:14] he first lusted all my mom said she
[50:17] looked at the fruit and lusted after the
[50:18] fruit of adultery right
[50:20] she looked at lusting after that then
[50:22] that lust conceded to an act and then
[50:25] that act produced unbelief right and the
[50:28] unbelief and the Word of God produced
[50:30] death that's exactly right
[50:32] all nine that's exactly what we see from
[50:36] the scripture now now it was a picture
[50:40] of exactly what's happening in the
[50:41] church ages so this course of sin is
[50:44] happening all the time in the church
[50:46] changes as sin started nothing but a
[50:48] feeling so the death of the church
[50:50] started with a simple little notice
[50:53] deeds of the Nicolaitans from the deeds
[50:56] it went to a doctrine from a doctrine it
[50:59] embraced the power of the state and the
[51:01] introduction of paganism now in this age
[51:03] it travels on until it will find itself
[51:06] in the lake of fire for that is exactly
[51:08] where it's going to end up in the second
[51:11] death the Ritter saying that by God's
[51:13] grace the course of sin I'm going to
[51:16] show you a chart here I think it will
[51:17] help you by God's grace this is the
[51:19] course of sin there's four steps to sin
[51:23] as we showed right here and the example
[51:25] I gave was Eve first she loves it so all
[51:28] night that might be good and then Plus
[51:30] conceived it started something about
[51:34] started the act and then that were to
[51:36] sin and unbelief which produced death
[51:41] not only that but run around teaches
[51:43] that the same spirit he said work
[51:46] through the entire church ages well
[51:48] items Jesus identified the Antichrist
[51:50] fear during the church ages he's
[51:52] identifies it as a horse rider
[51:55] hallelujah and it wasn't just this is
[51:57] just my idea brother amen it was thus
[51:59] saith the Lord the Antichrist fear is
[52:02] identified as four horse riders like
[52:04] let's be Church and it's now saved the
[52:06] Lord but not only are the horse riders
[52:09] that sent the Lord the beasts are now
[52:11] say the largest would have hallelujah
[52:13] again exactly right so the white horse
[52:16] no medicine is a teaching ministry they
[52:19] start with deeds and then it turns into
[52:21] a doctrine they teach and then it turns
[52:24] into war against the true church which
[52:26] we see in churches someone will start a
[52:28] war Satan but relics that God won't let
[52:30] you stay in a honeymoon he'll inject
[52:32] somebody with poison he said to let them
[52:34] sit down to the real quietness of the
[52:35] fellowship and check them with poison
[52:38] and then try to divide the church I've
[52:40] never seen it happen to a church it
[52:41] happens every to church and it does you
[52:43] Satan hates every Jew Church so first
[52:46] thing is somebody gets us something off
[52:48] the word they start doing something
[52:49] that's not really scriptural and then
[52:51] they defend themselves and build a
[52:53] doctrine a false doctrine and then they
[52:55] start a war and attacking other people
[52:57] in the church that's also been that
[52:59] usually leads to a church splitting and
[53:01] then the program says the third thing is
[53:03] the money they start building their own
[53:04] Kingdom their own ministry their own
[53:06] following today is the easiest quit or
[53:09] data you ever get a following right a
[53:11] following on Instagram
[53:12] Facebook you get a following faster than
[53:14] any other day right now and you do it
[53:17] just as the privacy of your home with
[53:18] the internet and so forth but the last
[53:21] rider was the fail horse rider which was
[53:24] dead you can see the course of sitting
[53:26] out through the Bible it's through the
[53:28] entire Bible programs in Joel chapter 2
[53:31] the Palmer worm is the one that comes
[53:33] out of the egg
[53:34] the caterpillar starts crawling around
[53:35] consuming the can't worm gets a little
[53:37] bigger and the adult locust flies around
[53:40] it consumes the whole harvest that's the
[53:43] four step process of sin it's our go
[53:45] real cute look at that baby what it is
[53:47] look at that little baby coming out of
[53:49] there oh my program said you better kill
[53:52] that baby Amalekite on hello church you
[53:55] better cue a little you see little
[53:57] sin your life you better kill that or
[53:59] it's going to grow up it's going to
[54:01] mature if you keep feeding that less
[54:04] it's going to let muscles going to
[54:05] concede and that's going to lead to sin
[54:07] it has to lead to spiritual death you
[54:09] better kill and crucify anything that it
[54:12] solves itself against the knowledge of
[54:14] God it's exactly right
[54:16] and I know if you remember this but
[54:18] Abraham had to defeat four kings before
[54:20] he had a communion with Melchizedek I'm
[54:24] a man in a defeat for kings and MFL
[54:28] Shinar there's Babylon Arioch of
[54:32] al-assad children a over of 11 title of
[54:36] Nations he defeated four kids and after
[54:39] the victory of the four kings and the
[54:41] salvation of lot the foolish virgin then
[54:43] he had fellowship with Melchizedek again
[54:45] he had communion amen and that's what we
[54:48] have if we can a safety score stage of
[54:50] said we'll have communion with the high
[54:52] priest Jesus Christ an end it's exactly
[54:56] right the lordís mourning the course of
[54:59] sin but also because of this program
[55:02] solidus and a revelation of and he
[55:05] preached the message the retina message
[55:07] restoration the bride tree and he said
[55:10] because Satan attacks enforce he said
[55:12] God will work enforce you love the Lord
[55:16] ahead so what is it you have the four
[55:18] annoying things align our ex mattifying
[55:20] you lioness boldness and pow
[55:23] the Ox is a sacrificial life for Christ
[55:25] the man is wisdom to know the word and
[55:28] the fly Eagle is prophetic revelation
[55:31] this is tight by Matthew Mark Luke and
[55:35] John guarding the book of Acts the real
[55:37] Church of the Living God amen and this
[55:40] program said in frustration sobriety
[55:42] tree was also seen from Luther Lesley
[55:45] Azusa Street and to the message that God
[55:47] gave brother Branham it's exactly right
[55:49] and we also saw in the dry bones from
[55:52] Ezekiel 37 if you haven't read that
[55:54] recently whether I post that on
[55:57] restoration of the bride tree in Christ
[55:58] the mystery of God revealed he said
[56:00] first the bones have to unite together
[56:02] then the sinew and the flesh comes on
[56:05] them and then the skin comes on the body
[56:07] but then a prophetic word of those saith
[56:10] the Lord amen
[56:11] must come upon the body and the body
[56:13] comes alive and see prophecy at the say
[56:16] the Lord and the Ministry of a prophet
[56:19] will give life to the people I because
[56:21] that prophet is screaming with thus
[56:23] sayeth the Lord and thus saith the Lord
[56:25] is a revelation and it's the revelation
[56:27] of God that overcomes the gates of Hell
[56:30] amen glory hallelujah it's exactly right
[56:33] see that so we need us just as Satan
[56:37] covers of the course of Sid God gives us
[56:39] the course of Holy Ghost victory it's
[56:42] exactly right program said member you
[56:45] remember the Antichrist number 4 so
[56:47] because Satan used for God had to use
[56:50] four and then he says this he said don't
[56:53] remember all the days you're like these
[56:55] beasts are correct it's not safe the
[56:58] Lord so just as the horse riders with us
[57:02] say the Lord so are the beasts that save
[57:04] the Lord you like that if you understand
[57:08] that church then you will not miss the
[57:10] power of the revelation of the seals
[57:12] it's more than symbols it's exposing how
[57:16] Satan tries to ten each one of us into a
[57:19] life of sin but it's also a beautiful
[57:21] victory of the power that God gives us
[57:24] so we can overcome all of Satan's
[57:26] devices and okay or if it's just a book
[57:30] to you assemble it we'll never conquer
[57:32] the gates of Hell but if it's Christ
[57:34] being a real
[57:35] you and receiving a power that flying
[57:37] eagle then you'll live the life of
[57:40] Christ you'll have Christ in your mix
[57:41] and you'll love Jesus Christ amen
[57:44] you'll be a real Christian up there what
[57:46] a QR hallelujah you'll be a real
[57:48] Christian exactly right that was review
[57:53] I preached on that little bit before
[57:55] about how to expanded does that help by
[57:56] God's grace you see the number four you
[57:58] see the power of the seven seals and all
[58:00] these things that's why we need it
[58:01] because it's Holy Ghost power amen it's
[58:04] flying eagle power I believe has a whole
[58:08] crowd of dogs you God was flying out
[58:10] again fire zero is found in the
[58:14] denunciation this prophetess Jessica and
[58:18] to understand exactly why he did not
[58:20] oopss her so we have to look up her in
[58:23] the history of the Bible she did back
[58:26] there we'll know what's going on at this
[58:28] time now what I'm going to do is by
[58:32] God's grace this morning as I've studied
[58:33] and prayed I just felt that to go back
[58:37] to the meaning of thyroid tira so if you
[58:39] read the church age book under fire tear
[58:41] of the meaning brother man tells us his
[58:43] dominating female so we want to look at
[58:46] that and then we'll jump ahead to the
[58:48] rebuke maybe next week Lord willing when
[58:50] we get there by the grace of the Lord
[58:52] these things ought to be more to life to
[58:54] us praise God
[58:55] more than life the Word of God
[58:57] hallelujah and this is where we're going
[59:01] to start bringing down some quotes you
[59:02] know for the home life because if we're
[59:05] not careful church we fall under we get
[59:07] a little lazy on God praise the Lord if
[59:10] we go to the lazy on Godman we lose the
[59:14] leadership and the the strength of the
[59:17] Lord that we ought to have for the joy
[59:18] of the Lord is your strength right and
[59:21] what's that first anointing that lion
[59:23] anointing is bogus it's straight to
[59:25] combat even the littlest tiniest little
[59:28] dieter doctrine remember the advanced
[59:32] stage of this if you let a little sit
[59:33] hang around and get greater and greater
[59:35] is that now you are slave to a woman
[59:38] right you're a slave to the Jezebel
[59:41] sphere or the false Church system or a
[59:44] slave just Satan said I try script
[59:46] nobody see that but it starts off or you
[59:48] must have the bulb
[59:49] of the power of the Holy Spirit to cast
[59:52] out any little feeling any little lust
[59:54] you must be able to cast that down and
[59:56] in order to conquer and come to the
[59:59] fullness of Christ that's right the
[1:00:02] dimensions most worthy to note that the
[1:00:04] married name Thyatira means dominating
[1:00:06] female
[1:00:07] thus this age is characterized by a
[1:00:10] dominant force a force that Ruth of
[1:00:12] sleep invades all everything so the
[1:00:18] spirit of Jezebel tries to invade
[1:00:20] everything so not only the church is
[1:00:23] right but the pastures but the land T
[1:00:27] that Jezebel spirit wants to get into
[1:00:29] the churches in the homes in politics
[1:00:32] how many notes and politics the Jezebel
[1:00:35] spirit conquering all right boss worship
[1:00:38] woman worship and once again in every
[1:00:40] sphere of life it's in the school system
[1:00:42] I can see that as I work in schools you
[1:00:45] can see that it invades one's control of
[1:00:48] everything submit to the woman submit to
[1:00:50] the woman submit to the woman but God
[1:00:52] say no my leadership is the right way
[1:00:55] let's accept the leadership of God
[1:00:57] through the man a man and in our case
[1:01:00] that Christ rule us a man that the Holy
[1:01:03] Ghost lead us out of it that Christ lead
[1:01:05] the whole that a man except the
[1:01:07] leadership of Christ that be strong in
[1:01:09] the Lord and lead us home like a real
[1:01:11] man of God that's exactly right
[1:01:14] see this dominating female invades
[1:01:18] everything conquers all and despotic lis
[1:01:22] controls I don't know if I said that
[1:01:24] right now the dominating female is the
[1:01:26] greatest curse in the world why is this
[1:01:32] man the world ever saw with Solomon and
[1:01:34] he said if anybody would know that it
[1:01:36] would be solid because Saladin let all
[1:01:39] his wives deceive him and took it very
[1:01:43] far away from the Lord but now we know
[1:01:46] he's saved right but by he's sure Baxter
[1:01:48] there was a back sitting King it was
[1:01:51] Solomon and here's the scripture
[1:01:54] Ecclesiastes 7:25 now we're not gonna
[1:01:57] read all this I'm skip down I find more
[1:01:59] bitter than death the woman now Simon
[1:02:01] is more bitter than death the woman
[1:02:04] whose heart is snares and nets at her
[1:02:08] hands as bands like handcuffs
[1:02:11] we threw up in the eber so there's
[1:02:14] nothing this is more bitter than death a
[1:02:16] woman that ones are controlling and bind
[1:02:19] up and control everything so be careful
[1:02:23] when people say well I'm a control
[1:02:26] person I need a lot of control I've got
[1:02:28] to have a lot of control be careful
[1:02:30] you'd want to take too much control
[1:02:32] under the church the spirit of Jezebel
[1:02:36] was to control and capture her prey in a
[1:02:41] net right her heart is a net in her
[1:02:45] heart she wants to control something in
[1:02:47] it and lock them up and and have her way
[1:02:50] instead of somebody else having their
[1:02:51] way I say let the Holy Ghost have his
[1:02:56] way man I don't want my way I was all he
[1:02:58] goes to have his way hey man and that
[1:03:02] way we'll be the word that's how I know
[1:03:04] it's his way it'll be the word Amen
[1:03:06] that's right now look the sinner shall
[1:03:09] be taken buyers to see all those people
[1:03:11] that are the domination churches there
[1:03:13] have a very hard time making it to
[1:03:14] heaven because the sinner gets to see by
[1:03:17] that woman the Bible said everyone that
[1:03:20] worships the Beast or their image will
[1:03:22] have their part of the lake of fire
[1:03:24] everyone everyone that goes along with
[1:03:27] that it's a scary things I have friends
[1:03:28] in that I'm waiting for the time of God
[1:03:30] to kind of correct them on some things
[1:03:32] but they're all excited about you know
[1:03:34] the the oneworld movements the lecherous
[1:03:36] movements that they have around America
[1:03:38] last year they had one in Washington DC
[1:03:39] in the summer it got so hot they had to
[1:03:41] cancel up midway through I believe that
[1:03:44] was God's judgment you know that's
[1:03:45] properly but anyway anyone that accepts
[1:03:50] that control of a woman at a nomination
[1:03:52] system Antichrist system the Bible says
[1:03:55] is a sinner an unbeliever they don't
[1:03:57] believe the Bible now we remember that
[1:04:01] remember this one man amongst a thousand
[1:04:03] I found but a woman amongst all those
[1:04:05] have I not found remember someone had
[1:04:07] 700 wives and 300
[1:04:09] so he knew a thousand women he could
[1:04:12] have had one good one out all of those
[1:04:14] might have been I don't know I might
[1:04:15] have been a couple like in the Song of
[1:04:17] Solomon that first one might make a good
[1:04:19] one when we preach on that but he had a
[1:04:21] hard time finding a good woman but you
[1:04:23] know I church he surrounded himself with
[1:04:25] evil women he was partly responsible for
[1:04:29] it
[1:04:29] if so you surround yourself a trash
[1:04:31] you're going to smell my trash if you
[1:04:34] surround yourself with holiness they're
[1:04:35] going to be holy gave a head
[1:04:37] I tried he surrounded herself with
[1:04:39] sinners you're gonna look like a sinner
[1:04:40] if you're surrounding yourself with
[1:04:42] Saints are going to be separated like
[1:04:44] they are hey man right here's what the
[1:04:48] Bible said where's Ford 4 came to pass
[1:04:51] when Solomon was old his wives turned
[1:04:54] away his heart after other gods his
[1:04:58] heart was not perfect so Solomon could
[1:05:00] not go to church as he got older he
[1:05:02] could not go to church and say I've got
[1:05:03] a pure heart what a valuable thing it is
[1:05:06] to us if we can have a pure heart this
[1:05:07] morning his walk with God didn't grow
[1:05:10] closer to God he didn't fall more in
[1:05:12] love with God he got further away from
[1:05:13] God a church be honest with ourselves
[1:05:16] are we getting closer to God or falling
[1:05:18] more in love with God are we growing
[1:05:20] further if we're growing further some
[1:05:22] evil spirit has grabbed to all of our
[1:05:24] hearts in our mind we must cast that
[1:05:26] aside and we must let Christ help our
[1:05:29] hearts be pure before dried church when
[1:05:33] you say oh he was I don't wish you well
[1:05:36] that's what the Bible said about the New
[1:05:37] Testament people have so many items are
[1:05:40] not even aware of it their family
[1:05:41] becomes an item when they put the family
[1:05:43] above the word of God right and they put
[1:05:45] vehicles and finances uh entertainment
[1:05:49] sports you put all these things above
[1:05:51] the Word of God it's officially become
[1:05:53] your idol and John adds his last book
[1:05:56] and here's a hot flash but but the first
[1:05:58] book and he says keep yourselves from
[1:06:00] idols amen you believe that by God's
[1:06:05] grace keep yourself from an any Idol
[1:06:08] anything that's more important than the
[1:06:10] Lord Jesus Christ as I told you that
[1:06:14] I'll share it for lohanthony a young
[1:06:16] Anthony sorry that little young he's
[1:06:18] probably good to me but God just said
[1:06:20] he's here I didn't give my life to
[1:06:22] Lord's house
[1:06:22] 18 I was raised in a Pentecostal church
[1:06:24] with his spoken tongues all the time
[1:06:25] interpreted my mom was healed of cancer
[1:06:27] I was in second grade so she's still
[1:06:29] alive today God is a healer I know I
[1:06:31] knew God was a healer by many idols as
[1:06:34] soon as I got the car turn on my radio
[1:06:36] rock n roll music and that K that was an
[1:06:39] idol for me I always wanted a girlfriend
[1:06:41] that was the idol for me always watch
[1:06:44] sports all day Sunday and Saturday
[1:06:45] no time for God that was the idol for me
[1:06:47] I had the wrong friends I put friends
[1:06:51] above the word that was an idol for me I
[1:06:53] had so many idols that I got into drugs
[1:06:55] there were things like that but by the
[1:06:57] grace of God through the power of the
[1:06:59] Holy Spirit I've been able to take each
[1:07:01] one of those idols cast them down and
[1:07:03] stop them to dust by God's grace and
[1:07:06] take that Gossip Girl is a Brooke Kent
[1:07:08] rowdy and like a Hezekiah and Josiah did
[1:07:12] because there's power in the cross of
[1:07:15] Jesus they met there's power there and
[1:07:18] we must keep ourselves from idols you
[1:07:21] must be honest enough to say listen I've
[1:07:23] made an idol God forgive me of this I
[1:07:26] passing this out I'm destroying it
[1:07:29] and I'm getting rid of it by the grace
[1:07:30] of God remember this type it's been so
[1:07:33] many years since I preaches I don't
[1:07:35] think by the amens ever see this type I
[1:07:37] preach this it I have a one time about
[1:07:39] Rachel with her gods remember when she
[1:07:41] took the gods of Laban I preached in
[1:07:43] Iowa one time and the brother and one of
[1:07:45] the brothers walked up afterwards he
[1:07:47] said you know just listen to radio
[1:07:48] preacher yesterday and I said what are
[1:07:50] those gods of Rachel what does that type
[1:07:52] out and he said your sermon just
[1:07:54] answered my question today Rachel use
[1:07:57] the excuse of her unclean custom to hide
[1:08:01] the items remember she said Oh dad you
[1:08:03] know you got to search my tent but i'm
[1:08:04] unclean right now so just search i can't
[1:08:08] move and the whole time the idols were
[1:08:11] hiding under her they're hiding deep
[1:08:13] under her right
[1:08:14] today people do the same thing as rachel
[1:08:17] that used the excuse so I'm just a
[1:08:19] sinner and then hide their idols under
[1:08:21] that false excuse you are just a sinner
[1:08:24] in your flesh but your soul should be
[1:08:26] born again from God your soul ought to
[1:08:29] be a part of God and the church said
[1:08:31] your soul is not a part of Satan your
[1:08:33] soul is a part of God stop looking at
[1:08:37] your flesh and look at the soul of man a
[1:08:39] man Paul said it's not either sin but
[1:08:42] sin to twelve within me and see we've
[1:08:45] become a racial we become a little bit
[1:08:47] of a hiding of our sins we make excuses
[1:08:50] well rotor Jess I can't you understand
[1:08:53] I'm a sinner I struggle yes so do I but
[1:08:57] that's no excuse to hide it be honest
[1:08:59] with yourself and cast out on all idols
[1:09:01] and live pure for Christ if you fast
[1:09:05] forward before she dies Jacob takes her
[1:09:09] to the house of God what a beautiful
[1:09:10] time hitting head guard because judgment
[1:09:13] begins we're at the house of God and
[1:09:15] Jacob forces all his visiting four wives
[1:09:18] i believe about mistake
[1:09:20] one white one line for three concubines
[1:09:22] of - Aiza - cocky minds i forget how
[1:09:24] that does we had four wives and he says
[1:09:27] all of you oh my household are going to
[1:09:29] take your strange guys and we're burying
[1:09:32] them under the oak in chichén and that
[1:09:35] was a before we go to the house of God
[1:09:37] and then she was fit to be called homes
[1:09:40] in the same chapter she gives birth to
[1:09:42] Benjamin she has a second birth brings
[1:09:45] forth life a second time and then
[1:09:47] changes the mention already I like that
[1:09:52] did you see that before we come to the
[1:09:55] house of God we must bury our sins at
[1:09:58] the tree at Jesus's crossing and we must
[1:10:02] bury them at the mercy tree we must hide
[1:10:05] them in the rock of ages' anything give
[1:10:07] them the Christ like Christ put them
[1:10:09] away then go to the house of God and
[1:10:12] then no time for body change it's time
[1:10:14] for death to sell that light might be
[1:10:16] produced that's what Rachel was a
[1:10:18] beautiful type of death right up
[1:10:20] bringing forth light and then depth and
[1:10:22] then body change amen
[1:10:25] hope you can see that by God's grace
[1:10:27] once you type out your text out the
[1:10:28] bride the bride will sometimes bring
[1:10:31] idols into their lives but before they
[1:10:33] go to meet God before they go and can
[1:10:35] have a real body change all sins must be
[1:10:37] put under the mercy truth praise God
[1:10:39] it's exactly right what a beautiful type
[1:10:44] Paul said I suffer not a woman to teach
[1:10:46] or assert authority from the Garden of
[1:10:50] Eden onward women as constantly and
[1:10:52] successfully tried to take control over
[1:10:54] the man remember one even Adam of course
[1:10:57] and right today it is the woman's world
[1:10:59] with the goddess of America being a
[1:11:01] naked female as the female Idol holding
[1:11:04] out of the skies remember her arms were
[1:11:06] iron bars and emphasis so her Power has
[1:11:09] grown until she has gained absolute
[1:11:12] authority such authority being asserted
[1:11:15] by her iron disposition now watches iron
[1:11:19] disposition this is for our sisters in
[1:11:21] our church but listen it's also for our
[1:11:23] disposition to Christ brothers don't let
[1:11:26] the servant just be the home he's
[1:11:27] finally going to preach on those sisters
[1:11:29] I'm gonna preach other brothers do
[1:11:31] preach on everybody I mean we all need
[1:11:34] it raise God let's see our disposition
[1:11:38] through the husband Christ must be a
[1:11:40] submissive disposition apparently the
[1:11:43] woman is not meant to have an iron
[1:11:45] disposition in other words like
[1:11:48] standoffish
[1:11:49] I'll stand against you I'll fight
[1:11:52] against you
[1:11:52] she's not meant to have that she's a
[1:11:55] court of the scripture to be submissive
[1:11:57] to the male in other words she's like
[1:11:59] okay whatever you say
[1:12:00] okay whatever that's how you feel that
[1:12:03] that's fine that's a submissive
[1:12:05] disposition not an item disposition it's
[1:12:08] my way or the highway
[1:12:09] what are you talking about this is mine
[1:12:12] my plans in my day and all these things
[1:12:15] you know my decision a woman is supposed
[1:12:18] to have a soft disposition not a higher
[1:12:20] one because IRA types out the feet of
[1:12:22] that image Daniel saw right Babylon it
[1:12:26] types out jessabelle great right
[1:12:28] mother harder see this is commanded of
[1:12:33] the woman woman who's truly female all
[1:12:35] female will be of that submissive
[1:12:38] disposition not a doormat no real male
[1:12:44] makes a female a doormat but she will
[1:12:48] want to be under Authority and not rule
[1:12:50] over the male for
[1:12:52] is the head of the house if she breaks
[1:12:54] that image that God made for her she's
[1:12:57] perverted so when she starts taking
[1:12:59] control the house and less God I'll just
[1:13:01] rule the house if my husband won't rule
[1:13:03] the house or or maybe he's real weak
[1:13:05] like that but really laid-back or maybe
[1:13:07] he's just not there to rule it if she
[1:13:10] starts taking over its ups taking
[1:13:11] control she has to become a perverted
[1:13:14] female and the church said that's right
[1:13:17] or she's willing to fight against a
[1:13:19] strong man maybe she's got no strong
[1:13:21] husband but she's able to willing to
[1:13:22] fight against that with an island
[1:13:24] disposition I'll go toe to toe and you
[1:13:26] talk it my way oh my that's a night of
[1:13:30] disposition any male that left the woman
[1:13:35] take authority has also broken that
[1:13:38] image and he is perverted
[1:13:41] so now sisters you can say maybe someone
[1:13:43] preached on some men now beginning a
[1:13:46] mental sister that's a good any male
[1:13:51] that does it he's perverted so any man
[1:13:54] that takes the tribal realness I'm not
[1:13:57] talk about naturally I'll talk about
[1:13:59] spiritually spiritually takes the
[1:14:01] drivers fear or makes all the decisions
[1:14:03] for the family
[1:14:04] he's / murdered he has not he's now
[1:14:07] become not a man when he's come less
[1:14:10] than a man he's not a real man he's for
[1:14:13] heard of man Solomon was the example we
[1:14:16] already gave he had an imperfect
[1:14:18] wandering arm bill altars and houses for
[1:14:21] idols and that Shane would men do that
[1:14:25] they'll build an altar they'll make
[1:14:27] their home so pretty for their life and
[1:14:28] yet they don't support the church in
[1:14:32] that a shame they just don't like him
[1:14:34] they good they spent money extra buddy
[1:14:36] on this and that and not support the
[1:14:38] church like they ought to know Solomon
[1:14:40] have mercy on that person's heart he
[1:14:43] went and built and rebuilt the house of
[1:14:45] God to all these other houses and and
[1:14:47] and I know that every Green Tree the
[1:14:50] Bible said and though the city with
[1:14:52] idolatry because he just said ok honey
[1:14:55] I'll try to make you happy brothers be
[1:14:57] careful when you say ok honey I just
[1:14:59] want to make you happy
[1:15:00] be careful what you're doing and the
[1:15:02] church said be a man so it wasn't a man
[1:15:06] because they will stand up and say you
[1:15:07] know let's roll that was our real God
[1:15:09] there's only one true God and brothers
[1:15:12] should better say there's only one true
[1:15:13] God the Lord Jesus Christ so we follow
[1:15:15] all his commands in that they have that
[1:15:19] Jezebel killed most of God's prophets
[1:15:20] not all my Muslim neighbor and then he
[1:15:25] let Jezebel kill naval form so he could
[1:15:29] inherit some land the old houses and
[1:15:31] don't build houses for false gods and he
[1:15:35] let her convince him that he lied she
[1:15:38] was the problem
[1:15:38] Church brother Brennan is not the
[1:15:40] problem today and the church said man
[1:15:43] rubber bands not the problem brother
[1:15:44] branham is a great source of a solution
[1:15:47] because when he brings us God's Word
[1:15:49] it's no longer our thought or what our
[1:15:51] opinion we take God's opinion a day and
[1:15:54] so see he led Jezebel influence well he
[1:15:57] just saw Holy Roller
[1:15:58] and he said it so much that he went up
[1:16:00] and said how are you you're the one that
[1:16:02] troubles is grown he said I like I said
[1:16:04] I love the one trouble in stro you're
[1:16:06] the one trouble is now you're letting
[1:16:08] her run the show and what he just kept
[1:16:10] on the same old way God hold it one time
[1:16:13] but we know he was lost he was an awful
[1:16:15] man he was raised the right away but
[1:16:17] when I went away from God what a shame
[1:16:19] you see he let his white have too much
[1:16:23] control he let his wife do things
[1:16:25] without really praying about it or
[1:16:27] seeking God about it he wasn't a real
[1:16:30] man Ahab was a perverted man he wasn't
[1:16:33] me Church you brothers should get this
[1:16:35] this morning Aaron was another perverted
[1:16:38] man he feared John the Baptist at the
[1:16:41] beginning he feared John and the Bible
[1:16:43] said he observed John he actually
[1:16:44] listened to something John said he
[1:16:46] listened to the lives of prison in order
[1:16:48] to today he would listen a little bit to
[1:16:49] programming yet he let her odious
[1:16:52] influence her daughter to kill John the
[1:16:54] Baptist allowing the silence of Elijah
[1:16:56] and that's what happens when women will
[1:17:00] oh he preaches too hard on women honey
[1:17:01] let's not play brother Brown takes
[1:17:03] anymore shame on that man that would do
[1:17:04] that can't you Riley divide the truth
[1:17:07] can you rightly divide how other man
[1:17:09] will rebuke evil women but then praise
[1:17:11] the
[1:17:11] right woman the holy woman Cathy will
[1:17:13] see that they only focus on the rebuke
[1:17:16] rather than focus on the praise we've
[1:17:18] got to see bow but see people have that
[1:17:21] spear like Herodias I just don't like
[1:17:23] that it is so like the correction but
[1:17:25] God loves the corrected UN and God as a
[1:17:28] merciful God must warn the unruly he
[1:17:31] must warn the ungodly
[1:17:32] he's duty-bound to do that exactly right
[1:17:36] I'm not done brothers amen go I'm sorry
[1:17:40] dude hey man sorry had Abraham I'm sorry
[1:17:44] we all make mistakes forgive me Abraham
[1:17:48] became a little perverted when he left
[1:17:50] Sarah convinced him to take hey go
[1:17:52] remember that he got a little perverted
[1:17:56] he let her make the decision about

[1:18:04] the or is it the Living Bible series and
[1:18:06] it's it's so is so inspired at first

[1:18:11] conversation between Sarah and Abraham

[1:18:15] and Sarah kept just saying no it's
[1:18:17] already decided it's our decided it's
[1:18:19] already decided briefs today right look
[1:18:21] yes another wise and because he wanted
[1:18:25] to have a son so bad he wanted to try to
[1:18:27] bring the God's Word to pass himself God
[1:18:31] doesn't need our help to bring his word
[1:18:33] to pass God just needs a surrender
[1:18:35] submissive servant is where God help us
[1:18:38] to be submissive again not trying to
[1:18:41] inject our thoughts or make the rapture
[1:18:43] happen or make the church that better
[1:18:45] ourselves
[1:18:46] now with our efforts but our inspiration
[1:18:49] from the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:51] exactly right what it produce much loud
[1:18:53] man right but your I allow that
[1:18:56] Ishmael's that's what it produced when
[1:18:59] you try to inject your thought into the
[1:19:01] promise of God we know that Samson was
[1:19:04] perverted for a while the light
[1:19:07] oppressed him an urge him daily if you
[1:19:10] love me you'll do this if you love me
[1:19:12] you tell me
[1:19:13] urgent daily with her words until he
[1:19:16] surrendered the secret what that looked

[1:19:25] to pray that much

[1:19:33] just don't be tough Ian so tiny just get
[1:19:36] laid back and just relax

[1:19:40] that's what brother Branham said I'm not
[1:19:43] saying anything he didn't say he said
[1:19:45] that but Joe some of the Old Testament
[1:19:50] is our example of how to overcome that
[1:19:52] how you overcome that daily pressing

[1:20:34] Bible said they have a form agafia's but
[1:20:36] deny the power thereof the power book of
[1:20:39] power organization of out-of-the-world
[1:20:40] the pilot of church the power of the
[1:20:42] Holy Ghost
[1:20:43] that's the secret place in the church
[1:20:46] the power of the Holy Ghost right and
[1:20:50] when the church adopts educated
[1:20:52] preachers and big buildings and finery
[1:20:54] in the set of the old-fashioned Holy
[1:20:56] Ghost they'd better be in the mission
[1:20:58] again amen true
[1:20:59] how're you going to have a revival the
[1:21:01] Holy Ghost and people quench it and
[1:21:03] bound it in our afraid of it there's
[1:21:06] where the trouble lies remember brother
[1:21:09] Simon precept we can't buy you the Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost when retreats out last night we
[1:21:12] can't buy it just like it relax and see
[1:21:15] how it whispering soon Oh Samson Oh
[1:21:17] Samson just started just just relax on
[1:21:20] God don't be so dedicated to God as we
[1:21:23] heard last Sunday for brother Samuel
[1:21:25] don't be so dedicated Noah don't be so
[1:21:27] dedicated
[1:21:28] that's the Lila that's just a bell
[1:21:32] listen what's the first thing that
[1:21:34] dunder Samson when they caught up a
[1:21:36] mountain
[1:21:37] they took his power way they found a
[1:21:38] secret they found your secret the world
[1:21:40] found your secret Samson the Philistines
[1:21:44] is on me now look at my back said
[1:21:46] brother he said Brandon Tabernacle world
[1:21:49] ism is creeping in among you so just as
[1:21:53] a just as Samson was hardened so brother
[1:21:58] branham Lauren's his church you're
[1:22:00] starting to get a little worldly you're
[1:22:02] starting to act like the world sound
[1:22:04] like the world dress like the world love
[1:22:06] the things the world loves he said what
[1:22:10] about it have you exposed your secret
[1:22:11] others have you give it away your prayer
[1:22:13] life and give it away the power of the
[1:22:15] Holy Spirit have you exposed the secret
[1:22:20] God gave you when you're wallowing there
[1:22:21] and the sawdust a few years ago and you
[1:22:23] let it creep up with you social formal
[1:22:25] worship see how you let churches get
[1:22:27] like a routine just come here and expect
[1:22:29] nothing to happen I know of a teacher
[1:22:32] let me cut his trunks with the name I
[1:22:34] know God gave me a teaching ministry not
[1:22:36] just saying this and I know I did a lot
[1:22:39] of teaching that's enough what that's a
[1:22:40] gift I had I can only be what God made
[1:22:42] me think but I've also got to give to
[1:22:44] Pastor and so if someone might say well
[1:22:47] we're brother Jesse you know there's
[1:22:49] teaching of the word that ends the word
[1:22:51] ngoz for two different things the word
[1:22:53] is just teaching the gospel is the power
[1:22:56] and I understand that but this is any
[1:23:00] gift of God that's given to the Holy
[1:23:01] Spirit God can use that and people can
[1:23:05] use that gift if they're into with the
[1:23:07] Holy Spirit
[1:23:08] to pull out whatever they have need up
[1:23:10] out of the gift of God I'm a teacher but
[1:23:13] last Mother's Day somebody got healed of
[1:23:15] divine healing from a teaching ministry
[1:23:18] so people can't tell me that God can't
[1:23:21] do something because I'm just a teaching
[1:23:23] pastor or what about or just a what
[1:23:26] about - you're just an evangelist or
[1:23:27] you're just this or you're just that
[1:23:29] God's gifts all have their place God's
[1:23:32] gifts are all needed
[1:23:33] it's our approach it's our attitude to
[1:23:35] God's gift that makes all the difference
[1:23:37] amen so if you feel sorry well I've got
[1:23:41] to teach and assert you don't preach as
[1:23:43] much like other men off - it don't
[1:23:45] matter
[1:23:45] God has placed you God knows exactly
[1:23:47] where you need to be
[1:23:48] first why not if you're in the will of
[1:23:50] God and here for the will God supported
[1:23:52] with all you have don't let any
[1:23:53] Amalekite creep in and give you a formal
[1:23:56] Church experience you must come to
[1:23:58] church expecting God to do if you come
[1:24:00] that way I see it over and over again I
[1:24:02] promise you gotta meet your need a man
[1:24:04] but you he's got to come not formal and
[1:24:06] don't let say in dirt the lie the Lewis
[1:24:09] away and take away our secret power of
[1:24:12] expectation our secret power of faith
[1:24:14] our secret power of time in the word and
[1:24:16] loving the Word of God instead of loving
[1:24:19] the things of the world my goodness no
[1:24:21] matter toasters what happened to you
[1:24:23] random Tiger doctors have become all
[1:24:25] formal it's all just formal there's no
[1:24:27] more supernatural Wow God can come down
[1:24:33] to perform Amerigo and go right in
[1:24:34] through the audience and tell people the
[1:24:36] secrets of their hearts and everything
[1:24:37] and heal the sick and afflicted which
[1:24:39] we've seen that here in our church and
[1:24:40] new signs and wonders and preach his
[1:24:42] word as hard as they can by the Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost some people say well I guess
[1:24:46] that's all right and we enjoy listen to
[1:24:49] it once in a while if we're not too
[1:24:52] tired brother Branham is bawling out his
[1:24:55] own church are you with me and he said I
[1:24:59] could come here and give the sermon
[1:25:00] after the sermon and you're getting
[1:25:02] formal it's not exciting to you and
[1:25:04] you're not keeping the Lord has the
[1:25:06] Apple drop Amen with me and they're
[1:25:10] letting tyre this and let it see they're
[1:25:11] not resting enough on Saturday if you're
[1:25:14] tired of a sudden that you're not
[1:25:15] resting Saturday and Friday like you off
[1:25:16] to this is available this is that they
[1:25:19] arrest spiritually but that they to feed
[1:25:21] on God's Word as well and if you're to
[1:25:24] the time was not to get some rest
[1:25:25] type it relax it's time to get some rest
[1:25:29] that's random Tabernacle the Philistines
[1:25:34] is Amon do you think he's just making
[1:25:35] this up to kind of play around and be
[1:25:37] fun think whether the Prophet just make
[1:25:39] up things to be fun if everywhere I
[1:25:41] preach two Sundays ago I said I wonder
[1:25:44] if we're coming to Kadesh Barnea
[1:25:45] judgment begins the house of God around
[1:25:48] every church comes there are you going
[1:25:50] to move into the promise of God into
[1:25:51] deeper things of God or not and here we
[1:25:53] have another one here have another
[1:25:55] challenge to the church who's going to
[1:25:57] move up into the spiritual things of God
[1:25:58] I am by God's grace we had every
[1:26:02] Asher should move up and the people can
[1:26:04] move up right program so you'll never
[1:26:06] live any higher than your pastor maghreb
[1:26:08] says that's right okay I said when it
[1:26:12] used to be the preaching of the word at
[1:26:15] Branham tabernacle and the old Saints
[1:26:17] with tears in their eyes during the
[1:26:19] preaching would rise their feet and walk
[1:26:22] sobbing maybe not saying a word just
[1:26:25] walking down two or three and set down
[1:26:27] and so fill with the Holy Ghost the word
[1:26:29] fed them now he's rebuking the random
[1:26:30] Tabernacle I used to see tears and
[1:26:33] people come to the altar at random time
[1:26:34] that co-manage another by bread alone
[1:26:38] but by every word to precede thought
[1:26:39] about the gun the Philistines is upon me
[1:26:41] random tabernacle Philistines is upon
[1:26:46] you friends now he calls out the aged
[1:26:48] Pentecostal because we're moving into
[1:26:49] now the bride age the Baptist Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] the seals are open Church ages are
[1:26:54] revealed
[1:26:55] they're moving into that it calls out
[1:26:56] the latest age what the Holy Spirit
[1:26:59] would say the Philistines is upon you
[1:27:00] right a Christ fellowship right every
[1:27:04] Church has it every Church has a que -
[1:27:07] every Church has this habit are we
[1:27:09] discharged becoming formal or is it
[1:27:13] still our hearts desire amen
[1:27:17] what about you but I know my answer I
[1:27:19] know my answer this is the one horse
[1:27:22] desire to love God the worship God and
[1:27:26] here's where he preaches word and the
[1:27:28] singing songs and the worship with you
[1:27:29] is still my heart's desire that's right
[1:27:32] let's get back to the church age book
[1:27:34] I'm going a little bit further I set a
[1:27:36] timer so when it preached too long today
[1:27:39] so let's get back to the church age book
[1:27:42] and I got a few quotes I want to close
[1:27:43] with about family life that's why a
[1:27:49] woman cannot wear that much cocaine
[1:27:51] pertaining to a man on colored hair
[1:27:53] she's never to wear garments that
[1:27:55] pertain to a male or cut her hair when
[1:27:57] she does she's indulging into the male
[1:27:59] domain
[1:28:00] taking authority and perverting herself
[1:28:04] now let's stop right there so if she's
[1:28:07] evading his what about when he invades
[1:28:09] hers he gets weak instead of being a
[1:28:12] strong leader strong man letter the Holy
[1:28:14] Spirit he gets weak what is he doing
[1:28:16] he's
[1:28:16] coming brother em call to the we
[1:28:19] don't want men in the church we
[1:28:20] want strong miniature anything we don't
[1:28:23] want dominating females we want
[1:28:24] submissive sweet female Amen right
[1:28:27] Church right and when a woman invades
[1:28:32] the pulpit which is commanded she must
[1:28:35] not do she shows what spirit she's up
[1:28:37] think adopt many females Antichrist and
[1:28:39] the season the Roman Catholic Church are
[1:28:41] in here though she may deny this ever so
[1:28:43] vehemently but when it comes to the word
[1:28:46] that God's Word be true in every man's
[1:28:47] word alive let's go back to the getting
[1:28:50] and the original physical creation as we
[1:28:52] know it today God made everything in
[1:28:53] pairs man female there were two chickens
[1:28:56] rooster head there were two cattle the
[1:28:58] Cotton Bowl and right down the line and
[1:29:00] when it came to man there was only one
[1:29:02] they were not a pair Adam had been made
[1:29:05] in the image of God he was a son as the
[1:29:07] son of God he would not be tempted and
[1:29:09] Paul that would be impossible so God
[1:29:13] took a byproduct a man that caused the
[1:29:14] fall woman never stepped fresh out of
[1:29:17] the hand of God as a true product of God
[1:29:20] see she wasn't created individually she
[1:29:24] was created codependent Lee right it
[1:29:26] depended upon Adam that's how she was
[1:29:28] created and that's a real woman today
[1:29:29] that's a real church she's depending
[1:29:31] upon Christ Aidan Annie
[1:29:33] she was produced from man and when God
[1:29:36] calls her to be brought forth from man
[1:29:38] she was vastly different from the other
[1:29:40] females he had created she was able to
[1:29:43] be seduced no other female creation can
[1:29:46] be immoral but the fee human female may
[1:29:49] be touched at almost any time and that
[1:29:52] weakness is in her allowed Satan to
[1:29:55] seduce her
[1:29:56] by the way the serpent and has brought
[1:29:58] the woman to very peculiar position
[1:30:00] before God his word the side to supply
[1:30:03] this to all the sisters now this apply
[1:30:04] to the church she's the type of all
[1:30:07] things both her vile and loathsome on
[1:30:09] one hand on the other hand she the type
[1:30:11] of all things clean and beautiful and
[1:30:13] holy as the reciprocal of the Spirit and
[1:30:17] the blessings of God hey so see how
[1:30:20] these contrast these two churches
[1:30:22] once dominating in is the is the is the
[1:30:26] type of all things evil and one
[1:30:28] submissive to God as a
[1:30:29] of all these pure on one hand she's Koga
[1:30:33] who's drunk with the light of her
[1:30:35] fornication
[1:30:36] on the other hand she's called the Bride
[1:30:37] of Christ on one hand she's called
[1:30:41] Mystery Babylon the abomination before
[1:30:44] God on the other hand she's called the
[1:30:46] New Jerusalem our mother on one hand
[1:30:49] she's so far wicked and lewd that she is
[1:30:52] summer summer summer summer league I
[1:30:55] can't say that sorry Casa de they can
[1:30:57] fire as the only pit place for her on
[1:31:00] the other hand she's exalted to heaven
[1:31:02] sharing the very throne of God as the
[1:31:05] only place retaining such a queen now
[1:31:08] what our research what's hard is this
[1:31:10] this position of crisis morning are we
[1:31:12] hard towards the Holy Spirit are we
[1:31:14] being submissive and Lord I'll do
[1:31:16] whatever you call me to do if you ask me
[1:31:18] to step up idle aside I'll gladly do
[1:31:20] that if you ask me to cast this out if
[1:31:22] you ask me to end a relationship or a
[1:31:24] friendship or you asking you to do this
[1:31:26] or that I'll be happy to do it lord I
[1:31:28] won't hold on to anything I won't hide
[1:31:30] under any excuse for office I'm just
[1:31:32] unclean I'm I'm just a sinner saved by
[1:31:33] grace
[1:31:34] I'm just a foolish virgin don't hide
[1:31:36] under unclean let it be exposed and let
[1:31:39] God have his way man exactly right hey
[1:31:44] glory I'm almost finished with this part
[1:31:49] and in this dire team of church age
[1:31:51] she's the dominating female she's
[1:31:53] Mystery Babylon she's the great
[1:31:55] she had just felled the false prophet is
[1:31:56] why because the true female is
[1:31:58] submissive to God Christ is her head she
[1:32:02] has no word when his no thought fit is
[1:32:04] no leadership in his but what about this
[1:32:06] church she's cast out the word what
[1:32:10] destroyed the Bibles and worthy essays
[1:32:12] of
[1:32:13] the godly just slaying those who had
[1:32:15] reached the truth she's taking over
[1:32:16] Kings princes and nations controls
[1:32:18] armies and City as soon as the true body
[1:32:21] of Christ and that her hopes are the
[1:32:23] best she's entirely seduced by the devil
[1:32:27] until she in turn has become the seducer
[1:32:30] of others that's when you know someone's
[1:32:33] really deep in Antichrist spirit not
[1:32:34] only are they - see now they're trying
[1:32:36] to deceive other people and we've seen a
[1:32:39] recently people that leave the message
[1:32:40] therefore the message and turn around in
[1:32:42] a few months and
[1:32:43] now they're trying to deceive people out
[1:32:44] of the message that's what you know the
[1:32:47] Antichrist fear has really taken effect
[1:32:49] you become the seducer others instead of
[1:32:51] the instead of the the freer of others
[1:32:55] you become the seducer the enslaved or
[1:32:56] mothers see that we must be like Christ
[1:32:59] and set the captives free
[1:33:00] hey she's the bride of Satan and has
[1:33:04] produced his bachelor child religions
[1:33:09] now I'm going to let's see one two three
[1:33:12] four okay I'm gonna skip this let's move
[1:33:13] on a little bit I'm going to try to
[1:33:14] close with a few thoughts here I want to
[1:33:20] just pop a few I think it's so healthy
[1:33:21] family life is there's a need for it I
[1:33:24] just you know as I've said yesterday
[1:33:25] these just came to me that's how you go
[1:33:27] I'm just trying to find leadership with
[1:33:28] the Holy Spirit and I hope these will
[1:33:30] help you by God's grace questions
[1:33:33] answers 1964 I found some husband and
[1:33:36] wife questions I think that might be
[1:33:37] help to you to show the submission of a
[1:33:42] woman to the man but also the way a man
[1:33:44] should lead his wife I thought just by
[1:33:47] the leadership of the Holy Spirit I
[1:33:49] thought that would be helpful to this
[1:33:50] small person these first few questions
[1:33:54] there are husbands that are sinners and
[1:33:56] they're forbidding their wives to read
[1:33:58] the Bible go to church and dress folding
[1:34:02] remember she's submissive right to her
[1:34:04] husband brother branham the Bible tells
[1:34:08] us a wife should obey her husband I have
[1:34:10] a Christian of my husband as a sinner he
[1:34:12] persecutes me in every way that he can
[1:34:14] and for me not to go to church and read
[1:34:16] my Bible and denies the word what should
[1:34:17] I do
[1:34:18] oh man says what should you do you're
[1:34:21] supposed to bear husband that's the word
[1:34:22] now if he tells you and refuse you to
[1:34:25] read the Bible go to church you don't
[1:34:26] have to obey that because either will
[1:34:32] forsake his father mother husband
[1:34:33] whatever it is and follow me is not
[1:34:35] worthy to me praise the Lord pretty
[1:34:38] simple right if someone tells you you
[1:34:41] can't read your pray or dress the right
[1:34:43] way you have a right to disobey them as
[1:34:45] a woman as a married woman and obey God
[1:34:49] I've heard people say that on YouTube I
[1:34:51] want to get the comments they say oh but
[1:34:53] my husband was going to wear this as a
[1:34:54] booty level
[1:34:55] Chrysler doesn't it's pretty easy
[1:34:57] question I said hate to say that I got
[1:34:59] your husband but somebody's got to tell
[1:35:01] you right it's either going to be me or
[1:35:04] I can tell you this book in this book
[1:35:05] and Tyga is one of the other I think
[1:35:09] I'll just tell you right now see that he
[1:35:12] goes in to say no the man or a man is
[1:35:15] not supposed to use that authority of a
[1:35:16] woman just because he's her ruler so see
[1:35:19] a Reno man will not lead up a woman
[1:35:22] outside the word only to the word Amen
[1:35:25] that's right
[1:35:27] God is her ruler above you brother see
[1:35:30] if your wife is doing something wrong
[1:35:32] then you got a right to tell her and
[1:35:33] she's supposed to listen to you but you
[1:35:35] haven't gotten a right to beat her
[1:35:37] dragged her around her do things I know
[1:35:39] people in this message that let their
[1:35:42] husband beat them and people tell them
[1:35:44] you have to leave you have to leave it
[1:35:46] like no I got to submit I got to submit
[1:35:47] like that and that's not right the Bible
[1:35:50] said if a woman is pleased as well she's
[1:35:52] fine
[1:35:53] but if she has to leave she can leave
[1:35:54] but she can't marry again right like I
[1:35:58] said brothers it
[1:35:59] if a woman cuts her hair a man can put
[1:36:01] her away now real man would try to love
[1:36:03] her and forget were not divorced it
[1:36:04] right and trying to pray her through
[1:36:06] back to God but if he wanted to he could
[1:36:08] because she dishonored her head which
[1:36:11] also does her husband which also decided
[1:36:13] as Christ which dishonor Scott the
[1:36:15] invisible spirit that's right right from
[1:36:17] the Bible but he can't marry again for
[1:36:20] that either
[1:36:21] that's Scripture as well he can't how
[1:36:26] many believe the Word of God
[1:36:27] that's right church that's right any man
[1:36:32] that I meet a woman isn't even a man
[1:36:34] he's a right not real way you see
[1:36:38] God in a man help me not a doormat
[1:36:40] remember she was your sweetheart she
[1:36:42] should always do that amen
[1:36:45] keep the honeymoon alive hey I remember
[1:36:47] sister bones posted three weeks ago
[1:36:50] god bless Fagor keeping a hug you live
[1:36:53] brother I like I'm trying to say by
[1:36:55] God's grace other there yet here's a
[1:36:58] second question also brother branham I
[1:37:01] believe a woman should be subject to her
[1:37:02] husband but if a Christian woman has a
[1:37:03] sinner husband who's not even to one of
[1:37:06] your services come to one your service
[1:37:08] what one is white to be doing things cut
[1:37:10] their hair wearing shorts and go to
[1:37:11] ungodly places is the woman's supposed
[1:37:13] to be subbed to this man in this way
[1:37:15] please explain this more clearly as this
[1:37:17] question is a question often asked so
[1:37:21] this was asked often what if my husband
[1:37:22] tells me to deny the word the RAM gives
[1:37:26] the same answer no sister you're not
[1:37:27] subject to such a person no need because
[1:37:30] you'll leave everything in cleave to God
[1:37:32] if if that man wants to live with you at
[1:37:36] state a Christian and you stay a
[1:37:38] Christian but if he's going to make you
[1:37:40] wear shorts cut your hair and do all
[1:37:41] these other things and ungodly places
[1:37:43] you seek first the kingdom of God and
[1:37:45] His righteousness
[1:37:46] you're not valid as such a person as
[1:37:47] that amen that's what Paul meant when he
[1:37:50] said you're not bound to someone like
[1:37:51] that
[1:37:51] that doesn't mean you're loose from the
[1:37:53] bond the vow you're still bound to that
[1:37:56] person but you're not physically bound
[1:37:58] to live with that person if they
[1:38:00] persecute you that's exactly right now
[1:38:05] I'm not enough preaching for women and
[1:38:07] men to leave each other either
[1:38:08] I'm saying when it comes down to
[1:38:10] headship we must follow the leadership
[1:38:12] of the Holy Ghost that's what I'm saying
[1:38:14] and seek godly leadership before you
[1:38:16] make any big decision seek the
[1:38:18] leadership pray in fast
[1:38:19] seek God for that's right but the Bible
[1:38:25] says as long as you're pleased its well
[1:38:27] with together remember that first we
[1:38:29] need seven I didn't put these scriptures
[1:38:32] out and cause because I just picked them
[1:38:33] up a few minutes ago but Paul said as
[1:38:37] long as the unbelieving husband as
[1:38:38] unbelieving wife or so forth let the
[1:38:40] believing why to remain with unbelieving
[1:38:42] husband as long as it's not rained out
[1:38:44] to God if he's pleased to go with her go
[1:38:46] ahead honey if you want to go to church
[1:38:47] that's alright but I ain't going I don't
[1:38:49] believe in it don't need nothing new
[1:38:51] that when you go ahead that's alright
[1:38:53] but when he says you can't do it now
[1:38:54] there is a different thing you're not
[1:38:56] founded that then you separate
[1:38:58] everything for God see whether man gives
[1:39:00] them a permission to women if there is
[1:39:02] if someone if your husband is keeping
[1:39:04] you from obeying the Word of God your
[1:39:06] right to go but you cannot marry yet so
[1:39:10] see we're looking at submission we're
[1:39:11] looking at we don't want to iron the
[1:39:13] women go in iron this position and the
[1:39:15] bride the church we don't want to iron
[1:39:16] this position of the word
[1:39:17] submissive disposition but in that case
[1:39:20] if your human husband is telling you do
[1:39:22] things outside the word you've got to
[1:39:25] have the submission to the Holy Spirit
[1:39:26] to that right that's right
[1:39:30] here's how this question when the
[1:39:32] husband wants wife to attend
[1:39:34] denominational Church of type and we
[1:39:35] have this in our church and I think this
[1:39:38] is the sister does a great job no
[1:39:40] balancing this program I have accepted
[1:39:42] God's message of today and also our son
[1:39:44] we both have been baptized name of Lord
[1:39:46] Jesus Christ my husband hasn't accepted
[1:39:48] the message and despite this message
[1:39:50] he's influenced our son is taken to a
[1:39:52] Methodist Church he wants me to go with
[1:39:54] him to church when we are not in service
[1:39:56] here the tabernacle you see sometimes it
[1:39:58] would come she would grade her son the
[1:40:01] tabernacle but he but she said whether
[1:40:03] or not in the tabernacle service my
[1:40:05] husband wants me to go to the nomination
[1:40:06] church would be right for me to go with
[1:40:08] him or be better to stay on that
[1:40:09] denomination look at now remember that
[1:40:12] did the Bible say come out of her my
[1:40:13] people you see that the Bible says come
[1:40:17] out of her my people but no some of this
[1:40:19] brother and says go ahead and go just
[1:40:22] don't partake of their false doctrine
[1:40:26] see because why in her heart she's
[1:40:28] already come out of it I live it up in
[1:40:31] her soul she's already come out because
[1:40:32] she don't go along denominational trash
[1:40:34] she knows no row with Creed's Abed you
[1:40:36] don't go around with Antichrist spirit
[1:40:37] she's got the Spirit of Christ in her
[1:40:39] she knows the truth of God so go into a
[1:40:42] lodge don't hurt her because she's got a
[1:40:44] seal inside of her amen
[1:40:45] she can't lose that seal because she
[1:40:48] sealed unto the day of redemption amen
[1:40:50] she's also gonna be submissive to God in
[1:40:53] her soul exactly right your sister go
[1:40:58] with your husband what I thought come
[1:41:00] out of her my people
[1:41:01] she already has come out she already has
[1:41:04] come out by the Holy Ghost
[1:41:05] but don't be partakers of what they're
[1:41:07] doing so you're supposed to love your
[1:41:10] husband love love is what does it use
[1:41:13] beer Oh salty go get thirsty there's
[1:41:15] anything in it
[1:41:16] there's my timer I gotta close up here
[1:41:18] don't join their denomination you stay
[1:41:20] away for that denomination don't join it
[1:41:22] you can go to it you can't get a whole
[1:41:24] loaf get a hat get a half just get a
[1:41:29] slice
[1:41:31] see but that's the way you'll win your
[1:41:33] husband by doing that don't be arrogant
[1:41:38] then he'll know this is beautiful don't
[1:41:40] be arrogant then he'll know he's got
[1:41:43] just as much as you have enough powerful
[1:41:47] key message people be mayor arrogant
[1:41:49] yeah sometimes messages people could be
[1:41:51] arrogant we've all seen five like there
[1:41:53] they got it all figured out they're
[1:41:54] better than everybody else we must have
[1:41:57] confidence in the word and know our
[1:41:59] position in Christ but you have to take
[1:42:00] I'm not the heir or not looked out upon
[1:42:02] them and think we're somebody better
[1:42:05] than them but when you can show
[1:42:10] something that you have that you don't
[1:42:11] have that will make them thirst to be
[1:42:13] like you the sanctified wife sanctifies
[1:42:17] the husband now mother my sister if your
[1:42:22] husband wants you go down to the
[1:42:23] Methodist Church you go ahead you might
[1:42:25] not have a whole loaf of bread but if
[1:42:26] they even say they had the glee Jesus
[1:42:30] Christ son of God you go that you
[1:42:32] believe that because we do too now if
[1:42:34] they're going to go off on other
[1:42:35] Tantrums just let that go but you eat
[1:42:38] that much of the bread see and in that
[1:42:40] you just show by the sweetness of your
[1:42:41] life and your consideration for others
[1:42:43] if you haven't got a dear sister pray
[1:42:45] till it comes to you that you won't have
[1:42:48] to put on anything artificially because
[1:42:51] when you do that it's not real your
[1:42:53] husband can tell that in that something
[1:42:55] people without the Holy Ghost you can
[1:42:57] tell other people that don't have the
[1:42:59] Holy Ghost right they can down they can
[1:43:02] tell when something's put on why because
[1:43:05] that's what they do all the time they
[1:43:07] can send that oh this isn't real love
[1:43:09] this is a real dedication this isn't
[1:43:11] real submission right right brothers and
[1:43:13] sisters this isn't a real submission
[1:43:15] they're just going along with it is they
[1:43:16] know they have to but praying until you
[1:43:20] can obey and submit from the heart I'll
[1:43:22] be like that like out here honey I try
[1:43:24] to close when you really afraid to a
[1:43:26] place so your life is full of salt the
[1:43:28] Savior it'll make a contact if I'd be
[1:43:30] living about raw meant to be I go but be
[1:43:33] careful real careful don't join their
[1:43:36] church don't please don't do that don't
[1:43:38] you join their church we go on see that
[1:43:42] here's a white divorcing a believing
[1:43:45] husband
[1:43:45] I said your other brand my wife and I
[1:43:48] are separated she swing me for divorce
[1:43:50] she's not a Christian but I'd be the
[1:43:51] message you want to be saved and that
[1:43:53] nice real Christian spirit Emily but my
[1:43:56] side do we also have two boys brother
[1:43:57] look let me tell you she's going to sue
[1:43:59] you for divorce that's Satan you
[1:44:03] shouldn't do that but if your eye
[1:44:04] Christian had done something in the
[1:44:05] world to hit her that woman that it's
[1:44:07] Satan doing that he's only trying to
[1:44:10] tear you up now if she's the one that
[1:44:13] God selected she will come to him other
[1:44:16] words should come out of that marriage
[1:44:18] soon or divorce sooner or later if she's
[1:44:20] not she's not worth worrying about look
[1:44:24] at that statement ah that takes
[1:44:27] sovereign that takes anointing of a
[1:44:29] sovereign grace of God because you
[1:44:32] married this person you have two boys
[1:44:33] with this person you love this person
[1:44:35] for the rabbit now look look what he
[1:44:37] says though because if you worry he said
[1:44:38] it'll break your health down and that's
[1:44:40] what Satan wants you to get I don't have
[1:44:45] the facts in front of me but I've heard
[1:44:46] preachers preach about how stress can
[1:44:49] cause all types of diseases program so
[1:44:53] that's just Satan trying to upset you to
[1:44:56] give you some disease and kill you
[1:44:57] because you're basically to see how we
[1:45:00] must take care of our health our bodies
[1:45:02] because it's a it's a reflection of
[1:45:04] what's in our human spirit you don't
[1:45:07] take care of your body it shows you're
[1:45:08] not take care of your spirit but a real
[1:45:10] Christian will take ours temple why
[1:45:12] because it's not your temple it's the
[1:45:14] temple of the Holy Ghost is that when a
[1:45:16] man is not yours it's God's Amen and he
[1:45:19] purchased it with his own blood other
[1:45:20] than it's alright
[1:45:22] first finish up your steps we're bought
[1:45:24] with the price the precious blood of
[1:45:26] Jesus she said you just commit the
[1:45:28] holding to God and you got to take rest
[1:45:30] and just be as happy as you can be can
[1:45:32] you imagine that I can imagine that in
[1:45:33] the midst of the horse the Holy Ghost
[1:45:35] should make you as happy as you could be
[1:45:38] that takes the power of God well you
[1:45:41] know what that church that takes a
[1:45:42] submissive spirit to God nothing higher
[1:45:45] dismiss your God why it allowed me to be
[1:45:47] divorced kind of white allow this to
[1:45:48] happen God why do this why you that
[1:45:50] that's a higher dismisses but God I love
[1:45:52] you anyway I
[1:45:53] pure I'm living true God help me to be
[1:45:55] faithful you help me to pray until she
[1:45:57] comes back to God amen
[1:45:59] Liberty says she's going to divorce me
[1:46:02] anyhow I haven't done nothing if I have
[1:46:04] revealed to me now there's a real
[1:46:05] sincere pressure if I had caused my
[1:46:07] boots cause I've done something to my
[1:46:09] wife and caused a divorce me reveal it
[1:46:12] to me I'll go make it right
[1:46:14] I'll do anything that's a real
[1:46:17] submissive spirit right there now here
[1:46:21] let me bring this up trying to closer
[1:46:22] this still enjoying us how you enjoy
[1:46:24] this I got race this is bringing the
[1:46:27] gospel home right
[1:46:27] having the submissive spirit the sister
[1:46:30] is submissive and the men's submissive
[1:46:32] to the Holy Ghost submissive to the Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost now there was time a prett there
[1:46:37] was one time Abraham had to submit to
[1:46:39] see him remember that
[1:46:40] Sarah said kick out the bondwoman she's
[1:46:43] not inherited with the free woman
[1:46:45] remember that
[1:46:46] and so Abraham went to God and God said
[1:46:48] do what she said hearken unto her in
[1:46:52] other words obey her but see God told
[1:46:54] him to do it the first time he hearkened
[1:46:57] unto her and God didn't telling him the
[1:46:59] heart and that's the difference God told
[1:47:01] me to obey my wife and set up my just
[1:47:03] going to obey my wife 9 church and
[1:47:07] nothing gets all wise we loved Evan my
[1:47:09] life's a godly woman and I believe I've
[1:47:11] gifts of God in her life that I see
[1:47:12] operate on our marriage in our life you
[1:47:14] know but I wouldn't know from God first
[1:47:17] because God called me to make the final
[1:47:20] decision because if not if I let my wife
[1:47:23] decide or in other words if we let if we
[1:47:26] let the denominations of science set of
[1:47:28] God will be double guilty by the ramp
[1:47:30] sets you have a compound judgment on the
[1:47:34] day of judgment a man that doesn't lead
[1:47:36] and have his wife follow and lets her
[1:47:39] leave of absence punished double-double
[1:47:43] guilty here it is prevention there's a
[1:47:47] question here might answer right here I
[1:47:48] seen this morning said you're always
[1:47:50] harping about women how they must wear
[1:47:53] their hair but you never say nothing
[1:47:54] about the men if I see a baby over here
[1:47:58] with long hair any doubt is back like a
[1:48:00] woman that's it mister why don't you go
[1:48:02] to the barber shop look like
[1:48:04] see but men usually don't do that not as
[1:48:09] mad now now has the infallibility man
[1:48:12] but they're just as guilty as the wound
[1:48:14] see men are not infallible brothers if
[1:48:16] you think mama has a hold of infallible
[1:48:18] you're wrong if you think your valley
[1:48:21] are just as good as the Pope which isn't
[1:48:22] very good because he thinks he's
[1:48:23] infallible right when he speaks from st.
[1:48:25] Peter's Basilica they say he's
[1:48:26] infallible nonsense but as it and by the
[1:48:31] way brothers a man that will let his
[1:48:35] wife do that he's guilty double of it
[1:48:39] because he's supposed to be the one that
[1:48:42] has the say-so in the house and that man
[1:48:45] can't even rule his own house how could
[1:48:47] he do it in the house of God see he's
[1:48:51] guilty because he left his right and
[1:48:53] then he lets her lead he's double guilty
[1:48:56] not guilty for me see that in the
[1:49:04] program says I'm so thankful for the
[1:49:05] group of sisters I am thankful for the
[1:49:07] sisters in our church - they're godly
[1:49:09] sisters submissive sisters sweet soft
[1:49:12] disposition sisters right amen
[1:49:15] if our sisters battle at our disposition
[1:49:16] just take it to the Lord in prayer
[1:49:19] sisters and brothers of you battle that
[1:49:21] softness and I'm too tired to rule to a
[1:49:24] two-tire to make a decisions that God
[1:49:25] increased my strength
[1:49:27] restore my zeal restore my vision on the
[1:49:30] leader help me to find the leadership of
[1:49:32] the Holy Spirit that my wife can gladly
[1:49:34] follow it she'll see God now I'm going
[1:49:38] to skip past this let's get past that
[1:49:43] I'm going to close the two more things

[1:50:42] sent down a motion to her and got it
[1:50:44] over closely I said Nita sometimes I
[1:50:45] wonder I wonder what's the matter why
[1:50:47] would that meetings be there and God let
[1:50:50] me lay like this and I said why was it
[1:50:52] and I said sometimes I wonder if he even
[1:50:55] called me can you imagine he's almost 50
[1:51:00] years old seeing all these miracles
[1:51:03] raised the dead you know it's that
[1:51:06] wonder if God even called me to preach
[1:51:08] she said ain't you ashamed of yourself I
[1:51:10] don't know how she said it Church so no
[1:51:13] but your own interpretation to this okay
[1:51:15] see as she told me bill don't you know
[1:51:19] that God knows what he's doing with you
[1:51:21] just be just be quiet so brothers if you
[1:51:27] get romancing he was real tired and weak
[1:51:30] and worn out if you get really weak and
[1:51:32] worn out so our questioning you're wrong
[1:51:33] with God
[1:51:34] I wonder if I'm even a Christian if your
[1:51:36] wife has to rebuke you and tell you
[1:51:39] please stop talking honey
[1:51:41] would you please stop uttering those
[1:51:43] words about belief what you could say
[1:51:45] what brother Graham had to do the same
[1:51:46] thing me too had you the same thing and
[1:51:49] brother Graham thank her for that he
[1:51:51] said so I went and that kind of rebuked
[1:51:53] me a little you know his wife rebuked
[1:51:57] him now of course I'm sure she did it
[1:51:59] really
[1:52:00] submissively right look what he says
[1:52:03] earlier he said this he said oh yeah he
[1:52:07] said you know I'm sorry I'm tested you
[1:52:11] know I'm so thankful for a god-given
[1:52:13] wife aren't you a real companion so
[1:52:17] sometimes a real companion when you're
[1:52:18] really loaded that's the bad decision
[1:52:20] sometimes a real companion might have to
[1:52:21] rebuke you a little bit you like that by
[1:52:24] God's grace I thought I was so good look
[1:52:27] at that
[1:52:28] aren't you ashamed of yourself don't you
[1:52:30] know you're
[1:52:30] Oh God to preach don't you know you're
[1:52:31] called to lead the bride just be quiet
[1:52:35] now again sisters I'm not giving you
[1:52:37] permission to review your husband I'm
[1:52:40] just telling you that this happened to
[1:52:42] brother I was like and at the end of it
[1:52:43] he was thankful that shows that he was
[1:52:46] wrong he was he got to love we got to
[1:52:48] discourage now here's a here's another
[1:52:50] one to wear brother branham caused me to
[1:52:52] to live member that we invited the IRS
[1:52:54] agent Graham said he was so nervous he
[1:52:59] had already had meetings all morning
[1:53:01] with the IRS they sent him home and said
[1:53:03] we're not we don't need any more
[1:53:04] meetings and they called him up and said
[1:53:05] oh we change their mind I want you to
[1:53:06] come back in Graham said he felt like
[1:53:08] his head was coming off I was so weary
[1:53:12] so see what happens Satan tries to get
[1:53:14] you discouraged when you're tired or
[1:53:15] worn out you know what I did I said tell
[1:53:18] though I'm out here right now and around
[1:53:19] the house and went around behind the
[1:53:21] house when I come back in about why he
[1:53:23] looked at me and she said darling she
[1:53:25] said Billie was that just exactly
[1:53:27] righteous look how she brings the
[1:53:28] correction this time was that exactly
[1:53:30] right she didn't preach at him right she
[1:53:34] just said was that exactly right I said
[1:53:37] sure it was I wasn't in there right then
[1:53:39] but you see sometimes you act like it's
[1:53:42] the truth when it's still alive
[1:53:45] God don't want us to lie or tell little
[1:53:48] white lies or dodge around the corner
[1:53:49] everything's got to be right out and
[1:53:51] aboveboard
[1:53:54] okay I went to pray and he worshiped
[1:53:57] until he cried and he said God you
[1:53:59] forgive me I don't care because my life
[1:54:00] I said you forgive her I was the cause
[1:54:03] of her saying it Lord she shouldn't have
[1:54:07] said it now look she had a right to say
[1:54:09] no bill I'm not gonna lie to him she had
[1:54:12] the right because a man can't force a
[1:54:14] woman to disobey the word Kenny we just
[1:54:16] saw that earlier message he tells you to
[1:54:18] disobey the word get right to not not
[1:54:20] listen to that and hear what I said she
[1:54:23] should not have done that
[1:54:25] forgive her but I was the one I added to
[1:54:30] have her say that never see the balance
[1:54:33] here by God's grace he went told the
[1:54:35] higher SAT he said it's all right
[1:54:36] brother Branham I guess you're so tore
[1:54:38] up and he said my head felt like it was
[1:54:40] going to come off see how feeling get
[1:54:41] the way but that
[1:54:43] doesn't make any difference and don't
[1:54:44] get any room to lie I should tell the
[1:54:46] truth regardless of how much it hurts
[1:54:49] let's tangle our feet a submissive
[1:54:54] spirit to the holy spirit I don't want a
[1:54:57] submissive spirit to the holy spirit
[1:54:59] sometimes we wonder why our home life is
[1:55:01] out of control
[1:55:02] have we submitted to the Holy Spirit and
[1:55:06] we obeyed everything the Lord setting
[1:55:08] what is our disposition toward the Holy
[1:55:10] Ghost the Holy Spirit said raise your
[1:55:12] hands and worship or all these fears to
[1:55:14] go to the altar pray or the Holy Spirit
[1:55:16] said sing a song special or the Holy
[1:55:18] Spirit says do these things would we
[1:55:20] submit to it go make this right with
[1:55:22] your husband go make this right with
[1:55:24] your life make this decision go
[1:55:26] sacrifice this for the kingdom of God
[1:55:28] and change your life and do how they
[1:55:30] would do it by God's grace it takes a
[1:55:32] submissive spirit see can you see how
[1:55:36] this compared see the others can help
[1:55:38] the whole life but also the church you
[1:55:41] must be submitted to the Holy Spirit
[1:55:43] here at church
[1:55:44] you must understand there's times where
[1:55:46] we're down and we may need a little bit
[1:55:48] of review maybe they need a little bit
[1:55:50] of correction but see God always brings
[1:55:52] it right back in order
[1:55:53] the Royce does let's bow our heads here

[1:56:00] anybody raise their hands they pray for
