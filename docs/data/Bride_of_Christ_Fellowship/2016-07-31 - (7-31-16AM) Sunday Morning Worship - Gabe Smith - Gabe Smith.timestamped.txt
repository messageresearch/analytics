[42:50] we have been here so uh appreciate
[42:54] brother Jesse's longsuffering
[42:56] [Laughter]
[43:01] praise the Lord we're going to um uh
[43:04] read out of Revelations chapter
[43:06] 4 uh verse
[43:08] one very familiar
[43:12] scripture uh this is uh obviously after
[43:16] uh the seven Church
[43:18] ages uh and we see here as brother
[43:21] Brandon will tell us I'd like to read a
[43:23] quote after this this is John in a pre
[43:27] figure a type of our shadow of the
[43:29] Rapture says after this I looked and
[43:31] behold the door was open in heaven and
[43:34] the first voice which I heard was as it
[43:37] were of a trump talking with me which
[43:40] said come up hither and I will show thee
[43:43] things which must be Hereafter Amen
[43:46] brother Ram says Revelations chapter 4
[43:49] he says John being taken up immediately
[43:53] after the church age he was the type of
[43:56] the
[43:57] Church immediately after the church ages
[44:01] is over this lady will see a church age
[44:04] then comes the Rapture the church goes
[44:07] up like John did into the presence of
[44:10] God
[44:12] Amen and so this morning by the help of
[44:14] God I'd like to speak to you uh on just
[44:17] a uh for sake of a title a study on the
[44:22] Books of John amen let's just bow our
[44:24] heads in order of prayer Heavenly Father
[44:27] father Lord we love you today and
[44:31] thankful to be called your children Lord
[44:33] we just want to gather around your word
[44:36] ask Lord that you would be welcome in
[44:39] this
[44:40] place Lord I I know that your children
[44:44] have made you welcome in their worship
[44:46] and so Lord I I want you to be welcome
[44:50] behind this PO that you would just
[44:53] anoint us Lord with your great Holy
[44:56] Spirit that we could yield Our Lives to
[44:59] you and that you could be glorified this
[45:01] morning Lord we commit all that we are
[45:03] into your hands we love you we praise
[45:06] you we ask all these things to be so the
[45:09] name that's above every name our Lord
[45:12] and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God
[45:16] bless
[45:17] you
[45:19] like and so um study on the Books of
[45:23] John and uh so if uh John would be a
[45:29] type of the Bride then he would be an
[45:32] expression of the Bride throughout the
[45:34] scriptures we' be safe to say that yes
[45:38] and so uh we know that the Bible itself
[45:43] is a love letter to the Bride of Jesus
[45:45] Christ is that right yes amen but but if
[45:49] maybe I could say if um if John wrote
[45:54] particular books or letters then
[45:57] wouldn't those be an expression of the
[45:58] bride of Christ yes amen and and and so
[46:02] what I did is uh I I kind of comb
[46:05] through John first John 2 John third
[46:08] John and Revelations to
[46:11] compile um some things that was uh
[46:15] brought out that was special for us in
[46:18] our age amen and it's it's actually
[46:20] pretty phenomenal uh and so looking at
[46:24] we're going to mainly focus on the Book
[46:26] of John John uh but but then we may go
[46:30] to you know the the other letters but
[46:32] just so that you understand if John is a
[46:35] type of the Bride then uh then he ought
[46:39] to be different than all the other
[46:40] gospels is that right and so uh which is
[46:44] true uh and so if you look at Matthew
[46:48] Mark and Luke they are referred as the
[46:51] synoptic
[46:53] gospels uh they have a common Viewpoint
[46:56] and and and it's a it's a general theme
[46:59] through Matthew Mark and Luke but John
[47:02] differ very
[47:04] significantly uh actually so much so
[47:06] that uh it's it's it's said that there's
[47:10] only
[47:11] 8% of the Book of John in the other
[47:14] three gospels and so they referred to
[47:17] Matthew Mark and Luke as the synoptic
[47:20] gospels because they share a common
[47:23] viewpoint but John is different in and
[47:27] all of and in the all of gospels so much
[47:30] so that the early Christian Movement
[47:32] thought that it was a heretic and they
[47:35] wanted to take the Book of John
[47:37] out amen but but but it has to be that
[47:41] way because remember John is the eagle
[47:46] is that right uh if we if we would look
[47:49] at Revelations chapter 4 brother bam
[47:52] talks about this about the four living
[47:54] creatures the zoom he said the the first
[47:57] beast in Revelations 4:7 the first Beast
[48:00] was like a lion the second beast like a
[48:02] calf the third Beast had the face of a
[48:05] man the fourth Beast was like a flying
[48:09] eagle amen is that right amen uh very
[48:12] important everyone to to be mindful of
[48:15] this uh that living that fourth living
[48:18] creature which was an eagle God gave it
[48:21] an adjective it wasn't a eagle in the
[48:24] valley it wasn't an eagle setting on a
[48:26] forch or on a branch but it was a flying
[48:29] eagle it was an eagle in action and and
[48:33] so it's very important for us to realize
[48:35] that and so uh these these these four
[48:38] living uh creatures that last one being
[48:41] an eagle was actually John and and if we
[48:45] go back to the Old Testament uh
[48:48] Tabernacle when the 12 tribes of Israel
[48:51] would be around that uh Tabernacle and
[48:54] that Mercy Seat uh you would have them
[48:57] in tribal order but there was actually
[49:00] an inner circle to that tribal order and
[49:03] it was an inner circle of Dan was to the
[49:07] north uh to the West Was Ephraim to the
[49:10] South was Ruben and to the east was
[49:13] Judah now remember what what Moses when
[49:17] God took him up to heaven what Moses saw
[49:19] in heaven Moses pattered on Earth and so
[49:23] then being the eagle he would wave to
[49:26] the North that that that banner and it
[49:29] would be an eagle can you say Amen so so
[49:32] when Dan would be on the North side
[49:35] there would be an eagle that would be
[49:37] flying to the north because that was a
[49:40] representation of Revelation 4 those
[49:43] four living creatures can we say Amen to
[49:46] that all right y'all with me and so when
[49:49] we see John John or when we see Dan Dan
[49:54] uh uh was actually to the north but but
[49:57] what this what brother Bram takes this
[49:59] as as as he brings it to the New
[50:01] Testament brother brandham says it was
[50:04] Matthew Mark Luke and John guarding the
[50:07] book of Acts can we say Amen to that
[50:10] everybody with me so far and so and so
[50:13] the the Dan the tribe of Dan would be
[50:16] the eagle and so uh uh a Dan to the
[50:20] north John he was that eagle
[50:25] anointing but now want no no wonder no
[50:29] wonder that that whenever they would
[50:32] refer to John throughout the early
[50:35] Christian Movement they would not be
[50:37] able to understand John because John was
[50:40] not an Earthly creature John was a
[50:43] Heavenly creature because he was the
[50:45] eagle amen yes so you had you had
[50:50] Matthew which was the lion he was an
[50:52] Earthly creature right remember uh uh
[50:56] this was uh the the when brother Bon
[50:58] refers to the Beast he's talking about a
[51:02] Powers right and so there was three
[51:05] Earthly powers that was that was there
[51:08] to combat brother benam as he tells us
[51:12] those four living creatures was to
[51:14] combat that Antichrist spirit that that
[51:17] white horse rider that Antichrist Spirit
[51:19] running through the
[51:21] ages is that right and so and so when
[51:24] when that when that white horse rid was
[51:26] loose God sent a lion anointing to
[51:30] combat that Antichrist
[51:33] Spirit but now watch in the last in the
[51:37] last Beast that was a Heavenly
[51:41] creature the first three were
[51:44] Earthly but the last four was Heaven the
[51:47] last the very last one was Heavenly so
[51:50] so really in essence the reason why they
[51:53] couldn't understand John is because it
[51:55] wasn't for their age
[51:57] they they were living under a sealed
[51:59] book it was it was a it was not a
[52:03] Heavenly anointing being released to
[52:05] them amen yes but in this last age this
[52:09] last anointing would be a Heavenly
[52:12] anointing a flying eagle that we would
[52:16] not have to live in the Molly grubs but
[52:19] we would have the Power released to us
[52:22] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit to
[52:24] soar in the heavenlies to Fly Above the
[52:27] storms of lady oia God gave us the
[52:31] ability listen remember that black horse
[52:34] rider it was still an Earthly
[52:38] power that he that that that horse was
[52:41] an Earthly power and it's no match for a
[52:45] flying eagle because we are called and
[52:48] anointed to SAR in the
[52:53] heavenli praise the Lord yes amen are
[52:57] y'all with
[52:58] me so so so John being that eagle he he
[53:03] was he
[53:04] was uh he he should be special to us
[53:10] yes right Glory so when we see John we
[53:15] ought to see ourselves amen right yes
[53:19] now let's let's um I've got this is
[53:24] about a prob about a five-part series
[53:26] I'm trying to shrink down into two so
[53:29] bear with me we won we will just hit the
[53:30] highlights of it amen what I what I'd
[53:32] like to do is take you to Israel but
[53:37] then I want to take you to the seven
[53:38] Church ages highlighted there in red
[53:41] with me now watch when you go to the
[53:44] seven Church ages Ephesus Sam pram Saar
[53:49] Sardis
[53:51] Philadelphia lady oia watch how a pat
[53:57] remember when John caught the revelation
[54:00] of the Book of Revelations he was on the
[54:02] aisle of patmas is that right yes so
[54:05] think about this even
[54:10] geographically John had to come out of
[54:12] her my people to catch the Revelation
[54:16] amen amen praise
[54:19] God
[54:21] Amen
[54:23] yes so so if John
[54:27] had to come out of cuz remember he was
[54:30] the Ephesian Pastor yeah right right
[54:32] shouldn't we have to come out of H my
[54:34] people if we want to catch the
[54:35] Revelation yes amen
[54:38] amen praise the Lord is that shows how
[54:41] perfect God's gospel is amen so so even
[54:45] geographically God would be expressing
[54:47] something to us because remember the
[54:50] aisle of patness was not a pleasant
[54:52] place right but God sometime puts us on
[54:55] an aisle of P
[54:57] to get us to stop looking around and
[54:59] start waiting for the vision remember
[55:02] brother bam tells us that those visions
[55:05] that John received they covered a
[55:07] two-year
[55:09] period now so when you sit down and you
[55:11] read the book of Revelations you can
[55:14] read it in an afternoon but John didn't
[55:16] receive it in an afternoon he received
[55:19] it over at two years span before he
[55:22] could catch the full revelation of the
[55:25] book of ref
[55:26] rations and so one minute he would catch
[55:29] a vision the next minute he'd see a
[55:33] scorpion yes yes it's kind of like what
[55:37] like we
[55:40] do we tat a revelation from God and then
[55:43] we deal with the
[55:47] devil praise the Lord friends don't
[55:49] don't think it strange concerning the
[55:51] fiery trials that that are there around
[55:54] you it's for a p
[55:57] amen amen and John brother bam tells us
[56:01] that John remember after he turned from
[56:04] Almas only thing he could say was little
[56:08] children love one another am
[56:13] amen see sometimes it takes an AIS of
[56:16] patmas before we can catch the true love
[56:19] of
[56:20] God he found there was something
[56:24] real and that was was this disciple that
[56:27] wanted to call fire down on the city and
[56:30] burn them up and they wouldn't give
[56:31] enough to eat John the bride yes but yet
[56:37] the bride can still get
[56:39] carnal remember he wanted to be like a
[56:42] li C fire down from heaven we ain't
[56:45] called to be like brother brandom and P
[56:47] eagle belck and a cowboy
[56:53] haty we called the P the Holy Spirit
[56:57] yes
[56:58] amen prise the
[57:00] Lord and so John this is so beautiful if
[57:05] you wanna I know I got PowerPoint but if
[57:07] you just
[57:08] uh keep the Book of John open yes
[57:12] sir uh and remember we we probably won't
[57:15] hit go through all of it but what I want
[57:16] this to do by the help of God is from
[57:21] now on when you read John you ought to
[57:23] read it differently yes because as we go
[57:27] through these scriptures Parables and
[57:31] stories everything that I show you in
[57:34] John is only in John amen so be mindful
[57:39] of that yes so if if John being the
[57:44] eagle and Matthew Mark and Luke do not
[57:47] put it in their
[57:49] three and John is only putting it in his
[57:52] wouldn't it be special for us yes amen
[57:56] yes yes would that not be a fair
[57:57] statement to make yes sir yes sir and
[58:00] and and and
[58:02] amazingly everything remember only thing
[58:04] I extract from John is when it's solely
[58:07] in John so if there's a story that's in
[58:10] Matthew Mark and Luke I leave it
[58:12] out but it's only those things that I
[58:14] found in
[58:16] John all right you with meise God God
[58:18] and you'll
[58:20] see it it it'll it'll it'll it'll
[58:23] testify to this message line by line by
[58:26] line by line matter of fact you give me
[58:29] the first chapter of John and I can
[58:31] preach to you this entire message that's
[58:33] right right yes yes shows how perfect it
[58:36] is Friends yes sir and so and so brother
[58:39] brand ain't shooting from the hip when
[58:40] he says these things remember he's
[58:42] hitting the highlights and he says
[58:44] Ministry is to dig down deep yes sir is
[58:46] that right so I read you one scripture
[58:48] and one quote and now we're gonna take
[58:50] this by the help of God by the Holy
[58:52] Spirit and I pray that he would loose it
[58:53] for us and we'd be able to see God's
[58:55] grace amen now remember John if you look
[59:00] at John he is he is that eagle so when
[59:03] he starts his book he doesn't start at
[59:06] the birth of Jesus nor does he start at
[59:09] the ministry of the Prophet for that day
[59:12] amen but he goes back to in the
[59:15] beginning was the word amen yes
[59:19] Hallelujah because remember he's he's
[59:23] Eagle anointed and so he wouldn't just
[59:26] start at the birth of Christ he would go
[59:28] back to the beginning of the creation of
[59:33] God you just you can't make this stuff
[59:35] up friends in the beginning was the word
[59:38] and the Word was with God and the Word
[59:41] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[59:43] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[59:47] the glory as that the only begotten of
[59:49] the father full of grace and truth now
[59:54] one thing that you'll catch in John
[59:57] John is constantly catching Jesus saying
[1:00:00] these things that he come from God and
[1:00:02] he goes back to God that he proceedeth
[1:00:05] and he come forth from God in 8:42 in
[1:00:08] John 133 that he come from God and went
[1:00:11] to God in John
[1:00:13] 15:26 the spirit of Truth would testify
[1:00:16] which proceedeth from the father and
[1:00:19] shall testify of me what John is telling
[1:00:22] us is what the prophet of God gave us in
[1:00:25] great description that whenever God he
[1:00:27] would say let's just stand across the
[1:00:29] bister of time and he sees that when God
[1:00:32] said let there be in that little L go
[1:00:34] appeared he said it was like a a son
[1:00:37] playing before
[1:00:39] father that's what Jesus is saying when
[1:00:41] he said I proceed if it come from God
[1:00:45] that was the
[1:00:47] lust right and John catches these things
[1:00:52] I just gave you three just so you can
[1:00:54] see there's there's many more in
[1:00:57] John but uh which is so beautiful
[1:01:01] because John is the eagle and so he's
[1:01:04] going to catch details that Luke The
[1:01:07] Physician
[1:01:10] cannot because Luke is a man he's a
[1:01:13] physician yes right Mark is is an ox
[1:01:17] he's sacrificial Matthew is a lion right
[1:01:21] and that's the anointing that they
[1:01:22] worked under but John worked under the
[1:01:25] prophetic e anointing and so he's going
[1:01:28] to look things a lot deeper than just
[1:01:31] superficial now one thing beautiful John
[1:01:34] separates in the very first chapter he
[1:01:37] he he he
[1:01:39] realizes that the prophet of God was not
[1:01:42] God Amen but he realizes that the
[1:01:46] prophet of that hour came from
[1:01:51] God so so he has the ability to separate
[1:01:54] separate the the profit from from God
[1:01:59] Amen just like this bride does in this
[1:02:02] last
[1:02:02] day right he says there was a man sent
[1:02:06] from God whose name was John amen I mean
[1:02:10] came from God
[1:02:12] yes how about the other twoth thirds of
[1:02:15] you where' you come from how many many
[1:02:17] came from God he come from God and we're
[1:02:20] going back to
[1:02:22] God don't just leave it at Jesus don't
[1:02:24] just leave it at and John and brother
[1:02:26] Brandon friends you got to see yourself
[1:02:29] here right and the same came for a
[1:02:32] witness to Bear witness of that light
[1:02:36] that all men through him might believe
[1:02:38] watch he was not that
[1:02:41] light but he was sent to Bear witness of
[1:02:45] that light amen amen now John the
[1:02:49] disciple is differentiating the prophit
[1:02:53] of the hour from the word of God made
[1:02:55] flesh
[1:02:56] yes yes right now also John gives lots
[1:03:02] of description on the prophet of the
[1:03:05] age which it have to be
[1:03:09] right now something else that that you
[1:03:12] will see um is
[1:03:17] John now this is something that you'll
[1:03:19] have to read all the gospel to catch but
[1:03:22] John never alludes to
[1:03:24] himself he's always Peter and the and
[1:03:27] the other disciple that ran to the tomb
[1:03:29] or the disciple whom Jesus loved or the
[1:03:32] disciple who landed on the breast of
[1:03:35] Jesus and so John here right here in
[1:03:38] John
[1:03:39] 135 again the next day stood stood after
[1:03:42] John stood and two of his disciples now
[1:03:46] if you read this whole story he names
[1:03:48] one
[1:03:49] Andrew but he doesn't name the other now
[1:03:52] this is just me I don't have a quote for
[1:03:53] this so you can set it leave it right
[1:03:55] beside you on the Pew that's fine uh but
[1:03:58] but but to me you you see uh John right
[1:04:02] here if you read the whole story now
[1:04:04] watch and looking Upon Jesus as he
[1:04:07] walked he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:04:10] now the prophet of this day introduced
[1:04:12] the manifested word of God and watch the
[1:04:16] two disciples followed and heard him
[1:04:18] speak and they followed
[1:04:22] Jesus so now you see the the the the the
[1:04:26] disciples making a turning a corner and
[1:04:29] transitioning as brother bham tells us
[1:04:32] in what is the attraction on the mount
[1:04:34] the prophet turn behold there comes the
[1:04:36] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:04:38] the world now what's the attraction it
[1:04:40] changed from the prophet to his
[1:04:45] prophecy and so we see when John
[1:04:48] introduced the Messiah now it changed
[1:04:52] from the prophet of that hour to what
[1:04:54] the prophet said
[1:04:56] the same way friends we are today we are
[1:05:00] holding to our Prophet the messenger but
[1:05:02] we're not holding to him so much that
[1:05:05] we're not beholding who he's pointing
[1:05:10] to Hallelujah now watch in John 3:24
[1:05:15] we're going to bounce around just a
[1:05:16] little bit now he gives details about
[1:05:18] John being cast into prison then there
[1:05:21] arose a question between some of the
[1:05:22] John's disciples and the Jews about
[1:05:25] purifying
[1:05:26] and they came unto John and said unto
[1:05:28] him Rabbi he that was with the Beyond
[1:05:32] Jordan to whom thou bear witness behold
[1:05:35] the same baptizes and all men come to
[1:05:38] him John answered and said a man can
[1:05:42] receive nothing except to be given him
[1:05:45] from Heaven amen ye yourselves bear
[1:05:47] witness bear me witness that I said I am
[1:05:50] not the
[1:05:52] Christ but that I am
[1:05:54] sent before
[1:05:56] him he that hath the bride is the
[1:05:59] bridegroom but the friend of the
[1:06:02] bridegroom now John the disciple is
[1:06:05] catching John the Baptist position that
[1:06:08] he being the prophet is the friend of
[1:06:10] the bridegroom he catches the Jewish
[1:06:13] custom of that friend of the bridegroom
[1:06:15] that would be go before the bridegroom
[1:06:17] and would announce introduce the
[1:06:20] bridegroom to the bride after all those
[1:06:23] Jewish ceremonies for thousands of years
[1:06:26] John the disciple catches it and go this
[1:06:29] is him he's the friend of the bridegroom
[1:06:33] he's looking at it going this this is
[1:06:36] eler introducing us to
[1:06:40] is right now watch remember you only
[1:06:43] find this in John and which standeth and
[1:06:46] hearth and rejoices greatly because the
[1:06:48] bridegroom's voice this is my joy
[1:06:50] therefore is fulfilled he must increase
[1:06:54] but I must
[1:06:57] decrease so what is John telling us John
[1:07:00] is trying to identify to us that the
[1:07:03] prophet cannot be exalted above
[1:07:08] Christ that's what brother brenham's uh
[1:07:11] purpose was was just to introduce us to
[1:07:14] our
[1:07:18] Isaac and John is so perfectly catching
[1:07:21] it and pulling all this in yes Glory now
[1:07:24] watch if you you go to St John 5 Jesus
[1:07:28] he picks up what Jesus says about
[1:07:31] John Jesus he was a burning and Shining
[1:07:35] Light John the Baptist and you were
[1:07:39] willing for a
[1:07:41] season to rejoice in his
[1:07:44] life they were willing for a season to
[1:07:47] rejoice in the light of the prophet of
[1:07:49] the hour but it was just a
[1:07:53] season amen Hello friends yes is this
[1:07:56] not what's being fulfilled right now in
[1:07:59] our
[1:08:01] day they were willing for season to
[1:08:04] rejoice in this end time
[1:08:06] message I I don't want to just rejoice
[1:08:09] in this message for a season I want to
[1:08:11] for all
[1:08:12] eternity because the message is a
[1:08:14] person but search the scriptures for in
[1:08:18] them you think you have eternal life and
[1:08:20] they are they which testify of
[1:08:23] me do not think think that I will accuse
[1:08:26] you to the father there is one that
[1:08:29] accuses you even Moses in whom you trust
[1:08:31] watch what Jesus is doing Jesus they're
[1:08:34] they're trying to hold to this letter
[1:08:37] the dead letter but they're missing the
[1:08:39] manifested word right Jesus himself he
[1:08:43] says for had you believed Moses you
[1:08:46] would have believed me for he wrote Of
[1:08:48] Me
[1:08:50] amen see see how see how John is picking
[1:08:54] up on these things yes yes and he's
[1:08:58] picking up on these things because of of
[1:09:01] us because the same the the remember
[1:09:05] remember the the the same thing that
[1:09:07] happened at the first coming is going to
[1:09:08] happen at the second yes yes is that
[1:09:11] right yes and so all these things in a
[1:09:14] prefigure a type or a shadow are being
[1:09:17] unfolded and so when we see these things
[1:09:20] it it ought to it ought to encourage us
[1:09:22] when we see the things that are
[1:09:23] happening amongst our ranks it's not us
[1:09:25] just tremble and shake and you know
[1:09:27] sweep a quote underneath the rug and act
[1:09:29] like it's not
[1:09:31] there I don't know about you friends I'm
[1:09:33] not afraid of any quote I don't need to
[1:09:35] sweep any quote underneath the rug you
[1:09:37] know I I I came from a family would
[1:09:39] never deal with the issues and you know
[1:09:41] just we want to look happy and act like
[1:09:43] everything's all right we never want to
[1:09:44] deal with anything I don't I don't like
[1:09:47] that let's let's roll the sleeves up and
[1:09:49] let's get dirty let's figure it out
[1:09:51] let's work it out let's fix it yes sir
[1:09:53] yes sir we ain't got nothing to be
[1:09:54] afraid of friend you go sweeping a quot
[1:09:57] underneath the rug something's wrong
[1:09:58] with your
[1:09:59] Revelation right right amen now let's go
[1:10:04] back to St John chapter one and watch
[1:10:07] what Jesus does when Philip finds
[1:10:11] Nathaniel and we know the story and
[1:10:13] Nathaniel says to him you know he they
[1:10:16] say Philip says that he had found the
[1:10:18] Messiah and nael said Can there any good
[1:10:21] thing come out of Nazareth and he says
[1:10:23] come and see and so when Jesus Jus saw
[1:10:26] sees Nathaniel coming he tells him
[1:10:28] behold an Israelite and indeed whom is
[1:10:30] no gu and so Jesus does the Messiah sign
[1:10:34] yes yes Glory yes what Jesus is doing
[1:10:40] right there when when he discerns in 147
[1:10:44] is actually second
[1:10:48] pool can I get an amen from
[1:10:50] Pastor yes sir now
[1:10:53] watch after and he tells him he said
[1:10:56] when did you see me he said when you
[1:10:57] under the Fig Tree I saw you but now
[1:11:00] watch what I have highlighted and and
[1:11:03] and whenever Nathaniel he says Rabbi
[1:11:06] Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the
[1:11:07] king of Israel Jesus answered him
[1:11:11] because I said unto thee I saw thee
[1:11:13] under the Fig Tree thou believest Thou
[1:11:16] shalt see greater things than these and
[1:11:18] he said verily verily I say unto you
[1:11:21] Hereafter because you reive the second
[1:11:24] pool
[1:11:26] heaven will be open and the angels of
[1:11:28] God will be ascending and descending
[1:11:31] upon the son of man now what Jesus is
[1:11:35] doing he is reflecting first second and
[1:11:37] third pool all right here because St
[1:11:40] John 51 is is the third pool Ministry
[1:11:44] because remember what what what what
[1:11:47] happened what happened on Sunset
[1:11:52] Mountain yes sir what what happened when
[1:11:55] that cloud
[1:11:57] appeared amen what happened when that
[1:12:00] prophet of God went back and preach
[1:12:03] those seals yes brother Brenham tells us
[1:12:07] each angel came each day revealing the
[1:12:10] Loose
[1:12:12] Ends and so when you read the SE when
[1:12:14] you listen to or read the seals brother
[1:12:17] brandham says an angel came to him every
[1:12:20] day and so it was what Jesus is saying
[1:12:24] because you receive this Messiah sign by
[1:12:27] believing to
[1:12:29] discernment you are going to see the
[1:12:31] angels of God us sending and descending
[1:12:34] upon the son of man and so what did we
[1:12:37] see in 63 we saw the angels of God Serv
[1:12:41] of ascending and descending upon a son
[1:12:44] of man he was a son of man revealing the
[1:12:48] son of
[1:12:49] [Applause]
[1:12:50] man
[1:12:53] Hallelujah are y'all with me Glory
[1:12:56] Glory Wonder so so so John is catching
[1:13:01] all this and so in the very first
[1:13:04] chapter of
[1:13:05] John you see the message of the hour in
[1:13:09] typ and
[1:13:13] Shadow am I
[1:13:16] crazy praise the Lord yes sir now
[1:13:20] watch after this immediately after the
[1:13:24] first chapter
[1:13:27] Jesus is at a marriage
[1:13:30] supper right right
[1:13:33] beautiful and he does his first miracle
[1:13:36] yes and he
[1:13:39] turns the water yes into Revelation
[1:13:45] amen yes he does
[1:13:48] Amen when you receive the son of man
[1:13:52] Ministry this water becomes wine
[1:13:58] remember when Jesus goes to to to the to
[1:14:01] the marriage they're out of wine right
[1:14:04] there's six water pots Jesus is the
[1:14:09] seventh he fills them to the brim and
[1:14:12] then he says pour out and when they
[1:14:14] begin to drink they say you save the
[1:14:16] best Revelation to the end of the
[1:14:19] marriage supp amen
[1:14:22] amen praise God
[1:14:31] glor oh my brother that's right
[1:14:35] you it just shows how perfect this
[1:14:38] message is this is what I this is what I
[1:14:40] I hope it does for you because you know
[1:14:43] you can take the Old Testament but it
[1:14:45] God doesn't change his
[1:14:47] pattern and and and brother Brandon
[1:14:50] wasn't smart enough to pull all these
[1:14:52] things out and to place them so perfect
[1:14:56] so that somebody 60 50 years ago could
[1:14:59] preach this to you this morning without
[1:15:01] using a
[1:15:06] quote FY it's beautiful it's perfect not
[1:15:09] because I compiled it because it's the
[1:15:11] word of God right it's God's pattern
[1:15:14] he's beautiful and how he works now
[1:15:17] watch and and then after he does this
[1:15:20] and we're going to skip some because St
[1:15:22] John Chapter 2 Jesus uh Beats out of the
[1:15:25] temple with a with a braided Whip and uh
[1:15:29] that's a beautiful story in
[1:15:31] itself
[1:15:33] uh let me just this is just me I can't I
[1:15:36] can't some of this stuff I can't give
[1:15:37] you a quote but it's just types and
[1:15:38] shadows if you look at St John Chapter 2
[1:15:41] Jesus braids the whip that's at the
[1:15:43] beginning of his ministry yes sir yes
[1:15:45] sir and he beats him out when he goes
[1:15:47] down to descend of the Mount of Olives
[1:15:49] he beats them out of the temple again
[1:15:51] that's in uh I can't remember Matthew
[1:15:53] Mark somewhere around there and and so
[1:15:55] there's two beatings of the cleansing of
[1:15:57] the temple God's perfect in three yes
[1:16:01] when's the third come we are the temple
[1:16:04] right and what it's not beating us out
[1:16:06] it's not legalism it's receiving the
[1:16:08] baptism of the Holy Spirit that's what
[1:16:09] the purif purification comes yes amen
[1:16:12] and Jesus was showing two is not
[1:16:14] Perfection it's three
[1:16:16] yes amen yes praise the Lord now and
[1:16:21] then in St John chapter 3 after he gives
[1:16:24] his first
[1:16:25] Miracle then he gives his first Doctrine
[1:16:29] all these things are in John just to
[1:16:31] remember and so he gives us the first
[1:16:34] doctrine of being born again I want you
[1:16:36] to notice the order and the significance
[1:16:38] of it because all of the seals and all
[1:16:42] those things are important but the most
[1:16:45] important thing is being born
[1:16:47] again
[1:16:49] yes it's his first Doctrine and his
[1:16:53] first miracle his first miracle was
[1:16:55] really testifying of the first Doctrine
[1:16:57] yes amen
[1:16:59] yes Glory Glory now and so and then also
[1:17:04] something else that you're going to find
[1:17:06] when you read John is John is one that
[1:17:10] is constantly over and over and over in
[1:17:13] the scriptures giving the evidence of
[1:17:14] being born again yes yes
[1:17:18] yes you know that me knows the testimony
[1:17:21] of sister Bruce right yes yes remember
[1:17:24] she had the holy ghost but she didn't
[1:17:25] know she did right you know and that was
[1:17:27] the first that's the only time there was
[1:17:28] a discernment that was recorded or a
[1:17:30] private interview listen that was good
[1:17:34] but that don't mean we all just base our
[1:17:36] testimony on sister Bruce right right
[1:17:39] right right because when you take the
[1:17:42] scriptures we have to know knowing we
[1:17:46] have the Holy Ghost in first John 1 one
[1:17:49] and verse two he says for the life was
[1:17:51] manifested and we have seen it and bear
[1:17:54] Witness and show it unto you that
[1:17:57] eternal life which was with the father
[1:17:59] when was manifested unto us which we
[1:18:02] have seen and heard declare we unto you
[1:18:08] yes they they didn't point you to an
[1:18:10] iPad they didn't point you to a book
[1:18:12] they showed it to you amen we ought to
[1:18:15] be able to show people eternal life
[1:18:18] Hallelujah
[1:18:19] glory in in St John excuse me 1 John 2:3
[1:18:24] and here hereby we do know we we do know
[1:18:28] that we know him if we keep his
[1:18:31] Commandments he that saith I know him
[1:18:35] and keepeth not his Commandments is a
[1:18:37] liar and the truth is not in him but who
[1:18:40] so keepeth his word in him verily is the
[1:18:43] love of God perfected hereby know we are
[1:18:48] in him amen yes how do we know that
[1:18:52] we're born again because we are we are
[1:18:55] not contrary to the word of God but we
[1:18:58] are the word of
[1:19:00] God and and I we're not talking about
[1:19:02] just talking about the seals we're
[1:19:03] talking about every jot and T of the
[1:19:06] message
[1:19:08] am I believe we ought to live a Holiness
[1:19:10] life don't you that's right amen amen I
[1:19:13] believe we ought to live righteous
[1:19:14] before man and God hallelujah I'm not
[1:19:17] I'm not saved by works but my life ought
[1:19:20] to testify on Wednesdays amen yes
[1:19:26] yes Glory
[1:19:30] Glory first John 4:4 ye are of God
[1:19:33] little children and have overcome them I
[1:19:36] want you to notice little
[1:19:38] ones it's just so beautiful John
[1:19:41] actually talks to the little
[1:19:43] ones because remember John's trying to
[1:19:46] catch the little ones before Satan
[1:19:50] does amen glory that's right beautiful
[1:19:53] you little ones don't don't just turn
[1:19:55] off once you once Sunday school's over
[1:19:57] but you pay attention because God wants
[1:19:59] to talk to you just as much as he wanted
[1:20:01] to talk to brother Jesse amen you know
[1:20:03] you know this is inside note but times
[1:20:05] where a preacher come up and he's just

[1:21:17] spirit of truth and the spirit of error
[1:21:20] yes sir another beautiful thing we'll
[1:21:23] get into later on probably this even
[1:21:24] evening John is is always hammering on
[1:21:27] the truth the spirit of Truth he's want
[1:21:29] to capitalizes on that because this is
[1:21:31] the hour we have truth amen amen right

[1:21:38] that we're saved how do we know we're
[1:21:39] born again by Calvary yes God so loved
[1:21:43] the world as Moses lifted up the serpent
[1:21:45] in the wilderness even so must the son
[1:21:47] of man be lifted
[1:21:49] up
[1:21:51] glory and we know St John 3:16 for God
[1:21:54] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:21:56] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:21:59] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:22:01] have ever
[1:22:03] lasting life amen Jesus is talking this

[1:23:48] man from Kentucky it's the word of God
[1:23:51] for our
[1:23:53] day right glory and so and so when and
[1:23:56] so Jesus begins to discern her heart and
[1:23:59] he tells her God is a spirit and they
[1:24:02] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:24:05] spirit and in truth amen and so Jesus
[1:24:09] lays down this principle for her and we
[1:24:11] know the story she said come see a man
[1:24:14] come see a man that's told me you know
[1:24:15] and she ended up she ended up turning
[1:24:18] from a harlot to a messenger of God
[1:24:25] hello right now brother brandham takes
[1:24:28] this and he says and look at that little
[1:24:31] old illame woman she recognized it she
[1:24:34] wasn't
[1:24:47] indocumentadas not how big you are or
[1:24:50] how little you are he judges your heart
[1:24:53] what you want to be amen hallelujah
[1:24:58] praise the Lord for that Hallelujah and
[1:25:00] she didn't want none of that stuff and
[1:25:03] when this flashed before her that's what
[1:25:06] she wanted no matter what she was then
[1:25:08] she was ready to come see God judges the
[1:25:12] heart amen glory glory man judges the
[1:25:16] outward
[1:25:17] appearance God looks upon the heart no
[1:25:20] matter what she was that light flashed
[1:25:22] in that settlement she brought the
[1:25:25] essence of eternal life amen
[1:25:29] beautiful that little woman standing at
[1:25:32] the well in all that dirty condition
[1:25:34] that she was what did that
[1:25:38] symbolize so now the prophet of God says
[1:25:42] this was a
[1:25:44] symbol remember she's only in
[1:25:47] John right right the woman in the well
[1:25:50] is not in Matthew Mark or Luke beautiful
[1:25:52] only in John bride
[1:25:54] amen what did she symbolize that God in
[1:25:58] these last days would pull out
[1:26:09] out that that woman being ill Fame uh
[1:26:14] sit all kind of messed up baggage wow
[1:26:18] wow and she was a type an expression of
[1:26:21] this last day
[1:26:22] bride that God would have somebody at
[1:26:26] his marriage
[1:26:29] table I want to be there don't you amen
[1:26:33] amen praise the Lord now after
[1:26:38] this he goes to uh the nobleman in St
[1:26:44] John
[1:26:45] 4:50
[1:26:47] um and this Noble woman had a man or had
[1:26:51] a son that was sick now uh uh in the
[1:26:54] other gospels this is to me uh brother
[1:26:58] B's not really clear on clear on this
[1:27:00] because he kind of combined the
[1:27:02] Centurion with this nobleman so I don't
[1:27:03] really know for certain but I don't know
[1:27:06] if this man was a gentile but even if he
[1:27:08] isn't he sure is expressing Gentile
[1:27:10] Faith yes yes because remember the
[1:27:13] Centurion had a servant the nobleman had
[1:27:16] a son yes and so this then Jesus when
[1:27:19] when he came to Jesus and and and he and
[1:27:22] he he he tells him his situation Jesus
[1:27:25] tells him in verse 50 go thy way thy son
[1:27:29] liveth and the man believed the word
[1:27:31] that had been spoken unto him and he
[1:27:34] went his way so this man believed the
[1:27:38] word that Jesus had spoken brother B
[1:27:41] takes this and he refers to this as
[1:27:43] Gentile Faith because uh Jews need
[1:27:46] something to touch lay your hands on
[1:27:48] there all these different things but but
[1:27:51] Gentiles just believe it I'm not wory
[1:27:54] for you to come under my roof but just
[1:27:56] speak the
[1:27:58] word right and so in verse his servants
[1:28:01] met him and said his son liveth verse 52
[1:28:05] then inquired he of them the hour when
[1:28:07] he had be to
[1:28:10] amend and they said unto him yesterday
[1:28:13] at
[1:28:14] the seventh hour amen the fever left him
[1:28:18] glory and so brother vam takes this he
[1:28:21] actually preached on this because this
[1:28:23] is actually the second Miracle brother B
[1:28:25] preached a message called the second
[1:28:26] miracle and he takes this and he says
[1:28:29] because it said he begin to amend so it
[1:28:32] wasn't an instantaneous healing but but
[1:28:35] he calls it a miracle anyways the
[1:28:37] scripture does says it was Jesus's
[1:28:38] second miracle and brother bam says
[1:28:40] seemingly we wouldn't call that a
[1:28:43] miracle but it was a Mira Miracle
[1:28:45] because anything out of the ordinary
[1:28:48] it's
[1:28:50] Miracle so so so right now any say
[1:28:54] because we are here instead of having a
[1:28:57] hangover on Sunday morning we're here
[1:29:00] under the anointing of God and so right
[1:29:03] now anything that's out of the ordinary
[1:29:06] in lady oia is a
[1:29:12] miracle yes and so what is it we as
[1:29:15] Gentiles we just believe
[1:29:19] it brother benam says he says talking
[1:29:22] about faith he says
[1:29:24] next next has Faith that's deep it takes
[1:29:29] quite a little while some has Faith Like
[1:29:32] a mustard seed but if it's Mustard Seed
[1:29:35] Faith genuine Faith hold on to it keep
[1:29:39] believing it it'll become marble Faith
[1:29:42] then it'll become grapefruit faith and
[1:29:45] then it'll become Mountain
[1:29:48] Faith what he saying all we got to do is
[1:29:52] just believe amen amen just keep holding
[1:29:56] on
[1:29:58] Amen
[1:30:00] now is this okay yes wonderful Wonder
[1:30:03] praise the Lord now we just so you know
[1:30:05] we started about 45 minutes into this
[1:30:07] you know we about 15 minutes
[1:30:11] wonderful disclaim
[1:30:16] there all right um now we're going to go
[1:30:20] to St John chapter 6 and this is when
[1:30:24] Jesus is feeded fed to
[1:30:26] 5,000 now I want you to notice what
[1:30:29] happens because it's pretty striking
[1:30:31] what
[1:30:32] happens after Jesus feeds the 5,000 the
[1:30:36] Bible says in the 15th chapter that that
[1:30:40] when Jesus perceived that they would
[1:30:42] come and take him by force and make him
[1:30:44] a king he departed again alone into a
[1:30:48] mountain into a mountain himself alone
[1:30:52] so after Jesus feeds them and supplies
[1:30:55] their need they want to exalt him to a
[1:30:58] position of King amen but I want you to
[1:31:01] notice they're under the wrong
[1:31:04] anointing because they were bypassing
[1:31:07] Calvary and Redemption just to have a
[1:31:11] king over
[1:31:13] them amen now we're gonna we're going to
[1:31:17] skip over something and go back to it
[1:31:19] but Jesus picks this up in the 21st in
[1:31:22] this in the 25th verse
[1:31:24] and when they had found him on the other
[1:31:26] side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi
[1:31:29] when comest thou hither Jesus answered
[1:31:32] them said verily verily I say unto you
[1:31:35] you seek me not because you saw the
[1:31:38] Miracles but because you did eat of the
[1:31:40] Loaves and were
[1:31:45] filled now I want you to notice this is
[1:31:48] in only in John
[1:31:55] and it's
[1:32:00] actually because what is the hour my
[1:32:05] rights give
[1:32:08] me is that right it's it's you owe me
[1:32:13] right yeah it's it's uh it's the it's
[1:32:16] the government mentality of of you owe
[1:32:19] me you take care of me right
[1:32:24] uh sad sad to say when when they when
[1:32:27] they elected our President Obama they
[1:32:29] ran through the streets saying you know
[1:32:31] President Obama's gonna pay my
[1:32:33] rent right right they elected him
[1:32:36] because of the loaves right and the
[1:32:40] fishes right come on somebody f look at
[1:32:44] what is happening here in St John Jesus
[1:32:47] is saying you don't want me for miracles
[1:32:51] you want me for a
[1:32:52] handout wanted to make him a king they
[1:32:56] wanted to bypass Redemption and Calvary
[1:32:59] to exalt him to a place of kingship the
[1:33:02] same way we are lady oia when they vote
[1:33:05] they're not voting for what's right and
[1:33:07] what's wrong it's what you can do for
[1:33:13] me the Lord you won't find that the
[1:33:16] message so you can set that on the side
[1:33:17] few too but I can only say what I see so
[1:33:21] uh but but you see this in typ and
[1:33:23] Shadow friends this is this is this is
[1:33:27] John and so when and all I can show you
[1:33:29] is when not when you extract these
[1:33:31] things they're only in John so they got
[1:33:32] to before for us yes
[1:33:35] right and so remember brother ramam says
[1:33:38] every move that Jesus had had a
[1:33:40] significance and so when Jesus is saying
[1:33:43] these things only in John is for a
[1:33:45] purpose right now we're going to go back
[1:33:47] we're going to backtrack just a little
[1:33:49] bit into John and I want to take you to
[1:33:52] to there's Jerusalem on the map but we
[1:33:55] want to go to the north side of Israel
[1:33:58] to the Sea of
[1:34:00] Galilee and and we're going to go to
[1:34:03] when
[1:34:04] Jesus uh after he feeds the
[1:34:07] 5,000 he he he's he's as you see in St
[1:34:11] John
[1:34:12] 623 the Bible says after they went to
[1:34:15] capernium there was boats that came and
[1:34:18] they give us a description that when
[1:34:20] Jesus fed the multitude 5,000 they
[1:34:23] remember they were in the desert but
[1:34:24] they were somewhere near
[1:34:26] tiberious amen now it's very important
[1:34:31] because if it's somewhere in around
[1:34:33] Tiberius Jesus tells them to go to
[1:34:36] cernium yes everybody with me amen now
[1:34:40] if you take that it's about six and a
[1:34:43] quar miles from tiberias to capernium
[1:34:46] very important detail all right
[1:34:49] everybody with me so he just fed the
[1:34:52] 5,000 somewhere near capernium or Not N
[1:34:56] to Tiberius we see that 623 now I'm
[1:34:59] going to take you to St John
[1:35:02] 619 the Bible says when the evening was
[1:35:07] come very important evening time amen
[1:35:11] verse 19 so when they had rode about
[1:35:14] five or 20 or 30 furlongs that five and
[1:35:18] 20 thongs is about three miles
[1:35:25] okay now so they are somewhere about
[1:35:30] right
[1:35:32] there are y'all with me yes is that good
[1:35:35] amen does that make sense yes sir
[1:35:39] now everything is for a
[1:35:42] purpose
[1:35:47] Hallelujah and they draw and they they
[1:35:50] see Jesus walking on the sea
[1:35:54] and drawing nigh unto the ship and they
[1:35:58] were afraid right and he said unto them
[1:36:03] it is
[1:36:05] I don't be
[1:36:07] afraid right and so no doubt there's
[1:36:12] winds and waves and they're rowing and
[1:36:14] Rowing and they're trying to get
[1:36:18] somewhere and they're in the middle of
[1:36:20] their
[1:36:21] journey and the only thing that can say
[1:36:24] they're afraid
[1:36:28] of verse 21 is is now I gave you all
[1:36:32] this just for verse 21 the Bible says
[1:36:37] then
[1:36:39] they
[1:36:41] willingly yes
[1:36:47] amen when
[1:36:49] they
[1:36:51] willingly amen amen
[1:36:56] you can look at the winds look at the
[1:36:59] waves you look at your problems right
[1:37:03] you can point the finger to everybody
[1:37:04] else right amen
[1:37:07] yes but
[1:37:09] remember how many do I got point back at
[1:37:16] me so no matter who I point to
[1:37:20] yes now I got six point back at me right
[1:37:24] right so who's the
[1:37:26] problem no brother it's
[1:37:29] me that's me
[1:37:31] brother me
[1:37:34] brother he probably
[1:37:37] win but it
[1:37:39] says when
[1:37:41] they willing praise God praise God Jesus
[1:37:46] will not force his way into your ship
[1:37:49] amen amen you can roll and roll row and
[1:37:54] R you may get there but it was all you
[1:37:58] right so really what happened is there
[1:38:02] was actually a
[1:38:03] translation Glory yeah amen yes if you
[1:38:08] look at that immediately and run it
[1:38:09] through the Scriptures it means
[1:38:10] immediately it's not a Greek word that
[1:38:12] means something different so trust me we
[1:38:15] ain't got time to go into it but you
[1:38:16] look at a Greek word it means
[1:38:17] immediately when they received him into
[1:38:20] the
[1:38:21] ship and iMed medely the ship was at the
[1:38:25] land whether they went Jesus wasn't
[1:38:28] dealing with the 5,000 the multitude he
[1:38:31] was dealing with
[1:38:34] elect amen yes Glory so he said brother
[1:38:38] brother G I'm bride okay you still got a
[1:38:40] will so what yes yes you still got a
[1:38:43] will I don't care how much bride you are
[1:38:46] you still are a
[1:38:48] problem I'm still a problem amen we we
[1:38:52] have got to get to that spot if Jesus in
[1:38:54] The Garden of Gethsemane the word of God
[1:38:57] the word of God the Son of God God made
[1:39:00] flesh would say not my will
[1:39:04] yes but that be done amen what are we as
[1:39:08] sinful man Redeemed by that precious
[1:39:10] blood right ought to say Amen it's my
[1:39:14] will I'm the
[1:39:16] one I'm the Man
[1:39:19] Hallelujah right amen they immediately
[1:39:23] so so here's the thing what what we
[1:39:25] ought to take from this is when we're in
[1:39:27] a circumstance and we're trying to get
[1:39:29] somewhere the problem of it is is not
[1:39:32] getting there the problem of it is is
[1:39:34] letting Jesus in the ship get you
[1:39:38] there Jesus Jesus Will separate himself
[1:39:41] and go in the mountain you know kind of
[1:39:42] like the eagle looking down at his
[1:39:44] Eagle go in the mountain to pray but his
[1:39:47] eye was on the Little Eagles playing
[1:39:49] they we do
[1:39:55] right right you know how children
[1:39:57] getting like we all like father how many
[1:39:59] fathers is in here and we see him when
[1:40:02] we see him struggling and we like Papa
[1:40:04] Eagle let me show you how to do it right
[1:40:07] right amen because Papa Eagle knows how
[1:40:10] to do it yes and by the way if you're a
[1:40:13] real daddy Papa Eagle loves to do it for
[1:40:16] yeah loves to instruct them yes let me
[1:40:19] do it with you yes praise God
[1:40:25] and so they were immediately at the ship
[1:40:27] whether they went now after this Jesus
[1:40:31] feeds them but he's not feeding them
[1:40:32] just for anything any reason after Jesus
[1:40:35] does this miracle he unfolds himself in
[1:40:39] another characteristic and he says I am
[1:40:41] the bread of
[1:40:44] life praise God praise God now he says
[1:40:49] I'm the living bread which came down
[1:40:51] from heaven If any man eat this bread he
[1:40:54] shall live and the bread that I will
[1:40:57] give is my flesh which is I will give
[1:40:59] for the life of the world then Jesus
[1:41:01] said unto them verily verily I say unto
[1:41:04] you except you eat the Flesh of the son
[1:41:06] of man and drink his blood you'll have
[1:41:09] no life in
[1:41:10] you and the doctors and the Physicians
[1:41:13] and the nurses said this man's a
[1:41:15] vampire that's right right and he didn't
[1:41:18] explain it amen amen yes just the same
[1:41:21] way he he'll he'll let listen to a tape
[1:41:24] and he won't explain it just to see your
[1:41:27] reaction
[1:41:29] amen yes and if you say oh nothing to it
[1:41:33] into you
[1:41:37] go a frog plop plop go right Amen
[1:41:41] brother we don't want
[1:41:43] Frogs We want rainbow

[1:41:49] you'll be on the bank flipping and
[1:41:50] flopping I don't know but it's good
[1:41:52] brother
[1:41:55] I don't understand it but I love
[1:41:59] it Hallelujah now and we see in St John
[1:42:05] 666 now you only find that I believe
[1:42:07] it's in first or 2 Chronicles chapter in
[1:42:10] verse 666 and we know this is the
[1:42:12] marking of the Beast yes sir only in
[1:42:15] John by the
[1:42:16] way wow wow yes sir from that time many
[1:42:21] of his disciples went back and walk no

[1:42:26] reject the Seal of God you receive the
[1:42:28] mark of the beast yes sir yes
[1:42:31] sir yes sir then said Jesus unto the 12
[1:42:36] now what he didn't sugarcoat
[1:42:39] it right you ever know you ever notice
[1:42:42] like preachers are becoming more like
[1:42:44] politicians even in the message yeah
[1:42:47] right I wonder if a listen to The
[1:42:49] Prophet anymore right right
[1:42:55] right then Jesus said unto the 12 he

[1:46:06] the man that was born blind and in St
[1:46:09] John 11 there's the resurrection of
[1:46:11] Lazarus amen so in St John there's seven
[1:46:16] miracles before the resurrection praise
[1:46:19] God praise God and then after to the
[1:46:23] resurrection there's a great catch of
[1:46:28] fishes yes amen amen
[1:46:33] now in St John he gives himself seven
[1:46:38] characteristics of I am yes in St John 6
[1:46:44] he tells us that he's the bread of life
[1:46:47] in St John 8 he tells us that he's the
[1:46:49] light of the world Amen in St John 10 he
[1:46:52] said he's the door of the sheep in St
[1:46:55] John 10:1 he tells us that he's the Good
[1:46:57] Shepherd in St John 11 he tells us he's
[1:47:00] the resurrection and the life and in St
[1:47:03] John 14 he tells us he's the way the
[1:47:05] truth and the life and I want you to
[1:47:08] notice at the seventh
[1:47:17] characteristic he doesn't stop at just
[1:47:19] revealing himself amen amen
[1:47:23] but he actually reveals who you are
[1:47:29] too Glory
[1:47:33] Glory oh Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah
[1:47:37] because it's at the seventh
[1:47:39] age at this age bride
[1:47:44] age it can't just stop it brother
[1:47:46] Brandon right it can't stop at Jesus
[1:47:49] amen it has to come to the full measure
[1:47:52] yes GL I am Divine but
[1:47:56] you you are the
[1:47:59] branches I am present tense he reveals
[1:48:02] himself in the characteristics seven
[1:48:04] distinct characteristics only in John he
[1:48:07] reveals himself as the I am also in J St
[1:48:11] John 8:58 he just seals it up and says
[1:48:14] before Abraham was I
[1:48:18] am all right
[1:48:21] now now then watch in St John 7 verse1
[1:48:27] this is this is uh this is very
[1:48:30] significant now remember uh when John
[1:48:33] wrote this he didn't write chapter 7
[1:48:35] verse
[1:48:36] one right right right but some man later
[1:48:39] on down the road added every chapter and
[1:48:43] verse yes sir yes sir but God knew where
[1:48:47] the chapters and verses was when he
[1:48:49] anointed John to write the book amen
[1:48:52] right right yes so the significance at
[1:48:55] St John chapter 7 would have to be vital
[1:48:58] to the seventh age wouldn't it yes yes
[1:49:01] it would have to right and it
[1:49:05] is now very important because in verse
[1:49:09] two he gives us the description that
[1:49:12] it's the Feast of Tabernacles was at
[1:49:14] hand now the Feast of Tabernacles how
[1:49:17] many knows that there's seven feasts yes
[1:49:19] sir unto the
[1:49:20] Lord how many knows where the the Feast
[1:49:23] of Tabernacles is that preach it brother
[1:49:26] that's thank you sir yes yes sir the
[1:49:29] Feast of Tabernacles was the last Feast
[1:49:32] yes the seventh Feast so in St John 7 is
[1:49:38] the last Feast now watch now there's a
[1:49:42] turmoil in Jesus's immediate family
[1:49:46] because his Brethren is confused not his
[1:49:51] disciples remember he has four brothers
[1:49:54] and sisters right
[1:49:57] right amen yes now and so we see that uh
[1:50:05] remember he talks about Mary you know
[1:50:07] your mother and your brothers outside it
[1:50:08] was his brethren in Matthew 13:55 was
[1:50:12] James Joseph Simon and Judas he had
[1:50:15] sisters so Jesus had brothers and
[1:50:17] sisters by the scriptures but I want you
[1:50:20] to notice in St John 7 Brethren are
[1:50:24] confused yes
[1:50:27] yes therefore they said unto him depart
[1:50:30] hence and go to Judah that thy disciples
[1:50:33] Also may see the work that thou doest
[1:50:36] now and it says for there now watch
[1:50:39] their confusion for there is no man that
[1:50:41] doeth anything in secret and he himself
[1:50:44] seeketh to be known openly if thou do
[1:50:47] these things show thyself unto the world
[1:50:49] for neither did his his Brethren believe
[1:50:51] in him and he tells him go up unto the
[1:50:54] feast I go not up yet unto this Feast
[1:50:56] for my time is not yet full
[1:50:59] come his Brethren is confused because
[1:51:04] they're saying if this message was real
[1:51:07] the whole world would know God wow wow
[1:51:10] just like they're saying if brother
[1:51:12] Brandon was a prophet how come nobody
[1:51:14] knows about it right right brother amen
[1:51:18] yes right
[1:51:19] good I read it out of the book friends
[1:51:23] and so his Brethren at this St John 7 at
[1:51:27] the Feast of Tabernacles there's a
[1:51:30] turmoil in his immediate family just
[1:51:33] like some of us are treated like we're
[1:51:35] crazy by our family oh William
[1:51:39] Brown right right but let me let me give
[1:51:43] you a little bit of encouragement though
[1:51:45] they're confused in St John 7 if you
[1:51:48] read Acts chapter 1 I think 13 and 14
[1:51:51] Mary and his brethren go into the upper
[1:51:56] room Mary and his brother go in the
[1:51:58] upper room they get the baptism of the
[1:52:00] holy spirit so they miss Jesus but they
[1:52:03] caught the Holy
[1:52:09] Ghost so just hold on Friends be
[1:52:13] salty when they don't understand you you
[1:52:16] still be salty am don't don't get mad
[1:52:20] that's when you show your colors yes and
[1:52:22] if you fly up and you want to blast them
[1:52:25] something's wrong with
[1:52:27] you you get all hoty and high minded
[1:52:30] something's wrong with your
[1:52:34] spirit that's right Jesus didn't do
[1:52:37] anything he didn't act up amen
[1:52:41] waitting they missed it for a season but
[1:52:44] he knew they'd catch it and we have to
[1:52:46] have that same faith for our families
[1:52:48] Glory beautiful amen you read that in
[1:52:51] Acts chapter one I believe or 14 now I I
[1:52:55] want I want you to notice Let me just I
[1:52:57] missed this part brother Brandon tells
[1:53:00] in future homie says the Feast of
[1:53:01] Tabernacles was the last Feast the
[1:53:04] seventh Feast we are worshiping now
[1:53:06] under the Feast of Tabernacles the
[1:53:08] seventh Church age right right okay so
[1:53:11] I'm not not just shooting from the hip
[1:53:12] on this so so now we
[1:53:15] see he tells him to go up for his time
[1:53:18] has not yet come now in verse n when he
[1:53:22] said unto these he had had said unto
[1:53:25] these words unto them he Abode still in
[1:53:27] Galilee but when his Brethren were gone
[1:53:30] up they went they went he also up unto
[1:53:34] the
[1:53:38] feast
[1:53:41] I but as it
[1:53:46] were right
[1:53:50] right kind of like the
[1:53:53] sealed
[1:53:55] mystery yes sir yes
[1:54:01] right and so Jesus is playing all these
[1:54:05] things out and Jesus is hiding himself
[1:54:10] in the last Feast
[1:54:13] secretly praise
[1:54:16] God
[1:54:18] now now about the mid this this Feast of
[1:54:21] Tabernacle was lasted seven days so in
[1:54:24] the midst of this 7day Feast Jesus goes
[1:54:28] up to the
[1:54:29] temple and he begins to
[1:54:33] teach Glory Glory he begins to
[1:54:39] unloose amen it begins to unfold now
[1:54:43] remember what did what did the angel
[1:54:44] tell brother brandom about the third
[1:54:47] pool be a public show amen praise God
[1:54:51] beautiful right it'll be a secret and
[1:54:56] Jesus is doing the same thing when when
[1:54:59] he comes in the middle his Feast
[1:55:03] secretly now watch now as as he begins
[1:55:08] to unfold himself watch what they say in
[1:55:12] 7:25 then some of them then some of them
[1:55:15] of Jerusalem is not this he whom they
[1:55:18] seek to kill but Lo he speaketh boldly
[1:55:21] and they say nothing unto him do the
[1:55:23] rulers know indeed that this is the very
[1:55:25] Christ watch the
[1:55:27] confusion Jesus manifested flesh notice
[1:55:32] the confusion in the
[1:55:36] church how be it we know that this man
[1:55:40] when he is but when Christ cometh no man
[1:55:43] know whence he is so now they're
[1:55:47] confused about Jesus and denying him to
[1:55:50] be the Christ right verse 28 then cried
[1:55:54] Jesus in the temple as he taught
[1:55:57] saying you know me and you know whence I
[1:56:01] am he's telling them you know exactly
[1:56:05] who I am just like Nicodemus said Lord
[1:56:08] we know that our teacher come from God
[1:56:10] cuz no man can do these things but
[1:56:13] because of their denominational
[1:56:16] differences they would not accepted
[1:56:19] amen
[1:56:21] yes he says and I am not come of myself
[1:56:24] but he that sent me is true whom you
[1:56:26] know not but I know him for I am from
[1:56:28] him and he that sent me then they sought
[1:56:32] to take him but no man laid hands on
[1:56:34] because th not yet come and many of the
[1:56:36] people believed on him and said when
[1:56:39] Christ cometh I want you to notice there
[1:56:41] they Believing on him but they're not
[1:56:43] seeing him for what he truly is yes yes
[1:56:46] yes will he do more miracles than these
[1:56:49] which this man doeth notice what they're
[1:56:51] doing brother Bram this same thing
[1:56:53] happened in our
[1:56:55] age brother brandham tells us this he
[1:56:58] says oh you false teachers listening to
[1:57:01] these tapes all these years and seeing
[1:57:03] God confirm exactly what he said and you
[1:57:06] sat in your study and know it's the
[1:57:10] truth right and because of your
[1:57:14] denominational differences you dispute
[1:57:16] them and tell your people not that it's
[1:57:17] not not so woe unto you your time is
[1:57:21] close at hand amen and the same thing is
[1:57:24] happening as Jesus is in the midst of
[1:57:26] that Feast revealing himself the exact
[1:57:29] same thing is happening in a prefigure
[1:57:31] what happened in the first is happening
[1:57:33] in the second amen yes

[1:57:44] 12 you're only going to find this in St
[1:57:47] John you also find it in nine
[1:57:50] nevertheless among the chief rulers Al
[1:57:52] so many believed on him but because of
[1:57:54] the
[1:57:55] denomination they did not confess him
[1:57:58] lest they should be put out of the
[1:58:00] denomination right amen for they love
[1:58:04] the Praises of that denomination more
[1:58:07] than the Praises of
[1:58:10] God you won't find this in Matthew Mark
[1:58:12] or Luke you'll only find it in John W
[1:58:15] when they're being put out of the church
[1:58:19] you also find in St John chapter n when
[1:58:21] the man that's born blind is healed and

[2:02:27] yet glorified and so what is this

[2:02:55] Hunter
[2:02:57] and right I don't have either one of
[2:03:03] those but it's
[2:03:05] knowing that I heard the eagle cry yes
[2:03:09] yes and when I heard that eagle
[2:03:11] scream I realized

[2:03:17] at
[2:03:20] mine and I looked at her
[2:03:23] feet at my feet Yes
[2:03:27] yes I said if she can do
[2:03:32] it
[2:03:34] am yes glory and we ought to be able to
[2:03:38] hear this message and go wait a minute
[2:03:41] what he's saying that's me

[2:03:57] hey he believes like I believe yes
[2:04:03] amen amen and it's something that
[2:04:06] realize that's me I look in the word of
[2:04:09] God when I read John I go my
[2:04:13] goodness a woman at the
[2:04:17] well yes
[2:04:20] yes yes sir
[2:04:22] and I believe this all that I said to
[2:04:26] this
[2:04:26] spot was so that we all in this room
[2:04:30] ought to be able to see this book and
[2:04:36] go amen
[2:04:39] glory we ought to see John look at him
[2:04:43] in a different life as not just the
[2:04:45] disciple whom Jesus loved but when we
[2:04:48] read that he laid on the bosom of Jesus
[2:04:51] we ought to go
[2:04:53] hey amen amen when John says the
[2:04:57] disciple whom Jesus loved he got to go
[2:05:01] hey
[2:05:05] yes Glory when Peter's running or when
[2:05:09] Peter's following the uh them behind
[2:05:11] Jesus when he's getting ready to go to
[2:05:13] Calvary and the other disciple we ought
[2:05:16] to go hey that's me
[2:05:23] Hallelujah beautiful we ought to be able
[2:05:25] to realize these things if God put them
[2:05:28] in here only in here that I believe
[2:05:31] they're special for us so that we could
[2:05:34] see the the pattern of God and be able
[2:05:37] to see the continuity of God and go wait
[2:05:40] a minute God's trying to tell us
[2:05:44] something amen and ought to encourage us
[2:05:48] to be able to realize that in this last
[2:05:52] feast in this last
[2:05:55] Feast maybe I just share this we we'll
[2:05:57] stand we'll stand I'm so
[2:05:59] sorry and and and and let me just say
[2:06:02] this I wanna I want to share this with
[2:06:04] you because after this if you look at if
[2:06:08] you look
[2:06:09] at the Feast of
[2:06:12] Tabernacles something else was special
[2:06:14] that happened at the Feast of
[2:06:15] Tabernacles it was also during the time
[2:06:19] of the year of release
[2:06:24] how many knows what the year of release
[2:06:25] is that's when that's when the the the
[2:06:28] high priest would go through the country
[2:06:30] and he'd blow the trumpet and whoever
[2:06:32] was a slave they could throw whatever
[2:06:34] they had down and say I'm free amen amen
[2:06:38] no matter how great a debt it was no
[2:06:41] matter how busted up the marriage was
[2:06:43] Family Life addiction they could throw
[2:06:45] it down and say I'm
[2:06:47] free that was the year of release and so
[2:06:51] when Jes Jesus is expressing this uh uh
[2:06:55] Watch What Happens because immediately
[2:06:57] after this you know what
[2:07:03] happens it's the woman that's caught in
[2:07:06] the act of
[2:07:12] adultery and they go contrary to the
[2:07:14] word only bring her and they throw her
[2:07:18] at his feet this woman was taken in
[2:07:20] adultery
[2:07:22] what the Bible Moses says this how you
[2:07:25] say Jesus just
[2:07:29] wrote he said he that's without sin Let
[2:07:31] You cast the first stone and the Bible
[2:07:33] says then he stoop down the road the
[2:07:35] Bible says when
[2:07:38] they heard
[2:07:40] it when they hold heard that spoken word
[2:07:45] conviction struck their heart yes yes
[2:07:49] and I want to say this when you feel
[2:07:52] conviction listen little ones when you
[2:07:55] feel convi how many knows what
[2:07:56] conviction is when you do something
[2:07:59] wrong and you feel bad yes you know when
[2:08:01] you do something wrong and you feel bad
[2:08:04] that's the greatest feeling in the
[2:08:07] world you want to know why because
[2:08:10] there's millions that don't feel it
[2:08:13] right but when you do wrong and there's
[2:08:16] something in your heart that's oh oh I
[2:08:20] shouldn't have done that yeah yes
[2:08:23] oh that's the greatest feeling in the
[2:08:25] world amen amen because that's the
[2:08:28] goodness of God that's leading you to
[2:08:31] repentance Hallelujah but you know what
[2:08:34] when that conviction struck them they
[2:08:37] left the
[2:08:40] word but there was something different
