your word be spoken plainly i pray this morning to every heart that's here not only here lord god but around the world where your bride is that saints father coming together to get further instruction from your husband from their father forgive us of our sins lord our many trespasses and transgressions hope [Music] and just help us father this morning to be able to hear from you in jesus christ's name hey praise hello hey man thank god for the musicians you guys play play really well hey man you play a lot better than me i can't play praise the lord well it's good to be here i didn't send that link yet because i got to get straightened out on it i got a new phone that was on my old phone and i went to try to look up the actual app and i i couldn't find it so when i get straightened out i'll send it to you hey man okay uh so i don't want to keep you standing long this morning let's see here um we thank god for his word on last night amen amen amen i said what i said because uh you know the lord really does minister to me uh and i can only express what he speaks to my heart hey man that's that's why it's so real you know because he he's dealing with you and and so you it just kind of is able to come forth from that clarity just because of what he's showing you uh let's go to psalms chapter 86. psalms 86 and verse 15. it says but thou o lord ought a god full of compassion amen and gracious long-suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth amen how many appreciate that [Music] yes that's exactly right yeah i know i appreciate it uh let's go also to hebrews uh chapter five actually let's go to hebrews chapter four and we'll start here verse 14. hebrews 4 starting at verse 14 it says seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not and high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need let's bow once more heavenly father lord please help us in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we ask it amen amen god bless you sir although there were you know additional things that came to my heart in regards to the message on last night um when i woke up this morning it's kind of what my little spiritual antennas are like lord which way should i go which way what would you have me to speak on and almost immediately this is something that i spoke on before but this just seems like it was it so um we're not going to deal with the portion that we deal with dealt with on last night this is a different subject but i believe it's very important it's it's something that uh i know that uh well i pray to god help me with more so and again i believe that's the reason why he laid it on my heart initially when i initially administered on it because it was just something he wanted to to bring to my mind so uh as a topic this morning we want to deal with uh effective prayer effective prayer and as a subject compassion amen um you know the bible exhorts us to to pray always and it it you know god always teaches us to to pray for one another uh but it does matter how you pray for someone not so much so what you say but where you are spiritually where your heart is where your mind is toward the individual because many times i mean we all like in this room right now there are many prayer requests majority are unspoken right uh but nonetheless there are prayer requests and there are times in which uh people feel compelled in their hearts to maybe ask a certain person hey you know do you mind praying with me right and when a person does that uh for the person that's being asked it shouldn't be taken lightly because if they if they voiced it that means that it was uh important enough to them you know because many times we keep things to ourselves for me i'm a very private uh person i disclose very little about the very deep things that's in my heart uh unless it's somebody that the lord just allows me to have a confidence and a trust in because i don't say this to uh to any negative slant but you really have to be careful who you share the thoughts of your heart with not that they're bad people or anything like that it's just that their spiritual maturity level is not quite where it needs to be so sometimes things might get mishandled they might not be able to hear you in the right way you see and then if they're a person that's maybe prone to speaking things they might take what you shared with them in confidence and speak it to someone else so you really have to be led who you allow yourself to like i said speak the the depths of what's in your heart too uh it has to be somebody that the lord has shown you you can have confidence in not that you can have confidence in the flesh of a man it's just that where he's he's he's where he's brought them up to they're in a place and a position to where their prayer for you if you ask them to pray it can be an effective prayer because of where their heart is concerning you right so um when you talk about effective prayer the reason why i feel this is so important to god is because um if you pray for somebody in a very surface manner you know somebody will pray for me i'll pray for you you know lord bless so and so yeah yeah i remember okay yeah i prayed and sometimes we'll do it sometimes just to tell the person tonight well did you pray for me yeah i prayed for you because you don't want to say i didn't pray for you but when you pray for it's like you weren't really able to enter into that place see there is a place that you can enter into to where it can be really an effective prayer and it's connected with compassion okay so now let's go if you don't mind let's let's go here to uh luke chapter seven because many times amongst church and and you know amongst the ranks you know of of the church um you know if the lord don't help us we can take on a lot of like religious ways you know and and and and the reality of what we're really a part of in the reality of the life that god is leading us into uh it it is it's uh it's not seen correctly um so so god wants us to be able to uh to really have his mind and his heart that's what it's really all about to really have his mind and his heart toward his people not just the saints in the church but to anybody because how many realize that god the bible says god is even kind unto the wicked right you understand that in his word he told us to love our enemies that's contrary to human nature a naturally born man if you have an enemy amen that means that somebody that has a great dislike for you maybe even a hate for you isn't that right but god threw his prophet in this hour he came to us and he told us that hey you just can't give your life for somebody that you feel is a good person worthy of it right you see when i say give your life i'm not so much so talking about death but he said that eternal life is living your life for others isn't that right and many times people that are that maybe or within our family or somebody that we look upon and say man that's a real good person very sweet very kind very generous i don't mind helping them or doing whatever for them that's not how god thinks he causes his reign to fall upon the just and the unjust amen so to really get to where we need to be it we have to have more of his spirit point blank because he has to be the one he has to be the one living it he has to be the one loving through us when we talk about agape love that's not a love you can just go and learn how to love like it's not a learned behavior it's actually a love that comes from a person and if that person is in your heart and that love is able to be expressed his love from within you goes out you understand what i'm saying so that takes it beyond just religion that can't that takes it much much further beyond just conformance to the message but now the very person of the message the word itself is now residing on the inside of us and and we who we were in our ways and our habits and our makeup it begins to diminish and then now he begins to increase and that's what this is really all about the more we the further we go on our journey with god we are dying more and his presence is increasing more brother branham said god wants to grow up into your mouth he wants to grow up into your eyes meaning he wants to control more of your sight and what you look at he wants to control how you speak he wants to control what you listen to he want to control the whole house is his house you understand and the more that begins to happen like i said you don't have to toot your own horn for nothing as a matter of fact that's the furthest thing from your mind talking about tooting your heart you don't want to you don't even want to be known like that you get to a place where you're just like lord have your way even he being god in the flesh when he would do different miraculous things he'll tell the individual see you tell no man amen he didn't go around proclaiming all the miraculous things he had done that's not his nature so when that same god is on the inside of us you understand when it's him when it's the person that same nature is automatically there you don't have to remember to try to be humble you would just be humble luke chapter 7 starting at verse 36 it says that one of the pharisees desired him that that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat at the pharisees house brought it brought a alabaster box of ointment and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kiss his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the pharisee which had been now watch this carefully watch his watch his mind this was a religious man right dedicated to the things of god to the work of god knew the word of god and in his own opinion new god but he lacked many things yes sir many vital things yes watch his mind now now when the pharisee which had bid him saw it he spake within himself didn't our prophet tell us your thoughts are heard louder in heaven than your words are upon the earth he said within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who in what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner i'm talking about it effective prayer here he is a pharisee you're supposed to be there as a servant to the people you supposed to be there to be able to help the people but how can you help the people when you're so critical [Music] your mind and your heart ain't even in the right place look at how you're viewing this woman [Music] and right now at this moment as you're thinking this simon you're forgetting about your own sins brother [Music] the thing you had to ask god to forgive you for it may not be the same act but brother it's in the same pot pot can't call kettle greasy or whatever he say amen it's the same thing but somehow people get this religious spirit upon them and it causes them to be blind to their own faults and failures but be able to look upon somebody else and magnify he should have been in his feet he was so pious so religious by his own works his own righteousness that was filthy filthy rags in the sight of god somehow he thought he was cleaner he was better and here god is in the flesh the god he said he served sitting right there in front of him and he was blind to who that was yes he thought he was serving god he thought god was on his side he had god's thoughts that same god sitting right there the one and this woman is worshiping he couldn't pray for that woman right he could pray but it would be empty all right because his thoughts toward her wasn't even right watch this saints we're going to go back there but watch this the word compassion it means sympathetic awareness of others distressed together watch this or sympathetic awareness of others distressed together with a desire to alleviate it if he knew what kind of a woman this was that touches him some filth look at her look at her he don't even know he's not if he was a pro he's not a prophet problem he don't even know who this woman is he's allowing her to touch him did he have a desire to help that woman to alleviate her out of her situation you recognize she's a sinner brother what you understand and you recognize that you're speaking it but yet where's your heart concerning her you don't care about her soul you don't have sympathy to water the word sympathy means feeling of pity or sorrow for someone else's misfortune i'm talking about effective prayer this is a place saints that only god can all take us right all right we're hearing it this morning but you can't take yourself to this place i'm talking about we got to labor in prayer and lay before god and allow and then allow god to take us up into his realms the brother asked for the brandon brother branham how you get out there like that he said only god can put a man here amen but it's a place that god is requiring that we come to he he wants us to be like himself we read in the bible the bible says that he's what he says i'm going to read it again you ain't got to turn there it says but thou o lord ought a god full of compassion all of the word compassion up in the bible and there's so many scriptures both old and new testament where it speaks of the compassion of god amen amen he's a compassionate god watch this now compassion again means sympathetic awareness of others distressed together with the desire to alleviate it that's why the bible says that we have not a high priest who cannot be touched but he can be touched in the right way he cares he cares about where we are and what we're going through in our struggles and our trials he cares about our weaknesses and our sins and failures he really cares about that but his care is coupled together with the desire to alleviate it amen that's why the bible says now because we have that kind of a high priest let us go boldly before his throne of grace that we might find help and grace to help in a time of need meaning when we go to him we ain't serving a cold guard that's sitting there ready to judge us and and condemn us and things of that nature that's not how he is but that's the kind of picture satan tries to paint he's just sitting back waiting for you to make every mistake and rather wait waiting to get down on you and to make you feel bad about what you did wrong he wants you to feel the guilt of it but at the same time he wants to help you to be free from it he cares so in hot remember he told israel he said now only if you knew the thoughts i thought towards you you being taken captive this enemy i allowed this enemy to come in a gentile king come in and take you why because you're doing wrong see you not obeying my voice and i'm sending through my prophets amen that was his service isn't that right he did nothing except he revealed his secret through his service to prophets and they came out and proclaimed the word of the lord and here jeremiah was the mouthpiece of god listen god called him a physician he said is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there the great physician was in his earthly physician speaking his medication and what he prescribed to his bride to bring her health up to make a hole again to looser from the grips of the devil the head abound lord let's see he ain't having a white coat see they didn't recognize him to be a physician but he was god's gift to them and they slapped him and wanted to kill him why because of the medication that god was administering see it wasn't it it didn't have a cherry or strawberry flavor it had a brussels sprout kind of taste to it hey man it wasn't it wasn't flavorful to take down but if you take it down it'll do everything you need you need to get done it'll heal you it'll get you right again it'll heal the wounds and the sores it'll make you sound again when it comes to god's word you got to eat the whole thing god ain't got this ministry up here just for no reason just killing time this ain't no ritual almighty god from heaven is here amongst his people ministering to his people the unsearchable riches of god giving us what we need for us to make it out of here and the devil comes by and gets people to treat things commonly it's the enemy it's not the people nobody in their right minds will mishandle god that's why jesus said on the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do and in this same hour for as many people that are crucifying christ afresh denying the only lord god coming in the form of his holy ghost and his revealed word they don't know what they're doing if they knew they would stop they would run from and they would repent but they're blind what you do with a blind man he can't see the pharisees asked jesus are we blind [Music] he said if you were blind and you would be in a better position physically blind but because you say you see you in a bad situation now praise the lord so god looks upon us with compassion he's here to help us yeah don't you appreciate that saints he's not just this god of judgment waiting to judge and no he loves us that's why he exhorted us in his word as husbands and husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church hey man not looking down upon our wives and ridiculing and this and that and the other but no having this sexy you you can't love your wife right unless he's in you that's right that's right that's the bottom line that's why for the sisters that ain't married yet you ate weight praise sincerely and the lord gave you a husband full of the holy ghost but you also pray and ask the lord to fill you with the holy ghost so he ain't got no work on his head it makes a difference when you have somebody that can be pricked by the spirit of god whose heart is tender they make mistakes they might even speak in the wrong spirit about something when the holy ghost get done with them they coming right back to you honey i'm sorry forgive me why god is grooming now making it look it's one thing to enter into the ministry and brother jesse knows this the lord might call you to be a pastor evangelist uh whatever the case might be it's one thing to be called that and enter into the ministry but then god has to actually grow you up he has to season you into the maturity of that ministry so as soon as a man steps out into the ministry he's not he's not he he doesn't he doesn't have the fullness of what he's supposed to there's elements that god is going to add to him along his walk and then once it gets to a right place then that season ministry is able to really be or be a be more of a blessing to the people than what it was when it first started i say that because likewise for a family when a man and a woman get married amen when you get married everything is not everything is not where it's supposed to be in the beginning but god works with both of you to grow you into where you need to be so you can be a more of a blessing to one another and to your children that's just how it works praise the lord let's go back to luke 7. is that where i was luke 7 yeah all right so now this pharisee his heart wasn't in the right place his mind wasn't in the right place concerning his woman so he was able to look at her at the angle that he did which was the angle of the devil i want to make sure that's clear this pharisee's view of that woman was the view that satan wanted him to have how many understand that he was religious seemingly serving god but under the anointing of an evil spirit and we're not exempt from that and god knows that so within our course of life he has things already set that's going to help to is going to help us to die completely to everything that's not like him and cause what is of him that's already inside of that seed to come to life and to begin to manifest itself it's a process yes praise the lord so now in verse four this is in jesus answering because remember he spoke that within himself but jesus heard it clearly as though he said it with his words out of his mouth and you can imagine how simon felt that oh lord you're addressing what i spoke in my heart he may he may or for a moment recognize he was in the presence of something more than what he thought and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors and one owed 500 pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto simon sia style this woman i entered into thine house thou gave us me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with the tear with with tears and wiped them with the hands of her head thou gave this me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same lover and he said unto her thy sins be forgiven and they that said and meet with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgive of sins also and he say unto the woman thy faith have saved thee go in peace his view of the woman is the correct view and this is the mind remember let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus is more than just having power or understanding of the word and things of that nature it's actually a life that we're pursuing it's his person paul said that he didn't count himself to have already attained but he was actually pressing forward that he might apprehend that in which he was apprehended by so god got a hold of him but in paul's heart he didn't think himself to be high anything like that he said look i'm i'm pressing forward i'm trying to get a hold of what's got a hold of me watch this hebrews chapter 5 starting at verse 1. it says for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for me so meaning they're they're taken out from men to be servants to me all right it says in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins but watch how god narrows this down it says who can have compassion notice this now because we're taught when we're talking about having compassion for somebody there's a certain element that god must that must be established in your heart a certain aspect in view of yourself that god must have there in order for you to really be able to have an effective prayer for someone else watch it says who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is confessed with infirmity so the reason why he should be able to have compassion is because he should be able to realize hey i need help myself i love how god operates man he has balanced this thing perfectly that's why with the true ministry of god they don't preach at the people they realize i'm in this with you we all need the grace of god we all need the help of god we all need healing but if he's blind it'll always be preaching at the people you people need to get right you need to do this you need to do that never including himself never confessing where he is in verse 3 it says this and by reason hereof what reason he sees that he's also accomplished about with infirmity and by reason hereof he art asks for the people so also for himself to offer for sins so this is what the priesthood this is the mind they should have those that were called to be servants of god and here this man was claiming to be a servant but yet he was forgetful somehow that religious spirit had a hold on and he didn't even realize that he was being controlled by something different by an enemy of god can we say praise the lord sayings watch this now okay there was a scripture here that i came across this morning i wanted to make sure i shared with you guys because it was such a blessing to me it's bad with me for one moment here well actually i'ma touch on this scripture first galatians chapter six galatians six we're not going to keep you much longer galatians 6 starting at verse 1. now keeping in mind what we just read about the requirement of the high priest as far as god's requirement where god wanted that high priest's mind to be now that's not just for the high priest when you come over into the new testament that same requirement is translated down to the laity amen i'm talking about effective prayer yes sir yes i'm talking about if you're not able to be able to see yourself and realize the help you need of god if somehow you're blinded to that you will never be able to pray for somebody in it and get and get the real results that it could bring if you were in the right heart and mind frame galatians 6 verse 1 says brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual that's more than just this funny spiritual thing you know looking for stuff seeing little lights flashing and all kind of stuff like that it's just god being present in your life you being yielded and god is there he can just move through you you've died to a point to where he can just move through you at will that's how christ was right isn't that right now when he said the works that i do shall ye do also that's included being in the same condition the same state the same relationship having the same fullness of love i do nothing except my father showed me first did not god give us an example of that in this hour that's what the success of the prophet's ministry was all about he was able to die he was able to get out of god's way he now we're not trying to say we want to be like a prophet but at the same time we're within that same caliber we will call me he's our brother what we see god doing in him to a certain degree he's here to do it in us that's his desire watch this if a man be overtaken in a fault which ye which are spiritual restore such a one watch this is god is emphasizing this by the holy ghost in the new testament he says restore such a one in the spirit of meekness how considering thyself yes oh i heard so and so and so and so fell off and seeing they're backsliding or whatever okay okay well okay first of all where is your words coming from are you speaking are you speaking about the situation in the right spirit you understand because this matters it matters to god god is listening god pays attention to these things because he said here if you see a brother's overcoming a fault he said we're supposed to go to that individual in meekness considering yourself not thinking about somebody else allowing somebody else's thought to be magnified in your mind know you look at your own sin right now so that when you go you'll be able to go in the right mind not in a condemning spirit or i'm higher than your spirit but you're right down on their level you're coming to help you're coming to alleviate because you care from the heart you want to see them restored amen amen sayings he says praise god considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so when you go to somebody else in the wrong spirit you know what god will do sometimes god will let you fall flat on your face he'll let some overpower you and take you and while you're in that state bring me your remembrance look at this situation here now you see how you should have went to that person because now you see yourself need help you need somebody to pray for you now you think how do you want somebody to come to you you understand yes man god is perfect in all of his ways praise god hallelujah he says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself was simon deceived when he was sitting there judging that woman in his heart if he knew if he was a prophet he would know what manner of a woman that was he deceived according to the scripture yes he was he was quite deceived amen didn't even realize it though all right that deception is something else eve didn't know she had become deceived she just thought it was the continuing of a thought i don't know but the lord knows but you understand you see it so now let's touch upon these few other scriptures here all right in proverbs chapter 24. we're going to go to verse 17. proverbs 24 and verse 17 it says rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth read that again amen rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not let not thine heart be glad when he's stumbling so notice in this situation that god is bringing out right here you have somebody that has done you wrong and remember you reap what you sow so god has seen that this person has mishandled my son or my daughter so guess what repayment comes from god and now god is allowing a situation to come upon this person but now as you're watching and you're god is saying now when i begin to deal with this person based off of something that they've done wrong and you see me dealing with this person be careful how you allow yourself to think about this situation because if you begin somehow to have some sort of an enjoyment because you see somebody else going through something that you might feel deserves it notice what he says here now amen rejoice not when not an enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbled up lest the lord see it see what see your frame of mind see you rejoicing or somehow getting enjoyment out of seeing somebody else go through hardships regardless of what kind of person it is regardless of what they've done amen praise god he says let the lord see it and it displeases him and he turn away his wrath from him now from there i want to go to zechariah chapter seven because i believe these go in continuity they kind of go parallel one to the other zechariah chapter seven and it says here starting at verse eight of zechariah chapter 7 it says in the word of the lord came unto zechariah saying thus speak of the lord of hosts saying execute true judgment and show mercy and compassion he says to every man of every man to his brother it says and oppress not the widow nor fatherless the stranger the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart this is old testament teaching you see how god expresses himself in the old testament you see the mind he wants us to have toward one another or toward anybody for that fact i love this saints because so often especially in this time here science people are becoming offended all over the place and they're becoming uncareful and very loose with how they speak about their brothers or senses or whatever the case might be and the bible says it displeases god even if you feel like a person deserves that god is saying remember yourself if it wasn't for my grace that could be you god knows what's going on but hey man he's calling he he has a high requirement for his bride see we we have a higher calling hey man we're called to royalty we're called to be just like him he called us brethren amen you understand that this is more than just like i said seeking gifts and power and stuff like that i'm talking about character the character of god that comes from the heart of god in the mind of god that comes inside of the individual at the baptism of the holy ghost and all the baptism of the holy ghost is is god bringing to life was already in you can we say amen to that the life of god was already in you the whole time it was just encapsulated amen the same life that's in the seed is the same life with the holy ghost that's why the prophet said god came the word came to the word that was in you you're the word already you were the word when you were born how many believe that amen this is powerful saints all right so now let me just touch upon a few things here for you notice how brother branham speaks of this this particular message here is called uh god projecting his love right brother branham prayed for many people yes but the level of success that came out of all those prayer lines was wrapped up into what i'm talking about right now it testified of his relationship with god it testified of his new birth amen it testified of his glooming and his molding of the hands of god by the holy ghost amen and it just brought him to a place to where he had become so surrendered and so yielded that god which is able to have great that's why that's the only reason why he was able to say that christ had more success in his ministry than he did in his own he made sure he was careful in saying that it was christ that had more success not him amen because he knew he couldn't do nothing isn't that right but he said christ had more success in his own in in his ministry brother than he did in his own many between the two christ did more but it was christ in both cases had nothing to do with brother branham we understand notice what he says here now god projecting his love the message is from 1957 august the 6th right he says and i thought after all that and then nature now he's talking about this old blind man that was from mexico i believe it was he didn't even know the man but god knew the man so when that man came see brother branham was yielded to the holy ghost now god had full control so now god stops was being expressed and he can feel god's heart so this this just wasn't brother branham in a human compassion like that watch this now that's very important you understand that you understand what i just said it was brother branham under the full leadership of the holy ghost god stalks his heart everything now he was sensitive to that and god was just expressing himself through that prophet amen and i thought after all that and then nature the devil has given him has given him evil to blind his poor old blinded eyes how cruel it was to him and i began to enter into something listen very carefully i began to enter into something i can't express it it was a love of sympathy amen remember now what does sympathy mean for the kids praise the lord sympathy means a feeling of pity or sorrow for someone else's misfortune and again compassion means sympathetic awareness of others distressed together with a desire to alleviate it to make them go free from it right so then brother branham he's speaking about something that listens saints was out of his control this wasn't anything that he could just bring himself into he found himself entering into this place watch and i began to enter into something i can't express it it was a love of sympathy and as the old fellow come and laid his head over on my shoulder and i hugged that old ragged coat i said merciful god help help his poor old blinded that this poor blinded daddy if my dad would have lived he'd have been my about that age will you help him but look at what he entered into first look something pulled him into this place see what i'm saying it ain't something you can do right i'm preaching it but this this lets us know we got to dig deeper we got to pray more we got to die more we got to labor for god so that we can become saturated with his spirit he can just do whatever he wills we don't know what he want to do on any given day on any given occasion or we just want to be in a place and a state he can just flow praise god and i heard him holler with that simple prayer he wasn't that don't get no results like that cause you make a lot of noise and all these sounds and all right this brother was just standing there and because of his love for god and his relationship with god and his care for god's people something just took over amen that's it and i heard him hollering with that effect of prayer he said gloria adios or deals i don't know spanish son it says and the man could see as good as i could the people began screaming everywhere what was it it was entering into that fellowship of his suffering in his blindness he said you must do it if ever i had a time of success of praying for anyone is when i could enter into the fellowship with them feel their infirmities you see the disconnect with simon and and mary he wasn't able to feel for he was in another place a dark place and he didn't realize it if ever i had a time of success of praying for someone is when i could enter into the fellowship with them feel their infirmities feel their conditions amen he says then something in you goes down beyond reasoning and prays the prayer of faith for the sick now he brings in the scripture the prayer of faith shall save the sick isn't that right praying according to your most holy face in the holy ghost you see it that ain't nothing you can just do but it's something that just brings you into that place he says you've got to feel for a man you've got to you've got to sympathize with him you've got to be with him before you can help him amen i'm stopping after i read this because y'all get the point it's been plain he says then you enter into some sort of a deepness it's the love of god it's beyond human love let me read one more it's a little nugget i believe ricky but i believe you understand by the grace of god this message here is demonology brother branham says this is 1953. uh this is june the 9th he says i thought oh god now this is this is me and brother jesse was talking about this briefly the other night he was having services the lord was using him that's why i say we're not exempt then he was able to come out and then go over to this cafe and as soon as he walked into this cafe listen to this very carefully as soon as he walked into this cafe saints he took on the same mind of simon you understand that yes yes he took on the same that means an evil spirit clouded the prophet's mind yes and i thought oh god look at how look at how now his his language is under the anointing of a wrong spirit that's not some other prophet that had the holy ghost we're not exempt i thought oh god god why don't you just wipe the thing off the map who was he talking about he was talking about an elderly woman that was in the life of sin two younger men were by her immorally a cop was at the slot machine and in that instance in that moment their lives meant no more to him than a roach crawling on the ground because he said god why don't you just wipe the thing off the thing wipe the thing off the map why don't you does does my little sharon my little baby my little sarah my little rebecca have to be raised up in that generation to come to face with such stuff as that i thought look out here in these parks and things and what goes on i thought oh god my i'm glad you took sharon if it if it was your will does my little rebecca my little sarah have to be raised up under such stuff like that which which he says which and them people call seeing in the choir and everything it says and i thought isn't that a shame i thought god how can your holy righteousness stand it speaking about people bound look at where his mind was saints how can your holy righteousness stand it look like that your righteous indignation would fly out there and blow this place up simon didn't even talk about the woman like that but notice god listening to his prophet that was still his son that didn't make him any less of a prophet right right just because you get caught up in a wrong spirit sometimes that don't make you any less of a son or daughter of god but because he loved him and he realized that my son has gotten caught up in a wrong spirit let me go down and help him out he says and i heard the angel of the lord say come aside you sitting there thinking like that yeah hold on for a second you don't got beside yourself son you know how it is with parents we got to deal with our children so hold on now why are you talking i can hear my kids in the other in the other room having a conversation and a tone and that just bothers me i gotta say hold on now i want y'all talking to one another like that change your tone i wanna hear some sweetness i wanna hear some love i tell them that all this fustering and digging well no no no no no i don't thank god like that i don't like that he says come aside i walked over there and when i got looked when he got through with me i felt like a different person he says what are you condemning her for i said i said look at that the way she is and here and here's what he he says and then i thought yes that's right and i seen one day because now god began to correct him he says now why are you acting like that why are you condemning her like that and the way god corrected his prophet remember that we read in the old testament where the priest can only be an effective priest to do his role right to please god if he realizes first that he has his own infirmities that he's confidence with encompass with this isn't that right because then he can realize in his mind okay i need help too brother branham he had become blind to that for that moment and so god came to begin to deal with him and the way that he corrected his prophet was by showing him his own sin and then i thought yes that's right and i seen one day i crawled up to him i seen my old book laying there a sinner there laid everything on it i see my sins is what was doing it i said because remember in the vision he saw christ and he saw his head being jawed and he saw blood shooting off amen and while that was happening christ was asking for forgiveness for him so he says why are you condemning her why are you acting like that that's not my mind that's not my heart and i seen one day i crawled up to him and i seen my own my old book laying there at center there laid everything on and i seen my sins as what was doing and i said lord will you forgive me he took his hand in his side and got some blood out rode across it at the top and said pardon throwed it back in the sea of forgetfulness and remember and remembered it no more it was gone forever he said i forgive you but you are condemning her he says that changed my idea i said lord have mercy you see how god changed now how he showed him himself and you know what happened after that saints he went over there and the atmosphere was totally different now he was coming with an atmosphere of love now that woman began to realize she was in the presence of god and she began to pour out her heart concerning her story now he was able to enter into a compassion and have a sympathy and they shook that place in prayer he ended up saying that was a daughter of god you understand you see how important this is to god so god is working with us saints he's bringing every one of us into this place because he wants us to be just like him it's within us that's our father so it's within us all ready to grow up to be just like him not just in the demonstration of power and miracles but in a demonstration of his life and his character we talk about adoption this is what everything is wrapped up in this is why it doesn't matter if you're a minister or a housewife it's you being in your position in christ the way he can just have his way that his person can be freely expressed that's that's that's the whole thing that's the seals and everything in simplicity it's the thunder that shakes the devil what is that it's christ walking in flesh i thank god for your patience and for your time this morning i believe it was the will of god for me to share this particular thought i pray god help each one of us because i'm preaching it but i need help hey man i want to be able to see people right at all times i i don't want my own way i don't want my own mind i really don't regardless of how people treat me and handle me lord help me in my heart to satisfy your desire and your will regardless that's real growth that's what it's all about and he's doing it he's doing it so god bless each one of you don't be discouraged in any kind of a way amen because he has sympathy amen he's here to deal with his uh deal with us in our issues but free us from it as well amen can we say praise the lord god bless you saints amen let us all stand together amen let's let's just bow and while we're bowing if by chance is anybody that desires prayer and of course you're welcome to come but as we said on last night whether you come up here or not your faith is what does it say that so you can touch god from anywhere amen heavenly father we thank you again for your word and your presence i don't say that loosely father god but by your grace lord i you help me to recognize your help in my life within your ministry father in the way that you spoke this morning father i say that because i really believe

baptism of the holy ghost and we realize that it's not just one baptism as we've been taught but it's baptism after baptism you beginning to quicken more and more of your word in our lives so god help
