========================================

but it is very important it says and he went up went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying the king of Moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle and he said I will go up I am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of Edom so the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host for the cattle that followed them so notice seven days and what they were just getting weaker all the time because there was no water all right seven days and the king of Israel said alas that the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab but Jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him and one of the king of Israel servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shaphat which poured water on the hands of Elijah one more passage revelations 1:10 all right revelations 110 it says here I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet this bow our heads forward prayer a precious Lord Jesus how he once again come as humbly as we can before you Lord and thou knowest O God that hearing the songs that are being sung I felt that this would be the way to go Lord because if there really is that type of a cry from the people of God there's a word to match that Lord we're asking tonight that Lord as we allow you to go forth that you would just give us all strength O God may we press into the word tonight and Lord may we Oh God and hear a revelation or here's something tonight that will stimulate our walk further O God that we might Oh God see a great movement of your life in us O God that we might be able to be used to bring revival to other souls Oh God we have to have virtue before we can give virtue of God and Lord your prophet liken that to the woman with the blood issue touching Jesus he said had that virtue so Lord with that being spoke we're just asking that you just be in our midst surely O God come speak to us in order to be yield to you now knowing that if we're not in the Spirit of God what good is any of it anyway so we just pray O God even now in the name of Jesus Christ that you'd have your way as we say Amen may be seated amen we're gonna minister tonight like I said just an inspirational message getting in the spirit here and we know our prophet worked with this extensively but I'll be honest with you I keep coming back to this myself and and I really believe that this is one of the key figures that will help us out amen but I want to start by going into this because as we seen in Revelations 110 there John was and the scripture says that he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day all right and notice in order for him to be part of that day and to be part of that revelation he had to be in the spirit amen remember if God could have gave you any better weapon he couldn't have done it because he already gave his best weapon and that was the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost the word himself coming and welling in you right in the scripture he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you not oh my it was so important to Jesus Christ that he said it's expedient that I go unto the Father because then the promise of the father could come upon you in it brother sister we're at a place right now where we really need a move of God in them we need the Holy Ghost to live in our lives like never before in them we need to what be so delivered from our own force that only the thought of God abides with us in in now notice here what is to be in the spirit known as Galatians 5:24 Galatians 5:24 says here Galatians 5:24 it says and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts so if you have truly been crucified with Christ then the flesh and the affections and lusts have all been crucified Amen hallelujah so the things that you used to lust for they're no longer a lust to you right the affections that you used to have for the carnal things and temporal things they've moved on in and why because you have taken up your cross and now you're following Christ amen so in the 25th verse it goes on to say if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit all right so if you are going to live in the spirit all right so notice you're alive right now in it and the scripture calls us that if we're truly living in the spirit then one we're living in him right and yet the scripture does not tell us so notice it adds to it if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit amen so every movement that we bring forth on this earth should be in the spirit amen that means the Holy Ghost guides you directs you and then lives inside of you hallelujah amen now let's get to the powerhouse quote here Patmos vision church age book part chapter 2 here 40 3-6 I want you to see what your prophet says because this will tell you a lot about yourself and where we need to be he says I was in the spirit isn't that just beautiful mind I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian life oh man it's good time for a little refreshing in the house of God and then so what is the whole of the Christian experience is it how much you can memorize is it how much you can quote the Prophet no but what is the whole of the Christian life is how much you can be in the spirit amen right now we're in the process because brother sister you'll see this but we could go this whole direction but your prophet said before you have a revival you got to get in the spirit of revival amen and if you are the spirit of revival you'll pray it up like you're in a revival even you long for God in your life amen and notice this because the thing about a revival that they always talk about is when you're in a revival you never feel like you have enough God but it says in the histories and everything as you look at them they said all these people didn't they didn't even think they had God they just were so hungry for God to be in their lives when they got in the spirit of revival they thought they didn't have any remember church age book talked about that right so notice the whole of the Christian life is in the spirit if we are going to live as Christians we have to be in his spirit John was not talking about being in his own spirit that would have not brought these visions it had to be the Spirit of God it has to be the Spirit of God with us - or all our efforts are in vain amen Paul said I will pray in the spirit and i will sing in the spirit i will live in the spirit oh my if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results it brings amen as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to be confirmed by the word so if you are going to be confirmed by the word you have to be in the spirit it just can't be in a place and this is what what troubles Laodicea so much is because we're in such an age now where people don't know if they have the Holy Ghost one day they think they'll have it the next day they don't think they have it and they'll go back and forth right but your prophet said he said you have to have patience with God he said but God has to have patience in you because he gave you the word and you have your ups and your downs when we should be at a perfect consistency bleeding this word that's why this message was sent that's why this revelation come amen the opening of the seals the revealing of this word it brought us to a place that we can recognize the enemy in every attack amen and what we can discern the two spirits and we can withstand the enemy any minute drive them away hey amen so notice she says as surely as John needed to be in the spirit to be confirmed by the word and made manifest by the results of theirs as surely as Johnny and being the spirits received these tremendous revelations from Jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that God has given to us to live by in his word for it is the same spirit amen so notice in order for us to even have revelation we have to be in the spirit uh-oh mine so Galatians 5:16 I want you to see this because this is important I could I could definitely write a tangent for the rest of service on this Galatians 5:16 it says here this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that you would but if he be led of the Spirit ye are not under the law in them so notice if you're in the spirit you're not even on the law anymore but why is that because the law himself is inside of you you viewed it to the source of righteousness amen you come in line with a God who can keep you line up amen you see who's gonna get you to serve him the best God Himself amen hallelujah that's why he sent the Holy Ghost amen because if you don't have the Holy Ghost you are going through a legalistic hole and it will make you miserable amen that's why most Christians they get so miserable especially within this message because they gotta wear a skirt or they got to do this and they got to do that you don't have to do anything you just got to get the Holy Ghost amen because the Holy Ghost you get he'll make you satisfied with the work you receive that word and that word brings your satisfaction ohuh so Romans 8:5 says Romans 8:5 it says here for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit ah you just think about the things of the Lord for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so if you are living in the spirit what type of a mind should be in you confusion frustration when you're truly living in the spirit the Bible says you'll have life and peace so the people you just seen at the restaurant wherever you are they don't have life because they don't have this word and your thought is what they need I they need these but if you don't if you're not living in the spirit then you don't have anything to offer them you look the same way they do right we're trying to sell a gospel that's supposed to make us the happiest people in the world does that make sense people will crave the God that satisfies you and if you don't have a God that satisfies you they'll see that but if you do have a God that satisfies you they'll see your life and your peace and they'll follow it amen all right notice again Patmos vision 44 2x1 Church age book it says look at it this way all too many read the Bible where it says in acts 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and they just right on they don't see it they don't see the baptism I just preach it at the last few funerals I did they don't see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the Holy Spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God would be duty-bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost they never get in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says so if you follow acts 2:38 there's no reason for you not to have Holy Ghost there's no reason for you not to have life in peace it's the reason why God should not give you with a supernatural from ABAB amen so notice he says pray to God for a revelation by his Spirit this is the first step get in the spirit the whole of your experience is going to be how successful you'll ever be is how much you can live in the spirit you've got to get in the spirit you know that word get getting in the spirit that sounds like a push doesn't it you got a press to get in the spirit amen amen those Patmos vision again I'm arena I read a lot of quotes here about hope that's all right Patmos vision he says all right now he was in the spirit the Lord's Day now remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit how these revelations going to ever come to you get in the spirit how are you ever going to get the Holy Ghost get in the spirit get in the spirit you got to get in the spirit to get to all the when you was a sinner and you went to a dance you got in that spirit now look at how he ties us in and this is where this is where you know we get our little scarecrows of Pentecostalism and so forth he says oh my you started clapping your hands and patting your feet and chin digging it and throwing your hat on the floor and going around and around acting silly you was in the spirit of it could you imagine a fellow was a dance theme going to a dance and say well and you all have a pretty good time I suppose when someone loves something if they love to dance they're gonna dance right most of us come out of oil I know I wasn't the only one on the dance floor but why does that leave our experience when we come to the word go there again hallelujah I'll get quiet if you want that's alright because you should do it in the spirit see but if you're interested about bringing forth the Spirit of God in your life you have to art you have to learn how to get in the spirit so notice how he brings this forth because he begins to tie getting in the spirit with someone who wants to dance you gotta want to receive the Holy Ghost you got to want to participate in that dancer so you see what it is that individual that goes to the worldly dance if they were just going to go to that dance where it's a dance and they go to that dance and they just go and sit on the sidelines they really didn't go to get in the spirit of that but if they go and they were one the first time that they hear the music come forth and they get out there they know their purpose why they're there and they know what pleases them and what they're looking for a satisfaction to come by amen and that's the way it is with us amen it's not a trial to come to the house of God the Bible states if you have the true revelation they do we need to get in the spirit of this revelation but better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere you have to be in the spirit of that word amen you have to believe that amen but don't you know you'll show if you do believe that because when you go to church you're not just there I had a person say one time he said I'm just a few warmer I said well that's not what I would want to be but that's what he considered himself just a Pew warmer I want to be a Pew warmer I don't come to the house of God - did you sit there and just sit in a stagnant experience right when we come to the house of God what are we trying to manifest here a revelation of the word true worship to the spirit all the promises of God divine healing the nine gifts of the Spirit everything the Bible says that yours it's yours Christ died for that day men he died to give you those gifts amen so how could we just let him sit well we have to get in the spirit what if I said this what you know how many how many come to church tonight and said you know what all things are possible tonight God I want to be available for whatever you want God I want to be available if you want to prophesy through me I want to be available if you want me to pray for someone and they to deal I want to be available but what are you doing you're getting in the spirit of the service you're bringing the expectation of what this really is all about all right wonderful so the first step when you come to church when you're looking for something from God you got to get in the spirit again he says in Patmos vision he says no no we're skip that so I want to take this turn if we can I'm going to take this turn because this is where it becomes such an interesting thing because we say well what do we do do we have to provoke her or get a emotion on the scene what do we have to do to get in the spirit your prophet made it sound like that they do shindig in there why not some shindig and over there and that's where Pentecostals went off right but I want you to see this here seven church Ages 54 says no matter how saintly you are how godly you are how much of a minister or lay member or whatever you are you'll never be able to get anywhere with God till you get in the spirit that's right I don't mean get in emotion now look at this I mean get in the spirit see me you get in a motion you do anything but when you get in the spirit you see things so it's so easy to sit and say well looks like we don't need any emotion here take that smile off your face brother it's a little bit too much for the house of God tonight we already had one services they hey come on now how are you doing that so though people actually read that and they'll say you see getting in the spirit has nothing to do with emotion let's keep reading let's keep checking that Moe's vision again he says let's use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have all read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it so notice when you read the Bible you have to get in the spirit of that word you read the vine healing it says I am the lord that heals all our diseases it's not just a scripture but that's the promise of God that's anointed by the Holy Ghost and because his word chose you you can believe that and he'll bring it forth in your life he then knows what he says so what does the word say well we have all read it countless times but then we get in disparity reading did we ask God for His Spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the elders confess our sins he anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it's all over there is no other Court of Appeal God will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done look what he says don't go through the acts first this is it right here get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what God will do so now you see what your prophets say is it emotion is emotion wrong emotion is wrong when it's the first thing you don't do the acts first you get in the spirit first you get in the spirit of the promised earth and then you just let God be God amen amen so we go to Psalms 4 verse 4 Psalms 44 it says stand in all and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still Salah offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the Lord there be many that say who will shew us any good Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon us thou has put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn in their wine increased I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou Lord only make us me to dwell in safety amen there be many that say that what who will shew us any good they men but David he could say that what God will bring it to us amen and what by experience he could say God you brought gladness to my heart notice how much of a gladness was it says more than in the time that the corn and the wine increased so more than the very substance that they lived off of was the moving of the Spirit in his life to bring satisfaction to his soul oh my oh you getting in the spirit is it more than your daily bread oh my and what as we line our expectation up with it it begins to perform because that's what he said he said if you get in the spirit then things get done so wait let me ask you a question so if it seems like nothing's ever going on in the church what's going on are we getting in the spirit remember what your prophet said he said in 64 question-and-answers he said if you were in unity he said the signs and wonders would be multiplying among you all the time right now oh my do you realize that your prophet said he said every revival started with divine healing so you know what a sign is that God's trying to send a revival when everybody's sick and there's sick people all around you what God is trying to show you is that he is trying to bring revival amen he places a condition of sickness in your minutes because he wants you to be alive in the Spirit of God so that the enemy of sickness can be destroyed amen well you promise it every single revival start the same way divine healing it had to God had to get the people looking to a place that they needed help and they had to what they had to see their need and say god I guess I better die to myself there's got to be more to this all right Patmos vision sixty he says maybe he was dancing jumping running all around the ion talking about John he was having a good time he was in the spirit so you see what your prophet said said maybe he was dancing and jumping and running all around the island because he was in the spirit he said that mites may sound sacrilegious but I don't mean it that way see he thought that's he's been he might might have been doing that I believe he was having a good time in the spirit just pray using God because that's exactly what happened when the spirit fell on them in the first place when the Holy Ghost fell on them they staggered like drunk men and women and acted like they were drunk and jabbering and carrying on like that till the people said these people are fooled new one that's the way they acted the first time so the spirit come on again he probably acted the same way there's nothing new about this thing this is an old-time religion so you see what you need to expect you need to expect staggering around drunk in the spirit you need to expect the wind of the Holy Ghost blowing through we had to happen I was praying for someone up front about three months ago at our church and I was praying for him and I felt this wind blow on me and I was in the building so I looked over looked over like because I figured maybe somebody's walking by me there's nobody there but our sister got a victory I [Music] don't know I asked the sister I said did you feel that she said I thought that Oh hallelujah but we have to expect the word to be made manifest in our midst not a different word but the old-time Holy Spirit amen you see you're being returned to the mystery of 33 82 53 ad you're coming back to that mystery when the Holy Ghost fell on them and your prophet said they packed the orders of God out he said in the same quote he said they had those seven virtues on them do you realize that the statue of a perfect man when God poured the Holy Ghost on them that 20 years they were given the holy ghost with the statue of a perfect man on them this is my other message I was going to get to how to say it for what it is now so what is it now remember that 20 years and then they entered into the Ephesians church age and what happened relent relaxed and aimed at and what the church beginning to go and die out and die out and die out but every one of those ages God was actually doing a lot he was manifesting those virtues in each one of those ages now think about this because that's what we've come to now your prophet said in the church age he said they didn't have to live those out like we do now why was that because the Prophet preached the pyramid message this is your learner's going to preach is what the Prophet preached the pyramid message remember junior Jackson he's seen the Prophet take a crowbar and break off the top of that pyramid and what they see they seen the revelation inside and what is it then your prophet talks about it in stature and perfect man he said now and you said you have to have these and once you have them then you're a living moving Idol so why are we seeing what it is now see Pentecost 1906 it didn't bring it didn't bring the character it brought the manifestation of the Spirit which it was peaking then and then God used that to bring in the Elijah messenger but the Elijah messenger would manifest the water but his purpose was what his purpose was not just a do for divine healing and miracles his purpose was to break the mystery of this hour so what'd it do it showed that that it showed that the church ages and what everything did but notice what it did he said that's my pyramid message so it came right back down to it where in order to manifest this adoption that were called unto it's going to take faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness in order to manifest the fullness of Jesus Christ God is calling you to manifest the character of Christ because what what is that remember what was the purpose of that pyramid without the capstone it was to express the seven virtues within it but the capstone was the top that would settle down on the whole thing and your prophet said his flange so it would sit right on it and it repelled the wine but your prophet talked about that because in order to receive I hear he him in this hour you have to reflect those seven virtues and then what does that bring forth that brings forth all the Spirit of Christ in you Oh hallelujah glory to God see again Patmos vision he said see a roads built away a good road is built the highest parts in the center because it lets all the trash wash off both sides that's it when a man he comes to Christ he's got his eyes centered on Christ if he's a little bit emotional he'll be a fanatic if he's a little bit cold he'll get on this other side and be just a cucumber over on that side see his intellectual so we don't want to be a fanatic or cucumber but notice but the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving amen and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit and move just as the spirit moves not to or not after just as the spirit moves so what do we call to do we're called to walk what never cold that's fanatical but we're called to walk right in the middle we're warmed up by the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost right you can love right you can live right you can show people that something's changed amen glory to God amen second Kings 312 second Kings 312 second Kings 3:12 it says here and Jehoshaphat said the word of the Lord is with him so the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him and Elisha said under the king of Israel what am I to do with thee get me to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of Israel said unto him nay for the Lord hath called these strings three Kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab and Elisha said as the Lord of Hosts liveth before whom I stand surely were not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah I would not look toward thee nor season but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel play that the hand of the Lord came upon him and he said thus saith the Lord make this valley full of ditches so remember they went on a seven-day journey and on that seventh day it was so dry that they thought that God had delivered them into the hand of Moab into the hands of the enemy oh my it says in the 17 verse for thus saith the Lord you shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and this is what a light thing in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand it a team ahead hey man isn't that something God God by that prophet he wouldn't even talk to him if it wasn't for somebody godly standing in the mist oh ma I wonder if we got some godly people in the midst hearing that now look at all's it took Elijah knew coz notice he was obviously a little riled up here he needed to get in the spirit to prophesy so what do you do he said you got to bring him in stroll bring somebody who can play over here and then then we'll see the Spirit of God move so notice getting in the spirit he said II 35 this old prophet really got his righteous indignation stirred up and he bawled them out and he told them about all these alliances and organizations that they were having he said nevertheless he said bring me a minstrel oh he had to get his temper down a little you know he got all hit up and so he said bring me a minstrel he said now what about some of you Church of Christ people so-called that don't believe in music in the church after he got all head up he needed a little music to bring the spirit on that's right yes sir now remember God doesn't change and if the good music brought the spirit on the Prophet then it'll do the same thing today that's exactly right because God loves it sure he said bring me a minstrel well you say well yeah I ain't a prophet but maybe you can be part of the minstrel you know you can do something shorted that's all you got a testimony or something you can do you don't have to be the seventh angel you don't have to be you don't have to have the discernment of false intents of the heart Hebrews 4:12 you have a that rolled out but discernment is one of those nine gifts but what we have find our gifts in the body because how will they work if it's a gift of the Holy Ghost it'll have to work by the Holy Ghost being in the service so without look at how your prophet says this he says if you do get in the spirit you said you might just be a minstrel you might be the minstrel to bring it for he said you might just have the testimony that comes from he says he says or there's something you can do who's gonna line it up who's gonna set it in motion the Lord will but he must be welcome in this place and we have to realize that we're here to do something we're here to manifest Christ your whole goal as the body should be how can I make the Spirit of God more welcome here you know what phenomenal about the about the Azusa Street revival is they said that the vast majority of miracles that happen in Azusa Street were not done by the hands of William Seymour but they said that when the music began to play a bunch of young people would get in the spirit and they would just go and pray for people so while the worship was going on they would just go pray for people that people get healed bring me a minstrel [Laughter] hey man hey man he says again fabulous vision 40 4-3 he says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ballgames their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wallflowers old dried-up sticks they enter right into the field of things and will and because a part of things but oh how they hate the Christians for getting in the Spirit of God they call us fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship hallelujah he says it again let's get to this right here we're gonna close getting in the spirit he says he says that's the way you get a revival it's when you really get in the spirit of revival not looping it up or something but by praying it down until there's a revival that strikes in your heart until all the laws of Ecclesiastes ISM all the logs of fanaticism all the logs of system all the logs of unbelief flow out then the waters of God comes falling down upon you there you are amen so now notice what it is if we want to revival here how are we going to do it we got to pray it down until God strikes something in our hearts to say God I need more of you amen I got to pray more and not just pray more but what when the temptations come by your phone to take your time by the computer computer or whatever it is you have a hold in your life that pulls you to Christ more than that [Music] you have to pray till you get that because these cell phones they are primo in our lives they've made it now so you can't live without it you got to fill job applications out with them you can buy stuff cheaper with them Google's got a lot of answers but they can't get you to the answer about how to manifest Christ amen yep he says again he says just keep praying keep digging yeah don't stop just like when Elijah told them dig ditches out there when you get down you hit an old tin can say I'm too tired throw it out of the way and keep digging remember the more ditches and the deeper they were the more water they were going to be filled with he said just keep digging cuz we've got to dig we've just got to dig that's all cuz if you expect to miss the Tribulation you better start digging you notice how he ties that in with getting in the spirit being in the spirit is what it is something you must have for a rapture because that's what caught John Oh what's going to catch you up in the clouds and notice what he said if you're going to miss this tribulation you better dig out all the junk out of your life start digging it out this is never more applicable than right now your pastor priority told you but he showed me earlier about how all the Christian churches under Trump they're all coming together never unified like this before you got 12,000 is probably more now because there's thousands of earthquakes in California tremors every week it's getting ready to go in the sodomite condition is the such a place now that they're forced and operating your children there's no recovery now it's over so the question is how much more long suffering will God be before California slides in the ocean and let's get things moving Oh hallelujah oh we're just as long sufferings God we don't want anybody to die we can go to hell we don't want anybody but we are what we are concerned about fulfilling God's Word remember that stuff can't happen until you come to position that's the thing about God's masterpiece it brings all these things to place at the same time just like in the crucifixion and the resurrection it brought prophecy after prophecy everything lined up right there it does the same thing now so what you gonna do better start digging so he talked about it again he says perfect strike by perfect weakness he says now if somebody can become one of his people God can use them if they're ready to forget that they are as somebody if you're ready to forget that you're somebody and become a nobody then God can use you and make you somebody out of you but you got to forget that you're so important are you important just forget about it there's many of us many of us do that in our lives as soon some people as soon as they become Christians they become arrogant indifferent when they they're just taking a vice-versa path they're going back instead of forward he said more of you you can get out of yourself the more room you've got for the Holy Spirit to come in like Elijah told Jehoshaphat them dig this place full of ditches deeper you did the more room you're going to have for water the more of our own selves their own rubbish of our own abilities that we can throw out of us the more room they'll be to be filled by the Spirit of God long as we can do that the more your prophet said in that message he said we have to master human ability if you don't master human ability then you won't see it well why because if you master human ability you master that you're nothing and then you get in the spirit see you forget about who you are we're closed right here why Phoenix 61 he says now you people that wanted to renew the joy of your salvation somewhere you've lost your joy think back to what you did did you neglect prayer meeting did you neglect reading the Bible did you neglect praying at your home asking the blessing at the table don't never do that Omaha that's all I'm becoming to Christians no matter where you are bow your head and pray don't be ashamed of him pray anywhere see and if ever where you left that joy that wherever whatever we did it out what little root of bitterness come in he said remember when a man is saying this much like this button here because it's her Oh life in your heart that's God as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then God begins to spread in you then you become a son of God and man was made to be a God you know he's in the image of God he's a son of God he's like him he was giving her domain dominion over the whole earth that's right he ruled the earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all the other kingdoms all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made the image of God made light God had hands and feet like God he was the image of God what happened because he disbelieved God's Word it sent him right back out to shift for himself now God's trying to bring him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out and all of the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the Spirit then you begin to become a son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom in within you he said now if you even if you've grieved the Holy Spirit somewhere then go right back and think in your mind what did I start doing neglecting church did I start fussing with another denomination that's something you can start busting with another message church you'll lose your joy that was brotherly kindness did I start picking on this one doing this to my neighbor if you did that's what snapped it out go say God I'm sorry I will go right back and make this thing right I will go right and do it then the joy will come back to your salvation together hallelujah remember your prophet talked about the Holy Spirit he said it's kind of like an automobile and said he said there's a lot that goes to a car he said there's he said their Springs and carburetors and all this stuff like that he said there's so much that goes with it and that's the way it is with the Holy Ghost but the first thing that your prophet said is praying for that revelation get in the spirit get in the spirit maybe if you've already had the Holy Ghost where did you lose it at your prophet said he just went up on a raft earlier could you imagine an entire church moving with this revelation walking forth in the Spirit of God not afraid to dance not afraid to scream and shout not afraid to worship God not afraid to say God there's gifts in my life bring them out Lord I believe I'm here for a purpose and then watch the Holy Ghost begin to pour more water in those ditches let's stand it's been a seven day journey and then ended up really dry but now the commandment is dig those ditches out you're going to miss the tribulation dig it out get in the Spirit of God in the spirit of revival get in the spirit of prayer if you don't have that joy in your life find out where you left it say God I want you fresh then let's say a word of Prayer our precious Lord Jesus Christ how we love you we appreciate you Lord and God is I just thank you Lord for
