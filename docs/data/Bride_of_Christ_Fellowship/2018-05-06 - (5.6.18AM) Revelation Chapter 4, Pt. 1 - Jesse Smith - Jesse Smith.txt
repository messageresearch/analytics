to see us there Lord bless you so let's go to Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 I was been studying lately brother Rams messages on Revelation chapter 4 and 5 and so I'd like to begin preaching on them by the grace of the Lord so let's go to Revelation chapter 4 we'll just read verses 1 and 2 I imagine that's I'm just gonna preach basically what he preached back in 1960 it was December 31st when he preached this message and I'll just inject some more of his thoughts from this chapter how many love the book of revelation it gives you victory over Satan right it gives us revelation over the wicked one so we're very very grateful for that by the grace of the Lord unmasks him unveils him and shows what the true church will do and overcome Satan and every one of his tricks so we're so grateful for that by God's grace in Revelation chapter 4 verses 1 and 2 actually you know what let's go to verse yeah verses 1 & 2 yeah I'll read verse 1 and that's all read verse 2 verse 1 after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and I'm sorry sat on the throne forgive me I'm in such a hurry let's go back and read that together forgive me let's read verse 2 1 2 3 and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne amen let's bow our heads for one more word of Prayer they have a need on your heart just make a known to God Heavenly Father forgive your nervous servant Lord forgive me Lord I'm skipping scriptures and almost running people over forgive me Lord I I just get nervous at times so Lord forgive me Lord just help me to settle down Lord we're grateful for your mercy and love or just minister by your spirit today Lord you promised you'd be with two or three we have more than that today Lord and we're we're grateful for every soul or no this is an appointed hour Lord we know you keep all your appointments Lord and Lord just we ask that you'd feed us by your spirit Lord God Lord direct every heart guide us Lord we know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord so guide me your servant guide all your servants here in the in the sanctuary Lord God and bless those who couldn't make it Lord again be with the travelers Lord God and we love you Jesus will always love you and serve you you alone for you are God alone and when we give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless usually being seated praise God so we like to continue this series on the book of Revelation you know it's really been kind of like a three-year series I've been working on I this weekend I took a few moments and I went back and looked at all the sermons you know we preached on it so this is chapter 4 part 1 but it's actually part 71 in the whole series and that's not even counting the the series we preached on the seven seals back in 2009 and 2010 so it just it gives me a lot of strength to know that God has sent a messenger to us and he's told us so much about the revelations of the book of Revelation that we can preach weeks months and years on the book of Revelation so it's quite an inspiration to know that God has revealed so much to us we have nothing to be scared of when it comes to the book of Revelation so we're very grateful so this whole series like I said I went back and counted this series so I did two sermons on introducing the church ages and I did two sermons on just all the quotes with brother baron the power of the book of Revelation and then we did seven sermons on Revelation chapter 1 including the Sevenfold glory of Christ person on the Lord's Day and then we just finished up 59 sermons on Revelation chapters 2 and 3 in the church ages that brings us to a total of 70 and that's not including the the - the seven seals sermons we preached years ago but like I said that just it's comforting to me to know that God is directing us to his word and we really want to know about the book of Revelation the Bible said he that keeps what's written in the Book of Revelation will be blessed I don't want to be cursed by the Lord I want to be blessed so we're grateful to keep the Word of God that he has revealed to us through the book of Revelation through His Prophet so let's look today like I said I'm drawing my inspiration from the watch night service in 1960 as if you listen to it you know brother Branham was just the first preacher amongst many preachers he named different preachers that gave their testimonies that night and they preached all the way through midnight we just got done doing that North Carolina I think we had what three preachers at night I was the first one and then two other preachers after me and had a good time of the watch night service that was a real blessing and so we're grateful now I want to just you know I was listening to bleep part two if I'm not mistaken of this series and brother Branham tells us his desire brother Branham said he had to always had a longing desire to teach on the book of Revelation and he said if he could draw pictures and charts of the book of Revelation he said it would be a little taste of heaven so let me read it to you he says how you all enjoy I said how you all enjoy the revelation he said he said I believe a whole lot like my little girl Sara back there it's become revolutions to me it's just revolutions going over and over you know I wish we just had now about until March or April just to put a great big canvas across the back of the church here and just come down the daytime and draw out those pictures and the whole chart so he wanted to make charts of all the church ages and the book of Revelation and just raise them up and down like window shades you know like I've always dreamed sometimes I'm having a great big Tabernacle record just reach down and pull this chart down come all the way across the platform this was a dream of brother Brandon still be able to pull charts down you remember in school I still got one of those old social studies maps remember you had to pull it down I still got one in my class today the children all want to do it but I tell them if you do that you're gonna wind yourself up and you're gonna get wrapped around there because it pulls so hard so I don't let the children do that I just I'm the only one that pulls it down and so brother branham wanted to in the 60s here you want to be able to pull down a chart and just teach the Word of God and he said I have always dreamed of being able to do that now I'm just skipping ahead a little bit he said I've always dreamed about that he said and come all the way across the platform and the revelations and the interpretations the Lord has given to me and take a pointer and start down through there and bring these ages down then when we get through that raise that one up pull another one down like this and start on that and teach it through oh that would be just like a little heaven wouldn't it I only can say amen to that all right just bless my soul I heard this week just sit the complete winner through just sit it out with the Lord and Church what is God giving us God's giving us chart after chart after chart after chart if we're not careful it becomes common to us but if we have the understanding that God has revealed his revelations to us then it ought to be like a little heaven to us amen we know there's two resurrections this is a chart I made there's another chart I made on the Daniel's seventy weeks you have your three groups and then the last group is divided into two parts for three and a half all these charts are inspired not from man's ideas or seminaries or buts but from thus saith the Lord and not only that but he's revealed to us you know the four anointings over the church ages and the messengers and the years and he's revealed all these anointings and where they overlap God has revealed how Satan would get in the church through deeds and synagogues and doctrines and jezebel religion which is the very depth of Satan and now each age all the way up till we are to the lukewarm spirit that were battling and brother Brandis wish I wish I could just pull this one down and go to the x1and and look we can just do it with a simple finger honey how to pull anything down I just gotta go tap he was always dreamed in other words he dreamed about this that we could do this today remember this one the 6000 years brother Ram said you know we've had six thousand years there was after two thousand years was the flood and then two more thousand years and then Calvary and then two more thousand years and that's where we're at now now fire is going to come we know that and then we know this seventh day the millennium will be the seventh day that Christ that God never had with his children because it got interrupted and we know then the new heavens and new earth is the eighth day that's the New Jerusalem and that's the beginning of the cycle all over again by the grace of the Lord so see these are all charts that if we're not careful they just become common to us and we say oh that we need more and no doubt we need more revelation but we actually need more respect for what God has revealed to us it's just like your marriage if you're not careful it's going to become common and the very one you prayed for and cried for will just become common to you if you don't keep these things nice and sweet in our hearts is that right Church and then brother Branham said these things that he preached he knew he could only hit the highlights so he said the things he preached should be broken down and taught to the people that's what he said as he began the seven seal series he said now study that studied all and you people visiting here when you go to your motel rooms take those things and ponder over them see we're supposed to take time and ponder over what brother Branham preached he says when we don't but we don't have the time to break it down as it should be broke down but I want you to do it when you get to the motel or hotel or wherever you're staying or the home gather together and study over it aren't you glad you can live in a time where we can break down these revelations and you can see God's truth all the way from verse 1 all the way to the end of each chapter oh it's so glorious brother Ram could just hit the highlights many times but we get to take our time and as it was pulled down charts and rejoice and know what God's doing know that we're in the perfect will of God amen what a blessing I don't want to take that lightly I don't want to take God's Word for granted I don't want God's Word to become common to me with a hard heart I want to keep these things before my heart I want to keep humble I want to keep little on the sight of God I want to be humble and God's sight will never get anything from God if we exalt ourselves we've got to humble ourselves and he'll lift us up a new season amen so let's just begin this like I said I'll try to preach about an hour by the grace of Lord because I have to save my strength for tonight I'll probably be preaching part two tonight the same series that the Prophet preached and I know you'll be blessed by the grace of God so chapter four verse one after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter praise the Lord so the first thought the Prophet brings out as this thought on after this in verse one so I think there's nine or eight thoughts in here I listen to the whole sermon over and over and kept writing down you know what what the Prophet emphasized and so the first thought was this thought on after this and the Prophet said see what's happening in Chapter four are things that would happen after the seven church ages he says he says John of course was a type of the bride and John left the the seven church ages and he said it's a type of the church leaving here he says and then the church never appears again until revelation 19:7 right and so we understand that now we know as we preach this a few years ago we know the bride shows up between there though she makes a little a few cameos right she shows up in the sit and the seven seals right she shows up in the first second third fourth seal does she not so she makes a little cameo she's the one that Satan can't touch her oil and wine praise God hallelujah she's the one who's got the anointing of the four anointings the four living creatures and then she shows up in Revelation 10 where there's a mighty angel comes out and brings the open book and then John receives it from brother Branham or the seventh angel right and it takes it to all the world who's he taking it to they're taking it to the bride of Jesus Christ amen so we know we know what brother man was saying though the bride goes up after that tribulation happens judgments fall destructions fall but then we we know the bride is kept from all that and the next time we see her she's at the marriage supper the lamb amen having that promised communion that jesus promised that i will gain sup with you I'll drink a new of the vine again but it'll be in my father's kingdom amen we know that and so we understand what the Prophet is saying here and brother Branham said he makes this then he jumps to that thought in revelation 19:7 the bride makes herself ready amen and he tells the story of the son of the superintendent from the armor and Swiss company which were very familiar with but he tells that story and the son was looking for a wife and he couldn't find a wife in Chicago so he goes out west to his family and and all the girls know that that he's going to come looking for a wife and all the cousins and they all dress up in there and there are beautiful dresses but the real sweet godly woman was too busy to get dressed up and she's washing dishes and and the son you know he went to the party and you know there he didn't really dance with any girls didn't see really godly character and he must have slipped by and seen her washing dishes maybe in the kitchen off to the side and he went back out and come back in he said God must have spoke to his heart and said this is your wife you mean to propose to her right now God must have gave him some revelation amen she couldn't even believe it like you want to marry me program says that's how the church is how could Jesus want to marry me but we know that the son saw a godly King and we know Jesus sees that we want his character amen that we live his character we don't look fancy and program said the girls are like in denominations that dress up their churches and in glamour and money and popularity and big buildings and all these things he said but the real life had character she was the servant and Jesus said the greatest among you is the servants amen exactly right she was an orphan brother Ram said she had no father or mother right and we just feel like orphans in this world praise God we just were rejected by our families rejected by our friends we're just rejected by everybody but thank God if they threw us out Jesus will catch us with his nail-scarred hand amen hallelujah as well if that tonight you know brother I'm told a story and while he was preaching this series and he was saying God is doing such great things right now in the church you know Jefferson it was just really quiet he said God is shaking the earth right now with a message mother and said let me prove it to you he said when Jesus Christ came to the earth he said there was millions and billions of people on the earth and Jesus came and never left the Judean area other than go down to Egypt when he was younger and he said brother man said Jesus came was crucified raised and he said hardly anybody even heard about it and brother man said Jesus only comes to the elect Amen I knew ya so the fact that you've heard this Bible restored and preached that proves you're one of his elect amen and great things are happening but it's not what we really see with our eyes it's the individuals cuz the Gentile bride is an individual bride right she's she's not a group of people or a nation she's a group of individuals that love Christ and she's slowly being made ready by the Holy Spirit as God shakes everything that can be shaken and everything else falls but you and I stand because we're wise we built our foundation upon a rock amen the Word of God hallelujah that's exactly right and you know the story where brother man said you know the the year came and and the whole year she was you know working making her nickels so she could buy a wedding dress and then brother Han said she went and stood out there with her wedding dress on and everybody's laughing the sun's going down oh you poor creature you miss a real creature you really think he's going to come and marry you and they're like oh you just got one more hour she's like he's coming oh you only got 15 more minutes he said he'd be here you're down to 30 seconds and they laughed and threw vegetables at her and they made fun of her but pretty soon they heard the galloping horse I don't know how to do a galloping horse to you I'm not a ride horses but but the pretty soon she heard the galloping horses and and all the dirt and the dirt clouds are rising and God and you know God touched her heart and then she saw him come and he stops and everybody else said he he picked her off her feet and gave her a kiss and brought her into the carriage and drove off and all the cousins are you know sad and shocked and everything like that that's exactly how the rapture is gonna be praise God we're going to be mocked and made fun of but Jesus said do not fear little flock amen don't be scared of the time don't be scared of what's happening do not fear it's God's good will to give us the kingdom amen because we've already received a portion of the kingdom for the kingdom of God is within us hallelujah glory so he says his wife makes herself ready and then brother man pulls an interesting tight he used Elijah as the type of the bride which is a great type right Elijah came and Elijah said give me a double portion he said if you watch me today he said you will get your request it's a hard thing to do it's a hard thing for somebody to get a double anointing of the Holy Ghost that's a hard thing but you've got to keep your eye right on the message of the hour amen I believe said Elijah made himself ready because he followed the prophet Elijah and he looked and waited and when he saw the garment come down he had to go and catch the garment or the the mantle and then he the mantle put it on and then he used the mantle and that was Elijah making himself ready Church we've got to receive the same Holy Spirit that brother Branham received and we've got to speak Jesus's name the same way brother Branham spoken amen and if we do that then we are making ourselves ready by the same anointing that was on him amen I've always told that story like this I knew I had a greater even greater revelation that brother Branham was a true prophet after I went the guy on in the first time because that's the first time ever cast out devils and when I did it the Holy Spirit just anointed me and said divine love cast out demons and after that I was no longer scared us little teenage girl you know she was staring straight ahead with this deathly you know look on her face and and wouldn't talk to me very much at first and then after that anointing came over me I thought I know how Jesus did it Jesus would take the sick person or wherever and he would separate them from all the scoffers I took her around to the back of the church there the Church of the firstborn and his squab oh it's a little island of ask Weibo I think that's how you say it and it was at that moment that I said do you want to be delivered from this demon and she nodded and so I just said let's join hands we had a couple preachers with us there and as soon as I bow my head and pray she started fighting and kicking it and doing everything hitting me with her hands you know I just stayed kept taking the hits you know and holding onto her hand like this and I just said this I said it Satan the blood of Jesus Christ is against you and it wasn't just maybe a minute we just kept praying us and I said Satan you must leave this child of God the blood of Jesus Christ is against you and pretty soon she loud this loud scream like some evil would happen and then she fell down like she was dead and then I went and shook her you know woke her up and she was different she felt better and I lifted her up and we just sang a song of Thanksgiving there and then that took me back to the Bible because when Jesus casted out the Bible said that the demons gnashed a person let out a great scream and then fell down his dead and that was the moment where I knew brother man's message was even more of a Bible message because the very things Jesus did he was now doing in me praise God because I just followed the word followed the message like brother branham's hearted amen see that's us making ourselves ready taking what the Word of God says and putting it into action by the grace of the Lord amen hallelujah program said making yourself ready is keeping all the evil out of your heart if you have anything against anybody the Holy Spirit would implore us all to get that evil out of our hearts don't have any evil feelings toward anyone talk to them write a letter to them call them on the phone whenever you have to do but we must rid all evil out of our hearts if we're going to be ready for the rapture then my brother branham kind of breaks off that thought and he jumps into divine healing I'm just gonna preach it because I like this thought he gave well Graham said you know he said when a Pentecostal preacher does something wrong he said the newspaper splashing across the front pages you know brother Han was standing up for the pennant that was the move of the hour the Pentecostals but brother Han said you let a Catholic priest make a mistake they'll never put anything on it and he said anybody that doesn't believe in divine healing they'll never attack that he said but we believe in divine healing and brother man made this point he said he said there was an article where they said a person died believing in divine healing and God didn't heal them he said it was splashed across the newspaper and brother Branham said something along these lines he said how many in the grave let's say that person did die they were believing in divine healing but God didn't answer that time he said let's say that did happen he said but I wonder let's compare how many are in the graveyard that died trusting in medical science compared to those that in the graveyard that were counting in divine healing amen I like that what was bro time saying he said I'd rather die believing in divine healing than trusting in medical science he said and no doubt there's Eve there's millions that died believing in medical science to make me just a few that died believing in divine healing amen Church we must rest upon God's Word no matter how God chooses to take us off the scene if the rapture doesn't happen at all eyes let's have a confidence let's trust let's stand on God's side amen let's be fully convinced whatever whatever the situation I'd rather stay with God and be a fanatic than stand with the world and their changing ideas and beliefs let's say was something that's eternal now saith the Lord amen I thought that was a good point don't you Oh maja was so blessed to hear that what a blessing now before we move on this week I was really blessed you know someone watched one of my videos I made it was called the five reasons the raptures pre-tribulation and it kind of ties in with this because John was a type of the rapture and some even a brother from some non-denominational Church he said my this video would open my eyes and the whole time I know it's you know revelations God gave brother Brad as I told him God sent a prophet and he wasn't really interested in that he just want to know the reasons the rapture would go before the tribulation so uh he said I was so inspired he said I took your notes and I went and preached at my church and he said it was really well received so he gave me a link to watch his sermon but I haven't watched it yet I just haven't had time you know I got a listen to Branham I haven't had time yet maybe this summer I'll have time but I just want to refresh these to your heart because I was even listening this morning to brother Branham brother Graham said these again there's at least five reasons we go before the tribulation the first is that the tribulation is trouble for Jacob because it's called Jacob's trouble it's not called trouble for the Gentile bride amen it's called Jacob's trouble it's purging for Israel and it's purging for the foolish version but the Bride of Christ has already purged a men she's purged right now lujah purged from her sin unbelief and lust and pride and greed she's purged from all that washing the blood of God's own son amen the second program said there's no mention of the bride in the book of Revelation in the tribulation chapters of Revelation like chapters nine right nine ten and I'm sorry nine eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen there's no mention of the bride in any of those chapters it's never talking about the churches or all these things it's all dealing with Mystery Babylon Israel and then foolish virgins that's exactly right so God cared so much he didn't even put the word Church in any of those chapters he kept those four chapters 1 2 & 3 and then 19 onto the end amen and then the third one is that the bride is promised a pardon from the wrath of God 1st Thessalonians 1:10 said that Jesus has delivered us from the wrath that is to come amen the Bible says we do not have to go through the wrath because that's what Christ experienced on the cross amen he took our tribulation period there amen he bore our sins and the chastisement of our peace and and the all of our sins or he's wounded for our transgressions right he took our transgressions then the punishment for our transgressions they already paid for and he conquered her sins already amen he didn't have any sins of his own to conquer so he conquered your sins amen he conquered my sins hallelujah we ought to rejoice in that hallelujah amen fourthly Jesus taught the rapture was imminent which means it could come at any unknown or surprising day or hour and that's different than the Jews the Jews always have a set time humming Oh Daniel 70 weeks is a set time is that right that's what Jesus taught he said of the church at the times of the Gentiles Jesus literally said those words the times of the Gentiles in Luke chapter 21 Jesus said there's time for the Gentiles it's unknown any so if you do a mid-tribulation rapture you could actually count the days and know when mid-tribulation rapture was right yeah absolutely you would know so it would be ridiculous to say that the rapture is in the middle of the tribulation or after the tribulation or that the rapture already happened the rapture didn't already happen we're here and lair to see yeah now the rapture happened in your heart you have a foretaste of the rapture but the full rapture is the redemption of your body amen it's what our bodies are swallowed up in life amen that's the fullness of the rapture yes I know the shouts gone yes I believe the rapture started in our hearts but the fullness of the rapture cannot take place to the shout boys Trump and we meet Christ in the air a men hallelujah people get so lost on their own ideas we've got to stay with the Word of God amen stay with the message god help us and then the fifth reason the fifth and final are now if you have more let me know so I can update that video with the fifth one is that the rapture is actually the removing of God's grace before the Antichrist is revealed and God returns to the Jews it's actually the removal of God's grace right because the Bible said that in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 that God will let all these things happen until he be taken out of the way right so see there's five obvious Bible reasons revelations that you and I will not have to experience the tribulation if we're born again Oh hallelujah aren't you glad you're born again haha please God amen it's a tremendous privilege to be born again in this hour amen so let's go to the next thought number two remember these are all the thoughts that he preached in this part one the second thought is the door was open in heaven this is a little shorter thought but brother Graham reads Revelation 3:8 and John 10 where Jesus said I am the door of the Sheep praise God well Graham said the shepherd is the door for the Sheep hallelujah and Brougham said John went through the door or in other words he went through Christ right Jesus said I am the door and brother Ram says that Jesus is the one way because Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life in the head but man said Jesus was that open door if you remember the church ages the door actually opened in Philadelphia how many member that it was the age of the open door why was it the age of the open door because the name of Jesus Christ was restored in Baptism and casting out Devils in power and Godhead amen glory and the day was open and now John is going through that door he's going through the anointing of the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's exactly right the program said see it's one door he said can you picture Noah standing there for 120 years and as the ark is no nois preaching by one door Oh hallelujah you seen the ark in Kentucky yet oh I think of that every time I think of preach on Noah now this huge art and it's got only one door in now they've got other ways in but really there's only one way in there's a little off the word which we expect yeah they don't they don't know the message or they reject it or whatever happens but bo-ram said Noah stood in the door of the ark and preached repentance and righteousness and everybody who wanted to be saved had to come through the one door that's right I can imagine you know Noah standing there in order to get through in order to get through the tribulation well that's what we would say right for their day in order to be carried over through the tribulation right he said you'd have to come up you'd have to hear Noah preached you have to confess your unrighteousness because he was a preacher of righteousness you have to go up there you have to repent love God worship God made me go to a sacrifice then you have to shake know in his family's hands as you walked in there to the ark you have to be one of them Holy Ghost rollers amen it's I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them it looks just like a little family Church but each one of those believers that really believe God's Word they were unashamed and they said I'm going through the day or hallelujah just like we today say we're going through Jesus Christ name hey man so John if he was going to go through a rapture Revelation chapter 4 he'd have to go through the one door Jesus Christ amen that's what we're going through the name of Jesus Christ that's exactly right third thought number three is the voice of the trumpet the Bible said here in verse one that the first voice which I heard and that's in that sweet I don't really put notes about that but it was the first voice what's the first voice you hear in the morning is it the voice of the Lord I hope so when you turn on your phone or turn on your computer or whatever you do in the morning hope it's not the radio and some you know some advertising I don't the first voice you hear in the morning is the voice of Jesus so he gets raptured up after the church ages John gets raptured up because he's going to see the things that come after the church ages he gets raptured up and the first thing he hears is the voice of Christ hey man and that beautiful because Jesus is the first in the last he's the first thing we should think about when we go to bed I'm sure we wake up and the last thing we think about when we go to bed but a man said the he said put the house of God first brother Branham said he said pay your tithe first all these firsts set your heart on things above and not this earth hey man first the first voice he hears is the voice of Christ but RAM said see now the scene has changed it was Patmos he had a vision and Patmos and now brother Ram said he's lifted up maybe translated from Patmos to heaven amen Oh glory the voice of a trumpet Amen now think notes I want to say here but Ram said the voice has a clearness of that as a trumpet but Lam said a trumpet means two things that gathering together and also war in the Bible so he said the church ages were now done at least in John's he's getting a preview of things to come the voice at in chapter 1 was behind him I remember that in Revelation chapter 1 John standing all of a sudden here's a voice and he turns to look at the voice and brother picks us up and said look the voice that was behind him that he turned to look to that voice has now gone up to heaven amen hallelujah and brother him said that's because Jesus earthly work was now finished the Holy Spirit unto the church Ages brother Branham says Jesus's own body Jesus's own presence was there with the candlesticks and so it proved Jesus's Holy Spirit is with us today in these church ages he's with us today I know there's I'm gonna preach on this dementia there's times God withdrawals himself from our lives I'm gonna preach on that coming up here by God's grace there's all these scriptures about God how he withdraws himself from real believers to test them I feel like that's what I'm going through right now I'm going through a test a lot of tests lately but I'm willing to walk with God's despise whew but see this voice Jesus was with the candlesticks and he heard that voice in the midst of the candlesticks but now that voice has moved up to heaven and it called him up and said come up hither o my Jesus earthly work was finished in other words his spirit left the the times of the Gentiles brother Branham said that this is the setting of the great battle on the earth now once Jesus left with the candlesticks he said now those who rejected the Holy Spirit must go through the tribulation period he said Jesus is now getting ready to pour out the plagues from heaven how many know he does that the scripture tells us he's there sitting on the throne and then these vials get poured out by angels you know well if it will preach on that adventure I'm gonna go through I want to preach the whole book of Revelation so far I'm sorry the whole book so so far I'm free chapter one two three now man four so we'll get there Lord willing if God terry's I want to preach the whole thing and he says this is what is happening Jesus getting ready to pull out the plagues but RAM said it behooves us to check-up daily he said we must die daily I trust you do that every day I trust you take a moment and say well where's my house my heart doing with the Lord right now is there anything I need to confess is there anything I need to make right God knows we need to do that every day he said Jesus getting ready to pour out the plagues at this time now remember what did chapter 1 say when John was in the spirit and he started seeing these visions he said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day program tells the Lord's Day is at the end of the Battle of Armageddon when Christ comes back that picture I had the beginning when Christ comes back and now he starts the sword comes out of his mouth and starts destroying all the king as a man brother Bram said that is the Lord's Day because the kingdoms of men had become the kingdoms of our God amen so see John was transported and he sees envision Jesus and what he's going to look like there at the time of judgment and now that Jesus that was there though in the church ages has now gone up and he goes up and he sees and hears the voice as a trumpet thank God for the trumpet amen now brother him said this is the same voice he heard now it speaks from heaven program stops it makes a remark about how he must have the the wedding garments on for the sure how many remember the parable where Jesus told that parable he said the king was having a feast for his son and everybody came in and everybody had all wedding garments except one person my brother ham said in those days you had to shake somebody's hand maybe the the bridegroom's hand at the door to get into the wedding reception and he would give you a garment and brother ham said every Holy Ghost Christian looks alike to God no matter how poor you are no matter how rich you are every Holy Ghost full person looks the same in the sight of God program said that's because you all come through the door amen you all get borned again hallelujah your mother says you all act the same way you love the world amen you love the Holy Spirit you love God's grace amen he said you've all washed your garments and made them white in the blood of God's own son he said that man who didn't have the garment climbed up through a window somewhere man can you imagine he was so scared of the Holy Ghost he said I'll just try to climb in the window I'll just I'll just try to go this way and hopefully brother so-and-so her sister so-and-so won't see me I'll try to get in there can you imagine he was so scared of acting like everybody else I want to be in there but I don't want to be filled with the Holy Ghost Church we should be so filled with the Holy Ghost people should see God's Spirit in our lives amen they should know something's different about that guy that girl's got zeal for the lay that woman's got zeal she loves Jesus if that's one thing I know about her is that she loves Jesus amen we should look different like when I got my job I was telling to the people when I got my job there was teachers in there that word denominational Christians and they said as soon as I walked in they knew I was a Christian without saying one word they said there was a glow on my face and they said that guy's a Christian and then when I introduced you don't make up to them they didn't like me anymore but that that's okay I can laugh about that cuz I still have love for them I still love for them they don't know they don't like that that's fine but we like it cuz it's the Bible but see that's the kind of glow we should have on our lives is that people can see their something different because he loved she looked much more her life should look much more different than death again if we've got the life of Jesus if we've got Jesus own life our lives our faces even number Stephens face was was like a face of an angel we should have angel faces hallelujah amen I like that so he stops it he said Jesus even called this man a friend but then cast him out so listen as friendly as Jesus is he is gonna call he's gonna call people friend but he's gonna kick them out of the rapture do that of course they'll never go in the rapture you understand it's a parable but he'll kick them out they won't be hanging they won't be I say associated with the Holy Ghost Saints at the time of the rapture remember I preached out a few years ago the Bible said that the father walked in and it was his last time he came down here and he started is the last time he started separating before the wedding started see there's going to be a move of the Holy Ghost in the last day and it's gonna be such a move of the Holy Ghost it may have happened already with all this believe the sudden nonsense and the father is going to come in and he's going to ruin everybody who's not born again and we can say friend we love you but you don't have the garment on you've got to go through the door like John you've got to go through the door Lorenza you've got to go pray up you've got to lay on the altar you've got to die to yourself you've got to want God's Word more than your own food amen you got to be willing to sacrifice and and pray and fast you've got to love God more than anything else in the world but see give it a few years you find out what's more important to people food riches money cars all these things what's more important is the Word of God or is the tractions of the world more important give it a few years by their fruits they're known maybe it was some people it's even months and weeks you find out that's really sad breaks our hearts but for those of us who are standing the test of time it ought to be an encouragement to us why because you're making your calling and election sure amen we're proving which side were on hallelujah we're making it true they're making it obvious everyone which side we're on glory Oh BAM said there's no other way you can't come through a window of a creed or a window of a church membership you got to come through the door the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man I love that suburban ends this part by saying Jesus was showing John the church age was over he's come up now into heaven alright now it seems like I'm missing something for my studies Oh we'll get back oh yeah here this yeah oh yeah program makes a statement he goes on and preaches more thoughts and he comes back to the trumpet and he said brother Aaron says I just can't get away from that voice I hope that's how you feel this morning I just can't get away from the voice of God speaking through his word amen program yes that's right so that I took notes right in the order of the sermon usually have more time to kind of adjust them and it had much time this week he said that voice left the earth when it was behind John and then in front of John and then that voice called John up to heaven and then Bertram reads the rapture tax of the shout voice Trump and brother Branham said we know what the voice is going to say praise God the voice is going to say come up hither is that right there's a shout voice and Trump of God amen and brother have said that voice shout voice Trump brother branham said it's the voice of Christ brother and said Christ this is a literal quote Christ is the voice of the Archangel I don't know I know that hill Michael's an archangel he's only an archangel I know of but he said Christ is the voice of the Archangel so in other words remember brother Graham said in the rapture message Christ does all three as he descends Christ gave the shout through brother Branham glory Christ is the voice of the Archangel whatever that is some people say it's going to be the bride column fourth rapture I don't know about that I'm not sure about that because Jesus is the one who called forth Lazarus from the grave it was Jesus so I'm not for sure really matter as long as I hear the voice right that's something to fight over fuss over start denomination over I just let's let it go which way it goes let's just hear the voice of Jesus he says the same voice that called Lazarus the trumpet he said is the voice of Christ and did you know you're here in a trumpet this morning how many knew that brother he's just he's just the pastor you know he's it's not me it's the word behind me is the voice of Christ today it's a trumpet cuz well Graham says that when the Bible comes the words of God every word is a trumpet brother Branham says every sound of the word is a trumpet he said the gospel trumpet and when it sounds it's the truth Oh hallelujah praise God I just wrote down on my sheet I'm so thankful I've been blowing this trumpet for 14 years and it hasn't as my trumpet it's the trumpet of the laird amen glory just trying to track some tension but see there's so many voices only the elected will hear the trumpet of God in this area amen that's fine if I preach 14 I think I can preach 14 more by God's grace every word of God motives that see there's nothing uncertain about this word that we're preaching he said there's nothing uncertain because if a trumpet blows if it's an uncertain sound you won't know what to do so he said God makes his word a trumpet a familiar sound and he said there's nothing unfamiliar about acts 2:38 ha oh yeah there's nothing uncertain about acts 2:38 hi there yet there's nothing uncertain about Hebrews 13:8 there's nothing uncertain about revelation 10 7 Church are you asked me there's nothing uncertain how do you know because I know what this trumpet sounds like I know his voice amen it's a ward voice and it's got to be true to every word of God hallelujah that's exactly right well the man said sinner should repent after hearing this same voice he said the same trumpet tonight oh my Church this ought to make you rejoice to see the election of God today so many people have heard the preaching of the message but not everyone has repented what makes you different it's because God chose you in Christ from the foundation of the world God knew you God foreknew if she would do brother Ram tells us he foreknew you choose it's not like well I like Jesse more than this person or I like this person it wasn't that it was are gonna be our reaction what was gonna be our reaction where we gonna freely give Christ our love or we gonna love the things that the world and sellout Christ but God foreknew you would love him so he ordained you and chose you in his mind and then he made sure the word came to you praise God Oh glory everywhere it is a trumpet I know I was never good with instruments brother vang but it's good to know I've been blown a trumpet for 14 years that's pretty good to know every time I got you know it on the piano I was never any good you know and maybe didn't spend enough time there but one thing I know I can play a trumpet by God's grace because it's his trumpet now I'm not I'm just the one holding that praise God if it's his voice his word is trumpet I'm just holding it there I'm playing it for him glory okay so how I was feeling in my spirit I was missing something that's it all right let's go to chapter 2 I'm sorry verse 2 chapter 4 verse 2 you love the Lord amen we'll take a deep breath I got about 20 more minutes here I think I can do it by God's grace in Revelation 4 verse 2 brings you kind of hard today so after I don't know I have to do come down maybe I don't know revelation 4 verse 2 and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne so thought number four but RAM takes his thought up sorry of and immediately I was in the spirit but Ram said when you hear the voice of God something happens to you a church we gather every Wednesday every Sunday sometimes twice on Sunday if we're really hearing the Word of God something needs to happen to us or else we aren't hearing remember I preach out a few last year double of hearing we were the ones who gotta be careful we don't get dull ears because we've got the word of the hour we're not feeding on dead carcasses from Luther or Wesley's ager Azusa Street we're not feeding on those we're supposed to have fresh word right but if you hear if John heard the voice and immediately he got in the spirit then when we hear the voice of Christ we should immediately be in the spirit he says when you hear the voice of God something happens to you brother Graham said I heard the voice of God 33 years ago and I've never been the same since I heard it haha hallelujah I've heard the voice and I've gotten the spirit he said this is referring to the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I was so torn up with the things of the world he said but Jesus give me the rest that he promised in Matthew chapter 11 come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy-laden and I'll give you rest for your souls I don't know about you but I don't feel any rest anywhere really except when I'm communing with the Lord praise God the only rest is when I'm in his presence or meditating and praying and and witnessing all these things when I'm aware of his presence if you're in the world and you're feeling nervous and and trials and all these things like that we've got to listen for the voice of God that will inspire us and immediately we'll be in the spirit we got to hear the voice and many times for me like I maybe this for you I don't know how it is for you I don't hear really voices what I do is I read the scripture then something just starts burning in my heart oh that's right many times like I forgot about that and the Bible said that you'll stir up your minds by way of remembrance sometimes it's something brand-new you know which is such a blessing hallelujah but it's like when I read the Bible and like this just this thing comes over me what is it it's that voice and it puts us in the Spirit of God amen you might get it through a dream though you might get it through the preaching of the word hopefully you do by God's grace amen but that's the thing to hear the voice stop this any other voice and hear the voice of Christ then you'll be in the spirit so the proper emphasize is that immediately you'll be in the spirit I better I gotta try to finish there something else I want to say about I need to finish this then maybe I'll say it tonight by God's grace or wait maybe Wednesday night thought number five one set on the throne but the RAM said that only one sat on the throne he said Jesus's body now sets there on the throne as a memorial and sacrifice Jesus was saying to John come up higher where I am because I've left the earth because it's time for the rapture and now one sits upon the throne in heaven aren't you glad - doesn't say three I've been reading that Purpose Driven Life book which has a lot of good things in it really tremendous book because it has a lot of Scripture as almost a thousand scriptures in it and I'm gonna I want to preach a series based off of that but do a message version of that because it's really powerful if you see that look at all the scriptures there and use brother Adam quotes you it's I think it'll be really powerful I know at least for me that's where I'm at right now I just want to watch I'm gonna make my calling and election sure I will know that I am here and I'm doing God's purpose not a selfish purpose but anyways he has a little chapter in there and say how God you know God God wasn't lonely before the foundation in the world because he had three people to talk to now that's not paganism Church I don't know what it is and he says Oh God wasn't lonely because he had through two other people to talk to you are you kidding me 33 million people bought that book and I wonder how many swallowed it down but see we've got a thinking man's filter Amen I pour these contents of the filter that Trinity Dogma that that forsaken awful God dogma that doesn't make it through the filter of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah so those things don't hurt me I can read a book that maybe isn't a message book and I can still pull out the good things because I've got a filter it's all the baptism of the Holy Ghost recently I was talking to a gentleman who was kind of upset with me for some things I said and I said every word brother Branham said is not thus saith the Lord he said well then how do you know I said I've got a thinking man's filter I said what about the program said the white horse rider right was where first Jesus and then it turns out thus saith the Lord it's Satan the Antichrist he said well how do you know so I just put those things upon a shelf I said yes when I understand I put up to the shelf but I said there's a gift inside of a preacher where the Bible says the preacher rightly divide the word of truth I don't interpret it the Prophet interpret it the answer was somewhere about the white horse rider the answer was in the sermons but it took the Holy Spirit to direct us to the word and the preachers rightly divide that word I'm not the interpreter the prophets the interpreter but the Holy Spirit is still speaking how do you know it's that same voice hallelujah it's a word voice and the brother just kind of shook his head like maybe didn't understand or maybe I couldn't live like that I've had numerous people kind of different with me even to the point of leaving the church at times you know where where they they just can't understand that we have to take everything brother Graham said back to the word I said with that you've got to be careful because there's a deity spirit behind that if you're not careful you make everywhere brother Branham said thus saith the Lord how do you know that still small voice you pray you wait on the Lord you know he's a man of God you know he's a prophet but even brother Branham said you've got to look in the Bible five if I make a mistake on tape he said go look in your Bible that's how you know but don't get me wrong I appreciate people that are respectful and they they just don't understand it or maybe they haven't studied but preachers study every single day they lay in the scripture because that's their job that's what the Bible said give yourself to studying amen give yourself to the ministry to doctrine hallelujah because the Bible said if you preach the right doctrine it'll save you and then that here you brother brother have said I heard it today or yesterday but never said any man that doesn't have a doctrine does not have a ministry is that right you've got if you're a preacher you've got to have doctrine because doctrine is instruction and what are we instructing on God's holy word we want to be instructed to how to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit how to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll you have the power of God flow through our lives and our church and how to go to heaven in the rapture amen that's doctrine it's all doctrine because it's all teaching to the word we just need the spirit to make that real to us but every preachers got doctrine they can't say well he just preached a doctrine only yeah if you don't have the Holy Ghost he's just preaching doctrine only but if he's got the Holy Ghost he's preaching Holy Ghost doctrine haha exactly right amen oh so many critics but God help us to live above the critics he does Church he does he does amen one on the throne that's all he says he just says it about Jesus's body the body had now left the church ages the candlesticks and now that body is on the throne now thought number six John is now caught up in heaven brother Mannis let's see John again being taken up he's a type of the rapture of the New Testament church which we all know up into heaven just like Paul was brother victim says and he quotes 2nd Corinthians 12 where Paul was caught up into the third heaven and Paul though was forbidden to even talk about it can you imagine that you and I we may keep some secrets you know our whole lives but probably we talk about most secrets eventually with our you know closest people right our wives or spouses - right or your pastor you may say something your pastoring confidence or maybe your mother your father most of us are you know we're not going to take many secrets to the grave right but here in this case Paul and he even wrote almost the entire new test but he was able to keep those things that he saw the third heaven he was able to keep those secret this whole life he never told him he said what a difference Paul was confident heaven couldn't write about it couldn't even talk about it but John is given such a privilege brother Bantam said not only could he talk about it he was told to write about it he said write this down in the book and seven send it to the seven churches amen hi the seven to those seven churches you're going to be far privileged you're going to give me a privilege apostle to be able to see these things in heaven and church not only just the this was the very height of heaven this was the throne of God Amen you there's no higher heavens in this as far as I know is there so he's entitled to go to the highest of heavens this is the the very throne of Jesus Christ and not only see it but write about it amen John caught up into heaven church aren't you glad eleven of the Twelve Apostles as far as we know never got to read the book of Revelation only one of them did we are hearing things that Jesus's own apostles didn't get to hear the Bible said they're so beautiful the angels of God desired to look into these things these secrets in the mind of God we are such a blessed people god help us to get our thoughts off earthly things and set our affections on things above these things are so precious these things are so beautiful it's like a little heaven when we come to church here sorry but we got to be we got to be consumed by the realities of heaven the realities of the Word of God that's how I feel you know some people might say well you do a lot of teaching brother Jesse that's maybe the gift God gave me but listen according brother branham it takes me up into heaven a little bit are you up in having a little bit you know every church should be lifted up into heavenly places these things inspire us these are the real the things that are real the things that are not seen we got to stop looking at things we see and start looking at things we can't see praise God God's promises amen the future home the future the heavenly throne of God we got to set our affections on things above hallelujah caught up in heaven amen okay our last few thoughts I'm at the end you can never see that I'm at the end here I'll try to finish up here by God's grace thought number seven brother Ram says let's go on your Bible to Matthew 26 2016 28 forgive me Matthew 16:28 brother branham said he wanted to clear up an old hanger with this preaching so brother Graham said the preaching of revelation 4 verses 1 and 2 clears up the old hanger which is an old lie that Jesus didn't tell the truth for the RAM says so people unbelievers will look at Matthew 16:28 and say Jesus lied so let's read Matthew 16:28 of course we know Jesus never lied he could not lie he was perfect he was God in flesh lived a sinless spotless life but he said that the old hanger that hangs around unbelievers verily I say unto you there be some here standing here which shall not taste death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom amen so brother Ram in the next chapter chapter 17 let's go down to verse 3 and behold there appeared in him Moses and Elias talking with him and now let's skip to down to verse 8 when they lifted up his eye their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only so you've probably heard this before but if not then it'd be fresh to you but brother Adam said see many people said Jesus made a mistake there's no nobody ever saw the kingdom of God and he lied and then they even quote let's go to john2112 let's read out one just cuz there they both tied together john2112 he said it's just a misunderstanding people misunderstand Jesus's words were 2112 and Jesus said I'm sorry I'm sorry twenty-one twenty-two yeah sorry yeah I wrote that down mercy forgive me and Jesus say to him if I will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me so in both cases Jesus gets misunderstood in this last case everybody thought John was gonna live to see the rapture and physically have a body change in other words go through the adoption because Paul said that was the adoption to wit the redemption of our bodies so the rapture is the as the final finality of the adoption it's the last part of the adoption is the actual body change but if you're born again the adoption has already started in your heart because it cries Abba Father God is my father God is my provider God is my caretaker God will take care of me amen hallelujah and you pray that prayer our Father who art in heaven you say thank God he's my father he's Laura's father he's Connie's father he's John's father he's all of our Father what a wonderful father we have amen that's the beginning of the adoption you're born again and you know I'm a son I'm a daughter and he's my father oh hi but see brother said there's an old hangar he said that Jesus they said Jesus lied that they never saw the Son of man coming in his kingdom and then brother Branham says but they actually did on Mount Transfiguration Peter James and John he said were called up he said and they saw he said he calls it a rehearsal of the end times right he said they thought they saw a rehearsal Jesus said some were standing here that will not taste death he says was this infallible brother Aaron said yes a few days later Peter James and John saw the Son of man coming in his power white hair right shining like the Sun his countenance was shining like the Sun pure white garments amen they saw the son of in other words they saw what Jesus is going to look like at the Battle of Armageddon when he's on a white horse and he's clothed and white and he's got a vesture of blood dipped on his thigh there hallelujah that's what he's going to look like the shining Sun and Jesus brother has said Jesus told the truth they saw the coming of the Son of Man by vision Oh hallelujah see the problem is they just don't ask enough questions they just jump to conclusions well Jesus said this had never happened you need to ask more questions is that right remember Caiaphas and Noah said well when is the prophet ever born in Nazareth we've looked in the scripture the Messiah was never to come out of Nazareth they didn't ask enough questions they never went up and asked Jesus said where were you born because he would have told them I was born in Bethlehem just like the Prophet said so see they jump to conclusions rather than searching the Scriptures amen so we've got a question we've not we get we can't jump to conclusions we've got to search it out and not be prideful and say well I've got the answer I know more about it this person's wrong we've got a home in ourselves ask more questions and search deeper in the matter it's exactly right so Peter James and John he goes on this thought of how Jesus's words were infallible program said not only did they see the rehearsal of the rapture he said they saw the issue the millennium as well Oh hallelujah but RAM said that he knew a type of this during his life he said when before Cecil DeMille put out the Ten Commandments he invited all Roberts and a bunch of preachers to preview the movie before it was released to the public Cecil DeMille won to make sure his movie was scriptural they did that recently with I think the passion and some of the other movies they invited some preachers in to see is this scriptural or not of course I was a Catholic version you know but well Graham said see it was a preview before it was made known to the public and brother Graham said that's exactly what happened on Mount Transfiguration it was a preview of what Jesus was gonna do before the public saw it amen and the thing is the public is gonna miss the rapture right they're gonna miss the Russian but they won't miss the Battle of Armageddon for every eye shall see him at that battle every eye they're gonna see that movie they're gonna see that rehearsal played out brother may have said Moses represented the dead New Testament Saints Elijah represented he said the quickened living Saints the translated raptured Saints who have a body change right Moses represent the dead in Christ but then Elijah represented those who are alive and remain and receive a body change on the earth amen hallelujah Claire said see how infallible Jesus's words are and John got to see the film of the rapture tribulation future home and then the rest of the book of Revelation he got to see all the end of the story so not only did John see our Mount Transfiguration he went out to Patmos and got the rest of it as well oh how good god is amen beautiful thank you lord last thought number eight I'm doing good on time great praise the Lord the last time a throne where the RAM said now this throne is no longer mercy this throne is judgment that's his last thought he uses he said Jesus now was sitting on that throne he was in his glory it was a throne of judgment the church age is finished because lightning thundering and voices all issued forth brother and quotes revelation 22 11 he that's holy let him be holy still he that's righteous let him be righteous still he that's filthy let him be filthy still he that's unholy let him be unholy still after the rapture how many know that's the state they remaining after the rapture that's the state they remaining there gonna be one of those that's exactly right brother BAM said God always spares the righteous before judgment always spares the righteous now if you got your Bibles go to Revelation 85 I just want to read these to you again because in Chapter yeah Revelation 85 is sin right yeah I want to read you these scriptures about the lightnings and thunderings it seems like it's all the one insane event okay revelation eight five now keep your spot there but in Revelation four or five is what I had up there right yeah revelation four five and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God God so loved the church ages and the messengers that he has a representation of the church ages and the messengers before him day and night that's how much God loves us Church you catch that he's got a fire there if there's one of seven fires and that's the fire for Laodicea and God as a memorial has that fire as a memorial that people have received his fire of love in their hearts I've got a people on the earth member heaviness through his throne earth is his footstool and he has a reminder there's some of those Saints in Akron they've got this same fire layer see a bride they've got that fire burning right now in their hearts amen hallelujah as a memorial before his throne that's how much he thinks of his Gentile wife hallelujah how they Lou you Jesus chapter 8 verse 5 chapter verse 5 you know this the seven seals open which I believe is the day a moment of the rapture after that the Angels get ready to sound the seven trumpets of wrath but look at verse five and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar cast into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound other madam said all seven of those trumpets sound in the tribulation from the two prophets how many know that all seven sound from the two prophets in revelation 11 go to Revelation 11 19 after the second woe is spoken of in verse 14 Revelation 11:14 go down to Revelation 11 19 and the Temple of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the Ark of his Testament and there was lightnings voices thunderings and an earthquake and great hail look at all this activity going on in heaven because as now the blood they've rejected the blood and now this there's lightning and voices and thunderings does that remind you of something it remind you of Mount Sinai God was going to deal with the people one of the law right my wife and I were talking about that the people were going to take the law and they already going to read but when that even when the law came to them they'd already broken it before the law got there remember what was god of the mountain there was darkness and blackness and lightning that shows God's judgment not mercy God's judgment and now that he's taking his bride off the earth now heaven is filled with lightnings thunderings voices and the earthquake shakes the earth I wonder if that's the LA earthquake and this is after the two witnesses are now raptured up so the 144,000 would receive the Holy Ghost the two witnesses raptured up and now this lightning and thundering is going on in heaven it's purging time well it's the changing of dispensations any man it's almost the new day hallelujah last one revelation 16:18 a stand our feet revelation 16:18 as you're standing revelation 16:18 now this is after the seventh and final vial seventh and final vial revelation 16:18 if you look at verse 17 it says in the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out the Temple of Heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and thunders and lightning and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great look at 19 the great city Jerusalem divided into three parts and the cities of the nation's fell the great Babylon came in remembrance before God to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath the last Sunday we're out on that island at Catalina Island look at verse 20 and every island fled away and the mountains were not found those last time you drove by a mountain you just you stand in awe of it when this seventh vial pours out there's no more mountains islands there's no more islands because lightning thunder judgment the voice of God it's all gonna be washed away as beautiful as that island was as beautiful as mountains are because people have rejected the pressures and blood of Jesus Christ God said I've got to wash it all over again oh but by the grace of God you and I won't see that we'll be up there in heaven with God brother Louis if you'll come brother branham says we'll start with verse three he said next week brother Rams all their call was this and I would like you to just bow your heads if you would for a moment I'm miss who's the same where there was an altar call and nor does this have to be unless you feel led to come to the altar brother Graham said how many of you want to be summoned up to heaven like John was he said would you raise your hand and then brother Graham said god bless you god bless you god
