have two services and we have a carry in in between services so looking forward to that whoever can stay we'd sure appreciate that and I believe that's our only announcement here oh just so you know I thought I was texting brother Matt mcard for July 12th and I told him whatever's best for him will do so he might do two Sunday services or we might us Saturday night in a Sunday morning because he's driving so far he's probably like 6 to 8 hours depending I don't even know where he lives but he's he's pretty far in Indiana so if he's driving a really long distance and let's say he's got to get back to work Monday morning or something like that then I'll say ok brother we'll do a Saturday night and Sunday morning so then he has all Sunday night to travel so just so you know so that that may be tentative I haven't heard back from him I'm sure he's working and I texted him on Monday I haven't heard back from him so we're just waiting on that I just wanna let you know about that let's let's just be a little bit flexible you know for that and if people miss services that's okay you know they got plans or something like that I never want to interrupt people's plans and I hate to change plans but sometimes you have to do it so just to accommodate the preacher so let's try to accommodate the preacher by God's grace just to prayer requests I think we were talking about him in there my mother-in-law's husband Jean is a brain scan tomorrow is that right okay so let's just pray that they don't find any cancer in his brain right okay then let's just pray for Jose he said he didn't come

Bibles here we'll just go right to the memory verse here we've been reading our text over and over we're at 2nd Peter 1:6 but let's go to our memory verse first thessalonians 5:14 or really I'm gonna try to set a timer here so I don't forget by God's grace let's read our memory verse what a wonderful verse here as we're coming to July I'm not sure who'll be next for July were you two given the verse together or going to a separator okay I'll have to talk about it yeah that's fine whatever you want so looking we've enjoyed this memory verse for Jun can't believe next wednesday's july already can't believe that seventh month of the year already unreal well thank the Lord spent a great year I know and I know we can look back and say we've invested this year in this things of God the spiritual things of God their anniversary services and what a great year it's been the fall fast from last last November just wonderful times and God's presence so it's read our memory verse verses 14 down to 23 let's begin on three one two three now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying --zz prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ may God and His blessings rimas word may be seated please I'm gonna poke the visual from Sunday I'm I like to look a little bit more at patience because I know when I preached it at the Bible study I know I didn't get to all the scriptures and as I was reading over them I liked but I really like to get to those and it just be great to read them I think the church would really appreciate that so Lord willing we'll do that here tonight some reason having trouble finding the okay they're just okay I want to look at this here tonight by God's grace and look a little more at patience and then perhaps we'll get to godliness perhaps we'll get to that tonight by God's grace everybody feel okay tonight had a good week in the Lord and the great week in the Lord I've been studying this week on the the seventh the seven churches rather I put about nine hours into just the Ephesian Church eight just studying that and you know it was nice church that brother Branham had all those his history books like foxes Book of Martyrs the anti Nicean Council I'm sorry hunting I see in father's books how did it happen brother Brandon had all those history books and some saint of God typed all those out and now we can search him online now I know they did that about fifty years ago but I'm rejoicing because they did that because now I can just type in Polycarp and I can see every time these historians use Polycarp and what a man of God he was you know as I study as I've told you before as I study history and as I study the Bible the more I know this message is right it's absolutely thus saith the Lord not every detail but the revelations God gave to brother Branham they're nothing but the truth and they line up perfectly with history here's here's one here's one argument recently I heard so John got the revelation around 1895 right and Jesus told him you know unto the Church of Ephesus so some critics and I listened to this week while I was working out outside some critics say we'll see you know Jesus gave the letter to the Ephesus in 1895 and Paul died about 30 years before and so they see they say see Paul couldn't be the ephesian church age messenger because he wasn't even alive when Jesus talked about it I thought that's a that's a bad answer because God has a pattern of sending a messenger the people miss it and then later he tells them who it was amen right because in Matthew 17 jesus told His disciples listen elias already came and you didn't even see it yeah Ray's God and the Bible said he was speaking of John the Baptist praise God insurance as I studied it out you look at that message to the fusion church age brought a brother Paul preached all of it Paul preached about being daily renewed repenting and keeping your first love you could find all these things Paul hated false doctrine paul paul confronted brothers and told them that said they were apostles and they proved they weren't apostles I mean the whole the whole letter to the I mean it's beautiful and I list there's about 10 scriptures I listen jesus said I know you cannot bear those that do evil and Paul said avoid every appearance of evil in our memory Mercia brother it's beautiful shirts to see that that fits God's pattern God will send a messenger the people won't know it later on he'll come back and tell him this is what I just did on a new you and so and then we see the message to the fusion church age lines precisely with Paul's message and also with history in fact Polycarp sat under st. John and st. John of course lived longer outlived even Paul he lived more than 30 years longer than Paul so Polycarp sat at the of st. John and then when st. John went off the scene Pollock art became the bishop in Smyrna and he carried it on exactly like it was with John and then John knew what exactly was like from Jesus oh my and then Polycarp is known he went at nine years old church he traveled 1,500 miles to go to Rome and it's historical fact those history writers wrote about it he cared so much about the church at Rome there was actually three churches of Rome he went to the first Church of Rome and tried to correct them they had already started the Eucharist in 85th I'm sorry 150 AD they had already got a Eucharist they had already had statues in the BA and the history says polycarb sat on the front row next to the bishop and watched all the saints pass through and get their way for their Eucharist and then he watched they all bought bow down at the statue of st. Peter they were re worshipping Saints in 150 AD and he tried to correct them but the bishop of the first church wouldn't take correction and Polycarp said fine the Holy Spirit told him Ephraim has turned unto idols leave them alone so the history says he went to the other two churches and he had revival meetings within he's 90 years old history says they had a major revival the last revival in Rome the dead were raised demons were cast out the sick were healed by God amen then when he got back it was just ten years later that he was martyred he was burned the stake because they hated him so much because he was so much like Christ because his teacher John was with Christ oh my it's amazing Church to see now this and so he he did the exact same thing he was constant getting people to repent he got history says he got two of those brothers in Rome to repent and go back to their first love praise God noting that they had to leave that First Church of Rome and they went to the second and third Church of Rome but he was doing the same things but Jesus told the church that they would experience they exactly did the exact same thing and it's beautiful to see it tile all the way through the church ages I'm just excited to go although and I'm ready for the Samara age tomorrow by God's grace it's just beautiful it's it lines up completely with history and with the Bible what a blessing to know that we've got the truth of God amen it is nothing nothing but the truth now of course you know brother man has his own thoughts in there we've got to rightly divide it and take everything back to Scripture we're aware of that a couple examples or brother Branham says all the messengers come at the end of the age but actually they'll come at the beginning okay so if you look at that and then brother Branham says all the seven Church of age messengers were prophets the next day he says only two are prophets the first in the last so he's constantly learning he's constantly learning and having to read correct himself just like you and I or some of you perfect and you never need correction is anybody in that category right now if not you can help me out I'll call you every day and you can correct me every day no of course not we all need correction right we all need daily guidance from the Holy Spirit and so that just reminds us how much brother Adam was a man but also how he was so humble he could be corrected by the Holy Spirit and bring forth the the full revelation of God's Word amen so let's just briefly go over our patience I know how maybe I'll spend a few minutes I got thirty more minutes here to my timer goes off but let's just review patience it's the the fifth anointing now look at grace patience is Grace amen praise God no patience means steadfastness you are steadfast which means you're determined your perseverant praise God you've got endurance praise God and it especially means that in your greatest trials and your sufferings you can be you can persevere in the myths of your sufferings you know a lot of people and as I was I was thinking all the way here a lot of people give up when the suffering start but patience is an anointing of the Holy Spirit to keep speaking God's Word in the middle of your suffering in the middle of your trials and this is before the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and so you know in other words people will give up on God's promise if they don't have patience right because patience is the anointing to continue believing to be steadfast to keep trying to not give up to not lose hope it's the the anointing you need to keep believing until it happens praise God and so there's a lot of examples you could go with like for example divine healing how many ever been sick and you say lord give me patience so I can inherit the promise for healing yeah right we all go through that right and we I'm sure all of us have been healed at some point or another there's maybe been times we didn't heal we got we didn't get healed when we wanted to I know Amen and I were talking about that we've all we both been through that but eventually God brought the healing praise God you know waiting on the right job you know there's brothers from cam Church we prayed for growth months and months and a year and just wondering how come they don't have a job but we kept prayed and finally they got a job and they've been working hard for you almost 10 years since you know just strange things uh you know a job right even the baptism of the Holy Ghost not giving up on the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen how about not giving up on your loved ones being saying how many knew how many need an anointing for that that's what I want to praise God how about on the person you should marry right or on your children getting the Holy Spirit or when to have children praise God think about all these questions that we have in life that are so much easier when we've got God's anointing of patience upon us we can wait upon the promise of God or if we got a dispute in the family what is this dispute going to be solved what are we finally going to get past this bitterness or this come Blainey or this anger or this division what are we ever going to get past that see the anointing of the Holy Spirit gives you steadfastness in the midst of the trial to keep trusting God and believing and I think we all need it praise God Jesus told Peter we all need it because it's the revelation God gave to Peter right and so that's a practical application to patience how we need it we need it to be content while we're walking on this way we saw with temperance we need to control our bodies while we're walking on this way and now once we got control of our bodies we need control of our minds right so just be steadfast just keep going just keep going to churches keep believing the promise keep praying keep reading your Bible keep confessing them keep confessing the positive promise of God amen and be content serving God with patience so this is the next step I'll be content I'll just keep faithfully serving God although I don't see the promise coming to pass yet I've got an anointing to stay true to God I'm not gonna give up I'm not gonna quit I'm not gonna charge God foolishly because I don't have what I want because it's not really about what I want it's about what God wants me to have because I'm not my own I belong to God amen so this is the fifth measure of the anointing of the Holy Spirit so this empowers you to to go through your battles and become a better Christian right because it's that you're gonna you're gonna continue you're gonna persevere and eventually after this trial ends you're gonna be a better Christian oh thank the Lord see like brother Diggs said you are tested for a testimony you have to overcome with a testimony but the only way to get a testimony is to be tested we all want to overcome we all want to get to heaven we all want to have a Testament but you've gotta be tested to get a testimony praise God so see when you're tested you're confident God's allowing this test to make you more obedient to him and job said I'm gonna have to look this up in just a moment Jonah said when he's tried he'll come forth as gold so job knew that his tests I believe it's a joke 23 so if you got your Bibles let's just turn there I'm not gonna put it up here yeah it's job 23:10 now look you know Jobe if you read it recently Joe was up and down sometimes you at the beginning he was real strong and then sometimes he's like God will just kill me right it's not an interesting job and Elijah both said god kill me with that anointing left there like I'm done i'ma quit I'm quitting just take me home and gods like can't you hang a little trial don't you know I'm trying to get you to be stronger and how many times have we said that oh I can't bear this anymore this is too hard for me and God say no you can bear it you just need more grace you know I'm just actually building patience in your life amen what isn't just like humans that want to quit and give up and want to go home and go to heaven we're job 23:10 but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold Joe knew this was just an examination Jobe knew he was just a school taking a test praise God he was just getting scrutinized he was just in a trial job knew he was just taking a test but he knew after all this is done God's gonna make me become a better Christian praise God he's going to help me become the believer I want to be praise God that's right and so church that's what we see patients as patients is an anointing to endure it and you've got confidence I'll be a better believer at the end of this trial because I'm annointed remember everything in our society is just instant gratification right remember this one I preached on this we have instant instant money transfers we got instant pots we've got instant messengers we got 5g internet speeds which is like almost instant gratification but God works the opposite God likes the delay God likes to wait and God likes to put mountains in your way so that you'll learn to speak to the mountain praise God see because God will reveal his will it revealed his word to you and then he wants you he wants to see you take the word and believe the word and overcome with the word everything's instant in America but with God everything takes time everything is delayed in when it seems to us but Jesus said you possess your souls in other words you you strengthen your grip on eternal life through patience amen the longer you have to wait the the firmer your grip gets on the assurance that you have eternal life praise God amen the longer you wait that's what I'm saying the more real it becomes praise God the more you wait upon God the more he proves himself that he's really meant that's right it's exactly right and how does patience come patience comes in the middle of a trial when you obey God and praise God Isaiah 26:3 says thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts them when this patience come when you're in the midst of a trial brother Adam says patience comes because you're faithful in other words that's why many people are so impatient is because they're so unfaithful to obey God's Word in every little trial they give up and say well I never get the answer they just go back to disbelieving they'll never develop godly patience until they faithfully believe God's Word they go through a hard day then they go through another hard day then they go through a hard week and they keep believing that they go through a hard month and then go for a hard quarter then they go through a hard year but each with each passing month and year the promise of God gets more sure that's the that's what the anointing of patience is to do the Bible said Abraham got stronger in faith Lord by God amen we know were they then he has lapses that means he was just like job just like you right sometimes you're up sometimes you're down sometimes you sometimes you make mistakes and embarrass yourself but then God raises your faith oh thank God even you're the seed of Abraham you might have some mistakes but if you've got the faith of Abraham you're like Abraham let's be strong in faith let's give God glory before it happens amen see that's Abrahamic faith so whatever promise God has made known to us then we should rejoice and give God praise I know sometimes we won't but on a night like tonight and when it's being preached tonight the night we should rejoice in it praise God we should be stronger in faith giving God the glory hallelujah and like our sister Naomi's memory verse was Philippians 4:6 and 7 be careful for nothing in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus see what's keeping you the anointing when you keep the anointing of the Holy Spirit your patient your choosing and you have to choose that you have to choose I will faithfully obey and think about God's Word you I don't know about I don't know if you remember but the Bible says the way you do it is you've got to take somebody captain let me tell you this you gotta take the thought captive I said that long I was thinking about the illustration I was gonna ask Malachi to come up here I won't do how embarrassing I was gonna have one of the kids come up here I was gonna take them captive and like pick them up and like you're coming with me that's what you're supposed to do with evil thoughts when evil thoughts come you don't you don't entertain them you go to those evil thoughts and say I'm taking you captain and I'm casting you out of here like if if applied it's in your house you're gonna chase that flight down right you're gonna take him captive you're gonna make sure you get them kill them and cast them out right it's the same idealist of the spirits if we want to be patient that's what we got to do we got to bring every thought into captivity Islands once we've got it into captivity we've got to cast it down and not entertain it crazy stuff we got to stay with God's folks and believe God's Word that's what patience is faithfully meditating and believing upon God's Word that's patience it's a trial it's a test I know about you but I like to get them I like to get the Flies cornered in a room and and close the door that's how I get them so we got this big long the hallway and man that fly can really you can get places if I don't trap them in the room and that's what we got to do Church we got to get on our knees and we got to just think about this what thought we're thinking whenever evil thought we got a quarter let thought like I brother Aaron says I like the corner the devil praise God amen he likes the corner the devil expose him and show where he's wrong remember remember Berlin said when I'm tired he said that's when Satan will attack me say he'll say you have no friends nobody loves you he said that's when I get tired that's when I get my mind battles he said and then God will have people drive from States to come visit just for one service they'll have a little Drive nine hours just to get here brother branham one time preach a sermon and prevention I'll take that and I'll shove that in the devil's face we got a do we go to look at Satan's lie and then say see see that that's wrong here's what God's Word says amen see it's got to be that's why I praying before service that's like praying every day and looking and taking taking inventory of what thoughts are we actually thinking if we're thinking the wrong box it will lead to unfaithfulness but if we're thinking the right thoughts it will lead to faithfulness and faithfulness reducing patience amen it is Romans 5 Romans 5:3 my main consent so far by God's grace like I was saying on Sunday I appreciate all special meetings there is definitely something special about having lots of people in one place and like romancing the more pillar or fires you know more clarifying the more anointing there's but church he said wherever two or three are there I am in the Mint's we can have a strong anointing of just three beat two people are here that believe they then we can have just the anointing that God wants us to have for that night and no matter what the meeting is it's always going to be the same it's gonna always be cast down what Satan says and obey God's Word believe God's Word oh man speak it act upon it you can't get any greater than that praise God nobody can get any revelation greater than what Jesus did when he said is written and he stood there and you confront the devil and spoke to the devil and refused to obey Him he obey God instead and under that great anointing you got the greatest victory that could ever be had and proved that we can defeat Satan any time place or under any circumstance we just gotta obey God's Word and we can do that tonight it doesn't have to take a special service or a special preacher there's only one preacher the Lord Jesus and he's here tonight Romans 3 5 I'm sorry five three and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation works patience so see trials work patience they accomplish patience so see you can't get patience unless you go through the trials praise God and that's where brother and he picks us up in the church age he said then patience gets an experience and then experience gives you hope see why people have no hope for the rapture or no hope for any victory in their life they don't even get to the patience because they can't faithfully overcome the trials and be faithful to get patience see what I'm saying in the midst of a tribulation they'll forsake obeying the word and they'll go to the pleasures of the world instead of keeping God's Word in holiness so they can't get their patience and then they can't get to experience and then they can't get to hope yeah experience yeah praise God let's see then hope maketh not ashamed so when you have that hope you have notion you're not ashamed anymore see what you got oh we have to keep God's word first praise God we got to be faithful to God's word in the trial then we get patience then experience then hope then there's no shame praise God amen see it's just beautiful it all goes together all right now the the thing we have to turn down we have to get patience we have to turn down making speedy decisions without proper prayer counsel and contemplation decision-making without prayer is a foolish thing the Bible says it's foolish to do that just make a quick decision without praying without really considering what we're doing now I wanted to I know I didn't get to these but you know David David was very big scripture makes seem like for 15 years he was running Saul and he would sing songs to God now if David and joyfully sting in the midst of being with a bounty on his head can you imagine sing like a wanted sign on the Internet and then your pictures there that's how David was right David will had a wanted sign on him his picture there and Saul was trying to kill him and he had a bounty on his head the King says killed equity yeah in the midst of that bruh that he meant God gave him one two three four five songs to sing and there's our answer right there when we're in the midst of a job let's sing and praise the Lord how do we change your spirit how do we get our thinking we got to stop thinking about those things of the world the trial and we got to sing to God glorify God is when we glorify God we come under his anointing because he inhabits the praises of his bride that's right now let's go to Psalms 52 eight and nine so I was 52 eight and nine look how patient is now look at verse 1 verse 1 it says to the chief musician mastiha a psalm of David when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul and said to him David has come to the house of Abimelech so this is David riding by the Amen he knows Saul knows where he is now so God gives him a song in the midst of our trial look for a song praise God that's the time to go on YouTube that's a time to go back to our services and listen to one of our songs this is what God did in the midst of a trial he gives you a song to change your thinking to cast down any thoughts that exalt themselves against the Word of God to glorify God his presence comes down his patience comes down his confidence comes down verse 8 but I'm like a green olive tree in the house of God I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever I will praise thee forever because thou has done it I will wait on that thy name for it is good before thy Saints look he knows that the King knows where he is right he's got a GPS Saul's got a GPS I'm gonna go kill David I know right where it is I got in tracking him right he said I'm just gonna wait here in the house of God I can wait here because God guy I'm like a free time that you're leaving a hurry cause I'm facing life to God I know God throws my steps a night see look most of us if I knew somebody was gonna kill me I probably driveway to Michigan or head some somewhere Florida my furthest relative's house that's where my project right if we were in a fearful state but with the anointing he's content to stay there and he's contagious and I will wait because he knows God's anointing has always protected his Saints amen so see this is these are some of the scriptures I don't think we ever got to that would really I think really help us here now let's just look at a few edge fo job is the poster child for patients because james511 says you have heard the patience of Job and seen the end of the Lord that he's very pitiful and of a tender mercy I'm gonna get say amen to that after you get through a trial it seems so hard but after you get through it you say Oh God had he pitied me so much I was such honey how many could say I was such a baby through that trial I found myself complaining more than I should have Amen I can say bender that I thought it was so hard like the coronavirus I can look back now and say God was very pitiful to me because I was I was nervous over the fact that we're running out of toilet paper I got nervous that was my hardest trial in the midst of the coronavirus oh we're down to about 5 rolls of toilet paper lord have mercy you know that was my hardest I didn't even have covin 19 and I look back now I said and I say wow God was so pitiful praise God God was so mercifully men sometimes church we look back and saying how in the world do we act like that but did God have mercy on you yes does God still love you yes God knows you're gonna stumble just like Abraham just like David he knows joke he knows you're gonna stumble he knows you're human but he's teaching you he's saying it next time be stronger amen all right just like h1n1 like me too didn't have a big impact on it well hope it did have a bigger impact on us well what about the next one if there is a next one see it should be trading us for the next time we'll trust God more praise God amen and it does Church you know every time Satan the Bible says Satan comes in like a flood but every time God makes us a little stronger he raises our strength a little higher a little higher a little higher and God will keep doing that no matter what trials we go through because that's his word amen he's never gonna give us a temptation that we cannot overcome now I want to read a few scriptures about job maybe you've never seen before what was job's great victory his victory was he kept this integrity he never charged God foolishly did he want to die yes did you regret the day he was born yes was he corrected by a young man 'allahu yes did he have miserable friends yes he had a lot of trials and temptations but one thing he never did that God knew he never would do he never turned his back on God amen honey that's how we should be nobody really go through we might complain I feel sorry for ourselves we might wish to die but let us never turn our back on the fact that we know God is in control we might not understand his ways but we'll never cursed God boys love God and we're always trusting them boys believe amen his victory was in his integrity his wife even urged him to curse God but he was patient at the beginning very patient the beginning let's read well there's numerous scriptures here kind of hard to choose here but let me see yeah let's go to job 42 then let's go to jail 42 Joe 42 is the conclusion is such a beautiful picture of patience Joe 42 1 you remember the story Joe gets kind of a little impatient and he says I wish to just got him to come down and talk to me remember that he said I just want to speak to him face to face and finally God comes down in a world when he said gird your loins up like a man and God precedes to ask him over 60 questions and never even answers job's question jokes him try me way to be in the balance show me if I've done wrong God never even answered his question he just asked him 60 questions that he knew he couldn't answer like where's the where does the snow form job show me law where the goats mate in the in the in the mountains can you tell me where that happens he asked him all these questions and God was he was he was showing the joke that God's ways are way higher than his wings amen and he had no reason to doubt Almighty God Joe 42:1 then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be withholding from thee now look what he learns he learns God now he knows God could take away my sorors of my and my my bodily pain right now he knows God can do everything praise God see God could have took away the boils if he wanted but God brew let him remain verse 3 who is he the highness counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not I things too wonderful for me which I knew not here I beseech thee and I will speak I would demand of the end declare thou unto me I have heard of thee by the hearing of my here but now mine I see a thief wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust in ashes now remember James says this is the model of patience and it was it was he never cursed God in the midst of losing his family as money and his health he never cursed God and James writes by the Holy Spirit that's a real man of patience so what does this patient man learn at the end he earned he learned that even though I was patient I said a lot of things I should not have said that's why the Bible says all mouths are like poison ASPs snakes right every mouth is like an open Sepulchre right you know something girls like we're dead bodies they that's what the Bible says in Romans 3 every mouth is like that things just few out of our mouths that we shouldn't say and so joke learns that even though he's patient he realized I uttered some things I should not have say and then he says I have myself I hate myself that's what the word of means I hate myself and repent in dust and ashes see every trial the boils were to get him to repent the boils were to get in the scene that God can do everything amen the loss of his children the loss of his money the loss of everything was to get in the seat how great God is and to keep trusting in God and to assure him that the one you had confidence in the one who you had integrity for he's been with you the whole time he's kept you and he'll do everything right there's my 40 minutes so let me close here boy that went fast honestly I didn't know how it's 40 minutes goodness gracious that really is a shock see he had patient words mixed in there but yet he had my battles and you had to keep bringing those into captivity until God Himself come down and showed him how great he is helping to see you need to repent so you can be patient it still need to be repent right because God looks at the whole thing I just doesn't look at one little oh and I you're not patient yet patient's the whole time but sometimes he wasn't very faithful with it right he maybe lost the anointing but he eventually God would bring him back he'd say the right thing because remember he's the model of patience never curse God praise God he questioned God he questioned himself he questioned others but he never spoke anything evil about our God and so God honored him praise God by letting in me the patience poster child praise God so in closing let me just find a place to close here go to Psalms 105 19 we're already in Psalms this is speaking of Joseph from the Old Testament I love this program brings a scripture on the church each book I had never read it Joseph was in prison two long years imagine that none of us can even get close to that two years in prison and he lay there looking after us actually look at verse 18 whose feet that they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron so Joe bad pain I'm sorry Joseph two years with pain and his feet because of the metal stocks why didn't he why did the baker or the butler write at the butler remember me why do you and you know st. was whispering those things to him and he laid in the iron verse 19 until the time came I was right till the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him see that two long years everybody failed him Potiphar's family failed him right in the way the sermons at Potiphar's house falen and now the very man that saw supernet is like he saw america it's like he did america for this guy and the guy forgets him everybody let him down Church would everybody let you down don't give up on God you feel like everybody's forgotten about you nobody cares about Joe don't believe the devil you believe my Lord Jesus Christ amen it's God letting you be tested amen it's God testing us to see it will be patient in the midst of a trial he was in prison until the time that the word came see God's promise is eventually going to come to pass it's eventually gonna get here but until that time it's a time to be patient it's a time to build up faithfulness I'll faithfully come to church every time I'll faithfully read my Bible pray until that promise finally comes to me I'll keep believing oh oh I'll be patient until that promise finally arrives at my door that's what Joseph said he said I will patiently serve God I won't sit against Potiphar and sleep with his wife I won't curse the God I won't curse these people I will just wait on the Lord I know God is gonna move amen he knew God was gonna move at some time praise God he was gonna do and so God rewarded him praise God at the right time it sees it because he was patient here's the order last thing I'm gonna say Hebrews 10 36 here's the order for ye have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise so here's the three steps do the will of God first number one second here's my five-minute list and second be patient this is the order to receive any promise of God just first obey God's Word do what the Bible says and then patiently wait say god this is the time I'm waiting this is the time like no man says he says I'm sure have a good time knocking cuz I know he's gonna open it to me praise God he said that's a perfect faith is I'm happy knocking cuz I'm one day he's gonna open and give me what I asked for praise God so first do what God says that's where a lot of people stumble they just don't believe they don't won't do they won't obey God's Word but after you obey then you patiently wait you persevere you give God glory in the midst of the trial and at the end of it finally at the end the promise comes the word comes and you inherit the promise praise God let's have our musicians come by God's grace that was 45 minutes can you believe that [Music] how many want to be more patient praise God remember it doesn't mean you'll never utter a wrong word it's not what it means because Abraham did that Abraham even had Hagar and Ishmael right he even lied about his life twice and Abram basically threw out did you try to cover himself to protect himself it doesn't mean you'll never say to say a wrong word but what it means is you'll keep coming back you'll come back for renewing you'll come back for a fresh anointing amen come back for renewed faith amen why doesn't look just that one little mistake is that you're not patient though the fact you are patient shows you keep coming back to God say God forgive me I want to keep waiting amen it's always that way we obey God's Word we have this test this battle of patience I'm gonna keep being faithful I'm gonna keep believing God's Word I'm gonna keep investing in the things of God because I know the promise is on the way hallelujah how about you play yes I'm really okay wonderful yeah just play that buddy steadfast this [Music] is the time to see all my I like to see my parents a message things I like to see so this is a [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]

some years are dragging it's just I just a great example our God is greater we do our part we faithfully keep God's keep God's Word be patient in between and the word is gonna come to pass just
