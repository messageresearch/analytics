[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] like to preach on part five of biblical numerology tonight go to Genesis chapter 18 by God's grace verse 23 let's look at the number 6 tonight by God's grace again this is part 5 of the series biblical numerology this is 19 verse 23 I think it's very striking that you'll find Abraham interceded for a lot not one time not two not three not four not five but six times Abraham intercedes for lot I think tonight you know we've you've often heard that the number six is the number of men and it's generally almost spoken of in a negative term but in fact in the scripture I find more positive sixes referring to the anointed man of God and I'd find negative number sixes and I think I'll prove that to you tonight of course through the scripture not me but the scripture proving that to us tonight and I hope you're ready to hear God's Word I want you to know also and I brother have to talk about this as number six being a good number and I'll show it to you at the end of the message by God's grace well we'll try to end with that one so Genesis 18 23 and Abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked peradventure there be 50 righteous within the city will also destroy 50 righteous therein I remember jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall be in the days of the coming of the Son of man so this is a day where we've got to keep praying for our loved ones that are in Sodom and I'm sure at home you can raise your hand and say well I have a lot of friends or a lot of a lot of family members that are in spiritual Sodom let's keep praying for them let's ask six times let's ask more let's ask as many times as we possibly can I want you to see here that stuff the father of the faith prayed six times interesting than six times for Abraham verse 25 that be far from being to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked and be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right and the Lord said if I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city then I will spare all the place for their sakes and Abraham answered and said behold now I have taken upon me to speak under the Lord and in but dust and ashes look at the humility of Abraham oh we must humble ourselves when we pray verse 28 / venture there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for the lack of five and he said if I find there forty and five I will not destroy it notice how many did he go down by 5 which is Grace he goes 5 5 then 10 10 10 I'm sorry 5 5 5 10 10 10 next in verse 20 nine and he's faking to him yet again and cent per venture there should be forty found there and he said I will not do it for forty sick and he said unto him Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak per venture there shall be thirty be found there and he said I will not do it if I find thirty there so I'm from 50 45 40 thirty so I'm sorry it was five five ten ten and one more ten I think he said to him I'm sorry verse 31 he said behold now I've taken up upon me to speak in the Lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said I will not destroy it for twenty see they said oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak at this once per venture ten shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for ten sake the Lord went his way as soon as he had left community with Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place hey God has blessings arena was worried maybe see when I can look at this thought here tonight and trust me the blessing to you as I said on Sunday I was thoroughly thoroughly blessed by studying this message because it really opened my eyes you know I've heard you know I've joked in the past I've heard people joke and say oh there's a there's a six in someone's life and and there's usually a negative connotation along with that six that as I study the scripture I find more good sixes than bad sixes and so will look at this and that I can find that there's three meetings for a six in the Bible the first one has fallen man or fallen beast those kind of go together because they're both fallen and they're both created on the sixth day the one that surprised me that I feel like I have more support for is anointed man in other words anointed of the Holy Ghost I find more sixes that are four anointed holy go men or women than I do for fallen men at least up to this point I still have to read the remainder of that chapter from Bollinger on number six in the Bible and also we won't have time for this one tonight but six is also a way to measure time if you think about you know 24 hours 60 minutes and you see how time and there's there's 12 and 6 is all throughout the day so 16 seems to be a number that measures time as well of course 7 and we know other numbers 30 and so forth but 6 is often used with time so we won't get to that one today but let's get to these the first 2 we're trying to get to falling man and beast and then anointed man by God's grace so the Prophet tells us in 1961 Revelation chapter 5 part 2 he says 5 is a number of grace 6 is the man's day and 7 is his day of redemption so he against says how hey so let's turn it off with the man's day and 1930s and 144,000 he said let he that has wisdom count the numbers of the man count the numbers of the Beast for it the number of a man and his number is 666 so brother man types or he shows how the mark of the beast has a 666 and he shows the negative side of 6 how if you have 3 sixes it equals the number of the Antichrist his interesting he's called a beast spiritually but of course we know the natural beasts were created on the sixth day as well and we know of course for the RAM said any man without the Holy Ghost is nothing but a brute beast in other words he's living by his fleshly sinful instincts and he's no better than a beast right we know immoral women and moral men are so low the prophet tells us nothing could be lower than an immoral woman because of all the evil that poverty especially sexually awful and morale as well so let's look at a few things here we're not as we did last few weeks we're not going to read every scripture but the ones I feel like it might be beneficial we'll stop and read those by God's grace so in Genesis 1 24 to 31 on the sixth day of creation God created beasts cattle creeping things and then he brought forth man and created man in God's image with dominion over all the earth over all the beasts so both both beast and man are created on the sixth day next in Genesis 31 41 Jacob a man serves Laban six years for cattle which is interesting because Caddo is made on the sixth day and we know this was of course a part of the time this was before Jacob had the wrestling experience and this was a struggle for Jacob a number later he said Laban he said has changed my wages ten times we get to Ted later on as we preach on that so this was not an easy time for Jacob this was a hard time so this shows the Fallen nature of man Jacob having to work six years for cattle in Exodus chapter 20 verse 11 God says six days four men will be work days so there's the fall of man has to work six days but of course God because God made the earth and heaven in six days and he rested on the seventh but notice God God the anointed man because the Bible says God's a man of war work six days so this could be a positive number as well because God in His glory God in his perfection for six days made perfect creation for six days so that can be a positive number as well man was not fallen of course in the first six days because he fell on the seventh so that can be a good number as well can represent the anointed God always eternally anointed God and also the anointed man so we want to make that sure that that's a number that's a good one a good example for six as well and of course is program sent revelation 13:18 the number of the beast it is the number of a man so we have beast and man connected with the mark of the beast 666 which we know represents vicarious affiliate day I'm saying that right but the vicar of God's Son so we know it's going to be the Pope will have the mark of the beast now let's move on that Exodus 21 verse 2 6 years a Hebrew servant would serve but on the seventh he would go out free for nothing so six years of service that represents fallen man but in the midst of that God said your Hebrew servant was worth double than any other servant because he was Hebrew he was one of God's and he was in the Covenant circumcision waters of separation he said you should let him go out in the seventh year let his wife let his children go with him because he was worth double blessing unto you so that shows also I've got loved Israel so much for those 6 years of service God never withdrew his love even though the people may have lost their freedoms or the privileges God always loved them and God would bless them those Hebrew service in in Leviticus 25 verse 3 they Israel had 6 years to sow in their field and prune their vineyard and gather the fruit but they had to rest on the 7 so they had six days in the week and then 6 years to work and the seventh they would arrest and the Bible said now listen here's another good one for the Bible said the blessing was commanded on the sixth year to bring forth for the seventh as well he meant so see 6 is not always a bad number it can be a good number God put a double blessing on the sixth year of farming or agriculture amen now in proverbs I forgot to write down the scripture in Proverbs but it says there are six things the Lord hates so here's fallen man now we'll get to a fallen man 7 our abomination to him so I don't know I don't know which six I don't know if it's the first six or the last six are the ones that he hates but as he was like sixty eight and seven are abomination so I'm not sure how to explain that anyways the first one is a proud look the second one a lying tongue the third is hands that shed innocent blood fourth is a heart that devises wicked imaginations five his feet that swiftly run to mission six is a false witness speaking lies and seventh is sowing discord among the Brethren a guy hates all that gate six and then said unto him okay next again with fallen man it took Joab six months to slay all the male eita mites which were Esau's a sentence in first Kings 1116 so there's again fallen man slaying other male for six months now that's it for the Old Testament now we go to the new now that I could find and that's just typing in 6 or 6 or 5 1 2 3 4 and in the Bible concordance and just going all the way through that's all I could find for six negatives in the hotel now in the New Testament we see fallen man because it was about the sixth hour on the preparation of the Passover when Pilate presented Jesus before the Jews and said behold your king and they all cried away with him crucify him in John chapter 19 hapax our Sun around 6 so there was darkness from the sixth hour to the ninth hour when Christ was crucified so as the darkness started on the 6:00 hour that shows darkness on fallen man who have rejected the Savior and here's the last one that I can the last negative I can find for fallen man with number six is the sixth seal and it's interesting I don't know if you ever caught this but the sixth seal lists six things that are gonna happen during the tribulation at least six I was shocked to see that this week the first thing is a great earthquake the second thing the Sun becomes black the third thing the moon becomes as blood before things stars will fall to the earth when that as large as stars are imagine a star striking earth can could imagine that your stars usually much bigger than the years so I can't understand that but number 5 heaven departs as a scroll so that heavens went apart is a scroll and 6 lastly every mountain and island will move out of their places I'll be so shaken they'll move out of their places so that my friends is the end of fallen man on sixes so there wasn't too much I've only been preaching a few minutes that's not too much the rest of these are good sixes are anointed men or the anointing of the Holy Spirit on a man praise God so let's go back to the Old Testament the first anointed man we see is Adam on day 6 when he was created he's a perfect man brother branham said Adam was perfect he was a Holy Ghost anointed man because brother man said he had a holy veil on and we realized that everything was holy he couldn't be deceived so Saint had to go to the woman of course incarnate the serpent and that's what the Bible says the Eve was beguiled and to see but Adam was not in the transgression so we had this holy veil but when he sinned and willingly sinned the whole email left him and we saw in Genesis 18 Abraham interceded 6 times for a lot why 6 because he had the anointing upon him and he was going to save a just man right lot was a just man God would not slay the righteous with the wicked he was a righteous man I was thinking about this this week as well Noah was a righteous man the Bible said Noah walked with God and he got drunk I was thinking about some of our friends you know the past all this I was thinking about friends and family members have passed on they might be then they might get drunk at times you know they might do evil things but we know there's still hope perhaps God could save them they won't be in the bride it won't be in the wise virgins by the grace of God they could be in the foolish virgin but whatever had been six times because he was an anointed man interceding for these lost souls he said that there be fifty spare the city and he got it down to 10 and God couldn't find 10 we know how many found he found three he found three so because God found less than ten he destroyed Sodom God will never destroy the righteous with the wicked that's what Abraham says so we understand that okay now Exodus 16 verse 5 and verse 29 the sixth day of manna would be twice as much to cover the seventh so just like we saw with farmers the six year was a double blessing so it was with the manna on the way to the promised land a sixth day would be a double blessing so C was an extra blessing so six day was a bad day it was actually a day of extra grace it was actually a extra blessing to Israel in Exodus 20 for six days the glory of the Lord in a cloud covered Mount Sinai for six days they got to see the glory of God as a cloud but on the seventh God called Moses out of the midst of the cloud so most of Moses was caught up into the cloud on the seventh day and stayed there forty days and forty nights but for the six days all the congregation beheld the glory of the Lord amen now it's interesting the Bible says this six branches came out of the one candlestick of the menorah or the candlestick which is interesting so one of them represented the center of it but then the Bible says six came out and notice all six were overlaid with what gold deity the anointing the Holy Spirit and of course we know these ties [Music] was this in a good way the anointed manner in this case the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon six an offset interchanges but it specifically calls out six which is interesting I wonder to mean I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just presuming but it seems like the Ephesus age was the age that was most on fire to God they had the first love so it seemed like Ephesus would be the foundational age that would be the age that we all tried to attend to right but then all six are still annoying too but six come out from that one Todd Lee that's how it must be taught through the scripture to understand that other six branches differentiated from the other one the seventh by God's grace now interesting Aaron Warren ephod over shoulders owns one each stroller had six name so here he goes he's anointed right if he said go the Friends of God he's got to be anointed and he's got two sixes on his shoulders two sixes as he goes the prints of guns he's got twelve on his breastplate but there's two sixes on him he's an anointed man in the service of the Lord and each stone had six of the names of the tribes of Israel on it and then the twelve stones each stone had one of the names of the twelve tribes on it and that's an exodus chapter 28 verses 8 to 12 this is God's were not we're not making this up this is God's holy word God anoints men with sixes praise God Howard we're not even close to being done with the Old Testament the shewbread was in two rows of six on the table two sixes right two sixes made twelve twelve his governmental perfection as we'll see later on the government there's twelve tribes there be twelve apostles ruling over the 12 tribes of Israel so shewbread was in two rows now remember shewbread was always supposed to be hot it was always supposed to be fresh as shewbread would be placed on the Sabbath and as soon as the twelve fresh ones went down the priest eight to twelve old ones in the Pens of God and God called this my bread amen this was God's bread this was God's offering unto Him and God always promised that fresh bread but his in two groups of six that's right Church did you know there were six cities of refuge where men who were unawares of killing someone could flee among the cities of the Levites amen and notice there was three on the side of Jordan and three on the side of Canaan praise God and that's in numbers 35 verse 6 and verse 14 so six cities of refuge because six is the number of man it was we'd say a protection for man right because they could be protected in the city of refuge and we know the name of the Lord is like a strong tower the righteous run into it and they're saved Amen so they had a we'd say an anointing or protection of their lives if they accidentally killed someone God made a way that they could be protected amen so six it was not a bad number six was a good number praise God in Deuteronomy 16 verse 8 during the feast of unleavened bread humming oh how many days they ate they ate for six days six days they ate unleavened bread for the feast and the seventh was a solemn assembly so for six days you sat at your home I'm going to them God eating unleavened bread on their seventh you all everybody went to church and gathered at the church so the six days of enjoying no leaven no sin in your house for six days Oh let that be a sweet anointing came ahead hallelujah and that's what I represented six days with no leaven no sin see the anointed man seen through all these types and shadows praise God Joshua compass Jericho for six days in a row compass in the city once and then returning to the camp for six days in a row where does that represent something back no that represents something good that represents that God that they were anointed because remember they just got recently circumcised and washed clean amen they just followed the arc over Jordan which represents the baptism of the holy ghost so these six days represented anointed men consecrated men going around Jericho six times but on the seventh the trumpets blowed on the seventh praise God amen Ruth was given six measures of barley by Boaz because we know Jesus Boaz was the seventh right but he gave her six so six was going to show that the anointing or the blessing of Boaz was going to be upon the Gentile and the Jew Ruth the dead top Naomi the Jew there we go Laurie and Boaz said rest and of course and rest and they always had rest until Boaz finishes the work praise God this was going to be six days or six measures of blessing until Boaz finished it and then he was the seventh measure he would take care of her the rest of their days amen did you know this David when he actually did got a service the right way with the ark back on their shoulders every six steps look two four five every six steps they would sacrifice oxen every time after 6 because 6 was a number of an anointed man because now David's he still shout and he still rejoice it he's given God praise with all of his night but he's gonna stop every six steps to show that he's anointed and they're gonna sacrifice and make sacrifices under God every six steps praise God I don't know if you do this but in Solomon's Temple he had six steps up to the throne not seven six and there was six Lions on each side which represented one which gives us twelve lines in two groups of six so again remember the shewbread two groups are six here beating up to chose an anointed temple and anointed king king solomon with sixes and twelves brings the Lord after we see two more groups of six Esther was purified six months of oil and myrrh that was the first six the second six is purification with sweet odours and other things for purification so she went through a year of purification when it was divided up into two sixes so this is not Esther being evil this is Esther being cleanse this is Esther being anointed by the by the natural oils and MERS right which is a type of the spiritual praise God the seraphim's had six wings two of them cover their face for reverence to cover their feet for their walk and then two that were flying for action for their action for the holy spirit and these were connected to the anointing as well because the seraphim's in Isaiah chapter six brought a coal from the fire of God and it touched Isaiah's lips and his lips were cleansed amen so see it represents the anointing of God these six wings bring down the anointing of God and it relates a filthy man and it makes him clean so he can go forth and speak God's Word to God's people hey man it's an anointed man let's read this one let's go to number six 23 and 24 number six twenty-three twenty-four sorry I haven't called you earlier numbers I see number six 23 and 24 number six 23 and 24 alright letting go to read 23 Malachi 3 24 manera notices this was steady flows - under is your own singing good Lord bless thee and keep the Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall put my name upon the Turner of Israel and I will bless them did you count how many times that God was gonna bless them six times if they stayed faithful in the promised land God was gonna give them a six fold blessing he would bless them he would keep them he would shine upon them he would have grace upon them his countenance would be upon them and then they would have peace amen beautiful hallelujah the c6 is often a blessing remember we saw with the manna the blessing was on double blessing on the sixth memory saw was the six year double blessing on the sixth there's such a connection between sixes and blessings six represents a man who is anointed it can represent a man but it can also represent a man annoying today men well let's go to Daniel chapter 9 here's what I preached about three years ago Gabriel visited Daniel in Daniel chapter 9 and who remembers how many purposes that he did he visit for six the six fold purpose of Daniels visit so Daniel 9:24 brother Branham preached this on July 30th 1961 he called it Gabriel's instructions to Daniel and Lily can you read verse 24 for be heard reconciliation for iniquity in two previous provision in the practice ea6 whole purpose and the last one is to anoint the most holy amen so let's read what I taught last time this is from the revelation I got through reading brother Branham sir the first purpose is to finish the transgression program said take away the blindness of Israel and graph Israel back in that's the first purpose lioness causes transgression so it is also the turning away or finishing up up the Gentiles that was the first purpose of game or coming to tell Daniel about that the second purpose was to make an end of all sins and brother have said this is Israel's sin or unbelief literally ends when Jesus appears physically to the 140 because won't this believeth actually see the literal Savior Jesus Christ and this is tied by Joseph revealing himself to his brothers lorry the third purpose is to make reconciliation for iniquity Israel's iniquity is purged or pardoned on the one day according Isaiah 66 verse 8 in which they aren't born again so this is how reconciliation is made from iniquity the Holy Ghost is the Ministry of reconciliation according to second Corinthians 5:18 through 21 number we're supposed to be ambassadors of the reconciliation that God has given to him and his people praise God the fourth purpose is to bring in everlasting righteousness the thousand-year millennium is the time of righteousness when the glory of the Lord will fill the earth say influence anyone in the Millennium this is not eternal righteousness just 1000 years remember Satan comes out at the end of this thousand years and he gathers up by sin and unbelief and brings an army against the holy city so it's not eternal it's just everlasting righteousness from red tells us fifth reason Gabriel visited was to seal up the vision and prophecy which Gabriel came to seal up the understanding of this vision and prophecy from Israel and everyone else until the end time so gate run to come and tell seal this up to the end time but whose had been unsealed to to Jesus and bride Amen the bride of Jesus Christ through the preaching of the seven seals that God gave to brother Branham and of course it will be unveiled also to the 144,000 through the ministries of Moses and Elijah remember the seventh messenger would finish the mystery of God to the Gentiles if you keep reading the rest of the chapter because this booklet this open book was supposed to be eaten by John and then prophesied to people's tongues multitudes nations amen lastly the sixth and final thing what is it to anoint the most holy so brother said the Millennial temple must be anointed for the millennial reign according to Ezekiel 43 verses 1 to 6 after fire purifies the earth and we walk out on the ashes of the wicked according to Malachi 4:1 through 3 so what did I what did I try to tell you I to say number 6 represents anointed man and here the sixth purpose the sixth and final purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel is to tell him the most holy must be anointed God's earthly Tabernacle must be anointed here when he starts the Millenium Amen praise God s'okay hope you can see it tonight by God's grace on six represents anointed man alright now he ignores a new testament see we haven't got to the New Testament with the the good sixes and their boy they're sure a lot of good ones here as well this one was a real blessing to me in Luke 1:26 and 36 it was in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist that Gabriel visited Mary and that's interesting he visited Daniel with a six fold purpose and now he visits Elizabeth or certain IV visits Mary in the six month of John the Baptist pregnancy I'm sorry Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist and brother Branham said life came into John as six months or the holy ghost' anointing let me read this from paradox 1964 Elizabeth said that she was kind of worried she said because it's been six months now and the baby hasn't moved that's irregular see baby is practically what we call today then see as good as then in his mother's womb six months and it troubled her and you know John was six months older than Jesus which was his second cousin Mary and Elizabeth were first cousins in perservere of 64 my mom said and just as soon as that human name of God Jesus was spoke by a mortal limb of a human being a dead baby come to life in the womb of a woman and receive the Holy Ghost amen and if that will do that to a baby dead in the mother's womb what ought to do to a barn again turn what off the name of Jesus do to us tonight amen it ought to set us on fire amen it ought to revive us and I'll anoint this just to hear the name of Jesus Christ preached there saying because it's such a glorious name the name of Jesus now I can't prove by the Bible that John the Baptist was dead but I can prove by the Bible that John the Baptist got anointed when Mary spoke the name of Jesus for the first time any minute who the Bible said he's the Bible said he leaped and he was filled with the Holy Ghost from that moment on amen of course that was in the human realm or the spiritual realm of the mind of the human spirit we'd say so hope everybody can see that the anointing came upon John the Baptist in the six month not v not the seventh the six month praise God all right in John chapter 2 Jesus first miracle changed six water pots of water into wine why not more six six and we also know that Christ he represented the seventh water pot right the station of Christ's glory was deception and we're also going to see his manifestation of his glory and another wedding reception the marriage supper of the Lamb maybe her gonna see a mighty glorious thing there praise God hallelujah we'll have communion with our Lord and he'll drink again we're gonna see that great manifestation of an eating of the bread and drinking of the wine drinking of the fruit of this vine at the marriage supper of the Lamb praise God and this shows us that the best wine is shared to the end so we'd say the greatest revelation of God's Word is saved to the end this age when all the mysteries of God are finished hallelujah praise the Lord amen six waterpots and he was the seventh praise God so seven anointed water pots they're so annoying that they went from water to hey then did you know it was six days before the Passover that Mary anointed Jesus feet with upon appointment and spikenard he was anointed six days before and also Mary God anointed six days and four see how the number six represents the anointing upon a man praise God everybody see that Oh glory there's always these anointings and sixes all right the four living creatures are cherubims they each had six wings right according to revelation 4:8 and what do they represent those four I presenting the four anointings on the church throughout the entire church ages because they had to combat the four horse riders so they have six wings but they're representing the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon four groups during the church ages amen and we're supposed to have the anointing of the flying eagle praise God the five bug denominations Creed's and all the worldliness of this day this wicked labor scene age is blind miserable wretched Laodicea eggs were supposed to fly above that and be genuine Holy Ghost filled Christians anointed with the Spirit of God amen six weeks hallelujah all right oh yeah I kind of skipped ahead a little bit so part of me back in John chapter four verse six Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the sixth hour so her her sins and her her situation her her discernment came about the sixth hour so God God had the gift of the Son of Man discern the Samaritans about the sixth hour so that represents the anointed man and members she already had five husbands and she was living with six so is that the six hour God revealed her six awful husbands was showing that Christ would be her seventh and last one amen so the anointing came to deliver her from her oh and mine so annoyed her she ran down to the city it almost all this city believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah such a mighty anointing about the sixth hour hallelujah praise the Lord in Acts chapter 10 Peter went to pray about the sixth hour on the top of his roof and that's when he saw the vision of the sheet coming down with the unclean animals when did it happen about the six hours about noon he went to pray about noon and that represents of course a vision would have to come from what the anointing of the Holy Spirit so again six represents the anointing the sixth hour the anointing came down and Peter saw a vision on the 6:00 hour praise God how many men were on Mount of Transfiguration six there was three that were theophany or there would've been the outfit for Moses Elijah in Christ and there was three who were still in their human bodies Peter James and John now they were in a vision and in order to see a vision you've got to be anointed with the Holy Ghost amen so again six represents man anointed how many raptures are there there are six there's six times gods are going to saw anoint man that they don't have to die and they could go straight to heaven amen hallelujah by God's grace will be a part of that one even the fifth one will be a part of by God's grace amen will be a part of the fifth out of six raptures I always wondered why there are six raptures never I preached it I saw maybe there's seven maybe there's eight maybe I'll find that but actually we stay with six that's a good representation because it represents an anointed man and woman to cheat death and go and meet Christ in the air at the rapture Amen hallelujah inna the first rapture Elijah the second Jesus only to the Father the third Jesus leading captivity captive the fourth the fifth the Gentile bride and six the two prophets of Revelation chapter 11 amen now this is one that I mentioned recently but we want to remember this how many pieces of armor does the full armor Christian have on six the first is loins Girt about with truth and remember Peter said gird up the loins of your mind so this is a mind that is just going to believe truth that's why we got to read our Bibles that's why you want to read those acts of the Prophet books that we gave up that's why we want to always have your mind on the word thank you go over they've been preached a few weeks ago you're ready to move and fight for the kingdom of God and you can also slip your sword in there if you need to but of course if you got your sore point out you're ready to fight and slay as well second you have the breastplate of righteousness your heart is covered over your heart is covered by the righteousness of Christ it's no longer you doing it in your heart but Christ giving you a new heart they met breastplate of righteousness you do right because you love Christ third your feet are shod with the gospel of the preparation of peace the anointing of God is on your feet you're ready to go and do your willing to drop everything and go help someone by the grace of God because the gospel is upon your feet for if you have the shield of faith that's the fourth thing and you're able to quench every fiery dart every lie from hell you can the fifth is the helping us combination you attack your salvation you it's just blocked because you know you're saying you know you did what Peter said you repented have been baptized and you're saying Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins praise God you know you're saying you follow God's plan for salvation and 6 and finally you've got the sword of the Spirit in your hand you're ready to use the Word of God now what does a person who's anointed like this what does the Bible say they do first he said first praying always with all prayer and supplication the spirit to see when you're full related with all the parts of armor what do you do you're ready to pray for somebody if you don't feel like praying if you don't feel like you're ready ready to pray you got to get anointed you gotta be come under the anointed man 90 and get all six parts ready your mind your heart your salvation right your sword your faith you've got to get all these things build up anointed with all these six things now you're ready to pray amen that's beautiful six has got to be a great number because our cert six church age messenger was John Wesley a mighty man of God who's gonna say six is a bad number on that one he's one of the most gifted preachers I think he was up every morning at 4 a.m. he was preaching by 5 a.m. on almost every morning of his life after he got nothing he's Davis and he got saved around 32 or not mistaken 32 and 35 once he found his his message of sanctification he was up preaching that early he was the sixth church age messenger praise God and I believe him I'm not mistaken he was under the omit and the anointing of the man age I just came fresh ain't never I did that said he preached that somewhere else would be a blessing to the the Saints there he was under the man anointing won't let me bring up a keyboard I wonder why not not sure okay so I need to make can you write that down for me and we got a piece of paper write that down that he was in relief man oh he can use right now and just put it up here when you're ready I'm just gonna go through the paper just scribble that on there say John Weston was under the man anointing because six represents the the anointing of a man that's not just him thank you that's a good thought I want to lose that that came fresh fresh right now I believed by God's grace okay I'm coming down to close here coming down to close let me do a few more things I want to go down to the Ministry of brother branham now last week we show now there is five times a third pull operated see if I can remember them the first two times were squirrels in a new existence a third time was had he right speaking to the storm and then meet his tumors there's the five I never knew this but who knows how many times or how many squirrels the brother branham speaking in existence six three the first time and three the second time it's so striking the first time was in September of he was 1959 he spoke three squirrels in existence in Jeffersonville the next time was in November of 1959 in Kentucky and brother Brad said these six would be God confirming my ministry on the third pole amen so he knew these six squirrels would confirm his ministry in the third Pole now to me it's also confirmation of God's anointed prophet because 6 represents the anointed man anointed the Holy Spirit let me redo these quotes here so you can understand where I got this so this is the story from my new ministry November 15th 1959 this is the story where brother Branham says 6 is the number of anointed man he doesn't use those exact words but as I told you he said let this be a confirmation of my ministry so 6 was going to be a confirmation of his anointed ministry I want you to see this when he spoke all 6 squirrels he said he had a super anointing on him and that beautiful a super anointing he in other words had an anointing on an anointed man to speak 6 squirrels into existence amen thank you okay so programs that I started into the woods and the squirrels upon the ground and I started up into the woods and something said to me how many squirrels do you want this morning I said well I've got 117 this year if I had three more and make it 120 that would just make an even number to stop on and I said and another thing it would give me six to take home so brother may have already on three but the holy sprit asks on how many more and he said I like three more for six to take home which I love them better than any meat there is to eat so squirmy must be really tasty and I said if I could just get three more Lord and I walked on up through the woods a little further and oh there was none good hunters like Charlie then got one and I said well hide something said to me say to it speak the three squirrels and you'll have it I this is what he's in Kentucky a little treatment of a Ridge and that anointing listen that anointing came so great so I could hardly stand on the ground so see this is an anointed man hope everybody can see that the anointing comes on him a man to speak three more squirrels so you have a total of six that anointing comes so great I could hardly stay on the ground said said speak what you say don't doubt and you can have what you said I said I shall get three squirrels he said where will they come from I said one will come from that way one from that way and one back this way I said I make it radical God don't care how radical that it seems he's got a circumstance okay now he's already shot two and he keeps having trouble with the third now he says now surely Lord you won't let me miss after I've already said under the anointing that this would be and you're confirming my ministry this will be six times that you confirmed it to me the number of man six times I said you won't let me miss him so God brother has basically recording God's promise back to him saying you told me I wouldn't miss you told me I get 6 because 6 is the number of man - and I need a confirmation I'm a man I need a confirmation of 6 so of course we know it was a super anointing that came upon it he said I looked up on down the tree and way up there I thought I had seen some leaves I've seen something moving in it and I raised and shot and the squirrel dropped to the ground stone dead up the hill I went rejoicing and happy see rejoice on the 6th he was anointed rejoicing on the 6th squirrel I went to the first tree over to my left and there laid the squirrel praise God so with that I think I finish up all the positive examples for let me close with this last one in second Samuel 21 verse 20 here Satan's imitation of six so I ended the other sermons by showing Satan's imitation here's the one imitation where Satan tries to use a6 to intimidate the people of God in 2nd Samuel 21 verse 21 of Goliath sons had six fingers and six toes on both hands and feet so here's Satan somehow the genetic code something happened and Goliath son is trying to intimidate them and the way intimidates them other than being big is he's got six fingers on this hand 6 on that hand six toes six toes there see God's design was for a double 5 5 and 10 15 20 double grace but this speaks of double grace upon our hands and also upon our feet our walk and our works should speak of double grace like the head so that comes down shouting grace grace double grace but Satan tried to imitate that and he tried to intimidate the people of Israel by putting six six six and another six but we know what happened david's mighty men slew that son of goliath by the grace of god amen i hope that's been a blessing let's let's just get to the music here let's close up with that by God's grace so Mack I will just come here racing it Church I hope that was a blessing to you to see the sixes I know if you're like me Church I know you want to be anointed six can be a tremendous number six is the full
