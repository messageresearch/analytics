[34:06] like to preach on part five of biblical
[34:09] numerology tonight go to Genesis chapter
[34:12] 18 by God's grace verse 23 let's look at
[34:18] the number 6 tonight by God's grace
[34:20] again this is part 5 of the series
[34:23] biblical numerology this is 19 verse 23
[34:31] I think it's very striking that you'll
[34:42] find Abraham interceded for a lot not
[34:45] one time not two not three not four not
[34:47] five but six times
[34:49] Abraham intercedes for lot I think
[34:53] tonight you know we've you've often
[34:54] heard that the number six is the number
[34:57] of men and it's generally almost spoken
[35:00] of in a negative term but in fact in the
[35:03] scripture I find more positive sixes
[35:05] referring to the anointed man of God and
[35:09] I'd find negative number sixes and I
[35:11] think I'll prove that to you tonight
[35:13] of course through the scripture not me
[35:15] but the scripture proving that to us
[35:17] tonight and I hope you're ready to hear
[35:20] God's Word I want you to know also and I
[35:23] brother have to talk about this as
[35:25] number six being a good number and I'll
[35:27] show it to you at the end of the message
[35:29] by God's grace well we'll try to end
[35:32] with that one
[35:32] so Genesis 18 23 and Abraham drew near
[35:39] and said wilt thou also destroy the
[35:40] righteous with the wicked peradventure
[35:43] there be 50 righteous within the city
[35:45] will also destroy 50 righteous therein I
[35:52] remember jesus said as it was in the
[35:54] days of lot so shall be in the days of
[35:57] the coming of the Son of man so this is
[35:59] a day where we've got to keep praying
[36:00] for our loved ones that are in Sodom and
[36:03] I'm sure at home you can raise your hand
[36:05] and say well I have a lot of friends or
[36:07] a lot of a lot of family members that
[36:08] are in spiritual Sodom
[36:10] let's keep praying for them let's ask
[36:12] six times let's ask more let's ask as
[36:15] many times as we possibly can I want you
[36:17] to see here that stuff the father of the
[36:19] faith prayed six times interesting than
[36:22] six times for Abraham verse 25 that be
[36:26] far from being to do after this manner
[36:28] to slay the righteous with the wicked
[36:30] and that the righteous should be as the
[36:32] wicked and be far from thee shall not
[36:36] the judge of all the earth do right and
[36:40] the Lord said if I find in Sodom 50
[36:42] righteous within the city then I will
[36:44] spare all the place for their sakes and
[36:48] Abraham answered and said behold now I
[36:50] have taken upon me to speak under the
[36:52] Lord and in but dust and ashes look at
[36:55] the humility of Abraham
[36:56] oh we must humble ourselves when we pray
[36:59] verse 28 / venture there shall lack five
[37:02] of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy
[37:04] all the city for the lack of five and he
[37:08] said if I find there forty and five I
[37:10] will not destroy it notice how many did
[37:13] he go down by 5 which is Grace he goes 5
[37:17] 5 then 10 10 10
[37:20] I'm sorry 5 5 5 10 10 10 next in verse
[37:25] 20
[37:27] nine and he's faking to him yet again
[37:30] and cent per venture there should be
[37:31] forty found there and he said I will not
[37:34] do it for forty sick and he said unto
[37:37] him
[37:37] Oh let not the Lord be angry and I will
[37:40] speak per venture there shall be thirty
[37:42] be found there and he said I will not do
[37:45] it if I find thirty there so I'm from 50
[37:47] 45 40 thirty so I'm sorry it was five
[37:50] five ten ten and one more ten I think he
[37:54] said to him I'm sorry verse 31 he said
[37:57] behold now I've taken up upon me to
[37:59] speak in the Lord peradventure there
[38:01] shall be twenty found there and he said
[38:03] I will not destroy it for twenty see
[38:04] they said oh let not the Lord be angry
[38:06] and I will speak at this once per
[38:09] venture ten shall be found there and he
[38:10] said I will not destroy it for ten sake
[38:13] the Lord went his way as soon as he had
[38:16] left community with Abraham and Abraham
[38:18] returned unto his place hey God has
[38:21] blessings arena was worried maybe see
[38:36] when I can look at this thought here
[38:39] tonight and trust me the blessing to you
[38:40] as I said on Sunday I was thoroughly
[38:43] thoroughly blessed by studying this
[38:46] message because it really opened my eyes
[38:49] you know I've heard you know I've joked
[38:51] in the past I've heard people joke and
[38:52] say oh there's a there's a six in
[38:55] someone's life and and there's usually a
[38:58] negative connotation along with that six
[39:01] that as I study the scripture I find
[39:03] more good sixes than bad sixes and so
[39:06] will look at this and that I can find
[39:10] that there's three meetings for a six in
[39:15] the Bible the first one has fallen man
[39:19] or fallen beast those kind of go
[39:21] together because they're both fallen and
[39:24] they're both created on the sixth day
[39:27] the one that surprised me that I feel
[39:30] like I have more support for is anointed
[39:33] man in other words anointed of the Holy
[39:36] Ghost I find more sixes that are four
[39:39] anointed holy go
[39:40] men or women than I do for fallen men at
[39:45] least up to this point I still have to
[39:47] read the remainder of that chapter from
[39:49] Bollinger on number six in the Bible and
[39:54] also we won't have time for this one
[39:55] tonight but six is also a way to measure
[39:59] time if you think about you know 24
[40:02] hours 60 minutes and you see how time
[40:08] and there's there's 12 and 6 is all
[40:10] throughout the day
[40:11] so 16 seems to be a number that measures
[40:14] time as well of course 7 and we know
[40:17] other numbers 30 and so forth but 6 is
[40:20] often used with time so we won't get to
[40:24] that one today but let's get to these
[40:26] the first 2 we're trying to get to
[40:28] falling man and beast and then anointed
[40:31] man by God's grace so the Prophet tells
[40:34] us in 1961 Revelation chapter 5 part 2
[40:37] he says 5 is a number of grace 6 is the
[40:41] man's day and 7 is his day of redemption
[40:45] so he against says how hey so let's turn
[40:52] it off with the man's day and 1930s and
[40:56] 144,000 he said let he that has wisdom
[40:59] count the numbers of the man count the
[41:01] numbers of the Beast for it the number
[41:03] of a man and his number is 666 so
[41:08] brother man types or he shows how the
[41:11] mark of the beast has a 666 and he shows
[41:14] the negative side of 6 how if you have 3
[41:16] sixes it equals the number of the
[41:18] Antichrist his interesting he's called a
[41:21] beast spiritually but of course we know
[41:24] the natural beasts were created on the
[41:26] sixth day as well and we know of course
[41:28] for the RAM said any man without the
[41:30] Holy Ghost is nothing but a brute beast
[41:32] in other words he's living by his
[41:33] fleshly sinful instincts and he's no
[41:36] better than a beast right we know
[41:38] immoral women and moral men are so low
[41:41] the prophet tells us nothing could be
[41:43] lower than an immoral woman because of
[41:46] all the evil that poverty especially
[41:51] sexually
[41:53] awful and
[41:55] morale as well so let's look at a few
[41:59] things here we're not as we did last few
[42:01] weeks we're not going to read every
[42:02] scripture but the ones I feel like it
[42:04] might be beneficial we'll stop and read
[42:05] those by God's grace so in Genesis 1 24
[42:09] to 31 on the sixth day of creation God
[42:12] created beasts cattle creeping things
[42:15] and then he brought forth man and
[42:18] created man in God's image with dominion
[42:20] over all the earth over all the beasts
[42:23] so both both beast and man are created
[42:26] on the sixth day next in Genesis 31 41
[42:31] Jacob a man serves Laban six years for
[42:36] cattle which is interesting because
[42:38] Caddo is made on the sixth day and we
[42:42] know this was of course a part of the
[42:44] time this was before Jacob had the
[42:45] wrestling experience and this was a
[42:47] struggle for Jacob a number later he
[42:51] said Laban he said has changed my wages
[42:53] ten times we get to Ted later on as we
[42:56] preach on that so this was not an easy
[42:58] time for Jacob this was a hard time so
[43:01] this shows the Fallen nature of man
[43:04] Jacob having to work six years for
[43:06] cattle in Exodus chapter 20 verse 11 God
[43:11] says six days four men will be work days
[43:15] so there's the fall of man has to work
[43:17] six days but of course God because God
[43:21] made the earth and heaven in six days
[43:24] and he rested on the seventh but notice
[43:28] God God the anointed man because the
[43:33] Bible says God's a man of war work six
[43:35] days so this could be a positive number
[43:38] as well because God in His glory God in
[43:40] his perfection for six days made perfect
[43:43] creation for six days so that can be a
[43:46] positive number as well man was not
[43:49] fallen of course in the first six days
[43:50] because he fell on the seventh so that
[43:54] can be a good number as well can
[43:57] represent the anointed God always
[43:59] eternally anointed God and also the
[44:01] anointed man so we want to make that
[44:03] sure that that's a number that's a good
[44:05] one a good example for six as well
[44:08] and of course is program sent revelation
[44:10] 13:18
[44:11] the number of the beast it is the number
[44:14] of a man so we have beast and man
[44:15] connected with the mark of the beast 666
[44:18] which we know represents vicarious
[44:20] affiliate day I'm saying that right but
[44:24] the vicar of God's Son so we know it's
[44:28] going to be the Pope will have the mark
[44:31] of the beast now let's move on that
[44:35] Exodus 21 verse 2 6 years a Hebrew
[44:39] servant would serve but on the seventh
[44:42] he would go out free for nothing so six
[44:45] years of service that represents fallen
[44:47] man but in the midst of that God said
[44:51] your Hebrew servant was worth double
[44:54] than any other servant because he was
[44:56] Hebrew he was one of God's and he was in
[44:58] the Covenant circumcision waters of
[45:00] separation he said you should let him go
[45:02] out in the seventh year let his wife let
[45:04] his children go with him because he was
[45:06] worth double blessing unto you so that
[45:09] shows also I've got loved Israel so much
[45:12] for those 6 years of service God never
[45:16] withdrew his love even though the people
[45:18] may have lost their freedoms or the
[45:20] privileges God always loved them and God
[45:22] would bless them those Hebrew service in
[45:26] in Leviticus 25 verse 3 they Israel had
[45:31] 6 years to sow in their field and prune
[45:34] their vineyard and gather the fruit but
[45:36] they had to rest on the 7 so they had
[45:39] six days in the week and then 6 years to
[45:41] work and the seventh they would arrest
[45:43] and the Bible said now listen here's
[45:45] another good one for the Bible said the
[45:47] blessing was commanded on the sixth year
[45:49] to bring forth for the seventh as well
[45:51] he meant so see 6 is not always a bad
[45:54] number it can be a good number God put a
[45:56] double blessing on the sixth year of
[45:59] farming or agriculture amen now in
[46:04] proverbs I forgot to write down the
[46:06] scripture in Proverbs but it says there
[46:08] are six things the Lord hates so here's
[46:10] fallen man now we'll get to a fallen man
[46:12] 7 our abomination to him so I don't know
[46:15] I don't know which six I don't know if
[46:17] it's the first six or the last six are
[46:19] the ones that he hates but as he was
[46:21] like sixty
[46:22] eight and seven are abomination so I'm
[46:25] not sure how to explain that anyways the
[46:27] first one is a proud look the second one
[46:29] a lying tongue
[46:30] the third is hands that shed innocent
[46:33] blood fourth is a heart that devises
[46:35] wicked imaginations five his feet that
[46:39] swiftly run to mission six is a false
[46:42] witness speaking lies and seventh is
[46:45] sowing discord among the Brethren a guy
[46:52] hates all that gate six
[46:54] and then said unto him okay next
[46:57] again with fallen man it took Joab six
[47:01] months to slay all the male eita mites
[47:04] which were Esau's a sentence in first
[47:06] Kings 1116 so there's again fallen man
[47:11] slaying
[47:12] other male for six months now
[47:15] that's it for the Old Testament now we
[47:16] go to the new now that I could find and
[47:18] that's just typing in 6 or 6 or 5 1 2 3
[47:22] 4 and in the Bible concordance and just
[47:24] going all the way through that's all I
[47:26] could find for six negatives in the
[47:29] hotel now in the New Testament we see
[47:32] fallen man because it was about the
[47:35] sixth hour on the preparation of the
[47:37] Passover when Pilate presented Jesus
[47:40] before the Jews and said behold your
[47:42] king and they all cried away with him
[47:44] crucify him in John chapter 19
[47:49] hapax our Sun around 6 so there was
[47:54] darkness from the sixth hour to the
[47:56] ninth hour when Christ was crucified
[47:58] so as the darkness started on the 6:00
[48:01] hour that shows darkness on fallen man
[48:04] who have rejected the Savior and here's
[48:09] the last one that I can the last
[48:10] negative I can find for fallen man with
[48:12] number six is the sixth seal and it's
[48:15] interesting I don't know if you ever
[48:16] caught this but the sixth seal lists six
[48:18] things that are gonna happen during the
[48:20] tribulation at least six I was shocked
[48:22] to see that this week the first thing is
[48:26] a great earthquake the second thing the
[48:27] Sun becomes black
[48:29] the third thing the moon becomes as
[48:31] blood before things stars will fall to
[48:34] the earth when that
[48:36] as large as stars are imagine a star
[48:39] striking earth can could imagine that
[48:41] your stars usually much bigger than the
[48:43] years so I can't understand that but
[48:46] number 5 heaven departs as a scroll
[48:49] so that heavens went apart is a scroll
[48:51] and 6 lastly every mountain and island
[48:55] will move out of their places I'll be so
[48:58] shaken they'll move out of their places
[49:01] so that my friends is the end of fallen
[49:06] man on sixes so there wasn't too much
[49:08] I've only been preaching a few minutes
[49:10] that's not too much the rest of these
[49:13] are good sixes are anointed men or the
[49:17] anointing of the Holy Spirit on a man
[49:20] praise God so let's go back to the Old
[49:23] Testament the first anointed man we see
[49:25] is Adam on day 6 when he was created
[49:28] he's a perfect man brother branham said
[49:30] Adam was perfect
[49:32] he was a Holy Ghost anointed man because
[49:34] brother man said he had a holy veil on
[49:36] and we realized that everything was holy
[49:38] he couldn't be deceived so Saint had to
[49:40] go to the woman of course incarnate the
[49:43] serpent and that's what the Bible says
[49:45] the Eve was beguiled and to see but Adam
[49:48] was not in the transgression so we had
[49:51] this holy veil but when he sinned and
[49:53] willingly sinned the whole email left
[49:55] him
[49:56] and we saw in Genesis 18 Abraham
[50:00] interceded 6 times for a lot why 6
[50:03] because he had the anointing upon him
[50:05] and he was going to save a just man
[50:06] right lot was a just man
[50:09] God would not slay the righteous with
[50:11] the wicked he was a righteous man I was
[50:14] thinking about this this week as well
[50:15] Noah was a righteous man the Bible said
[50:18] Noah walked with God and he got drunk I
[50:20] was thinking about some of our friends
[50:21] you know the past all this I was
[50:26] thinking about friends and family
[50:27] members have passed on they might be
[50:29] then they might get drunk at times you
[50:31] know they might do evil things but we
[50:34] know there's still hope perhaps God
[50:36] could save them they won't be in the
[50:38] bride it won't be in the wise virgins by
[50:41] the grace of God they could be in the
[50:43] foolish virgin
[50:45] but whatever had been six times because
[50:49] he was an anointed man interceding for
[50:51] these lost souls he said that there be
[50:53] fifty spare the city and he got it down
[50:57] to 10 and God couldn't find 10 we know
[50:59] how many found he found three he found
[51:01] three
[51:02] so because God found less than ten he
[51:06] destroyed Sodom God will never destroy
[51:10] the righteous with the wicked that's
[51:12] what Abraham says so we understand that
[51:16] okay now Exodus 16 verse 5 and verse 29
[51:22] the sixth day of manna would be twice as
[51:26] much to cover the seventh so just like
[51:29] we saw with farmers the six year was a
[51:31] double blessing so it was with the manna
[51:34] on the way to the promised land a sixth
[51:36] day would be a double blessing so C was
[51:39] an extra blessing so six day was a bad
[51:41] day it was actually a day of extra grace
[51:43] it was actually a extra blessing to
[51:46] Israel in Exodus 20 for six days the
[51:53] glory of the Lord in a cloud covered
[51:55] Mount Sinai for six days they got to see
[51:58] the glory of God as a cloud but on the
[52:01] seventh God called Moses out of the
[52:04] midst of the cloud so most of Moses was
[52:07] caught up into the cloud on the seventh
[52:09] day and stayed there forty days and
[52:12] forty nights but for the six days all
[52:15] the congregation beheld the glory of the
[52:17] Lord amen now it's interesting the Bible
[52:21] says this six branches came out of the
[52:24] one candlestick of the menorah or the
[52:28] candlestick which is interesting so one
[52:30] of them represented the center of it
[52:34] but then the Bible says six came out and
[52:38] notice all six were overlaid with what
[52:41] gold deity the anointing the Holy Spirit
[52:45] and of course we know these ties
[52:51] [Music]
[52:52] was this in a good way the anointed
[52:56] manner in this case the anointing of the
[52:57] Holy Spirit upon six an offset
[53:00] interchanges but it specifically calls
[53:03] out six which is interesting I wonder to
[53:08] mean I'm just I'm just I'm just I'm just
[53:11] presuming but it seems like the Ephesus
[53:13] age was the age that was most on fire to
[53:15] God they had the first love so it seemed
[53:18] like Ephesus would be the foundational
[53:20] age that would be the age that we all
[53:23] tried to attend to right but then all
[53:26] six are still annoying too but six come
[53:28] out from that one Todd Lee that's how it
[53:30] must be taught through the scripture to
[53:33] understand that other six branches
[53:36] differentiated from the other one the
[53:38] seventh by God's grace now interesting
[53:43] Aaron Warren ephod over shoulders owns
[53:51] one each stroller had six name so here
[53:54] he goes he's anointed right if he said
[53:56] go the Friends of God he's got to be
[53:57] anointed and he's got two sixes on his
[54:00] shoulders two sixes as he goes the
[54:02] prints of guns
[54:03] he's got twelve on his breastplate but
[54:06] there's two sixes on him he's an
[54:08] anointed man in the service of the Lord
[54:11] and each stone had six of the names of
[54:13] the tribes of Israel on it and then the
[54:15] twelve stones each stone had one of the
[54:17] names of the twelve tribes on it and
[54:19] that's an exodus chapter 28 verses 8 to
[54:22] 12 this is God's were not we're not
[54:25] making this up this is God's holy word
[54:27] God anoints men with sixes
[54:30] praise God Howard we're not even close
[54:34] to being done with the Old Testament the
[54:36] shewbread was in two rows of six on the
[54:40] table two sixes right two sixes made
[54:43] twelve twelve his governmental
[54:45] perfection as we'll see later on the
[54:48] government there's twelve tribes there
[54:50] be twelve apostles ruling over the 12
[54:53] tribes of Israel
[54:54] so shewbread was in two rows now
[54:57] remember shewbread was always supposed
[54:59] to be hot it was always supposed to be
[55:01] fresh as shewbread would be placed on
[55:04] the Sabbath
[55:04] and as soon as the twelve fresh ones
[55:06] went down the priest eight to twelve old
[55:08] ones in the Pens of God and God called
[55:11] this my bread amen this was God's bread
[55:14] this was God's offering unto Him and God
[55:17] always promised that fresh bread but his
[55:20] in two groups of six that's right Church
[55:26] did you know there were six cities of
[55:28] refuge where men who were unawares of
[55:33] killing someone could flee among the
[55:36] cities of the Levites amen and notice
[55:38] there was three on the side of Jordan
[55:40] and three on the side of Canaan praise
[55:44] God and that's in numbers 35 verse 6 and
[55:49] verse 14 so six cities of refuge because
[55:54] six is the number of man it was we'd say
[55:57] a protection for man right because they
[56:00] could be protected in the city of refuge
[56:02] and we know the name of the Lord is like
[56:04] a strong tower the righteous run into it
[56:06] and they're saved Amen so they had a
[56:08] we'd say an anointing or protection of
[56:11] their lives if they accidentally killed
[56:14] someone God made a way that they could
[56:17] be protected amen
[56:18] so six it was not a bad number six was a
[56:21] good number praise God in Deuteronomy 16
[56:25] verse 8
[56:26] during the feast of unleavened bread
[56:29] humming oh how many days they ate they
[56:31] ate for six days six days they ate
[56:34] unleavened bread for the feast and the
[56:36] seventh was a solemn assembly so for six
[56:39] days you sat at your home I'm going to
[56:41] them God eating unleavened bread on
[56:44] their seventh you all everybody went to
[56:45] church and gathered at the church so the
[56:48] six days of enjoying no leaven no sin in
[56:52] your house for six days Oh let that be a
[56:55] sweet anointing came ahead hallelujah
[56:57] and that's what I represented six days
[57:00] with no leaven no sin see the anointed
[57:03] man seen through all these types and
[57:06] shadows praise God
[57:09] Joshua compass Jericho for six days in a
[57:13] row compass in the city once and then
[57:17] returning to the camp
[57:18] for six days in a row where does that
[57:21] represent something back
[57:22] no that represents something good that
[57:24] represents that God that they were
[57:26] anointed because remember they just got
[57:29] recently circumcised and washed clean
[57:32] amen
[57:32] they just followed the arc over Jordan
[57:35] which represents the baptism of the holy
[57:37] ghost so these six days represented
[57:40] anointed men consecrated men going
[57:44] around Jericho six times but on the
[57:46] seventh the trumpets blowed on the
[57:48] seventh praise God amen
[57:52] Ruth was given six measures of barley by
[57:56] Boaz because we know Jesus Boaz was the
[58:00] seventh right but he gave her six so six
[58:05] was going to show that the anointing or
[58:06] the blessing of Boaz was going to be
[58:09] upon the Gentile and the Jew Ruth the
[58:13] dead top Naomi the Jew there we go
[58:16] Laurie and Boaz said rest and of course
[58:21] and rest and they always had rest until
[58:24] Boaz finishes the work praise God this
[58:27] was going to be six days or six measures
[58:29] of blessing until Boaz finished it and
[58:32] then he was the seventh measure he would
[58:35] take care of her the rest of their days
[58:36] amen did you know this David when he
[58:41] actually did got a service the right way
[58:43] with the ark back on their shoulders
[58:45] every six steps
[58:51] look two four five
[58:54] every six steps they would sacrifice
[58:57] oxen every time after 6 because 6 was a
[59:02] number of an anointed man because now
[59:05] David's he still shout and he still
[59:07] rejoice it he's given God praise with
[59:09] all of his night but he's gonna stop
[59:11] every six steps to show that he's
[59:13] anointed and they're gonna sacrifice and
[59:16] make sacrifices under God every six
[59:19] steps praise God
[59:22] I don't know if you do this but in
[59:26] Solomon's Temple he had six steps up to
[59:30] the throne not seven six and there was
[59:36] six Lions on each side which represented
[59:39] one which gives us twelve lines in two
[59:43] groups of six so again remember the
[59:44] shewbread two groups are six here
[59:50] beating up to chose an anointed temple
[59:53] and anointed king king solomon with
[59:57] sixes and twelves brings the Lord after
[1:00:03] we see two more groups of six Esther was
[1:00:06] purified six months of oil and myrrh
[1:00:09] that was the first six the second six is
[1:00:11] purification with sweet odours and other
[1:00:14] things for purification so she went
[1:00:17] through a year of purification when it
[1:00:19] was divided up into two sixes so this is
[1:00:22] not Esther being evil this is Esther
[1:00:24] being cleanse this is Esther being
[1:00:27] anointed by the by the natural oils and
[1:00:29] MERS right which is a type of the
[1:00:32] spiritual praise God the seraphim's had
[1:00:38] six wings two of them cover their face
[1:00:41] for reverence to cover their feet for
[1:00:44] their walk and then two that were flying
[1:00:47] for action for their action for the holy
[1:00:50] spirit and these were connected to the
[1:00:54] anointing as well because the seraphim's
[1:00:56] in Isaiah chapter six brought a coal
[1:00:59] from the fire of God and it touched
[1:01:01] Isaiah's lips and his lips were cleansed
[1:01:04] amen so see it represents the anointing
[1:01:07] of God these six wings bring down the
[1:01:10] anointing of God and it relates a filthy
[1:01:13] man and it makes him clean so he can go
[1:01:16] forth and speak God's Word to God's
[1:01:17] people hey man it's an anointed man
[1:01:22] let's read this one let's go to number
[1:01:25] six 23 and 24
[1:01:27] number six twenty-three twenty-four
[1:01:34] sorry I haven't called you earlier
[1:01:37] numbers I see
[1:01:39] number six 23 and 24
[1:01:45] number six 23 and 24 alright letting go
[1:01:52] to read 23 Malachi 3 24 manera notices
[1:02:02] this was steady flows - under is your
[1:02:04] own singing good Lord bless thee and
[1:02:06] keep the Lord make his face to shine
[1:02:09] upon thee and be gracious unto thee the
[1:02:11] Lord lift up his countenance upon thee
[1:02:13] and give thee peace and they shall put
[1:02:15] my name upon the Turner of Israel and I
[1:02:18] will bless them did you count how many
[1:02:20] times that God was gonna bless them six
[1:02:24] times if they stayed faithful in the
[1:02:27] promised land God was gonna give them a
[1:02:29] six fold blessing he would bless them he
[1:02:33] would keep them he would shine upon them
[1:02:36] he would have grace upon them his
[1:02:39] countenance would be upon them and then
[1:02:41] they would have peace amen
[1:02:44] beautiful hallelujah the c6 is often a
[1:02:47] blessing remember we saw with the manna
[1:02:49] the blessing was on double blessing on
[1:02:51] the sixth memory saw was the six year
[1:02:53] double blessing on the sixth there's
[1:02:56] such a connection between sixes and
[1:02:59] blessings six represents a man who is
[1:03:01] anointed it can represent a man
[1:03:04] but it can also represent a man annoying
[1:03:06] today men well let's go to Daniel
[1:03:10] chapter 9 here's what I preached about
[1:03:13] three years ago
[1:03:16] Gabriel visited Daniel in Daniel chapter
[1:03:18] 9 and who remembers how many purposes
[1:03:22] that he did he visit for six the six
[1:03:26] fold purpose of Daniels visit so Daniel
[1:03:28] 9:24 brother Branham preached this on
[1:03:35] July 30th 1961 he called it Gabriel's
[1:03:39] instructions to Daniel and Lily can you
[1:03:43] read verse 24 for be heard
[1:03:54] reconciliation for iniquity in two
[1:03:56] previous provision in the practice ea6
[1:04:03] whole purpose and the last one is to
[1:04:06] anoint the most holy
[1:04:08] amen so let's read what I taught last
[1:04:11] time this is from the revelation I got
[1:04:14] through reading brother Branham sir
[1:04:15] the first purpose is to finish the
[1:04:18] transgression program said take away the
[1:04:21] blindness of Israel and graph Israel
[1:04:23] back in that's the first purpose lioness
[1:04:26] causes transgression so it is also the
[1:04:29] turning away or finishing up up the
[1:04:31] Gentiles that was the first purpose of
[1:04:33] game or coming to tell Daniel about that
[1:04:36] the second purpose was to make an end of
[1:04:38] all sins and brother have said this is
[1:04:41] Israel's sin or unbelief literally ends
[1:04:44] when Jesus appears physically to the 140
[1:04:51] because won't this believeth actually
[1:04:54] see the literal Savior Jesus Christ and
[1:04:57] this is tied by Joseph revealing himself
[1:05:00] to his brothers lorry the third purpose
[1:05:04] is to make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:05:07] Israel's iniquity is purged or pardoned
[1:05:10] on the one day according Isaiah 66 verse
[1:05:14] 8 in which they aren't born again so
[1:05:18] this is how reconciliation is made from
[1:05:21] iniquity the Holy Ghost is the Ministry
[1:05:24] of reconciliation according to second
[1:05:26] Corinthians 5:18 through 21 number we're
[1:05:30] supposed to be ambassadors of the
[1:05:31] reconciliation that God has given to him
[1:05:34] and his people praise God
[1:05:36] the fourth purpose is to bring in
[1:05:39] everlasting righteousness the
[1:05:41] thousand-year millennium is the time of
[1:05:43] righteousness when the glory of the Lord
[1:05:45] will fill the earth
[1:05:52] say influence anyone in the Millennium
[1:05:54] this is not eternal righteousness just
[1:05:57] 1000 years remember Satan comes out at
[1:06:00] the end of this thousand years and he
[1:06:02] gathers up by sin and unbelief and
[1:06:04] brings an army against the holy city so
[1:06:07] it's not eternal it's just everlasting
[1:06:10] righteousness from red tells us fifth
[1:06:14] reason Gabriel visited was to seal up
[1:06:17] the vision and prophecy which Gabriel
[1:06:19] came to seal up the understanding of
[1:06:21] this vision and prophecy from Israel and
[1:06:24] everyone else until the end time so gate
[1:06:27] run to come and tell seal this up to the
[1:06:30] end time but whose had been unsealed to
[1:06:32] to Jesus and bride Amen the bride of
[1:06:35] Jesus Christ through the preaching of
[1:06:37] the seven seals that God gave to brother
[1:06:39] Branham and of course it will be
[1:06:40] unveiled
[1:06:42] also to the 144,000 through the
[1:06:44] ministries of Moses and Elijah remember
[1:06:49] the seventh messenger would finish the
[1:06:51] mystery of God to the Gentiles if you
[1:06:53] keep reading the rest of the chapter
[1:06:55] because this booklet this open book was
[1:06:57] supposed to be eaten by John and then
[1:06:59] prophesied to people's tongues
[1:07:01] multitudes nations amen
[1:07:04] lastly the sixth and final thing what is
[1:07:06] it to anoint the most holy
[1:07:08] so brother said the Millennial temple
[1:07:11] must be anointed for the millennial
[1:07:13] reign
[1:07:14] according to Ezekiel 43 verses 1 to 6
[1:07:17] after fire purifies the earth and we
[1:07:21] walk out on the ashes of the wicked
[1:07:24] according to Malachi 4:1 through 3 so
[1:07:27] what did I what did I try to tell you I
[1:07:28] to say number 6 represents anointed man
[1:07:31] and here the sixth purpose the sixth and
[1:07:33] final purpose of Gabriel's visit to
[1:07:35] Daniel is to tell him the most holy must
[1:07:38] be anointed God's earthly Tabernacle
[1:07:41] must be anointed here when he starts the
[1:07:44] Millenium Amen praise God s'okay hope
[1:07:47] you can see it tonight by God's grace on
[1:07:49] six represents anointed man alright now
[1:07:55] he ignores a new testament see we
[1:07:57] haven't got to the New Testament with
[1:07:59] the the good sixes and their boy they're
[1:08:01] sure a lot of good ones here as well
[1:08:05] this one was a real blessing to me in
[1:08:08] Luke 1:26 and 36 it was in the sixth
[1:08:13] month of Elizabeth's pregnancy with John
[1:08:16] the Baptist that Gabriel visited Mary
[1:08:19] and that's interesting he visited Daniel
[1:08:22] with a six fold purpose and now he
[1:08:24] visits Elizabeth or certain IV visits
[1:08:27] Mary in the six month of John the
[1:08:29] Baptist pregnancy I'm sorry
[1:08:32] Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the
[1:08:33] Baptist and brother Branham said life
[1:08:37] came into John as six months or the holy
[1:08:40] ghost' anointing let me read this from
[1:08:44] paradox 1964 Elizabeth said that she was
[1:08:48] kind of worried she said because it's
[1:08:50] been six months now and the baby hasn't
[1:08:52] moved
[1:08:52] that's irregular see baby is practically
[1:08:55] what we call today then see as good as
[1:08:57] then in his mother's womb six months and
[1:08:59] it troubled her and you know John was
[1:09:02] six months older than Jesus which was
[1:09:05] his second cousin Mary and Elizabeth
[1:09:07] were first cousins in perservere of 64
[1:09:11] my mom said and just as soon as that
[1:09:14] human name of God Jesus was spoke by a
[1:09:17] mortal limb of a human being a dead baby
[1:09:20] come to life in the womb of a woman and
[1:09:22] receive the Holy Ghost amen and if that
[1:09:26] will do that to a baby dead in the
[1:09:28] mother's womb what ought to do to a barn
[1:09:31] again turn what off the name of Jesus do
[1:09:34] to us tonight amen it ought to set us on
[1:09:36] fire amen it ought to revive us and I'll
[1:09:39] anoint this just to hear the name of
[1:09:41] Jesus Christ preached there saying
[1:09:43] because it's such a glorious name the
[1:09:46] name of Jesus now I can't prove by the
[1:09:52] Bible that John the Baptist was dead but
[1:09:54] I can prove by the Bible that John the
[1:09:58] Baptist got anointed when Mary spoke the
[1:10:01] name of Jesus for the first time any
[1:10:03] minute
[1:10:04] who the Bible said he's the Bible said
[1:10:06] he leaped and he was filled with the
[1:10:07] Holy Ghost
[1:10:08] from that moment on amen of course that
[1:10:11] was in the human realm or the spiritual
[1:10:13] realm of the mind of the human spirit
[1:10:15] we'd say
[1:10:18] so hope everybody can see that the
[1:10:20] anointing came upon John the Baptist in
[1:10:22] the six month not v not the seventh the
[1:10:26] six month praise God
[1:10:28] all right in John chapter 2 Jesus first
[1:10:33] miracle changed six water pots of water
[1:10:37] into wine why not more six six and we
[1:10:44] also know that Christ he represented the
[1:10:46] seventh water pot right
[1:10:53] the station of Christ's glory was
[1:10:56] deception and we're also going to see
[1:10:58] his manifestation of his glory and
[1:11:00] another wedding reception the marriage
[1:11:02] supper of the Lamb maybe her gonna see a
[1:11:04] mighty glorious thing there praise God
[1:11:07] hallelujah
[1:11:08] we'll have communion with our Lord and
[1:11:11] he'll drink again we're gonna see that
[1:11:12] great manifestation of an eating of the
[1:11:14] bread and drinking of the wine drinking
[1:11:17] of the fruit of this vine at the
[1:11:19] marriage supper of the Lamb praise God
[1:11:20] and this shows us that the best wine is
[1:11:23] shared to the end so we'd say the
[1:11:25] greatest revelation of God's Word is
[1:11:27] saved to the end this age when all the
[1:11:30] mysteries of God are finished
[1:11:32] hallelujah praise the Lord amen six
[1:11:38] waterpots
[1:11:39] and he was the seventh praise God so
[1:11:42] seven anointed water pots they're so
[1:11:45] annoying that they went from water to
[1:11:50] hey then did you know it was six days
[1:11:54] before the Passover that Mary anointed
[1:11:57] Jesus feet with upon appointment and
[1:11:58] spikenard he was anointed six days
[1:12:02] before and also Mary God anointed six
[1:12:07] days and four
[1:12:08] see how the number six represents the
[1:12:11] anointing upon a man praise God
[1:12:14] everybody see that Oh glory there's
[1:12:17] always these anointings and sixes all
[1:12:22] right
[1:12:23] the four living creatures are cherubims
[1:12:25] they each had six wings right according
[1:12:29] to revelation 4:8 and what do they
[1:12:32] represent those four I presenting the
[1:12:33] four anointings on the church throughout
[1:12:36] the entire church ages because they had
[1:12:39] to combat the four horse riders so they
[1:12:42] have six wings but they're representing
[1:12:44] the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon
[1:12:46] four groups during the church ages amen
[1:12:50] and we're supposed to have the anointing
[1:12:52] of the flying eagle praise God the five
[1:12:55] bug denominations Creed's and all the
[1:12:57] worldliness of this day this wicked
[1:12:59] labor scene age is blind miserable
[1:13:01] wretched Laodicea eggs were supposed to
[1:13:03] fly above that and be genuine Holy Ghost
[1:13:05] filled Christians anointed with the
[1:13:07] Spirit of God amen six weeks hallelujah
[1:13:14] all right oh yeah I kind of skipped
[1:13:17] ahead a little bit so part of me back in
[1:13:19] John chapter four verse six Jesus met
[1:13:23] the Samaritan woman at the sixth hour so
[1:13:28] her her sins and her her situation her
[1:13:32] her discernment came about the sixth
[1:13:35] hour so God God had the gift of the Son
[1:13:38] of Man discern the Samaritans about the
[1:13:42] sixth hour so that represents the
[1:13:48] anointed man and members she already had
[1:13:50] five husbands and she was living with
[1:13:51] six so is that the six hour God revealed
[1:13:55] her six awful husbands was showing that
[1:13:58] Christ would be her seventh and last one
[1:14:00] amen so the anointing came to deliver
[1:14:03] her from her
[1:14:05] oh and mine so annoyed her she ran down
[1:14:08] to the city it almost all this city
[1:14:10] believe that Jesus Christ was the
[1:14:12] Messiah such a mighty anointing about
[1:14:14] the sixth hour hallelujah praise the
[1:14:17] Lord
[1:14:18] in Acts chapter 10 Peter went to pray
[1:14:23] about the sixth hour on the top of his
[1:14:26] roof and that's when he saw the vision
[1:14:29] of the sheet coming down with the
[1:14:31] unclean animals when did it happen about
[1:14:34] the six hours about noon he went to pray
[1:14:36] about noon and that represents of course
[1:14:39] a vision would have to come from what
[1:14:40] the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:42] so again six represents the anointing
[1:14:45] the sixth hour the anointing came down
[1:14:48] and Peter saw a vision on the 6:00 hour
[1:14:50] praise God how many men were on Mount of
[1:14:57] Transfiguration six there was three that
[1:15:00] were theophany or there would've been
[1:15:02] the outfit for Moses Elijah in Christ
[1:15:04] and there was three who were still in
[1:15:06] their human bodies Peter James and John
[1:15:09] now they were in a vision and in order
[1:15:12] to see a vision you've got to be
[1:15:13] anointed with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:15:16] so again six represents man anointed how
[1:15:20] many raptures are there there are six
[1:15:24] there's six times gods are going to saw
[1:15:26] anoint man that they don't have to die
[1:15:29] and they could go straight to heaven
[1:15:30] amen hallelujah by God's grace will be a
[1:15:34] part of that one even the fifth one will
[1:15:36] be a part of by God's grace amen
[1:15:38] will be a part of the fifth out of six
[1:15:40] raptures I always wondered why there are
[1:15:43] six raptures never I preached it I saw
[1:15:44] maybe there's seven maybe there's eight
[1:15:46] maybe I'll find that but actually we
[1:15:48] stay with six that's a good
[1:15:49] representation because it represents an
[1:15:51] anointed man and woman to cheat death
[1:15:53] and go and meet Christ in the air at the
[1:15:56] rapture Amen hallelujah inna the first
[1:16:01] rapture Elijah the second Jesus only to
[1:16:05] the Father the third Jesus leading
[1:16:07] captivity captive the fourth the fifth
[1:16:10] the Gentile bride and six the two
[1:16:12] prophets of Revelation chapter 11 amen
[1:16:18] now this is one that I mentioned
[1:16:20] recently but we want to remember this
[1:16:22] how many pieces of armor does the full
[1:16:26] armor Christian have on six
[1:16:29] the first is loins Girt about with truth
[1:16:32] and remember Peter said gird up the
[1:16:35] loins of your mind so this is a mind
[1:16:38] that is just going to believe truth
[1:16:39] that's why we got to read our Bibles
[1:16:41] that's why you want to read those acts
[1:16:42] of the Prophet books that we gave up
[1:16:44] that's why we want to always have your
[1:16:46] mind on the word thank you go over
[1:16:53] they've been preached a few weeks ago
[1:16:55] you're ready to move and fight for the
[1:16:57] kingdom of God and you can also slip
[1:16:58] your sword in there if you need to but
[1:17:00] of course if you got your sore point out
[1:17:01] you're ready to fight and slay as well
[1:17:05] second you have the breastplate of
[1:17:07] righteousness your heart is covered over
[1:17:10] your heart is covered by the
[1:17:12] righteousness of Christ it's no longer
[1:17:14] you doing it in your heart but Christ
[1:17:16] giving you a new heart
[1:17:17] they met breastplate of righteousness
[1:17:19] you do right because you love Christ
[1:17:22] third your feet are shod with the gospel
[1:17:25] of the preparation of peace the
[1:17:28] anointing of God is on your feet you're
[1:17:29] ready to go and do your willing to drop
[1:17:31] everything and go help someone by the
[1:17:33] grace of God because the gospel is upon
[1:17:36] your feet for if you have the shield of
[1:17:40] faith that's the fourth thing and you're
[1:17:43] able to quench every fiery dart every
[1:17:45] lie from hell you can the fifth is the
[1:17:52] helping us combination you attack your
[1:17:55] salvation you it's just blocked because
[1:17:58] you know you're saying you know you did
[1:17:59] what Peter said you repented have been
[1:18:01] baptized and you're saying Amen in the
[1:18:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:06] remission of sins praise God you know
[1:18:08] you're saying you follow God's plan for
[1:18:10] salvation and 6 and finally you've got
[1:18:13] the sword of the Spirit in your hand
[1:18:16] you're ready to use the Word of God now
[1:18:20] what does a person who's anointed like
[1:18:22] this what does the Bible say they do
[1:18:23] first he said first praying always with
[1:18:26] all prayer and supplication the spirit
[1:18:29] to see when you're full
[1:18:31] related with all the parts of armor what
[1:18:33] do you do you're ready to pray for
[1:18:35] somebody if you don't feel like praying
[1:18:37] if you don't feel like you're ready
[1:18:38] ready to pray you got to get anointed
[1:18:41] you gotta be come under the anointed man
[1:18:43] 90 and get all six parts ready your mind
[1:18:46] your heart your salvation right your
[1:18:50] sword your faith you've got to get all
[1:18:51] these things build up anointed with all
[1:18:53] these six things now you're ready to
[1:18:55] pray amen
[1:18:56] that's beautiful six has got to be a
[1:19:00] great number because our cert six church
[1:19:02] age messenger was John Wesley a mighty
[1:19:06] man of God who's gonna say six is a bad
[1:19:09] number on that one he's one of the most
[1:19:11] gifted preachers I think he was up every
[1:19:13] morning at 4 a.m. he was preaching by 5
[1:19:15] a.m. on almost every morning of his life
[1:19:17] after he got nothing he's Davis and he
[1:19:20] got saved around 32 or not mistaken 32
[1:19:22] and 35 once he found his his message of
[1:19:26] sanctification he was up preaching that
[1:19:28] early he was the sixth church age
[1:19:29] messenger praise God and I believe him
[1:19:35] I'm not mistaken he was under the omit
[1:19:37] and the anointing of the man age
[1:19:39] I just came fresh ain't never I did that
[1:19:42] said he preached that somewhere else
[1:19:44] would be a blessing to the the Saints
[1:19:45] there he was under the man anointing
[1:19:49] won't let me bring up a keyboard I
[1:19:53] wonder why not not sure okay so I need
[1:20:00] to make can you write that down for me
[1:20:02] and we got a piece of paper write that
[1:20:04] down that he was in relief man oh he can
[1:20:06] use right now and just put it up here
[1:20:08] when you're ready I'm just gonna go
[1:20:11] through the paper just scribble that on
[1:20:13] there say John Weston was under the man
[1:20:16] anointing because six represents the the
[1:20:19] anointing of a man that's not just him
[1:20:22] thank you
[1:20:24] that's a good thought I want to lose
[1:20:26] that that came fresh fresh right now I
[1:20:28] believed by God's grace okay I'm coming
[1:20:33] down to close here coming down to close
[1:20:39] let me
[1:20:40] do a few more things I want to go down
[1:20:43] to the Ministry of brother branham now
[1:20:47] last week we show now there is five
[1:20:49] times a third pull operated see if I can
[1:20:52] remember them the first two times were
[1:20:55] squirrels in a new existence a third
[1:20:59] time was had he right speaking to the
[1:21:01] storm and then meet his tumors there's
[1:21:04] the five I never knew this but who knows
[1:21:09] how many times or how many squirrels the
[1:21:11] brother branham speaking in existence
[1:21:12] six three the first time and three the
[1:21:18] second time it's so striking the first
[1:21:21] time was in September of he was 1959 he
[1:21:27] spoke three squirrels in existence in
[1:21:29] Jeffersonville the next time was in
[1:21:32] November of 1959 in Kentucky and brother
[1:21:37] Brad said these six would be God
[1:21:40] confirming my ministry on the third pole
[1:21:43] amen so he knew these six squirrels
[1:21:46] would confirm his ministry in the third
[1:21:49] Pole now to me it's also confirmation of
[1:21:53] God's anointed prophet because 6
[1:21:55] represents the anointed man anointed the
[1:21:59] Holy Spirit let me redo these quotes
[1:22:03] here so you can understand where I got
[1:22:05] this so this is the story from my new
[1:22:08] ministry November 15th 1959 this is the
[1:22:12] story where brother Branham says 6 is
[1:22:15] the number of anointed man he doesn't
[1:22:18] use those exact words but as I told you
[1:22:20] he said let this be a confirmation of my
[1:22:22] ministry so 6 was going to be a
[1:22:24] confirmation of his anointed ministry I
[1:22:27] want you to see this when he spoke all 6
[1:22:29] squirrels he said he had a super
[1:22:31] anointing on him and that beautiful a
[1:22:34] super anointing he in other words had an
[1:22:37] anointing on an anointed man to speak 6
[1:22:40] squirrels into existence amen thank you
[1:22:52] okay so programs that I started into the
[1:22:55] woods and the squirrels upon the ground
[1:22:56] and I started up into the woods and
[1:22:57] something said to me how many squirrels
[1:22:59] do you want this morning I said well
[1:23:01] I've got 117 this year if I had three
[1:23:04] more and make it 120 that would just
[1:23:07] make an even number to stop on and I
[1:23:10] said and another thing it would give me
[1:23:11] six to take home so brother may have
[1:23:14] already on three but the holy sprit asks
[1:23:16] on how many more and he said I like
[1:23:17] three more for six to take home which I
[1:23:23] love them better than any meat there is
[1:23:26] to eat so squirmy must be really tasty
[1:23:28] and I said if I could just get three
[1:23:31] more Lord and I walked on up through the
[1:23:34] woods a little further and oh there was
[1:23:36] none good hunters like Charlie then got
[1:23:38] one and I said well hide something said
[1:23:41] to me say to it speak the three
[1:23:43] squirrels and you'll have it I
[1:23:51] this is what he's in Kentucky a little
[1:23:54] treatment of a Ridge and that anointing
[1:23:56] listen that anointing came so great so I
[1:23:59] could hardly stand on the ground so see
[1:24:01] this is an anointed man hope everybody
[1:24:04] can see that the anointing comes on him
[1:24:06] a man to speak three more squirrels so
[1:24:10] you have a total of six that anointing
[1:24:14] comes so great I could hardly stay on
[1:24:16] the ground said said speak what you say
[1:24:18] don't doubt and you can have what you
[1:24:20] said I said I shall get three squirrels
[1:24:23] he said where will they come from I said
[1:24:27] one will come from that way one from
[1:24:28] that way and one back this way I said I
[1:24:31] make it radical God don't care how
[1:24:33] radical that it seems he's got a
[1:24:35] circumstance okay now he's already shot
[1:24:39] two and he keeps having trouble with the
[1:24:42] third now he says now surely Lord you
[1:24:45] won't let me miss after I've already
[1:24:47] said under the anointing that this would
[1:24:49] be and you're confirming my ministry
[1:24:52] this will be six times that you
[1:24:55] confirmed it to me the number of man six
[1:24:59] times I said you won't let me miss him
[1:25:02] so God brother has basically recording
[1:25:04] God's promise back to him saying you
[1:25:06] told me I wouldn't miss you told me I
[1:25:07] get 6 because 6 is the number of man -
[1:25:11] and I need a confirmation I'm a man I
[1:25:13] need a confirmation of 6 so of course we
[1:25:17] know it was a super anointing that came
[1:25:19] upon it he said I looked up on down the
[1:25:21] tree and way up there I thought I had
[1:25:23] seen some leaves I've seen something
[1:25:24] moving in it and I raised and shot and
[1:25:27] the squirrel dropped to the ground stone
[1:25:29] dead up the hill I went rejoicing and
[1:25:32] happy see rejoice on the 6th he was
[1:25:35] anointed rejoicing on the 6th squirrel I
[1:25:40] went to the first tree over to my left
[1:25:42] and there laid the squirrel praise God
[1:25:54] so with that I think I finish up all the
[1:25:58] positive examples for let me close with
[1:26:00] this last one in second Samuel 21 verse
[1:26:05] 20 here Satan's imitation of six so I
[1:26:08] ended the other sermons by showing
[1:26:10] Satan's imitation here's the one
[1:26:12] imitation where Satan tries to use a6 to
[1:26:17] intimidate the people of God in 2nd
[1:26:22] Samuel 21 verse 21 of Goliath sons had
[1:26:25] six fingers and six toes on both hands
[1:26:29] and feet
[1:26:32] so here's Satan somehow the genetic code
[1:26:35] something happened and Goliath son is
[1:26:38] trying to intimidate them and the way
[1:26:39] intimidates them other than being big is
[1:26:41] he's got six fingers on this hand 6 on
[1:26:44] that hand six toes six toes there see
[1:26:47] God's design was for a double 5 5 and 10
[1:26:50] 15 20 double grace but this speaks of
[1:26:54] double grace upon our hands and also
[1:26:58] upon our feet our walk and our works
[1:27:03] should speak of double grace like the
[1:27:06] head so that comes down shouting grace
[1:27:08] grace double grace but Satan tried to
[1:27:11] imitate that and he tried to intimidate
[1:27:13] the people of Israel by putting six six
[1:27:17] six and another six but we know what
[1:27:20] happened david's mighty men slew that
