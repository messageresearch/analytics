[0:00] Just read uh 1st Samuel 16
[0:04] verse one also. And I saw a mighty angel
[0:07] Christ come down from heaven clothed
[0:10] with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[0:12] head. And his feast was as it were the
[0:16] sun and his face was as the sun. Sorry.
[0:20] And his feet were as pillars of fire
[0:24] that came down in our day. Our Lord
[0:26] Jesus. 1st Samuel 16:1. And the Lord
[0:30] said unto Samuel,
[0:34] "How long
[0:36] wil thou mourn Saul's
[0:39] for Saul? Seeing I have rejected him
[0:45] over Israel."
[0:47] Here's God
[0:49] pushing the prophet to move on. How long
[0:54] are you going to mourn the past?
[0:57] move forward. How long are you going to
[1:00] mourn over Saul, seeing I've rejected
[1:03] him,
[1:05] reigning over Israel? Lord Jesus, I pray
[1:08] you'll bless these people. Lord,
[1:11] supernaturally bless these people. Bless
[1:13] this church. Bless Pastor Jesse's family
[1:16] and the ministry. And Lord, I pray
[1:19] you're just, you're already here, but I
[1:21] pray your divine anointing would come
[1:22] and bless your bride tonight.
[1:27] and we'll give you all the praise for
[1:28] all for all of eternity. In your name we
[1:31] pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your
[1:34] seats this morning.
[1:41] Amen.
[1:43] I want to preach on bride's anointing.
[1:47] The bride's anointing. And I want to
[1:49] type it in. Oh. Oh, sorry. Oh, that's
[1:53] right. Yeah.
[1:59] I got a pretty big voice.
[2:01] [Laughter]
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[2:20] All right. No, no, no. It's all right.
[2:22] No, it's all right. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. No,
[2:24] no. Sorry. I didn't I thought it was
[2:25] somebody banging on the wall or
[2:27] something next door. I'm sorry. I
[2:28] thought they were weightlifting or
[2:29] something. Forgive me,
[2:32] man.
[2:37] I'm sorry. I might be
[2:42] sorry.
[2:47] Amen.
[2:50] Amen. So here we see in 1st Samuel 16:1
[2:53] that the Lord was
[3:00] asking Samuel.
[3:02] See when God rejected Saul,
[3:06] the prophet had trouble with that
[3:09] because he loved Saul.
[3:11] He loved Saul.
[3:14] And so he was mourning God's decision
[3:18] over Israel. And I I want to show you
[3:20] something. The in the bride's anointing.
[3:24] There's something in the bride that
[3:26] isn't visible maybe yet,
[3:30] but it's there. Looks are deceiving. And
[3:34] I want to show you here. Here, you know,
[3:37] when when God asked Saul, if that might
[3:39] we can change anything, pastor. Just
[3:42] whatever. I'm sorry.
[3:44] Brother Mlen,
[3:46] you know, here we want to type this
[3:47] here. When the Lord comes and to the
[3:49] prophet and ask him these questions, he
[3:51] said, "How long are you going to mourn
[3:52] over these big churches?
[3:56] How long are you going to mourn over the
[3:57] people that are rich? How long are you
[4:00] going to mourn over the handsome and
[4:03] everything that's going on amongst
[4:05] them?"
[4:06] God said to Samuel, "I've rejected them,
[4:10] disobedient to my word. I've got a
[4:13] predestinated elected bride that loves
[4:17] every word that I hang to. I got a I got
[4:19] a bride that has the the my heart. We
[4:23] when I I I I mentioned just a few little
[4:25] things. It's amazing. The anointing was
[4:28] grabbing part of this message this
[4:29] morning. But you know how we come out of
[4:31] God's side and we actually come out of
[4:33] his heart.
[4:35] But David had the heart of God.
[4:40] David had a man
[4:42] that would obey his word. And we see
[4:44] here if we drop to verse seven, and the
[4:48] Lord said unto Samuel, look not at his
[4:51] countenance or his heights. We mentioned
[4:53] this, the stature, because I've refused
[4:56] them. These were David's brothers.
[4:59] For the Lord saith, seeth not by man
[5:02] seeth, but lookth on the outward
[5:04] appearance. But it was the Lord that was
[5:06] looking on the heart. And we see here,
[5:09] here's God talking to the prophet and he
[5:11] said, "You're looking at the wrong
[5:13] thing.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; You're looking at his countenance.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; You're looking at his education.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; You're looking at beauty.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; You're looking at his heights. But I see
[5:24] his heart. I see way past what you're
[5:26] looking at."
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; And his heart, Saul's heart
[5:32] is far from me. David's brother's heart
[5:34] were far from me. And then if we drop
[5:37] down to verse, and I'm going to go with
[5:38] something with this here. You know, in
[5:40] verse 11 here, Samuel said unto Jesse,
[5:43] David's dad, he said, "Is this all your
[5:46] children?"
[5:48] He said, "There remainth just the
[5:49] youngest, just the little group around
[5:52] the corner. They not they're not
[5:55] affiliated with nobody big."
[5:59] &gt;&gt; And they behold, and he's just keeping a
[6:01] few noisy sheep, them holy rollers. And
[6:04] you know, and Samuel said unto him,
[6:06] "Send forth and fetch them." And here
[6:09] Samuel's asking. He said, "It is it.
[6:12] There's no more real believers. Is this
[6:14] it? You don't have no more kids."
[6:19] &gt;&gt; Jesse said, "Well, just a little sheep
[6:21] boy, the one that's all smelly."
[6:25] I want to show you something that was on
[6:26] David. And and I mentioned that this
[6:29] morning. Forgive me for that. But I want
[6:32] to show you something that was on the
[6:33] bride.
[6:35] There was something on David that his
[6:37] closest family never seen.
[6:41] There's something on you
[6:43] that your closest blood relatives
[6:47] may not see.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; It's the bride's anointing.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; It's election.
[6:55] Watch this. Verse 12. And so they sent
[6:59] and brought David. And now this is what
[7:01] the scripture says about David.
[7:06] He was runy
[7:08] with all and with all of any beauty,
[7:12] countenance,
[7:15] and goodly to look to. And the Lord
[7:17] said, "Rise up and anoint him, for this
[7:21] is my man." I'm sure the prophet there,
[7:26] God's prophet.
[7:28] So he said, "You're sure, God?
[7:31] You
[7:33] &gt;&gt; You're sure this is it?
[7:37] David had nothing that the natural eye
[7:40] could see
[7:42] &gt;&gt; in beauty or countenance, but his
[7:44] anointing.
[7:46] He was God's anointed. See, he had a
[7:48] heart
[7:50] after God.
[7:52] And the bride is God's heart.
[7:56] And she has God's anointing. You see, I
[8:00] I want to just jump down here and show
[8:02] you some things. David was God's
[8:04] anointed,
[8:06] &gt;&gt; but he was running for his life.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; He was anointed the king, but he had no
[8:13] crown.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; He was anointed king, but he had no
[8:19] crown.
[8:20] He had he was a royalty, but he had no
[8:23] robes.
[8:25] He never had a throne, but he he
[8:28] possessed the throne.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Sounds like the bride. He possessed the
[8:34] throne. He had a kingdom, but he never
[8:36] had a kingdom.
[8:40] You belong to a kingdom.
[8:44] Watch this. How David
[8:46] never had safety. Here he's running from
[8:48] the very people he's supposed to be king
[8:50] over.
[8:52] Hayen rejected
[8:56] the bride. Watch this. Watch how the
[8:57] bride was with David.
[9:01] David's own men. The Jewish people
[9:04] rejected David. And David's own men were
[9:06] Hittites.
[9:08] They were gentile bride because they
[9:11] seen the a potential anointing and they
[9:15] seen what David was going to become. And
[9:18] they knew David would be ruler.
[9:21] wasn't what he was today,
[9:24] &gt;&gt; but his own people
[9:27] couldn't see it.
[9:29] The Hittites seen it. They recognize the
[9:32] coming anointing
[9:34] of King.
[9:37] You know, sometimes people right around
[9:40] us and even in the churches or in the
[9:42] bride might not recognize God's
[9:44] anointing on you.
[9:48] That's so it's so important where when
[9:50] we preach this morning is knowing your
[9:52] position in Christ, knowing where you
[9:54] are. Amen. So we look at verse 13. So
[9:58] Samuel took the horn and he anointed
[10:00] David, his brethren, and the spirit of
[10:02] the Lord fell on David
[10:05] from that day forward. And Samuel rose
[10:07] up and went his way.
[10:12] Samuel anointed God's chosen bride.
[10:15] And the spirit of the Lord came on
[10:17] David.
[10:20] And the spirit of the Lord's came on the
[10:22] bride.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; And it hasn't left us.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; And it never will leave us.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday, today, and
[10:30] forever.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up with crowns yet.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up with thrones
[10:36] yet.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Don't change the anointing. watching
[10:43] Samuel or uh Psalms, sorry,
[10:47] Psalms 105:15,
[10:48] saying, "Touch not my anointed and do my
[10:51] prophets no harm." I want to I want to
[10:53] break that scripture down a little bit.
[10:55] You know, the anointing is not just
[10:56] ministers. Many times this is pointing
[10:58] to ministers, and that is true, but the
[11:01] anointed is anybody with the baptism of
[11:03] the Holy Ghost.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; If you would offend one of the least of
[11:07] these,
[11:11] Huh?
[11:12] &gt;&gt; You have offended me.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Touch not my anointed. Be very
[11:18] careful. Remember when you're
[11:21] speaking to your brother and sister that
[11:23] you're speaking to God.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; I wonder how that would change different
[11:30] things, disagreements. Huh? See, you
[11:34] know what the prophet said this. He said
[11:36] they didn't recognize the presence of
[11:39] God in their day.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Bride don't fight bride.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 6:19. What then? Knowest
[11:53] thou not that thou body is a temple of
[11:56] the Holy Ghost, which is in you, and
[12:00] which ye have of God, that ye are not
[12:04] your own.
[12:07] God owns you.
[12:10] God's anointing, the bride's anointing,
[12:14] if you want to change that over into
[12:16] God, the Greek word was Christ's
[12:18] anointing. Christ meant anointed one.
[12:21] The bride is the anointed one. Watch
[12:24] what our prophet said here.
[12:26] He said, you notice how God didn't move
[12:29] Israel until his own anointed time.
[12:34] See, there's a time for everything.
[12:37] Amen. And now listen, this is going to
[12:40] mean something. Joshua waited for that
[12:43] time.
[12:47] No matter how much the people might have
[12:50] said, see the people could have came to
[12:52] Joshua. See, Joshua was coming after Mo,
[12:55] you know, Joshua was far greater
[12:57] ministry than Moses ever was.
[13:00] Oh, a million times.
[13:03] Moses just brought them out. But Moses
[13:05] took them in and placed them.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; He took them to the Holy Ghost and
[13:10] placed them into their ownership.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; So the people could come and see that
[13:18] Joshua was raising up behind Moses and
[13:20] they'd say Joshua
[13:22] was waiting for the time no matter how.
[13:24] But here the people would say God gave
[13:26] us the land. Let's go the promised land.
[13:28] He said, "Let us go now and let the
[13:31] people would be encouraging Joshua
[13:34] to take it."
[13:36] And they might have said, "Joshua,"
[13:39] this our prophet talking here, Joshua,
[13:41] you've lost your commission.
[13:45] You're all washed up. You don't do it
[13:48] like Moses used to do it.
[13:53] &gt;&gt; You're not doing this or you're not
[13:54] doing that. We used to do it this way.
[13:57] Now, thus saith the Lord in the moment,
[14:01] what was the will of God?
[14:03] But this wise, God sent a prophet that
[14:06] knew the promise of God.
[14:09] And he also knew to wait on the promise.
[14:14] A clear-cut decision from God for his
[14:16] time. And see these parables. Now, watch
[14:19] this. There's a prophet talking about
[14:20] the time come that God give it to Joshua
[14:24] who had stayed with him. Stayed by the
[14:27] word and he couldn't trust others but he
[14:30] could trust Joshua.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; So will that repeat again? That's what
[14:36] the prophet asks.
[14:38] Will we stay with the word
[14:41] &gt;&gt; even though we wonder God's timing? You
[14:42] know you know I I'll confess to you.
[14:44] Brother Dale thought the rapture would
[14:46] have already taken place. I would have
[14:48] never believed. I I just opened my
[14:49] heart. I would have never believed that
[14:52] the bride of Christ or believers in
[14:54] Canada would have lived through what
[14:55] they lived through in CO. I would never
[14:57] believe that. I would have flat out I
[14:58] would have preached against it. You see,
[15:01] we're going before the tribulation.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; But things have not worked out exactly
[15:07] like God's bride thought they might.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; But we're still here fighting.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought.
[15:16] But God has a time
[15:18] when he's going to take I know we're not
[15:20] going through the tribulation, but we're
[15:21] going to feel a certain amount of
[15:23] pressure.
[15:24] Everything God valued, he put under
[15:27] pressure. Gold, diamonds, coal, oil,
[15:30] everything put under pressure.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; And the bride he values is going to have
[15:34] a certain amount of pressure because the
[15:36] only thing you're taking with you is
[15:38] your character.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; And you only get character
[15:43] by pressure.
[15:46] How do you handle what you don't
[15:49] understand?
[15:51] &gt;&gt; That's what David had. David was put
[15:54] under enormous pressure running for his
[15:58] life from the very David went and and
[16:01] the very enemy that was trying to kill
[16:03] him. David went to play the harp. I
[16:07] couldn't have done it.
[16:10] Could have you.
[16:12] Could you went back after he threw the
[16:14] drive alone and stuck in the welder and
[16:16] just said, "Oh,
[16:22] David knew the hatred."
[16:25] David went right into the enemy camp
[16:29] and played with the anointing that
[16:32] removed the evil spirits.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; The bride
[16:39] has went into the enemy camp.
[16:43] You're living in neighborhoods that are
[16:45] the enemy camp. And with the a with
[16:49] God's anointing, you can remove the evil
[16:52] spirits
[16:55] &gt;&gt; because of your presence.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; They will desire to kill you because
[17:01] you're not of the world. If you were of
[17:02] the world, they would love you. But
[17:03] because you're of God, they don't
[17:04] understand you.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; For the world don't see me because they
[17:08] don't know me.
[17:11] It's the same with his bride.
[17:14] Amazing. Here we see in first Peter 2,
[17:18] 1 Peter 2:4,
[17:21] whom coming we are to become living
[17:24] stones,
[17:26] disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of
[17:30] God
[17:36] &gt;&gt; and precious. Ye also are living stones
[17:39] and are built up a spiritual house, a
[17:42] holy priesthood
[17:44] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[17:47] acceptable to God in your environment.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what David was called to
[17:55] do. David was anointed for the throne,
[17:59] but he was playing for his enemies.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[18:09] And David had such the spirit of Christ
[18:13] that when he was encouraged to take his
[18:16] enemy's life
[18:21] and really justified
[18:24] in the natural.
[18:29] David was so careful. If we had the
[18:32] spirit of David, man, there would never
[18:34] be a divided nothing.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; He said,
[18:38] watch this. David even went out on a
[18:40] limb. He said, I would never lay a
[18:42] charge or touch. David's heart was
[18:44] pricricked because he took the garment
[18:46] of Saul when he could have took his
[18:48] life. And Saul was not David God's
[18:52] anointed because the Bible says the
[18:55] spirit of the God, the spirit of God
[18:56] left Saul and an evil spirit had
[18:59] tabernacled him.
[19:02] But David wouldn't take any chances.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[19:13] You don't know who's predestinated
[19:15] to be bride.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; You know everything in the New
[19:21] Testament. You would be surp if you if
[19:24] your pastor come up here and preach who
[19:26] Jesus ministered to in the Bible. Most
[19:29] message churches would empty.
[19:34] Rahab in the wall, woman at the well,
[19:37] woman caught in the very act, the woman
[19:39] washing Jesus' feet. That was a sinful
[19:40] woman.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; And on and on.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; They would never be allowed to. This
[19:48] place is sacrifically holy.
[19:53] But God seen the anointing. see that
[19:57] that David's men seen the anointing on
[20:00] David even though the Hittite men seen
[20:02] the anointing even though David was
[20:04] still running for his life. There was no
[20:07] if you wouldn't have been there when
[20:09] Samuel anointed David, there was no
[20:12] physical evidence
[20:14] other than the spirit on David and his
[20:16] actions. There was no physical evidence
[20:18] that David was taking the throne. Do you
[20:21] know how many Jewish men that David had
[20:22] following him after that anointing?
[20:25] zero.
[20:30] Wow. Don't judge your church by numbers.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; You have everything you need right here.
[20:40] The Holy Ghost.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Period.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Everything he's gave for your journey is
[20:46] right here. It's not in
[20:50] what you see with the eye.
[20:54] You don't have to move anywhere. You
[20:56] just have to move in Christ. Drink and
[20:58] get big. Drink and get big. Watch what
[21:00] the prophet says here.
[21:04] Here, you know, in verse 9, it says,
[21:06] "But you are a chosen generation, a holy
[21:09] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[21:11] people that you should show forth the
[21:13] praises of him who has called you into
[21:16] this from out of this darkness into his
[21:19] marvelous light."
[21:21] Here a prophet says in the days of
[21:23] Solomon so will it be in the coming of
[21:25] the son of man when he shall be revealed
[21:27] not more as the church but more as the
[21:30] bride called in fact the day of the son
[21:32] of man will be revealed what he said to
[21:36] join the church to the head it's a
[21:39] uniting of the marriage of the bride the
[21:42] bridegroom will come right through this
[21:44] and when the son of man will come down
[21:47] which he's he's already we already said
[21:49] that he came down he come down in
[21:51] revelation
[21:52] We read that. And when the son of man
[21:54] comes down and comes into human flesh,
[21:59] this quote proving his word 64. Oh,
[22:02] wait. And when he comes into human flesh
[22:04] and it unites the two together and the
[22:07] church has the word and he is the word
[22:09] and the two's united and then she'll go
[22:13] home to a wedding supper because she's
[22:15] already united. I mentioned this this
[22:17] morning. See, we're going to a wedding
[22:20] supper, not to a marriage.
[22:26] See, you have everything here to serve.
[22:29] You already are sitting in heavenly
[22:32] places here.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; You can have heaven on earth. What the
[22:35] prophet shown us is we can have heaven
[22:37] on earth here in your environment.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; You're in the David did.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; David did. He had heaven and earth. He
[22:47] was playing for his enemy. They're
[22:49] throwing spears at him.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Because the marriage of the lamb has
[23:04] come, but the rapture is going to be the
[23:08] wedding supper. And when the word unites
[23:10] with the person,
[23:13] that's you. When the word unites with
[23:16] the person, they too become one. And
[23:18] then that's what does it then? It's the
[23:20] manifestations
[23:22] of the son of God again
[23:25] &gt;&gt; in our day.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; The bride's anointing typing of David's
[23:31] anointing. He didn't have what was
[23:33] coming,
[23:35] but it's a glorious church without spot
[23:38] and wrinkle. Don't be deceived that the
[23:41] world think Revelations 1:6 it says,
[23:43] "And Christ has made us kings and
[23:46] priests."
[23:47] &gt;&gt; You feel How many feel like a king
[23:49] today?
[23:50] &gt;&gt; How many feel like priests?
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Unto God his father. Unto him be glory
[23:56] and dominion forever and ever. See,
[23:58] that's that's the anointing that's
[24:00] there. And it don't change your
[24:03] situation.
[24:05] David was anointed. David was as good a
[24:07] king running for his life as he was when
[24:10] he sat on the throne.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; He had the exact same backing.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; He was the same person. But God was
[24:17] building his character.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; So when he got there, he would know how
[24:21] to handle God's children.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[24:33] 1 Corinthians 6:2.
[24:35] 1 Corinthians 6:2. Do you not know,
[24:37] saints, that ye shall judge the world?
[24:41] And if the world shall be judged by you,
[24:44] are ye not unworthy to judge the
[24:47] smallest matters amongst you?
[24:51] Know ye not that ye shall judge angels?
[24:55] And how many more things that pertainth
[24:58] to this life? See, it looks like we're
[25:02] It looks like you're an insignificant
[25:04] person, but your anointing is much
[25:08] bigger
[25:09] than your appearance.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:14] I want to tell you something.
[25:16] Things are about to change.
[25:19] You'll have the same anointing,
[25:22] but it's a time. It's a time.
[25:24] Revelations 19 6-9 here. Revelations 19
[25:28] it says and I heard a
[25:31] as it were a voice of a great multitude
[25:33] and the voice of many waters that's
[25:35] people and as the voice of many
[25:37] thundering saying Allah the Lord God
[25:40] omnipotent reignth let us be glad and
[25:42] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[25:45] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[25:48] wife his wife has made himself herself
[25:51] ready
[25:53] &gt;&gt; and to her is granted that she shall be
[25:55] arrayed
[25:57] and fine linen
[25:59] clean and right. You know the story of
[26:01] the the the rich businessman that was
[26:04] bringing his son down to find a bride
[26:06] for a wife
[26:07] &gt;&gt; and they brought him in the party and
[26:08] all the women were were dollied up and
[26:11] and and you know immature and and
[26:14] whatever they were doing in the party
[26:16] and the young man had character. He was
[26:19] looking for a wife. He wasn't looking
[26:21] for a some
[26:25] girl. He was looking for character.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; And he had to clear his head from all
[26:30] these Jezebels. And he went out and just
[26:32] out in the weather and just take a
[26:34] breath of air and go, "Whoa, whoa."
[26:37] And he spotted a little somebody
[26:41] &gt;&gt; that had been washed in the floor.
[26:45] She had no idea
[26:48] the anointing that was on her.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Of course, everybody made fun of her.
[26:53] Sound familiar?
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, little Oh, yeah. You got Why don't
[26:57] you join?
[27:02] But her groom said, "I'm coming back for
[27:04] you a year from today." So, she was
[27:08] preparing
[27:09] for what the anointing the that the
[27:11] promise was coming. Amen. And that's
[27:14] where the bride of Christ is. We know
[27:16] it's just around the corner. Just any
[27:18] day now.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; We're going to leave this place.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Just any. But the anointing is already
[27:23] there. The ownership's already there.
[27:26] The the marriage is already there.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Even though you're not sitting in the
[27:33] kingdom and even though you're not
[27:35] having servants,
[27:39] look at how David was compared to the
[27:42] bride. the bride's anointed.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[27:47] Revelations 21 9 and 10. And there came
[27:51] one of the seven angels with the seven
[27:54] vows full of seven plagues. And it
[27:57] talked with me, saying, "Come up hither
[27:58] and I'll show you the bride,
[28:01] the lamb's wife." And he carried me away
[28:04] in the spirit, the great high mountain.
[28:06] And he showed me that great city, the
[28:08] holy Jerusalem, descending out of God.
[28:11] God's done that to us.
[28:14] God's came in our day and brought a
[28:17] message that completely took the seals,
[28:20] opened the seals. And he said, "The
[28:22] Bible became a brand new book." He said,
[28:24] "I can read between the letters. It's a
[28:26] love letter." You know, he said, "Watch
[28:28] this." He said, "When I when my wife
[28:29] sends me a letter," he said, "I know
[28:31] exactly where she's sitting. I know
[28:32] exactly the environment. I know exactly
[28:35] whether the kids because I'm married to
[28:37] her."
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's my wife.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; The lamb's wife. And I'll carry her away
[28:47] in the spirit a great high mountain and
[28:49] show me the great city. See, God's doing
[28:52] this and he's shown us. But he's saying,
[28:56] "But why are we so rejected?" You're not
[28:58] rejected.
[29:00] The people, you know,
[29:03] the Bible said it like this. He said,
[29:04] "If you were of the world, they love
[29:06] you. But he that loved the world,
[29:09] there's love of God isn't in him.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; So see, you have everything you need.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Your heavenly father, your bridegroom,
[29:19] Jehovah, Christ.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. And in this message, he he
[29:27] revealed himself like never before. Why
[29:31] did he do when he told John to seal it
[29:33] up? Said, "Brother Dale ain't been born
[29:36] yet.
[29:37] It's not time.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; But in our day,
[29:43] everything,
[29:45] everything. There's not coming another
[29:47] message here. There ain't nothing more
[29:49] to reveal. He's unveiled himself. Who do
[29:52] you unveil yourself to his wife?
[29:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is who I am. This is what
[29:58] I am."
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; The bride's anointing is powerful.
[30:07] You can see the bride's anointing when
[30:09] you come into the full adoption of
[30:12] maturity. You know, he's coming for a
[30:15] lady. Man, here when we look at what the
[30:18] prophet says here, he says, "The way
[30:20] Christians are," he said, "we're planted
[30:21] together in Christ Jesus, who is the
[30:24] exhaustible, inexhaustible, sorry,
[30:27] fountain of life. And we're planted in
[30:28] Christ, and we just have to drink and
[30:32] drink and drink and push out." See,
[30:35] we're not looking for something new.
[30:37] Brother Dale can't bring you not
[30:38] something new. Your pastor knows twice
[30:41] as much as me in the word. It's it's
[30:43] it's there, but we just have to eat it
[30:46] and mature and grow and lay in the
[30:49] presence of the sun. Drink and push out
[30:51] everything you have need of. That's what
[30:53] the prophet says for your earthly
[30:55] journey. Divine healing, the power of
[30:58] God, all those other things, everything
[31:01] you have need. Every individual,
[31:05] it makes that very personal.
[31:08] Every individual in here that's received
[31:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's
[31:14] planted in Christ, has everything you
[31:16] need for your life journey.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost, the baptism,
[31:25] yes, sir. Everything you have need of in
[31:27] the life's journey. Even I mentioned
[31:29] this this morning.
[31:32] I had looked over these notes before I
[31:34] come. Even the rapture is in you right
[31:37] now.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Now watch what the prophet says. He
[31:40] says, "Don't resent that.
[31:44] You're denying your anointing."
[31:48] He said, "Don't resent that. That's the
[31:51] truth. The rapture is in us right now."
[31:54] And he said, "I can prove it by the
[31:56] gospel."
[31:58] Those who he justified,
[32:01] those he he called, and those he has
[32:04] already glorified. Hallelujah. And we're
[32:06] heavenly bound. Amen.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; The bride. Amen. Th this is this is more
[32:11] than more than what you would recognize
[32:15] is the anointing of Jehovah.
[32:17] John 3 11 just laying a bit of
[32:21] scripture. Amen. Just a very but it's
[32:24] powerful when you we recognize the
[32:25] anointing here. John 3 verily verily I
[32:28] say unto you we speak that we know and
[32:31] testify in what we've seen
[32:36] and ye have received not our witness.
[32:39] And if I had told you earthly things and
[32:41] you believed them not how shall I tell
[32:43] you? How shall you believe if I tell you
[32:47] heavenly things?
[32:48] See, this is nothing
[32:51] but the truth. And no man has ascended
[32:54] up into heaven. See here, they had come
[32:57] to see Jesus and said, "Show us the
[32:59] father and it shall suffice us."
[33:03] He said, "I've been with you all this
[33:05] time and you never seen me.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; I'm right here. Take a look."
[33:11] And then Jesus said, "But no man has
[33:13] ascended up to heaven, but first he came
[33:14] down from heaven." And here, watch how
[33:17] Jesus talks. And the son of man is in
[33:19] heaven right now, but he was standing
[33:21] before them.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[33:28] How could the son of man be standing
[33:30] before the question
[33:32] and say, "The son of man's in heaven."
[33:36] Amen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Spirit.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was everywhere. You see how the
[33:44] anointing of Jehovah and the exact same
[33:48] anointing in measure is in his bride.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Wow. Watch this. You know, you you say
[33:57] when this scripture said I could
[33:59] testify, you know, I was sharing some
[34:01] testimonies with your pastor and I and I
[34:03] thought of one back there in the in the
[34:05] the uh the worship service. You know, we
[34:08] we're church and we had everything we
[34:10] need and we're in a church building and
[34:12] not not that that matters at all, but we
[34:15] were looking for nothing. So many times
[34:17] the bride of Christ ain't looking for
[34:18] nothing. And God will give you things
[34:20] that you're not even looking for
[34:24] to bless you.
[34:27] We had a brother come to me and he said,
[34:30] he said, 'Do, he said, 'I seen a piano
[34:32] on Facebook Marketplace,
[34:36] a grand piano,
[34:38] and we don't need a piano. We have the
[34:41] very beautiful electric piano, fancy
[34:43] one, and uh we're not even looking for
[34:47] one. And he said it was labeled for
[34:49] $2,500, but they lowered it to free. So
[34:52] he said, "If you're interested, I'll
[34:53] call them and see if that's real." Look
[34:56] at church. That's that sounds good. You
[34:59] know, you know, I I want to I want to go
[35:01] into this. Faith is not some big
[35:03] superman.
[35:05] You don't need a Goliath in faith.
[35:08] It was the plain weed of hissip. It grew
[35:12] everywhere.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; This anointing is everywhere.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; It's just common gospel of Jehovah.
[35:25] Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Watch this. So he called and he said,
[35:27] "Yeah, it's free." The husband had
[35:28] actually died. He was the piano player.
[35:30] So we went and get this panel. Now, I'm
[35:32] going to tell you something. If you ever
[35:33] seen a boat anchor,
[35:35] oh boy. Oh, boys, was it heavy? I mean,
[35:39] it was really heavy. I mean, I mean, it
[35:42] was heavier than heavy.
[35:44] and my boys and daughters took it apart
[35:46] and we put it on trailer and we brought
[35:48] to the church you know and
[35:51] and we were deciding where I mean it was
[35:55] it was wow I think when we went over the
[35:58] pews we had six people carrying this
[36:00] without the legs it was unbelievable so
[36:04] we have a man come to to tune it the man
[36:07] walks in we have sitting at the front
[36:08] now this is something we're not looking
[36:10] for we don't even need it
[36:13] but maybe I thought we needed it.
[36:18] And the piano guy walks in. He said,
[36:20] "That's a $4,000 piano."
[36:22] Said, "Oh, wow."
[36:24] Said, "That's that's amazing. Looked
[36:26] real nice. Match the pews. It was all,
[36:29] you know, about this color wood, you
[36:31] know, a little just slightly darker."
[36:33] And and he goes to tune the piano and he
[36:35] opens it up and he said, "This piano has
[36:38] brand new pins and brand new strings."
[36:41] He said, "That's another 4,000
[36:44] $8,000 panel that we went 10 hours 10
[36:47] minutes away to pick up for free. That's
[36:51] the bride's anointing."
[36:53] &gt;&gt; See, God can do anything. God will do
[36:56] things that you don't even have to ask
[36:57] for
[36:59] &gt;&gt; because you're his wife.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "But it was you didn't have
[37:04] to." You know, there was things that you
[37:06] don't have to pray for. God, and of
[37:09] course, we're supposed to pray. I don't
[37:10] mean that.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; But you can just ask God. You know, you
[37:14] have the mind of God. You don't have a
[37:16] selfish mind. A mature wife don't have a
[37:18] selfish mind. If God knows, if you need
[37:21] something, God knows you need it before
[37:22] you ask for it.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; For faith is the evidence of things
[37:31] hoped for, but but the evidence of
[37:34] things not seen. Now, I want to I want
[37:35] to show into this here. He said, "This
[37:37] is the kind of anointing
[37:39] that's on the bride. Don't look for some
[37:42] big earthly."
[37:43] Amen. It'll be a secret. I don't mean
[37:47] that God's hiding. I don't mean God's
[37:48] ashamed, but people won't see. You know
[37:51] what? You could be We've had We've had
[37:55] unbelievable miracles happen in our
[37:57] church. And and then like a month later,
[37:59] someone come up and say, "I don't see
[38:00] God moving." I'm just like,
[38:05] where were you?
[38:08] People have an unbelievable forgetter.
[38:12] An unbelievable forgetter.
[38:15] I mean I mean monthly.
[38:19] Probably more than that. See, we're
[38:21] blinded
[38:23] to the anointing.
[38:25] Watch this. The Jewish people were
[38:28] blinded to David's anointing. His family
[38:30] was blinded to his anointing. His dad
[38:32] was blinded to his anointing,
[38:35] &gt;&gt; but it was the Hittite men
[38:38] that were Gentiles
[38:40] &gt;&gt; would have been heathen,
[38:43] &gt;&gt; but they seen the power of God on his
[38:45] life.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Bride's anointing.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; You know, look at this. The church
[38:55] called Christ Jezebel and the devil
[38:58] called him Lord.
[39:02] When when Jesus went to cast the demons
[39:03] out of the bed, the pig said, "Why you
[39:05] here yet to torment it before our time?"
[39:07] That was the devil.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; So the devil recognized that he was
[39:15] Lord, but the religious people recognize
[39:20] things don't change.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Things don't change. Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; People that you think might recognize
[39:27] your gift might not. And somebody that
[39:30] you would never believe that would
[39:32] recognize the potential of God's
[39:33] anointing on your life will recognize
[39:36] it.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; God's sovereign.
[39:40] Watch this. He says, "And by the way,
[39:43] that hissup plant is a common weed."
[39:46] Hissup means your faith.
[39:51] Somebody tries to do some supernatural
[39:53] faith. There you go. Well, you got to
[39:56] have this super person come in and you
[39:58] got to have this super building and you
[40:00] got to drive this super suit and you got
[40:02] to have a super hairdo and you got to be
[40:05] able to just sing super duper.
[40:10] That's the reason you miss your healing.
[40:13] Faith is just the common thing.
[40:17] You know the combat people heard him
[40:20] gladly.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to have faith to come to
[40:24] church. You got to have faith to walk
[40:26] out there.
[40:28] Watch this. You know, we have faith for
[40:29] the funniest things, but we have trouble
[40:31] trusting an omnipotent God.
[40:34] There's not one of you sitting here
[40:36] that's worried about your car starting
[40:37] in the parking lot. And it was made by a
[40:39] man that was probably in the union that
[40:42] didn't give a who.
[40:49] He said, "You got faith that your car
[40:51] will start. You got faith that you can
[40:54] eat your dinner."
[40:56] And that's just the way common faith is.
[41:00] You want to start your car and your kid
[41:02] needs healing. You can't get enough
[41:03] faith to heal your kid, but you got
[41:04] faith in some old battery that came from
[41:06] Japan.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; There's some things that you just got to
[41:14] take a hold of.
[41:17] You're the bride of Christ. You're the
[41:19] wife.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; You have some authority. You've
[41:22] recognized your place here.
[41:26] He said, watch this. Apply the blood. It
[41:29] was applied with hissup, which is a
[41:31] common weed that grows anywhere
[41:34] in Palestine. showing the faith of the
[41:36] blood being applied the same by by is
[41:41] not the same supper thing super thing
[41:45] that you got to have some watch this you
[41:47] you thought I was making this up he said
[41:49] you think you got to have apply some
[41:50] super thing and have this great doctor's
[41:53] degree
[41:55] to have some kind of move of God in your
[41:58] midst
[42:01] just common just common everyday people
[42:05] with just common everyday faith, just
[42:08] common everyday problems, but they got
[42:10] the power and the anointing of God in
[42:15] their life
[42:16] &gt;&gt; because they got God's heart. There's a
[42:19] there's an unspoken connection
[42:23] with the heart.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; You You You don't think so? I could be
[42:33] anywhere in the world and look at my
[42:35] wife and I could read her like a book
[42:37] and her me. We could go to the airport.
[42:39] We
[42:41] Oh boy. What just happened? I never said
[42:44] a word.
[42:47] She could she could read frustration in
[42:49] me. She could read because
[42:54] there's a common unity.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; The same with you and God.
[42:59] It's just calm and hiss up.
[43:02] He said, "You don't have to have this
[43:03] great doctor's degree." He said, "Apply
[43:06] the blood by the faith with just hiss
[43:09] up." That's a token message.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm I'm going to just a couple
[43:16] more things here and we're not going to
[43:18] be long here. Hebrews I want to show you
[43:20] just a couple things here and then we'll
[43:23] close by God's grace. Just a couple
[43:25] quotes and a couple scripture. Hebrews
[43:28] 12:5 to8.
[43:30] He said,
[43:32] watch here. He said, you still,
[43:36] even though you got God's anointing on
[43:38] you, he's proven and showing you to the
[43:41] world. He He don't even have to try you
[43:43] to prove it to yourself. But he's he's
[43:46] using you to prove to Satan,
[43:50] watch this, that in the last day that
[43:52] this second Eve won't fall.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; And you say, "But God, why am I going
[43:59] through this?" It's all right. God knows
[44:02] exactly what he's doing. Watch Hebrews
[44:05] 12:5.
[44:07] And ye have forgotten the exhaustion,
[44:11] the ex exhortation, sorry, which was
[44:14] spake on unto you as unto children. My
[44:17] son, despise not the chastising of the
[44:21] Lord, nor faint when ye are rebuked
[44:25] of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[44:28] chastises, and scornneth every son whom
[44:31] he receiveth. And if ye endure
[44:33] chastising, God dealeth with you as
[44:37] sons. For what son is him who the father
[44:40] chastises?
[44:43] Not
[44:45] not
[44:48] God was putting David through the milk
[44:53] after he was anointed by God's prophet.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; I mean, hugely putting him through the
[45:00] milk.
[45:04] Amen. If we see this here, I want to
[45:07] just bring out in in 1 Samuel uh 30. And
[45:11] I'm not going to read it all, but I'm
[45:12] going to tell you the story here when
[45:14] David became king and they went off and
[45:16] they were fighting a battle and the
[45:18] enemy came in and took all their wives
[45:19] and children away. You remember that
[45:22] story in 1st Samuel 30th. And they came
[45:26] back and of course they were just
[45:28] destroyed. They were just just of course
[45:32] they were I mean disappointed is a
[45:34] terrible word but I mean really stunned
[45:38] destroyed
[45:40] and the very man that loved David
[45:44] picked up stones to kill him.
[45:49] Wait, how in the world was that David's
[45:51] fault?
[45:55] In verse six, it said, "And David was
[45:58] greatly distressed, for the people spake
[46:00] to stone him because the soul of all the
[46:03] people was grieved and every man and his
[46:06] sons and daughters." And David
[46:10] encouraged himself.
[46:14] David knew
[46:17] who he
[46:19] was.
[46:21] David knew who he was.
[46:23] And David encouraged himself in the Lord
[46:28] his God.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; There's times when everybody around you
[46:34] won't recognize the anointing, won't see
[46:38] what God's doing and will question.
[46:42] You know, when when the the man was
[46:43] healed with the black eyesight, the
[46:45] blind sight in the Bible, everybody in
[46:47] the church was the Pharisees was
[46:49] concerned who sinned.
[46:51] When Job when Job went through his
[46:53] trial, well, you've sinned,
[46:56] but none of those cases were because of
[46:58] sin. They were like, God would be
[47:01] glorified.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; So, you can be going through a mountain
[47:04] of a trial.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If not, who? If not you, who?
[47:10] &gt;&gt; You know, we had a sister just healed
[47:11] from cancer. She had she had she had a
[47:14] tumor taken out like a fist and a half.
[47:17] Completely clean Bella out.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Completely.
[47:22] See, if not us, who?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; She wasn't given that that demon of
[47:28] cancer because she was the bride of
[47:30] Christ. She wasn't given that because of
[47:32] sin. It wasn't given that because she
[47:34] wasn't loyal. It wasn't given that
[47:36] because God didn't love her.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; But if not us, who?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; God couldn't dress nobody else with the
[47:42] anointing. And he was showing that I can
[47:45] put this on them and they're still mine.
[47:50] Amen.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; David encouraged himself in the Lord.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And this is our last quote. And it takes
[48:00] God's children to test them.
[48:03] A great test. Place them into the body
[48:06] of Christ. They believe and they went
[48:09] through trials.
[48:12] Believeth from the heart. This is the
[48:14] message. and they've had experiences and
[48:17] they've witnesses and know that they're
[48:20] talking about not just because see an
[48:22] indiv see I can show you how good God is
[48:25] but when you have your own experiences
[48:27] you can't take it away see Moses was
[48:30] anointed of God but when he experienced
[48:33] God after that burning bush nobody could
[48:35] take God from Moses
[48:37] &gt;&gt; before that he was just associated with
[48:39] him
[48:41] &gt;&gt; when you have the connection with God
[48:43] your husband yourself. No matter what I
[48:46] say, you're connected.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; That's what it's got to come to.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; See, if I can give you the Holy Ghost,
[48:54] then somebody else can take it from you.
[48:56] But when God gives it to you, nobody can
[48:59] take it from you. When God gives you the
[49:01] anointing of the bride, I can't take it
[49:04] from you. Lucifer can't take it from
[49:06] you. Nothing that the devil does can
[49:08] stop it,
[49:09] &gt;&gt; sir.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "It's a time tested
[49:14] tribe until their souls are set firm
[49:17] towards Calvary." Yes, they're
[49:18] timeested. Their witness the power of
[49:21] God. I've seen far too good
[49:25] to accept not believe. That's
[49:28] impossible. You come too late to talk to
[49:31] Brother Dale.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; That's where every one of us God don't
[49:36] have any grandchildren. Every one of us
[49:39] got to come under that anointing
[49:41] &gt;&gt; and recognize. So don't look at excuse
[49:44] me if God's something's happening in
[49:46] your life. The anointing of God can be
[49:48] right there.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; You can just take Satan back and say
[49:53] right here. It was all done.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Before God, I know where I come from,
[49:58] Satan. I know where I'm going.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; But it's got It's not that God don't
[50:04] love you, but he can't prove himself
[50:06] through nobody else.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; He's got to prove himself through the
[50:10] bride, his wife.
[50:12] It's not because they don't love you.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; It's because have you ever considered my
[50:17] servant Job?
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Because he stayed with the word. He
[50:28] upheld the word. Amen.
[50:32] Amen. That's where every one of us got
[50:35] to come to. David's
[50:38] anointing, the bride's anointing,
[50:41] excuse me.
[50:44] Even though he didn't have what was
[50:46] coming,
[50:48] it didn't change who David was.
[50:51] David before he sat on that throne and
[50:54] had an army and a kingdom and had
[50:58] servants and chariots and horses, he was
[51:01] a man after God's own heart.
[51:05] and the bride here tonight,
[51:08] you're a lady after God's own heart.
[51:12] Amen. Don't look at Don't look for
[51:14] something great. Don't look for a
[51:16] doctorate degree in in the spiritual
[51:19] realm to get me to there, man. God is in
[51:22] simplicity.
[51:24] God is in simplicity. He's in hissup in
[51:27] hissup faith. Go to your car and it'll
[51:30] start. That's the kind of God we serve.
[51:33] Amen. Everything you have need of
[51:36] &gt;&gt; is in you now. Man, don't think, well,
[51:39] oh, they got something over here. No.
[51:42] Amen. When when the Bible says, and I'm
[51:44] I'm literally closing my thing. You
[51:46] know, when the Bible says it says when
[51:48] they say that Christ is over here, don't
[51:52] run over there. They say, "Oh, but I
[51:54] seen something over here." Oh, the Don't
[51:56] run over there
[52:01] because he's in tabernacled inside you.
[52:03] I want I want to close with this. You
[52:05] know, when Jesus went to the garden
[52:08] and he prayed, who did he pray to?
[52:16] He prayed to himself.
[52:20] He said, "Father,"
[52:23] see, Jesus was had a human body. You
[52:25] know, the the prophet said this. He said
[52:27] Jesus confused his disciples.
[52:30] Direct quote. He said sometimes he spoke
[52:34] from the flesh, sometimes he spoke from
[52:36] Jehovah.
[52:38] And he said they couldn't, they were
[52:41] confused. That was the word, but they
[52:42] they they they couldn't grasp it.
[52:48] That's exactly the way it is in the
[52:49] bride. That's exactly the way it was in
[52:51] our prophet's message.
[52:54] He was a a man that like hunting, but he
[52:57] had thus sayith the Lord.
[53:01] He had a human spirit, but he had also
[53:03] thus sayith the Lord.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; You're the bride of Christ, the wife of
[53:07] Christ. You have a human spirit. And
[53:09] here David, the prophet said that Jesus
[53:12] didn't want to die. Jesus actually
[53:14] wanted to get married. He said, he said
[53:16] he didn't want to leave his friends. And
[53:18] he goes to the garden and he and he's
[53:20] and he knows his lot in life is to hang
[53:22] on Calvary for me. And he says, "Father,
[53:25] twice,
[53:27] if it's possible, take this from me."
[53:30] Was he praying to the God in heaven?
[53:34] The God was inside of him.
[53:39] When you pray, you don't have to look at
[53:41] Yeah. It's fine if you do,
[53:44] but he's inside of you.
[53:47] The po if you own the ocean, we're not
[53:49] the ocean. He was the fullness of the
[53:51] Godhead bodily, but you're a tablespoon,
[53:54] but it's still the ocean.
[53:57] So, if I I say, "Lord, I need a loaf of
[53:59] bread tomorrow." I don't have to say,
[54:00] "Lord, wherever you are over in Pastor
[54:03] Jesse's church or or that big church or
[54:06] I say, Lord,
[54:09] I'm your child. I need a loaf of bread
[54:13] &gt;&gt; cuz he's stopping that great side of
[54:15] me."
[54:16] &gt;&gt; See, and that's how people would get
[54:19] the, you know, when you see how the
[54:21] prophet broke down the godhead. We're
[54:22] we're not going there. But see, Jesus
[54:24] prayed to himself
[54:26] because he was the son of God. God is a
[54:29] spirit. God was a manifestation. Jesus
[54:32] was a manifestation of God.
[54:35] He changed his mask.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; You know, today I'm preaching, tomorrow
[54:42] I'll be a farmer. I might go get in
[54:44] tractor and civate a field, but I'm
[54:47] still Dale.
[54:49] Jesus was still God.
[54:53] Amen. That's amazing. Don't
[54:56] underestimate
[54:57] who you are. Don't look for a big
[55:01] church, a big pastor, big doctorate
[55:04] ministry, and a and a choir and and
[55:08] whatever else that human people would
[55:10] look for.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; All that you have need of is right here.
[55:16] All that you have need of is right
[55:18] inside you.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; It's a divine anointing. God placed you
[55:23] where you are for a reason. Why do I
[55:25] live in Canada? Because God placed me
[55:26] there. Why do people live in Africa
[55:28] where they're poor? Because that's just
[55:30] where God placed them. Why do you live?
[55:32] It's God. We can't question God's
[55:35] anointing.
[55:37] And here here God was going to the
[55:39] prophet Samuel. And I I really am
[55:41] closing. But to hear the prophet say,
[55:43] "How long will you mourn what I'm doing?
[55:49] You're struggling. Just let God be God.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Just let God be God. God says, "I've
[56:01] moved on." Then he's moved on. In this
[56:04] case, he had removed his spirit from
[56:06] Saul. Because he had a man that had
[56:11] God's heart, man. He's not going to
[56:13] remove his heart from his bride. That's
[56:16] not going to happen. You are the second
[56:19] Eve in the Bible. And this Eve is not
[56:22] God knows you're not fallen because he
[56:24] ain't fallen and you're a part of him.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Then bride's
[56:30] anointing is typed in David. The heart
[56:35] of God. God loves you tonight. God bless
[56:38] you, pastor. God bless you. Amen.
[56:44] Amen.
