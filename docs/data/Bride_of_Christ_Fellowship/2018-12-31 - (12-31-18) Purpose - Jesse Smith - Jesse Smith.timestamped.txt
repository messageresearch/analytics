[43:07] just read this be not thou therefore
[43:09] ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor
[43:12] of me his prisoner so that's why we're
[43:13] not ashamed of brother Branham but be
[43:16] thou partaker of the afflictions of the
[43:18] Gospel according to the power of God
[43:21] let's read verse 9 together one two
[43:24] three who has saved us and called us
[43:28] with an holy calling not according to
[43:31] our works but according to his own
[43:34] purpose and grace which was given us in
[43:37] Christ Jesus before the world began I'll
[43:41] read verse 10 but it's now made manifest
[43:43] by the appearing of our Savior Jesus
[43:46] Christ who hath abolished death and hath
[43:49] brought life and immortality to light
[43:51] through the gospel amen let's bow our
[43:54] heads for a word of Prayer
[43:55] I'm gonna have a need on their heart
[43:56] tonight just make it known unto God as
[43:58] we pray Heavenly Father we just come
[44:01] reverently before you Lord God we thank
[44:03] you for the testimony of your servant
[44:06] st. Paul the great prophet or the
[44:08] greatest missionary Lord outside of
[44:10] Jesus Christ we thank you for the
[44:12] testimony of st. Paul and father Lord
[44:15] where we see Lord how we have a holy
[44:17] calling Lord God and Lord there's a
[44:19] purpose that you have for us and it was
[44:22] in you Lord it was in your mind before
[44:25] the world began Lord reveal you more of
[44:28] your purpose to us tonight Lord God by
[44:30] your grace Lord God reveal more of
[44:32] yourself to us Lord God we're so
[44:35] thankful for your word and we ask that
[44:37] your spirit would continue to move
[44:38] amongst us here tonight as we prepare to
[44:41] take communion to show your death till
[44:44] you come Lord and then father as we
[44:46] leave Lord may we show your life
[44:48] hallelujah amen thank you lord
[44:51] communion shows your death but Lord as
[44:54] we leave and as we interact with the
[44:55] world in our family we show everyone
[44:58] your life thank you for this promise
[45:00] speak to us now through thy word in
[45:02] Jesus Christ's name the church said amen
[45:05] god bless you being see the praise god
[45:11] so I have some slides there Lydia had
[45:14] enough time yesterday and today to kind
[45:17] of make some quotes and I hope there'll
[45:20] be a blessing to you by the grace of the
[45:21] Lord this one make sure I didn't miss
[45:24] anything okay oh brother Simon had a
[45:30] good testimony don't let me forget he
[45:31] had a really good testimony shared with
[45:32] me from the Thailand trip and I talked
[45:34] to him last night and then he did
[45:36] confirm that when we were praying that
[45:39] God raised up a pastor on this last trip
[45:41] that's when that pastor got really solid
[45:43] and now he's sharing the message with
[45:45] everybody so Church God heard our prayer
[45:48] when he was over there we've said God
[45:50] give us a soul that would accept the
[45:53] message a pastor that would receive the
[45:54] message God answered us hey let's take
[45:57] the Lord for that amen hallelujah so
[46:02] we're very thankful for that both Simon
[46:05] confirmed that to me last night I was
[46:06] talking to him after I was driving home
[46:08] from the hospice care when I saw my
[46:10] coach so we have a good testimony about
[46:13] that as well so let's look at this here
[46:15] I like to preach on purpose you know I I
[46:17] just was looking for a really special
[46:18] picture you know something that kind of
[46:20] made you feel good you know that picture
[46:23] I don't know them it makes you feel good
[46:25] it makes me feel good like God's got
[46:27] something God's grew so great and so
[46:28] beautiful such a great purpose you know
[46:31] there's such a great thing that he has
[46:33] for us and I want to preach tonight on
[46:35] your purpose starts in God so I want to
[46:37] start with God because before you can
[46:40] find your purpose you got to find God
[46:42] amen and we want to look at some of
[46:44] these scriptures just to kind of remind
[46:46] us I just want to take maybe three or
[46:47] four sermons we'll see how many we can
[46:50] preach on purpose but eventually want to
[46:53] get down the spot where we can identify
[46:54] the gifts of the Holy Spirit in our
[46:56] lives because that's our purpose on this
[47:00] life you know God give you know if if a
[47:03] preachers / if my purpose is to preach
[47:05] the gospel and that's my purpose that's
[47:08] wonderful but I think everybody should
[47:10] know their purpose in Christ don't you
[47:12] brother Branham says you know he said we
[47:15] should all be just as interested in our
[47:17] gifts as the pastor is in his gift
[47:21] so that's my I guess that's my purpose
[47:23] behind reaching this is that everybody
[47:25] here can know God's purpose for your
[47:27] life and you know maybe God will reveal
[47:30] it through this these sermons or maybe
[47:32] to be in the next year in 2019 God
[47:34] reveal to you maybe God already has
[47:36] revealed it to you but I want everybody
[47:37] in this church to know their purpose the
[47:39] church when you have a purpose you can
[47:41] accomplish something you're not just
[47:43] wandering around aimlessly when I go to
[47:45] church but not quite sure what to do
[47:47] after going to church we want everybody
[47:49] to come to church knowing what they're
[47:52] supposed to do when they're here and
[47:53] then when they leave they know what
[47:55] they're supposed to do when they go home
[47:57] praise God that's the purpose behind
[47:59] this I guess the purpose so my
[48:02] inspiration as I've listened to brother
[48:03] Branham I've heard him talk about your
[48:05] purpose a lot lately and then Gus
[48:07] preachers like Joe Adams has talked
[48:09] about your purpose and Ben Arad talked
[48:11] about your purpose Simon talked about
[48:13] purpose and I've just been hearing that
[48:14] over and over again and then my own
[48:17] heart's desire this is what I shared
[48:18] earlier I want everyone to know their
[48:20] purpose in life I want you to be able to
[48:22] say God has shown me these are the gifts
[48:24] in my life and this is what God has
[48:26] called me to do I want everybody to know
[48:28] that praise God and then also I read
[48:31] this book this year it's one of the
[48:33] books I finished it was only there's
[48:34] only like 300 pages but I read this book
[48:37] and I got really it's called The Purpose
[48:38] Driven Life by Rick Warren now not
[48:41] everything's in there right but a lot of
[48:43] there's a lot of good things in there
[48:44] and so I'm going to be pulling some
[48:45] quotes from this book as well I really
[48:47] like how he just organized it so I'll be
[48:51] preaching a little bit off that so in
[48:53] order for you to find your purpose we
[48:55] must look to God first and let me set a
[48:57] timer here I'll try to just preach about
[48:59] 45 minutes here tonight now
[49:02] I looked it up on this is my screenshot
[49:04] from my phone but mirror and Webster
[49:06] says purpose is something set up as an
[49:09] object or end to be attained so in
[49:14] intention so I'm gonna use that word a
[49:15] lot tonight intention everyone has an
[49:19] intention that God has for your life God
[49:22] has an end and he wants you to become
[49:25] that thing that is at the end of his
[49:27] mind right at the end of your life God
[49:30] has something he wants you to become
[49:34] and we all kind of can we can all kind
[49:36] of understand what brother Branham was
[49:38] to become he was to become Eleazar are
[49:41] you with me Church that's what he was to
[49:44] become at the beginning we know he was
[49:46] to be a young pastor and then he was to
[49:49] be an evangelist but by the end of it
[49:52] thank God he was called to be Eleazar
[49:54] and he was set out to get a bride for
[49:57] Isaac amen
[49:59] thank you Lord that was his that was his
[50:02] intention at the end was to be Eleazar
[50:05] to get a bride ready to receive Jesus
[50:08] Christ amen
[50:09] so you and I everyone us of us have an
[50:13] intention God has intended you didn't be
[50:16] something you're supposed to become
[50:18] something I'm supposed to become
[50:20] something we all have a purpose that God
[50:22] has called us for now Colossians 1:16
[50:26] says
[50:27] for by him we're all things created that
[50:29] are in heaven that are in earth visible
[50:31] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[50:34] dominions or principalities or powers
[50:35] all things were created by him and for
[50:38] him and he is before all things and by
[50:42] him all things consist
[50:44] so you were created by God and he
[50:47] created you for a purpose amen
[50:50] and the reason you're here today as the
[50:53] brother Jose said yesterday is because
[50:55] he's causing you to stay here he's
[50:58] keeping you here amen
[50:59] he could have took you home this year
[51:01] but he allowed you to stay another year
[51:03] praise God thank the Lord
[51:05] see we consist by him or we we keep
[51:08] existing on the earth because of God he
[51:12] still has a purpose for us amen thank
[51:14] God for that
[51:15] now this is the very first chapter of
[51:18] the book and I I just you know wanted to
[51:19] show you I just I love highlighting and
[51:21] I just want to some of these quotes were
[51:23] so good I just wanted to read them from
[51:25] him you know I quote brother Branham all
[51:27] the time yesterday in fact was all
[51:29] brother Graham quotes I remember that it
[51:31] was all brother Graham quote so it's
[51:33] okay if I quote Rick Warren a little bit
[51:35] I thought he was inspired on some of
[51:37] these things he starts off this book by
[51:39] saying it's not about you the purpose of
[51:45] your life is far greater than your own
[51:46] personal fulfillment
[51:47] your peace of mind even your happiness
[51:50] it's far greater than your family your
[51:52] career or even your wildest dreams and
[51:54] ambitions if you want to know why you
[51:56] were placed on this planet you must
[51:58] begin with God you were born by his
[52:01] purpose and forest purpose the search
[52:04] for the purpose of life has puzzled
[52:06] people for thousands of years that's
[52:08] because we typically begin at the wrong
[52:10] starting point ourselves we ask
[52:13] self-centered questions like what do I
[52:16] want to be you know we shouldn't teach
[52:18] kids that back I what you want to be
[52:21] that's the wrong question Lydia what are
[52:23] you you in case you're what do you want
[52:25] to be that's the wrong question it
[52:26] should be Lydia what does God want you
[52:28] to be amen Karras what does God want you
[52:32] to be what because we cannot be at the
[52:35] center Christ has to be at the center I
[52:37] love see that's what I love I thought
[52:39] not that's inspired well what are my
[52:42] goal what should I do with my life what
[52:45] are my goals my ambitions my dreams for
[52:47] my future by focusing on ourselves will
[52:50] never reveal life's purpose the Bible
[52:53] says it is God who directs our lives of
[52:56] his creatures and everyone's in his
[52:58] power now he's using a different version
[52:59] so I'm giving you the King James now in
[53:02] whose hand is the soul of every living
[53:04] thing and the breath of all mankind so
[53:08] we got to be Christ centered not
[53:11] self-centered even in my life I must
[53:13] pray I'm 38 but I must pray it's not
[53:16] what I want to be
[53:17] it's what Christ wants me to be praise
[53:19] God so we must keep this in mind that
[53:24] our lives are in God's nail scarred
[53:27] hands amen
[53:28] Psalms 37 says the steps of a good man
[53:30] are ordered by the Lord and he
[53:33] delighteth in his way
[53:35] though he fought he should not be
[53:36] utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth
[53:38] him with his hand now Turks can I just
[53:42] share a little testimony real quick
[53:43] brothers member when brother Simon and
[53:45] cam came to this church man you remember
[53:47] that I don't know what he'll say if you
[53:49] were coming with me so they came here
[53:51] for like three years from 2006 to 2009
[53:57] thousand seven two years to 2009
[54:01] and God ordered that to be here while
[54:05] they were here but the Simon wrote me a
[54:07] note a real long letter at the end of it
[54:08] and he said brother Jessie I was dying
[54:10] spiritually he said when I came here God
[54:12] sent me here and your brother in church
[54:15] he drove three hours every Sunday to
[54:16] come here Simon did Simon he came and he
[54:19] said God but through the preaching that
[54:21] was here God raised him back up from he
[54:24] was almost spiritually dead he said God
[54:26] ordered his steps by the Lord God
[54:29] ordered him God brought him back to life
[54:31] here and then we fasted and prayed and
[54:33] they started a church there and God has
[54:36] vindicated that church over and over
[54:37] again by giving them miracle after
[54:39] miracle after soul saved after soul
[54:42] saved God ordered that God ordered all
[54:45] the steps by the Lord and then God
[54:48] delights in your way because you're
[54:51] walking by his orders amen hallelujah so
[54:54] see they follow the leading Lord here
[54:56] god bless him after two years of
[54:58] sacrifice driving three hours one-way
[55:00] six hours every Sunday spending all that
[55:02] money on the Turnpike God's given them a
[55:05] wonderful church there and all this
[55:06] wonders americo's and people being
[55:08] healed and saved and it's God's ordering
[55:11] the steps of his righteous amen though
[55:14] he falls should not be utterly cast out
[55:16] for the lord upholdeth him with his hand
[55:19] so see God orders her steps and then he
[55:21] promised he promises here he orders her
[55:24] steps and if you fall on the step he
[55:26] promised I'm delighting that you're
[55:28] walking in the path that I've given you
[55:30] and I'm gonna pick you up if you fall
[55:32] amen because you're walking in my path
[55:34] your mom walking in my will you're
[55:36] walking the steps that I've given to you
[55:38] and I'm gonna be there I'm never gonna
[55:41] leave you nor forsake you amen
[55:43] see upholdeth him with his hand amen
[55:47] God's holding us up tonight amen because
[55:50] we followed in the order of the Lord now
[55:55] he says contrary to many books and
[55:57] movies and seminars tell you you won't
[55:59] discover life's meaning by looking
[56:01] within yourself you would probably try
[56:05] that already you didn't create yourself
[56:08] so there's no way you can tell yourself
[56:09] what you were created for
[56:12] I like this if I handed you an invention
[56:15] you'd never seen before you wouldn't
[56:17] know its purpose and the invention
[56:19] itself wouldn't be able to tell you
[56:20] either only the creator or the owner's
[56:23] manual
[56:23] could reveal its purpose and that's what
[56:26] the Bible is church the Bible is the
[56:28] crater's manual and we're gonna find
[56:31] what God's calling us to do in this book
[56:32] right here that's right see now the
[56:36] Bible says the heart is deceitful above
[56:38] all things so see you can't look in
[56:41] yourself and what do I want my life to
[56:43] be or what do I feel like I should do
[56:45] because it's deceitfully wicked above
[56:48] all things and desperately wicked who
[56:50] can know it
[56:51] I the LORD search the heart I try the
[56:53] reigns
[56:54] I've even to give every man according to
[56:57] his ways and according to the fruit of
[56:59] his doings so your heart here as
[57:01] emotions or feelings huh me no you can't
[57:03] trust your feelings if you followed your
[57:07] feelings you'd probably go to hell is
[57:10] that right or you'd be at the bar
[57:12] tonight or in some awful relationship if
[57:15] you followed your feelings you cannot
[57:17] trust your feelings they'll deceive you
[57:20] their witness equally wicked above the
[57:24] Bible said above all things you can't
[57:26] trust your feelings so you've got to
[57:28] trust the Word of God amen
[57:30] and then God will reward according to
[57:34] the fruit or outcomes of our decisions
[57:37] so we want to make sure we we guide our
[57:40] lives not by our feelings but by the
[57:43] Word of God look at the Bible says a
[57:46] fool earth no delight in understanding
[57:49] he doesn't want to understand about the
[57:51] ways of God
[57:51] all he wants is that his heart may
[57:54] discover itself isn't that what college
[57:57] people say I'm just going to go to my
[57:59] college I would discover who I am and
[58:02] they go join a sorority and get drunk
[58:04] and yeah they're discovered who they are
[58:06] you know they're that they're the
[58:08] children of the devil you know I just
[58:11] want to discover I want to see what I
[58:13] what all I'm supposed to be and they're
[58:17] looking in the wrong place you can't
[58:19] look inside yourself you've got to look
[58:21] up see
[58:25] of fooled the lights in the wicked
[58:27] desires of his heart so see that's what
[58:33] the buy that's what Rick Ward was saying
[58:34] there that's what the Bible says you
[58:36] cannot trust your own feelings your own
[58:38] emotions you've got to look outside that
[58:41] you've got to look to God amen
[58:44] proverbs 28:26 he that trusteth in his
[58:47] own art is the fool well I'm just gonna
[58:51] like all people on Facebook say all the
[58:53] time I see him say that well I'm just
[58:54] gonna trust go with my heart feeling I'm
[58:56] gonna go with my gut you can't always go
[58:58] with your gut now if your gut lines up
[59:00] with God's Word that's good but you've
[59:03] got to always go with the word aim head
[59:05] now this in church as you become a
[59:08] Christian yes then your gut will start
[59:10] lining up more often with the word then
[59:13] your feelings your emotions will start
[59:15] lining more up with the word praise God
[59:17] but when you first start serving God if
[59:20] you're a young Christian I see a lot of
[59:22] young Christians in here right the
[59:23] children you know even though thinks you
[59:25] know sister see us she's a Christian but
[59:27] she's a young Christian you know I think
[59:29] of other you know there's some of us are
[59:31] just serving the Lord you know I had the
[59:33] young just for a few years and so we got
[59:36] we have to learn those early years you
[59:39] cannot trust your own feelings all the
[59:41] time you've got to trust the Word of God
[59:47] like I've had numerous friends I've told
[59:49] this before
[59:50] I advise them just stay with the message
[59:52] stay with the word but they they they
[59:53] leave the message and they go out too so
[59:55] denominational churches to get a husband
[59:57] or a wife or they they trust their their
[1:00:00] feelings rather than the Word of God and
[1:00:03] that's a that's a fool so the only way
[1:00:06] they'll be saved is as a foolish version
[1:00:08] right because instead of choosing the
[1:00:10] word which a wise person would do they
[1:00:13] chose the foolish thing their feelings
[1:00:15] and their only hope is the very last
[1:00:17] little bit of God's mercy at the white
[1:00:19] throne judgment we don't trust in
[1:00:23] ourselves we trust in the word now the
[1:00:26] Bible that says it plainly here blessed
[1:00:28] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:00:30] Christ who has blessed us with all
[1:00:31] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:00:33] in Christ Oh hallelujah a church aren't
[1:00:37] you glad you have all the blessings
[1:00:38] Christ we shouldn't go home discouraged
[1:00:42] tonight saying oh well I'd uh just
[1:00:44] didn't get much out of it tonight the
[1:00:45] Bible says you have all spiritual
[1:00:48] blessings
[1:00:48] you just got to receive them amen
[1:00:52] well Graham said you are given the keys
[1:00:55] to a variety store amen
[1:00:57] in other words you're giving the keys to
[1:01:00] the Amazon warehouse because we all like
[1:01:02] Amazon right and then Amazon we got too
[1:01:06] late two days but we're all given the
[1:01:08] keys to a spiritual Amazon store and
[1:01:10] whatever we have need of the Bible said
[1:01:13] all spiritual blessings are given to us
[1:01:15] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus my
[1:01:19] medicine all's you need is the faith the
[1:01:21] ladder of faith to climb up there and
[1:01:24] grab a hold of any promise of God God's
[1:01:26] given us every blessing we need amen
[1:01:29] that's the Word of God accordingly has
[1:01:32] chosen us in him where were we chosen in
[1:01:35] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:01:37] world that we should be what holy so
[1:01:41] part of our purpose is to be holy
[1:01:43] whatever God's called us to do even if
[1:01:46] we don't know what to do one thing we
[1:01:48] should do is be holy
[1:01:50] that means holy means separated
[1:01:53] dedicated consecrated we should live a
[1:01:55] separated life unto the Word of God and
[1:01:58] without blame before him in love having
[1:02:02] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:02:04] children by Jesus Christ to him to
[1:02:07] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:02:08] of his will
[1:02:10] oh my god predetermined our adoption we
[1:02:14] were not part of the family of God but
[1:02:16] God has adopted us into his family
[1:02:18] praise God and that was made him happy
[1:02:21] it was a good pleasure of his will God's
[1:02:24] good pleasure in other words God loves
[1:02:26] you Church God loves to bring you into
[1:02:30] the family of God it's his good pleasure
[1:02:32] to the praise of the glory of His grace
[1:02:34] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:02:36] beloved in whom we have redemption
[1:02:38] through his blood the forgiveness of
[1:02:40] sins according to the riches of His
[1:02:42] grace where he hath abounded all wisdom
[1:02:46] and prudence having made known unto us
[1:02:48] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:02:50] good pleasure now that's why
[1:02:52] he said good pleasure Church are you
[1:02:53] catching that God delights in his people
[1:02:56] God loves when you come to church God
[1:02:59] loves when you worship Him God loves
[1:03:01] when you pray
[1:03:01] that's God's good pleasure God loves
[1:03:03] when you turn down sin God loves it and
[1:03:06] God's God's good pleasure he delights in
[1:03:09] each one of you when we're seeking his
[1:03:10] face amen
[1:03:13] having may don't understand mystery of
[1:03:15] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:03:18] which he hath purposed in us so his will
[1:03:23] is his good pleasure and the purpose is
[1:03:26] in himself
[1:03:27] how many would know what their purpose
[1:03:29] is in life it's in Christ you're gonna
[1:03:33] find the purpose in Christ you're not
[1:03:35] gonna find it in a newspaper you're not
[1:03:38] gonna find it at the university I didn't
[1:03:41] find mine there you're not gonna find it
[1:03:43] anywhere else you are gonna find your
[1:03:45] purpose in Christ Jesus and I want to
[1:03:50] just show a few quotes here brother and
[1:03:52] said watch this carefully before there
[1:03:53] ever was a speck of Stardust before God
[1:03:56] was God God's an object of adoration no
[1:03:58] one was there to worship him so he was
[1:04:00] at that time only potentially God and he
[1:04:03] was known only as Eternal Spirit the
[1:04:06] bride was already in his mind yes she
[1:04:09] was she was existing in his thoughts and
[1:04:11] what about those thoughts of God they
[1:04:13] are eternal are they not now look now
[1:04:18] program goes to the woman at the well
[1:04:20] see seeing that we're vindicated his
[1:04:23] Messiah side showing that little
[1:04:25] prostitute who he was others who had had
[1:04:28] them thoughts in God's mind like Peter
[1:04:30] Nathaniel and all those who is in God's
[1:04:32] thinking as soon as the light flash they
[1:04:34] recognize it they didn't have to pull
[1:04:37] them up to the altar amen hallelujah
[1:04:41] call them up and beg them and tell them
[1:04:44] you'll do something for them if they
[1:04:46] would and you give them a better living
[1:04:48] and see if you could speak to the boss
[1:04:49] for a job put them in a better location
[1:04:51] they didn't care they had to fight to
[1:04:54] hold in their place he said but there's
[1:04:56] going there's nothing going to separate
[1:04:58] us the Bible said from the love of God
[1:05:00] which is in Christ peril persecution
[1:05:03] death itself can't separate us because
[1:05:05] we
[1:05:06] was always was in his thoughts amen
[1:05:10] he's showing all those people who were
[1:05:12] thoughts of God he didn't have to beg
[1:05:15] them to come to God they willingly came
[1:05:18] to God amen now I want to say this Jesus
[1:05:24] may commit your life to death as he did
[1:05:27] Paul he may commit you to suffering as
[1:05:29] he did job that is his prerogative he is
[1:05:32] sovereign but it is all with the purpose
[1:05:35] can we say already Oh everything in your
[1:05:39] life has a purpose right if you get sick
[1:05:44] there's a purpose if you get well
[1:05:47] there's a if you go through a time where
[1:05:51] you lose your job there's still a
[1:05:53] purpose for that if things are hard to
[1:05:56] the church there's still a purpose in
[1:05:59] that praise God everything has a purpose
[1:06:02] an intention God uses everything and
[1:06:06] everything is intended to do something
[1:06:09] to produce something in our lives if he
[1:06:13] did not have a purpose he'd be the
[1:06:15] author of frustration and not a peace if
[1:06:18] you feel frustrated Church that's not
[1:06:21] the thing that's not the plan of God
[1:06:23] that's your own human discouragement God
[1:06:26] does not want to frustrate you tonight
[1:06:28] God wants to encourage you tonight he's
[1:06:31] not the one who authors frustration and
[1:06:34] agony and discouragement and down in the
[1:06:37] dumps and depression
[1:06:39] he doesn't author that he authors
[1:06:41] confidence because you know all things
[1:06:44] have a purpose amen
[1:06:48] his purpose is that after we would we
[1:06:51] have suffered a while we would be made
[1:06:53] perfect be established and strengthened
[1:06:55] and settled ha ha hallelujah after every
[1:07:00] trial Church after you go through every
[1:07:02] trial what do you feel you feel stronger
[1:07:04] in Christ amen after every test after
[1:07:08] every hard battle after every discourage
[1:07:10] rep you come out of all that after you
[1:07:12] make it through and it feels like the
[1:07:14] storm has passed
[1:07:15] you should feel stronger and more stable
[1:07:18] and you should say
[1:07:20] I know I'll be ready for the next one
[1:07:22] whenever it comes because we know people
[1:07:25] in the church we talked with yesterday
[1:07:27] it seems like it just storm after storm
[1:07:29] after storm after storm right now right
[1:07:33] now you should thank God if you're not
[1:07:36] going through that God give you a
[1:07:38] six-month hiatus or a six-month rest or
[1:07:40] vacation from storms you should praise
[1:07:42] God you're walking on the mountain but
[1:07:46] there's people in our church too going
[1:07:47] through storm after sand they're not
[1:07:49] letting up and the storms keep going but
[1:07:51] see God could God had confidence that
[1:07:54] God could allow the storm to come to
[1:07:56] pass and their faith would withstand the
[1:07:58] storm amen because God promised not to
[1:08:02] give us a trial we couldn't withstand
[1:08:05] God promised that there'd always be a
[1:08:07] way out in the midst of every trial
[1:08:10] temptation there's always an exit sign
[1:08:12] there's always an escape sign and we've
[1:08:15] just got to find it and enter out
[1:08:17] through the escape or exit out through
[1:08:19] the escape and we've got to run to the
[1:08:20] strong tower Jesus Christ amen
[1:08:26] so you should feel stronger more stable
[1:08:30] and complete after you go through trials
[1:08:35] that's God's purpose that's God's
[1:08:38] intention after every trial you come out
[1:08:41] stronger than you were before that's how
[1:08:44] I feel after every trial in the church
[1:08:46] when people battle me or criticize me or
[1:08:48] come against me and they leave or
[1:08:50] whatever they do you know after that I
[1:08:52] always feel stronger like I know where
[1:08:54] I'm standing in Christ Hey because I
[1:08:57] haven't preached these things by my mind
[1:08:59] I preach it by the leadership of God
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] I get criticized for preaching God's
[1:09:05] Word hallelujah that's just that's just
[1:09:07] persecution everyone that lives godly in
[1:09:10] Christ Jesus will suffer persecution
[1:09:14] remember the Bible said to everything
[1:09:17] there's a season what season are you are
[1:09:20] in right now spiritually is it a summer
[1:09:22] season you just enjoying the beauty of
[1:09:25] God's glory you know all the fruits
[1:09:27] picked off all what a glorious time is
[1:09:29] it for if you like you're going into a
[1:09:31] cool it's cooling down a little bit
[1:09:33] is it winter you feel really cold on God
[1:09:36] when is it winter what is the light
[1:09:38] gonna shine in my spiritual life or is
[1:09:40] it spring oh it feels all fresh and new
[1:09:43] again I think I just come out of the the
[1:09:47] snowstorm the snows all melted and the
[1:09:50] buds are blooming on the tree where are
[1:09:51] you at the Bible said there's a season
[1:09:53] for everything and there's a time to
[1:09:57] every purpose under the heaven and
[1:10:00] purpose means God's pleasure there's a
[1:10:04] time for every pleasure that God is
[1:10:06] going to accomplish in your life because
[1:10:10] that's what the Bible says the Venetians
[1:10:12] 1:5 that he does all things according to
[1:10:15] his good pleasure based upon his purpose
[1:10:18] or his intention your life now here is
[1:10:24] our text we read it earlier Paul's
[1:10:26] talking about going through trials and
[1:10:28] afflictions and he said he's called us
[1:10:30] with a holy calling a court not
[1:10:32] according to our works but according to
[1:10:34] his own purpose and grace which was
[1:10:36] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[1:10:37] world began see if we want to know our
[1:10:40] purpose and God's intention why was I
[1:10:43] created a man why was I created a woman
[1:10:46] what is God's purpose for me we've got
[1:10:49] to look in Jesus Christ because the
[1:10:51] Bible said it was given us in Christ
[1:10:53] before the world began now let me let me
[1:10:56] drop this here I'm gonna preach us later
[1:10:58] or really after you become a Christian
[1:11:00] and you're really holy now you can start
[1:11:04] looking inside for your purpose because
[1:11:07] the Bible said the gifts and callings of
[1:11:10] God the gifts of God are without
[1:11:12] repentance praise God and the Bible said
[1:11:17] the gifts make room for themselves
[1:11:19] remember in proverbs so what when you
[1:11:22] first start as a young Christian if you
[1:11:24] don't know your purpose don't look
[1:11:26] inside yourself yet because if you're
[1:11:28] not born again you might start trying to
[1:11:29] do God a service but it might not be
[1:11:31] time yet like brother Simon brother
[1:11:36] Simon was I guess I've just been talking
[1:11:38] with him a lot lately
[1:11:40] he tried preaching earlier in his life
[1:11:42] and just he never got satisfied but then
[1:11:46] later
[1:11:46] years later he said he got the baptism
[1:11:48] only the Holy Ghost and now God is just
[1:11:50] opening up all these doors to go
[1:11:52] overseas and preach here and preach in
[1:11:53] Lorraine and he's preaching different
[1:11:55] places so we got to find the season or
[1:11:59] the timing there's a purpose for all of
[1:12:02] it and God's going to show it to us but
[1:12:05] we've got to go at the right time we've
[1:12:07] got to ask God God show me help me to
[1:12:10] look to you first and then once you show
[1:12:12] me let me look inside myself and see
[1:12:15] what gifts are in my life hope that's OK
[1:12:18] by the grace of the Lord that's right
[1:12:22] you're early in your life look to God
[1:12:24] and then once you get established once
[1:12:26] you get real styled you're really holy
[1:12:28] you're really living then you can start
[1:12:30] looking inside whoa I see this gift of
[1:12:32] my life I see God manifesting this in my
[1:12:34] life what is what gifts are in my life
[1:12:36] and gotta show it to you that's right
[1:12:40] now God's purpose is in here God's
[1:12:44] purpose for you is in him and it's the
[1:12:46] mystery of God's will for your life the
[1:12:50] Bible said he's made no notice the
[1:12:51] mystery of his will according to the
[1:12:53] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:12:54] himself so see God has a purpose for you
[1:13:01] but it's a mystery until he reveals it
[1:13:03] to you brother Branham says it plainly
[1:13:07] I'm gonna skip down here he quotes this
[1:13:08] scripture see the mystery of his will
[1:13:10] and the mystery of his of his will
[1:13:11] God's will is a mystery and the church
[1:13:15] said so God loves you you get saved you
[1:13:19] cry at the altar
[1:13:20] you shout you say glory hallelujah I'm a
[1:13:22] message believer but now you enter
[1:13:24] mystery mode what does God want me to do
[1:13:28] why am I on this earth why do I go to
[1:13:31] this church why do I live with this
[1:13:33] family why why do I go here it's a
[1:13:35] mystery and God lets us wonder we get
[1:13:37] all excited but then let's just wonder
[1:13:39] around for a while in mystery not sure
[1:13:41] what we're supposed to do and each man
[1:13:45] of course woman has to seek out the will
[1:13:47] of God for his or her self God's mystery
[1:13:56] now like what he says here a Rick Warren
[1:13:58] I've read many books that suggest ways
[1:14:00] to discover the purpose of my life all
[1:14:02] of them could be classified as self-help
[1:14:04] books because they approach the subject
[1:14:06] from a self-centered viewpoint in that
[1:14:08] the truth my self-help books even
[1:14:11] Christian ones offer the same
[1:14:13] predictable steps of finding your life's
[1:14:15] purpose consider your dreams clarify
[1:14:19] your values set some goals figure out
[1:14:23] what you're good at
[1:14:24] aim high go for it be disciplined
[1:14:28] believe you can achieve it involve
[1:14:31] others never give up the same nonsense
[1:14:35] all the time where does it ever say seek
[1:14:39] God fast and pray and ask God what your
[1:14:42] purpose is see it's it's self-centered
[1:14:46] what do you dream about brother Aaron
[1:14:47] what's in your dreams oh if I could do
[1:14:49] anything if I got all the money in the
[1:14:51] world I could do anything what would I
[1:14:52] do that that ridiculous it's so
[1:14:58] self-centered but it's got to be Christ
[1:15:00] centered if we're to find God's purpose
[1:15:03] he said of course these recommendations
[1:15:06] off the lead oftenly don't natural
[1:15:08] success you can usually succeed in
[1:15:10] reaching the goal if you put your mind
[1:15:12] to it
[1:15:12] but being successful fulfilling life's
[1:15:14] purpose are not at all the same issue
[1:15:17] you can reach all your personal goals
[1:15:19] becoming a raving success by the world
[1:15:22] standards and still miss the purposes
[1:15:24] for which God has created you doesn't
[1:15:27] that sound like the rich young ruler he
[1:15:30] reached all these goals so he had such a
[1:15:31] big bank account he had to build another
[1:15:33] bank to store up all his money he was so
[1:15:37] rich he reached his goals ma he was
[1:15:39] focused he met every goal he crossed it
[1:15:42] all off but that wasn't God's purpose
[1:15:45] for his life you need more than
[1:15:49] self-help advice the Bible says
[1:15:52] self-help is no help at all
[1:15:53] self-sacrifice is the way my way to
[1:15:57] finding yourself your true self and he
[1:16:01] says this is not a self-help book it's
[1:16:03] not about finding the right career
[1:16:04] achieving your dreams or planning your
[1:16:06] life it's not about how to cram more
[1:16:08] activities into overload
[1:16:10] actually it will teach you to do less in
[1:16:12] this life by focusing on what matters
[1:16:16] most it is about becoming what God
[1:16:19] created you to be so when you find your
[1:16:22] purpose in life you'll actually do less
[1:16:25] because it's Satan's tactic to try to
[1:16:27] get you to do too much that you spread
[1:16:29] yourself too thin and you can't actually
[1:16:31] do what God's called you to do help me
[1:16:36] know what Jesus said if you love your
[1:16:37] father mother more than me you're not
[1:16:39] worthy of me either love a son or
[1:16:42] daughter more than me is not worthy me
[1:16:43] he taketh not his cross and follow that
[1:16:46] for me is not worthy of me a cross is a
[1:16:49] slow death if you really love God you're
[1:16:52] slowly dying every day trying to follow
[1:16:54] his footsteps he that findeth his life
[1:16:58] shall lose it and he that loses his life
[1:17:02] for my sake shall find it how to do so
[1:17:07] you must lose your natural desires your
[1:17:10] feelings your your dreams your goals you
[1:17:13] must lose those in order to find Christ
[1:17:16] that's one quote that was actually good
[1:17:19] from the world
[1:17:20] I learned this quote from rocky those
[1:17:21] Rocky movies when the before I was a
[1:17:23] Christian rocky lost a fight and they
[1:17:25] said sometimes you got to lose to win
[1:17:26] and I and I used to quote that all the
[1:17:29] time before I came in the message I
[1:17:30] thought once I came the message I
[1:17:32] realize it's true we must lose our
[1:17:35] desires in order to gain Jesus Christ
[1:17:38] and it's harder to lose friends it's
[1:17:41] hard to lose family members it's hard to
[1:17:43] lose support or kind words it's hard to
[1:17:46] lose that but when you lose it you
[1:17:48] actually gain the favor of Jesus that's
[1:17:51] right you must lose in order to win you
[1:17:56] must lose everything into your desires
[1:17:58] every all your plans you must lose that
[1:18:01] in order to find Christ how then do you
[1:18:06] discover the purpose you're created for
[1:18:07] he says you only have two options your
[1:18:09] first option is speculation this is what
[1:18:12] most people choose they guess they
[1:18:14] theorize people say well I always
[1:18:17] thought life is like this this is the
[1:18:20] best yes I can come up with can I say
[1:18:24] real plainly Church I don't want anyone
[1:18:26] to guess well I guess God wants me to
[1:18:28] pray for the sick I guess God wants me
[1:18:32] to come to church I guess God wants me
[1:18:34] to pray longer I guess God was we
[1:18:37] shouldn't be guessing we should know our
[1:18:39] God wants us to do amen I guess God
[1:18:43] wants me to have a gift of wisdom I
[1:18:45] guess God wants me to give a prophecy or
[1:18:48] interpretation of tongues I guess God
[1:18:50] wants me to preach the gospel I guess
[1:18:52] God wants me to it's not a guess so it's
[1:18:55] not a home so it's a no so amen
[1:18:57] hallelujah we should know what God has
[1:19:01] called us to do and that's where I know
[1:19:05] this church can use a can use some help
[1:19:08] and the church said I can say Amen I
[1:19:11] want everyone in the church there's half
[1:19:13] an hour can you be there I want everyone
[1:19:17] in the church be able to say I know what
[1:19:19] God wants me to do in this church it's
[1:19:22] not just to come to church and pay your
[1:19:24] tithes and that's good and sing and
[1:19:26] worship that's good but there's
[1:19:28] something more than that there's a
[1:19:30] greater purpose God has for you than
[1:19:32] that that's part of it that's part of
[1:19:35] the word but there's gifts lying in your
[1:19:37] life there's purposes there's things you
[1:19:40] can do that other people can do and God
[1:19:44] wants you to root or discover those
[1:19:45] through his spirit see most people
[1:19:49] speculate well voices wanted to do this
[1:19:52] I've always wanted to preach so maybe
[1:19:53] I'll preach I never said that I never
[1:19:56] wanted to preach I never even thought
[1:19:57] I'd be a preacher so I came the message
[1:19:59] and then Tim Myers told me I bang I was
[1:20:02] texting today and I thought of you and I
[1:20:04] said I told him I said thank you for
[1:20:06] being such a fireball because when we
[1:20:08] first came to the message he was more of
[1:20:10] a fireball than I was he was so on fire
[1:20:12] I looked at him and I just get excited
[1:20:14] about Jesus just by looking at Tim
[1:20:15] Meyers so I thank them today for being
[1:20:18] such a fireball I said we wouldn't be
[1:20:20] where we are without you there wouldn't
[1:20:21] be a church and a car without Tim Meyers
[1:20:23] that's right that was part of his
[1:20:25] purpose in life and he looked at me and
[1:20:28] said Jesse you need to preach the gospel
[1:20:29] God's called you to preach and I never
[1:20:31] even preached yet but he saw in me a
[1:20:34] gift of preach because I love the word I
[1:20:37] was witnessing all the
[1:20:38] I was doing Bible studies I was writing
[1:20:39] on every scripture so I could memorize
[1:20:41] it and share it
[1:20:42] he saw to me before I even saw it but
[1:20:46] see we can't speculate about it we've
[1:20:48] got to know about it amen now he says
[1:20:51] fortunately there's an alternative to
[1:20:53] speculation about the meaning and
[1:20:55] purpose of life it's revelation see
[1:20:58] that's what I told you this is inspired
[1:21:02] speculation is not going to know your
[1:21:04] purpose in life it's revelation right
[1:21:07] the gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[1:21:09] your speculation you're guessing no it's
[1:21:12] your revelation we can turn to God I'm
[1:21:16] sorry we can turn to what God has
[1:21:18] revealed about his life or our life in
[1:21:21] his word these is ways discover the
[1:21:23] purpose of an invention is to ask the
[1:21:24] creator of it the same is true for
[1:21:27] discovering Lord your life's purpose ask
[1:21:29] God isn't that awesome and that glorious
[1:21:34] it's not why don't you just reach for
[1:21:36] your dreams and and shoot for the stars
[1:21:38] because even if you don't do it you'll
[1:21:40] land at the moon that sounds so pretty
[1:21:44] but it's so foolish we are the moon past
[1:21:51] the moon Marrissa past the milky white
[1:21:53] way into the seventh dimension amen and
[1:21:56] that's where the throne of Christ is
[1:21:59] hallelujah so it's not guessing is that
[1:22:03] speculation it's revelation Church which
[1:22:08] one of us has really really asked God
[1:22:10] Lord what do you want me to do and
[1:22:12] really take in time to listen afterwards
[1:22:14] which means like fast and pray devoted
[1:22:17] day a church we get so busy Satan tries
[1:22:20] to get us so busy in the message we
[1:22:21] hardly have any time to listen to God
[1:22:23] but I know businessmen that are in
[1:22:26] denominations brother Aaron and they'll
[1:22:28] take two or three days off just to go
[1:22:30] hear from God Church what could the
[1:22:33] Bride of Christ fellowship do if we
[1:22:35] would take two or three days off to hear
[1:22:37] from God what would we do we've got the
[1:22:39] message
[1:22:40] Cory aha but see saying gets us so busy
[1:22:45] and we forget about seeking God brother
[1:22:47] Branham would weeks off church
[1:22:50] weeks off and go up in the mountains and
[1:22:53] study and pray and wait on the Lord to
[1:22:57] get inspiration that's where God would
[1:22:59] meet him with the sword right marriage
[1:23:01] in divorce
[1:23:02] statute Rubert man he got static to
[1:23:04] perfect men he said sitting with his
[1:23:06] back against a tree and with a notepad
[1:23:08] and pen
[1:23:09] he drew he called the skeleton the
[1:23:11] triangle he drew that sitting and he
[1:23:14] said the squirrels were chattering and
[1:23:15] everything like that and that's where it
[1:23:17] got statue pervert man and so if we want
[1:23:22] to know we've got to take maybe a day
[1:23:25] off take a day off for work and just
[1:23:26] pray and seek God fast brother Jesse
[1:23:30] have you done that yes I have I fasted
[1:23:34] and prayed and before I preached your
[1:23:36] brother Brooks is the first time I
[1:23:37] fasted and prayed for a couple days
[1:23:40] then I preached you then God answered my
[1:23:41] prayer that I knew I was called to be a
[1:23:42] preacher but see you gotta ask God the
[1:23:46] right way not five-minute prayer say God
[1:23:48] what do you want me to do all right
[1:23:50] let's head off the Worker notes
[1:23:51] let's go fellowship let's go - lets go -
[1:23:53] Wendy's you know you got to really want
[1:23:57] to know you've got to really seek the
[1:23:59] face of God how many believe that you
[1:24:04] got to seek God's face and that means
[1:24:07] get out of ever you got out of for me
[1:24:08] get out of Facebook right get out of
[1:24:10] anything get out the internet just see
[1:24:12] God's face and I do that now but the
[1:24:18] writer said ask God well that's what
[1:24:20] Paul did after he met Jesus he was see
[1:24:23] this is what it is church trembling you
[1:24:25] got a tremble and say Lord what will you
[1:24:26] have me to do well it wasn't just a
[1:24:29] quick question he was trembling in the
[1:24:31] Friends of God and member Wednesday
[1:24:33] brother and remember that Wednesday when
[1:24:34] Motorama said the bride should tremble
[1:24:36] at the stay at the Lord remember that
[1:24:38] brother Ram said we used to tremble at
[1:24:40] the state the Lord but we don't anymore
[1:24:43] he said you have to travel that's it
[1:24:45] look he's trembling and boy what were
[1:24:48] you happy to do and Jesus tells them
[1:24:50] arise go in this city that shall be told
[1:24:52] thee what I must do
[1:24:55] honey new you see we got the tremble we
[1:24:58] got to be insincere we've got to be
[1:25:00] honest before God and then God will show
[1:25:03] us what to do
[1:25:05] ask and be willing to wait for the
[1:25:07] answer and I remember before I preached
[1:25:11] that first time I was I was behind the
[1:25:14] pulpit and I was right by that baptismal
[1:25:17] pool in Lima and I was shaking like a
[1:25:19] leaf
[1:25:20] I've never shake like that in my life
[1:25:21] and I'm praying God show me vindicate if
[1:25:24] I'm supposed to preach and I went out
[1:25:26] there and Karen gave a prophecy before I
[1:25:27] even preached and then after I preached
[1:25:29] the whole altar was filled with people
[1:25:31] that's when I knew I was called to
[1:25:32] preach because I prayed and fasted two
[1:25:35] days I shook and trembled like a leaf
[1:25:38] ask God to vindicate it God vindicate it
[1:25:40] now there's no more doubts amen so I
[1:25:44] know what this means you got to ask God
[1:25:45] you got to humble yourself
[1:25:46] we have to keep humbling myself for the
[1:25:49] next step of God in my life
[1:25:52] now look what Jesus said this is another
[1:25:55] passage where Paul's telling us he said
[1:25:58] I'm Jesus whom thou persecute us but
[1:26:00] rice Tanith on the upon my feet for I've
[1:26:02] appeared on thee for this purpose to be
[1:26:06] a minister and a witness both of these
[1:26:10] things which I was seen of those things
[1:26:12] in which I will appear unto thee
[1:26:14] delivering me from the people and from
[1:26:17] the Gentiles under whom now I send thee
[1:26:19] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[1:26:21] darkness to light and from the power of
[1:26:23] Satan unto God that they may receive
[1:26:24] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[1:26:27] among them which are sanctified by faith
[1:26:29] that is in me amen oh yeah Jesus said
[1:26:34] your purpose is two reasons you're gonna
[1:26:36] be a minister and you're gonna be a
[1:26:38] witness of me he's got two purposes
[1:26:42] Minister to preach and then to be a
[1:26:44] witness to testify before people a
[1:26:47] witness that Jesus Christ is alive
[1:26:49] Amen that's beautiful
[1:27:03] when you get the Holy Ghost you'll be
[1:27:04] witnesses unto Jerusalem Judea and all
[1:27:06] of all the all the ends of the earth
[1:27:08] right so everybody knows you're called
[1:27:10] to this well Jesse what's my purpose why
[1:27:12] no that's one of them witness be a
[1:27:15] witness right glory now look at this now
[1:27:24] this scripture proves you and I should
[1:27:26] live with such purpose or intention for
[1:27:29] the Jose you should know your purpose so
[1:27:31] much that you're closest believing
[1:27:34] friends know your purpose
[1:27:35] I very much should listen live so close
[1:27:39] to God that you know my purpose in life
[1:27:43] bang knows Jesse is called to do this
[1:27:45] this decision and that's what I don't
[1:27:48] know about every one of you you want to
[1:27:51] know that you need to know what I'm
[1:27:53] going to do and I need to know what
[1:27:54] you're called to do because look Paul
[1:27:57] says but they shall proceed no further
[1:27:58] those people that were the the last days
[1:28:01] were lovers of themselves more than
[1:28:02] lovers of God for their father shall be
[1:28:05] manifest in all men as theirs was also
[1:28:07] but thou has to fully know my doctrine
[1:28:10] my manner of life you should see how I
[1:28:12] live purpose faith long-suffering
[1:28:16] charity and patience
[1:28:18] Timothy watch Paul Timothy was around
[1:28:21] Paul so much he could look at him and
[1:28:24] say I know what that guy's purpose is in
[1:28:25] life he's a minister and a witness hey
[1:28:29] hey oh yeah he knew he knew he watched
[1:28:34] Paul so much he knew Paul's doctrine he
[1:28:36] knew Paul's manner of life his purpose
[1:28:38] his faith is long-suffering charity
[1:28:41] patience his persecutions afflictions he
[1:28:44] knew all about Paul but it one thing
[1:28:46] that he knew that's important for
[1:28:48] tonight it's his purpose in life and
[1:28:53] that's what I want you to know at the
[1:28:54] end of this series maybe you'll know
[1:28:56] tonight that be glorious that I can know
[1:29:00] what God has called Malachi to do and
[1:29:03] Malachi can know what God's called me to
[1:29:06] do I can know Lydia's purpose in life
[1:29:09] would that be powerful like programs
[1:29:14] you got thus saith the Lord member he
[1:29:15] said it takes all the spooks out all the
[1:29:19] fear all the guessing all the wandering
[1:29:22] all all the the questions all the doubt
[1:29:24] Satan tries to put in you what are you
[1:29:26] here for are you even do you even have a
[1:29:28] purpose you're just wait you're useless
[1:29:30] you're not doing anything for the church
[1:29:31] we've got to tell the devil to shut up
[1:29:34] and and we're not gonna believe his lies
[1:29:36] we all have an intent God has an intent
[1:29:40] for our lives God wants to do something
[1:29:43] with us hallelujah who would have
[1:29:49] thought when I was caressed his age your
[1:29:51] Haven we would have thought when my mom
[1:29:53] was dragging me to church nothing oh
[1:29:54] they're not dragged to church but I was
[1:29:56] who would have thought that my mother
[1:30:00] dragging me to church and I'd be the
[1:30:02] leader of a church one day who would
[1:30:03] have thought that well God did God God
[1:30:08] knew my purpose and revealed it to me I
[1:30:11] was always the last one to want to go to
[1:30:13] church and I was always the first one
[1:30:15] out of church so I go in the car listen
[1:30:16] to rap and rock and roll music now I'm
[1:30:19] the first one to church and the last one
[1:30:21] to leave
[1:30:22] that's God's purpose for me that's what
[1:30:25] he's called me to do I didn't see it I
[1:30:28] didn't know it but God's called me to it
[1:30:30] it's a holy calling and I should live
[1:30:34] with such a purpose now your closest
[1:30:37] believing friends know your purpose
[1:30:45] God is not just the starting point of
[1:30:48] your life he is the source of it I like
[1:30:51] that
[1:30:52] to discover your purpose in life you
[1:30:54] must turn to God's Word see this is a
[1:30:57] lot of this is good not the world's
[1:30:59] wisdom you must build your life on
[1:31:01] eternal truths not pop psychology
[1:31:04] success motivation or inspirational
[1:31:06] stories this is not Chicken Soup for
[1:31:08] your soul right I'll say like this this
[1:31:11] is ego food for your soul the Word of
[1:31:14] God is Eagle food for an eagle soul the
[1:31:19] and then he quotes Ephesians 1:1 now
[1:31:23] ready read it now how many want a
[1:31:27] peaceful life how many don't want to how
[1:31:30] many want to not battle discouragement
[1:31:33] and frustration life how many want peace
[1:31:34] in your life the Bible says when you
[1:31:37] walk after the spirit
[1:31:39] instead of being carnally minded which
[1:31:41] is frustration anger and fear and
[1:31:44] bitterness that's enemy against God for
[1:31:48] it's not I'm sorry but to be spiritually
[1:31:50] minded is life and peace don't you want
[1:31:56] to wake up every day and say I have
[1:31:58] peace with God I know what I'm doing
[1:32:01] what God wants me to do I feel the peace
[1:32:03] of God right the life of God is in my
[1:32:09] heart and I know I'm I'm excited about
[1:32:12] the future I'm excited to know what
[1:32:14] God's calling me to do it although I go
[1:32:16] through trials and people persecute me
[1:32:18] for what I do I have peace with God and
[1:32:20] I have life I have strengthened to it
[1:32:23] because I know God's called me to it
[1:32:25] amen glory you see when we walk in a
[1:32:31] carnal mind we can't obey the law of God
[1:32:34] when we're doubting and fearful and
[1:32:37] upset and angry at God or something like
[1:32:40] that or angry at other people you cannot
[1:32:42] submit to the will of God you cannot do
[1:32:45] the long
[1:32:47] odd unless you've got it which is a
[1:32:50] transform mind hallelujah
[1:32:54] so life and peace comes through
[1:32:56] spiritual thinking which is word
[1:32:57] thinking now I'm getting down to the
[1:33:01] close here my goodness that's 45 minutes
[1:33:03] already so he ends the first chapter by
[1:33:06] saying you discover your identity and
[1:33:08] purpose through a relationship with
[1:33:10] Jesus Christ that's true I don't know
[1:33:12] how many believe that if you don't have
[1:33:14] such relationship I'll explain later how
[1:33:16] did you begin to run well acts 2:38 told
[1:33:19] us how to do that that's right
[1:33:22] number two God was thinking of you long
[1:33:25] before you ever thought about him praise
[1:33:29] God his purpose for your life predates
[1:33:33] your conception in other words before
[1:33:35] you were conceived in your mother's womb
[1:33:36] he was thinking about you he planned it
[1:33:39] before you existed without your input he
[1:33:41] didn't ask you what you wanted to be
[1:33:42] when you grew up what do you want to be
[1:33:45] Jose when you grow up God didn't ask you
[1:33:46] God said I'd know it I want him to be
[1:33:49] when he grows up he's going to be this
[1:33:51] you may choose your career your spouse
[1:33:54] your hobbies and many other parts of
[1:33:56] your life but you don't get to choose
[1:33:57] your purpose and that's true you don't
[1:34:01] get to choose God has given you a
[1:34:03] purpose now this is I just want to lay
[1:34:07] this thought in here because this will
[1:34:08] this will cause you to go a little
[1:34:10] deeper in the Bible God gives you and I
[1:34:14] some choices on our own there's 45
[1:34:18] minutes remember Jesus says there's only
[1:34:22] one we've said on Sunday yesterday
[1:34:24] yesterday mine there's only one cause
[1:34:28] for remarriage and that's a a woman that
[1:34:30] did not confess fornication to her
[1:34:33] husband before they got married he can
[1:34:34] divorce her and get remarried that's the
[1:34:36] only case for remarriage and then Peter
[1:34:39] says Peter says mines it's good that men
[1:34:43] don't marry because it's so C that's
[1:34:46] before they had the Holy Ghost but he
[1:34:49] said all men cannot receive this say
[1:34:50] save they to whom it's given now this is
[1:34:54] what Jesus says there are some choices
[1:34:56] that God leaves up to us right
[1:35:01] now he knows what we're going to choose
[1:35:02] or there's some choices God gives up
[1:35:05] leads up to us
[1:35:07] Luca verse 12 for there are some eunuchs
[1:35:10] now eunuch is a person who's willingly
[1:35:12] abstains from marriage
[1:35:14] Jesus says sir some eunuchs which were
[1:35:17] so born from their mother's womb so see
[1:35:21] that's that's God's calling God called
[1:35:25] them to be a eunuch they came out of the
[1:35:27] womb and God had called them you're not
[1:35:29] supposed to marry who's that st. Paul
[1:35:31] praise God
[1:35:34] so Jesus says some people like st. Paul
[1:35:37] when they were born they were there
[1:35:39] there's no desire to get married they're
[1:35:42] born to be single but now Jesus says
[1:35:45] which he said but there are some which
[1:35:49] were made eunuchs of men so that the the
[1:35:52] preachers in their lives or the men
[1:35:54] their lives encouraged them you know
[1:35:55] it'd be better you could serve God
[1:35:57] better if you didn't get married and so
[1:36:01] this okay I'll just take my dad's advice
[1:36:03] or I'll I'll take the pastor's advice or
[1:36:06] I'll take the prophets advice and I
[1:36:07] won't get married and still and there be
[1:36:12] eunuchs which have made themselves
[1:36:13] eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake
[1:36:15] so nobody told them to do it they just
[1:36:18] said I want to be single for God's sake
[1:36:21] and Jesus said he that's able to receive
[1:36:24] it let him receive it
[1:36:25] praise God so then I understand there's
[1:36:28] some choices in life that God gives you
[1:36:30] the choice but there's some things you
[1:36:35] were born to do and you don't have a
[1:36:37] choice on it and it's a good thing
[1:36:40] because your choices and my choices are
[1:36:42] usually wrong
[1:36:44] hallelujah because your feelings and
[1:36:47] your intentions are usually deceitfully
[1:36:49] wicked above all things but there are
[1:36:54] some things that God gives you a choice
[1:36:56] on like marriage now pastors don't
[1:37:02] really have a choice because they're a
[1:37:04] pastor has to be a man who's the husband
[1:37:06] of one wife till he's called from the
[1:37:10] womb to get married and have children
[1:37:12] because he can't leave the house of God
[1:37:14] unless
[1:37:15] he has his own children under subjection
[1:37:21] now no you must do the will of God how
[1:37:24] we know that you must do the will of God
[1:37:25] to be saved that's why I thought was
[1:37:27] inspired that Rick Warren said that you
[1:37:30] don't have a choice on your purpose if
[1:37:32] you want to be saved you have to do the
[1:37:35] will of God because Jesus says not
[1:37:38] everyone that says Lord Lord will enter
[1:37:39] the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth
[1:37:41] the will of my father which is in heaven
[1:37:46] so what is the foolish virgins and the
[1:37:48] foolish virgin is a person who does the
[1:37:51] will of God but it doesn't go all the
[1:37:53] way with it because they don't get born
[1:37:55] again they should have got born again
[1:37:57] but they did get born again and so
[1:38:00] they're a fool but they still get saved
[1:38:03] so they still do the will of God they
[1:38:06] just didn't do all of it
[1:38:07] Oh Church we don't want to be that way
[1:38:09] doing we don't want to come a little
[1:38:11] short of the goal how many one have
[1:38:13] achieved the goal I don't want to come
[1:38:17] this close again the rapture then miss
[1:38:19] it and then go to the tribulation I want
[1:38:21] to press through an hour to just I want
[1:38:23] to blow right past the finish slide I
[1:38:26] don't want to pass out brother bang ran
[1:38:28] ran a marathon and you need to pass out
[1:38:30] did you bang you finished right well it
[1:38:32] was that a couple years ago okay 2014
[1:38:38] 2014 bang practiced apparently unless
[1:38:44] you had a really good endurance before
[1:38:45] he practiced he practice and made sure
[1:38:47] he did what was required in order to
[1:38:50] finish the race and that's what we want
[1:38:52] to do we don't just want to guess and
[1:38:55] try to think we're doing what's right we
[1:38:56] want to do God's will and we want to
[1:38:59] cross the line that we want to finish
[1:39:00] the race and we want to reward
[1:39:02] that's incorruptible amen these worldly
[1:39:07] people they they earn trophies and
[1:39:09] prizes and it fades away it rusts it
[1:39:11] falls to the ground their money when
[1:39:13] they die goes to other people but when
[1:39:15] you do God's will you get a crown that
[1:39:17] will endure forever amen honey oh yeah
[1:39:22] you don't have a perp you don't have a
[1:39:24] choice in your purpose you have to do
[1:39:25] God's will and church we love we love
[1:39:29] knowing we love that because that's
[1:39:30] what's best for us we feel we that's the
[1:39:33] only place where we feel safe for the
[1:39:35] Jose is in God's will for our lives
[1:39:37] outside if I stop preaching I feel
[1:39:39] really uncomfortable if I stop making
[1:39:41] videos if I stop writing about God if I
[1:39:44] stop studying the word I feel really
[1:39:46] awful like when I go for two weeks
[1:39:48] without preaching I feel really strange
[1:39:52] so he ends a chapter by saying the
[1:39:54] purpose of your life fits into a much
[1:39:56] larger cosmic purpose that God has
[1:39:59] designed for eternity that's what this
[1:40:01] book is all about and that's scriptural
[1:40:03] because look though God's purpose isn't
[1:40:05] just temporary for you it's eternal to
[1:40:10] the intent there's purpose to the
[1:40:12] purpose that now unto the principalities
[1:40:14] and powers and heavenly places might be
[1:40:16] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[1:40:19] of God so it's God's purpose that you
[1:40:21] will know all his wisdom according to
[1:40:25] the eternal unending purpose which he
[1:40:29] has purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in
[1:40:34] whom we have boldness and access with
[1:40:37] confidence by the faith of him see God's
[1:40:42] God's motives God's objectives God's
[1:40:45] intents God's will God's purposes
[1:40:47] they're all eternal because the Bible
[1:40:50] said it's an eternal purpose
[1:40:52] that's what program said right but man
[1:40:54] said whatever you hear that's what
[1:40:56] you'll be the hare amen hallelujah
[1:41:00] I want to be a Holy Ghost field say I
[1:41:02] want to be a devil casting out Holy
[1:41:04] Ghost field site I want to be a
[1:41:06] sanctified saying and that means I'll be
[1:41:08] a sanctified Holy Ghost field st. over
[1:41:10] there amen hallelujah glory brother Ram
[1:41:18] said the man that rules over Nations
[1:41:21] will be able to handle every situation
[1:41:22] let me see if I can find that quote I
[1:41:28] think it was handled
[1:41:36] no I spelled it wrong there was every
[1:41:44] situation now how many want to do that
[1:41:47] church how many want to be able to
[1:41:49] handle every situation I think it was
[1:41:52] powerfully I'm gonna be real
[1:41:57] disappointed if I don't come up ah just
[1:42:01] a minute Aaron
[1:42:03] the church age book I just what quoted
[1:42:05] it and put it on Facebook well let's not
[1:42:07] hand off hey its handling no okay well
[1:42:16] he talked about the rod of iron he that
[1:42:18] overcomes will I give the rod of iron
[1:42:21] that will rule over the nation's and he
[1:42:23] said that kind of person has to so
[1:42:26] powerfully deal with every situation
[1:42:28] that means you're not scared when you
[1:42:30] have conflict Church it means you're not
[1:42:32] scared when someone comes against you
[1:42:34] and someone's upset with you or
[1:42:36] someone's accusing you of wrong you
[1:42:38] don't get scared you're able to handle
[1:42:40] with God's divine love I see it all the
[1:42:43] time don't you like when I've been going
[1:42:45] to see my friend at the hospital he has
[1:42:47] family members there and they custody
[1:42:49] and I've got a handle that situation I
[1:42:51] can't laugh at that so I've got to just
[1:42:53] turn my face and look the other way
[1:42:55] or I've got to change the subject you've
[1:42:58] got to handle every situation if they're
[1:43:00] saying oh it's doom and gloom is doom
[1:43:02] and gloom its doom and gloom you've got
[1:43:04] to stand there and say let's have faith
[1:43:05] amen
[1:43:06] you've got to handle the situation
[1:43:09] powerfully handle it let me see if I can
[1:43:12] quote rod of iron I've got to find this
[1:43:15] quote if I could just spell it right
[1:43:21] I'll probably find it I can spell of
[1:43:24] right whether the bang if I could just
[1:43:28] spell of right yeah there it is ah it's
[1:43:34] not handle it's cope
[1:43:36] there it is here let's read us now can I
[1:43:39] get a full screen on here yeah okay he's
[1:43:43] an overcome and then keep my works
[1:43:44] that's so small I'm sorry
[1:43:46] that make it larger no sorry it's going
[1:43:55] to be small he said
[1:43:57] he that overcometh and keepeth my works
[1:43:59] unto the end it is very evident from the
[1:44:01] remarks of the spear on works that the
[1:44:03] Lord is trying to get his own to see his
[1:44:05] opinion of righteous works four times he
[1:44:08] mentions works and now he says that he
[1:44:11] who keeps doing his works faithfully
[1:44:13] until the end will be given power over
[1:44:15] nations and will be this and a strong
[1:44:18] who wants to be strong here strong who
[1:44:21] wants to be capable I mean you have the
[1:44:24] ability to do this unbending ruler who
[1:44:29] can cope so powerfully with any
[1:44:32] situation amen
[1:44:35] is that what brother Ram tried to do he
[1:44:38] tried to so powerfully deal with every
[1:44:40] situation brother Wade eyes when he's
[1:44:43] preaching right he dies and his wife
[1:44:46] passes out program said calm yourselves
[1:44:48] be still he prays for me said I called
[1:44:50] that spirit back in the name it ceases
[1:44:52] ha ha ha hey man now God showed him to
[1:44:58] do that right cuz he does it no man can
[1:45:00] do that God does God leads us to do all
[1:45:02] these works but he was he had such a
[1:45:04] peace that he could hear the Holy Spirit
[1:45:06] tell him to call the spirit back he can
[1:45:10] handle every situation now even the most
[1:45:13] desperate enemy will be broken if need
[1:45:16] be
[1:45:17] this is the person that God gives the
[1:45:20] rod of iron to rule the nation's that
[1:45:23] means when your families make them funny
[1:45:25] are your families singing about Santa
[1:45:28] Claus
[1:45:28] you don't sing alone or your Santa your
[1:45:32] and your families breaking out the beer
[1:45:33] or the champagne you don't drink it and
[1:45:36] you leave the room and the church said
[1:45:39] hopefully that won't be you tonight
[1:45:41] hopefully you might have plans
[1:45:43] afterwards but if you are if you go to
[1:45:46] church remember you need to be unbending
[1:45:48] and you can cope powerfully with every
[1:45:51] situation because jesus said when you
[1:45:53] get the Holy Ghost its power power glory
[1:46:00] like one time a family member of mine
[1:46:02] tried to get me excited that they're
[1:46:04] getting married for a third time that's
[1:46:07] a lot of pressure they said
[1:46:10] someone just bought me a ring and we're
[1:46:12] getting married Jesse and church the
[1:46:16] Holy Ghost took over and I'd even met I
[1:46:18] just said oh we love you so much we're
[1:46:21] praying for you and and we're just so
[1:46:23] thankful you're in our family anyway uh
[1:46:27] and they were so disappointed they
[1:46:30] called somebody else in my family to say
[1:46:32] did you not understand and know that I
[1:46:35] understood but I didn't agree to it I
[1:46:39] tried to deal with that so powerfully
[1:46:41] and not give my approval to that I felt
[1:46:44] the power of God just come over me and I
[1:46:46] didn't fear I just said that I said well
[1:46:48] we love you and we're gonna pray for you
[1:46:50] and all these things I never I never
[1:46:52] would have compromise with sin I want to
[1:46:55] just stay away from sin let me try to
[1:46:59] close yeah I'll just close to this here
[1:47:02] I got a whole lot more
[1:47:05] I prepared so it's kind of comforting to
[1:47:07] know I got some more to preach Wednesday
[1:47:08] but I'll keep studying but just let's
[1:47:12] just and our feet here remember each the
[1:47:14] Bible's has all these purposes for Bible
[1:47:16] characters humming no David's purpose in
[1:47:20] life you know what the Bible literally
[1:47:22] said his purpose was Nathan was going to
[1:47:24] correct a member about Bathsheba and he
[1:47:28] says I'm sorry Nathan was going to
[1:47:30] correct him because Nathan said do
[1:47:31] whatever in your heart build the temple
[1:47:32] David and the Holy Spirit said no he's
[1:47:35] not gonna do whatever no he said
[1:47:39] therefore thou shalt saying to my
[1:47:41] servant David thus saith the Lord of
[1:47:42] hosts

[1:47:45] falling sheep to do what what's Davis
[1:47:46] purpose in life to be a ruler over my

[1:48:03] when he first became king of Hebron
[1:48:04] thirty 15 years he went through hell on
[1:48:10] earth and I'm not cussing I'm just
[1:48:12] saying that's what the Bible says as he
[1:48:15] said I went it went down like to the
[1:48:16] depths of hell if I go down the depths
[1:48:17] of hell you're there 15

[1:48:43] the author of order God had to allow
[1:48:47] these trials in his life in order to
[1:48:50] make him the right kind of ruler that he
[1:48:54] wouldn't be a Saul type of ruler he'd be
[1:48:57] a ruler that was after the heart of God

[1:50:55] ordained to be a prophet to the nation's
[1:50:57] God has not just called me to Israel God
[1:51:00] has called me to be a prophet to many
[1:51:02] nations ordained means a sign you're
[1:51:07] assigned to this job you're gonna be a
[1:51:09] prophet to many nations Jesus Christ he
[1:51:13] was he was born to save the people from
[1:51:16] their sins for this purpose the Son of
[1:51:22] God was manifested the purpose that he
[1:51:24] might destroy the works of the devil
[1:51:26] we all like that oh god help me to
[1:51:29] destroy something but the way he
[1:51:31] destroyed it was through himself dying
[1:51:34] in church many times that's what our
[1:51:37] purpose is we'll find our purpose
[1:51:39] through taking up our cross and serving
[1:51:42] other people when it doesn't seem like
[1:51:44] they deserve it did any of us deserve
[1:51:47] Jesus's suffering that he did for us did
[1:51:49] any of us deserve it no he destroyed
[1:51:54] death through death the Bible said he
[1:51:58] accomplished his purpose through the
[1:52:00] difficult task of the Cross that's how
[1:52:05] he destroyed the works of the devil by
[1:52:08] paying for all the sin and then the
[1:52:10] righteousness of God could come upon us
[1:52:11] because God's laws finally been met

[1:56:03] of the Holy Spirit that we should have
[1:56:04] in our church your prophet says it many
[1:56:09] times all nine gifts should be here but
[1:56:13] lower we gotta be trustworthy with those
[1:56:15] gifts and it has to be the season for
[1:56:17] those gifts we want to know what you
[1:56:21] place in our lives if it's a gift that
[1:56:23] we didn't ask for and we don't deserve
[1:56:25] it you just gave it to us and we just
[1:56:27] have to accept it but God first before

[2:13:29] my body feels I feel what the owner
[2:13:35] Inglorious to God I know he healed me
[2:13:45] the day at 9:00 at 3:00 about 3 o clock
[2:13:51] in the morning I have a dream I usually
[2:13:59] don't drink too much and most of the
[2:14:06] time most of the time when I have a
[2:14:08] dream I feel that right away but this
[2:14:11] one I didn't forget for some reason am i
[2:14:16] doing
[2:14:17] I saw myself playing a guitar and
[2:14:20] singing a song and I was so happy I wake
[2:14:27] up it could be like a 315 maybe I was
[2:14:31] not too long I fall asleep again and I
[2:14:35] have the same dream
[2:14:39] but the amazing thing is in the in in
[2:14:42] the dreams I had a book the song of
[2:14:46] praise and worship and then my dream I
[2:14:49] saw much something and I say today
[2:14:51] George I'm going to sing the song 326 on
[2:14:57] the book two times my witness a cup I
[2:15:01] mean that day at dinner time I talked to
[2:15:07] my wife and my daughter
[2:15:08] and this morning early this morning I
[2:15:10] have a couple dreams but I'm going to
[2:15:15] check right now about those dream
[2:15:17] because I saw my doing the number the
[2:15:22] Sun and the title of the song and how I
[2:15:26] sing it and I told the computer at night
[2:15:30] look at Psalm number 326 and the book of
[2:15:34] worship and when I saw the title I just
[2:15:38] say praise God because that was the same
[2:15:42] number and the same sound I doing early
[2:15:47] in the morning to time and the title of
[2:15:50] the song is I was chosen from God and I
[2:15:57] think that was a confirmation about my
[2:16:02] dreams
[2:16:02] yes I think it was a confirmation and
[2:16:06] but also I had to say this is this dream
[2:16:10] has a double confirmation I was thinking
[2:16:15] about that today and I I say this
[2:16:21] audible confirmation because yesterday
[2:16:25] when we had the service here in the
[2:16:27] church I have a big headache so the the
[2:16:33] preaching was so good I don't want to
[2:16:34] miss anything well it was great but I
[2:16:38] had a pain my hair does really really
[2:16:41] was painful at the end of the service I
[2:16:47] came here for praying
[2:16:52] and church I'll I feel yesterday that
[2:16:55] God came to last I feel it myself I'm
[2:17:01] pretty sure he came to a big one

[2:20:56] my brothers in the church that I first
[2:20:59] came and my country he passed away five
[2:21:02] days ago I think that was one of my

[2:21:13] only to myself and another brother who
[2:21:16] will be the next I don't know but I want

[2:21:27] made it I want to make it too I hope I
[2:21:34] don't take too much time for you yes
[2:21:38] it's something when I when I talk about
[2:21:43] the message I don't want to stop
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:49] probably I would like to go back to my
[2:21:52] first role when I first came to the
[2:21:57] message that I spent like a probably
[2:22:00] more than 20 hours reading the message
[2:22:02] every day every day yes and I don't read
[2:22:08] too much now my still reading every day
[2:22:12] yeah is that also this morning this
[2:22:18] morning I have a dream
[2:22:22] but I still have to check with a message
[2:22:27] because it was about the message my
[2:22:30] doing so at this time I don't have the
[2:22:34] answer yet because I I haven't check it
[2:22:36] by I had a dream this morning and and
[2:22:42] because they're doing this about the
[2:22:44] trial I think they're doing this came
[2:22:46] from God probably because I was really
[2:22:51] ingesting the he sent his sign on the
[2:22:54] sky to give up to give a message to

[2:23:36] for prayer and God took that migraine or
[2:23:39] headache away right there and then he
[2:23:40] was crying and we were talking and
[2:23:42] smiling and worshiping and God just
[2:23:44] brought a swift healing there I just
[2:23:48] want to share one quick testimony he
[2:23:49] switch over here Lydia I think I have
[2:23:50] some pictures on facebook i've been
[2:23:54] putting progress on been praying for my
[2:23:57] high school track coach okay and this
[2:24:03] i've known he's been retired and living
[2:24:06] close to me for all these years here's a
[2:24:07] picture of him and he's still in the
[2:24:11] hospice right now close to death maybe
[2:24:13] one or two days away but all these years
[2:24:16] I've been over here I've been one to ask
[2:24:18] him do you know Jesus Christ as your
[2:24:19] Savior because he's a staunch Catholic
[2:24:21] and so I visit him four days in a row
[2:24:23] the first three days I could not ask and
[2:24:25] there were so many interruptions and
[2:24:27] finally I went last night and I was
[2:24:29] after preaching after your testimony
[2:24:30] Rosie I was really built up on faith I'm
[2:24:32] like I'm gonna ask him if he's trusting
[2:24:34] in Jesus Christ as his Savior not
[2:24:36] and so I went there with a lot of faith
[2:24:38] and I asked him I said are you trusting
[2:24:40] in Jesus Christ for salvation she said
[2:24:42] yes I am he said I am I am I said do you
[2:24:45] love Jesus Christ and he said I sure do
[2:24:48] I sure love Jesus Christ I said that's
[2:24:51] the best news I could get and but it
[2:24:53] came on the fourth day fourth days that
[2:24:55] they have victory right deliverance
[2:24:57] three you know a three in a row I
[2:24:58] couldn't get to ask him I just want to
[2:25:00] ask him and church I got oh I recorded
[2:25:02] it even on my phone to make sure I knew
[2:25:04] what he said and as soon as he got those
[2:25:06] words I love Jesus I was saying
[2:25:08] hallelujah praise the Lord somebody
[2:25:10] walked in there and just stopped our
[2:25:12] conversation right there so it just
[2:25:13] seemed like God gave me that little
[2:25:15] window and I want to thank him for that
[2:25:16] so I just wanted to know if he was
[2:25:18] trusting in Jesus Christ for salvation
[2:25:20] cuz he may go at any time
[2:25:23] and I felt like this church and I'm not
[2:25:25] trying to spiritualize it but that's my
[2:25:27] senior year my last that's me that's my
[2:25:29] senior year we were state runners-up and
[2:25:30] that was his last year of teaching and
[2:25:33] and because of the the talents God gave
[2:25:35] me I took him out as like a winner I
[2:25:37] took him out on top
[2:25:38] and I thought it was interesting at the
[2:25:40] end of his life God brings me back to
[2:25:42] him because I'm trying to take him out
[2:25:43] to go to heaven now because there's no
[2:25:46] greater thing you can do I just want to
[2:25:48] make sure are you saved do you know
[2:25:49] Jesus Christ as your Savior and he said
[2:25:52] he did so I didn't want to make it over
[2:25:53] spiritual but I thought it was so
[2:25:55] interesting I was there when he went out
[2:25:56] on this job and Here I am on the way out
[2:25:59] when he leaves to go to heaven hopefully
[2:26:02] by the grace of God I just want to share
[2:26:05] that testimony praise God any other
[2:26:08] testimonies anybody have any testimonies
[2:26:10] like to share mystified to the Lord
[2:26:13] tonight okay done yeah Oh but okay this
[2:26:20] is my wife come art you cannot hear me I
[2:26:30] didn't have watched faith I didn't know
[2:26:31] Jesse's gonna do that um but I never
[2:26:34] want to miss an opportunity just to
[2:26:36] share how thankful I am for God's
[2:26:39] goodness on our family and what I see
[2:26:42] him doing in the lives of our children
[2:26:43] and it's not anything that there's no
[2:26:48] formula we can't take credit
[2:26:50] for it but I'm just there aren't words
[2:26:54] to describe how grateful I am to see God
[2:26:59] blessing the seeds we've tried to plant
[2:27:02] in the sincerity and honesty in our
[2:27:04] hearts and to see them starting to come
[2:27:07] to faith and wanting prayer for things
[2:27:09] and blessing musical gifts and things
[2:27:13] and and it just fills my heart with a
[2:27:15] lot of gladness so I just want to thank
[2:27:17] the Lord for that and I look forward to
[2:27:19] seeing what he'll do with their lives
[2:27:21] and we just continue to pray God would
[2:27:23] keep them protected from the stains of
[2:27:26] sin and just the way the devil wants to
[2:27:29] get at them especially as they enter
[2:27:31] their teen years and so we're just
[2:27:33] thankful and thankful for the potential
[2:27:37] of the other little ones but I'm really
[2:27:40] grateful to Lord for that so I just

[2:34:16] differently from them and it's something
[2:34:19] I pray God helps me to be able to
[2:34:21] explain it to them and he gives them a
[2:34:23] heart to also be able to and then Bert
[2:34:31] van was talking about green card so I
[2:34:34] applied I have my green card so you when
[2:34:37] you apply you get a first two years and
[2:34:38] then after the two years you get ten
[2:34:40] years and then I saw the team within the
[2:34:42] ten years you can apply for citizenship
[2:34:44] so I had got in my two years and then it
[2:34:47] had expired so how to apply for the
[2:34:49] tenure and I applied for it and I
[2:34:52] [Music]
[2:34:54] applied for it in a May of last year
[2:34:58] yeah mayor of last year's old not only
[2:35:01] supposed to take about six months for it

[2:35:16] around the time I had some emergency
[2:35:18] surgery done last year in the had a
[2:35:20] hollow going on and my husband was
[2:35:23] traveling to Seoul I think I was packing
[2:35:25] up some papers and then appointment
[2:35:27] let's say the Saints me I had I did it
[2:35:29] to the trash and then put it in the
[2:35:30] trash and you're supposed to go with the
[2:35:32] appointment later so time was my husband
[2:35:36] was in Ghana and he called me is like
[2:35:38] where is that appointment letter and I'm
[2:35:40] like yeah I saw it I ran so I went
[2:35:43] looking for it it I searched everywhere
[2:35:46] like I could not find it I'm like okay I
[2:35:49] cut some papers and put them in the
[2:35:50] trash thankfully they hadn't come for
[2:35:53] the trash if they had like that was it
[2:35:55] so I went back like pulled out all the
[2:35:58] trash said such sage and they was in the
[2:36:01] trash so thankfully we went for the they
[2:36:06] interview and it was late so we went the
[2:36:10] lady was hit on my application that
[2:36:13] there was a latest interview so I didn't
[2:36:17] think it was much of a big deal six
[2:36:19] months past one year passed like nothing
[2:36:23] and then there that when you apply for
[2:36:26] you to give you this receipt so more or
[2:36:28] less like that becomes your kind of
[2:36:29] temporary green card that one had
[2:36:32] expired and I had still not hitting
[2:36:35] anything I'm like what is going on so
[2:36:37] work always praying about it and
[2:36:39] normally is the 10-year one that has a
[2:36:42] lot of issues like they come dig in a
[2:36:44] lot of stuff so we kept praying about it
[2:36:47] and then a month in it a year and six
[2:36:52] months had passed and still nothing like
[2:36:55] it was taking forever
[2:36:57] and then thankfully I think it wasn't in
[2:37:02] November yeah November yeah November we

[2:37:12] like way way past but thankfully we
[2:37:15] received it in I have feelings

[2:37:20] praying that one goes through pretty
[2:37:22] faithfully that's my mom I have to file
[2:37:25] for my mom and I have to become a
[2:37:27] citizen before I can do anything for her
[2:37:30] it's a whole lot of complications yes
[2:37:32] I'm so thankful the green card came
[2:37:34] through without any issues we didn't
[2:37:37] have to go for any second interview I'm
[2:37:38] not paying any like you came to it I'm
[2:37:40] so thankful for that and then the last
[2:37:43] ones though I think I have been a bit
[2:37:48] dry say my college and
[2:37:51] especially when I'm out in the store
[2:37:53] with the kids like that my phone gets
[2:37:56] lost or my wallet or my card like
[2:37:58] something gets lost so that was two
[2:38:02] weeks ago Sunday when Brad Simon came
[2:38:04] after church me we I went to Walmart I
[2:38:08] had ordered their Christmas gifts online
[2:38:10] so I went to pick it up and then I
[2:38:12] bought a couple of things after buying I
[2:38:15] went to the online pick up to pick it up
[2:38:17] and then when I go to their car deciding
[2:38:19] it and I'm like where is my wallet cuz I
[2:38:23] had taken an ID card from it and they
[2:38:25] showed it to the pickup lady and now I
[2:38:27] can find a wallet and they had like
[2:38:29] everything all my cards like everything
[2:38:32] in there we searched the car nothing I
[2:38:35] went back into the store I kept
[2:38:36] searching like if they found anything
[2:38:39] they said nothing okay so we went home
[2:38:44] and then when we went home I was like
[2:38:47] I'll go back to the store and then see
[2:38:50] if they found anything when I was at
[2:38:52] home I called they said nothing like it
[2:38:54] kind of get lost all of a sudden like

[2:41:57] you I'm like I asked the girls did you
[2:41:59] put in here they said no I'm like are
[2:42:01] you sure but I mean they they what I'm
[2:42:05] trying to get out it's like no matter
[2:42:08] how little the prize no matter how
[2:42:10] unimportant we think it is I believe
[2:42:14] like God listens to every single one
[2:42:18] every single he's always untrained
[2:42:22] always some of these little things kind
[2:42:26] of like boost my confidence in God like
[2:42:29] it helps it's encouraged you see that if
[2:42:31] he listens to do two little ones and
[2:42:33] definitely the bigger ones that I prayed
[2:42:36] for his praise the Lord God is so good
[2:42:47] to us
[2:42:48] anyone else have a testimony yeah all
[2:42:51] right let me come on up let's give her a
[2:42:53] round ball all I want to say is that I
[2:43:01] just want to thank God for bringing me
[2:43:04] he's brought me farther in my walk with
[2:43:07] him this year than I was last year I'm a
[2:43:11] lot farther than I was and I just want
[2:43:14] to thank him for that and it's it's
[2:43:19] really encouraging to know that he's
[2:43:22] working with me and he knows where I'm
[2:43:25] going and he knows where I've been and
[2:43:26] I'm not where I've been I'm not where
[2:43:28] I'm gonna where I need to be but I'm
[2:43:30] gonna get there
[2:43:31] with his help that's faithful to finish
[2:43:44] what he started praise God
[2:43:46] anyone else have a testimony all right
[2:43:50] let's stand and what's gonna come up
[2:43:52] here for communion I'm gonna get the
[2:43:53] scriptures ready here Harvey
[2:43:59] no it's too long it's got a llama yeah
[2:44:01] may be out next week you say that song I
[2:44:11] am the lord of healeth thee
[2:44:13] [Music]
[2:44:16] let's read our scripture first
[2:44:19] Corinthians 11 you know one of the
[2:44:31] Saints was telling me recently about how
[2:44:33] they visited a denominational Church and
[2:44:35] they did they took communion but they
[2:44:37] didn't read all the scripture around it
[2:44:39] they just read the nice parts about it
[2:44:43] and didn't read the part about
[2:44:46] responsibility so I want to make sure I
[2:44:50] read all that about being responsible in
[2:44:53] other words we have to be careful how we
[2:44:55] eat of the bread and drink of the wine
[2:44:57] we got to be very careful and we got to
[2:45:00] examine ourselves and make sure we live
[2:45:01] in the right kind of life
[2:45:02] [Music]
[2:45:05] 1st Corinthians 11:23 before I received
[2:45:08] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[2:45:10] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[2:45:12] night which he was betrayed took bread
[2:45:13] when he given thanks he brake it and
[2:45:16] said take eat this is my body which is
[2:45:18] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:45:20] me after the same manner also he took
[2:45:23] the cup and when he had supped saying
[2:45:24] this cup is a New Testament in my blood
[2:45:26] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[2:45:29] remembrance of me for as often as you
[2:45:32] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[2:45:34] show the Lord's death until he come
[2:45:38] wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
[2:45:41] bread and drink of this cup of the Lord
[2:45:43] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:45:45] and blood of the Lord that's what our
[2:45:47] friend was saying they don't read that
[2:45:50] in all churches the words they just want
[2:45:52] to invite everybody everybody come take
[2:45:54] communion but they don't tell you that
[2:45:55] you have to take it the right way let's
[2:45:58] make sure we take it the right way let a
[2:46:01] man examine himself and so let him eat
[2:46:03] of that bread and drink of that Cup he
[2:46:05] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[2:46:07] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[2:46:09] not discerning the Lord's body for this
[2:46:13] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[2:46:15] and many sleep for if we would judge
[2:46:18] ourselves we should not be judged
[2:46:21] when we are judged we are chastened to
[2:46:24] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[2:46:26] with the world wherefore my brethren
[2:46:28] when you come together to eat tarry one
[2:46:30] for another and if any man hunger let
[2:46:33] him eat at home that ye come not
[2:46:34] together unto condemnation and the rest
[2:46:37] will I set an order when I come let's
[2:46:45] have a word of Prayer and let's pray
[2:46:47] that these symbols will be a blessing to
[2:46:49] our spiritual life the natural is not as
[2:46:52] important of course but it's more about
[2:46:54] the spiritual meaning of these symbols
[2:46:56] how many Father we just come and
[2:46:59] reverently we thank you for these
