[0:00] me
[0:01] the the it's in it's
[0:04] input and I think it's HDMI
[0:10] 1 I'm sorry no I think it's p PC just
[0:14] keep pressing that button I think it's
[0:15] PC
[0:18] in there we go very
[0:22] nice all right thank you let's give her
[0:25] two classs great job
[0:26] hun like I said she needs a raise too
[0:29] just like AAA everybody they all need a
[0:30] raise all the great work they do thank
[0:33] you darling I really appreciate that so
[0:36] we want to look here at this part 23 by
[0:38] God's grace on the book of uh Romans and
[0:40] uh I just thought you know I was just
[0:42] meditating a little bit you know this
[0:43] morning I thought you I just kind of
[0:44] like to update the church you know where
[0:46] we are prophetically you over these last
[0:49] few years I preached a few sermons on
[0:50] the signs of the end times and how close
[0:53] are we to the Rapture and looking at
[0:55] Russia's place in Ezekiel um and then of
[0:58] course the different countries that are
[1:00] named in the Book of Revelation in the
[1:01] tribulation period um but I just thought
[1:04] I would just rehearse this with you here
[1:07] um you know uh I believe brother Ram
[1:10] said the clogs of God's timing turn
[1:13] slowly right we've all seen a watch
[1:15] right and they have those hands in there
[1:16] and they you know they they turn slowly
[1:18] right but but how many know that God's
[1:20] uh moving everything right on time by
[1:22] God's grace Hallelujah so I just thought
[1:24] I'd share this you know where we are
[1:25] prophetically if you haven't thought
[1:27] about this lately you know really Church
[1:29] according to the Bible there's only been
[1:30] 6,000 years of human history and brother
[1:33] Ram said every 2,000 years God does
[1:35] something major right so the first 2,000
[1:38] years he sent Noah and then he flooded
[1:41] the Earth the second 2,000 years he sent
[1:44] the Messiah and that caused the blood of
[1:46] Jesus Christ to be shed on this Earth
[1:48] thank God God has shed his grace on this
[1:51] Earth amen hallelujah let me set a timer
[1:54] gota see how it
[1:56] goes and then you know uh 2,000 more
[1:59] years God visited Christ visited in the
[2:01] son of man Ministry now of course most
[2:04] people won't recognize this but we
[2:06] recognize it because God sent brother
[2:08] brandham with thus sayeth the Lord and
[2:10] he's turned our hearts back to the Bible
[2:12] we don't look to things outside the
[2:13] Bible for strength we look to the Bible
[2:15] praise God and as I showed you there's
[2:17] hundreds of differences I just showed
[2:19] 110 I found some more this week even I
[2:22] got to add to the list but there's over
[2:24] 110 differences between true
[2:26] Christianity and the majority of
[2:28] denominations or Christian churches
[2:31] right and so but the main the main event
[2:35] though of these uh 2,000 years will
[2:37] course be the Rapture the Bible Paul
[2:40] calls it the Blessed hope amen
[2:42] hallelujah the Blessed hope of the
[2:44] believer Amen to be changed in a moment
[2:46] and a twinkling of an eye to meet Jesus
[2:48] in the air Hallelujah to be snatched
[2:51] away before God returns to Israel and
[2:54] brings a a a final judgment upon the
[2:58] Nations well maybe
[3:00] maybe that's a little bit pre pre uh pre
[3:03] uh little bit early by God's grace
[3:05] because I guess the final judgment on
[3:06] the Nations will be the Battle of go and
[3:08] Magog if I'm not mistaken but uh before
[3:11] the Millennium the final judgment upon
[3:12] the Nations we'd say so every uh 20000
[3:15] years God does something great you know
[3:17] we can all feel the tension amongst the
[3:20] Nations right uh but no one no man knows
[3:22] the day or the hour you know we've heard
[3:24] over the last few years uh preachers and
[3:26] all kinds of people every year they
[3:27] predict this is the last year and every
[3:29] year they've been wrong but uh we know
[3:32] at some point it will be the last year
[3:34] but we know for sure Jesus said these
[3:36] are birth pains right we know that for
[3:38] sure that that uh we went through a
[3:40] great birth pain in 2020 with the covid
[3:43] restrictions and everything and these
[3:44] wars now with Russia Ukraine Israel
[3:47] Hamas these are birth pains Jesus said
[3:50] there would be Wars rumors of wars right
[3:53] uh but he tells us this is not the end
[3:55] these are just birth pains the
[3:57] tribulation will be the time of uh the
[4:00] ultimate birth pains when when a new a
[4:02] new world is brought forth for the
[4:04] Millennium praise God A New Earth is
[4:06] birthed after the Great Tribulation
[4:08] period so we know it's all working
[4:10] together uh prophetically along these
[4:14] promises now now of course remember
[4:16] Church don't forget this this is why I
[4:17] want to remind you again uh we have thus
[4:21] sayith the Lord timeline from Daniel of
[4:24] course right um and if you turn this to
[4:27] its side then we we get the idea of a
[4:29] timeline you know Dan Daniel gave us
[4:31] this timeline so the head here would be
[4:33] about 600 BC and of course the feet is
[4:36] right here where we're living so we're
[4:38] living in the feet of this image right
[4:41] we're living in the feet okay so uh if
[4:44] you put this timeline on the the whole
[4:47] human history we're just living here you
[4:50] know at the very end by God's grace this
[4:52] is where we're at we're at the feet of
[4:54] the image right Rome is ruling the world
[4:59] it doesn't seem like it but Rome is
[5:02] right we can see it by God's grace uh
[5:05] the Bible said the Roman Harlot I'm
[5:07] sorry the mother Harlot the Roman Harlot
[5:09] that's cheer too uh commits adultery
[5:12] with every nation under heaven right we
[5:16] can see that it's almost spread to every
[5:18] nation under Heaven there's few more
[5:19] Nations it's got to go to of course uh
[5:22] uh the Bible said all the kingdoms will
[5:24] unite during the tribulation period so
[5:25] maybe that's the time period when Every
[5:27] Nation China and Russia and the Nations
[5:30] will finally Unite with the Roman
[5:32] Catholic church but it's going to happen
[5:35] it's Pro it's prophecy it has to happen
[5:37] Daniel said this image has to stand
[5:40] until the until the stone cut of a mount
[5:43] cut out of a mountain comes and it
[5:45] strikes this at its very feet and that
[5:48] will destroy this image amen that's the
[5:51] battle of Armageddon Church hallelujah
[5:53] amen in other words this image will
[5:55] stand until
[5:56] Armageddon and then when Jesus comes
[5:58] back he com comes back like a stone out
[6:00] of a mountain of course he's robed in
[6:01] white and then the Bible said this image
[6:04] will be destroyed from the feet and it
[6:06] will be dispersed like chaff in the wind
[6:08] amen that's what all these nations and
[6:10] all these nuclear bombs that's what it
[6:12] means go to God it's nothing it's just
[6:14] like chaff there's no power greater than
[6:17] God's power hallelujah amen brother said
[6:21] why should you be afraid all these men
[6:23] uh we saw how I think Zuckerberg
[6:24] remember he built did you see that
[6:26] underground layer he built over there in
[6:27] the island uh cuz he knows doomsday will
[6:30] come eventually right but brother no
[6:32] matter how deep you dig it you'll never
[6:34] get away from Christ Hallelujah he's
[6:37] King he's God hallelujah he's coming
[6:39] back Hallelujah the only thing to do is
[6:41] uh let his blood come upon your heart
[6:44] Hallelujah repent and serve God and and
[6:47] know that you're ready to meet him
[6:48] praise God brother R said the only place
[6:49] to go the only bomb shelter there is is
[6:51] under the shadow of God's Wings
[6:53] Hallelujah that's the bomb shelter we
[6:55] need amen you know you know uh we we say
[6:59] uh uh drawing real close to God that's
[7:01] the greatest bomb shelter we've got is
[7:03] drawing nigh to God resting in the bosom
[7:05] of Christ Hallelujah like John
[7:09] amen John beloved of the Lord Austin
[7:11] beloved to the Lord I'll never forget
[7:13] that Austin loved of the Lord hallelujah
[7:17] thank
[7:18] God but that's you know so that's where
[7:20] we see you know the the we're in the
[7:22] seven Church ages of course but we're at
[7:24] the very feet of this
[7:25] image now I want to just read it again
[7:28] here here here's profess Ally where
[7:29] we're at we're in the
[7:31] feet and whereas thou sawest the feet
[7:33] and Toes part of Potter's clay and part
[7:36] of iron so we're at the feet and the
[7:39] toes of this image part iron part clay
[7:42] the kingdom should be divided and
[7:44] brother says Clay is Protestants and
[7:47] iron is Rome that's what brother BR says
[7:51] but there shall be in it the strength of
[7:53] the iron the Roman Catholic Church for
[7:55] as much as thou sawest the iron mixed
[7:57] with myy clay and the toes of the feet
[8:00] were part iron part clay so the kingdom
[8:03] shall be partly strong and partly
[8:05] broken right so we can see the Roman
[8:07] Catholic Church is strong in some
[8:09] Nations but not
[8:10] others and whereas thou sawest iron
[8:13] mixed with myy Clay then shall they
[8:15] shall mingle themselves with the seed of
[8:18] men but they shall not cleave one to
[8:20] another even as iron is not mixed with
[8:23] Clay so see we'll never really see this
[8:25] this great Unity right uh uh we just
[8:28] won't see they always keep their
[8:30] separation between uh Roman Catholics
[8:33] and Protestants remember uh the Bible
[8:36] says iron is the Roman Spirit of course
[8:39] Rome is in the mother Harlot Revelation
[8:41] 17 and then the Bible said she's got
[8:44] daughters or children in Revelation
[8:48] 2:23 Hallelujah just as Jezebel had an
[8:51] awful daughter just just the same as her
[8:54] so the Roman Catholic church has
[8:55] produced daughters denominations praise
[8:58] God now remember this is what brother
[9:00] Ram tells us look how theyve done look
[9:02] how they've weeded in just the things
[9:04] they've done look where they're at today
[9:06] look at Catholicism swallowing up Maring
[9:09] into it breaking this just exactly what
[9:11] Daniel said they do iron and Clay
[9:12] wouldn't mix but mingling their seeds
[9:14] one with another breaking every
[9:17] Protestant girl marries a Catholic boy
[9:19] has to raise the children Catholic and
[9:21] that's true that's my wife and I have
[9:23] seen that in our family we had a a
[9:25] family member Mary Catholic and so that
[9:27] family member had to become Catholic
[9:30] all like that Maring intermingling like
[9:32] that until it's come to a place to the
[9:34] whole United States is all wormed over
[9:37] so we see this is Satan's plan Satan's
[9:39] plan is to get all the Protestant
[9:41] families to take their guard down and
[9:43] say Well they're just they're Catholics
[9:44] they're the same as us and it's his plan
[9:47] through marriage right and we can see
[9:50] how that's been accomplished right it's
[9:53] it's uh Mo most Protestants don't even
[9:55] protest the Catholic church anymore but
[9:58] we are still the true Protestants amen
[10:00] we protest the the authority of the pope
[10:03] of Rome Hallelujah but we see how
[10:06] scripture has been
[10:08] fulfilled and so this has to happen
[10:11] these these toes and feet have to remain
[10:14] slightly separated but they're course
[10:16] closely together until the United States
[10:19] gets power to lay down the mark where
[10:22] you can't buy or cell without the mark
[10:25] right because the the Beast this Beast
[10:28] will uh I'm sorry that he had power to
[10:30] give life under the image of the Beast
[10:32] that the image of the Beast should both
[10:33] speak and cause that as many as would
[10:36] not worship the image of the Beast
[10:38] should be killed now brother Ram says
[10:39] the image of the Beast is United church
[10:41] and state right so at some point all
[10:44] these Protestant and Catholic churches
[10:46] have to unite with the United States
[10:48] government that's what brother R tells
[10:50] us and then any anyone will who will not
[10:53] accept this Mark will be
[10:55] killed because he causes all both small
[10:58] and great rich and poor free and bond to
[11:00] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[11:02] their foreheads so it's or it's either
[11:05] in your works or in your uh acceptance
[11:08] mentally or spiritually with the Beast
[11:11] and that no man might buy or sell say
[11:13] that he had the Mark or the name right
[11:17] Roman Catholicism or United Church or
[11:19] the number of his name and of course the
[11:21] number of 666 vicarious fil day that's
[11:24] the title of the pope of Rome right
[11:27] instead of the son of God
[11:29] so these are the ways that people will
[11:31] take the mark of the beast but thank God
[11:33] we're a million miles out of that
[11:34] hallelujah thank God we're like Abraham
[11:36] totally out of Sodom Hallelujah I've got
[11:39] videos if you want to see them where
[11:40] Sodom they've allowed that to come right
[11:42] into the Vatican they we have videos of
[11:44] the Pope and he's got all these half
[11:46] naked circus dancers and they're playing
[11:47] all together it's total trash it's come
[11:51] and all these trans people have come
[11:52] right into the Vatican right they are
[11:56] united but we're uniting with Christ the
[11:58] word
[11:59] hallelujah praise God Amen I just
[12:01] thought I'd uh rehearse us on this that
[12:04] although although it seems to move slow
[12:07] God's timing is right on time
[12:10] Hallelujah now remember we're in this
[12:12] we're in this fifth part here of we're
[12:14] in God's promises to Israel and I love
[12:16] how as we're talking about Israel Paul's
[12:19] also showing our place as the Gentile
[12:21] Church
[12:23] Hallelujah Al so yeah so we'll be on
[12:25] this for a few chapters here uh I'm
[12:27] probably going to skip through Roman
[12:29] Romans 11 because I I labored on that
[12:31] when I preached on uh the mystery of of
[12:35] Israel's blindness a couple years ago I
[12:37] think it was 2021 or 2022 I preached a
[12:40] whole series on that of course I was
[12:42] preaching the revelations I wrote in my
[12:43] book from Brother bram's Ministry but
[12:46] then we you know look at the last
[12:47] section is Christian Life last two
[12:49] sections are Christian Life and service
[12:52] and then the outflow of Christian love
[12:54] according to CI scoffield praise God now
[12:57] I want to pick up here basically uh Paul
[13:00] says man who are you to reply or
[13:03] contradict God you know we we looked at
[13:06] on on Wednesday night of how God is the
[13:08] Potter and we're the clay Hallelujah and
[13:12] God has to apply pressure on our lives
[13:14] to change us the church said like this
[13:17] morning little pressure I got to do song
[13:19] service and
[13:20] preach it's just some friendly pressure
[13:23] hallelujah
[13:25] hallelujah it's just the the normal part
[13:27] of life right there's pressures God but
[13:30] it makes us to rely on God more and I've
[13:33] just seen this church the more trials
[13:34] you have or the more pressure the more
[13:35] God shows up amen God won't leave you
[13:38] high and dry God said I'll never leave
[13:41] you nor forsake you Hallelujah I found
[13:44] that in my greatest times of pressure or
[13:46] or or difficulty that's when I I feel
[13:49] God the most Hallelujah that's when I
[13:51] can look back and say wow God was
[13:53] merciful god was gracious God kept me
[13:55] from other things and God was there with
[13:57] me the whole time even though I might
[13:59] not have seen it or felt it God proved
[14:01] he was right there with me the whole
[14:02] time
[14:05] Hallelujah so see we should never find
[14:07] fault with God God has never done
[14:10] anything wrong throughout our entire
[14:13] life
[14:15] Hallelujah and we should never resist
[14:17] his will we should just let God have his
[14:20] way in our lives the perfect will of
[14:23] God don't choose the permissive will
[14:26] choose the perfect will of God Amen
[14:29] right right don't resist his will
[14:32] Hallelujah but he said who are who are
[14:34] you oh man no EXC oh man we're just
[14:37] we're just a man we're just
[14:38] human shall the creation say to the
[14:41] Creator why have you made me thus
[14:45] Hallelujah so we want to remember how
[14:48] low we are remember last year I found
[14:50] how David complained against God but it
[14:53] wasn't in arrogance it was in
[14:57] desperation so we saw very plainly in
[14:59] Psalm 142 a prayer when he was in the
[15:03] cave so imagine you're in a cave no
[15:07] electricity no air conditioning well
[15:09] it's pretty cold in there already so no
[15:10] heat I'll say like
[15:12] that he said I Cried unto the Lord with
[15:15] my voice with my voice unto the Lord did
[15:17] I make my supplication I poured out my
[15:19] complaint before him I show before him
[15:22] my
[15:23] trouble so when when David's complaining
[15:26] he's just letting God know Lord this is
[15:28] the troubles that I'm going
[15:30] through I'm in a very dark place in my
[15:33] life
[15:35] right but he ends he ends the uh song by
[15:38] saying Lord bring my soul out of prison
[15:41] that I may praise thy name he's being
[15:44] hunted down by his father-in-law his own
[15:47] family wants him dead now which one of
[15:49] you can say that right his own family
[15:51] wants him dead but he said he said Lord
[15:54] bring me out of
[15:56] this because I Want To Praise Your Name
[15:59] now look he's being honest I'm having
[16:00] trouble praising your name so bring me
[16:02] out of this so I can really praise your
[16:04] name it's okay if it's it's hard to sing
[16:06] praises or it's hard to worship just
[16:08] keep calling out to God amen amen see
[16:11] just make sure it's your heart's desire
[16:13] Lord I Want To Praise you but it's just
[16:15] hard to do it right now save me so I can
[16:18] Praise You Hallelujah am the way I want
[16:21] to I'm like Jonah I'm seeing all these
[16:24] symptoms but I know you can bring me out
[16:26] Hallelujah right like brother van pray
[16:28] you know Lord these are all lying
[16:30] vanities Hallelujah help me Lord to see
[16:32] all these all these circumstances are
[16:34] just lying vanities
[16:37] amen he and David says the righteous
[16:40] shall Compass me so see he had hope one
[16:43] day I'll get out of this cave where I'm
[16:44] all alone and one day I'll be surrounded
[16:46] by saints that can encourage me praise
[16:48] God how many got that today got somebody
[16:51] that can encourage you today can brother
[16:53] Jesse or brother Jose or brother sister
[16:55] so and so can you find encouragement
[16:57] from a saint today
[16:59] you're not alone in a cave are you see
[17:01] there there's there's hope for you
[17:03] praise God for Thou shalt deal deal
[17:05] bountifully with me so David knew God
[17:09] dealt bountifully with me before I don't
[17:11] see it right now but he'll deal
[17:13] bountifully with me again so David
[17:16] recognizes seasons of Life some Seasons
[17:19] I see the blessings some seasons are
[17:22] darker I feel lone but I believe he'll
[17:24] bring me to another season hallelujah
[17:27] amen
[17:29] but see we shouldn't contradict
[17:31] God right we shouldn't uh speak against
[17:34] God now we know job did this right we
[17:38] know job did this in Pride and God
[17:40] rebuked
[17:42] him because God came down in a whirlwind
[17:46] and said who is this that confuses my
[17:49] counsel with no
[17:52] knowledge God spoke that to
[17:54] job right so we we see sometimes even uh
[17:59] we'd say the best of
[18:01] us we say some sometimes even the most
[18:03] spiritual of us we reply against God we
[18:08] we question why God would allow things
[18:10] to happen in our
[18:12] lives but what's God going to say if we
[18:14] don't repent God's going to come rebuke
[18:16] us because he loves us hallelujah as
[18:20] many as I love I rebuke and
[18:22] chasen
[18:24] Hallelujah G up thy loins now like a man
[18:28] for demand of thee and answer thou me
[18:31] where was thou when I laid the
[18:32] foundations of the earth I love's first
[18:34] question is about the Earth where were
[18:36] you when I gave the Earth its resting
[18:39] place in the universe go ahead and tell
[18:41] me if you understand Hallelujah that's
[18:44] what Paul says oh how how can the
[18:47] creation say to the Creator why have you
[18:50] done this God had a very good purpose
[18:52] why he did
[18:53] it Hallelujah God knew had a very good
[18:56] reason why he allowed everything to
[18:59] happen in our
[19:00] lives to our friends back there brother
[19:02] mercy God had a good reason to bring him
[19:04] up from Texas Hallelujah I might not
[19:07] understand it brother Mercy but God
[19:09] knows Hallelujah God had a good reason
[19:12] to bring you all the way from Nicaragua
[19:14] brother
[19:15] Jose God God knows God knows why would I
[19:20] suffer like this or why would I have
[19:21] this health problem or why I have this
[19:23] spiritual problem why would I have this
[19:25] God knows exactly what he's doing praise
[19:27] God
[19:29] let us not uh confuse God's word God is
[19:34] God's word is not confusing God's word
[19:36] is very plain
[19:38] Hallelujah he allows all these things to
[19:41] happen and then he's with you during
[19:42] your trials Hallelujah he said I'll
[19:44] never leave you I'll never forsake you
[19:47] amen oh thank God Amen oh preach your
[19:51] brother Jesse because I need it amen me
[19:53] I'm talking about me preach brother
[19:54] Jesse because Jesse needs it amen
[19:57] hallelujah
[20:00] now who are you he says let's remember
[20:02] God's greatness let's remember how many
[20:05] stars are there church our Milky Way
[20:07] galaxy has over 100 billion
[20:11] stars and there's even then hundreds of
[20:14] billions of
[20:16] galaxies so however many stars there are
[20:19] in our galaxy that's how many galaxies
[20:21] there
[20:23] are and then our galaxy is 20 times or
[20:27] 20 b million times more luminous than
[20:29] the sun I tried to look at the sun I was
[20:31] thinking about this I tried to look at
[20:32] the sun while I was driving to church
[20:34] today I had to turn turn my eyes away
[20:35] quickly I couldn't handle
[20:37] it
[20:39] right but our galaxy is 20 times billion
[20:43] more bright than the sun
[20:45] itself and church out of all these
[20:48] trillions upon trillions and trillions
[20:49] of stars he calls everyone by
[20:53] name he's got a name for him now I can't
[20:55] hardly remember the 22 children that are
[20:57] in my class I'll forget their names by
[21:00] July I'll forget their names by July
[21:02] I'll say what was your name um Carrie no
[21:07] Savannah I'll forget 22 in one
[21:11] month but God knows an innumerable
[21:14] number of angels stars planets and he
[21:18] knows all the hairs on your head and he
[21:20] never forgets one of them hallelujah
[21:23] amen so church if he knows all that
[21:25] surely he can heal the broken heart yes
[21:29] amen and bind up our
[21:32] wounds because he tells the number of
[21:35] the Stars he can give you the
[21:38] number and he calth them all by their
[21:42] names am great and no noce the only
[21:46] words David has for God
[21:49] great great is the Lord and of a great
[21:53] power his understanding is
[21:56] infinite so see we cannot reply against
[21:59] God we cannot contradict God's word we
[22:03] can't speak against God this God is
[22:05] infinite
[22:06] hallelujah our god is Without Limits
[22:10] Hallelujah the Lord lifts up the
[22:13] meek so church what do we often need
[22:16] just a good dose of humility right
[22:18] that's what I say for me too he castes
[22:21] the wicked down to the
[22:23] ground so David said sing unto the Lord
[22:26] with Thanksgiving sing praise upon the
[22:29] harp unto our
[22:32] God
[22:35] Amen so again who are who are we I love
[22:39] this when I consider the heavens the
[22:41] work of thy fingers the moon the stars
[22:44] which thou has ordained I preached on
[22:45] this in the Colossians series a couple
[22:46] years ago what is man that thou are
[22:49] mindful of him and the son of man that
[22:52] thou visitest
[22:53] him church if you actually think about
[22:56] how great the universe is it will make
[22:58] you wonder well well then who am
[23:00] I why how how why would God be mindful
[23:04] of me if this universe is so
[23:07] great
[23:09] Hallelujah now I just want you to see
[23:11] again the Milky Way galaxy we live in
[23:15] it's actually I saw an article from 2018
[23:17] this morning it's actually bigger than
[23:19] what we thought is that any surprise to
[23:21] anybody that God is actually bigger than
[23:24] what we thought does that surprise
[23:25] anybody no it don't surpris me that the
[23:29] scientists are going to find out God's
[23:30] actually greater than what they thought
[23:33] God's creation is bigger than what they
[23:35] can
[23:36] calculate amen a new study shows it
[23:40] would take 200,000 years for a spaceship
[23:43] spr traveling at the speed of light to
[23:46] go across ourti Tire Galaxy so if you
[23:50] could jump on one of those rays of light
[23:53] and write
[23:55] it
[23:56] right riding the
[23:59] light it would still riding the light it
[24:02] would still take you 200,000 years to
[24:04] get across the entire
[24:06] galaxy so if you jumped on light out
[24:09] here now that's where we are if you
[24:11] jumped on a a ray of light it would take
[24:13] you 200,000 years to travel all the way
[24:17] across this is how great God is and Paul
[24:21] says who are you and I to reply against
[24:23] God
[24:26] hallelujah now I love what my wife and I
[24:29] were talking about you know if it takes
[24:31] light that long just to get across well
[24:33] then when God did creation he had to set
[24:35] all that light in order at the same time
[24:38] so he had to place light where it really
[24:40] couldn't go he had to place some of that
[24:42] light over here where it hadn't even had
[24:44] the time to go yet he just had to create
[24:46] everything right in
[24:48] order right because if God just created
[24:51] one light it would take you know light
[24:53] would still be traveling across this
[24:54] galaxy but God placed all the light
[24:57] already there TR traveling like you've
[24:58] been there forever
[25:01] hallelujah amen I hope that made sense
[25:03] if it didn't well I can't help
[25:05] you so this is what they thought they
[25:08] thought was this size but it's probably
[25:09] actually that size it's probably even
[25:11] greater than what they
[25:14] thought
[25:16] Hallelujah and church and then there's
[25:18] you and I that that our tiny that little
[25:21] light white light that's our galaxy amid
[25:23] th this is what just an artist just one
[25:25] idea of how big the universe is
[25:30] there's a 100 billion stars just in that
[25:33] little Dot and then there's hundreds of
[25:35] billions of
[25:38] galaxies and then God knows every one of
[25:41] their
[25:42] names what am I trying to say God knows
[25:45] every one of your
[25:46] trials God knows your entire
[25:49] life he's the author and finisher of
[25:52] your faith Hallelujah that's what I'm
[25:55] trying to show by God's grace and then
[25:57] we get these saw some pictures like this
[25:58] like even all this is all this is still
[26:01] in God's
[26:02] hands cuz God is still outside of all
[26:05] this that's probably the Milky Way
[26:07] galaxy
[26:09] there but I meant I meant it to be the
[26:11] entire universe right or something like
[26:14] this like God's got all this right in
[26:16] his hand
[26:18] there
[26:19] Hallelujah who is man who's man that's
[26:23] mindful or who who who is man that God
[26:25] is mindful of me so amidst all
[26:29] this amidst all that you know who am I
[26:33] that God would you know you know care to
[26:35] just look down on my situation or David
[26:38] could say you know who am I that that
[26:40] God would see me in this Cave of course
[26:42] he sees you in that cave amen of course
[26:46] he's going to make you Bountiful again
[26:48] of course he's going to make you praise
[26:49] the name of the Lord again
[26:51] hallelujah hallelujah he's the author of
[26:53] all of it he's got all this in control
[26:56] and church m he keeps it all right there
[26:59] in place for you he keeps all this in
[27:02] place and if he's got control of that
[27:05] then surely he's got control of Our
[27:06] Lives amen
[27:10] hallelujah and then think Church you
[27:12] know your heart beats 42 million times a
[27:15] year you probably get U an estimated
[27:19] three billion heartbeats in a
[27:21] lifetime and God made sure each time
[27:24] your
[27:25] heartbeat didn't skip a beat it didn't
[27:27] take a break from giving you oxygen to
[27:30] your brain where you have a seizure now
[27:32] if you that's I'm talking about if you
[27:33] live a healthy
[27:34] life all those heartbeats God already
[27:37] took care of it you don't got to worry
[27:39] about one of those three billion
[27:42] heartbeats Hallelujah that just ought to
[27:45] remind us I came from God and I'm going
[27:48] back to God brother Austin Hallelujah
[27:51] God brought me here God sent me here
[27:52] hallelujah God's got a purpose for me
[27:55] here praise God and there he gives
[27:58] trillions upon trillions of people all
[28:00] these three billion
[28:03] heartbeats gives them all and he knows
[28:06] all their hairs on their heads that's
[28:08] that'd be an interesting number to find
[28:09] out there how many hairs just on the
[28:12] living eight billion people how many
[28:14] hairs on their
[28:16] heads let alone the rest of their
[28:19] bodies Hallelujah this is God's
[28:21] greatness right and so Paul says who are
[28:23] who who are we to question
[28:26] God
[28:28] and I thought about this yeah I thought
[28:30] I use a dog because of Austin loves dogs
[28:32] you
[28:33] know in school I had to learn this you
[28:35] have to learn this Kingdom film class
[28:36] order family genus species I had to
[28:38] memorize that in high
[28:40] school but you know a dog is a type of
[28:43] animal uh then it's got a vertebrae but
[28:46] there's there's there's non vertebraes
[28:48] too right but it's a mammal but there's
[28:50] cold blooded animals too carnivores but
[28:53] there's vegetarian you know uh I don't
[28:56] know that one
[28:57] uh canine so wild dogs and then then you
[29:00] get down to just your domestic
[29:02] dog there's all these classifications
[29:05] and God by his knowledge he knew all
[29:08] these differences God made so many
[29:10] different kinds of dogs and so many
[29:12] different kinds of lions and foxes and
[29:14] all these things God's the author of it
[29:16] all here's a moss rose I don't know what
[29:18] my wife can tell me about moss roses but
[29:21] now that that that this is the plant
[29:23] kingdom I just went through the animal
[29:25] kingdom and the plant kingdom you know
[29:28] you got plants there's over a quarter
[29:30] million of those type of species then
[29:33] you have uh the flowering plants there's
[29:35] over a quarter million and dcot I've
[29:38] heard that before I don't remember what
[29:39] it was roses and their allies 18,000
[29:42] different
[29:44] kinds the rose family's got 3500
[29:47] different
[29:48] species and then there's 500 of this
[29:51] genus and then you have the moss rose
[29:53] just one one little
[29:55] Rose our God God Is So infinite no
[29:58] wonder the Bible said his ways are past
[30:00] finding out Hallelujah no wonder it says
[30:03] his thoughts are higher than your
[30:04] thoughts amen his ways are higher than
[30:07] your ways so I was just trying to blow
[30:08] your mind a little bit this
[30:10] morning just with how great God is and
[30:13] yet one of us will look at God and say
[30:14] God you did it wrong excuse
[30:18] me we can't even explain any of we can't
[30:21] even remember we can't remember 10 of
[30:24] these I had trouble remembering Kingdom
[30:26] film class order I I had trouble
[30:28] remembering that this
[30:30] morning let alone naming all these
[30:32] different
[30:33] species Hallelujah reminds me of that
[30:36] song How Great Is Our God
[30:38] Amen and yet Church despite all this
[30:41] he's mindful of
[30:43] you right he's mindful of
[30:48] you um David said that you know of
[30:50] course when when I consider these things
[30:53] the work of your fingers all these Stars
[30:56] plants animals
[30:59] which you've
[31:00] ordained what am I that you're mindful
[31:02] of me what am I that you remember me and
[31:06] you hear my prayers that's why we so
[31:09] rejoice when God answers our prayers
[31:11] because he don't have
[31:13] to but out of his love he chooses to
[31:16] answer our prayers amen he chooses to
[31:19] remember and remember the Book of Job
[31:21] said God has to make sure all those
[31:23] animals those wild goats get fed up
[31:25] there on the mountains
[31:27] right God's got to feed them too yeah
[31:30] the book of Psalm says that even the the
[31:32] water animals they got to rely upon God
[31:33] for all their
[31:34] food everybody's like God feed me God
[31:37] feed me we're like God feed me God feed
[31:39] me and God is faithful
[31:42] hallelujah thank
[31:44] God what is man that you're mindful of
[31:47] him when I consider all these creations
[31:50] of
[31:51] God what is man well one thing man is is
[31:54] in the image of
[31:55] God that's one thing
[31:57] and if we're in His image we're then
[31:59] we're the highest expression of his
[32:02] creation right we're the most like God
[32:04] of any other
[32:06] creature so that's why God is mindful of
[32:09] us because we're in His image we've been
[32:12] predestinated for his glory praise
[32:15] God and we still have that promise of
[32:17] Christ in us the hope of
[32:20] Glory Hallelujah and we can be like Paul
[32:23] brother Mercy who said Christ who

[33:15] members were written which in
[33:17] continuance were fashion when as there

[33:21] them right before anything of anything

[33:28] it in your books
[33:30] hallelujah how precious also are thy
[33:32] thoughts unto me oh God how many believe
[33:34] the Bible is precious
[33:36] amen How great is the sum of them all of

[34:21] depart from me therefore ye bloody men
[34:24] amen hallelujah God keep me from sinners
[34:27] Keep Me In The Fellowship of the saints
[34:29] of God hallelujah amen amen Who Am I who
[34:33] are you to question God's
[34:37] greatness and he hath made of one blood
[34:40] All
[34:41] Nations for of men to dwell on the face
[34:43] of the Earth and have determined the
[34:45] times before appointed and the bounds of
[34:48] our
[34:49] habitation God didn't choose for us to
[34:51] ride horse and Buggies although I guess
[34:52] we couldn't move to amus Country and do
[34:55] that but he chose us to have these
[34:57] benefits that we live in and why did God
[35:00] do this before before time so you would
[35:03] seek the
[35:04] Lord if happy they might feel after him
[35:07] and find him though he be not far from
[35:10] every one of us what a promise a God
[35:13] that makes this great Universe says I'm
[35:14] not far from each one of
[35:16] you and I put you in acine Hallelujah I
[35:20] put you in
[35:21] 2024 so you would seek me hallelujah
[35:25] amen amen and you would find me and you
[35:28] would know me Hallelujah and you would
[35:30] start to know some of my thoughts that I
[35:32] have toward you
[35:34] Hallelujah for in him we live so see
[35:37] Church we're never really living until
[35:38] we're obeying the holy
[35:40] spirit daily I'm talking about a daily
[35:42] basis that's when we really know we're
[35:44] living is when he's in us and we're
[35:48] doing what he's called us to do that's
[35:51] living like brother raham said a doctor
[35:53] he said be the best doctor you can for
[35:55] Jesus when the doctor serving there or
[35:57] the farmer when they're planting the
[35:59] crops or harvesting when they're doing
[36:01] it for God's glory God's living right
[36:03] through
[36:03] them right and thank God The Doctors
[36:05] show up because when you're sick you
[36:06] want a doctor
[36:08] there right thank God the farmer shows
[36:10] up and plants that that cabbage because
[36:12] you really want to get a cabbage when
[36:13] you go to the store Hallelujah some of
[36:15] you more than others
[36:18] amen in Christ you move in Christ you
[36:22] have your
[36:23] being as certain also of your poet said
[36:26] so Paul quotes uh Greek poets he quotes
[36:30] their poets back to them so see their
[36:33] poets agree with the Bible so Paul could
[36:34] quote them right we also are as
[36:39] Offspring and I got some wrong
[36:41] scriptures on there sorry but the the
[36:43] scripture ends with we are his offspring
[36:46] you came out of God so you're God's
[36:48] children that means God's going to watch
[36:50] over you
[36:53] amen hallelujah so remember our Lord is
[36:56] the
[36:58] Potter ha not the Potter power over the
[37:01] clay of the S same lump to make one
[37:03] vessel unto honor and the other unto
[37:07] dishonor remember you are a lump the
[37:09] Bible says but the church is also a
[37:12] lump that's why we got a lot of Leaven
[37:14] churches around right they got a little
[37:16] bit of Leaven and it just corrupts the
[37:19] whole thing right soon as they let that
[37:21] Trinity Doctrine in oh my then what else
[37:23] is going to come through there well look
[37:26] well the Trinity so good it came from
[37:28] the Catholics well I guess we can
[37:29] compromise a little bit with the
[37:31] Catholics I guess we'll just take up
[37:33] their communion same transubstantiation
[37:36] they do we'll just pick that up you see
[37:38] it's just it's a slippery
[37:42] slope
[37:45] now I looked up a few more verses on the
[37:47] Potter but we are all as unclean things
[37:50] and all of our righteousness as filthy
[37:53] rags that's a menstrual Rag and we all
[37:56] do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities
[37:58] like the wind have taken us away so our
[38:02] sins take us away from God and there's
[38:05] none that calleth upon thy name that
[38:08] stirreth up himself to take a hold of
[38:09] thee now of course Paul quotes that
[38:12] remember Romans three for thou Hast hid
[38:15] thy face from us and has consumed us
[38:17] because of our iniquities now Paul's I'm
[38:19] sorry Isaiah speaking of Israel there
[38:21] right God hid his face from Israel
[38:23] because they wouldn't confess their sins
[38:28] but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father we
[38:32] are the clay and thou are Potter and we
[38:35] are all the work of thy
[38:38] hand so I love what God can do God can
[38:40] take a people that are disobedient and
[38:43] have been uh transgressing his commands
[38:46] and disobeying him God can take a people
[38:49] that are so disobedient and if they'll
[38:51] just repent and humble themselves then
[38:53] God will make them like his child God
[38:56] God will so easily forgive them and
[38:58] welcome them back in hallelujah amen
[39:01] right they were disobedient there all
[39:03] these iniquities God hid his face from
[39:05] them but as soon as they're ready to
[39:06] seek God God Will O lovingly open his
[39:09] hands up and bring them back to himself
[39:12] and he'll put them on the potter's wheel
[39:14] again now my wife explained to me a
[39:16] little bit about the potter's wheel so
[39:19] let me get to that in just a little bit
[39:20] here go to Jeremiah 18 if you got your
[39:21] Bible there Jeremiah 18 I didn't have
[39:24] time to put all this or actually forgot
[39:25] to put it on there had
[39:27] time Jeremiah
[39:31] 18 I'm going to try to remember my
[39:33] wife's details here in just a little bit
[39:35] so you can help me Huns you know my
[39:38] memory verse one Jeremiah 18:1 the word
[39:41] which came to Jeremiah from the Lord
[39:43] saying arise and go down to The Potter's
[39:45] House and there I will cause thee to
[39:47] hear my words now it's funny some
[39:48] Churches call themselves The Potter's
[39:49] House but they let the women wear sexy
[39:51] clothes and wear makeup I'm sorry that's
[39:53] not God the Potter you got a different
[39:55] Potter's House than God's
[39:57] house Hallelujah you went down to the
[40:01] wrong
[40:03] house verse four and the vessel that he
[40:06] made of clay was marred in the hand of
[40:08] the
[40:10] Potter so he made it again another
[40:13] vessel as seemed good to the Potter to
[40:15] make it now if I understand this
[40:18] right the the the the the pot that he
[40:21] had was marred it was it wasn't in the
[40:24] right condition but he's going to take
[40:25] that same lump of clay and use it to
[40:28] make it something better that's that's
[40:30] what I understand from
[40:32] this so in other words you can be in a
[40:34] bad shape but God's still not going to
[40:36] throw you
[40:37] away God's just going to start all over
[40:40] again amen God's just going to mold you
[40:43] again God's going to fix what was broken
[40:47] amen God's going to change what you were
[40:50] and make you into something new
[40:52] Hallelujah am
[40:55] Glory
[40:57] look at verse 5 then the word of the
[40:58] Lord came to me saying oh House of
[41:00] Israel cannot I do with you as this
[41:02] Potter sayith the Lord behold as the
[41:05] clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye
[41:07] in my hand oh House of
[41:10] Israel whose hands are you in today are
[41:12] you in Satan's hands no sir you're in
[41:15] God's
[41:18] hands at what instant I shall speak
[41:21] concerning a nation and concerning a
[41:22] kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and
[41:24] to destroy it if that Nation against
[41:26] whom I have pronounced turn from their
[41:28] evil I'll repent of the evil that I
[41:31] thought to do unto
[41:33] them and at what instant I shall speak
[41:36] concerning a nation and concerning a
[41:38] kingdom to build and plant it if it do
[41:40] evil my sight that it obey not my voice
[41:42] then I will repent of the good wherewith
[41:45] I said I would benefit them now
[41:47] therefore go to speak to the men of
[41:49] Judah and to the habitant of Jerusalem
[41:51] saying thus sayi the Lord behold I frame
[41:53] evil against you and devise the device
[41:54] against you return ye now everyone from
[41:56] his evil way and make your ways and your
[41:58] doings good now we'll pause right there
[42:02] so God tells him Israel I can form you
[42:05] however I want but yet I'm going to be
[42:07] merciful if you repent I'll make you
[42:10] into something that's worthy I'll make
[42:12] you into a vessel of
[42:14] Honor
[42:16] Hallelujah and so he says in verse four
[42:19] I can take your life if it's been marred
[42:21] if it's been uh uh if it's been
[42:24] destroyed if it seems like it's in an
[42:25] awful
[42:26] I can still make something beautiful out
[42:29] of your life
[42:31] Hallelujah now I'm going to tell try to
[42:33] tell this honey okay so help me out here
[42:35] my wife said in college she would do the
[42:38] uh the throwing right the throwing of
[42:40] the clay so my wife said the first thing
[42:42] you had to do was go over and pick out
[42:44] the clay that you
[42:46] want there's lots of clay right so kind
[42:49] of laying all over there what clay do
[42:51] you want go ahead and choose that's what
[42:53] God did with you God come over and said
[42:55] I'm going to use this it don't look very
[42:57] good I'm going to use this it's mine he
[43:01] could have chose anybody else but he
[43:03] chose you Hallelujah there's a big bunch
[43:06] of lumps of clay over there but he chose
[43:08] you and you and me and you he chose all
[43:11] of us hallelujah you didn't have to
[43:13] amen but then my wife said once you once
[43:17] you get it then you got to slam it down
[43:19] a lot to get all the air bubbles
[43:21] out ever feel like that once God chose
[43:23] you you had to go through all these
[43:24] trials and I don't mean just like I mean
[43:28] slam down I'm starting to remember this
[43:31] now I think I did that one time too by
[43:32] God's grace but we just rolled ours out
[43:34] but I remember we had to slam it down on
[43:36] the table boom one after another this
[43:39] trial Jose and then this trial it's like
[43:42] God when is this going to end when all
[43:44] the Air's out when all the complaining
[43:46] is out Hallelujah slam it again slam it
[43:50] again you're not even on the wheel yet
[43:53] amen hallelujah the pressure hadn't even
[43:56] been applied yet
[43:58] Hallelujah and the church said you're
[44:01] not even you're not even being
[44:03] pressurized you don't even got the
[44:04] Waters of the word on you
[44:06] yet and the church said I should
[44:10] probably stop saying that now okay so
[44:12] he's just throwing throwing now whatever
[44:14] point now what point can you take it off
[44:15] and stop doing that
[44:18] hun ah when you start to get the little
[44:20] smoothness in your life Hallelujah all
[44:22] those rough Parts
[44:23] out right and then I think at that point
[44:26] then it goes on the wheel no what
[44:28] happens
[44:30] then oh that's right you got to wedge it
[44:32] yeah you got to wedge it so instead of
[44:34] slamming your life down now God starts
[44:36] putting his hands in there a little
[44:38] little more details and maybe the the
[44:40] big parts of his hands and working and
[44:42] once it's wedged then it goes on there
[44:44] but it's not even in the center yet once
[44:46] it's on there I'll say like this church
[44:48] see it takes a while for your life to
[44:50] get into the center of God's will is
[44:52] that right church because we have our
[44:54] ideas well I think I'll serve God God
[44:56] that way God said no no that's not the
[44:57] center of my will I still got a lot of
[45:00] molding to do in your life before you're
[45:02] in the perfect will of God
[45:06] hallelujah so you it spins right you
[45:08] start adding water and you just
[45:11] gotta what do you got to do what that
[45:14] process I forgot that part what was that
[45:19] part H the the clay oh the same
[45:22] direction that's
[45:24] right so it's spinning you got to push
[45:27] it down build it up you got to get all
[45:29] the particles moving in the same
[45:31] direction we got to get all of our
[45:32] thoughts going in the direction of God's
[45:34] word a lot of our thoughts at the
[45:36] beginning they weren't thinking about
[45:38] God we had our plans our ideas think
[45:40] about Joseph you think Joseph had any
[45:42] particles going in the direction of
[45:43] being a slave in Egypt or how about
[45:45] being in prison in Egypt you think
[45:46] Joseph had any ideas about that you
[45:48] think his particles like
[45:50] that no he had to get his mind wrapped
[45:53] around that well this must be God's will
[45:56] and pretty soon the particles got in
[45:58] line hallelujah amen they got such in
[46:00] line that when his brothers said we're
[46:02] sorry he said it wasn't even you God put
[46:06] me on the potter's wheel Hallelujah God
[46:09] this did this to save life Hallelujah
[46:11] right see all his particles got in the
[46:13] right direction God allows every trial
[46:16] God allows every test it's all forming
[46:18] to God's will just let me be in the
[46:20] center of God's will
[46:22] Hallelujah and after all that once you
[46:24] got the particles in the right situation
[46:26] then you can start
[46:28] forming all the pressure right and
[46:31] create all these different designs or
[46:34] shapes your life gets shaped and then
[46:37] when it's finally done then it goes to
[46:38] the fire where the fire permanently
[46:40] makes it the vessel that God can use
[46:43] what a type of
[46:46] sanctification right because how many
[46:47] how many would be a vessel God can
[46:50] use I think there's a couple types in
[46:52] here I think the soul is the permanent
[46:54] type but I think our whole lives our
[46:56] human Spirit stays on the potter's wheel
[46:58] okay I got two different visuals there
[47:01] two different ideas right once your soul
[47:03] is sealed it's permanently sealed to the
[47:05] day of your Redemption once you're
[47:07] sealed with the Holy Ghost your your
[47:09] soul is like a vessel that God can use
[47:11] for his
[47:13] glory right but your human mind stays in
[47:17] this continual uh process of
[47:20] sanctification trying to get all your
[47:22] thoughts to line up with God's word
[47:23] trying to get all your habits and your
[47:25] desires to line up with God's word am
[47:28] make sure they're all going in the same
[47:31] direction so I think I did a pretty good
[47:33] job remember what you told me H yeah
[47:35] yeah okay yeah she said amen all right
[47:37] yes all those uh vitamins are working
[47:40] brother Jose all those all those herbs I
[47:42] take in the morning they're working
[47:44] Hallelujah mainly it's just getting
[47:46] sleep
[47:47] hallelujah amen thank God God said if if
[47:51] you want if you'll repent he said I'll
[47:53] bring you back to the wheel and I'll
[47:55] make you in a something that honors me
[47:57] hallelujah how many want to honor God
[48:00] Amen Lord keep your hands on my life
[48:03] amen keep shaping me and molding me let
[48:05] me be a vessel of Honor for the glory of
[48:08] God because God's got power to do it I
[48:11] love what brother said they said brother
[48:12] brandom um can you prove your names in
[48:15] The Book of Life he said no I can't
[48:16] prove it he said God could use me as a
[48:18] vessel Of
[48:20] Dishonor see look how humble he
[48:23] was he said in other words he never he
[48:26] never disrespected God he always said
[48:28] God can ultimately do whatever he
[48:32] wants remember one time brother said God
[48:34] you owe me and God left him for I think
[48:36] it was two weeks God never would even
[48:38] talk to him that's a good
[48:40] spanking anybody anybody ever had two
[48:43] weeks in a corner or two weeks in uh
[48:46] isolation what do they call in prison
[48:48] when you get in the what do they call it
[48:50] you you get solitary confinement
[48:52] hopefully nobody's been in solitary
[48:54] confinement
[48:56] right right they'll just let you wait it
[48:58] out all by
[49:00] yourself so brother R came to the spot I
[49:02] realized God don't owe me nothing God
[49:05] can use me however wants so God I say
[49:07] like this just have mercy on me use Me
[49:08] For Your Glory Hallelujah that's my
[49:11] request now I never finish this verse uh
[49:14] from Wednesday
[49:16] night Paul says what if
[49:19] God he's willing to show his wrath and
[49:22] make us power known endures with much
[49:24] longsuffering the best of Wrath fitted
[49:26] to destruction so what if God is being
[49:29] longsuffering on Judas on the popes on
[49:34] Pharaoh right on our current uh White
[49:37] House Administration what if God is just
[49:39] being longsuffering with them because
[49:42] he's eventually going to show his
[49:44] wrath right he's being longsuffering to
[49:47] the vessels of Wrath that he might make
[49:49] known unto you the riches of his glory
[49:51] because you're a vessel of mercy and
[49:54] he's prepared you before forand for his
[49:56] glory amen hallelujah so one type of
[50:00] vessel he's longsuffering with he just
[50:02] has to put up with them the other one he
[50:05] says I'm showing you all my glory he
[50:08] said I'm showing you because I prepared
[50:10] you for this
[50:11] Hallelujah showing you the glory of God
[50:15] oh
[50:16] hallelujah amen Church we're so blessed
[50:19] we get to see God's glory amen not God's
[50:24] Wrath
[50:27] right people always uh I guess they had
[50:28] all those awards for the Hollywood stars
[50:30] a few weeks ago people always say oh
[50:32] what

[50:37] and uh how amazing they look and church
[50:40] every one of them is a drug addict
[50:43] possessed with
[50:44] demons and they just kind of come out
[50:46] like they're so fine and fancy and
[50:48] they're all demon possessed they've all
[50:50] made packs with the devil right but here
[50:53] we are we made a pack with Christ Christ
[50:55] hallelujah amen we get to see God's
[50:59] glory they'll never see God's glory
[51:00] because they're vessels of Dishonor but
[51:02] God shows us The Riches of his Mercy

[51:39] amazing Church look at the glory of God
[51:40] in your life they got to go check
[51:42] themselves in and they never even get
[51:44] fixed we can go check in with God in a
[51:47] prayer meeting and we can come out
[51:48] permanently

[52:20] Ghost amen thank God we can feel God's
[52:23] glory amen amen a man in his 60s brother

[52:33] prince of God because in the presence of

[52:39] those things would die out to you you
[52:42] never desire the porn again because
[52:44] you've been in such a greater presence
[52:46] hallelujah
[52:48] amen I said if you can't find a message
[52:51] church that has the presence of God find
[52:52] the closest thing that's got the
[52:54] presence of God because in the presence
[52:56] of God you'll find Joy you'll find

[53:07] problem he said I'm glad you didn't
[53:09] rebuke me when you emailed me back I
[53:10] said brother I never rebuke you I want
[53:13] to see you saved
[53:14] Hallelujah I got the remedy it ain't me
[53:17] I just know it it's
[53:19] Jesus put yourself on the potter's wheel
[53:22] amen
[53:24] hallelujah and his presence is fullness
[53:26] of joy
[53:33] Hallelujah yes now I I close with this
[53:37] but I never finished
[53:38] it oh God the proud are risen against me
[53:41] and the Assemblies of violent men have
[53:43] sought after my soul and have not set
[53:45] thee before them so David said these
[53:48] Sinners are after me they don't even
[53:50] recognize
[53:52] you but thou oh Lord art a god full of
[53:56] compassion he's got this full universe
[54:00] but he's also got this big heart full of
[54:02] compassion for
[54:04] me amen and gracious and longsuffering
[54:09] and plenteous in Mercy and Truth
[54:13] amen turn unto me and have mercy upon me
[54:17] give thy strength unto thy servant and
[54:19] save the son of thine handmade he brings
[54:23] his mom into it don't forget my mom too
[54:26] I came out of my mom and don't forget
[54:27] her hallelujah amen have mercy you're
[54:31] full of compassion Hallelujah and great
[54:34] is your mercy toward
[54:38] me
[54:39] Hallelujah so see not only does God have
[54:42] mercy and longsuffering on the vessels
[54:43] of Dishonor David is a vessel of honor
[54:47] and he says you're full of Mercy you're
[54:50] full of compassion on me as well sounds
[54:52] like this God is merciful upon everyone
[54:55] amen he
[54:57] is he is
[54:59] hallelujah because the rain falls on the
[55:02] just and the
[55:07] unjust I love this you know I mentioned
[55:09] this on Wednesday the second Peter 3:9
[55:12] said God would that all men be saved God
[55:15] wishes every person would repent even
[55:18] the vessel of Dishonor but of course he
[55:20] had to make him that way by forn
[55:21] knowledge he knew but he still he still
[55:24] invited Cain he said if you just repent
[55:26] you'd rule over your brother but God
[55:28] knew he was a serpent seed right God
[55:31] knew where he came
[55:33] from but yet he still offered him
[55:36] Mercy but God formed him the right God
[55:39] formed him the right way God knew that's
[55:41] kind of best way you wanted to
[55:43] be and I love what Genesis 18 said uh
[55:47] Abraham's praying interceding for lot
[55:49] and he says shall not the judge of the
[55:50] do what's right and church we're
[55:54] the Seed of Abraham
[55:55] we just sing it I Am A Friend Of God he
[55:59] calls me friend how many friends out
[56:01] there we got
[56:02] Hallelujah right and he said you're the
[56:06] judge of the whole earth you'll do
[56:08] what's right amen If Abraham knew God
[56:12] would always judge every situation right
[56:14] well then how much more will he continue
[56:16] to do the same he'll judge our lives
[56:18] right as well amen
[56:22] amen he'll judge right between the
[56:25] Sinner and the
[56:27] saint that's what God is he's a fair
[56:30] judge judge of the whole universe he
[56:32] knows the difference between the wise
[56:34] and foolish
[56:35] virgins one of my preacher friends sent
[56:37] me this nice book it's about uh David
[56:40] and Saul and it's about Saul and Absalon
[56:43] and this man he must have never knew the
[56:44] message because he says he says we don't
[56:46] know the difference between David's and
[56:47] Saul's only God knows I said that's not
[56:50] right God knows the difference between
[56:52] wise and foolish
[56:53] virgins how Hallelujah Samuel knew the
[56:56] difference between David and
[56:58] Saul Hallelujah in other words we can
[57:02] know a real David we can know a wise
[57:04] virgin when we see one because they got
[57:07] the
[57:08] oil
[57:09] Hallelujah they've made the preparations
[57:12] they've got the oil
[57:15] Hallelujah and we can know the
[57:17] difference between a foolish virgin as
[57:19] well we see it
[57:22] often remember all these things God is
[57:25] going to judge all the saved and the
[57:27] lost by their
[57:30] works that's what the Bible said the
[57:31] books will be open and Revelation 20 and
[57:34] he'll judge them he'll separate them
[57:35] sheep as goats and they'll be judged by
[57:38] the things they did in the
[57:41] books
[57:43] right so Church let's look at some of
[57:46] these simple summaries of life you know
[57:48] God's this great God of the universe
[57:50] right but I love there's a few examples
[57:51] of how God just summarizes how our life
[57:54] should be
[57:56] does God want you to S you know
[57:57] sacrifice 10,000 rivers of
[58:00] oil sacrifice your first
[58:03] born so just so your soul can be saved
[58:06] and and God and Micah says the prophet
[58:10] what does the Lord require of
[58:12] you like sometimes we think God requires
[58:14] so much out of our lives and Micah just
[58:17] brings it down humbly what does god
[58:19] require of you just to be just to love
[58:22] mercy and just be humble
[58:25] you're you're on that you're you're just
[58:28] a very tiny Speck of a speck of that
[58:31] entire universe what's god require of
[58:33] you just to love mercy and walk humbly
[58:36] before God just brother Austin we just
[58:39] got to be humble buddy that's all let's
[58:41] just humble ourselves praise God let's
[58:44] just do what's right brother
[58:46] Mercy do what's fair be
[58:49] fair sometimes we comp complicate
[58:53] things
[58:55] like you know some some people uh like
[58:58] like the Rich Young Ruler he had to go
[59:00] sell everything well God never asked
[59:01] Abraham to go sell
[59:03] everything sometimes we comp we
[59:05] complicate things well am I doing
[59:07] everything that I'm supposed to do God
[59:08] will show you exactly what he wants you
[59:10] to do you don't think the god of the
[59:12] whole universe will tell you what to do
[59:15] you think he's going to help you to miss
[59:16] it I think he's going to help you to see
[59:18] it
[59:20] Hallelujah what's he require of you
[59:24] except just to be just merciful and
[59:28] humble another way to summarize it let's
[59:31] let's hear the whole conclusion of the
[59:32] matter one of Austin's favorite books
[59:34] here fear God keep his commands this is
[59:38] the whole duty of man just always honor
[59:42] God and do your best to keep his
[59:44] commands we know nobody's perfect he
[59:45] didn't say be perfect he just said keep
[59:47] them do Jesus said if you love me keep
[59:50] my commands amen for God will bring
[59:53] every work into to judgment and I say
[59:55] God judge my works
[59:57] now so I'm not judged
[1:00:00] later in other words show me if I'm
[1:00:02] doing a a wrong work now if I started

[1:00:51] need of he'll send a preacher in right
[1:00:52] there to preach it to you amen and you

[1:03:46] couple years ago right you are God's
[1:03:49] beloved in that whole universe there's
[1:03:52] only one Galaxy where there's life and
[1:03:55] then that whole galaxy there's only one
[1:03:57] tiny little planet and God said that's
[1:03:59] my
[1:04:00] beloved the people that love me that's
[1:04:03] my beloved
[1:04:06] a oh God loves you church amen oh the
[1:04:10] Bible says you're the apple of his eye

[1:04:16] his eyes is right on
[1:04:18] you amen
[1:04:21] hallelujah and this will come to pass
[1:04:24] now remember before the the Gentile uh
[1:04:27] before the church ages his eye was
[1:04:28] mostly on
[1:04:30] Israel right he was Mo mainly looking at
[1:04:32] Israel he'd have some prelit right but
[1:04:35] now that Israel's rejected Christ now
[1:04:37] he's got his eye on the
[1:04:43] Gentiles ye are not my
[1:04:46] people there shall they be called the
[1:04:49] children of the Living
[1:04:52] God church so we should live live we
[1:04:54] should leave here leave this service
[1:04:55] remembering I am God's
[1:04:57] beloved God is mindful of
[1:05:00] me and I am his
[1:05:04] child he covered me in my mother's
[1:05:07] womb he wants to live in me move in me
[1:05:11] and have my being he wants to control
[1:05:13] all three parts of me Body Spirit Soul
[1:05:20] amen Isaiah also crith concerning Israel
[1:05:23] though the number of the children of
[1:05:24] Israel be as the sand of the sea a
[1:05:26] remant shall be
[1:05:29] saved Hallelujah like I told you there
[1:05:31] is there is as far as I know right now
[1:05:34] now you could you could ask brother
[1:05:35] George Smith but there's at least one
[1:05:37] message Church in Israel there's
[1:05:39] actually Israelis that have believed the
[1:05:41] message Jews all the other ones are
[1:05:44] blinded but not that one message church
[1:05:47] I think the pastor's name is Solomon if
[1:05:48] I'm not mistaken because I remember
[1:05:50] brother George talking about that there
[1:05:52] is one message Church
[1:05:54] that's the remnant that's the remnant
[1:05:56] that's in the Gentile bride we believe
[1:05:58] if they have the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:00] Ghost but there's also a Remnant the
[1:06:02] 144,000
[1:06:04] Hallelujah which will Jesus will show
[1:06:07] himself to them they'll weep from house
[1:06:08] to house and then that Nation will be
[1:06:10] born in one day 144,000 seal with the
[1:06:13] Holy Ghost born children of God in one
[1:06:16] day God's beloved Hallelujah right now
[1:06:19] you're God's
[1:06:21] beloved W thank God and that remember
[1:06:24] that means favorite that's one of the
[1:06:26] meanings of beloved is your God's
[1:06:29] favorite that's hard to swallow
[1:06:31] sometimes I know it's it's true it's
[1:06:35] true maybe I'll show that to you
[1:06:39] again kind of blending uh evening
[1:06:42] service into the morning service
[1:06:45] here sorry I got to put Romans nine on
[1:06:49] there
[1:06:53] beloved
[1:06:55] to be fond
[1:06:58] of to love dearly to be well pleased to
[1:07:01] be tender with for a thing I thought it
[1:07:03] meant favor up to
[1:07:07] LIF I could be wrong on that I thought
[1:07:09] it said favorite there so forgive me
[1:07:12] either way he loves you
[1:07:14] dearly might have got my notes mixed up
[1:07:17] there thought it meant favorite I have
[1:07:20] to look it up I have to go to my
[1:07:21] previous sermons where I preached on it
[1:07:23] maybe I got different concordance
[1:07:27] hallelujah thank God you were not God's
[1:07:30] people but now you're God's
[1:07:33] people you were not his beloved you're
[1:07:35] not the one he loved now you're the one
[1:07:37] God loves
[1:07:38] amen hallelujah makes us joy unspeakable
[1:07:41] full of
[1:07:43] Glory for he will finish the work I'm
[1:07:45] finishing chapter nine I'm going to
[1:07:46] finish it by God's grace and cut it
[1:07:48] short in
[1:07:49] righteousness because a short work work
[1:07:51] will the Lord make upon the Earth
[1:07:53] remember that 20 2,000 years remember
[1:07:54] the 2000 2000 2000 God's going to cut
[1:07:57] this short it don't seem like it but
[1:07:59] God's going to cut it short in
[1:08:03] righteousness and as Isaiah said before
[1:08:06] except the Lord of Sabbath that means
[1:08:08] Lord of hosts Angel
[1:08:11] armies had left us a seed we had been as
[1:08:15] Sodom and been made like unto
[1:08:18] gorah Now isn't that true for you and I
[1:08:22] if it wasn't for God's longsuffering
[1:08:23] uffing and compassion on you we all
[1:08:26] would have been Wicked abominable
[1:08:28] Sinners I
[1:08:31] was right I was I was literally Wicked
[1:08:36] and
[1:08:37] abominal but God left me a
[1:08:40] seed God left me uh uh some hope
[1:08:44] Hallelujah God left me an opportunity
[1:08:45] praise
[1:08:47] God and I would have been as low as
[1:08:49] Sodom Gomorrah had it not been for the
[1:08:51] grace of
[1:08:52] God Hallelujah of course it's speaking
[1:08:55] of Israel as
[1:08:58] well what shall we say then that the
[1:09:00] Gentiles which followed not after
[1:09:02] righteousness have attained to
[1:09:05] righteousness even the righteousness
[1:09:07] which is of Faith Hallelujah so Church
[1:09:11] you and I are given the righteousness of
[1:09:13] Jesus Christ because we have
[1:09:16] faith and faith is the substance of
[1:09:19] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:09:21] Not
[1:09:22] Seen
[1:09:24] another Greek word for it is trust or
[1:09:27] Assurance you and I we have attained
[1:09:30] everybody say
[1:09:31] attained which means possessed you
[1:09:34] possess God's
[1:09:36] righteousness because you trust in
[1:09:38] it
[1:09:41] right so I'm sure there's all been times
[1:09:43] where maybe it felt hard to come to
[1:09:45] church right because you didn't feel
[1:09:46] good enough well why' you come because
[1:09:48] you trusted in his righteousness
[1:09:52] am anybody ever feel like quitting as a
[1:09:54] Christian don't raise your hands I'll
[1:09:56] raise my hand for all of
[1:09:57] you sometimes I feel like I don't know
[1:09:59] how much longer I can go Lord I know how
[1:10:02] much many more battles I can go through
[1:10:04] right it gets
[1:10:06] hard but see in those situations you the
[1:10:09] choice comes down am I going to continue
[1:10:11] or am I G to am I going to leave right
[1:10:14] am I going to be a Castaway well every
[1:10:16] time we always choose to go on because
[1:10:18] it's faith we have faith in his
[1:10:21] righteousness praise God it's already
[1:10:24] something you've attained to it's
[1:10:26] already something you possess it's
[1:10:28] already something God's given you it's a
[1:10:29] gift of Grace
[1:10:31] Hallelujah you have you have attained to
[1:10:34] his
[1:10:36] righteousness we're not saved by works
[1:10:38] we want to do God's work we so
[1:10:40] desperately want to do works that
[1:10:42] sometimes that we we we get confused
[1:10:45] like are we saved or not because we're
[1:10:47] not living up to our own
[1:10:48] expectations right is that
[1:10:51] right but ultimately it comes com down
[1:10:53] to I'm saved by his grace because I've
[1:10:56] obtained his righteousness am Hallelujah
[1:11:00] that's why we keep coming back to church
[1:11:03] right that's why we keep reading our
[1:11:04] Bibles and serving
[1:11:06] Jesus because it's his righteousness
[1:11:09] that we
[1:11:11] possess and I hope to show you this here
[1:11:13] this this was the last thought I'm going
[1:11:15] to share I'm almost at my well hour and
[1:11:17] 10 minutes
[1:11:19] now but Israel which fth after the law
[1:11:22] of righteousness hath not attained to
[1:11:24] the law of righteousness wherefore
[1:11:26] because they sought it not by faith but
[1:11:29] as it were by The Works of the law for
[1:11:31] they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone as
[1:11:35] it is written behold I lay in Zion a
[1:11:37] stumbling Stone in a rock of offense and
[1:11:40] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[1:11:43] ashamed so Israel the Pharisees
[1:11:46] Sadducees and most of the people they
[1:11:48] stumbled at
[1:11:49] Jesus why because they they enjoyed
[1:11:52] their denomination they had their own
[1:11:54] self-righteousness so they stumbled at
[1:11:57] Jesus and they wouldn't accept his
[1:11:59] righteousness his righteousness said
[1:12:01] everybody anybody can be a child of God
[1:12:03] blessed are the meek amen hallelujah
[1:12:06] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:12:07] shall see God hallelujah right but
[1:12:09] they're like you got to be a Pharisee to
[1:12:11] see
[1:12:12] God I mean he made it so everybody had
[1:12:16] God as their
[1:12:17] father Hallelujah but this the the the
[1:12:21] Jews stumbled at that it was too
[1:12:24] simple right they were into doing their
[1:12:26] own Works they were they were caught up
[1:12:29] in developing their own
[1:12:31] righteousness right they like going to
[1:12:34] the the temple the synagogue and buying
[1:12:36] their own sacrifice which the Bible said
[1:12:38] was a sin they should have brought their
[1:12:40] own
[1:12:42] sacrifice they enjoyed just pretending
[1:12:45] church so they stumbled over
[1:12:47] that but God gave them a seed God had
[1:12:51] some Peters and James and John in there
[1:12:54] God had some real believers who would
[1:12:56] trust in the righteousness of Christ and
[1:12:58] not their own righteousness hallelujah
[1:13:01] amen and God was very longsuffering with
[1:13:04] them they wanted to call fire down from
[1:13:06] heaven as soon as somebody disagree with
[1:13:07] them and Jesus said you don't even know
[1:13:09] what Spirit you're of they want to judge
[1:13:11] everybody that didn't follow them you
[1:13:13] can't preach unless you're a part of our
[1:13:15] church Jesus said if they're not against
[1:13:17] me they're for me let let them
[1:13:20] go hallelujah amen he was merciful he
[1:13:24] was patient he was longsuffering
[1:13:29] Hallelujah most people stumbled it was
[1:13:31] just too simple what do you mean just
[1:13:34] believe and I'm saved that's all I got
[1:13:36] to do sisters sir is just believe in
[1:13:38] Christ and I'm saved that that's right
[1:13:40] yeah that's
[1:13:41] right but if I believe I'll repent of my
[1:13:45] sins right and I'll fall in love with
[1:13:47] Jesus and I'll sayl you save me now Lord
[1:13:49] what can I do for you
[1:13:52] Hallelujah
[1:13:54] and you're saying that while he's going
[1:13:55] like this
[1:14:01] boom still got some more air in
[1:14:05] there
[1:14:07] Hallelujah that's the beginning of just
[1:14:09] that's the beginning of sanctification
[1:14:10] right he justified you that's he's
[1:14:12] you're his clay now he's got to start
[1:14:14] cleaning you out get all those particles
[1:14:16] going the same direction get all the air
[1:14:18] out of
[1:14:20] there they stumbled at it because they
[1:14:22] wanted their own
[1:14:26] righteousness so I want to I want to
[1:14:28] close with
[1:14:30] this we can say we've obtained Christ's
[1:14:35] righteousness that's
[1:14:37] true but there's something we haven't
[1:14:40] attained to
[1:14:42] yet so let me just say like this we've
[1:14:44] made progress on the on the way of
[1:14:47] Holiness can I say it like that but
[1:14:49] we're not quite
[1:14:51] finished so I want you I want you to
[1:14:53] believe that scripture sister beatric
[1:14:55] you've obtained the righteousness of
[1:14:57] Christ you've attained it it's
[1:14:59] yours but keep reaching to attain more
[1:15:01] by God's grace amen hallelujah
[1:15:06] understand you have attained you've made
[1:15:08] it brother Austin you're you're there
[1:15:11] right in one way brother Mercy we've
[1:15:12] attained it we're there we got salvation
[1:15:15] Hallelujah but there's more to attain to
[1:15:17] by God's grace Israel has not attained
[1:15:20] to to to righteousness by faith but we
[1:15:24] have we are we are righteous through the
[1:15:27] blood of Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ so I just don't want you forget
[1:15:31] that you've obtained it you're God's
[1:15:33] child you're his
[1:15:35] beloved he loves you
[1:15:37] dearly you you you have that that's your
[1:15:40] possession that's your Birthright
[1:15:42] hallelujah amen you're in the family of
[1:15:44] God you're his
[1:15:47] beloved but you haven't attained more
[1:15:51] there's more things that we will attain
[1:15:52] by the grace of
[1:15:54] God and here's where Paul says it and I
[1:15:58] want to be found how many want to be
[1:15:59] found in Christ not having my own
[1:16:02] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:16:04] that which is through the Faith of
[1:16:06] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[1:16:09] by
[1:16:11] faith that I may know him and the power
[1:16:15] of his resurrection and the fellowship
[1:16:17] of his sufferings being made conformable
[1:16:20] unto his death
[1:16:24] Hallelujah okay now look here you you've
[1:16:27] attained it so here this what I want to
[1:16:28] show you you've attained
[1:16:30] salvation you're a child of God you you
[1:16:34] have that you have his
[1:16:35] righteousness but here he
[1:16:37] says now not as though I already
[1:16:41] attained talking about the resurrection
[1:16:43] that's the Rapture if by any means I
[1:16:45] might attain to the resurrection of the
[1:16:46] dead so Paul's telling us you're saved
[1:16:48] you've attained salvation but you want
[1:16:50] to attain the
[1:16:52] rapture I've got this but there's more
[1:16:55] for me to get by God's
[1:16:57] grace I'm not going to be lost because
[1:16:59] I've already attained it Hallelujah I'm
[1:17:00] going to be saved but by any means by
[1:17:03] any measure I want to make the Rapture
[1:17:07] Hallelujah that's what I'm trying to
[1:17:08] attain to the first resurrection
[1:17:11] Hallelujah that I want to attain to the
[1:17:14] resurrection of dead I want to be there
[1:17:16] when Hallelujah we shall rise on that
[1:17:18] Resurrection
[1:17:19] morning amen not as though it attain or
[1:17:23] either were already perfect but I follow
[1:17:26] after that I may apprehend that for
[1:17:28] which also I am H apprehended of Christ
[1:17:32] Jesus amen so something has apprehended
[1:17:35] me and I want to apprehend that
[1:17:38] Hallelujah I want to understand I want
[1:17:40] to I want to possess what's possessing
[1:17:42] me
[1:17:43] Hallelujah Glory Brethren I count not
[1:17:47] myself to have apprehended but this one
[1:17:50] thing I do forgetting those things which
[1:17:52] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[1:17:54] things which are before I press toward
[1:17:56] the mark for the prize of the High
[1:17:58] Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:18:03] Hallelujah so see we have obtained the
[1:18:05] righteousness of Christ but we are
[1:18:08] striving for this uh attaining of the
[1:18:13] Rapture Hallelujah but Satan will come
[1:18:15] around and say see you will never make
[1:18:17] the Rapture because you don't even
[1:18:18] you're not even saved nope I've already
[1:18:20] attained it
