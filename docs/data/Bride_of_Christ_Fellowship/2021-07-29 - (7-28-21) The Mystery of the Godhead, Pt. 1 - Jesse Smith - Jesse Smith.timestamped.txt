[0:00] all treasures sorry of wisdom and
[0:02] knowledge sorry i didn't tell you i was
[0:03] gonna read verse three
[0:05] let's go to uh jeremiah 29 please verse
[0:07] 11 jeremiah 29
[0:14] 11.
[0:19] bless you in jesus name
[0:23] jeremiah 29 11 let's read 11 12 13.
[0:27] remember if we do these things then
[0:28] we'll be found of god you know i would
[0:30] say like this you know we
[0:32] if we're born again then if we are born
[0:34] again those of us who are
[0:36] then we have truly sought god with all
[0:38] of our hearts even our souls
[0:40] right and then we've found him we've
[0:42] been we've received his
[0:44] own life but then maybe like daniel
[0:47] or like brother branham maybe lord or
[0:50] saints
[0:50] as the lord allows us to be here maybe
[0:53] we'll have to seek him again right
[0:54] before the rapture
[0:56] you know just like david had this i'm
[0:58] sorry daniel had to seek god for 21 days
[1:01] to get the revelation of where exactly
[1:03] how close he was
[1:05] to the next junction of time right
[1:08] so perhaps we'll do it again now we want
[1:09] to see god every day right but
[1:11] there's something about seeking god with
[1:13] all your heart
[1:15] right so let's read jeremiah 29 11 12
[1:18] and 13.
[1:19] on three one two three for i know the
[1:23] thoughts that i think toward you
[1:25] saith the lord thoughts of peace and not
[1:28] of
[1:29] evil to give you an expected end
[1:32] then shall ye call upon me and ye shall
[1:35] go
[1:36] and pray unto me and i will hearken unto
[1:39] you
[1:40] and ye shall seek me and find me when ye

[1:59] of our attention lord with love

[2:03] the wisdom and the treasures that we
[2:05] just heard about
[2:06] that are hidden in the godhead
[2:08] hallelujah and we know the godhead is
[2:10] here the holy ghost is here hallelujah
[2:12] and so lord just help us to receive of
[2:14] you tonight and we pray you'll just
[2:16] speak to us in a special way in jesus
[2:17] christ's name and the saint said
[2:19] amen god bless you as being seated
[2:21] praise god
[2:25] hopefully uh they're up on the
[2:26] livestream my wife sent me a text i just
[2:28] saw it and
[2:28] hopefully she got the live stream here
[2:31] we went a little bit longer i kind of
[2:32] lost track of time
[2:35] uh
[2:38] so i want to uh just kind of go through
[2:41] uh
[2:42] a few thoughts here i don't know how
[2:43] many sermons will do on this
[2:47] and even you know as we looked at the
[2:48] bible study on sunday night there's
[2:50] numerous things i didn't put in the book
[2:51] that i just
[2:52] they didn't come to me while i was
[2:53] writing it like the throne right the
[2:56] throne in revelation the ancient of days
[2:57] which was a tremendous question
[2:59] and a very helpful one but perhaps
[3:01] there'll be future editions i don't know
[3:03] uh
[3:04] but or we could just do youtube videos
[3:05] on it but uh it's such an
[3:07] amazing subject right such a massive
[3:09] subject any subject about god
[3:11] would probably be a large subject right
[3:12] because he's infinite uh but
[3:15] anyways we just try to do the best we
[3:16] could and give everyone a biblical
[3:18] foundation
[3:20] about god and be able to show how god is
[3:23] not
[3:23] three co-equal separate co-eternal
[3:27] persons right
[3:29] but he's one person who reveals himself
[3:32] in three ways to redeem mankind
[3:35] praise god now just notice uh if you
[3:37] notice from our scripture
[3:39] colossians two verse two it says the
[3:41] mystery of god
[3:43] now notice county's god and of the
[3:46] father
[3:47] and of christ did you notice it never
[3:49] mentions the holy ghost
[3:52] what does that mean god's four persons
[3:53] then no see
[3:55] paul sometimes paul will use father son
[3:57] and holy ghost
[3:58] you know he'll use greetings like that
[4:00] sometimes he doesn't in fact numerous
[4:02] times he doesn't i mention that later in
[4:03] the chapter
[4:04] but right at the beginning of the
[4:05] chapter i just point out that notice
[4:07] what he calls it father
[4:08] god and christ he never mentions the
[4:10] holy ghost
[4:12] see because paul wasn't a trinitarian
[4:14] paul knew that god and the father were
[4:16] the self-same person
[4:18] praise god and god was and paul was able
[4:20] just to call out the titles
[4:22] because he knew it was all the self-same
[4:24] person
[4:25] okay so trinitarians can never make the
[4:27] case that well
[4:28] every time paul talked about the godhead
[4:30] he said three persons he never did
[4:32] he never said father son holy ghost
[4:34] every time he talked about god and the
[4:35] father
[4:36] and christ he didn't do that and so it
[4:39] must be
[4:39] uh acknowledged there that paul was not
[4:42] a trinitarian and he never taught it
[4:44] praise god
[4:46] and notice all the wisdom that we could
[4:48] want is in the holy ghost now how do you
[4:49] get the holy ghost
[4:50] you repent and be baptized get
[4:52] sanctified and you're filled with the
[4:54] holy ghost then church if you're born
[4:55] again
[4:56] you have access jesus said i'm guiding
[4:58] you into all truth
[5:00] so that means you have access to all the
[5:02] wisdom right because it's all truth
[5:04] he's going to lead you into all the
[5:05] wisdom you need for your spiritual
[5:07] journey how many kids amen to that
[5:09] if you're born again it's just going to
[5:11] come to you praise god hallelujah
[5:13] you won't have to go wondering where is
[5:17] it where is it if you are born again
[5:19] the truth will come to you because the
[5:21] holy ghost is inside of you
[5:22] and in him is all the treasures of all
[5:25] that you could ask for every spiritual
[5:27] blessing is already in you praise god
[5:30] see
[5:33] so uh but notice also we must
[5:37] acknowledge it is mysterious
[5:38] i think that's what we can see right
[5:40] it's it's very mysterious
[5:42] still because we see the ancient of days
[5:45] in daniel 7. he's white
[5:46] i'm sorry he's got white hair like wool
[5:49] and then we see a son of man come and
[5:51] stand before him
[5:53] right so we see the body of jesus
[5:55] standing by the throne of god
[5:57] where there's some sort of theophany
[5:58] there right unless that theophany change
[6:01] its form and vanish or change to a
[6:03] pillar of fire
[6:04] we're not not sure how we we we're not
[6:06] sure what happened
[6:07] in revelation 5 all we see is the bible
[6:10] said a lamb
[6:11] stood there in the midst of the throne
[6:13] and come and took the book but we're not
[6:15] told about two persons
[6:17] well we don't even know we don't we're
[6:18] not even told who's on the throne right
[6:20] there's
[6:20] there's just lightning around the throne
[6:22] there's just thunder i mean
[6:23] we don't even know anything on the
[6:26] throne there's no
[6:27] body spoken up on the throne we just see
[6:29] a lamb
[6:30] come and take the book and he's a lamb
[6:32] like he's slain praise god amen
[6:34] thank god oh that heavenly god there's a
[6:37] heavenly witness
[6:38] of a sacrifice for you and i amen
[6:40] there's a sacrifice right now
[6:42] standing there in heaven for you and i
[6:44] it's the bleeding bloody lamb thank god
[6:48] that our lamb that makes us perfect is
[6:50] there in heaven right now
[6:52] to appear in the presence of god for you
[6:54] and i
[6:55] us wretched men yet we're also men that
[6:58] have no condemnation praise god
[7:01] us sinners but yet we're not sinners
[7:03] because the seed of god cannot sin amen
[7:06] thank god there's a lamb standing there
[7:08] for us hallelujah
[7:10] hallelujah but we acknowledge it's
[7:13] mysterious we'll never be able to prove
[7:14] to a trinitarian
[7:16] uh that it's not mysterious it is
[7:18] mysterious and we acknowledge that we're
[7:21] not blind
[7:22] uh we're not blind crazy people or
[7:25] ignoramuses brother brennan brandon
[7:27] brother adam calls it brother said use
[7:29] all your intellect he said but use also
[7:31] all the power of god in other words
[7:34] don't throw out your intellect and
[7:35] you're thinking use your wisdom right
[7:37] but also trust in the power of god
[7:38] hallelujah
[7:41] and i've seen that even the debate i had
[7:42] i've seen now the holy ghost i already
[7:43] told you but gave me wisdom regarding
[7:45] the godhead
[7:46] that's what we do we use all of our
[7:48] intellect but then when we don't have
[7:49] the answer
[7:49] the holy ghost brings the answer praise
[7:51] god
[7:53] see we must only know god based upon his
[7:55] word
[7:56] praise god because satan is going to try
[7:58] if he can just get us on
[8:00] one word and deceive us on one thing he
[8:02] can get us to sin
[8:04] as he proved with eve in the garden but
[8:07] we've got to be a pure bride amen
[8:10] we've got to be a spiritual bride amen a
[8:12] spiritual virgin bride
[8:14] who has the life of god who will not
[8:16] change one word of god
[8:18] she won't accept one thing changed she
[8:19] only wants the pure word of god
[8:22] we've got to be faithful and the bible
[8:25] says that
[8:26] christ here the bible says is in christ
[8:29] is the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[8:32] in the knowledge of him now church
[8:35] we often fail in this i fail this but
[8:37] let's just be honest brother brahm said
[8:39] pray for what most
[8:40] revelation did he not so
[8:44] so we need to be often praying for that
[8:46] more praise god and let's
[8:47] when we close tonight let's pray for
[8:48] revelation praise god
[8:50] because that's what the holy spirit
[8:52] gives us the spirit of
[8:54] wisdom and revelation praise god
[8:58] that's where church we've seen so many
[9:00] churches fall away proving they don't
[9:01] have revelation
[9:03] like some of them will say if if you go
[9:06] too hard on the drums and
[9:08] then you don't have the holy ghost and
[9:10] yet your life can be more holy than
[9:11] theirs
[9:12] in other words they make music a dogma
[9:15] right
[9:16] or if you if you clap on a certain beat
[9:18] you know there's churches in ohio the
[9:19] messenger churches
[9:20] that say if you clap on the offbeat
[9:22] you're it's from satan
[9:24] you're deceived by satan i'm like you
[9:26] haven't been to churches
[9:27] very far like down south have you or
[9:30] churches around the world have you
[9:31] anyone that likes to be
[9:32] and likes to move and worse you must
[9:34] have not been to you'd be surprised
[9:36] what people think but see church that
[9:38] just shows they're not
[9:39] into the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[9:42] like a christian should be
[9:44] because they're making their own
[9:45] man-made creeds and denominations
[9:47] jesus christ did not send a prophet to
[9:49] start a denomination
[9:51] he sent a prophet to finish the mystery
[9:53] of god and show that jesus christ is the
[9:55] same yesterday today and forever praise
[9:57] god
[9:59] not to start denominations and dogmas
[10:01] increase
[10:02] and divide the body but to give the body
[10:05] the power of the holy ghost
[10:06] to discern the spirit of the antichrist
[10:09] in the framework of the church
[10:13] and the same churches that do that
[10:14] basically divide other message churches
[10:16] so they're not bringing unity they're
[10:17] actually bringing division
[10:19] because a tree is known by its fruit
[10:21] saints
[10:22] hallelujah praise god amen
[10:25] see it's the spirit of wisdom and
[10:27] revelation
[10:29] in the knowledge of the godhead in the
[10:31] knowledge of the holy ghost
[10:34] see so this is what we've got and
[10:36] remember this revelation comes from the
[10:38] father
[10:38] because peter got it from the father
[10:40] jesus said jesus said my flesh did not
[10:43] reveal this
[10:44] unto you but my father which is in
[10:48] heaven
[10:48] revealed to you who i am church the same
[10:51] is true today that's why we don't need
[10:52] william branham here
[10:54] or even the literal body of jesus christ
[10:56] he said it's better than i go
[10:58] because when the holy ghost comes he'll
[11:00] teach you all things amen
[11:02] if we have the right understanding of
[11:04] the godhead it'll prove
[11:06] that we've been taught by the holy
[11:07] spirit and not by a man hallelujah
[11:14] and many of these people that leave the
[11:15] message that's what that first thing
[11:17] they go back is to the trinity
[11:20] and they get re-baptized in the titles
[11:22] father son holy ghost
[11:23] and ignore the five examples in the book
[11:25] of acts by holy ghost-filled men
[11:28] what they call giants of the faith and
[11:31] they can't even follow the giants of the
[11:33] faith right
[11:34] because they're because they're they're
[11:36] giantly deceived i'll say it like that
[11:39] oh my but remember church it is the name
[11:43] of jesus christ
[11:44] the water baptism that unlocks the
[11:46] godhead
[11:48] if we can see that there's one name to
[11:50] the father and the son and the holy
[11:52] ghost
[11:53] if we can see that one name it will
[11:55] unlock everything because it means the
[11:57] godhead
[11:58] has one name which one name represents
[12:00] one person praise god
[12:02] amen and that's a great revelation that
[12:05] struck me when i was writing this
[12:06] chapter i don't know what page it's on
[12:08] but the bible said man was made in the
[12:10] image of god
[12:13] and man is a three-part being praise god
[12:16] so if a man is not three persons if a
[12:18] woman is one person with three
[12:21] uh three parts then so is god that was
[12:24] just a simple revelation that struck me
[12:27] because we are in the image of god so if
[12:29] god is there's three
[12:31] that then we're three but not three
[12:33] persons
[12:34] three parts or three manifestations
[12:36] there's brother says three
[12:38] offices hallelujah so we have an office
[12:41] of the body
[12:42] we have an office of the mind spirit and
[12:44] we have an office of the
[12:46] soul praise god see where that's a great
[12:48] revelation that came to me very simple
[12:50] but i
[12:50] had people on facebook a few years ago
[12:51] tell me that was so powerful it really
[12:53] helped them out
[12:54] so i thank the lord for that simple
[12:55] humble wisdom praise god
[12:57] because i only get that by meditating on
[12:59] the word now church the confusion about
[13:01] the godhead
[13:02] is how many persons is he now church
[13:04] there's 7.3
[13:06] billion people on the earth listen
[13:10] 2.3 billion are christian and most of
[13:13] those
[13:14] are pagan idolaters believing these
[13:16] three gods
[13:18] think about that almost a third of the
[13:22] entire world
[13:23] believes god is three gods yet claiming
[13:26] to be in the true faith
[13:29] another 1.1 billion are hindus
[13:33] and hindus believe in thousands of god
[13:35] but they have they have one
[13:37] uh one main trinity of the most powerful
[13:40] gods i'll show you that in a little bit
[13:42] so right there is let's see two three
[13:45] there's four billion right there
[13:47] almost 4 billion now there's 2 billion
[13:50] people that are atheists and agnostics
[13:52] and they don't worship any god
[13:54] except the god of this world satan right
[13:57] so they
[13:57] so they also believe in many gods sports
[14:00] money
[14:00] sex you all these things see that
[14:02] they're believing multiple gods right
[14:05] right uh and so see now that's already
[14:08] up to uh
[14:09] six billion and the last group
[14:13] is the muslims which are about two
[14:14] billion and they believe in one person
[14:17] but yet they have a devilish uh religion
[14:20] as well
[14:22] so see uh less than a third right
[14:26] so about a fourth of the world actually
[14:28] believes in one person god and you have
[14:30] the jews are very small remember there's
[14:32] only going to be 144 000
[14:34] that are actually true believers right
[14:35] that really get the holy ghost
[14:37] i think how small the message groups are
[14:39] around the world so there's a ver
[14:41] we're part of a very small group and
[14:45] and even in that group there's a tiny
[14:46] tiny minority
[14:48] who actually know that the one god's
[14:50] name is jesus christ amen
[14:52] hallelujah some of them still think it's
[14:54] father or god or something like that
[14:57] but there's one name above all names
[15:00] every name in the family in heaven and
[15:01] earth and all the angels have to bow to
[15:04] that's the name of the lord jesus christ
[15:07] so it's a great confusion in other words
[15:09] 75 percent of this world believe in
[15:11] multiple gods
[15:13] or worship multiple gods and some of
[15:16] them it's like the unknown god they
[15:17] don't even know
[15:18] that they're worshiping these gods right
[15:20] of course we know the unknown god in
[15:21] acts 17 was actually the god of the
[15:23] god of the bible but i'm saying people
[15:26] today say there's no god so they're
[15:27] worshiping unknown gods right they're
[15:29] they're worshiping demonic spirits so
[15:32] the revelation is god is one person
[15:34] but he eternally will exist in one body
[15:37] the body of the lord jesus christ
[15:41] that's the revelation now go to matthew
[15:44] 13
[15:45] 33 this is important text here
[15:53] this was such a beautiful revelation to
[15:55] me as well i never heard anybody preach
[15:57] it by the william it just
[15:58] i felt like the holy ghost just gave it
[15:59] to me
[16:02] matthew 13 33
[16:07] this is a one verse parable
[16:11] now this is either the church
[16:14] the true church or the false church
[16:17] you judge you already know what i'm
[16:19] going to say
[16:20] for all of our even our young people
[16:22] that may not understand it
[16:25] you judge another parable
[16:28] spay key unto them the kingdom of heaven
[16:30] is like unto leaven
[16:33] which a woman took and hid in three
[16:35] measures of meal to the whole was leaven
[16:37] now
[16:37] this is either a natural woman no
[16:39] actually there's three it could be the
[16:40] natural woman in other words
[16:42] can we get into the kingdom of heaven by
[16:44] making bread
[16:46] right so is it a natural first or
[16:48] spiritual interpretation
[16:50] well it ain't natural because if if you
[16:52] get the kingdom of heaven by bacon bread
[16:55] there's a lot of bakers that are born
[16:56] again right let's
[16:58] let's go down the street and we'll meet
[17:00] some people that are born again they're
[17:01] just making bread
[17:02] so see it cannot be a natural
[17:05] interpretation
[17:06] it's got to be spiritual then there's
[17:07] only two spirits amen
[17:10] there's either the holy or the unholy so
[17:13] let's go with the holy first
[17:14] some person some sweet person told me
[17:16] this was the holy church
[17:19] what church would put leaven which
[17:22] always represents sin
[17:24] in meal and meal always types christ
[17:28] he was the meal offering in the old
[17:30] testament he was the meal that elijah
[17:33] threw in the pod amen
[17:34] and the pot was healed amen jesus heals
[17:37] everywhere where he's accepted amen
[17:41] he's ground up all every particle's
[17:43] ground up the same
[17:44] because he's the same yesterday today
[17:46] and forever amen
[17:48] hallelujah so who's this meal if this is
[17:51] the true church
[17:52] why would the church inject sin into
[17:55] three
[17:56] measures of truth
[18:01] that doesn't even fit the word of god
[18:03] the bible says that jesus
[18:05] is coming for a bride who made herself
[18:08] ready
[18:09] and she's going to be washed she's going
[18:10] to be spotless there it is right there
[18:12] is she he gonna be spotless blameless
[18:15] well without
[18:16] spot wrinkle or blemish that's the kind
[18:18] of bride christ is coming for amen
[18:22] he said keep he said keep the feast in
[18:24] in sincerity
[18:25] with unleavened bread hallelujah praise
[18:28] god so this woman
[18:30] cannot be you and i it cannot be the
[18:32] true church
[18:33] it must be that devilish mother hearted
[18:36] amen
[18:37] because there's only two people too is
[18:39] either the good spirit or the wrong one
[18:40] praise god
[18:42] a one verse scripture so that's why i
[18:44] know the holy ghost revealed this to me
[18:46] because it can't be anybody else right
[18:49] can't be natural it can't be the holy
[18:51] church
[18:51] it's got to be that demonic mother
[18:54] harlot church
[18:56] hallelujah see
[18:59] so what is it what'd she do notice when
[19:01] did she add the 11
[19:03] in the beginning of the baking process
[19:06] way before it got full 11.
[19:08] she added it at the beginning when was
[19:11] this trinity
[19:12] doctrine introduced the word trinity was
[19:15] first put into the place in the
[19:17] third sec second century 180
[19:20] 80 a.d so 80 years
[19:24] after john died this woman started
[19:26] injecting leaven
[19:28] into the three measures of the father
[19:30] son and holy ghost because he's he's the
[19:32] meal he's the word
[19:33] he's the bread he said i am the bread of
[19:36] life amen
[19:37] hallelujah what woman introduced leaven
[19:41] into this holy meal the roman catholic
[19:44] church
[19:45] and it spread it's now spread for almost
[19:48] 2
[19:48] 000 years from about well
[19:52] about 1700 years right because it's been
[19:55] 1919 years since
[19:57] jesus raised from the dead right and
[19:59] then this started about 100 180 a.d
[20:01] right so about 1700 years or so right
[20:04] about 700 years till the whole thing is
[20:08] leaven and look at the church that
[20:09] started this doctrine
[20:11] is or is or is not the catholic doctrine
[20:14] 11
[20:15] is it is it total 11 or not what do you
[20:17] think
[20:18] absolutely i've got the catechism at
[20:20] home i can show you
[20:21] it's full of sin it's full of leaven
[20:24] it's full of pope worship it's full of
[20:27] statue worship can you imagine coming
[20:29] here today and i said sister let's bow
[20:32] down at this statue here can you imagine
[20:33] if i said that
[20:35] we're not going to worship it we're just
[20:36] going to venerate it
[20:38] well you might as well worship it
[20:40] because venerate or honor the same thing
[20:42] as worship amen
[20:44] aren't you glad church you have to come
[20:46] here and trust in a statue
[20:48] or in a man-made device of art but you
[20:50] get to pull
[20:51] from all god's invisible spirits and who
[20:55] are all treasured with their heads but
[20:57] they're in your soul
[20:58] praise god aren't you glad church
[21:04] i went
[43:36] you
