in here okay all right I thought maybe cuz I wore my long johns or something I'm I'm kind of sensitive to the cold even having grown up in Wisconsin I I like to be warm and all that too so all right let's try that course or song I worship thee Almighty God there is none like [Music] [Music] [Music] for you are my righteousness [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let's try that course - there is none like you no one else can touch my heart like you do I get key down there brother for me there is not like you no one else and touched my heart like [Music] [Music] there is not for you are my righteousness ship you all my [Music] there is no there is not and there is not like a meant let's just raise our hands and worship Him this morning just tell him Lord there's none like him he's above all he's greater than all how much he means to us thank you we think like the the writer in the Book of Psalms said it is good to praise the Lord and it is good to sing unto how many men it truly is good I think of another song I don't even know how to sing it but it was some it's a southern gospel song it goes something like he is to me my comfort he is to me my joy he is to me all these different things he is to me you know there's just so many so many thinks he is to us believers Amen let's try one in a line of the season here I will come let us adore him this is actually a good song year-round musty socks are but I'm hoping I'm hoping it comes right up here but I think I can get it started we can let's try that first verse there go come with us I'm sorry o come all ye faithful right I'm sorry about that [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh hey man you may have your seats as my wife and girls come with their son [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] let's stand and we'll sing one more song so we're changing the order of the service one thing brother Jesse and I did not discuss was a collection or an offering doesn't seem to be a big priority and a lot of I'm gonna call it Full Gospel believers churches you know but I'm sure if you need to give there's a brother here that wants to help with that you're welcome to coming up and tell me what we need to do or if there's a box out there I'm sure you're aware of it so we know giving is part of worship thank you brother it was getting ready to ask for that now let's sing that song i'd i think the title of it is my open heart or i will give to use the first verse brother Soriano from the Philippines wrote that one in brother Jesse adopted it for congregational use and I heard him sing it here when we were here a few years back so do you still sing that one do you yeah we're not sure we're not sure okay hmm well I gave brother Jesse a list and he approved it so I know he knows the song he knows it I'm gonna have to talk to him about that that's a good song - it's a really good song and I thought it was a really good idea to sing it congregation was the only person I ever heard do that but I guess we'll have to work on that some of the tongue let's just sing my old standby then thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you for saving my soul [Music] thank you for giving to great salvation so rich and free you know let's bow our heads and our hearts as we prepare to go into the word Lord we thank you for this time together we thank you for you traveling mercies we thank you for the prayer and prayer requests and songs and the special and just all the licks of fire that have come together here this morning to give you praise for your work as we approach this next stage of the service load we just ask you to its divided with us and help us to maintain our concentration and their minds not to be pulled out for the directions but may that atmosphere that's been set by the worship just help us to help the seed to be sowed in fertile ground and may we go forth from here and bring forth much fruit for thee in Jesus name we pray amen amen well you're standing we can turn together to our text which is Isaiah chapter 33 and verse 6 and that reads and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of that times and strength of salvation the fear of the Lord is his treasure amen you may be seated and if you could just turn this screen on brother I've got the slide ready there's is just a title slide for this message this little message titled true gold Lord kind of blessed me with some years ago 2015-2016 and I've been preaching it everywhere I go which isn't too many places but it's been to Virginia and a couple other up into Canada actually we were working there with helping a little group there for a little bit there but the word gold is in the Bible 419 times so it's a very biblical topic and as we know there's real gold and then there's something we commonly call fool's gold I'm just gonna flip over here okay and this here on the screen is the Mojave nugget which is California's largest gold nugget that's real gold 156 ounces in just under ten pounds so it'd be a nice chunk of gold to have if you had your hands on it knowing the approximate value of gold we'll talk about that later but we all know gold is very valuable and then you all may you may not know but fool's gold is not very valuable and in the next slide we're going to look at a piece of that which I think is in a museum somewhere and fool's gold is commonly known as iron pyrite or pyrite so for purp says of this morning I'm going to be calling it pyrite a lot and probably fool's gold interchange a little bit but it's all the same thing and we'll get into that a little more as we go on in our pictures the false gold or the fool's gold actually looks better than the real if you look at this beautiful squared off crystals on the fool's gold and this lumpy Miss shapen real gold you look at you think which one would you rather have well if you didn't know the difference you might rather have the one that looked better natural gold tends to be irregularly shaped and iron pyrite comes as either cubes or multi faceted crystals so this is not just a one unusual example but is typically how they appear and this is a good type of real life for many times what looks good to us is not so good think of Hebrews 11 24 through 26 by faith Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God and rejected the riches and power of Egypt and fool's gold is actually a mineral called iron pyrite and it is distinguishable from gold by its hardness brittleness and crystal form so we're going to start talking about the characteristics of fool's gold or iron pyrite it is unstable in the natural environment in nature it is always being created or being destroyed iron pyrite exposed to air and water decomposes into iron oxides and sulfate now I had to go on and read the encyclopedia so to speak or Wikipedia as we call it today to learn all this stuff because I didn't know this either but when they're mining and digging through the earth these reactions occur more rapidly because the pyrite as they're digging through and blasting through going underground it comes it gets into the air in fine crystals and dust this reactions take place more quickly when it's in little bitty pieces like that and this instability means that iron pyrite gives off energy which can cause mining shafts to collapse or dust explosions in mining shafts now we probably all heard about explosions in mines collapses miners being trapped underground and we've probably heard the term of sealing off in mind now a big part of the reason they do that is because they're trying to keep this pyrite in that mine from reacting with air so if they seal it off it's secure or safe because the air can't get in there and cause explosions and collapses and things like that all because of the reactivity of pyrite or fool's gold now there are other kind of pyrites but iron pyrite is one of the most common types of pyrite sand pyrites by the way which we're going to get you later are the most common type of minerals now this iron pyrite also gives off an acid in its reactivity and this acid can cause polluted streams something like acid rain but they call it acid mine runoff so it's really a damaging product I would say product but it's not a product it's a element or something in creation the instability of iron pyrite also causes problems with building materials buildings stone containing pyrite tends to stain Brown as the pyrite oxidizes now what oxidizes means is simply reacts with oxygen we call that rust how many have cars out there vans or trucks I'm going to know what rust is hopefully if you're looking at yours you're not seeing too much rust because it just eats your vehicle away doesn't it you know that's what oxidation is so in this case you're building a building you got a beautiful white columns of stone you know on the outside of your building and the next thing you know this Brown is running down the front of your building and it came from within the stone how do you fix it you know the presence of pyrite in the aggregate used to make concrete can lead to severe deterioration as the pyrite oxidizes there's a lot of big words in there but again concrete we're all familiar with concrete can I get a show of hands someone that's familiar with concrete all right good young children concrete is a building material and we use it typically for foundations and floors although in many countries they use it for walls and ceilings as well and concrete is formed from aggregate which is basically the word aggregate means things put together kind of like cooking pancakes that would be an aggregate of ax sorts but so you put a little gravel in you put a little sand in you put a little water in you mix it all up and then you pour it out in your form or out on your floor and once the water dissolves or evaporates out of the concrete it hardens up and becomes this really nice solid strong foundation so but somewhere into that mix got a little bit of this iron pyrite Fool's Gold and now because there's pyrite in there the concrete is severely deteriorated in other words it's crumbling the foundation on your house is crumbling maybe your house begins to tilt a little bit because it was a little bit this iron pyrite so we're finding out that gold is valuable and iron pyrite is almost detrimental it's it's problem causing even though it looks good in the early 2009 problems with Chinese drywall imported into the United States after Hurricane Katrina were attributed to oxidation of pyrite so once again pyrite was found to cause trouble with drywall that had got into in the United States in Canada and more recently in Ireland where it was used as underfloor infill that's like floors and basements and stuff like that pyrite contamination has caused major structural damage modern tests for aggregate materials certify such materials as free of pyrite so there they're trying to make sure this doesn't get into the concrete now now on the other hand iron pyrite does have several uses the main use of iron pirate is for the production of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid which is a highly corrosive substance in other words one of the most useful things of pyrite is to create an acid which can burn or destroy a person so it continues exhibiting a very destructive nature now I know sulfuric acid has some uses and industry and things like that but it's not a real pleasant substance pyrite can also be used to start fires by striking it against steel so the reactivity of pyrite just can cause all kinds of problems Fyers acid acid runoff in streams explosions can ruin concrete ruin drywall and ruin other building materials now we we mentioned earlier that iron pyrite is a very common substance oh I'm sorry that's the I don't think we're on that slide yet it is the most common of the sulfide minerals which are about 25 different minerals now almost everything pyrite isn't gold is in contrast real gold is valued for several characteristics this metal has we'll start out with malleability and ductility this allows metal atoms to slide past one another without being subjected to strong repulsive forces that would cause other materials to shatter to be plane this allows gold to be hammered to a very thin layer called gold leaf I have a nice little picture here on this and if you look on this screen this tiny piece of gold at the bottom of this picture is five millimeters that's about something on this order if I'm right I'm not up on my metric system entirely but very small piece of gold and that can be hammered or worked to a sheet of about half a meter which is approximately this big and then to put it in our American measurements an ounce can be worked into three hundred square feet which is about 30 by 10 feet maybe the length of this room and this big so one little ounce of gold can be hammered into that big of a sheet now you think about you know you look at these where they call it the Dome of the rock I think it's over in the east Istanbul or Israel or somewhere over there I didn't have that in my notes but you look at the Dome of the rock that great big huge dome covered with gold you look at the state capitals federal buildings things like that I know Wisconsin where I'm originally from State Capitol had some gold up there you know and and the way they put all that gold it's very heavy and it's very expensive the way they cover things like that with gold they it's not solid gold you're looking at but they hammer out this gold leaf and then they cover it over with gold leaf very common I believe even the Ark of the Covenant was instructed it was built of wood and then it was covered overlaid with gold which would have been gold leaf so that workability I'm gonna use the word workability they say malleability ductility we're gonna use the word workability here of gold makes it very valuable it's the most workable of all substances ok gold is also one of the least reactive chemical elements chemical elements is basically the stuff that makes up the earth you know you got iron you got copper help me out somebody here aluminum thank you so much beautiful I keep thinking of things that are put together you know but it's got to be it can't be things put together there's gotta be basic things carbon I think my chemistry days are 27 years ago or something you know but those things they come in useful every now and then children you know so keep up with your studies there you know but anyway the basic things that make up gold is one of the least reactive now we learned how reactive pyrite was setting off explosions and Hassen mine runoff and everything this low reactivity of gold makes it resistant to corrosion corrosion oxidate oxidation rusting as we would call it that's when a metal breaks down and weakens the most common form is rust gold will maintain its form a buried treasure chest of gold will not rust and it could even be at the bottom of the ocean for 500 years and they're out there diving for it because they know it hasn't changed in all that salt water this here I will talk about this slide in a minute real gold is rare whereas pyrite is the most common among the sulfide minerals and it's these properties that give gold its value now if you lay up treasure in other items like Jesus spoke about when he was speaking about laying up treasure such as cotton clothes a lot of clothings made of cotton blankets whatever would be wool food wood iron all of these items are subject to decay and they must be kept free from bugs air humidity and any other influence that may ruin their value also there will be a constant cost to maintain the value of them you know heating your house or humidifying your house or dehumidifier your house you know how many have ever had a moth get into their clothing yeah all of us have had it happen how many have ever had mold your clothing or your shoes mold we've been through it you know several of us yeah now military machinery is mostly made of these cheaper metals like iron which are subject to corrosion and to slow this corrosion process and protect their equipment the military has begun shrink-wrapping their equipment see if they made it of gold they wouldn't have to worry about it they probably couldn't get it off the ground if there's a helicopter it'd be too heavy but gold will hold its value even in a harsh environment now here this brings us to our slide here a wise person will not put their treasure in a place where bugs and rust can destroy it I'm talking about natural wisdom if you're smart and you're wealthy you're not gonna save up all kinds of clothing for one thing be out of fashion in 20 or 30 years and you just throw it all away or give it all the way you know but they will lay their treasure in something that holds its value and this gold bar here that we're looking at I think we all saw it's valued it was valued at when I did this back in 2016 approximately nine million eight hundred thousand dollars that's about 551 pounds of gold largest gold bar in the world so quite quite valuable there I've got a transition here and then get a little code and handwritten and all this if you'll bear with me for a moment we're gonna get this figured out worldly life can be typed to fool's gold or pyrite the unsaved life we're going to start with the outward beauty of pyrite in the crystal form fool's gold appears outwardly more beautiful and often the world with its wealth power and influence and education and all the things the world holds dear and treasures seems more beautiful than the Christian way you know I mean who did who looks better Jesus walking up a hill carrying across bleeding defeated to the earthly I or Herod walking around with his great beautiful robes and crown and palaces and servants and everything you know just to the first glance the world looks better than the gospel the Bible even tells us that also fool's gold we learned is brittle hard and not easily molded we know that the ungodly or the unsaved resists the gospel they resist God changing them and they even resist salvation and repentance they don't want it they don't want to hear it it's the stone that was rolled out of the mountain and it breaks the things that are in its way it breaks the world also the instability of Fool's Gold which causes so much trouble and construction and mining in different areas can be compared to hatred malice envy strife anger loss of self-control impatience and the unbeliever often hurts others around them like gossip or contentions or name-calling anger produces a lot of them things too finally pyrite is very common and we know that Jesus told us the broad way is the way to destruction and there's many that are going that way now in the same way that this fool's gold is a wonderful type the real gold is a wonderful type of the believer and of the truth and of the Spirit of God we'll start in this case that it's not very common and Jesus also said little flock yours is the kingdom so just like real gold if it was real common it wouldn't be that valuable but it's not that common and at first glance the false may look better than the real we covered that ok real gold is very workable they call it malleability or ductility God can work with the Christian easily bent formed and shaped to his desires a Christian is not brittle or easily broken or offended Matthew 11 6 says Jesus speaking and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and john 6:66 through 69 says and from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him they were offended many of them then said jesus unto the twelve the few will ye also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the Son of the Living God now we know Jesus was speaking some hard things things they didn't understand the disciples were often confused and not sure of exactly what he was saying yet they knew there was something there they weren't gonna be broken off no matter how hard things got they were gonna stay with them it didn't break them it just bent them those hard things also real gold does not react easily with outside influences a scripture for us on that about not reacting easily is first Corinthians 13 for charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked or easily angered thinketh no evil hard to get a reaction out of real gold where the Branham said in perfect faith 1963 that's the way it is to all believers speaking of Jesus they're a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him they said why you talk in riddles and when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material amen so that condition where nothing can move you nothing can faze you it's like you're like gold you know nothing affects it hardly but it is very workable you know by the master workman gold is resistant to corrosion so Christian character gives one resistance to the corrupting influences of the world first John to 14 through 17 I've written unto you father's because you've known him that is from the beginning I've written unto you young men because you're strong and the Word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father's not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so the real Christian gold the spirit in your life gives you resistance to those corrupting influences it also gives you stability and value and that brings us back to our opening scripture which was Isaiah 33 6 and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the Lord is his treasure my brother Bram says here speaking of brother Neville increments in concern 62 I've known brother Neville for years in his lovely little life even before they were married and the years that I've known him he's never changed one bit only just went hiring God that's all but he's dependable we love him now is the pastor he's been in there for years and we hope he stays till Jesus comes if it be the will of the Lord now the properties of real gold make a good type of the real of Christian character but the true gold is not what most people know as gold elemental it's called au is the elemental symbol for gold the true gold is Christian character and in the church age Brook here in the Laodicean Church age he's saying come to me and buy it is evident from this phrase buy of me that the Laodicean Church is not at all dealing with Jesus for the spiritual products of the kingdom of God their transactions cannot be spiritual they may think that they are spiritual but how can they be the works in their midst are definitely not as Paul would say God in you willing and doing of his own good pleasure Philippians 2:13 thus what about all these churches schools hospitals missionary ventures etc God is not in them as long as their denominational seed and spirit and not the seed in Spirit of God buy of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich now these glare to see in church they thought they were rich because they had real gold true I mean they had elemental gold they had the gold that glittered like this wedding ring here this is gold probably the only gold I have to my name but I wouldn't mind having more but you know God hasn't ordained that way yet if he does you know he does so we're not worried about that we're we're more concerned about the true gold so now these people had plenty of gold remember the Laodicean church was rich and thought they had need of nothing but it was the wrong kind it was the gold that bought men's lives and destroyed them it was the gold that warped and twisted human character for its love was the root of all evil so we see that elemental gold as valuable as it is is wonderful of characteristics as it has and I think we'd all be happy to have a little more if we could you know yet it's love the love of wealth which gold is a great symbol of is the root of all evil the Bible tells us I would stick with the ESV translation which says the root of many evils but that's a whole different thought there but anyway you could check with that one yourself or check with your pastor but a lot of translations say the love of money is the root of many evils or all kinds of evils King James says all evil I kind of hold of many different evils because if all evil comes from the love of money then how do you explain murder where there's no money involved at all that was evil you know but I don't see you know if people don't have money and and yet one murders the other out of hate that's an evil how many you would agree with me there is murder and evil okay thank you so the love of money isn't the root of the evil of murder so anyway that's just for free wow it's coming against the King James no I'm just you know I want to understand what the Bible says and we'll get back to our thought here the love of money was the root of all evil as it says but the gold of God 1st Peter 1:7 the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of God is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that is the right kind of gold but what kind of gold does a church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it is rich it is complacent it is made affluence or having money we would say the major criterion of spirituality so in many churches if you have money then you're considered a godly person because God has blessed you because you have money you know that's a lot of churches you know that's the way a lot of churches teach and thank and act you know the evidence of God's blessing and the correctness of doctrine etc is now based upon how many rich folks are involved in it he's talking about the Laodicean church you know the great big churches and the great payers and things I one of our brothers at the church back home was telling me he remembers when he was a boy and he'd sit in the church and he'd watched this man he said every time the offering plate came around so this man his wife both had rings on almost every finger and this man would take his big fat wallet out and he'd reach in there and grab a big wad of money and throw it in the plate and he said as a boy he would just every time the offer he came he to watch him cuz he wanted to see how much is he throwing this time he said it was a show it was all about a show you know that I bet he'd pull that wallet right out and pull that water you know he wanted everybody to see what he was doing you know and that's many people you know look at religion that way but that that's not what but that's a wrong view you had better come before it is too late saith the Lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world butt-naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless Laodicean people it's up to each of us now moving down here only the gold tried in the fire shall endure so the real gold is Christian character amen so we look at you know the the great value of natural gold and how it's so much more valuable than clothing or cars or all these different things because it can hold its value but that great value that it has as it said here very briefly talked about it's ruined thousands and thousands and millions of people the conquistadors came over to the Western world and just plundered and murdered and attacked all because they wanted to get the gold that the Mayas and the Aztecs and the Incas had and take it all back to Spain or wherever they were from you know terrible terrible terrible things have been done over this really good substance of gold so the real gold isn't the real gold the real gold is Christian character it's the Holy Spirit that's the real valuable thing amen 1st Peter 3:1 as we're winding down here or a33 I'm sorry this speaking to the ladies whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting out of apparel but let it be the real gold I added that part the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible well you can't corrupt real gold but you can sure corrupt the use of it you know and do all kinds of Evil's with the real gold but this is not corruptible this is the hidden man of the heart even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price a man there's a real real deal there brothers and sisters unseen things are more real than the seen brother branham Tata sis 1956 God's covenant with Abraham Christians don't look at things or I'm sorry Christians look at things they don't see and the things you don't see are more real than the things that you see you see that microphone it'll perish I see faith that'll never perish see I see love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience every shield of the believer is supernatural everything that belongs in the realm of christianity is worked by supernatural an atheist once said to me said anything that can't be scientifically proven isn't real I said anything that can be scientifically proven isn't real that's vice-versa he said there's something wrong with you I yeah I got saved that's what's wrong so it's the real things sometimes it's hard for us you know I think in another place the Prophet talked about the pulpit he said that you know this Spirit of God is more real than this pulpit here you know the Bible says heaven and earth will pass away everything in it but the Word of God shall stand forever it's hard for us as human beings you know to look around us every day we wake up we we walk out the door we stub our toe that felt pretty real to me and you you know cuz that stubbed toe shot up through your nerves and your oh my toe my toe you know and you know you you're hungry your stomach is growling that feels pretty real to you and if I don't get food I'm gonna die and it's true you know you have to have food to live and sustain your life here but yet there's things more real than those things which seem so real seem so important seem so pressing a minute that's why we're here this morning and that because we recognize as the the song says things that are higher things that are nobler these have eluard my sight amen a stand is worth winding down here brother come to the piano just look up a quick scripture used to having a Bible actually didn't bring it out with me but we have one here so Galatians 6:15 as we're closing for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature or a new creation this new creature of creation that Paul speaks of is really what matters as Weymouth New Testament States it neither circumcision nor uncircumcision which are natural things earthly things is of any importance but only a renewed nature the only thing of real lasting value comes from the new birth and by the sanctifying cleansing power of the Holy Spirit that brings us to the true gold which is Christian character with the fruits of the spirit flowing and living in us rather than the works of the flesh I
