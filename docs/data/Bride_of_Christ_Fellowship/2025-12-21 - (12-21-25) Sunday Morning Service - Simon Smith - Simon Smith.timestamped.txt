[0:01] If God had not moved on me,
[0:04] &gt;&gt; where would I be? Saints,
[0:08] &gt;&gt; right before I heard this message, I was
[0:09] in denomination and I went and committed
[0:11] a what was it? The what's the lowest
[0:13] degree uh fourth degree misdemeanor
[0:17] [laughter]
[0:17] when I was in when I was going to
[0:19] church? Fourth degree misdemeanor. Come
[0:21] up to the judge. The judge like and I
[0:23] was like guilty of charged. [laughter] I
[0:26] confessed everything to him and he's
[0:27] like you're on two years probation blah
[0:29] blah. I was like, "Thank you, sir." He
[0:30] goes, "I don't want to see you again in
[0:31] here." He goes, "You will never see me
[0:33] here again." [laughter]
[0:34] [gasps] Right? I I gave him my word and
[0:36] I held my word. He did not. In fact, I
[0:38] don't even remember his name. So, let's
[0:39] let We're going to go leave that
[0:41] bygones. Right. But still in
[0:43] denomination. Didn't know I was doing
[0:45] wrong. Get caught in the wrong crowds.
[0:47] Still hang out in the wrong crowds and
[0:49] uh doing bad things, right? Still in
[0:52] denomination. My goodness. And if I was
[0:54] doing that in the denominational
[0:56] rankings, what if I would have stayed
[0:58] there?
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Because what? This thing's out of
[1:01] control.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; This thing's out of control. Look at all
[1:04] the look at all the pastors in the
[1:06] world, you know, that have been uh that
[1:07] have fallen in the last five years,
[1:10] &gt;&gt; 20 years, one year, right? So,
[1:14] uh and by the grace of God, he gave us
[1:17] the answer and that is receive the
[1:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he is the
[1:21] keeper.
[1:23] We can't keep ourselves,
[1:25] &gt;&gt; but he can keep us. Amen. So, I don't
[1:28] want to I'm not going to sing anymore.
[1:30] Thank you for musicians for all you do.
[1:34] And uh
[1:36] Toby there playing that bangy thing. And
[1:39] um we had one of those too at our home
[1:40] assembly and I think the young ones
[1:42] really like that thing. Was it called a
[1:44] cone or a stone? Cone.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Coahone.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Coahone. Okay. It was something I I
[1:49] could never remember it, but uh yeah.
[1:51] Yeah, they're absolutely gifts and
[1:53] callings. Absolutely gifted. Amen.
[1:55] Praise the Lord. Like I I like sometimes
[1:57] when they're clapping, I can't even keep
[1:58] a beat. But it takes a ability to keep a
[2:00] beat to play that thing, right?
[2:01] Sometimes I'll get on the wrong thing
[2:03] and I'm like, "Oh, God have mercy." You
[2:04] know, I don't know if Brother Jess ever
[2:05] heard our dad sing, but he ain't got it.
[2:09] [laughter]
[2:11] I don't think you can hit a tune or even
[2:13] a note. You know, I've heard it and I'm
[2:15] like, "Yeah, Dad. Yep. Stick stick with
[2:17] carpentry." Yes. And the skills skilled
[2:19] trades and what those sort of things. So
[2:22] uh but by God's grace um I had many
[2:26] sermons I was I was thinking all on this
[2:27] and this and brother Jess when he prayed
[2:29] kind of gave me like a direction there
[2:32] and uh we chose uh this by God's grace.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[2:36] &gt;&gt; So if we could let's uh I want to give
[2:37] you greetings from Living Waters or yeah
[2:39] living Living Waters Tabernacle in the
[2:40] Point Ohio uh Pastor Cam and the saints
[2:43] there and uh once again we uh are
[2:48] thankful for the invitation and we trust
[2:50] this will be a blessing uh to you. might
[2:52] be simple
[2:54] um but if we could just really catch
[2:57] this and if we could express this the
[3:00] expression of this will change I believe
[3:03] everything right so let's uh stand for
[3:06] the reading of the word by God's grace
[3:08] and we'll start to Genesis
[3:10] 3 uh 1-7
[3:14] then we'll [clears throat] jump to
[3:15] Proverbs 24:16
[3:20] Genesis 3 and we'll read 1 through uh
[3:24] seven.
[3:28] And we've, you know, I've heard many
[3:30] services and sermons on this topic, and
[3:34] I'm sure your pastor, brother Jesse, has
[3:36] been teaching on these things as well.
[3:38] But we trust this will be a blessing.
[3:42] uh in Genesis 3:1
[3:45] through7. Now the serpent was more subd
[3:48] than any beast of the field which the
[3:49] Lord God had made. And he said unto the
[3:52] woman, "Ya hath God said, Ye shall not
[3:56] eat of every tree
[3:58] uh of the garden." And the woman said
[4:00] unto the serpent, we may eat of the
[4:02] fruit of the trees of the garden, but
[4:04] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[4:06] midst of the garden, God has said, Ye
[4:07] shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
[4:09] touch it, touch it, lest ye die. And the
[4:12] servant said to the woman, "Ye shall not
[4:15] ye shall not surely die. For the Lord
[4:18] doth know that in the day ye eat
[4:20] thereof, then your eyes should be open,
[4:22] and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
[4:25] and evil." And when the woman saw that
[4:28] the tree was good for food, and that it
[4:30] was pleasant to the eyes, a tree to be
[4:32] desired to make one wise, she took of
[4:34] the fruit thereof and did eat. So notice
[4:37] who committed the first uh sin right
[4:40] there, right? Was it Adam or was it Eve?
[4:43] Right?
[4:46] And she gave also unto her husband with
[4:48] her, and he did eat. and the eyes of
[4:50] both them were naked were open and they
[4:53] knew that they were naked and they sued
[4:55] sewed fig uh leaves together and made
[4:58] themselves aprons. So let's turn to
[5:01] Proverbs 24.
[5:08] We trust you've all had a wonderful week
[5:10] and the Lord
[5:12] um he's mindful getting us through these
[5:16] cold cold weeks here the cold weather
[5:18] and um Proverbs 24 verse 16
[5:24] for a just man fallth seven times and
[5:26] rises up again but the wicked shall fall
[5:29] into mischief. Let's say a word of
[5:31] prayer. Let's bow our heads.
[5:34] Dear Lord Jesus, we love you Lord. We
[5:36] thank you for this day. We thank you for
[5:37] your grace and mercy, Lord. We thank you
[5:39] for all that you've done, Lord God, and
[5:41] in our lives, God. How you've kept us,
[5:43] Lord. Lord, [clears throat] you've shown
[5:44] yourself mighty, God. Lord, you've
[5:46] helped us through this week, God. You
[5:48] helped us, Lord, up to this time, Lord.
[5:50] You've been you have kept your watchful
[5:52] eye upon us, Lord, every day of our
[5:54] lives, Lord Jesus. Lord, and we believe,
[5:56] Lord, it's not for uh uh because of
[5:58] anything we've done, but Lord, for what
[6:00] you've done on Calvary, Lord Jesus.
[6:01] Lord, we just ask God, you be with Lord,
[6:03] these saints, God, Lord, and Lord Jesus,
[6:05] help me to get beside myself, Lord, and
[6:07] let you speak, Lord. Lord, this message
[6:09] be so simple, Lord God. But Lord, we
[6:10] believe it's timely, God. And Lord, I
[6:13] believe the bride uh needs to catch
[6:15] this, Lord Jesus. Lord, we love you.
[6:17] Bless the people, God. Strengthen them,
[6:19] Lord. Strengthen this church, Lord, this
[6:20] assembly, Lord. Strengthen the pastor,
[6:22] Lord. strengthen the pastor's wife,
[6:24] Lord, the children, Lord, and a lot of
[6:26] times uh Lord, we I've watched in
[6:31] in this time I've been in this message,
[6:32] Lord, how the pastor's children are
[6:34] under attack, the pastor's wife is under
[6:36] attack, God, literally trying to hinder
[6:38] and stop the work, Lord, that you have,
[6:40] Lord, using your man of God there, Lord
[6:42] Jesus. Lord, and Lord, not only in that,
[6:44] but Lord, we see in every person's life,
[6:46] Lord, how the devil attacks, Lord, all
[6:48] the time, Lord, Lord Jesus, we love you.
[6:50] bless the people, strengthen them in the
[6:52] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[6:54] seated.
[6:56] So saints, we uh um
[7:00] looking forward to uh coming months. We
[7:04] actually had a visitor about um three
[7:07] weeks ago, maybe four weeks ago, we had
[7:09] a visitor uh um I believe it was on one
[7:13] of the trips to Thailand. Uh brother Ron
[7:16] had uh contacted a a brother there. He
[7:18] he became our interpreter for about two
[7:20] weeks and uh in October he said, "Hey,
[7:24] brother Simon, I'm coming to see you." I
[7:25] was like, "Okay." And um he said, "I'll
[7:29] come and see you in December."
[7:32] Well, was the very week before almost
[7:35] like the weekend before Thanksgiving.
[7:36] And he said, "Hey, I'm here." And I'm
[7:38] like, "Okay, I'm coming to see you now.
[7:40] Is that okay?" I was like, "Yeah, I
[7:42] guess it is. It is now. Absolutely." So,
[7:45] so in all these things, he was uh very
[7:47] very excited to uh see America as his
[7:50] third time, but he's never seen snow.
[7:52] And he got to see snow.
[7:54] And the first couple days, saints, he
[7:56] was rejoicing. He was he was he was
[7:59] grabbing his hand. He's throwing in the
[8:00] air. He's doing selfies with snow and
[8:02] the snow on the trees, the snow on the
[8:04] ground, and the snow on everything. He
[8:06] was But then after about a couple days,
[8:07] he's like, "Man, it's really cold." I
[8:09] was like, "Yeah, that's that's the
[8:11] revelation of it." to to the eye this
[8:14] the pure white undefiled snow looks
[8:17] beautiful but there comes something with
[8:19] that for water to get in that state
[8:22] saying it's got to get cold right
[8:24] [laughter]
[8:24] obviously he's never worked a day
[8:26] outside in uh eight hours in the
[8:28] freezing cold so he doesn't understand
[8:30] but he caught a little mini revelation
[8:31] there and he's like hey brother can we
[8:32] go in the house I was like yeah let's go
[8:35] uh so we know that uh the prophet and of
[8:38] course we know God in in nature he types
[8:41] uh the winter time is death and how even
[8:43] in death things become be beautiful,
[8:45] right? But it's cold becomes cold,
[8:47] right? So, uh
[8:50] uh we uh were happy to uh have him along
[8:54] for us for about a week and we actually
[8:55] took him to Iowa to see brother Brooks
[8:57] and we had a little service there and it
[8:58] was good time. So, so [clears throat]
[9:01] this morning saints, I'd like to uh
[9:04] teach on this
[9:06] [clears throat] topic
[9:08] uh a sinless bride.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:12] And uh I believe brother Jesse even
[9:13] meant hit on this. I I been trying to
[9:15] keep up with his videos. He makes so
[9:17] many videos I can't even keep up.
[9:18] [laughter] That's sad for me. Uh but uh
[9:21] he's done a tremendous job and I see I
[9:24] like what he says. He I'm defending this
[9:26] message. I'm defi defending Jesus Christ
[9:28] and his prophet. Right. And what a
[9:31] gallant stand that is. Um
[9:34] so in this topic saints uh the sinless
[9:36] bride uh this is a most uh paradoxical
[9:41] or maybe a very a thought that uh
[9:44] doesn't make sense whatsoever
[9:47] a sinless bride. Um
[9:51] but in this saints of God there is a
[9:53] there there there's a truth more real to
[9:55] this than there is anything else. Right?
[9:59] So, we've got to have our minds set on
[10:02] these things. And uh we trust this. I
[10:05] may have even mentioned many of these
[10:06] things before, but I want to start with
[10:07] this. Oh, we have it up also. So, in
[10:10] this this study, I'd like to start with
[10:12] this quote here uh right off the bat
[10:15] because remember this saints, this quote
[10:17] right here, saints of God, is the true
[10:18] bride, right? This is the bride. This is
[10:21] like a Joel to army. This is the this is
[10:23] the this is the people that goes in the
[10:25] rapture. Okay?
[10:27] If you can fulfill this quote right now,
[10:30] there's obviously many scriptures in 1
[10:31] Thessalonians 4 uh verse 15, uh 1
[10:34] Corinthians 15 dealing with the rapture
[10:36] mystery, right? But notice in order to
[10:39] be the bride that goes into that will
[10:42] not see death.
[10:45] Now this she will have to have these
[10:48] things. Okay? You know, in the time when
[10:51] uh uh Eleazar was sent to grab a wife
[10:53] for Isaac and as soon as she came, he he
[10:56] came, he said a prayer,
[10:59] he said a prayer. He said, "Lord God,
[11:00] the one that waters me and my camels,"
[11:02] he said, "Well, be that's the girl,
[11:04] right?" You know, the prophet said, "The
[11:05] angel of the Lord was leading Rebecca in
[11:08] that time." So, literally, he she he
[11:11] didn't know God was working on the other
[11:13] end and neither and Eleazar had to have
[11:16] faith that God was going to answer his
[11:18] prayer, right? But in order when now
[11:20] when she did those things, what took
[11:22] place? He instantly as soon as I Elizer
[11:24] and and his prayer was answered, he
[11:27] adorned her with these things, right?
[11:29] She had to put on the the the ornaments
[11:31] and those gifts and everything, right?
[11:33] We know brother Ram said those are gifts
[11:34] of the spirit, right? But uh in our type
[11:37] as well, we have to have those spiritual
[11:38] gifts going, but you also want to catch
[11:40] these things. He actually pinpoints what
[11:43] we need to be what this invincible army,
[11:46] right?
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now remember this,
[11:49] Christ in the true church." So, we're
[11:50] dealing with the true church. How many
[11:53] here believes they're in the true
[11:54] church? Absolutely. You better believe
[11:57] you are the true church. Amen. Why?
[11:59] Because belief will bring these things.
[12:01] If you have faith that you are that,
[12:04] what can stop it?
[12:06] &gt;&gt; What can stop faith? There is nothing.
[12:09] See, God, saints of God, God honors
[12:11] faith in serpent seed. When they went to
[12:12] the Beatles concerts, right, and were
[12:14] healed, faith did that. The Beatles
[12:16] didn't do that. They didn't do that, but
[12:18] faith in them did that. So if you can
[12:20] believe that you are the true church,
[12:22] nothing can stop you.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; It becomes invincibility. Right? He
[12:28] says, now notice, he says, the true
[12:29] church in the continuation of the book
[12:31] of acts, the book of re revelation shows
[12:33] how the antichrist spirit would come
[12:34] into the church, defile it, making it
[12:36] lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It
[12:38] exposes Satan, revealing his works,
[12:41] attempt the destruction of the people,
[12:42] God's people, and the discrediting of
[12:44] God's word. He says right down to the
[12:46] time he is cast lake of fire. He fights
[12:48] it at he cannot he can't stand it. He
[12:50] knows that the people get the true
[12:52] revelation of the true church. So notice
[12:54] from here from this point if the true
[12:56] church get the true revelation.
[12:59] You need this revelation. I need this
[13:01] revelation. And he says and what she is
[13:06] &gt;&gt; what she is. If you can catch this
[13:08] revelation of what you are,
[13:11] it'll start this process, right?
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Because I I believe if the wife of the
[13:16] bride of Christ can catch this
[13:18] revelation, she will move and start
[13:20] acting like this.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; She will start moving in such a way, she
[13:25] will conduct herself in such a way as
[13:28] David was with s with with Saul, he
[13:30] behaved himself wisely. He and and then
[13:33] as we saw as the time moved on, he says
[13:35] he behaved himself even more wisely. And
[13:38] at that time when he became more wise,
[13:40] that's when Saul saw David. He said and
[13:42] then he started to fear David.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; See, so we've got to walk in this way.
[13:48] Now notice what she is and what she
[13:50] stands for and she can do the greater
[13:51] works. She will be an invincible army.
[13:54] So we have to have we have to know the
[13:55] revelation of true church and what she
[13:57] is to be able to move on to these
[13:58] greater things. Right?
[14:00] But first of all, you have to have this
[14:02] revelation of who you are. Now, in this
[14:04] moving these things and I and I like
[14:06] this here it says he says and she will
[14:08] be an invincible army.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; What is invincibility?
[14:13] You can't lose.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; You are as the prophet of God says or
[14:18] actually the scripture says he says you
[14:20] are more than an overcomer.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; What [cough and clears throat] is more
[14:24] than an overcomer? It is Jesus Christ
[14:26] who over overcame for you and then
[14:28] likens it and gives gives it to you. He
[14:32] says no. He no you're the overcomer. I
[14:34] overcame so you could be the overcomer.
[14:37] That is more than overcomer. Do you
[14:39] believe that? Do you believe Jesus did
[14:41] these things? Do you know who you are
[14:43] right
[14:44] &gt;&gt; now? Notice sure that's really easy to
[14:46] say. That's really simple to bring these
[14:48] things. Right. Sure. Um but now we're
[14:50] going to get into some of these things
[14:51] here as we continue. Now notice, for a
[14:54] just man fallth seven times.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Has anyone fallen last week, Monday
[15:01] through Saturday? Has anyone fallen like
[15:04] in their minds?
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Hey, two hands for me. Has anyone fallen
[15:08] even in the flesh and kind of kicked
[15:10] back on this and kicked back on that and
[15:12] had a bad attitude? Mothers, have you
[15:14] gotten frustrated with your children at
[15:15] all? Sister Christian's like, "Of course
[15:17] I haven't." Yes. No. She's like, "Yes,
[15:19] yes, absolutely." Right. Fathers,
[15:21] brothers, have you have have you gotten
[15:22] frustrated with anything at home and
[15:24] just had a negative attitude?
[15:27] &gt;&gt; When you go into negativity, you've
[15:29] fallen. You actually fallen from grace.
[15:32] You've actually fallen now in your mind,
[15:33] in your in your in your spirit realm
[15:35] mind because the prophet said the Holy
[15:36] Ghost is always positive. Amen. Praise
[15:39] be to God. See, so it shows it's so
[15:41] difficult to live in the presence in the
[15:43] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. Oh my. I
[15:46] remember a quote back in the early 50s.
[15:47] Brother said, he says, "I'm trying the
[15:49] striving. of trying to find how to keep
[15:51] that presence there always with me.
[15:54] Amen. Actually, what dwelling with God
[15:57] and able to feel him, saints of God,
[15:59] it's one thing where we're living when
[16:01] we can't feel the presence of God and
[16:02] yet he's there. And it's a whole
[16:04] different thing when the Holy Ghost when
[16:06] you can feel his presence. Amen. Saints
[16:08] of God, it's just like this. If I'm to
[16:10] hang out with this brother right here
[16:11] and and and he would go with me to work
[16:12] and he would live and he he would
[16:13] literally be the guy recording my life.
[16:16] If if he was there and I take him to
[16:17] work, he'd ride in my pastor's seat. I
[16:19] drive him around and you have to watch
[16:20] me work these he and he would start
[16:22] recording. I would act a lot more
[16:24] different knowing he's watching my every
[16:26] step
[16:28] &gt;&gt; knowing he's watching my and if I could
[16:29] tell him. I said and the brother's like,
[16:31] "Brother Simon, whatever you're
[16:32] thinking, you got to say it out loud.
[16:33] God have mercy." [laughter]
[16:35] He goes, "Why? Because I got to record
[16:37] it. Even my very thoughts." Yes,
[16:39] brother. Even my very thoughts. Right.
[16:40] So, saints of God, it'd be a lot easier
[16:42] to live. I'll say it like this. I'd be
[16:44] able to keep myself in check a lot
[16:46] easier if this brother was literally
[16:48] hounding me all day long. But saints of
[16:50] God, you've got to come to realization
[16:52] that God is still doing that right now.
[16:54] The prophet said he is not our actions,
[16:56] he's not our words, he says, but our
[16:57] thoughts and will speak louder in heaven
[16:59] on that day. Right.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; So, saints of God, we fall constantly.
[17:05] Right. Sure. Absolutely. Saints of God,
[17:06] we have mind battles. And I'll say it
[17:08] like this. We know that crow, that devil
[17:10] comes, that raven, whatever you call
[17:12] him, that serpent, that devil, that
[17:13] dragon comes and tries to put bad and
[17:16] negative thoughts in our mind constantly
[17:18] and what and try to attach into our
[17:20] heart and bring forth what a root of
[17:21] bitterness, a a rooe of jealousy, a root
[17:24] of this or that, saints of God, we've
[17:25] got to overcome them things. As soon as
[17:28] we as soon as we hear something that's
[17:30] contrary to the scripture, cast it out.
[17:33] Amen. Because if he's the word and
[17:35] you're the word, what should we be
[17:37] feasting on? What should we be thinking
[17:39] on? What the word of God? Now notice
[17:42] &gt;&gt; uh let's continue. So notice here he
[17:44] says he says and a just man fallth seven
[17:46] times. It doesn't say how many in in a
[17:48] day in an hour. He says and rises up
[17:52] again. It does not give a time period.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; So there's no time period required. You
[17:58] can literally fall seven times in a
[18:00] minute. [laughter]
[18:01] Bad thought. Bad thought. Bad thought.
[18:04] Bad thought. Bad thought. And bad
[18:06] thought. Amen. So, but what and what we
[18:08] get back up the next minute
[18:10] &gt;&gt; and you catch yourself and Lord forgive
[18:12] me and that last minute is totally
[18:15] erased.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is still on the mercy
[18:20] seat interceding for our sins. Amen.
[18:24] Now, let's continue on here. He says,
[18:26] "Now notice he says now the word now the
[18:29] word of God or the church dogmas is
[18:32] before you take you can uh is before
[18:34] you. You can take uh accept what the
[18:36] dogma of the church is or you can take
[18:37] what the word says. Remember in all ages
[18:40] has been as it is right now. There's
[18:42] always a popular belief among the people
[18:44] and it's always been just a little bit
[18:45] contrary to the real word.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; So notice remember in all ages it has
[18:55] been as it right now every age battled
[18:58] the exact same thing.
[19:02] It's like this. In the time of Smyrna
[19:03] and Pergamis when there was very little
[19:05] word in a time of dark Asia, saints of
[19:07] God, what little word they had, they
[19:10] were taught in Latin. They were taught
[19:12] that the Catholic Church is this and the
[19:14] and this and that and all these false
[19:15] doctrines, right? But little what little
[19:17] word they had, there was always
[19:18] something that was so close to the truth
[19:21] as to deceive it, right? But the elect
[19:24] always overcame, right? Why? Because
[19:26] they were the elect. Not because they
[19:29] live so perfect. because they were the
[19:31] elect. Amen.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Now, let's continue on here. For there
[19:35] is not a just man upon the earth that
[19:37] doeth good and sinnth not.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Not one just man.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; There is no one we can lift up and say,
[19:45] "Oh my, look at this. Look at this man
[19:46] here. Look at this brother here. Look,
[19:48] look how clean that sister lives."
[19:49] Saints of God, there's not a just one.
[19:51] That's why saints of God we uh I just I
[19:54] I actually got in contact with a
[19:58] with a missionary from a I actually went
[20:00] to a funeral and the over the during the
[20:02] funeral thing. I heard about this
[20:03] missionary over in Africa and he seems
[20:07] like a very very legit uh brother. I
[20:09] contacted him and found out he's a real
[20:10] real man of God and and we were just
[20:13] speaking back and forth and and he said
[20:16] he said brother he goes gives me these
[20:18] visions. He says, he says, and a lot of
[20:20] times he said in these big big meetings
[20:23] they have, he said, he says, he says, a
[20:24] lot of these people go and are actually
[20:26] worshiping the minister. He says he sees
[20:28] it in the spirit realm. He says come up
[20:30] out, he actually says he comes up out of
[20:31] his flesh and he goes into the spirit
[20:33] realm and he says he these people are
[20:35] worshiping the gift or the minister and
[20:37] not Christ.
[20:40] And I'm like, wow, that's exactly right.
[20:44] Now, let's continue on. So notice he
[20:46] says, "For there is not a just man on
[20:47] earth that doeth good." He says, "And
[20:49] sinnth not." Right? We can all equally
[20:52] agree on these things. Absolutely. As in
[20:54] the time of Jesus and that that woman
[20:56] caught in adultery, he says, "He that
[20:57] hath no sin, let him cast the first
[20:58] stone." Right? [laughter] Anyone got any
[21:00] stones? Nope. Neither. Go and sin no
[21:02] more. Right? So notice in the time of
[21:04] temptation, he says in time of
[21:06] temptation, notice we got two things
[21:08] literally working in the majority is
[21:10] deception and then of course iniquity.
[21:12] Right? And iniquity is what? knowing
[21:15] what to do, knowing what's right to do,
[21:17] but then not doing it right.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Now, the dangerous I they're all they're
[21:22] both dangerous,
[21:24] but this one that's something else,
[21:27] right? You actually the people who in
[21:30] caught in deception, they believe
[21:33] they're trying their best to do what's
[21:35] right for God. Yeah,
[21:37] &gt;&gt; but the but deception comes through a
[21:40] trick, a snare,
[21:42] &gt;&gt; something that that that is set in
[21:44] place, pre-meditated,
[21:46] [laughter]
[21:47] a trap of the devil that he set for you,
[21:50] right? But we've got to be mindful of
[21:52] these things. A real man, a real
[21:53] wilderness man will be able to see. A
[21:56] real tracker, a man that that's been in
[21:57] the and can track an animal. They'll
[21:59] they'll look for little h drops of blood
[22:02] here or little broken branch at a
[22:04] certain height or a little way
[22:06] indentation in the leaves a certain kind
[22:08] of way. Why? Because he's trained
[22:10] himself in this art of tracking. And
[22:12] I'll tell you this in in in the days I
[22:14] actually met a brother a couple brothers
[22:16] there that were in Vietnam. He says he
[22:18] says when you were in Vietnam he says
[22:19] you had to be I you had to be identify
[22:22] how the Vietkong would set their traps
[22:24] in the jungles
[22:27] and in fact he says he a lot of times if
[22:29] they got a little whiff of a what looked
[22:30] something is a little fishy in this out
[22:32] in the jungle saints out in the trees in
[22:35] the high grass he said if there's a
[22:37] little funny feeling he said he would go
[22:38] three or four miles out of the way to
[22:40] avoid that you know what took place I'll
[22:43] just tell you the story he said there
[22:45] was a captain he was a brand new captain
[22:47] captain. He was sent a man who's never
[22:48] even been in Vietnam. And he was sent he
[22:50] was in charge of they sent him in charge
[22:51] of like 20 or maybe it's 100 people and
[22:53] and this brother I was talking to was
[22:55] one of them. And they came up to a
[22:57] certain spot. They're going into the
[22:58] lower spot. It was actually a quick way
[23:00] to pass over to the next mountain or
[23:02] however. And and and the guy that's been
[23:04] there that I talked to, he's been there
[23:05] for months and I think almost a year.
[23:06] And he said he says, "Cap," he says,
[23:08] "there's something wrong right here." He
[23:09] said, "We need to go around this." And
[23:10] he he goes, "I'll make that call." when
[23:13] he disagreed that that the guy he said
[23:15] he goes I'll tell you what I'm going to
[23:16] go I'm going to take the long way over
[23:18] the mountain over here and you go this
[23:20] way he said brother Simon he said he
[23:23] said within half an hour he sort of
[23:25] heard an explosion
[23:28] and they went back down that mountain
[23:29] and sure enough they had almost all died
[23:32] there was a trap set but that young
[23:34] arrogant captain refused to listen to a
[23:37] trained veteran who was able to identify
[23:39] the traps of the Viet Vietnam
[23:43] I'm not justifying. We know that being
[23:45] our war was a joke, right? The poor poor
[23:47] boys that went over there died, right?
[23:48] Now,
[23:49] &gt;&gt; now notice here, he says, now notice
[23:51] here in in James 1:12, he says, uh,
[23:55] "Blessed is the man that endureth
[23:56] temptation."
[24:00] &gt;&gt; You know, the devil's a the devil's been
[24:02] watching the humanity for 6,000 years.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; You know what the devil does? Here's
[24:09] Malachi working this and this and he'll
[24:11] bring something along maybe he's never
[24:13] seen before a little flashy
[24:16] and he's watching he's working this this
[24:20] does his eyes go like this or not
[24:24] and if he sees that his eyes just
[24:26] followed it for a brief second guess
[24:28] what he's going to wait a little bit and
[24:30] he's going to bring it around again and
[24:31] if his eyes if he his eyes catch it
[24:33] again and he turns he's going to see an
[24:36] open door he's going to see one of the
[24:38] weaknesses in his life and I'm not like
[24:40] hey right we're just this is example
[24:43] right now notice and that's the same way
[24:45] the devil is he knows exactly I'll say
[24:47] this he'll put thoughts in your mind in
[24:50] the spirit realm can you see your
[24:52] thoughts I can't see my thoughts he'll
[24:54] put those thoughts in your mind and
[24:57] he'll watch what how you react
[25:00] &gt;&gt; sir yes sir
[25:02] &gt;&gt; amen
[25:02] &gt;&gt; he'll put an as and I'm just say I'll
[25:05] use myself he'll put a negative thought
[25:06] against a person And he'll watch if I
[25:09] say God have mercy
[25:12] or that brother that that sister
[25:15] &gt;&gt; if I start saying something or he'll
[25:18] watch my countenance. Saints of God
[25:19] we're dealing with a mastermind. The
[25:21] brother said he says you are no match
[25:23] for the devil except except without the
[25:24] holy except with the Holy Ghost.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; He's watching. He'll put this thought
[25:28] about someone or something or a certain
[25:30] situation and he'll watch your
[25:32] expression.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:35] He'll watch if you start getting sad.
[25:38] He'll send this thought into your mind
[25:40] and he'll say you're working. Do you
[25:42] start slowing down
[25:44] &gt;&gt; in your work? Do you forget what you're
[25:46] doing?
[25:47] &gt;&gt; And then he know he saints of God. This
[25:49] is how this works.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Right up here. Temptation right starts
[25:56] right here. Oh, yeah. Right here.
[25:59] Blessed is the man that endureth
[26:00] temptation. For when he tried, he shall
[26:03] receive the crown of life, which the
[26:05] Lord had promised to them that love him.
[26:07] Let no man say, when I when he is
[26:10] tempted, I am tempted of God. For God
[26:11] cannot be tempted with evil. Either
[26:14] tempteth he any man. But every man is
[26:16] tempted when he's drawn away with his
[26:18] own lust and entire. See, someone says
[26:19] to God, it's exactly what took place
[26:21] with serpent and Eve, right?
[26:25] &gt;&gt; This is real.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; We're deal. We don't wrestle against
[26:28] flesh and blood,
[26:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[26:31] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't get upset with your
[26:32] brother and sister.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, I don't care what takes
[26:35] place, you can't get upset with them.
[26:36] Why? Because it's it's not them.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; If they and I was like this,
[26:43] even if they have the Holy Ghost and you
[26:45] have a problem, both of you filled with
[26:46] the Holy Ghost and you have a problem,
[26:49] it's either your flesh, a devil
[26:51] anointing you, or it's their flesh, or a
[26:53] devil anointing them.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; It's one of those four things. or
[26:57] multiple
[26:58] &gt;&gt; maybe two Holy Ghost filled brothers,
[27:00] two Holy Ghost filled sisters having a
[27:02] disagreement. Maybe [snorts] you both
[27:04] got issues. [laughter]
[27:08] &gt;&gt; A lot of times it's not one-sided.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it is.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; I just watched something happen two
[27:17] Tuesdays ago.
[27:20] Truly,
[27:22] I can only compare to what Brother Jesse
[27:24] said when he was in Ghana. Was it Guyana
[27:26] or Ghana?
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Guyana.
[27:29] That devil possessed woman came up and
[27:31] he started cast a demon. She started
[27:33] biting his hand whatever and he cast it
[27:34] out in the name of Jesus Christ to this
[27:36] and she fell dead at she she fell back
[27:38] dead is as slain right as one slain
[27:40] right. What Jesse brother Jesse say? He
[27:42] says he says textbook Bible.
[27:45] We had prayer meeting on two Tuesdays
[27:47] and nights and there's a certain
[27:48] situation going on.
[27:52] Pastor Cam comes out. Usually he picks a
[27:54] prayer scripture. Usually when you come
[27:56] to prayer meeting, you want to bring a
[27:58] scripture to sew into the people and how
[27:59] important prayer is and how prayer. He
[28:01] comes out with Job 1. Starts reading Job
[28:04] 1.
[28:06] And by the end of that prayer meeting,
[28:10] three things took place exactly textbook
[28:13] Bible. I was so blown away.
[28:17] God is God. His word is completely
[28:22] right.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Everything he wrote in there will not
[28:26] come back void. [laughter]
[28:27] It must take place. Amen. Now notice,
[28:31] but there is no temptation taken you.
[28:33] But what what but such is common to man.
[28:39] This brother right here,
[28:42] brother Sai, you have no idea what I'm
[28:43] going through.
[28:46] That might be true,
[28:48] but somebody's been through it.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; If there is an overcomer in the days of
[28:53] David and there if there was an
[28:54] overcomer in the time of Noah, if there
[28:56] was an overcomer in in in Philadelphia,
[28:59] there has to be an overcomer in
[29:01] Leodysia.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; This remember every battle you're demon
[29:05] you're battling, every demon, every
[29:06] thought, this and this, whatever you're
[29:08] battling, saints of God, many others are
[29:10] battling the exact same thing.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; It's all common. You know what I I have
[29:16] sometimes I have brothers call me and
[29:17] say, "Brother Simon, I know I'm not
[29:19] trying to bring you down. I know, but
[29:20] this is what I'm battling." I'm like,
[29:21] "Bro, welcome to the club."
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I have those exact same
[29:25] battles. You do? Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
[29:27] Probably more than you. Yeah. Right.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; It's all the same.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; We're all the same. I'll tell you this.
[29:35] If we could literally expose our
[29:37] thoughts right now, our mind battles
[29:39] right now, I bet they would all be
[29:41] almost the same thing.
[29:43] Am I going to make this rapture? Am I
[29:45] the bride? Did God really choose me? Am
[29:48] I a Judas? Am I foolish virgin? Saints
[29:51] of God. Those that's the main say saints
[29:53] of God in the denomination. They have no
[29:54] even idea what those things they don't
[29:56] even that's not even on their mind.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; But here in the message where too much
[30:01] given as much is required.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Now we've been given so much word. The
[30:06] devil can use so many things to try and
[30:10] persuade you to believe contrary to what
[30:13] God has called you to.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Yes, sir.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; There's no temptation taken. There has
[30:20] been no temptation taken you with such
[30:22] with such is common to man. But God is
[30:25] faithful. [laughter]
[30:28] Who's faithful? Did did the Holy Ghost
[30:30] anoint Paul said, "But you are
[30:32] faithful." in the book of Revelations 2
[30:35] and 3, then he's faithful and true and
[30:37] just. Is that you? No. That's Jesus
[30:39] Christ. Amen. There's one that's going
[30:42] to get you. Did anyone choose to be born
[30:44] here? No. God allowed you to be brought
[30:46] here and he placed his uh his seed
[30:49] within you. And because you have the
[30:51] seed of God, that's why you're here.
[30:53] Amen.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; And that's the only reason you're here.
[30:56] Read the church's book. Three, two or
[30:58] three quotes. He says he the only
[30:59] difference between us, he says us and
[31:01] them, he says, is the seed. That's
[31:03] right.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Now that seed, it's good to have that
[31:05] seed, but you have to have that seed
[31:07] quickened full of the Holy Spirit. The
[31:10] spirit, the Holy Ghost, God, and your
[31:12] seed must be come together and then
[31:14] start producing life, right?
[31:17] &gt;&gt; It's good to have a seed in you. You
[31:19] It's good you can hear this word. It's
[31:20] good you can know the mysteries, but we
[31:22] must be what? Born again. Amen. He says,
[31:24] "But God is faithful who will not suffer
[31:26] you to be tempted above that which you
[31:28] are able."
[31:30] &gt;&gt; What was that? Is this a promise of God?
[31:33] Oh, brother, I go I go through hard
[31:35] things. I I have many trials and
[31:37] temptations. You don't even know about
[31:38] it. But saints of God, if God allows
[31:40] Satan to tempt you, it's because you
[31:43] were built for it.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; You were built for it.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; You can overcome. There is nothing that
[31:51] you God has allowed to come upon you.
[31:54] You cannot conquer.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; There is nothing. Is this true or is
[31:58] this false? Do we come up here and rip
[32:00] this scripture out of the Bible? Nope.
[32:02] That's not true. No. But God is faithful
[32:04] who will not allow you to be tempted
[32:06] what you are able to be tempted with.
[32:08] Right,
[32:09] &gt;&gt; saints of God.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Well, why me? Because you can handle it.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Why me? Because you can handle it by the
[32:18] power of the Holy Ghost. You can handle
[32:20] it because God is faithful. But he will
[32:22] with some temptation also make a way to
[32:24] escape. There's always a way out.
[32:28] Hallelujah.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; There's a way out. A lot of times the
[32:33] way out is not exactly the way you want
[32:34] to go. [laughter]
[32:36] A lot of times to get through these
[32:38] things, you got to pray
[32:40] &gt;&gt; and labor, right, and call on God. A lot
[32:43] of times you have you might he might
[32:44] have you fast.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Well, that's kind of hard, brother, to
[32:48] go without food for three days, four
[32:51] days.
[32:53] You know what just took place?
[32:57] I just watched a brother literally fast
[33:00] from March
[33:03] up until a week ago
[33:06] for 30 days at a time.
[33:13] And the Holy Ghost came in brother upon
[33:16] brother Cam. He said, "Go and tell this
[33:19] brother."
[33:21] And that entire fast was for this final
[33:23] battle for a battle at the
[33:28] He goes, "Brother Cam, I didn't even
[33:29] know what I was doing."
[33:32] And then it came out and was revealed.
[33:38] God is faithful, but there's always a
[33:42] way out. Joseph caught in Piper's house.
[33:47] He was faithful. He's made sure
[33:48] everything is right. The temperature is
[33:49] set right. Oh, we got electricity here.
[33:51] We got electricity here. Everything this
[33:53] is set. Potter's house was perfect
[33:56] &gt;&gt; and then Potter's wife starting having
[33:59] eyes for him and finally she so caught
[34:01] up in the temptation that she was uh uh
[34:04] being caught up for what she went and
[34:05] tried to uh do certain things, right?
[34:08] But God made a way of escape for him.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; There was a door open. It didn't say
[34:15] that pastor's wife went to the house and
[34:17] locked all the doors.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; If she'd done that, things would have
[34:21] been different. But God allowed her for
[34:24] that to make to make her to make that
[34:26] mistake.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; And because and he resisted. He left his
[34:30] coat and cloak, however you want to say
[34:31] it, and he ran out the open door because
[34:33] there always has to be a way out.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] [snorts]
[34:40] &gt;&gt; But will the temptation But with the
[34:42] temptation also make a way to escape
[34:44] that you may be able to bear it. Amen.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; You can get through it. You think your
[34:49] life's hard? I challenge you. Go and
[34:53] listen to some on YouTube. If pastor
[34:55] allows us, that's okay. Go on YouTube
[34:58] and listen to some of the Holocaust
[34:59] survivors who were in the camps. How did
[35:01] they get through years starvation of
[35:04] starvation?
[35:07] That was unholy ghostfilled Jews.
[35:12] How did they do that?
[35:14] You are able to handle way more than
[35:18] what you think you can.
[35:21] You can handle
[35:23] as much as the Holy Ghost will allow
[35:26] you.
[35:31] I just taught a little bit on Wednesday
[35:33] there and I kind of started out like
[35:35] this because I had nothing to go on, no
[35:38] service, nothing to preach on. You know
[35:40] what I told the saints?
[35:44] You know, in the time of Daniel, the
[35:45] three Hebrew boys,
[35:49] there come a they had to make a choice,
[35:51] right? Bow down, right?
[35:53] Wouldn't it have been great if like a
[35:54] week or a month ahead of time, God
[35:57] dropped on Meshach, uh, Shadrach and
[35:59] Abedneo, if he would have dropped the
[36:00] visions on them?
[36:02] If God would have gave them, thus sayith
[36:04] the Lord, they would watch themselves,
[36:06] uh, have not bowed down to this image.
[36:08] They watched themselves stand like this.
[36:09] And the king challenged them. The king
[36:10] said and then they said, "King, we we've
[36:12] already made our choice." And they saw
[36:14] the vision where they go, they were cast
[36:16] into the the fiery furnace and then the
[36:18] they they didn't die. The fourth man of
[36:20] fire showed up. Wouldn't it have been
[36:22] nice if the three Hebrew boys would have
[36:23] had that vision and they would just
[36:25] acted out and said, "Yeah, king. We're
[36:27] good." There'd been no stress.
[36:29] Absolutely. Hey, I'll walk in myself.
[36:31] You don't have to bind me anymore. I'll
[36:32] walk right in. Right.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; But God didn't do that.
[36:37] He told them nothing of the trial that
[36:39] was coming.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Because in their heart would have gotten
[36:43] scared, would have been fearful.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Even Daniel sat in the lion's den. Would
[36:49] have been nice if Daniel the prophet of
[36:51] God. God did not give Daniel a vision of
[36:54] that.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Where he would not bow down. He actually
[36:59] he said, "I'm going to pray to the Lord
[37:00] Jesus Christ."
[37:03] God did not give him a vision of that.
[37:05] He had to go into that by faith.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; You can handle it, saints.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Now, notice here. Here he says, he says,
[37:15] "God is not a man that he should lie.
[37:18] Everything written in the word, he's not
[37:21] a man that should lie. There's always a
[37:24] way out. There's always a resolution.
[37:28] No matter what is plaguing you or trying
[37:32] to plague you, there is a way out. Trust
[37:35] in God.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ. He is so
[37:39] faithful. Amen. Now continue here. Now I
[37:44] want to uh jump here a little bit by
[37:46] God's grace.
[37:51] Now notice here he says he says then the
[37:53] spirit uh sorry then Christ the seed of
[37:56] Abraham and we were going and and we be
[37:59] uh being dead in Christ and baptized
[38:00] into the body. He says we are Abraham's
[38:02] seed and heirs of the promise and then
[38:03] how is it how are you how are you ever
[38:06] going to fall away if God made the
[38:08] promise to you? How are you going to
[38:10] ever backslide and go away and have have
[38:12] to go to hell for it? And you say well
[38:14] can we backslide?
[38:17] Absolutely.
[38:21] And when you baptize, you're going to
[38:24] get it. You don't. He says, he says,
[38:27] "Don't worry. Abraham got it and the
[38:29] rest of them got it and you'll get it.
[38:31] Don't you think it gives you the right
[38:33] to sin?" He says, "And it doesn't." He
[38:35] says, "You'll pay for everything you do.
[38:37] You'll reap what you sow."
[38:39] &gt;&gt; See, even so, notice why? Because Jesus
[38:42] is a good father.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; He's the everlasting father. And if you
[38:46] are a son of the king.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; If he loves you like he says he does,
[38:53] &gt;&gt; if he loves you like his own children,
[38:56] show me, I was like this. You show me
[38:57] someone who won't correct their child
[38:59] and we'll call him a backslid.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; We'll say like this even in the
[39:04] spiritual pastor Jesse, if pastor Jesse
[39:06] can't correct this and this sin in a
[39:08] church, however, then he's he's
[39:09] backslid, right? But if God is a true
[39:12] father, which he is, saints of God,
[39:13] every time we do something wrong, God is
[39:15] going to spank you. [laughter]
[39:18] Amen. That's why, saints of God, if you
[39:20] see anything little tiny creep in your
[39:22] life, get it out. Why? Do you want to
[39:24] get spanking? Do you want to get
[39:25] spanked? A lot of times, I remember when
[39:27] God when my dad used to spank me, I
[39:29] learned real fast.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; I was tried to be a obedient boy. First
[39:34] of all, because I was so tiny and second
[39:35] of all, because I don't like pain,
[39:36] right? And because of those things,
[39:39] saints of God, we learn real fast. Don't
[39:41] do this again. Don't do this. I see this
[39:44] coming. I'm not going to do that again.
[39:45] I'll say like that. Just like when I got
[39:46] in trouble with the law in denomination.
[39:48] You think I ever went and did that sin
[39:49] again? Nope.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; You think I want to go before a judge
[39:53] and say I'm on a probation for uh two
[39:57] years? You think I want to do that
[39:58] again? Nope.
[40:00] I learned real fast.
[40:03] I had to come before a judge and I was
[40:05] accountable for my actions.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; You know what? Thank God that thing that
[40:11] I did was just uh level four, the lowest
[40:15] of the lows, right? And he gave me the
[40:18] correct sentence. It was just two years
[40:19] of probation. I didn't have to meet with
[40:21] anybody. This is He said, "No, you go do
[40:23] this again." He said, "I see you again
[40:24] in this court." He says, "We're up in
[40:25] this thing." And he said, "You're going
[40:26] to have some problems." And I'm like,
[40:29] All I needed to hear was that judge's
[40:31] voice one time. All I needed to hear. I
[40:34] was like, "Yes, sir." Yeah. Me and you
[40:36] could be friends. [laughter]
[40:39] Yeah. I'll never We're not going to do
[40:41] this again ever.
[40:44] He says, "But brother," he says, he do
[40:46] one little sin and you'll reap a whole
[40:48] wash tub full. That's right. But
[40:50] brother, that don't mean to say you're
[40:52] lost. See, [applause]
[40:56] &gt;&gt; you're not lost. you messed up this,
[40:59] you've done this wrong, you've done that
[41:02] this sin or committed this crime or or
[41:04] this saints of God,
[41:06] that don't mean you're lost.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; You've heard the rumor how even uh
[41:10] Jeffrey Dawnmer, they say he gave his
[41:12] heart to the Lord in in prison and g and
[41:15] and supposedly received the Holy Ghost.
[41:21] The Malachi makes the rapture. First one
[41:24] in line, Jeffrey Dome, and just Mel
[41:26] like, "Praise the Lord. [laughter]
[41:29] Don't eat me." Right? We're gonna see
[41:32] people we are not going to expect.
[41:35] Who do you think the worst devils of
[41:40] this that's on this planet are going to
[41:43] attack the most? Satan's children or
[41:46] God's children?
[41:51] They've already got their own children.
[41:54] The devil, but now he he's hunting what?
[41:57] The souls that can't be lost and they
[42:00] can't.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "But brother, that don't mean
[42:03] you're lost." That's exactly right.
[42:05] Abraham reaped exactly what he sowed.
[42:07] That's right. But he was still saved.
[42:09] Let me say it like this in dealing with
[42:12] Abraham.
[42:14] Abraham, come out. He says, God says,
[42:16] "I'm going to make you a great nation.
[42:17] I'm going to have a I'm going to make
[42:19] you this this. He said just go into this
[42:20] land where I lead you. As soon as I get
[42:22] the land, what takes place? A famine.
[42:28] What does he do? Was he obedient to the
[42:31] promise of God?
[42:33] The father of our faith.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; If we be the true seed, spiritual seed
[42:40] of Abraham, was he obedient? Absolutely
[42:43] not. because times got hard, times got
[42:47] tough, he ran all the way back to Egypt.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; And in that time, notice one sin led to
[42:54] another. He lied about his sister, his
[42:56] wife.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; God actually had to intervene.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; God had to come down. Thanks God. The
[43:04] entire promise to him would have not
[43:06] taken place. He would have lost. The
[43:08] entire plan of God would have been lost
[43:10] had not God intervened. Right?
[43:13] &gt;&gt; And he's intervened for you.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; I'll say this. Think about your life.
[43:19] Has he intervened for you or not,
[43:22] saints? Amen. I know he's intervened for
[43:24] me and I know he's intervened for you.
[43:26] Amen. But now notice as God came and as
[43:29] God came and intervened and shut the
[43:31] pharaoh down, what happens?
[43:34] Even in his disobedience, Pharaoh said,
[43:37] "I'm going to give you camels. I'm going
[43:40] to give you sheep. I'm going to give you
[43:42] man's servants. And I'm going to give
[43:44] you woman's servants. And it looked like
[43:46] he had wrought the victory in
[43:48] disobedience.
[43:51] It looked like, man, even look, I I'm
[43:54] blessed no matter what.
[43:56] And he was. But because of that, what
[44:00] took place?
[44:02] Come down the way.
[44:05] Sarah's like, "Well, I'm not having a
[44:06] baby. Maybe take
[44:08] Hagar.
[44:10] And the Bible says Hagar was an
[44:12] Egyptian. Where did Abraham get her
[44:16] all the way from his first backslide?
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And now Hagar's children, Ishmamail's
[44:24] seed, are ruining the planet.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; They're ruining
[44:31] Europe. They're taking over America.
[44:37] Everything Abraham sowed,
[44:39] we get to reap. [laughter]
[44:43] &gt;&gt; See how this is, see, it looked like, oh
[44:45] man, I came out with all this great
[44:46] things, but what? He took one problem.
[44:48] One problem was with him.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; It looked like he gained the world.
[44:56] My [snorts]
[44:58] Now look, Abraham reaped exactly what he
[44:59] sowed. That's right. But he still was
[45:01] saved. Amen.
[45:05] Look at this. Romans 8. He says, "And he
[45:07] that searchth the hearts knoweth that
[45:09] what what is in the mind of the spirit
[45:11] because he maketh intercession for the
[45:12] saints according to the will of God."
[45:14] Let's get in the prayer like that. Get
[45:16] in the prayer, saints of God, where it's
[45:18] no longer you speaking, but you just the
[45:20] presence of God comes down. You start
[45:21] weeping and crying, uttering things
[45:23] which you don't even know what's being
[45:25] uttered. And yet, that's the Holy Spirit
[45:26] praying through you.
[45:29] And we know that all things work
[45:30] together for the good to them that love
[45:33] God, to them that are called according
[45:35] to his purpose.
[45:39] All your mistakes, God's going to work
[45:41] them to the good.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Every mistake, God is going to turn it
[45:47] into gold.
[45:52] Just like back in the middle medieval
[45:54] times, they called them alchemists. and
[45:56] they believe they could to take uh iron
[45:58] or some kind of ore or metal and turn it
[46:01] into gold magically or whatever they
[46:03] want to do, right? Well, God can do
[46:05] that.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; He can do anything. Did not he change a
[46:09] water to wine?
[46:12] Did he not speak this stuff into
[46:13] existence? [laughter] And he can do it
[46:16] for your life.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[46:21] I I love this. Now, one of the greatest
[46:23] examples coming up here. He says, "If
[46:25] the steps, the steps of a good man are
[46:27] ordered by the Lord."
[46:29] Ordered.
[46:32] Your life was ordered.
[46:34] Do you believe you're a seed of God?
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Everything has happened
[46:40] for a reason. I don't care if you think
[46:44] you made a mistake. I don't care if you
[46:47] know you've made a mistake.
[46:50] Everything is ordered.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; You have to understand this.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Every part of your life, God is in
[47:03] control of it. You have done things you
[47:06] don't even know what you've done and why
[47:08] you've done them.
[47:11] But it w if you're a seed of God, it
[47:13] wasn't you doing it. God literally
[47:15] allowed, he moved you that way. Here's a
[47:19] really good example. Brother Austin
[47:21] there went to was it Arizona or
[47:23] Colorado? Arizona. Look what he got.
[47:27] [laughter]
[47:32] Brother, your steps are ordered.
[47:34] [laughter]
[47:37] Sister Le's like, I'm just in Arizona
[47:39] hanging out. Hey, who's this who's this
[47:41] big tall guy? Hey, now your steps are
[47:44] ordered.
[47:46] You see the example?
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Explain that.
[47:53] Explain that please.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; We can't except this. The steps of a
[47:58] good man are ordered by the Lord. And he
[48:01] delightth in his way. He wanted you to
[48:05] go that way.
[48:07] We couldn't explain it. We didn't know
[48:08] anything about anything. SAINTS OF GOD.
[48:10] ALL I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I'm even
[48:11] where I'm at right now. But I know this.
[48:13] God is in control. Amen.
[48:15] Just keep walking with him. Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; We've got to fully get into the
[48:20] leadership of the spirit. Fully walk in
[48:22] the spirit. Amen.
[48:27] Now, let's continue on here. I'm at like
[48:29] 40 minutes. I got to start rolling here.
[48:32] He said, "Now, notice, let's let's do a
[48:33] little warning here. I'm not just saying
[48:34] to do whatever you want to do, but he
[48:37] says, "So many wants to go around. Some
[48:38] get another way. And when when you find
[48:40] out you find yourself going on, you find
[48:42] God blessing you, but you're working in
[48:44] his permissive will and not his perfect
[48:46] will.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; So there is a perfect will and a
[48:51] permissive will.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Now God can bring the permissive will
[48:56] back to his will. It's fully possible.
[48:59] In fact, it's promised. But notice, do
[49:01] we want to be in the permissive or
[49:03] perfect will? Perfect will. Now we're
[49:06] supposed to be now when you receive the
[49:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you became a
[49:08] babe in Christ. Right? Now notice we
[49:11] have we have to then we grow into
[49:13] maturity.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; And as we grow in maturity, we should be
[49:18] able to see what the word as things come
[49:21] to us now in our lives. Thanks God. This
[49:22] is 2025. How many's been a Christian for
[49:25] 10 years?
[49:27] &gt;&gt; 15 20 25. We've got to come up higher in
[49:32] the word, right? We've got to know who
[49:34] our husband is. We've got to know the
[49:37] word and what the word is. And it's like
[49:39] this. You've got to in your life when
[49:42] these things come, bring it back to the
[49:44] scripture.
[49:48] Well, I have an opportunity to do this
[49:49] or to do this. Is this going to hurt my
[49:51] church attendance? Is this going to hurt
[49:52] me this way? In the spiritual realm, is
[49:54] any of this going to hurt my spiritual
[49:56] life?
[49:57] &gt;&gt; That's main thing.
[50:04] What if I came up and said, "What if
[50:06] what if next time you Lord willing,
[50:08] brother Jess has me and I say, saints of
[50:09] God, praise the Lord, I just got a job
[50:11] offer. I'm going to make $300,000, but I
[50:13] got to go overseas for like two years.
[50:14] It's been good seeing you, brother. I'll
[50:15] see you when you're bigger, stronger,
[50:16] and even faster. I never know. God bless
[50:18] you, brother. Hey, hey, I pray that God
[50:20] will bless you continually. Uh, but I
[50:22] got to go. I got to make some money." Is
[50:24] that permissive will or the will of God?
[50:27] Am I chasing after him or I'm chasing
[50:30] after this?
[50:34] a man
[50:36] I could buy a lot of things
[50:39] going overseas working where there's
[50:41] gold working where's this those things
[50:43] of God that's and those are that's that
[50:44] would be a big thing but now are little
[50:46] things in life
[50:48] &gt;&gt; do I pay my tithes
[50:51] do I give offerings
[50:54] and what is left can you give an all in
[50:57] secret
[51:00] &gt;&gt; because if you can do these little
[51:01] things, God will trust you with the
[51:03] bigger things.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Remember, we we're to grow up. We have
[51:06] to mature in the word of God, right?
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I'm striving as well, saints. He says,
[51:14] now can hear
[51:18] in the time of Joseph, Joseph had many
[51:20] dreams, right? He was a dreamer.
[51:25] I don't believe any of his brothers and
[51:26] his father and mother didn't even
[51:27] believe any of the dreams. But the dream
[51:30] came to Joseph and he believed it. And
[51:33] because he believed it, he couldn't
[51:34] explain it. He just believed it. It
[51:36] doesn't make any sense.
[51:39] But at the end of the day, when he came
[51:42] down to where the rubber meets the road,
[51:43] look what he tells his brothers after
[51:45] Jacob dies.
[51:48] And Joseph said to them, "Fear not, for
[51:49] I am I for am I in the place of God? But
[51:52] as for you, ye thought evil against me,
[51:54] but God meant it unto good, to bring to
[51:56] pass as it is this day to save much
[51:58] people alive.
[52:01] Joseph had to go through all that to
[52:02] what? Save his brothers, save his
[52:05] sisters. He God used him to save the
[52:08] world because there was a famine coming.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; From the time Joseph was born, God knew
[52:14] a famine was coming.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; God ordained the famine. [laughter]
[52:20] He ordained the birth of Joseph and
[52:22] because of those things he wanted to
[52:24] glorify the God of heaven. Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; He wanted to show who was the blessed
[52:28] one. Amen. The I like this the chosen
[52:30] one of that family. Right?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Who he was going to be a prophet, right?
[52:35] &gt;&gt; And God allowed all those things to
[52:37] transpire.
[52:39] Let his brothers get envious and jealous
[52:42] and and hateful and sell him and this
[52:44] this and treat him like garbage. What?
[52:45] So the not only his brothers but
[52:47] everyone could be saved.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; And Christ did the exact same thing.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Now
[52:56] here's the best here's one of the best
[52:57] examples
[53:02] in the time of David. [clears throat]
[53:07] We know the story of David. A man after
[53:08] God's own heart.
[53:11] I absolutely adore David.
[53:19] And we know what took place when he
[53:21] decided to stay home from battle.
[53:28] He went and took Uriah's wife, Basheba,
[53:33] did a secret sin. Correct.
[53:44] David took permissive will.
[53:48] Now I want you to notice something here.
[53:50] This right here picks up right here
[53:53] where Nathan the prophet comes to David.
[53:55] Right?
[53:57] Is there any record in the scripture
[53:59] where Nathan first comes to Basheba?
[54:07] Basheba.
[54:09] Why are you out bathing at night in
[54:12] front of the king?
[54:13] Don't you know you
[54:18] is there any rebuke to search the
[54:20] scriptures any rebuke to Bashiba?
[54:26] No. Wait a sec. You're telling me that
[54:27] that she was not in fault.
[54:35] [laughter]
[54:41] Now, as Nathan bypasses Basheba, he goes
[54:45] right to the real problem.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Basheba was bathing. She couldn't call
[54:52] her maid servant say, "Go get David.
[54:55] Bring him over here." She didn't have
[54:56] the power to do that.
[54:59] She was out bathing.
[55:02] I like how brother Brookie say she knew
[55:04] what she was doing.
[55:08] But now as Nathan advances now to David,
[55:14] for thou did it secretly. But I will do
[55:17] this thing before all Israel, before the
[55:19] son. And David said unto Nathan, I have
[55:22] sinned against the Lord, against Uriah,
[55:28] against Basheba,
[55:31] against this child in Bashibba's womb,
[55:34] against Israel,
[55:36] against the office of a king.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; See, God, and of all our failures is we
[55:42] are sinning against God.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Even amongst each other, if I do this
[55:46] brother wrong, this this I have to
[55:48] repent to him. But I've also if I if I
[55:50] did something say brother I'm so sorry
[55:51] forgive me please forgive me brother
[55:54] don't my charge
[55:57] I would have to also repent to God as my
[56:00] savior because like the brother bram
[56:02] dealing with the the husband the wife
[56:03] and they both had affairs this this had
[56:05] to make it right on every side
[56:08] remember in discernment line she comes
[56:10] up brother said he says hey remember
[56:12] before the war when your husband off the
[56:13] war and you went to this she goes how do
[56:14] you know that I've already made it right
[56:16] with God see she made made it right with
[56:19] God, but she never made it right with
[56:20] her husband.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; But it's the same way. If she'd have
[56:24] made it right with her husband, but not
[56:25] told God or repented from God, it's
[56:27] still with her.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Everything must be clean.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; There was a sermon about a year ago,
[56:33] Brother McBride came here and I listened
[56:34] to it and I'll never forget what he
[56:36] said. He said, "God is not going to let
[56:39] his bride get away with nothing."
[56:42] &gt;&gt; You remember that? I listen that sermon.
[56:44] I was like, "Woo, that thing was burnt
[56:46] into my heart. I said, "Lord, keep me
[56:49] clean. Cleanse me. Don't let me get away
[56:53] with nothing. Let saints of God, let me
[56:55] repent of every sense." God, since that
[56:58] time, I've been able to go on Facebook,
[57:01] contact some of my old college friends,
[57:04] college buddies, fraternity, sorority,
[57:06] and start making things right one by
[57:08] one.
[57:09] Things I had forgotten, I did, I lied, I
[57:12] did this and this, I did this, this,
[57:13] this. I've been texting them. I said,
[57:14] "Hey, do you remember when I did this,
[57:16] this?" And some of them were like,
[57:17] "Yeah." And some of them were like,
[57:18] "No." And I said, "Well, I want to make
[57:19] it right." And I had to make it right
[57:21] through Facebook. They said, "Simon, I
[57:24] forgive you. You're still my friend." I
[57:25] haven't seen him in 30 years. They're
[57:26] still my friend. He says, "I'm still
[57:27] your friend." I was like, "Praise the
[57:28] Lord." [laughter] But what? They gave me
[57:29] grace. They forgave me, saints.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Now that burden's off
[57:34] me. I didn't even know that a lot of
[57:36] those sins I didn't even know was there.
[57:38] I've forgotten all about them. But I
[57:41] kept saying, "Lord, help me to get
[57:42] everything right." And he'd bring this
[57:44] thought. I'm like, "Oh my goodness, I
[57:46] did do that. Let me look on Facebook." I
[57:49] was able to contact them. People I
[57:51] haven't spoken to in years and years and
[57:52] years.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; He's faithful. You know what you do?
[57:56] You when you sing to God, there's always
[57:58] this fear in making something right.
[58:01] No one likes confrontation. No one likes
[58:03] to admit their own faults and failures,
[58:05] right?
[58:06] &gt;&gt; But you know what I find? Just say it.
[58:10] Just say it.
[58:13] They're either going to hate you or
[58:14] they're going to forgive you. Either
[58:16] way, you are in the clear. The you have
[58:18] no blood on your hands.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Now, notice
[58:25] David's in the wrong. He says, "I
[58:28] [clears throat] have sinned against the
[58:29] Lord, and Nathan said to David, the Lord
[58:31] also has put away thy sin, and thou
[58:33] shalt not die." He gets grace.
[58:38] David gets grace for this heinous crime.
[58:40] a death of one of his 30 mightiest
[58:43] warriors, his top 30. He Uriah was
[58:46] there, David's mighty men. And he did
[58:49] that to his own man.
[58:54] Was this in the will of God?
[58:58] Everything will work out the perfect
[59:01] will of God. Look what it says here. And
[59:03] David comforted Bashibba his wife and
[59:04] went into her and lay with her. And she
[59:06] bare a son and called his name Solomon.
[59:08] And the Lord loved him.
[59:10] You mean out of this situation, God
[59:13] could bring forth a child that God
[59:15] loved?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; David would have to pay for it. And he
[59:21] paid tremendously.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; He paid dearly with that sin. But I'll
[59:26] say it like this, saints. It was of God.
[59:29] God allowed it.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Now notice, and the Lord loved him, and
[59:34] he sent by the hand of Nathan the
[59:35] prophet, and he called his name Jediah
[59:37] because of the Lord. Now, of all the
[59:41] ladies, of all the sisters in Israel at
[59:44] the time of David,
[59:47] why did God allow Uriah to have his
[59:50] house so close to David that as Basheba
[59:53] was taking a bath, he could see her?
[59:58] &gt;&gt; He was setting the stage.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Now, notice notice the name play here.
[1:00:06] Solomon the Lord loved him.
[1:00:12] Solomon had a meaning. What does David
[1:00:14] mean? I mean I think David means beloved
[1:00:15] of the Lord.
[1:00:18] So the beloved of the Lord
[1:00:23] took a wife called Bad Sheba, right?
[1:00:28] It had to be be Basheba. It could not be
[1:00:30] any other woman to bring forth Solomon.
[1:00:34] only the it would not be Micaiah or
[1:00:37] Michael Mcccoall right
[1:00:40] Solomon would never come through MCL
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; but it could only come through Basheba
[1:00:47] what does the name Basheba mean that
[1:00:48] word Basheba means a daughter of an oath
[1:00:54] so the beloved one had to pick a
[1:00:56] daughter of the oath and if you break
[1:00:57] this down that word bath part means the
[1:01:00] apple or the branch a daughter
[1:01:04] Sheba means to what? To complete to be
[1:01:07] complete. An oath. He says a sevenfold
[1:01:11] oneself. That is that is to swear by
[1:01:14] declaring seven times.
[1:01:17] So God allowed to pick David to sin this
[1:01:20] sin with Basheba because because of her
[1:01:22] name,
[1:01:24] she carried a sevenfold oath.
[1:01:29] Seven times is completion.
[1:01:34] Why Bashibba?
[1:01:36] Because the names mean something.
[1:01:40] Your name packs a power. Seeing then,
[1:01:43] seeing how it began in the church of
[1:01:44] Ephesus in the second church age, third
[1:01:46] church age, the fourth church age, 15
[1:01:47] years down all the way to later see the
[1:01:49] last age in the Old Testament in the
[1:01:51] Lord willing, maybe in some servants
[1:01:53] coming. I'd like to show how the old how
[1:01:55] that the seven church ages typed in the
[1:01:57] Old Testament.
[1:02:00] how they began to just exactly like the
[1:02:02] beginning of the church age of the
[1:02:03] gentile church and went right down
[1:02:04] through a similar dark age and came in
[1:02:06] the glorious line of Pentecost at the
[1:02:08] falling of the Holy Spirit in the early
[1:02:09] church age of Jewish dispensation.
[1:02:11] Right?
[1:02:13] Seeing in the Old Testament how
[1:02:14] perfectly typed at beginning in Solomon.
[1:02:20] So David had to produce with Basheba why
[1:02:23] she was the start. She would bring forth
[1:02:26] the seven church ages of the Old
[1:02:28] Testament.
[1:02:34] Literally the seven churches of the Old
[1:02:37] Testament started with David and
[1:02:38] Bashibba.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Do you see the power in that?
[1:02:44] What was the culmination? What was the
[1:02:46] end of this? John the Baptist.
[1:02:49] That that sin by David and Basheba. That
[1:02:52] thing right there ended with B with with
[1:02:55] John the Baptist coming out. And then
[1:02:56] who' it really end with? Jesus Christ.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; He can take something that was done
[1:03:04] wrong and turn it into the coming of the
[1:03:08] first coming of the Messiah.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; And you think your sin's too big?
[1:03:15] [laughter]
[1:03:16] Do you think that God is not going to
[1:03:18] cover your thing? He's going to work
[1:03:19] this out, saints.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:03:32] [snorts]
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What took place the the time of
[1:03:34] Solomon's temple being dedicated? The
[1:03:36] Holy Ghost came down just like in the
[1:03:38] book of Acts. All the ministers had to
[1:03:41] stop and freeze. Why? The train filled
[1:03:43] the temple.
[1:03:47] Out of that union started this.
[1:03:52] That's that's truly amazing.
[1:03:54] Now, we're getting about an hour here. I
[1:03:57] want to jump here by God's grace.
[1:04:01] In the time of Judah and uh uh Tamar,
[1:04:07] remember the story about Judah? Tamar,
[1:04:09] Tamar married one of the sons of Judah
[1:04:10] and he died. The other one died and now
[1:04:12] Judah's like, I promise my next boy when
[1:04:14] he grows up, he'll be your husband. And
[1:04:16] she's like waiting and waiting and being
[1:04:18] patient this this. And when he become of
[1:04:20] age,
[1:04:23] he didn't give her to him.
[1:04:26] And Tamar was like, "Wait, what's this?
[1:04:28] What's this? We got to have a deal here.
[1:04:29] The deals." So what'd she do? She, the
[1:04:31] Bible says she took off her widowing
[1:04:33] garments and pull on the garments of a
[1:04:34] harlot. We know what took place next.
[1:04:37] Then it was three months later, found
[1:04:39] out she was pregnant. And Judah's like,
[1:04:41] "All right, you're going to die. Tell
[1:04:42] who did it?" And she had the signness of
[1:04:45] Judah. She said, "The man whose
[1:04:47] sicknessar is a child that I'm bearing."
[1:04:50] [laughter]
[1:04:52] Did she did she reap for her sin?
[1:04:56] Was she guilty?
[1:04:58] Judah said, "Thou art more righteous
[1:05:00] than I."
[1:05:04] Basheba was never at fault. Never blamed
[1:05:07] on her. Tamar not in fault.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:05:14] look at this.
[1:05:19] Can't we we can forgive but not forget.
[1:05:21] I I could forgive you but I always
[1:05:22] remember you done these evil things then
[1:05:25] but but you're not just you're forgiven
[1:05:27] but in the sight of God the bride is
[1:05:30] justified.
[1:05:32] She never done it in the first place.
[1:05:35] Amen. You know I heard this quote. I was
[1:05:38] like I don't I don't understand this. I
[1:05:40] just don't get it right.
[1:05:44] Amen. standing there married to the
[1:05:46] virtuous son of God, never sinned in the
[1:05:48] first place. Why? She was for ordained.
[1:05:52] She was trapped into this.
[1:05:57] This is you. He's talking about you.
[1:06:04] When someone's preaching about the bride
[1:06:06] of Christ,
[1:06:07] bring it back to yourself.
[1:06:10] This is you.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; She was trapped in this. And now when
[1:06:14] she heard the truth come forth and the
[1:06:16] blood cleansed her, she stands there
[1:06:18] virtuous. No sin at all at all.
[1:06:22] Where's this? Where is this written in
[1:06:24] the Bible?
[1:06:28] [snorts]
[1:06:29] Look here. Let's go right to the be
[1:06:31] beginning. And the Lord God formed man
[1:06:33] out of the dust of the ground and
[1:06:34] breathed in his nostrils the breath of
[1:06:35] life. And man became the living soul.
[1:06:37] You know why he stood man first? Because
[1:06:38] he's the head. He would be the head. He
[1:06:41] would be the husband. All the weight
[1:06:43] would be on him as brother Jesse said
[1:06:44] preached years and right in the
[1:06:46] beginning he talked about the hus the
[1:06:47] house band. He used to take the house
[1:06:50] and as it it would things would get bad
[1:06:52] and he'd have to keep everything
[1:06:54] together. If it started expanding he's
[1:06:56] got to move with it. If it gets less
[1:06:57] he's got to move with that as well. The
[1:06:59] house band, right? He's to keep it
[1:07:00] together.
[1:07:03] And now notice who does the serpent
[1:07:05] attack first? Who does he go after? The
[1:07:07] woman.
[1:07:08] But after the fall,
[1:07:11] look what God says to Eve. I will
[1:07:14] greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:07:17] conception in sorrow that thou shalt
[1:07:19] bring forth children and thy desire
[1:07:20] shall be to thy husband. He shall rule
[1:07:22] overe. Does he say anything because thou
[1:07:24] has disobeyed the word?
[1:07:28] Does he bring the word in here?
[1:07:34] Eve, I told you or your husband should
[1:07:39] have told you, thou shalt not eat of of
[1:07:42] the tree of knowledge good and evil.
[1:07:43] Where does he bring that there? He does
[1:07:45] not bring that to her charge. But look
[1:07:47] here. And to Adam, he said, because thou
[1:07:50] has hearkened unto the voice thy wife
[1:07:51] and has eaten of the tree which I
[1:07:53] commanded thee, saying, thou shalt not
[1:07:54] eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy
[1:07:56] sake. That commandment is allotted to
[1:07:58] Adam and not Eve.
[1:08:05] Do you know in the whole Bible Eve is
[1:08:08] pretty much mentioned only one other
[1:08:09] time as far as this. Look at this.
[1:08:13] And I suffer not a woman to teach but to
[1:08:15] you to abs you super authority over the
[1:08:18] man but to be in silence. For Adam was
[1:08:20] first formed than Eve. And Adam was not
[1:08:22] deceived but the woman was deceived.
[1:08:25] What's what's the Bible saying? She was
[1:08:27] deceived. She was trapped. When the
[1:08:29] serpent came into the garden of Eden, he
[1:08:31] was setting a trap. There was time for
[1:08:33] deception, a time for beguiling, to
[1:08:36] morally, utterly seduced morally and
[1:08:38] utterly and in the mind. She was
[1:08:42] trapped. There was a trap set for her.
[1:08:47] And she had no idea. She was deceived.
[1:08:56] Adam was not deceived. In other words,
[1:08:59] he knew better.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He knew better. She did not.
[1:09:06] The word was not accounted to someone
[1:09:08] who was deceived.
[1:09:11] But the word was accounted to someone
[1:09:13] who knew better.
[1:09:20] Now,
[1:09:21] in the Bible,
[1:09:24] when it's talking about redemption,
[1:09:27] when it's talking about
[1:09:30] salvation,
[1:09:33] there's only two people involved.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; And one of them is not Eve. [laughter]
[1:09:44] Oh man, I I never I never saw this until
[1:09:47] a couple months ago.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; If the bride is sinless and she never
[1:09:54] did in the first place and she was
[1:09:56] trapped into this and she can be married
[1:09:58] to the virtuous sinless son of God.
[1:10:05] The original sin had nothing to do with
[1:10:07] her.
[1:10:09] The original sin was held to Adam.
[1:10:13] Not the bride.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Where's it written?
[1:10:19] Wherefore, as by one woman sin entered
[1:10:22] into the world. Does it say Eve? Does it
[1:10:26] say Adam's wife? Or did it say Adam
[1:10:30] part B? Because remember when they first
[1:10:32] took place there both their names were
[1:10:34] Adam. [laughter]
[1:10:36] But after the fall, he gave her a name
[1:10:38] Eve. But notice Christ here, the Holy
[1:10:40] Ghost says he says by one woman, not by
[1:10:42] one man. He says by one man. He doesn't
[1:10:45] even say Adam this time. He says what?
[1:10:47] One man. Sin entered into the world and
[1:10:50] death by sin. It was caused by him and
[1:10:53] him alone. He had to make the choice. He
[1:10:56] was not deceived.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He says, "So death passed upon all men
[1:10:59] that they all have sinned." He says,
[1:11:01] "For unto the law sin was in the world,
[1:11:04] but but sin was not imputed where
[1:11:05] there's no law."
[1:11:07] What does it say? For until the law, sin
[1:11:09] was in the world, but sin was not
[1:11:11] imputed until there was uh when there
[1:11:14] was no law. So if God when he gave Adam
[1:11:18] that garden of Eden, so here you go.
[1:11:21] Here, this is nice. We're on the east
[1:11:23] side of Eden. Here's a nice garden. I
[1:11:25] got all this planted. All you got to do
[1:11:26] is keep it. And he would have not given
[1:11:29] a commandment. We wouldn't be here.
[1:11:32] [laughter]
[1:11:33] We'd still be in paradise. we'd be
[1:11:36] eternal. We'd be we'd be spoken word,
[1:11:38] sons and daughters of God, perfect.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; But God set the stage again
[1:11:46] because soon as he put this man in
[1:11:48] order, gave him a job, this, this, this,
[1:11:50] he gave him a commandment.
[1:11:53] And when he gave him a commandment, it
[1:11:55] set the it set the opportunity, it set
[1:11:58] the place for him to sin.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; We had to sin. We had to go into this.
[1:12:06] This is the perfect will of God.
[1:12:09] Even when all Christians are being
[1:12:10] martyed over in Kenya and Christians
[1:12:11] over here and this and this dying and
[1:12:13] the the world's falling apart and our
[1:12:15] economyy's they say in 2026 it's going
[1:12:17] to get bad. We don't know. But if it if
[1:12:19] it drops, thanks God. It's all the part
[1:12:20] of God. It's all the plan of God.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; It's his plan.
[1:12:25] This is where he wants it to go. Yes,
[1:12:28] sir.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't because of the wife. It
[1:12:32] wasn't because of Eve. He says,
[1:12:34] "Nevertheless, death reigned from Eve to
[1:12:37] Moses,
[1:12:38] from Adam." Even over all them that had
[1:12:41] sinned after the similitude of Eve's
[1:12:44] transgression.
[1:12:46] All blame is brought upon Adam.
[1:12:50] [laughter]
[1:12:52] After the similitude of Adam's
[1:12:53] transgression, who is the figure of him
[1:12:56] that was to come? [laughter]
[1:12:58] Saints of God, it is written nowhere in
[1:13:01] the Bible, it's your fault.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the sin. I'm talking
[1:13:07] about the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; You had nothing to do with this. You
[1:13:14] were trapped here. You were caught here.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the Bible does this link to
[1:13:22] her.
[1:13:24] For since by man woman man came death,
[1:13:29] by man came also the resurrection of the
[1:13:31] dead. You know why it couldn't be Eve?
[1:13:33] Why? You know why Eve had to be
[1:13:34] deceived? Because if she brought that
[1:13:36] transgression, God would have to be a
[1:13:38] woman.
[1:13:41] But because God is a man, [laughter]
[1:13:45] he had to bring forth a man first
[1:13:46] because that man had to fall. If a man
[1:13:48] fell, take a man to redeem it. Amen.
[1:13:54] Jesus came as a man.
[1:13:58] [laughter]
[1:13:59] The husband, the mysteries between the
[1:14:00] husband and the wife. Ephesians 5,
[1:14:02] right? Or four, how it was, right?
[1:14:04] That's the great mystery between the
[1:14:06] husband and the wife. Christ and the
[1:14:08] church.
[1:14:11] This has nothing to do with you.
[1:14:16] For by man came death. By man also came
[1:14:18] the resurrection of the dead. Even as as
[1:14:20] in as all as in Adam all died. Eve all
[1:14:24] died.
[1:14:25] Adam. Even so in Christ shall we all be
[1:14:29] made alive.
[1:14:31] Now here's the beautiful thing.
[1:14:34] Adam was human.
[1:14:37] Human.
[1:14:39] Sinful.
[1:14:43] Was Christ a Jew?
[1:14:45] No.
[1:14:47] said he he was born out of the lineage
[1:14:49] of the Jews in the He came in the
[1:14:51] likeness of that.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; But that was God.
[1:14:57] [laughter]
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; That was God in flesh. That was a that
[1:15:01] was a a body in the likeness of sinful
[1:15:04] flesh.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; He was not Jewish. He was God.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; A God flesh. A GOD MAN. A GOD PROPHET. a
[1:15:15] god body, sinless.
[1:15:18] It could die, but it couldn't it
[1:15:20] couldn't rot.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; It couldn't see corruption. Why? Because
[1:15:24] it was the word. Where's the safest
[1:15:26] place to be? In heaven, on earth, or on
[1:15:29] the word of God.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; The bride is sinless.
[1:15:40] Now, you just can't say that and sin no
[1:15:42] more, right?
[1:15:44] Uh should we let grace abound in sin?
[1:15:46] No.
[1:15:49] But when someone who is receive the
[1:15:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:55] they're sinless in the eyes of God.
[1:15:59] Now, here's here's the part. Here's the
[1:16:00] hard part right here.
[1:16:03] Shall we continue in sin that grace may
[1:16:05] abound? God forbid. How shall we that
[1:16:07] are dead to sin? What did the Bible say?
[1:16:10] You are dead to sin.
[1:16:13] And if you're dead to sin,
[1:16:16] you're sinless,
[1:16:23] live any longer therein.
[1:16:26] So know ye know ye that that so many of
[1:16:29] us was baptized into see this is why
[1:16:31] that baptism is so important, brothers
[1:16:32] and sisters. Baptized into Jesus Christ
[1:16:35] was baptized into his death. Therefore,
[1:16:38] we are buried with him by baptism into
[1:16:40] death. So that as a as Christ was in the
[1:16:42] in the was raised up from the dead uh uh
[1:16:44] by the glory of the father, even so we
[1:16:46] also should walk in the newness of life.
[1:16:49] For if we've been planted together in
[1:16:50] the likeness of his death, we shall also
[1:16:52] in the likeness of his resurrection.
[1:16:55] Knowing this that our old man is
[1:16:56] crucified with him.
[1:16:59] When brother Malachi got baptized, this
[1:17:01] old Malachi died right there.
[1:17:06] When you got baptized in the name of
[1:17:07] Jesus Christ, your old man died right
[1:17:09] there.
[1:17:11] From that point, sin was already dead to
[1:17:15] you.
[1:17:17] But did we understand it? It's just like
[1:17:20] this. When I was when I was in the world
[1:17:23] in college, I was an atheist, a heathen.
[1:17:25] But then I had to have awakening come
[1:17:27] say
[1:17:30] maybe I'm supposed to serve God. And I
[1:17:32] started going back hearing the word. I
[1:17:34] believe, man, I'm a son of God. Then I
[1:17:36] come to message and I really knew I was
[1:17:37] a son of God.
[1:17:39] But what that revelation came almost
[1:17:42] 2,000 years after it was finished.
[1:17:45] It's the same right here. I was baptized
[1:17:48] in 2001.
[1:17:50] But are we coming to the revelation that
[1:17:52] the dead, their sin's already dead in
[1:17:55] this flesh? It's already dead. Our old
[1:18:00] man is crucified with him that the body
[1:18:02] of sin might be destroyed that
[1:18:04] henceforth we should know serve we
[1:18:06] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[1:18:08] is sin sorry sorry that he's dead is
[1:18:10] freed from sin
[1:18:13] you're freed
[1:18:16] the only reason we fall and stumble is
[1:18:19] because we let this rain in our b m
[1:18:21] mortal bodies
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; but Paul said we've got to die daily and
[1:18:25] not let this rain on our mortal bodies
[1:18:28] sin Right?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; So now it becomes part of us to battle.
[1:18:33] What was the promised land? It was the
[1:18:35] type of the Holy Ghost person. Right?
[1:18:37] Going into the promised land of the Holy
[1:18:38] Ghost. But what notice? God was going to
[1:18:40] give it to him. But there was still many
[1:18:43] enemies in the land. There's still many
[1:18:45] enemies right here. But remember who's
[1:18:48] going to get the victory? Who fights for
[1:18:49] Israel? Who fights for you? God.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; We still see some giants in here. We
[1:18:55] still see our enemies right here. But
[1:18:57] who's going to fight for us saints?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; It's not. Now, we had to do a little bit
[1:19:01] fighting, praying, fasting, and laboring
[1:19:03] for God, giving what? Uh uh being
[1:19:04] obedient to the word, but saints of God.
[1:19:06] And overall, he's going to give the
[1:19:08] victory.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; You already have the victory. Now, we
[1:19:11] just have to what? Yield.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Every time Israel tried to go into
[1:19:16] battle without thus say the Lord, they
[1:19:18] lost
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; without the leading Lord or presumably
[1:19:22] they lost. Saints.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here we go. Almost done. Let not
[1:19:29] sin therefore reign in your mortal body
[1:19:30] that you should obey it in the lust
[1:19:32] thereof.
[1:19:33] Right? Two
[1:19:37] two laws. Look here. You are standing
[1:19:41] completely justified as though you never
[1:19:43] did it at the beginning. This is the my
[1:19:46] message to the church now. Right before
[1:19:48] he leaves the world, he he goes off the
[1:19:50] scene. There's uh November 25th.
[1:19:54] This is my message to you now. You are
[1:19:57] completely justified.
[1:20:00] If you know you are completely
[1:20:01] justified,
[1:20:03] in other words, if you know that God has
[1:20:04] no sin against you, what can you do?
[1:20:08] Speak the word.
[1:20:10] What do you What do you need, son? What
[1:20:14] do you need? Well, I'm in need of this.
[1:20:17] How can God not answer someone that is
[1:20:20] not even guilty of any sin?
[1:20:23] All you have to do is believe it.
[1:20:27] The the prophet said, he said, "The
[1:20:28] skies are full of plent Pentecostal
[1:20:30] blessings.
[1:20:32] The powers of heaven are waiting for us
[1:20:35] to call for them.
[1:20:39] You're standing complete, justified,
[1:20:42] like you never did in the first place."
[1:20:44] Hallelujah.
[1:20:48] Let's stand here.
[1:20:51] I know it was simple brothers and
[1:20:52] sisters but I'm telling you we have to
[1:20:54] catch this full revelation
[1:20:57] and I'll say this when you catch it for
[1:20:59] yourself
[1:21:01] when you have this and you know that
[1:21:04] this might fall but I'm sinless in the
[1:21:06] eyes of God
[1:21:08] at that point you can have it for others
[1:21:13] I can be like man I just failed but I
[1:21:15] know I'm sinless God I forgive God
[1:21:17] forgive me I've repented and I can Look
[1:21:20] at this brother. Sinless. I can look at
[1:21:22] this brother. Completely sinless.
[1:21:25] A young man might have a struggle as
[1:21:27] this is. But tell you what, God's God's
[1:21:29] in control. You have, saints of God, you
[1:21:31] have to have the exact same grace, the
[1:21:34] exact same uh uh mercy that you see in
[1:21:36] yourself on others.
[1:21:41] when this comes down to it as far as
[1:21:43] like uh let's say with interactions with
[1:21:46] the church,
[1:21:48] if this brother right here sees me do
[1:21:50] something wrong,
[1:21:53] don't wait too long. Just say, "Hey,
[1:21:55] brother Simon, let's make everything
[1:21:57] right right away."
[1:22:00] Because things if we let things continue
[1:22:02] to go on here and there, this things it
[1:22:04] grows.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; We've got to cut these things right at
[1:22:08] the beginning. If there's anything
[1:22:10] anything between anyone in here. Let's
[1:22:12] get it right tonight or this morning.
[1:22:15] Let's get this thing all right. Any
[1:22:17] unconfessed sins, anything we've got
[1:22:18] against this saint, get it all out. Get
[1:22:20] it done.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; And then what? The the Holy Ghost can
[1:22:24] come and do mighty things right. Amen.
[1:22:26] I'm not saying this anyone's guilty of
[1:22:27] that. I'm just saying.
[1:22:30] Notice he said, "This is my message to
[1:22:31] church." Now, as you as we go off of the
[1:22:33] air, just in a minute, you are standing.
[1:22:35] If you're standing on God's word and
[1:22:37] with God's word, every Amen. John tit
[1:22:39] every jaw Jesus every tit where are you
[1:22:41] standing I'm trying to tell you pull
[1:22:42] away from them shucks and get out here
[1:22:44] in the wheat where you'll get right
[1:22:46] before the sun I hear the coming of the
[1:22:48] combine you're standing complete
[1:22:51] justified like you never did in the
[1:22:53] first place hallelujah
[1:22:55] you are the pure virtuous sinless bride
[1:22:59] of the son living God every man and
[1:23:01] woman that's born of the spirit of God
[1:23:03] and wash in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:04] and believes every word of God stands as
[1:23:07] though you've never sinned at the the
[1:23:08] first place. You are
[1:23:11] perfect.
[1:23:13] Musicians, if you want to come play,
[1:23:16] I know it's simple saints, but this is a
[1:23:20] revelation.
[1:23:23] It's written in the word. It's hidden in
[1:23:26] the word, but this is a revelation.
[1:23:33] Prophet says it even himself.
[1:23:36] He says it says we are the very
[1:23:38] righteousness of God. What is God's
[1:23:39] righteousness? Perfection. He's holy.
[1:23:42] He's pure. He's pure. Undefiled.
[1:23:45] Just like brother Pastor Jesse has been
[1:23:46] preaching on what? Holiness. The
[1:23:47] holiness of God.
[1:23:49] Brother said he said the the presence of
[1:23:51] Jesus Christ is different than the
[1:23:53] presence of an angel.
[1:23:56] You look at the Revelations one where
[1:23:58] John was standing before God uh before
[1:24:00] Jesus. He said he fell down as one
[1:24:02] slain.
[1:24:04] We're dealing with the all omnipotent
[1:24:06] mighty creator.
[1:24:10] And if he laid his righteousness down
[1:24:14] so that we could be it,
[1:24:17] it says that he Jesus became sin for us.
[1:24:20] It does not say he became sinful. He
[1:24:22] became sin for us that by our union with
[1:24:24] him we might become the righteousness of
[1:24:26] God.
[1:24:29] If we accept the fact and we must that
[1:24:32] he literally became sin for us by his
[1:24:34] substitution for us. He took our spot.
[1:24:39] Adam took the spot of Eve.
[1:24:43] The judgment fell on Adam.
[1:24:49] Then we must also accept the fact that
[1:24:51] we are by union with him have become the
[1:24:53] very righteousness of God. To reject one
[1:24:57] is to reject the other.
[1:24:59] Are you the righteousness of Jesus
[1:25:00] Christ?
[1:25:02] Let's say it all in one accord. Are you
[1:25:04] the righteousness of Jesus Christ? Yes.
[1:25:07] And amen. Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Now, accept it and go on. Believe it. If
[1:25:13] you have that drop into your heart, into
[1:25:15] your mind, saints,
[1:25:17] you can ask God for whatever
[1:25:22] and have full [music] faith in him that
[1:25:24] he's going to give it to you.
[1:25:28] And we know that the Bible says that it
[1:25:30] can't be denied. But the revelation of
[1:25:32] it is missing.
[1:25:34] Remember, the true church will catch
[1:25:36] this revelation.
[1:25:39] When she knows who she is,
[1:25:42] and when she knows who she is, she can
[1:25:44] do the greater works.
[1:25:48] It is not a is not real to the majority
[1:25:51] of God's children. See, [laughter]
[1:25:55] if you're God's children, don't feel
[1:25:57] bad. A lot of us are still waiting to
[1:25:59] catch this revelation.
[1:26:01] I see it in the word, saints myself. But
[1:26:03] I'm still waiting for this revelation to
[1:26:05] fully drop. I'm not talking about word
[1:26:07] form. I'm talking about realization.
[1:26:11] Cuz when it hits re realization, you
[1:26:13] know,
[1:26:16] you know you're different. You know
[1:26:18] you're sinless. You know everything
[1:26:20] about you is under the blood of Jesus
[1:26:22] Christ.
[1:26:26] It is not a real to the majority of
[1:26:28] God's children. It is just a good verse
[1:26:30] in the Bible. [music] But we need mean
[1:26:32] need but say but we need to have it made
[1:26:34] alive to us.
[1:26:38] That will take a revelation. Amen.
[1:26:42] All hearts minds clear
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; saints. This is who you are.
[1:26:51] You will fall. This will fall. But
[1:26:53] remember, this [music] isn't you.
[1:26:55] Separate yourself from your flesh.
[1:27:00] Do you see with your flesh or is there a
[1:27:03] spirit? Is there a soul in the inside of
[1:27:05] you looking out of these eyes?
[1:27:08] Bible says what? The eyes are the window
[1:27:09] to the soul. The real you is in here.
[1:27:13] Look past this. Husbands, look past
[1:27:16] [music] your wives. Wives, look past
[1:27:18] your husband flesh. Brothers, look past
[1:27:20] your sister's flesh. Sisters, look past
[1:27:21] your brother's flesh.
[1:27:23] Don't get caught up on the veil. This is
[1:27:26] just a veil.
[1:27:30] This is just a temporary house.
[1:27:33] I'll tell you this, if you guys would
[1:27:34] come to my house, there's nothing fancy
[1:27:37] about my house.
[1:27:39] If you roll up in Grand Rapids, Ohio on
[1:27:42] 16791 niner, whatever it is, Wakanda
[1:27:45] Road, you pull up and your Google says
[1:27:48] you're at my house, you're going to see
[1:27:49] a little green [music] nasty house.
[1:27:55] The roof need I need a new roof. I need
[1:27:57] new siding. My roof leaks a little bit
[1:28:00] when it rains real hard.
[1:28:02] You say, "Man, Brother Simon's not a
[1:28:05] good guy. Look at the house he lives
[1:28:07] in." something wrong with him.
[1:28:11] You would be judging me by the house I
[1:28:14] live in.
[1:28:16] So, we can't judge each other by this
[1:28:19] [music] house we live in.
[1:28:21] We're dealing with 6,000 years of
[1:28:24] genetic problems
[1:28:26] in our strains. [laughter]
[1:28:31] Me and brother Jess. Got a little bit of
[1:28:34] Welsh, German, some Mexican, some feisty
[1:28:37] Mexican.
[1:28:40] Jess, they say the Apache warrior,
[1:28:43] right? A little patchy Indian going on
[1:28:45] right there.
[1:28:47] 6,000 years of your your forefathers,
[1:28:50] your foreathers,
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; the sins they committed, saints of God,
[1:28:54] waring still here, but we have a God
[1:28:56] that's greater. Amen.
[1:28:58] If you need prayer, saints, I trust this
[1:29:01] was a blessing to you. Remember,
[1:29:05] it was spoken.
[1:29:08] You are sinless. Accept who you are. I
[1:29:11] don't care what the devil tells you, you
[1:29:14] are sinless. Receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:16] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:29:18] Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we love you.
[1:29:21] Lord God, we just pray God you drop this
[1:29:23] revelation to this this bride [music]
[1:29:26] here. Lord, I believe every assembly has
[1:29:28] bride in it. We trust the majority are
[1:29:31] Lord Jesus. Lord, but Lord God, Lord, we
[1:29:33] believe, God, Lord, that your word is
[1:29:35] correct. [music] That the revelation you
[1:29:37] sent from Malachi 4, Lord Jesus, Lord,
[1:29:39] and then we see it hidden right laying
[1:29:41] right in the scripture, Lord, Lord, that
[1:29:43] your wife, the one that will see not see
[1:29:45] death, and those that have even gone
[1:29:46] before in past, Lord, are sinless, Lord.
[1:29:50] and Lord Jesus, Lord. But now, Lord, as
[1:29:52] we approach the rapture,
[1:29:54] there has to be a people, Lord, how can
[1:29:58] we receive a new body? How can we have
[1:30:01] faith to receive a new body if our
[1:30:04] hearts condemn us of s something, Lord,
[1:30:07] that we're not guilty of? Lord Jesus, we
[1:30:10] ask, God, you would go into the
[1:30:11] conscience of every believer here, God.
[1:30:14] And Lord Jesus, Lord, you we ask you
[1:30:16] would purge their conscience of any
[1:30:18] [music] sin, God. And Lord Jesus, I
[1:30:20] believe many here have the Holy Spirit
[1:30:21] God. And Lord Jesus, Lord, those who are
[1:30:23] still battling, God, Lord, we ask you,
[1:30:25] drop this thought to them, Lord, this
[1:30:26] revelation, God, make it plain. Make it
[1:30:29] real, Lord, to them, Lord Jesus. And
[1:30:31] Lord, may your Holy Spirit, [music]
[1:30:32] Lord, cleanse their minds. Cleanse their
[1:30:34] conscience, Lord. Give them a clean,
[1:30:35] pure one, Lord God, knowing, Lord, you
[1:30:38] covered it [music] all, Lord. Your
[1:30:40] precious blood, the Holy Spirit, the
[1:30:42] token, God has made a way. Lord,
[1:30:45] we love you, Lord. [music] Bless the
[1:30:46] people in the name of Jesus Christ. A.
