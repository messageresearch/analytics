you minister to us now by your spirit in Jesus Christ's name the church said may be uh seated by God's grace sister when you like to sing a special here for us yeah God bless it get a quick testimony um I had a Bible really really long time ago and it was really dead so I get a second Bible but I wasn't taking good care of it all the most of the tab is off which means part of the scripture is being ripped off from it too so I needed to replace my Bible I've been looking around for a long time and you get used to your Bible so you really just want the same Bible um after months of searching I couldn't find anything I finally Tuesday I went to the bookstore and got a Bible and I was like okay I guess this is going to be my Bible and I about the tap and everything I'm like okay I'm going to be serious I'm going to start using it but while I got home after Tuesday um I was just in my heart I'm like Lord I really want my same Bible and I walk right to my bookshelf and open the package and there was the exact same Bible that so I actually bed like an extra one but but then like for me it was awesome because it was not a coincident because the very second that when my heart I'm like I really wanted it and God blessed me with it so I want thanks so praise God this is my desire to you Lord with all my heart I worship [Music] you all I have within me I give you praise all that I adore is in you [Music] Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I live for you I long every breath that I take every moment I'm awake Lord have your way in me Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul I live for you along every breath that I take every moment I'm aake Lord have your way in me this is my desire to honor you Lord with all my heart I worship you all I have within me I give you praise all that I adore is in you Lord I give you my heart I give you my soul oh I live for you alone every breath that I take every moment I'm away Lord have your way in me have your way in meall [Music] [Applause] amen praise God all I want to do is love Bling That by God's grace get right into the word all I want to do is love him so glad I feel his love for me Jesus Paid the price of Redemption on the cross of C [Music] B so every day my heart will praise him I know I'll never be the same all I want to do is love him love his whole one more time praise God Amen oh all I want to do is love him glad I feel his love for me Jesus Paid the price of Redemption on the cross of calary every day my heart will praise him never be the same all I want to do is love him love his holyy name praise God let's take our Bibles let's stand on our feet here tonight by God's grace I think what I'll do is I'll just we'll continue with the preeminence in our daily lives I think I might as well I just want to finish this and then Lord willing we'll move on to um maybe back to the church age book on uh Wednesday night by the grace of the Lord I've surely been enjoying that church age book my just what a what a time reading through it you know slowly reading through a book over and over again really pulling a lot out of it but uh tonight I think I'll I'll finish this because I only have about you know 30 or some slides and it'd be great to finish this thought here so for our text I kind of want to um go to Romans 14 uh because we're be dealing with the technology part he kept hitting on technology you know and Facebook and stuff so I want to go back over this again a little bit by God's grace it's helped me you know and I'll share a little bit about my my testimony to and just you know how you try to stay on top of things you know um you try to stay try to keep everything in a subjection to the word of God and we're all constantly EMB battling that balance you know so Romans 1419 let's read 141 19 20 and 21 we'll read those three scriptures um this will just get this just gives us you know uh the scripture about we need to focus on building people up and not offending people once be like I was telling brother Austin you know uh once we become Christians you know once we fight off all the Demons of of Our Lives then we get in church and then Satan tries to make us have wars in the church first we're fighting everybody outside the church just to get saved right get in the church and then once you're in the church you got to love everybody in the church remember God won't let you into his family until first you got brotherly kindness to treat his his family the right way because brotherly kindness is the last step before charity so you got to treat the body right as your brothers and sisters and then he gives you charity when he can trust you with that so Romans 14 uh 1920 and 21 and if you haven't listened to brother gab's message I think you'll really be blessed by it um Romans 14:19 if you're there say amen amen let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things where with one may edify that means build up or strengthen another for meat destroy not the work of God all things are in need pure they're dealing with Christians who would eat meat and someone but is evil for that man who eateth with offense so when you make somebody weak or offend them because of what you're doing in your freedom and liberty in Christ it's evil that's sin when you cause somebody to stumble it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything so he says anything at all anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak verse 22 hast thou Faith have it to thyself before God happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth so don't purposely do something if you're condemned on the inside don't condemn yourself you know don't don't try to do something and you feel condemned already verse 23 and he that douth is damned if he eat so if you have any doubt or any condemnation don't do it because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is what sin we must have faith or a revelation as substance that we feel we're doing the right thing at all times and I want to apply that of course I'm I'm going to start with family then go to technology and complacency he end kind of ended with complacency and I want to uh look at that just a little bit by God's grace here tonight so let's bow our heads you have a need on your heart just make it know unto God as we get into the word of God Heavenly Father we're here to become better Christians we're here to see our weak spots our faults Lord I just pray you'd help us Lord God help me to be a humble servant Lord help me to be your true servant help me to be a vessel that you can use to speak to your children may the the Saints here the congregation Lord Feast on the word may they uh be fed Lord may they pull from your gifts and your spirit to receive what they have need of may we come here to focus on bettering ourselves Lord God how can we be better Christians help us Lord I pray and just help me to be a true servant in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen God bless you being seated here I want to start with um like I said family then I'll work my way into uh technology and then um I want to close with that complacency and I think it'll be an hour let me set a timer here so I I I don't go over I can hard tell my throat's hurting already but uh praise the lord it's it's worth it brother Ram said you know that's all we can dedicate to God you know we we'll be happy with that I'll give my voice to God so uh let's let's uh look at some quotes from Ali whenever you're ready buddy we can switch over and get some scriptures up here by God's grace so I want to go back to the family and uh and I just want to read those quotations that we didn't get to um great let's do this here and uh we read about sister Rebecca brandom bless your soul uh let's start with um this did we get to this okay yeah we got to that all right let's start with that apron profit and uh and again this encourages you know the husbands to take an active role in the home you know I know numerous men that they don't do one thing at home you know and they they don't have to uh by scripture uh but I think they ought to at times you know they ought to just like brother Brandon so let's look at this here and then we'll get into the little more on the children and then um look at the technology so brother Bram said there was some raging Maniacs outside of his house at when at this particular time when before he put the apron on there was raging Maniacs ever ever meet a raging Maniac but they hung around brother Ram's house uh and they were saying it reverently a bunch of sometimes Fanatics running back and forth through the house brother Ram's own house saying the Lord said this the Lord said if I ain't your manager the Lord said this now if the Lord wouldn't talk to me about that if he had something to say but you can't help it it's just in the human line now look they've got people running in the house and brother br's not in the house right now got Fanatics that sister Le MAA must have let in and they're running around saying the Lord told me this the Lord told me that can you imagine that in your house sisters can you imagine that and uh MAA said the children has had nothing to eat and I don't know what to do can you imagine that people prophesying in your house and the kids haven't eaten she don't know what to do well I thought now there's just one thing to do now I'm tired brother says I'm tired but I'm going to do this so see what is that a sacrifice when you don't feel like doing something but you make your body what a Living Sacrifice so you think your home's a a circus sometimes what about this I mean you think you got trials what about this he said now heavenly father in my heart you help me to be what you would have me to be on this scene so he doesn't even know what exactly what he just knows there's chaos people are trying to be spiritual and the children are playing he said later says Joseph's banging so loud on the the drums they can't hear nothing you know and I thought now if I can just get her quiet speaking of his wife so I said Sweetheart would you rush out with me for dinner oh I'd have to clean up for the children this and that and you could hardly hear yourself thinking little Joseph beaten the floor as hard as he could so I slipped over and got on an apron can you imagine that the apron prophet and I put it around me and I began to help her and I said honey you know what I saw the prettiest dress the other day I just so wanted to get it for you and it was in a certain city just here close and we'll go get it and all the time in my heart praying Heavenly Father quieten this dear little woman so he's praying while he's having these conversation you ever had that you know you're in the midst of a battle something on the inside's got to be leading you to pray we got to we got to just we got to cast down the tiredness how many could say Lord help me with my tiredness help me to cast down tiredness or my anger or whatever's going on this Fanatics raging Fanatics M Maniacs in my house Mercy I've got to cast that down I've got to ignore that and I've got to pray while I'm helping out my family that's I think that's Christian maturity that's where we want to get to right in the midst of all the noise in the midst of anything going on help me to pray while I help and I put my hand on her not knowing her not knowing what I was doing I say yes honey oh it was beautiful oh Lord quiet this little woman so he's kind of laying hands on her praying and just kept on you know what was I doing I was projecting or creating a different atmosphere walk in the love of God have Fellowship I've done this in my classroom I've walked into my classroom at indoor recess and they're all loud and everything like that and the children will run up to me and say well so and so did this so and so and the Bible said if you have a soft answer it turns away wrath and I can feel it and I'm walking in the spirit I can feel when I start answering nicely back you can feel the whole atmosphere of the class change and all those recess monitors come to me and say these children in this school are pretty pretty loud but your classroom is different Mr Smith now not always you know because I'm human too but I know for a fact when I'm in there and I'm walking the spirit and I'm projecting Divine love and I'm and I'm praying in my heart help these children to not tattle on each other so much Lord help them just to be diligent workers I can feel it it's an atmosphere and so we got to bring that to the home now let me tell on myself a little bit I would say this just just so you know I'm a man I'm I'm a man like everybody my biggest weakness at home is I get tired at home and I get kind of cranky and just I get quiet because I and my watch will tell you too I burn a lot of calories on Sunday I stand up a lot of hours on Sunday I almost have very little and then I work all day Monday and so when I get home Monday I get to the table I'm just sometimes happy just to get to the table and eat supper and so I that's one of my biggest weaknesses I I pour out myself so much on Saturday studying I'm here at the church praying reading you studying and then Sunday give it all out and Monday I work and like I said Monday Tuesday I need God's grace on those days and I appreciate your prayers but let me tell you that's one of my biggest weaknesses and that's what I told you this morning I want to be more connected to my children I love them I try to live a Godly life for them I try to give them gifts and take them out to eat and give them sugar treats and you know I try to just show them as much love as I can I hug them and kiss them every night but one thing I could work on is this when I'm tired to still create a loving atmosphere instead of being short with my children or my wife says sometimes you know we've talked about over the years when I get tired and cranky if I'm not careful I get cranky I get short with people well with my own children my own family that's where brother Jesse needs God's grace because I save up all my energy to preach and serve God and love God and I love my family but if I'm not careful I'll let that tiredness uh have preeminence and I gotta let the Holy Spirit have preeminence even when I'm tired so I hope you understand that I'm telling on myself today I'm just a man I need God's grace too and I can see areas where I I need goals I need to set a more a better desire to really try to live above my tiredness or maybe rest more whatever you know whatever I got to do uh that's what I got to do by the grace of the Lord so let me tell I'm gonna tell myself a few more times tonight if that's okay uh so you know I'm human brother Braham did it and that's why we love brother Braham so much is because he was he showed us he was just a man right you know we could relate to him we can like here we can understand he was tired he didn't want to do it but he still did it anyway and a few moments she got quiet and then when she got quiet Sarah and Becky divide up the play blocks Joseph got him something to play with and there was peace in the home what was it projecting love they were mine my children my wife and I was God look what he says I was God coming what anointed by God to change the atmosphere and then God giving his spirit and through that spirit with love to my family Sovereign Grace come in and quiet the family it'll do it I know it will and now this app applies to everywhere this applies to the church the Holy Spirit can bring peace to the church right in the service the Holy Spirit can bring peace on the job to your home wherever you know your personal life that's what we need the holy spirit for praise God to change the atmosphere all [Music] right and it will always do that it will always change the atmosphere if we can just get in tune with the Holy Spirit and I I found this even yesterday when I was you know had a Bible study I could feel the atmosphere I started just talking about Jesus and pretty soon I start crying and praising the Lord and testifying to different one you know yesterday at Denny's like I was telling you it was a real wonderful time and just praising the Lord and I just could feel the atmosphere changed you know it was really special and uh we don't try we're not like planning to do that but we need to be aware of that you know what I mean we need to be aware that okay when we see this is getting little worldly let's bring it back to Christ it's getting little In the Flesh let's get back to the Holy Spirit somebody change the atmosphere somebody give a testimony somebody start praising the Lord somebody start talking about Jesus you know somebody start talking about the sermon the song special or something like that and God will help us to do that now that works in our home like I said works at the church works everywhere and remember this I'm just going to read this now does that black okay let me read this first but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant so look what he did Brother bam comes in to be the servant all right he's tired he he's not really required by scripture to keep the home his wife is but he sees a need and he can change that atmosphere all right and uh now look what does he become he becomes a servant and that's what we can do here we can serve here we can serve at the home but we want to serve God's people praise God now just I got a quick question this is that red on black does that offend people at all is that okay it's okay all right yeah it doesn't bother me but my wife said you know like in art that's really bad to put red on black because it's like a bull or something you know like it's like it's like red light is that right brother Lis does it bother you brother okay because I can go to allh if you want I just thought I'd asked because my wife tells me that uh but getting back to this these are redl words and we should say God how can I serve my family better how can I serve the church better how can I serve so and so better how many want to be servants the greatest among you will be the servant now it's not a competition to be the greatest but we should have the humility and say Lord I really want to serve remember serving is not doing what you want to do it's doing what someone else wants to do humble thyself in the sight of the Lord he'll lift you up but see brother Ram did that now that's the example for family now Bible wisdom for parenting I just want to go over this I may preach a little more on this uh but remember uh we must chasten he that spareth his Rod hateth his son he that loveth him chasteneth him be time so earnestly swiftly diligently early we got to early uh discipline our children and chasen them and then we read this one because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil uh foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction shall drive it far from him the rod and reproof give wisdom look at that a rod gives wisdom right now I don't have the scriptures up here but I preached on um I preached on how the the brain is transformed uh two years ago I preached on that in 2015 and I'll just try to summarize it um before you make decisions all decisions are made from your frontal cortex right your human Spirit right here it's right behind your forehead that's why the Bible said when it's when you get filled with the holy spirit it's like he's putting a mark on your the the part of your brain that's for judgment and decision making okay um but what happens is there's a little waiting period I forget the name of the I think it's hypothalamus if I'm I'm not mistaken there's a little waiting period there in your brain before you make the final decision okay uh but when but when pain is involved uh uh and when uh when correction is brought with pain a new a new pathway forms in your brain I'm just gonna kind of very very I'm just gonna summarize it very much because I don't I don't want to go to it right now but this is what the Bible says and basically what I'm saying is that science is finding out what God already put in his Bible 4,000 years years ago when you bring the rod it uh it it uh I'm sorry did I get the wrong scripture No it drives it far from him okay oh it brings wisdom that's where I was going yeah with the wisdom it gives wisdom so it gives you a new pathway uh and you will uh and the child or you know will be able to have a new pathway a new understanding so before they make the wrong decision again they already have a new pathway saying oh this is the right way to go this is the way of wisdom and so science is constantly finding out what God has already placed in his word amen so some type of a punishment gives a child an experience and they remember from that experience and if they're trained up that will will give them wisdom and give them a new pathway uh a new way to kind of just fall into obedience is I guess what I'm trying to say but a Child Left to himself sent away bringeth his mother to shame now I've talked to different individuals that their parents treat them like this whenever they do wrong they just send them away they say get out of here in instead of taking time to talk to them and correct them they just said get out of here and like brother Gabe said he said people that he's talked to recently say oh just uh have an hour of YouTube time and just get away from me you see that isn't that awful they and they send their children away and said I want to talk with them and help them and be with them and the Bible said that's that brings parents to a shame so see we don't want to send them away we don't want to uh leave them to themselves we want to go through life with them I asked brother timy Kimmy a long time ago when I first start a pastor how do you get your children you know to serve God like that and he said well it's it's got It's election he said but we just made an effort to always do everything together no matter what we did do it as a family and I've tried to apply that to my life as well like I can take my children if I go to the store if I go here to the church I brought Malachi at the church here a couple Sun Saturdays ago we can do some things together whatever we do we try to do it together praise God but see don't send them away don't separate yourself use it as a learning experience now try to move on now we know Proverbs 22:6 train up a child the way he should go when he's old he not depart from it and Hebrews 12:9 furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence so see correction uh produced reverence the rod produces wisdom right so the same thing it's the same idea a physical punishment produces reverence and uh there I think a lot of people get away from the rod don't they now there's a way to abuse your children we don't want to do that there's a way to do it the right way and that's what we try to do by God's grace the way brother BR made it sound like so sometimes he might have got abused the way he said he got beaten all the time I I'll read those in just a moment um but Paul's saying if we corrected and or were corrected by our Earthly parents and gave them reverence how much more should we respect God and this is this is my prayer too I hope if you can understand this the right way I want to be able to recognize when God's correcting me for my wrongs I think that's what I think we all need and I think I need that like I want to recognize if something bad happened to my life it's because of this I failed to obey the Lord that's what I want to get better at that's another goal of mine to overcome my tiredness create atmosphere of love and not just kind of make it through the night because I'm so worn out and create atmosphere of love and then also to be able to recognize when God is correcting me I want to be able to do that now here's what brother Bram said Chason did you ever have any of it child training bringing you up giving you a little protoplasma stimulation so it's spanking once in a while by the gospel you know making you correction my daddy was awful good at that yes sir he believed in the Golden Rule it laid up over the door and had all the Ten Commandments out on it a Hickory Stick about that long brush on the end of it I tell you that may discipline the brand home but we love him what would we have been if it hadn't if Dad hadn't done it that's the way God is he brings discipline to his children trying them whipping them when they're wrong I'm happy now look I'm happy how many are happy that my heavenly father gives whippings to those who are wrong and corrects me when I'm wrong gives me whippings makes me straighten up walk like you should amen I want God to that's I I honestly say that I want God to whip me until till I'm straightened out till I'm I'm really walking right before the Lord I don't want to fail this Grace I don't want to be foolish virgin I want to be wise virgin I want to walk in the light the fullness of the light and he said I'm happy when I get spankin from God Amen and like my prayer is God just help me to recognize that help me to recognize that and not put it on the devil well the devil's G me the spanking I want to know if it's from the devil or God I want to know if I did something wrong amen and brother I had all 10 of those Commandments across my back and up and down my legs look at see I'm telling you you got spanked a lot pretty near every day it done me good though now look arms legs back I never got spanked on my back I only got spanked on my bottom as far as my dad but look he got it on his arms his legs his back but it produced a real good man of God didn't it I'm not telling you to hit your children like that I'm just saying I'll tell you a pot took me out behind the house and I danced a little jig but I know not to do it again the next time see he know he got the knowledge he got the wisdom the rod will give the child wisdom there would be a whole lot better life if we had some more daddies to do that today he never struck me one look or lick but what I honor him tonight for it when I looked in the casket I seen his gray hair on the side of his head I stood there and tears Dro down upon his face and I said Daddy I help put them there God help me that's right I respected my daddy he was a daddy that would make me do right yes sir we need more like that today ain't that great look at this look how he viewed it later on he's a 50 what year is this 1962 so he must be uh you know he must be like 50 uh 53 years old looking in there and I thank him for I honor him for every one of those weapons some people say they don't believe in spanking them but you know the scripture says if you spare the rod you spoil the the Sun so I believe in correcting children making them mine if we had more of that wouldn't have too much juvenile delinquency all right now I could do more on parenting but that's all I prepared for today so let's go down now this where it's going to get everybody here by God's grace I mean I should say it's going to help everybody let me say that and here's where I'm gonna tell myself a little bit okay so uh let me review what he said we have the Bible and the message apps on our phones brother Gabe was saying but which app gets click the most I thought that was good good and I rearranged my phone recently I put the Bible at the very front at the top um but really I don't use my phone a whole lot for the Bible I just use the literal Bible but it really helps it Bible studies you know or times I'm look or texting people scriptures really helpful but that's not my main Bible this is my main Bible amen um and then YouTube he said YouTube is a web and now how many can say Amen to this I can say Amen to this it sucks you in because it makes you curious oh I wonder about this video I wonder about that wonder about that wonder about that and pretty soon you're giving all your time to watching and he said the he said a preacher called it the message Believers TV is YouTube and that's true and he said having a phone in your pocket can make you a reality TV star in your own mind because you glorify yourself I want to talk about that little bit uh Facebook internet Etc is not wrong if you use it right just like the newspaper and yeah he had a good balance at the end too none of those things are wrong if you just use it the right way now let me tell a little bit on my uh on myself okay so just bear with me here I'm gonna tell I'm gonna tell myself if you think any less than me please pray for me um I was spending too much time on Facebook recently and uh like for example in the morning I would just wake up and to wake myself up I would just kind of go through okay what's going on today who's got birthdays today you know just to kind of wake up because I'd be so tired um and I started praying about I started realizing wow I I just lost 15 minutes there and you can easily uh do that and so I started praying about it feeling convicted and then I realized oh yeah I can block a lot of and then I started getting convicted about some of my friends posting stuff and this thought came to me what are these people adding to your spiritual life these friends and so I started unfollowing they're still my friends so they can see my stuff um so I got caught in a rut of that maybe for a month or two or whatever more and then I took off the notifications on Facebook so I don't see the red notifications come up so it doesn't make me want to open it and now like today I checked it for like five minutes this morning I'm done so I want to tell you God gave me a lot of Grace to get victory in that area okay because I was felt I was feeling addicted to Facebook Okay um the second thing this is probably more humbling okay so forgive me uh but last year and for a few years I started watching a lot of sports highlights like on NFL and NBA so like on Sunday nights I would go home I'd pray with my children and I sit there I just kind of just relax and I'd say well I'm tired I just want to see how the football games went today so I'd watch a four or five minute highlights of all the games well that wasn't good because it got me got my mind more on it later more and more and then that was last fall okay I'm sorry two Falls ago the fall of 2015 and the spring of 2016 um the Cavaliers started doing good and I'm going to tell my myself in the mornings ID wake up and when they have games just to wake myself up I'd watch their highlights and then I started watching like every morning then and then every morning and every morning and I got so convicted and it would last you know five minutes but then it it wouldn't stop after that then I want to watch the highlights of another game so I'd spend 15 20 minutes sometimes in the morning waking myself up and I just got in the bad habit of it uh and I got so convicted when last May I went out and preached and min Minnesota you remember when I went out there and you we had some tremendous meetings but after the Sunday night service here's what I prayed I was so convicted I got on my face and I was crying saying God please take this from me because every morning every morning every morning now I would after that I would read my Bible I have my coffee I would pray but I just felt like a slave to it and at that meeting on that Sunday night meeting I prayed with tears on my eyes I said Lord I'm going to make a wow if you'll let the Cavaliers win the championship I will not watch another highlight in the morning and they had not woned they've never won a championship up to then and just a few weeks later they won the championship I made that vow and by God's grace one time I slipped up a few weeks ago you I was just looking at I was flipping through my phone in the morning and I just started watching a video and I stopped it right away but since then that was June July August September October November December January we're almost in February seven months God has given me Grace I kept my word to the Lord amen and that's just a humble example I just said Lord I just want to would you please just allow them to win so I can just stop being interested and God answered my prayer so I've told on myself three times tonight that was the last one by God's grace but I want you to let you know that that uh the phone is not something I always battle but there are times when I have and these have been the times I battled Facebook and then sports highlights because I was in the sports a lot me to uh um never you know I never go into anything evil or anything like that but those Sports and the Facebook got me I just want to tell you I got victory over him by God's grace through US humble prayer repentance and then just changing changing some things changing my heart guarding my heart more praise God anything we do for God praise the Lord then God God uh God sees our efforts okay all right so I want to make sure I told you my battles because I I I'm I'm human I have battles too all right but let's read this now let me uh start reading some quotes to balance this out and how much time do I got okay I got 34 minutes plenty of time good praise the Lord Brother Gabe did a good job balancing it but this is the quote I always read when people ask me what do you think about Instagram what do you think brother BR I think television will curse the world what do you think about it well whoever wrote it I agree with you they made it a curse to the world it could be a blessing but they made it anything like that my dear people is what you look at yourself if a television's a curse then the newspaper's a curse then the radio is a curse then your smartphones a curse right and many time the telephone is oh sorry let me go back see it's what you make of it so brother they brother bam tells us anything can be a curse I think I told you this my dad one time went to church and he and he he left our church that we were raised in and told my my wife or my mom sorry my mom um and said honey they or darling they made Honey I Shrunk the Kids and candy bars sin so I guess the sermon must have included Honey I Shrunk the Kids was a TV a movie that came out when I was a boy I remember it because we went to see it at the drive-in and the pastor must have made that a sin and he said they must have made snicker bars a sin because something got preached about that um but that's true those things can be now of course we know the movies are sin but a Snicker bar of itself isn't a sin unless you make it an idol right you know if you make food to Idol you know if you you know what I'm saying is that we must have the discernment and we must have let me say this we must have the power over all these things we must control Facebook we must control if you have a TV what comes over across that and especially your tablets and computers you've got to control what what comes over there if not you don't have the character yet to handle it got to have the character so see anything can be a curse unless we handle it and we rule over it like we talking about Kings and Priests we must rule over all these things by God's grace now look what the Bible says unto the pure all things are pure this is the scripture that we would talk about Facebook's okay internet's okay newspaper okay all these things are okay as long as that's a pure thing for you but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled so when I was struggling with Facebook this was this was a this defiled me because I didn't didn't have any confidence toward God God I just lost all that time I lost all that time this was defil in me but I prayed and God helped me to get victory over it you understand what I'm saying but now it's a pure thing now I use it now it's pure it doesn't cause me to stumble it doesn't come before God you know it doesn't get more time than God it's in its right place see but even their mind is conscience is and conscience is defiled so you know you're walking pure before God when your your conscience isn't defiled you don't feel bad about whatever you're allowing okay in your conscience I'm I'm lording over this I'm ruling over this as a king or priest I've got control of this this is not controlling me I'm controlling it and here's our scripture so everything this is our text we must always try to edify others and that's what I'm gonna say with Facebook or with Instagram if your posts are not edifying people you edified the wrong thing it's not made to argue we're not made to argue politics on Facebook we're not supposed to argue at all the Bible says everything we do should build people up all right everything Snicker bar whatever whatever you're talking about TV monitor whatever you tablet it's got to edify other people whether it's an app or whatever more it's got to edify but if we're offending people then it's evil what we're doing it's evil um and so that's why I want to bring that scripture and he Saidi will not do anything whereby somebody stumbles or is made weak I never want to make somebody fall in their Christian walk with God okay we don't want to make anybody stumble that's why I was telling brother Austin I know he just stepped out but he asked me about drinking wine I said yes if you want to drink wine in the privacy of your home I could see that maybe because you know Paul told Timothy drink a little wine for your stomach's sake but I'm a pastor and people look at me and I have to be the example I could but really don't even care to drink wine that whatever more I mean but you never want to do anything that would cause anybody to stumble you'd have to use it for the right reasons you know some people but I certainly don't believe in Social drinking brother BR tells us the evils in that because right along with that is automatic weaknesses and offenses well Adam's a Christian he drinks sister Wendy she's a Christian she drinks publicly he he drinks at Red Lobster P Pastor Jesse drinks uh at Giant Eagle on Sunday nights I can too and they'll take and run with that and you're the cause of it or I'm the cause of it and we don't want to do that so I feel like if somebody ask me do you drink at home it's the best thing to not do it at all because how do I know somebody don't have an alcohol problem right if you can control it fine but don't tell people about it okay because I just met alcohol alcohol alcohol addicted man recently and we don't you don't want that demon because of that alcohol he's literally seen demons in his in his his life literally and he's telling me that with almost tears his eyes are watering up and so now he can't even sleep in the dark he's got to sleep with lights on because of the alcohol or the demon of alcohol so don't tell me church it's not it's very serious and we never want to cause anybody to stumble or make anybody weak all right so happy whenever we do some something we should be happy about I should be able to happily show Wendy my Facebook page or happy to show on my Facebook page or if I post something on I don't I'm not on Instagram but if I am I'm happy to show you this post I shouldn't have to hide this from anybody I should have such faith that this is the right thing to post I could show it to anybody all right and we must do whatever we do it we must do it in s in in in faith or it's sin now let me stop right here it's okay every now and then to post something about food or something fun you do because you got to be human there's got to be a balance to that brother there's pictures of brother Ram out hunting where he's just joking and laughing around with the brothers they're they're they switch their hats they're just being silly and all the people that know brother brandom said he told a lot of jokes and pranks when he was out hunting we got to let people be humans praise the lord we got let them just laugh and but we got to be careful not to let that turn into sin but there's it's okay to let off the pressure it's okay you know to to be human as well but we can't cause people to be weak or can't cause them to stumble well well because you did because you drank I can go get drunk no that's not how it works we got to be very careful got to let people be human we and laugh you gota jokes you know you got clean jokes that's fine but you can't let it go too far all right now the same thing is repeated in Corinthians you probably know this I preached on this a few years ago take heedless by any means this Liberty of yours is a stumbling block to them that are weak as Christians we have Liberty you know we can uh like I said we can do Facebook or we can do TV or whatever you want to do but we cannot cause people to get weak because of what we do for If any man see thee which hath knowledge sit at me in the idols Temple now let's pause right there some of the Christians in Corinth would go into the Temple of an idol let's say Diana or let's say some uh Zeus or something like that I don't know the names of them anymore Mercury or whatever some of the Christians would just for a meal to buy some meat they would go into the Temple of an idol and sit in there and the new Christians would look and say well he's in a pagan Temple that's satanic that's demonic and it would cause them to stumble so Paul says he said if if they see you with knowledge of God in a ID Temple of an idol shall not the conscience of him which is weak be embold to those things which are offered to idols and through your knowledge the weak brother perish or for whom Christ died don't you see that you have knowledge said that meat doesn't cause anybody stumble now we can apply this to bars today can't we what if I see you and I go out I go to Applebees and you're sitting at the bar by a bunch of friends and they're all drinking and there's all this rock and roll ACDC Metallica on and a new Christian walks in there say hey there's brother Jesse he's at the bar and he's laughing with his friends and he's have a boy night out which I don't do and I would not do but that's the that's the parable we get today well he's eating me and but it's in there's nothing wrong with the meat there's nothing wrong with his meal but he's around he's in the wrong atmosphere and that would cause well if a pastor did it well then I can do it too I'll go down to Luigi's or I'll go down to whatever bar you I don't even know any bar names Mercy that's good though but you understand and through your knowledge you cause them to perish and let's say they fall out of the the faith now look what happened to you you call somebody stumble and they leave they leave the faith I don't want to be the now remember Jesus can't lose one that's his own but I don't want to be the cause of anybody because my weakness or my my ignorance I don't want to cause anybody to fall away I want to stand true as a Christian example and if they leave let them leave because I'm living holy not because I'm uh I'm trying to take some Liberty or something like that but let them re re uh let them leave because I'm standing on Holiness not because I'm causing them to stumble all right because when you sin so against the Brethren and wound their weak conscience you sin against Christ and we don't see that's a sin that's literally a sin that's why brother Austin I was saying you were you stepped out that's why I don't drink at home because if somebody found out I drink wine at home or something like that uh they would they'd fall but I don't even want to drink at home really I I I don't I know there's a danger there I I just don't want to do that uh we never want to cause anybody to stumble we always want to make sure people can look at our lives and get strength from us my bro look at that brother Adam look at sister Bo look how they serve God oh that just makes me want to serve God too that's how we should live our lives amen sorry um wherefore now here's this is beautiful wherefore if meat makes my brother to offend so if me going and eating a steak at the bar causes somebody to offend I will eat no steak from the bar while the world stands lest I make my brother to offend while the world stands in other words so for the rest of my days on this Earth until Jesus Christ comes back I won't cause anybody to stumble and the church said praise the Lord so we gota we got to be aware of people you know around us and if they're kind of asking about our lives and if we feel there's a little questionable thing we got to be careful not to do it we don't want to cause anybody to stumble now he also preached on The Temptations of keeping up with the Joneses having brand new technology and things like that we got to be careful with that by God's grace then he started preaching on Facebook and yes and I want yeah let me just spend a little bit more time on this he said many people just project a Persona on Facebook so in other words they're putting something out there that's really not the reality uh we must make sure Facebook does not glorify our own life but the Life of Christ okay on Facebook The Joy or Focus can come from getting a lot of likes he said that last week remember that Facebook should not become glorification of self without no dying out or no humility okay and and that's a challenge on social media it's a challenge um and so if you have questions about that you know you can ask somebody to look at it I'll look at your Facebook page or I'll look at whatever you do on social media but there's I want to say this we are not supposed to put our bad parts out on Facebook we're not supposed to put our dirty laundry on social media are you with you understand that you don't want to put your dirty laundry in the church you don't want to come and gossip and tell everybody well boy we had a really awful day yesterday and so and so to this and people get hurt when you share their faults what if I came in here saying you know my wife did this CH saints come on my wife then she did this then she said that then she I mean that would destroy her what if she came and say he he's the pastor but I'll tell you what he did yesterday oh my you see brother bam said try to hide people's faults and that's in the scripture too that's in Proverbs I don't have in front of me me but I know I've preached on that before do all you can do to hide people's sins because that's what God does Amen to hide a multitude of sins amen so see there's an aspect of that Facebook we're not so for me Facebook is a u it's a tool to keep in touch with family it's a communication tool and that's why I love it because I can shut off anybody who's against the word I can just shut them off done and I can just see things about the word and my family members but now with you family members have they don't put everything good on there now I just see less of that see less of that and pretty soon if they don't stop stop I just cut them off all together and then it becomes for me where I can share about my family like yesterday yesterday I put a picture of my brothers and I I put a scripture at the top and my brothers how I got to preach last weekend and be with my brothers how how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity amen so I always try to have something positive on there something positive so my family can keep uh keep up with us that's what we try to do I'm not trying to glorify myself for My Lifestyle uh but I'm trying to keep in touch with my family because I like keeping in touch with my family I never get to see them I miss them so I like to see the pictures of their children and the and what they're doing you know everything like that to me I don't think that's glorifying ourselves now if we're putting out if we're bragging about how much we pray on Facebook if we're bragging about how much we give on Facebook well guess what I gave $25,000 to the church this year my tithes and offerings well see now you went too far you're bragging about oh look at all the and I have friends have done this not in the message but Christian friends oh instead of giving gifts to our children this year we donated all that money uh to some charity and we went and packed up all these bags now look Church something they're supposed to do in private they just made public you see and I but I appreciate the fact that they wanted to do that but public bragging that see that's self- glorification and may let me give them the benefit of the doubt maybe they don't they don't know better than than to do that Al should be done in secret but I appreciate the desire right I appreciate the want to put something about Jesus on at Christmas time I love that I love that but we should have with with our message we should have more wisdom to kind of stay off of things like that now if you have any questions about what Facebook or Instagram or whatever you do uh be careful now I want to say this the last thing is we got to be really careful with our children how much access we give them in apps because one of those apps is like opening up a world of possib abilities for example Instagram I met numerous people come to me and say if you're on that it's good as long as you stay in your your connections whatever more but as soon as you type in the wrong you're searching for a keyword a world of evils opened up to you so we got to be extremely careful same thing with Facebook same thing with the Google search if you type in one word you can even type in good things and come up with evil we have to be very very careful in other words we've got to control it not it control us we've got to control if you see something evil close the page scroll up get run From Evil don't put up with it and church when that happens to me I just close my eyes and pray and say God forgive me I didn't want to see that forgive me right or if my eyes entertain it for a few seconds like a man you know you might be attracted and say God forgive me close my eyes and X out of it close right away forgive me because we're all human right and that's why brother R put the the cross in his car give me something to just help me to look away from that help me to look at Calvary praise God but especially with our children we must guard them with all that we have we must guard it with all we have okay I'm doing pretty good on time I got 18 minutes all right that should be plenty time yep plenty time for complacency and then he said he said he said we need a shaken we can't be complacent all right so our brother said that and remember uh let's look at this here and I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to put quotes in here that I was going to preach tonight if I was on the Ephesian Church age because that's exactly where we are in the Ephesian Church age uh leaving the first love so this this actually fit perfectly in with this and I was very blessed by that and we use the word conforming this morning right because that's from the scripture we're predestined to be conformed when the church thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially they change their manner of dress their attitudes and their behavior they get laxed that is what Ephesus means relaxed and drifting now let me just stop right here when we're conformed to the world we actually start sinning but if we still keep our Godly rules and standards uh then we're not sinning Let me Give an example like my brother Paul he uh he's into that hip look that's kind of trendy right all the hair is combed over tighter jeans you know but he still let me say like this he still dresses modestly and the jeans aren't too tight because we know we shouldn't show off our our forms right so he in my mind he's doing a pretty good job although he looks like a the trend that that's the trend now right the Hipster look and the plaid shirts and the whatever more I I don't know I'm not I'm not really in touch with all that but you can you can have uh and that and remember Styles change right they used to be big glasses in the 70s and they got smaller in the 90s and now they're going back big again Styles change but some of those things aren't sin but the trouble is is when we start conforming to the world and actually sinning like women you know with splits showing off their thighs or high heels or something like that or men you know showing off their body parts muscle shirts whatever you know anything lustful anything outside the word of God so that's I just want to make that differentiation you can still kind of go with the Fashions but still be holy okay but you got make sure you have to make sure you stop it and don't go into IM immodesty or immorality because that's just how the world is just goes into Fashions like right now the these these uh just for example right now the trend is tight pants well these are baggy because when I bought them that was the trend baggy pants really I mean really these are really baggy they're just you look at brother br's pictures they're not as baggy they're just a little bit thinner so you see but this doesn't change you know this is this isn't immodest it's still holy but the fashion changes a little bit right so I just want to make sure I say that just because somebody might be dressing like a hipster or you know I hope hope that doesn't offend people that doesn't necessarily mean they're conforming to the world they're just changing the style but when you start sinning and acting like the world or believing the things of the world and sinning well then then you're wrong then you are conforming to the world we must be con constantly conformed to the word so I just want you to see that now so see people get laxed or they get tired of the standards that we hold and that's what we got to be careful God help me not to get relaxed on God help me to maintain Holiness I me to maintain uh my seeking of you and help me not to get lacked spiritually okay now this is beautiful the cycle of Revival and death has never failed let's say never ready never this has never failed ever and you can see it all through the Bible all you have to do is recall the last move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians went to church prayed all night now I've never prayed all night but I have prayed with all my might I prayed for hours you know a couple times past hour you know longer than that I've never prayed all night but I prayed with all my might and I have sighed and cried for the Abominations done in this city and the and my family my my family that's not in the message of course so see just I want I just want you to know praying all night is not a Bible rule you know like the Bible never says you have to pray all night to go to heaven but brother bam obviously saw in history where Believers were so hungry for God they would pray a long time and I talk to people that have all night prayer services and a lot of people fall asleep during those services like they're trying to fulfill that they're trying and that's good I'm glad but you don't have to do that to go to heaven because then you become legalistic right but to want to experience it there's nothing wrong with that I'd probably be the first one that fell asleep unless I was preaching or singing Because I get real tired after a long day um so I'm just let's just balance that out by God's grace they took to the streets now we've done that by God's grace corners and weren't ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit amen they left their old dead churches amen and worshiped in homes Glory I've done that or in store buildings I've done that uh they had reality think about that some of us have I've left mega churches millions of dollars of I used to go to church with million and beautiful pipe organs and beautiful uh and I've willingly left that to go Worship in a old storefront with water coming down through the ceiling why because I got a reality amen I know what the word says I know what God does amen I see a dead lukewarm church and I know it is but I also see a Living Church as well you see and we're the so for most of us we're the first generation Holy Ghost filled Believers and that's what we're getting into it this never fails this cycle never fails he says they had reality but it wasn't too long till they've be getting get enough money to get fine new churches we have a fine new church here I love it but we can't get lack on God that's why I appreciate you coming out on a Sunday night God bless each and every on here tonight by God's grace because pretty soon if we everything gets new and everything goes good people start falling away they don't want to hear the word we got to keep feeding on the word because you know you need it and I know I need it too we got to stay in the word of God this will never fail he said they put a choir in instead of singing to God for themselves I love brother how he has this discernment choir can be a good thing but for most churches it just replaces and the so the people don't have to sing anymore they'd rather hear a good song than sing from the joy in their heart that's spiritual laziness they put gowns on the choir they organized a movement ran it by man they soon began to read books now for us watch YouTube videos that they weren't fit to watch or read they let down the bar see that's what I got with Facebook I started reading that and it got too much so I recognize that now God help us to recognize in all of our Lives me and if it happens in my life whatever is wrong in my life God help me to get it right they let down the bars and the goats came in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone no more joy the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with the form but the fire had died down in the Blackness of Ashes is about all that's left see so your your fire depends upon what you're reading and your joy and your freedom right remember false Doctrine enslaves you right you're not free you're slave by false Doctrine I don't want anybody slaved I just want you to be a slave to Christ tonight by God's grace not slave to Demons but a slave to Christ a prisoner to Christ amen amen and then your fire will keep on burning praise God Amen a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church begin to lose that first love of God for this is love of God that we keep his Commandments Glory one little deviation from that word that's what I was feeling with my Facebook and my my basketball videos one little de deviation from that word was a step away from Christ people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have an emotional time but he's not done but when it's all over look at this this is so beautiful watch and see if they are in that word so no matter how we act here spend some time with them away from church say hey can I hang out with you or can we do this together now not that you're spyed on somebody but just when you're around people watch how they act once they're done with all the emotion or whatever how they seem to be spiritual watch and see if they're in that word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story I want my life to tell one story this is my story this is my song Blessed Assurance praising My Savior all the day long amen I want my children to see me praising the Lord praising My Savior I want that my wife to see me doing that I want to be living exactly what I preach amen if not I'm a hypocrite and I need to be corrected I need to repent amen but by God's grace I'm not Hallelujah he said I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that what people being emotional being happy in church but living a different life before he died people saying they love God but not obeying his word oh Ephesian Church Something's Happened to you someone's trying to either add to the word or take from it but they're doing it so subbly that you can't see it they haven't made a move so big that you can see it out there in the open it's under the cover and they're bringing it by way of human reason I'm sorry reason of human understanding that'll take over unless you refuse it go back to what Pentecost before it is too late what's Pentecost repent right repent be baptized be filled with the Holy Spirit go back to the Holy Spirit then amen but as usual I just got a few I think just two more people don't heed God's warning that Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful and the manifestation of the spirit so blessed that a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth that we have what can we do to see this revival goes on that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize and set up your Creed or what you believe put it all on a church manual right we know Pentecost did this after 1906 at some point and they do it they organize they add to the word and they die just like Eve did for taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life and it's not what we say about the word that counts but it's what God Said Amen that beautiful now we got to make sure that doesn't happen to me churches the same thing happens brother Brandon had a Revival in his life well whatever whever we are with that we're what two generations after him I am at least by God's grace uh we have to make sure we have a first generation experience praise God a first generation experience God has no grandchildren praise the Lord and we know the cycle of death and Revival never fails so see what and and I'm looking like this I got to make sure my children get the Holy Ghost they cannot think they got it they have to either get it or no they don't have it praise God that's why in Sunday school from time to time we've had them write down where do they think they're at are they in justification or before that sanctification or baptism Holy Ghost and they always got it right at least from what I've seen in other words none of them have told me they're filled with the Holy Ghost because they've been taught that a holy ghost life looks like the Bible it's a life of power it's a life of hunger and thirsting for God it's a life of boldness you can live it before everybody praise the lord it's a life of virtue and knowledge and Temperance and godliness and patience and brotherly kindness amen it's life fill with that and every time I've asked the children they all Place themselves in the right spot either not even Justified or Justified I think one or two have done Sanctified but uh their life tells I want them to really know I don't want them to oh I believe brother BR is a prophet I already got the Holy Ghost no sir that's a good start but that's not brother B said you can he said in 1965 rising of the sun he said how many have sat here for years and listened to tapes and still not quickened by the Holy Spirit you can sit there and listen to tapes and sit and hear a prophet face to to face and still not be quickened it takes a full surrender it takes God uh working with you cleaning you out so he can fill you and put you in service amen he has no grandchildren we cannot add to the word we have to make sure that we keep ourselves on fire as well praise God I'm closing with this go to Acts chapter 4 this I shared this with brother Gabe on the text and this and I shared this with Craig one time too and he was really blessed by it too Acts chapter 4:23 and I'll get to in just a moment let me get my scripture here I want to read this and this is my last quote and this is my last scripture oh good I got five minutes left praise the Lord that worked out really good so the last thing he hit was complacency okay complacency we can't be complacent we can't be content where we are we've got to Hunger for More Of God and we realize Even in our own lives we go through Cycles right we go through Cycles um Cycles were really on fire and then cool off a little bit more on fire and but see it should be an upward cycle praise God it should be upward you know we're on the upward way like brother Gabe said we can't Plateau because he said that's a deadline I thought that was pretty good I like that we can't do that now in this next quote uh it's one of my favorite quotes in the church age book of course they're all great um but he's talking about the lyan church a saying we are are rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing we don't need any more God and let's read it now the leans are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all or they have enough yet is that the truth that so PE churches today will say we have all the word we've got enough of God he said is that true compare this 20th century Church to the first century church and isn't that what we're trying to do we're trying to compare what's our blueprint in the book of Acts we should be constantly comparing our church to the book of Acts he said go ahead do that where's the power and we've seen healings recently which we're very thankful for that God answering prayer you know just doing great things we're thankful for that by God's grace where's the love amen love where is the purified church I this is what I love that with stod sin and walked in faith toward Jesus see with an I'm talking about Anan and saf Peter just was so against sin that God smot them dead because they lied they tried to bring a lie into the church and God God knew they didn't want that so God smed him dead right there don't bring that lie in the church why they were purified they didn't want lies amongst each other they wanted truth where's the unity the unity of the Believers we're all just one big family where's the unity we all love each other you can't find it he says in the leosan church if this church this lean church has all it needs and have it all and we're just as good as the first church age then why were they why was the first church crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all see leoa says we have it all but the early church had it all but wanted more praise God Amen that's what I like see we have all the revelation of the word that we need for the Rapture but we should want more Revelation for every little detail of Our Lives now how will that manifest well he tells us you cry out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than what we have today a't that beautiful I love how see that's why I love how brother brand was led of the Holy Spirit to go right back to the word compare this church that says oh I have everything we got all the message we got all the word we got all the quotes we got and yet do they have the same cry for more that the early church had that's how you know which church is really on fire they want more of God that's why I said God bless you for coming out to the house of God tonight and this morning you know praise the Lord that's how I feel I just can't get enough of God Amen I battle his flesh yes I told you some my own faults but when it all boils down to it brother and sister I want more of God in my life I can't get enough of God I want more of him amen so let's read acts four then we'll have you stand after we read this acts 4:23 if you know the story the Saints got arrested they just was their actually their first persecution in chapter 4 uh Peter's brought before the Sanhedrin about the man the lame man who was healed and uh I think they just beat him and let him go if not or maybe they had a night in the prison uh I might have that mixed up but pardon me verse 23 let's read this and then we'll close and being let go so after this Sanhedrin Council basically arrested company reported all that the chief priests and Elders had s to them and when they had heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that's in us who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and why did the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up up and the rulers were gathered against the Lord and against his Christ now let's stop right there you see what they're doing they're applying the scripture from uh Isaiah 52 and 53 to their day the rulers of the world had risen up against them because now they got the Christ now they got the Holy Ghost amen they're looking in the scripture and saying my we're filled with the Holy Spirit we got the promise of God but now the earth and the kings of the Earth are starting to rise up against us amen so in other words they're finding themselves in the word of God how many you want to find yourself in the word of God tonight so see they recognize the word of God for our day we believe the report of Jesus Christ we believed he's the Messiah we believe he sent in the Holy Ghost and now we're getting persecuted amen verse 27 for of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has appointed or anointed I'm sorry but he's been appointed to anointed both with Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determin before to be done and now here here's the prayer they just got off they got off from being arrested and they come and have a big prayer meeting right I love it and brother man said this is what we should pattern after if not we'll get complacent we've got it all we got the message we're happy the way we are this is how we should respond to God when we go through trials we should come out of the trial wanting more of God and now Lord verse 29 behold their threats and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy words so they must the law some boldness so they pray say God grant it that we'll be all full of all boldness in other words restore our first love amen restore our first boldness restore our first Zeal for God Amen and the only been filled the Holy Ghost maybe a few months here who knows I don't know the exact time frame by stretching forth thy hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus praise God a't that beautiful they just get out of jail basically and they say Lord help us to have that first boldness that we had and stretch forth your hands and do signs Miracles and wonders amongst us and when they had prayed the place was shaken when they were all assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness so see they got the answer to their prayer they prayed for boldness and God gave them boldness amen God heard their prayer from heaven and I believe God will hear our prayers from Heaven as well let's stand to our feet by God's grace this is what brother Ram said with this quote if this church has all it needs and is just as good as the original Church well how come the original Church cried out for more of God and acted like they didn't have all they needed see we need to act like we don't have all that we need we need to act like we need more of God you see and that's a true sign you're a book of Acts Church you're not satisfied with well I gave my heart to the Lord I've been baptized Glory I'm just going to cruise into the Rapture that's not how it works uh this this got this flesh got to be crucified we can't get complacent like brother Gabe said we need shaken and we should pray that say Lord shake shake this church like you shook that church amen Shake us with whatever it takes to get us back to boldness back to believing and praying for signs Miracles and wonders praise God so let's take a moment tonight and let's pray for that by God's grace let's pray the same prayer they did this is such a beautiful prayer we cannot get complacent we must get uh more of God I'll say like that Hallelujah let me read that again Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus that was their simple prayer God grant unto us boldness now how many would say they need some boldness tonight more boldness my hand would be one of the first up now there might be something in there else that you need so think about your life let's just bow our heads for a moment think about your life because he they said grant that with all boldness we may speak your word you see they realize a real Holy Ghost F Church can't keep quiet brother ra said when you got real love in your heart you can't keep quiet about it you got to tell somebody about it so what would you desire tonight all boldness what else would you desire all Faith to move mountains in your life what else would you to desire all wisdom to make the right decision and let's ask God for that tonight let's just pray here now church I'm going to pray out loud you pray in your heart what you desire Heavenly Father Lord we come to the close thank you for the wisdom
