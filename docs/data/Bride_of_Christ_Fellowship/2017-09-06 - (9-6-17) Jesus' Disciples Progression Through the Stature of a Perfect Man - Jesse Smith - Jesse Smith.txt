[Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like to continue the for Sunday night which Sunday night you just looked at sanctification for the little children who the Bible study with the children they have to read a lot of verses I thought that was very wonderful got some good feedback on that few so I was happy those blessing but I just want to maybe choose one scripture I think it was let me get two real quick sigh don't miss Corder this one get to one scripture here about the disciples Luke 17 verse 3 that's why I went to Luke 17 verse 3:17 3 how many be happy to be announced the Lord tonight a man I've always David said I was happy when they said to me let's go to church Luke 17 30 phrase God and as my true heart's desire just to be in the house the Lord with his people praise God because that's the best place to be a men gathered with God's people Luke 17 3 verse 20 verses 3 4 & 5 if I had a title tonight I like to just call it Jesus's disciples progression through the statue of perfect man now that's a long title I think you know what I mean in other words the progress of how Jesus disciples were sanctified that was a thought that was so gripping me on Sunday and I was talking to brother Scott afterwards and I was like you know that's one of those studies I like to give more time to in preaching so that's all I couldn't get away from it all week I just studied on it day and night in the morning and night studying this so let's look at this here Luke 17 verse 3 would you okay thank you will pie read a couple verses together look at the shorter ones well let's just read them the last one together I'll read three and four and then we'll all read five together take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him so Jesus give you the license if somebody sinned against you you got a right to rebuke them amen Church you got a right to do it but you just want to do it the Bible said also sometimes you have to do it in meekness of sincerity praise the Lord and if he repent forgive him and if he trespassed against these seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying I repent he said thou shalt forgive him let's read verse five and the Apostle said unto the Lord increase our faith so they had faith correct but in order to be able to forgive their brother seven times in one day they said Lord I need more faith for that I don't have the faith I need to forgive Adam seven times in one day I don't know if I can forgive bang seven times in one day I need some more faith for that how many uh how many would like God to give them more sanctification praise God who else would like more faith I'd like more faith in my life you can always get more but we got to seek it as we saw in Sunday we have to seek those things that's just Bauer hasn't word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make an order to God as we pray father again we come in prayer Lord prayer so powerful it is the most powerful weapon you've ever given us so we take this slingshot of Prayer Lord God and we load it with the revelation you've given us the message of the hour and we fling it at the enemy Lord we come against the enemy in Jesus Christ's name hallelujah Lord may this prayer Lord defeat any foe in here tonight may defeat anyone livestreaming any any demon that's battling them may defeat the demon powers Lord Jesus and father anyone who watches on archival or may the power of this word Lord God go out and help your people all those who are hungry and thirsting for the righteousness of Jesus Christ tonight thank you oh we're such a privileged people to have a hunger to come to your house bless us now with that divine presence in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless she's mean see their praise God I've set my timer I'll just try to be an hour I've been trying to be faithful to that for my sake and for yours watch my health here so praise God okay so my purpose tonight is to continue this thought and give me a moment I'll just I want to go through this picture Malachi can you switch over here I just want to go over that little slideshow I showed on Sunday to the little children I just like to maybe go over that just briefly with you and then as we get into the new material or the new things I haven't preached you know that will be fresh by the grace of Lord okay we'll just quickly go through this Sunday we just took an hour I think we ended right at five o'clock I think we just had our Bible study we looked at what is sanctification its purification of your heart and life brother Graham calls it her purifying your daily habits right so you get rid of all your bad habits so God can fill you with the Holy Ghost so sanctification is the will of God before you receive the Holy Ghost but it continues even after praise God Jesus pray right before he was arrested and crucified he prayed sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth Paul said here it is the absolute will of God to be sanctified so people wonder what's God's will for this service well it's very likely that you get sanctified some more it's very likely that you and I get more purified amen and then verse that's nineteen five twenty three takes it to the rest of your life because it says that your whole body spirit soul be preserved blameless or sanctified until the coming of the Lord amen so we know st. vacation continues but it's so crucial because we know in this hour very few people are going to be born again so it's very crucial that we pay attention during sanctification messages that we make sure we're not deceived in this hour whether I am taught that you and I can know exactly where we are at any time I remember this quote we've been preaching on the church ages it's hard to see but this is actually bold in here it's hard to see that sorry you can know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time now what you may not know is that brother Branham knew exactly where he was with God how many one know where they are with God by God's grace here's our bow BAM says it brother Ram says in 1960 said because I have found the center of God's will he was off-center before and this time because he was putting too much emphasis on the discernment and God had to tell him stop putting so much discernment on the sorry emphasis on the discernment lines he said get back to praying for my sick children I don't remember that if you don't listen to that message if you don't he goes through the whole thing for years he put too much emphasis on prayer line I'm sorry too sir my discernment discernment and then God was saying you just get back to doing a few discernments and then ask the people to believe and then the faith of these few discernment should raise everybody's faith to receive their own healing get back to the Commission pray for God's sick children amen so he found himself at the center how many want to be at the center tonight I believe I'm at the center of God's will and I hope I hope everybody has that revelation for themselves how do you know because I prayed about it I've asked God for signs about it I've sought God for I've cried out to God for and God answers his children amen you might not have known this brother branham said he was at the center of God's will and then just three short years later because there's almost three years was even three four years he says by the help of God I'm directing the bride of Jesus Christ now all of us are behind but he was director praise the Lord he knew his position it wasn't off to the side or behind the scenes somebody's got to lead just like Moses with his staff brother Branham was out from the bride leading the bride amen I'm in the center of God's will and not only that in 1965 he said he got discouraged so he said I closed my eyes and said a prayer Lord help me to know where I am and let this Bible open up to find my position in the scripture glory and he said I put my scripture on his finger on a scripture Genesis 24/7 he said Ellie's were Abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the Bible being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac chills run over me he said sure that's right with the rest of my message pulling out the bride hallelujah so he knew it exactly where he was in the center of God's will I'm born again filled with the Holy Ghost I'm in the center of God's will with my with my gifts where I need to be I'm directing God's bride and I'm also hunting the rest of God's bride amen there was no wonder well where am i doing what am i doing now he's a 56 year old man here Church so that gives us hope right wait upon the Lord don't and most people here are guilty this I don't know anybody's guilty this here most of us are not gonna push ourselves into a gift right well I'm gonna push myself and I'm gonna make myself a preacher I'm gonna make myself a song leader I'm gonna make myself a deacon most of us aren't guilty of that here but what we need to do is keep seeking until we find the will of God we must not give up seeking we must keep seeking we must keep asking knocking we must stay on our knees how am I gonna stay on their knees amen till God answers that's real faith when you say on your knees til he answers Amen so we showed that brother Brad knew exactly where he was he was in the fivefold ministry he knew he's a prophet by the end he wrote it in the church age book so we can we can prove that but that's where I stopped it remember there was three stages to perfection I'm going to skip this most of you remember this when I preached on the three bodies terrestrial celestial glorified we just throw it show all those so I'm gonna skip past that mostly remember those guys always perfected in threes and so we looked at justification sanctification again the statue perfect man this is God's roadmap this is where we can know where we are in God at any time of course we have brother Adam says it in the church ages if you listen the stature of a man he ties this in with the church ages and the messengers so it all ties together here's where this this is this will start helping us if we really get down to business with God faith is the substance need to choose the way you've been baptized I'm following Christ the rest of my life virtue is the strength and daily walked away even in public because the Bible said Ruth was filled with virtue all the men in the city knew she was virtuous so virtue lives it in front of your work your co-workers virtue who lives it at your family gathering it doesn't compromise and well I'll just smoke a little over here is come with my family or I'll cuss a little bit with the guys at work you know know I'll wear a little make-up here I'll wear pants over here I'll wear shorts over here I'll show off my chest a little bit over here you know I'll do this or that it doesn't compromise when you got virtue you got strength to stand to be a witness knowledge is understanding why I do this I need to understand why I do this now I understand why because it's cross-dressing and it's abomination or now I understand why don't do these things temperance is self-control this is over your fleshly carnal lusts right self-control were needed to remain on this way we must have self-control we must crucify the lusts of the flesh this is why the Holy Spirit said to a man one time and a woman if you want the Holy Ghost give up the cigarettes because God is not going to fill a temple that can't even overcome a tiny little cigarette with the filter on the end a piece of tobacco if you can't overcome that how you gonna overcome Satan when he comes to you and you makes you feel like God don't hear your prayers between life and death if you can't overcome that stick of tobacco how you gonna overcome Satan himself but we need power to overcome six of tobacco bottles of whiskey right and we need the self-control to overcome that then be filled with the Holy Spirit patience is steadfast steadfast to be content on this way and not only content with men but content with God content with God God I'm content you let things happen I'm content with that I'll be steadfast and also have patience with other people to patience with your brother patience with your sister patience with the pastor if he's out of out of cater patience you have to have godly patience amen and then godliness program said it's me just like God and he said godliness God is so good he's kind to the his enemies to the just and the unjust so program said this one focuses on your enemies if you can't be good to your enemies how's he gonna fear what the Holy Ghost because God is good to his enemies he sends him rain every day right he sends him food he lets them to get all these things that they need and last before you get the Holy Ghost you have to be so selfless that you'll live for the people in the church you have a burden for people at church you'll want to live for them you'll want to come to church just for them amen for them and for course for Christ but you want to live in case you can help somebody out or pray for somebody or encourage somebody you live for the body of Jesus Christ amen and then you get the personal presence where it's Christ in you the hope of glory now here's the example as we went over just with the children so this is all review for the children the disciples argued who is greater so that proves their lack and brotherly kindness I'm greater than you brother amen nope maokai I'm Way greater than you and if you read the scripture they were arguing that after Jesus told them he was going to be crucified so it's almost like they were planning okay we know Jesus might die so who's gonna lead us after that they start arguing and say no it's me I'm greater than you I'm greater and that shows they didn't have brotherly kindness praise the Lord there were signs all over the place that we're lacking some virtues that we need next Jesus prayed that Peters faith would not fail even though all his virtue did he did not have enough virtue to stand up to men and at that or Jesus arrests out there in the courtyard of the high priest nor a little maid woman which would have been what 12 or 13 or 15 years old who knows he couldn't even stand there and say yes I know Jesus to a made girl which would be the lowest of society right outside of slaves you know women were lower than men of course so for you understand not today but you know in those days you understand he couldn't stand up to a little girl and say I followed Jesus Christ that's how much virtue he lost and then I talked about how today's sisters might compromise and wear pants you know to work and school or something like that like we talked about and I just wrote some more examples for today's sermon Wright brothers and church I've known this I know I've known brothers in the offices in church that go to work and lie to people and go to work and cuss in the message I've known people over the years they have offices they could be song leaders they could be piano players they could be preachers and when they go to work they tell dirty jokes I know that for a fact so don't tell me it doesn't happen it happens and so they put on such a pretend they don't work with people the church so they can come to church and act like everything's okay I'm sorry that kind of doesn't even have the understanding to know that a Christian should be pure of that before they even step into an office so it's not we're not just talking about sisters we're talking about brothers too that don't live the life shame on that kind of behavior I've seen it was actually with more with brothers and I have sisters mercy brother Ram said he had a temper okay so this is some temperance in a temper before he was born again he lacked patience and temperance he said one way he knew he was born again because he finally overcame his temper all right then I showed the children this once you get up here justification sanctification then you get this armor of God brother Ram said and then the fruits of the spirit start flowing out of your life and then we close by showing this we're given a measure of faith or a portion everybody has a portion like you got a portion of an orange you have a portion of Apple you have a portion of cottage cheese whatever is on your you know lunch you have a portion just like faith you have a portion of that but Peter says we can pray to for God to add these to our lives and the disciples said Lord increase our faith that was our text they had faith already but they wanted more faith Eamon that's me tonight Lord I want more faith I want more love I want more power more of you because we grow from glory to glory faith to faith Jarius said lord I believe help my unbelief he already believed but he wanted to believe all you want to leave with everything and also shows you a little bit of fear so he's saying in other words lord give me perfect love because perfect love will cast out my little bit of fear that's what he was saying give me perfect love so that love will cast out all fear and guess what Jesus did Amen and then ask God and he'll add the virtues to you because Jesus had asked anything and I'll do it okay now I'm just gonna keep Malachi just give me a moment I'm sorry let me do this I'm gonna unplug and put this back up here in just a minute I want that statue to remain up there because I think it's a good it's a good visual for us as we start preaching these I'm gonna start getting to all this new material hope that's okay I did like a 10 minute review but I think could be a blessing to you they should switch back over Malachi in just a minute here there we go okay praise the Lord for that update in just a minute but I want to start looking at this now and go a little deeper right go little deeper okay God you need your Bibles you know where it's like a big Bible study tonight so get out your Bibles and do some teaching through here okay I'm sorry I want to think I think I pulled up this because this gives us a long-term view does that give you a long-term view of your life that gives me church the honestly this is my roadmap to life one time in my show I remember a man wanted it I showed you the roadmap of finances I follow that roadmap brother but this is the roadmap for my entire life right here I got baptized in 2001-2002 I mean going up the Kings Highway ever since okay now you we need to ask God Lord where am i but let's look at the disciples because this is so powerful when you see how easily they got in the flesh but if we if we look at this we can see oh no wonder they got in the flesh they didn't have divine love yet but then we know what they did afterwards afterwards Church they turn cities upside down by the power of the Holy Ghost when they got the Holy Ghost they turn families upside down families got mad at him governments hate him government's one of them killed because of the power of the Holy Ghost who wants more the Holy Ghost amen I don't care where you are if you're here you can still get more of it amen because the Bible said you constantly need more sanctification more sanctification brother Branham said the morgue we looked at on Sunday the more God trusts you the more trials you have a man and the more God trusts you the more he can use you praise God look at John look at st. John and then of his life God let him go through such a hard trial he got abandoned on the Isle of Patmos but what happened out there he got the revelation of the book of Revelation that's still speaking to us today when the greatest hardest trial is a band that was serpents and and the poisonous poisonous snakes out on the Isle Patmos but it took such a trial to produce such a glorious book for us amen the book of Revelation hallelujah so that's my purpose for tonight is to see their progression now let me give a disclaimer I I don't know like how far they getting if they can fall off I don't know but I know this for sure they can have virtues but then they get weak in some areas okay because of Peter Peter had some of these he was doing pretty good but then by the end he lost all his virtue and I was he had left was faith after Jesus was crucified that's all he had left was faith so I don't know how the order goes I know things like that I don't know how far you can go and how much you lose but I know at some point we know people we know clearly the disciples didn't have a lot of understanding of things we know that many times I'm sorry par me okay got your Bibles now the disciples were firsthand witnesses of Jesus Christ for three and a half years and still they didn't have divine love they saw the greatest miracles that could ever be done how many believed that there could be no greater miracles were have said you cannot do a greater miracle in Jesus Christ because he was the fullness of God in a man that's exactly right three and a half years they never got to hear but in the matter of within two months because 50 days after the resurrection they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so three and a half years they struggled in and out struggling in and out but then after two months of being consecrated and ten days of prayer they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah what a what an amazing story God does how quickly God can change people's lives amen now let's start with this I want you I want to tie this thought this is outside the thumb but go to Matthew 5:19 I've been reading in the Gospels the last few weeks I finished I forget what book it was Ezekiel yeah and since then I've just been reading you know random places sometimes like to spend some time just jumping around the Bible being refreshed so I've been I've been getting refreshed in the in the the Gospels we're reading a lot in the Gospels alright so as we look at the Gospels let's look at Matthew 5:19 this thought really jumped out at me and I want to bring it out because it was all my notes I had this ready two days ago so let's look at this here Matthew 5:19 we'd love someone like to read that for me by God's grace but Adam all right thank sir a man thank you brother so how many can see that there are Commandments that are greater Commandments than others can where you see that all Commandments are important don't misunderstand me tonight every commandment is important in fact if you got the Holy Ghost the Bible said you'll keep you want to live by every word that proceeds out the mouth of God but I'm gonna prove to you by Jesus Christ's words himself I'm sorry not to point anybody I'm just kind of like point like this that's what I mean to do I'm gonna prove to us by Jesus Christ's words himself that some Commandments are more important than others understand that the same things true some sins on the other side some sins are worse than others jesus said will be more tolerable for the city of Sodom on the day of judgment than it would be for Sidon and what's the other tyree and Capernaum yes those three it'll be easier it'll be less of a punishment on Sodom than those three he imagined Jesus gonna condemn the people that denied his ministry more than the homosexuals now I hate to be blunt like that but can never understand that it's hard for me to understand that but uh uh in one way but another way Jesus was God in flesh and it turned down him you would have had to been in deep awful sin right so take that thought anyone who teaches even the least commandant whatever the smallest commandment what do you think the smallest commandment is Church any idea I can prove you by the Bible one of the least Commandments is tithing I'm gonna prove that prove that to you tonight the tithing is not the greatest commandment the greatest commandment is to love your Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength but tithing is one of the least of the Commandments that's why I don't preach on money every week like some churches some denomination because they want money money money money it's one of the least of the commandments let me prove it to you how many believe it's true go to Matthew 23 verse 1 three hope I'm not shocking anybody too much but ma'am says get your shot proof vests on if you feel like I might shock you tonight get your shot professor I'm not trying to shock anybody but I just want to let you know before and that's why you know we have to go through the statute man to understand some of these are greater a greater value than others broadly kindnesses of a greater value than some of these God wants his family treated the right way before he lets you in his family right officially now he course the church don't get me wrong I know you're in his family before the foundation world I understand that but in the in the in the present time before he lets you join that family in the present with the baptism of Holy Ghost he wants to make sure you're gonna treat them the right way glory that's exactly right all right ready there Matthew 23:23 I hope I'm not too shocked yeah I'm just taking the literal words of our Lord Jesus Christ tonight Matthew 23:23 Malachi you wanna get that for me sir thank you yes anis yeah I think that's the closest thing I don't know we can say praise the Lord he never saying I'm not trying to be smart out I'm not trying to anything but can you understand from this Jesus is saying clearly they spent way too much time on tithing at their church praise the Lord he said you tithe on every little tiny ounce that we'd say every little milliliter you make sure you said these Pharisees they make sure they tied on every little thing but then they omit or do away with the way to your partners or parts of the law matters of the law which are mercy judgment and faith was that it was that mercy judgment what's the other one mercy judgment was it faith yes mercy and judgment and faith so what did Jesus say did you say don't tithe no he said you ought to did the tithing but you should not have left out the more important commands either and what did Jesus say brother he said if anybody teaches them not to the least of my commandments they'll be kind of lease in the kingdom of heaven oh it's okay if you don't pay ties or pay offerings if I would teach that I would be least in the kingdom of heaven but I want you to know tithing is one of the least of the commandments and the church said amen that might be shocking to you but that is not one of the greatest Commandments if you're born again the Holy Ghost you'll do those things we know that but let me tell you that as the Pharisees tithes on every little thing but they didn't have mercy they didn't have judgment and didn't have faith like they ought to let me give you an example they did not show mercy upon the woman caught in adultery because jesus said let let he who of you that have not sinned cast the first on what they all do they all dropped it right they were being too rough on the woman caught in adultery because why they were living in spiritual adultery creeds of men they created their own traditions of men and judgment they judge the situation wrong they should have judged and had mercy upon this woman but they judged the wrong way so how you judge others and how you have mercy on others is a big reflection one of the greatest Commandments and the church said that's not my words brothers sisters that's red-letter words let me give you one for faith I'm sorry let me give you another one for mercy the Pharisees got upset when Jesus said he was going to heal on the Sabbath look how they were lacking mercy they said oh you can't heal on the Sabbath this is a no working day but for God for God americo's our work it's His grace it's his hand of grace and so they judged Jesus as you're wrong oh we can't have mercy we can't let him work on the Sabbath and the whole time God is trying to heal people but they won't have mercy and judgment I'd say God help us have mercy and judgment amen I'm not saying don't pay tithes and offerings I'm saying do that I'm saying don't leave the others undone but I'm saying let's have the ones that are most important let's make sure we do all the Word of God and faith I couldn't think of a time when they should have had more faith other than you know believe it they should have got baptized with John the Baptist they should have done that at least right and they should have faith in Jesus Christ we know that but I thought were those helpful examples the woman called adultery no mercy they judged it wrong healing on the Sabbath they judged it wrong God wants to set people free he wants to do it today praise God he was to set people free today if they'll just believe His commandments so can you see that I could put a I could put a chart up here and I'd put mercy judgment and faith way at the top of important Commandments and guess what I put at the bottom tithes and offerings but I don't want you to know we don't want to rob from God either praise the Lord that's an awful sin but but robbing from God money is not even as close as bad as murdering a woman who deserves mercy oh you ever understand that they were gonna murder this woman and throw stones and then get jesus's permission to do it shame on them you see that you understand that does that help you by God's grace I thought that was beautiful that just made me just my like and there's golden nuggets in the New Testament - not just the Old Testament amen all right now let's get started here we're gonna go through these virtues and we're gonna show you examples maybe never seen or maybe you have seen but we're gonna bring to light how the disciples needed sanctification I got 35 minutes to do it probably plenty time here alright let's look at faith now we already went over one example where Jesus said your faith would fail not all right go to Matthew 16 let's go to Matthew 16 we should have our Bibles here hopefully got your Bibles if you do if not we can all just read them I want to look at to read two important pastors Matthew 16:13 these are very familiar but I want you to see this Matthew 16:13 I want you to see the importance of faith what a brother am say faith was he said it was the foundation if your foundation is good guess what your building is going to be all right in the storm you the Bible said you're gonna get beat up by the winds and the waves but you're still gonna stand Amen because you're on the right foundation and this is a beautiful point to prove even though Peter made a fool of himself just like we do sometimes and the church said we make fool of ourselves sometimes even though we did sometimes his foundation never failed why cuz his foundation was faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God hey man and that is a revelation but amen that the gates of hell could not prevail against a man Haven just shared her faith in that recently Haven said I've got faith in Jesus Christ in the Son of God well guess what that foundation will never fail her because that's a true revelation of God's Word amen and Church has never failed me since 2002 praise God I never want to walk away sometimes I want to quit preaching or sometimes I want to quit doing all that I do but I never want to quit Jesus because I get tired and you know how we all do we all battle I've heard about Donny Reagan say he said he said I probably sign for my church 200 times but then when I get to the pulpit the Holy Spirit says no you need to stay on and love these people because we're all human are you with me Church we all go through you know mind battles we go through tough times but God delivers us from every one of them just hang with him hang with Christ right let him hang on to you in other words he'll refresh you praise God just stay with the Lord Jesus Matthew 16:13 all right when Jesus came in the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say oh they're out John the Baptist some say eliza's others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God that's why I asked haven when he was she when she was baptized I said do you believe Jesus Christ is the son of the Living God and she said yes the gates of hell can't prevail against that and blessed are you haven for you believe that Jesus Christ is the son of the Living God I'm just using her for example to encourage your praise God amen Jesus said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood and not revealed in verse 17 but my father which is in heaven I also say to me that thou art Peter upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it Jesus's church is built upon the foundation of faith how many can see that by God's grace so hold everyone in the everyone in the body of Christ is built upon faith that Jesus is the Son of God and if he's a son of God he's a part of God amen he's one with God amen he's manifesting God in fact that Jesus said the son is the only one who can reveal the father amen hallelujah so when you know Jesus Christ is the son Living God then the father has been revealed to you praise God amen now go to john 6:66 this anchor of faith this foundation of faith always held in the midst of the trials and we know of course as we already talked about we know it held on the night of Jesus's arrest even though he fled even though denied him he never went back into the world right of course he went back fishing but he never he never left Christ right he went back to his old job he stopped preaching for a little while but he never left Christ amen hallelujah john 6:66 we're familiar with this this is the mark of the beast scripture 666 my Bible says this from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more they couldn't walk with the word of the hour the message of the hour then said Jesus under the twelve will you go also go away then Simon Peter answered and said Lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe in our sure that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now remember this is the chapter where Jesus said you must drink of my blood and eat my flesh and he never explained it all the other ones are saying he's a cannibal and you're gonna follow him you're a cannibal and Peter's like I don't know all I know is he's got the words to turn alive where´s am I gonna go who else preaches like this guy whoever does miracles like this man what other prophet does America's weather prophet as a pillar fire above his head amen one of the prophets said thus saith the Lord amen whether God changed your life from sinner to Saint amen change my life what other God could do that only the Word of God for this hour it's exactly right now look at the next verse 70 G's answer said have not chosen you twelve and yet one of you is a devil so Peter just assumes well Judas is a believer you know because he hadn't you know he's been hiding that sin for a while and this proves Church a person without the Holy Ghost might not pick up on a serpent seed right now I'm not saying a person with the Holy Ghost will pick up on it but what I'm saying a person with the Holy Ghost will serve Jesus all the days of his life and he won't sell out the end like Judas did and the church said that's right Judas sold about it somebody said I would rather have money than I'll get back with him later on I'd rather have money and he crossed the line between mercy and judgment it's exactly right but one person with the Holy Ghost they'll eventually stay with the word and come back to the word amen now verse 71 he spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve so we're still on faith so Peters fell I'm sorry Peters faith held rather it held even when he couldn't understand the preaching it held even when he bitterly failed Jesus even though even though he stopped preaching he never went into sin he never cheated on his wife and married again and all these things like that he just went back to fishing are you with me Church he just went back to fishing but God had a plan and pretty soon Jesus asked him do you love me three times what'd he say feed my sheep in other words if you love me start preaching if you love me start teaching others my doctrine praise God is that what Jesus said your love for me Peter will be demonstrated by you feeding the Lambs my word let me say tonight Jesus let me just make a public confession that's one way you know I love Jesus is that I'll feed his lambs amen Alleluia so will you if you're a parent you'll feed your children the Word of God here we go it's your turn buddy feed your children teacher and the Word of God trainer up all the days of our life feed our the Word of God that's your duty sir and Jesus just will see Jesus love by how he does that amen I don't believe that that's right oh I feel good tonight you feel good tonight amen go to Luke seven nine let's look at this another one on faith it's the last one on faith I just want you to show this I'm sorry I just want to show you this so you can see this and be reminded of these important things Luke seven nine how about somebody new cos somebody new read that Lydia I'm sorry amen he read that Luke seven nine did you catch that he said this to all the people that followed him Church his disciples are standing right there there's women that found him and they kept the money Mary Magdalene was one of them praise God there's other other people over here and Jesus stop says wait a minute Church listen this man this Roman centurion has greater faith than all of my followers talk about a rebuke right all his disciples are standing there there's Peter James John he turns around and said I have not found faith like this in all of Israel and brother Graham said that's the Gentile way to do it is just hear the word of God and believe it god help us to have that Amen that we can come to church some Wednesday night or some Sunday morning or some Sunday night and the preacher will say something or you'll talk to his sister after church and they'll speak God's Word right to you and you'll say that's nothing but the truth and it'll come to pass in your life god help us have Gentile faith like that have you seen it I've seen it praise God cam seen it all these brothers because give testimonies of times they spoken the word and it's come to pass literally that's Gentile faith speak the word and I'll believe it it's exactly right so see Jesus shows this man this Roman centurion had greater faith than all the disciples so even in faith there's measures of faith some people have more faith than others and then we get into gifts and callings but I'm not gonna look at that tonight all right everybody ready for virtue let's go to virtue here I got one two three four examples are to use the modern-day examples of a brother who's in a he's in a maybe a preacher or deacon or song leader and yet he goes to so work and lies and cheats and and cusses and swears listen to rock and roll music and flirt with women I've seen that to people and officers caught flirting with women these things should not be so church and the church said should not be so but see how people can hide in their sin see how sin likes to hide sin see how a sin doesn't like to be exposed I don't care how many big services I have as far as miracles I just want to see the miracle of somebody repenting from their sins because that could potentially did you hear me hope you heard me I said that could potentially be greater than somebody getting healed it from their body of the bodily sickness right because that person may get sick again but if this person repents of their sin and they overcome it the rest of their lives and the Bible says you saved that soul from a multitude of sin amen I preached in 2012 in Guyana I preached the rapture in the family and I was I was stirred up for the bang I walked in there I was praying and fasting all day I felt so full of the Holy Ghost I thought hallelujah I'm gonna preaching and it was the quietest service I ever preached in my entire life and brother bang I left honestly and I felt like this I might not look like this but this is how I felt no one came up for prayer and I felt so discouraged the next day I got some of the biggest rebukes from the people that were in the church they said brother Jesse cuz after brother Brooks preached the final message they had he said let's give testimonies and there's about five or six women that came up and said last night service spoke to all of our hearts we stayed up all night talking confessing all of our sins and one of those women said I confess my abortion to my husband can you imagine that murdering spirit was laying in that woman's soul for our mind all those years and then it took us some nobody preacher to come around and expose that demon to confess that and now she's finally free by the grace of God she could have went to her grave with that church but she confessed it and great healing was was had that day and the woman one of the older women kind of rebuked me she said brother Jesse don't feel bad you shouldn't feel bad when that happens she said when we're quiet that means we're really getting cut and I kind of bowed my head said yes sister I'll take that rebuke and it really taught me a good lesson and then the one of the pastor's daughters came up and she wept and cried right there holding the mic I'll never forget it and she said I have been so disobedient to my parents I've broke all their rules and she wept and cried and I'm friends with her on Facebook she got married she got a little baby by God's grace the pastor's so happy pastor Cass tonight's his name-o Church I tell you that's what Satan hates Satan hates to be exposed people can go to special meetings I love to go to special meetings you guys just went to special meetings you go to special meetings or just regular meetings but if that devil lays there what good did it do the person's got to open their heart and expose Satan clean those flus out so the Holy Ghost can flow in amen that's what we need the Holy Ghost to expose sinan people's lives amen and to me like I said that may be greater confessing abortion and rebellion as a teenager that may be greater than if somebody got healed of a cancer because they might get it back I'm not I'm not I'm not downsized downplaying cancer healing I'm not downplaying that but I'm saying let's let the will of God be done amen glorious modern-day examples I talked about those women and and their standards oh another one my brother recently talked to me and he said it grieved his heart he said he went to Cedar Point and he saw one of the oldest faithful sisters in the church wearing shorts and pants at Cedar Point and this woman plays I'm not gonna say which but she plays the instrument and a real old faithful woman can you imagine someone as a leader in the church and let me say like this I've seen well I bet I'll say that I'm not gonna go there I don't give too much but I'm letting you know you need to know modern-day examples because this one happens many times people will live the life in front of you live the life of the Minnesotans pretend the life but then when they go on vacation or then when they're behind closed doors they don't live the life we need people that will live it no matter where they are because that means it's genuine it's a real conviction so here's a well respected elderly woman a woman whose gali got the longest hair maybe in the church I don't know how to check I didn't check I'm just making an exaggeration so you know I don't care what they play on the outside or what they do at church that's good I'm appreciating that but if you don't live it at home it's not even genuine and there she is can you imagine a woman the message raised the message her parents go the message church they all go to church together and she's walking around in shorts and culottes not Church that shows to me I could be wrong but that shows this person doesn't have the knowledge of cross-dressing that means she thinks it's okay for Bruce Jenner to wear a woman's garment and say I'm Caitlyn Jenner and God put a female spirit on me that's what she's really saying and you prove it different by this you prove it they're different by history because God said it's abomination for a man to put on a woman's garment whenever their garments were well fast forward to our day any culture whenever the culture is there should be men's garments and women's garments it's not always skirts and pants it's but in our in our culture that is the real that's the real difference if you don't believe that look on the restroom side a woman's got a skirt on man's got pants on and someone so long in the message done such great things and let me say like this seeing beautiful song specials I don't care how do I don't care how much people cry if they don't live it outside of there they never really got they never got the goods Church they never got sealed because their Carver that inner train car it can't be sealed because things are packed down we got to have these troops pack down amen where I'm going to keep this word no matter who's around because I know Jesus is always around amen hallelujah but see this is the kind of lies people are living and saying their fill with the Holy Ghost that your sins will find you out but let me say like this your righteousness will find you out too jesus said if you pray in the closet he said if you give to the poor in secret I reward you openly amen glory hallelujah I mean 19 I was gonna preach on that that was from God if it had bless somebody I didn't mean to I don't have any big my heart towards that person God knows but it grieves me to see someone who had claimed for decades now decades to believe the message and then transgress the commands of the Lord let me I might finish this I may because you might be familiar with some of these okay go to Matthew 26 35 Matthew 26:39 this is something I'd forgotten because Peter on the night of Jesus arrests remember he lost all his virtue but before he denied Christ three times he in front of all the disciples said I'm not willing just go with you I'm willing to die with you remember that a church think about that that is such amazing statement like Peter at one point he was so stirred up he said I'll die with you and in just a few hours he denied him three times now Church I'm not exalting any of us about Peter I'm saying I would have done the same thing without the Holy Ghost right brother may have said if you were Adam or Eve in the garden you would done the same thing because we need a Savior if we don't then we don't need a Savior because did that we didn't need a Savior but we all fall short of the glory of God that's why when I we preach on Peter I can see myself times I've fell short of the glory of God times I've act like I didn't know or times I didn't do things right see and that ought to convict us we ought to be honest with ourselves and live the right kind of life do I have the virtue a Christian should have and I live in the life a Christian should live look at Matthew 26 35 okay let's read 33 I love look at Peters bold words now look he's he's pretending brother BAM said he had a human virtue not of real Holy Ghost virtue he had a Hugh is trying to put on strength other words you trying to say look at me look at me he's trying to put it on really convinced you look at me I'll die with you tonight I want to come down to it he embarrass himself so bitterly that he wept bitterly and cried running away from Christ so I was so bitter such a bitter failure Peter answered and said unto Him though all men shall be offended because of the yet I will never be offended look at this all the other eleven will leave now that's why I'm sorry there's only ten eleven at that point all the other ten will leave but I'm right I'm with you Jesus Here I am look at verse 35 Peter said in him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny the likewise also said all the disciples can you imagine the big let me say like this just the testosterone in that room yaaay so they're big and burly and tough I'm not gonna deny him either yes James I won't deny I'm either John will you deny him no way we're all dying for you Jesus we all think we're God pretend Bert's you we all think we got virtue but it's not the real virtue I want to come down to it they all ran away Peter at least found him to the the trial but then there he couldn't stand and he couldn't stand for Christ there and even though John ran away at least he made it to the cross yep pounding their chest and say look at me I'm so strong and then you have the strength to stand up to a little girl in church now let's bring into our lives we have strength to stand up to our family tell them about the Word of God the message how about sinners out there on the streets we have the strength to tell them I'm thankful I used to be scared to say William branham's name in the last few years I got no fear I no fear I used to be ashamed to say certain things but by the grace of God and that's the my next sermon on fear I'm gonna kind of give you a preview brother Branham said God knows how to train a man he said God took Moses on the worldís for forty years and he said he beat all the fear out of him for 40 years it took to beat the fear out of him 40 years cuz he was scared he had just killed a man he knew Pharaoh's after him he knew he's gonna you thought well maybe he's gonna hunt me for forty years got to keep pounding that gold found it impound it until he beat all the dross out and then he brought him to the burning bush amen well there's my sermon for next Wednesday you just heard it in the cliff the Cliff Notes version there that's right Church that's right that's right he he had all this human virtue not the real virtue of a Christian how many want real virtue I do more than anything I want real faith real virtue knowledge all these flowing through me so I can be a real Christian hallelujah and I'm not a pretender I don't want to play Church I want to be but I said you're a powerhouse when you're capped off he said you're a spiritual powerhouse amen against what the temptations of Satan you defeat that you're a king and priest amen so they all pound their chests and say we can do this we got come to find out a few hours they didn't have what it takes next in verse well I'm gonna skip over this one but Jesus said he leaves the disciples he said come with me Peter James and John he said can you pray and watch for one hour do you have the virtue you say maybe our brother he may be he call the brothers in here he say can you pray with me one hour tonight it's gonna be a late night can you pray with me would we have the virtue to pray for one hour with the Lord Jesus Christ they didn't have it they kept falling asleep but you know Jesus was so merciful at last I remember he said the last time you said just go on and sleep he's gone and sleep take a rest whatever's gonna happen is gonna be accomplished see because the Bible said he had to walk the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God he had to walk alone glory he had to walk alone now looking back then we thought Lord I wish I could have prayed and that's what we say sometimes lord I wish I could have prayed a little longer lord I wish but don't Jesus won't abandon your church amen he knows he knows your spirits willing but your flesh sometimes gets weak I'm not giving you excuse to not pray at home I'm not don't don't take that from the sermon tonight you must pray more at home we read it last Wednesday I think they heard it but a man said if you want a revival you got to pray at home you got a prayer meetings at home that will bring a revival to our lives bettan Arad can't bring a revival for Akron in his pocket and say I brought your revival right well the camera got him coming out pretty soon he can't say okay I brought your revival right here it'll never happen and I think we know that by now right no matter how much expectation we say we have for a guest Minister how much faith we're having if we don't back it up with prayer it's just gonna be a regular service never understand that and I'm not doubting anything or expectation I'm not down anybody's faith or but the reality of it is we got to pray until we get the virtue because the Bible said in Jude 1:20 you build up your faith by praying in the Holy Ghost that's still how many want to be stronger in Christ God help us to pray more then it don't have to be on your knees this last week I've been so tired with Adam I from all this work you know I'm running myself to death I've only can pray at my table going my desk I read my chapter I can pray like this I've had some of the most glorious prayers and I didn't think it was possible I thought I had to get on my knees to have a great prayer I was so trained like I wouldn't be like some and I raised my hand I was so trained but this last week's few weeks have taught me I can be just as sincere sitting in my chair that's why there's no evidence well you got a shout up here we've got to speak in tongues over here it's however wherever God meets you church amen wherever you can humble yourself that's where God will meet you amen remember Samuel Browning the pastor up in Sheffield got saved and got the Holy Ghost next to a dog kennel and brother Bill Sanchez's basement you know what's in dog kennels water and dog food and dog hair and that's where God filled them with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah right there where'd you get it well don't really matter where you get it as long as you get in the condition to get it ain't the next one this next one kind of combines with virtue Jesus said some demons don't go out except through prayer and fasting so see prayer and fasting brings virtue or power against demon powers does ever understand that I'm not gonna spend much time on that that's like a divine healing message I may go in that later by God's grace okay let's go to acknowledge now knowledge I got so many examples help me Jesus help me I really don't like preaching part twos but tonight I'm gonna have to do that just give me a moment here let me I got one two three four five six seven eight I have eight examples of how the disciples lacked understanding they didn't have the knowledge they needed to really have the Holy Ghost I have a one example of temperance patience I got a couple examples you have two examples godliness I got two examples brotherly kindness there's a lot of really kindness because the disciple sometimes they didn't read each other really well they didn't know how to treat their brother sometimes that was art remember that's our text remember that they said you ought to forgive brother bang seven times if brother Jesse sins against you brother bang Jesus said forgive him seven times in one day and bang we looked at Jesus and creased my faith raised my faith that's gonna be hard to do because it seemed like brother Jesse had something against me if he sinned against me seven times in one day but Jesus said if he comes to you and says I repent he said forgive him and they said I need more faith than that I don't have enough faith to do that so let's be honest with ourselves right and say Lord if I'm lacking little faith I'm lacking virtue I'm lacking a these add it to my character add to my character just one more minute here let me look here I think I'm just gonna go over let's just go over brotherly kindness and I'll be done is that okay I thought I'm so blessed by this cuz I want to make sure we treat each other the right way here praise the Lord I don't a church that loves each other and can look past our faults right I want everybody to look past our faults forgive if I've sinned against you just come rebuke me tell me about it please if I've said if you sin against me I'll come I'll text you I'll email I'll talk to you something it'll come up eventually let's do that by God's grace okay where I talked about who is arguing who's the greatest that was lacking Rutley kindness next one let's take your Bibles that was Sunday okay tonight we're looked at forgiving your brother increase our faith go to Luke 9 here's there's a couple of Luke 9 Luke 9 49 yeah Luke 9 49 let's do it Luke 9 49 let's close I just really kinda feel compelled about brotherly kindness tonight Luke 9 49 and John answered and said master we saw one casting out Devils in thy name and we forbade him because he followeth not with us and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us brother Branham said this man whoever he was he said he was getting results my brother BAM said any man that gets results casting out Devils for the RAM said he's doing something right so the disciples got a little jealous and said oh you're not a part of our church what are they doing they're mistreating the body of Christ didn't have enough brotherly kindness to know oh everybody's got to be a part of my church that's why I don't want to hold anybody here unless God called you here if God called you here he's gonna bless you here he's gonna feed you here he's gonna let you grow here praise God like like God told Abraham you'll be a blessing ever in church and you will bless people in the church and they'll bless you that's what God told Abraham you'll be a blessing and you'll be blessed wherever God's called you but look they get so upset oh this brother he don't belong to our church you can't preach anymore well when did when did you start giving out licenses for preachers where's your fellowship car who started passing out fellowship cards around here so see it's kind of like maybe there's some jealousy in there I'm not sure but whatever it was Church they didn't have the right brotherly kindness they needed everybody see that all right go to mark 10:13 mark 10:13 this is just a beautiful thought to me I hope it's a blessing you are 10:13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them let me just stop right there can you imagine here's the Lord Jesus Christ he's raising people from the dead he's telling the lepers that you're healed paralyzed people are walking in Jesus you know he's probably sitting down join some a meal after a long service or something and these sisters who press all their way out think about this they brought their little babies to Jesus they could be a home sewing they could be at home resting but they left all their home in their business and they took a extra extra effort to come out to church this night and these sisters they spent all day watching Jesus heal the sick they let Jesus do all the healing and now they say well can I just have a little personal interview with the Lord can I see him I have a nurse in my baby all day I didn't get to sit with the other people because my babies loud and I want to only let the people hear the preaching and here they are they just say I have a little bit time with the Lord Lord will you pray over Lily will you pray over Victoria and would you would you dedicate her to the Lord and the disciples look on that you know they're so high and mighty where were the closest to the master the Bible said they rebuke the sisters it's out the scripture said they reviewed them shame on you sisters the Masters working you think the master has time for mothers with babies oh he makes plenty of time for everybody he makes time for anybody that wants a servant praise God anybody that wants to come to Christ and hear God's word Christ will make time for them what they get so high and mighty they can't even respect their sisters like they ought to get out of here what do you mean children they're not even sick it's a healthy baby can't you see there's all these other babies over here what's wrong with you and Jesus saw it he was much displeased can you imagine Jesus getting angry picture that face angry or maybe just Stern like mother man said Stern like he would if you'd speak he'd speak one word the whole world would be burned up in fire or if he'd speak a word you just cry and just love him and hug his feet you know he said that kind of look on his face and there he gets much displeased with the disciples he said suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God why because jesus knew there's a lot of children ought to be in heaven because they were aborted right murdered and then also he brings it down to the spiritual in the next verse verily I say unto you whosoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein jesus knew little children had faith in fact one of them already showed his faith because he brought his lunch to Jesus and that's the kind of faith that's in the kingdom of God amen whenever I got whatever little is I'll bring it to Christ and Christ will multiply if I'm just willing to sacrifice it for Christ we'd some more children like that with fishes and loaves they men we need some more adults like that too I'll bring whatever I got I'll just bring childlike faith I'll just put all my life in Christ's hands and I'll watch him bless my life amen I watch them bless all my little humble gifts they see make significant to be able to do any work for Christ but Christ will take that and he'll bless it a hundredfold amen glory but they refuse his sister and say no no you stay in your position you can't anytime with the master jesus said I'm much displeased with you in other words I'm not happy with you you haven't treated the body of Christ you haven't treated these sisters the way days are deserved to be treated by the way who did Jesus show himself first to after the resurrection a man or a woman a woman who had seven demons cast out of her a harlot woman were seven demons that's what we chose to show himself to because his big brawny men right they all ran in fear except for John right at the cross so Jesus said I must show myself to the sisters first and then the Bible said the sisters tell them and they still don't believe listen they were all doubting Thomases they all doubted the women he gets that we were so hard on Thomas but they were all doubting Thomases until Jesus comes in the Bible City upgraded the hardness of their heart why are you so hard-hearted you can't believe a woman's testimony it's your show they had a bad opinion of women I don't bring no children of Jesus don't bring them to Jesus and Church that's the thing we want the sisters to hear the word of God here just as me want the brothers to hear just as much as we want the children to hear we want everyone to hear God's Word that's why I'm so thankful for begging to hang up the I'm not joking I'm just thankful he'll hang up those TVs so anyone who wants to hear the word of God can hear it praise God that's what Jesus would do brother bang that's what Christ would do he would not say oh it's insignificant shouldn't spend your money you know letting the sisters you know hear the word of God how precious is the Word of God Oh she'd hear the word of God and Christ will not turn one away he said let the little children let the sisters come I'll minister to them I'm closing with this all right I must have sent my timing wrong I think I already preached the hour this says I got seven minutes left I'll take the watch you watch all right go to Matthew 20 let's close of this Matthew 20 20 verse 20 how many love the Lord tonight Church I love Jesus Christ now more than ever half I'm not perfect but I'm striving for perfection I want to live what God has revealed in this hour I want to live the message I want to live it every day I don't want to take a week off I want to take a month off I don't take a year off I want every day I want to serve him with fear of God all the days of my life [Music] so somebody can see Christ in me but RAM said if you can't do anything else just win one soul to Christ that's what I want my life if all's I can do is win one soul let me win that one song and lord if I don't right now perhaps I'll seem in a few months let me be sanctified so I can win their soul when I meet them let me be sanctified so I can do it by your grace Matthew 20 verse 20 alright here's another one where they get upset with disciples for requests about positions and who has rewards and who's greater than others we'll close with this one verse 20 then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children and her sons worshiping him and desiring a certain thing of him I want you to notice Jesus never rebuked this woman I want you to notice that this this was a honest sincere desire from a mother's heart so jesus never rebukes her and I believe she asked it in total sincerity I don't believe there's anything selfish about this request I mean honestly which of you if you had children or if you have to which of you don't want your turn to grow up and be hall-of-famers of faith kind of say like that oh my Lydia and my girl is a Malachi I want them to grow up and be soul winners for Christ I want them to serve Christ better than I serve Christ that would be the greatest privilege of my life because the Bible says you have no greater joy than to see your children walk in truth there's no greater joy than that to see them serve God yet they see my heirs at home you know they see my tiredness or if I get cranky they see my bad side but I believe she asked this with the most sincere request because Christ never rebukes her like you remember he rebukes the disciples he rebukes them all the time but he never rebukes James and John's mother because I believe it wasn't sincere desire and he said to her what wilt thou now notice she had the right approach I don't like to preach a message on approach before she asked her request what'd she do worship why do we sing before we pray worship in other words like that song Lord nago sings first right children I think it says something like this before I I'll raise my hands before I do what can you help me yeah right yeah something like that before anger right before I lift my request I'm gonna lift my heart to you in other words I'm gonna tell you I loved you before I ask you because then even if you don't say yes you know that I love you even if you don't say yes I'll do this Jessie oh yes but Amen I answer this request even if you don't do it you know that I love you and that's what's most important that we love Christ with all of our heart soul mind and strength so that's the approach worship him first then wait I preached a sermon on that few years ago if I don't remember but mostly I weren't here worship first then wait on God look at look at verse 21 and she saith unto Him grant unto these my two sons may sit the one the right hand and the other on the left in my kingdom what a beautiful request for a mother Jesus I'm not asking you for a million dollars tonight oh hey man glory I'm not asking you for brand-new shoes tonight I'm not asking you for a chariot of horses I'm not asking you for material things I'm not asking you for to be more handsome I'm asking you could my children please serve you in such a way that you would place them at your right hand and your left I don't know if I could preach a better thought than that I don't know if parents we could ask a better thing than that let Malachi be such a servant of God that he could do this this this and then let Lydia and my daughter's indication Haman let them be such servants of Christ that they could do this and this and just be such faithful servants to Christ can you think of a better question for a mother to ask her Christ verse 22 but jesus answered said you know not what you asked you said you don't quite understand what you're asking for are you able to drink the cup that I shall drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with and they say to him we are able are you willing to suffer in other words these seats are reserved for those who suffer the most because no one can suffer like Christ right no man could ever suffer like him how badly he was beaten and bruised he says okay are you sure you'd understand what you're asking for that means your sons are going to suffer like I suffered and they say yes will suffer and did John suffer yes we talked about that low early burning oil exiled from the this hometown he suffered the next scripture verse 23 and ye and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand on the left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared to my father how many like that answer that's beautiful Jesus says these are given to those in other words God has every every seat predestinated all on church I'm believing I've got one seat up there even brother bang if it's the lowest seat I believe I got a seat up there God's grace I know I'm not on the right in the left but I know I got one up there praise God because I've given my life to Christ and so have you praise God look at verse 24 and when the ten heard it they were moved with joy did I read that right these ten are sitting there watching this mother come up worship him imagine there are some arguments at night and maybe some arm wrestling that night in the in the tent the Bible said they were moved with indignation that means sore displeasure you ever had a sore you ever been sore this pleasure means I'm not happy with you I have no pleasure in you I'm not happy with you at all and the asking of this question caused these ten just really get upset with these two other ones that sound like a real happy family Church to you does it sound like a it sound like a church it we should does that sound like a church we should have here no the preachers are divided against and everybody's not a preacher the sisters are divided against the brothers let me say like this tonight the Asians are divided against everybody else right you understand what I'm saying you see how that can be an issue this was one family against the others can you see that James John their mother one family against the other families oh it's the pastor's family against everybody else you see that see how easy that can be and these all proved they didn't have the right kind of love for each other how many want the right kind of love for each other let's stand to our feet I'll just stop right there by God's grace I went over about 10 minutes pardon me I hope the Word of God was a blessing to you I love these things church I love these nuggets of the word they really are to me they really are life to me because as I go along serving the Lord this is my meat my meat is the Word of God Jesus said to do the will of him that sent me to Akron of him that sent you to Akron God give me virtue tomorrow work even more give me such a brotherly kindness I can love everybody the church writer I love everybody I won't put brothers above sisters I will put preachers and lures the song player and the piano player I will put him above everybody else I'll put up with a special singer you know Hosea and you know I'll throw the special people I'll treat them a little better than everybody else I'll put black against white that's Oh Peter did Peter did you against Gentile and that church was after the Holy Ghost came see how we got it we'll just watch our lives and be careful and be sanctified aren't you glad for sanctification hey Scott let's just our heads here knows you by your head think about Lord which one don't want you add to my life tonight if you just we did that on the Sunday night where the children pray and just name one of them Jason I mean you might name two or three but can you think of one would you raise your hand when you got one in your mind so I notice then I want to start praying okay I know I'm gonna pray for patience you pray for patience for me would you choose to be more steadfast and just know that God is with us he's gonna save he's gonna do what he said did I'll pray for you please before he just pray for me pray for somebody around you why don't the Marriott will let me put hand on your your loved ones of shoulder you do that or just join hands they're children you can pray for your patient but your hands on one another pray for now let's do it real sincerely okay because Jesus wants to add these virtues to our lives and I want more Christ in my life Heavenly Father or this message

another add the virtue that each one's praying and thinking of in their mind right now lord please add that to their life Lord oh that would be the greatest addition Lord we could have our lives would be more of your power more of your character in our lives I think I'm trembling or just not your presence of God of how you broke this word to us tonight Lord God and Lord as I said my children see my faults my wife sees my faults but Lord I'm assured of this just as you freely forgave Peter and all the disciples for their lack of virtue for their failures just as you can freely forgave them you'll freely forgive those tonight at Bride of Christ fellowship who are willing to ask for so what I asked forgive me Lord x my virtues failed times my patience has failed Lord that's what I really need
