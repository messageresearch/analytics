[0:00] be here by God's
[0:04] grace uh greet the saints greet you
[0:08] Saints from the Saints back home and
[0:11] from Brother Jim sending us
[0:14] greetings I don't know whose Bible had
[0:16] I'll just set it down is this is this
[0:19] yours brother no okay I'll just say it
[0:23] there don't let him forget it he'll need
[0:25] it so Genesis chapter N9 starting in the
[0:29] uh verse eight
[0:35] I can't remember the last time I was
[0:36] here sorry I missed last week I wanted
[0:38] to come but I was could to see by the
[0:41] back uh I had to be at the home Church
[0:44] be at my post of Duty but uh I'm sure
[0:47] you sure you had a good service last
[0:50] week but
[0:53] uh it must have been what a month or so
[0:55] ago
[0:57] anyhow thank the Lord for getting us
[0:59] through uh the whoop cough you know that
[1:01] that's kind of a strange thing that uh I
[1:03] was battling that for a little bit in
[1:05] September and I just thank the Lord for
[1:07] his healing so if I'd get into a
[1:10] coughing fit my apologies I'm still
[1:13] trying to get over it but by God's grace
[1:14] we're still healed no matter what the
[1:16] symptoms say or anything but his word is
[1:19] true so uh let us start Genesis
[1:22] 9 uh verse
[1:25] 8 and it
[1:28] says and God SP akake unto Noah and to
[1:31] his sons with him saying and I beheld or
[1:34] excuse me and I behold I establish my
[1:36] Covenant with you and with your seed
[1:39] after you and with every living creature
[1:41] that is with you of the fowl of the
[1:43] cattle and of every beast of the Earth
[1:46] with you from all that go out of the Ark
[1:48] to every beast of the earth and I will
[1:51] establish my Covenant with you neither
[1:53] shall All Flesh be cut off anymore By
[1:56] the Waters of a flood neither shall
[1:58] there anymore be a flood to destroy the
[2:01] Earth and God said this is the token of
[2:04] the Covenant which I make between me and
[2:06] you and every living creature that is
[2:09] with you for Perpetual
[2:11] Generations I do set my bow in the cloud
[2:14] and it shall be for a token of a
[2:16] covenant between me and the
[2:18] Earth and it shall come to pass when I
[2:21] bring a cloud over the Earth that the
[2:23] bow shall be seen in the
[2:27] cloud and I will remember my Covenant
[2:30] which is between me and you and every
[2:32] living creature of All Flesh and the
[2:35] waters shall no more become a flood uh
[2:37] To Destroy All Flesh and the bow shall
[2:40] be in the cloud and pay attention to
[2:42] this part it says and the bow shall be
[2:45] in the cloud and I will look upon it
[2:47] this is the Lord speaking and I will
[2:49] look upon it that I may remember the
[2:52] Everlasting Covenant between God and
[2:54] every Liv every living creature of All
[2:57] Flesh that is upon the Earth and God
[2:59] said unto Noah this is the token of the
[3:01] Covenant which I have established
[3:03] between me and All Flesh that is upon
[3:06] the Earth let's look to the Lord in
[3:08] prayer heavenly father as we read this
[3:12] scripture Lord we know that you have set
[3:13] this Covenant uh in Noah's day but Lord
[3:16] we know we have a a different Covenant
[3:18] in in our day but uh but one thing that
[3:22] Rings true is that you always uh you
[3:24] always stay faithful to your Covenant
[3:26] Lord we know that it's man that breaks
[3:28] the the covenants that everyone that
[3:30] you've established but Lord I just thank
[3:32] you so much that we have this this
[3:34] Covenant in this day that that no man uh
[3:37] can make go away no man can erase it no
[3:39] man can make it disappear but Lord
[3:42] You've you've made that Everlasting
[3:43] Covenant with us with the with the uh
[3:46] the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:48] and we thank you for that oh God for
[3:50] Lord the you are the unchangeable we are
[3:52] the ones that have to come changing unto
[3:54] your ways father we pray that you would
[3:56] be with us as we Minister this morning I
[3:58] pray that something would be said said
[3:59] to be a blessing and a help to my
[4:02] brothers and sisters here father we we
[4:04] just ask for for your spirit to take
[4:06] charge here this morning and take charge
[4:09] over my lips that I would speak what you
[4:11] had once spoken and nothing else father
[4:13] we ask all this and our trust is in you
[4:15] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[4:19] may be
[4:21] seated excuse
[4:26] me I'm just going to get right settled
[4:29] right in here so I don't even know why
[4:31] we wear them out because we take them
[4:34] off but we know this you know
[4:37] presentability so we want to present
[4:40] ourselves as uh as a good Steward you
[4:44] know be presentable but uh what I'd like
[4:47] to speak on this morning is a focus upon
[4:50] the right
[4:52] object so we see as we read through
[4:54] Genesis that uh this Covenant uh is left
[4:58] with something that the natural could
[4:59] see we we see that he's talking about
[5:01] the bow the bow is in the sky we know
[5:03] the rainbow is of different colors right
[5:06] but this is this is something that man
[5:08] can look up in the clouds and and we can
[5:10] be in awe of you know because it's
[5:12] beautiful you know uh so we see an array
[5:15] of different colors and the way that it
[5:17] bends you know that's just the way that
[5:19] the natural happening is uh with with
[5:22] light and water droplets but this is
[5:24] something that man can see but as we
[5:26] read into the scripture it's also
[5:28] something that God will look upon so not
[5:30] just something that we could look upon
[5:31] but it's something that he can look upon
[5:33] as well so he's going to remember his
[5:36] promise but we know that every every
[5:39] promise that was broken was not by God
[5:41] but it was it was broken by man man has
[5:43] broken every Covenant throughout the
[5:45] scriptures why because of because of
[5:47] their own lust or they got distracted or
[5:50] because of their own uh greed or
[5:52] whatever it might be because man is a
[5:56] man is full of faults and failures right
[5:58] we're not perfect but we know that god
[5:59] is perfect
[6:02] so uh you know in order to see the
[6:06] rainbow you need like I said you need
[6:08] Water and Light so uh not necessarily
[6:12] rain yeah it's nice to see a rainbow
[6:14] after it rains and the Sun comes out
[6:16] that's generally when you see the
[6:17] rainbow but you don't always need that
[6:19] condition to see a rainbow all you need
[6:21] is is the water droplets and a in a
[6:23] certain amount of light so uh that's the
[6:26] mixture of what a rainbow is is uh
[6:30] uh Light and Water oh
[6:32] my so we know that that Jesus is the
[6:35] light of the world and it's by the the
[6:37] water washing of the water of the word
[6:38] so it's it's by God's power it's it's
[6:41] nothing that man has made man didn't
[6:43] make the rainbow God made the rainbow no
[6:45] matter how creative man could be to uh
[6:48] draw pictures and depict it as best as
[6:50] they can the uh painters have painted it
[6:52] for years they've Tred to get pictures
[6:54] of it you ever take a picture of
[6:55] something it just doesn't justify the
[6:57] situation at that point you just can't
[7:00] capture that Beauty on on a camera you
[7:02] you yeah a Nikon whatever with the best
[7:06] that you can get might take great
[7:07] pictures but it's not going to capture
[7:10] the actual reality of the beauty at that
[7:12] moment it does the best it can but we
[7:16] can never match what God could create
[7:18] amen
[7:19] so uh uh I know how the rainbows formed
[7:24] uh but to me uh we know that it's Water
[7:26] and Light to me it's just a majestic uh
[7:29] thing that happens you know who who can
[7:30] deny its beauty who doesn't run outside
[7:33] and and when somebody sees a rainbow hey
[7:35] come out and look at the rainbow you
[7:37] know because it's a beautiful site you
[7:39] know uh I don't know how many people go
[7:41] to a beach or to a setting just to see a
[7:44] Setting Sun a sunset I love sunsets I
[7:46] love sunrises some people don't wake up
[7:48] early enough to see a sunrise I wake up
[7:50] early enough to see a sunrise and I I'm
[7:53] going to tell people if you're not
[7:54] waking up early enough you're missing
[7:56] something truly beautiful you know but
[7:58] that's just the way that I am you can
[7:59] call me crazy you can call me wimpy or
[8:01] whatever but it's not going to change
[8:02] the fact that I love Sunrise sunsets you
[8:04] know I just love uh what God can set
[8:07] before our eyes right so uh you know a
[8:10] rainbow is a magnificent thing right so
[8:13] but what about a double rainbow that's
[8:16] that's kind of a rarity but it's it's
[8:18] it's also an awesome thing to go out and
[8:20] see but you know just because you see
[8:22] one rainbow and you see a double rainbow
[8:25] it's going to be an infinite amount of
[8:27] of rainbows right uh so it it's going to
[8:31] continue on it's just what we can see
[8:34] that that's all we can see with the
[8:35] naked eye but the more moisture you have
[8:37] and the more sunlight you have uh the
[8:39] more rainbows you're going to have and
[8:41] it's uh just a pretty awesome thing
[8:45] so uh I'm not an artist I'm not a
[8:49] scientist I'm not great with with colors
[8:52] they told me that I'm color blind but I
[8:53] could see the colors just fine you know
[8:56] but uh I I guess I'm I'm more color
[8:59] deficient but what colors I can see and
[9:01] I think I could see them all I just
[9:03] don't know what to call them all you
[9:05] know you kind of get into the into into
[9:07] the violets and in the uh the the what
[9:10] is it fuchsia or fascia I can't remember
[9:12] what it is but I don't know what those
[9:14] colors are I guess because I'm ignorant
[9:15] on those things I know red red white
[9:17] blue yellow and all those other colors
[9:19] the basic colors I could tell you what
[9:21] color it is but uh but again I
[9:24] absolutely love the sunsets I I could
[9:26] see the mauve I could see the rose color
[9:28] I could see see the the yellows the
[9:30] oranges the teals all in the sunset and
[9:32] it's just a beautiful thing I know I'm
[9:34] kind of getting off a little bit but I'm
[9:36] just trying to get a little comfortable
[9:38] so
[9:41] uh but uh I'll see uh getting back on
[9:44] the the double rainbow is uh when you
[9:47] get a double rainbow it it is a
[9:49] reflection of itself in an inverted
[9:52] pattern let see uh if if I remember
[9:55] right when you look at one rainbow if
[9:57] you see the double rainbow the colors
[9:58] are going to going to be in a different
[9:59] order if I remember right so I I could
[10:02] be wrong with that but I'm I'm pretty
[10:03] sure that's the way it goes so but it's
[10:05] a reflection of itself so uh but as I
[10:11] said I love to see those things but it's
[10:13] the representation of of what I enjoy
[10:16] probably the most of that it represents
[10:19] a a covenant between God and man so do
[10:21] we still live in that type of Co in a
[10:24] covenant that was a covenant for Noah
[10:26] but still it's a covenant as far as he
[10:28] won't destroy the Earth Earth with the
[10:29] flood right so again uh bear with me I'm
[10:34] I'm going to read some of this because I
[10:35] can't remember everything uh I know some
[10:38] people don't like when ministers read
[10:40] read the notes or whatever but if that's
[10:41] okay with you I'm just going to read
[10:43] some of it so now a rainbow consists of
[10:46] Water and Light that reflects through
[10:48] the water droplets much like a prism if
[10:50] if you know what a prism is uh light
[10:54] bends as it passes through a convex
[10:56] object a convex object is something
[10:59] that's slightly spherical you know like
[11:01] our our our lens is a a
[11:05] convex uh object it's it's spherical uh
[11:09] such as a a lens or water drop this is
[11:12] called
[11:13] refraction each color that you see has a
[11:15] different wavelength uh hence you hence
[11:18] the layered look okay so red doesn't
[11:21] bend very easily that's why it's at the
[11:22] top uh
[11:24] Violet uh Violet bends very easily and
[11:28] that's why it's a at the bottom because
[11:29] it could Bend more so uh it it's pretty
[11:33] neat of how we just think that we see we
[11:37] take it for granted that we could see
[11:38] but we don't understand why we see we
[11:41] just know that we're able to see kind of
[11:43] much like the scripture we can't explain
[11:45] why we understand certain scriptures and
[11:47] and sometimes it's hard to explain to
[11:49] somebody and they don't see what we see
[11:53] right and so that's where we we can't
[11:56] take our our sight not just our natural
[11:58] natural sight but our spiritual sight we
[12:01] can't take it for granted amen so we
[12:03] just appreciate we we thank the Lord for
[12:05] what he's given us and we thank him for
[12:07] the ability to see so because if we
[12:10] didn't have the the ability to see and I
[12:13] I feel bad for blind people you know
[12:15] deaf people and I I pray that nobody
[12:17] would ever have to go through that but
[12:19] uh they miss out on this on the beauty
[12:22] that we see but uh but they kind of make
[12:26] up for in other areas that they their
[12:28] senses are heightened in other areas
[12:31] right so uh see where we're weak in one
[12:34] area we should be getting strong in in
[12:37] in in other areas amen so that we can
[12:40] contact the
[12:42] Lord excuse me now each of us also has a
[12:46] limit to our bending amen so kind of
[12:49] like the Violet it bends more the red
[12:51] doesn't Bend as easily but same with
[12:54] people we don't bend we don't flex you
[12:56] you could say in the natural you I'm
[12:59] kind of older I don't flex the way that
[13:00] I used to flex and I'm getting a little
[13:03] bit heavier so now I have to hold my
[13:05] breath the time my shoes sometimes you
[13:07] know it's not like when I was a little
[13:09] bit lighter a little bit more flexible
[13:11] things are a little bit more difficult
[13:12] y'all just wait young ones so all I all
[13:16] I got to say is stay flexible keep
[13:18] stretching and and stay as flexible as
[13:20] you can but he will not uh but he did
[13:23] promise that we would bend so much that
[13:25] we wouldn't break see you see the
[13:27] rainbow in the sky it bends so much but
[13:28] it doesn't break right so the same thing
[13:31] with us in our lives God works in our
[13:33] lives we go through trials we go through
[13:35] Temptations we go through hard times but
[13:37] he bends us so much but he has a promise
[13:39] that we won't break right so uh for he
[13:44] is a propitiation of our sins he is the
[13:46] the appeasement of our sins he is our
[13:48] our peace right so we sing that song
[13:51] that he is our peace I like that song
[13:53] but uh but we get into the situations
[13:55] where it seems that that it gets so dark
[13:58] and and too dark that there's there's no
[14:00] way out you know sometimes uh yeah even
[14:03] as a Believer we get into situations
[14:05] where uh you get your mind off of
[14:07] something under the wrong thing and then
[14:10] it seems like you you you've kind of
[14:11] Fallen away and you can't come back you
[14:14] know but there's there's no you can't go
[14:17] so far to where God can't bring you back
[14:19] and and if and a Believer I I truly
[14:22] believe that believer can't go as far
[14:24] because you might be thinking in your
[14:25] mind that there is a sin unto death
[14:27] there is a sin that you can't come back
[14:28] back from and that's blasphemy and I
[14:30] truly believe that a that a a True
[14:32] Believer will not commit blasphemy
[14:34] because the Holy Ghost cannot speak
[14:36] against itself right so there's for a
[14:39] Believer there's there's a spot to where
[14:41] you can't go so far to where God can't
[14:43] bring you back so you might not be you
[14:45] might be in the on the Mountaintop right
[14:47] now but what about when it comes into
[14:48] the time of the valley so we've got to
[14:51] prep ourselves for the times of the
[14:53] valleys we got to prep ourselves for the
[14:55] time of of the hardships and but he is
[14:58] our way maker amen so see the the bow is
[15:02] there uh for God and Mankind as I said
[15:05] that as we read the scripture that he
[15:07] looks upon the bow and we look upon the
[15:09] bow but we so it's uh there for God to
[15:12] look upon it's there for us to look upon
[15:14] you know uh and kind of coming um
[15:18] everybody's looking for something right
[15:21] uh some are looking for better jobs some
[15:22] are just looking for jobs period some
[15:24] are looking for better jobs uh some are
[15:27] looking for better vehicles you know
[15:29] some might like Ford and some might like
[15:31] Chevy but I'm kind of a Toyota guy but
[15:34] uh because I've had Fords and never had
[15:35] a Chevy so I I've said some things about
[15:38] Chevys but uh I can't really say much
[15:41] because I've never had the experience in
[15:42] a Chevy but I have had an experience in
[15:44] a Toyota that is uh better than what I
[15:48] you what used to be my beloved Fords you
[15:51] know but uh but hey some people are just
[15:54] got to get something to get around right
[15:56] so uh I'm not here to float on anything
[15:59] so bear with me on that but my point is
[16:02] is somebody's uh somebody everybody's
[16:04] looking for something so some there
[16:07] might be some looking for husband wife
[16:09] some somebody might be looking for uh
[16:11] just a uh a future husband uh future
[16:15] wife whatever it might be somebody might
[16:17] be looking for uh wrong things somebody
[16:19] might be looking for uh the right things
[16:22] but in the wrong way you know um there
[16:25] was a man in the Bible uh his name was
[16:27] Simeon
[16:29] uh if you would turn with me to Luke
[16:31] Chapter 2 and 25 now see uh he was
[16:34] looking for something he was looking for
[16:36] the Messiah right so uh as we read here
[16:40] in the Luke 2 and
[16:44] 25 it says and behold there was a man in
[16:47] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[16:50] same man was just and devout waiting for
[16:53] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[16:55] Ghost was upon him and it wait a second
[16:59] the Holy Ghost was upon him but Jesus
[17:00] was just
[17:02] born so where did the Holy Ghost come
[17:05] from see some people have it in their
[17:07] mind so much that the Holy Ghost is just
[17:09] a new testament thing the Holy Ghost is
[17:11] not just a new testament thing right the
[17:14] Holy Ghost always has been the same
[17:17] yesterday today and forever see the Holy
[17:19] Ghost has always been there the
[17:21] difference is is that when Jesus was
[17:23] ascended on high right so and then the
[17:26] magnification came to where he can
[17:28] indwell in people right so uh the Holy
[17:32] Ghost is not a a new thing as as as we
[17:35] read here that Jesus was just born in
[17:37] the flesh so uh and the Holy Ghost was
[17:41] upon him and it was revealed unto him by
[17:43] the holy ghost that he should not see
[17:45] death before he had seen the Lord's
[17:47] Christ and he came by the spirit into
[17:50] the temple and when the parents brought
[17:51] in the Child Jesus to do for him after
[17:53] the the custom of the law they took him
[17:56] up and then he then took he him
[17:59] that's a tongue twister then took he him
[18:02] up in his arms and blessed God and said
[18:04] Lord now let us thou thy servant depart
[18:07] in peace according to Thy word for mine
[18:10] eyes have seen thy
[18:12] salvation which thou has prepared before
[18:14] the face of all people a light to
[18:17] lighten the Gentiles now see we're the
[18:18] Gentiles so we're we're we're grateful
[18:20] we thank God for for the light to come
[18:22] under the Gentiles see and a light to
[18:25] lighten the Gentiles and the glory of
[18:27] thy People Israel
[18:29] the Covenant when he gave to
[18:34] Noah for the rainbow was for him between
[18:39] him and God and all the creatures in the
[18:42] earth that includes
[18:45] us so John the Baptist was another one
[18:48] let's turn to Matthew uh 11 verse one it
[18:51] says and it came to pass when Jesus had
[18:54] made an end of commanding his 12
[18:56] disciples he departed then to to teach
[18:58] and to preach in their cities now when
[19:00] John had heard in the prison The Works
[19:02] of of Christ he sent two of his
[19:04] disciples and said unto him art thou uh
[19:08] he that should come or do we look for
[19:10] another see uh John the Baptist being in
[19:12] prison he started having his doubts when
[19:15] he should have known he knew but even
[19:18] even even a believer has a time where
[19:22] they get into a spot of
[19:24] doubt they get into a spot of uh does
[19:27] God really exist
[19:28] even though a True
[19:30] Believer so when you get into that don't
[19:32] think that you're that you're so lost
[19:35] I'm not saying that you'll get there but
[19:37] we pray that we never get into those
[19:38] situations but we always want to stay on
[19:40] the Mountaintop right but when you get
[19:42] into that situation don't lose heart
[19:45] don't think that there's there's no a
[19:47] point of no return for there is a point
[19:48] of
[19:50] return there is don't ever let the devil
[19:52] put that in your mind that you that you
[19:54] can't come to God just because you you
[19:56] thought of something wrong that you
[19:58] misunderstood a scripture somewhere
[20:01] right we don't all have the full
[20:04] understanding you because even in
[20:06] Corinthians uh in Corinthians it's
[20:08] talking about uh uh they they had their
[20:10] arguments about who who could speak in
[20:12] tongues Who had who could prophesy and
[20:14] who was better at this and who was
[20:16] better at that and we see that in in the
[20:18] in the same day of Pentecost when
[20:20] Pentecost came is that they thought they
[20:22] kept saying that the the evidence of the
[20:24] Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues which
[20:26] is the least of the gifts
[20:30] right
[20:32] amen excuse
[20:35] me verse three and but what happens is
[20:39] they get their mind off of God so much
[20:41] that they get lost they just have to
[20:43] find the road map to get back verse
[20:45] three and it says and said unto him art
[20:47] thou uh art thou he that should come or
[20:50] do we look look for another and Jesus
[20:52] answered and said unto them go and show
[20:54] John again those things which ye do hear
[20:57] and see go testify of what I've done for
[21:01] different people go and
[21:04] testify testifying has to do with
[21:06] speaking and showing because the word of
[21:09] God comes with power and demonstration
[21:11] right but sometimes we get into that uh
[21:15] I I can't I can't think of his name
[21:16] right off that right off the bat he was
[21:18] a judge but he was asking if if God be
[21:20] for us where are all the Miracles
[21:24] Gideon so sometimes we get into that if
[21:27] if if God Is A Healer where is my
[21:31] healing if God is my provider where's
[21:34] where's the money that I
[21:36] need you know we just get into those
[21:38] situations just like Gideon said if God
[21:41] before us where are all the Miracles
[21:43] where are all these promises that that
[21:44] the Lord has given but see is our Focus
[21:47] so much on the Miracle or the miracle
[21:51] maker but see we we get so lost because
[21:54] our Focus gets off the miracle
[21:56] maker that we're looking unto men for to
[21:59] do something and see if we have the
[22:01] gifts are are we praying for the gifts
[22:03] to be in the church or or are we saying
[22:06] hey so and so you you need to speak in
[22:07] tongues let's get this going learn a
[22:09] language so you can speak in tongues so
[22:10] people could think you I'm I'm telling
[22:14] you you know just because somebody
[22:16] speaks in tongues doesn't mean that it's
[22:17] a holy ghost because somebody could know
[22:20] another language I I know very little uh
[22:23] Spanish but I'm not able to tell you to
[22:26] to get up and and and
[22:28] say speak sentences in Spanish it's just
[22:30] not in me I could say different words I
[22:32] have an understanding of different words
[22:34] but I can't speak it fluently so if I
[22:36] was up here and the Holy Ghost moved in
[22:38] this service today and I started
[22:39] speaking in tongues I'm telling you
[22:41] that's going to be the Holy Ghost
[22:43] because I don't know I don't know
[22:44] another language fluently but you got to
[22:46] be careful with people who already know
[22:48] a fluent language is it the Holy Spirit
[22:51] or is it something in the
[22:54] flesh see that's where we can't look at
[22:56] carnality but we have to look look at
[22:58] the spiritual things behind it and isn't
[23:00] it something where the instruction is
[23:01] given don't have the high people or the
[23:04] Highly Educated people to make judgment
[23:07] because if those things happen you
[23:08] should have a judge in the church
[23:11] right but it it's not the high people or
[23:13] the high knowledgeable people it's not
[23:16] the best dressed person but it's the the
[23:18] least among the Brethren that is that
[23:21] they're called to to make the Judgment
[23:24] upon that right see it kind of takes the
[23:26] respect out of persons right out of the
[23:27] way amen amen sorry the little Sidetrack
[23:34] there verse five it says the blind
[23:37] receive their sight and the lame walk
[23:39] the lepers are cleansed and the deaf
[23:41] hear the dead are raised up and the poor
[23:44] have the gospel preached preached to
[23:45] them and blessed is he whosoever shall
[23:49] not be offended of me that's the
[23:52] Forgotten
[23:53] beatitude blessed is he who shall not be
[23:56] uh who shall not be offended in me you
[23:58] see that's that's where it lies is do I
[24:01] have the Holy Ghost or do I not when the
[24:04] word comes and it's preached and you you
[24:06] get all prickly inside and and you're
[24:08] resistant to the Holy Ghost the Holy
[24:11] Ghost isn't going to resist the Holy
[24:13] Ghost but the Holy Ghost is going to
[24:16] receive the Holy Ghost right and the
[24:19] things of the Holy
[24:22] Ghost see if you find that you're
[24:25] offended you know the question or people
[24:27] will make the statement uh if I was
[24:30] alive back in Jesus's day I I I would
[24:33] believe Jesus but the way you treat him
[24:35] today is the same way that you would
[24:37] have treated him back in that day right
[24:40] so however you view Christ today is the
[24:42] same way that you would have viewed him
[24:44] then and if you are offended to him you
[24:46] would have been right among the people
[24:47] that crucified
[24:51] him oh
[24:54] my let's turn to John Chapter 19 Verse
[24:57] verse
[25:01] 28 see even looking for Jesus because
[25:06] that's what the bride should be doing
[25:07] the the believer should be looking for
[25:09] Jesus is coming right but even the ones
[25:12] that pierced him are going to have to
[25:14] look upon him because the scripture says
[25:17] every knee every knee shall bow every
[25:21] every mouth shall confess so could you
[25:24] imagine being one of those people that
[25:25] were there on that day of the
[25:27] crucifixion the one shouting crucify him
[25:29] crucify him could you imagine having to
[25:32] be the one one of them and looking Upon
[25:35] Jesus later could you imagine the the
[25:37] feeling and the thoughts and the
[25:39] heartache that they would have once they
[25:40] realize what they
[25:42] did John chapter 28 says after this
[25:45] Jesus knowing that all things were now
[25:47] accomplished that the scripture might be
[25:49] fulfilled saith I thirst now there was a
[25:52] set there was a set a vessel uh of
[25:56] vinegar and they filled a sponged with
[25:58] vinegar and put it upon his up and put
[26:00] it to his mouth when Jesus therefore had
[26:02] received the vinegar he said it is
[26:04] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[26:06] up the ghost the Jews therefore because
[26:08] it was the preparation that the body
[26:10] should not remain upon the cross on the
[26:12] Sabbath day for the Sabbath day was a
[26:15] high day besought
[26:18] pilate that their legs might be broken
[26:20] and that they might be taken away then
[26:22] came the soldiers and break the legs of
[26:24] the first and of the other which was
[26:25] crucified with him but when they came to
[26:28] Jesus and saw that he was dead already
[26:30] they break not his legs but one of the
[26:32] soldiers with a spear pierced aside
[26:34] forth withth came there out blood and
[26:37] water and he that saw it bear record and
[26:40] his record is true and he knoweth that
[26:42] he saith and he knoweth that he saith
[26:45] true that you might believe for these
[26:47] things were done that the scripture
[26:49] should be fulfilled a bone of him should
[26:51] shall not be broken and again another
[26:54] scripture saith they shall look on him
[26:56] whom they pierce
[27:01] but see we see that the scripture was
[27:03] fulfilled right so the people knowing
[27:06] what the scripture says and then the
[27:07] situation is there they get to they were
[27:10] able to see what took what just took
[27:12] place and then mindful of the scripture
[27:14] so when we get into our into our wo is
[27:16] me State you know when we get so low
[27:19] just think of the scripture the
[27:21] scripture said this the scripture said
[27:24] this and you start feeling a little bit
[27:26] uh a little bit better a little bit
[27:28] encouraged a little bit more motivated
[27:31] well the scripture said I could be
[27:32] picked up again see the scripture says a
[27:34] righteous man follows seventh times but
[27:36] yet he gets back up right so we we look
[27:39] upon these things but imagine being
[27:42] there in that day when you see the
[27:44] scripture being fulfilled wait they
[27:45] didn't break his legs what did the I
[27:47] remember the scripture said a bone of a
[27:49] bone in his body wouldn't be
[27:52] broken they said that they were
[27:54] crucified one could you imagine the pain
[27:57] the anger anguish the despair that they
[27:58] would feel just looking Upon Jesus on
[28:01] that cross seeing scripture fulfilled
[28:04] and they were apart on the other side I
[28:07] couldn't imagine being in that position
[28:09] but someday they're going to have to
[28:11] look upon that someday they're going to
[28:13] have to face that now see some will look
[28:16] with with gladness where others will
[28:18] they would look with with sorrow and
[28:21] repent see some people might look on on
[28:24] on Christ what I mean by that is some
[28:25] people at that time might have looked
[28:27] upon Christ and saying good that Jew is
[28:29] dead you know he caused so many problems
[28:32] what problems did he cause besides
[28:35] healing people he might have been taking
[28:37] money from
[28:38] doctors he might have been taking money
[28:40] from lawyers but he was setting things
[28:42] in order he was doing Godly things but
[28:45] yet people can't accept the good things
[28:48] and the servant isn't above his master
[28:50] where we would have to do the same
[28:53] amen but some some people will look upon
[28:56] death with gladness
[28:58] some people look on it in
[28:59] sorrow amen do do I don't know if
[29:02] anybody's seen the movie passion but I
[29:05] remember when that movie The Passion uh
[29:07] came out uh with meel with Mel Gibson
[29:09] and uh or uh he directed
[29:13] it but after I I heard stories I I think
[29:16] I saw it on the news I can't remember
[29:17] read it in in newspaper articles but
[29:19] there was there was there were Tales of
[29:23] people leaving the movie theater crying
[29:26] and repenting
[29:27] because some of them realized they were
[29:29] they were screaming because they
[29:31] realized that he did that for me it was
[29:35] my sin that put him on that cross and
[29:37] those people might have never stepped
[29:39] into a church right but just the
[29:42] realization with when they had that
[29:44] Revelation they they
[29:46] realized that was me that I was the
[29:50] reason for that and it happened over
[29:52] 2,000 years ago so how could they how
[29:55] could they put themselves in that kind
[29:57] of in in that situation where that they
[30:00] did that for or he did that for me how
[30:02] could they even relate to something like
[30:04] that because even brother brand talked
[30:07] about and people have a hard time with
[30:08] this when he talked about uh George
[30:10] Washington Abraham Lincoln and and the
[30:13] different ones as Americans the
[30:15] representation was
[30:17] there
[30:19] see people have a hard time with it
[30:21] because they're saying oh he's saying he
[30:24] was back in time that he's making
[30:25] himself an eternal being that's not not
[30:27] what the brother was saying he was
[30:29] saying as an
[30:31] American I had I had representation back
[30:34] as an American when George Washington
[30:36] crossed the
[30:37] Delaware I have representation of and
[30:40] and I have to deal with all the
[30:41] heartache and all the Sorrows of what
[30:44] Americans did I have to take the good
[30:46] with the bad because when people look
[30:49] upon us As Americans they might know
[30:51] some of their history that's what that's
[30:53] what they're going to look upon so if if
[30:55] we had that representation as American
[30:56] citizen back then and that wasn't that
[30:59] far ago they these people realize the
[31:02] representation that they had over 2,000
[31:04] years
[31:05] ago
[31:07] oh but see when Israel was in the
[31:10] wilderness their focus became uh
[31:12] distracted from God and then they spoke
[31:14] against God right but see people are
[31:16] looking for for healing if if God if God
[31:19] Is A Healer where is my healing and then
[31:21] they get upset because they don't get
[31:22] their healing they're looking at the
[31:24] wrong thing and then they start speaking
[31:26] evil against God saying well God doesn't
[31:30] exist and that's where you get people
[31:32] leaving the church because of some
[31:34] offense not that not that God doesn't
[31:36] exist anymore but something in in their
[31:39] in their life didn't line up something
[31:42] where they have a misconception or a
[31:44] misunderstanding and now they're upset
[31:46] and now they left God left the church
[31:48] and ultimately they leave God and then
[31:52] if you talk to anybody that's left
[31:54] church they end up speaking against God
[31:57] so it's the same thing with Israel right
[31:59] where they where they started performing
[32:01] their own lust and then they uh they
[32:03] started speaking evil against God and
[32:06] then God sent the serpents and then the
[32:08] people were becoming bitten by the
[32:10] serpents right and then there were a lot
[32:11] of people that died because they were
[32:13] bitten by the serpents but what did
[32:15] Moses do the Lord told Moses to raise up
[32:18] that brass
[32:20] serpent so John chapter 3 and verse
[32:23] verse 14 it says and as Moses lifted up
[32:26] The Serpent and the will Wilderness even
[32:27] so must a son of man be lifted up we
[32:29] know this right because we've read the
[32:31] scriptures we have that understanding
[32:33] but that whosoever believeth in him
[32:35] should not perish but have eternal life
[32:37] see it caused them to look and to focus
[32:41] on a certain
[32:43] object it wasn't the object that they
[32:45] were being that was that that gives the
[32:48] salvation but it was the Act of Faith
[32:50] when they focused their eyes upon the
[32:52] serpent and then they were able to be
[32:54] healed and that was according to what
[32:55] God spok Amen
[32:58] but they had to have the they had to now
[33:00] see uh a Christian can't say uh a
[33:03] Christian a true Christian can't make
[33:05] the statement uh I believe it because I
[33:07] see
[33:08] it if I see it I believe it that's a
[33:11] Thomas way out of it that's a doubting
[33:14] Thomas way out of it but a True Believer
[33:16] cannot make that kind of a statement
[33:18] because we walk by faith we see God by
[33:21] faith we don't see God through our
[33:23] carnal
[33:25] understanding so it wasn't if wasn't the
[33:27] brass serpent so much that's that's uh
[33:30] uh that saved the people but it was the
[33:31] Act of Faith when they looked upon it so
[33:34] the same with Christ when we look upon
[33:36] him and when we focus on him that's
[33:38] where salvation lies because he is the
[33:41] actual salvation amen see Focus what is
[33:45] focus when we hear the word focus our
[33:47] our minds to uh we might think of a
[33:50] camera or a telescope or something like
[33:52] that but there are several meanings of
[33:54] the word focus focus is the the center
[33:58] of Interest or
[34:00] activity an act of concentrating
[34:02] interest or activity on something the
[34:04] state or quality of having or producing
[34:07] clear visual
[34:09] definition of a person or their eyes
[34:12] they adapt to the prevailing level of
[34:15] light and become able to see
[34:19] clearly I kind of like that adapt to the
[34:23] prevailing level of light so whatever
[34:26] whatever level you are in Christ Jesus
[34:28] you could still see right because your
[34:30] your sight is going to adapt and you
[34:32] can't live any higher than what you're
[34:36] living what do you mean by that if
[34:38] you're not getting into the word you're
[34:39] not going to live any higher you know we
[34:41] we know brother brandom said you're not
[34:43] going to live any higher than your
[34:44] pastor so if your pastor's not teaching
[34:45] high things which I I believe he he is I
[34:48] believe he does but but the saying is
[34:50] still is you can only live as high as
[34:52] the pastor because if he's teaching
[34:55] false things if he's if he's not
[34:56] teaching ing you the true things if he
[34:58] just leaves out uh the education if he
[35:00] leaves out the whole word you're not
[35:02] going to live any higher right because
[35:04] you're not going to know the light is
[35:07] not revealed to you you're not going to
[35:08] see light not that brother Jesse could
[35:10] give you Revelation but he can introduce
[35:12] the word to help you see a little bit
[35:14] better amen see it's it's it's when we
[35:17] contact the word the Holy Spirit has to
[35:19] come and make it real to us right
[35:21] because the the holy spirit makes it
[35:23] live he quickens it to us but first we
[35:25] have to be able to hear it then we have
[35:27] to be able to believe
[35:29] it amen but God gives the increase he
[35:32] gives the
[35:33] understanding see Focus means pay
[35:36] particular attention to and it also
[35:38] means to
[35:40] concentrate so we all knew the the
[35:42] definition of Focus right so so if if
[35:46] you think of a camera let's look how uh
[35:48] a a camera lens works okay so bear with
[35:51] me for a few minutes if that's all
[35:55] right a camera's lens operates similarly
[35:59] uh to that of our eyes focusing a lens
[36:02] on one object shuts other things out of
[36:06] picture it blurs or obscures the the
[36:08] objects around the subject some
[36:10] photographers work hard to get the right
[36:12] blend of focus and blur to con uh to
[36:15] concentrate on the particular
[36:18] object y' y'all with me there so
[36:22] photographers actually looked for that
[36:24] kind of a ideal situation where they
[36:27] could focus on one thing and everything
[36:28] else is blurred or they blur the one
[36:31] thing to where everything else is in
[36:33] Focus you could do it either way it's
[36:36] it's all what you're focusing on It's
[36:39] all where you want to put your
[36:43] concentration see there are particular
[36:45] details that they try to capture for the
[36:47] viewer to see now
[36:50] see when you focus on something you tend
[36:52] to blur everything else
[36:55] out so but if you uh if you're looking
[36:59] past something then that's going to be
[37:02] blurred the children might like might
[37:04] like this kind of activity you ever see
[37:06] the double
[37:08] finger to where you can put your fingers
[37:11] together and look at past if you look at
[37:13] the wall you'll see a double finger and
[37:14] then you can bend it and it looks like a
[37:16] a a double-ended finger and you can bend
[37:18] it all which which go ahead you don't
[37:20] don't be embarrass you could try it that
[37:22] way you see what I'm talking
[37:24] about but if you focus on the wall it
[37:27] looks like you got a third finger there
[37:28] in the middle but if you focus on your
[37:31] two fingers you see two fingers and I'm
[37:33] seeing two sisters back there but I know
[37:35] that there's only one sister sitting in
[37:37] the back
[37:38] there but it's all where you put your
[37:40] focus of what you see and how clearly
[37:43] you see the
[37:45] object have you ever found yourself
[37:47] focusing on something so much that
[37:49] you're not paying attention to anything
[37:50] else around you you know somebody might
[37:52] be calling your name and and you don't
[37:54] hear your
[37:55] name
[37:58] you ever see a camera on autofocus you
[38:01] might have uh here here's a lens here
[38:03] somewhere you might have a little thread
[38:05] here on on this on this lens you know
[38:07] what it's going to focus on that one
[38:09] little fuzzy that just gets into the way
[38:11] and that it's
[38:13] constant trying to focus on that one
[38:15] little thing the same thing in our lives
[38:18] we we're focusing on that that one we
[38:20] can't get any further because we're
[38:21] Focus trying to focus on that one little
[38:23] sin in our lives or we're not cleaning
[38:26] our leg
[38:28] amen so that autofocus it's on what gets
[38:32] into the way it's what brings us down
[38:36] that gets into the way that where we
[38:38] can't see God
[38:40] clearly so on that autofocus it's
[38:43] whatever Target it finds it blurs the
[38:46] surrounding objects you try to get a
[38:49] clear picture of something but there's
[38:51] there's that one little nuisance object
[38:53] that I was talking about the the the
[38:54] little piece of fuzz you know those
[38:56] pesky little uh distractions see that's
[38:58] a distraction to that autofocus because
[39:01] and then you're getting frust focus on
[39:04] that but that's how we get in our lives
[39:06] I'm tired of focusing on this well you
[39:08] got to clean that there has to be a
[39:10] purging there has to be a cleaning take
[39:12] place before you could take a step
[39:14] further you you could get frustrated
[39:16] with that piece of fuzz all day long but
[39:18] until you wipe that clean until you
[39:21] bring it back under the blood of Jesus
[39:23] Christ you're not going to get any
[39:24] further amen you're not going to see God
[39:26] any clear no matter how hard you try
[39:30] because it's going to come right back to
[39:31] that one little
[39:33] piece so it behooves us if we just clear
[39:36] everything
[39:38] out see when you when you start focusing
[39:41] on on on on one thing other things
[39:43] become neglected you start focusing on
[39:45] the things of the world or symptoms in
[39:47] your life your vision of God becomes
[39:54] blurred see
[39:57] you try to get a clear picture of
[39:58] something but that there's that one
[40:00] little nuisance thing that that just
[40:01] gets in the way right see and then it
[40:03] takes our attention away from what's
[40:05] really important like I was talking
[40:08] about the tongues people start focusing
[40:09] on tongues that's not the focus people
[40:12] start focusing on healing that's not the
[40:15] focus these are minimal things but they
[40:18] they want to concentrate on the on the
[40:19] Healer and and I like how that situation
[40:22] when that young girl that blind girl
[40:23] came to brother Brandon she was looking
[40:24] for the healer is you the Healer he said
[40:27] no I'm not the
[40:28] Healer but Jesus Christ is the Healer
[40:32] now see people could say what I what
[40:34] they want to but I really appreciate how
[40:36] he put the Focus On Christ he took it
[40:38] completely off of him and he put it on
[40:41] Christ where do we stand in this day to
[40:43] where we're putting focus on men more
[40:45] than we are of
[40:46] God that ought not to be so our Focus
[40:49] ought to be clear Mark 16 go ye out into
[40:53] the world and preach the gospel amen
[40:57] not preach other men's ideology but go
[41:00] out into the world and preach the
[41:03] gospel that should be our
[41:09] Focus amen see when we get into those
[41:12] situations where we feel that we're all
[41:13] down we feel like kabad we know what
[41:15] kabad means right the glory of the Lord
[41:17] is departed so and then we just get
[41:20] further and further whoa was me who
[41:22] nobody cares about me yes somebody does
[41:24] care about you you just haven't read
[41:26] Stout you haven't cleaned your you
[41:28] haven't cleaned your lens you haven't
[41:29] cleaned to to reach the focal point your
[41:31] focal point got diverted to something
[41:33] else you might say your camera fell down
[41:35] to the ground it's time to pick it up
[41:37] and clean it
[41:39] off
[41:42] amen so you might find yourself calling
[41:44] upon God but he doesn't answer kind of
[41:46] like those those prophets with Elijah
[41:48] right and kind of Elijah was kind of
[41:49] poking fun are they on
[41:52] holiday you know are they on
[41:55] vacation call out louder he might hear
[41:58] you and he was kind of poking fun he was
[42:00] kind of mocking them right but sometimes
[42:02] we feel like that God where are you you
[42:05] know God are you on
[42:11] holiday so you won't oh my it depends on
[42:15] what you're looking at amen so you've
[42:17] got to you've got to look at the word at
[42:19] the right angle so to see the big
[42:21] picture right so here here's a statement
[42:24] uh you've got to look at it at the right
[42:26] angle so it becomes clearer to you see
[42:29] to see a rainbow see anybody can look
[42:31] out and see the rainbow but there's
[42:33] there's a certain way that you see a
[42:35] rainbow what you mean there there's a
[42:37] rule to that yep there there's a rule to
[42:39] that
[42:40] too I'm so tired of rules well that's
[42:44] what we live by yeah so that's just the
[42:47] way things are but anyhow to see a
[42:49] rainbow in the sky the sun has to be at
[42:52] a 42 degree angle or less so we have you
[42:56] have to look at the word at the right
[42:57] angle see you won't see truth if you're
[42:59] not looking at it
[43:01] correctly see light goes through the
[43:03] lens at getting back to the the the to
[43:06] the lens and and the focusing here the
[43:08] light goes through the lens as parallel
[43:10] light rays and remember how the light
[43:12] rays they they Bend you know uh as you
[43:15] see with the rainbow of of the different
[43:17] colors and how each one bends see these
[43:19] Rays uh uh they Bend at a certain angle
[43:23] and these Rays converge they come
[43:24] together to a single point Point called
[43:26] a focal point through all of this that's
[43:29] how you could see a huge object like a
[43:31] mountain see if if you were to stand
[43:33] right there real close to a mountain and
[43:35] you just look through uh a paper towel
[43:38] roll you know cardboard roll you're not
[43:40] going to get to see the whole thing
[43:42] right but if you have if you have a lens
[43:45] set in a certain way you're going to be
[43:47] able to see what's in front of you
[43:50] because it it bends the light and it
[43:51] makes it in a way that you could see a
[43:53] bigger image in a smaller way this is
[43:56] right here this is what brings God into
[43:59] Focus something so big so magnificent
[44:01] and yet we still can't explain them
[44:04] all because God Is So vast this is this
[44:07] is just a a minor part as men were moved
[44:09] by the Holy Ghost they they wrote it
[44:11] down for us you know the inspiration of
[44:13] the Holy Spirit
[44:15] see uh it brings big things into
[44:19] perspective the right amount of light
[44:21] exposure makes a clearer makes a clear
[44:23] Sharper Image the right amount of light
[44:26] exposure the more the more time that we
[44:28] spend with God the more time we read
[44:30] into the word and
[44:32] pray the sharper the image of God comes
[44:35] the light
[44:38] amen the more you abide in the vine the
[44:40] better your perspective the more you see
[44:42] God clearly when the right mixture and
[44:45] exposure to light is achieved All Things
[44:48] become clear it has to be the right
[44:53] atmosphere uh couple more things and uh
[44:56] just bear with
[44:57] me so focal length I'm not a camera
[45:01] expert by any means it's just I I did
[45:03] some
[45:04] research I'm not a scholar I just looked
[45:07] at at some things and I I thought it was
[45:09] pretty neat how a camera lens works
[45:11] because our eye our Natural Eye Works in
[45:14] a very similar way to a camera lens that
[45:16] I think that's how they developed it
[45:17] knowing how the the eye and the pupil
[45:19] and all that works uh so they were able
[45:22] to De develop something and you know
[45:24] through all their their work and and all
[45:26] their knowledge all their all their
[45:28] intellect they still can't make life
[45:31] they can clone they can they can pervert
[45:34] things they can copy things but they
[45:36] cannot create life they're still trying
[45:38] to find that that one little thing to
[45:40] create life they they just can't do
[45:44] it yet anyways but they're they're
[45:46] working hard at it I don't know if
[45:48] they'll ever get there I'm not a prophit
[45:50] to say they'll never do that I I don't
[45:54] know vocal length
[45:56] so we have focal point we have focal
[45:59] length focal length plays a huge part in
[46:01] viewing the object clearly focus is
[46:03] always on a certain distance from the
[46:05] sensor this is talking about the inner
[46:07] workings of of the camera uh the further
[46:10] you are away from God the less you see
[46:12] him as he as he is right so you don't
[46:14] see him moving in your life then you
[46:16] begin to wonder if he even
[46:21] exists but see when you're looking at a
[46:23] big object like the mountain it depends
[46:26] on the length of it and the capability
[46:28] of that lens see it's the capability of
[46:31] the
[46:32] vessel it's not the capability of God
[46:35] it's a capability of the vessel of what
[46:38] they are able to see the focal
[46:41] length but the light uh bends to bring
[46:44] things more into Focus it's all on on
[46:46] angles and light admission light
[46:49] transmission of what the the lens of how
[46:51] much light the lens allows to come in
[46:54] and it is kind of like a mirror and it's
[46:56] also inverted so if you if you didn't
[46:58] have the the inversion you would see
[47:00] everything upside down and that's what
[47:02] they used to see in the cameras until
[47:03] they got things figured out they would
[47:05] actually see people upside down when
[47:07] they look through the
[47:08] lens
[47:10] so knowing that does he not leave the 99
[47:13] sheep just for the one no amen
[47:17] so God has uh uh a different perspective
[47:21] than what we have you
[47:24] know
[47:28] amen so as we read about uh uh focal
[47:33] point focal length you know the uh I'd
[47:36] already said this but I don't want to
[47:38] get redundant I don't want to be
[47:39] repetitive you know because in the time
[47:42] just ticks and then you're going to fall
[47:43] asleep on me you heard this
[47:47] already you know how it
[47:49] goes so on the other other other end of
[47:53] the spectrum the closer you are to God
[47:54] the clearer he becomes right so you've
[47:56] got to abide in the vine so you and the
[47:58] scripture said is if you abide in me I
[48:00] will abide in you so you remember that
[48:04] story about the little boy he was going
[48:06] to the Sunday school teacher to the
[48:07] pastor and and and the different ones
[48:10] into the church into the church have you
[48:12] ever seen God no I've never seen God and
[48:16] then he's just a lowly old I can't
[48:18] remember if he was a farmer but he was a
[48:20] fisherman they were out on a boat it was
[48:21] an older older gentleman know but just a
[48:24] different perspective I that this man
[48:26] had from all the I don't care what
[48:28] everybody else is saying out in the
[48:29] world it's all on how you view Christ
[48:32] it's all on how you view it's all what
[48:34] you're looking
[48:35] at but the man said I see I see God
[48:38] everywhere see it's all in the
[48:40] perspective of the
[48:42] viewer if you can't see
[48:45] God I get to ask and open your eyes
[48:49] youo I could say that uh is as as as
[48:53] harsh as I could well you need to just
[48:55] open your eyes do see God but it's up to
[48:57] God to give you the Revelation I can't
[48:59] make you see something I I was telling
[49:02] uh we we were talking about scripture uh
[49:04] at work one day and this guy was was
[49:07] arguing with me about uh you know uh
[49:10] because I knew somebody uh that had long
[49:12] hair and we said something about it and
[49:17] uh they said it doesn't say anything in
[49:19] the scripture about men having long hair
[49:21] I said yes it does and uh and I couldn't
[49:24] remember because I was a new believer at
[49:25] the time and I asked this this brother
[49:29] there uh he was a Baptist Minister said
[49:31] do you remember where the scripture
[49:33] talks about the hair and he knew where
[49:35] he knew right where it was said oh
[49:37] that's First Corinthians 11 so I showed
[49:39] it to the guy and I had him read it for
[49:42] himself he says oh that's that's talking
[49:45] about you know dressing like a woman and
[49:46] different things like
[49:48] that are you blind you just read
[49:52] it but it's not me that can give him the
[49:56] understanding even though he read it
[49:57] with his own eyes he still didn't have
[50:00] the understanding of it and it's just I
[50:03] said what do you have a and I I was
[50:04] wrong in my spirit because I what do you
[50:07] have a third grade reading education you
[50:08] know and and I shouldn't have been like
[50:10] that but I like I said I was still a new
[50:13] convert a new believer and I just didn't
[50:16] know so that's where we are blessed are
[50:18] our eyes that we can see blessed are our
[50:22] ears that we could hear and blessed is
[50:25] our understanding that we're not
[50:26] offended in him but we could come to him
[50:29] and that we could have that uh that he
[50:31] gives us that
[50:33] understanding see
[50:44] amen I'm just going to look for a spot
[50:47] to kind of close
[50:50] here excuse
[50:54] me ever have people just put you know
[50:57] deliberately put things in your way to
[50:59] try to make you
[51:00] stumble people set road blocks in our
[51:02] ways try to get us to slow down because
[51:06] people are watching us they they
[51:07] deliberately try to put situations in
[51:09] our lives to to get us to uh cuss or get
[51:12] angry or
[51:14] uh what's that word that I'm looking for
[51:17] re renounce or Den renounce Christ you
[51:21] know that that's what they try to do
[51:22] people set roadblocks at our way you
[51:25] know but that's why we press toward the
[51:28] mark of the High Calling we push forward
[51:30] we continue on because people are going
[51:33] to set that we're going to have
[51:34] roadblocks in our lives but we can't
[51:36] focus on that roadblock we have to focus
[51:38] past beyond that roadblock to look to to
[51:41] look keep Christ in view amen so like I
[51:44] was saying earlier when people are sick
[51:46] they they they want to look toward
[51:47] healing but that's that's just the
[51:49] natural way of man we we want to look
[51:51] toward healing so then they're looking
[51:52] for a doctor they're looking for
[51:53] something else there was a king
[51:56] uh I want to say it was ahaziah uh when
[51:59] he became sick he told his his uh his
[52:02] guards or would I guess you could say
[52:05] his peasants but uh he he sent somebody
[52:08] somebody in the court to to go uh seek
[52:11] other gods you know hey call upon such
[52:13] and such God and and see if I can have
[52:14] healing but I think it was Elijah uh is
[52:18] it he said he rebuked him said is there
[52:20] not a God in
[52:21] Israel so why are you looking somewhere
[52:24] else are we not belies so why do we look
[52:26] to some other entity or try to look at
[52:29] some other deity when we know the one
[52:30] and true deity see that's that's the
[52:33] problem is uh no wonder the scripture
[52:35] says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven
[52:37] and all these things shall be added unto
[52:39] you but if you first look to look to
[52:41] doctors you're look to uh incense and
[52:44] and uh seances and different things you
[52:46] get out the Ouija board and you're
[52:48] asking the spirits hey can I be healed
[52:50] and you know that that's a farce you
[52:51] don't want to get into those you don't
[52:53] want to get into dive into the evil
[52:54] stuff trust me stay out of the evil
[52:56] realm look unto God the author and
[52:58] finish of our faith and the one that
[52:59] that promised that said that he is the
[53:01] Healer of all of our diseases amen so I
[53:04] know he's more than capable to to heal
[53:06] us of of our diseases but like I said
[53:09] people focus so much on on on on
[53:12] healing than the
[53:14] Healer see when people are are
[53:17] financially broke they're trying to look
[53:18] for look they're trying to look for a
[53:20] handout instead of looking to Jehovah G
[53:24] you know Jehovah jyra he is the provider
[53:27] see when people need wisdom they they
[53:28] look to education they look to to
[53:30] different things uh other than God see
[53:34] the scripture says if any man lack
[53:36] wisdom go ask your neighbor no go ask
[53:40] the college professor he might help you
[53:42] in some things but if any man lack
[53:44] Wisdom ask of God Amen for that's where
[53:49] the wisdom wisdom lies see people look
[53:52] under the family and they they have a
[53:53] sense of belonging but they uh but they
[53:55] neglect the very father of us all you
[53:59] know uh I better get off of that uh but
[54:03] we're we're focused too much whether
[54:05] we're in a message church we we're we're
[54:07] focused uh so much on on
[54:12] uh being separated from from other
[54:15] churches that we want to be we want to
[54:17] be different you know we don't want to
[54:18] be denominational we don't want to be
[54:20] those things but we're so focused that I
[54:23] go to a message church I'm not saying
[54:24] that that this group does that but uh
[54:26] there are people out there well I go to
[54:28] a message church and it's just the same
[54:30] thing that brother brandom said when he
[54:31] asked are you a Christian well I'm a
[54:33] Baptist well I'm a Methodist that's not
[54:35] the question that was asked are you a
[54:37] Christian you know we have enough of
[54:39] that out in the world well I'm a message
[54:41] believer well how about just I'm a
[54:43] Believer in Christ because ultimately
[54:45] and and and brother Jesse's going to
[54:47] smack me for for getting into
[54:50] this but the message ultimately is Jesus
[54:53] Christ and I believe your p Pastor
[54:55] believes that same thing the message is
[54:57] Christ the message isn't one man the
[54:59] message isn't the 1500 sermons it's
[55:02] what's contained in all the those
[55:05] sermons it's what is
[55:07] preached it's not in healing it's not in
[55:10] tongues it's not in Prophecy But
[55:12] ultimately it comes down to
[55:14] Christ that's who that's the Gift Giver
[55:17] to make all those things possible to
[55:19] show that there is a God that's what the
[55:21] five-fold ministry is here for right to
[55:24] to show us to teach
[55:27] us all those different offices for the
[55:30] perfecting of the Saints that's what
[55:32] each one of us is forth because we're
[55:34] all apt to teach or we should be apt to
[55:37] teach and we all should be
[55:39] testifying
[55:40] right oh my you know something that I I
[55:44] like to say is you know Mark 16 go ye
[55:47] out into the world and preach the gospel
[55:49] use words if necessary I don't want to
[55:51] add to the word I don't want to take
[55:52] away but sometimes just by the life that
[55:54] we live will see well why why do they
[55:56] wear dresses why do they why don't you
[55:58] cut your hair these people are different
[56:00] there's just something different here
[56:02] and it makes people inquisitive that it
[56:04] makes people ask questions of uh why do
[56:07] you do such and
[56:09] such but just so you know I'm sure you
[56:12] know this already people will poke
[56:15] fun people will
[56:18] criticize and why what does what does
[56:21] anybody doing good what harm are they
[56:23] doing
[56:27] it's because they can't accept it I
[56:28] guess I I don't know why people come so
[56:30] hard against not just a message believer
[56:32] but a believer in in general you see
[56:35] we're going to have to go through the
[56:37] persecution but stand strong through
[56:40] that through those storms amen
[56:44] so so it's not just saying that we go to
[56:47] a message church but I am a believer I
[56:49] go to church I go and I go
[56:52] worship I go hear the word of God oh you
[56:55] think that's fun it may not be fun but
[56:58] it's what I
[57:00] need CU people want to all they want to
[57:02] do is go have fun there there was a uh
[57:05] there was a song years ago not that I
[57:07] want you to go listen to it stay away
[57:08] from it just trust me on this okay young
[57:10] ones trust me I've heard the song many
[57:12] times you've probably heard it in the
[57:13] story but stay away from it but the song
[57:15] goes Girls Just Want to Have
[57:18] Fun and that's pretty much what this day
[57:20] and age is is it's all about having fun
[57:23] you know because we need an entertain
[57:25] here we need an entertainment there I
[57:26] need a TV here to entertainment you're
[57:28] not even watching it well but I like the
[57:30] noise I like I just need something I
[57:33] need to hear the talk show what do you
[57:34] need to hear a talk show for they're
[57:36] talking about the same thing 24 hours
[57:38] seven days a week and it's redundant and
[57:40] it's a how can you listen to that all
[57:42] the
[57:43] time you know I used to look at the news
[57:46] I don't even I don't even like to look
[57:47] at the news anymore I I used to watch
[57:49] different things you know different
[57:50] headlines that would come up and it's
[57:52] just so depressing when you see it all
[57:54] the time it's well Democrats are doing
[57:56] this Republicans are doing this uh these
[57:59] people are doing this these people are
[58:01] doing that guns and First Amendment
[58:03] rights second amendment rights what
[58:04] about the Fourth Amendment rights what
[58:06] about the the freedom of religion but
[58:08] people are trying to take that one away
[58:09] too but nobody's nobody's raising up
[58:11] against that
[58:14] one oh my see when our rights start
[58:18] getting take it away we get a little get
[58:20] a little sticky we get a little
[58:23] defensive
[58:25] I'm a Christian first then I'm an
[58:29] American it it was hard for me to say
[58:31] that it was hard for I just had this
[58:33] realization I just had that thought come
[58:34] to me just a few weeks ago I was
[58:36] preaching out in Indiana and uh just
[58:39] that thought came to me because I like
[58:41] the flag I like my rights but I'm a
[58:44] Christian
[58:45] first Christ should be coming first in
[58:48] our Liv
[58:52] right everybody doing okay
[58:55] good all right uh Acts chapter 3 verse
[59:10] 11 it says and as the lame man which was
[59:13] healed held Peter and John all the
[59:15] people ran together unto them in the in
[59:17] the porch that is called Solomon's
[59:19] greatly wondering and when Peter saw it
[59:22] he answered unto the people ye men of
[59:24] Israel why Marvel ye at this or why look
[59:26] ye so earnestly on us as though by our
[59:29] own by our own power or Holiness we had
[59:33] made this man to
[59:34] walk see even they are saying why are
[59:37] you looking on us that we had this power
[59:39] but I like how they give the glory to
[59:41] God in this situation amen was it a
[59:44] marvelous thing was it a miracle
[59:45] absolutely it was a miracle but it
[59:47] wasn't by their own
[59:48] Accord verse 13 it says the god of
[59:51] Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the
[59:53] god of our fathers
[59:55] hath glorified his son Jesus whom ye
[59:57] delivered up and denied him in the
[59:59] presence of pilate when he was
[1:00:01] determined to let him go but ye denied
[1:00:04] the Holy One and the just and desired a
[1:00:07] murderer to be granted unto
[1:00:09] you see there hasn't been much that's
[1:00:12] changed people are looking for evil more
[1:00:14] than they are looking for good because
[1:00:17] evil is more entertaining e evil evil
[1:00:20] seems to be a little bit uh more fun
[1:00:23] know I don't want to abide by these
[1:00:24] rules but even evil has to abide by
[1:00:27] certain rules yep I I get on that a lot
[1:00:30] because I know kids I know kids I know
[1:00:32] people even adults they don't like rules
[1:00:35] they don't like so many rules but if we
[1:00:37] didn't have any rules how would we be a
[1:00:39] to
[1:00:43] operate and verse 15 and killed the
[1:00:46] Prince of Life whom God hath raised from
[1:00:48] the dead whereof we Are Witnesses and
[1:00:50] his name through faith in his name hath
[1:00:53] made this man strong whom ye see and
[1:00:55] know yay the faith which is by him hath
[1:00:59] given him this perfect soundness in the
[1:01:01] presence of you all the
[1:01:06] faith the Faith by him hath given him
[1:01:10] this perfect
[1:01:11] soundness like I said A True Believer
[1:01:14] can't say seeing is believing because
[1:01:17] seeing with your own eyes it could be uh
[1:01:19] it could be deceiving very much so if if
[1:01:22] you don't believe me go see an
[1:01:23] Illusionist sometime you know they used
[1:01:25] to be called magicians I guess they're
[1:01:26] they're using the word illusionists now
[1:01:28] so we saw one you know uh the hand is
[1:01:33] quicker than the eye so somebody can
[1:01:36] take something you know you see those
[1:01:38] people with those I can't even remember
[1:01:41] I don't even know what you call that
[1:01:42] thing keep your eye on this one keep
[1:01:44] your eye on this one then they can trade
[1:01:46] and you don't even know it you know so
[1:01:50] that you can't always believe what the
[1:01:51] natural eye
[1:01:53] sees for we walk by faith
[1:02:00] right and just a couple more we could
[1:02:02] have the musicians come see that that
[1:02:05] was looking upon men for something the
[1:02:07] people looked upon uh Peter and John
[1:02:11] because of the The Marvelous act that
[1:02:13] they had done but we know we just read
[1:02:15] that it wasn't them it wasn't of their
[1:02:17] power it wasn't of their own accord and
[1:02:19] that's that's what people get so
[1:02:21] distracted with as they're they're
[1:02:23] looking at at man because he might have
[1:02:25] done something marvelous you know like
[1:02:27] we said the the scripture is written or
[1:02:29] uh written by men as they were moved by
[1:02:31] the Holy Ghost not that they were
[1:02:34] scholarly uh but they had the ability to
[1:02:36] write as they were moved by the holy
[1:02:38] spirit so uh you can't say this is one
[1:02:40] man's writings because it's of many
[1:02:43] people it's of many
[1:02:46] men but they're saying the same
[1:02:48] thing why I could show you countless
[1:02:50] contradictions in the Bible you can't
[1:02:53] see a rainbow unless it's 42 unless the
[1:02:55] sun is at a 42 degree angle or less it's
[1:02:58] all in the angle that you could
[1:03:00] see it's all in what you're looking at
[1:03:02] and how you're looking at it if you're
[1:03:04] looking at it with doubt and dis
[1:03:05] unbelief you're not going to see
[1:03:08] it you're just going to read you're
[1:03:10] going to read the words like that man
[1:03:12] read read in First Corinthians 11 and he
[1:03:14] didn't have the
[1:03:16] understanding amen so but what we what's
[1:03:20] the bride to be doing the bride is to be
[1:03:22] looking for his coming we're supposed to
[1:03:23] be Focus F on him we're supposed to be
[1:03:25] focused of getting ourselves ready
[1:03:27] because that's Revelations the bride ha
[1:03:29] made herself ready and ready for what to
[1:03:32] be put on display so everybody could see
[1:03:34] the beautiful gown or or whatnot and see
[1:03:36] how wonderful life that we live
[1:03:39] no it's getting ready for his coming
[1:03:42] being pure in heart pure in mind you
[1:03:44] know we can't do that without the
[1:03:46] scripture we can't do that without the
[1:03:47] Holy Spirit if you would stand your feet
[1:03:49] I'm just going to read a couple
[1:03:50] scriptures uh I had a quote here but
[1:03:52] it's going to take a while and I don't I
[1:03:54] don't want
[1:03:55] you I think I you I think you get the
[1:03:58] point of what I was making so you know
[1:04:01] what is that Ecclesiastes much study
[1:04:04] makes the the flesh uh as a weariness to
[1:04:07] the flesh so I don't want to make you
[1:04:09] weary in your flesh because we got an
[1:04:10] evening service I'm going to cover the
[1:04:12] second I'm just
[1:04:15] kidding but depend on on on the Lord's
[1:04:17] will what we cover this evening I still
[1:04:19] don't know yet but uh Hebrews chapter 9
[1:04:22] and verse
[1:04:23] 27
[1:04:25] it says and as it is appointed unto men
[1:04:28] once to die but after this the Judgment
[1:04:31] so Christ was once offered to Bear the
[1:04:34] sins of many and unto them that look for
[1:04:36] him shall he appear the second time
[1:04:39] without sin unto
[1:04:41] salvation uh Philippians 3:20 says for
[1:04:44] our conversation is in heaven from
[1:04:47] whence also we look for the Savior the
[1:04:49] Lord Jesus Christ we're not looking for
[1:04:52] him to come up out of the ground because
[1:04:53] he's already risen right and the
[1:04:55] wonderful thing about that is that you
[1:04:57] know there was no God like him there
[1:04:59] there was nobody that died like him
[1:05:02] because the the grave that he was that
[1:05:04] he was buried in was a borrowed grave it
[1:05:07] was a temporary
[1:05:08] one he didn't plan on being there very
[1:05:11] long amen and you know the other thing
[1:05:14] about that grave I think I might have
[1:05:15] said this here before but the other
[1:05:16] thing about that grave as it was never a
[1:05:19] man l in see it had to be a pure spot
[1:05:22] amen so just just the wonderful I'm
[1:05:26] going to make up a new word the
[1:05:27] wonderfulness of Our Lord I don't know
[1:05:30] if that's a word or not but we're going
[1:05:31] to use it just the wonderfulness of our
[1:05:34] Lord and savior amen there so many
[1:05:36] different things that happen with him
[1:05:38] with Christ uh just in his life being on
[1:05:41] this Earth and In the Flesh just far
[1:05:44] passes everybody else you know there's
[1:05:46] there's nobody like
[1:05:48] him second Peter chapter 3 and verse 13
[1:05:51] it says nevertheless we according to his
[1:05:53] promise look for new heavens and a new
[1:05:56] Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
[1:05:58] where wherefore beloved seeing that ye
[1:06:00] look for such things be diligent that
[1:06:02] you may be found of him in peace without
[1:06:05] spot and blameless so you might have
[1:06:08] thought it was just me talking about
[1:06:09] this that we need to focus on him and
[1:06:12] look upon him but it says it several
[1:06:14] times in the scripture so uh let every
[1:06:16] let every word be established by two or
[1:06:18] three Witnesses well we just read three
[1:06:20] right so that's the testimony of true
[1:06:22] witness is that we had two three
[1:06:24] Witnesses right there saying the same
[1:06:26] thing and one more time or one more
[1:06:29] scripture excuse me two more is that
[1:06:31] okay I'm I'm greedy with the
[1:06:34] scripture so 2 Corinthians
[1:06:37] 4:18 it says why we look not at the
[1:06:40] things which are seen But at the things
[1:06:42] which are not seen for the things which
[1:06:45] are seen are temporal but the things
[1:06:48] which are not seen are Eternal because
[1:06:50] we don't see we can't see God because
[1:06:53] he's a spirit we can't can't see Spirit
[1:06:54] unless we're blessed you know uh like
[1:06:57] Elijah uh what was this servant's
[1:07:00] name gesi thank you uh even Elisha said
[1:07:04] hey open the Lord yeah he said unto the
[1:07:07] Lord open his eyes that he might see
[1:07:08] that and then he saw that there was more
[1:07:10] for them than there for those two than
[1:07:13] there was for the the whole Army right
[1:07:15] so unless we're able to see something
[1:07:17] like that we can't see God so unless he
[1:07:20] blesses us with with being able to see
[1:07:23] and one morning Colossians
[1:07:25] 3:2 remember I was talking about
[1:07:27] focusing focus on the right object it
[1:07:30] says set your affection on things above
[1:07:33] not on things on the earth let's bow our
[1:07:35] heads most gracious Heavenly Father we
[1:07:38] thank you for the day that you've given

[1:08:14] we we think that we always need to be on
[1:08:16] the mountain but there are times and a
[1:08:18] hard time on the mountain because then
[1:08:20] we get complacent and then uh we we
[1:08:23] think that we don't need corrected uh
