[0:07] Colossians chapter 2 verse 1.
[0:11] I want to read down to verse 7
[0:13] Colossians
[0:15] chapter 2 verses 1 through 7.
[0:24] Lord willing tonight I'd like to preach
[0:27] on the love of God kind of tonight to
[0:28] kind of go back to that the disciple
[0:30] whom Jesus loves series I got a few
[0:32] thoughts on that last night and
[0:34] so girls for Sunday school will probably
[0:36] push it back to next week I want to kind
[0:38] of preach tonight on the love of God
[0:40] okay maybe we can do some dancing
[0:41] tonight by God's grace if that's okay
[0:44] Hallelujah Colossians chapter 2 verse 1.
[0:47] we left off last time on verse 3.
[0:50] so I want to read one two one through
[0:52] three rather as a review and then we're
[0:56] going to focus here on four five six and
[0:58] seven
[1:01] praise God
[1:03] I'll read one through six and then we'll
[1:05] I'll read verse 7.
[1:07] for I would that ye knew what great
[1:09] conflict I have for you and for them at
[1:11] laodicea and for many
[1:13] or for as many as have not seen my face
[1:16] in the flesh that their hearts might be
[1:18] comforted being knit together in love
[1:20] and unto all Riches of the full
[1:23] Assurance of understanding to the
[1:25] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[1:27] of the father and of Christ in whom are
[1:30] HID all the treasures of wisdom and
[1:33] knowledge look how they're hidden there
[1:35] praise God we're talking about that
[1:36] weren't we brother Chris on Wednesday
[1:38] night God hides himself
[1:40] I showed you the scripture in Isaiah
[1:41] verily thou art a God that hideth
[1:43] thyself
[1:44] so God hides himself he reveals himself
[1:47] and then he hides himself at seasons of
[1:48] our lives and that's when we know when
[1:50] he's hiding that's when it's our turn to
[1:52] go seek and find him
[1:53] praise God like we talked about the
[1:55] isolation series sometimes we're
[1:56] isolated to God to test Us and other
[1:59] times we're isolated with him to seek
[2:01] the Lord
[2:03] verse 4 and this I say lest any man
[2:06] should beguile you with enticing words
[2:11] for though I be absent in the flesh yet
[2:13] am I with you in the spirit join and
[2:16] beholding your order and the
[2:18] steadfastness of your faith in Christ as
[2:20] you have received of Christ Jesus the
[2:22] Lord so walk ye in him and let's read
[2:25] verse 7 together ready one two three
[2:28] rooted and built up in him and
[2:31] established in the faith as ye have been
[2:34] taught abounding Theron with
[2:37] Thanksgiving amen let's have a word of
[2:39] prayer if you have anything on your
[2:40] heart let's just make it known unto God
[2:42] you know we had four unspoken needs and
[2:43] I'm sure there's others let's just pray
[2:45] together father God we want to see
[2:46] Miracles this year Lord God we want to
[2:48] see Giants fall Lord God and of course
[2:50] we're speaking of spiritual Giants or
[2:52] mountains that need to be moved so we
[2:54] come in the mighty name of Jesus Christ
[2:55] thank you for raising our faith oh God
[2:57] and giving us the Lord another year to
[2:59] worship and love you and serve you so
[3:00] God we give you thanks and praise
[3:02] Hallelujah we believe we'll see Miracles
[3:04] this year father God because you're
[3:05] merciful and you are the miracle working
[3:07] God and these signs follow them that
[3:09] believe Lord Jesus Hallelujah Lord
[3:11] they're not works that we would boast of
[3:13] but Lord we would boast in the cross
[3:14] Lord God and the love of God and Lord we
[3:17] would be just standing there when the
[3:19] Holy Ghost moves in a miracle in our
[3:21] lives so God we're just trusting in you
[3:22] Lord God we're rejoicing in you we're
[3:25] thankful Lord for your promises Lord you
[3:27] are here today Lord God your presence is
[3:29] among us we feel your presence oh God
[3:31] your sacredness the Holiness of God so
[3:33] we ask that the great holy spirit will
[3:35] move today God For Your Glory Hallelujah
[3:37] let the the prince of God be felt by
[3:39] each and every person Lord God help me
[3:41] to yield to you may each and every
[3:42] person yield to you as we start this New
[3:44] Year bless your people in the name of
[3:46] Jesus Christ and the church said amen
[3:49] God bless you as you're being seated
[3:50] praise God
[3:56] Hallelujah
[3:59] so I want to begin here with this
[4:01] thought and we'll Lord willing try to
[4:04] get through this chapter here today by
[4:06] God's grace we'll kind of see how far we
[4:08] can get
[4:09] and like I said I want to look at the
[4:10] love of God you know more tonight by
[4:12] God's grace
[4:13] I'm just studying a little bit last
[4:15] night and a few different scriptures
[4:17] come to my mind that I hadn't thought
[4:18] about before
[4:20] and so we want to go that route here by
[4:22] God's grace
[4:24] so you can switch over here we're
[4:25] looking at part six here remember you
[4:28] know this chapter here deals with uh
[4:30] some of the heresies
[4:32] that Paul had to warn the Colossians of
[4:37] and remember this was a church Paul had
[4:39] never been to he never seen them you
[4:41] know face to face but he talked to
[4:44] epiphris and epiphrist was constantly
[4:46] praying for them
[4:47] and so church if the Holy Spirit puts
[4:49] somebody on your heart to constantly
[4:51] pray for then you can probably recognize
[4:52] that's your ministry
[4:54] that's that's the person that you need
[4:56] to be in prayer for so epipherals had
[4:59] had the Colossians on his heart all the
[5:01] time praise God
[5:02] and so you know you got to see you know
[5:04] who is God placing on your heart what is
[5:07] the burden that God has given you praise
[5:09] God hallelujah and so you know we look
[5:11] at our lives and we see you know this is
[5:12] the burden I have you have a burden for
[5:14] this ministry or I have a burden for
[5:16] that Ministry I've got a real burden for
[5:18] that that people you know I don't know
[5:20] how many times brother Brian Hawkins has
[5:22] texted me and he's like I just got you
[5:24] guys on my heart
[5:25] you know I'm just praying for you guys
[5:27] and and numerous times I've been wanting
[5:30] to ask him to come and preach you know
[5:31] and uh you know I just know I just feel
[5:34] like that's a good example he said you
[5:36] guys are always on my heart and look how
[5:38] God has used him amongst us you know to
[5:39] be a wonderful blessing
[5:41] and I just think it's beautiful you know
[5:42] the Lord put certain people on your
[5:44] hearts there are certain burdens that
[5:46] are on your heart that God has called
[5:48] you to do
[5:49] praise God and there's certain people
[5:51] you gotta you gotta watch over there are
[5:53] certain people you gotta text them and
[5:54] remind them and and you gotta you gotta
[5:57] follow up with them and call them and
[5:59] how are they how are you doing and and
[6:01] some so some people it's going to be
[6:02] your responsibility God wants you to be
[6:05] a faithful Steward over them God wants
[6:08] you to be a help to those people
[6:10] aren't you glad I'm sure you and I can
[6:12] recognize different people in in your in
[6:14] Our Lives who have been a great help to
[6:16] us
[6:17] I know brother Craig Moore has been a
[6:19] great one you know brother Brooks and
[6:20] and brother Jim Shoemake different ones
[6:22] that have called me and now brother
[6:23] Brian Hawkins have called me and
[6:25] encouraged me at certain times in my
[6:26] life each one of you you know I'm sure
[6:28] God has used you to encourage me no
[6:30] doubt at some point but uh I just love
[6:33] this how
[6:34] Paul never met them but he felt the
[6:36] burden he felt the Holy Spirit talk
[6:38] through epipheris to him and then the
[6:42] spirit of God you know anointed Paul
[6:44] here to write and give them warnings
[6:46] here
[6:47] and of course then you know all this
[6:49] Christian instruction on how they work
[6:52] to live their lives Hallelujah and so
[6:55] and as I said last time you know uh this
[6:57] this city was going to be destroyed in
[7:00] less than 10 years they would rebuild it
[7:01] but then it would of course be destroyed
[7:03] again or just they'd move on but the
[7:06] spiritual disaster has far outweighed
[7:08] the natural
[7:09] and so in other words your soul is more
[7:11] valuable than the physical things that
[7:13] we have praise God God is more concerned
[7:16] about your soul making it hallelujah
[7:18] amen whether we lose things naturally or
[7:21] whether our houses are burned out or
[7:23] whether our cars are getting are totaled
[7:25] you know God's not really interested in
[7:26] those things God is interested in your
[7:28] soul praise God
[7:30] like the Bible says I would that you
[7:32] prosper in health even as your soul
[7:34] prospers praise God God wants your soul
[7:37] to prosper God wants your body to be
[7:39] strong uh so your soul can find the will
[7:42] of God hallelujah amen so you can
[7:44] accomplish the purpose of God for your
[7:46] life Hallelujah and so
[7:49] you know remember the Bible says God
[7:51] will judge our hearts
[7:54] by the gospel that he gave to Paul and
[7:56] this of course is the Judgment standard
[7:58] so Colossians again is the the Judgment
[8:00] standard I'm just quickly going through
[8:02] these and you know we looked at the
[8:03] outline of chapter one Paul greeted them
[8:05] Paul prayed for them he looked at the
[8:07] Supreme deity of Christ so this is
[8:09] something they were you know people in
[8:10] the church would struggle at uh at
[8:13] colossi they struggled you know maybe
[8:15] some were more like trinitarians or
[8:18] maybe some were uh somewhere maybe the
[8:20] two persons but Paul had to let them see
[8:22] that Jesus Christ is God in the flesh
[8:25] Hallelujah that's a good question we
[8:27] talked to we had a Bible study Malachi
[8:29] who was there where the Bible say this
[8:30] week on Wednesday morning
[8:32] with my friend jacorian and he asked me
[8:34] he said somebody asked him who is Jesus
[8:37] and how would how would he respond so I
[8:38] gave him the scriptures Jesus is God in
[8:41] the flesh Hallelujah Jesus is the word
[8:44] of God made flesh Hallelujah and so we
[8:47] can see that this church needed
[8:48] instruction on the godhead thank God
[8:51] they did because we need instruction on
[8:53] the godhead
[8:54] and then he goes through the power of
[8:56] the Cross and and notice this is all
[8:58] focusing on Christ and and then Paul
[9:00] ends chapter 1 with the baptism of the
[9:02] Holy Ghost it's the mystery that was hid
[9:04] from ages and it's Christ in you the
[9:07] hope of glory this is what Moses
[9:09] couldn't have this is what David and
[9:11] Solomon couldn't have Hallelujah this is
[9:13] something that Ezekiel and Jeremiah and
[9:16] Isaiah couldn't have but you and I are
[9:18] privileged to have the baptism of the
[9:20] Holy Ghost praise God
[9:22] and Paul said it was been hidden from
[9:24] ages but now it's it's revealed in US
[9:26] Christ in us the hope of glory praise
[9:29] God and we've looked at verse one
[9:31] through three now we saw all the
[9:33] treasures of God are in Christ
[9:37] every treasure that we desire today is
[9:40] in Christ
[9:42] and the Bible said they're hidden so
[9:43] there's going to be seasons of Our Lives
[9:45] where we have to be digging in the word
[9:47] of God
[9:48] we got to go looking forward we're going
[9:50] to have to we have to do more than just
[9:52] come to church although come to church
[9:53] is a necessary thing but we're gonna
[9:55] have to spend some more time digging in
[9:57] the word of God we're going to spend
[9:59] some more time seeking Christ ourselves
[10:01] amen
[10:02] you know in the individual setting this
[10:05] is the we'd say the Corporal this is the
[10:07] body set not the Corporal but this is
[10:08] the community setting of Christ but in
[10:10] our individual lives we're gonna have to
[10:12] spend time seeking God because in Christ
[10:15] is every treasure that we desire now you
[10:18] might be looking for a different
[10:18] treasure today that I'm looking for but
[10:21] we're all looking for Treasures in
[10:22] Christ today Hallelujah
[10:24] like if someone's sick like Jose he's
[10:26] looking for The Treasure of Divine
[10:27] Healing
[10:28] well if my body's well I'm not maybe
[10:30] looking for that treasure I'm looking
[10:32] for maybe for wisdom or a revelation or
[10:35] an interpretation of a dream or
[10:36] something you know I'm looking for more
[10:38] than that and so we understand that God
[10:41] has all these things hidden in Christ
[10:44] and every treasure everything that we
[10:47] would uh consider a treasure on this
[10:49] Earth is hidden in Christ
[10:52] so that means our bank accounts are not
[10:54] their Treasures amen
[10:55] although we thank God we have a place to
[10:57] save our money amen that's really not
[10:59] their treasure because we can go look at
[11:01] our bank account and we can visit the
[11:03] bank and we can see it online but but
[11:05] that's not in Christ every treasure is
[11:08] in Christ Hallelujah
[11:10] and so the Treasure of God are the
[11:12] fruits of the Holy Spirit praise God the
[11:15] anointings of the Holy Spirit the wisdom
[11:17] of God the will of God I say the perfect
[11:20] will of God is The Treasure of God
[11:22] hallelujah
[11:23] and so we wanted to finish chapter two I
[11:25] think we'll get through chapter two
[11:26] today uh by God's grace and
[11:29] so remember Paul had a great fight or
[11:31] conflict
[11:32] he wanted them to know the great fight
[11:34] he was fighting for them in prayer he
[11:36] wasn't with them and see church you can
[11:38] fight for people in spiritual ways even
[11:40] though you're not with them
[11:42] Hallelujah you know like I'm sure Austin
[11:45] wishes he could be you know with some of
[11:47] I'm sure he wished he could have been
[11:48] with his grandma and grandpa out there
[11:50] in Arizona or the grandma out there you
[11:51] know when she was dying there right I'm
[11:53] sure uh Lena wishes she could be with
[11:55] her family out there in Arizona but we
[11:57] have to understand even though we're not
[11:58] there we can still fight for them in
[12:00] prayer
[12:01] because Paul never there's no record
[12:04] upon ever meeting them but Paul said I
[12:06] have a great fight for you I'm fighting
[12:08] the fight for you praise God Amen
[12:11] Hallelujah each one of us had people
[12:13] praying for us when we weren't really
[12:15] serving God the way we ought to been
[12:16] each one of us had a someone who had a
[12:18] conflict for us praise God
[12:20] and they were burdened by the Holy
[12:22] Spirit and so so now that we're mature
[12:24] Believers we have to see who is God
[12:26] placing on our hearts amen What conflict
[12:29] do I have who am I praying for who am I
[12:31] concerned about who is God leading me to
[12:33] pray for and so we see this is not for
[12:35] prophets because epiphris was not a
[12:37] prophet but he had the Colossians out of
[12:40] burden on his heart for them praise God
[12:42] and so he was able to devote prayer for
[12:44] them amen amen so again we see Church
[12:47] the power of Prayer
[12:51] Paul said I have a great contention I'm
[12:53] fighting a fight for you in prayer
[12:55] Hallelujah even though you've never seen
[12:57] me face to face
[13:00] okay now the fight was in verse two that
[13:04] your hearts might be knit together
[13:08] in love and that's why this all goes
[13:10] back to love love is the Capstone on the
[13:12] individual God is love love is the
[13:15] Fulfillment of all the law Amen to love
[13:18] God with all your heart soul mind and
[13:20] strength this is the greatest
[13:21] commandment and to love your neighbor as
[13:23] yourself
[13:25] Hallelujah so what was Paul's great
[13:27] fight it was that the people would be
[13:29] knitted together in love they would be
[13:31] unified our lives would be sown together
[13:34] right Lydia is pretty good at sewing
[13:36] right and but is it is it a quick thing
[13:38] or does it take time Lydia lots of time
[13:41] you know Lydia thought about you know
[13:43] maybe I'll be a seamstress you know but
[13:45] realize you know the hours it's not
[13:47] worth it for the hours you invest in it
[13:49] you don't get paid enough
[13:51] right that's why they got machines to do
[13:53] that
[13:54] but if you just yourself you know would
[13:56] try to make money it's a very slow
[13:58] process it's a lot of work and most
[14:00] people don't do that unless they have
[14:02] lots of machines because you just can't
[14:03] make enough money
[14:06] and see that's how it is today Church
[14:08] you know God is knitting our hearts
[14:10] together God is sowing our hearts
[14:11] together one service at a time
[14:13] one year at a time Hallelujah he's
[14:16] knitting our heart like uh like I was
[14:18] telling uh sister or Beatrice and Naomi
[14:20] you know I picked up the girls for the
[14:21] you know uh the play dates I said well
[14:24] it only took us about seven years to do
[14:26] this you know
[14:28] you see how it takes time you know you
[14:29] you got to build a friendship right God
[14:31] has to knit our hearts together
[14:34] right you know it takes it takes years
[14:36] to develop trust it does
[14:38] that's why you never want to lose it
[14:39] right because it's hard to get back
[14:42] it takes years uh to to knit people's
[14:45] hearts together and to really feel like
[14:47] a family praise God
[14:49] you know there are certain people you
[14:50] know that we've had come to the church
[14:51] and we never really felt really
[14:53] connected with them you know they're
[14:54] only here for a little while then you
[14:56] know hopefully it's a good experience I
[14:58] believe it was a good experience for all
[14:59] of them but you know you never maybe
[15:00] really feel the genuine connection but
[15:03] Paul says the prayer his prayer was that
[15:06] our hearts would be sewn together amen
[15:09] it's a long process it's a hard process
[15:11] it's not easy it's not a glamorous
[15:14] process
[15:15] many times I walk in there and Lydia I
[15:17] walk into my office after working she's
[15:19] got all these patterns laid out on the
[15:21] floor The Remnant and it's just if she's
[15:23] bending over and making I don't even not
[15:25] even sure what she's doing but she's got
[15:27] to cut out all the patterns and
[15:28] everything and it's a slow process but
[15:30] then you see on Christmas morning when
[15:32] the girls wake up and they get the new
[15:33] dresses and you see the smile on their
[15:35] faces when you see the end product of
[15:36] all the labors oh that's what God's
[15:39] doing together he's knitting together
[15:41] the body of Christ amen hallelujah
[15:43] knitting us together it's it doesn't you
[15:46] know it's it's difficult at first but
[15:48] slowly but surely over the course of
[15:50] years and months you know our hearts Are
[15:52] knitted together and this was Paul's
[15:54] prayer I went to church whose hearts are
[15:57] sewn together praise God
[15:59] Hallelujah and of course you know the
[16:01] type of the wise and Bush virgin right
[16:02] as a part of the uh of the remnant of
[16:06] the cloth right you have the cloth and
[16:09] uh and the part you use that's the
[16:11] chosen part
[16:12] that's the elected part Lydia cuts out
[16:14] this part this is the main part of the
[16:16] fabric this is the part I'm using and
[16:19] that's the Bride of Jesus Christ she's
[16:21] the one who's who's cut out she's the
[16:23] part that's going to be used she's the
[16:25] part that's going to be raptured amen
[16:26] hallelujah and the foolish virgin is the
[16:28] remnant they're the ones that's going to
[16:30] be left behind because they didn't they
[16:32] didn't uh they didn't have the oil ready
[16:34] right they were supposed to be prepared
[16:36] but God had the wise virgin prepared she
[16:39] was cut out she was the she was the the
[16:41] group that was was chosen praise God she
[16:43] was ordained she was predestinated
[16:46] praise God hallelujah
[16:50] so God want Paul's prayer is that their
[16:52] hearts will be knit together in love
[16:57] that we would the Bible said in verse 2
[16:59] that we would uh have all unto all
[17:02] Riches of the full understand full
[17:04] Assurance of understanding to the
[17:05] acknowledgment of the mystery of God and
[17:07] of the father and of Christ
[17:09] so when our hearts are knit together in
[17:11] love we recognize the mystery of the
[17:13] godhead how great God is
[17:15] and then the Bible said in humor hid all
[17:17] the treasures everybody say all
[17:18] Treasures ready all Treasures in in the
[17:21] godhead are all Treasures of wisdom and
[17:24] knowledge
[17:27] okay so now we're here here in verse
[17:29] four and this I say lest any man should
[17:32] beguile you with entice enticing words
[17:35] so Paul has a burden for them he's
[17:37] praying for them that they'd be knit
[17:39] together in love but what's happening
[17:40] men are coming around and of course then
[17:42] it could be women too men and women are
[17:44] coming around and they're having
[17:46] conversations with the church members
[17:48] trying to beguile them that's how it
[17:51] always is Satan anoints somebody and
[17:53] they'll get he'll talk with somebody
[17:55] they'll start uh sharing something
[17:58] different that's outside of what's been
[17:59] being preached and to start pulling
[18:01] people away
[18:03] right it's always somebody's influence
[18:05] that starts talking and and Satan slowly
[18:07] Works them down and gets their defenses
[18:09] down and they accept a lie right it's
[18:12] always that way someone talks them out
[18:14] of the truth
[18:15] say church if you can be talked out of
[18:17] the truth and you never had the truth
[18:19] praise God
[18:20] Hallelujah if you can be talked out of a
[18:23] of the the kingdom of God you never were
[18:25] part of the kingdom of God
[18:27] because the Bible said the Gates of Hell
[18:29] cannot Prevail against it amen
[18:32] amen hallelujah thank God
[18:35] and Satan is always using men and women
[18:37] to try to give them enticing or these
[18:39] are persuasive words my they can really
[18:42] talk these people can really talk and
[18:44] come up with such persuasive and and uh
[18:48] convincing words oh this just sounds
[18:50] right Church it don't sound right unless
[18:52] it's unless it's coming from the word of
[18:54] God
[18:55] is that right but here's what was
[18:57] dividing the church it was making them
[18:59] not love each other
[19:01] first men men and women were persuading
[19:03] them and it was actually breaking their
[19:05] bonds of love
[19:08] and so Paul said this is I'm saying all
[19:11] the treasures are in Christ
[19:13] and you have to be careful because men
[19:15] and women are saying persuasive things
[19:17] that are not in Christ
[19:20] and now Paul's going to go in to some of
[19:23] these examples of how people are being
[19:25] uh pulled away from Christ
[19:29] now uh before we go there though I want
[19:31] to read II Corinthians
[19:34] 11 20. I preached this in the doctrines
[19:37] of devils series here
[19:39] last year
[19:44] thank God we've had good faithful
[19:46] ministers come through our church
[19:47] Hallelujah God's given me Grace
[19:50] you know like I told you that remember
[19:52] last year I showed
[19:53] this preacher
[19:56] and remember I showed you he preached 24
[19:58] false doctrines in one sermon
[20:00] and somebody asked me and said you need
[20:02] to have him come to the church and I
[20:03] said I'll pray about it and I prayed
[20:05] about it and I did not feel led to have
[20:06] him come
[20:07] and the reason I didn't feel like to
[20:09] have him come was because he don't have
[20:10] a pastor
[20:13] and the church said
[20:15] yeah he had all these testimonies all
[20:17] these Miracles church that don't mean
[20:19] nothing to me if you don't obey the word
[20:20] of God
[20:22] Hallelujah
[20:24] and then now it's been Vindicated that I
[20:26] was right
[20:27] so that that's God's grace
[20:30] that's God's grace
[20:31] who is it that tries to spoil people
[20:34] it's false preachers
[20:36] amen II Corinthians 11 20.
[20:40] because one time I surely knew you know
[20:42] there's there's times there's there's
[20:43] certain times your life you know God's
[20:45] with you that was one time I already
[20:46] knew God was with me Hallelujah
[20:49] they said you need to have them come I'm
[20:50] like I don't feel led if that guy don't
[20:52] obey the word of God he's older than me
[20:53] he's been preaching longer me and he
[20:55] don't obey the word and he don't he
[20:56] don't belong here
[21:00] now look the Corinthians did this for ye
[21:02] suffer if a man bring you into bondage
[21:04] they were allowing preachers to bring
[21:05] them into bondage to sin if a man devour
[21:08] you if a man take of you if a man exalt
[21:11] himself if a man Smite you on the face
[21:15] the Corinthians were letting preachers
[21:16] disrespect them
[21:18] right and bring them into bondage
[21:23] like one thing that false preacher did
[21:25] is he tried to get a man who's not been
[21:27] healed to try to condemn himself it was
[21:29] his fault he wasn't being healed
[21:31] and the man knew right away that wasn't
[21:33] right
[21:34] because God had showed him that wasn't
[21:35] right
[21:36] see that was Satan on that man trying to
[21:39] bind that man into condemnation but the
[21:42] Bible said there's no condemnation to
[21:44] them that are in Christ Jesus amen
[21:47] hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah
[21:50] oh it's beautiful
[21:54] that's how we always know Church no
[21:56] matter how persuasive their testimonies
[21:57] how persuasive their words how smooth
[22:00] they can talk let's see who obeys the
[22:02] word of God Amen brother man said when
[22:04] you got the Holy Ghost you're in the
[22:06] word all the way praise God
[22:11] Glory
[22:13] yeah verse 5.
[22:16] for though I be absent in the flesh Paul
[22:19] says yet I'm with you in the spirit now
[22:21] this is quite a statement
[22:22] joying and beholding your order and the
[22:25] steadfastness of your faith in Christ I
[22:27] believe Paul would say the same thing if
[22:29] he was here today
[22:30] he say my you look at our church he's
[22:32] saying I'm beholding your order you're a
[22:35] very orderly church amen you're a very
[22:37] steadfast Church Hallelujah everybody's
[22:40] in position praise God everybody's firm
[22:42] in the faith everybody's holding on
[22:43] praise God nobody's wavering and leaving
[22:46] church for months at a time and going
[22:47] out and getting drunk and coming back no
[22:50] sir we've got order Hallelujah we've got
[22:52] steadfastness we're sincere hallelujah
[22:54] we're founded upon the rock of Christ
[22:56] amen
[22:58] Glory
[23:01] now Church isn't this interesting the
[23:03] spirit of God in our souls allows us to
[23:05] be in other gatherings
[23:08] even though we're not physically there
[23:10] like you remember brother Williams last
[23:11] words
[23:12] when he was leaving it was a goodbye he
[23:15] said even though I'm in Ghana he said
[23:17] I'll be with you in the spirit
[23:19] and I was like I was just going to
[23:20] preach on that
[23:22] it's exactly right
[23:24] there's something about it if the spirit
[23:26] and that's why you know I listen to
[23:28] other services online from message
[23:30] churches and I feel like I'm there I can
[23:32] say amen and in one way I am
[23:35] the spirit of God inside of me is there
[23:37] praise God
[23:38] and I enjoy the word of God that I'm
[23:40] hearing I'm enjoying the worship and I'm
[23:42] enjoying the dancing and the shouting
[23:44] and the praising of God and it's like
[23:46] I'm there praise God hallelujah because
[23:48] the Bible says we can be there we're
[23:51] absent in the flesh but we can be
[23:53] present in the spirit praise God
[23:57] now that's a deep thing it's a
[23:58] mysterious thing I don't want to go too
[24:00] far on that but Paul says I can be
[24:02] present there in the spirit even though
[24:04] I'm not present in the physical body
[24:07] praise God
[24:09] now this also gives me another a
[24:11] blessing you know
[24:13] you know over the years I've had
[24:14] different friends and and uh they get
[24:17] mad at me if I don't keep in touch with
[24:18] them
[24:20] no not everybody but there's some I've
[24:21] had some different friends that have
[24:22] criticized me and the reason I know it's
[24:24] wrong is because they've come back later
[24:26] and repented of it
[24:30] and so uh
[24:33] you know we can't let Satan condemn us
[24:35] where you know we're not staying in
[24:37] contact with every single person Church
[24:40] you and I can't do everything praise God
[24:42] as we saw a few weeks ago we can only do
[24:45] what we can do praise God
[24:47] Hallelujah
[24:48] we can't do everything I can't do
[24:51] everything now we should do what we can
[24:53] do we should do all that we can do but
[24:55] we can't do everything praise God
[24:57] in other words we have limits and this
[25:00] scripture gives me a great blessing
[25:02] I can't be in contact with every
[25:04] Christian I can't pray for this gives me
[25:07] a lot of relief I can't pray for every
[25:09] prayer request that comes in brother
[25:10] Brandon couldn't do it either
[25:12] right but we should do the ones we know
[25:15] God is leading us to do
[25:17] Hallelujah we should be as faithful as
[25:20] we can
[25:21] right but this helps us get the pressure
[25:24] off of our lives right Paul never saw
[25:27] them yet he could be happy for them
[25:30] hallelujah it's like those friends you
[25:32] have as friends you have you cannot see
[25:35] them for a couple years and then see
[25:36] them and you pick up right where you
[25:37] left off
[25:40] that's somebody that really loves you
[25:41] that's somebody who's not jealous
[25:44] see there's no jealousy in the body of
[25:46] Christ
[25:48] the only jealousy is God is jealous of
[25:50] our worship amen the Bible says that
[25:52] amen
[25:53] his spirit is jealous to end me praise
[25:55] God God in other words God's one God
[25:57] wants our love God wants our worship he
[26:00] deserves our worship praise God
[26:02] but this verse frees me from from
[26:04] feeling like I have to take care of
[26:06] other people at other churches I don't
[26:08] really have to do that my responsibility
[26:10] is to my flock praise God Amen like I
[26:13] said I've had friends that have said
[26:14] really harsh things to me because I
[26:15] didn't keep in touch with them where
[26:16] whereas other friends I I don't keep in
[26:19] touch with them but then when I see them
[26:20] it's right back we just go right back to
[26:23] the joy that we have together
[26:27] see I've learned I've got a I've had to
[26:29] mature as a Christian
[26:30] I can't let Satan get me with jealousy
[26:33] I can't let Satan get me with
[26:35] condemnation because there is no
[26:36] condemnation to me
[26:39] just say devil you can't condemn me the
[26:41] blood of Jesus Christ has already
[26:42] Justified me
[26:44] come on Church Hallelujah Satan you
[26:47] can't put guilt on me I'm forgiven
[26:49] praise God
[26:50] Hallelujah my spirit even though I'm not
[26:53] there my spirit's with them praise God I
[26:56] don't know how that's possible
[26:57] I don't know it's that Divine attribute
[26:59] it's that Eternal attribute of the
[27:01] spirit of God in your soul it's still
[27:03] with them and church your prayers are
[27:05] just as powerful praise God
[27:10] see there's no jealousy in the body of
[27:12] Christ Paul was praying for their love
[27:14] to knit to knit themselves together
[27:16] praise God even though he's never with
[27:18] them may you be knitted in love may you
[27:20] keep the love in the church
[27:22] Hallelujah and we see God loves order
[27:25] God loves steadfastness
[27:28] God wants you and I in our positions
[27:31] praise God this is how we overcome
[27:33] enticing words this is we oh how we
[27:35] overcome people trying to persuade us to
[27:37] leave the Bible
[27:39] you overcome it by being knit together
[27:42] to the Christian family
[27:44] Hallelujah stay stay in love with Christ
[27:47] stay in love with God's people this is
[27:50] how you overcome enticing words praise
[27:52] God
[27:53] you stay in your position you stay in
[27:56] order you stay steadfast in the word of
[27:58] God
[28:02] now this is a beautiful thought here in
[28:05] verses 6 and 7 we see how
[28:08] we see Paul's wisdom here this is how
[28:11] you stay steadfast
[28:13] you walk with Christ just as you did at
[28:16] the beginning so this is like a first
[28:18] love scripture
[28:20] because he says as you receive Christ
[28:22] walking in him so go back to when you
[28:25] first received Christ how did you
[28:27] receive him Paul said just as you
[28:29] received him walk in him
[28:32] now church that's why I like these
[28:33] Sunday night bible studies because it
[28:35] kind of takes me back to when we first
[28:36] come in the message
[28:37] right
[28:39] because when you first come in what did
[28:41] you want the word of God all the time
[28:42] the word the word the word sit down and
[28:44] teach me the word of God I've got
[28:45] questions give me answers amen
[28:48] that's why there's something special
[28:49] about Bible studies Paul had a hired
[28:52] house and for a year and a half or two
[28:54] years Paul took everybody in for Bible
[28:56] studies and sat them and taught them the
[28:58] word of God a man who is a prophet of
[29:00] God hallelujah love doing Bible studies
[29:02] there's something about sitting down
[29:03] opening your Bible and saying Holy
[29:06] Spirit reveal it to me praise God
[29:08] teach me the word of God oh because I
[29:10] know in you is hid I know in this Bible
[29:12] is hid all the Treasures of the
[29:14] Mysteries and the blessings and the the
[29:16] infinite wisdom of God hallelujah
[29:18] oh my God
[29:21] thank God
[29:26] see how did you receive Christ well
[29:27] first you got rooted in Christ
[29:30] and then you were built up in Christ
[29:34] and you became established in the faith
[29:36] this only comes from sound teaching
[29:39] and it's a beautiful symbolism uh for
[29:42] beginning your walk with God
[29:45] and I want to share this for brother
[29:46] Chris
[29:47] brother Chris you know you and I Jesus
[29:50] told a parable you and I are like one of
[29:52] these grounds your heart is like one of
[29:54] these grounds brother Chris it's in
[29:56] Matthew 13 and also Luke chapter 8 the
[29:58] parable of the four grounds
[30:01] you and I are one of these grounds
[30:03] now the one we want to do is down here
[30:05] bro this is the ground we want to be we
[30:07] want to be a good and honest heart Jesus
[30:10] says the word preach is like a seed
[30:13] right
[30:14] when you hear the word of God it's like
[30:16] a seed is being spread it's being
[30:18] scattered and planted on your heart
[30:20] and you got to make sure you take care
[30:22] of that seed
[30:24] you can't neglect that seed
[30:26] and the church said
[30:27] you cannot neglect that seed even now
[30:30] you can't neglect the word of God that's
[30:32] being preached to us you've got to
[30:34] receive it with a good heart and an
[30:36] honest heart praise God not an evil
[30:39] heart and not a dishonest heart
[30:43] so Paul's warning them you know there's
[30:44] going to be philosophers come there's
[30:46] going to be legalists come there's going
[30:47] to be all these vain uh men tried to
[30:50] beguile and deceive you he said but make
[30:52] sure as you receive Christ that's how
[30:55] you continue serving Christ
[30:57] in other words keep your heart free
[30:59] we say from the weeds right that that
[31:02] pull away uh from your love for God keep
[31:06] your heart honest before God Amen keep
[31:08] your heart in a good condition don't let
[31:11] the cares of Life distract you from the
[31:13] seed of God hallelujah
[31:16] so brother Chris you're one of these
[31:17] four right we're one of these four
[31:19] either we keep all the the uh we keep
[31:22] the word of God with the good honest
[31:23] heart the Thorns Jesus says our cares of
[31:26] the world
[31:27] like money Fame popularity you know
[31:29] women men relationships you know
[31:31] anything that uh bitterness anything
[31:33] anything that would take away your
[31:36] Devotion to God is like a thorn
[31:40] and so we can't let things grow up in
[31:42] our lives
[31:43] we've got to just be we've got to be
[31:45] good Master Gardeners praise God we got
[31:47] to keep the weeds out of our lives
[31:51] this is what's going to keep us strong
[31:53] in the faith we've got to be able to see
[31:55] when is someone trying to plant um you
[31:57] know I've been in contact with this
[31:58] individual or this I watch this video we
[32:00] got to be careful and make sure they're
[32:01] not planning a false seat of corruption
[32:04] in our minds
[32:05] a seat of discrepancy brother man caught
[32:07] it right
[32:10] so this is the person who's totally
[32:12] faithful to Jesus this is the wise
[32:14] virgin this is the foolish version they
[32:16] still have a growth but it doesn't
[32:17] produce all the it doesn't produce fruit
[32:20] it just grows
[32:22] and this is the Wayside
[32:25] uh I'm sorry this is the Stony ground
[32:27] that's the Wayside the Wayside is people
[32:29] that hear the gospel they never believe
[32:30] it
[32:31] the Stony is where we've seen people can
[32:34] be a Stony ground for years and years
[32:36] and years
[32:39] a Stony ground is where they don't have
[32:41] the root of Christ they don't have the
[32:44] ground of a good heart they got a Stony
[32:46] heart and and then when uh when offenses
[32:49] come then then they get offended by the
[32:52] word of God and they forsake the word of
[32:53] God
[32:57] right so when it comes like we've seen
[32:58] when it comes down to who's first family
[33:00] or church they choose family instead of
[33:02] church
[33:03] that's a Stony heart of ground
[33:06] right because they they're offended by
[33:08] the word of God the word of God says put
[33:10] God first put God first but they don't
[33:12] do that they put the family first and it
[33:15] leads into sin in their lives
[33:18] but Paul said if you started off as a
[33:20] good ground continue that's a good
[33:22] ground praise God
[33:25] be rooted in Christ praise God
[33:28] let Christ be your source of strength
[33:31] praise God let Christ be the source of
[33:34] all your vitamins and and and all your
[33:36] minerals praise God in your water and
[33:39] everything you need let Christ satisfy
[33:40] every need that you have praise God
[33:42] let Christ Build You Up into a strong
[33:45] Christian praise God
[33:47] be careful what other men and women say
[33:49] with their enticing words
[33:54] this was the battles these Colossians
[33:56] were going to face and so God had to
[33:58] raise up a prophet to correct him
[34:01] now brother now getting on this teaching
[34:03] this is why we need good Bible teaching
[34:05] every church needs good Bible teaching
[34:07] Bible teaching is a little treacherous
[34:09] at your little you know kind of walking
[34:10] out on thin ice we call it now let me
[34:12] give an example
[34:14] brother Brandon said I know this example
[34:15] because it happened in a church in
[34:17] Minnesota
[34:18] program has one quote where he says the
[34:22] pastor is the husband of the church
[34:26] and so see if there's no Bible
[34:29] if there's no Bible teaching to back
[34:31] that up here's what the pastor did in
[34:32] Minnesota he's still a pastor there
[34:35] he said well I'm the husband to the
[34:37] church
[34:38] so that means he made all the decisions
[34:41] for every family he would call the
[34:43] family in and say you buy this car don't
[34:45] buy this car
[34:47] he would he would ordain the marriages
[34:48] yeah he's still Pastor I met him before
[34:51] and he said no he said this is your
[34:53] daughter well she's got to marry that
[34:54] person
[34:56] or you need to sell this and give this
[34:58] money to the church oh yeah it's real
[34:59] it's right here in America
[35:02] that's where you know
[35:04] if you know we hear these quotes and
[35:06] it's true in one sense you know where
[35:08] the pastor is is guiding the church
[35:10] because he brings the word of God but
[35:12] he's not a husband over the church like
[35:14] like uh like they're trying to teach
[35:17] Like a Shepherd like a pastor's or
[35:19] Shepherd right he's like The Shepherd of
[35:21] the Sheep
[35:22] but this but without Bible teaching it
[35:25] becomes a control it becomes a
[35:27] Antichrist nickel-laden Spirit praise
[35:29] God that controls the people
[35:32] I mean praise God that's the truth not
[35:34] praise God they're doing Antichrist
[35:35] things that's what I mean but that
[35:37] happened it's happening now in America
[35:39] and no wonder people leave them leave
[35:41] those message churches and say well I'm
[35:42] out of the message that never was the
[35:44] message amen
[35:46] they're preaching Antichrist teaching
[35:49] this is the message the Bible's the
[35:51] message the love of God is the message
[35:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[35:54] message praise God
[35:57] so that's why teaching you got to be
[35:59] very careful what you teach the quote
[36:01] you use the scripture you use you got to
[36:03] always go back make sure it's in the
[36:04] Bible praise God
[36:08] oh just like remember just like in the
[36:10] book of Acts this idea came to me as
[36:12] soon as they all came in what did the
[36:14] members do they went out and sold their
[36:15] lands the preachers never told them to
[36:17] do that God let them do that
[36:18] but see with this guy's Church in
[36:20] Minnesota he would have said oh no you
[36:22] got to go sell your land or don't sell
[36:23] your land that's not what the Bible said
[36:25] the Bible said those Believers just felt
[36:27] led to do it and they did it and God
[36:28] bless the church praise God
[36:31] see it's you being led to the Holy
[36:33] Spirit
[36:34] it's you have it's you hearing from God
[36:37] Amen it's you it's you and I every
[36:39] individual hearing what the spirit says
[36:41] to the churches praise God
[36:43] that's just one example just you know to
[36:45] give you some examples
[36:49] oh like that sermon you know of the man
[36:51] who preached the 24 false doctrines
[36:55] he was taking all these uh quotes and
[36:58] misconstruing them
[37:00] and uh he he was saying there was uh
[37:04] he was saying there's like a trial going
[37:07] on in heaven right now and and the
[37:09] Saints could lose their position in
[37:10] heaven impossible
[37:12] impossible remember I preached
[37:14] everybody's long ago but I saw the 24
[37:16] false doctrines see that's because
[37:18] teaching he was trying to teach but he
[37:20] didn't have a gift to teach
[37:23] yeah right it's treacherous you got to
[37:24] be really careful when you're
[37:25] instructing people what to do you got to
[37:27] be really careful you got to make sure
[37:29] if you got a quote I got a scripture
[37:30] right here to back it up praise God
[37:33] amen
[37:36] teaching is a little treacherous you
[37:38] know he said kind of walking out on thin
[37:40] ice we call it but we just feel that
[37:42] maybe at this point at this time it
[37:44] would be a good idea to kind of bring
[37:45] the church to what I think a complete
[37:47] understanding position of what we are in
[37:49] Christ Jesus and sometimes I think
[37:51] preaching is a wonderful thing I believe
[37:53] sometimes brother Beeler that teaching
[37:54] goes beyond that especially to the
[37:56] church now look at that
[37:57] teaching can go beyond preaching
[38:01] that's what we're getting a lot in the
[38:02] message today which I'm glad some
[38:04] message churches are having revivals but
[38:05] they're basically just preaching God's A
[38:07] Healer believe in miracles step in your
[38:10] position you know those are all good
[38:12] things
[38:13] but teaching actually goes beyond that
[38:16] teaching will show you your position in
[38:18] the body of Christ and then you stay
[38:20] there in your your position and then you
[38:22] fulfill the will of God for your life
[38:24] amen
[38:25] Hallelujah
[38:27] he says preaching usually catches The
[38:29] Sinner brings him under condemnation by
[38:32] the word I think conviction might be a
[38:34] better word but same we understand
[38:37] it shows we're lost going to Hell
[38:38] Without Christ right
[38:40] but teaching places a man positioning
[38:42] what he is we can never rightly be able
[38:45] to have faith until positionally we know
[38:48] what we are
[38:49] so see we've got to know which position
[38:51] now it's easy for brothers and sisters
[38:53] like I was sharing with Chris he asked
[38:54] me about women preachers this week why
[38:56] can't women preach you know I showed
[38:57] them about Adam and Eve and the law and
[38:59] the New Testament just like Paul says
[39:02] but Church you know sisters uh how how
[39:05] free that you feel right because you
[39:07] never have to worry am I called to
[39:08] preach right
[39:10] and is that nice sisters to know that
[39:11] you know Brothers have the more battle
[39:13] with that you know am I called to preach
[39:15] what's my position what's my position
[39:17] uh
[39:19] but see when when you hear the word of
[39:21] God preach when you're taught the word
[39:22] of God rather when you're taught the
[39:24] word of God you find your position
[39:25] remember that map I showed last year
[39:27] with the Joshua series you know just you
[39:30] know it's like it's like God is leading
[39:31] into you into your promised land and
[39:33] you've got to possess all your land
[39:36] and teaching will show you these are my
[39:38] gifts these are the relationships I need
[39:40] to have in my life this is my occupation
[39:43] this is what I've been called to do and
[39:46] teaching will place you in there because
[39:48] the Bible gives you instruction and you
[39:50] know what to do because the Bible shows
[39:52] you what to do praise God Amen
[39:54] it's not going to give you something
[39:55] outside the word of God it's going to
[39:57] show you something inside the word of
[39:59] God
[40:00] Hallelujah
[40:04] now verse 8 beware so here's a prophet
[40:08] of God filled with the Holy Ghost one of
[40:10] the stars in Jesus hand and he says
[40:13] beware
[40:14] be careful about people beguiling you
[40:17] with fancy words persuasive words
[40:21] beware unless any man spoil you through
[40:23] philosophy
[40:24] and vain deceit
[40:27] after the tradition of men after the
[40:29] rudiments of the world and not after
[40:32] Christ who is Christ Christ is the word
[40:36] so we have to make sure everything we
[40:37] hear of philosophy everything we hear
[40:39] about a tradition everything about uh
[40:42] principles of the world rudiments means
[40:43] principles
[40:44] it has to have a foundation in Christ
[40:48] beware because this is how Satan tries
[40:50] to deceive many
[40:52] even in the church this Paul's not
[40:54] writing to people outside the church
[40:55] this is the church amen
[40:59] so he lists four things here
[41:02] where people can be deceived
[41:05] now let me read this here's some Modern
[41:07] uh philosophies that we've got to battle
[41:10] today
[41:13] atheism is a claim that there's no God
[41:15] and we know what the Bible says about
[41:16] that a fool says there is no God
[41:21] right but there will be people in the
[41:22] message does God even is God even real
[41:23] was God really with brother Branham or
[41:25] not how can you go from worshiping God
[41:27] and trusting God and then you get
[41:28] deceived well I don't even know if there
[41:30] is a God
[41:31] I don't even know if God was with
[41:32] brother Brandon or not how could you do
[41:34] that Paul said Beware evil spirits will
[41:38] work on people's minds it's the greatest
[41:40] battle ever fall and you ought to thank
[41:41] God if you've got to sound mind today
[41:43] praise God
[41:44] it's the greatest battle ever fall is to
[41:46] keep your sanity in your mind Hallelujah
[41:51] they can go from believing Acts 2 38
[41:54] they can believe Revelation 10 7 Luke 17
[41:57] 30 and then years later I don't even
[41:59] know if there's a God anymore how can
[42:00] you get to that spot
[42:03] because the devil's come in and you did
[42:05] not beware of his lies
[42:11] Church the Bible says how many I love I
[42:13] love when people come up and say I want
[42:14] a closer walk with God God because it's
[42:16] an easy answer you want a closer walk
[42:17] with God draw an eye to God
[42:20] and God is the word
[42:22] you got to spend more time with God
[42:24] what's my answer I want to be closer to
[42:26] God you got to spend more time with God
[42:27] I got a real good Bible answer for you
[42:29] right now
[42:30] you want to be close to God spend time
[42:31] with God
[42:32] but these people over years they don't
[42:34] see they just come to church and that's
[42:35] good that but that's a feeding praise
[42:38] God you got to go home and you got to
[42:39] make it live in your home praise God you
[42:41] got to have prayer services in your home
[42:43] amen where people shout and scream
[42:44] that's a beautiful testimony last night
[42:46] Hallelujah you got to praise God you got
[42:49] to lift you got to feel the prince of
[42:50] God all around you praise God
[42:53] on the job in the home wherever you are
[42:56] in the school you want to feel God's
[42:58] presence wherever you are praise God
[43:02] but they go for years and they don't
[43:03] they no longer feel presence of God at
[43:05] home no longer feel God's Presence at
[43:06] work no longer feel God's presence
[43:09] anywhere
[43:10] because they're slowly talked out of it
[43:14] the second one is agnostic how many
[43:16] heard of agnostics
[43:18] agnostics they their whole premise is
[43:20] there could be a God but there might not
[43:23] be we don't know for sure and if there
[43:25] is one we can't know him
[43:29] yeah it's kind of like on the fence it's
[43:30] like there could be I don't know and if
[43:32] there is we can't know them
[43:34] but the Bible says we can know him in
[43:36] the power of his resurrection and the
[43:38] fellowship of his sufferings amen
[43:40] job said I've heard but now I see amen
[43:44] hallelujah praise God we can know God
[43:46] Amen we can know him by his spirit and
[43:49] by the word of God hallelujah
[43:52] but see these people well you can't
[43:54] really know God in the message you know
[43:55] you really can't understand him is there
[43:57] a god I don't know
[44:00] you know I I guess I'd rather just serve
[44:02] God and just in case when I die if there
[44:03] is a God maybe he'll let me into heaven
[44:05] that's no God shows up there is going to
[44:07] be a judgment everyone is going to have
[44:08] a judgment day for their their their
[44:10] beliefs their deeds whether it was good
[44:12] or evil we're all coming down to
[44:14] judgment and may God help us to be
[44:16] judged now so there's no judgment later
[44:18] there's just rewards later praise God
[44:23] every deed will come into judgment the
[44:26] Bible says
[44:27] every deed
[44:28] so atheism agnosticism
[44:32] you can't know God oh yes you can oh
[44:35] yeah Hallelujah I know him I mean no
[44:37] Jesus praise God
[44:38] I talked to him this morning
[44:41] I'm gonna tell you all right good old
[44:43] song I love that song brother
[44:45] I talked to him today amen thank God
[44:48] Amen see when God answers your prayers
[44:50] you have a dream or a vision or
[44:51] something Supernatural it proves you
[44:54] know Jesus Christ amen amen
[44:56] amen I know him Hallelujah
[44:58] now do I want to know more of course but
[45:01] I know him
[45:03] Hallelujah I know him when that sweet
[45:05] Spirit comes on me praise God I know in
[45:08] the conviction of the Holy Spirit comes
[45:09] on me because it's the spirit of Truth
[45:12] see when you know the truth and you're
[45:14] supposed to do it that's when God's
[45:16] anointing is all over you praise God
[45:18] because it's a spirit of Truth well I
[45:21] shouldn't do this I should do this when
[45:23] you know that's the truth then that's
[45:24] the spirit of God anointing you and the
[45:26] Bible said walk in this mirror and you
[45:28] shall not obey the lust of the flesh
[45:30] praise God
[45:32] so often we're walking the spirit we
[45:34] don't even realize it when we're walking
[45:35] obedience we are walking in the Holy
[45:37] Spirit praise God
[45:44] you know that makes me think of a
[45:45] scripture here let me look it up real
[45:47] quick
[45:53] yeah let's go to uh
[45:56] Luke 5 17.
[45:59] remember Church there's different
[46:00] anointings of the Holy Spirit
[46:03] like I just said we might not even feel
[46:06] the anointing honest but if we're
[46:07] walking obedience and we're purposely
[46:09] trying to not give in the lust of the
[46:11] Flesh and sin throughout the day we are
[46:13] anointed with the Holy Spirit
[46:16] now this one here in Luke 5 17 Malco you
[46:18] want to read that Luke 5 17. I'm sorry
[46:20] you're not there that's okay are you
[46:21] gonna get there
[46:22] sorry about that I thought you were
[46:23] there buddy
[46:25] Luke five you want to read that Luke 5
[46:26] 17.
[46:40] now see here the power of God is a
[46:43] miracle power amen the anointing is just
[46:46] filling the place right it's a different
[46:49] kind of anointing we may not feel like
[46:50] when we're on the job or at home like
[46:52] God is well God is really anointing here
[46:55] right
[46:56] but in this case if the power was there
[46:58] to heal in other words a great anointed
[47:01] to come and people just had to step into
[47:03] that anointing and just agree with that
[47:04] anointing praise God
[47:06] they just had to follow that anointing
[47:08] praise God but all throughout this so
[47:09] this this scripture is a great example
[47:11] of when God's power is just filling a
[47:13] place you know you feel it on your flesh
[47:15] or you're going to cry like I usually
[47:17] cry under those kind of anointings you
[47:19] know
[47:20] but even if it's not you can still be
[47:22] walking in the anointing of the Holy
[47:24] Spirit praise God
[47:26] Hallelujah
[47:28] and God's power can be there to heal
[47:30] God's power can be there to deliver
[47:32] praise God I just want to encourage you
[47:34] that you're what when you're walking
[47:35] obedience God's spirit is anointing you
[47:38] praise God the power of God is upon you
[47:40] Hallelujah you're you're obeying the
[47:42] word of God God is anointing you he's
[47:44] walking with you he's protecting you
[47:46] he's blessing your life amen
[47:50] may not even feel it
[47:52] we'd say like a great powerful anointing
[47:55] like oh God is sweeping through this
[47:56] room we may not even feel like that but
[47:58] if we're obeying the word of God God's
[48:00] spirit is here praise God
[48:02] Hallelujah
[48:05] so I just want to make sure I read that
[48:07] by God's grace
[48:08] that kind of came on my heart before
[48:09] service now the third type is a modern
[48:13] philosophy today is called empiricists
[48:16] it's a hard one to say
[48:18] empiricists they assume that experience
[48:21] is the basis of knowing all truth
[48:25] so they say well I've never had an
[48:27] experience with Jesus so I don't think
[48:28] he's true
[48:30] see that's a philosophy
[48:32] well if God never raised anybody from
[48:34] the dead then he must not be real
[48:37] see yeah you have to go by an experience
[48:39] they say you've got to have the
[48:40] experience to know
[48:42] right
[48:44] and but that's but everybody has a
[48:46] different experience
[48:48] right not everybody's going to have
[48:49] Noah's experience
[48:51] and we can we can understand a lot of
[48:52] the things he went through but none of
[48:54] us may have that experience none of us
[48:55] may have Moses experience
[48:59] see so these philosophies uh well you
[49:02] know the Satan saying well you've got to
[49:03] have an experience just like me we found
[49:05] that out with the baptism Holy Ghost
[49:07] some people say to God some people don't
[49:08] it doesn't come the same way for
[49:10] everybody but one thing it will produce
[49:13] is the love for the word of God it will
[49:15] guide you into the truth of the word
[49:17] praise God like I love how brother says
[49:19] in the forest seal you might dance you
[49:21] might shout you might speak in tongues
[49:22] he says it doesn't matter what form it
[49:24] comes in as long as you obey the word of
[49:27] God Amen
[49:29] Hallelujah I think that's a beautiful
[49:31] quote
[49:31] I don't care what forms it comes and he
[49:34] says as long as something happens he
[49:36] said that's the main thing praise God oh
[49:38] God just let something happen to each
[49:40] one of us amen
[49:42] something Supernatural happened praise
[49:44] God
[49:45] where I know I'm changed Hallelujah
[49:48] I'm not what I used to be
[49:50] Hallelujah
[49:52] but beware of philosophies
[49:55] well you gotta have the you have to have
[49:56] the same experience
[49:58] you've got to speak something into
[49:59] existence now that's where the seven
[50:01] Thunders went off they said in order to
[50:03] have virtue remember in order to have
[50:04] virtue they said someone has to touch
[50:07] you and then you have to feel that you
[50:09] both of you have to feel the healing go
[50:11] out of you into the other person that's
[50:13] what that's what Joseph Coleman said
[50:15] he's dead and gone now but he was
[50:16] ordained by brother Brandon but then of
[50:18] course he fell away in his false
[50:19] Doctrine
[50:20] he said you don't even have the
[50:21] anointing of virtue unless someone
[50:23] touches you and they get instantly
[50:25] healed and you both feel it
[50:27] that's not that's an experienced thing
[50:29] that's an empirical thing we've got to
[50:31] have this experience no you don't
[50:33] the Bible said do all gifts of healing
[50:35] now who's right the false preacher or
[50:37] the Bible that's pretty easy one answer
[50:39] you see but yet that'll deceive people
[50:41] how do they get deceived by that it's
[50:42] through philosophy and vain deceit
[50:44] they're not focused on Christ amen
[50:49] sounds like I mean they're using Christ
[50:51] scriptures right virtue went out of
[50:52] Christ but without looking at all the
[50:54] other virtue scriptures for example Ruth
[50:58] Boaz said all the people of this city
[51:00] know you're a virtuous woman and she
[51:03] wasn't walking around healing people
[51:04] you're healed you're healed you're
[51:05] healed you're healed that wasn't what
[51:07] she was she was picking up all the wheat
[51:09] or The Barley rather
[51:10] she was just humbly staying in her
[51:12] position
[51:13] amen may God help us to stay in position
[51:15] Hallelujah
[51:18] you gotta look at all the scriptures on
[51:19] virtue
[51:22] that's pretty good sermon it's a good
[51:24] enough sermon to name somebody after I
[51:25] praise God
[51:27] I mean we all want the virtue of God in
[51:29] our lives
[51:31] but see that's how Satan look he can
[51:33] take a scripture in a quote and then he
[51:34] can just deceive the masses with that
[51:37] and then he'll beat you down and and
[51:39] bring you into submission to that right
[51:41] that's what that's what happened in the
[51:42] seven Thunders movement I didn't happen
[51:43] in New York
[51:45] right and then they said if you're not
[51:47] shouting and screaming and dancing every
[51:49] service you're backslidden
[51:51] I know that because uh Craig and Dave
[51:53] and brother Brooks went there and the
[51:55] preachers were blasting them because
[51:56] they weren't worshiping the exact same
[51:58] way they were
[52:02] yeah
[52:03] so see how see how we have to be aware
[52:06] see everything we have to be very
[52:07] careful what's coming across the pulpit
[52:09] and we got to be very careful what we're
[52:11] listening to from other people
[52:14] a holy ghost-filled prophet Paul took
[52:16] his time to tell these people these
[52:18] things so why so they would find all
[52:20] their Treasures in Christ
[52:22] amen thank God
[52:25] find all your Treasures in Christ the
[52:27] next one is the rationalist a rat a
[52:30] rationalist assumes they can reason
[52:32] their way to truth
[52:35] but Church all human mental capacities
[52:37] are limited
[52:40] like here's a tough one with that why do
[52:42] bad things happen to good people
[52:44] see and because people can't reasonably
[52:46] ration this well why was my child born
[52:48] with with this disease
[52:50] why did my child die of cancer
[52:53] like they can't rationalize it so
[52:55] because of this philosophy they just say
[52:57] well God must not be real God must be
[52:59] against me so I'm just gonna I'm just
[53:01] gonna I'm gonna leave Christ
[53:04] but my wife reminded me of a good
[53:06] scripture in Exodus Moses was
[53:08] complaining to God and said I can't talk
[53:09] and God said who made your mouth
[53:13] he said don't you know that I made the
[53:15] lame
[53:16] the Halt and the blind
[53:19] and the church said
[53:21] uh you've got some good good thinking
[53:23] now
[53:24] God make some people deformed
[53:27] because there's some testimony he's
[53:29] going to bring out of that
[53:31] like I was listening to a sermon last
[53:32] night from Louisiana that had a
[53:33] beautiful testimony some message
[53:35] believer got saved and then he died the
[53:37] next year and they're like what that's
[53:39] my best friend
[53:41] he said they went to the funeral it was
[53:42] out in the middle of Mississippi there's
[53:44] no message Church
[53:45] and that he went there the preacher it
[53:48] was like his best one of his best
[53:49] friends that died after a year in the
[53:50] message and they said it right around
[53:52] the table after the funeral they just
[53:53] started talking and four people got
[53:55] saved
[53:56] four people got saved after God had to
[53:58] take home a young man
[53:59] and there's no preacher so God had to
[54:01] send in a preacher there at a funeral
[54:04] and the Bible says don't you know God
[54:05] takes some people young to be able to
[54:08] avoid evil things that may happen later
[54:10] in life
[54:13] a rationalist though can't handle that
[54:15] well that doesn't make any sense to me
[54:16] it doesn't matter what makes sense to us
[54:18] because we are not the author and
[54:20] finisher of this world Jesus Christ is
[54:22] the author and finisher of our faith
[54:24] Hallelujah
[54:26] we just speak this world new existence
[54:28] we don't have control over nothing you
[54:29] can't even keep your heart beaten it's
[54:31] automatic praise God you can't keep
[54:33] anything you can't make enough oxygen
[54:35] you can you can't make yourself live
[54:37] through AI we talk about that you cannot
[54:39] make yourself living on God's in control
[54:41] God's a great one so we must cast aside
[54:43] all rational thoughts and we must accept
[54:45] the word of God hallelujah
[54:48] because we know one thing for sure he
[54:49] created all things
[54:52] and the last one the last main
[54:54] philosophy today is theological liberal
[54:57] liberalism which means truth changes
[55:00] with time and The Church Must therefore
[55:02] adapt to changes in the culture
[55:05] that's where a lot of famous preachers
[55:07] are doing today letting homosexuals into
[55:08] the pulpit
[55:10] right well my like the famous preacher
[55:12] said my view on LGBT is all is evolving
[55:16] Church there's nothing to evolve there's
[55:19] nothing to change because God's word
[55:20] don't change praise God
[55:22] Hallelujah
[55:25] and the Bible said you add to it he said
[55:27] God will add the pledge to your life if
[55:29] you take away from it God takes your
[55:31] name out of The Book of Life how many of
[55:32] these people are going to be in heaven
[55:34] how many famous preacher is going to be
[55:36] very hard for them to get to heaven but
[55:38] we're not ones who are liberal with the
[55:39] word of God we believe the word of God
[55:41] we're traditionalists in other words we
[55:43] just stay with what God's word says amen
[55:46] Hallelujah quite a New Year's Eve or New
[55:48] Year's Day service here
[55:50] got a thought
[55:51] I had a lot of thoughts I had a hard
[55:53] time kind of knowing which way to go
[55:54] today hopefully this is a blessing to
[55:55] you by God's grace
[55:57] now George I want to say this not every
[55:59] tradition you you hold is sinful you
[56:02] know we hear the word tradition we're
[56:03] instantly like oh Traditions are up now
[56:05] that's true with Jesus said traditions
[56:07] of men the Pharisees said she's had
[56:09] traditions of men
[56:10] but you ever read this scripture
[56:13] therefore Brethren Stand Fast and hold
[56:15] the Traditions which ye have been taught
[56:17] whether by word
[56:20] or by an epistle
[56:23] yeah brother Chris
[56:26] epistle is a letter like one of the
[56:28] Apostles would write
[56:30] good question brother
[56:32] so see Paul was telling the Thessalonian
[56:34] icons
[56:35] or Thessalonians he was saying you know
[56:38] if you have a good tradition that you
[56:40] hold
[56:40] and it's a it's a holy thing keep that
[56:43] tradition
[56:44] it might not be written in the word but
[56:47] as long as it don't take you away from
[56:48] Christ there's nothing wrong with it
[56:50] that's called a Christian Liberty
[56:53] praise God
[56:54] like like for example brother bam had
[56:56] those uh sunrise services now not every
[56:59] year he did it he didn't do it later on
[57:01] in the 1960s but he would have a 6 a.m
[57:03] service on Easter morning now how many
[57:04] want to come at 6 30 6 a.m on Easter
[57:07] I'll be waiting for you
[57:09] obviously I'll be calling texting you
[57:11] what are the other notifications off
[57:12] turn on your notifications why is your
[57:14] phone off we got to have church
[57:16] Sunrise Service it's just a tradition
[57:18] you know in the early church I was
[57:20] reading brother Brown said this too
[57:21] in the early church after like a 100 A.D
[57:24] they wouldn't let people get baptized
[57:26] for six months
[57:29] because they were finding so many people
[57:30] get baptized and fall away because they
[57:32] weren't really dedicated
[57:33] so they started tradition
[57:35] it was 180 yeah I was in that Time
[57:37] Magazine it was in that Time magazine
[57:38] article where they baptized the name of
[57:40] Lord Jesus in Rome
[57:42] they found so many people come in and go
[57:44] out come in and go out and so they just
[57:46] made this tradition we're just let's
[57:47] let's be dedicated let's see if they
[57:50] really want to be baptized
[57:52] no I don't know I wasn't there
[57:55] but if that tradition was okay by God
[57:57] then they could have kept that
[57:59] now the Bible says to be baptized right
[58:01] away
[58:01] but then the devil come in and was
[58:03] perverting that
[58:06] so that's just an example I don't know
[58:07] whether it's right or wrong I'm just
[58:08] saying I'm trying to give you an idea of
[58:10] a tradition
[58:12] I want you to see that you know Satan
[58:14] will come in and they'll try to he'll
[58:16] try to get people under condemnation and
[58:19] God doesn't lead us to condemnation God
[58:21] leads us to Freedom you are free in
[58:24] Christ Jesus Hallelujah
[58:25] Hallelujah
[58:27] you're free to obey all the word of God
[58:29] and have Liberties inside of it
[58:34] so why you know why
[58:36] how do we why is he warning us about
[58:39] these philosophies because in Jesus
[58:41] Christ is all the fullness of God
[58:45] so be careful any other source that
[58:46] we're getting inspiration from or any
[58:48] other source we're getting influenced by
[58:50] be very careful because all of God is in
[58:53] Christ Hallelujah
[58:55] and in Christ is every treasure
[58:59] anything that's valuable during 2023 was
[59:03] already in Christ
[59:05] hallelujah amen any testimony we're
[59:08] going to have this coming year it's
[59:09] going to be valuable it's going to be a
[59:10] treasure because it was in the mind of
[59:12] God first Hallelujah
[59:14] something from the word of God that came
[59:16] out of the word of God and manifested
[59:17] our lives it had to be in Christ first
[59:20] Hallelujah
[59:23] and look at this church you are complete
[59:25] in Christ
[59:27] not philosophies
[59:30] not wisdom of men not traditions of men
[59:32] well you are complete in Christ he is
[59:35] the head of all principality and powers
[59:37] in other words every Power is subject to
[59:39] Jesus Christ
[59:41] Hallelujah
[59:44] now here we get into now the churches
[59:47] the church in colossae or colossi was
[59:50] influenced by Judaism now we're getting
[59:52] into legalism
[59:57] so you're completing Christ in whom also
[59:59] ye are circumcised with a circumcision
[1:00:02] without hands in putting off the body of
[1:00:05] sins of the flesh by the circumcision of
[1:00:07] Christ
[1:00:10] so circumcision was a surgery done on
[1:00:12] boys to permanently cut away excess
[1:00:15] flesh
[1:00:17] and Paul uses a symbolism
[1:00:20] here you're made perfect in Christ
[1:00:22] because Christ has cut away your
[1:00:24] previous sinful life and it's not coming
[1:00:27] back amen it's permanently cut away
[1:00:29] you've had a permanent surgery you're
[1:00:31] complete in Christ amen
[1:00:34] Hallelujah
[1:00:36] Paul's saying don't don't find any uh
[1:00:38] don't find any uh
[1:00:41] Pleasures in life from the things of the
[1:00:43] world or philosophies you're complete in
[1:00:45] Christ Christ completely separated you
[1:00:47] from your past life and now you're
[1:00:49] complete you're better you're better
[1:00:51] with Christ in fact that's all you have
[1:00:53] is just you and Christ amen
[1:00:58] buried with him in baptism
[1:01:00] so we get this illustration baptism
[1:01:02] means the old Chris was buried right
[1:01:05] just like the old flesh was put away
[1:01:07] with circumcision
[1:01:08] where also you're risen with him through
[1:01:12] the faith of the operation of God who
[1:01:15] has raised us from the dead how many
[1:01:17] raised from the dead today praise God oh
[1:01:19] yeah absolutely amen things I used to do
[1:01:22] I do them no more praise God
[1:01:24] Hallelujah
[1:01:27] see this is how we overcome philosophies
[1:01:30] deceitfulness of men and women
[1:01:32] and also Jewish legalism
[1:01:36] is all the treasures are in Christ
[1:01:40] you're buried with him in baptism
[1:01:42] wherein also you're risen with him
[1:01:44] through the faith of the operation of
[1:01:46] God hallelujah who raised him from the
[1:01:49] dead Hallelujah oh my
[1:01:53] I mean the difference between the first
[1:01:55] time I was baptized and the third time I
[1:01:58] was baptized is unbelievable
[1:02:00] the first time I was baptized yes I
[1:02:02] wanted to try to serve God I went down I
[1:02:04] was so happy when I come up when I was
[1:02:06] father son Holy Ghost when I was 16 I
[1:02:07] got baptized in the Assembly of God
[1:02:09] Church
[1:02:10] Aunt Betsy was there Dustin might have
[1:02:12] been there too no I don't think so
[1:02:14] but I felt good but as soon as I got to
[1:02:17] the car cam and Cam and Sam turned on
[1:02:19] 92.5 KISS FM and I specifically remember
[1:02:21] I just started moving and singing along
[1:02:23] with those rock songs and that was the
[1:02:25] end of my walk with God right there it
[1:02:27] lasted less than an hour
[1:02:30] but the next time the last time I was
[1:02:32] baptized the third time I was baptized
[1:02:34] rather Hallelujah
[1:02:36] I went there to the waters and brother
[1:02:38] Brooks I was talking with him I said
[1:02:39] brother Brooks I deserve to die I
[1:02:42] deserve to go to hell but Jesus Christ
[1:02:43] paid my price amen and I'm showing
[1:02:46] everybody that I'm going to be baptized
[1:02:48] in Jesus Christ's name today Hallelujah
[1:02:50] and I drove three hours to be baptized I
[1:02:52] went down the water I come up and I've
[1:02:54] been more than a conqueror ever since
[1:02:56] that day praise God I got in the car and
[1:02:59] I turned on brother Branham instead of
[1:03:00] 92.5 KISS FM
[1:03:03] I turned on some good sermon praise God
[1:03:06] to listen to the word of God hallelujah
[1:03:09] the old man is dead a new man is risen a
[1:03:12] new daughter of God Is Risen through the
[1:03:14] operation of faith faith trust has come
[1:03:16] into our Revelations come into your
[1:03:18] heart your dad's your own life and
[1:03:20] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:03:25] I was looking at some of those knives
[1:03:27] for circumcision online you should do
[1:03:28] that sometime
[1:03:29] not very pleasant
[1:03:31] if that shivers down my spine I don't
[1:03:33] know about all of you but I would send
[1:03:34] shivers down my spine
[1:03:36] and this is what the word of God does it
[1:03:38] separates us from our past life
[1:03:41] it's a complete separation
[1:03:44] Hallelujah
[1:03:45] those things are dead our former life
[1:03:48] was dead and our new life were complete
[1:03:50] in the new life in Christ Jesus our lord
[1:03:54] Glory
[1:03:56] and you being dead in your sins
[1:03:58] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:04:00] hath he quickened together with him
[1:04:03] having forgiven you some trespasses
[1:04:07] and the church said
[1:04:09] oh let's all say all ready oh
[1:04:12] see you are forgiven all trespasses
[1:04:16] God cannot hold things against you right
[1:04:20] God God cannot say you're Quicken but
[1:04:22] you're still dead
[1:04:23] or you're partly Quicken but
[1:04:25] but part dead
[1:04:27] no the blood of Jesus Christ in heaven
[1:04:29] separates you from all your sin
[1:04:33] right like that Revelation I got about
[1:04:35] job you're perfect in heaven but you're
[1:04:37] a process of your work in progress on
[1:04:40] Earth
[1:04:41] so you're so perfect in heaven you got a
[1:04:43] theophany body waiting for you in heaven
[1:04:46] amen a word body you got a perfect word
[1:04:49] body waiting for there and the Bible
[1:04:50] said they always behold the face of the
[1:04:52] Father in heaven
[1:04:53] you have a theophany body I have a body
[1:04:55] waiting there it must be labeled Jesse
[1:04:57] Smith Liberty and Church age you know
[1:04:59] 1980 to whatever I don't know whatever
[1:05:00] it has my spiritual DNA number on there
[1:05:03] I don't know what number it is maybe my
[1:05:04] spiritual Social Security number's on
[1:05:06] there but I've got an eternal body
[1:05:07] waiting there and as soon as this body
[1:05:09] would die the soul and the spirit go to
[1:05:12] that body praise God
[1:05:14] so in heaven God knows God sees me I'm
[1:05:17] perfect I'm already completing him
[1:05:18] praise God Amen I've already got
[1:05:20] representation I'm already beloved in
[1:05:23] heaven I'm accepted in heaven Hallelujah
[1:05:25] I am God's beloved Hallelujah
[1:05:27] so are you praise God so are you
[1:05:32] you're dead
[1:05:33] from your sins
[1:05:35] and You're Made Alive you're forgiven
[1:05:37] all your trespasses
[1:05:39] and the Bible said he blotted out verse
[1:05:42] 14. he said he blotted out
[1:05:45] the handwriting that was against you
[1:05:46] that was your certificate of debt so you
[1:05:49] had a certificate that said you you owe
[1:05:51] God all this because of all your sins
[1:05:55] there was a list of all the wrongs
[1:05:57] you've done but the Bible said that was
[1:05:59] blotted out
[1:06:02] and the Bible said it was against you
[1:06:03] you had a record of all your wrongs
[1:06:05] against you but Jesus took it out of the
[1:06:08] way and he nailed it to his cross amen
[1:06:12] what do you say on the cross it is
[1:06:14] finished praise God it is paid for
[1:06:16] praise God think about that all the
[1:06:18] things you ever did all the all the all
[1:06:20] the Commandments you broke Satan had
[1:06:22] this list and he could accuse you accuse
[1:06:23] you but God took it and nailed it to
[1:06:26] Jesus cross and now it's paid for you're
[1:06:28] redeemed you have a new life a new
[1:06:30] creature forgiven of everything praise
[1:06:32] God that's what I call Redemption praise
[1:06:35] God hallelujah
[1:06:37] this is what Paul's trying to show them
[1:06:38] to help them overcome these philosophies
[1:06:46] can agnosticism wash away all your sins
[1:06:49] can rationalism rationalism wash away
[1:06:52] all your sins
[1:06:53] no
[1:06:54] can legalism wash away our sins no
[1:06:56] because as soon as you break one thing
[1:06:57] oh and I'm going to hell
[1:07:00] no but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:02] perfects you praise God forgives all
[1:07:04] your sins amen forgives all your
[1:07:07] iniquities praise God
[1:07:09] he nailed it to the cross
[1:07:11] and having spoiled principalities and
[1:07:13] Powers he made a show of them I'm sorry
[1:07:16] he made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:07:18] over them
[1:07:20] now church this word spoil means
[1:07:22] disarmed
[1:07:24] Jesus disarmed all the powers that were
[1:07:28] against you
[1:07:30] in other words he took away all their
[1:07:33] ability to be able to attack you right
[1:07:36] and over I should say like this overcome
[1:07:38] you
[1:07:39] all the authority that they had over the
[1:07:42] Old Testament Saint Satan had all this
[1:07:44] authority over the Old Testament Saints
[1:07:46] all that Jesus conquered and he took
[1:07:48] away the keys of death and Hell praise
[1:07:50] God Amen he took all those Powers away
[1:07:54] and that's what I love what the Bible
[1:07:55] says now if he's took it away their
[1:07:57] their weapons the Bible said there's no
[1:08:00] weapon that's formed against us shall
[1:08:02] prosper praise God
[1:08:03] Jesus has disarmed them right the only
[1:08:06] way we fall is when we when we let we
[1:08:08] open ourselves up to those weapons
[1:08:09] praise God but the weapons cannot defeat
[1:08:12] us because we have a greater weapon we
[1:08:14] have the blood of Jesus Christ we have
[1:08:16] the word of God hallelujah and our
[1:08:18] enemies been disarmed and look we've got
[1:08:20] the word of God we're fighting an enemy
[1:08:22] who's are we fighting a line with no
[1:08:24] teeth
[1:08:25] we're fighting an enemy who is disarmed
[1:08:28] has no weapons but here we stand with
[1:08:30] the word of God Amen what a blessing
[1:08:33] praise oh my church that makes a
[1:08:35] spiritual battle just look unfair praise
[1:08:37] God
[1:08:38] Jesus has disarmed your enemy and you're
[1:08:40] standing with the armor of God and the
[1:08:42] sword of the spirit praise God
[1:08:44] oh God thank God
[1:08:47] he triumphed over all these enemies
[1:08:50] I'm trying to get down to this end of
[1:08:52] this chapter I'm going to try to speed
[1:08:53] up by God's grace
[1:08:55] I want to try to get make some progress
[1:08:56] here verse 16.
[1:08:58] so because of this because all your sins
[1:09:00] are forgiven let no man therefore judge
[1:09:03] you and meet or and drink or respect of
[1:09:05] a holy day or of a new moon or of
[1:09:06] Sabbath day of course speaking of Jewish
[1:09:08] traditions
[1:09:10] right Paul told those Colossians don't
[1:09:12] let any man judge you because Jesus paid
[1:09:14] for all your sins
[1:09:16] but if there's some certain tradition
[1:09:17] you do if there's some certain belief
[1:09:19] you do that helps you feel closer to God
[1:09:20] you can do it within the liberty of the
[1:09:22] Holy Spirit
[1:09:23] remember Paul kept a valve not we don't
[1:09:25] have time to go there in Acts 18. he let
[1:09:27] his hair grow long now look at that the
[1:09:28] very man
[1:09:30] the very man who said men should not
[1:09:32] have long hair
[1:09:34] kept the Nazarite vowel and let his hair
[1:09:36] grow we don't know how long it went but
[1:09:37] when he went to Jerusalem the Bible said
[1:09:39] he shaved his head after the end of his
[1:09:41] vow was over isn't that something
[1:09:44] ah now I don't expect you Brothers to
[1:09:46] have dreads now coming in next year
[1:09:49] I mean you could do that but you're
[1:09:51] really pushing it
[1:09:53] he kept about we don't know how long the
[1:09:54] vow was
[1:09:56] but he had the Liberty to keep this
[1:09:58] Nazarite vow
[1:10:00] because it helped him feel closer to
[1:10:02] Jesus
[1:10:05] now this is the verse I use about you
[1:10:07] know giving gifts to my children on
[1:10:08] Christmas
[1:10:10] like that's why I was talking about amen
[1:10:12] my Christmas is a sacred time for us we
[1:10:14] get to we get to sing more about Jesus
[1:10:15] we get to talk more we read more Bible
[1:10:17] verses now this year we didn't because
[1:10:18] Christmas was on a Sunday we come right
[1:10:20] to church and heard about Jesus well we
[1:10:22] come here and Pastor Frozen went to my
[1:10:23] house
[1:10:24] a little different situation this year
[1:10:26] but
[1:10:28] but you see we when we're really
[1:10:30] forgiven we don't let anybody judge us
[1:10:32] in other words it doesn't bother me what
[1:10:33] they say about me
[1:10:34] because I'm free in Christ
[1:10:37] I'm not a servant to sin
[1:10:39] this is a Christian Liberty I have
[1:10:42] see
[1:10:43] you got to live above that because it's
[1:10:45] Satan trying to make you feel
[1:10:46] discouraged Satan trying to discourage
[1:10:48] you right Satan's trying to make you
[1:10:49] feel condemned
[1:10:51] but if you're in Christ you're a new
[1:10:52] creature you're complete in Christ and
[1:10:55] no man will spoil you with vain
[1:10:57] philosophies or deceits
[1:11:01] go to Romans 14 5 there
[1:11:04] see all these Liberties are just Shadows
[1:11:07] but the real thing is Christ
[1:11:11] Romans 14 verse 5.
[1:11:14] got it there Emma you want to read that
[1:11:15] Emma got it
[1:11:29] see it doesn't matter if whatever day
[1:11:31] you esteem more that's your day
[1:11:34] in other words draw closer to God that
[1:11:36] day
[1:11:37] see
[1:11:38] that's why I was telling my wife I was
[1:11:40] telling somebody else you know if it's a
[1:11:42] sin
[1:11:43] uh if it's wrong for me to give my kids
[1:11:46] gifts at Christmas
[1:11:48] well then there's no Christian Liberty
[1:11:49] then for that day
[1:11:51] then the Bible would have to
[1:11:52] consistently condemn that day
[1:11:55] but the Bible don't condemn that day
[1:11:58] right
[1:12:00] so see I don't let other people judge me
[1:12:02] I let Jesus judge me
[1:12:04] Hallelujah
[1:12:06] and because of this because the truth it
[1:12:08] sets the people free from being
[1:12:09] condemned
[1:12:10] it says I'm free from the lies and the
[1:12:12] philosophies of man see all these things
[1:12:15] all these Liberties are a shadow to come
[1:12:17] but the body is Christ the body
[1:12:19] Believers is Christ Hallelujah now
[1:12:21] here's the balance for us uh brother
[1:12:23] Chris First Corinthians 8 13.
[1:12:28] First Corinthians 8 13.
[1:12:34] and he's a new believer that's why I
[1:12:36] called you know his name wherefore if me
[1:12:38] make my brother to offend I will eat no
[1:12:40] flesh while the world standeth lest I
[1:12:42] make my brother to offend
[1:12:44] in other words we have different
[1:12:45] Liberties as Christians
[1:12:47] but if anything we do causes somebody to
[1:12:49] sin then we should stop doing it
[1:12:52] like Christians have Liberty to drink
[1:12:53] wine now the reason was because in those
[1:12:55] days they didn't have all the water
[1:12:57] filtering systems like we got today so
[1:12:59] water many times wasn't good to drink
[1:13:01] so they had to have watered down wine if
[1:13:03] I'm not mistaken
[1:13:05] right
[1:13:06] that's why Jesus drank wine because that
[1:13:08] was it was healthier than just straight
[1:13:10] water
[1:13:11] right because of all the diseases in
[1:13:13] there or whatever bacteria whatever
[1:13:14] you'd have
[1:13:15] well now today's different
[1:13:18] now we have Liberty to do that brother
[1:13:19] Chris but you'll never see me drinking
[1:13:21] wine except here at Communion
[1:13:24] oh amen good yeah yeah I'm not I'm just
[1:13:26] I'm explaining to you a liberty
[1:13:29] Hallelujah Glory
[1:13:31] so we have Liberties you know with with
[1:13:33] uh wine we have liberties with jewelry
[1:13:36] you know I wrote a book on that
[1:13:38] liberties with holy days liberties with
[1:13:41] vows we have all these liberties
[1:13:43] but we have to make sure everything we
[1:13:45] do
[1:13:45] is is Godly and it doesn't cause other
[1:13:48] people to sin
[1:13:50] so like with wine if if I went out to
[1:13:52] Applebee's and somebody saw me drinking
[1:13:53] a beer there
[1:13:54] or somebody drink it I wouldn't drink
[1:13:56] beer but if you saw wine they said oh if
[1:13:59] a pastor can drink well that means I can
[1:14:00] go get drunk then that would be a sin
[1:14:02] for me to do that
[1:14:04] but if they come into church and I'm
[1:14:05] drinking wine here
[1:14:06] and I don't get drunk well then they
[1:14:08] can't use that against me
[1:14:10] but if they see me drunk out there at
[1:14:11] Applebee's well yeah that that's causing
[1:14:13] other people to sin and that would be
[1:14:15] wrong
[1:14:16] that's why you'll never see me drink
[1:14:17] alcohol except right here
[1:14:20] see all these Liberties are Shadow
[1:14:22] things that come but the body is Christ
[1:14:24] verse 18. let no man deceive you of your
[1:14:27] reward now see look listen church people
[1:14:29] that get caught up in some of these
[1:14:30] things they lose some of their reward
[1:14:34] in a voluntary humility so it sounds
[1:14:37] humble but they're really not being
[1:14:38] humble they're they're legalistic these
[1:14:40] were Jewish legalists
[1:14:42] and they worshiped Angels now we have a
[1:14:44] lot of that with uh
[1:14:47] the New Apostolic movement which is like
[1:14:50] the Bethel churches the hill song
[1:14:52] churches some of these people say they
[1:14:53] talk to angels well if it says anything
[1:14:55] outside of the word that's not an angel
[1:14:56] of God that's a fallen angel
[1:15:00] and some of them act like their angel is
[1:15:02] like greater than God or something
[1:15:05] see now look they look so humble but
[1:15:07] y'all be careful and they're actually
[1:15:09] worshiping Angels well I heard from an
[1:15:10] angel the angel took me here the angel
[1:15:12] did me there
[1:15:14] and they're intruding into those things
[1:15:15] which he had not seen vainly puffed up
[1:15:17] in his fleshy mind that's why I love the
[1:15:19] angel that visited brother Brown always
[1:15:21] pointed him back to the word of God Amen
[1:15:23] he sent me I'm going to give you two
[1:15:25] signs just like Moses had two signs amen
[1:15:28] hallelujah
[1:15:30] about the tent Vision brother I'm going
[1:15:32] to preach on this whole thing later the
[1:15:33] angel said don't you know the tent
[1:15:34] Vision the in the tent Vision Brother
[1:15:36] Band went in a little tent and people
[1:15:37] are going in there coming out getting
[1:15:38] healed
[1:15:40] and brother I said what was the tent
[1:15:41] Vision the angel said don't you know our
[1:15:43] Lord says go into the prayer closet and
[1:15:45] pray and when you're and you pray there
[1:15:47] I'll reward you openly praise God see
[1:15:50] the angel always has a Bible answer
[1:15:52] praise God if he's a real angel of the
[1:15:54] Lord
[1:15:55] hallelujah but these demonic people they
[1:15:59] worship the angel and they have a
[1:16:01] pretend humility but a really humble
[1:16:03] person obeys the word of God
[1:16:08] see and not holding the head from which
[1:16:10] all the body and joints and bands having
[1:16:13] nourishment ministered and knit together
[1:16:15] increases with the increase of God
[1:16:18] so they're beholding Angels they're
[1:16:20] they're focusing on traditions and
[1:16:21] philosophies instead of holding on to
[1:16:23] Christ
[1:16:25] and increasing in more of the word more
[1:16:27] of the word more of the word that's what
[1:16:29] we need all the time not more of my
[1:16:30] thoughts more of the word of God
[1:16:32] hallelujah
[1:16:35] wherefore if you be dead with Christ
[1:16:36] from the rudiments of the world that
[1:16:37] means principles of the world
[1:16:40] like philosophies
[1:16:42] why as though living in the world are
[1:16:44] you subject to ordinances see these
[1:16:46] people are getting taken over by you
[1:16:48] can't worship at this new moon day you
[1:16:50] can't eat that you can't drink that you
[1:16:51] can't do this day
[1:16:53] see they were getting over they were
[1:16:56] getting overtaken by deceiving spirits
[1:16:59] and church let me just say this there is
[1:17:01] a awful critical spirit going around the
[1:17:03] message right now
[1:17:04] it's trying to get people to criticize
[1:17:06] one another and also criticize brother
[1:17:08] Branham
[1:17:09] this is one great thing we're battling
[1:17:10] right now
[1:17:12] this critical spirit
[1:17:15] see but what does the Bible say hold on
[1:17:17] to Christ he's the head of all things
[1:17:20] amen he's the head of everything hold on
[1:17:22] to him
[1:17:24] if you see and stay connected to the
[1:17:26] body of Christ get your nourishment get
[1:17:28] your uh get all your needs met through
[1:17:31] Christ and the body and increase with
[1:17:34] the word of God all the time don't let
[1:17:36] anything take the place of God's word in
[1:17:37] your life praise God
[1:17:39] anything take away from your time to
[1:17:42] feed on God's word
[1:17:47] so he said don't let people pull you
[1:17:49] away from the word
[1:17:51] and subject to their
[1:17:52] uh their legalism
[1:17:55] see and then he gives examples like
[1:17:57] don't touch this don't taste that don't
[1:17:59] handle that
[1:18:00] see I remember all the old clean laws
[1:18:02] the clean and unclean laws of Judaism
[1:18:04] don't eat don't eat pork now some people
[1:18:06] shouldn't eat it right your body reacts
[1:18:08] to it bad you know I just thought Alina
[1:18:11] yeah I wouldn't even if I ever reacted
[1:18:13] that way too
[1:18:14] but see some people make you know
[1:18:16] legalism out of certain things
[1:18:18] and so Paul says
[1:18:20] the reality is Christ Christ is the
[1:18:22] reality of Liberties in Christ but make
[1:18:24] Christ the head of all things you do
[1:18:27] verse 22 which are all which all are to
[1:18:30] perish with the using see all these
[1:18:32] natural things they're going to perish
[1:18:34] and they're after the Commandments of
[1:18:36] doctrine of men all these Traditions
[1:18:38] come from Men
[1:18:40] right they come but we have to have
[1:18:41] Traditions that come from the word of
[1:18:43] God from God's word
[1:18:46] Hallelujah
[1:18:48] and this is what Paul warned them about
[1:18:49] not the earthquake in 10 years so see
[1:18:52] George even like even at the raptures in
[1:18:53] 10 years right
[1:18:54] or even if the tribulations in 10 years
[1:18:57] Paul would say keep your lives clean now
[1:19:01] hold on to Christ he's the head now amen
[1:19:05] don't worry about oh the economy is
[1:19:07] going to fall Paul didn't Paul didn't
[1:19:09] warn them that the economy was going to
[1:19:11] crash literally in 10 years
[1:19:13] he said take care of your spiritual
[1:19:15] condition amen worry about being in love
[1:19:18] with Christ worry about being in Christ
[1:19:20] be complete in him find hidden treasures
[1:19:22] in Christ Hallelujah
[1:19:25] economy is going to go up and down right
[1:19:26] things are going to rise and fall
[1:19:28] destruction is going to come natural
[1:19:29] things all these natural disasters he
[1:19:31] says save yourself from spiritual
[1:19:32] disasters
[1:19:35] now here we are a year from this Russian
[1:19:37] war look everybody's going to say about
[1:19:38] the bombs and everything here we are a
[1:19:39] year later
[1:19:41] now what if we took that whole year
[1:19:42] worried about Russia
[1:19:44] we would have been living in fear
[1:19:46] that's another good example whether they
[1:19:47] bomb us or not let's serve Jesus Christ
[1:19:53] yeah I just thought about that I just
[1:19:54] thought about that now yeah
[1:19:55] so in other words Satan will make
[1:19:56] anything I'll make any do anything to
[1:19:59] get your eyes off of Christ the word
[1:20:01] but Paul says increase in God
[1:20:04] find your Treasures in Christ the word
[1:20:09] don't follow Commandments and doctrines
[1:20:11] of men
[1:20:13] which things indeed have a show of
[1:20:15] wisdom in will worship now this is the
[1:20:18] bad will worship remember the will of
[1:20:20] God is remember the will of man is in
[1:20:21] the soul
[1:20:22] will worship is like Cain he worships
[1:20:24] according to his own will but Abel had
[1:20:26] God's worship praise God
[1:20:28] not self-will but God's will
[1:20:33] see all these all these legalistic
[1:20:35] things all these philosophies they have
[1:20:38] a form of worship they seem humble and
[1:20:42] and some of them do cause you to neglect
[1:20:44] the body
[1:20:45] see
[1:20:46] like fasting like over fasting right or
[1:20:49] doing certain things
[1:20:51] but it's not in any honor to the
[1:20:54] satisfying of the flesh
[1:20:56] is that the end of chapter two yes
[1:21:00] so by God's grace uh chapter 3 we'll
[1:21:02] look at Lord willing later on by the
[1:21:04] grace of God
[1:21:07] so I want to stop right there musicians
[1:21:08] can come by God's grace
[1:21:12] and then tonight Lord when I want to
[1:21:14] preach on a disciple whom Jesus loved
[1:21:16] part three part two is the one where I
[1:21:18] had where Austin had a great testimony
[1:21:19] there
[1:21:20] so I want to look at part three here
[1:21:21] tonight by God's grace let's stand to
[1:21:23] our feet
[1:21:25] hope you enjoyed chapter two of
[1:21:26] Colossians praise God hallelujah
[1:21:28] church is so applicable like I gave with
[1:21:30] some of those examples
[1:21:32] so applicable people can hang around the
[1:21:34] message
[1:21:35] people can even preach in the message
[1:21:38] but if Christ isn't their absolute
[1:21:41] if they don't go back to Christ for
[1:21:43] every answer every question people can
[1:21:45] be deceived
[1:21:47] that's just what Satan wants to beguile
[1:21:49] people
[1:21:51] to get their minds off of Christ and get
[1:21:53] it on something else we've got to keep
[1:21:55] our minds completely on Christ this year
[1:21:59] this year
[1:22:01] praise God let's bow our heads here for
[1:22:02] a word of Prayer
[1:22:08] Hallelujah father God we thank you for
[1:22:11] today Lord God
[1:22:13] we want to thank you for your word Lord
[1:22:14] God
[1:22:16] as we said Lord
[1:22:19] Colossus economy was going to collapse
[1:22:22] in 10 years literally through an
[1:22:24] earthquake but Lord your spirit never
[1:22:26] told the people to Beware of the
[1:22:27] earthquake
[1:22:29] your spirit said Beware of vain words
[1:22:33] doctrines of men
[1:22:36] philosophies of men
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:42] who told them they were complete in
[1:22:44] Christ and to increase in more of the
[1:22:47] word of God
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:50] or we don't know if there's a atomic
[1:22:52] missile coming this year or not
[1:22:54] we don't know
[1:22:56] we don't know if the economy is going to
[1:22:58] collapse
[1:22:59] know
[1:23:01] one thing we do know
[1:23:03] is that we are complete in Jesus Christ
[1:23:06] and Lord we want our hearts knit
[1:23:09] together in love
[1:23:12] Hallelujah
[1:23:17] the Lord as I said Lord through that
[1:23:20] verse 3.
[1:23:22] may we find all of our Treasures in
[1:23:25] Christ
[1:23:31] Lord just we pray I pray Lord God
