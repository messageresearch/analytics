[8:21] lately studies with young children
[8:25] I don't only gulfside biostudies to
[8:28] thank the desolate mother been
[8:30] appreciate it customized it I want to
[8:34] look a little more at sanctification
[8:38] so the scriptures here tonight we've
[8:45] been looking at the statue of urban man
[8:48] so look at a different few thoughts on
[8:51] the sanctification want to remind
[8:54] everybody that sanctification is
[8:56] purification of your heart and life
[8:59] expectations of your heart and life do
[9:02] girls want to be pure every day and now
[9:04] that you pure every day you come up
[9:06] front that I'm not going to do
[9:08] it's pictures on the street so
[9:17] purification of heart and life so let's
[9:22] look at a few scriptures we saw break
[9:24] the will of God to be sanctified 1st
[9:26] Thessalonians 4 so let's start with
[9:28] there let's review that process in
[9:30] chapter 4 it's God's perfect will I
[9:34] think we all want to be in God's perfect
[9:36] will don't be vs. Tony's 4 verse 3 verse
[9:49] 3 but before that we'll have another
[9:50] word of Prayer just over the power start
[9:53] the only father nor me thank you getting
[9:56] through this time Lord God I want to
[9:57] read your word he wanted to learn from
[9:59] thy word dear God and we want to grow in
[10:02] grace and knowledge of the lord thank
[10:04] you for these young Souls dear God or
[10:07] with numerous them being baptized last
[10:10] few months Lord God that's near dear God
[10:14] I just feel burning more doctors look at
[10:17] the Scriptures teach them these gospel
[10:19] truths nor death they're so dear to our
[10:22] hearts cool pretty blessed our time here
[10:25] Lord had and faithful at virtue and
[10:28] knowledge at each and every virtue you
[10:30] are God each and every characteristics
[10:32] in the lives of each other for your
[10:34] glory Jesus Christ every set 1st
[10:40] Thessalonians 4 verse Lori two and three
[10:44] [Music]
[10:50] that Malachi can read verses two and
[10:53] three verses 4 to 3 so it's God's will
[11:12] for you and I to be sanctified let's be
[11:15] purified of stealing hearts and lives I
[11:19] want to show that it comes by the word
[11:21] of
[11:21] so let's go to John chapter 13 so we all
[11:27] want to be sanctified right they want to
[11:29] be justified sanctified and filled the
[11:31] spirit but there's one way the
[11:35] sanctification comes and that's through
[11:37] the Word of God John 13 this is a story
[11:43] of Jesus having his light laughter
[11:47] washing the psychos feet Lydia you would
[11:57] like you to read a few verses for me
[12:03] read verses to fix for that their minds
[12:55] Jesus gets up and puts the towel on and
[12:58] he goes over to watch the feet and Peter
[13:00] said are you going to wash my feet the
[13:03] Peter on Jesus to wash you see he did
[13:07] once you just wash his feet because
[13:09] Peter felt so little we all feel right
[13:13] but then look at verse 7 Jesus answering
[13:16] said to him what I do that I know is not
[13:18] now but I'll shout no Hereafter
[13:30] [Music]
[13:43] so is sanctification a pretty important
[13:46] step for a believer you have to be
[13:49] washed and clean in your daily life it's
[13:51] extremely important if you don't get
[13:53] watched by Jesus
[13:54] we have no part with it but we want to
[13:56] part with Jesus so we've got to let him
[13:58] wash this and Jesus we know is the Word
[14:02] of God
[14:03] look at Simon Peters response once he
[14:07] hears that once he hears that if he
[14:09] doesn't get washed that's not a part of
[14:12] Jesus occasion II read verse 9 see what
[14:15] he says what you say what's he knew that
[14:35] in order to be a part in Jesus got to be
[14:38] washed where these pretty say yeah do
[14:41] all me wash all of me make sure every
[14:44] part of me is clean because I want to
[14:45] party Jesus that's why we pray everyday
[14:48] right read our Bibles with our family
[14:50] and try to learn the Word of God because
[14:53] we want Jesus with washing every part of
[14:55] us right
[14:56] then jesus said in verse 10 he that is
[14:59] washed needeth not safe to wash his feet
[15:01] but is clean every whit and ye are clean
[15:04] but not all for he knew he should betray
[15:08] him therefore he said we are not all
[15:10] clean so Judas was gonna betray Jesus
[15:13] for what what did Judas get returns me
[15:16] but not money so if somebody loves money
[15:19] too much but then approve they need to
[15:23] be cleaned out don't get they love money
[15:25] too much more than Jesus so Jesus said
[15:27] he's not clean because he still loves
[15:30] money so much he's got to get rid of his
[15:31] love for but you didn't so I want to
[15:35] start with that scripture show how we're
[15:37] sanctified through the word were
[15:38] purified through God's Word
[15:40] so if you think we should read our Bible
[15:42] everyday then just once a day or twice a
[15:46] day or a couple of times what do you
[15:48] think Compton should read our Bible ten
[15:51] times that'd be awesome as often as
[15:55] possible as often as possible and if you
[15:57] can't read your Bible then it's good to
[15:59] see right create the right atmosphere
[16:00] sing songs and to God not cursing and
[16:02] last thing the drive home but we at our
[16:07] house we like to start in the morning
[16:08] with the scripture and ended the day
[16:10] with Scripture as well then sing
[16:12] throughout the day listen to sermons
[16:14] okay I can play different pictures do I
[16:17] like to listen to them
[16:18] I wash dishes or work in the kitchen or
[16:20] something like that so the more we have
[16:23] of Jesus the more sanctify we can be I
[16:26] want to make sure I show everybody that
[16:28] that it's the word that washes us it's
[16:31] the word that sanctifies us so we've got
[16:32] to have a lot of time in the Bible don't
[16:35] be read the Word of God
[16:38] okay so the next one let's go to John 17
[16:41] verse 14 already in John 13 so let's
[16:45] turn a few pages 17 14 so these
[16:59] scriptures Jesus is talking about the
[17:01] difference between the world so people
[17:04] that don't believe and the word I want
[17:09] you to see what he says here here's
[17:12] what's gonna happen if we get some
[17:13] priority cleaned out for God you're
[17:15] gonna happen so now you're even 14 so
[17:40] once we receive God's Word the world
[17:43] doesn't like us anymore let's turn
[17:46] around parents feed you raise your hand
[17:48] if you've lost friends because you've
[17:49] been a Christian and doing lost friends
[17:51] look at the hands my hands up to
[17:54] yeah when you start really getting
[17:56] washed and sanctified God's Word if you
[17:59] had worldly friends before some maybe
[18:01] not maybe simply wouldn't have to be
[18:03] friends but if you had worldly friends
[18:05] and you start getting washing God's Word
[18:07] they're not gonna like you very much
[18:09] longer why is that to them yeah yeah
[18:17] they don't like the words cooper signs
[18:18] laws yeah great job David yeah you know
[18:22] that they don't like the word right and
[18:23] how can two walk together except they be
[18:27] yeah we don't agree anymore like my
[18:30] friends we didn't agree with kind of
[18:31] music anymore so so much time with them
[18:35] because we didn't agree on they want to
[18:36] go to movies and I don't want to go to
[18:38] movies anymore I want to be sanctified
[18:39] right cleaned up forgot its purpose so
[18:42] they start not liking you really and
[18:44] Jesus even use the word hate and that's
[18:45] a really strong word but when it comes
[18:47] down to they really don't like the Word
[18:49] of God
[18:50] so Lydia you do 16 and 7 so let's say
[19:06] sanctified by the word ready sanctified
[19:10] by the word got a Bible hold up your
[19:12] Bible like this and say sanctified by
[19:14] the word ready sanctified by the word
[19:17] very good thank you said that so if
[19:20] we're justified we're baptized oh we're
[19:22] forgiven of our sins right to be
[19:24] sanctified we got to have a lot of
[19:26] teaching more of God you gotta really
[19:28] read the Bible understand or hear the
[19:30] Bible preach to us it's really important
[19:33] that's how we get sanctified Jesus says
[19:35] through the Word of God all right now
[19:40] I'm going to look at the next one let's
[19:42] go to another scripture let's go to acts
[19:46] 26 15 please X 26 15
[19:54] 26:15 this is about Jesus telling Paul
[20:01] they'd be sanctified by faith in Christ
[20:05] so acts 26 15 15 through 18 I'll start
[20:33] off with this one here and I said who
[20:36] art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus
[20:38] whom thou persecute us but rise and
[20:41] stand upon thy feet for I have appeared
[20:42] unto thee for this purpose to make the a
[20:45] minister to witness both of these things
[20:47] which now I see none of those things in
[20:50] which I will appear unto be delivering
[20:53] thee from the people and from the
[20:55] Gentiles of the good now I send thee
[20:58] verse 18 is going to look at to open
[21:01] their eyes and to turn them from
[21:03] darkness to light and from the power of
[21:07] Satan unto God that they may receive
[21:10] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[21:13] among them which are sanctified by faith
[21:17] in me okay so that's what Jesus came to
[21:21] do he take you became and take you from
[21:23] the power of darkness and bring it to
[21:26] the power of light
[21:26] who knows what what was populate for the
[21:30] power of darkness before Jesus catered
[21:33] food he was he was hunting now
[21:38] Christians and saying you're going to
[21:39] jail no your hands the gummy handcuffs
[21:41] on you would put handcuffs jingle jingle
[21:45] jinkies that you're coming with me
[21:46] you're coming with me to jail that's
[21:49] what he did he was working for the power
[21:50] of the darkness right but then when
[21:52] Jesus came to him now he's gonna work
[21:54] for the kingdom of light right with the
[21:56] power of light and this was done he said
[22:00] he said by sanctified by faith that is
[22:04] from Chi
[22:05] you have that faith in the word that's
[22:08] creeps you have to believe with the
[22:10] preachers saying you have to believe
[22:11] what the Bible saying and you really
[22:13] gotta believe what your mom and dad say
[22:14] right really got to believe mom and dad
[22:17] if they're teaching the word every
[22:19] single day aren't they
[22:20] we come to church two days a week but
[22:22] your mom and dad they're with you every
[22:24] single day so that's one way to be
[22:27] sanctified by faith that's by obeying
[22:30] your parents so much every single day
[22:32] all right so I just want to show that
[22:34] we're sanctified by the word and then
[22:37] we're safe for safety 5 by the faith
[22:40] that's a Jesus that same thing gotta
[22:43] believe that works right it means
[22:45] something to us so you think we can all
[22:48] pay attention really well but we read I
[22:50] went home sobbing and then try to apply
[22:53] that to our lives with our brothers and
[22:55] sisters brothers and sisters yeah we
[22:59] can't we can't forget what I'm a dad
[23:01] read to us from the Bible we got to
[23:03] remember that we got to take that with
[23:05] us the rest of the day going all right
[23:08] raise the Lord let's take another one
[23:10] here let's go to 2nd Timothy 2:19 2nd
[23:16] Timothy 2:19 you actually read this
[23:35] scripture this morning service will read
[23:39] 20 and 21 22 I just saw that it's a very
[23:44] important scripture for sanctification
[23:54] [Music]
[24:06] [Music]
[24:14] do all the children want God to use
[24:22] [Music]
[24:26] thinking about how God might use our
[24:29] later on a right maybe with a mother
[24:31] doctor a nurse I may use her different
[24:34] ways of course worker you wouldn't be a
[24:36] horse person I know there's a fancy
[24:42] birthday equestrian you want to be a you
[24:49] want to be a chef that you need what's
[24:51] it gonna be a cooker girl can you be a
[24:53] cooker girl for Jesus absolutely
[24:56] what if there's so many at that
[24:57] restaurant that doesn't know Jesus could
[24:59] you shine the light of Jesus to them
[25:00] okay what do you want to be when you
[25:02] grew up
[25:04] dermatologist remind me what is that a
[25:06] good good money but you think there's
[25:15] people its science centers either speed
[25:19] what zoos that need to know about Christ
[25:22] absolutely there's always someone
[25:26] wherever got wherever God's given you
[25:28] desire to go and whatever work he's
[25:29] called you do there's only somebody that
[25:31] needs to hear about Christ there and if
[25:33] you don't go they won't hear so guess
[25:35] who's God God's gonna said he's gonna
[25:37] send you he's gonna use you because you
[25:40] give me a vessel but just you have to be
[25:41] sanctified to be able to be used by God
[25:44] to be sanctified so let's read that

[25:52] that are you

[27:34] a vessel unto honor sanctified and meat
[27:38] for the Masters use prepared for every
[27:42] good work Wow
[27:44] so we must be sanctified in order for
[27:47] God to use us then you're prepared and
[27:50] ready to do some good work for the Lord
[27:53] everybody if you want God to use you got
[27:57] to be sanctified you got to be ready and
[27:58] cleaned out so he can use you alright
[28:01] breathe verse twenty-two Sara can you
[28:03] read verse twenty-two thank you
[28:31] appreciate that so you're supposed to
[28:35] run from youthful lusts
[28:38] and anybody think of youthful lusts
[28:40] things you might really want one year
[28:42] younger maybe not so much for your
[28:45] orders I know when when I was four
[28:47] younger I wanted a brand-new car
[28:49] I kind of got our family in debt at the
[28:52] beginning is that one of the brand new
[28:54] cars so bad but then we got burned out
[28:55] of definite that was one thing I just
[28:57] always wanted and I look back now I
[28:59] thought that was a really immature thing
[29:02] to do just wanting a new car why did it
[29:04] what would a new car feel like and sorry
[29:07] I should not have done that I kind of
[29:09] got that a mistake that I made
[29:11] but that's something I wanted as a youth
[29:13] I was a little older of course but at
[29:15] your age what might be a youthful lust
[29:18] that you might have to battle you may
[29:20] think I'm Duncan candy you definitely
[29:22] candy tester movies yeah definitely yes
[29:29] yeah could be friendships right one of
[29:33] you friends with other people could be
[29:34] fancy clothes right toy he's definitely
[29:38] had toys can't heat up those things
[29:40] those might be youthful things and then
[29:43] like we said and he eat any hard
[29:45] feelings like if you're really upset
[29:47] with somebody that could be something
[29:48] you battle as a young child as well but
[29:51] the Bible gave us the word flee what is
[29:54] flee me run run away from it should we
[29:58] run from all candy you think yes you
[30:02] think so
[30:04] yeah well we should try to avoid it
[30:07] right we don't have to exactly run from
[30:08] it but if we're having a hard time
[30:10] saying no to candy or maybe if we're
[30:13] stealing things then should we probably
[30:15] walk away from it really fast we
[30:17] wouldn't have to run would you want to
[30:19] walk away from it yeah we'd want to walk
[30:24] away you want to flee any youthful lusts
[30:27] so all those other examples are right to
[30:29] just trying to stay away from them as
[30:31] much as possible okay right here okay
[30:43] and then you're supposed to follow those
[30:46] who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
[30:49] so
[30:50] rub your chin who do you know in your
[30:55] life that follows God with a pure heart
[30:58] read you're an if you want to share
[31:00] s-sir who follows God your Nana very
[31:08] good let's give ourselves good answer
[31:10] yeah you want to live like Nana right
[31:13] you want to watch how does she live her
[31:15] life and you want to follow her you
[31:18] don't want to follow people that maybe
[31:20] say bad words right or that steal things
[31:26] or have each much candy you don't want
[31:29] to follow them right you want to follow
[31:32] the people of a pure heart
[31:35] RINO that's a pure heart be defiled
[31:41] who else those with another good example
[31:43] maybe I think I'm thinking of a teenage
[31:47] example you might know or a young adult
[31:51] example you might know they do from
[31:53] another church and human yeah Benjamin
[32:00] browning up from Sheffield I think he's
[32:03] a great example someone who calls on God
[32:05] out of a pure heart
[32:07] Lydia what do you think Marissa yeah
[32:11] Merson knew her she also goes to show
[32:13] through there
[32:15] so we should follow people that have a
[32:18] pure heart that's part of being
[32:19] sanctified you have to surround
[32:21] yourselves with the right people right
[32:24] and then you were more sanctified
[32:26] because you're gonna follow what they do
[32:28] so it's very important to remember that
[32:30] I want you to see that that's right in
[32:33] the scripture Bible says follow
[32:34] righteousness faith charity peace and
[32:37] then they call on God with a pure heart
[32:40] okay okay next one let me go next
[32:45] scripture here let's go to Romans 15:16
[32:53] I want to share this Scripture Romans
[32:56] acts in Romans
[33:00] x12 is right okay okay go to chapter 5
[33:04] chapter 15 16 I'm sorry
[33:08] Romans 1560 bringing this scripture so
[33:16] you can see that the spirit that's
[33:20] leading you to be sanctified is always
[33:22] going to be the holy spirit always going
[33:25] to be the Holy Ghost guiding you
[33:29] sanctifying you eventually he's going to
[33:32] fill you if you believe and obey all the
[33:35] commands of God he's gonna fill you but
[33:38] it's not a different sphere than the
[33:39] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and
[33:41] justification sanctification and when he
[33:46] comes inside we read that think about
[33:50] what kind of feelings did you have when
[33:52] you decide to be baptized think about
[33:54] that think about what kind of feelings
[33:56] was the Holy Ghost giving you to be to
[34:00] encourage you to be baptized what did
[34:02] that feel like
[34:02] you could start with Esther the first
[34:04] one with an investor what kind of
[34:06] feelings were you having about wanting
[34:09] to be baptized love that's perfect
[34:13] beautiful love for God right love for
[34:16] Jesus so the Holy Ghost moved on
[34:19] Esther's heart want to be baptized and
[34:21] there's a feeling of love about Malachi
[34:23] and lydian Acacia they've been baptized
[34:25] what feelings did the Holy Ghost move
[34:30] upon your heart when you were to be
[34:32] baptized Acacia we felt very happy
[34:36] liddie people did yeah like this is
[34:42] the right way this is the right thing to
[34:43] do right you should do this need obey
[34:46] the word God yeah I remember that day
[34:47] yeah okay what did you feel excited
[34:51] praise the Lord
[34:52] I remember that even what did you feel
[34:55] what the Holy Ghost put on your heart
[35:02] very happy I remember that remember when
[35:06] you woke up you want to draw my iPad and
[35:08] I said okay and guess what she drew a
[35:10] picture up Rory's got baptized
[35:12] did you picture me baptizing her iPad
[35:15] and she didn't have to she'd not do that
[35:18] but it was on her mind and her heart so
[35:20] much that she drew a picture I thought
[35:22] she didn't draw like hearts or horses or
[35:24] something like that
[35:25] but that was on her heart so the Holy
[35:28] Spirit will put those thoughts on our
[35:30] heart it's the Holy Spirit a
[35:32] justification sanctification and the
[35:35] battle goes so Romans 15:16
[35:40] Malachi can you read that for us thank
[35:57] you
[35:58] praise the Lord so that's what the
[36:00] scripture says
[36:02] we'd be except might be accessible being
[36:05] sanctified by the Holy Ghost so in other
[36:08] words the same voice that you're hearing
[36:10] now that might be saying this the same
[36:19] voice that saying that treat your sister
[36:21] the right way forgive your sister the
[36:25] same voice is that saying that is
[36:26] eventually gonna lead you and tell you
[36:28] the voice I'm gonna fill you with the
[36:30] Holy Spirit that's the voice that said
[36:32] love God right love Jesus be baptized
[36:36] it's gonna be the same spirit you just
[36:38] can be given you a new direction to go
[36:40] from being baptized now to be sanctified
[36:43] and then to be filled with the Holy
[36:45] Spirit is anybody ever near those voices
[36:48] I call you need to be filled you need to
[36:50] be sanctified as any of the children
[36:51] ever hear those voices you need to obey
[36:53] that wonderful to see this meant
[37:01] remember it's the same voice not a
[37:02] different voice the same voice or same
[37:04] conviction like Lydia said are the same
[37:05] love the same love that said you need to
[37:08] be baptized we become a Christian it's
[37:12] gonna be the same love that says you
[37:14] need to clean out your daily life habits
[37:16] and thoughts and whatever that entails
[37:18] right everything else all right I love
[37:21] that fantastic praise the Lord
[37:25] okay and here's where I think this is
[37:30] one of the most important scriptures on
[37:31] sanitation acts 5:32 let's go there acts
[37:35] 5:32 good acts that Romans good you got
[37:42] X 532 this is why obedience and
[37:47] sanctification this is why I got obey
[37:49] God every day you want the Holy Ghost
[37:50] good all we make mistakes every day but
[37:53] we can quickly repent and get right with
[37:55] God if you love the Holy Ghost
[38:10] 5:32
[38:14] [Music]
[38:19] thank you God gives the Holy Ghost to
[38:23] them that do what what's that oh word
[38:25] obey let's say it again ready oh man say
[38:28] little louder
[38:29] oh hey hey God gives the Holy Ghost to
[38:32] them that obey Him and safe occasionally
[38:36] comes through the the Bible the word
[38:40] right so we have to obey the Bible it's
[38:44] gonna be that same voice the whole time
[38:47] saying obey this part submit to that
[38:50] believe that it's God's it's God's Way
[38:53] and then when you both show God you
[38:55] won't obey Him or sanctification then
[38:57] he'll give you the Holy Ghost which is
[39:00] Christ's life in you praising Allah and
[39:02] its power to be a witness it's power to
[39:05] be to have the testimony right that's
[39:08] what Jesus said it's the Holy Ghost in
[39:09] power so it's power to live a more
[39:12] dedicated life unto God
[39:14] alright next one let's go to Luke 24:49
[39:22] and let's read that I want to show you
[39:23] an example with the disciples and
[39:25] sanctification Luke 24:49
[39:36] 24:49 yeah everybody hate Minh real
[39:46] quick Haven doesn't know how to read yet
[39:47] but she's been taking pretty good notes
[39:49] I thought people might like to see that
[39:50] on the scheduled program and there I was
[39:52] so thankful to see that she's trying to
[39:54] take notes I'm trying to learn pay
[39:56] attention just as a dad's heart real
[39:59] good Luke 24:49 so let's look at a good
[40:04] example of the disciples having to obey
[40:07] before they get the Holy Ghost we went
[40:09] through a lot last week overlap
[40:18] you
[40:23] all right try this one okay 24 Thank You
[40:58] occasion great read
[40:59] okay so Jesus said I'm going to send the
[41:02] promise of the Holy Ghost but he said
[41:05] you have to wait in Jerusalem until
[41:07] you're clothed with power from on high
[41:13] so Jerusalem so Malachi would Bethlehem
[41:16] worked they waited in Bethlehem without
[41:18] it worked
[41:18] no how about if they went to you know
[41:24] Gaul Lydia would that it worked no hmm
[41:27] how about Jericho Sarah would that have
[41:29] worked if they went to Jericho no they
[41:32] had to obey
[41:33] so in mom her dad tells you to do
[41:36] something you want to do exactly what
[41:38] they say you have to do exactly what
[41:40] they say that's part of being sanctified
[41:43] keeping all the Word of God now you know
[41:47] the story but let's go to Acts chapter 2
[41:49] chapter 2 first one I'm sorry let's go
[41:58] to Acts chapter 1 verse 2 I'm sorry one
[42:10] remember they wanted the Holy Spirit
[42:12] they had to obey Jesus commands good
[42:19] thanks for help
[42:22] Acts chapter one will read verses two
[42:26] three four
[42:33] Liddy's one read verses 2 and 3 will
[42:37] have Sarah read verse 4 that city
[42:39] chapter one verse they saw Jesus forty
[43:06] days ok ok so what she did they go to
[43:29] Jerusalem they had to Jesus said you got
[43:31] to go to Jerusalem and then he said go
[43:33] there do what W go there and wait just
[43:38] go their way hurry up and get there and
[43:41] wait right there like we're in the car I
[43:45] heard somewhere that we have to wait to
[43:47] do what you wait to get food or wait to
[43:49] do whatever we need to do he said get to
[43:51] where you need to go and then wait and
[43:54] then we don't act chapter 2 that's where
[43:56] the Holy Spirit fell we remembers how
[43:58] many days they waited together you guys
[44:00] been there 10 days give Lydia some pause
[44:04] very chocolatey yeah wonderful ten days
[44:07] and we have we're spent ten days with
[44:10] our church together and they's in a row
[44:12] know about our family but picture
[44:18] picture being with a lot of families
[44:20] where
[44:21] 120 people for 10 days they're probably
[44:24] in and out maybe buying food maybe that
[44:26] some of the guys that were going to be
[44:28] deacons Navy later ended up decongestant
[44:31] maybe they're guys that acted as deacons
[44:32] 10 days they were together just waiting
[44:35] just waiting look at your watch pretend
[44:38] looking at your clock they're just
[44:40] waiting they kept looking well Jesus
[44:42] said just late Jesus said just waiting
[44:44] right so when you're seeking God and
[44:48] you've obeyed all God's commandments and
[44:50] maybe you don't feel like God has filled
[44:53] you right away what should you do you
[44:55] should keep waiting right even you keep
[44:58] waiting right if you've got everything
[45:00] you know how to do and you've kept all
[45:02] the commandments of God and you still
[45:05] haven't seen the promise of God come to
[45:06] pass we must wait who's the father of
[45:09] our faith that waited 25 years hey
[45:13] aren't you glad he didn't give up he
[45:16] waited 25 years and then got on this
[45:20] enterprise they only have to wait 10
[45:22] days which is easier to wait 25 years or
[45:25] 10 days just 10 days but God kept his
[45:30] promise well God always keep his promise
[45:31] you always keep his promise so never
[45:34] forget his promise now I want to go a
[45:38] few more let's look at a few more
[45:40] examples of people that were sanctified
[45:43] but still not filled with the spirit and
[45:46] I got about 10 minutes okay good
[45:48] don't you see these sort of Acts chapter
[45:51] 8 verse 12 Acts chapter 8 verse 12 this
[45:57] is in Samaria Acts chapter 8 verse 12
[46:06] acts 8 to 12 now if you know the story
[46:12] Philip went to Samaria he cast out
[46:14] demons he did miracles He healed the
[46:17] sick and a lot of people got saved a lot
[46:19] of people started believing in Jesus
[46:20] let's look at verse 12 let's see what
[46:22] happened but when they believed Philip
[46:25] preaching the things concerning the
[46:27] kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[46:30] Christ they were baptized both men
[46:34] and women go down to verse 17 then Simon
[46:38] himself believed awesome and when he was
[46:40] baptized he continued with Philip and
[46:42] wondered beholding the miracles and
[46:45] signs which were done I want you two to
[46:48] stop a moment there Simon was a sorcerer
[46:51] which means he was working with demons
[46:54] and witchcraft and all kinds of things
[46:56] that we want to say we want to flee from
[46:58] that right we really want to run away
[47:00] from that that's definitely something we
[47:02] never want to run away from what he
[47:06] started believing and he got baptized
[47:07] but we're gonna see he wasn't saying
[47:10] defined yet because he had some pretty
[47:12] pretty offensive ideas still about God
[47:15] he thought you could by God's blessings
[47:17] with money can you buy God's blessings
[47:19] with money no no you can't buy
[47:22] especially the Holy Spirit God's own
[47:24] spirit you can't buy God's blessings
[47:26] with money and he still had that idea
[47:29] that shows his thoughts were really
[47:31] sanctified yet worthy but was he
[47:33] baptized yeah he's had a good thing
[47:35] that's a glorious thing that's a
[47:38] beautiful thing is to be baptized let's
[47:41] keep reading and see what happens verse
[47:43] 14 now one of the Apostles which were in
[47:47] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[47:48] received the Word of God they sent unto
[47:50] them Peter and John that's that Mallory
[47:54] who when they were come down prayed for
[47:57] them that they might receive the Holy
[48:00] Ghost so these people had all been
[48:02] baptized like some of us up here and all
[48:04] of us in the back area all the adults
[48:06] been baptized right I've been baptized
[48:09] but in this case they were all baptized
[48:13] but they were gonna still get in prayer
[48:15] that they might receive the Holy Ghost
[48:17] because the Holy Ghost hadn't fallen yet
[48:19] because they weren't fully sanctified
[48:21] yet verse 16 thanks buddy 860 all right
[48:36] thank you hope everybody can see that
[48:40] people these wonderful people were
[48:42] baptized but the Holy Ghost had it
[48:44] fallen on them they had
[48:46] God's power fall on them and that's what
[48:50] they needed
[48:50] all right let's read verse 17 occasions
[48:53] when tried verse 17 then laid they all
[49:04] right then people started receiving the
[49:07] Holy Ghost people feel really bold when
[49:11] they receive the Holy Ghost you lads in
[49:13] the Bible they feel really bold learn
[49:15] what might we be bold about what might
[49:17] be bold about when you're playing
[49:18] outside not wearing a helmet when you
[49:24] ride a bike you might be bold about that
[49:25] I don't need to wear a helmet right I'd
[49:27] say that yeah some people might be like
[49:30] that right I don't have to wear a helmet
[49:32] we might be bold when we play what kind
[49:35] of games outside i dizzy
[49:39] yeah you might be very bold with high
[49:41] didn't seek tag yeah it might be bold do
[49:45] you go up and tap somebody like this
[49:48] then how you tag somebody when you play
[49:50] hide-and-seek
[49:50] no you're bold you're like come here I'm
[49:53] gonna chase you down to get you right
[49:54] you're bold
[49:56] aren't you like to play narnia what your
[49:58] kind battle scene like that good
[50:00] conquers Overeem us are you really timid
[50:03] what you do narnia battles are you
[50:05] really bold
[50:06] you're bold I know because we're doing
[50:08] sword fight sometimes are we sorry fight
[50:10] you're bold with it right you're Bowl
[50:13] that means you got a lot of emotion
[50:16] right a lot of a lot of direction you
[50:19] know what you want to do well when the
[50:21] Holy Ghost fell they were both for Jesus
[50:24] that's what we all need don't we both
[50:27] for Jesus and that's what they got when
[50:30] the Holy Ghost fell they received the
[50:32] Holy Ghost now let's look you back
[50:33] inside remember Simon the guy in sorcery
[50:35] he was baptized remember that that was
[50:38] good but let's look at verse 18 was the
[50:43] first eighteen now let's try to read
[50:46] down let anyone read eighteen oh you
[50:47] don't have and when Simon saw that
[50:51] through the laying on of the Apostles
[50:53] hands the Holy Ghost was given he
[50:55] offered them money saying give me also
[50:59] this power
[50:59] that on whom summer I lay my hands he
[51:01] may receive the Holy Ghost that's kind
[51:05] of that's in one way that's a good
[51:06] desire right he wants to see people
[51:08] filled with God but can you ever buy
[51:11] anything with money for God no we can't
[51:15] can't do that and this is actually a
[51:18] pretty serious thing because Peter
[51:20] rebukes them pretty hard it's a good
[51:25] verse 20 but Peter said to him thy money
[51:28] perish with thee so Peters been saying
[51:32] you're gonna perish with your money if
[51:33] you don't change your mind because that
[51:36] thou has thought that the gift of God
[51:38] may be purchased with money so see we
[51:41] can't think that if I pay more money
[51:43] maybe maybe more maybe God will like me
[51:46] more maybe maybe maybe I'll get to
[51:49] preach some day or maybe I'll get to do
[51:51] music some day or something like that
[51:53] maybe I'll I'll get what I've always
[51:55] wanted from God I just get more money is
[51:57] that the right thought no that's not it
[52:00] that's not a very saint if I thought
[52:01] that's not a very pure thought and this
[52:04] is the problem Simon Peter Simon was
[52:06] having us I'm Peter sign in the sorcerer
[52:07] he thought I could buy it with money and
[52:11] he found out he couldn't let's keep
[52:14] going there verse 21 now has neither
[52:17] part nor lot in this matter for thy
[52:20] heart is not right in the sight of God
[52:23] so he wasn't really sanctified he's not
[52:26] ready for God to use it busy his heart's
[52:29] not right thinks off I just pay little
[52:31] more money God will answer my prayer I
[52:33] can I could be like those guys if I just
[52:35] pay a little more money no you can't we
[52:37] can only be who who can we only be who
[52:40] God made us to be right can I be
[52:42] Annamarie go no can I be dr. Scott no
[52:47] who can I be I just got to be brother
[52:50] Jesse that's all I gotta be I just got
[52:53] to be happy being mean but you thought I
[52:55] can pay money and I can be like Peter I
[52:57] can be like James and John if I just
[53:00] give them a little more money God said
[53:02] no these have to be given for me you
[53:05] can't buy that you gotta be sanctified
[53:07] alright look at verse 22 okay guys the
[53:10] first 20 - thanks buddy
[53:13] prepaid therefore this wickedness and
[53:17] pray God if perhaps keep going to verse
[53:23] 23 even gets more severe in other words
[53:31] urine changes we pretend you're entering
[53:33] chains again like a prisoner Peter tells
[53:36] him you're in the bond you're in the
[53:38] chains of iniquity
[53:39] yet he was baptized right so it's
[53:43] important to keep serving God after you
[53:45] get baptized
[53:46] oh yes cuz he's baptized but he's still
[53:49] in Chains right he's still in Chains
[53:51] he's got a bitterness of hearty sin and
[53:54] he still has a heart of iniquity
[53:55] sometimes he does evil when he should
[53:58] when he knows to do good
[54:00] that's iniquity what a amazing story
[54:04] isn't that and then let's we can talk
[54:08] about this but he said verse 22 repent
[54:10] and pray to God for giving so that's
[54:14] what we need to do next time we just so
[54:16] many mom or dad anybody just so big
[54:18] might be alteration but did anybody just
[54:20] so baby mom or dad this week think about
[54:21] you not reaching it did anybody mistreat
[54:24] a brother sister this week I know in our
[54:27] house it happened probably the house
[54:30] that's right because we all make
[54:31] mistakes but you know it you need to do
[54:34] you need to say God I'm sorry I'm
[54:38] repenting and like like the scripture
[54:41] said here please forgive me
[54:43] everybody do that from now on if you
[54:45] haven't done that yet say God please
[54:47] forgive me I'm sorry I want to repent I
[54:51] want to pure heart right now let's take
[54:53] divided heart alright let's do another
[54:56] story here and a couple more to go
[55:03] let's go to well I want to I got seven
[55:08] minutes let me go to a few scriptures
[55:10] about this might be good for Simon the
[55:15] sorcerer to yeah it's going to be Bruce
[55:18] 1029 this is a real another one a real
[55:21] serious scripture but we want I want you
[55:23] to know it want you to know it
[55:27] mainly to encourage you to keep moving
[55:30] on with God at all times Hebrews 10:29
[55:35] and this scripture so important because
[55:46] once we get baptized we have to move
[55:49] into sanctification and you ever stand
[55:52] still as a Christian or I can never
[55:55] stand still and do nothing and still be
[55:57] just as good as a Christian as you were
[55:59] no no you always have to press forward
[56:03] right to obey God's Word you can't stand
[56:06] still all right Hebrews chapter 10 in
[56:10] Hebrews okay you see there's chapter
[56:13] thirteen again two terms term a few more
[56:14] pages are you doing chapter 10 verse 29
[56:19] 29 yeah you could never say the same you
[56:24] can never stay to set you have to either
[56:26] a main effort to grow closer to God or
[56:29] you're gonna all the way from God you
[56:31] have to make efforts to be sanctified
[56:33] and more pure each and every day makes
[56:36] you look like yeah that would can you
[56:37] read a person
[57:06] [Music]
[57:43] - great reading thank you honey as the
[57:48] long scripture wasn't it long way well
[57:51] this one gives us a kind of a warning he
[57:54] makes some red lights go off saying
[57:55] warning warning warning God's giving us
[57:58] a big warning red letters red lights
[58:01] we'd say he says the person who gets
[58:05] sanctified by God but then turns away
[58:09] from God it's a sore punishment that
[58:14] means like a more severe punishment we
[58:17] want to be more severely punished no no
[58:20] we want to be rewarded like we said this
[58:21] morning right we want to please God just
[58:23] like you want to please your parents
[58:24] don't you but this is a war now I want
[58:27] you to just see this so that you know
[58:30] once you start drawing closer to God you
[58:33] can't stop you got to keep growing
[58:34] closer all the time how can you do that
[58:36] when you're 5 years old or 8 years old
[58:39] or 10 years old or 5 years old or 12
[58:44] almost 13 how can you keep drawing
[58:46] closer to God read in your Bible pray
[58:51] yeah what else yeah staying in love with
[58:58] somebody even if they're mean beautiful
[58:59] answer yeah
[59:01] spending time with God loving God
[59:05] absolutely all good answers thanked Aves
[59:09] absolutely listening to preaching glory
[59:13] how about if you see a job that needs
[59:16] done at the house what should you do
[59:18] yeah is that your target closer to God
[59:21] yeah let's say it's not even your job
[59:23] let's say it's Penelope's job let's say
[59:26] it's Havens job patient you could say
[59:29] well no it's a man's job I don't have to
[59:30] do it but if you do it what does that
[59:33] make you taking the initiative yeah yeah
[59:39] that makes a huge initiative and it
[59:41] makes you a servant it makes you sir you
[59:45] just served hey right because that was
[59:48] her job you sir
[59:49] her and Jesus said the greatest among
[59:51] you will be what the rulers are the
[59:52] servants those who serve others those
[59:58] are all great ideas right now that's how
[1:00:01] we want to keep being sanctified by a
[1:00:02] guide to warn you with the red flashing
[1:00:05] lights we gotta be sanctified but we
[1:00:08] gotta stay sanctified or else we get
[1:00:12] punished we don't want to be punished
[1:00:14] right you want to always keep our love
[1:00:16] for Jesus more than pure okay I'm
[1:00:18] already past five o'clock I will just do
[1:00:20] one more scripture here maybe too long
[1:00:25] maybe maybe these are really really
[1:00:30] short ones why I said that okay let's go
[1:00:31] to John 5:14 these are really short John
[1:00:33] 5:14 I think you'll like these idea of a
[1:01:00] warning each chapter 5:14 John 5:14 let
[1:01:16] me do this now when you get done pretty
[1:01:17] lady why don't you get John 8:11 stupid
[1:01:20] just be right there 5:14 this is again
[1:01:29] showing how we have to stay sanctified
[1:01:32] once you get 2nd sanctified you got to
[1:01:34] stay sanctified guys they cleaned up
[1:01:36] okay this was the man who couldn't walk
[1:01:55] and Jesus you know he said rise up take
[1:01:58] up your bed and walk and then Jesus
[1:02:01] finds him in the temple and he's
[1:02:03] behold the how our made whole but sin no
[1:02:05] more lest a worse thing come upon you
[1:02:08] what could be worse did not being able
[1:02:10] to walk death that could be worse God it
[1:02:17] was he was able to do before you go back
[1:02:18] to being paralyzed yeah what could be
[1:02:21] worse than that it kind of goes with
[1:02:22] death yes to be lost lost did not have
[1:02:28] faith in Jesus Christ that be the worst
[1:02:31] thing that could happen to him but it
[1:02:33] could be some worse physical ailment as
[1:02:35] well right so I want you to see that
[1:02:38] that jesus heals that he did these great
[1:02:40] miracles but then the people had to be
[1:02:43] willing to stay clean right and they
[1:02:46] should have loved Jesus because he did
[1:02:49] the miracle and want to love serving him
[1:02:51] right so that's what we see I want to
[1:02:54] make sure you saw that their sin no more
[1:02:56] lest a worse than come around numbers
[1:02:58] stay sanctified so get your finger
[1:03:00] pointed be say today say sanctify ready
[1:03:02] stay sanctified yep you have to if
[1:03:05] you're the one that's healed I've got to
[1:03:07] stay sanctified they're also worse and
[1:03:09] will come upon you
[1:03:11] let's go Lidia John 8:11 okay this is
[1:03:24] the woman caught in the very act of
[1:03:26] doing some early awful sin and Jesus
[1:03:29] said he said I forgive you he said but
[1:03:32] go and don't do it again how many
[1:03:37] children could be honest and say there's
[1:03:38] things I do wrong but sometimes I do
[1:03:41] them again anybody be honest and say
[1:03:45] that yeah Vanessa don't sometimes right
[1:03:48] we're not getting over what we need to
[1:03:51] get over so that that happens but Jesus
[1:03:54] offers us power to get over them we have
[1:03:57] power because he said you can go and sin
[1:03:59] no more alright so when you pray and say
[1:04:03] God forgive me you can walk away and say
[1:04:05] Lord you've forgiven me I'm gonna go and
[1:04:07] sin no more but you have to have faith
[1:04:10] in that don't you yeah they have a lot
[1:04:12] of faith from now on I'm not gonna do it
[1:04:14] anymore
[1:04:16] reasonable okay last one that's going to
[1:04:18] Titus chapter 2 one of my all-time
[1:04:20] favorite scriptures I'm sure bang and
[1:04:24] his family's heard me preach this under
[1:04:26] times 9 is 211 Titus 2:11 so sanctified
[1:04:48] person can reject God's grace but we
[1:04:51] want to be sanctified children that
[1:04:54] continue in God's grace you want to keep
[1:04:57] going on to more and more of God's grace
[1:05:00] yeah up with text right after Timothy
[1:05:08] Titus 2:11 so Lydia can you help us
[1:05:12] Lydia and Sarah maybe can help us finish
[1:05:14] you Lydia
[1:05:18] 11 and 12 seats Titus 2:11 and 12
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:36] okay so God's grace has taught us some
[1:05:40] deny ungodliness and worldly lusts so to
[1:05:43] walk away from lust of the flesh lust of
[1:05:46] the eyes flee from that right run away
[1:05:48] make your arms look like they're running
[1:05:49] ready flee from those things run run run
[1:05:53] stay away from sin you have to stay away
[1:05:56] from City that's what grace will teach
[1:05:58] you right like just like Jesus said go
[1:06:01] but sin no more
[1:06:02] hey you're healed but don't sit again
[1:06:05] are also worse thing will come upon you
[1:06:07] got to stay sanctified okay okay Sarah

[1:06:35] that we might try that he might redeem
[1:06:38] us from all iniquity and purify unto
[1:06:42] himself a peculiar people zealous of
[1:06:45] good works these things speak and exhort
[1:06:48] and rebuke with all authority let no man
[1:06:52] despise thee girls if you are going to
[1:06:55] get married one day how would you want
[1:06:57] to look would you want to go out and
[1:06:59] play in the dirt and the dust and get
[1:07:02] rid of dusty dirt on your wedding day
[1:07:03] would you want to do that yeah like that
[1:07:09] you won't be as pretty if you're dirty
[1:07:14] cuz you're covered in dirt right and mud
[1:07:17] you ever seen a woman get married in mud
[1:07:20] and muck have you ever seen that how
[1:07:23] about seeing me in her hair she ever
[1:07:25] could see why why does it look weird her
[1:07:35] natural look yeah she wants to look
[1:07:37] really nice for one person I'm sure for
[1:07:40] a lot of people that day who she want to
[1:07:42] look really nice do you think he'd be
[1:07:46] pretty happy or excited if she could've
[1:07:48] been looking all covered in dirt and mud
[1:07:50] and seaming in her hair he thinks she do
[1:07:52] you think he'd like that well that's
[1:07:54] what the Bible says Jesus is trying to
[1:07:57] purify a people for himself he's trying
[1:08:01] to sanctify a people for himself what if
[1:08:04] I went to my wedding with just jeans and
[1:08:07] a t-shirt and shirt hanging out I just
[1:08:09] went to McDonald's got ketchup on her
[1:08:12] face you think sister crystal would like
[1:08:15] that she doesn't like ketchup at all she
[1:08:18] really would not like that she wasn't
[1:08:21] you need to go brush your teeth or
[1:08:22] something like that because when we come
[1:08:25] to a special time like a wedding we want
[1:08:28] to be as pure and clean as possible

[1:09:11] that he could make us clean for the
[1:09:13] wedding day for the coming for that
[1:09:15] looking for the blessing of the glorious
[1:09:17] appearing of our God and Savior Jesus
