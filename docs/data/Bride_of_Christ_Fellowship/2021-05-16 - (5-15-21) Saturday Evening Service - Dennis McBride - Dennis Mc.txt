amen it's always good to be in good fellowship among saints that love god because his presence is there and you can feel it you can feel it so that means a lot not trying to be spiritual and all that stuff is just that's just how it amen bro jesse is very dear friend of mine and prior to my last coming it was some time since we had last seen one another but when it comes to true friendships amen time and distance doesn't matter as soon as i saw him it's just like it was last week you know amen if anything he's gotten better amen more wise and all those things you know and to see its family amen it's just a blessing so i thank god for brother charles amen let's give the lord a handclap of praise for him hey man uh brother jaws keeps me laughing sometimes without even trying just in him being who he is he just he just tickles he had me cracking up on the way over here you know that was his first time flying in a while and uh he just had me cracking huh you know the plane was kind of wobbling wobbling a little a little bit and i looked over at brother charles's hand and he was clenching the side of the chair he was talking to me and all of a sudden he stopped talking i said brother what was you saying go ahead he couldn't even start he couldn't finish his statement and so it was good you know it's it's good to laugh and amen that they have the joy of the lord amen so i appreciate him amen being being with me we haven't traveled together in a while so it's a blessing to be here he really wanted to come see brother jesse and and i know that all the expectations are being met amen so i don't want to keep you long tonight we got two services tomorrow uh just praying and praying and praying and praying and i don't know it seems like uh something is settled on my heart so we just asked god to come and help us let's bow together heavenly father we thank you for all things we thank you lord for keeping us safely bringing us here lord by your grace father each member that's here lord god we thank you for keeping brother jesse and his family lord brother amen father and well there's all the saints that are here father god it's only by your grace that we are here lord lord and we thank you for that lord we just ask tonight that you would feel welcome lord in my heart i believe you are welcome lord because wherever two or more are gathered in your name there you will be father god in such an atmosphere like this lord father we know that you're here now god may your will be done or may your purpose be fulfilled according to your desire that's why we're here lord is to satisfy your desire help us now in your word lord may your word be spoken with great plainness of speech lord that even the youngest here lord might be able to grab ahold of something father granted father we pray in jesus christ holy and precious name amen amen amen okay let's in our bible saints let's turn to uh matthew chapter 26 i'm sorry matthew 6 chapter 6 matthew 6 i'm going to start at verse 7. it says but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do it says for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking that's something it says be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before ye ask how many believe that amen that goes without asking you like i know you believe that but it's just it's something when you're reading the word there's certain things kind of highlight yeah amen and he does he knows what we stand in need of before we even ask because he's god right amen but then he still wants us to pray yes amen that's always got you know like lord i don't even need to break it you already know that he said pray be obedient amen and it does does it does good for our hearts for us to pray and and to see him move amen amen all right he comes down he says in verse 9 after this manner therefore pray so now he's given instructions to his disciples on how to pray our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen from here let's go to james chapter four and we're going to read a few places here james four i want to start at verse one it says from whence come wars and fightings among you he says come they not hence even of your lust that war in your members he says ye lust and ye have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight in the war yet ye have not because ye ask not he says and ye ask watch this saints he says ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lust i want to come down to verse 13 it says go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what what shall be on the model it says for what is your life he says it is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away it says for ye for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this and that amen let's pray once more father we've read your word now god please help us in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen god bless you saying she may be seated let me read one more place of scripture here first john chapter five and i want to start at verse 14. it says and this is the confidence that we have in him notice this now this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to what his will he heareth us so he doesn't hear everything that's right am i correct amen amen but if we ask anything according to his will it says he heareth us it says and if we know that he hear her hear us it says whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him amen amen now that's all of our desires right that's right when we pray we desire to see god answer amen but there's something that god desires to see as well amen so by the grace of god i want to touch upon the subject of the lord's will amen the lord's will um this is very important to each one of us for each of our days that we live upon the earth every day of the week every hour of the day every minute of the day it's very important for us to be in the will of god because if we're not in the will of god what do we have if we're not in the will of god then whatever we are doing is completely in vain yes you know the bible actually says that there are many that worship him in vain that's right that's right isn't that something putting forth effort in many different ways financials you know just worship just whatever all the effort that people are putting forth in many places is actually in vain in the sight of god yet to them they're offering it to god and god is actually turning away from it worship yes gatherings to church services mega churches thousands of people and god is not in none of it think about that what kind of a deception is that yes sir we don't want to be deceived and by the grace of god i don't believe because of who we are to him we're his bride i don't believe we can be deceived amen i believe because of who we are to him by his grace he comes to us and he helps us he knows that we don't have it all together saints we go about life the best way we can isn't that right so the lord and and i'll pause for a moment because i don't know what i'm going to minister on tomorrow i got a little idea and i ain't want to tap into that too much of that happens to be what causes me to minister on tomorrow but you understand what i'm saying is like we don't know like what are we gonna do what are we gonna be doing at seven o'clock tonight who can tell me we don't know right we know when that time comes we can make plans right but who's to say those plans have to be carried out according to our fault that's why i believe it was here in in first no it's not first john it was in james yeah it was in james he actually says in verse 13 he says go to now ye that say and i wanna i wanna i wanna emphasize this one point this is the way of the world because i you know the brother asked me about my testimony and what have you i'm not gonna try to so much so deal with that tonight but the way of the world is do whatever you feel like god is not hell within within thought he he's not given a he's not giving the consideration right that i mean that's how right right now since majority of the world i mean we're in akron right now i guess this this is akron here right you know so we're in akron right now you know how many people are in akron and how many people right now how many people that's in acting right now how many of their minds are really on god how many are considering him asking of him you know lord what would you have me to do where would you have me to go right this is very precious in the sight of god for his creation to actually consider him because really since we don't know our own way it's impossible for us to i don't know what we'll be doing at seven o'clock i might still be preaching we'll save that for africa but i'm just saying you know i don't know i don't know what happened on tomorrow right we don't know it's by the grace of god we were able to make it here and being that we are here i believe brother charles it was the will of god for us to be here i believe it was the will of god for you to be here tonight with me god for he he saw these things before time but the key of it is is our motive and our objective you understand what i'm saying see the world they just want whatever they want life is all about them whatever i feel like whatever i want to have in life they feel like that life is here to cater to me right right to give me my desire what i want what i feel like at any given moment right and people go out to try to achieve what they want and as the bible says here in james and this is the mindset saints it says go to now ye that say he's addressing a group amen he's not just speaking out in the air amen there's something in the spirit he's seen and he's addressing it by the spirit of god ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year how do you know you're going to be there a year something might happen in a month you might break down on a way there and can't even get the way you thought you were going but he's addressing something here saints he says we're going to continue there a year about and buy and sell and get game how you know you're going to get gang you might not say on nothing that's right right yes just because you go to set up a table somewhere to try to sell a product who's to say somebody even gonna come to your table you don't know that right isn't that right yes but how many realize that by the grace of god if our motive and our objective is right we can tap into the channel of god you see through prayer we can actually tap into the very channel and the inspiration of god listen now to where we can hear his thoughts how precious is that yes young and old how precious is that for us to be in a place where we can actually hear the thoughts of god because the bible says if we ask anything according to his will how are we going to know his will we don't know but we can be in a place of consecration amen and consideration of god to where he's pleased to come down and make known his will to you and i amen now we're not so that we can now give him his will he ain't interested in getting nothing else that's why he was so pleased with abel abel gave god his will and god received it amen but on the other hand his brother he gave something else that's right now this is a very key point right here now what his brother gave was the will of satan that's right right that's right like i said many churches out there many people gathering but whose will are they fulfilling that seems something you got a church building that has a cross on the top you have people coming dressed right right they're greeting one another in the name of the lord they're coming in together right they have a unity among them they're having church service right and god is not even there he rejects it just like he did cain he rejected king's worship why that don't seem right but look at the effort he put forth look at the care the real care that he that he poured into what his offering was to god and god didn't know that you would think many people think of god in this way see god he's so loving and so kind man he he he looks upon your efforts and whatever you do he just receives it he's just there to accept it and and just be all right and just just you know no he's not like that he told cain look i can't accept that right he saw how it made kane feel listen now and he didn't feel the comfort king oh it's all right you know you try you'll do better next time now he rejected it then he came right back and said now if you do like your brother then it'll be accepted yes sir now i'm talking about the lord's will cain didn't care about the lord's will that's right right right all he cared about is what he had in his mind of what he thought god wanted and here it is god telling him i don't want that but in his mind you should have accepted what i gave you and his countenance failed and he became wrong to the point to where his father led him to kill abel why over jealousy yes so as we can see here that's a characteristic one of the characteristics i hate to say it in that way lord have mercy he was the seed of the serpent right and it wasn't within him even after god's will was made plain he still couldn't accept it that's right he held to his own way right that's tough but it happens all the time people come to church they hear the word of god they hear god's will being communicated yes you can't get no more pure than that god himself stood there and told cain what like we was talking that was god i mean you were thinking of god talk to somebody they may not bring about some kind of a change and it would be an immediate agreement but he was able to stand in the face of god and in his in his heart disagree and walk away i don't want your will you should have took what i wanted to give you so here james is addressing that spirit the kind of a spirit that just want to go and just do whatever it feels to do all right all right good and not consider his maker and he addresses it and corrects it he says now what you should say is if the lord's will then we'll do this or that you don't dictate to god how to let your day or your year or whatever to go back you ain't in control like that we're not in control like that you know what it's been time saints where my wife my wife we needed a car and man she had a certain car in mind back then she was into many things and oh man she wanted a honda odyssey oh uh huh yeah i wasn't looking at hondas and whatever you know and i'm i'm just in neutral because i'm like we need a car and i'm praying i'm like lord help us i'm like lord not to say she wasn't praying but this was this is where i was like lord just lead us to the vehicle that you would have us to have because i know that if this if this the vehicle that you choose for us it'll be the best vehicle for us it'll serve us well that was my mind it would be nice to have an odyssey lord but whatever vehicle you choose so low and behold the lord allowed us to receive a vehicle through a brother who had a dealership at that time he went to the auction and he found us a vehicle it was a nice little clean vehicle but it wasn't a honda odyssey and the brother he brought it to us and whatever and it was something that we never would have thought of but it was it was well kept it was owned by a marketing company so the maintenance and everything was up on it or whatever man it was running like a like a sewing machine everything was clean and in shape you know and i'm looking i'm like well at least it's clean and it ain't run down it was well kept so then it was time for my wife to come and see it and i could tell about how she approached it she wasn't feeling that man it was a plymouth voyager she and she was she got in and i'm looking at her and she got out and she looked at me she said you like this i said well sweetie for the money that we had you know i'm just i don't seem like we need to go with it you know and that van served us well it took us places i drove to go preach and all i mean it served us well yeah yeah you know so obviously that was god's will it didn't come in a form shape or name brand that that may have been desired but he gave us what he wanted us to have you understand what i'm saying so meaning when we when we pray we have to be able to be satisfied with whatever god brings to us we need listen it's okay to have a desire to have a certain thing or whatever a certain career or whatever the case might be but we need to be able to be neutral enough and tender enough to say well lord however you choose to come let your will be done and not mine hallelujah now i've seen god give me my desire over the years on many occasions i didn't i was surprised i was like lord you you were okay with let me have this that's how i felt i'm like man god you you really thought about me and you you gave me the desire of my heart but see it's growth there are certain times and stages and phases in our life where god has to teach us things he has to help us to devalue sir he has to help certain things to become devalued in our minds he had to bring me to a place from from living a lifestyle of of just going after what i wanted to be humbled and being able to be content yeah now that's a chord right there guarding this with contentment is great game that's the that's the grooming of a child of god that's growing up to be placed that goes in many different directions there yes so now matthew 26 [Music] all right we all know that jesus christ amen was god and flesh right yeah it was the fullness of the godhead body according to the scriptures right yeah but even though he was who he was he was 100 god but how many realized he also was 100 man yes sir minus the fallen parts of a man right yet he was a man so watch this matthew 26 and verse 35 says peter said unto him though i should die with though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples then come of jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples set ye here while i go yonder and pray and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye hear and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying wash their saints oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from what was he talking about there was something he was getting ready to face right that cup is a divine lot whether favorable or unfavorable right we got to take whatever god ordained for us if you left it up to me i wouldn't have experienced no hardships no strains no frustrations it would have been on the fly bed of ease yes sir i wouldn't no trouble if it was up to me but had i had my way i wouldn't out there would be no growth there will be no maturity amen so god don't let us have our way like that he he sets things within our course and our path that's specifically designed for you and i things that you you you you would if you could go around right but he don't give you a choice but yet there are choices as in this case he could have walked clean away from gethsemane he could have walked clean away from calvary but because he was who he was he subjected himself to his own word praise the lord amen and even though now he he's actually crying in this now he's saying if it'd be possible let this cup pass his own words now he did that what about you and i yeah we go through things i'm sure even as young people it's thoughts and things you're growing up there's thoughts that you you consider in your life which way your life is gonna go you know and you don't know you have desires though you see but a characteristic to me of a son or daughter of god that they can have desires there's nothing wrong with that but over the top of that what caps that off is what he said here he says let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt hey man that's the that's the best thing we can do because now lord i'm letting you know what my desire is but at the same time you have a will that i'm not aware of in this case christ knew what the will of the father was because he told the disciples ahead of time isn't that right he was the word he knew right isn't that something even annoying yeah yeah realizing what it is he was going to have to go through it still caused him the strain and the pressure it caused him to ask just if it be possible but he knew it wasn't possible right so he humbled himself yes sir let thy will be done and not mine amen amen in the sight of god saints that's so precious because like again if you're not in the will of god what do you have where are you going you spinning your wheels your life is nothing right amen yes lord i like that praise the lord amen proverbs 3 and verse 5 says trust in the lord with all thine heart he says and lean not unto thine own understanding yeah yeah in james they were leaning upon their own understanding you understand how they felt things should go how many realize that don't matter i mean it's okay i mean you you're human we're half phil i think this should go this way okay that's right but just know that god has a will and if it don't go that way just just be ready to be all right with that i thought my life was going to go a certain way right i wouldn't have been here had it going the way that i thought yes when i got out of the military saying i'll be i was being offered 100 000 a year jobs but you know what kept me from going out this is at a time where the lord had caught my attention but i hadn't really to me come so far yet with him i was still like a toddler yeah no not even a toddler probably about spiritually speaking by the age of your son i was a baby you understand what i'm saying but yet it was something that was in my heart and then the only thing that kept me from taking a job is i considered my family and the fact that the job was going to keep me away from everything for at least three weeks out of every month i thought about church because the lord had just started dealing with my heart i thought about my family and there was a decision that was made that i didn't even i didn't even know but because of where my heart was because i was considering god he led me into his will listen now his will at that time led me to less money his will at that time kept me from getting the most up-to-date car brand new off the line the 200 000 house his will kept me from that but guess what for some reason somehow i was all right when i finally got the next job that i was going to get and i got my first check i'm beyond i said man i made a mistake it's a little bit of money but yet i stayed and i worked not knowing he had a ministry i had to say that i had to go to brother anderson's amen why he saw something ahead ahead of me that i didn't see my i couldn't see myself but by his grace and i'ma say it in that way because it was only by his grace that he helped me to humble myself to the inspiration of his spirit to make the right decision to stay there because from that decision now i was able to move into the furthering of what he had for me hallelujah and i can honestly say where i am right now is worth more than any any amount of money i could have ever made glory trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding but he says in all thy ways acknowledge him there is power in prayer [Music] the lord was emphasizing that to me while i was in that room back there tonight some things that were upon my heart and i was just praying i was praying before we left the room i got here i continued to pray and just praying i didn't even know what to preach tonight but before i left the will of the lord came across my heart but i just wasn't sure so i continued to pray and even even i thought about brother branham brother branham said if he wanted to find the will of god he said this is what he did he said he prayed about it and then he said he would get up and he would see which way his heart was leaning he said then he'll wait and go and pray some more and then he'll come up he'll come up again and he'll see which way his heart is leaning and then he'll begin to take steps in that way that's how i felt tonight concerning this message and as i got up from prayer brother jesse was up here and he began to speak about the will of god so many different directions sayings i know you're following me we're not going to be much longer okay there are situations where um and this is this is kind of uh tough here there are places that the bible talks about a certain uh group a certain group of people they're people of the world right they they live by the spirit of the world right and the spirit of the world is the spirit of satan right these people can care less about anything concerning god's will all they know is just their world and and them you know everybody calling themselves a god now you know people of the world they don't adopted that you know you know i'm a god i'm a king i'm a queen who called you that it's self-proclamation it's what it is amen god has real kings and queens amen kings and priests the bible calls us right right amen but yet the world that's just how they are by the nature that's inside of them you know they're doing the lust of their father right but notice how the bible talks about this group right you know i'm an end on this because i i don't believe this is among us but yet this is a part of god's word pertaining to this subject here it says in in in romans chapter 16 and verse 17 it says now beseech you brother and mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them it says for they that are such notice how he says this for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ they're religious right right they actually think they're serving god how many really that's how demons work demons had demons have people worshiping them but the demon deceives the person into thinking they're worshiping god the demon don't say you know i'm a demon deceiving you right think how i talk it comes across as though it's god now that's very heavy right there yeah that's very that's real it's a sad truth yes how it says this now for such he says he says they he says they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ notice what it says but their own belly now that's not talking about them going to eat a bunch of food amen that's actually talking about the seed of their desire know what's in their soul what they lust after yeah yeah you see they're anointed with evil spirits right and those evil spirits give them cravings so when it says here notice this it says they serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly it says and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple so you can take this setting saints and you can place it within false religions yes right jesus said himself he said you are of your father the devil and his lusts right yes they were serving their own deadlies an evil spirit anointing them taking them off course all focus all focus of the real and the right thing to now worship satan and become yous and representatives used by him and representatives for him praise the lord sir here's another scripture that captures this it's in philippians chapter three starting at verse 17. it says brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk as walk so as ye have us for us and on a sample or an example in verse 18 watch how it says this it says for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ he says whose end is destruction notice how it says this now it says whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who do mind earthly things they become accustomed to and their lives are constantly being the course of their lives are being dictated by a wrong spirit causing them to be self-focused seemingly but they don't realize they're actually worshiping a devil about they're serving an evil spirit what does that evil spirit make them do go after everything but the will of god king was serving his own belly right yes how many understand yeah what was that it was the desire of the spirit that was dominating him yes sir yes sir amen but the grace of god came in and set me on course amen the bible says be transformed by the renewing of your mind as i said as a child receptive to the word of god that i didn't understand but yet something on the inside of me helped me to embrace it amen i was being transformed i began to be changed by the renewing of my mind to now come and be introduced to the things of god amen and and by the grace of god be able to begin to understand the things of god and as i humble myself through his spirit he continued to feed me and feed me and give me strength and give me strength and help me to grow up and i still got more growing i ain't there yet now but i'm i'm on my way i i'm not that man no more that man is i don't left him behind amen i'm a new man we are we are new we are new creatures in christ isn't that right we can feel it we know it yes we ain't the same ones the devil tried to pull us back he tried to toy with our thoughts try to make us seem like there's not much progress that's been made that's a lie right god has done a great work amen and he's continue he's here right now in this service he's doing a great work right now for for the children when you eat good things do you feel it going through your body no you taste it with your mouth as you eat it but then once it goes in you don't feel it going through your body and giving you the things you stand in need of or whatever that's how it is when it comes to the word of god we receive it we take it in and you may not feel anything going on at that time but believe me something is happening amen hey man whether you can feel it or not that don't mean it ain't moving that don't mean it's not supplying amen that don't mean it's not causing things to take place listen even as we sit here now all types of things are happening in the spiritual realm there's a place i see it i'm looking right at it there's a place that god is calling us to amen we're just now scratching the surface amen amen there are there are things among us right now among us right here in this church that have yet to surface yes sir yes sir but god is positioning us he's dealing with us he's helping us to surrender how many can feel that i know i'm not i ain't the only one i know what i i can when i was fellowshipping today brother i felt god i felt the presence of god he was pleased he's moving he's doing things now the devil to come to us and say you know ain't nothing much happening you know ain't nothing going on in the church all that's lies amen he want us to believe that so that we can now listen to him and become depressed amen and distracted and listen miss the simplicity of god there's things i prayed about saints and god has to stop me and help me to begin to see amen listen the glimpse of his movie in my children it's things that i've been praying about it and there's things happening right there and god got to stop me and show me you see that right there that's what you pray for right it's not the fullness of it but he's showing me his movement he's moving he's moving upon our prayer saints because the bible actually lets us know i'm gonna look this scripture up and i'm gonna let you all go for tonight amen i want to read this scripture to you and it goes right along with the message by the grace of god philippians chapter 2 where are we at i just had it yeah here we go all right it says in verse 13. it says for it is god right it says for it is god which worketh in you notice this now the bible says if we ask anything according to his will it says he heareth us yeah isn't that right now you want to see how perfect this thing is i mean it's like god has made this thing in such a way right notice how he no no doesn't notice how the script the scripture says for it is god which worketh in you both to will so god actually puts his will in our hearts how did they know what to offer what did he do to find that out go back and read and tell me tell me what did abel do to find out what to offer to god what did he do it was put into his heart amen god injected his will into abel's heart so how are we going to know the will of god in the same exact way you ain't got gonna work nothing up you ain't got to go overboard with anything just be yourself be sincere make sure your motive and your objectives are right meaning is not selfishness tied into it amen you can have a desire pray about a desire but yet be satisfied and say lord let your will be done and not mine and if it's your will lord i'll rejoice in you giving me that my desire but if it's not your will but even in that it's still his desire hallelujah he just chose to give you something that you happen to like praise the lord but notice this now it says for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do with his good pleasure isn't that wonderful you ain't got to work for it he just got to wait in patience and serve god and then consecrate ourselves to god and like i said god will by his grace allow us to catch his mind and then ask for his will that he gives to us he gives us what his will is and then haves us to actually what his will is you can't get no better than that hallelujah isn't that right yes sir you can't get no better than that that whole plan that god got is is is top-notch hey man it's top-notch saints i read there's one quotation here to you i got more his saints but i'm trying to taper it down he says he will give you the desire of his heart of your heart he says he says he promised that he says you know that he promised to give you the desire of your heart he says and let your desire be the word of god let your desire be his will never your own will his will he says you ask for him for something you ask him for something he don't give it to you say thank you lord you know what's good now that's real maturity yes sir amen yeah to come to a place to where it's not all about you but it's all about him that's the only thing that matters lord let your will be done that's the only thing that has life in it that's the only thing that counts for every one of the days that we live upon the earth every hour of the day every minute of the day and you don't have to constantly go around and saying every minute every hour lord what's your will what's your will what's your will you just pray and you just allow yourself to be neutral like i said don't be selfish but just say lord however you want things to be just let your will be done and that invites his spirit i believe to just come down in that sweet anointing and just begin to lead you i don't always hear a voice you don't always know that you're being led isn't that right you can be laid and not even be aware of it isn't that right yes sir i was talking to simon about this and i got excited i'm gonna share this with y'all and i'ma stop i promise when brother brown had that bible that had that that page in it that wasn't printed exactly right i'm gonna walk down this timeline with you just for a moment y'all y'all with me yeah all right so first the lord at the printing company the lord caused the machine to act up while it was printing that particular page in order for the page not to be right it had to happen at the printing company right listen now he allowed the quality inspection department to overlook that page i work in quality i know how i was supposed to go huh listen now this is they're just just following me because this thing i was like lord look at you he allowed the quality inspection company to miss that page and not even pick it up pick up on it right so then he allowed that particular page to get put into a particular bible that was going to go into a particular box he allowed that box to get shipped to a particular store did the driver feel led or the packing person did they feel led to put it did they know they were being led by god but listen that particular bible had to make it to a certain store so god was in control of the whole routing of that book and then when sister branham had the thought to get her husband a new bible who gave her that thought huh and then when the thought came and she left to go look for a bible i'm sure there were many other bookstores around but she was led to go to the store that that bible was sent to and i'm sure it wasn't just one copy there were multiple copies of that same bible but when she went into that store she was led to go to a certain section of the store and go to a certain shelf and her eyes went to a certain book did she feel led not at all and she purchased that book and that was the very bible that was used for christ to be able to come in this hour and identify himself in a very similar way as he did in the scriptures when the priest handed him the scroll that bible had to be like that because when brother branham couldn't find the place the catholic priest came up and gave him his bible and even the prophet said in a later sermon he said that only had he been on his toes christ was there inside of him identifying what he was doing right at that moment and brother branham wasn't even aware of it and he was the one that was being used right boy that make me fool there yeah but that's how god is we don't have to always be conscious and aware of what he's doing we're just being led by his grace the lord's will the most important thing in our lives yes sir is this right here yes sir you tell me what's more important that's right right nothing hallelujah nothing god bless you saints appreciate your patience your time and in my heart i feel like the lord's will was done tonight let's give him a handclap of prayer [Applause] um let us stand together if we will let us buy our hearts and as we're bowing if there's anybody that desires prayer you're more than welcome to come up but understand also that even if you come up for a prayer you're going to have to believe god for whatever it is you're standing in need [Music] heavenly father lord we thank you for bringing us by your grace into this place this place of understanding the importance of knowing the will into this place lord to where we even desire your will understanding now father that is that put your will into our hearts because it's you is that's working within us such simple things are such powerful things these are the things lord god that make the way for greater things to take place these simple things sometimes that we overlook father god are the very things you you you have your eye right on for us to be led by your spirit more personally for us to actually have a real sincere desire for your will to be done and we constantly laying that before you but in all of our ways to acknowledge you lord you said you will direct our path what greater thing is it lord there's no greater thing than to have our pairs more perfectly directed by god whatever energy is spent whatever efforts are put forth to have it hidden the bullseye hitting the target lord what greater thing it is than that to us there's nothing greater to be fully submitted lord under your control
