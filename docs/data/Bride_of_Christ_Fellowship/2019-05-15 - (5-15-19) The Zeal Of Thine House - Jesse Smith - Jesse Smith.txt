[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's take our Bibles tonight let's go to John chapter 2 verse 11 John 2:11 right to just look at a thought here about the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up what's called the zeal of mine house or thine house rather message kind of about the importance of the house of God and then deal with that quite a bit and I'd like to continue that this is kind of like a warm-up heading into the weekend at Michigan I just feel led to administer on this thought there so I doubt anybody there listens to our services so I don't have to worry about that I like to preach on it it's been seven years since I've preached some of these thoughts so it's been a while so for our church it's good I mean a lot of it is review but some of it will feel new by God's grace so john 2 verse 11 if you there say Amen this beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him verse 12 John 2:12 after this he went down to Capernaum he and his mother his brother and his disciples and they continued there are not many days and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting and when he made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house an House of merchandise and his disciples remember that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up then answered the Jews and said unto Him what sign show us that unto us seeing that thou doest these things she's answered and said of them destroy this temple in three days will I raise it up or amen that's my heads for one more word of Prayer Heavenly Father we've read your word we're so thankful for it Lord God the zeal of your house ate up your son and so father we just come reverently tonight we ask you to speak through your word Lord father we've been looking at this importance of the local church lately through this purpose series Lord God and the fusion series and I just pray God you'll minister to us tonight be with those here physically and those Lord livestreaming I pray give us a real spiritual feeding tonight in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you mean to see the praise God so like to look at this thought here the zeal of thine house and like I said it's kind of like a warm-up for this weekend I'll probably administer that's how I've been feeling lead I'm probably ministered on this same thought on Sunday morning and Sunday night I'm not too sure I was thinking about doing the Statue perfect man with the young people there we'll see I'm just kind of had a kind of not sure yet on that one or may preach the waters of separation to them I'm not quite sure which direction I'll go or there's a message I preached years ago about the revival with the young people like looking at Hezekiah day he's a 25 year old King and he had a great revival so I may look at that thought - not quite sure off to keep praying I definitely feel this thought to preach one of those services the zeal of thine house now notice in John - Christ goes up to Jerusalem he's freshly anointed he's freshly off his first miracle he turned water into wine amen and we were told this testimony and when we went to Jefferson movie where that testimony at one of the the communion services with brother Branham at the tabernacle they'd ran out of they ran out of communion wine brother Graham they were all gonna get nervous and mother Brown said let's just pray and bow our heads and I guess brother Neville was there and they prayed and as brother man prayed the empty cups filled up with wine amen and I believe that same ahead and brother Neville told about it and it was just broadcast all over and so we see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he changes water too wide or he can bring up wine he can create wine where there is no wine right you can create squirrels where there is no squirrels amen I believe that with all my heart because it just fits God's character it's the same thing he did with Isaac he may made a ram there where there was no RAM God provided the RAM God provided the squirrel God provided the wine God's the Jehovah Jireh so he comes up here and Jesus makes a cord so he takes a few cords and he wraps them together and then he starts whipping those cords around and driving people out and the Bible said not just some but all of them he drove out every animal every moneychanger he drove by the house of God and that was a natural type of what Jesus was doing in the spiritual right he was cleaning out the natural church but what he was really doing was showing that the spiritual condition the church needed cleaned out amen so he drove everything out and it was a good a fresh start praise God that's kind of what he did of course we know that like the when Jesus was crucified is like Passover right and then next day the feast of unleavened bread so it's kind of like cleaning out the leaven right it was a symbol of what he was going to do and they asked him it's in what authority do you have cleaning out the church and he said I'm gonna give you this sign destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up amen that was his sign that's the sign that I can do this I've got power over death so I've got authority to clean out my house my father's house hallelujah because the father has given me power over death so it's a little thing for me to clean out my father's house amen and his disciples when they watch it they thought my and I love this whenever we see Jesus moving what does it do whenever we see Jesus do anything it should remind us of the scripture praise God because jesus said the Holy Ghost will remind you of things it will bring all things to your remembrance is that right and I love that because it shows the Holy Spirit's working on the disciples to remind them of the scripture and that's what it always do it always point us to the Word of God he said the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up now zeal in the Greek and I don't have many slides here tonight I've been kind of working on something here or working on the notes for the the weekend but zeal means boiling-hot fervor of mind and zeal so the boiling hot nature of Jesus as was eating him up it was eating him up it was consuming him so he was just consumed with it and so you can picture Jesus angry right or he's very zealous he's got a lot of zeal and he's cleaning out the house house of God just driving it all out amen now for what I read in history they were only in the Gentile court you know they had a Gentile court and then the court of women and then the court of the men and then the priests the priests court so this is still the outer core this wasn't even the holy the holy part of the court and yet Jesus was still interested in keeping every part of the house of God clean amen that's what I say Jesus wants not just your soul in your mind he wants your body cook pure as well praise God the Bible said lift up holy hands that means your hands haven't touched cigarettes right or alcohol or hasn't held a cell phone that had a dirty picture on it right lift up holy hands into the Lord see he wants the whole thing cleaned out because members slowly you know if you study history you know the reason they brought animals in there was so the Israelites they wouldn't have to travel and drag along the animals as they traveled you know north to Jerusalem or south because you know Jew days in the southern part of Israel whether whichever way they were traveling it was just kind of like convenience it was just a convenience for them and but convenience cause them to backslide right cause evil spirits to come in because then the men started changing the the balances they could make a few extra bucks you know I made a good deal today at the house of God I certainly got those worshipers you know charged little extra tax on their I charged little extra fee and Jesus God knew it the whole time but God showed it to his son Jesus and he said that doesn't belong that kind of thing doesn't belong in other words your mind our minds need to be purely on worshiping God not upon a financial gain not upon the number of people are not upon anything physical but it needs to be on just worshiping God and so Jesus had seen their focus was off that and it was on money it was on financial gains and they they've gotten the wrong focus when they were at church and it need to get back on it so that's what Jesus did he came and the Bible said he was consumed with zeal he was consumed with boiling hot thoughts right he's boiling you ever been boiling mad at anybody all my children should be saying hey man dad no that's gonna yes of course I've been mad at people too and that's all you can think of right so you just can't get it off your mind that's kind of like what Jesus said he was consumed with the zeal of God God's house doesn't doesn't have anything to do with selfish motives it's all selfless all focus is on Almighty God amen now what's amazing church is that have you studied the Bible as I studied a few years ago he didn't just clean the temple one time he cleaned it twice so go to mark 11 you'll see the second time he cleans it and I like that he cleaned at the beginning of his ministry at the end of his ministry what a type a man of the seven churches hey he cleans that at the beginning they got their first love and he's got to clean it out at the end before he raptures it off the earth they met him yeah that's right he's got to bring them back member the fullness of Pentecost the fullness of the beginning will be in the bride amen so see a clean us at the beginning and a clean house at the end so see that's a type of the bride of Jesus Christ the church being cleaned out the beginning first love and clean out at the end first love mark 11:14 and Jesus answers said unto it Noah and eat the fruit thereafter forever and his disciples heard it remember this is the week before he was crucified so Jesus cleans it out right before he was crucified remember cuz he he he cursed it and then they come back out the next day they left and then they're to come back in the city right verse 15 and they come to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast them out that sold and bought the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple Wow so you couldn't even carry something Jesus was so concerned not to work not to have any any other motive than just worship keep out any keep out any selfish motive or make this only about worshipping Christ that's what we need to make this you know we need to make coming to church it's not about who sees us it's not about what clothes we wear we should spend more time spraying for our spiritual clothing than our physical then spending on our physical clothing amen right I know I know I practice that I'll get up in the morning and you know 5:00 in Sunday morning I'll spend like till nine o'clock study and then a quick try to get dressed quick from 9:00 to 9:30 then try to get ready to leave at 9:50 to go to church to try to get ready as fast I can because I don't want it to be about look in the mirror and say does everything look good I want everybody to be impressed Jesus like you're not gonna carry don't even bring a vessel in here just come here to worship God and he had the zeal of God he had the boiling-hot thoughts of God this is what please God remember Jesus said it plainly I only do those things that what pleased the father and he said the only things I do is what the father shows me first glory so the father was showing him you need to do this you need to show the people it's not about money or popularity or women or relationships or anything physical it's all about glorifying the Father and I love it right here because he says my house is called a House of Prayer so anything that hinders our prayer church we need to get rid of and I'm speaking for us mostly our thoughts right anything that would hinder our thoughts and hinder our prayers at church should be cast aside okay because Jesus said this is a house of prayer that's why I don't mind you know if we spend a little more time on prayer and the song services come short a little bit I have no problem with that because this is a house of prayer I love when people pray before or after church the thing to do is remember that God wants to hear from us amen God wants us to talk to heaven as we saw on Sunday God wants us to reach up Iran sit and touch the throne of God amen verse 17 and he taught saying of them is it not written my house should be called of all Oh Nick the house of prayer but Yumi's uh-huh and the scribes the chief priests heard it and saw how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people were astonished at his doctrine so a week before he dies he cleans out the house of God I notice look how fast a backsliding can take place within three and a half years now we know it can happen a lot faster than that right we've seen people and it's happened to them they can backside in a week I've seen people backside in one or two days right though government and I pray I pray with him here at the altar of this very altar they'll be on fire have a Bible study with him on Monday then backslide Tuesday don't even see him Wednesday at church I've had that before I'm a witness so does but look how fast Jerusalem backslidden Jesus preached three nine years so at the beginning he cleaned it out he comes back a week before his ministry is over cleans it out and they'd already backs then in three and a half years look how the devil likes to move back in slowly jesus said if you kick him out you better fill it with God's presence or else he's gonna bring seven more thieves into your house right because it's now it's a den of thieves a bunch of thieves looking around who can I make money off of I can't wait all maybe I can pull it I should know from other people yeah that's what it was can you imagine it pretending claiming to be Jews claiming to be worshipping God Almighty can you believe that and Jesus says you're a bunch of den of thieves now did you know brother answer this jesus said my man said Jesus went up in the temple looked upon the people with anger kicked over the sacrifices that Jehovah required and screamed out so but Ram said he didn't just go in there kind of upset he went there were angry with anger and screamed out it's written my father's house is made a house of prayer and you've made it a fees so see I'm not too far off Jesus when I'm yelling or screaming or preaching or pointing or clapping or spitting I'm not too far from where Jesus was and anybody that don't believe that or anybody that don't like that kind of preaching they sure went like Jesus too much right look over brother Adam says today this is a part in 1963 he says what would he do today if he come to our modern churches there would be some more table moving there would be some more pew jumping for he'd tear it to pieces I wonder what it would take for me to throw over some of these chairs here to give us a little illustration I know they're connected side kind of to disconnect him first and throw him over but Rodin said there were he'd tear it to pieces Jesus Christ if he was here today and saw how they're letting homosexuals preach the gospel or how they're doing prosperity sermons and don't and they take the blood of Jesus Christ away they become a den of thieves the preachers right and the people he said he dared to pieces it'd be the same thing don't you see Jesus is very scriptural he was the word he had not to write anything he was the word he was the Living Word and the people fail to recognize it amen so we'd have pew jumpers today if Jesus could get in all these churches think about all the churches we passed on the way to church children we saw some really nice big ones where they look fancy they got nice landscaping and real big beautiful they got big beautiful windows and it looks fine but if they're off the word and the hearts of those people are full of dead men's bones and they just outwardly they're beautiful but in word they're full of corruption Jesus would walk in those beautiful churches and throw the pews over and say my house is a house of prayer you need to preach the word and he'd look on them anger and scream at them so don't feel bad when your dad or the Evangelist screams at you because it's not us it's Christ in us and that's if we've done wrong if we done good then it's not to you and you say lord help those people but thank you for the truth of God amen now I want you to see that that's very important so he cleaned it out at the beginning and the end of his ministry now go back let's look at the Old Testament brother Brahim cause this the rapture text we'll go to Psalms 27 for so I'm 27 for so brother man teaches this for the rapture in 1965 he said one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire his temple and then verse 5 speaks must speak of the squeeze and the rapture for in the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall you hide me he shall set me up upon a rock so this is brother branham's text for the rapture amen so God has a pavilion or a secret of his tabernacle where he'll hide us what your course would have to be the meeting in the air or the marriage supper of the Lamb he shall set me on a rock but he uses the text that David desires one thing to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of his life and we know David was a man after God's own heart raised the Lord so this tells us the heart of God is to dwell with God in his house every day and that's why Jesus said I that's why the Bible said he had the zeal of God to clean out the house of God because that is the heart of God amen so David had a love and a longing for God's house which we know is our physical gathering right but also it's a it's the true house of God because this place is going to burn but the the heavenly marriage supper of the Lamb that's not going to burn amen that's that's where we want to go that's where we have eternal bodies amen now it's like the sons of korah in psalms 42:1 you got your bible psalms 42:1 now you remember the sons of Korah I think I hope you do Cora was I believe swallowed up in the earth and I'm not mistaken the sons of Korah I'm sorry the Korah and all those men tried to make their own censors right and they said all we're just as holy as Moses we can go into the holiest of Holies and I think they were swallowed up in the earth I'm not mistaken but their son the sons of Korah and the lineage of Korah actually came to be obedient servants of God look at verse Psalms 40 sounds 42:1 yeah to the chief musician mastiha for the sons of Korah as the heart panted after the water Brooks so my so panteth my soul after thee O God my soul thirsts for thee for the Living God when I when shall I come and appear before my god so this is a song for the workers of the tabernacle the sons of Korah they didn't eat the bread like the sons of the Levites they didn't eat the bread all's they did brother and sister was cover up the pieces and carrier that's all they did they carried it from place to place they just they just took care of the outer parts of the tabernacle and yet the Bible said that their souls thirsted for God and they wanted to come and appear before God amen as a heart or a deer pants after the water so my soul pants after the Oh God so these weren't even the ones that can feel God's presence they couldn't even see God's presence they couldn't even eat God's bread or see the light of the of the menorah or the the candlestick they couldn't see that yet they longed to see it amen right amen they longed to see it and that's why brother bran tells us he says he said shin's will go through death to go to church they just got to get there it's their life if they don't they feel like they're perishing where did he get that idea brother have says if you don't go to church a real Christian feels like they're perishing where does he get that thought right here in Psalms 42 as the heart panteth for the water so my soul pants for thee an animal that's really thirsty feels like they're perishing if they don't have water a Christian that doesn't get to the house of God feels like they're perishing because they don't have the waters of God's Word they may see where does one get these thoughts he gets it right from the word go to Psalms 84 1 this is where Bram gets these thoughts he gets it right from the scripture so I was 84 1 and 2 to the chief musician upon get getteth a song for the sons of korah how amiable are thy Tabernacles that's lovely how lovely are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hosts my soul longeth yay even fainteth for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh cried out for the Living God so this was a place that the sons of korah felt like we can contact God amen God's gonna hear us when we go to the house of God and we crowd to God God's gonna hear me because I met his requirement I brought the sacrifice other priests sacrifice for me I confess my sins whether it was a trespass offering or a peace offering or a meal offering whichever offering you brought sin offering you you offered it you met God's requirement and you cried out to God my heart he said cries out for the Living God Oh God show yourself alive in my life amen like we seen on Sunday I talked to both the people we prayed for and both people were demon powers were working on them during the service and then I was wondering why I was preaching on demons you know I was quote brother branham I was wondering about that and I got to talk to both of matress and they both said afterwards it was all gone by God's grace that's what we that's what we're that's what we're here for to cry out living God come on the see bless your children deliver your children help your children and what does he knew he comes and does it amen if we can just believe God's Word and have confidence in God God will show up because he's a Living God amen hallelujah how beautiful are the Tabernacles of God and not because like oh this is beautiful sharp TV oh there's dustier not so beautiful anymore that's not that the beauty of coming here is not the people or the furniture it that God comes and answers prayer hey man that's the beauty Church now I'm gonna just skip down to some more scripture here now remember Jesus's custom in Luke 4:16 we're not going to read it but as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read so you would find Jesus every Sabbath day in the synagogue and of course we know he read the scriptures when he said this day the Scriptures fulfilled there in Luke chapter 4 they even called him up to read so men had opportunities to read now remember Hebrews 10:24 2:25 said we must gather he said so much the more as you see that day approaching so as we see the day of Jesus Christ returning we've got to be together more I like that David I love that and those and those who do come and stay prove they're the true children of God that's one of the evidences why shouldn't they one of evidence maybe that's one of the proofs that you're a real child of God is when you continue with Holy Ghost field Christians that's in the first John 2:19 lady can you pull it up here first John 2:19 they went out from us because but they were not of us for if they'd been of us and they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us so when people leave our church if they go to another church that still that's still I mean but if they leave our church and go out into the world that proves they were not of us they were not amongst real believers that's right brother Ram prays he I haven't read these in a while but man prays for new converts he said Lord may they find a good home a good church home and they remain faithful at the post of duty until death shall set them free from this earthly course amen brother have one to see people get saved find a home Church and stay there until they died or got raptured amen but man said every man ought to have a home church home you ought to have a place not just float from pillar to post but have somewhere where you go to church and call it your church all right now he says just before I pray for this sick he said he said if something's happened to you you got saved promise me you'll find a good gospel church somewhere a church that teaches the full gospel the power of God his resurrection joined up with those people make yourself a church home don't just stray around loose on the streets go get a good church somewhere of your choice where the gospel and the power of God has made known and the signs of eternal life is in there the signs that was in Christ he said promise me make me a vow vowed to God and to me that you just got saved and you'll find a home Church don't live out there and one around the world find God's house find the temple of God the beautiful amiable Tabernacles of God and stay there and hunger and thirst after the Living God promise me amen he said promise me you'll do that and again he says it in Washington he says mate Lord may they find a church home somewhere close to where they're living and be a faithful member of the body Christ until you call them home and that's something blind bartimaeus in Albert I'm sorry Edmonton Alberta I don't know if it's Alberta every person that st. ought to have a church home they ought to be in the church and there every time the church has a service now look what here this is important brother Branham said you're an heir if you don't have a home Church so think about that think about all the people we know they just you know do tape services in their homes or don't have a home church but RAM says this in explaining healing and Jarius in Illinois in 1954 he says that many of these poor wandering straying children Strang around through the world tonight without a church home Granite Lord that they'll see their heir and come to the house of the Living God amen someone without a church homes in air because the church home is where God feeds his sheep amen this is where God feeds the flock of God all right and as you know brother Branham said in 1965 when Perry green started the church in Tucson Arizona he said this is my church he said I've been here three years having any many doors open to me he says this is our church so that was gonna be his home Church and we know his wife was attending there even before he passed away there in December 65 now let's go to Psalm 77 13 this is always a blessing scripture for us so I'm seventy seven thirteen the Bible says thy way O God is in the sanctuary who is so great a God as our God so see the Bible said Jesus is the way the truth and the life so Jesus is in the sanctuary and Jesus is the way to be saved so why do we come to church because the way of God is in the house of God I'll go to Psalms 84 for so I'm 84 4 blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still which means persistently are continually praising thee Sayla so see when you come to church in your each week you're serving praising God then you're honoring God God says oh she's a continual worshipper oh look at him he continually worship he doesn't stop worshipping me he's a constant worshipper amen amen they will be continually praising God amen now let's go the psalm 73 16 this is a great blessing you and I get understanding and guidance in the house of God we understand people's end when we come to the house of God so look at Psalm 73 16 when I thought to know this it was too painful for me until I went into the sanctuary of God then I understood there and now look at that sometimes people have such pains life causes them such pain well God why did this tragedy happen to God why how come it seems like nothing bad ever happens to so-and-so and they're a sinner and they don't believe in the message and all these things David said this is so paid for me or for me until I come to God's house and God gives me understanding amen see that's why people are hurting out there that's why you know I know I said this often but that's why people always ask me I had somebody ask me I think why are you so happy I had the drycleaner asked me why are you so happy mr. Smith I said well I love Jesus I said my wife's good to me I got beautiful wonderful children I said I love Jesus I people at work asked me that they said why are you so happy all the time in fact my principal told me last week he said he said we just appreciate you you always have such joy all that they used that word joy and I didn't ask for him to tell me like what do you see about me what do you like about me principal I didn't ask that he just he just brought it up he said why are you so joy when he's and now he's a Christian too denomination and he says but we know where that comes from he said so he knows where it comes from the joy of the Lord is your strength take the joy to your 4-h meetings right take the joy of the Lord there people wonder why he's so happy Lydia all the time okay so why are you so happy people ask you that and you tell them it's because of Jesus see then I understood well why aren't you bogged down with pain why aren't you depressed how do you make it through the day because I go to the house of God and God gives me understanding for my life that's scriptural now I wanted to go let's go to first timothy 3:15 here this is a scripture haven't maybe pointed out too much first timothy 3:15 you're probably familiar with first timothy 3:16 because that's a godhead and a scripture about such perform in so first two minute li 3:15 but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth amen so Paul says if I don't come back for a while you'll have this letter and it will show you how to behave in the house of God now you know you'd if you read earlier the chapter what he just do he gave qualifications for pastors and deacons and their wives and families and then if you read the previous chapter 2 he talks about women dressing modestly and men lifting up holy hands right verse 2 8 so Paul is saying this is how you behave in the house of God dress modestly men or preachers rule your house as well deacons hold the older faith with a good conscience live pure before all men women don't gossip and live the right kind of life this is how you behave in the house of God because we are the pillar of truth we are holding up God's truth on this earth amen we're the foundational pillars the only foundational pillars this earth has of the truth of God think about that Church in Akron we're the only Church really with the full gospel that has thus saith the lord of the seals the marriage in Namur serpent seed all these things the Lord's as far as I know by there we're the only Church in Akron that's a pillar of the truth so I guess I could put a map up here I'd have a church in Akron Sheffield in the rain and each of us would be pillars holding up the Church of God amen amen there'd be a pillar here in Akron a pillar there in Sheffield Lorraine pillar over here in albia there's all these pillars and we're all holding up the truth of God's Word and think about when the rapture comes that's why jesus can allow the bombs to destroy America right the crater's because all these pillars are all taken away now there's no more house of God there's no more place of the Living God so he can pour out those vials right he can blow those trumpets through those message through the Ministry of the two prophets he can blow the trumpets and pour out the vials upon the earth because there's no more truth on the earth it's already been taken up and thank God that we believe the truth of God small number small church at night but we're great in God's eyes amen because we're holding up his truth hallelujah I'm not great like bragging but we're doing a great work we're doing the work of the gospel somewhere I'm not exalting myself or anyone else here we're not exalting ourselves but we are doing the work the Great Commission is what we're doing now verse 16 you know this and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness I remember before you read on he says I want you to behave in the house of God he just showed how a preacher has to meet all those qualifications a deacon has to meet those qualifications he wants you to be the pillar of God in truth he said without mystery or controversy that argument great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh so this is the mystery how do people become godly they become godly because God was manifest in the flesh in other words God became flesh to show us how to have godliness amen so we look at Jesus Christ we said that's godliness and that he was the mystery of godliness God was hiding himself in a man haha hey men and now that's the mystery of how we become godly look at the life of Jesus Christ see God manifest in the flesh he justified him in the spirit he was seen of angels he was preach to the Gentiles but lead on the world and received up into glory amen now that just struck me here just a moment Lydia can you switch over to my slides I wanted to preach this on Sunday I didn't get to it and since brother Aaron's here and everybody's listening I like to preach this thought here real quick I'm switching over I never got to these notes on Sunday since I won't be here Sunday I'm just gonna preach it now okay we sing a song in Christ alone it says the fullness of God and helpless babe but if you notice we change the lyrics because it wasn't the fullness of God in a baby right because God had not entered into the baby yet but his nature was God's nature it was a word nature the baby's body and mind and spirit was all the word nature but yet God spirit wasn't dwelling in the baby is everybody with me so I don't know brother Aaron has heard these quotes I want to bring I'm gonna read them to you just in case you haven't heard him I don't know so the song says fullness of God but we change in Christ alone who took on flesh fullness of God in helpless babe so we change it to the fullness of word because the Bible said in Colossians 1 that the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in Christ when did that phonus come it came at the River Jordan now were you aware that brother yes amen praise God hallelujah now here's the quote where he says it quite plainly it's pretty it's pretty pretty blood brother he was good at being blood which is good we like that he said look here Mary said your father and I have sought you for a day and night with tears she discredited her first testimony she called Joseph his father remember her first testimony is God is the father of this child and now she's saying Jesus your father and I have sought you with tears now look at this twelve-year-old boy not knowing what he said he was just a boy but he was the word see know ye not that I must be about my father's business see the word correcting the error didn't say God he said the word no look what he says next and the first time I read this and listen this I was about shocked for a couple of days she was given testimony after he was raised up it was all over now she said see your father and I have sought you going exactly what she said she hadn't conceived this child by the Holy Ghost then calling Joseph the father look what he says next and this little boy twelve-year-old child no wisdom at all I don't know if other man was exaggerating there or not but said Jesus had no wisdom at all why just a 12 year old boy the father didn't dwell in him at that time have you ever seen this quote before well good I thought so I thought when to make sure I read it while you were here but I may when I heard this this really did something for me it helped me to understand that God the spirit didn't come into Christ until he was thirty at the River Jordan because he come on the day when he baptized him he saw the Spirit of God coming down see and went in him but look this little twelve-year-old boy being the word he was born the Anointed One see to be anointed so when Jesus was born he wasn't anointed yet with the Spirit of God that didn't come to the dove flew down and rested on him and remained on him now does that help by God's grace cover I see that that's why he didn't do any miracles till he was after he was anointed he was just the word which now justice is probably not a good word to use but because we still respect the word he was only the word I'll say like that he was only the word and everything he said was the word the word he corrected his mom he corrected over it he was just the word he corrected those priests at the temple when he was 12 years old see but the father didn't dwell on him yet that didn't come to the day that John baptized him when the Holy Ghost came down so that's why I always tell people that you know Jesus had to receive the Holy Ghost because remember James and John's mother remember they asked Jesus she said let my two sons sit by you on your right and left hand you remember that Salome was it slow yes low and Jesus said you don't know what you're asking about he said can you be baptized with the baptism I'm baptized with what was he talking he said can you drink of the cup that I drink of so the baptism was the baptism the Holy Ghost right Jesus was saying I've been baptized with the Holy Ghost can you be baptized with the baptism and baptize men hey that's what we desire we need that baptism to go in the rapture amen see so see that that right there and just if you if you need to know paradox what it would awake what a perfect serving to preach that hidden paradox so that song is wrong the fullness of God wasn't in the babe the fullness of the word was in the babe because that's what that's what the Bible teaches that's what by the RAM talk now brother I have spent a lot of time showing the difference between the word and the spirit so I got some of the scriptures on that notice they've indicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell breech the souls in prison that's right his flesh only died and he raised up again and quickened it quicker means made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word so the word died for you not so the letter of the word in a sense died the but you can't kill God's Spirit we wouldn't live - I can't nobody nobody can kill God's Spirit you can crucify the effects of the spirit brother Branham says in the indictment sermon the other words you can just resist the Holy Spirit I don't want we're not going to obey the holy people can crucify the effects of the Holy Spirit but you cannot kill the Spirit of God it's eternal life amen so my man spends many many sermons and if you just if you just type in spirit and word and look out for 1965 he touches on it all the time I just brought a few out he said it's just like your body here see your body is dead without the spirit and so is the word of God debt without the Holy Ghost look wick in it we all know a lot of churches tonight are reading this but it's not quicken to them they'll see fathers and Holy Ghost hope let's go let's go dip them in let's go sprinkle the babies and polishin only goes and it's not quickened to him but if they ever got quickened they see I I'm gonna dog I need to repent and be buried in water in the literal name of Jesus Christ and our see the Holy Ghost that's the revelation behind it then it's quickened he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the dynamics in the word so the Spirit came in the body of the word that made the body of Jesus cold stiffened dead in the grave shaken to life and rise again I mean he just says it over and over again the body is waiting for which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm or make it alive that's what she is waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way he's talked about the bride of Jesus Christ see the bodies which is the word is waiting for the life so we're the body of Christ that we're waiting for the life the anointing the latter rain rapturing faith we're waiting for more life to come and quicken us in the rapture he was sinless by nature that's the only thing that could protect this sinless god word the word being God so Jesus had a word nature right so when you and I when we see half-naked women as brothers we feel that temptation right romance doesn't run down you but when Jesus saw instantly he look away because he was the word and and so when Jove said I made a covenant with my eyes not to look on a mate Jesus might see a prostitute and he'll just turn his head like that because you know Turner said he just he was the word but we might you know you know you know we've got a rest so well do i you know god help me yeah but Jesus he just did it he just it was the word when someone said something wrong he corrected it because he was the word he never compromised and said well you know that's my mom and it's okay for her to say that Joseph is my real dad it's okay she's my mom you know she's a mother she's the mother of God you know he didn't say they said no he said don't you know I'm about my father's business mom woman woman he just he was the word he corrected it and so we got to be able to be rerouted but let the Holy Spirit use us and help to correct other people and we've got to manifest the word as well so I just thought I'd share these I never got to preach these on Sunday cuz you know it's going on I appreciate hour and a half on Sunday see his sinless nature express God's mercy he was the word so God expressed himself by that sinless nature - he had a word nature and therefore this one was so perfect with the father just the body that was here called the son that the word was him and the word was made flesh he was a walk Jesus was a walking Bible amen onca we need to be cherished amen to the best of our ability we can't we can't be all of it but Jesus was all this word he was just a walk in Scripture everything he said got filtered through the thinking man's filter the Word of God he filtered everything right through the word the Feres we used to say something should we give our money you know - to God or should we give our money - to Herod and it filtered it through the words that give two heroines Herod give to God what is God's if filter right through the word and then they finally errand they got so they got so upset they said they stop asking me questions I give up I can't handle this word Hey because you'll never check the learning they're never deceived away because the words forever settled in heaven amen in the beginning was the word the words with God the Word was God this is God's thoughts amen you'll never trick the word and pretty soon they gave up as a fire and I'm not asking him anything else and that's how that's how they do it like you and I will witness the people I'm pretty certain if if we they can't get us they'll just give up now I'm done talking to Jesse I'm done talking to Aaron they just give up because it's the word they're arguing with and they know they're wrong because every man has a conscience amen and they know they're wrong if they can't defeat this word that's right I think I got a couple more oh yeah I think I'm close to this one brother have said Jesus's body yeah God changed his dwelling place from a throne in the head the spaces yonder to the heart of his son Jesus Christ to live and reign forever God was in Christ he's the final resting place of the Spirit so the kids asked me a Bible Club are we ever to see God and I say well in one sense yeah you're gonna see them in Christ you'll never see in the visible spirit but you'll see God manifest in the flesh in christ jesus' body is the final resting place of God I'm not wonderful when we get to heaven and we see the nail-scarred hands the nail-scarred feet we can just hold those hands and say God is always gonna be in this body hey I can always touch God right here of course we'll have perfect bodies as well by His grace but just comforting to know the final place of God is the body of Jesus Christ all right now and I never got to that I'm gonna find a give me ten minutes I'll get a place to close here I'll do 15 okay you can switch off Liddy I'm not gonna preach out there anymore well you know what you know what let's go back there go back to it yeah I wish I could rather summers coming up I can go a lot longer in the summer I want to just go over these quotes real quick here oh yeah let's look at this one this is good now is listen to Mary's belief I preached it on Sunday but at the very beginning the first paragraph I understood let's bow for a word of Prayer Lord we're grateful to have this privilege of coming in the house of God I believe was written I was happy when they said to me let us go to the house of Lord and we know no greater privilege that we have than to come to thy house and worship thee no greater privilege so see children we have to and I'm in this too we're all in this we can't we can't make coming to church is something that something common we always have to remember this is the greatest privilege of our life because this is God's house God's Word his ways in the sanctuary right we can't let we can't ever let that become a common thing although we're just going to church again tonight it's Wednesday night it's so beautiful out there boy I'd like to go out there into the park we have to go in the park at another time because this is our time to hear from our Heavenly Father like Adam and Eve before sin God would come down and walk with them brother Graham said and fellowship with them in the cool of the evening well that's what we're doing here tonight we're fellowshiping with jesus hallelujah there's no greater privilege than to come to the house of God now let me I want to go to the responsibility yeah let's let's just review this here I don't know how much I've read on this but let's look at a responsibility again here well grams talking about the brothers Collins and Hickerson have they have gifts of tongues interpretation he said that's not the ministry brother never let some your ministry to the church I'm giving us as an example then you brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as the pastor is interested in getting his because it's just essential that you do it so it is absolutely essential that we get our gifts in their position in the house of God this is why I was such a burden for the home church and for people to come to house of God in faith in prayer already anointed right with the anointing because it's essential it's absolutely necessary for us to come to the house of God anointed of God ready to come and do what God has called us to do I'm glad I came ready ons I'm glad you came ready all winds earlier on Sunday because people got delivered Amen hallelujah it's so important that we do that yeah and this is well this is what I want to see in everybody's heart I want to see everybody interested in finding my place in the house of God where does God want me like brother have said even if I'm the doorkeeper at the house of the Lord which is a deacon right well at least deacons Otto brother man said the Deacons ought to open the door and say can I take show you to the cloakroom can I show you where to hang up your jacket can I find you a seat to sit in because the Bible says that I rather be the doorkeeper at the house of Lord than to dwell in the tents of the wicked I'd rather just just open the door for God's people it's such a blessing to open the door and we need to find our position the house of God now that just came to my mind here a quote yeah let me this one here let me just read it this is one of the fees in church age brother Branham said this is a far cry from Paul who said that when all came together all had the leading of the Spirit and all participated in spiritual worship so Saint Paul said we should come to church in 1st Corinthians 14 26 let's read that liddie can you switch well yeah I'll just pull it I hate to do that but brother Graham quotes 1st Corinthians 14 26 let's just go there Bill Graham said everyone should come to church with a leading of the Holy Spirit alright we're getting to it oh boy it's so small there we go oh that's a little better is a little better all right no I already got highlighted okay I didn't actually prepare to do that but Paul says how is it then brethren when you come together every one of you hath the psalm so see some people are gonna come anointed to church with a song or a doctrine like Aaron and Hosea have shared good doctrines with me half a tongue hath a revelation half the interpretation that all things be done unto edifying so brother Branham says when all come together all had a leading of the Spirit and all participated in spiritual worship okay so everybody needs to be as interested as the pastor isn't getting ready for the service to have your gifts or your leading ready to go when you come to the house of God that's what brother Ram taught and that's why I think it's important that we teach that as well don't you don't you and so if if it's not there yet you know I'll be patient we'll all be patient but we want everybody to find you get to that place yes like we can see Amen he's kidding he's finding his place right you know he's being a blessing he's servant Mac I find this place you know Lydia's find a nice place back there everybody to find their place but this is where this is where we want everybody to be we want everybody to have like a revelation or and and edification something to build somebody up when they come to church a song a doctrine we want people to come to church with a leading of the Lord I just got this on my heart I just read this yesterday I just want to share this with you brother Aaron you know or something like that have a leading of the Lord cuz this is God's house this is where his ways here his truth is here his life is here Jesus is here amen amen now let me go back to the quotes here how's that now this is the one I read on Sunday brother have said a preacher can get the anointing but unless the congregation comes the same way it makes a difference congregation has to be ready to meet the Holy Spirit and then they'll weep their way to cut Christ amen and see you're just as a response woman and these ministers that's what I love about brother man's message it was a Bible message everybody is responsible for the service every person is just as important as me or Malachi or a Amen or brother harun or brother Jose anyone we're all equally responsible and important for the Holy Spirit to flow through the church everyone has a part and if all you can do is pray that's a great thing that's a great thing because prayer is what the most powerful weapon God ever gave to anybody remember there's going to day of reckoning the Bible actually calls your talents when God asks you about you what would you do with the talents I gave you the Jesus actually caught it a reckoning after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckon it with him we got a day of reckoning God's gonna say what did you do at Bride of Christ fellowship he's gonna ask me right he's gonna ask you he's gonna ask the girls in the what did you do at by the Christ Fellowship or if God calls you different Church what'd you do there what'd you do with the talents that I gave you I'm so glad I'll be able to say well I sang the best I could I studied him preached and prayed as hard as I could I did everything I could Lord I gave all that I had to you and each one of us should be able to say Lord if you gave me a revelation I gave I gave me the edification whatever you gave me the tongue or the the prayers casting out demons whatever gave me I gave all I could to it amen and then I liked it jesus said if you gain ten pounds you get ten cities that's a pretty good trade-off amen ten pounds if you did ten times though you've multiplied your gift ten times I'll give you ten cities five times five cities one time or two times two cities it's fair now look I like these quotes I've never read these before these are brand not welcome brand new to us you met you buy heard him though brother brands in Prescott Arizona at the end of his life and he hears children singing I hear these little boys voices these boys you could be like an Elvis Presley selling your birthright but see you don't want that see it's a talent God gave you so the girls keep singing specials it's a talent God gave you you believe that caris you believe that it's a talent little little boys little girls too talent God gave me see it's a talent and you've got to choose where you're gonna use that talent twofer God or whether you're gonna use it for the devil see he said brother Leo here now Leo ended up he ended up turning out to be a homosexual but he started out good brother Ram was up he was at they started a church in Arizona and they started out good but the RAM said they were doing good but after brother Branham died they got back slidden they turned to me a homosexuals it's been proven people have people have known them like you can ask sister Karen bro loris about that brother Leo now look this is why this is so striking to see now he this man who turned out to be a homosexual later he had a talent to come and lead the people now that to be that blows my mind now if that's the case then God every leader has a talent to lead people so brother leo brother Jesse brother Samuel for the Brooks for the camp all have a talent to lead people some have more than others now what's he gonna do with it now the sad thing is we know what he did with it they started a little compound out there in Arizona like a cult and then they're sort of getting all kinds of bad reports and pretty soon abuse rose up you can ask Karen Karen and Horace button and so we know what they did with their talents out there we know it was the wrong thing is he going into a business and make himself a meaner or should he come out here and make a home or people that wants to come together and get all you little children see you have to choose what going to do each of us has to make a choice and it's confronted to us we're all confronted with this one thing what are we gonna do about eternal life we're going to live here after or not then we have to come to Jesus to get that the opportunity of choosing that's one thing God gave to us he don't force something on us he just lets us make our own choice he have to not be forced but just make your own choice now I told you if I'd never told my what my I never knew I'd be a pastor brother I never do that my wife knows that you know I in high school I was never thought well I'm gonna be a spiritual preacher you know I'm gonna be a spiritual person I never thought that but I do know I was a leader in sports the the the I can show you the the news articles they called me I was the game they called me Jesse's gang so I was the leader on the team I was a captain and things like that so I can see well if you got a talent to lead people see that whole time when I was younger I had a talent to lead but I didn't know it was for God until I got here I see oh he's got me to lead the people of God amen because athletics dies no one cares records are broken it's nonsense it's useless even even though the Book of Psalms says or the Book of Proverbs says it's vain to trust in the legs of man you ever see that scripture those basketball players are trusting their legs to Duncan you know they they trust in their legs and God said it's vain to trust in the legs of man or the legs of horses you trust in the Living God amen see that's a talent and then rogram tells them about the story of the brother who said you've chose my way he said thou do this than by your own choosing you picked the most the correct and precise decision and it's my way but the God said it's your choosing you chose the right way brother Branham and so a huge portion of heaven awaits you see was it a 10-10 city portion I'd imagined my ram is at least ten cities right that's the most Jesus gave anybody in the parable so I imagine he had ten I know Paul has ten for sure because he said I labored more than all of them we know Paul had ten all right now let me just find a little one more thing to close on here I think there was a to get to here at the bottom of my notes bear with me let's say to our feet no that way I know how to close soon here yes sir yeah Luka Burnham says in light and their eye in the resurrection life he says your pastors supposed to be a righteous man he said the congregation is supposed to be with him 100% you're supposed to be just a hundred percent together and in there if you're not then Satan's got a way to get in you said you got a loophole some we're going to have everything cleared out see we got to be United as a pastor in the congregation we got to be so United you and I had to be just so interested in getting into our place in the house of God and coming to church with the leading I thought interested in that then you've got to be interested that too we all got to find the leading of the Holy Ghost for each service that's right and I think that's so important don't you I think it's extremely important yeah what I'll do is I'll just I think I know what it is it's the scripture about the pillar yeah I mentioned this a few weeks ago let's just close with that thought there's my 15 minutes revelation 3:12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he should go out go no more out and I'll write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I'll write upon him my new name so look at the reward of Christ now here's what I found striking David said I've got one desire to dwell in the house of God right all the days of my life so we if we're faithful to Jesus we actually get David's desire because not only are we in the house of God we're a pillar in the house of God amen which means we're right we're gonna be there the whole time we're not going anywhere we're part of that foundation the Bible says that in 1st Corinthians 3 we are part of the foundation with the Apostles in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the chief Cornerstone amen we are part of the pillar of the house of God so I love that dave was longing for that ah remember he's got a heart after the heart of God so what does God's heart God's heart is that I want to be with the case you forever I'm gonna make her a pillar in the house in my house right my heart God says I want Malachi to be in my house I want Liddy to be in my house all the days all the days of their life God said I'm gonna and David said I've got a heart after God's heart so David I want to be in the house of God I want to be where God's Word is I want to be we be where God's spirits pouring out all the time and that is the heart
