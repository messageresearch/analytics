TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Perhaps they're sick or perhaps uh you know the cares of life have come in. We've been preaching on the cares of life, you know, anxieties or cares of riches and so forth like that. Let's pray for everybody as well by God's grace. Let's read verse 12. Let's read that on three. 1 2 3. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Let's have one more word of prayer. Father God, we thank you for tonight. Lord, thank you for the saints who press their way out to the house of God. Bless your people, Lord. Feed them, Lord. They're your sheep. They're the sheep of your pasture, Lord God. And I'm just here as a earthly shepherd trying to get the mind of the spiritual great shepherd and feed your people tonight, Lord God. So just bless us with thy word. Thank you again for all the efforts that have been made to be here, especially our mothers and those that have worked all day, took days off, Lord God. We're so grateful for all these efforts. May the time be used uh uh in a wise way, Lord, in a a successful way. I ask it in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, "Amen." God bless you as you're being seated. Praise God. So, we look at part four here tonight. Now, I do have one slide in case you I was going to put this one up here. Um, I want to start with the quote that I ended with on uh Sunday morning. As I read this, hopefully you remember it. By God's grace, this is a beautiful quote. This is in the section where brother Ram talks about uh Jesus overcame and because he overcame, we can all overcome. So, how many understand you're in a wrestling match? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Satan would even attack and wrestle our sisters. Isn't that something? What a what a awful adversary. He'd even wrestle women. What a wicked man he is. What a wicked evil man spirit he is. But this is what we ended with. And u brother Ran told us that Jesus got the victory because he always obeyed the word of God. So it doesn't matter what we're tempted with. It matters are we going to use the word of God or not. So no matter what you fought this week, it doesn't matter. The word gives you the victory. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the last paragraph, I believe, in the quote, if I'm not mistaken, before he goes on to the next section in chapter nine. But let's just briefly, I just want to briefly review this real quick. Uh, there will not be one person who will sit in the throne of the Lord Jesus unless he has been living that word. Now, let me stop right there. Is David going to sit there? Yeah, David's going to sit there for sure. Uh, it did. Uh, but did David murder and did David commit adultery? &gt;&gt; Moses was a murderer. Is he gonna sit there? &gt;&gt; Yes. So, what I want you to see is that there's a spot for you at the throne, &gt;&gt; right? Despite our mistakes, there's a there's a there's a throne. There's a seat for you at the throne. &gt;&gt; Jesus has the main throne, but around him are the saints who will judge the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The saints will judge angels. The saints will judge the whole earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So just be be assured there's a seat for you. If you can overcome, there's a seat for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, your prayers, your fastings, your repentances. Now, these three I'm going to look at just again a little briefly. No matter what you present to God, none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting on that throne. But again, will David be there? Moses, all these people, Samson who made it to the Hall of Fame of faith &gt;&gt; despite uh uh giving in to immoral women uh despite all the the the disgrace he brought upon the nation of Israel and his family, we'd say, yet he's still in the Hall of Fame of faith &gt;&gt; because of repentance. Hallelujah. So other words, God received his repentance. But there are repentances God won't receive like Judas's because he didn't repent to the right person. But if you repent of Jesus, there's a seat for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It will be granted only to the word bride. And why are we here tonight, church? Because we all believe the same thing about the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only one baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Right? God's not three persons. God's one person. &gt;&gt; Women should dress modest. So should men. Women should have long hair. Men should have short hair. We all agree on that. Hallelujah. We're the word bride. Those are just a few examples out of the hundreds. Amen. As the throne of the king is shared with the queen, because she's united to him, so only they who are of that word, even as he is of that word will share that throne. Now, let's go over those examples. I ended with prayers. Muslims pray five times a day, probably more than you, right? Unless we're praying throughout the day in our hearts, right? But will Muslims sit on the throne with Jesus? No. They do. Did you know they deny that Jesus was even crucified? They believe Jesus was a prophet, but they believe he was resurrected and didn't die. He just went straight to heaven. They believe Allah took him to heaven. That's what the videos I've seen of at least of Muslims what they say. So they deny the blood of Jesus Christ. So how are they going to be saved? They can't be saved if they deny the blood of Jesus Christ. So no matter how much they pray, those prayers will not gain them a seat by the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what we're talking about. Now, another example I want to give you is a more recent example. There's a man named Mike Bickl, and he ran he ran You heard it, Brother Chris? Yes. In the 90s, he started a 247 prayer and song service. It goes 24 hours, seven days a week. And the leaders would, you know, they they they'd be like the song leaders. They would sing and pray for three-hour sessions. So, there's four groups and they would just rotate every day. And it's been going on for over 20, 30 years. Okay? Now, think about that. Now, that that that's the foundation. They can pray now, church. They're praying uh they're praying 247 at that church. But it just came out Mike Bickl has been abusing women for over 20 years. &gt;&gt; Yes, Mike Winger. He tore him up. Boy, he sure I appreciate him. Yes, I like him. Most things he does, not everything because he's against brother Ram, but we're against him in that way. &gt;&gt; You're right. Yes. Yeah. It's a great sacrifice. Yes. But the point I want to bring out of that is that although they were sincere, they were sincerely praying 24/7, yet for 20 years he would lie to the women. He'd say, "Oh, now here's how he lied. He say, "The Lord gave me a vision. My wife's going to die, so you're going to be in my next wife, so we might as well have time together now, and I'm not going to go far on that." Look at these demon-possessed people. Yet, he would get up there and pray, church, for three, he'd pray for three hours straight. So, see, as much as you pray and do all these things, that's not going to gain you a seat by Jesus. It's only those who live the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can pray five times a day. You can pray for three hours straight for for 30 years at a time. But if you don't live the word, there's no seat for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, fastings, as I said, the Pharisees fasted twice a week. They didn't eat all day from sun up to sun down. Which of us, don't raise your hand. Which of us have done that? But there'll be no seat for them because they denied Jesus Christ as savior. &gt;&gt; So, see, just fasting twice a week isn't enough to get you by the throne of Jesus Christ. You got to fast with the right heart &gt;&gt; and the right intentions. Hallelujah. And then the third one was repentance. Esau repented. We just read it at our house. We go through the book of went through Revelation. Now we're going through Genesis. He cried and said, "Dad, don't you have any other blessings for me?" And so he God, his dad did bless him. He did get a blessing. But after that, he went and lived worldly anyway and live wickedly, right? So even that it depends. As we said, it depends how you repent. Judas said, "I'm sorry." He got rid of the money, but he didn't repent to Jesus. He repented to the people he took the money from. Church, if we just repent to Jesus, there will be a seat for us in heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we repent the right way, if we fast the right way, if we pray the right way, we will reign with Jesus Christ because we re we're reigning right now over sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. Overcomers by the grace of God overcoming Leodysia. Okay. Okay. So, now does that help a little bit? I wanted to balance that out because some people look at that and they're like they might even myself over the years I've got sometimes I got discouraged reading that like my well then how am I going to ever how am I ever going to reign. But this is in the same section where Jesus overcame by quoting the word of God. So if we get the context, the context is you overcome over the whole span of your life. &gt;&gt; And as long as you're repenting, praying, and fasting the right way, there will be a seed for you. Hallelujah. Okay. So, you can click off that now. Just get some scriptures ready, hun. All right. Now, does that make sense? I hope that's a blessing. I wanted to I felt I had to end it, you know, kind of quickly on Well, maybe maybe not quickly, but I just I didn't I didn't know if everybody caught that thought. I wanted to just get that thought. Malachi mentioned on Sunday night. I thought, well, let me just uh spend a little more time on that by God's grace. Church, as I said, David's going to be there. Moses is going to be there. Samson's going to be there. The Queen of the South is going to be there. the men of Nineveh are going to be there and God's going to raise up the men of Nineveh because they got in in dust and and sackcloth and ashes and apologized to God and God spared their city. So if they're if they'll be there, we should be there by God's grace as well. But Chris, &gt;&gt; Queen of the South, okay, that's in the book of uh first kings when Solomon was king. The queen of south crossed the desert in order to see Solomon. And the Bible said she came to prove him with hard questions. &gt;&gt; We're not given the name. She's just called the queen of the south. And brother, she was ready. Uh, you know, all she knew is idols, right? So, she was ready. She heard about his wisdom and she thought, well, if if God's with him, I'm going to bring all this gold to bless him if it's truly God. And brother Bam said, Brother Bam said, apply that to us. If God shows us he's God, then we should support God's ministry with everything we got. Amen. And this and God has proved to me that this Bible revelation from William Brandham is the truth of God. &gt;&gt; So that's why I support it with all I got. And so do you. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah. That's why I support it with all I got." Good question, brother. Um Jesus talks about it as well. And brother, the whole point of her life was to to make a sacrifice on traveling. because she made a sacrifice to hear the word of God. She'll judge all those Pharisees who wouldn't even uh travel across the city to hear Jesus preach. She crossed an entire desert. They won't even cross the city. So, she'll judge them and they'll go to hell because they wouldn't cross the city to hear Jesus preach. So, Brother Chris and all of us, we got to look at what is the challenge in our lives to to serve God in the message. That's what we must accomplish because that's what God will use to judge other people. I got a feeling, uh, Sister Kristen, that God's going to use us to judge people that wouldn't have a church because it was so small. &gt;&gt; I got a feeling God's going to raise up my wife and I. When people make excuses, well, I couldn't live the message because the church would have been too small. Well, we put up with it. We serve God with a small church. We're willing to sacrifice. Or what about the people that said, "Oh, uh, we had to go on birth control pills and and all these babies lost their lives because we just didn't know if we could handle it financially." Who's God going to raise up? My wife and I. We believed it. We trusted God. Although things weren't easy for us financially all the time. Oh, I didn't have a big enough a big enough house to have more children. Uh, so we went on birth control pills and and God will raise up my wife and I. We don't have an extremely large house. Hallelujah. So look, look at the trials of your life. What what are the biggest trials? If you succeed in that trial, in giving God praise in that trial, God's going to use you as a testimony on the day of judgment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That you overcame. You didn't make excuses. Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't make excuses about, well, this is why I lost the wrestling match to Satan. This is why I let Satan wrestle me down and choke me out and I didn't live the word of God. There'll be no excuses. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; None. There are no excuses to why you can't overcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think uh because of time I will u I'll just get two more thoughts. Okay. Two more. Give me a short sermon tonight. Boy. People are sure going to share that on the they're going to share it on social media. Brother Jesse only preached 30 minutes. Oh my goodness, what's going on in his life? Come talk to me. I'll tell you. Uh I want to go to Psalm 51 verse one 1-2. Uh maybe I'll just get one thought. We'll see. Uh when Adam was here, he shared a few things that really struck me I want to bring out to the church regarding wrestling matches. So, if you haven't listen, if you want to listen to his full testimony, let me know. If you sisters haven't, I can share it with you. I shared it with a couple people. They really enjoyed it. Simon loved it. Simon's like, I shared it with numerous people. Simon really liked that testimony. Um, but the the this section, now in this section, I want to bring out this thought. Victory comes when we own our mistakes. In other words, you'll get the victory in wrestling if you just admit your mistakes. You know, some people say, "Well, I can't get the victory. I can't get the victory." And they blame everybody else. In other words, excuses. Okay, maybe that's the key word for tonight. Let's not make excuses. No excuses. &gt;&gt; If we lose a wrestling match, it's not somebody else's fault, it's our fault. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, in in Psalm 51, um this is the this is the song David wrote after he murdered and committed adultery and hid it from everybody. Not only did he murder and adultery, he hid it from everybody and God had to come and and send a prophet in order to make it known. In other words, he was comfortable living with hidden sin. Right? He was just planning, well, I'm just going to live the rest of my life. I'm not going to tell anybody about it. Right now, church, there's some things, right? There's some things we don't want to broadcast publicly, but we should admit them to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay? So what I'm saying is let's hope when we sin it's just between us and God and we don't have to deal with any public consequences. Okay? But there's nothing wrong with hiding your sin if you've already confessed it, right? Hide your sin if it was just between you and God. Hide it, but confess it to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then then the guilt goes away. Then the shame goes away. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Okay. Have mercy on upon me, oh God, according to thy loving kindness, according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out mine. Okay, leave it up there. Mine. Whose transgressions were they? Mine. So, Adam got victory when he realized, wow, this is these this trouble with drugs and any sexual sin. This is my fault. &gt;&gt; Now, church, he could have been tempted to say, well, this is my dad's fault because I got divorced. my dad divorced my mom. We could have said, "Well, maybe I I just didn't get the love for my mom or the love for my dad." There's no excuses for our sin. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. Verse two. Wash me thoroughly from whose iniquity was it? &gt;&gt; Mine. Hallelujah. And cleanse me from whose sin? My sin. Okay. So, see, he's taking ownership. This is my iniquity. This is my sin. It's not somebody else's. I'm not pointing any fingers. Oh, it's Bashibba's fault. She should not have been bathing or whatever she was doing. Who knows what she was doing, church? We don't even know. Somehow there's something with bathing out in public. And isn't that like men sometimes men just want to blame women, right? Because they're the weaker vessel. Shame on a man that would do that. You won't be blaming anybody on the day of judgment. Just yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can't blame anybody else. You know, I need to find this verse. But in the Old Testament, in Jeremiah, it said God gave the people false teachers because of their own sin. In other words, a false teacher is a reward to a a congregation that doesn't love the word of God. So then what's a real preacher then? Well, I thought I'd get a more than one amen on that. &gt;&gt; Then what's a faithful faithful preacher? And that's a reward because you love the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's better. I know it's Wednesday night. Hallelujah. Thank God. I want to be a faithful minister. I want you to be a faithful church. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's wrestle against the Satan. Let's beat him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's choke him out, not him choke us out. &gt;&gt; And Adam kept saying these words, remember Chris, selfishness. It was my selfishness. And that's true for all of us. Genevie wrote me a letter and said, "Oh, Daddy, I just pray uh I just pray for you that you won't get choked out and I won't get choked out." I thought that meant a lot to me. Genevie, you keep praying for me, Genevie, that I don't get choked out. Hallelujah. And I keep wrestling against Satan and throw him down in Jesus name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, see, that's owning. When you own your sin, it's you say, "Yes, it's my sin. It was my selfishness. It was my pride. It was my lust. It was my arrogance. It was my fear. It was my unbelief. It was my distraction. Don't blame other people if it's your fault. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so that's how Adam got the victory through his wrestling match. He had to own the sin. Okay. Now, the prodigal son, Luke 15:18. Chris and I were talking about this one after service on Sunday. And I want to say I appreciate everybody leaving here quietly because I said leave here quietly. There's people praying in here. I appreciate everybody doing. Thank you, children. There's tithes. Everybody's happy. No one's no one's at the altar. We can shake hands, say, "I sure love you, brother May." Okay. Brother Chris, I love you. I love you, Jose. But if somebody's praying, we need to get out of the sanctuary if we're not going to pray for them. Okay? Keep the anointing of the Holy Ghost in the building. Everybody understand by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Most time we do a wonderful job of that. You can hear it on brother's tapes, too. Sometimes if it's a real sincerious service, he's like, "Exit right away." If not, he say he says, "Shake each one another's hand. Greet one another by the grace of God." Luke 15:18. Now, the prodigal is in the most abominable place he could be with pigs. Pigs were an abomination to Jews, right? In other words, he's in the dirtiest place he could be. How does he get the victory out of this wrestling match? He's getting whipped in his wrestling match. Satan has thrown him in abomination. It'd be like a woman today wearing pants, right, in in adultery or fornication or something like that. or a man uh in a bar or a man uh sleeping around with a bunch of women like a whoremonger. It'd be like that in abominable condition wearing shorts and watching porn and doing all kinds of wickedness like that. It'd be like that today. Something really wicked. And how does he get victory? How does he win the wrestling match? How does he get strength? He owns it. &gt;&gt; See that? He doesn't blame other people for his mistake. He recognized it's my mistake. I will arise and go to my father. And I was saying to my father, uh, it's all your fault. Did I read that right? &gt;&gt; No, he don't blame his daddy. He don't blame his mama. He blames himself. &gt;&gt; May God help us. If we sin, help us to blame ourselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how you get the victory in the wrestling match. Blame who's guilty. You're guilty. I'm guilty. When we sin, we're all guilty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Appreciate That amen corner there, sisters. Hallelujah. That's a healthy amen right there. I have sinned against heaven and before thee. Notice, I've sinned against God and heaven. I sinned against the kingdom of God and I've sinned against God. I'm sorry, my father. Yes. I've sinned against heaven and I've sinned against my dad. Next verse. And am no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired servants. Now look at this. I'm unw Look at that. I'm unworthy, church. So, brother Chris, this is how I was trying to teach you how to pray. We got to pray and say, "God, I'm unworthy." Sometimes I repeat that, "I'm unworthy. I'm unworthy. I'm nothing. I'm nothing. I'm nothing." And it brings humility to myself. Realize I am nothing. &gt;&gt; If God terries, I'm going to have a funeral, too, like everybody else. &gt;&gt; So, I want to realize I'm nothing, and I want to have faith in God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to take the blame upon myself if it's my sin. I want to own the sin and I want to ask God to forgive me of my sin. &gt;&gt; See, I'm not worthy, but in other words, I'm not worthy, but take me in. Let me have whatever position I can have in the kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether I'm whether I'm the last seat away from the throne. Even if I'm the last seat, let me sit beside you, Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy, but I want at least the least seat. Could I just have the least seat? I want to come home. I want to be forgiven. I need your love, God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, that's how you do it. I've sinned against you. I've sinned against heaven. I'm not worthy of this, but I still want to be accepted somehow. I still want to make it in the rapture. There it is. I still want to make it to heaven. Amen. God, make a way. I recognize I own my sin, but receive me back if there's a way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And church, there is a way because Jesus is the way. &gt;&gt; Glory. Verse 20. And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a far way off, his father saw him and he had compassion, ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. This is the God we serve. God has compassion on us. God can't wait for us to get the wrestling victory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is everybody hearing me? &gt;&gt; God cannot wait. He's waiting. I can't wait till brother gets a victory. I can't wait till sister finally takes the word of God and gets the victory. &gt;&gt; He can't wait. And I'll say like this. He can't wait whether you come up for prayer or he can't wait till you confess at your chair or he can't wait till you go and make that right with somebody. He can't wait. He He's looking for it. He believe. He knows it's going to happen. And then church, look what he does. He's going to do exceedingly abundantly for you more than you can ask or think. In other words, if you can just repent and take ownership of your sin, God's going to reward you in ways you can't imagine. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Verse 21. And the son said unto him, "Father, I've sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, am no more worthy be called thy son." Verse 22. But the father said to his servants, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet." We'll stop right there. The church said, So David owned it. The prodigal owned it, right? And David got a great blessing, too. God gave the covenant. Your seed will always have a king that sits on the throne. Right? What's he get? He gets the robe. He gets the ring. He gets the authority. He gets a new clothes, which is the righteousness of Jesus Christ. As we saw on Sunday with the the armor of God, the breastplate is the righteousness. Uh and then the Bible said the white robe like robe like fine linen is the righteousness of Jesus Christ. So we see the spiritual connection. Oh yeah. And brother Kirsty talked about this in this story is the three works of grace. The first work is when he repented in the pig pen. He got a change of mind. &gt;&gt; The second work is walking back to daddy's house. &gt;&gt; The third work put a ring on him. Put a robe on him. Give him authority. He's a new man. Hallelujah. Three works of grace. Hallelujah. Amen. You remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that came to me while we were talking, brother. Either you or Austin, I can't remember. I was like, that's right. There are three works in there. Pig pen, travel, re reception with his father. Now, I'll just have to close this going. I'm just going to close with this thought here in the next few minutes. Brother Adam said he had to own his sin. So Adam's he said it in that uh rehab place and he said that remember he said that man walked by him the preacher walked by him that day and the hair sit up on his his arms. I said Adam what was it about that service that blessed you? And he said that preacher preached you got to own your sin. And that preacher said, "All you men in here, your wives are going to be uh alone or with another man, and it's your fault." Now, that's a sermon right there. Yeah. He's saying, "You got to own it." And then he said, Adam, the thing that hit Adam, he said, "Uh, you've got to own it. Your children, if you got children out there, someone else is going to raise them and it's your fault." In other words, you've got to own it. And so he went up for prayer. Adam said he just laid hands on him and he said he felt like God pulled that addiction of crack and cocaine. Pulled it right out of him. Hallelujah. Absolutely. A demon was cast out and the church said &gt;&gt; and he said instantly he had didn't have that desire anymore. Right. But then the devil tries to attack him. You know we all get we all go through seasons of of temptation like that. But that was the sermon that brought it down where the rubber meets the road. It's my fault. Everything's my fault. It's not other people's fault. I'm gonna stop blaming the devil. &gt;&gt; The devil's going to be there no matter what. &gt;&gt; Right? The devil can't make you do anything. &gt;&gt; The reality is when we sin, we give in to the devil, &gt;&gt; right? He can't make you do anything. You do it, you sin because you want to sin. &gt;&gt; And let me say it like this, church. You can't blame the government &gt;&gt; for why life is so hard. You cannot blame them. &gt;&gt; Governments have been a lot worse than our government. Now, we got a good We got a good president now with a good cabinet. It's true. Much better. I mean, good in good is uh just a general word there, you know. It's better than what it was. Not wholly good, but better. But you can't blame you you can't blame the economy. Well, because I don't have money, I'm going to go do this sin and that sin and that sin. No, you can't blame the economy either. &gt;&gt; The devil can't make you do it. The economy, the government, you can't blame, well, that woman dressed that way, so I had to do it. Or that man was just so handsome. He had those beautiful blue eyes and whatever he had, I just had to go out on a date with him. &gt;&gt; No. No. You can't blame anybody else. You got to blame yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz you're the only one wrestling. &gt;&gt; You're not wrestling that handsome guy. &gt;&gt; You're not wrestling that attractive woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're wrestling an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; And let me share this. I heard brother Ram say this today just in passing. Brother Ram said there's some spirits that look like a bat. Right? We saw that in Revelation. She said he said uh which one looks like a turtle? um ep epilepsy. He said epilepsy looks like a turtle. He said, "But oppression, listen, looks like a cloud of waves." So when a when a person is oppressed by the devil, it's like they're covered with a dark cloud and the cloud moves in like waves, right? So see, sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm down. It comes in and out, right? So if if we are oppressed, in other words, oppression is we're constantly losing the wrestling match. If we're oppressed, we got to say, "God, deliver me from this cloud over my life." &gt;&gt; And you've got to wrestle that cloud away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do you wrestle with the word of God? &gt;&gt; Now, I'm closing with this thought because I only got a couple minutes here. How much time on the live stream so far? 29 minutes. Oh my goodness. How is this possible? Hallelujah. I'm closing with this thought here. There will be no excuses for losing your wrestling match. Now, if you and I went to a wrestling match, there could be excuses somebody could lose. Like they got hurt, right? Let's see. They broke an ankle. That's why I lost. But church, in God's wrestling match, there's no excuses. Uh Romans 1 says there'll be no excuses, right? They are without excuse, the Bible says. So there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment. In other words, God doesn't send you out to wrestle injured. &gt;&gt; He sends you out to wrestle. You have perfect health and he gives you all six defenses and weapons that you need to do it. &gt;&gt; You just got to put them on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let me share this here. This is the thought I want to bring. Beyond any shadow of doubt, you and I should win the wrestling match with evil spirits because we have been equipped to do so. And we are promised that we have greater power than any evil spirit that we will ever wrestle against. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For time's sake. First John 4:4. Let's all read that. Ready? One, two, three. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world. If if we're wrestling Satan today, none of us can say, "Well, God, you didn't make you didn't give me enough power to overcome." The Bible said, "Greater is he that's in you." Greater is the word that's within you than any other demon you could wrestle. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Uh 1 Corinthians 10:13. 1 Corinthians 10:13. There is no temptation taken you, but with such is common to man. In other words, whatever you're wrestling with, someone's already wrestled it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This ain't something new. Someone's already wrestled this. Someone's already overcame. So, you can overcome. &gt;&gt; And God is faithful. who will not suffer to be tempted above that you're able, but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it. In other words, God's never going to send an uh God's never going to let you wrestle an enemy you can't beat up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'd be like Malachi. It'd be like Malachi taekwond do if they have like a little 10-year-old up against Malachi. Malachi's like 18 like But what would you say if Malachi got whipped by that little 10-year-old? You say you're an underachiever, right? How did this happen? Right? But we know Matt wouldn't happen to Malachi. He'd be like over. Oh, yeah. He'd go like this. Now, of course, he wouldn't do it to a child, but you understand the spiritual the spiritual symbol. So, other words, that that's what you and I when we wrestle the devil, that's what it's like. It's like Malachi against a little 10-year-old or something like that because greater is he that's in us. It's not us. It's God that's in us that's greater. &gt;&gt; God will not send you a wrestling match. You can't win. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the only way that we lose is because we want to lose and we underachieved rather than achieving what we could have done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everyone understand? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh John 10:28, this will encourage you. 28 and 29. John 10:28 29. This will bless you, I'm sure. And I give unto them, what does God give unto us? Eternal life. And they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. Is any is any wrestler ever going to be able to take you out of the the truth of God's word? No. It's impossible.
