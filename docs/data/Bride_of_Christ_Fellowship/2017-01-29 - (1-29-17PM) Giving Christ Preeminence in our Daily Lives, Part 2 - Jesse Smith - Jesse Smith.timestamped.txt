[14:22] yeah God bless it get a quick testimony
[14:27] um I had a Bible really really long time
[14:30] ago and it was really dead so I get a
[14:32] second Bible but I wasn't taking good
[14:36] care of it all the most of the tab is
[14:38] off which means part of the scripture is
[14:40] being ripped off from it too so I needed
[14:44] to replace my
[14:45] Bible I've been looking around for a
[14:48] long time and you get used to your Bible
[14:51] so you really just want the same Bible
[14:54] um after months of searching I couldn't
[14:56] find anything I finally Tuesday I went
[14:59] to the bookstore and got a Bible and I
[15:03] was like okay I guess this is going to
[15:05] be my Bible and I about the tap and
[15:07] everything I'm like okay I'm going to be
[15:09] serious I'm going to start using it but
[15:11] while I got home after Tuesday um I was
[15:15] just in my heart I'm like Lord I really
[15:18] want my same
[15:20] Bible and I walk right to my bookshelf
[15:23] and open the package and there was the
[15:27] exact same Bible that
[15:30] so I actually bed like an extra one but
[15:34] but then like for me it was awesome
[15:36] because it was not a coincident because
[15:38] the very second that when my heart I'm
[15:40] like I really wanted it and God blessed
[15:43] me with it so I want thanks so praise
[15:48] God this is my
[15:52] desire
[15:55] to you

[20:15] holyy name praise God let's take our
[20:18] Bibles let's stand on our feet here
[20:19] tonight by God's
[20:23] grace I think what I'll do is I'll just
[20:25] we'll continue with the preeminence in
[20:26] our daily lives I think I might as well
[20:28] I just want to finish this and then Lord
[20:30] willing we'll move on to um maybe back
[20:33] to the church age book on uh Wednesday
[20:35] night by the grace of the Lord I've
[20:38] surely been enjoying that church age
[20:39] book my just what a what a time reading
[20:42] through it you know slowly reading
[20:44] through a book over and over again
[20:45] really pulling a lot out of it but uh
[20:48] tonight I think I'll I'll finish this
[20:50] because I only have about you know 30 or
[20:52] some slides and it'd be great to finish
[20:54] this thought here so for our text I kind
[20:57] of want to um go to Romans 14 uh because
[21:00] we're be dealing with the technology
[21:02] part he kept hitting on technology you
[21:03] know and Facebook and stuff so I want to
[21:06] go back over this again a little bit by
[21:08] God's
[21:10] grace it's helped me you know and I'll
[21:12] share a little bit about my my testimony
[21:15] to and just you know how you try to stay
[21:17] on top of things you
[21:19] know um you try to stay try to keep
[21:21] everything in a subjection to the word
[21:23] of God and we're all constantly EMB
[21:25] battling that balance you know so Romans
[21:28] 1419 let's read 141 19 20 and 21 we'll
[21:33] read those three
[21:34] scriptures
[21:37] um this will just get this just gives us
[21:39] you know uh the scripture about we need
[21:41] to focus on building people up and not
[21:44] offending people once be like I was
[21:47] telling brother Austin you know uh once
[21:48] we become Christians you know once we
[21:51] fight off all the Demons of of Our Lives
[21:52] then we get in church and then Satan
[21:54] tries to make us have wars in the church
[21:56] first we're fighting everybody outside
[21:58] the church just to get saved right get
[22:00] in the church and then once you're in
[22:01] the church you got to love everybody in
[22:03] the church remember God won't let you
[22:05] into his family until first you got
[22:07] brotherly kindness to treat his his
[22:09] family the right way because brotherly
[22:10] kindness is the last step before charity
[22:12] so you got to treat the body right as
[22:15] your brothers and sisters and then he
[22:16] gives you charity when he can trust you
[22:18] with that so Romans 14 uh 1920 and 21
[22:22] and if you haven't listened to brother
[22:23] gab's message I think you'll really be
[22:25] blessed by it um
[22:28] Romans 14:19 if you're there say amen
[22:31] amen let us therefore follow after the
[22:33] things which make for peace and things
[22:36] where with one may edify that means
[22:38] build up or strengthen another for meat
[22:42] destroy not the work of God all things
[22:45] are in need pure they're dealing with
[22:46] Christians who would eat meat and
[22:48] someone but is evil for that man who
[22:50] eateth with
[22:52] offense so when you make somebody weak
[22:54] or offend them because of what you're
[22:56] doing in your freedom and liberty in
[22:57] Christ it's evil that's sin when you
[23:00] cause somebody to
[23:01] stumble it is good neither to eat flesh
[23:04] nor to drink wine nor anything so he
[23:07] says anything at all anything whereby
[23:09] thy brother stumbleth or is offended or
[23:13] is made weak verse 22 hast thou Faith
[23:17] have it to thyself before God happy is
[23:21] he that condemneth not himself in that
[23:23] thing which he alloweth so don't
[23:26] purposely do something if you're
[23:27] condemned on the inside
[23:29] don't condemn yourself you know don't
[23:30] don't try to do something and you feel
[23:32] condemned already verse 23 and he that
[23:35] douth is damned if he eat so if you have
[23:37] any doubt or any condemnation don't do
[23:39] it because he eateth not of faith for
[23:42] whatsoever is not of faith is what sin
[23:45] we must have faith or a revelation as
[23:48] substance that we feel we're doing the
[23:50] right thing at all times and I want to
[23:53] apply that of course I'm I'm going to
[23:54] start with family then go to technology
[23:56] and complacency he end kind of ended
[23:58] with complacency and I want to uh look
[24:00] at that just a little bit by God's grace
[24:02] here tonight so let's bow our heads you
[24:04] have a need on your heart just make it
[24:05] know unto God as we get into the word of
[24:07] God Heavenly Father we're here to become
[24:10] better Christians we're here to see our
[24:11] weak spots our faults Lord I just pray
[24:14] you'd help us Lord God help me to be a
[24:17] humble servant Lord help me to be your
[24:18] true servant help me to be a vessel that
[24:21] you can use to speak to your children
[24:22] may the the Saints here the congregation
[24:25] Lord Feast on the word may they uh be
[24:28] fed Lord may they pull from your gifts
[24:32] and your spirit to receive what they
[24:33] have need of may we come here to focus
[24:35] on bettering ourselves Lord God how can
[24:39] we be better Christians help us Lord I
[24:41] pray and just help me to be a true
[24:43] servant in Jesus Christ's name and the
[24:45] church said amen God bless you being
[24:47] seated here I want to start with um like
[24:49] I said family then I'll work my way into
[24:51] uh technology and then um I want to
[24:54] close with that complacency and I think
[24:56] it'll be an hour let me set a timer here
[24:58] so I I I don't go over I can hard tell
[25:00] my throat's hurting already but uh
[25:03] praise the lord it's it's worth it
[25:05] brother Ram said you know that's all we
[25:06] can dedicate to God you know we we'll be
[25:08] happy with that I'll give my voice to
[25:11] God so uh let's let's uh look at some
[25:14] quotes from Ali whenever you're ready
[25:15] buddy we can switch over and get some
[25:17] scriptures up here by God's
[25:20] grace so I want to go back to the family
[25:23] and
[25:24] uh and I just want to read those
[25:26] quotations that we didn't get to
[25:29] um great let's do this here and
[25:33] uh we read about sister Rebecca brandom
[25:37] bless your soul uh let's start with
[25:42] um this did we get to this okay yeah we
[25:44] got to that all right let's start with
[25:46] that apron profit and uh and again this
[25:49] encourages you know the husbands to take
[25:50] an active role in the home you know I
[25:52] know numerous men that they don't do one
[25:54] thing at home you know and they they
[25:56] don't have to uh by
[25:59] scripture uh but I think they ought to
[26:02] at times you know they ought to just
[26:03] like brother Brandon so let's look at
[26:05] this here and then we'll get into the
[26:06] little more on the children and then um
[26:09] look at the
[26:11] technology so brother Bram said there
[26:13] was some raging Maniacs outside of his
[26:15] house at when at this particular time
[26:17] when before he put the apron on there
[26:18] was raging Maniacs ever ever meet a
[26:20] raging
[26:22] Maniac but they hung around brother

[26:33] saying the Lord said this the Lord said
[26:35] if I ain't your manager the Lord said
[26:37] this now if the Lord wouldn't talk to me
[26:39] about that if he had something to say

[27:42] trying to be spiritual and the children
[27:44] are playing he said later says Joseph's
[27:46] banging so loud on the the drums they
[27:48] can't hear nothing you
[27:49] know and I thought now if I can just get
[27:52] her quiet speaking of his wife so I said
[27:54] Sweetheart would you rush out with me
[27:56] for dinner oh I'd have to clean up for
[27:58] the children this and that and you could
[28:00] hardly hear yourself thinking little

[28:10] began to help her and I said honey you

[28:59] that's where we want to get to right in
[29:01] the midst of all the noise in the midst

[29:14] woman so he's kind of laying hands on
[29:16] her praying and just kept on you know
[29:19] what was I doing I was projecting or
[29:21] creating a different atmosphere walk in
[29:23] the love of God have
[29:26] Fellowship I've done this in my
[29:28] classroom I've walked into my classroom
[29:29] at indoor recess and they're all loud
[29:30] and everything like that and the
[29:32] children will run up to me and say well
[29:33] so and so did this so and so and the
[29:36] Bible said if you have a soft answer it
[29:38] turns away wrath and I can feel it and
[29:40] I'm walking in the spirit I can feel
[29:42] when I start answering nicely back you
[29:44] can feel the whole atmosphere of the
[29:46] class change and all those recess
[29:47] monitors come to me and say these
[29:49] children in this school are pretty
[29:51] pretty loud but your classroom is
[29:53] different Mr
[29:54] Smith now not always you know because
[29:56] I'm human too but I know for a fact when
[29:59] I'm in there and I'm walking the spirit
[30:01] and I'm projecting Divine love and I'm
[30:04] and I'm praying in my heart help these
[30:05] children to not tattle on each other so
[30:07] much Lord help them just to be diligent
[30:11] workers I can feel it it's an atmosphere
[30:14] and so we got to bring that to the home
[30:16] now let me tell on myself a little bit I
[30:18] would say this just just so you know I'm
[30:20] a man I'm I'm a man like everybody my
[30:22] biggest weakness at home is I get tired
[30:24] at home and I get kind of cranky and
[30:26] just I get quiet because I and my watch
[30:30] will tell you too I burn a lot of
[30:32] calories on Sunday I stand up a lot of
[30:34] hours on Sunday I almost have very
[30:36] little and then I work all day
[30:38] Monday and so when I get home Monday I
[30:41] get to the table I'm just sometimes
[30:42] happy just to get to the
[30:44] table and eat supper and so I that's one
[30:48] of my biggest weaknesses I I pour out
[30:50] myself so much on Saturday studying I'm
[30:52] here at the church praying reading you
[30:54] studying and then Sunday give it all out
[30:56] and Monday I work and like I said Monday
[30:58] Tuesday I need God's grace on those days
[31:00] and I appreciate your prayers but let me
[31:02] tell you that's one of my biggest
[31:03] weaknesses and that's what I told you
[31:05] this morning I want to be more connected
[31:07] to my children I love them I try to live
[31:09] a Godly life for them I try to give them
[31:11] gifts and take them out to eat and give
[31:13] them sugar treats and you know I try to
[31:14] just show them as much love as I can I
[31:16] hug them and kiss them every night but
[31:18] one thing I could work on is
[31:21] this when I'm tired to still create a
[31:23] loving atmosphere instead of being short
[31:26] with my children or my wife says
[31:27] sometimes you know we've talked about
[31:28] over the years when I get tired and
[31:30] cranky if I'm not careful I get cranky I
[31:32] get short with people well with my own
[31:34] children my own family that's where
[31:35] brother Jesse needs God's grace because
[31:38] I save up all my energy to preach and
[31:40] serve God and love God and I love my
[31:41] family but if I'm not careful I'll let
[31:44] that tiredness uh have preeminence and I
[31:48] gotta let the Holy Spirit have
[31:50] preeminence even when I'm tired so I
[31:52] hope you understand that I'm telling on
[31:53] myself today I'm just a man I need God's
[31:56] grace too and I can see areas where I I
[31:58] need goals I need to set a more a better
[32:00] desire to really try to live above my
[32:03] tiredness or maybe rest more whatever
[32:05] you know whatever I got to do uh that's
[32:08] what I got to do by the grace of the
[32:10] Lord so let me tell I'm gonna tell
[32:12] myself a few more times tonight if
[32:13] that's okay uh so you know I'm human
[32:15] brother Braham did it and that's why we
[32:17] love brother Braham so much is because
[32:18] he was he showed us he was just a man
[32:20] right you know we could relate to him we
[32:21] can like here we can understand he was
[32:23] tired he didn't want to do it but he
[32:25] still did it anyway and a few moments
[32:28] she got quiet and then when she got
[32:29] quiet Sarah and Becky divide up the play
[32:32] blocks Joseph got him something to play
[32:33] with and there was peace in the
[32:36] home what was it projecting love they
[32:38] were mine my children my wife and I was
[32:41] God look what he says I was God coming
[32:45] what anointed by God to change the
[32:47] atmosphere and then God giving his
[32:49] spirit and through that spirit with love
[32:51] to my family Sovereign Grace come in and
[32:53] quiet the family it'll do it I know it
[32:56] will and now this app applies to
[32:58] everywhere this applies to the church
[32:59] the Holy Spirit can bring peace to the
[33:01] church right in the service the Holy
[33:02] Spirit can bring peace on the job to
[33:04] your home wherever you know your
[33:06] personal life that's what we need the
[33:07] holy spirit for praise God to change the
[33:10] atmosphere all
[33:12] [Music]
[33:13] right and it will always do that it will
[33:16] always change the atmosphere if we can
[33:18] just get in tune with the Holy Spirit
[33:20] and I I found this even yesterday when I
[33:22] was you know had a Bible study I could
[33:24] feel the atmosphere I started just
[33:26] talking about Jesus and pretty soon I
[33:27] start crying and praising the Lord and
[33:28] testifying to different one you know
[33:31] yesterday at Denny's like I was telling
[33:32] you it was a real wonderful time and
[33:34] just praising the Lord and I just could
[33:35] feel the atmosphere changed you know it
[33:37] was really special and uh we don't try
[33:41] we're not like planning to do that but
[33:42] we need to be aware of that you know
[33:43] what I mean we need to be aware that
[33:45] okay when we see this is getting little
[33:46] worldly let's bring it back to Christ
[33:48] it's getting little In the Flesh let's
[33:50] get back to the Holy Spirit somebody
[33:52] change the atmosphere somebody give a
[33:53] testimony somebody start praising the
[33:55] Lord somebody start talking about Jesus
[33:57] you know somebody start talking about
[33:58] the sermon the song special or something
[34:00] like that and God will help us to do
[34:02] that now that works in our home like I
[34:04] said works at the church works
[34:06] everywhere and remember this I'm just
[34:08] going to read this now does that black
[34:11] okay let me read this first but he that
[34:12] is greatest among you shall be your
[34:14] servant so look what he did Brother bam
[34:15] comes in to be the servant all right
[34:19] he's tired he he's not really required
[34:21] by scripture to keep the
[34:23] home his wife is but he sees a need and
[34:26] he can change that atmosphere
[34:28] all right and uh now look what does he
[34:31] become he becomes a servant and that's
[34:33] what we can do here we can serve here we
[34:35] can serve at the home but we want to
[34:37] serve God's people praise God now just I
[34:39] got a quick question this is that red on
[34:41] black does that offend people at all is
[34:43] that
[34:44] okay it's okay all right yeah it doesn't
[34:47] bother me but my wife said you know like
[34:48] in art that's really bad to put red on
[34:50] black because it's like a bull or
[34:52] something you know like it's like it's
[34:54] like red light is that right brother Lis
[34:56] does it bother you brother
[34:58] okay because I can go to allh if you
[35:00] want I just thought I'd asked because my
[35:02] wife tells me that uh but getting back
[35:06] to this these are redl words and we
[35:08] should say God how can I serve my family
[35:11] better how can I serve the church better
[35:13] how can I serve so and so better how
[35:15] many want to be servants the greatest
[35:18] among you will be the servant now it's
[35:20] not a competition to be the greatest but
[35:22] we should have the humility and say Lord
[35:24] I really want to
[35:25] serve remember serving is not doing what
[35:28] you want to do it's doing what someone
[35:29] else wants to do humble thyself in the
[35:31] sight of the Lord he'll lift you up but
[35:33] see brother Ram did that now that's the
[35:34] example for family now Bible wisdom for
[35:37] parenting I just want to go over this I
[35:39] may preach a little more on this uh but
[35:41] remember uh we must chasten he that
[35:43] spareth his Rod hateth his son he that
[35:45] loveth him chasteneth him be time so
[35:48] earnestly swiftly diligently early we
[35:52] got to early uh discipline our children
[35:55] and chasen them
[35:58] and then we read this one because
[35:59] sentence against an evil work is not
[36:01] executed speedily therefore the heart of
[36:03] the sons of men is fully set in them to
[36:05] do
[36:07] evil uh foolishness is bound in the
[36:09] heart of a child but the rod of
[36:11] Correction shall drive it far from him
[36:14] the rod and reproof give wisdom look at
[36:16] that a rod gives
[36:18] wisdom right now I don't have the
[36:21] scriptures up here but I preached
[36:23] on um I preached on how the the brain is
[36:26] transformed
[36:29] uh two years ago I preached on that in
[36:31] 2015 and I'll just try to summarize
[36:33] it um before you make decisions all
[36:37] decisions are made from your frontal
[36:39] cortex right your human Spirit right
[36:41] here it's right behind your forehead
[36:42] that's why the Bible said when it's when
[36:44] you get filled with the holy spirit it's
[36:45] like he's putting a mark on
[36:47] your the the part of your brain that's
[36:50] for judgment and decision making okay
[36:53] um but what happens is there's a little
[36:56] waiting period I forget the name of the
[36:57] I think it's hypothalamus if I'm I'm not
[36:59] mistaken there's a little waiting period
[37:00] there in your brain before you make the
[37:02] final
[37:03] decision okay uh but when but when pain
[37:06] is
[37:07] involved uh uh and when uh when
[37:10] correction is brought with pain a new a
[37:13] new pathway forms in your brain I'm just
[37:15] gonna kind of very very I'm just gonna
[37:17] summarize it very much because I don't I
[37:19] don't want to go to it right now but
[37:21] this is what the Bible says and
[37:22] basically what I'm saying is that
[37:24] science is finding out what God already
[37:26] put in his Bible 4,000 years years ago
[37:28] when
[37:29] you bring the rod it uh it it uh I'm
[37:34] sorry did I get the wrong scripture No
[37:36] it drives it far from him okay oh it
[37:38] brings wisdom that's where I was going
[37:40] yeah with the wisdom it gives wisdom so
[37:42] it gives you a new
[37:43] pathway uh and you will uh and the child
[37:46] or you know will be able to have a new
[37:48] pathway a new understanding so before
[37:50] they make the wrong decision again they
[37:52] already have a new pathway saying oh
[37:54] this is the right way to go this is the
[37:55] way of wisdom and so science is
[37:57] constantly finding out what God has
[37:59] already placed in his word amen so some
[38:02] type of a punishment gives a child an
[38:04] experience and they remember from that
[38:06] experience and if they're trained up
[38:07] that will will give them wisdom and give
[38:09] them a new pathway uh a new way to kind
[38:12] of just fall into obedience is I guess
[38:14] what I'm trying to say but a Child Left
[38:17] to himself sent away bringeth his mother
[38:20] to shame now I've talked to different
[38:21] individuals that their parents treat
[38:23] them like this whenever they do wrong
[38:25] they just send them away they say get
[38:26] out of here in instead of taking time to
[38:28] talk to them and correct them they just
[38:31] said get out of here and like brother
[38:32] Gabe said he said people that he's
[38:34] talked to recently say oh just uh have
[38:37] an hour of YouTube time and just get
[38:40] away from me you see that isn't that
[38:43] awful they and they send their children
[38:45] away and said I want to talk with them
[38:47] and help them and be with them and the
[38:50] Bible said that's that brings parents to
[38:52] a
[38:53] shame so see we don't want to send them
[38:55] away we don't want to uh leave them to
[38:57] themselves we want to go through life
[38:59] with them I asked brother timy Kimmy a
[39:01] long time ago when I first start a
[39:03] pastor how do you get your children you
[39:04] know to serve God like that and he said
[39:05] well it's it's got It's election he said
[39:08] but we just made an effort to always do
[39:09] everything together no matter what we
[39:12] did do it as a family and I've tried to
[39:14] apply that to my life as well like I can
[39:16] take my children if I go to the store if
[39:18] I go here to the church I brought
[39:20] Malachi at the church here a couple Sun
[39:22] Saturdays ago we can do some things
[39:24] together whatever we do we try to do it
[39:26] together praise God
[39:28] but see don't send them away don't
[39:30] separate yourself use it as a learning
[39:31] experience now try to move on now we
[39:34] know Proverbs 22:6 train up a child the
[39:36] way he should go when he's old he not
[39:37] depart from
[39:39] it and Hebrews 12:9 furthermore we have
[39:41] had fathers of our flesh which corrected
[39:43] us and we gave them
[39:45] reverence so see correction uh produced
[39:49] reverence the rod produces wisdom right
[39:52] so the same thing it's the same idea a
[39:55] physical punishment produces reverence
[39:57] and uh there I think a lot of people get
[39:59] away from the rod don't they now there's
[40:01] a way to abuse your children we don't
[40:03] want to do that there's a way to do it
[40:05] the right way and that's what we try to
[40:07] do by God's grace the way brother BR
[40:10] made it sound like so sometimes he might
[40:11] have got abused the way he said he got
[40:14] beaten all the time I I'll read those in
[40:16] just a moment um but Paul's saying if we
[40:21] corrected and or were corrected by our
[40:23] Earthly parents and gave them reverence
[40:25] how much more should we respect God
[40:29] and this is this is my prayer too I hope
[40:30] if you can understand this the right way
[40:32] I want to be able to recognize when
[40:34] God's correcting me for my wrongs I
[40:36] think that's what I think we all need
[40:38] and I think I need that like I want to
[40:39] recognize if something bad happened to
[40:41] my life it's because of this I failed to
[40:44] obey the Lord that's what I want to get
[40:46] better at that's another goal of mine to
[40:50] overcome my tiredness create atmosphere
[40:52] of love and not just kind of make it
[40:54] through the night because I'm so worn
[40:55] out and create atmosphere of love and
[40:57] then also to be able to recognize when
[40:59] God is correcting me I want to be able
[41:02] to do that now here's what brother Bram
[41:05] said Chason did you ever have any of it
[41:08] child training bringing you up giving
[41:09] you a little protoplasma stimulation so
[41:12] it's spanking once in a while by the
[41:14] gospel you know making you correction my
[41:16] daddy was awful good at that yes sir he
[41:18] believed in the Golden Rule it laid up
[41:20] over the door and had all the Ten
[41:21] Commandments out on it a Hickory Stick
[41:23] about that long brush on the end of it I
[41:25] tell you that may discipline the brand
[41:27] home but we love him what would we have
[41:29] been if it hadn't if Dad hadn't done it
[41:33] that's the way God is he brings
[41:34] discipline to his children trying them
[41:36] whipping them when they're
[41:39] wrong I'm happy now look I'm happy how
[41:41] many are happy that my heavenly father
[41:43] gives whippings to those who are wrong
[41:46] and corrects me when I'm wrong gives me
[41:48] whippings makes me straighten up walk
[41:50] like you
[41:51] should amen I want God to that's I I
[41:54] honestly say that I want God to whip me
[41:56] until till I'm straightened out till I'm
[41:59] I'm really walking right before the Lord
[42:01] I don't want to fail this Grace I don't
[42:02] want to be foolish virgin I want to be
[42:04] wise virgin I want to walk in the light
[42:07] the fullness of the light and he said
[42:09] I'm happy when I get spankin from God
[42:12] Amen and like my prayer is God just help
[42:14] me to recognize that help me to
[42:16] recognize that and not put it on the
[42:18] devil well the devil's G me the spanking
[42:20] I want to know if it's from the devil or
[42:22] God I want to know if I did something
[42:23] wrong
[42:24] amen and brother I had all 10 of those
[42:28] Commandments across my back and up and
[42:30] down my legs look at see I'm telling you
[42:32] you got spanked a lot pretty near every
[42:35] day it done me good though now look arms
[42:39] legs back I never got spanked on my back
[42:43] I only got spanked on my bottom as far
[42:44] as my dad but look he got it on his arms
[42:48] his legs his back but it produced a real
[42:51] good man of God didn't it I'm not
[42:53] telling you to hit your children like
[42:54] that I'm just
[42:55] saying I'll tell you a pot took me out
[42:58] behind the house and I danced a little
[43:00] jig but I know not to do it again the
[43:03] next time see he know he got the
[43:04] knowledge he got the wisdom the rod will
[43:06] give the child
[43:10] wisdom there would be a whole lot better
[43:12] life if we had some more daddies to do
[43:14] that today he never struck me one look
[43:16] or lick but what I honor him tonight for
[43:19] it when I looked in the casket I seen
[43:21] his gray hair on the side of his head I
[43:23] stood there and tears Dro down upon his
[43:25] face and I said Daddy I help put them
[43:27] there God help me that's right I
[43:28] respected my daddy he was a daddy that
[43:30] would make me do right yes sir we need
[43:32] more like that today ain't that great
[43:34] look at this look how he viewed it later
[43:36] on he's a 50 what year is this 1962 so
[43:38] he must be uh you know he must be like
[43:40] 50 uh 53 years old looking in there and
[43:44] I thank him for I honor him for every
[43:46] one of those
[43:47] weapons some people say they don't
[43:49] believe in spanking them but you know
[43:51] the scripture says if you spare the rod
[43:52] you spoil the the Sun so I believe in
[43:55] correcting children making them mine
[43:58] if we had more of that wouldn't have too
[43:59] much juvenile delinquency all
[44:03] right now I could do more on parenting
[44:06] but that's all I prepared for today so
[44:08] let's go down now this where it's going
[44:09] to get everybody here by God's grace I
[44:10] mean I should say it's going to help
[44:12] everybody let me say that and here's
[44:14] where I'm gonna tell myself a little bit
[44:19] okay so uh let me review what he said we
[44:22] have the Bible and the message apps on
[44:24] our phones brother Gabe was saying but
[44:26] which app gets click the most I thought
[44:29] that was
[44:30] good good and I rearranged my phone
[44:32] recently I put the Bible at the very
[44:33] front at the top
[44:36] um but really I don't use my phone a
[44:39] whole lot for the Bible I just use the
[44:40] literal Bible but it really helps it
[44:42] Bible studies you know or times I'm look
[44:44] or texting people scriptures really
[44:46] helpful but that's not my main Bible
[44:48] this is my main Bible amen um and then
[44:52] YouTube he said YouTube is a web and now
[44:54] how many can say Amen to this I can say
[44:55] Amen to this it sucks you in because it
[44:57] makes you
[44:58] curious oh I wonder about this video I
[45:00] wonder about that wonder about that
[45:02] wonder about that and pretty soon you're
[45:03] giving all your time to
[45:05] watching and he said the he said a
[45:08] preacher called it the message Believers
[45:10] TV is YouTube and that's
[45:12] true and he said having a phone in your
[45:15] pocket can make you a reality TV star in
[45:17] your own mind because you glorify
[45:19] yourself I want to talk about that
[45:21] little bit uh Facebook internet Etc is
[45:23] not wrong if you use it right just like
[45:25] the newspaper and yeah he had a good
[45:28] balance at the end
[45:29] too none of those things are wrong if
[45:31] you just use it the right way now let me
[45:33] tell a little bit on my uh on myself
[45:35] okay so just bear with me here I'm gonna
[45:37] tell I'm gonna tell
[45:38] myself if you think any less than me
[45:40] please pray for
[45:42] me um I was spending too much time on
[45:44] Facebook
[45:45] recently and uh like for example in the
[45:48] morning I would just wake up and to wake
[45:49] myself up I would just kind of go
[45:50] through okay what's going on today who's
[45:51] got birthdays today you know just to
[45:54] kind of wake up because I'd be so tired
[45:56] um and I started praying about I started
[45:58] realizing wow I I just lost 15 minutes
[46:00] there and you can
[46:02] easily uh do that and so I started
[46:06] praying about it feeling convicted and
[46:07] then I realized oh yeah I can block a
[46:09] lot of and then I started getting
[46:10] convicted about some of my friends
[46:11] posting stuff and this thought came to
[46:13] me what are these people adding to your
[46:15] spiritual life these
[46:18] friends and so I started unfollowing
[46:21] they're still my friends so they can see
[46:22] my
[46:23] stuff um so I got caught in a rut of
[46:25] that maybe for a month or two or
[46:27] whatever more and then I took off the
[46:28] notifications on Facebook so I don't see
[46:31] the red notifications come up so it
[46:33] doesn't make me want to open it and now
[46:35] like today I checked it for like five
[46:36] minutes this morning I'm done so I want
[46:38] to tell you God gave me a lot of Grace
[46:39] to get victory in that area okay because
[46:42] I was felt I was feeling addicted to
[46:44] Facebook Okay um the second thing this
[46:48] is probably more humbling okay so
[46:49] forgive me uh but last year and for a
[46:53] few years I started watching a lot of
[46:55] sports highlights like on NFL and NBA so
[46:59] like on Sunday nights I would go home
[47:01] I'd pray with my children and I sit
[47:02] there I just kind of just relax and I'd
[47:04] say well I'm tired I just want to see
[47:05] how the football games went today so I'd
[47:07] watch a four or five minute highlights
[47:09] of all the games well that wasn't good
[47:12] because it got me got my mind more on it
[47:14] later more and more and then that was
[47:16] last fall okay I'm sorry two Falls ago
[47:19] the fall of 2015 and the spring of
[47:22] 2016 um the Cavaliers started doing good
[47:26] and I'm going to tell my myself in the
[47:27] mornings ID wake up and when they have
[47:29] games just to wake myself up I'd watch
[47:31] their highlights and then I started
[47:33] watching like every morning then and
[47:35] then every morning and every morning and
[47:37] I got so convicted and it would last you
[47:40] know five minutes but then it it
[47:41] wouldn't stop after that then I want to
[47:42] watch the highlights of another game so
[47:44] I'd spend 15 20 minutes sometimes in the
[47:46] morning waking myself up and I just got
[47:50] in the bad habit of it uh and I got so
[47:53] convicted when last May I went out and
[47:56] preached and min Minnesota you remember
[47:57] when I went out there and you we had
[47:59] some tremendous meetings but after the
[48:02] Sunday night
[48:03] service here's what I prayed I was so
[48:06] convicted I got on my face and I was
[48:08] crying saying
[48:10] God please take this from me because
[48:12] every morning every morning every
[48:13] morning now I would after that I would
[48:15] read my Bible I have my coffee I would
[48:17] pray but I just felt like a slave to it
[48:21] and at that meeting on that Sunday night
[48:23] meeting I prayed with tears on my eyes I
[48:25] said Lord I'm going to make a wow if
[48:28] you'll let the Cavaliers win the
[48:30] championship I will not watch another
[48:32] highlight in the
[48:34] morning and they had not woned they've
[48:36] never won a championship up to
[48:38] then and just a few weeks later they won
[48:41] the
[48:42] championship I made that vow and by
[48:44] God's grace one time I slipped up a few
[48:46] weeks ago you I was just looking at I
[48:48] was flipping through my phone in the
[48:49] morning and I just started watching a
[48:50] video and I stopped it right away but
[48:52] since then that was June July August
[48:54] September October November December
[48:56] January we're almost in February seven
[48:59] months God has given me Grace I kept my
[49:00] word to the Lord amen and that's just a
[49:03] humble
[49:04] example I just said Lord I just want to
[49:07] would you please just allow them to win
[49:08] so I can just stop being interested and
[49:10] God answered my prayer so I've told on
[49:12] myself three times tonight that was the
[49:14] last one by God's grace but I want you
[49:17] to let you know that that uh the phone
[49:18] is not something I always battle but
[49:20] there are times when I have and these
[49:22] have been the times I battled Facebook
[49:24] and then sports highlights because I was
[49:26] in the sports a lot me to uh um never
[49:31] you know I never go into anything evil
[49:33] or anything like that but those Sports
[49:34] and the Facebook got me I just want to
[49:36] tell you I got victory over him by God's
[49:37] grace through US humble prayer
[49:40] repentance and then just changing
[49:42] changing some things changing my heart
[49:45] guarding my heart more praise God
[49:47] anything we do for God praise the Lord
[49:49] then God God uh God sees our efforts
[49:55] okay all right so I want to make sure I
[49:57] told you my battles because I I I'm I'm
[49:59] human I have battles too all right but
[50:01] let's read this now let me uh start
[50:04] reading some quotes to balance this out
[50:06] and how much time do I got okay I got 34
[50:08] minutes plenty of time good praise the
[50:10] Lord Brother Gabe did a good job
[50:12] balancing it but this is the quote I
[50:14] always read when people ask me what do
[50:15] you think about Instagram what do you
[50:16] think brother BR I think television will
[50:18] curse the world what do you think about
[50:19] it well whoever wrote it I agree with
[50:21] you they made it a curse to the world it
[50:23] could be a blessing but they made it
[50:25] anything like that my dear people is
[50:26] what you look at
[50:28] yourself if a television's a curse then
[50:31] the newspaper's a curse then the radio
[50:33] is a curse then your smartphones a curse
[50:35] right and many time the telephone
[50:38] is oh sorry let me go back see it's what
[50:42] you make of it so brother they brother
[50:44] bam tells us anything can be a curse I
[50:46] think I told you this my dad one time
[50:47] went to church and he and he he left our
[50:50] church that we were raised in and told
[50:51] my my wife or my mom sorry my mom um and
[50:55] said honey they or darling they made
[50:57] Honey I Shrunk the Kids and candy bars
[51:00] sin so I guess the sermon must have
[51:02] included Honey I Shrunk the Kids was a
[51:04] TV a movie that came out when I was a
[51:05] boy I remember it because we went to see
[51:06] it at the drive-in and the pastor must
[51:09] have made that a sin and he said they
[51:11] must have made snicker bars a sin
[51:12] because something got preached about
[51:15] that um but that's true those things can
[51:18] be now of course we know the movies are
[51:20] sin but a Snicker bar of itself isn't a
[51:22] sin unless you make it an idol right you
[51:26] know if you make food to Idol you know
[51:27] if you you know what I'm saying is
[51:31] that we must have the discernment and we
[51:34] must have let me say this we must have
[51:35] the power over all these things we must
[51:38] control Facebook we must control if you
[51:40] have a TV what comes over across that
[51:43] and especially your tablets and
[51:44] computers you've got to control what
[51:46] what comes over there if not you don't
[51:49] have the character yet to handle it got
[51:51] to have the character so see anything
[51:54] can be a curse unless we handle it and
[51:56] we rule over it like we talking about
[51:58] Kings and Priests we must rule over all
[52:00] these things by God's grace now look
[52:02] what the Bible says unto the pure all
[52:04] things are pure this is the scripture
[52:06] that we would talk about Facebook's okay
[52:08] internet's okay newspaper okay all these
[52:11] things are okay as long as that's a pure
[52:13] thing for
[52:14] you but unto them that are defiled and
[52:17] unbelieving is nothing pure but even
[52:19] their mind and conscience is defiled so
[52:21] when I was struggling with Facebook this
[52:23] was this was a this defiled me because I
[52:26] didn't didn't have any confidence toward
[52:27] God God I just lost all that time I lost
[52:30] all that time this was defil in me but I
[52:32] prayed and God helped me to get victory
[52:33] over it you understand what I'm saying
[52:35] but now it's a pure thing now I use it
[52:37] now it's pure it doesn't cause me to
[52:39] stumble it doesn't come before God you
[52:40] know it doesn't get more time than God
[52:43] it's in its right
[52:45] place see but even their mind is
[52:47] conscience is and conscience is
[52:50] defiled so you know you're walking pure
[52:52] before God when your your conscience
[52:54] isn't defiled you don't feel bad about
[52:56] whatever you're
[52:57] allowing okay in your conscience I'm I'm
[53:00] lording over this I'm ruling over this
[53:02] as a king or priest I've got control of
[53:04] this this is not controlling me I'm
[53:06] controlling
[53:07] it and here's our scripture so
[53:10] everything this is our text we must
[53:12] always try to edify others and that's
[53:14] what I'm gonna say with Facebook or with
[53:15] Instagram if your posts are not edifying
[53:18] people you edified the wrong
[53:22] thing it's not made to argue we're not
[53:25] made to argue politics on Facebook we're
[53:27] not supposed to argue at all the Bible
[53:29] says everything we do should build
[53:32] people up all
[53:34] right everything Snicker bar whatever
[53:38] whatever you're talking about TV monitor
[53:40] whatever you tablet it's got to edify
[53:43] other people whether it's an app or
[53:45] whatever more it's got to
[53:46] edify but if we're offending people then
[53:49] it's evil what we're doing it's
[53:52] evil um and so that's why I want to
[53:55] bring that scripture and he Saidi will
[53:57] not do anything whereby somebody
[53:59] stumbles or is made weak I never want to
[54:01] make somebody fall in their Christian
[54:03] walk with God okay we don't want to make
[54:06] anybody stumble that's why I was telling
[54:07] brother Austin I know he just stepped
[54:08] out but he asked me about drinking wine
[54:10] I said yes if you want to drink wine in
[54:13] the privacy of your
[54:14] home I could see that maybe because you
[54:17] know Paul told Timothy drink a little
[54:18] wine for your stomach's sake but I'm a
[54:20] pastor and people look at me and I have
[54:23] to be the
[54:24] example I could but really don't even
[54:27] care to drink wine that whatever more I
[54:29] mean but you never want to do anything
[54:31] that would cause anybody to
[54:33] stumble you'd have to use it for the
[54:35] right reasons you know some people but I
[54:36] certainly don't believe in Social
[54:38] drinking brother BR tells us the evils
[54:39] in that because right along with that is
[54:42] automatic weaknesses and offenses well
[54:44] Adam's a Christian he drinks sister
[54:47] Wendy she's a Christian she drinks
[54:48] publicly he he drinks at Red Lobster P
[54:51] Pastor Jesse drinks uh at Giant Eagle on
[54:54] Sunday nights I can too and they'll take
[54:57] and run with
[54:58] that and you're the cause of it or I'm
[55:01] the cause of it and we don't want to do
[55:04] that so I feel like if somebody ask me
[55:08] do you drink at home it's the best thing
[55:09] to not do it at
[55:11] all because how do I know somebody don't
[55:13] have an alcohol problem right if you can
[55:15] control it fine but don't tell people
[55:17] about it okay because I just met alcohol
[55:19] alcohol alcohol addicted man recently
[55:22] and we don't you don't want that demon
[55:24] because of that alcohol he's literally
[55:26] seen demons in his in his his life
[55:29] literally and he's telling me that with
[55:31] almost tears his eyes are watering up
[55:33] and so now he can't even sleep in the
[55:34] dark he's got to sleep with lights on
[55:36] because of the alcohol or the demon of
[55:39] alcohol so don't tell me church it's not
[55:41] it's very serious and we never want to
[55:43] cause anybody to stumble or make anybody
[55:47] weak all right so happy whenever we do
[55:51] some something we should be happy about
[55:52] I should be able to happily show Wendy
[55:54] my Facebook page or happy to show on my
[55:56] Facebook page or if I post something on
[55:58] I don't I'm not on Instagram but if I am
[56:01] I'm happy to show you this post I
[56:02] shouldn't have to hide this from anybody
[56:04] I should have such faith that this is
[56:06] the right thing to post I could show it
[56:07] to
[56:09] anybody all
[56:10] right and we must do whatever we do it
[56:13] we must do it in s in in in faith or
[56:15] it's sin now let me stop right here it's
[56:18] okay every now and then to post
[56:19] something about food or something fun
[56:21] you do because you got to be human
[56:24] there's got to be a balance to that
[56:25] brother there's pictures of brother Ram
[56:27] out hunting where he's just joking and
[56:29] laughing around with the brothers
[56:30] they're they're they switch their hats
[56:32] they're just being silly and all the
[56:33] people that know brother brandom said he
[56:35] told a lot of jokes and pranks when he
[56:37] was out
[56:38] hunting we got to let people be humans
[56:41] praise the lord we got let them just
[56:42] laugh and but we got to be careful not
[56:44] to let that turn into sin but there's
[56:47] it's okay to let off the pressure it's
[56:49] okay you know to to be human as well but
[56:51] we can't cause people to be weak or
[56:54] can't cause them to stumble well well
[56:56] because you did because you drank I can
[56:58] go get drunk no that's not how it works
[57:02] we got to be very careful got to let
[57:04] people be human we and laugh you gota
[57:06] jokes you know you got clean jokes
[57:08] that's fine but you can't let it go too
[57:12] far all right now the same thing is
[57:15] repeated in Corinthians you probably
[57:17] know this I preached on this a few years
[57:18] ago take heedless by any means this
[57:21] Liberty of yours is a stumbling block to
[57:23] them that are weak as Christians we have
[57:26] Liberty you know we can uh like I said
[57:29] we can do Facebook or we can do TV or
[57:31] whatever you want to
[57:33] do but we cannot cause people to get
[57:36] weak because of what we do for If any
[57:38] man see thee which hath knowledge sit at
[57:40] me in the idols Temple now let's pause
[57:42] right there some of the Christians in
[57:44] Corinth would go into the Temple of an
[57:46] idol let's say Diana or let's say some
[57:48] uh Zeus or something like that I don't
[57:49] know the names of them anymore Mercury
[57:52] or whatever some of the Christians would
[57:54] just for a meal to buy some meat
[57:56] they would go into the Temple of an idol
[57:58] and sit in there and the new Christians
[57:59] would look and say well he's in a pagan
[58:01] Temple that's satanic that's demonic and
[58:04] it would cause them to stumble so Paul
[58:07] says he said if if they see you with
[58:10] knowledge of God in a ID Temple of an
[58:13] idol shall not the conscience of him
[58:15] which is weak be embold to those things
[58:17] which are offered to idols and through
[58:19] your knowledge the weak brother perish
[58:21] or for whom Christ
[58:23] died don't you see that you have
[58:25] knowledge said that meat doesn't cause
[58:27] anybody stumble now we can apply this to
[58:29] bars today can't
[58:30] we what if I see you and I go out I go
[58:33] to Applebees and you're sitting at the
[58:34] bar by a bunch of friends and they're
[58:36] all drinking and there's all this rock
[58:38] and roll ACDC Metallica on and a new
[58:40] Christian walks in there say hey there's
[58:42] brother Jesse he's at the
[58:45] bar and he's laughing with his friends
[58:47] and he's have a boy night
[58:49] out which I don't do and I would not do
[58:53] but that's the that's the parable we get
[58:54] today well he's eating me and but it's
[58:56] in there's nothing wrong with the meat
[58:58] there's nothing wrong with his meal but
[59:00] he's around he's in the wrong
[59:03] atmosphere and that would cause well if
[59:05] a pastor did it well then I can do it
[59:08] too I'll go down to Luigi's or I'll go
[59:11] down to whatever bar you I don't even
[59:14] know any bar names Mercy that's good
[59:16] though but you understand and through
[59:19] your knowledge you cause them to perish
[59:21] and let's say they fall out of the the
[59:23] faith now look what happened to you you
[59:25] call somebody stumble and they leave
[59:26] they leave the
[59:28] faith I don't want to be the now
[59:30] remember Jesus can't lose one that's his
[59:31] own but I don't want to be the cause of
[59:33] anybody because my weakness or my my
[59:35] ignorance I don't want to cause anybody
[59:37] to fall
[59:38] away I want to stand true as a Christian
[59:40] example and if they leave let them leave
[59:41] because I'm living holy not because I'm
[59:45] uh I'm trying to take some Liberty or
[59:47] something like that but let them re re
[59:49] uh let them leave because I'm standing
[59:51] on Holiness not because I'm causing them
[59:54] to
[59:54] stumble all right because when you sin
[59:57] so against the Brethren and wound their
[59:59] weak conscience you sin against
[1:00:02] Christ and we don't see that's a sin
[1:00:04] that's literally a sin that's why
[1:00:06] brother Austin I was saying you were you
[1:00:07] stepped out that's why I don't drink at
[1:00:08] home because if somebody found out I
[1:00:10] drink wine at home or something like
[1:00:11] that uh they would they'd fall but I
[1:00:14] don't even want to drink at home really
[1:00:15] I I I don't I know there's a danger
[1:00:17] there I I just don't want to do that uh
[1:00:20] we never want to cause anybody to
[1:00:21] stumble we always want to make sure
[1:00:23] people can look at our lives and get
[1:00:24] strength from us
[1:00:27] my bro look at that brother Adam look at
[1:00:28] sister Bo look how they serve God oh
[1:00:30] that just makes me want to serve God too
[1:00:32] that's how we should live our lives amen
[1:00:35] sorry um wherefore now here's this is
[1:00:38] beautiful wherefore if meat makes my
[1:00:41] brother to offend so if me going and
[1:00:42] eating a steak at the bar causes
[1:00:45] somebody to offend I will eat no steak
[1:00:47] from the bar while the world
[1:00:50] stands lest I make my brother to
[1:00:53] offend while the world stands in other
[1:00:55] words so for the rest of my days on this
[1:00:57] Earth until Jesus Christ comes back I
[1:00:59] won't cause anybody to stumble and the
[1:01:01] church
[1:01:03] said praise the
[1:01:06] Lord so we gota we got to be aware of
[1:01:09] people you know around us and if they're
[1:01:11] kind of asking about our lives and if we
[1:01:12] feel there's a little questionable thing
[1:01:14] we got to be careful not to do it we
[1:01:17] don't want to cause anybody to
[1:01:18] stumble now he also preached on The
[1:01:21] Temptations of keeping up with the
[1:01:22] Joneses having brand new technology and
[1:01:24] things like that we got to be careful
[1:01:25] with that
[1:01:27] by God's grace then he started preaching
[1:01:29] on Facebook and yes and I want yeah let
[1:01:32] me just spend a little bit more time on
[1:01:33] this he said many people just project a
[1:01:35] Persona on
[1:01:37] Facebook so in other words they're
[1:01:39] putting something out there that's
[1:01:40] really not the
[1:01:42] reality uh we must make sure Facebook
[1:01:45] does not glorify our own life but the
[1:01:47] Life of
[1:01:48] Christ okay on Facebook The Joy or Focus
[1:01:51] can come from getting a lot of likes he
[1:01:52] said that last week remember that
[1:01:54] Facebook should not become glorification
[1:01:56] of self without no dying out or no
[1:01:59] humility okay and and that's a challenge
[1:02:01] on social media it's a challenge
[1:02:03] um and so if you have questions about
[1:02:06] that you know you can ask somebody to
[1:02:07] look at it I'll look at your Facebook
[1:02:08] page or I'll look at whatever you do on
[1:02:10] social
[1:02:12] media but there's I want to say this we
[1:02:15] are not supposed to put our bad parts
[1:02:17] out on Facebook we're not supposed to
[1:02:19] put our dirty laundry on social media
[1:02:20] are you with you understand
[1:02:22] that you don't want to put your dirty
[1:02:24] laundry in the church you don't want to
[1:02:26] come and gossip and tell everybody well
[1:02:27] boy we had a really awful day yesterday
[1:02:29] and so and so to this
[1:02:32] and people get hurt when you share their
[1:02:35] faults what if I came in here saying you
[1:02:36] know my wife did this CH saints come on
[1:02:40] my wife then she did this then she said
[1:02:42] that then she I mean that would destroy
[1:02:44] her what if she came and say he he's the
[1:02:46] pastor but I'll tell you what he did
[1:02:47] yesterday oh
[1:02:49] my you see brother bam said try to hide
[1:02:52] people's faults and that's in the
[1:02:53] scripture too that's in Proverbs I don't
[1:02:55] have in front of me me but I know I've
[1:02:56] preached on that before do all you can
[1:02:58] do to hide people's
[1:03:00] sins because that's what God does Amen
[1:03:03] to hide a multitude of sins amen so see
[1:03:06] there's an aspect of that Facebook we're
[1:03:08] not so for me Facebook is a u it's a
[1:03:11] tool to keep in touch with family it's a
[1:03:14] communication tool and that's why I love
[1:03:16] it because I can shut off anybody who's
[1:03:18] against the word I can just shut them
[1:03:19] off done and I can just see things about
[1:03:22] the word and my family members but now
[1:03:25] with you family members have they don't
[1:03:26] put everything good on there now I just
[1:03:27] see less of that see less of that and
[1:03:28] pretty soon if they don't stop stop I
[1:03:30] just cut them off all together and then
[1:03:32] it becomes for me where I can share
[1:03:34] about my family like yesterday yesterday
[1:03:36] I put a picture of my brothers and I I
[1:03:38] put a scripture at the top and my
[1:03:39] brothers how I got to preach last
[1:03:41] weekend and be with my brothers how how
[1:03:43] pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in
[1:03:44] unity amen so I always try to have
[1:03:47] something positive on there something
[1:03:49] positive so my family can keep uh keep
[1:03:52] up with us that's what we try to do I'm
[1:03:54] not trying to glorify myself for My
[1:03:56] Lifestyle uh but I'm trying to keep in
[1:03:58] touch with my family because I like
[1:03:59] keeping in touch with my family I never
[1:04:01] get to see them I miss them so I like to
[1:04:04] see the pictures of their children and
[1:04:06] the and what they're doing you know
[1:04:08] everything like that to me I don't think
[1:04:09] that's glorifying ourselves now if we're
[1:04:11] putting out if we're bragging about how
[1:04:14] much we pray on Facebook if we're
[1:04:16] bragging about how much we give on
[1:04:18] Facebook well guess what I gave $25,000
[1:04:21] to the church this year my tithes and
[1:04:22] offerings well see now you went too far
[1:04:26] you're bragging about oh look at all the
[1:04:28] and I have friends have done this not in
[1:04:29] the message but Christian friends oh
[1:04:32] instead of giving gifts to our children
[1:04:33] this year we donated all that money uh
[1:04:36] to some charity and we went and packed
[1:04:39] up all these bags now look Church
[1:04:40] something they're supposed to do in
[1:04:41] private they just made public you see
[1:04:44] and I but I appreciate the fact that
[1:04:45] they wanted to do that but public
[1:04:48] bragging that see that's self-
[1:04:50] glorification and may let me give them
[1:04:51] the benefit of the doubt maybe they
[1:04:52] don't they don't know better than than
[1:04:54] to do that Al should be done in secret
[1:04:57] but I appreciate the desire right I
[1:04:59] appreciate the want to put something
[1:05:00] about Jesus on at Christmas time I love
[1:05:02] that I love that but we should have with
[1:05:06] with our message we should have more
[1:05:08] wisdom to kind of stay off of things
[1:05:10] like that now if you have any questions
[1:05:12] about what Facebook or Instagram or
[1:05:14] whatever you do uh be careful now I want
[1:05:17] to say this the last thing is we got to
[1:05:19] be really careful with our children how
[1:05:20] much access we give them in apps because
[1:05:23] one of those apps is like opening up a
[1:05:24] world of possib abilities for example
[1:05:27] Instagram I met numerous people come to
[1:05:29] me and
[1:05:30] say if you're on that it's good as long
[1:05:32] as you stay in
[1:05:33] your your connections whatever more but
[1:05:36] as soon as you type in the wrong you're
[1:05:38] searching for a keyword a world of evils
[1:05:41] opened up to
[1:05:42] you so we got to be extremely careful
[1:05:45] same thing with
[1:05:46] Facebook same thing with the Google
[1:05:49] search if you type in one word you can
[1:05:51] even type in good things and come up
[1:05:53] with evil we have to be very very
[1:05:56] careful in other words we've got to
[1:05:57] control it not it control us we've got
[1:06:00] to control if you see something evil
[1:06:02] close the page scroll up get run From
[1:06:05] Evil don't put up with it and church
[1:06:07] when that happens to me I just close my
[1:06:09] eyes and pray and say God forgive me I
[1:06:10] didn't want to see that forgive
[1:06:13] me right or if my eyes entertain it for
[1:06:15] a few seconds like a man you know you
[1:06:17] might be attracted and say God forgive
[1:06:19] me close my eyes and X out of it close
[1:06:22] right away forgive me because we're all
[1:06:24] human right and that's why brother R put
[1:06:26] the the cross in his car give me
[1:06:28] something to just help me to look away
[1:06:29] from that help me to look at Calvary
[1:06:31] praise God but especially with our
[1:06:34] children we must guard them with all
[1:06:37] that we have we must guard it with all
[1:06:38] we have okay I'm doing pretty good on
[1:06:41] time I got 18 minutes all right that
[1:06:42] should be plenty time yep plenty time
[1:06:43] for complacency and then he said he said
[1:06:46] he said we need a shaken we can't be
[1:06:48] complacent all right so our brother said
[1:06:51] that and remember uh let's look at this
[1:06:53] here and I'm what I'm going to do is I'm
[1:06:56] going to put quotes in here that I was
[1:06:57] going to preach tonight if I was on the
[1:06:58] Ephesian Church age because that's
[1:07:00] exactly where we are in the Ephesian
[1:07:01] Church age uh leaving the first love so
[1:07:04] this this actually fit perfectly in with
[1:07:06] this and I was very blessed by
[1:07:08] that and we use the word conforming this
[1:07:11] morning right because that's from the
[1:07:12] scripture we're predestined to be
[1:07:13] conformed when the church thinks more of
[1:07:16] conforming to the world instead of
[1:07:17] conforming to God it isn't long until
[1:07:19] you see them stop doing things they used
[1:07:21] to do and start doing things they
[1:07:23] wouldn't do initially they change their
[1:07:25] manner of dress their attitudes and
[1:07:26] their behavior they get laxed that is
[1:07:28] what Ephesus means relaxed and
[1:07:32] drifting now let me just stop right
[1:07:37] here when we're conformed to the
[1:07:40] world we actually start
[1:07:43] sinning but if we still keep our Godly
[1:07:46] rules and
[1:07:47] standards uh then we're not sinning Let
[1:07:49] me Give an example like my brother
[1:07:51] Paul he uh he's into that hip look
[1:07:56] that's kind of trendy right all the hair
[1:07:58] is combed
[1:07:59] over tighter
[1:08:01] jeans you know but he still let me say
[1:08:04] like this he still dresses
[1:08:07] modestly and the jeans aren't too tight
[1:08:10] because we know we shouldn't show off
[1:08:12] our our forms right so he in my mind
[1:08:15] he's doing a pretty good job although he
[1:08:17] looks like a the trend that that's the
[1:08:19] trend now right the Hipster look and the
[1:08:21] plaid shirts and the whatever more I I
[1:08:23] don't know I'm not I'm not really in
[1:08:25] touch with all
[1:08:27] that but you can you can have uh and
[1:08:30] that and remember Styles change right
[1:08:32] they used to be big glasses in the 70s
[1:08:34] and they got smaller in the 90s and now
[1:08:35] they're going back big
[1:08:37] again Styles change but some of those
[1:08:40] things aren't
[1:08:41] sin but the trouble is is when we start
[1:08:44] conforming to the world and actually
[1:08:46] sinning like women you know with splits
[1:08:48] showing off their thighs or high heels
[1:08:50] or something like that or men you know
[1:08:53] showing off their body parts muscle
[1:08:55] shirts whatever you know anything
[1:08:57] lustful anything outside the word of
[1:09:00] God so that's I just want to make that
[1:09:02] differentiation you can still kind of go
[1:09:04] with the Fashions but still be
[1:09:07] holy okay but you got make sure you have
[1:09:09] to make sure you stop it and don't go
[1:09:11] into IM immodesty or
[1:09:14] immorality because that's just how the
[1:09:15] world is just goes into Fashions like
[1:09:17] right now the these these uh just for
[1:09:20] example right now the trend is tight
[1:09:21] pants well these are baggy because when
[1:09:23] I bought them that was the trend baggy
[1:09:25] pants
[1:09:27] really I mean really these are really
[1:09:28] baggy they're just you look at brother
[1:09:29] br's pictures they're not as baggy
[1:09:31] they're just a little bit thinner so you
[1:09:33] see but this doesn't change you know
[1:09:35] this is this isn't immodest it's still
[1:09:37] holy but the fashion changes a little
[1:09:40] bit
[1:09:42] right so I just want to make sure I say
[1:09:44] that just because somebody might be
[1:09:46] dressing like a hipster or you know I
[1:09:48] hope hope that doesn't offend people
[1:09:51] that doesn't necessarily mean they're
[1:09:52] conforming to the world they're just
[1:09:53] changing the style
[1:09:56] but when you start sinning and acting
[1:09:58] like the world or believing the things
[1:10:00] of the world and sinning well then then
[1:10:01] you're wrong then you are conforming to
[1:10:03] the world we must be con constantly
[1:10:05] conformed to the word so I just want you
[1:10:08] to see that now so see people get laxed
[1:10:10] or they get
[1:10:11] tired of the standards that we hold and
[1:10:14] that's what we got to be careful God
[1:10:16] help me not to get relaxed on God help
[1:10:19] me to maintain Holiness I me to maintain
[1:10:22] uh my seeking of
[1:10:23] you and help me not to get lacked
[1:10:26] spiritually okay now this is beautiful
[1:10:29] the cycle of Revival and death has never
[1:10:32] failed let's say never ready never this
[1:10:34] has never failed ever and you can see it
[1:10:36] all through the Bible all you have to do
[1:10:38] is recall the last move of God in the
[1:10:40] spirit when men and women dressed like
[1:10:43] Christians went to church prayed all
[1:10:46] night now I've never prayed all night
[1:10:48] but I have prayed with all my
[1:10:50] might I prayed for hours you know a
[1:10:52] couple times past hour you know longer
[1:10:55] than that I've never prayed all night
[1:10:57] but I prayed with all my might and I
[1:10:59] have sighed and cried for the
[1:11:00] Abominations done in this city and the
[1:11:02] and my family my my family that's not in
[1:11:04] the message of
[1:11:05] course so see just I want I just want
[1:11:08] you to know praying all night is not a
[1:11:09] Bible rule you know like the Bible never
[1:11:12] says you have to pray all night to go to
[1:11:14] heaven but brother bam obviously saw in
[1:11:16] history where Believers were so hungry
[1:11:18] for God they would pray a long time and
[1:11:20] I talk to people that have all night
[1:11:22] prayer services and a lot of people fall
[1:11:24] asleep during those services like
[1:11:25] they're trying to fulfill that they're
[1:11:27] trying and that's good I'm glad but you
[1:11:30] don't have to do that to go to heaven
[1:11:32] because then you become legalistic right
[1:11:34] but to want to experience it there's
[1:11:36] nothing wrong with that I'd probably be
[1:11:37] the first one that fell asleep unless I
[1:11:38] was preaching or singing Because I get
[1:11:40] real tired after a long day um so I'm
[1:11:44] just let's just balance that out by
[1:11:45] God's grace they took to the streets now
[1:11:47] we've done that by God's grace corners
[1:11:49] and weren't ashamed of the manifestation
[1:11:51] of the spirit
[1:11:53] amen they left their old dead churches
[1:11:55] amen and worshiped in homes Glory I've
[1:11:58] done that or in store buildings I've
[1:11:59] done
[1:12:00] that uh they had
[1:12:03] reality think about that some of us have
[1:12:06] I've left mega churches millions of
[1:12:08] dollars of I used to go to church with
[1:12:10] million and beautiful pipe organs and
[1:12:12] beautiful uh and I've willingly left
[1:12:15] that to go Worship in a old storefront
[1:12:17] with water coming down through the
[1:12:19] ceiling why because I got a reality amen
[1:12:22] I know what the word says I know what
[1:12:24] God does amen
[1:12:25] I see a dead lukewarm church and I know
[1:12:27] it is but I also see a Living Church as
[1:12:29] well you see and we're the so for most
[1:12:32] of us we're the first generation Holy
[1:12:34] Ghost filled Believers and that's what
[1:12:36] we're getting into it this never fails
[1:12:38] this cycle never
[1:12:40] fails he says they had reality but it
[1:12:43] wasn't too long till they've be getting
[1:12:44] get enough money to get fine new
[1:12:45] churches we have a fine new church here
[1:12:48] I love it but we can't get lack on God
[1:12:51] that's why I appreciate you coming out
[1:12:52] on a Sunday night God bless each and
[1:12:54] every on here tonight by God's grace
[1:12:56] because pretty soon if we everything
[1:12:58] gets new and everything goes good people
[1:13:00] start falling away they don't want to
[1:13:01] hear the word we got to keep feeding on
[1:13:02] the word because you know you need it
[1:13:04] and I know I need it too we got to stay
[1:13:07] in the word of God this will never fail
[1:13:10] he said they put a choir in instead of
[1:13:12] singing to God for
[1:13:14] themselves I love brother how he has
[1:13:17] this
[1:13:18] discernment choir can be a good thing
[1:13:20] but for most churches it just replaces
[1:13:22] and the so the people don't have to sing
[1:13:24] anymore
[1:13:27] they'd rather hear a good song than sing
[1:13:28] from the joy in their
[1:13:30] heart that's spiritual
[1:13:33] laziness they put gowns on the
[1:13:36] choir they organized a movement ran it
[1:13:38] by man they soon began to read books now
[1:13:41] for us watch YouTube
[1:13:43] videos that they weren't fit to watch or
[1:13:46] read they let down the bar see that's
[1:13:48] what I got with Facebook I started
[1:13:49] reading that and it got too much so I
[1:13:52] recognize that now God help us to
[1:13:54] recognize in all of our Lives me and if
[1:13:56] it happens in my life whatever is wrong
[1:13:58] in my life God help me to get it
[1:14:00] right they let down the bars and the
[1:14:02] goats came in and took over the Cry Of
[1:14:04] Joy was gone no more joy the freedom of
[1:14:08] the spirit was gone oh they kept on with
[1:14:11] the form but the fire had died down in
[1:14:14] the Blackness of Ashes is about all
[1:14:15] that's
[1:14:17] left see so your your fire depends upon
[1:14:20] what you're reading and your joy and
[1:14:22] your freedom right remember false
[1:14:24] Doctrine enslaves you right you're not
[1:14:26] free you're slave by false Doctrine I
[1:14:28] don't want anybody slaved I just want
[1:14:30] you to be a slave to Christ tonight by
[1:14:31] God's grace not slave to Demons but a
[1:14:34] slave to Christ a prisoner to Christ
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:37] amen and then your fire will keep on
[1:14:40] burning praise God
[1:14:42] Amen a few moments ago I mentioned that
[1:14:45] John understood what it was to love God
[1:14:47] that great Apostle of Love would
[1:14:49] certainly see it when the church begin
[1:14:50] to lose that first love of God for this
[1:14:52] is love of God that we keep his
[1:14:53] Commandments Glory one little deviation
[1:14:57] from that word that's what I was feeling
[1:14:58] with my Facebook and my my basketball
[1:15:00] videos one little de deviation from that
[1:15:03] word was a step away from Christ people
[1:15:05] say they love God they go to church they
[1:15:07] even shout and rejoice and sing and have
[1:15:09] an emotional time but he's not done but
[1:15:11] when it's all over look at this this is
[1:15:13] so beautiful watch and see if they are
[1:15:15] in that word so no matter how we act
[1:15:19] here spend some time with them away from
[1:15:22] church say hey can I hang out with you
[1:15:24] or can we do this together now not that
[1:15:26] you're spyed on somebody but just when
[1:15:27] you're around
[1:15:28] people watch how they
[1:15:31] act once they're done with all the
[1:15:33] emotion or whatever how they seem to be
[1:15:35] spiritual watch and see if they're in
[1:15:37] that word walking in it living in it if
[1:15:39] they go through all the other and don't
[1:15:41] walk in that word they can say they love
[1:15:43] God but their lives tell another story I
[1:15:46] want my life to tell one story this is
[1:15:49] my story this is my song Blessed
[1:15:51] Assurance praising My Savior all the day
[1:15:53] long amen I want my children to see me
[1:15:56] praising the Lord praising My Savior I
[1:15:58] want that my wife to see me doing that I
[1:16:00] want to be living exactly what I preach
[1:16:04] amen if not I'm a hypocrite and I need
[1:16:06] to be corrected I need to repent amen
[1:16:09] but by God's grace I'm not
[1:16:11] Hallelujah he said I wonder if John
[1:16:13] didn't see a lot of that what people
[1:16:15] being emotional being happy in church
[1:16:17] but living a different life before he
[1:16:20] died people saying they love God but not
[1:16:22] obeying his word oh Ephesian Church
[1:16:24] Something's Happened to you someone's
[1:16:26] trying to either add to the word or take
[1:16:27] from it but they're doing it so subbly
[1:16:29] that you can't see it they haven't made
[1:16:31] a move so big that you can see it out
[1:16:33] there in the open it's under the cover
[1:16:35] and they're bringing it by way of human
[1:16:37] reason I'm sorry reason of human
[1:16:39] understanding that'll take over unless
[1:16:40] you refuse it go back to what Pentecost
[1:16:45] before it is too late what's Pentecost
[1:16:48] repent right repent be baptized be
[1:16:50] filled with the Holy Spirit go back to
[1:16:52] the Holy Spirit then amen
[1:16:55] but as usual I just got a few I think
[1:16:58] just two more people don't heed God's
[1:17:01] warning that Revival fire built upon the
[1:17:04] sacred word is so wonderful and the
[1:17:06] manifestation of the spirit so blessed
[1:17:08] that a little fear Creeps in and a
[1:17:09] whisper in the heart says how can we
[1:17:11] protect this truth that we have what can
[1:17:13] we do to see this revival goes on that
[1:17:16] is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in
[1:17:17] and Whispers look you have the truth now
[1:17:19] see that it doesn't get lost organize
[1:17:21] and set up your Creed or what you
[1:17:23] believe put it all on a church
[1:17:26] manual right we know Pentecost did this
[1:17:28] after 1906 at some point and they do it
[1:17:31] they organize they add to the word and
[1:17:34] they die just like Eve did for taking
[1:17:36] one wrong word it's God's word that
[1:17:38] brings life and it's not what we say
[1:17:41] about the word that counts but it's what
[1:17:43] God
[1:17:43] Said Amen that beautiful now we got to
[1:17:46] make sure that doesn't happen to me
[1:17:47] churches the same thing happens brother
[1:17:49] Brandon had a Revival in his life well
[1:17:51] whatever whever we are with that we're
[1:17:53] what two generations after him I am at
[1:17:55] least by God's grace uh we have to make
[1:17:58] sure we have a first generation
[1:18:00] experience praise God a first generation
[1:18:03] experience God has no grandchildren
[1:18:05] praise the
[1:18:06] Lord and we know the cycle of death and
[1:18:09] Revival never fails so see what and and
[1:18:12] I'm looking like this I got to make sure
[1:18:13] my children get the Holy Ghost they
[1:18:15] cannot think they got
[1:18:17] it they have to either get it or no they
[1:18:19] don't have
[1:18:21] it praise God that's why in Sunday
[1:18:23] school from time to time we've had them
[1:18:25] write down where do they think they're
[1:18:26] at are they in
[1:18:27] justification or before that
[1:18:29] sanctification or baptism Holy Ghost and
[1:18:31] they always got it right at least from
[1:18:32] what I've seen in other words none of
[1:18:34] them have told me they're filled with
[1:18:35] the Holy Ghost because they've been
[1:18:37] taught that a holy ghost life looks like
[1:18:40] the Bible it's a life of power it's a
[1:18:43] life of hunger and thirsting for God
[1:18:44] it's a life of boldness you can live it
[1:18:47] before everybody praise the lord it's a
[1:18:49] life of virtue and knowledge and
[1:18:50] Temperance and godliness and patience
[1:18:52] and brotherly kindness amen it's life
[1:18:55] fill with that and every time I've asked
[1:18:56] the children they all Place themselves
[1:18:57] in the right spot either not even
[1:18:59] Justified or
[1:19:01] Justified I think one or two have done
[1:19:03] Sanctified but uh their life tells I
[1:19:06] want them to really know I don't want
[1:19:08] them to oh I believe brother BR is a
[1:19:09] prophet I already got the Holy Ghost no
[1:19:11] sir that's a good start but that's not
[1:19:13] brother B said you can he said in 1965
[1:19:15] rising of the sun he said how many have
[1:19:17] sat here for years and listened to tapes
[1:19:19] and still not quickened by the Holy
[1:19:20] Spirit you can sit there and listen to
[1:19:22] tapes and sit and hear a prophet face to
[1:19:24] to face and still not be quickened it
[1:19:26] takes a full surrender it takes God uh
[1:19:29] working with you cleaning you out so he
[1:19:31] can fill you and put you in service amen
[1:19:34] he has no
[1:19:35] grandchildren we cannot add to the word
[1:19:38] we have to make sure that we keep
[1:19:40] ourselves on fire as well praise God I'm
[1:19:43] closing with this go to Acts chapter 4
[1:19:45] this I shared this with brother Gabe on
[1:19:47] the text and this and I shared this with
[1:19:49] Craig one time too and he was really
[1:19:50] blessed by it too Acts chapter
[1:19:53] 4:23 and I'll get to in just a moment
[1:19:55] let me get my scripture here I want to
[1:19:57] read
[1:20:03] this and this is my last quote and this
[1:20:06] is my last
[1:20:07] scripture oh good I got five minutes
[1:20:09] left praise the Lord that worked out
[1:20:11] really good so the last thing he hit was
[1:20:14] complacency okay complacency we can't be
[1:20:17] complacent we can't be content where we
[1:20:18] are we've got to Hunger for More Of God
[1:20:21] and we realize Even in our own lives we
[1:20:22] go through Cycles right we go through
[1:20:25] Cycles um Cycles were really on fire and
[1:20:28] then cool off a little bit more on fire
[1:20:30] and but see it should be an upward cycle
[1:20:33] praise God it should be upward you know
[1:20:34] we're on the upward way like brother
[1:20:35] Gabe said we can't
[1:20:37] Plateau because he said that's a
[1:20:38] deadline I thought that was pretty good
[1:20:40] I like that we can't do
[1:20:42] that now in this next
[1:20:45] quote uh it's one of my favorite quotes
[1:20:47] in the church age book of course they're
[1:20:49] all great um but he's talking about the
[1:20:52] lyan church a saying we are are rich and
[1:20:55] increase with goods and have need of
[1:20:56] nothing we don't need any more God and
[1:20:58] let's read it now the leans are all
[1:21:00] saying and trying to prove that they
[1:21:02] have it all or they have enough yet is
[1:21:06] that the truth that so PE churches today
[1:21:09] will say we have all the word we've got
[1:21:10] enough of
[1:21:12] God he said is that true compare this
[1:21:14] 20th century Church to the first century
[1:21:17] church and isn't that what we're trying
[1:21:19] to do we're trying to compare what's our
[1:21:20] blueprint in the book of Acts we should
[1:21:22] be constantly comparing our church to
[1:21:24] the book of Acts
[1:21:26] he said go ahead do that where's the
[1:21:28] power and we've seen healings recently
[1:21:30] which we're very thankful for that God
[1:21:32] answering prayer you know just doing
[1:21:34] great things we're thankful for that by
[1:21:35] God's
[1:21:36] grace where's the love
[1:21:40] amen love where is the purified church I
[1:21:44] this is what I love that with stod sin
[1:21:46] and walked in faith toward Jesus see
[1:21:49] with an I'm talking about Anan and saf
[1:21:51] Peter just was so against sin that God
[1:21:53] smot them dead because they lied they
[1:21:55] tried to bring a lie into the church and
[1:21:57] God God knew they didn't want that so
[1:21:59] God smed him dead right there don't
[1:22:02] bring that lie in the church why they
[1:22:04] were purified they didn't want lies
[1:22:06] amongst each other they wanted
[1:22:08] truth where's the unity the unity of the
[1:22:11] Believers we're all just one big family
[1:22:13] where's the unity we all love each other
[1:22:15] you can't find it he says in the leosan
[1:22:18] church if this church this lean church
[1:22:21] has all it
[1:22:22] needs and have it all
[1:22:25] and we're just as good as the first
[1:22:26] church age then why were they why was
[1:22:28] the first church crying out for more of
[1:22:30] God in the book of Acts as though they
[1:22:34] didn't have it all see leoa says we have
[1:22:37] it all but the early church had it all
[1:22:39] but wanted more praise God Amen that's
[1:22:42] what I like see we have all the
[1:22:44] revelation of the word that we need for
[1:22:45] the Rapture but we should want more
[1:22:47] Revelation for every little detail of
[1:22:50] Our Lives now how will that manifest
[1:22:52] well he tells us you cry out for more of
[1:22:56] God in the book of Acts as though they
[1:22:57] didn't have it all and yet they had far
[1:22:59] more than what we have
[1:23:01] today a't that beautiful I love how see
[1:23:04] that's why I love how brother brand was
[1:23:05] led of the Holy Spirit to go right back
[1:23:06] to the word compare this church that
[1:23:08] says oh I have everything we got all the
[1:23:10] message we got all the word we got all
[1:23:11] the quotes we got and yet do they have
[1:23:14] the same cry for more that the early
[1:23:16] church
[1:23:17] had that's how you know which church is
[1:23:21] really on fire they want more of God
[1:23:23] that's why I said God bless you for
[1:23:24] coming out to the house of God tonight
[1:23:26] and this morning you know praise the
[1:23:28] Lord that's how I feel I just can't get
[1:23:29] enough of God Amen I battle his flesh
[1:23:32] yes I told you some my own faults but
[1:23:34] when it all boils down to it brother and
[1:23:36] sister I want more of God in my life I
[1:23:39] can't get enough of God I want more of
[1:23:40] him amen so let's read acts four then
[1:23:43] we'll have you stand after we read this
[1:23:44] acts
[1:23:46] 4:23 if you know the story the Saints
[1:23:49] got arrested they just was their
[1:23:51] actually their first persecution in
[1:23:52] chapter 4 uh Peter's brought before the
[1:23:54] Sanhedrin about the man the lame man who
[1:23:57] was
[1:23:59] healed and
[1:24:03] uh I think they just beat him and let
[1:24:05] him go if not or maybe they had a night
[1:24:07] in the prison uh I might have that mixed
[1:24:09] up but pardon
[1:24:10] me verse 23 let's read this and then
[1:24:13] we'll close and being let go so after
[1:24:15] this Sanhedrin Council basically
[1:24:17] arrested company reported all that the
[1:24:20] chief priests and Elders had s to them
[1:24:22] and when they had heard that they lifted
[1:24:23] up their voice to God with one
[1:24:26] Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which
[1:24:29] has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea
[1:24:30] and all that's in us who by the mouth of
[1:24:32] thy servant David has said why did the
[1:24:35] Heathen rage and why did the people
[1:24:36] imagine vain things the kings of the
[1:24:38] earth stood up up and the rulers were
[1:24:40] gathered against the Lord and against
[1:24:42] his Christ now let's stop right there
[1:24:43] you see what they're doing they're
[1:24:45] applying the scripture from uh Isaiah 52
[1:24:48] and 53 to their day the rulers of the
[1:24:51] world had risen up against them because
[1:24:54] now they got the Christ now they got the
[1:24:55] Holy Ghost amen they're looking in the
[1:24:57] scripture and saying my we're filled
[1:24:59] with the Holy Spirit we got the promise
[1:25:00] of God but now the earth and the kings
[1:25:03] of the Earth are starting to rise up
[1:25:04] against us amen so in other words
[1:25:07] they're finding themselves in the word
[1:25:08] of God how many you want to find
[1:25:10] yourself in the word of God tonight so
[1:25:12] see they recognize the word of God for
[1:25:14] our day we believe the report of Jesus
[1:25:17] Christ we believed he's the Messiah we
[1:25:19] believe he sent in the Holy Ghost and
[1:25:20] now we're getting
[1:25:22] persecuted amen
[1:25:25] verse 27 for of a truth against thy holy
[1:25:28] Child Jesus whom thou has appointed or
[1:25:30] anointed I'm sorry but he's been
[1:25:31] appointed to anointed both with Herod
[1:25:33] and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and
[1:25:35] the people of Israel were gathered
[1:25:37] together for to do whatsoever thy hand
[1:25:39] and thy counsel determin before to be
[1:25:41] done and now here here's the prayer they
[1:25:44] just got off they got off from being
[1:25:47] arrested and they come and have a big
[1:25:49] prayer meeting
[1:25:51] right I love it and brother man said
[1:25:53] this is what we should pattern after if
[1:25:56] not we'll get complacent we've got it
[1:25:58] all we got the message we're happy the
[1:26:00] way we are this is how we should respond
[1:26:02] to God when we go through trials we
[1:26:04] should come out of the trial wanting
[1:26:05] more of God and now Lord verse 29 behold
[1:26:08] their
[1:26:09] threats and Grant unto thy servants that
[1:26:12] with all boldness they may speak thy
[1:26:14] words so they must the law some boldness
[1:26:16] so they pray say God grant it that we'll
[1:26:19] be all full of all boldness in other
[1:26:22] words restore our first love amen
[1:26:25] restore our first boldness restore our
[1:26:27] first Zeal for God Amen and the only
[1:26:29] been filled the Holy Ghost maybe a few
[1:26:31] months here who knows I don't know the
[1:26:32] exact time

[1:26:38] heal and that signs and wonders may be
[1:26:40] done by the name of thy holy Child

[1:26:46] just get out of jail basically and they
[1:26:48] say Lord help us to have that first
[1:26:50] boldness that we
[1:26:52] had and stretch forth your hands and do
[1:26:54] signs Miracles and wonders amongst us
[1:26:57] and when they had prayed the place was
[1:26:58] shaken when they were all assembled
[1:27:00] together and they were all filled with
[1:27:01] the Holy Ghost and they spake the word
[1:27:03] of God with boldness so see they got the
[1:27:05] answer to their prayer they prayed for
[1:27:06] boldness and God gave them boldness amen
[1:27:09] God heard their prayer from heaven and I
[1:27:11] believe God will hear our prayers from
[1:27:13] Heaven as well let's stand to our feet
[1:27:14] by God's
[1:27:16] grace this is what brother Ram said with

[1:27:22] needs and is just as good as the
[1:27:24] original Church well how come the
[1:27:26] original Church cried out for more of
[1:27:28] God and acted like they didn't have all
[1:27:30] they needed see we need to act like we
[1:27:33] don't have all that we need we need to
[1:27:36] act like we need more of God you see and
[1:27:39] that's a true sign you're a book of Acts
