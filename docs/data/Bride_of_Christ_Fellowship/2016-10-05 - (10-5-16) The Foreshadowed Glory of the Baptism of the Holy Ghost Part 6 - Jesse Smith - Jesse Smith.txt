we'll sing maybe one or two more songs by the grace of God so we're all set by God's grace we got the wine and the the bread and we just have to fill up the buckets here a little bit but very happy to have communion tonight for brother amen praise God but I just love the fact that he asked me can we do it on a Wednesday night I said Glory I love that some of you might say well it's okay if I don't take communion I really like a real humble sincere heart that wants to take communion praise God and wants to partake of the Lord's Supper I really I really thank God that that's a real privilege a real blessing amen Charlie fewer better things we could ask for during the minut a week than the Lord suffer yes amen having suffer with communion with the Lord amen it's real blessing praise God Amen

last three days the baby's been keeping her up all night you know teething so when she teethes she kicks all night and my wife can't sleep and so she has it wakes up with a headache and laid in bed

deliver from that praise the Lord let's just take those needs before the Lord there any other requests that maybe didn't get written down anybody on their heart tonight amen um something similar to

here tonight Lord and I pray you be with us in a special way in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen amen praise God I take our Bibles tonight let's go to Colossians chapter one I like to continue on the Holy Ghost series here tonight amen I want to title this the foreshadow glory of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I want to preach on that tonight amen the foreshadowed glory of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so let's go to Colossians chapter one verse 25 I said I'm G to kind of make it like more of like a Bible study little preaching you know I got the quote for everything I'm gonna say tonight by God's grace as far as I have planned God could do his own work there but uh that's my plan right now that's how I'm feeling LED I didn't plan on preaching this this morning it just kind of came to me this afternoon so I quickly wrote it down and and quickly studyed as quick as I can I had a whole different sermon I thought i' preach tonight I'm trusting it's the leading of the Lord amen Colossians 125 25 amen verse 25 wherefore I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given for me to you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which have been hid from the ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily the work of God works mightily in Paul I want to read one more scripture Gans 3:8 here's a scripture where we look at see where the Bible said the foreshadowing notice I use the word foreshadowing Bible uses the word forese doesn't actually use the word foreshadow I looked it up but it used the word forese let's read this together Galatians 3:8 let's begin on 3 1 2 3 and the scripture foreing that God would justify the Heathen through faith preach before the gospel unto Abraham saying in the shall All Nations be blessed may God has blessing reading his word may be SE so I'm taking I'm putting these two scriptures together like I said I want to preach on this is part six uh Lord willing uh this Sunday I want to preach again on the Holy Ghost keep laying this uh laying these truths in here and uh I believe it's going to do something for us amen I don't believe God's word ever Goes Forth in vain I always believe it has a purpose that it will accomplish praise God so I'm trusting that God will do great things here for us sometime soon with these sermons on the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen praise God uh so our first scripture showed that the preaching of the Holy Ghost was a mystery hidden from the ages and the Mystery was Christ in you the hope of glory so the whole Hope Of Heaven is that Christ could come in his children amen that is the hope of Heaven it's the hope of glory amen and then the Bible said in Galatians 38 that the scripture foresaw that God would justify the Heathen through through faith so let's look at this thought just briefly the scripture foretold in Hosea and Isaiah and Genesis different places that God was gonna forgive the Heathen and he would bring all the Heathen into his name and into his fold and so forth so if if the scripture foretold God would justify the Heathen then don't you think the scripture foretold he would sanctify the Heathen and then don't you think the scripture for told that he filled the Heathen with the Holy Ghost amen praise God one of the most obvious ones uh that we can clearly see uh would would be in Ezekiel 20 or 36 let's go to Ezekiel 36 like I said I wanted to go to the scripture and uh kind of stay in there by the grace of the Lord Ezekiel 3626 26 and 27 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you in heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them praise God now here's a beautiful foreshadowing of the three works of Grace how many know those three works of Grace justification is the new heart sanctification is a new spirit sanctifies the spirit your habits your thinking your thoughts and then my spirit or God's spirit is the third work of Grace so he gives you a new heart then a new spirit then he gives you his Spirit but notice what the new spirit does it causes you to keep the Commandments we can't keep the Commandments of God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll fall short every time you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost that causes you uh to keep the Commandments it guides you uh uh the Bible said it's the spirit of Truth praise God uh it's the guide It's the comforter praise God Amen it's the advocate inside of you the lawyer inside of you and he's trying to persuade you to obey the word amen if you're obedient child you will praise to God because he's The Advocate he's a lawyer there uh sharing the scripture with you amen now I want to go now if I can that's just a simple one that's a real simple one and we'll get to it later in Jeremiah where it says the same thing God was done he was tired of writing the word on tables of stone he wanted to write the word on fleshly tables of the heart amen we'll get to that one eventually but the first one I got nine of them I want to go through the night so should go kind of fast nine of them so I need some readers here by God's grace but I want to show you all these types and these are just the ones that came to me in the last few hours that before we got here by God's grace so uh let's go if we again first of all let's go to acts 15 acts five and Mark 18 so Malachi acts 15 and brother Benjamin can you get Mark 18 brother is that okay thank you sir so acts 15 and then Mark 18 let's just read these here by the grace of God okay so Malachi when you're ready acts 15 for John the baptized water shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days amen are those red letter words on your Bible Mali praise God who's saying that the Lord Jesus so I want to see the foreshadowing of the glory so this is called a baptism what do baptism mean it means an immersion so picture somebody at a dunking tank and they know the ball hits the tank and they fall down they're immersed in water or you do a cannon ball if you're off your diving board you're totally when you go under you're totally immersed underwater and that's what Jesus said it's like now not silliness like those kind of things but it's a spiritual immersion of your soul and the Holy Ghost is covering your soul amen I'll say like that it's covering your soul brother Benjamin Mark 18 sir I indeed have baptized you with water but he said bze you with the Holy Ghost amen thank you sir so John the Baptist for told it he said I'm just put putting you in natural water like we talked about the dunk tank and and and and so for like that he just I'm just this is it's good it's right it's good to be baptized but he's going to baptize you in a different way amen it's going to be a spiritual immersion in the Holy Ghost your soul is going to be immersed in the Holy Ghost amen so it's going to be protecting you and that's why brother Bram said Satan can't get in he said that he can't make you sin he said you got to go out so you got to stop operating and deciding from the soul and you got to go out to the human Spirit or the Flesh in order to sin he said because Satan can't get into your soul because it's sealed by the Holy Spirit I will get to that eventually but it gives you the idea the immersion is totally immersed in the love of God in the spirit of God now go to 2 Kings 5 verse 9 you know the story but we're just going to hit it here's a beautiful type and I'll read the quote when we get there uh brother BR reads this quote 2 Kings 5 so the the the glor the foreshadowing of the Holy Ghost the glory of it is right here in 2 Kings chapter 5 it's also in chapter 4 which we read last Wednesday night but here's the glory now you know the story non uh uh the the ruler here he needs a healing he's C he's getting covered in leprosy leprosy always represents sin and Le and leprosy is an incurable disease right except for Christ amen right so let's go to verse uh nine so non came with his horses and with his chair and stood at the door of the House of Elisha and Elisha sent a messenger on him saying go and wash in the Jordan seven times now look the prophet wouldn't even look at him face to face why because he's a gentile he's a he's a Jew right so now that he could have taken that as a dis Act of disrespect he could have but look that was God's provided way now he says go and wash in the Jordan seven times in verse 10 and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean but non was WTH so the prophet's instructions made him upset and went away and said behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord is God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper now look what he thought he had this all worked out this some of you planners some of you taipe people that like to plan everything out he had this in his mind okay I'm GNA go to the prophet's house the prophet's gonna walk out and say thus sayi the Lord let the power of Heaven come down and heal him in God's name in the name of Jehovah right Jehovah Gyra and but because it didn't come the way he wanted he got upset and we got to be careful that we don't get upset with God if it don't come the way we want it to come amen praise God he said I thought see how our thinking our planning sometimes gets in God's way sometimes God does use us to plan like Solomon planned out a temple took seven years to build that's good planning that was Holy Ghost planning praise God but here this was the wrong planning he thought well it's got to happen this way and God said I'm not doing it your way you need to Humble Yourself Praise Goden all right now verse 12 are not abana and farar rivers of Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel they not washing them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage can you imagine the word of God making somebody so upset that they won't turn away and say that that Prophet I can't believe he said that to me who knows what he said I'm not gonna say anything who knows what he said but it caused him the word of God the directions for for the healing of leprosy made him so upset he turned and let the church as fast as he could verse 13 and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather than when he said to thee wash should be clean so look he needed somebody to come by and help him sometimes church if you see somebody that's not right with God sometimes you're the one supposed to go try to correct them amen praise God Amen these are lower these are servants these are not great men are you with me Church Great Men amongst us or great women amongst us even the humble even the humblest can correct that we those we might call Great praise the Lord and the humble ones come up and say well he didn't ask you to do something great he's asking you to do something humble and it starts convicting him look at the power of humility amen look at the power of Correction it can bring some some upset rage rage filled anger-filled person down to humility and obedience just by a word of Correction a word of Holy Ghost wisdom by verse 14 look look Humes himself then he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan according to the saying to the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the Flesh of a little child and he was clean and he returned to the man of God and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now I know that there is no God in all the Earth but in Israel now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of thy servant and you know the story he wouldn't take one and the servant takes one he gets me with Le leprosy okay now let me read you this quote here brother B says in perseverance 19 63 he said now people the way they want to get this or get healed and get the Holy Spirit the way they think they ought to have it then now I'll come down brother if you'll bring me up and take me into a room where nobody can see me lay your hands upon me and bless me and put the holy ghost on me and I'll accept it he saids oh no see people come to church and they want they want to get the Holy Ghost they want to be baptized the way they want to be baptized or they want to speak in tongues or they want to do this the way they want to do it but it doesn't come your way it comes God's way yes amen but said non now look he types his holy ghost to non he said non wanted to accept his healing like that one time but Elisha told him to go out there in the old mudy Jordan and dip seven times I can see him get out of his Chariot oh a great man hold his nose here he comes out of the water tiptoeing like a cat in molasses coming out you know getting out down the water he said oh I hate to do this hot down down he says some people comes to the altar like it's a sickening Affair to them yeah I don't want to do that now look he says name went down there like this tiptoeing can you imagine a tiptoeing to Ser man great man I don't want to get the stinky water it was dirty water it was filthy water but God said go the humble way go the way of humility humble yourself go my provided way am but he did it anyway so I say brother lik that to the altar people don't want to come to the Altar and pray amen hallelujah he sees drawing a tight this was a foreshadowing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he says it on he goes on again he says it this next in the cruelity of sin 1953 he said now you mean to say brother Ram you mean I have to get down there and get filled with the Holy Ghost and carry on like the rest of them he said if you expect to be with the rest of them you do that's all glory he said non had the same thing God told the prophet tell him go go down there and dip seven times he said isn't this water cleaner and better but it was it but it was that water of Jordan it looks pretty bad sometimes amen doesn't look pretty bad to get down here and cry and snot uh and have you know tear stains on your shirt praise the Lord and snotting and blowing your nose doesn't that look pretty awful sometimes it doesn't look as dignified as when they go to the the priests in the denominations and and they all bow and they all shake hands and they they're all dressed beautifully and it's all routine and all this not we'd say false religion and traditions of men it looks dirty but it's God's provided way Amen brother said this is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the only thing that cures the incurable sin disease amen glory are you with me church so Jesus said it' be a baptism so here's a baptism in the Old Testament foreshadowing the glory of the baptism to come oh glory amen amen hallelujah brother R said so you you see that by God's grace this is a foreshadowing taking away all all trace of sin all trace of leprosy that incurable flesh eating disease we'd say of sin that just eats and consumes you amen now stay there in your Bibles uh but go to the previous chapter 2 Kings 4 we read this last Wednesday night oh this was a wonderful time in the Lord oh my last Wednesday night amen ah now keep your spot there but um brother Austin can you read acts 2:4 for us brother Austin acts 2:4 and everybody else will stay in 2 Kings 4 unless you you like flipping or you you know you got bookmarks or your hands want to hold those now let's look at the second the first foreshadowing was immersion or baptism of the Holy Ghost that was the first foreshadowing the second is filling and I got nine of them I'll try to get to them tonight okay brother Austin acts 2:4 and there were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen let's say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen now thank you brother Second Kings 4 verse 5 this remember this is last Wednesday night remember these beautiful types I was just so abused by this so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out so she pours out now this one vessel that she poured out of that type Christ praise God because one vessel was pouring into many empty vessels amen hallelujah and brother man said all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into who the church Hallelujah so we all get holy ghost power from one vessel from Jesus Christ amen the life in him is divided and sent down into many empty vessels glory amen verse six and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me at a vessel he said there is not a vessel more in the oil State then she came and told the man of God and and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou thy Children of the rest so this was a one vessel this one vessel was a pouring out and a filling and it was an inexhaustible Fountain we'll say like that an inexhaustible source of oil and that's Jesus Christ amen and he said I will baptize you with the Holy Ghost I will fill you with the Holy Ghost I'll do it amen praise God now let's look at another good one Genesis 26 I've never preached this in my life so here's the first time I've ever preached this 10 years or 12 years of preaching 10 years of pastoring uh so I'm excited to preach it that's why I said that because I'm excited maybe you're not but I I am I God's grace because I never preaches amen glory I got the joy of the Lord amen Genesis 26 verse1 17 beautiful type here look at this beautiful type Isaac was uh working here and in order to be filled up he had to dig a little bit praise God he had to empty out empty out a little hole before he could get filled up how many believe that by God's grace amen Genesis 26 uh 17 2617 that's it now look this is uh Isaac here and Isaac departed then and pitches T the valley of gerar and dwelt there and Isaac digged again the wells of his father which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names of them by which his father had called them now look at this Isaac comes back to the place where his father worshiped praise God but because his father was gone on there was no more Ministry for the water to flow Oh Glory Hallelujah the old the old Ministry had passed on right just time and years and and and enemies had come up and and Men of God and risen and fall so the ministry of water was not flowing in this area anymore but Isaac recognized if we just dig out these Wells again if we revive the wells of our fathers amen if we dig out and if we live and do the same works of our fathers we'll get the same results amen we'll get the same Waters if we do the same digging praise Goden in other words I will restore sayith the Lord amen I'll restore all the Waters of your fathers amen he said I'll restore the faith of the fathers amen hallelujah it's exactly right and he called them the very same names that his dad called them amen hallelujah and these three whs represent the three works of Grace hallelujah amen that's that's my my revelation of it I'll say like that look at verse 19 and Isaac's servants died in the valley actually brother said the same thing sorry and found their well springing water and the Herdman of guer did strive with Isaac's Herman saying this water is ours and he called the name of the well esac because they stroll with him now notice Isaac does the work it's a work of Isaac uh but then and and springing waters are coming up but he doesn't they don't last very long so Isaac works this is the first work of Isaac and the church said amen so this is justification it brings uh Sweet Waters for a while but then Strife uh Strife comes and takes it away so he's got to go so this justification just lasts a little a little while and then he's got to move on to another work this is beautiful amen amen that work only lasts so long that he's got to move on to another work praise God isn't that what happens you get Justified get on fire with God and what turns off that fire a little Strife amen praise God Jesus said so he said there's four reactions when seeds fall on grounds amen the first one is that falls on the Wayside Satan snatches away the second one is persecution Strife amen you're persecuted because you receive the word you rejoice at first but then persecution comes and uh and there's no there's no root in the seeds amen so this shows what happens you've got to move on to the next work and church if if your Waters get stopped off move on to the next work praise God dig again praise God go back to where the fathers uh had faith and and virtue and powers and holy spirit blessings we need to go back to the old past I'm convinced the Holy Ghost will fall here when we get serious and start praying with God I'm not saying he hasn't fallen in special ways he has fallen in special ways I'm talking about those who want the Holy Ghost and if we want to see a real book of Acts a more book of Acts Movement by God's grace it'll happen when we start praying and digging out all this dirt out of our Lives amen praise God and getting serious with God hallelujah now verse 21 and they dig another well so now he's got to work again he had one wasn't one work enough no sir amen one work wasn't enough he's got to do a second work hallelujah amen and they dig another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitna verse 22 and he removed from then and died another well so the second well the second work was not enough he needs a third work of Grace amen hallelujah so he goes to the third and for that they strove not and he called the name of it riobo and he said for now the Lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land you see you can't bear the fruits of the Holy Ghost until you're born again of the Holy Ghost am amen that's exactly right and look there's no more striving after you're born again there's no more striving you because you love everybody Oh Glory Hallelujah You' got charity charity is the Holy Ghost in 1 Corinthians 13 right and charity hope withth all things believeth all things envieth not seeketh not her own praise God Amen it's time we must read it must be time we read that again sometime soon that's what the real Holy Ghost does there's no more striving no more fighting against flesh no more fighting against that you're now praying you're praying for your enemies you're loving people in the church if they don't love you you love them back anyway if you don't feel loved don't don't feel bad or isolated I found a scripture recently where Paul said he said the more I love the people the less they love me Glory it's in 1 Corinthians 16 he said the more I love them the less they love me and is that what brother brand the more he loved the people the more he was rejected right the more Jesus loved people and did Miracles then he preached the unless he was loved as well don't feel discouraged if you feel lonely or nobody loves me just get in God's presence you'll feel love and then he'll give you some human love pretty soon by God's grace some Christian love but don't that's how it always is brother Adam said God told him to walk with me you'll walk what alone so the more you love people guess what sometimes the more you've got to deal with not being loved uhuh amen praise God that's the scripture right there and it's always that it's always the end right right as you go on things get harder harder but we still stay in God's grace and there's room for all of us at the third well praise God there's room for everybody at the holy ghost's well amen here's where brother Bram says it now brother Braham calls this Jacob's well but it's actually Isaac's well okay so bam says this in 1959 what you went out to see he said you know Jacob dug a wh and the Philistines run away from it and called it malice he dug another well the Philistines run away from it so they call it stride he dug another well the third well he said there's room for us all brother said God dug a well in the Lutheran church and they all run the rest away from them but the Lutheran he dug a well at the Methodist Church for sanctification Luther was justification sanctification he dug a well and now they run all the way from it but now he's dug another well it ain't no names there's no more denomination it's just a pure Holy Ghost and there's room for us all amen hallelujah amen three works of Grace it takes three works three dying to yourself in order to have a well that there's room for us all Hallelujah to have Love At The Well of God where there's no Strife or malice but now I got love for even my enemies amen glory all right number three it's a fallen Malachi acts 8:16 please Malachi acts 8:16 the holy ghost is now a fallen a fire a falling of fire don't you love these foreshadowings of the Holy Ghost the foreshadow glory of the baptism of the Holy Ghost immersion filling praise God Amen so once Isaac dug it out what happened he's caught well and it filled up that hole it's a filling of the Holy Ghost how many believe that by God's grace immersion filling and now it's a falling of fire amen acts 8:16 okay as upon none of them only they baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus amen remember at remember in the Samaritan he hadn't fallen on them yet so it's a falling from Heaven these are all foreshadows of what it feels like now when you're born again you can relate with these by God's grace because you you've had the Holy Ghost fall on you you feel like your Soul's been immersed you feel like you're all filled up of God's spirit amen that's right these are all the foreshadowed glory this is the glory so when you read the Old Testament you can relate and say my I know what it's like to be like non to go down there and keep keep dipping keep immersing until I come and I've obeyed all the word of God and now my sin trouble's gone amen hallelujah there's no more unbelief in my soul my soul is immersed in the Holy Ghost praise God I want to keep all the word of God Amen all right now another one 2 Chronicles 7 let's go there 2 Chronicles 7 brother amen can you get this one 2 Chronicles 71-4 2 Chronicles 71-4 now this also happened in Moses is day uh but we'll have we'll have this read about Solomon here so whenever you're ready brother amen now when Solomon had made an end of praying fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the house and the priest could not entered into the house because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's House and when the children of Israel saw the how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces on the ground upon the pavement and worshiped praise the Lord saying for he is good and his mercy endureth amen thank you sir so remember Solomon built it for seven years remember he had Timbers dedicated to him he had all these Stones sent to him and there was not one sound of a buzz or a saw or anything like that remember it was all God chosen stones and God took all these chosen stones and brought them together and they fit perfectly like a puzzle into a temple amen and the Bible said we're fitly joined together as Lively Stones amen each one of those stones from different places from the north east south and west was like all the bride members coming into the body of Jesus Christ and when that's finished then the fire falls that's the Rapture amen hallelujah then the fire falls and the body is filled with the power of God and you watch the church then amen it's called the third pole it's called the latter rain Hallelujah but it's all got to be placed together each person has to be in the body of Christ a part of the temple and remember the temple at three courts justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost Body Soul I'm sorry Body Spirit Soul how many know that by God's grace Amen brother says this in 1954 oh God have mercy upon the audience of the people may the Holy Ghost fill this place now with a burning fire and the smoke of the holy spirit that come in the temple when Solomon dedicated and may the power of God surge through the people amen church we got to come to we got to come to church wanting this to happen that the fire of God would come down and surge through the place amen that we can pray that I can invite a brother to pray whoever the brother is and he'll pray that in his heart say God send the Holy Ghost like a fire like you did in Solomon's day amen where nobody can Minister nobody can preach it's all G to be praised with our faces down on the ground or our hands raised up or tears or so or worship words sacrifice of praise words where God gets all the glory amen number three Firefall praise God immersion filling the falling of Fire fire upon the people foreshadowed in the Old Testament amen the next one's a pouring out so let's go to this one acts 10:45 acts 10:45 brother Austin I'm sorry brother uh yeah Benjamin get acts 10:45 and then brother Austin um 1st Samuel 16:13 can you get that one 1st Samuel 16:13 and then brother Benjamin when you're ready uh acts 10:45 and they of the circumcision which believe were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the G Gentiles also was poured out of the gift of the only G amen praise God the pouring out so the Bible calls it a pouring out Hallelujah that's kind of we looked at like a shower remember we looked at the shower on Sunday uh by God's grace but this is a pouring out now I'm going to use this now tonight for pouring out of oil okay uh so brother Austin 1st Samuel 16:13 then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to amen so David gets down there right we always see the picture in our Bibles where he's kneel down there and Samuel's got a horn of Rams Horn of oil and he pours it out over David and the Bible said the spirit of the Lord came on him at that moment amen at the pouring out right and that's what Acts chapter 10 says he was poured out from Heaven upon Cornelius in Acts chapter 10 how many believe that's the Bible amen now this is also spoken of again in Psalms 22:22 so Malachi can you read psalms 22:22 and brother amen can you get Hebrews 2:12 this is again type now this is all through the Bible the pouring out of the oil in the midst of the Brethren so remember David was surrounded by his brothers right he had seven other brothers and there he is the eighth son and he's getting the oil poured upon him and eight represents eternity so there's Christ the Eternal son amen hallelujah amen and as baptism the Dove came down amen hallelujah he got born again Hallelujah so Malachi Psalms 22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee amen so see once he got anointed he could declare God's name unto his Brethren he's amongst his Brethren but he had to get anointed in in order to declare the name of God Church do our lives declare the name of Jesus Christ praise God it ought to David's did David got anointed and he declared God's name he went to Goliath what not in his name but in the name of Jehovah amen the name of almighty God our lives should declare the name of Jesus Christ to our co-workers our family our friends our mothers our fathers right everyone we come in contact to our our our life of God in us should declare the name of Jesus Christen amen okay uh Hebrews 2:12 brother amen saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren and in the midst of the church I will sing praise unto thee amen so look this was fulfilled in Christ this was speaking of Christ Christ declared the name of God because he was anointed in the midst of his brethen amen just like David did now here's what brother bam says in this great warrior David 1955 now David was called by election he was called elected anointed and placed elected by God he was called from sheep herting to be the king anointed and positionally placed he said you're not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire God had a desire for your life amen a calling as we heard on Sunday night with brother Gandy he said no man can come to me except the father draws in first first you were elected by God before the foundation of the world to be a Christian that's scripture no man can come except my father draws him he said the first thing you was elected or called then when God elected you then he called you and he heeded you to this call then he poured out the anointing oil on you the Holy Ghost he says what does oil represent in the Bible the Holy Spirit he said in a symbol form he said when he poured the oil on him he baptized him with the Holy Spirit in a SLE form I hope you get that he said he just poured the oil upon him it just went all over him a whole Horn of oil not sparingly amen it's the whole horn so he didn't spare any holy ghost He poured all the oil upon David amen and that's the way God pours the holy ghost on man not sparingly just baptizes him into it anointing him with the spirit amen now notice right there when that anointing struck him he was placed positionally as a king so see David when the anointing was on him he was called To Be a King but he wasn't a king yet praise God but he was going to go through trials to prepare him to be a king how many want to be a ruler Bible said you're a king or queen or priest right how many want to be a king or queen well that's a ruler you're called to be a ruler as well but you might not feel like it yet but let God take you through the process of be being ready to be a king or queen praise God you must go through that I think David ran I think if I'm not mistaken it was 12 12 or 15 years he ran from Saul before he was actually a king something a long that was like that it was over a decade or something so he was called King right after he was anointed but he didn't take the throne for a decade later amen sounds like sounds like Abraham you're G to have a son and two decades two and a half decades past and he still don't have one yet but what God's word was still true amen he just had to hang on to God's word amen it's not in our time it's not for us to figure out it's just for us to believe what God said about it amen David did it Abraham did it everybody did it Peter did it everybody had to wait upon the promise of God and then God would bring the word to pass as you remain faithful amen that's exactly right and when you're in your unfaithfulness he'll correct you and bring you back to the fold just like David amen now the next thing is the Holy Ghost is foreshadowed by new clothes let's go to that uh Luke 2449 so brother Benjamin you go to Luke Luke 2449 and then there's so many on this one we don't have the time to do all of it I'm just going to start skipping because we need to get to communion pretty soon uh but I think you'll understand the uh types and shadows the for shadow glory of the Holy Ghost Amen brother uh Benjamin can you read that please yeah 244 49 yes sir and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but ter ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high amen the word endued means clothed how many know that amen clothed you get new clothes the Bible said that's the righteousness of saints the fine linen that we wear when we come back from Armageddon after the marriage ceremony praise God and the marriage supper of the land we're clothed in fine Lin it's the righteousness or the purity of Christ amen well guess what if you're born again you're wearing that on your soul right now am hallelujah amen the Bible say we have eternal life now amen and that's the sign of life we're clothed with life clothe with his Holiness amen amen now 2 Kings 2:14 let's read that quickly 2 Kings 2:14 I I'll read that one here here's another new clothes Second Kings what we're in Second Kings quite a bit there's a lot of types of the Holy Ghost in Second Kings 2 4 and five man so 2 Kings 2 verse4 this is when Elijah left and Elisha gets a what a new mantle praise God remember Elijah said you watch me as I go to heaven you watch me and if you watch me then you'll get your double portion of the Holy Ghost praise God but you got to watch the prophet of God you got to keep your eyes on the prophet of God you get the time today you got we gotta keep listening to brother Brandon amen now verse let's go to verse n uh let's go to verse 10 though and he said thou has ask a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so now look is it an easy thing to get the the double anointing of the Holy Ghost no it's a hard thing he lets him know if you want a double portion of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're gonna have to labor for it how remember last Wednesday night service laboring for the Holy Ghost praise God you've got to work for it it's a you got to dig it out like Isaac did praise God it's a work it's digging out all your fleshly desires it's a crucifixion it's a work it's a labor amen and this is what Elijah told him it's going to be hard if you want to double anointing of the Holy Ghost but keep your eyes on me amen it's hard with all these things trying to get our attention out in the world it's hard right but we got to keep our eyes on the word of God amen amen take the eyes off everything else you got to put it in Airplane Mode put your phone in airplane mode and then you'll really be in a spiritual airplane mode amen you get in the spirit of God Amen start reading the word and praying worshiping praying and work listen to music giving God praise then you'll really get into airplane mode hallelujah amen now verse 11 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a charot of fire and Horses of fire and part of them both the Sun and Elijah went by a whirlwind into heaven and elishah saw and cried my father my father the charot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in pieces now look he's asking for a double portion of his spirit so he gets rid of his out outer garment his outer mantle he said I don't want to be wor wearing this anymore in other words I'm making ready I'm confessing all my sins I'm I'm taking off the old man can I get amen I'm taking off the old man I want to be clothed with something new praise God Amen it's exactly right look at the scripture here now verse 13 and he took up also the man of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the the bank of Jordan so he takes his mantle he said now I got new clothes let's see if these new new clothes work he said remember Jesus said you be clothed with what power amen so the Holy Ghost baptism is a new clothes and you got power in your life but look what he does with the power and he took the man of Elijah that fell from him and he smoked the water and said where is the Lord God of Elijah amen and when he had also smitten the waters they parted thither and thither and Elijah went over amen so he took that word and he wasn't afraid to use it amen hallelujah he said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah that's what we can do with the word of God with the name of Jesus Christ if it work for them it'll work for us amen we just got to take off our own clothes praise God the Bible said don't let your garments be spotted with sin that's that's what the Bible said you are supposed to hate is sin dirtying your garments the Bible says that hate even the garments spotted by the flesh the Bible says you should feel you should hate your sin when you sin praise God it's like having dirty clothes but rip it off and say I need a double anointing amen I need the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah now here's what brother man said when Elijah the old Prophet represented Christ Elisha the young Prophet followed him across Jordan when he come back he had a double portion so he said Elijah represented Christ Christ went up to heaven and who got the mantle of Christ the church Hallelujah didn't Peter seem like he had pretty good mantle on when he healed the healed the and raised the dead little girl didn't it look like he had a pretty good power there amen that's what we need praise God and Jesus said he said and the church followed Christ to Calvary and the mantle of Christ fell down with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Jesus said these things that I do shall you do also and even greater than this shall ye do and he said where is the god of Jesus Christ where is the god that made the promise in the Bible we need more Elijah we need more Believers in it we need more Believers in truth because there's been so many twisting Creeds it's an uncertain sound of the people I'm trying to tell you he said get back to the Bible amen isn't that beautiful church we need some more elijas that say where is Jesus Christ where is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what we need today amen and then strike it and watch it happen amen that's what we need today by God's grace remember every promise is based upon conditions praise God so he got into the right conditions use the word of God used the the Holy Spirit power on him and it it worked by God's grace and we see it happen when your faith is in the word of God it works amen amen glory now we don't have time but brother bam said when Joseph got the coat of the rainbow coat he said that was the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost said that in 1953 you say why because it was a rainbow color and if you go to Revelation 4:3 the Bible said Christ was ordained like a a rainbow the Bible said and he's the one that fills you with the Holy Ghost so it's a new garment new clothes uh so that represents the baptism of Holy Ghost all right are youall with me by God's grace that's the fifth one new clothes and Gideon got new clothes oh my you can you can start naming all the men that got new clothes and it represents the baptism of the Holy Ghost right number six I'm almost there number six we went over last Wednesday night the act of resting is is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's in Hebrews 4 let's go there Hebrews 4 and then Ruth 3:18 we read this last Wednesday night Hebrews 4:9 there remaineth therefore a rest for the people of God for he that has entered into his rest Heath also ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief remember Jesus said come unto me all you that weary heavy laden I'll give you what rest to your souls so it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul that's what the rest is and when brother said when you get the rest you stop your sinful habits you stop your worldly works and you cease from your works and now you do the works of the spirit amen now let's go to Ruth 3:18 this is what we didn't get to last week I just mention I read the quote but we didn't read it so let's go to Ruth Ruth is right before Samuel you find judges and Ruth Ruth 3:18 now if you know the story remember chapter one is Ruth getting Justified how many remember that she decides to follow Naomi and go the right path doesn't go back to a denominational moit worldly family second chapter is Ruth laboring brother BR said that's sanctification she's out working in the field she's looking for glean any any Soul she can glean from the field praise God and in chapter three she rests she rests until she's fully Redeemed by the kinsman redeemer brother that's the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the third chapter the third work of Grace oh beautiful amen she doesn't leave the house she don't go out there to labor anymore she's resting on the work of Boaz we're resting on the finished work of Calvary through Jesus Christ amen Ruth 3:18 I'll read that then she said sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day so God won't rest until we're fully redeemed praise the Lord and now in 1961 Revelation chapter 5 brother R says this he says now when Ruth was resting it's a type of the church resting in the promises of God we have the earnest now of our Salvation now listen we're not worried whether we're going over there or not we're going we're not worried if we're going to heaven or not we're going because we're resting on the promise of God amen amen he said God said so God promises we got the earnest which is the Baptist of the Holy Ghost it's done been received Christ has accepted us he's now now doing the kinsman redeemer work we have the earnest of right now waiting for the time that when he comes back in the Rapture amen glory he said then he goes the next thing was Ruth rewarded but then he goes through through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he said went into the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the last days and now resting with the earnest of our inheritance that we know that something happened to us we pass from Death un life amen don't you love that church oh this stirred me up amen all right next one the baptism of the Holy Ghost is like a writing or marking or ceiling Ephesians 4:30 let's read that real quick amen 1 Corinthians 3:3 brother amen can you read Ephesians 4:30 and then uh Austin can you read 1 Corinthians 3:3 I'm sorry Austin I think it's second Corinthians yeah okay brother amen uh Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of Amen now seal brother BR lik it under a train right the cars had to be sealed that's true we'll get to another one just a moment but uh that word actually means marked that's what the actual Greek word means you're marked unto the day of your Redemption hallelujah amen I love that I'm marked by God's presence okay now also in 2 Corinthians 3:3 s much of are manifest the Epistle of Christ ministered by us not living God Stone amen praise God okay so where where's the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ ministered the word of God and wrote it upon the fleshly tables of our heart how many can see that by God's grace it's written praise God now Exodus 2511 let's read that one here is here now a type of the Arc of the Covenant now here's a here's a type for the seal but there's actually two types in here that type the baptism Holy Ghost there two types for us uh Exodus 2511 and we could take a sermon on every each one of these separately you could take a sermon I'm just going through them quickly because I want you to see them I want to spend more of my time on the quotes in the New Testament baptism Holy Ghost myself that's just how I feel L but uh so you can see it when you read the Old Testament it becomes brother said it becomes a new Bible the Bible becomes a new Bible when you the message of the hour yes praise God amen glory now in verse 10 Exodus 25:10 and they shall make an ark of shamwood and that sham wood means AAA wood that's why we named AAA AAA because she we wanted her to be the house of the word of God that's what the ark was it was a house of the word and the rod amen and also the Mana amen they shall make an ark of and wood brother said it was shwood was Ood two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cub and half the breadth thereof and a cub and a half the height thereof and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without shalt thou overlay it and it shall make up upon it a crown of gold round about now I'm GNA stop right there brother say this about the Ark in 1955 this same sermon he mentioned the caseywood so I like the sermon he said the gold they just had to beat out the gold they got it hot and beat it the beater of the gold beat the gold you had to beat it with a hammer and they beat the gold to exceed is reflection it then get her hot and pour it all over the ark and it soaked into the wood praise God so the gold would soak into the out outside of the wood and also the inside of the wood amen hallelujah you understand what I'm saying the outside of the Ark was soaked in with gold and the inside was soaked in as well talk about sealed praise God Amen brother Rand said I don't have time to all this but brother R said the Ark of Noah had to be sealed with pitch and he tiped that to the baptism of the Holy Ghost so no water could get in amen had to be fully sealed Hallelujah are you with me he said the Arc of that Moses was put in that little Arc bull rush Arc he said that had to be sealed as well praise God Heen so the Bap of the Holy Ghost is liken unto a seal he says he said but when going back to the Ark of the Covenant when the Holy Spirit being the power Holy Ghost and Fire poured out upon the believer through the blood of Christ makes atonement for him he's safe from all Divine judgment he said he said it absolutely does include all sickness amen hallelujah so look at that he tipes it into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it shows the protection you're free from all Divine judgment because gold types deity as well amen and remember your Ark is typed by the heart right your heart the ark is a type of your heart so in your heart or we say in your soul you have to have the written word in there praise God and didn't Austin just read it for us the Holy Spirit writes the word what on the fleshly tables of our heart in our soul praise God amen amen and we'll get to the rod at at the end that's the last one I'm going to do the rod at the end I really got to hurry let's go to Jeremiah 31:33 oh my there's another one to Jeremiah 31:33 I might well let's see I think I'm going to stop at after this I'm going to stop after this one but God's great let's stop at Seven I like seven Seven's a good number that's a number of completion praise God three is perfection four is deliverance and five is Grace six is the number of man and Seven's completion praise God so ezek I'm sorry Jeremiah 3133 okay here's one we mentioned earlier but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord I will put my law in their in parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace remember this ties in with Ezekiel 36 remember writing the word upon the fleshly tables of the heart now this is quoted in uh Hebrews 10 but we're not going to go there but just take my word you look in your Bible Hebrews directly quotes this right from Jeremiah so the seventh and power a seventh we say the completion one is the cealing or marking let's go to one more uh Ezekiel chapter 9 go there by God's grace how we love the Lord tonight amen how many got joy in their heart tonight amen hallelujah the foreshadowed glory of the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh glory amen thank you Jesus this it did it all this for us it did all this for us it sealed us it marked us it helped us rest it clothed us it poured upon us it fell on us as fire it filled us and it immersed us amen oh hallelujah thank you Jesus last one Ezekiel chapter 9 verse one how we know the scripture the riter with the inkhorn now didn't the Bible just say we're going to write it with the ink upon the fleshly tables of the heart so this again types the baptism Holy Ghost he cried also mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand this is not a good situation people are about to get slayed here verse two and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lith toward the North and every man a Slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a Rider's inkhorn by his side and they went in and Stood Beside the braz and altar bra altar always represents death and judgment because that's the that's the AL where they all the animals were killed at the bra an altar okay verse three and the glory of the Lord God of Israel was gone up from upon the Cherub where whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the rider's ink horn by his side okay so there's six men and one of them's got a riter's inkor so the glory of God goes up and then there's a man with an inkor ready to write now what does he telling before judgment strikes verse four and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through theid of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry I'm sorry men that sigh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof amen so God said put a mark put a spiritual mark on those who are so burdened by sin that they sigh and cry over it amen that's why brother said when the Holy Ghost comes on him again he sigh and cries and booos and Carries On because it's so holy it makes you hate sin hallelujah amen amen is that right amen this is those who God marks and seals those who hate sin so much praise God that's why God will let somebody get away with mocking Sinners that's why God will let brother R get away uh uh that's why God let Elisha get away with calling down she Bears on children that mocked a prophet of God praise God Amen that's why God will let him get away with that or calling a Mrs dog meat right God will let them get away with that because they're filled with the Holy righteous indignation of the holy spirit amen amen they're living a separated holy life onto God and brother R said when you get so he said these things like cutting hair and makeup and and worldless he said they don't seem so bad down here he said but the higher you rise toward Heaven the more sinful it looks amen the closer other words the closer you get to the light the more the more sickness we'd say or the more the more bad the more evil Darkness looks I said like that amen is that right Church the closer you get up to God the closer you the closer you draw night to God the more awful sin is and God said before I destroy everyone in the city let's mark first those who sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city amen verse five and to others he said in M hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my where Sanctuary start at the church the church should know better the church should hate sin the church should always ball out sin he said start at my house because judgment begins at the house of God Amen God don't play around with sin God wants people that hate sin that are tired of sin that will confess sin and he'll mark them with the Holy Ghost if they hate iten amen praise God God does not play around with sin how many you believe that if you haven't sighed and cried for someone sin lately I encourage you start praying more amen you'll get so disgusted by sin you'll get so burdened and so grieved by sin you'll start sighing and crying for it that's the trouble we don't get far with God we're not sincere about Sin we just see it so much church we got to rise up higher in prayer and the way to do it is spend time on your knees in prayer spend time praying let's stop right there by God's grace now let's stand to our feet this was a type of course of Revelation chapter 7 remember remember God came down and said well the Angels came down and said hold those uh hold those angels that have the Four Winds the Four Winds of the earth remember that he said hold them until the Servants of God are sealed in their foreheads praise God and this Ezekiel 9 was had a has numerous types it was type before uh Titus destroyed Jerusalem in ad70 remember because all the Holy Ghost filled people were out of there four years before Titus killed anybody they were marked see by God they're protected because they hated sin and also it's going to be fulfilled in Revelation 7 with 144,000 God will Mark and seal all those who who really want the Holy Ghost so Mark and seal them Before Destruction comes amen because remember the earth and the Sea and the land cannot be hurt until the Servants of God are sealed in their foreheads how you believe that by God's grace what a blessing let's bow our heads here praise God sealed or marked the foreshadowed glory of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a cealing it's a marking I'm scrolling back it's a resting from your own works it's a new clothing it's a pouring out of oil or rain we'd say it's a fing of fire it's a filling after a digging out and it's immersion into water the washing of waters of the word now church tonight for communion at our church I don't force people to or I don't my my rule isn't well you have to feel like you're born again to have communion I feel like you can have communion as soon as you're Justified because the Bible said those who are Justified are already what glorified so all those who are truly Justified eventually will receive the baptis of the Holy Ghost so how could I one of those little ones uh communion with our Lord when God is going to finish the work that he started that's just my thought that's just my my instruction from you know Revelation Romans chapter 8 by God's grace so before we take communion let's have a moment here of prayer and Malachi can you turn back on the instrumental music let's just have that going since we don't have a musician here tonight well we do have amen but um I like him to he he's here to partake of community by God's grace
