[1:06] i'm sure they're going to need the grace
[1:07] of god tonight i'd like to
[1:09] we're willing to try to get into uh
[1:12] the more difficult aspect of this
[1:16] topic
[1:16] by the grace of god so i surely need
[1:19] god's love and
[1:20] i should i need to grace the lord here
[1:24] but i know i know it's important to
[1:25] preach you know impacts uh like i said

[1:31] it impacts our current church situation
[1:33] by god's grace which we're grateful for
[1:35] all the saints praise god so just
[1:37] something and i think i got three or
[1:38] four people contacting me monday and
[1:40] just said how much they appreciated the
[1:41] service
[1:43] so
[1:45] you know
[1:47] as we just approached the word all of
[1:49] our questions all of our uh concerns are
[1:52] always dissolved by the holy spirit
[1:53] that's right
[1:54] there's always going to be things we
[1:55] don't know like the new name and the day
[1:58] or the hour there's always going to be
[1:59] things we don't know but for simple
[2:01] bible questions thank god that we have
[2:03] the holy spirit for answers praise god
[2:04] amen
[2:05] so again tonight's going to be kind of
[2:07] teaching
[2:09] but i got some good thoughts i'm going
[2:10] to do some preaching next week by god's
[2:11] grace i really want to build your faith
[2:13] next week but i thought well let me
[2:14] hopefully i can finish this thought here
[2:15] tonight my god's great so acts 17 26 if
[2:18] you got your bibles try to preach for an
[2:20] hour maybe maybe a little more we'll
[2:22] kind of see how it goes here
[2:28] acts 17 26
[2:35] god's love encompasses the nations
[2:37] praise god
[2:39] as we recall his eyes run to and fro
[2:41] upon the whole world he doesn't leave
[2:43] one nation out he doesn't leave
[2:46] any skin color out praise god god is see
[2:48] he loves all the skin colors god he
[2:50] loves all the nations he goes around the
[2:52] world trying to find someone he can show
[2:53] himself strong
[2:55] i heard a preacher say i like the uh
[2:57] baptist preacher i heard him say
[2:59] uh
[3:00] he said god is always recruiting right
[3:03] in the military they have recruiting
[3:04] officers he said god is constantly the
[3:06] main recruiting officer praise god and
[3:08] he use that scripture god's always
[3:10] looking for people around the world
[3:11] someone he can recruit to show himself
[3:13] powerful how do you want to be that
[3:14] praise god
[3:16] i know you signed up already praise god
[3:18] you've been enlisted for a number of
[3:19] years thank god and we just got someone
[3:21] listed last year by god's grace
[3:23] thank the lord for that praise god
[3:25] in church just be patient with the lord
[3:26] you know god he trains men for years to
[3:29] to get them to accomplish his purpose in
[3:31] their life
[3:32] john the baptist had 30 years of
[3:34] training for six months of ministry
[3:38] abraham had 75 years of training for
[3:40] about 100 years of ministry moses 80
[3:42] years of training for 40 years
[3:46] joseph well third he has 17 years with
[3:49] his family 13 years of training for his
[3:51] ministry so god help us to be patient
[3:54] god help us be patient amen remember the
[3:56] best is always yet to come praise god
[3:59] amen god has a certain ring a certain
[4:01] testimony for for your life and so you
[4:04] serve we serve god patiently waiting on
[4:06] him trusting believing all the word god
[4:08] will accomplish what he wants to
[4:09] accomplish
[4:10] acts 17 26
[4:13] notice one blood see there's one blood
[4:14] there's only one blood praise god and
[4:16] the life is in the blood praise god
[4:18] so let's read that verse together then
[4:20] we'll have you be seated here one two
[4:22] three and have made of one blood all
[4:25] nations of men for to dwell on all the
[4:29] face of the earth and have determined
[4:31] the times before appointed and the
[4:34] bounds of their habitation now i'm going
[4:37] to read 27 so god determined where
[4:39] you're going to live why
[4:41] verse 27 that they should seek the lord
[4:43] so god placed a man here in akron
[4:46] god placed him in akron here so they
[4:48] would find the lord
[4:50] god placed the saints in ghana so they
[4:51] would find the lord
[4:53] god placed each and every one of us in
[4:55] our place so we would find the lord
[4:57] that's why i did it praise god and it's
[4:59] all men the bible says
[5:02] the bible says if happy they might feel
[5:04] after him so he gave everyone a chance
[5:06] and find him though he be not far from
[5:09] every one of us think of that universe
[5:10] picture from last week
[5:12] sometimes it seems like god is across
[5:13] the universe but the bible says he's
[5:15] very close to us
[5:17] you may be seated god bless you may god
[5:19] is blessing to read his word praise god
[5:24] um i like to uh i won't show quotes yet
[5:27] but i'll eventually get to them and some
[5:29] scriptures but we covered uh sunday how
[5:32] uh we have to really recognize the
[5:33] opinions of brother branham and i
[5:35] believe and i think you believe too
[5:37] that the interracial marriage
[5:39] ban brother had brother branham was
[5:40] against this you know he was against
[5:42] interracial marriage we believe that was
[5:43] his opinion he never said thus saith the
[5:45] lord and what i've found so far i've
[5:48] never seen him use the scripture
[5:50] he never used a scripture it was because
[5:52] of the cultural
[5:54] uh context that he was living in which
[5:56] i'm going to get into tonight i'm going
[5:57] to show some pictures too so uh
[6:00] i'm going to be careful of the children
[6:02] which ones i show you know and what i
[6:03] exactly say
[6:05] because they're young and we want them
[6:08] to be
[6:09] just as innocent as possible by god's
[6:10] grace but we looked at bible teaching we
[6:13] saw five old testament examples where
[6:15] god ordained interracial marriage god
[6:17] did
[6:18] and then i looked at that one i like
[6:20] that one in timothy in the new testament
[6:22] now remember paul said timothy was more
[6:23] like-minded than him than anyone else no
[6:26] one was more like the prophet than
[6:28] timothy and he was a byproduct of an
[6:30] interracial marriage
[6:32] i imagine timothy was shouting when he
[6:34] read that by god's grace
[6:36] wow i'm the most like the prophet you
[6:37] know i'm sure he didn't ask for
[6:38] compliments right like we don't ask for
[6:39] compliments because you know we we don't
[6:41] go seeking compliments we just want
[6:42] god's love in god's favor
[6:44] imagine he was shouting and i imagine
[6:46] that he shouted when he read ephesians 1
[6:47] 4 that says i was chosen in him before
[6:50] the foundation of the world
[6:53] i hear you and then i believe he was
[6:55] shouting when he read acts 17 praise god
[6:57] where god determined my dad would be a
[6:59] greek and my mind would be a jew god
[7:01] determined brought them together and
[7:03] brought me and i got filled with the
[7:04] holy ghost and i'm a son under the
[7:06] prophet praise god that's who we are
[7:08] amen we're sons and daughters under the
[7:10] prophet's ministry praise god
[7:13] prophet brother branham amen hallelujah
[7:15] and of course the prophet paul had to
[7:16] say like that
[7:18] that's not literally like timothy but
[7:20] spiritually praise god because we're
[7:22] preaching the same gospel amen
[7:25] so uh we looked at the positive quotes
[7:27] brother brahm said about zipporah and
[7:29] moses all positive i could not find one
[7:31] negative quote about zephora and moses
[7:34] it was all positive
[7:35] so it seemed like when uh it seemed like
[7:37] this was just a topic that god didn't
[7:39] maybe reveal to brother branham
[7:41] no doubt because of the legal aspect of
[7:42] it probably no doubt because of that and
[7:44] also to protect people in that day
[7:47] because as you'll see if there was
[7:48] interracial couples in certain areas
[7:50] they were
[7:52] they they could be attacked
[7:54] by hateful people i know some of these
[7:56] things are going to be really hard to
[7:57] say tonight it's hard for us as
[7:58] christians to understand that but satan
[8:00] has so gripped people's hearts they have
[8:02] such hatred toward people it's really an
[8:04] advanced stage of pride of life it's an
[8:06] advanced
[8:07] form of pride that someone could have
[8:09] such hatred
[8:11] but there were i mean it's not like it
[8:12] was everybody but there was a small pac
[8:14] packets or pockets of it today just like
[8:16] today
[8:17] a lot of people are very most people
[8:19] don't go to jail today most people are
[8:21] law-abiding citizens but there's pockets
[8:23] where uh say like this where demons are
[8:25] territorial
[8:27] and they'll anoint people with hatred
[8:29] hearts and violent hearts and it's so
[8:31] sad but we're to be the light in the
[8:33] darkness amen and we are by god's grace
[8:35] amen
[8:36] but i believe that explains it if you
[8:38] look at the cultural context but i first
[8:40] want to look at a few scriptures here
[8:43] uh to kind of get us uh
[8:45] uh
[8:46] here on the word of god we looked at
[8:47] those examples okay here we are okay
[8:50] now uh we saw there's one blood of
[8:52] people on the earth
[8:54] so that proves interracial marriages are
[8:56] not hybrid because they're not two
[8:58] separate bloods
[8:59] right they're not two different seeds
[9:01] there's the same blood same seed it's
[9:03] called human seed
[9:05] praise god and they can reproduce a
[9:07] hybrid is one that cannot reproduce
[9:09] itself again like a donkey
[9:11] i just heard brother graham say it today
[9:12] lebron said he said don't blame the
[9:14] donkey on god
[9:17] he said god wouldn't make a donkey
[9:18] laying the donkey on man amen
[9:21] it's hybrid
[9:22] it can't reproduce itself back praise
[9:24] god
[9:25] so if you look at the bible you'll see
[9:26] the bible's plain
[9:28] that all the all mankind all humankind
[9:31] have one blood
[9:32] one seed that produces them praise god
[9:34] and so there's there's there's no
[9:36] teaching on it in the bible praise god
[9:39] uh and so all human blood all human seed
[9:41] is the same seed because it reproduces
[9:44] now remember the bible puts no
[9:46] difference between any race on the earth
[9:48] in the new testament
[9:50] the bible said there's no difference
[9:52] romans 10 12 between the jew and the
[9:54] greek the same lord over all is rich
[9:57] unto all that call upon him amen amen
[9:59] god is rich to the jew god's rich to the
[10:01] gentile he's rich to the light he's rich
[10:03] to the black he's rich to the yellow
[10:05] brother says rich to the brown amen he's
[10:07] written mercy to all of them praise god
[10:10] amen whosoever shall call upon the name
[10:12] of the lord shall be saved
[10:14] galatians 3 6-29 says the same you're
[10:16] all children of god by faith in christ
[10:18] jesus there's neither jew nor greek
[10:21] i bet i bet timothy was saying amen on
[10:23] that one right because he was dead his
[10:24] dad was great
[10:26] neither bond or free slave or not now
[10:28] we're getting to that too slavery
[10:30] history of slavery
[10:32] there's neither male nor female for you
[10:34] are all one in christ jesus amen
[10:38] now romans 2 16 says god will judge the
[10:41] secrets of men by jesus christ according
[10:44] to paul's gospel that's right
[10:46] and paul's gospel does not contain a
[10:48] prohibition on interracial marriages
[10:52] it only says you marry in the lord
[10:55] and it only says you marry when you have
[10:57] no living spouse
[10:59] praise god that's what we judge by so
[11:01] see so many message people live in fear
[11:04] it's because they i mean and this is sad
[11:06] they listen to tapes more than they read
[11:07] the bible
[11:10] right
[11:11] now you got to do bowls but brother and
[11:13] i asked for the ramble how do you want
[11:14] to grow in the lord he said read your
[11:15] bible and pray amen amen
[11:18] we should listen to taste we do
[11:20] praise god
[11:22] but see the
[11:23] the trouble happens when people get
[11:25] unbalanced and they worship a man or
[11:28] they worship a tank more than they
[11:30] worship jesus amen
[11:32] all worship though goes to jesus
[11:36] remember galatians 1 6-12 says anyone
[11:39] who changes one word is cursed
[11:43] right
[11:44] so people that don't understand this you
[11:45] know
[11:46] uh they if they're dogmatic about it
[11:48] they're in great danger
[11:50] now there's only one thing i can find
[11:53] one scripture about skin color that's in
[11:54] the song of solomon one verse five and
[11:57] six where the shula might now she was a
[11:59] jew but she worked outside so much that
[12:01] her skin was really dark
[12:03] and she thought that might hurt
[12:04] solomon's opinion of her because she
[12:06] wasn't royalty but solomon when they got
[12:08] engaged and everything he says you're
[12:10] all beautiful amen from the top to the
[12:13] head all the way down to the feet you're
[12:15] all beautiful praise god amen so see
[12:18] skin color was just something that
[12:19] individuals may have had
[12:22] apprehension about but to god it never
[12:24] mattered to solomon didn't matter praise
[12:26] god and to any believer it doesn't
[12:28] matter praise god
[12:29] it's not about your outside condition
[12:31] it's about the inside condition
[12:36] and again if i'm wrong somebody show me
[12:37] in the bible where i'm wrong by paul's
[12:39] gospel and i'll be waiting a long time
[12:41] because nobody will be able to do it by
[12:43] god's grace because i've already read
[12:44] the bible so many times right you have
[12:45] to
[12:48] all these years after the prophet praise
[12:49] god we know what the bible says
[12:51] now just remember galatians 5 9 and 10
[12:53] jesus's blood redeems every nation every
[12:57] tongue every kindred every people and
[13:00] not only that he redeems us he buys us
[13:02] back he makes us his possession but he
[13:05] makes us kings and priests unto god amen
[13:07] amen
[13:08] so in heaven there's going to be a king
[13:10] who's black
[13:12] there's going to be a king who's white
[13:15] there's going to be a king who's brown
[13:17] hopefully i'm one of them
[13:21] amen
[13:22] that's right church a king and queen a
[13:25] priest of god in every color every
[13:28] nation every tongue that's how god
[13:30] builds his royal priesthood
[13:33] and a hallelujah kingship
[13:35] amen the blood did that hallelujah the
[13:37] blood of jesus still does that amen amen
[13:40] hallelujah amen
[13:43] now
[13:45] let's uh
[13:47] that was pretty fast uh
[13:49] let's do some slides now here
[13:51] well that was to make us all thankful
[13:53] now i'm gonna start getting into the the
[13:55] more difficult things here so i know you
[13:57] love me just bear with me here
[13:59] i just feel like i need to cover it
[14:00] especially you know with austin lena how
[14:02] they love god so much and they've come
[14:03] across the nation to follow us i just
[14:06] think it's good for them by god's grace
[14:08] it's good for me too
[14:09] uh it's been a year since i've actually
[14:11] revisited this subject and numerous
[14:13] people have asked me about on youtube
[14:15] what do you think i just put small
[14:16] little um
[14:17] comments and i actually i actually use a
[14:19] video by jason demars we've had him
[14:21] before it's been years
[14:23] but he has a video about it as what does
[14:25] a really nice job on it uh and so i used
[14:27] his video a lot when i was preparing my
[14:29] video so i'm about halfway done with my
[14:31] video hopefully it'll be out end of this
[14:32] week or next week about interracial
[14:34] marriage so
[14:35] but you know whenever you get into these
[14:36] controversial subjects
[14:38] usually you get rejected
[14:40] remember when i i i don't know i didn't
[14:42] tell you this but when i put out that
[14:43] video about ministers marriage
[14:44] requirements all my views went down a
[14:46] lot of people unsubscribed so
[14:49] all right my page is a lot less popular
[14:51] it's growing very slowly now
[14:53] see because once you once people don't
[14:55] like what you're saying
[14:56] which is okay man
[14:58] that's normal
[15:00] but when you start taking a stand on
[15:01] things people don't like you don't like
[15:03] you done with you that's okay
[15:05] god has a purpose and god's word will
[15:08] not return void that's right
[15:10] amen like i'll never forget right after
[15:12] i posted that video about ministers
[15:13] marriage requirements i had a man say
[15:15] after i watched your video i felt the
[15:17] chains
[15:18] fall from me because i was a slave to
[15:20] that i was slave to that uh idea he said
[15:23] i felt like a huge burden was lifted off
[15:26] me i just want to tell you how much i
[15:27] appreciate that amen
[15:29] the church that's what we live for we
[15:30] live for the truth the truth always sets
[15:32] us free
[15:35] amen so that makes me unpopular well i
[15:37] never was popular to begin with so
[15:39] it just makes me less popular that's
[15:41] good for me right
[15:42] money women popularity but all those are
[15:44] less and less all the time now i'm
[15:45] getting closer to jesus all the time
[15:48] praise god
[15:49] let's look at the cultural context here
[15:51] now i'm not i'm a schoolteacher but i'm
[15:53] not a high school english i'm not a high
[15:55] school history teacher
[15:57] so i can only take you so far now
[15:58] malcolm could probably do a good better
[15:59] job than me on this history but
[16:01] um
[16:03] i just wanna i want to bring this quote
[16:05] on as well
[16:06] um a ban against interracial marriage
[16:09] does not exist from genesis to
[16:11] revelation but yet brother adam said
[16:12] every doctrine must go from genesis to
[16:14] revelation
[16:16] so here's where he says it i mean you're
[16:17] familiar with it you don't really have
[16:18] to read it but he said if every doctrine
[16:21] must come from the word not just one
[16:23] place just and
[16:25] and people on the side that they're
[16:26] against interracial marriage they have
[16:27] no scripture for
[16:29] they have none they just have quotes
[16:31] which if you understand the quotes it's
[16:32] because of the cultural
[16:34] violence and that cultural atmosphere of
[16:36] that time that's what i believe and of
[16:38] course the legal aspect of it
[16:40] and why because now look here's brother
[16:42] important scripture because in the mouth
[16:44] of two or three witnesses let every word
[16:45] be established
[16:47] now also but now with that thought i
[16:49] just want to throw this in here for our
[16:51] our church because we're we're trying to
[16:52] be mature we're supposed to be meat
[16:53] eaters right
[16:54] that's right don't be a spiritual
[16:56] vegetarian okay
[16:58] you can be a natural one if you want for
[16:59] a little while but you're missing out on
[17:00] some good stuff
[17:02] but let's not be spiritual vegetarians
[17:04] amen
[17:05] let's be spiritual me eaters amen now
[17:07] see most of the moral laws
[17:10] of the old testament remain in place in
[17:12] the new testament we're not under the
[17:14] law but many of those laws are actually
[17:17] still morally right or wrong in the new
[17:19] testament that's right like the ten
[17:21] commandments i prove that by the bible
[17:22] it's in my first book
[17:24] the bible said we keep the righteousness
[17:27] of the law so anything that was
[17:28] righteous in the law is kept today by
[17:30] the holy spirit that's right
[17:33] so murder adultery abominations modesty
[17:35] all those things everyone in the old all
[17:37] the moral laws carry over now the jewish
[17:39] ceremonial and sacrificial laws like the
[17:42] priesthood laws they were all fulfilled
[17:44] by christ and no longer required
[17:47] okay so those don't run genesis of
[17:49] revelation those just run genesis to
[17:50] malachi
[17:52] now we're no longer under the curse of
[17:54] the law because jesus took our curse
[17:56] amen
[17:57] the curse was if you break one you're
[17:59] guilty of all and you deserve the
[18:01] punishment of all but jesus took that
[18:03] curse on the cross saying that that's
[18:05] why we were across this sometimes
[18:07] amen because that cross took our targets
[18:10] amen
[18:11] and now we're not cursed we're blessed
[18:15] amen
[18:16] amen
[18:19] now uh i want to say a few things here
[18:20] before we get into the context you're
[18:22] going to see that our nation has come a
[18:23] long way in liberty and freedom
[18:26] because slavery was abolished in 1863
[18:29] others other civil civilizations like
[18:32] roman empire never got rid of it
[18:35] and i read a stat today on the website i
[18:37] think it was britannica
[18:39] one out of every five romans in the
[18:41] roman empire was a slave can you imagine
[18:43] that 20 of the population would have
[18:45] been slaves
[18:46] that's awful
[18:49] and it was never abolished now look in
[18:51] america yeah we started wrong but look
[18:53] where we've got by god's
[18:54] grace hallelujah
[18:57] and why is that because of the baptism
[18:59] of the holy ghost
[19:01] praise god amen that's why
[19:03] another nation is like that praise god
[19:06] and if they are they followed our
[19:07] example that's right because america was
[19:10] the beast out of the earth now it
[19:12] started off real good like a lamb
[19:14] right but now it's turning into a dragon
[19:16] but start off good brother
[19:18] you got that
[19:20] real cute like real beautiful like a
[19:22] lamb real innocent pure founding fathers
[19:24] amen that's right hallelujah they wrote
[19:27] a document that's still 250 some years
[19:29] later it's the one constitution most
[19:32] countries go through like 20 or 30 or 40
[19:34] constitutions we've only had one because
[19:36] they were anointed with the man
[19:37] anointing to give us truth hallelujah
[19:39] amen freedom of religion that we can
[19:41] worship jesus christ and jesus sets us
[19:44] free naturally and spiritually praise
[19:46] god
[19:47] he says the natural slaves free amen
[19:50] and the spiritual hallelujah
[19:53] only jesus could do that
[19:55] glory
[19:57] now just so you know paul never taught
[19:59] the slaves in rome or ephesus or any of
[20:02] those provinces of roman empire
[20:04] to violently overthrow slavery but god
[20:07] did anoint americans to do that
[20:11] right it's called the civil war we just
[20:13] went there to gettysburg this summer
[20:14] powerful abs if you get a chance to go
[20:16] there we'll go see sight in town too
[20:20] powerful man you're just a we i just cry
[20:23] cry seeing some of those scenes
[20:26] gettysburg was the the changing point of
[20:28] the civil war still went on for two
[20:29] years after that
[20:31] but that was the tipping point once the
[20:32] south lost that battle it was all
[20:34] downhill and god and each type of church
[20:36] it's a beautiful story it's a three-day
[20:38] battle
[20:39] and every time when it was like when
[20:41] all hope was lost somehow they said it
[20:44] hadn't been god god said reinforcements
[20:46] right at the last moment amen
[20:49] every time it's like we have nothing
[20:51] else we're out of ammunition or we're
[20:53] out of soldiers somebody would just show
[20:55] up because god is always all the time
[20:58] jesus is always on time
[21:00] he's never been late for one appointment
[21:03] so that i'm going to encourage you he's
[21:04] coming to your house too right now
[21:07] hallelujah
[21:09] just keep fighting that's it
[21:11] keep fighting the good fight of faith
[21:12] amen earnestly contend for the faith
[21:15] once delivered to the saints amen amen
[21:17] amen glory to god
[21:22] so see paul never told them to overthrow
[21:23] it but yet there was a season where god
[21:25] anointed americans overthrown get a
[21:27] raise up of lincoln
[21:29] again one book is a child hallelujah i'm
[21:32] sorry two books boxing book of martyrs
[21:33] and the bible hallelujah
[21:35] glory look when it produced a man who
[21:38] would give his life
[21:40] to set the slaves free and keep the
[21:42] country united
[21:43] amen
[21:46] uh history said we were watching there
[21:47] he never was happier than the day he was
[21:49] assassinated hmm it's as if he had he
[21:52] had seen the war come to an end he just
[21:54] been reelected
[21:56] and he'd seen all the wars over slave
[21:58] slavery's going to be abolished she had
[22:00] numerous black friends like frederick
[22:01] douglass some of the smartest people on
[22:03] earth a black man frederick douglass
[22:06] see they're just as smart as anybody
[22:08] praise god
[22:09] guys people are just as smart as
[22:11] everybody else amen but it's spiritual
[22:12] spartans that's the main thing amen
[22:17] he never was happier than the day was
[22:19] the bi uh the history says everybody's
[22:20] looking at him he was smiling he had
[22:22] such a joy about him and that's the day
[22:23] that he went home to be with the lord
[22:25] interesting
[22:26] lord help me to be happy i'm the day i
[22:28] go home with the lord
[22:30] if i if the rapture is not my lifetime
[22:32] let me cross over with joy amen
[22:35] and he crossed over with the happiness
[22:36] and the smile amen for all that jesus
[22:39] done for me praise god
[22:41] hey man
[22:43] now let's look at some uh
[22:46] some of the cultural aspects now here's
[22:48] a brief history now like i said malcolm
[22:50] had a better job than me okay
[22:52] bear with me i am a school teacher but
[22:53] we don't get this deep into history so
[22:55] this is all like history.com and
[22:58] wikipedia and uh hillsdale college
[23:01] they're a good christian college you
[23:02] know
[23:04] now
[23:06] in the 1600s slaves were bought brought
[23:08] to the american colonies
[23:10] we were under great britain's rule
[23:12] that's why it was allowed because we uh
[23:15] the the early americans here they were
[23:16] just they were great britain they were
[23:18] british right
[23:19] uh they had we hadn't established our
[23:21] own country yet so they couldn't stop it
[23:23] it was uh it was ordained by great
[23:25] britain
[23:26] right
[23:28] and also churches so we know slavery is
[23:30] the worst
[23:31] uh most wicked practice of all
[23:33] and sex trafficking is a modern-day
[23:35] slavery
[23:38] it's the modern-day slavery
[23:39] it's just completely wicked just like
[23:42] uh slavery but iran said god doesn't
[23:44] make slaves man makes slaves that's
[23:46] right
[23:47] right
[23:50] now
[23:51] in 1776 we declared war and uh against
[23:55] great britain for our independence
[23:57] that's that holy spirit it's a time for
[23:59] war there's a time for peace and a time
[24:00] for war praise god amen hallelujah and
[24:03] it officially ended two years later
[24:06] in 1778 we visited that where we visited
[24:08] that place as well
[24:10] so now they're officially independent
[24:12] now
[24:12] just so you know church the founding
[24:14] fathers were against slavery but they
[24:17] had to make gradual steps to end it
[24:19] because they had to have the southern
[24:20] states as part of the union as well
[24:23] okay in other words they couldn't defeat
[24:26] great britain if they just had the
[24:27] northern army they had to have because
[24:29] they had a southern part and you know
[24:31] great britain was attacking the south as
[24:32] well
[24:34] so they had to stay united so the
[24:35] founders knew
[24:37] slavery was wrong
[24:39] but they had to
[24:40] they had to realize god
[24:43] this ain't going to change overnight
[24:44] this is going to be a gradual process
[24:46] but if god is with us who can be against
[24:48] us amen amen
[24:50] now some people are are down on the
[24:52] founding fathers well they should not
[24:54] some of them had slaves well i i looked
[24:56] in that a little bit some did have
[24:57] slaves but it was illegal for them to
[24:59] set them free
[25:01] so they're trapped in the habit and they
[25:02] were born into it they didn't choose it
[25:04] they were born into that
[25:07] they were born they're raised having
[25:08] slaves
[25:09] now remember think about paul's day the
[25:11] same thing in paul's day
[25:13] some of them were born in slavery and
[25:15] paul told the slaves he said servants on
[25:17] your masters like you would christ jesus
[25:19] amen and it says masters don't forget to
[25:22] honor your slaves or your servants
[25:24] because christ is the master of you
[25:25] praise god
[25:28] hey
[25:31] and it's all over uh
[25:33] and when thomas jefferson wrote uh the
[25:36] declaration of independence he they
[25:38] didn't even put the word slave in any of
[25:40] their documents because they want they
[25:41] never wanted that a trace of that in the
[25:43] documents if you look at the founding
[25:45] documents and never use the word slave
[25:47] because they had a vision they had a
[25:49] vision that god would eventually take it
[25:50] away praise god
[25:52] hallelujah
[25:55] and what he said he said we hold these
[25:56] truths to be self-evident that all men
[25:58] are created equal
[26:01] that they are endowed by their their
[26:02] creator with certain unalienable rights
[26:05] that among these are life liberty and
[26:07] the pursuit of
[26:08] happiness now this man eventually became
[26:11] president was he the third president
[26:14] okay and uh i think it was the third one
[26:16] not just but
[26:18] all along whenever they had a chance
[26:20] they would end a certain part of slavery
[26:23] because it was set up by great britain
[26:24] it was just it was it was the system was
[26:26] set in place and they had to work slowly
[26:29] to change it
[26:30] now in 1803 america established a
[26:32] northwest territory which all all the
[26:34] western states and then jefferson he's
[26:37] the one that wrote all men credit equal
[26:39] he's the president that said
[26:41] there will be no slavery there and both
[26:43] both congress and house passed it
[26:46] so it's like the southern states knew it
[26:48] was wrong and they knew they were
[26:49] eventually gonna have to get rid of it
[26:50] but they still passed it so they were
[26:52] making
[26:54] they were making slow steady changes to
[26:55] get rid of it
[26:58] now in the 1830s to 1860s let me just
[27:00] move to the map here so here's what this
[27:02] was the northwest territory so here we
[27:03] are children here we are
[27:06] uh so in 1803 the northwest territories
[27:09] by law were anti-slavery no slavery okay
[27:12] just to give you an idea these are the
[27:14] states that
[27:15] fought for the north in the civil war
[27:17] these are the states that fought in the
[27:18] south to keep slavery
[27:20] it was divided right like there and then
[27:21] you have these uh border states here
[27:23] border states
[27:24] some of them were pro you know some
[27:26] parts of them were pro-slavery as well
[27:28] just depending on where you went
[27:30] so in the 30s 1830s and 60s there was a
[27:33] greater movement to end slavery
[27:36] and then the civil war went from 1861 to
[27:38] 1865
[27:40] four years
[27:42] some say up to a million and a half men
[27:44] and women gave their lives
[27:47] this was a huge uh this was a huge stand
[27:49] they had to make lincoln had to make
[27:50] this stand
[27:52] but he knew they because of the south as
[27:54] soon as soon as he was elected the south
[27:56] seceded and they started their own
[27:58] country did you know that they had their
[27:59] own president but lincoln said no we're
[28:01] going to war we're going to keep we're
[28:02] going to stay together
[28:05] so that's kind of what happened there uh
[28:07] just i'm just breezing over history
[28:09] there's
[28:10] billions of millions of details in it
[28:12] i'm just breezing over so you can see it
[28:14] now
[28:15] lincoln freed all the slaves on january
[28:17] 1st 1863 with the emancipation
[28:20] proclamation of course it you know
[28:22] people didn't honor it right away you
[28:23] just you have to have to uh wait for
[28:26] people to honor it you know sometimes
[28:27] you have to enforce laws right because
[28:28] people don't want to respect the laws
[28:30] the 13th amendment officially ended
[28:32] slavery though
[28:34] in 1865.
[28:36] now just to give you an idea i was
[28:37] telling brother williams after church on
[28:39] sunday
[28:40] the military remained segregated until
[28:43] 1948.
[28:46] so i mean my goodness almost 100 years
[28:48] later they were still segregated black
[28:50] military men had to stay there white
[28:52] military men in a separate place
[28:55] because of hard hearts because of pride
[28:57] because of hatred right
[28:59] and because of traditions and the way of
[29:01] life
[29:02] right
[29:04] now just to give you another little
[29:06] brief history
[29:07] the civil rights act of 1964 abolished
[29:10] segregation of public schools and public
[29:12] places i think about that 64.
[29:15] it was mainly southern states right
[29:17] because the north uh the north had
[29:19] abolished it and done away with it
[29:20] beforehand in fact
[29:22] nine northern states
[29:24] uh about slavery right away after they
[29:27] after they established the union nine of
[29:29] them instantly got got rid of slavery
[29:33] we are one of them by god's grace amen
[29:35] thank god
[29:37] and then of course in 2008 barack obama
[29:38] became the first president black
[29:40] president
[29:41] that's a big deal now of course i don't
[29:43] agree with his politics
[29:45] but it's a sign of how
[29:47] how much progress we've made
[29:49] you know
[29:50] uh in church sadly there's always been
[29:52] hatred and racism and they're always
[29:54] will
[29:55] but thank god god can give us new hearts
[29:57] and we can spread the love of jesus
[29:58] christ to every kindred and person every
[30:01] every person we come in contact with
[30:03] like i like brother austin but he was
[30:04] working at that other place he met a
[30:06] ukrainian guy he went out of his way he
[30:08] used the
[30:10] iphone translate to talk to the guy just
[30:12] having conversations here's a man you
[30:14] don't know the language you don't even
[30:15] know but he's going out of his way to be
[30:16] kind to a man from another nation i
[30:18] thought that that's pretty admirable
[30:20] praise god it's pretty admirable
[30:23] because as a christian you have love for
[30:25] everybody praise god
[30:28] you do
[30:30] now i want to show uh just some details
[30:33] here's why i think brother random was
[30:35] against it because this was a very
[30:37] tumultuous or violent time to live in
[30:40] especially in the south not so much in
[30:42] the north especially the south and this
[30:43] is all from history.com there's the
[30:45] website link if you want to link to it
[30:46] it's pretty easy i just typed in civil
[30:48] rights timeline that's all i have it's
[30:50] objective it's really easy
[30:52] now i'm not going to read some of these
[30:53] for the sake of the children okay
[30:54] there's the military secretary
[30:56] segregation desegregation
[31:00] this ended segregation in public schools
[31:02] but it took years and years and years to
[31:03] go into effect in 1954.
[31:05] now here's a really brutal one so i'm
[31:07] not going to say that but just because a
[31:09] black man was interested in a white
[31:11] woman
[31:12] he was murdered
[31:14] okay
[31:15] in mississippi
[31:17] this is 55 this is 10 years before
[31:19] brother brown died
[31:20] and these were just kind of like the
[31:22] highlights that caught national
[31:23] attention
[31:25] now of course this didn't happen all the
[31:26] time
[31:28] but these are some of the examples of
[31:30] the violence that people lit had to live
[31:32] through
[31:34] of course you probably heard of the kkk
[31:35] right huge group huge groups wicked
[31:37] people demon-possessed people right
[31:39] right but you had little pockets of
[31:41] people that were filled with demons like
[31:43] that
[31:44] and brother bam brother man was around
[31:47] that he knew about this he read the
[31:48] papers
[31:50] i remember rosa parks he refused to give
[31:52] that's a good thing that was a good
[31:53] thing she refused to give up her seat
[31:55] and that started a year-long bus boycott
[31:58] and they through that they actually
[31:59] change the laws and then now black
[32:01] people can sit anywhere on the bus
[32:03] isn't that crazy
[32:04] uh
[32:06] all these years later you know how is
[32:07] that even possible
[32:09] that because it's a slow progress of
[32:11] coming out of these traditions and ways
[32:13] of man i sound like this the great
[32:14] britain system
[32:16] right coming out of that
[32:18] but see church we're out of it by god's
[32:20] grace
[32:21] don't forget that praise god god brought
[32:23] us out of it hallelujah
[32:24] amen
[32:30] now they used to block students from
[32:32] black students from entering schools and
[32:34] they'd have to send in
[32:36] national guards troops to let black kids
[32:38] in white schools
[32:40] how sad is that
[32:43] um voter rights for blacks say i mean
[32:45] for years they had to then
[32:48] states would have little laws to prevent
[32:49] blacks from voting and they're working
[32:52] they're paying taxes all these things
[32:54] it's a slow process to change evil
[32:56] hearts
[32:58] sometimes you gotta wait generations to
[33:00] change change things because evil people
[33:02] they don't die right away
[33:04] right
[33:07] uh then they started sit-ins right where
[33:08] they'd sit in a restaurant and it was a
[33:10] form of a non-violent protest those are
[33:12] good things
[33:13] those are all good things
[33:15] i remember ruby she still a lot today
[33:16] ruby bridges was escorted by four
[33:18] federal marshals into a school in new
[33:20] orleans
[33:24] um
[33:26] again more
[33:28] there's a lot of protests a lot of
[33:29] violence in the in the 60s
[33:32] um here's where our governor stopped
[33:34] trying to stop two black students from
[33:35] entering into the university of alabama
[33:37] unbelievable unbelievable
[33:42] i have a dream speech that was
[33:44] not not long after the seals five months
[33:46] after the seven seals were preached
[33:49] now here's some awful things but they
[33:50] would bomb black churches these kkk
[33:53] people they would bomb
[33:56] i mean it was
[33:57] and of course brother graham would know
[33:58] about this you know
[34:00] and he would he would tell them don't
[34:02] intermarry
[34:04] right it was illegal and then there was
[34:06] this
[34:08] uh this violent nature there's a violent
[34:10] spirit around certain groups certain
[34:11] pockets of people
[34:13] it's so so wicked so sad
[34:17] then okay the civil rights act that
[34:20] prevented discrimination
[34:22] uh
[34:23] at the job place
[34:25] okay
[34:26] uh
[34:28] this was off i'm not gonna hear that but
[34:30] many people were killed in this called
[34:31] bloody sunday 1965 very sad very sad
[34:36] um
[34:38] okay i'll probably move and then you
[34:39] know they haven't even have a fair
[34:40] housing act so there's no discrimination
[34:42] against black people for moving into
[34:43] certain places to live in
[34:46] i mean it's just that's how that's how
[34:49] deep sin goes
[34:51] right
[34:52] if you don't if you don't root out that
[34:53] sin right away don't make god help us
[34:54] church may god help us to always root
[34:56] out sin in our lives what i'm saying if
[34:58] not it'll take such a grip it's so long
[35:00] to get it out except to be for the mercy
[35:02] of god in an honest heart god help us to
[35:04] have honest and good hearts amen
[35:06] now let roots of bitterness build up
[35:09] that's right
[35:10] now
[35:12] most of you would smile when i showed
[35:13] this magazine because not because the
[35:15] cover make because you know what's
[35:16] inside the magnet no that's right
[35:18] and this guy's an adulterer
[35:21] that's his second wife but he put away
[35:23] his first wife kind of reminds me of
[35:24] herod
[35:25] and herodias
[35:28] but
[35:29] as i was preparing this message on
[35:31] sunday i thought well there's an article
[35:32] in that magazine
[35:34] and so i'm going to show you some
[35:35] pictures just to get an idea
[35:37] from 1963 remember this is the year of
[35:39] the bombing this was the year of
[35:43] other awful events
[35:45] in this magazine this magazine is just
[35:47] like one big uh propaganda
[35:51] like it's trying to get you to smoke in
[35:52] here it's trying to get you to wear a
[35:54] bikinis in here
[35:56] trying to get you to buy this buy that
[35:58] car but
[36:00] and this is that's what most magazines
[36:02] are they're propaganda to try to get you
[36:03] to buy something
[36:05] well there's major propaganda here in
[36:08] here against the black people which is
[36:10] awful
[36:11] and it breaks it breaks our hearts
[36:13] but i just thought i'd show you that in
[36:15] the very magazine where it caught god
[36:17] amen
[36:18] it caught the mighty angel amen got me
[36:20] down amen that's right
[36:23] it's been proven no man can put that
[36:25] cloud up there it had to be supernatural
[36:27] god put that cloud up there praise god
[36:30] there's six hours of teaching on if you
[36:31] want to watch it i listen to it but at
[36:33] double speed
[36:36] it's quite good and i can't explain it
[36:38] but i just know no man can put it up
[36:40] there the timing and the height and
[36:41] everything it hadn't been supernatural
[36:43] for it
[36:45] so that's the picture we believe we got
[36:47] the picture out there supernatural cloud
[36:49] revelation ten one to seven fulfilled
[36:51] praise god but now we're eight to eleven
[36:53] you and i are eight to eleven praise god
[36:55] don't forget the end we are eight to
[36:56] eleven hallelujah
[36:58] we're gonna prophesy again amen we're
[37:00] gonna eat in the book praise god it's
[37:01] like honey in the mouth but bitter in
[37:03] the belly praise god thank god we got
[37:05] the open book praise god amen amen
[37:09] now here's the first picture now they're
[37:11] they're saying that the black people are
[37:14] are
[37:15] provoking
[37:16] the white cops and that is not the case
[37:18] if you read the article that's not the
[37:20] case they just some of them are there
[37:22] just because they want to eat at white
[37:23] restaurants they want to go to white
[37:24] schools
[37:25] they just want equal they just want
[37:27] equal treatment
[37:28] and some of their some of them are
[37:30] protesting some of those bombings and
[37:31] killings
[37:33] and this article makes the black people
[37:35] ought to be bad
[37:37] now church in every mob or i'm sorry not
[37:39] everybody in every protest i'm sure
[37:40] there are some bad people
[37:43] but if it's a good protest most of the
[37:45] protesters are good people yeah if it's
[37:47] a honest genuine protest and according
[37:50] to the article that's all they were
[37:51] there they were protesting some uh
[37:55] some bombings and some killings and of
[37:56] course who wouldn't
[37:58] i mean
[37:59] if your loved one got
[38:00] something awful happened wouldn't you
[38:02] protest would you go to the cops and try
[38:04] to go to the police office and say
[38:06] what's going on we want justice
[38:10] so in the same magazine now look look
[38:13] they brought the dogs out on just people
[38:15] protesting they're just protesting
[38:17] they don't have weapons in their hands
[38:19] look they rip off his pants they rip off
[38:21] this guy's pants
[38:22] and look what they say the dog attack is
[38:24] their reward look how awful that is
[38:27] this is just is outside that article
[38:30] all these all these worldly magazines
[38:32] it's all propaganda
[38:34] now brother branham identifies the
[38:36] spirit behind this church it's communism
[38:38] brother branham says
[38:41] because that's how communists take over
[38:43] countries they got to pit people against
[38:45] him in order to have a power grab
[38:47] that's how cuba did it church
[38:50] cuba when they when they went communist
[38:52] they had to they had to be against black
[38:54] people
[38:55] now hitler wasn't a communist he was a
[38:56] fascist but that's how hitler got all
[38:59] his power he had segregation against
[39:01] jews
[39:04] that's always the power grab
[39:06] the power grab is to get people against
[39:08] so they fight each other they hate each
[39:10] other
[39:12] see satan's spirit makes you divided
[39:14] god's spirit unites us amen
[39:18] it's awful
[39:20] this is the this is the culture
[39:23] this is the world brother ram had to
[39:24] preach it and lift it
[39:27] now look at this this guy just got
[39:29] sprayed he looks so sad but you're going
[39:30] to see what they say about him so look
[39:32] at these women they were they were doing
[39:33] a sit-in they were just sitting in to
[39:35] try to get rights and they pull drag
[39:37] them by the legs
[39:40] it's just awful that's right in the
[39:41] magazines that's right in the magazine
[39:42] that we all like
[39:44] we don't even realize that's that was
[39:46] that's what was going on in 1963
[39:53] okay
[39:54] now look what they call this guy they
[39:56] call they call that the face of hatred
[39:57] this is just a propaganda that's not
[39:59] hatred that's i'm standing up for my
[40:01] rights and i'm i want freedom
[40:04] i'm sad because you sprayed me with a
[40:06] hose and i'm not doing anything
[40:08] violent does everybody understand by
[40:10] god's grace
[40:15] now here look they in this article here
[40:18] they they say though
[40:20] these people wagging their fingers here
[40:22] are provoking
[40:23] this warfare just because they're
[40:25] wagging a finger so you have the you
[40:27] know they see they're pointing their
[40:28] fingers and things like that now we
[40:30] don't even know what they're protesting
[40:31] they're probably protesting the bombings
[40:33] and the killings and why to change our
[40:34] laws give us some reading they're
[40:36] probably just doing like that but the
[40:37] propaganda the magazine makes it sound
[40:39] like they deserve
[40:40] that and it's a lie they didn't
[40:44] some of them could even vote
[40:46] some of them could even buy a house when
[40:47] they wanted a certain place where they
[40:49] wanted to buy a house couldn't even eat
[40:50] when they want to eat
[40:53] i mean this is heartbreaking but again
[40:56] look where god has brought us amen
[40:58] thank god amen thank god for his grace
[41:00] and mercy
[41:02] now compare that to the george floyd
[41:04] writes
[41:05] which i don't support what the police
[41:07] officer did that was way too brutal
[41:09] but that guy was breaking the law he had
[41:11] a history of being in jail
[41:12] he never should have kneeled on his knee
[41:14] everybody knows that
[41:16] but look what they did afterwards they
[41:18] burnt down the police that was violent
[41:21] and yet our media today supports that
[41:24] but the media didn't support that then
[41:27] it's flipped
[41:30] right same spirit
[41:32] right the median was was for these and
[41:35] now the media is for these and
[41:36] destruction and death and killing now
[41:38] it's okay to be violent and riot
[41:42] if you're on that side
[41:44] the wicked side
[41:48] and in this one church nobody's burning
[41:49] down nothing nobody's shooting nobody's
[41:51] throwing up those uh cocktails what they
[41:53] call them
[41:55] i can never say that word
[41:57] because i don't do i don't do evil
[41:59] things
[42:00] i just don't think about it very much
[42:02] you know but thank you
[42:04] so see uh
[42:06] see i was propaganda right
[42:09] it's communism and that's what they're
[42:10] trying that's what some of these
[42:12] democrats are trying to do and
[42:13] republicans communism
[42:15] they're trying to bankrupt the nation so
[42:17] everyone has to live off the government
[42:18] they've already said it they said at
[42:19] their summit remember austin they said
[42:21] they said all the people in the world
[42:22] are going to own nothing and be happy
[42:24] they're trying to destroy capitalism
[42:26] they're trying to destroy the american
[42:27] dollar which at some point they're going
[42:29] to accomplish it yeah because of the
[42:31] revelation 13 says yeah
[42:33] but
[42:34] but my prayers are going to go up before
[42:35] that amen
[42:37] hallelujah praise god amen
[42:39] just like i'm praying for abortion and
[42:41] still praise god
[42:42] don't stop praying well i'm here we got
[42:44] to occupy by the grace of god
[42:49] now here's that uh
[42:51] here's the quote where brother says that
[42:54] to show you it's communism not them
[42:56] black people again i'm trying to be uh
[42:58] politically correct that's just the way
[43:00] it was in 64. that's not right now but
[43:02] that's how it wasn't 64.
[43:04] that's how communists always come in and
[43:06] take over they do that in every nation
[43:07] that's how they do it getting you
[43:09] fighting against one another a
[43:10] revolution then they take in it without
[43:12] a shock
[43:14] see if if the communists and the
[43:16] government people can start a revolution
[43:19] then they have a right they can just
[43:20] come in and change things because
[43:22] there's a revolution
[43:24] that's what happened in cuba stalin did
[43:26] that too now was stalin communist
[43:28] yeah i was reading that on the website
[43:30] stalin now what nation was he italy
[43:32] russia okay i got him mixed up with
[43:34] muslim muslims
[43:37] like hitler okay
[43:39] so there are some uh those are some of
[43:41] the famous communists and that's what
[43:42] they always do
[43:44] uh they always get they always make
[43:46] racism a thing they pit the people
[43:48] against each other
[43:50] see brotherhood says they don't want to
[43:52] blow the country up they want it they
[43:54] can wormweed it though
[43:56] they seen a case of doing that and they
[43:58] know the old revolution was they thought
[43:59] they'd start another revolution
[44:03] okay
[44:03] but i said it shows that it is communism
[44:06] not them precious souls that's born the
[44:07] spirit of god so brotherhood calls the
[44:09] black people precious souls
[44:12] that are born again
[44:14] right
[44:16] but he recognized there's politics
[44:18] behind it
[44:19] that's what it is
[44:20] today and that's what it's going to be
[44:23] church right before the rapture
[44:25] they're going to have they're going to
[44:26] have a call where they're going to be
[44:27] able to kill all christians that are
[44:28] real bible-believing christians
[44:30] see it's dividing it's working towards
[44:33] racism towards christians and the church
[44:35] said i mean that's what the bible says
[44:39] it's building this is all building even
[44:41] today it's building to racism against
[44:43] real christians so they can lay down the
[44:45] mark of the beast and kill anyone that
[44:46] descends against them i know it's pretty
[44:47] serious church but i to say it
[44:51] got to say it we may live to see it
[44:55] so brother i made that great observation
[44:57] communists and fascists like hitler
[44:59] so we're going to have to saw these wars
[45:01] and these riots and uh
[45:03] i'm sure not really riots
[45:05] he saw all the the fighting and the
[45:06] killing and the bombing not there wasn't
[45:08] many riots it was
[45:10] it was all it was all the white people
[45:11] doing the wrong things that's from what
[45:12] i can see
[45:14] yeah
[45:16] but these leaders use racial wars to
[45:18] take political power
[45:20] that's what we see a lot of politicians
[45:22] in our country doing today racism and
[45:24] division everything's racist if you
[45:26] believe in the bible you're racist
[45:28] if you believe in uh
[45:30] uh
[45:32] pro-life you're racist
[45:34] i'm not racist i'm just pro-life i just
[45:36] love life i believe babies have a a
[45:38] right to life i believe baby lives
[45:40] matter amen
[45:42] every life matters amen amen hallelujah
[45:47] now
[45:50] i just want to i have to show these
[45:53] and i just want to say some of these are
[45:54] hard to hear
[45:56] some of them may be hard to hear but you
[45:58] hear them on tape eventually if you
[45:59] serve god long enough
[46:01] and you'll just you're like oh my how
[46:03] can you say that well now we can
[46:04] understand how we could say some of
[46:05] these things
[46:08] first of all interracial marriage was
[46:09] illegal
[46:10] and then second of all
[46:12] it was a very it could be a very violent
[46:14] thing to have interracial marriage you
[46:16] could be uh under a lot of
[46:19] stress what's another word for it uh
[46:21] pressure
[46:22] say your safety would be in uh in danger
[46:24] yeah you'd be in danger
[46:26] in certain areas of of the country
[46:28] mostly south
[46:30] okay
[46:32] and now church there are quotes brother
[46:34] ram says let the brown marry the brown
[46:36] so that i thought so now i'm getting to
[46:37] me
[46:38] right so i look at these quotes and
[46:40] and i put myself in there i know i'm not
[46:42] black but i put myself in there i was
[46:46] a part of me on my minority
[46:48] like when i signed up for college i put
[46:49] half hispanic half white
[46:51] is that what that's what i want
[46:53] i got a little extra finances because of
[46:55] that of course we were dirt poor so it
[46:57] helped you know
[47:00] but in other words i look at myself i'm
[47:01] a mix of two nations
[47:05] okay so
[47:06] uh here's the first one
[47:08] so brother ram calls interracial
[47:09] marriage he calls it hybrid he calls it
[47:11] how terrible
[47:13] now that's really hard to
[47:15] it's hard to hard to hear
[47:18] um
[47:19] because they hybrid the people it's a
[47:21] big melting pot i have hundreds of
[47:23] precious colored friends that's born
[47:25] again christians but on this line of
[47:26] segregation and things hybriding the
[47:28] people
[47:30] and he says what kind of a fine
[47:32] christian colored woman would want her
[47:34] baby to be mulatto by a white man no sir
[47:36] it's not right
[47:37] what white woman would want her baby to
[47:39] be mulatto by a colored man god made us
[47:41] what we are let's stay what god made us
[47:44] i believe it's right so does anybody see
[47:46] any scripture in there
[47:48] there's no scripture anybody see any of
[47:49] us hate the lord in there
[47:51] no
[47:52] now member church i know these are i
[47:53] know that they're they're incredibly
[47:55] tough
[47:56] i know
[47:57] but i would be lying if i didn't show
[47:59] them to you that's right do you want me
[48:01] to hide things from you or do you want
[48:02] me to be honest and tell you the truth
[48:05] there's a lot of preachers that hide it
[48:06] right yeah
[48:07] and i'm not trying to say i'm better
[48:08] than anybody i'm not i'm just saying i
[48:10] want to be honest
[48:11] and i love what god's doing for austin
[48:12] right now it's great i love that amen
[48:16] i know that god put
[48:18] timothy's mom and dad together i love
[48:19] that praise god moses the bar we love
[48:21] that
[48:22] but this was a very tumultuous time
[48:25] this was a very
[48:26] the 60s 50s and 60s were a very
[48:29] tumultuous time
[48:31] nuclear wars right there was human
[48:34] missile prices
[48:35] i mean it was
[48:37] it was it was a very scary time to live
[48:41] okay now the rest of them are on
[48:43] evernote so
[48:44] um i'm gonna just detach this here and
[48:46] i'll come back to it
[48:48] okay good i've been preaching 45 minutes
[48:50] okay so let me read a few more just so
[48:52] you have an idea i won't be able to get
[48:53] to all of them because i actually would
[48:54] like to finish this topic tonight but if
[48:57] you have any questions you know i can
[48:58] deal with it again uh even on a sunday
[49:00] night
[49:04] that's why church with everything though
[49:05] brother says the holy spirit directs us
[49:07] to the word of god
[49:09] okay so obviously we can see brother ram
[49:11] didn't know everything brother branham
[49:13] wasn't god brother random wasn't
[49:15] infallible
[49:16] he was a prophet do prophets make
[49:18] mistakes in the bible yeah they don't
[49:20] make mistakes with us say the lord this
[49:22] topic's not thus saith the lord
[49:24] but prophets make mistakes prophets have
[49:26] wrong opinions right nathan
[49:28] nathan had opinion david do all it's in
[49:30] your heart that wasn't the right opinion
[49:31] that was wrong with me
[49:35] now what i would say that quote if it
[49:37] was horrible for black and white to
[49:39] marry then it's horrible for my parents
[49:40] to marry right
[49:42] because we're we're still mixing two
[49:44] different nations
[49:46] so see that's why i put myself in there
[49:49] right
[49:51] and then whenever brother and talks
[49:52] about moses the poor he never calls it
[49:54] horrible
[49:56] he actually rebukes
[49:57] miriam and aaron for speaking against
[49:59] their marriage
[50:00] and he just he he builds up zipporah all
[50:02] the time
[50:04] he says she's the only one that saved
[50:06] his life amen nobody else can save his
[50:08] life just as his wife
[50:11] every time
[50:13] so you have to see its cultural and
[50:15] legal aspects here
[50:17] he's dealing with
[50:18] that's that's how i understand it in
[50:20] church i can be wrong when i do all of
[50:21] these things
[50:22] but that's how i can see it by god's
[50:24] ways does this help him brother austin
[50:25] is it helping my counselor okay
[50:29] in gabriel's uh now this is one of the
[50:31] harder ones here too gabriel's
[50:32] instructions of daniel brother branham
[50:34] says uh men's hearts are failing for
[50:36] fear the handwriting is on the wall
[50:38] racial disintegration so he's talking
[50:40] about how the races were all mixed he
[50:42] says and all kinds of evil going on in
[50:45] the world so bible man calls it evil to
[50:47] enter into america
[50:48] again there's no verses
[50:50] there's no scripture there's no thoughts
[50:52] of the lord so i would if brother man
[50:54] was here i'd ask him brother branham was
[50:56] moses and zipporah was that evil when
[50:57] they married and of course i'm sure
[51:00] if he did in our time he would he would
[51:02] probably say
[51:03] he'd say of course not
[51:05] god ordained
[51:09] [Music]
[51:11] yeah these are these are the hardest
[51:12] quotes i know right
[51:15] these are the hardest ones
[51:20] in uh now in life
[51:23] sermon 1962
[51:25] brother random he gets into the legal
[51:26] aspect of it
[51:28] he says
[51:31] he says the big boss up here this nation
[51:34] what they say is all right
[51:37] he says uh they asked brother branham
[51:39] being a southerner what do you think
[51:40] about segregation i said it's not for me
[51:42] to say the boss the government said let
[51:44] it be what it is permit them to marry
[51:46] and so forth i said that's up to them as
[51:49] an american i abide by the laws
[51:53] he says this quote is clear he's abiding
[51:55] by the laws
[51:57] now just so you know there's articles
[51:59] there's you can find them online there's
[52:00] a lot of articles where in the south
[52:03] if there was a interracial marriage the
[52:05] cops would break into their home at
[52:06] night and arrest them and take them to
[52:08] jail that's how awful it was they break
[52:11] up homes and families they take the kids
[52:12] off to
[52:14] what are they called children's services
[52:15] or whatever
[52:17] so awful
[52:20] and brother iran knew that
[52:23] so that's why i feel like legal the
[52:25] legal aspect it was a huge aspect of it
[52:31] said to me you ought to leave it the way
[52:32] god had it he made me a white man
[52:35] black men brown men god he's a god of
[52:37] writing let them stay the way god made
[52:39] them that's what i think
[52:41] if i was a black man i want to stay in
[52:43] my class of people if i was chinese
[52:45] yellow i'd want to stay that way being
[52:47] that i'm anglo saxon white let me marry
[52:49] amongst the white teach my children the
[52:51] same and just stay the kind of a flower
[52:54] and the color that god made us at the
[52:55] beginning after all he's the one that
[52:57] made it
[52:58] okay so again any scriptures there no
[53:00] scriptures what about the five
[53:02] interracial marriages i showed you what
[53:03] about the six what about timothy
[53:06] see so it's as if
[53:08] it's just it's as if god didn't allow
[53:09] him to
[53:10] see the full truth all around
[53:12] okay it's just and it's it's similar but
[53:15] not not even close to serious but
[53:17] something similar is like 1977 brother
[53:19] ram thought his whole life
[53:21] by these
[53:22] three predictions i showed you it's on
[53:23] the video too i put a video about it
[53:26] he thought for sure because of these
[53:27] three calculations that the world would
[53:30] be destroyed by 1977 because of three
[53:32] calculations with the old testament and
[53:34] jubilee and everything like that
[53:37] and god let him die
[53:39] and he didn't he didn't have that right
[53:42] because he's human
[53:46] okay so those probably are some of the
[53:48] hardest ones
[53:50] um
[53:51] in another quote from 1963 he said don't
[53:53] cross them up speaking of black and
[53:54] white you get against nature
[53:57] okay but again
[53:58] as i showed you there's only one blood
[54:02] right there's only one blood
[54:03] and god put
[54:05] ethiopian and hebrew together with moses
[54:08] so that's what we'd ask brother brandon
[54:09] now of course we know he
[54:10] he'd say the right thing now because
[54:12] he's got a glorified body
[54:14] right
[54:15] and even brother brandon said his mom
[54:16] didn't brother i'm saying his mom was
[54:18] half indian brother and
[54:19] that's that right i think the man said
[54:21] his mother was half indian
[54:23] native american he said that's why he
[54:24] loved the woods so much
[54:26] so that he was a fourth
[54:28] possibly a fourth native american
[54:31] so it just seemed to be something with
[54:32] the political pressure of that time the
[54:34] cultural pressure and with the legal
[54:35] pressure it just seemed like something
[54:37] he had to stand against
[54:39] now put yourself in that position what
[54:40] advice if you were a preacher and you
[54:42] were impacted millions of people what
[54:43] would you say
[54:45] if you knew they could get arrested
[54:47] well i'd probably say move north you're
[54:48] going to get married move north right
[54:50] that's what i'd say
[54:52] get a job in the north you know
[54:56] because the north you could do that
[54:58] it was allowed
[55:00] i'm sorry no i'm sorry it wasn't until
[55:01] 96. it wasn't
[55:04] yeah i i don't know how it wasn't i
[55:06] don't know if you could i don't know if
[55:07] you get away with it or not but i would
[55:09] i would say move north
[55:11] yeah because that's right the law didn't
[55:12] change until 1967 two years after both
[55:14] of them died
[55:20] now here's another i want to read
[55:21] another hard one just so
[55:23] just so you're aware of it
[55:25] little man we said we should never cross
[55:27] that up speaking of white black red men
[55:31] he said it becomes a hybrid and anything
[55:34] hybrid cannot re-breed itself he says
[55:37] you are ruining the race of people
[55:39] that's a really
[55:40] hard quote
[55:42] you're ruining the race it just means he
[55:44] i think he means like you're just mixing
[55:46] the skin colors or something like that
[55:49] again so i would ask brother branham did
[55:51] moses ruin his race
[55:53] when he took support i was just i mean
[55:55] humbly
[55:56] humbly
[55:58] right
[56:00] that same thing i got asked about not
[56:01] you know 1977 or any other opinion of
[56:02] brother brandon
[56:06] i'd say how many
[56:08] is this is this right exactly is that
[56:10] exactly right
[56:12] but this was the culture this was the
[56:14] time here they're living it i know i
[56:16] know these things are really hard
[56:19] [Music]
[56:25] okay
[56:26] so
[56:28] and then one more quote he calls it
[56:30] wrong he said some some people their
[56:31] children are intermarrying or things
[56:33] that's wrong so he just calls it wrong
[56:37] horrible
[56:38] evil
[56:39] long
[56:41] some really hard things
[56:44] but
[56:45] i never
[56:46] i never see him quoting the scripture
[56:48] okay never seen the quote description
[56:50] can you put my slides back up here
[56:54] so thank you i appreciate everybody
[56:59] uh listening to some of those i know
[57:00] that's really difficult
[57:03] i thought it'd be better to get it from
[57:04] me as you know i love everybody here
[57:07] i love you i do anything for you i could
[57:09] possibly do it
[57:12] and they're these quotes are sitting on
[57:13] the tapes right and as you listen to
[57:15] them you're going to eventually run into
[57:16] them and say well brother jesse you
[57:17] didn't tell me about that
[57:19] so again that's why i love sunday nights
[57:20] if you have any questions
[57:22] we're not afraid of questions
[57:25] we're going to be honest we're going to
[57:26] pray we're going to seek god here we're
[57:28] searching history
[57:30] to try to come to the right conclusion
[57:32] and so church what conclusion do we come
[57:33] to
[57:34] the bible is the absolute amen
[57:38] i'll do something before moving on this
[57:40] is okay
[57:40] there's our little girls here i just
[57:42] want to tell each little girl that
[57:43] they're beautiful okay
[57:45] okay we just seen something
[57:47] god made you beautiful
[57:48] you're fearfully wonderfully made
[57:50] your skin color is beautiful
[57:59] you are all three beautiful god made you
[58:01] beautiful
[58:02] you're fearfully wonderfully made and
[58:04] your skin is beautiful
[58:06] everything about you
[58:07] especially that you love jesus
[58:09] that's the most important thing that
[58:10] makes you
[58:12] you're beautiful
[58:13] you're fearfully wonderful
[58:16] your skin's beautiful
[58:18] especially jesus that's the most
[58:19] beautiful thing
[58:26] son and daughter you're beautiful
[58:29] your skin's beautiful your smile is
[58:30] beautiful
[58:31] you're fearfully wonderful
[58:34] wow
[58:35] [Music]
[58:47] because it's even hard for me because
[58:48] i've been called names
[58:50] i've been called some of those names
[58:53] and i felt bad for being who i was and i
[58:56] wasn't even like a real
[58:57] i was a half minority
[58:59] i wasn't even a full nightmare
[59:02] but they need to know that jesus did
[59:04] something beautiful when he made each of
[59:06] you
[59:07] every skin color is beautiful
[59:10] every single one
[59:12] like that song red and yellow black and
[59:14] white they are precious
[59:28] so
[59:30] i think i'll close here with this oh i
[59:32] don't know i'm always right along praise
[59:34] god
[59:36] and then if anybody has questions after
[59:38] this after i get done then we can take
[59:39] them i'll probably turn off the live
[59:40] stream enough just
[59:42] then people can't hear the questions you
[59:44] know
[59:50] no matter what nation we're from
[59:52] no matter what skin color we have no
[59:55] matter if we're male or female
[59:57] we're all in the resemblance of god
[1:00:01] and god calls us
[1:00:03] his beloved amen
[1:00:05] it's satan that puts people against each
[1:00:07] other not god
[1:00:10] god brings people together
[1:00:12] praise god we are god's beloved
[1:00:16] here's the scripture that says you you
[1:00:18] are god's i read this this morning
[1:00:19] whenever i get discouraged i go in my
[1:00:21] closet i said where's that paper i
[1:00:23] preached on those i am statements last
[1:00:24] year i am loved i roll it out and say
[1:00:27] yes god loves me
[1:00:29] i feel like such a failure sometimes but
[1:00:31] that's the first verse i put at the top
[1:00:32] of that
[1:00:33] i belong god loves me amen
[1:00:36] and he loves every gentile hallelujah
[1:00:39] just like he loves every jew
[1:00:46] that he might make known the riches of
[1:00:48] his glory on the vessels of mercy which
[1:00:50] he had afford prepared unto glory even
[1:00:53] us whom he hath called not
[1:00:55] of the jews only but also the gentiles
[1:00:58] as he also said in the book of hosea or
[1:01:00] oc
[1:01:01] in the greek
[1:01:03] i will call them my people which were
[1:01:05] not my people and her beloved which was
[1:01:08] not beloved praise god
[1:01:10] and it shall come to pass that in the
[1:01:12] place where it was said unto them ye are
[1:01:14] my people there shall they be called the
[1:01:17] children of the living god
[1:01:19] hallelujah
[1:01:20] church just keep that in mind you are a
[1:01:22] child of the living god today amen amen
[1:01:25] i love this one too
[1:01:26] at that time church before jesus died
[1:01:29] you were without i'm sorry as a gentile
[1:01:31] before the new testament you were
[1:01:33] without christ you were an alien from
[1:01:35] the commonwealth of israel and strangers
[1:01:37] from the covenants have promised having
[1:01:39] no hope without god in the world
[1:01:42] but now in christ jesus you who are
[1:01:44] sometimes far off are made nigh by the
[1:01:47] blood of christ amen amen in other words
[1:01:50] we were all so far from if we weren't a
[1:01:52] jew we were all discriminated against we
[1:01:54] were all segregated against we're all
[1:01:56] far from any problems far from any
[1:01:58] blessing but the blood of jesus christ
[1:02:00] brings all nations all skin colors all
[1:02:03] male female gender all ages all shapes
[1:02:06] and sizes brings them all together and
[1:02:08] places us at the cross
[1:02:10] hallelujah
[1:02:12] for he's our peace
[1:02:14] who has made both one and has broken
[1:02:17] down the middle wall partition between
[1:02:19] us
[1:02:20] having about in his flesh the enmity
[1:02:22] even the law of the commandments contain
[1:02:25] the ordinances for to make in himself
[1:02:27] obtain one new man so making peace
[1:02:33] now here's the verse we read earlier
[1:02:36] that they would so god determined where
[1:02:38] you would live that you would seek the
[1:02:39] lord if happily they might feel after
[1:02:41] him and find him though he be not far
[1:02:43] from every one of us for in him we live
[1:02:46] and move and have our being as certain
[1:02:48] also if your opponents have said we are
[1:02:51] also his offspring amen
[1:02:54] so when god wanted to have children he
[1:02:55] made you
[1:02:56] amen i don't know when god wanted a
[1:02:59] child he thought of you amen he wrote
[1:03:01] out your dna brought your mother and
[1:03:03] father together now i've got the
[1:03:05] masterpiece amen
[1:03:06] hallelujah
[1:03:08] now i've got my offspring praise god
[1:03:14] i think that's the last one yep
[1:03:18] and he is the propitiation for our sins
[1:03:20] and not for ours only
[1:03:23] but also for the sins of the whole world
[1:03:27] so did jesus die just for jews
[1:03:30] no he died for the entire world
[1:03:33] he died for us
[1:03:34] he died for our ancestors
[1:03:37] he died if we have any if there's a
[1:03:38] future he died for our future
[1:03:40] descendants praise god
[1:03:42] he died for all
[1:03:44] and hereby that we know jesus if we keep
[1:03:47] his commands how do we want to keep his
[1:03:48] commandments praise god amen
[1:03:50] church this is what i love about god he
[1:03:51] died for all and if any he'll say anyone
[1:03:54] who's thirsty i don't care if you're a
[1:03:55] moabite
[1:03:56] i don't care if you're harlot
[1:03:58] drug addict
[1:04:00] hittite or if you're a sinai like me i
[1:04:02] was a cinnamon you know
[1:04:03] sinnerite maybe
[1:04:05] cinderellic
[1:04:07] see everyone he died for and he's asking
[1:04:10] everyone come to me and i'll bring you
[1:04:12] close my blood will make you close to
[1:04:15] the you'll have covenants promise you
[1:04:17] have an inheritance i'll make you a king
[1:04:19] i'll make you a priest oh by the blood
[1:04:21] of jesus christ amen amen
[1:04:23] amen now we don't know their colors
[1:04:25] right but adam and eve know his wife now
[1:04:27] his three sons should be right here
[1:04:28] three sons and there why is she right
[1:04:30] there
[1:04:31] yeah that's probably the three right
[1:04:32] that's probably represented three cents
[1:04:33] power babel and look you get this
[1:04:35] beautiful variety look at all these
[1:04:36] children you've got the beautiful
[1:04:38] variety of all of it
[1:04:39] it's every skin color oh they're all
[1:04:41] smiling they're all beautiful
[1:04:43] this is what god this is what god does
[1:04:44] amen amen god is a god of writing
[1:04:53] all comes out of the genetic code
[1:04:56] at church you realize you know i was
[1:04:57] looking at a book this weekend i was
[1:04:59] actually listening to an author who
[1:05:00] wrote a book he's a christian
[1:05:02] he's digging into the facts of dna and
[1:05:04] he's saying he's saying the dna we all
[1:05:06] go back to noah's three sons but he said
[1:05:08] the physical traits of nations have
[1:05:11] changed over the last six thousand years
[1:05:13] they change
[1:05:15] the last four thousand years
[1:05:17] in other words like chinese may not have
[1:05:19] always looked like that
[1:05:21] right
[1:05:22] english might not always look like that
[1:05:24] mexicans might not have always looked
[1:05:26] like that
[1:05:27] because there's so much change going on
[1:05:29] in the genetic code
[1:05:33] but who's the author of all those
[1:05:34] beautiful faces all those colors that's
[1:05:36] our god amen our god is awesome let's
[1:05:38] stand on our feet
