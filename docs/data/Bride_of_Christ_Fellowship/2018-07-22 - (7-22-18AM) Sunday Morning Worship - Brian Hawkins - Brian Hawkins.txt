comes to minister God's word for us how many so busy it wouldn't have been fair to you all I told brother Jesse early in the week I said it wouldn't be fair to the Saints you know that I wouldn't have been able to dedicate my time to study in prayer it just wouldn't have been fair to you folks and so if I come it's it's a struggle when I go out anywhere just to try to preach the word just because I want to find the mind of God and then sometimes panic sets in when when things aren't I don't think that it's right you know it's uh from not in the in that will but my son had graduated we had a graduation party last week and uh June and July as it's really busy months for us so I just thank God for what he's what he's done for us and just the wonderful family that I have my natural family and my spiritual family just the wonderful works that he's done with us just appreciate him I'm also glad that I'm here before brother Jim he's a much better preacher you know the ending of a thing is better than the beginning so when he when he comes by God's grace you'll be treated real well to some good ministry I think highly of our pastor just a wonderful man and and we always want to not just him but every pastor that's out there you know he lifts your pastor up you know pray for wisdom that he would receive wisdom and because that's that's what he's feeding you with so if you want to be blessed and pray for the one that's going to feed you you know so and you're going to eat at your own risk how's that if you don't pray for him you're not gonna get fed you're gonna starve to death amen so if we just think thank God for four men of God that are duty bound and standing their post of duty then let's read Isaiah 59 and 19 says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him hey man let's bow our heads most gracious Heavenly Father it's with great honor and great humility to that stand here before you and your people this morning and fathers I think your brother Prakash so many times saying there's nothing good in me and Lord I feel the same way there's nothing good in me except which you have placed there you've taken out the the heart of stone and know you've replaced it with a flesh heart or God and I just appreciate the change that you've made in all of our lives but lord if there's one here that needs that changing I pray that you would speak to their hearts this morning that you would send that changing to them also Oh father the Lord is I want to be dependent on you this morning and and not upon myself I don't just give me that gift that the Prophet spoke about many times about getting himself out of the way lord I just pray that you would send the same gift and let your spirit just have it's have its way this morning that you would have preeminence in this service and I pray that you regard my lips that I wouldn't say anything contrary to your word the Lord I'll just pray that you would be glorified and that your children would be edified Lord we ask it in your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you Lord you may be seated just kind of want to talk to you for a little bit one I like to get get calmed down a little bit so I I talked a little bit beforehand it's it's been a little while since I've I've ministered and it's been I don't know how I don't know when the last time I was here but it seems like forever [Laughter] so I thank brother Jesse for inviting me and uh I do have a lot of scripture today so bear with me it might seem it I have a lot of Scripture but it's not exhaustive but you might think that it's exhaustive that I hope I don't bore you but I'd rather his I'd rather be his word so I can get it out than just my word so it's uh and also bear with me if I end up running because I I can I get excited when I talk about this stuff and and just when I think about I don't know if y'all knew just kind of this year in January well beforehand I was past four years since 2015 I've been having some health issues I think 2016 I had three surgeries that year and January ended up with a bowel blockage and then I had three surgeries this year I had insert another bowel surgery and and a couple other things that had happened but I just think God for all the prayers I don't know if if it extended here or not if y'all had received prayer requests but I thank God that he's healed me and brother brother Jesse he'd asked me how I was feeling in the office and I said I feel great people at work have been asking me how you feel and I say I feel great I feel fantastic you know and it's all by God yeah I told brother Jesse I said when the doctors say and my wife was sitting in the office with me so she knows what the surgeon says and he said I don't know what else to do there's nothing there's nothing that I can do and and the GI doctor they don't know what to do there's nothing then they could do and I just can't help but think of that woman that had the blood issue for 12 years she spent all their money she went to the doctor she did everything that they could and they said that there's nothing else that they could do but what happened because there was nothing else that man could do that we don't put our trust in man God was able to come on that scene a man and I just thank God that he came and touched me in my body amen and it's so great to say that I'm not in pain because there were times that I'd wake up in the morning I was in pain I'd go throughout the day I try to do something out in the garage just try to do something because I'm the type of guy that I can't stand sitting around my wife yelled at me several times that I should be resting and relaxing but it's hard for me so it really plays a battle on my mind and that if I sit there I go stir-crazy because I know there's there's something to do and uh but I'd go out in their garage in about five ten minutes later I'd have to go back in because I was hurting so bad and I don't like taking pills and I'd be laying there and I'd be hurt and she'd come in well did you take a pain pill well no I wanted to take a pain he'll cuz I don't want to take a pain I want God to touch me I want touched I want his healing hand to be upon me but I ended up taking a pain pill a little bit after cuz you know and then it seemed like a little after I take a pain pill and you're looking for that four hour mark where you could take another one cuz it just didn't do anything and I'm not trying to I'm trying to exalt God is what I'm trying to do here because I just thank God for a saving touch and I thank God for a wonderful family that my kids they would write little notes to me you know just encouraging me and giving me scripture and that just means so much to me and I might not have told them but it means a lot to me because it helps me it knows that I know that they're reading in the scripture and they're they're wanting to be an encouragement and that's my desire here today that's why I Minister the Word of God because I just want to be an encouragement if I can be an encouragement to one person that's all that matters you might somebody might think that I'm boring that and that's fine as long as I can reach one person that's struggling in their life and if it helps them overcome then it doesn't matter all else is all else is fodder not to say that everybody's here fodder to forgive me I don't I don't mean that everybody means everybody means something but I just want to help one person that's my desire and I know my kids have the the same desire and it's it's so wonderful to know that they want to carry on the same that they want to help somebody that they they have the same heart all my kids have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ save one and he's only three but I look forward to whenever he's ready you know that we baptize him - so how much more can a daddy be blessed bear with me I'm not a preacher like brother Jesse I think barely very highly brother Jesse he's a magnificent preacher teacher a very good teacher but uh and also I know Memorial Day and Independence Day of past but bear with me through the well what I'd like to speak on this morning is raising the standard now as we read in Isaiah 59 in 19 the end of that verse it says the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against them if I'm sure people that have gone through school they have an idea of what standard means but here I'm the kind of person that likes to go it click on the word to see what it actually means in that verse because we in the English language we have many words there it's the same word but it has different meanings it'll have multiple meanings so it behooves us to go and see what that word actually means in that particular text because if you go with it with the assumption that it means something that you already know and you try to apply it then it it absolutely doesn't mean that so bear with me a little bit standard here in this particular verse means to flee to escape to take flight to depart to disappear to drive hastily to costs or to cause to disappear or to hide so in the enemy will read that verse so so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the Sun which we know that it would be the East so from the east to the west you know that they fear the name of the Lord when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall raise up a way of escape against him so when you're up against the enemy he's providing a way to be driven out hastily - he's given it provided away for an escape to flee to escape the situation amen in Psalms 27 and 5 it says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion is that right Amen isn't it so great to be hidden in his civilian in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock he's the one who set me up upon the rock he's the one who's hiding me he's the one who's delivering me from the problems in the situation's Amen Psalm 17 in verse 6 it says I have called upon me for that won't hear me isn't that great to know that he will hear us amen he says I am called upon me for that one hear me that assurance that David had wrote this poem the assurance that he knows that God is going to hear him he says incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech show thy marvelous loving-kindness oh now that save is by the right hand and pay attention to this right hand as we go through that that's save us by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppressed me from my deadly enemies who can pass me about now so I'm 60 and starting in the eleventh verse it says give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man as I said that we know that man cannot get it's great that men wants to help us but that's not where we put our trust we might give men honor but we don't give them our full trust because you never well I better stay away from that man can always fail man has always given up on his covenant with God is that right so man is the one who's always failed God has always kept every single covenant that he has given man man is the one who's always always always broken the Covenant so we know that God is faithful man is not Amen now let's turn to Exodus 17 in verse 9 I told you I had a lot of scriptures I'll get you some exercise and flipping through the Bible you know they say that the average buyer or the average home has about 9 Bibles and it and I think I told this story here before but there's a maid that was cleaning the house and the owner came home and they were looking for the for the Bible and they had asked the maid have you seen my Bible and she said you know how many houses I go into and I see the Bible and I'll hide it and nobody ever asked for it and you're the first person who asked for it yeah so I hope your Bible hasn't collected dust if it has throughout the week we'll we'll tear that dust off this week a man will tear it off this morning and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go go out fight with Amalek now I don't know about you but that just reminds me of another scripture over in mark 16 he says go ye out into the world and preach the gospel to every creature amen [Laughter] and tomorrow and now I'll get back to that and tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand so Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fraught with Amalek and Moses Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand Amalek prevail but Moses hands were very heavy there excuse me we're heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and her stayed up his hands see they're helping Moses to hold his hands up because whenever he lowered his hands the enemy was winning but when his hands were up in there and praising thank Thanksgiving to God and Dwalin and God is he had the victories raised in his hand he was able to overcome the enemy amen so here Aaron in her his brethren a brother and a brother-in-law because I think I hers is Marian's husband so his brothers were there helping him know overcome so you call out to your brethren for help amen amen that's a wonderful example to Christians in this day amen but her Erin and her stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side his hands were steady until the going down to the Sun and Joshua discovered Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven he didn't say from the earth he said from heaven and Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi for he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with Emelec from generation to generation now Amalek is a constant agitation to Israel is that right so therefore it's a type of the flesh because we have this we have this flesh it's a it's a constant agitation in our lives is that right it's a day-to-day battle now you sit down jesus said when I said March 16 jesus said go ye out into the world you're going to go to the world now preach the gospel this is not an easy thing to go out and preach the gospel because he also said that I send you out amongst wolves is that right so it's not going to be an easy task so it's not so much it's great to have somebody with you it's great to go in pairs because there's strength in numbers is that right but it's it's behooves you more to have the Spirit of the Lord with you then having a brother or sister with you is that right amen so but during this battle and like I said when Moses the hands were lowered that they were defeated the enemy was defeating Israel but when their their hands was raised in the air that's when they were too able to defeat the enemy but when we it shows that when we try to do it independently by ourselves we get wore out we get so tired we can't press on but when we join forces when we join forces that's when we're able to overcome and become the victors they men because it's nice iron sharpens iron it's nice to know and when I was down in the dumps I was getting into a depressed state there my children were giving me scripture there people were calling me text me saying we're praying for you just giving you encouragement and brother Justin reminded me of something that I preached here about the Eagles giving strength to one another you know feeding them meat the Eagles that of the older the elder Eagles that have gone through situations were dropping meat down to the younger Eagles helping to revive them because they've been through those situations and knowing that eating the meat of the word will give strength and build you up and help you to overcome is that right praise God now Jehovah Nissi everybody knows what that means it's one of the seven compounding the redemptive days of of Christ herve God Jehovah Nissi means God is my banner now what is a banner now this is going with standard this is a standard a banner is a flag a standard and ensign Jesus Christ as our ensign is he not and a rallying point something lifted up a signal poll a rallying point does everybody know what a rallying point us it's when you say hey everybody over here you know somebody's getting thumped on by a gang you're calling out to your friends am overhear rally over here this is where the fight is hey man so that's a rallying point you're calling the troops you're calling for backup but a banner is something that identifies and unifies a particular group of people for example a military flag or standard is sometimes called a banner IRA's caught also called Old Glory the Israelites saying the Lord is my banner was a way of identifying themselves as the unified followers of the Lord God a banner also functions as a rallying point for troops in a battle we'll get to that here in a second the author Moses built in Exodus 17 marked the place where God intervened on behalf of his people and promised to utterly defeat his enemies first Corinthians 10 and 13 it says there had no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but with the temptation also make a way to escape that standard we were talking about in Isaiah 59 he makes a way of escape that you may be able to bear it you can overcome it it might seem a little bit strong right now but just hold on a little bit longer there's too much of it there's too much suicides going on if these people just hold on a little bit longer there is light at the end of the tunnel there is a promise there is a hope of glory just hold on a little bit longer amen you're wondering if God really exists hold on he'll show himself amen he is faithful he is true just hold on a little bit longer you know it says here but with the temptation also make a way of escape that way jesus said that I am the way I am the truth and I am the life is that right so here is the way that will bring you out is that right instead of waving the flag of surrender sound the trumpet for help raise a standard and shout the bellow cried a rattle his troops Matthew 24 and 27 it says for is the Lightning cometh out of the east and shyness even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be for who excuse me for wheresoever the carcasses there were the Eagles be gathered together amen carcass what does the carcass everybody knows what a carcass is it is something dead if you see an animal carcass on the road you see a dead animal on the road now you can look at that metaphorically to say that somebody has fallen down so where so wherever the carcass is wheresoever and brother/sister has fallen down there where the Eagles be gathered to continue to give them that meat to encourage them to help them up him and lifting up amen so wherever that carcass is the Eagles the strong bird the strong bear no other bird could fly as high as that Eagle amen whoo I never realized that until this weekend about the carcass cuz you always think of something dead well where's wherever the Eagles are gathered but if you read before that and after that it's talking about something that has fallen down excuse me before that matter talks about about now I can't remember what it is now about raising up and I think it's a part of the rapture shortly after that talking about going away so when you see somebody down gather together strengthen numbers rally the troops together amen there's nothing more important than a good old-fashioned prayer meeting hey man if any man be sick among you call upon the elders and they shall lay hands on you and you shall recover did not God say I am the healer of all thy diseases I'm kind of getting off my nose right now but God said and over in Psalms don't forget all of my benefits for I am the healer of all all all my diseases every single disease there is a one that's gonna overcome him amen God is true strong for that Amen there are other false gods out there but they're not real gods at all you know there's many gods but they're false gods stand up to our Lord God and Savior a man but God is my banner you know lifted up let's turn to numbers 21 and verse sake am I going a little too fast this morning this is like the most personable church I know you're gonna have a conversation across it both it yeah it's kind of neat having a small a small group but numbers 21 and 8 where we read what a banner was lifting up a signal pole I can't think of a better signal pole than this uh it says and the Lord said unto Moses make the a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole now let's kind of get a background here if you don't know this story before here the children of Israel were just complaining and whining and just bickering amongst themselves having to having fights here fights there and nothing was going right for them you know just just like how we get sometimes in a sinner position you're just so lost you can't gain any ground you know you're just you're trying to tread water but you're making no progress that because that way is death we know the wages of sin is death so there's no progress there is no life to a sinful life amen to the the to a sinful way so therefore this is why God has written God has told Moses to raise us this fiery serpent he says and the Lord said unto Moses make the a fiery Serpent and set it apart a pole and his shall come to pass that every one that has bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it apart a pole and it came to pass that if the serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived so something lifted up it's just like in John I want to see on three and 14 this is the parallel of that scripture that we just read and it says and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up so I can't see more of a signal Pole of life and of rallying than Jesus Christ amen and then it says that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life now they're to say that a separated people know it's so in John 3:16 it says for God so loved the world it wasn't just specific people for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him shall not should not perish but have everlasting life now we know that their vessels of Honor vessels of dishonor we know that the certain ones can't come to that perfection they can't come to see that Jesus Christ is the truth the life in the way they cannot repent because we know that that's one seed that will not get there we know that there's a seed of God that's that's going to receive the word and to be able to accept the word and continue in his and his laws or in his statutes or anything that would when you hear the word you say yes Lord you might have a little rebellion afterwards but I know there's there's a scripture in the New Testament where the father said go into this and the man said no I'm not going to do that but what happened he turned and went the other way he repented and said yes I will do this thing but there was another son that said yeah I'll go and do it but he went the other way and didn't do it so we know that there's a certain group that's going to be able to accept it there's a certain group that then that the one that can and one that cannot is that right so I strongly suggest that you look into your lives and see if you're responding to the Word of God to see if you're accepting the Word of God or not Philippians 2 and 9 it says wherefore this is also talking about God as my banner wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father so whether it's a believer or non-believer one way or another you're going to bow the knee one way or another you're gonna bow the knee in acts 2 and I'm just kind of going through it I hope this helps somebody this morning X 2 and 29 I could be a talker out out of Muenster I could talk your ear off I could talk to people all day long but but sometimes here you know thoughts kind of escape a little bit so I have to stay and stay with the scripture I've never been accused or guilty of being able to think real well on my feet [Laughter] my perfect vision isn't ice a pine site [Laughter] X 2 and 29 it says men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet did you know King David was a prophet therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh according to the flesh that's very important he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption Jesus hath God raised up where of we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand there's the right hand again therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which he now seen here for David is not ascended David is not ascended and it's not the Prophet that has ascended for you amen for David is not ascended into the heavens but he sayeth himself the Lord saith unto my lord sit thou on my right hand there's the right hand again until I make thy foes thy footstool therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ who set him up the David set him up now David didn't set him up God has set him up in that position was David king of Israel and at the time yes he was there was he king at that time yes he was king but that doesn't mean that he was higher than Christ just his lineage was not going to Christ or the the the flesh Jesus was not going to or the spiritual Christ Jesus was not going to come through the lineage of of David it was just through the the natural man through Mary which it still didn't it was God who created all of it he created the seed he created the egg so the only flesh part of it was the incubator that was it that was it a man but right hand what does right hand signify most people are right-handed I'll say man what is it with the right hand right hand is dominant right hand signifies authority and power because I'm right-handed that's where my power is of course years ago when I was younger I found out that I hit harder with my left it's got a weird on that where sometimes you know this but right hand signifies power and authority now so I'm 60 and verse four says thou has given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth Selah that thy beloved may be delivered that's us you know David means beloved but think of us put yourselves into the scripture that died beloved may be delivered safe with thy right hand and hear me now going to the military if if I was a general and David was a lieutenant the one with the higher rank walks on the right when we salute we salute with the right hand we don't salute with the left hand we salute with the right hand this is a type of just military now bear with me I'm just trying to illustrate if we do this in the natural or walks on the right not marching marching is something different but when you're walking in pairs or in a small group the person with the rank is on the right side always Authority is always always always on the right now let's talk about our flag our lag our banner our standard of the United States the US flag which it's it's a had an evolution of different designs of flags over the years you know to me I don't know what a flag I don't know how you view the US flag which I'm a veteran if for those of you that don't know not that I'm bragging on it by any means but the US flag means to me it represents the people to me it does represent the government so when you see these people burning flags I don't take a defense if it was just against the government fine I can understand your anger against the government but when you're burning the flag when you're desecrating the flag to me that's a shot against each and every one of you and every citizen in this country meant F flag represents each and every one of you every all those stars is one individual state so it's a union they call that blue area the Union its unified it's a unity of people it's a unity of the American citizen now I'm not trying to get political I try to keep that separate but I just want to see I just want to illustrate of what the flag represents it represents the individual states and the thirteen colonies and all that and the the red and white they have there and the blue they all have their significant meanings of why they put the color there but we all have life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is that right so it represents you your benefits its your Constitution those are your rights so the same thing with this ensign he represents us because he died for us it's not so much of a government but it represents you he's come to save those that are lost that was you is that right if you are represented in him hey man pamphlets the flag has to be displayed in a certain way or it's perceived disrespectful amen it's perceived as an act of disrespect if you're gonna fly the flag the Union would always be to my right to the audience's left it would be to my right that's where the authority would be so if it's hung horizontally the Union is on the right okay when it's flown in a group if there's a couple flags the other flag will be to my left and the US flag would be to my right it's showing the authority of the US as as the greatest nation is what we feel is the higher power if you fly it fly a flag if you display a flag a US flag upside down it's considered that is it's a sign of distress a sign of emergency and just because Trump is president and they don't like it that does not declare it a state of emergency these people are flying the flag upside down it might be urgency to them but it's not a national emergency so if you're ever in trouble and you need help and there's no one around you flag your flight or fly your flag upside down to show that you're in distress to person or property that's that's the reasoning behind flying the flag upside down half-mast is a display of respect and honor to those that have fallen whether it be a senator or congressman a fallen soldier or something important that of course they don't do it for every every US citizen is important whether you're an immigrant or whether you're a natural-born citizen it doesn't matter to me I accept the immigration I accept that because we're all Pilgrims and strangers in this land a man this world is not my home and uh you also you're not supposed to allow the flag to touch the ground because it's it's considered an act of desecration but are you supposed to throw the flag away no you're just supposed to keep it from touching the ground because the the people beforehand they considered that as a state of fallin that it would be a fallen nation because that that flag represents the nation not so much the government you might disagree with the government but that flag represents us as a nation a United people the United States of America is that right so also when you're flying a flag if it's multiple Flags oh my it's supposed to be equal with all the nations or higher it's never supposed to be below if you have multiple nation national flags flying it's either supposed to be equal or higher never below so you gotta see what I'm getting at here we exalt the Lord Jesus Christ we put him higher and he thought it not robbery to be equal with God amen and he made himself lower than the Angels but he was raised and lifted up highers all right well my butt Psalms 20 and verse 5 I don't know what time ok you do have a clock back there what time did I come out bro I don't work but Psalms 20 and verse 5 it says we won't rejoice and thy salvation everybody everybody ok this morning we will rejoice in thy salvation and then the name of our God we will set up our banners we will raise our Flags in the name of our God is that right one nation we say the Pledge of Allegiance one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all so we raise our flag in the name of God and that's what they don't like so much but but the Lord fulfill all thy petitions now know I that the Lord sayeth his anointed he will hear from him he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our God they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright save Lord let the King hear us when we call no I mean I'm proud to be an American and I'll do whatever I can to protect that I will do whatever I can to preserve the rights of this country and that's why I served it was a sense of duty it wasn't because I wanted to go war and be some kind of a hero it was a sense of duty that I felt within me that I wanted to preserve the rights of every single American citizen I'm one guy what can one guy do nothing but strengthen numbers if I could add to it if I could put my shoulder to the wheel to help save this country now I don't agree with all the wars I don't agree with that I don't agree with how our countries handle things I'm not saying that I agree with everything that they did when I say that I'm American but we're rossette were represented American just like the Prophet said we were represented and when George Washington was there through all those battles Abraham Lincoln we had that representation as of the nation through all of her bumps bruises and her glory amen so I accept that because I still stand proud to be an American even though sometimes I'm I would be embarrassed because of some of the things that politicians have done but that doesn't take the pride away for being a natural-born citizen here where we have freedoms many more freedoms than what other countries have is that right do you even recognize the freedoms that you have did we brought that out do you does anybody know the first five amendments what's the first amendment Oh freedom of speech freedom of the press [Laughter] I'm just going to going to do this but I remembered I had this there's a brother at camp he went through it it was real neat the way he did it so I hope I can do him justice now forgive me when I say pride I don't mean though hearty haughty pride I believe you said I have pride in the work that you do but pride is an arrogancy being far from us to have it but the first First Amendment is Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances now you have the right to peacefully assemble which which we're here doing right we are here assembled together in a peaceful manner of course we want to stay here and beat the snot out of demons too so so you have the right to say to give your opinion each one of us here has a right to their own opinion and they have the right to give their own opinion now does that mean yes you could say anything you want and everything is fine and dandy no because everything that you say there is a consequence to it so use it that freedom wisely you have the right to say I am a Christian in this day you have the right to say Satan get thee behind me you have the right to say those things you can't don't let don't let Satan try to take your speech away from you - to quote scripture or to encourage somebody else don't you take don't you let him take that right away now does anybody know what the Second Amendment is right to bear arms thank you yes this is audience participation I'm not nervous anymore you nervous now did I make it second amendment it's not just bearing the arms but a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear arms and not be infringed you have the right to rally the troops together you have the right to rally brothers and sisters together to pray and write the bear arms you have the right to take the sword of faith and strike down every demon in your life is that right amen third amendment not very many people know this one but does anybody know it no no soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house so in the time of war if the soldiers come and say we're kicking you out of your house because that's what they used to do when the English were here there's a British they kick the people out of their own homes took their food and did whatever they want but this was established because of that no soldier shall in the time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner nor in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law so you have the right to kick out a demon that wants to try to come in in a house in your own he has no right to be there no matter what he tries to say to you I belong here he does it you have the right to kick him out when you get right with God now if you have sin in your life that that that demon has every right to be there but when you get right with God when you're living right with God you had the right to kick him out of your home now Fourth Amendment the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized so they have no right to come into your home and to unless they have a warrant to come in there those demons don't have a right to be there what does that scripture when when the man cleans his home and the in the the demon leaves if you don't fulfill that void with the Word of God that demon is able to come in there with seven other worse than him so you'll be worse off a man so you don't have to allow those things to come in there now the fifth amendment anybody know a fifth amendment is everybody's heard I plead the fifth right no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury except in cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when an actual service and time of war or public danger nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy oh that one's important so you have the right to not suffer double jeopardy nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself we have one accuser of the Brethren and he brought his case forth the viewer a sinner and he brought the case forth to God yep you were a sinner okay you were guilty as charged well once you repent you cannot be charged again for that same one you cannot be prosecuted for double jeopardy amen nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law so there has to be a court trial nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation so the government can't come in and just declare eminent domain and kick you out of your house but there has to be just compensation before they could take that amen so there's a little bit of lesson on the on the first five amendments I forgot about three when you know I thought I knew the other ones three and four I kind of forgot about it but that got me thinking if I don't know my constitutional rights do I know my biblical rights you know if I'm not studying if I don't know my natural rights do I know my spiritual rights something to think about so it behooves us not only as American citizens to know what your rights are but it also behooves us to read into Scripture to know what our spiritual rights are Jeremiah 51 and 27 now this is only illustrating of how reson raising a standard declares a state of war Jeremiah 51 and 27 it says set you up a standard in the land though he's saying raise the flag set up set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her the king of ararat many and that's not Alcatraz I know that but Ashkenaz appoint a captain against her cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars now he's saying set you up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations and prepare the nations against her so this is a declaration of war so raising the standard not not so much as what we're doing we fly the flag of buildings you might fly the flag at your house that's not a declaration of war but when you go to another country and you say we're here that's a declaration of war and you're there to fight revelation 17 and verse 12 I'll try to wind this down because I'm I don't even know if I'm halfway is anybody tired if you're tired you're more than welcome to stand up you're not going to offend me by any means revelation 17 and verse 12 this is this is just another illustration here and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast see they're rallying their troops together they're trying to combine their power amen we just read that so they have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast so they're combining forces these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful are you called are you chosen no are you faithful now you are able to overcome is that right because he's the Lord of lords and the king of kings and he's already overcome but just to show that they have declared war on the lamb they've declared war and if you're in him they've declared war on you now are you going to take that easily just want to read this quote here you might thinking that it doesn't pertain anything but just bear with me he says let us go back to the beginning in the original physical creation as we know it today God made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens rooster and hen there were two cattle the cow in the bull and right down the line but when it came to man there was only one they were not a pair Adam Adam had been made in an image of God he was a son of God as a son of God he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible so God took a byproduct of man to caused the fall woman never stepped fresh from the hand of God as a true product of God she was produced from man and when God caused her to be brought forth from man she was vastly different from the other females he had created now bear with me sisters when I read this okay it's going to come out good in the end trust me she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed Satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to very peculiar to a very peculiar position before God and his word she is the type of all things vulgar foul and loathsome on the one hand and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean and beautiful and holy as the receptacle of the Spirit amen and blessings of God see the position you women hold oh my so long as you use it in her pure form amen oh my and on the and she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornication on the other hand she is called the bride of Christ on one hand she is called Mystery Babylon the abomination before God and on the other hand she is called New Jerusalem our mother on the one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is summarily cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of God as the only place befitting such a queen oh my the one might call you dirty and filthy but that's the accuser of the Brethren before you repented and we're forgiven of your sins because God throws it in the sea of forgetfulness right we don't suffer and suffer double jeopardy you were forgiven of a once he cannot bring it again no matter how much he goes to and fro for on this earth he cannot bring that accusation up again for you are forgiven you were justified amen justified just if I'd never done it before Amen and in this diet errant Church age she is a dominating female she is Mystery Babylon she is the great she is Jezebel the false prophet is see how the other side looks that's how God use them you don't want to be viewed like that to God do you it would make you feel so pitiful so shameful to know that somebody's viewing you as a as a horror or an unclean woman amen she's Jezebel the false prophet is why because the truth female is submissive to God Christ is her head she has no word but his no thoughts but his no leadership but his he is our standard he is the one who was guiding us amen but what about this church she has cast out the word destroyed the Bibles and worthy assays of the godly she has slain those who had preached the truth she has taken over Kings princes and Nations controls armies and insists that she is the true party of Christ and that her popes are the vicars of Christ were in the place of that's what vicars means in the place of Christ she is utterly seduced by the devil until she in turn has become the seducer of others she is the bride of Satan and has produced his bastard child religions but listen up here all through the Dark Ages she is dominated for over 900 years she has plundered and destroyed she killed the arts destroyed the sciences produced nothing but death until the light of the truth was almost entirely gone pay attention to that let me say it again produced nothing but death until the light of the truth was almost entirely gone and only bares the sliver of light remained the oil and wine had almost almost ceased could to see the very elect if possible so the oil and wine had almost ceased to flow but though she dominated the world kingdoms and demanded that all men find their citizenship in her on the name of religion I hear that so many times then this was the Crusades is what they're talking about as a Roman Church if you weren't a member of the Roman Church if you didn't accept that they were going to kill you because you were an infidel whether you've proved you were a Protestant or not you profess Jesus Christ they didn't care on that if you were not a member of the Catholic Church you were gonna be slain and your family along with you so that's what he's talking about here and it was so dark in those times like he said there was a hardly a glimmer of light there was just a sliver of light in that day which the light of the light of the world is the gospel is that right the light of the world is Jesus Christ there is a little but there she dominated dominated the world kingdoms and demanded that all men find their citizenship in her there was a little group who belonged to God and their citizenship was in heaven this world I'm only passing through Imagi could not and then she could not destroy God kept his little flock God kept his little flock if he kept them there he'll keep you in this day is that right they could not be destroyed no matter how dark it gets in your life no matter how dark it might not seem that there's any light there hold on a little bit longer hold on a little bit longer this church of role was as heathen and wicked as Queen Athaliah who tried to destroy all the royal seed and almost succeeded all most succeeded but God preserved one and of him there came more of the faithful so God preserved a little flock in that long dark night and the truth there finally arose hey Luther oh my now what I'm going to get here when you're marching you see a group you see somebody marching along the line they what they have is the flag at the forefront it's a little standard it's called a guide on now that in the time of war they carried at the front oh my is there room here they carried at the forefront so what happens is is all the troops that are in the back they could see they had their eyes on that standard because he's leading wherever they're going in the battle because on what's that scripture I can't every battles with confused noise but this should be with blood oh my so you have this one with the guide on showing the way through the battle cutting through now if that flag fell if that flag fell so where's whatever the carcass is there the Eagles would be gathered if one is fallen the the one behind them would pick up that flag and continue it on ahead right so they could keep showing where the battle is they could keep showing the one way man now that's your responsibility if somebody's there for and you've got to pick up the standard you've got to raise the standard this the battle they declared war we're fighting for life is that right hey man please da oh man when I get who that was going to be old another message but if it's just so good right it's something so even though they tried to destroy the whole life they just they tried to destroy those of garlic and not do it hey that land could be you when everybody's trying to put it down you could be that voice you had the right to remain silent but you don't have to remain silent is that right you have a say just like anybody else they're trying to pull your rights down that's what they're trying to do they have declared war that group called antiva they have declared war on conservatives I don't know if you know that they've got weapons I just saw the thing the other night this this police officer was saying that these this group has gotten more bold they've gotten more weapons and the more organized the hold they've gotten more weapons and they're more organized than they ever were before and they're having a hard time fighting against it they're trying to tear the freedoms down they're trying to take your rights away now to me I see this is in this in as an Austrian of what the Prophet said that we won't be able to assemble peacefully here anymore I see the Austrian coming in do you say it Saints they've declared war on your peace they declare war on what you stand for and you stand for Christ is that right they have declared war this is the time where they're trying to change the freedoms they're trying to get rid of the Second Amendment they want to keep the First Amendment to themselves and only they have the free speech because when you give your opinion they try to shut you down that's it hypocrisy if I've ever seen it they fight and cry say we have free speech freedom of the press will stop lying and stop your cheating and let somebody else have a say so everybody's got an opinion everybody's an American citizen is that right we all have to share the same right so being far from us when we shut anybody else down that's hypocrisy who I don't think I've ever sweated like this [Laughter] but like I said they've more organized more or more armed than before they're anti-trump there are anti-christian they're anti white male and they are anti sound mind it's crazy what they're doing now it's crazy and did not brother brain say that that was going to happen Who am I they're going to be so far out of their mind and I could see that they're anti sound mind they've got to be I'll try to stop yelling at you talk to you like a civilized human being let me muster up my dignity again I want to get real with you this is what you're facing in this day that's why it's so important that we stay true we get our our minds and our thoughts established in the Word of God know what the Word of God says know your rights when you buy a piece of property I can't even take a drinker in when you buy a piece of property you go on you see what you pull at the house and you know say how big my place is see how we can run around and do whatever at least see what the rights you have see what promises you have because what your struggle without another standard say molta this is what you get when there's multiple meetings yeah we have a standard it's also a set of rules of things that should be the same you have standard sockets you have metric sockets measurements of weight and different things like when you get a kit it all comes standard there's a certain standard that's met a certain criteria that's met to be in the same package so when somebody orders it they get the same thing it's a repetitive thing it's it's maintaining the same criteria I guess that's probably the easiest way that I could explain it a government has standards they have regulations on on the EPA they have standards that these companies have to work by you know they have to fall within certain parameters or standards but the one I want to get to is is customs customs that we live what kind of life we live what you're used to doing are your standards high enough amen so if you see yourself when you see yourself not living right or or you see yourself forward a little bit raise your standard a little bit you got to be a little bit more discipline is that right first Corinthians 13:11 says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things a man having the same line that in order to receive the kingdom of heaven we have to receive it as children and in the mouths of babes oh my goodness my little three-year-old he says he says some good things man it hope get in the same he really believes God you know and just the things that a three-year-old says it kind of makes me almost embarrassed man if he's got faith that God's gonna do it where's my faith you know and I understand a lot more than what he does but he says this is going to be this is the way it should be that's that's the way I believe God's gonna do it you know and that's his mind frame and I appreciate that so we've got to be able to receive things as a child a childlike faith but don't act like a child what's the scripture be children and maliciousness you know be children are wrongdoing as far as don't do it on purpose you know but since we became a man act like a man you know put away the childish things we're not children anymore but like I said they've and the these people have declared war on us so sometimes we don't know how to answer these people they ask a question and sometimes to our shame we don't know the answer that's why I say we got to get into the word we got to know what the word says because we with a good conscience we ought to be able to answer every man that asks us of why of the hope that we have is that right I can't remember the word verbatim but it's not it's not that we're fighting them and wrestling them down to the ground and you know learning jujitsu and all this other stuff and and holding them down well you got it you got to do what I say it's not in that kind of a thing because I just told a fellow that that's the other day that if a man is thirsty you give him something to drink give him a glass of water don't put a fire hose in his mouth you know why is this serpents harmless as doves all right so we ought to know what the word says and give it in love you know it's not beating somebody down with the word of God second Corinthians ten and three says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ now how do you do that and having in a readiness to revenge how many has a spirit of revenge in there and there you know how many entertains that spirit of revenge I used to be a very vengeful person my wife would say if you did something to me I was going to get you twice as bad I was going to get you back with interest but I think God the revenge I want to have is what it says here and having any readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now 1st Peter 2 and 15 it answers it kind of in the same way just in a different light that for so is the will of God that with well doing you may put the silence in the ignorance of foolish men now I think I've said are here but preach the gospel use words as if necessary you know people are watching so sometimes they're watching the actions making sure your actions line up with the words that you said so for so is the will of God how many's looking for the will of God your answer right here that with well-doing you may put the silence the ignorance of foolish man knows I would come against you just like we read in the beginning and Psalms that the wicked you're coming to oppress them this is your way out this is your way of escape by your obedience and by your well doing you could shut them up because it will have no accusation against you as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of God honor all men just the ones in church oh man the ones you work with the ones that you really care not to be around it's kind of hard it's it's easy to be ridiculed for your wrongdoing and and persecuted for your wrongdoing but it's hard for when you do right and you get persecutors that right that's scriptural isn't hello as free now using your excuse me honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God and honor the king praise alone oh you've heard me rambling for a while yeah I'm gonna try and wind this down anybody been blessed this morning no glory not by me is by his words I pray for his leading because my struggle is I can get all kinds of stuff down and this could have been something real exhaustive but uh there's a time where it's got to be shut off brother Jesse knows there's a time you got it well they're just going to have to go view it for themselves if they want more they're gonna have to go back and read it you know and that's that's something that I I strongly recommend you know go back and read it some things I might have cut short go back and read these scriptures because you get more when you read the read more of the text you get more out of it because we're only getting small sections out of these things and I think each one of these scriptures are an encouragement to know that God is faithful and he is there in your time of need and even in this time of war and he's there fighting the battle for you you just be obedient to him is that right sorry if I bored you at all but I can't help but these scriptures they might not refer exactly to rapture but when I read it I can't help but think of the rapture does that make sense so when I read that don't don't think that I'm trying to portray it that this is rapture Scripture this is just what I think of when I read these it is that is that okay there's my disclaimer so now I'm not at fault no I'm kidding but Isaiah 62 oh my yeah this is the first definition of standard how he made a way of escape and made a way for us to flee I can't help but think of the rapture that that's how he's getting us to escape this old world hey meant oh my Isaiah 62 and verse 8 it said the Lord has sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely I will no more give my corn to to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink no wine for the which thou has labored now you got to understand I kind of go back that Israel was punished for a time and he let Israel's enemies pretty much have the reign over them and so he's saying enough is enough you've paid your dues no more so that that's kind of what he's saying here they're not going to take your corn anymore they're not going to take your Warren they're there your wine they're gonna have to provide their own anymore because this is wartime yeah but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the Lord and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people behold the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say he to the daughter of Zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they that shall call him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the Lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken now I can't help it at first Peter 2:9 and 10 somewhere around there it says that you were a holy nation a royal priesthood oh my the holy people that's one of my favorite scriptures Isaiah 11 and 10 it says and in that day there shall be a root of Jesse who is that root of Jesse we read it a little bit earlier that David wasn't the one to send it up into heaven but it was Christ that was the Senate under heaven and David was a root so you see where I'm going so you know what the root of Jesse is that's Christ so and in that day there should be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people we read it as a brass serpent was lift up social Jesus Christ be lifted up for the to save the people of the world for those that would believe on him to it show the Gentiles seek 10 tiles were considered the heathens those that didn't believe in the Jewish way you're considered Gentiles or Greeks or whatever it's it's a nation other than Jewish so the Gentiles you know to it shall the Gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious Jesus Christ is our rest he is our Sabbath David do you seek him to him or to inch of the Gentiles seek we are seeking him is that right our eyes are upon him our eyes are upon our standard the captain of the army amen and it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to what to recover the remnant of his people I know that's probably talking about the 144,000 and you know the people of Israel but I can't help but think of it as me as the as the rapture comes the calling away he's coming a second coming he's coming to take me away hey man woo which shall be left from Assyria and this is the natural stuff left from Assyria from Egypt and for path roast and from cush and from Elam I'm from Shinar from Hema Hamas and from the islands of the sea and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel that's us the Gentiles that's the way I see it anyways because I'm putting myself into the scripture and gathered together this the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth now we could I'm not going to write now but you can get into the teaching of the the outcasts of Israel and those that are dispersed of Judah you know that's that's all part of the Israel coming together at a later time I'm not a teacher I'll leave that up to brother Jesse thanks brother bro now Luke 17 and 26 you could see it as this day for sure it says and as it wasn't as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day of Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all you see a common a common situation happening here that whenever the righteous leave the scene chaos soon follows because there is no love left in the land to hold it together see how important you are oh my even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed in that day he would shall be upon the housetop housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife when she turned she turned to the pillar salt because she was looking unto the things that that was and and I think brother Branham said it was the desire that she had that she wanted to go back whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and the answered and said unto him where Lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is there there will the eagle's be gathered together praise the Lord there were the Eagles be rallied together at the rallying point praise God you stand to your feet this morning how does it feel I need to just cut it off there you've heard me talking a lot and I hope something was was of a benefit to you I'm about out of breath for some reason I need to start work it out they say I talk a lot but I don't think I'm used to talking this much yeah I recommend going back and reading Isaiah 59 in 19 I was going to review going back but but we spend a lot of time in scriptures this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music]
