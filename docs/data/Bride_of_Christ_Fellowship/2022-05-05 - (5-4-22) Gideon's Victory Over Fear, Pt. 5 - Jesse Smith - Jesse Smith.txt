wednesdays ago and called me remember that wednesday night you called me brother about that mark gentleman you witnessed to invite it you invited him to our church i haven't heard back from him but let's pray for him in a moment oh okay i just he came on my heart you know when i see you let's read verse 17 one two three and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so gideon's saying god has showed him what he needs to do to defeat the many knights and he says as i do you must do it praise god it's just a small little group there's only 300 there praise god yeah we have a small little group here tonight but we just want to do what jesus wants us to do praise god right he said the works that i do shall you do also let's pray together heavenly father we thank you god for your grace and mercy it's such a blessing to be in your house lord yeah your love never fails lord god never gives up never runs out on us you never let go through the storms through the trials you're constantly holding us lord god when we feel like we can't hold on you're holding us lord so we thank you for your blessings oh god we thank you for the holy spirit that we feel tonight lord god we're privileged people to be in your house and by the blood of jesus christ we come asking forgiveness for our sins today this week lord cleanse us o god let our robes be white in the righteousness of jesus christ bless us so god as we try to minister the word oh god help us to help us to all of us me too included lord each one of us to receive a portion from the holy spirit tonight father thank you for the testimonies of brother ray thank you for healing his shoulder we give you glory jesus thank you god and lord we pray for his friend mark that he witnessed to about our church a few weeks ago lord we just pray his heart would open up lord did he have a hunger to fulfill hebrews 10 25 about gathering more as he sees that day approaching and worshiping in spirit and truth according to john chapter 4 verse 24 lord i pray in jesus name help mark's eyes to open we pray and lord jesus we thank you for each and every one here tonight just bless us and minister to us bless those on the livestream as well in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you for being seated praise god gideon the man of faith yeah the man of faith praise god we ended last week by showing uh verse 16 the bible says here we ended uh where gideon after 11 we'd say thus saith the lords after 11 visitations from an angel from god himself yeah uh through the prophet of god uh that god sent her that's actually 12. i just got that that's 12. 12 visitations that's the kingdom number praise god the 12 tribes of israel praise god that's the kingdom that's a government number amen he had 12 visitations from god almighty finally after 12 visitations he has courage to do what god has borne him to jesus amen let me say lord help me to do what you birthed me praise god help me amen and you will do it by obeying the word of god by obeying uh the holy spirit gideon had to obey first uh by giving a sacrifice the angel received it he had to obey second by uh cutting down his father's grove yeah right what courage that was to kill or destroy the gods of his father yes now instead of fearing his dead he feared god more amen that's what we must do amen not fear man not fear woman not fair family but fear god amen fear god and keep his commandments that's the whole conclusion of the matter i didn't hear you praise god amen and after that by god's grace he blew the trumpet and got a new clothes which types the baptism of the holy ghost here in type and all the army gathers 32 000 and god said that army's too big they're going to exalt themselves like they had something to do with it and so gideon says those that are fearful can leave the battle 22 000 left 69 or 70 of the people left his church was down to ten thousand amen it went down from thirty-two to ten thousand praise god and then the god said it's still too big he said uh we gotta cut him down he said go down to the waters and those that bow down and like they're worshiping and then uh like they're worshiping waters and they bow down he said then kick out of the camp right yeah this this was the prideful group yes this was the group so these uh 9 700 that were left the 9700 was the prideful group of the self-indulgent group and god said if they bow down like that they don't drink like a dog if they're not humble praise god amen if they're not humble like that with their eyes on the enemy still all right if they're not prepared for battle send them away praise god yeah and see church that's what we have confidence in god will send those away that don't believe like us amen that's true the devils are hanging around for a while but god eventually when he's going to do something with us he'll send those devils away amen hallelujah and so now the fear of people are gone and now the pride people are gone and now the people that's left are the real believers the humble ones amen these are the ones that will not exalt themselves in this victory amen true and we and we showed by uh then showing how he needed one more one more thus saith the lord he already had 11 but he needed one more remember uh the prophet that came was the first one that's one i forgot about so actually 12 he needed a 12th word of the lord amen kind of reminds me of 12 new testament mysteries i think i'll just slide that in there real quick that's a good number there number 12 praise god hallelujah he says i need one more god said go down but if you're afraid right i said go down there and listen to the tent and you'll get one more dream and interpretation and there will be enough for you praise god but there it is the spirit of prophecy god foretelling what's going to happen in other words god knows exactly what you need so you can get the victory that he's called you to get true he he knows the he knows the odds are going to be stacked against us he knows especially with the rapture they're totally stacked against us but he knows how to raise our faith they mentioned just the right level amen yeah and that's what it will take praise god it will take faith that will be on the right level praise god you know it's called rapturing faith amen we know it's called the latter rain amen this brother says the teaching rain comes first the former rain he said next comes the harvest reign rapturing faith hallelujah amen amen thank god and so he goes down there he listens to the tent and he said i had a dream this uh this barley cake which was poor people bread this was common bread in other words this is the poor church this was the despised church yeah this was the uh this is the neglected church again and these these enemies knew there's overall they got 300 000 they knew they were going to be whooped by a bunch of despised poor of bread a small little church they knew they're going to be whipped by a a a a a rejected kind of church that was picking up momentum amen coming down the hill and would knock over and defeat the enemies amen amen the poor people the poor bread the common man amen the common man was going to get the victory by the grace of god amen glory hallelujah and you know i love what gideon did as soon as he heard it he the bible said he bowed right there and gave spontaneous worship to god you ever done that praise god yeah you ever just heard the word and oh my god you just gotta stop whether you're in the car yeah or wherever you are just gotta stop and give god praise amen yeah that's what i saw yesterday when i had my phone i saw that phone i saw roe v wade is going to be overturned i just stopped right there i had a spontaneous moment of worship amen because i've been praying for that amen hallelujah the bible tells us to pray for our government amen the bible tells us to sign cry for the abominations done in this city and that's the group that's marked by the holy spirit amen right hallelujah see because the holy spirit hates sin and so he cries out against it the holy spirit wants righteousness remember we sing that psalm brother amen sing that song uh break my heart for what breaks yours right that's just a beautiful line wow right we all we all think god serving god is joyful and we forget sometimes it's also part of it is grieving over sin too right so yeah our hearts want to be joyful our hearts want to be happy we love in other words we love the mountaintops but we also need to have some valleys amen right we need some valleys and lord make my heart happy for what makes you happy but also make my heart sad for what breaks your heart amen amen in other words tell me not to have a uh uh attitude towards sin that doesn't meet your attitude because god is a holy god amen and he hates sin praise god it despises it praise god god help us to have hearts like that amen amen so he had a spontaneous moment of worship he gave god praise and they went up to the boys there that's kind of where we left off there the bible gideon told them he said he returned uh and he told them to get everything ready in verse 16. he said divide yourself in three companies yeah he gave every man a trumpet then he gave every man an empty pitcher an empty vessel could it be a full vessel had to be an empty vessel and lamps within the pitchers so they had an empty pitcher and they had to put a lamp in under it and hide it this little light of mine i'm gonna let it shine right but it has to shine at the right time amen right hallelujah in other words you your light is shining but god's gonna manifest that light at a certain time in a certain place amen just like god told joshua he said this day i'll be beginning to magnify you in the sight of israel praise god amen that little light has been hidden for so long praise god but now that light was going to shine amen amen in a trumpet a ram's horn hallelujah in every man's hand and we know trumpets speak of uh gatherings or war cries praise god so every man needs a cry of battle praise god a crowd a war cry amen every man needs a a a power a horn is a power as well right it's a power the power of declaring war in other words the power of going out to meet the enemy amen amen amen and he had a vessel empty vessel and he had to have his lamp inside of it praise god and then verse 17 he said look on me do what i do when i come outside the camp it shall be that i do so as ye this reminds me of jesus jesus said the works that i do shall you do also amen hallelujah paul said follow me as i follow christ praise god so as we do as we hear the word of god we must act upon the word of god and we must follow the godly examples the bible says in hebrews follow the faith of those who are over you in the lord follow their faith watch how they live out their faith and you should follow that praise god aren't you glad we've had a prophet in this day who has shown us how to walk in the faith amen i didn't even break he had great victories but he also had failures but he knew how to pick himself up in other words he knew how to repent praise god amen hallelujah thank you lord he knew how to do that he knew how to rejoice and have victories but he also was a man he failed he said sometimes i don't even feel like i'm saved that's true um and he was a star in the ham was sort of one of the seven stars in the hand of jesus he was a burning and shining light like john the baptist four seasons thank god we got to hear and learn about that season so it can help our lives to shine right for jesus amen amen hallelujah and we can follow his faith as he follow christ that's what i love you know i told this brother austin the different ones you know when i come in the message i was just all about doctrine but they can't preach that sermon just once more lord in our church and then my eyes got opened up wow i want to see more supernatural and so that's when we would go over to guyana and trinidad i think i made four trips over there and on those trips i saw the greatest movement of god i've ever seen as far as supernatural wonders and miracles and that's when that's when truly i could see i could see the things brother ram talked about pointing me to the bible and then i did what was in the bible and the bible became a new book amen where the bible said cast out devils i cast out devils when the bible said lay hands on the sick they shall recover i laid my hands on the sick they shall recover they did recover either praise god whether it was kidney stones or nerve damage or or healing from abortions forgiveness from abortion we had those confessed over there too all those kind of testimonies the works that jesus did we do also amen amen follow me as i follow christ paul said amen now let's look at verse 18 then he says when i blow with the trumpet i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camps so they're going to be in three groups group maybe a group here group there group there three groups all around the county and he says say this she says when you blow the trumpet they have to blow for a little while then stop right there they can't they can't say this and blow the trumpets at the same time so they've got a blow and then they got to say the sword of the lord and of gideon now i love this i love that god just doesn't say the sword of the lord i love that god gives getting a little part of this guy yes god that's him let him fight a little bit back guys amen hallelujah see that's what god always uses man it's the same man amen amen god could have the son preach the gospel god could have trees preach the gospel you could have pictures and pianos preach the gospel but god said man hallelujah men and women men and women to witness and win souls and be a testimony praise god god gives a man something to do praise god true that's just like i love how the book of mark 16 ends the bible says and the disciples went preaching everywhere the lord working with them confirming the word with signs wonders and miracles following abraham right one time when i was in guyana i woke up and the lord gave me the sermon and i knew it was a sermon and we went out to preach it was a young people's meeting and i stood there it's the only time i've ever done this brother i said if god doesn't vindicate this service then i'm a false preacher wow i never said that before i've never said a sins yeah that's how i know it's god and i preached and i was preaching and i said i challenged young people i said you need to repent and i said i will be the first one down to the water to baptize you we baptized 20 kids that day praise the lord and god vindicated that word because it wasn't my word it was his word including the pastor's children amen amen that's what i said when they come up i said pastor you baptize them they're your kids you do it after all i just kind of live it was like 90 degrees 100 degrees after that i just kind of laid in the water enjoyed that you know we're not preaching and baptizing 20 or so people but see god vindicates his word god gives us a part in his ministry praise god in other words god will work with us amen let me see like this god won't work against us as long as we're humble right right because the bible says god opposes the proud right that's true but he exhausts the humble praise god in other words god would work with the apostles because they would humble themselves and then god would vindicate the word of god this is going to tie into what i'm going to say at the end of the sermon once i turn off the livestream a little testimony here the sword of the lord and of gideon now verse 19. so gideon and a hundred men that were with him came into the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle of the watch i searched you know what the middle watch is what's the middle watch midnight huh so this battle or this cry is going to go out at midnight time another time of the rapture i don't know another time i think last week we showed you about six or seven types in here on the rapture this victory didn't come uh in the eighth year it came right after the seventh year there was no eighth year of where they were famine there was only seven praise god there's only seven church ages there's not eight church ages praise god this victory came after the prophet left the scene glory that's why the bible said that's why he said if god is with us where's all the miracles hallelujah and that's what we are that's where we are the prophet's off the scene but here we are and god is with you you mighty woman of valor you mighty man of matter god is with you and god will fight for us and god will make us win amen hallelujah as long as we're humble he won't share his glory with the prideful no he will not do that that's why when we see the pride in the message that's why we know god's not gonna rapture them because they'll be prideful they will say it was their righteousness they did it he does not share his glory with anybody this verse proves it this story proves it amen god ain't gonna let anybody get glory for this it's going to be the humble that learn to wait on him and follow the lead but rather said with gideon i think the second seal remember brother madam said that richard that quote but said those that catch in the little things will be the ones who catch you if not he said they'll miss the rapture it'll go right over the top of their heads true oh church it's the little foxes that spoil the vines yeah it's the little things praying here's a big thing that's little little thing making repenting to others when you do wrong amen humbling yourself in the sight of the lord the church said that it looks like a little thing but it's actually a big thing yes it is humbling yourself saying sorry yeah making amends for wrong right that's real thorough repentance hallelujah amen amen but if they miss it on these little things how about fasting and praying if they miss it on the little things fasting praying reading the bible confessing sin just being a a real genuine christian if they miss it or that but man said they'll miss it a million miles amen that's right church and it ain't works it's grace because paul said i labored more than all of you not worse but the grace of god that was with me that's good jesus was the greatest missionary there ever was sure he was the greatest preacher there ever was it wasn't by works it was by grace amen hallelujah he was full of what grace and truth there it is right there amen full of grace and truth amen full of god's favor amen amen amen thank you jesus now midnight and now they had newly set a watch and they blew the trumpets and break the pictures that they were in their hands yeah and the three companies blew the trumpets and break the pitchers and held the lamps with only 300 men yes and god was going to defeat them without one sword amen amen hallelujah all because god could get a man in his own hand amen he could get one man in his hand to clean out his home life yeah to believe the word of god yes to test god with prayer amen to say god give me signs amen give me a sign let me know you're with me god if you're with me where's all the miracles let me know you're with me praise god can i say like this god take all the fear out of my heart that's it right that's basically what he was saying lord take all the fear out if you want me to do this i need all my fear god i need to replace with your faith hallelujah all right that's what we need today amen right that's what we always need praise god it's the faith of god to cast out all fear amen that's right help us jesus then the bible said what was the first thing that went the trumpet now this is a little different than the shout voice trump right oh yeah so it's not a perfect type but it is a type amen because you have a trump trumpet so they blew the trumpets praise god and they break the pictures with their hands so imagine you have the trumpets blowing [Music] you and all of a sudden all these soldiers are sleeping these new soldiers are just wide awake all of a sudden trump is now trumpets was no joke in those days no when you were in a trumpet it was like the siren like the tornado siren that went off yesterday did you hear that we were in a giant eagle the tornado siren siren went off the girls like oh daddy what's going to go i said honey let's pray all right let's just bow our heads and pray we pray by the time we got outside everything was fine but god's grace yeah just in every situation god is in control amen but that was a big deal now what what historians say i like this idea historians said that now remember the midi knights had three other armies with them they hit titan i can't remember the other one but historians really believed when they heard those trumpets they thought it was an insurrection they thought some of the armies that they were teamed up with had actually turned on them you're right hallelujah because you can't have real uh one accord you can't have real unity with satanic devils right right devils always fight each other don't they yeah look at look at all the sinners they're always bashing each other and jocking for position and roman says devils that cause wars amongst the nations they really can never have any unity that's my church no matter how small we are one thing we've got that they don't got is unity in the holy spirit hallelujah amen we are one of the spirit we're one of the lord praise god and we know that the unity is being restored i don't know praise god one thing they don't have is real unity so all of a sudden everybody's woken up by 300 trumpets and after the trumpets blow they hear a crashing of vessels so trumpet crashing wow 300 of them right in a row so they're they're they're shocked by the loud sound and they're shocked by the brokenness i love this the bible said god is near unto all those that are of a broken and contrite heart this we gotta have a yeah ready for war i don't know we've got our power we gotta have power for war and we must have broken vessels god won't use the pride people right that's right i'm talking about the homosexual but also the pride for the message saying they're the greatest the greatest christians of all time that's what they say they're the greatest of all time i'll show it to you on sunday i show it to them brother six minutes of it we're the greatest we're the greatest young people we're the greatest preachers we're the greatest mothers we're the greatest that's a lie that's right that's a lot how can they claim that when even jesus wouldn't claim that for people he said that he said it's not for me to tell you who's on the right that's happy god amen that's right they exalted themselves to equal in jesus because now that or maybe higher because they know sitting on the right left when jesus didn't even know hallelujah right right and a real great person will never say they're great anyway that's right so the ones that say they're great they're not great right that's pride talking yes it is so trumpet breaking a vessel should crash crash crash crash trash crash and then all of a sudden they come out of their tents and then 300 lights like imagine pitch black and all of a sudden 300 likes and it makes them go crazy yeah amen the light of god amen the light of god shined upon them praise god amen imagine having a light so powerful it caused a nation to kill itself that's what they had right 300 lamps glory 300 testimonies amen they have 300 oil filled holy ghost wise virgins amen [Applause] praise god amen and the treasure of god was hidden in vassals hallelujah wonderful amen when it came time to fight praise god the vessels had to have to be completely broken that would be completely yield to god and then their life the light of god manifested because that's what light is it's the manifested word it's life the bible says thy word is life yes it is amen yes it is the word is light and life hallelujah amen amen verse 21 and they stood every man in this place round about the camp and all the whole swan and cried and fled so trumpets and then breaking the vessels uh clay vessels crashing and then lights it caused everybody to just pick up their their sword and run and cause complete chaos that's what god's word does amen to demons hallelujah when you speak the word of god the demons have to flee amen praise god jesus didn't say if you believe you might cast out devils jesus said when you believe they shall cast out devils that right right you shall cast out devils praise god when you believe devils have to move and the church said amen so see they let their light shine they're broken they're declaring war and the enemy starts fighting themselves verse 22 and the 300 blew their trumpets and the lord set every man's sword against this fellow even throughout all the hosts and the hosts fled to beth shita in zarah and to the border of abel meloha unto tabah so let's look at this again they blow the trumpet they break the vessels they're broken they let the light shine and i left this one out on purpose and then they shouted the sword of the lord and of gideon today amen and we already know some of that man was having nightmares about this i wonder if they were having a nightmare right at that time amen hallelujah they had neighbors they knew the sword of the lord they knew they knew gideon's name praise god praise god in other words god had put the fear of him and his servants in the hearts of those yeah praise god just like rahab amen when they talked to rahab rahab said we know your mighty army we know your god is great we are troubling in our booth the same thing happened there when you stay with god god will stand for you amen amen it might look impossible church but just keep saying with god god will make your enemies flee god will make your enemies fight against themselves amen and you'll come out on top praise god that's true hallelujah and they cried the sword of the lord look who's first i love this who's first place god's always first place yeah amen let's start with gideon let's start with brother graham then it started with paul then it's our repeater let's start with jesus [Applause] the sword of the lord and god who's not going to use gideon that's right hallelujah and notice church do they have any swords at that moment no not at that moment there was other jewish camps the guys some of the guys that left they were camped a little bit further away they were the ones that had swords now did they eventually get out the swords yes but this is speaking of the spiritual sword amen because in revelation 19 hallelujah at the end of the tribulation someone's going to come out of heaven on a white horse praise god and something's going to come out of his mouth and it ain't blowing kisses at the devils and all these antichrists it's a sword and the bible said with it he smites all the nations amen the sword of the lord and then there's the sword of gideon as well that reminded me of your brother when he got the when he got the king sword out there yeah he said he was lifting up praying in his eyes he said looked up he said then come i saw a sword he said it was so feather and sharp oh my he says he said i took in my hand and he said it fit my hand exactly praise god i see the word will fit you perfectly yeah this because that is the message fits me perfectly praise god i love the bible praise i love god's spirit i love god's prophets i love the seven church ages i love marriage and divorce i love water baptism i know there's one god in the goddess there's not three persons i love all the word of god it fits me perfectly amen amen so does he you right i like wearing mother's clothes i like cutting my hair praise god i like to live in a clean line i like living an honest life i like confessing my sins i like trusting in jesus i like having faith in christ amen amen he fits me perfectly then brother said he started thinking he said well this is a sword he says the king sword he said well what what king would it be he said not a king the king [Applause] let's just say anybody's and your king is the king of king song [Applause] here's the most beautiful parts i believe to me after the story he said it's the sword of the lord he says the sword of jesus the sword of the king he said it's the sword that i live by amen that means brother ray he had been packing that sword all those years and when the devils would stand there he stand against witch doctors hallelujah that angel would take out a sword amen is that right the chairman's have swords hey brother brad now we're going to run for his story it wasn't a spiritual sort really like a sword it was speaking the word of god amen because when jesus comes the word comes out like a sword amen so what is the word in your mouth the word is in your mouth a sword as well hallelujah what's the armor of god you got the feet you got the uh the belt you got the head you got the breastplate oh you got the shield of faith but one thing you've got is the sword of the lord as well amen hallelujah and church what do we live by we live by the word bless god we live by the spoken word of god grace's holy name i'm not going to talk bad about that brother that's the word right because the bible says not to praise the lord i'm not going to steal because the bible says thou shalt not steal you're living by the word now hallelujah amen i'm not going to make any bad deals because the bible says be honest with all men true praise god yeah see whatever battle you're facing when you speak the word to it that's letting those sword of the holy spirit go out of your mouth and you stand there and you you watch god's weapon you watch god's word speak and it'll work and the bible says you'll live by it praise god hallelujah what we live by church the sword so see this army not only did they have the sword of the lord they had the sword of getting as well hallelujah gideon's spoken word and also the natural strength praise the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah wonderful so it's a beautiful picture of the christians battle yeah a christian must yeah they have treasure in the vessel but there's times where they got to let that light shine when when they're broken when they're broken and really humble that's when the light shines the brightest ray god i don't know yet that's when you see their real light oh there it is but someone's really broken and repentant and someone's really humble and real sincere that's when you see their life praise god amen hallelujah amen that's when you see it that's okay this that's when you see if they have any light right amen yeah but it won't be the fearful it won't be the problem no no the humble yes yeah they will be ready to war yes and brother said we're getting ready for spiritual war he said we got to be uh i can't share the quote with me the other day he said we're going to a war of the word we're getting ready for a spiritual war brother ram said the last showdown is between the denominations and christ yeah we're coming to a showdown and the church said amen we're coming down to a final battle a squeeze battle praise god we're coming down to where america is going to change laws to force the bride from stop preaching sure hallelujah brother said before that that evil cowardly plot can happen he said jesus christ will come and rescue his bride amen amen why because she's living by the sword she's speaking the word of god she's believing the word of god how many know god will do it amen amen do you think god will let any wrath yes you do the same if you really love somebody praise god the sword of the lord and i'll get in the bible said the devils started killing each other they started fighting each other sure in other words they're no longer the devils are no longer looking at me i've got a season of rest now i can just stand here with the light of god i can stand here with the sword of god i can stand here and god's provided a place of worship amen hallelujah i can stand here praise god while the enemy is all tied up with themselves yeah what a beautiful story yeah god is so faithful yes he is he makes the enemies fight themselves in other words they don't have to lift a finger at this time now god gives him a little taste of the battle a little later but this stage god lets almost 300 thousand start killing each other and the enemy starts defeating itself praise god that's when you really know you're gonna have victory praise god when the enemy starts uh defeating itself when the problem starts when the solution starts happening and you see it and you didn't do anything that's when you know the victory is coming praise god amen verse 23 and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of manasseh and pursued after the midnights okay so now uh uh israelites other than the 300 start joining of the battle okay and they start chasing down so men of naphtali asher manasseh these three other tribes now the other guys doesn't sound just like david and goliath david went out there all by himself and then after he defeated then everybody else wanted to join him then they had faith to join the church said amen that's what jesus did same thing don't feel bad about the other guys there's only one david glory there's only one jesus amen you and i couldn't defeat death you and i couldn't be defeated alive but jesus could defeat goliath amen and now brother ray he's purchased our victory amen he defeated death he conquered death he held up death's head he stomped on death he said death where's your sting amen and now we run after we chase out and now we give entries all because of david his great victory christ's victory amen amen that's right hallelujah same thing here gideon gets a great victory with his people and then all the other israelites get the spoils oh that's exactly what jesus did jesus got the great victory we all enjoyed the spoils amen when we prayed for uh your mother-in-law sister lena that was the spoils of what jesus paid for on the cross and sister naomi prayed and brother austin prayed and your mom was found and she's alive and well today hallelujah what is that that's the spoils that was just us because the main enemy's been defeated hallelujah glory praise the lord the head of the serpent has been bruised his head is bruised the poison will never get to us amen sorry hallelujah glory death has no sting grace has no victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ amen amen and all we do brother is get the blessing of what jesus did we just get the spoils of his great victory two thousand years ago bless the lord thank god amen yeah what a blessing hallelujah verse 24 and getting sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto beth bara and jordan then all the men of even gather themselves together and took the waters onto beth barra and jordan and they took the two princes of the many knights auram and zeb and they slew orb upon the rock aurab and ziv they slew at the winepress of zeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of orb and zeb to get in to the other side of midian i'm sorry other side of jordan remember what does midi night mean it means strife so look at this spiritually jesus was going to give them victory over strife and divisions in their church strife and gossip and bittering had entered into israel and entered into the church and evil spirit had stolen all their victories for seven seven years and the church said wow look at the spiritual type and gideon means humor he had to cut down what had grown up oh hallelujah amen i didn't know something that growing up didn't john the baptist said take the axe to the root of the training glory amen so we want strife what we want strife to leave our lives or our family or our church or anything like that what does it take it takes obedience to the word of god it takes all fear being cast out it takes the removal of idols out of our homes it takes us getting signs from god knowing exactly what to do and it takes us to have a trumpet of war in our lips hallelujah we have to have the attitude of war and we have to have by god's grace we got to have our fire hidden in earth and vessels and we must be broken vessels if we're going to drive out strife divisions arguments did the bible say paul said let there be what no divisions among you he said but all speak the same thing he said in philippians 3 16 walk according to the same rule the same judgment god wants a united bride of christ fellowship god wants the united believer spoken word tabernacle god wants us united not not focused on our differences focus on what unifies us right the blood of jesus christ the power of the holy spirit the power of god's sword amen praise god now we ever look at these guys names what does zeed mean and this will mean something to sisterhood z means wolf remember the dream that brother men had yes remember that one we were having church trouble wolf they had to defeat zeb the wolf and then paul said paul said i warned them for three years that wolves would enter in men that had perverse teachings were wolves that would come in not sparing the flock drawing to themselves disciples after their own selves dividing the church that's true true they had to destroy those wolves aura means raven i forget the meaning of that one but you know ravens aren't actually fed elijah there was good use of ravens one time but see strike and wolves and all these things they're only removed by what the sword of the lord amen the word of the lord brokenness the light of the baptism of the holy ghost amen hallelujah amen a brokenness and a sounding of war doing your part so that the battle can be won praise god hallelujah how do we believe you can win the battle amen church if gideon can be over 300 000 with just three hundred then all things are possible to them that believe remember i showed you that last week abraham had 318 brother ray he had 318 and he defeated those five kings in genesis chapter 14. and who met him after that melchizedek amen gideon had smaller than that hallelujah and still it was it didn't make any difference because it wasn't about gideon it wasn't about abraham it wasn't about them it was about almighty god amen amen church that's how it is for you no matter your battle no matter your obstacle my obstacle it doesn't matter the obstacle what matters is that god is with us that's it and we do what god tells us to do yeah that's true in other words when we hear can i say this when we hear 12 thus say the lord sermons in a row right we get guest ministers in here or your pastor whoever it is when we get 12 words in the lord let's obey them let's not forget what church was about on sunday let's not forget what church is about on wednesday let's obey what the word of god that's how you get to the says where god starts driving out strife god starts driving out wolves hallelujah that's how the battle is won not by might 300 didn't have much might compared to 300 thousand not by power they didn't have swords glory they walk into a battle all they've got is oil oh my god it's oil and lamps and ram towers amen hallelujah not my might not my power but by my spear by my sword saith the lord almighty hallelujah amen that's glorious look at that church so we can see how it's a type of the shout voice and the trump they had a shout that is the sword of the lord and if giving get in they had a trump now uh i'm not sure how the voice is the light i mean i'm not sure i have to study on that one but see that's the same thing with uh jericho they had two out of the three remember that two out of three at jericho they shouted that's when the walls came down uh the voice they had the trump as well they blew the trumpets on on the uh the seventh time around on that seventh day see so these types there's there's not perp they're not perfect types of rapture but there are they are still types of the rapture and we can see it in there hallelujah hallelujah your word is light lamp into my feet and a light into my path yes sir yes sir praise god we can see it church we can see this beautiful type there the bible says in psalm 34 the righteous cry the lord heareth and deliver them out of all their troubles the lord is nine to them that are of a broken heart and save as such as be of a contrite spirit see the broken heart many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them praise god thank you jesus and this deliverance was going to last one week brother right this wasn't going to be a one-week victory with a million nights ago the bible said it was 40 years amen entire generation amen hallelujah hallelujah right see you bye bye obeying god god will bless your next generation amen yes that's gonna bless my children god's going to amen your children if you honor god and you love god and you keep the command and if you take the sword of the lord and of yourself by god's grace the word of god in your mouth the generation will be blessed amen the word of god hallelujah and church i just heard this week this was the last time israel had any rest until samuel the rest of the judges he was the fourth judge that means there was eight more judges they never were ever ever free again wow after gideon gideon was the last time because for whatever reason he had the character he was the last judge that actually had character to really obey the word of god now listen church how many christians you know that would be like you didn't say god give me a sign and i really i would pray really hard all night say god give me a sign how many would take how many do you know would take 11 sermons 12 sermons in a row and actually obey all 12 in a row probably not very many would they i'm talking about denominations now how about message people how many of you know that take the word of god that sincerely so see all the last eight judges none of them were like that samson got a couple few victories but he's a very sensual man yeah very sensual man he couldn't get the victory like gideon could like othniel could he was the first judge but a mighty man of god and all these uh uh deborah yes yeah yes hallelujah great men and women of god hallelujah love the word of god then obey the word of god amen praise the lord hallelujah they shouted the midianites on land just like israel shouted down the walls of jericho amen there was a shout in the camp hallelujah praise god let me close so gee church we see very similar things here this was just like ii chronicles 20 when the spirit of the lord came upon jehaziel and he said be not afraid nor dismayed by reason the great multitude for the battle is not yours but god's thank you lord church in every situation we can just look at it like this this is not mine to win i can't even win this praise god i have no power in myself to win this i have authority but it's got to be at god's time and season amen that's the truth i am powerless and i myself i am no match for satan unless god comes and backs up his word and stands with me and i obey all his word then the battle is not mine the battle is the lord amen amen praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord see the promise people going in people go into trials or go into situations thinking they got the power just because they're emotional because oh god help me before no you still need to be broken you still need to be humble the church said amen god will fight against you if you're prideful he resists the pride the problem but he exalts the humble amen hallelujah he even told them that john hoshabat you should not need to fight this battle stand still and see the salvation of the lord amen hallelujah what a blessing church yes how many can see you you're yourself in this story amen i can see my whole life in this story right i've had to learn the prophet's gone off the scene come on brother ray right the prophet's off the scene well who's here god needs somebody to be a valiant man or woman praise the lord who's going to take god at his word you you that's right you you you you you're the gideon amen where the where are the little army guys raising up amen and don't take the numbers god's not in quantity god's equality amen amen i got a good event on that on sunday hallelujah john the baptist preached six months brother ray and it was greater than all the 40 years of moses's ministry jesus christ said so he said there's not been a man born of woman greater than john the baptist it's not about quantity it's about quantity how do you praise god amen amen it's true enoch how do you take the rapture it wasn't the quantity of people that was with him it was the quality of his walk yes is that right the only one that god took in that that day you're right god intake quantity got to quality yeah so never let the devil whisper in here say get behind me satan you're right god let 300 men defeat over 300 000. god let 318 defeat five kings god took one man out of the anteluvian age when everybody else well when others were good people but god only chose one right so in other words you and i could be that one to praise god you can stop the livestream here god bless you live streamers love you all the lord i'm going to finish with a few personal things home church if you want to hear it just contact me if you want to hear it i'm going to end with two just things i want to share
