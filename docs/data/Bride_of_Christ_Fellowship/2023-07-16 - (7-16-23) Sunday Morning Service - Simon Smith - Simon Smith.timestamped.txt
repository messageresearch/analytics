[0:52] this way and there was a demon coming
[0:53] that way and I sent this come down and
[0:55] this come down and I stop that and and
[0:57] then then she prayed and then I was able
[0:59] to bring a fuller Deliverance a greater
[1:01] and then we'll see where we failed
[1:04] and the person will be like well I don't
[1:06] know why I went with this Lord but in
[1:07] the Lord was a
[1:08] I got this I'll take it from here and
[1:10] it'll go on and say well you miss this
[1:12] and you should have been here this time
[1:13] if you had only heard my voice a little
[1:15] bit clearer a little bit and if you were
[1:16] to believe my word and
[1:18] all that and still the person will be
[1:20] like well praise God it'll be there's no
[1:22] sadness over there's no disappointment
[1:24] there's no it's all Perfection over
[1:26] there it's divine love
[1:29] amen so
[1:30] let's get into this here by God's grace
[1:32] I
[1:38] so I got the text kinda
[1:41] early yesterday or however it was and uh
[1:45] from her pastor for the Jesse there
[1:48] uh man it's been nice to hear brother
[1:50] Ben Murad
[1:52] that guy is a power he's got the mental
[1:55] capacity of a minor maybe a small
[1:57] computer maybe you know
[1:58] I mean I can't remember half the stuff
[2:00] he says uh when he comes and ministers
[2:02] for us uh but uh you know the Lord knows
[2:06] so anyhow let's see oh wow we got a
[2:09] praise the Living God so
[2:10] let's go to Acts 1.
[2:15] Northern faithful he's watched over us
[2:17] all week
[2:18] there's nothing to complain about
[2:20] nothing to worry about
[2:22] uh we're just uh
[2:25] you know I keep thinking about my life
[2:27] and just uh
[2:29] where he's placed me I think and you
[2:31] know where you go you run through your
[2:32] failures and
[2:35] just don't know how the Lord was able to
[2:37] uh
[2:39] do what he did I I remember when I was
[2:41] in college and I was just a heathen I
[2:42] had no cares and just wanted to do what
[2:44] I wanted to do and
[2:46] um and now that was what 2000 or 1995
[2:49] through 99 and
[2:51] I lived for myself I did whatever I
[2:54] wanted and now here 20 plus years later
[2:56] I find I don't have one free moment to
[2:59] do anything I want to do you know it's
[3:00] uh
[3:02] it's always either for somebody else
[3:03] it's for one of the Bride members or for
[3:05] helping someone that's uh you know down
[3:08] and out or however or it's for the
[3:10] ministry so that's uh how God ordains
[3:12] everything in Acts 1 and we'll start at
[3:15] verse 12.
[3:22] 13 14. he says then return they
[3:27] unto Jerusalem from the mount called
[3:29] Olivet which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath
[3:32] Day's Journey and they were when they
[3:34] were come in they went into an upper
[3:37] room where Abode both Peter James and
[3:39] John Andrew Phillip Thomas and Thomas
[3:42] and Bartholomew and Matthew James the
[3:44] son of alphaeus and Simon Zealot and
[3:48] Judas the brother of James these all
[3:51] continued with one Accord in prayer
[3:54] and supplication with the women
[3:57] and Mary and the mother of Jesus the
[4:00] mother of Jesus and with his Brethren
[4:02] and I'd like to jump to Acts 2 and verse
[4:06] 1.
[4:13] Acts 2 verse 1.
[4:16] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[4:18] come they were all with one Accord in
[4:20] one place
[4:21] and suddenly there came a sound of a of
[4:24] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[4:26] it filled all the house where they were
[4:28] sitting and they appeared unto them
[4:29] cloven tongues like as a fire and sat
[4:31] upon each of them and they were all
[4:33] filled with the Holy Ghost who began to
[4:35] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[4:37] gave them utterance
[4:38] and they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews
[4:41] devout men out of every nation under
[4:43] heaven so let's say a word of prayer Our
[4:46] Heads
[4:48] dearly father Lord Jesus Lord we love
[4:50] you and Lord You've ordained this
[4:52] morning Lord and you've moved your
[4:55] children around in such areas and
[4:58] such locations Lord you shut door here
[5:01] and open the door here and however
[5:04] but oh God you're in all of it Lord and
[5:06] we love you we trust you and Lord we
[5:08] pray a blessing upon this assembly Lord
[5:10] this this family of Believers this local
[5:13] assembly Lord God that you would
[5:14] increase Lord our faith God increase
[5:16] Lord uh the stature Lord they are under
[5:19] the perfect man God lord and Lord Jesus
[5:21] so we certainly love you bless them and
[5:23] keep the Lord in the name of Jesus
[5:24] Christ amen amen you may have receipts
[5:27] we're uh
[5:30] um so I was actually scheduled to do
[5:32] Sunday school for the the young the
[5:34] youngsters at home there
[5:36] and uh
[5:38] actually I'll be honest I actually
[5:40] actually I wasn't
[5:41] uh the young man I had scheduled to
[5:44] teach because now we got three young men
[5:46] who want to do Bible studies for the
[5:47] children and they're like brother side
[5:49] can I teach I'm like yeah let's let's
[5:51] test the water see how you do and now I
[5:53] have three and uh they are
[5:57] they're doing one by one and then the
[5:59] Young Brother texted me yesterday and
[6:00] said hey I I have to cancel I can't do
[6:03] it for this and this I said okay so my
[6:04] whole mind yesterday was after work was
[6:06] go home and study for uh Sunday school
[6:08] for the children then Pastor Jesse text
[6:10] me and said hey brother Ben uh canceled
[6:14] so now I had to had brother Dustin do my
[6:16] Sunday school so I could come here maybe
[6:18] next time I'll send brother Dustin out
[6:19] here I mean I don't know you guys want
[6:21] that I mean it's really Dustin's got you
[6:23] know he's got this hair he's got a sweet
[6:24] beard going and just real calm and
[6:26] collected probably run it like a
[6:27] business probably run it like a job site
[6:29] hey you worship harder
[6:32] get to work right yeah right so we'll
[6:36] see we'll see I'll talk to them about
[6:38] that uh remember Jesse actually so um
[6:41] uh this morning we want to uh go over
[6:44] just a little thought and I'd seen
[6:46] something in the quotes I'd never seen
[6:48] before and it was a blessing to me I
[6:49] actually taught this at my home church
[6:50] so it ended up being yesterday once
[6:53] again my wife and my sister-in-law took
[6:55] off
[6:56] to do their family things and because I
[6:58] always had to study and they left so
[7:00] brother cam was actually out of town too
[7:01] so I had to have Brody the big German
[7:04] Shepherd uh wrecking machine with his
[7:06] tail the size of a cedar and uh then I
[7:09] course had my little puppy so
[7:11] I didn't get much studying done last
[7:12] night because they're they don't want to
[7:15] play with each other necessarily they
[7:16] won't they're all both staring at me
[7:18] with their tongues out waiting for me to
[7:19] get up and to play with them and to to
[7:22] move and this and this I'm like guys I'm
[7:23] trying to study then they'll run out and
[7:25] beg for a treat and bark until I get up
[7:28] and it was it was Battle so
[7:30] we tried we did our best by God's grace
[7:32] so
[7:33] um
[7:34] other than that and then
[7:36] and and of course last Wednesday at our
[7:39] home assembly we had a special service
[7:44] and
[7:45] a brother had called me he gets our he
[7:47] got there first and said hey we don't
[7:48] have any power he did not have a key to
[7:51] get in the church but he's texting said
[7:52] there's no power
[7:53] so the assembly we got there and we
[7:55] realized that just our section of the
[7:57] street was shut down with power
[7:58] everything else was on I mean the street
[8:00] lights were on everything's on just our
[8:02] row of buildings was off and um
[8:05] so I brought my I had my flashlight with
[8:07] me always and then uh Dave had his but
[8:10] cam had one there at the church and we
[8:12] had like a flashlight service and it was
[8:15] a special service so the Lord was
[8:16] dealing with a couple topics and
[8:18] and that's the saints of God that's why
[8:20] we don't miss church
[8:23] anything gets in the way from you from
[8:25] missing church or run it out of your
[8:27] life be faithful to the house of God
[8:30] because it could be that one service
[8:33] where the Lord starts opening up things
[8:35] and you're starting to see a greater
[8:37] light you know the Bible says we're
[8:38] supposed to be growing in the grace of
[8:40] our Lord Jesus Christ right and you know
[8:43] even when he was dealing Saint Paul was
[8:45] dealing in Hebrews 5 he was talking
[8:47] he says he said you have need uh you to
[8:51] be taught over again he says but if I
[8:52] teach you you're gonna have to need milk
[8:54] you're going to not meat right and he
[8:56] goes through and just lists the things
[8:57] there in Hebrews 6 about uh the things
[9:00] that uh he considers would be milk right
[9:03] and he goes to those things and if you
[9:05] notice one of them things is faith in
[9:07] God so and I know a lot of uh ministers
[9:11] are preaching on the promises and this
[9:12] and this and that's good but that's not
[9:14] the meat of the word and Paul said we
[9:17] must go on into Perfection see the
[9:19] deeper things that's that's and I know
[9:21] about your pastor but Jesse year goes
[9:23] into the deeper things that's very very
[9:24] important in fact a sister had texted me
[9:27] about a certain thing today this morning
[9:29] on the way here and she says are you
[9:30] guys having one service two service and
[9:32] I said well the second service is for
[9:34] the children and I said these children
[9:36] are Beyond
[9:39] uh Revelation wise and knowledge wise
[9:42] Beyond 99 of the children this message
[9:45] I'll bet the questions and things I've
[9:47] heard the mask and I'm just going
[9:50] and I even go home and just reflect on
[9:52] the way home I'm thinking how did they
[9:53] know it I mean and then I never forget
[9:55] the time I did a Sunday school with
[9:56] Lydia's sister Lydia was there and I was
[9:58] going over something I considered fairly
[9:59] fairly deep and Lydia's like I said does
[10:01] anyone understand this but he's like
[10:04] and I was like there it goes
[10:07] my punch line she took all the Thunder
[10:10] and she just rattled off and this is
[10:13] like it was just something off the top
[10:14] of her head she was thinking of
[10:15] yesterday you know where this morning on
[10:16] the way to church so there's always
[10:18] those who are just
[10:20] up and Beyond
[10:22] by the grace of God and that's how we
[10:24] should be right but we should know the
[10:26] word of God right because because the
[10:28] devil is here and he's going to use what
[10:30] he's going to use what do you use to
[10:31] save Eve this what do you use to deceive
[10:34] uh many times or try to deceive even
[10:37] Christ to use the word of God so we've
[10:39] got to know the word and not only that
[10:41] but we have to have the revelation of
[10:43] the word because the Satan is going to
[10:45] go look in this verse it says this and
[10:47] it'll stop right there or maybe he'll
[10:48] have two verses look right here and look
[10:50] right here but we've got to have the
[10:52] Revelation or the true meaning of what
[10:54] even those verses are saying
[10:56] right and that's where people can get
[10:58] into trouble so
[11:01] uh let's get into this by God's grace I
[11:03] just kind of rattled on there for about
[11:04] eight minutes and uh we won't hold you
[11:06] along but we want to express this to you
[11:08] by the grace of God the thought here and
[11:11] I would have to tie this maybe back to
[11:13] business
[11:15] um
[11:18] let me say it like this when when those
[11:20] are the book of Acts
[11:22] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:26] that first time it set them in motion
[11:33] it set them in Motion in such emotion
[11:36] that like brothers and who have to we
[11:39] have to go work to make a living right I
[11:41] don't know how it was here's the thing
[11:42] here's the questions I don't know what
[11:44] it was like back then 2000 years ago did
[11:47] Peter already have his house paid off
[11:49] did or did they even I mean what how did
[11:51] how did they survive if Peter and them
[11:53] would take time off I mean for months
[11:55] and weeks to follow Christ that their
[11:58] families would still remain intact and
[12:00] fed and the bills were paid how did this
[12:02] all work you know now one thing for
[12:04] surgeon they had Faith to do and one
[12:07] thing and another thing for certain God
[12:09] provided whatever they had
[12:11] but at that time they were they were so
[12:15] caught up after the infilling of the
[12:16] Holy Ghost that they put their lives in
[12:19] second place in fact they the Bible like
[12:21] I was talking to a brother at a
[12:24] he's a he's a he's a little bit older me
[12:26] but he's at a certain Factory I do
[12:28] little uh things for and and he was
[12:30] saying this and that and I said the
[12:32] Bible says we die daily
[12:36] that means we can wake up in the morning
[12:37] and say Lord this is for you this day
[12:39] once again that you have given me we've
[12:41] been given life Saints we've been given
[12:43] an error we've given a breath that we've
[12:46] been given a gift how many seeds have
[12:48] never come forth and yet here we are
[12:50] you were born for a very specific work
[12:53] and you must find your calling you must
[12:56] find exactly what God would have you
[12:57] because each one of you had and I said
[12:59] this a hundred times five right here
[13:00] before you have gifts
[13:03] laying within you
[13:06] right Lord God we must pray and say Lord
[13:09] God bring these things out
[13:13] because remember in the book of Acts
[13:14] when the Holy Ghost fell and they were
[13:16] set that was what the church in motion
[13:19] it was that it became a living church
[13:22] I'll say it like that it was a line for
[13:25] the first time those disciples who
[13:27] followed Christ for three three and a
[13:29] half years however you want to say from
[13:30] John the Baptist to Jesus they were
[13:33] technically not even alive at that time
[13:35] because what they were not born again
[13:37] they were not born of the spirit they
[13:39] were not spiritual creatures or animals
[13:41] however you want to say it and they were
[13:42] not able to produce exactly like Christ
[13:44] did amen sure so what when they they
[13:47] when they uh received the feeling of
[13:50] Holy Ghost there it changed their
[13:52] mindsets
[13:53] but remember they were at the fresh
[13:56] opening of the dispensation there was
[13:59] something new or this was something that
[14:00] has never even been talked about before
[14:02] and they know the Revelation had never
[14:04] been given they read that scripture in
[14:06] Joel they read the scripture here but in
[14:08] the prophesied of that time but they
[14:10] never had an understanding of it
[14:13] so we want to kind of get into this and
[14:15] uh
[14:16] uh in this topic here now as a
[14:19] businessman I I wanted to start a
[14:21] business and I I I do business uh uh in
[14:25] on the side here and there uh I do which
[14:27] is Plumbing we call it and it's not I
[14:29] mean people even think that as business
[14:30] I don't wear shirt and tie but I wear
[14:32] these and uh a little utility belt with
[14:34] all my tools and then I walk in there
[14:36] with the filthy shirt that have stains
[14:38] all over it my pants are stained and
[14:39] last business side yeah that's business
[14:41] [Laughter]
[14:42] not many people like that business
[14:45] but now notice that this quote here says
[14:46] that cycle of Revival and death has
[14:50] never failed
[14:51] all you have to do is recall that last
[14:54] move of God in the spirit when men and
[14:55] men and women dress like Christians went
[14:57] to church prayed all night took the
[14:59] street corners and weren't ashamed of
[15:01] the manifestation of the spirit saints
[15:02] of God we've got to get back to more of
[15:05] this is that or say there's none of this
[15:06] happening it's happening but we need
[15:08] more of this this must consume Our Lives
[15:11] what Jesus saying when he's 12 years old
[15:13] he says I must be about my father's
[15:14] business right but when about the things
[15:17] of God fully consumed and as a like uh
[15:21] like last yes last night when I was
[15:22] trying to study the dogs and and all
[15:24] that I was like Lord I can't even this
[15:26] is I need to get freed up and set aside
[15:29] to do what to get into the word of God
[15:31] and dig and see exactly what God would
[15:33] have me to bring right
[15:35] he says he says what that because that
[15:37] is the business of Christ that is what
[15:39] his that is the whole point of him even
[15:40] coming is what not only to manifest him
[15:43] but what to send his life back into you
[15:44] so that now his bride can go and move
[15:47] into these things now uh in every if you
[15:50] look at the as the prophet God would
[15:51] teach about the first Eve how she fell
[15:55] what was the whole in fact as I listened
[15:57] to Christ the mystery of God revealed
[15:58] yesterday what was the whole point of
[16:00] everything the secret of the entire
[16:02] thing was right at the beginning but
[16:03] he's what the secret will be revealed at
[16:06] the very end it was there at the
[16:07] beginning but it revealed at the end the
[16:09] first Eve fell the second Eve right here
[16:12] as we just read
[16:14] right here this one fell as well right
[16:17] around 50 A.D or however you want to say
[16:19] 53
[16:21] but the whole point was that God was
[16:23] going to produce an eve that would not
[16:25] fail that would not take the Antichrist
[16:28] Spirit right
[16:30] now he says they had dead churches and
[16:32] worshiped in homes in the store
[16:34] buildings they had reality see that was
[16:36] the original that was the church that
[16:37] was alive he says but it wasn't too too
[16:39] long a time when they began to have
[16:41] enough money to build fine new churches
[16:44] they put in a choir instead of singing
[16:47] unto God for themselves they put gowns
[16:48] in the choir they organized the movement
[16:50] and ran it by man and soon they began to
[16:52] read books that were fit for them to
[16:54] read they ran they let down the bars and
[16:56] the goats came in and took over the Cry
[16:58] Of Joy was gone my if we could just get
[17:01] that cry of Joy back into our lives and
[17:05] just say when we get onto the job in the
[17:07] morning everybody's like uh some guy's
[17:09] got their energy drinks you know a job
[17:10] and some got their coughing this and we
[17:12] just go in there and say Lord say
[17:13] Brothers my friends are Romans
[17:15] countrymen
[17:17] let me hear God open your ears
[17:21] hear what I have to say God is coming
[17:24] soon amen and see let them deceiver that

[17:56] it's always that close
[17:58] it's always that close because why you
[18:00] don't know when your last day is amen
[18:02] and that's the true saints of God we
[18:04] think we got tomorrow we got we think
[18:05] we've got a month from now we got plans
[18:07] for next year or this year but since God
[18:09] when is your last day when is our last
[18:11] breath when is our last moment even
[18:13] before the Rapture amen we've always got
[18:16] to be ready
[18:19] 2015 I lost my Apprentice I did not know
[18:22] it that was his last day in fact last
[18:24] night and this morning was the exact
[18:26] same same kind of day it was this fall
[18:29] came in late last night and sat real
[18:31] thick and then I wake up this morning
[18:33] and boom it was just it reminded me
[18:34] exactly of of newbie and how that thing
[18:37] was all set up so
[18:39] he says now notice he says they're
[18:40] crying for the joy of the The Cry Of Joy
[18:43] was gone the freedom of the spirit was
[18:44] gone he says oh they kept on with the
[18:47] form but the fire had died down and the
[18:49] Blackness of Ashes it was all that was
[18:51] left right
[18:52] so now
[18:54] um let's continue on here trying to uh
[18:56] serve to God a service without being his
[18:58] will the will of God God said he says
[19:01] how would he do it today how would he
[19:02] restore all the things that he would do
[19:04] again he promised to restore that's
[19:06] exactly right now think about this
[19:09] after service on Wednesday probably
[19:12] can't preach on a certain subject
[19:14] and I'm sitting there and I'm just going
[19:17] and I'm seeing I'm seeing the picture
[19:18] and I'll say this I've seen the picture
[19:21] but it's getting clearer more clear
[19:24] there's still blurry spots there's quite
[19:26] a bit of blurry here and there's a
[19:27] blurry there and the edges aren't
[19:28] exactly tight or sharp and even some of
[19:31] the inside stuff isn't sharp but the
[19:33] saints of God it's getting clearer and
[19:35] clearer and I told after a service there
[19:37] on the sidewalk we went out because that
[19:38] was the only place where light it was
[19:40] outside
[19:40] [Laughter]
[19:42] was I went out and I said brother I said
[19:44] think about this
[19:46] Jesus in Revelations 1 had all seven
[19:49] stars in his hand and the Bible says
[19:52] that was literally the prophet God
[19:54] brought out he says the when there was
[19:55] light those stars were shining he says
[19:57] that was not their own light
[20:00] they have no light of their own but they
[20:02] were only reflecting the Light of Christ
[20:04] that was holding him he is the pillar of
[20:07] fire when that pillar fire blood I was
[20:09] like this rain he answers light they are
[20:12] able to see it and catch it absolutely
[20:14] just like when Moses was 40 days and 49s
[20:16] with the with the pillar of fire while
[20:18] he came down and the Bible said they put
[20:19] ahead and put a veil over his face why
[20:21] because he's face shown
[20:23] he was reflecting that light and I said
[20:25] now notice he said these Seven Stars
[20:27] were sent to Seven Ages and he said yes
[20:29] Pastor Cam's like yes I said
[20:31] but what did they do when each star
[20:33] comes forth what did it do it did two
[20:36] things
[20:39] each star broke out of a denominational
[20:42] spirit and it was unorganized
[20:47] every one of them was unorganized as the
[20:51] prophet of God said he says there was
[20:52] always a cycle of life and then there
[20:55] was a cycle of death saints of God our
[20:57] Prophet came out unorganized he said I
[20:59] don't belong to idiom he says but I want
[21:01] to include them all he said a Baptist
[21:03] invites me I'll go and preacher him if a
[21:05] Methodist vitamins come preaching him he
[21:06] said the reason I stick with the
[21:08] Pentecostals he says because they
[21:09] support my meetings amen praise be to
[21:11] God it says so does the businessmen they
[21:13] support me he says well I've got to
[21:15] preach for what I'm calling and where
[21:16] I'm open where the doors are open but by
[21:19] the end of his ministry what the doors
[21:20] had been shot and he was only into
[21:21] certain spots and however the saints of
[21:24] God when he when God sent that angel up
[21:26] it was unorganized
[21:30] and if the prophet of God said he said
[21:31] he said that's the cycle of life and
[21:33] death where are we at right now
[21:35] 60 years past
[21:37] 1963 where the seals were revealed right
[21:41] amen so those things are always on my
[21:43] mind now notice he says he says all the
[21:45] all the bugs that hell can turn loose on
[21:48] her will never stop her no communism
[21:50] Catholicism nothing else will stop it I
[21:53] will restore saith the Lord all the
[21:55] man-made Roman trees that will ever hang
[21:58] in there all the graves will ever keep
[22:00] it out he's all the big denominational
[22:01] Stones laying over the door will never
[22:03] keep it there I will restore saith the
[22:05] Lord there will be an Easter I'll bring
[22:08] forth that same church in its same power
[22:10] and bring that bride out just like she
[22:13] was back there with the same signs the
[22:15] same fruit
[22:16] the same fruit was that the fruit of the
[22:19] spirit love kindness Joy meekness
[22:21] Temperance patience Divine brotherly
[22:23] kindness and then what cap it off with
[22:25] what the Holy Ghost
[22:27] charity right he says we need to see
[22:30] more of these if we don't see these in
[22:31] the message then there's something wrong
[22:33] right he says he says I'll bring that
[22:36] bride out just like she was back there
[22:37] with the same signs saying fruit the
[22:39] same thing they did I'll bring her back
[22:42] I will restore saith the Lord restore
[22:44] all the denominationals that eat off
[22:46] restore all the organization Aid off I
[22:48] restore all of it uh saith the Lord amen
[22:51] now
[22:53] this movement this work
[22:55] in Romans 9 verse 26 and this shall come
[22:58] to pass that in that place where it was
[23:00] said to them ye are not my people there
[23:02] shall be called the year not my people
[23:04] that there shall they be called the
[23:06] children of the Living God who knows
[23:08] that's us that's the Gentiles right
[23:09] there we did not know anything about God
[23:12] we uh we have examples of ourselves we
[23:15] have we have uh um uh who's the who's
[23:18] the Harlot um in Joshua's day Rahab she
[23:22] said I've heard of it right he says he
[23:24] says how great your God is what he did
[23:26] to this a nation what he did to this
[23:28] King and what this King and and that
[23:30] Nation however he says and and the
[23:32] messenger said well he says we're coming
[23:34] your way as well and she said what he
[23:36] says I want to serve your God and they
[23:38] said this will be the token what let out
[23:40] that red thread right that Scarlet
[23:41] thread showing what it was the baptism
[23:43] of the Holy Ghost correct the blood of
[23:45] Christ
[23:47] and then what now at that time Rahab
[23:49] married one of the king of the hosts
[23:50] what and she came now into the into that
[23:52] camp right now Isaiah's also cried
[23:55] concerning Israel
[23:57] know the number of the children Israel
[23:58] shall be as the sand of the sea a
[24:00] Remnant shall be saved now notice for he
[24:02] will finish the work and cut it short in
[24:05] righteousness because a short work will
[24:08] the Lord make upon the Earth
[24:11] I mean I mean I don't know about anyone
[24:13] here but I know in my life I see I need
[24:17] more
[24:18] I need to come up higher than I've ever
[24:22] been then I've had then I can even think
[24:24] that I can go
[24:27] what are they doing the Marines they
[24:29] push you beyond what you think you can
[24:31] do I heard of a man uh who was a
[24:33] businessman when he went to a certain
[24:35] marine or however in like an endurance
[24:37] athlete and he was a marine or however
[24:39] maybe sealed or something and and he
[24:41] wanted to do like a training session
[24:43] with him and uh so he meets him and says
[24:45] how you doing how you doing blah blah he
[24:46] says are you ready to get to work and he
[24:47] said absolutely and then the Marine says
[24:49] he says give me 100 push-ups or sorry
[24:51] 100 pull-ups right now and he goes 100
[24:53] and the guy was overweight and this and
[24:55] that an hour and the guy said yeah 200
[24:56] right now
[24:58] you know what he did
[25:00] he didn't stop
[25:01] it might have been one by one but he did
[25:03] a hundred that day
[25:04] [Laughter]
[25:06] why because because I remember when he
[25:08] when that officer he said he said give
[25:10] me a hundred in his mind he's like that
[25:12] number 100 is a huge huge number knowing
[25:14] himself he could probably do maybe five
[25:16] in a row maybe 10 in a row but to do a
[25:19] hundred it didn't matter if you could do
[25:21] in a row you had to do a hundred right
[25:22] amen but God is at a spot right now
[25:25] where he's going to push us beyond what
[25:27] we thought think about this what about
[25:29] all the children of God that gone before
[25:31] you
[25:34] and the Lion's Den
[25:36] in the fiery furnace
[25:38] caves and and dwelling in the wilderness
[25:40] what about those in the Holocaust
[25:43] the Germans I was like the the Jews who
[25:46] made it through there their sacrifices
[25:48] the life they lived or on we can't even
[25:50] imagine what it was like the their loss
[25:53] of their mother their children their
[25:55] this or that however and they still
[25:57] pushed on Saints
[26:02] but God said in this time he says he's
[26:03] going to make a quick short work
[26:06] he's going to gather it all up in one
[26:08] time and what will be out of here by
[26:09] God's grace amen sure now
[26:13] now I've wondered this for a long time
[26:19] I've heard other administers say and
[26:21] even a church age book says we really
[26:22] don't know what took place
[26:24] in the upper room
[26:27] they said they were praying with
[26:28] Suffocation but what was really going on
[26:31] up there what was what was being what
[26:33] was occurring up there in them 10 days
[26:36] 120 men and women met up in an upper
[26:39] room in a building much like this
[26:41] probably or however open I don't know
[26:43] who was separated however but something
[26:45] took place up there that caused the Holy
[26:48] Ghost to come down in such a way
[26:54] and I found a couple quotes on it and
[26:56] now it's clear it gets clearer and
[26:58] clearer what we need to do and what
[27:01] God's going to drive if it's going to be
[27:02] a quick short work he's going to drive
[27:04] us to something
[27:05] I mean think about this the Lord the
[27:08] Lord Jesus was on the Mish he was on a
[27:10] mission for three years
[27:11] and that that that business of his or
[27:14] that Ministry of his caused so much
[27:16] hatred and anger and those sort of
[27:19] things that what it caused himself to be
[27:21] crucified but not only that it put fear
[27:24] in his disciples at the same time and
[27:26] now they were on the run it looked like
[27:28] you know because we were associated with
[27:30] him and and even though he rose again we
[27:33] still didn't have the boldness of The
[27:34] Bravery to continue on
[27:38] so the Lord said he says before he just
[27:40] ascended he said he said go and tarry in
[27:43] Jerusalem right
[27:44] now notice this
[27:46] in the day that thou that when Jesus
[27:49] Christ was crucified sent back he said
[27:51] did you blasphemy you'll be forgiven but
[27:54] when you blast him the Holy Ghost it'll
[27:55] never be forgiven for the people wasn't
[27:57] sealed the work of God wasn't finished
[27:59] yet the sacrifice wasn't made Jesus
[28:01] hadn't been crucified the Holy Ghost had
[28:03] to come but on the day of Pentecost when
[28:06] there came a sound from heaven like a
[28:08] mighty rushing wind and those Jews that
[28:10] had been crying and sighing for the
[28:12] Abomination did in the city
[28:16] what were they doing praying and
[28:18] supplication yeah not just that but they
[28:20] were sighing and crying
[28:24] Imagine This you're a fisherman
[28:27] your father was a fisherman your father
[28:29] was a fisherman and you could trace your
[28:31] lineage all the way back to Abraham all
[28:32] the way back to this tribe or that tribe
[28:34] or that great General this this and
[28:36] you're a Jew and you're in Israel right
[28:38] now and now you're ruled by Romans
[28:41] you're under Roman rule here we are
[28:46] oh my and then what all of a sudden a
[28:48] man who comes out and says follow me and
[28:50] something inside of you pulls you to
[28:53] follow him
[28:55] did they even know what they were doing
[28:57] they had no clue just something inside
[29:02] they heard a voice an audible voice of a
[29:05] man that said come follow me and they
[29:07] dropped their Nets the Bible said
[29:11] and looked at this man
[29:13] and started following him
[29:17] I couldn't even imagine that
[29:20] I'm a plumber
[29:21] I've got a job to do I got Prince I got
[29:23] markers and I highlight this and I
[29:25] highlight that and I said I gotta make
[29:26] cart runs and I gotta make part lists
[29:28] and I gotta do this I gotta worry about
[29:30] Manpower and this and that and how would
[29:31] this and I got a schedule with everybody
[29:32] this this what if someone said come
[29:34] follow me and I'm like and I'm soldering
[29:36] in this pipe or welding this pipe like
[29:37] this or however and I hear her come
[29:39] follow me
[29:41] do I leave the welder running
[29:45] take off my weld helmet put it down
[29:49] take my weld jacket off
[29:52] and follow this guy leave my work truck
[29:55] [Music]
[29:58] the foremans are going uh the other
[29:59] superintendents are like where are you
[30:00] going it's I am like
[30:02] he said to follow him
[30:05] they're like what are you doing we've
[30:07] got we've got timetables
[30:11] don't you know on Monday this is going
[30:13] to arrive and you've got to put pipe
[30:14] this up so we can get heated here come
[30:16] on Psy but he said follow me
[30:19] saints of God think about your lives
[30:22] what if someone said come follow me oh
[30:25] my
[30:29] it'll happen one day
[30:31] very very soon
[30:33] because what was the rapture
[30:34] come up hither
[30:38] there is a voice going to Spring down
[30:40] from heaven it's going to usher and echo
[30:42] down from heavens and come follow me
[30:44] come up hither
[30:49] now notice here we read over in the book
[30:52] that it was said the angel went forth
[30:54] and put a mark on those whose side and
[30:55] cried for the Abomination was done in
[30:57] the city and realizing by the scripture
[30:59] now notice we would have never known
[31:01] this was that except by Malachi 4. and
[31:06] realizing realizing by the scriptures
[31:08] that that was the first coming of the
[31:10] Holy Spirit through the city of
[31:12] Jerusalem he says and when he had his
[31:14] second return in this age to call people
[31:15] out of the Gentiles for his name how
[31:17] much more should we be concerned and
[31:19] sighing and crying for the Abominations
[31:21] as did saints of God think about it
[31:23] these guys heard the voice of God they
[31:26] followed Jesus for three and a half
[31:28] years they had they were out of high
[31:29] school
[31:30] they had friends in high school maybe
[31:32] even while they were fishermen but they
[31:34] didn't go to college but they were there
[31:35] was a tax collector he might went to
[31:37] college however and they had friends all
[31:39] in Israel they grew up it was probably a
[31:41] very friendly area
[31:43] and they had to forsake everyone
[31:47] maybe some of their friends were the
[31:49] ones saying crucify him crucify him
[31:53] I got friends right now in high school I
[31:56] witnessed back to the baptism to them
[31:58] and they just
[32:00] reject it and I'm thinking and these
[32:02] were good friends they were good to me
[32:05] and I was good to them we had a lot of
[32:06] fun we had a lot of Fellowship we had we
[32:09] did we ran around together and did fun
[32:11] stuff
[32:12] and then to see
[32:14] them reject the baptism the very baptism
[32:16] of God revealed to me and has changed my
[32:19] life
[32:22] our heart should be breaking our hearts
[32:25] should be crying out for their souls
[32:27] that God would crying out for what an
[32:29] opening of their eyes
[32:31] an opening just like the Bible talks
[32:33] about Lydia a seller of P purple and how
[32:35] God had to open up her heart to see the
[32:38] gospel amen
[32:41] he says and then in the second coming
[32:43] return He says how much more should we
[32:44] be concerned in sign crying for the
[32:46] Abominations did he says we see churches
[32:48] practicing rock and roll playing bingo
[32:50] all kinds of things swimming contests
[32:53] and so forth where prayer meetings and
[32:55] all night tearing meetings is forgotten
[32:58] yo brother I'm talking about all night
[32:59] prayer meetings like many many times
[33:02] [Laughter]
[33:04] I'll be I'm gonna I haven't done one
[33:07] since we had like a lock-in in like
[33:09] 2013 or 2012. and all night prayer
[33:13] meeting
[33:14] we haven't done that in over 11 years
[33:18] and yet we're at the darkest age we see
[33:20] our Humanity completely falling apart
[33:23] it's riding in its core the mentality
[33:27] the ability to think
[33:29] with good reasoning is gone it's gone
[33:32] you are you are the minority
[33:34] for you to be able to think straight and
[33:37] have be able to see these things
[33:39] you are the Bible says a special chosen
[33:43] people A peculiar people oh the only
[33:46] ones on the faith you're face of the
[33:48] Earth that can actually think straight
[33:49] and they come up with good logical
[33:51] reasoning
[33:53] I'm not talking about the guys out there
[33:55] the big names that these are all
[33:56] Catholic guys fighting against uh who is
[33:58] a woman this that no their cat they're
[34:00] blinds too
[34:02] I'm talking about spiritually everything
[34:05] amen now God sent us back to the real
[34:08] thing let the Holy Ghost come on among
[34:11] these people tonight Lord he says and
[34:13] star a Pentecost right here Grand Lord
[34:15] in every heart truly that one it's their
[34:18] hearts to do it but the cares of the
[34:20] world and the swiftness of the passing
[34:23] of time has just moved them out
[34:28] Lydia you're 18 years old
[34:32] Emma's going to be 20 in a couple months
[34:37] this month I hit 46.
[34:40] this thing is moving at such a pace and
[34:44] I'm thinking if I see 70 that's only
[34:46] literally less than
[34:48] 24 years
[34:49] 20 wait it's 24 years I'll be 70.
[34:55] that's not a lot of time
[35:00] you young people
[35:01] it's it's coming
[35:03] you this thing moves so fast every
[35:07] decision is so important
[35:10] obey your mothers and fathers because
[35:13] they are watching over you to to make
[35:15] good decisions for you while you are
[35:17] under their headship
[35:20] be obedient to them
[35:22] they love you
[35:24] they are trying to watch out for you
[35:31] don't give this world one second thought
[35:34] about any of it
[35:36] there is no joy out there there is no
[35:39] happiness out there there is no real
[35:42] friendship I'll say like that out there
[35:45] there is no truth out there
[35:48] and that's what we love the Bible says
[35:51] we love the truth amen praise be to God
[35:53] what and that's why he chose us because
[35:55] what we love the truth and for
[35:57] sanctification of the spirit
[35:59] there's nothing out there
[36:01] our goal our vision should be what
[36:03] perhaps sure
[36:07] but the cares of the world and the
[36:09] swiftness of the passing time has just
[36:10] wooed them out Lord start from this
[36:13] Pulpit from me to go to the audience and
[36:15] move over like before and give us that
[36:16] 04
[36:17] lost souls to make more money to grow a
[36:21] business to be better pipefitter to to
[36:23] make a collection of this or a
[36:25] collection of that or or to do this
[36:26] hobby or what no
[36:28] what did the prophet say let us win
[36:31] souls
[36:34] win
[36:35] Souls
[36:37] was last week brother Austin invited
[36:39] somebody he didn't make it but he
[36:40] invited somebody he was caring for their
[36:43] souls wanting to hear the good word of
[36:46] God that we've all heard to partake in
[36:49] this Fellowship to meet the Saints of
[36:50] like and precious Faith amen yes sure
[36:53] caring about lost souls he says he says
[36:56] now this one with the ink horn on his
[36:58] side was the Holy Spirit now notice
[37:01] after that he went through he went and
[37:02] turned to those he turned those men
[37:04] loose with the slaughter slaughtering
[37:06] weapons he said utterly destroy destroy
[37:09] all both young and old young Maids
[37:11] little children's spare nothing he says
[37:13] and don't come near any of those who
[37:15] have the Seal of God on them see things
[37:16] of God when you receive the baptism of
[37:18] the Holy Ghost that is your safety
[37:23] he's not necessarily talking about this
[37:24] he's talking about your soul you can
[37:27] never ever be lost
[37:30] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[37:32] Ghost you are sealed until the day of
[37:34] your Redemption
[37:36] you could have confidence you can have
[37:39] faith you can have hope in those things
[37:41] amen absolutely he says now what did it
[37:44] now when now when did that take place
[37:46] that was the early Pentecostal church
[37:49] when the Holy Spirit went through and
[37:50] marked out
[37:51] Church
[37:53] and notice when this and I'll say like
[37:56] this if that was the shadow
[37:58] if the Old Testament is a shadow and the
[38:00] New Testament is the real and then now
[38:02] where two thousand years passed the old
[38:04] the New Testament is now our shadow of
[38:05] what the Bible said what these are
[38:07] examples to us
[38:09] not just not just Moses not just Joseph
[38:12] and and all them around there but now
[38:14] Paul Peter
[38:16] James and John those are examples for us
[38:20] and what they wrote the Holy Ghost has
[38:22] ordained for us
[38:24] Amen to learn from to read to gain
[38:27] knowledge and wisdom sure
[38:30] now let's continue on here
[38:33] so as I I'd already taught on that a
[38:35] while back
[38:38] because when I read that I said
[38:41] I said
[38:42] unbelievable
[38:46] Ezekiel 9 is the Pentecostal movement oh
[38:49] well here's what I was going to get to
[38:50] when that Pentecostal move did it just
[38:53] save 144 120 people
[38:56] because directly that same day the Bible
[38:59] said three thousand were baptized with
[39:01] the Holy Ghost
[39:04] but notice it had to start with a small
[39:06] group first to bring forth the abundance
[39:10] see I'm telling you there's something
[39:12] coming
[39:13] it'll be just the last ones will be
[39:15] saved
[39:18] but there's got to be a solid core group
[39:20] to get this started there's got to be
[39:22] someone that there's got to be that the
[39:25] elected will do it
[39:27] I'll just say like that it's gonna it's
[39:29] gonna happen Jesus said what I will
[39:31] restore it's going to happen
[39:34] now so as I thought about this and I
[39:35] thought about Ezekiel 9's Pentecost and
[39:37] this that I thought
[39:40] well what about Ezekiel Ezekiel it's the
[39:43] same that was before this
[39:47] so no notice says brother cam was
[39:49] working Wednesday
[39:52] where the cam was working on Wednesday
[39:53] with Samson
[39:56] and brother Cam said he heard many
[39:57] ministers type those Seven Locks that he
[39:59] had
[40:00] with the seven Church ages so he went
[40:03] and studied it and this and that and
[40:04] brother man never said there were seven
[40:05] Church ages
[40:08] so what do they mean
[40:10] could they
[40:12] be the seven Thunders
[40:15] because it was on his head it was a
[40:16] covenant it was a it was a Nazarite vow
[40:19] separated to the Lord only those
[40:22] separated the Lord could that hair grow
[40:23] and that hair represented the Covenant
[40:26] of a wife right
[40:30] but now notice here here we find another
[40:31] prophet
[40:34] that God touched now notice in verse 3
[40:37] and he put forth the form of a hand and
[40:40] took me by the lock of mine
[40:43] head
[40:44] something about this Covenant hair
[40:46] sisters you have you have no idea well
[40:49] you do you know exactly what your
[40:51] Covenant with your hair is a very
[40:53] special thing he and God used that same
[40:56] long hair that same Covenant with Samson
[40:58] and now we see it now even used here
[41:00] with Ezekiel and it was when that and
[41:03] now notice God came and took that one
[41:05] lock not seven just one God only needed
[41:09] him to grow one lock he only had one
[41:10] lock as far as God grabbed and with that
[41:13] one lock he was able to be elevated and
[41:16] gain a revelation of what was going on
[41:18] in the Church of God
[41:23] and what did God show him with that one
[41:25] hair of Locke he lifted him up by that
[41:29] Nazarite vow or however you want to say
[41:31] it by that Covenant by that
[41:33] representation on his head that what God
[41:36] is Christ and Christ is God
[41:39] Jesus is uh is Jehovah
[41:42] of the new correct now notice
[41:46] and what the first things he saw and I
[41:48] remember if you think about this
[41:51] because my mind had to place it because
[41:52] now I've already taught this in the New
[41:53] Testament what this in the New Testament
[41:55] is because the prophet said what these
[41:56] are
[41:57] or revealed some of them
[42:00] but what was it back then if Ezekiel 9
[42:03] was the Pentecost of the 104 120 were
[42:06] sealed with the Holy Ghost and this was
[42:08] beforehand
[42:10] what was
[42:11] the other ones now notice
[42:14] furthermore no then he said unto me son
[42:16] of man lift up thine eyes now way the
[42:19] way toward the north so I lifted up my
[42:21] eyes toward the North and behold
[42:22] northward at the Gate of the altar this
[42:25] image of jealousy in the entrance so the
[42:28] first thing revealed by God grabbing
[42:31] this lock up and giving him a revelation
[42:33] was this image of jealousy now
[42:35] this is my opinion but I believe in this
[42:36] age is brother Branham
[42:41] when someone says uh if you don't say
[42:43] brother Graham 20 times I'm not
[42:44] listening to sermon
[42:46] okay that's a problem
[42:48] somebody's lifted up somebody a little
[42:49] too much when what there's only one name
[42:52] under heaven whereby we might be saved
[42:55] amen and that is the lovely name of the
[42:57] Lord Jesus Christ amen he is what
[42:59] there's salvation is not in William
[43:01] brand of Salvation is in what Jesus
[43:03] Christ Jehovah Our Savior amen
[43:08] but what would it be back then 2000
[43:10] years ago before Pentecost
[43:15] what would be the image of jealousy back
[43:16] then
[43:18] notice in John 5 and 43 I come in my
[43:21] father's name and he will receive him
[43:23] uh receive me not if another come in his
[43:25] own name him will you receive how can
[43:28] you believe which receive honor one of
[43:31] another and seek ye not the honor that
[43:33] Cometh From the uh God the only
[43:35] do not think that I will cause accuse
[43:38] you of the father there is one that
[43:40] accuses you even Moses in whom he trusts
[43:45] the people that Christ encountered in
[43:48] the religious realm in Jerusalem could
[43:50] not get away they would not let go of
[43:52] Moses
[43:53] and move on to God
[43:59] four of ye would believe Moses you would
[44:01] have believed me for he wrote of me he
[44:04] was giving them all the plain Clues they
[44:06] needed said why don't you read the Bible
[44:08] why don't you read the law why don't you
[44:09] read about the the the Lambs and the
[44:12] Bulldogs and the goats now he said that
[44:13] represented me amen then that what about
[44:16] the sacrifice of the blood on the Altar
[44:18] and those sort of things he said that
[44:18] was represented me
[44:20] everything representative
[44:22] he says for if you believe not his
[44:24] writings how shall he believe my words
[44:28] I'll say like this
[44:30] do they believe it's brother Brandon
[44:32] what he preached
[44:34] if they're doing such and such here and
[44:35] doing such and such here leaving some
[44:37] quotes out and emphasizing they'll make
[44:40] a Doctrine off one quote when there's 30
[44:42] or 40 more saying the opposite
[44:46] do they really believe what Moses said
[44:50] come on
[44:51] now notice he says then again they
[44:54] called they they called the the man that
[44:56] was blind and said to him God give God
[44:58] the praise we know that this man is a
[45:00] sinner really and the answer said
[45:03] whether he be as a sinner iron or not he
[45:05] says or no he says I know not one thing
[45:07] I know is that where I was blind now I
[45:09] see
[45:10] then they said unto him again what did
[45:13] he
[45:14] what did he do to thee
[45:16] oh wait what did he to thee
[45:19] how did he open Thine Eyes saints of God
[45:21] I've heard this would my cousin Adam's
[45:24] testimony
[45:26] you tell him you tell him
[45:29] he was meeting with a he was going to a
[45:30] certain church with his wife
[45:32] cousin Adam you went cousin Adam
[45:34] he just got delivered from drugs from 20
[45:37] 18 to 20 years I mean hardcore just
[45:41] gone right just
[45:43] only the hand of God dream
[45:45] and he went and gave his testimony
[45:47] before the pastor and his wife and he
[45:49] said I was at a certain place at the
[45:51] rehab place he said they had three
[45:53] sermons a day preaching this and this he
[45:55] says and I was down to the Altar and a
[45:56] brother started praying over me he said
[45:58] and I felt a fire come in he says and
[46:00] just devoured everything
[46:02] so he's telling the testimony to the
[46:03] pastor and the pastor's wife said what
[46:05] said what'd she say she said she said
[46:08] but how did you how did you feed drugs
[46:11] and Adam looked like his wife and said
[46:13] or look at the wife goes like this and
[46:15] no I just told you he says God the fire
[46:17] of God came in and she goes no no what
[46:20] did what did you do to overcome this
[46:23] and Adam said he said it like three or
[46:25] four times
[46:26] and finally to Jody and said we gotta go
[46:30] so Pastor of a mega church so carnal was
[46:34] the wife she must have never ever had
[46:38] one experience of the supernatural
[46:42] if you don't understand the Supernatural
[46:44] and how God can come down and do
[46:47] something she must have never been she
[46:48] must have been in a worship service and
[46:50] never even felt the presence of God
[46:53] to not understand that that God can come
[46:56] in you and burn something out or do I
[46:58] mean
[47:00] I was blown away he just looked at me
[47:02] said sorry he goes she just did not get
[47:05] it
[47:07] she passed on already
[47:10] but now notice what they said he says
[47:12] the answer and says I've told you
[47:13] already Adam's like I told you already
[47:17] he says but you were not here why
[47:20] because God had already shut up her ears
[47:22] oh my goodness
[47:24] hopefully the Lord did something before
[47:26] she passed wherefore when you hear it
[47:28] again will you also be his disciples now
[47:30] notice what was the problem in Christ's
[47:33] day he said they said they reviled him
[47:35] and said Thou Art his disciple but we
[47:37] are Moses's disciple
[47:41] Christ knowing all things Discerning all
[47:44] things
[47:45] he knew what they said the very God that
[47:47] Moses served was the one right before
[47:50] him he was the one that healed him
[47:52] and now they're saying we don't know who
[47:54] this guy is but we know who Moses was
[47:57] we know that God spake unto Moses but
[48:00] for this fellow we not know from whence
[48:01] he is Moses didn't heal anybody as far
[48:04] as I know
[48:05] that Moses say bring forth a hand to
[48:07] never Moses Ever Raised the Dead
[48:10] no he's doing greater things in this in
[48:14] this thing not in nature even he did
[48:16] nature stuff too but in this thing Moses
[48:18] didn't do anything
[48:21] ah
[48:23] there's our image of jealousy
[48:26] now notice the second thing they saw so
[48:29] I went and saw him behold every form of
[48:31] creeping beasts and abominable beasts
[48:32] and all the idols of the house Israel
[48:33] portrayed round about the wall and there
[48:35] stood before him 70 men of the Ancients
[48:37] of Israel of the House of Israel in the
[48:39] midst of them through the jazzaniah the
[48:41] son of chiffon which every man his
[48:45] sensor in his hand and thick clouds of
[48:46] incense went up this is the first this
[48:47] would be the second or the deed or the
[48:49] doctrine of the Nicolaitans and of
[48:51] course we have the first groups of men
[48:52] who are the groups of men back then the
[48:54] scribes lawyers Sadducees Pharisees and
[48:57] zealots
[48:59] everything that we know these things
[49:00] represent this day it was back then as
[49:03] well
[49:05] now he's going into the second room
[49:07] there or the uh the room that he sees
[49:09] things
[49:09] and the Lord said unto him and he said
[49:11] unto him turn thee yet again and thou
[49:13] shalt see greater Abominations that they
[49:16] do then he brought me to a door of the
[49:19] gate in the Lord's House which was
[49:20] towards the North and behold there are
[49:22] sat women weeping for tammuz
[49:28] now remember they were in Rome they were
[49:29] under Roman control even though it was
[49:31] Jerusalem but remember this was a
[49:33] prophecy the word of God every word of
[49:36] God is a prophecy
[49:38] think about everything Adam said think
[49:40] about everything Adam did what Eve did
[49:42] everything was if this is if this is
[49:45] recorded as the word of God in such a
[49:48] way then it has a prophecy to it
[49:50] everything is a prophecy that's why
[49:53] that's why Paul can pull in in in
[49:55] Ezekiel or sorry in Ephesians 5. he says
[49:58] uh he says he says what God said he says
[50:00] she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My
[50:02] Flesh he pulled that from Adam
[50:04] Paul pulled that from Adam what it was a
[50:06] prophesy prophecy not just of Eve but
[50:09] what of the Bride of Jesus Christ sure
[50:13] and since they were in Rome
[50:15] and at that time God was revealing to
[50:18] them things were taking place in
[50:19] Jerusalem had nothing it must have been
[50:21] something to do with saturnalia
[50:24] absolutely that's a Roman Feast the
[50:26] Roman Pagan feast
[50:27] completely I guarantee you the influence
[50:31] the influences of Roman society of that
[50:35] Roman Spirit would touch I'll say like
[50:37] this
[50:38] what was the difference between
[50:41] the Jewish Spirit at that time and the
[50:43] Roman spirit
[50:45] not much difference one looked religious
[50:47] one was not did not look religious even
[50:51] though it was but they both Rome
[50:55] and Israel wanted Christ dead
[50:57] and they had it done
[50:59] on shows they were under what the Same
[51:01] Spirit now
[51:02] of course we see the very last thing
[51:05] Sun worshipers
[51:09] we can't prove anything
[51:13] then he said to him he has thou seen
[51:14] this oh son of man yet turn thee again
[51:16] yet again and thou shalt see greater
[51:18] Abominations of these and he brought me
[51:20] forth in the inner core of the Lord's
[51:22] house now notice this is the Jews right
[51:24] in the Lord's House and behold at the
[51:25] porch the door of the porch of the Lord
[51:27] between the porch and the altar were
[51:29] about Five and Twenty men and their
[51:32] backs were toward the Temple of the Lord
[51:33] and their faces toward the East and they
[51:35] worshiped the sun towards the east Sun
[51:38] worshipers
[51:40] within our day the Roman Catholic Church
[51:42] they worship the Sun so what was it
[51:43] going back there they were there had to
[51:45] be some kind of priesthood there had to
[51:47] be some within that priesthood who were
[51:48] worshiping the son who what pulled from
[51:50] Rome
[51:52] absolutely
[51:54] now can we prove it no but I'm just
[51:56] teaching it as a shadow and type of
[51:58] exactly what took place in Ezekiel 9.
[52:00] now
[52:01] Pagan Rome sure now
[52:05] our business
[52:08] the fruit of the righteous is a tree of
[52:11] life and he that went as Souls
[52:14] is wise
[52:17] when we first started our assembly after
[52:18] Bill Jesse
[52:21] gave us this blessing and said start one
[52:23] here in Napoleon Ohio
[52:25] we went out with Zeal it went
[52:27] door-to-door
[52:28] knocking on doors and this and that
[52:31] we had very little success
[52:34] why because we're in the days of Noah
[52:37] we're in the days a lot
[52:40] the best way we're going to win Seoul
[52:42] right now is to pray and fast and ask
[52:45] the Lord Jesus Christ to lead us and
[52:47] guide us to these lost sheep
[52:50] they don't remember they're they look
[52:52] like goats but they're sheep
[52:55] they look like goats but they're sheep
[52:58] that was one
[53:02] we were one but what I had to take off
[53:05] my my goat clothing to reveal oh I got
[53:07] my own wool
[53:10] that's all right yeah right on you're
[53:13] slower where's the pasture right amen
[53:18] the fruit of the righteous is a tree of
[53:20] life and he that went as Souls is wise
[53:23] saints of God let this mind be in you
[53:29] I'm just starting a new job as far as uh
[53:31] yesterday we're four hours got rained
[53:33] out but I start that new job with two
[53:34] other guys tomorrow
[53:37] and I'm going to be trying to sow more
[53:39] seeds than I ever have
[53:41] I had a
[53:42] I had a dream about a year ago that I
[53:45] sent something on
[53:46] the certain texting site and they were
[53:50] not happy with me so
[53:53] um
[53:55] I gotta start laying down stuff
[53:58] I have to get more serious about the
[54:00] Lord's business
[54:02] people are dying every day
[54:04] you witnessed to him nothing you witness
[54:07] and Lord God where are these Seed where
[54:09] are the where are your people
[54:11] we want to know
[54:13] now notice a crown given to the winner
[54:15] of the Olympic race was a Garland of
[54:17] olive branches
[54:19] but the crown spoken of here in the
[54:22] Revelation was given given to a martyr
[54:25] is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it
[54:27] the Crown of Life The One Crown is for
[54:29] those that have been that have striven
[54:31] the one the other is for those that have
[54:33] given both crowns are Incorruptible they
[54:35] will not perish the winners of the
[54:37] worldly race of life will soon lose the
[54:39] joy of their plots of the world their
[54:41] Glory will fail
[54:43] for those who give their lives to God
[54:45] either by daily striving or shedding
[54:49] their blood as the crowning sacrifice of
[54:51] their lives will be given a Crown of
[54:52] Life see what are we doing right now
[54:54] we're striving to what stay clean and
[54:57] this is this is this is lamp trimming
[55:00] time I'll say like this is the time
[55:02] where if we have if there's an age where
[55:04] you have to stay clean it's this age
[55:06] rubbing shoulders with brother awesome
[55:08] was telling me there's the other day
[55:10] about how rough it is to work and the
[55:12] things the personalities and it is a
[55:15] battle
[55:17] to have the right response someone says
[55:20] this and you're like
[55:22] you do that like bird neck like
[55:24] you know like oh yeah
[55:28] no no no here's how we gotta be

[56:08] and I said I said and I and I I I'll say
[56:11] this I I probably should have acted a
[56:12] little bit different
[56:13] I should have went and said sister
[56:17] would you like some Bible studies on
[56:18] there
[56:19] I said are you a Christian she said yeah
[56:20] I says when it came down to it I said
[56:23] you better pray on this
[56:25] and she was yelling at me you know
[56:27] because you know brother Brooks was
[56:28] watching
[56:31] and I said you had better prey on what
[56:34] you're doing because it's the God that I
[56:36] have is telling me this is wrong
[56:38] but for some reason whatever you're
[56:39] serving is telling you it's right I said
[56:41] you better pray on it
[56:46] you can tell them you can tell them
[56:48] but Lord what what will they do
[56:51] everyone has a choice now
[56:53] he says
[56:55] all too little time
[56:57] is spent on laboring for the Eternal
[57:00] rewards of God
[57:02] the recompense of God is too lightly
[57:05] esteemed
[57:07] if we believe in the reality of the
[57:09] resurrection of the body and in Eternal
[57:11] Kingdom of substance then we ought to
[57:14] lay up our in heaven those good
[57:16] Treasures which are available to this
[57:18] faithful Saints
[57:26] I've been trying to give more I've been
[57:28] trying to witness more
[57:29] and I'm just like saying Lord God what
[57:31] do you what do you want me to do what is
[57:34] what is a clear path for me Lord open up
[57:37] or brighten that light and shoot it on
[57:40] the path you want me to take you know
[57:43] Lord what would you have me to do now
[57:45] notice here I want to throw this in
[57:48] this was the first now notice what it
[57:50] says right here
[57:51] laboring for the Lord doing the things
[57:53] of God but remember that quote before I
[57:55] said how time has rudest silent and
[57:58] wooed us to sleep and and done those
[58:00] sort of things
[58:02] here right here
[58:04] is a powerful this is the first Parable
[58:06] ever given
[58:07] as far as in Matthew 13.
[58:09] and it goes through the the seed the
[58:11] sower the four kinds of grounds right
[58:16] but now notice I want to concentrate on
[58:17] the the last two grounds here in Luke 4
[58:21] 14 8 and 14 and that which fell among
[58:24] the Thorns are they which have heard
[58:27] they which heard have we all heard
[58:29] absolutely go forth and are choked with
[58:33] cares
[58:34] and riches and pleasures of this life
[58:37] and bring no fruit to Perfection saints
[58:40] of God this is not our goal they heard
[58:42] it they accepted it but something was
[58:45] kept pulling their life away from them
[58:47] pulling their energy their focus all
[58:49] that away from them so they would not be
[58:51] able to produce Christ like they wanted
[58:52] to
[58:54] but that on the good ground are they
[58:57] which in an honest and good heart have
[59:00] heard the word keep it and bring forth
[59:02] fruit
[59:04] with patience
[59:07] even though this is a parable Jesus
[59:09] explained it
[59:11] he explained this so literally there's
[59:13] no excuse God have mercy on me
[59:16] but now notice what Jesus said this is a
[59:19] key parable
[59:20] did you know this was the key parable
[59:23] it's given first for a reason
[59:28] Pastor cam hit this and it just blew my
[59:30] mind
[59:31] and when he was alone
[59:33] they that were about him were about 12
[59:35] asked him the parable and he said to him
[59:37] unto you it is given to know the mystery
[59:39] the kingdom of God but unto them that
[59:40] are without all these things are done in
[59:42] Parables that seeing they may see and
[59:44] not perceive and hearing they may hear
[59:46] and yet not understand less anytime they
[59:49] should be converted their sins could be
[59:50] given him and he said what did Jesus say
[59:52] know ye not this parable
[59:54] and how shall ye know all parables
[1:00:00] when he read that to me I said
[1:00:05] teach serpent seed I understand it
[1:00:08] but this first Parable is so important
[1:00:12] that I don't let anything of the world
[1:00:14] creep in not bad things I'm talking
[1:00:16] cares and the riches or however you want
[1:00:19] to say it or a nice car or I need this
[1:00:22] or I desire to have more of this or
[1:00:24] bigger how none of that that's got to go
[1:00:25] all this has to go to bring forth
[1:00:28] greater fruits
[1:00:33] it's time for me
[1:00:36] to let my eyes off of the cares of these
[1:00:39] things
[1:00:42] I don't know what it's like being a
[1:00:43] mother
[1:00:45] outside that I'm a plumber
[1:00:48] because every day every night them
[1:00:50] children want that Mama to do this they
[1:00:52] want that Mama do that Lydia's little
[1:00:54] mom too helping out or not mamas but
[1:00:57] they're not children but her sister
[1:00:59] Brothers
[1:01:00] but as a plumber I get a call from this
[1:01:03] brother
[1:01:04] I get a call from this person right I do
[1:01:06] my eight hours I do my 10 hours
[1:01:10] but then after that I gotta go home load
[1:01:12] up my truck and I take off I don't get a
[1:01:14] moment's break
[1:01:15] because this one has this and this one
[1:01:17] has this and the saints of God I have to
[1:01:19] crucify that
[1:01:20] I have to learn a little little word
[1:01:24] two-lettered word no right
[1:01:27] and it's really getting at first it's
[1:01:29] like I've seen it come for the last 10
[1:01:30] 15 years no no no no I have to put I
[1:01:33] have to do it now I feel such a pressure
[1:01:35] to do this I have to say no
[1:01:38] you know what I want to do you know what
[1:01:39] my heart's desire is I'll just be honest
[1:01:41] you know what my heart's desire is
[1:01:42] I want to go home
[1:01:44] I want to read the Bible and pray that's
[1:01:46] all I want to do
[1:01:49] because I see this thing coming closely
[1:01:51] we have to concentrate what is a
[1:01:52] Nazareth about it's a separating
[1:01:55] from all the things unnecessary do only
[1:01:59] that which is essential for to living
[1:02:03] if you have a better opportunity to do
[1:02:05] this or better after you do this and
[1:02:06] it's going to take more away from God
[1:02:09] do not do it
[1:02:13] sometimes I I'm not a pastor but I enemy
[1:02:15] pastors because they well a lot of them
[1:02:17] here in America they don't have to work
[1:02:18] a job they get to wake up study and pray
[1:02:21] study and pray study and pray and I'm
[1:02:22] like man that would be nice
[1:02:26] and then I see Brothers like brother
[1:02:28] Jazz who writes book and studies in
[1:02:29] praise and writes books and four sermons
[1:02:31] and
[1:02:33] Lord God help me
[1:02:36] amen now
[1:02:39] let's continue on here he says but being
[1:02:41] that is given a hundred and something uh
[1:02:44] here the prophet talking about this uh
[1:02:47] somebody gave him a hundred and
[1:02:49] hundred and something 17 or something uh
[1:02:52] the brother told me thank you my
[1:02:54] precious son so many are friends he said
[1:02:55] somebody gave him some money he says I
[1:02:57] will take that straight to the mission
[1:02:58] field to feed some hungry children to
[1:03:00] say children who believe only the
[1:03:02] message
[1:03:03] did you say children who are the
[1:03:05] children of message believers
[1:03:08] saints of God
[1:03:10] anytime you see anyone in need
[1:03:12] whether they agree with you or not if
[1:03:14] you see a Catholic Who's down and out if
[1:03:16] you see a Baptist Who's down and out
[1:03:18] help them
[1:03:20] they are a living their soul is worth
[1:03:22] ten thousand worlds
[1:03:26] because remember I was a Pentecostal I
[1:03:28] was Assemblies of God at one time
[1:03:31] and my mom started out my dad was
[1:03:33] Catholic
[1:03:35] there are seed of God out there
[1:03:40] people all over the world need things
[1:03:42] they desire they need help
[1:03:44] I just had a sister text me from
[1:03:47] Thailand she's
[1:03:49] she's African
[1:03:51] and her husband and her were over there
[1:03:53] they were doing whatever they just lived
[1:03:55] over there and her husband went back to
[1:03:57] Africa to do something and he died and
[1:03:59] now she's stuck in Thailand
[1:04:02] she just lost her job and she's texting
[1:04:03] me brother Simon can you help me
[1:04:05] what do you do does she believe the
[1:04:07] message of the hour no you
[1:04:09] pre-trinitarian probably
[1:04:11] wouldn't we help her yeah we gotta help
[1:04:13] her
[1:04:14] she's a living soul
[1:04:18] he says do everything that I can to make
[1:04:21] it count
[1:04:22] the prophet God saw Every Soul as an
[1:04:24] opportunity
[1:04:26] now weather now notice he's not even
[1:04:27] talking about bringing him the word of
[1:04:28] God he's just saying if they need a meal
[1:04:30] give it to them
[1:04:32] the simple things like that
[1:04:34] at that day when rewards are given out
[1:04:38] you'll see where it went
[1:04:43] God ever bless you that's a portion of
[1:04:46] your living that we want that we share
[1:04:49] with others and right now we're still
[1:04:52] blessed enough to have remember your
[1:04:54] dollar here can go way bigger over there
[1:04:57] in all these other countries it's almost
[1:04:59] like maybe
[1:05:00] Great Britain or however
[1:05:01] like these what they call third world
[1:05:04] countries your dollar can go Way Beyond
[1:05:08] some of them can live off 100 a month
[1:05:09] from U.S
[1:05:12] you can make a major difference for
[1:05:13] people and also it would cost us is
[1:05:15] fifty dollars I mean if whatever ask God
[1:05:18] to lead you and guide you where to help
[1:05:21] people
[1:05:22] still were up riches in heaven now
[1:05:26] notice charged in them that are rich in
[1:05:28] the in this world that they'd be not
[1:05:30] high-minded
[1:05:32] leave the message
[1:05:33] I'm not going to help this poor person
[1:05:34] the things of God God have mercy bless
[1:05:37] you Jesus bless you he says nor trust in
[1:05:39] uncertain riches but in the Living God
[1:05:42] who giveth us richly all things to enjoy
[1:05:45] that they do good that they be rich in
[1:05:49] good work so am I he says ready to
[1:05:52] distribute
[1:05:54] well the boss just gave me 100 bucks you
[1:05:56] better hold that and say Lord now we've
[1:05:59] already given our tithes we've already
[1:06:01] given our offerings
[1:06:02] Lord what would you have me to do this
[1:06:05] what would you have me to do with this
[1:06:08] make everything count your finances your
[1:06:13] time is obviously the most precious
[1:06:14] thing your time is so valuable
[1:06:19] he says willing to communicate willing
[1:06:21] to witness willing to be uh to give
[1:06:23] encouragement or however call your
[1:06:25] brother call your sister he says lay up
[1:06:27] and store for themselves they lay up and
[1:06:29] store for themselves a good foundation
[1:06:31] against the time to come he said that
[1:06:33] they may lay hold on eternal life
[1:06:36] the Bible says let your good works be
[1:06:37] sent of what be seen of all men
[1:06:43] he says my kingdom is not of this world
[1:06:45] my treasures is not in this world my
[1:06:49] treasures is in heaven and my interest
[1:06:51] is God's people
[1:06:54] Church
[1:06:55] don't pattern yourself after some
[1:06:57] pastor's wife or some minister's wife or
[1:06:59] evangelist wife the wife patting
[1:07:01] yourself after the Bible right
[1:07:03] amen saints of God you be you
[1:07:08] you do what you can do God knows what
[1:07:12] you can do and if you yield to the Holy
[1:07:15] Ghost he can use you in ways he can
[1:07:18] multiply
[1:07:19] your gifts you can multiply your givings
[1:07:23] that's the truth
[1:07:25] he says uh we're just about down here he
[1:07:27] says call people call themselves with
[1:07:29] the Holy Ghost and playing all them old
[1:07:31] nasty tunes and things brother that's
[1:07:32] the Buzzard inciting feeling uh feeding
[1:07:34] on that you need the Holy Ghost in there
[1:07:36] feeding on the word of God he says amen
[1:07:38] and I hang your anger with you brother
[1:07:40] but you've got to know the truth amen he
[1:07:42] says that's the reason you can't have
[1:07:44] prayer meetings you ain't got no time
[1:07:46] for it only interested in one thing
[1:07:49] that's better in the church a little
[1:07:50] better teaching your people wearing a
[1:07:52] little better clothes drive a little
[1:07:53] better car get a little better job pay
[1:07:55] more ties that's it live in Manchester
[1:07:57] so forth oh mercy but what he says what
[1:07:59] was his whole Focus having a prayer
[1:08:01] meeting
[1:08:03] because with that prayer meeting will
[1:08:05] produce more with the hand of God than
[1:08:08] anything else
[1:08:12] we could have a big we could I could
[1:08:14] call a brother Amen brother Austin
[1:08:17] but Malachi says Lydia those that play
[1:08:19] this I said hey let's do a real church
[1:08:21] service we'll do a whole music service
[1:08:23] and we're gonna we're gonna worship God
[1:08:25] and you're gonna sit out there and let
[1:08:26] us worship for you
[1:08:28] we should all be in the worship right
[1:08:31] or should we have a time when we just
[1:08:33] say let's come together and pray for
[1:08:35] about two hours
[1:08:37] and we're gonna we're all gonna unify
[1:08:39] and agree on a certain thing what do we
[1:08:41] want to see and focus all our prayers
[1:08:43] what bring the incest incense up to God
[1:08:46] and see what God does how he answers
[1:08:48] we'll accomplish more of that away
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:53] he says and heathens are dying 144 000
[1:08:56] 140 000 a day without knowing Jesus
[1:08:58] Christ
[1:08:59] pull all kinds of money for everything
[1:09:01] else
[1:09:03] well I need I need a new welder or I
[1:09:05] need
[1:09:06] the poor missionary on the field leading
[1:09:09] his life out starving to death for
[1:09:11] they'll raise up on the day of judgment
[1:09:13] and condemn you and send you away their
[1:09:15] testimony will condemn them amen then
[1:09:18] talk about the real the Holy Spirit seal
[1:09:20] amen see how much see how important this
[1:09:22] is
[1:09:24] now we come to church we're faithful in
[1:09:26] these things this is our this is our
[1:09:28] life this is our not not just it's not
[1:09:30] really a duty this is our desire this is
[1:09:32] this is what we do right we are
[1:09:34] Christians we serve the Living God this
[1:09:36] is a time of worship right
[1:09:39] but we can also
[1:09:41] hit this area as well be bigger it's
[1:09:44] like this what what the Bible says Jesus
[1:09:46] said is more blessed to give than to
[1:09:48] receive
[1:09:51] the Lord sees every single penny every
[1:09:54] single nickel or dollar that you do to
[1:09:56] help somebody whether you tell anybody
[1:09:59] or not
[1:10:03] one day I was out with my apprentice and

[1:12:19] happened
[1:12:20] but he needed help
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:28] and I want to throw this in here
[1:12:39] I was taking a nap one day and I was
[1:12:41] listening to the Book of John
[1:12:43] you can stand here
[1:12:48] the saints of God
[1:12:50] I'll say there's anyone who knows me
[1:12:51] here it's probably my my nieces and
[1:12:53] nephews they know I'm I cut up a lot
[1:12:56] they know my faults and failures they
[1:12:58] see sometimes I say things I shouldn't
[1:13:00] say
[1:13:01] I do things I shouldn't do uh not wicked
[1:13:04] bad but just you know just just me you
[1:13:06] know just the carnal flesh just cutting
[1:13:08] up too much or there was this and that
[1:13:10] but I've tried to live a Christian Life
[1:13:12] the best I can
[1:13:14] when it comes down to it we'll take a
[1:13:16] stand
[1:13:18] if I see a certain thing in the
[1:13:19] scripture I gotta teach it
[1:13:22] if I hear a certain thing over this and
[1:13:23] that and I agree with it I'm gonna I'm
[1:13:25] gonna back it that's all I got
[1:13:27] there's a there's a point saying it's
[1:13:28] God we're we're who we are when it comes
[1:13:31] to Salvation when it comes to gospel we
[1:13:33] are all business
[1:13:36] we're a militant this is a war
[1:13:39] and we've got there's coming time where
[1:13:41] these decisions will be made it's coming
[1:13:42] we've got to stand and be ready to stand
[1:13:45] and as I was looking I was taking a nap
[1:13:46] and I was you know listening and yet
[1:13:48] still kind of out of it a little bit but
[1:13:50] I was listening
[1:13:51] and then I had drifted a little far
[1:13:53] and I got to John 21.
[1:13:58] and the man that was reading it said
[1:14:00] this he says this spake he signifying by
[1:14:02] what death he should glorify God and
[1:14:05] when he had spoken spoken this he said
[1:14:08] saith unto me follow me and when I heard
[1:14:12] follow me I shook I literally shook in
[1:14:15] my sleep and woke up
[1:14:18] and I started listening
[1:14:21] and the Bible says then Peter turning
[1:14:23] about seeth the disciple whom Jesus
[1:14:25] loved following which also leaned on his
[1:14:28] breast to supper and say Lord which is
[1:14:30] he that betrayeth thee Peter seeing
[1:14:33] seeing him saith Lord what shall this
[1:14:35] man do and Jesus unto him if I tear what
[1:14:37] if if it if I will eat Terry till I come
[1:14:40] wasn't to thee follow thou
[1:14:43] me
[1:14:45] saints of God we are trying our best to
[1:14:48] follow Christ I don't know why I woke up
[1:14:50] and I heard this and I like literally I
[1:14:52] felt my body shake and I come up on my
[1:14:55] sleep and I'm like Lord I want to follow
[1:14:57] you
[1:14:59] everything in my heart wants to follow
[1:15:01] you
[1:15:02] most the time in My Own Strength I think
[1:15:05] I can give all this up I can give it all
[1:15:07] up
[1:15:09] two thousand
[1:15:11] 11 or 10 I lost my house
[1:15:15] build it with my hands my papa even
[1:15:17] helped me
[1:15:18] build it
[1:15:20] but that was in a time when the banks
[1:15:21] were giving crazy loans I just couldn't
[1:15:22] afford it and I lost it
[1:15:24] if you ever lost the house
[1:15:26] especially one that you built with you
[1:15:30] and you take that kind of blow and you
[1:15:33] take it and you go on and then you
[1:15:34] recover and you get another place
[1:15:37] I'll tell you what it does something to
[1:15:39] you where it means nothing to you it
[1:15:41] means nothing
[1:15:42] if it would happen again I could let go
[1:15:44] of any house
[1:15:46] because all that labor that went into it
[1:15:48] meant absolutely zero
[1:15:52] nothing is nothing's Eternal here until
[1:15:56] we enter the millennium
[1:15:58] somebody else I drive past the house
[1:15:59] every once in a while and somebody else
[1:16:00] is living it they move this and put a
[1:16:02] building over here and they actually
[1:16:04] moved the well because they didn't have
[1:16:05] water
[1:16:06] because the well guys didn't well
[1:16:08] drill it
[1:16:10] and I drive past and I'm thinking Lord
[1:16:14] you allowed that to teach me something
[1:16:17] we have no continuing City
[1:16:19] what I have right now can go be gone
[1:16:21] tomorrow
[1:16:23] and there's nothing you can do I fought
[1:16:25] and I worked every side job I could to
[1:16:28] make that payment
[1:16:29] I was hardly ever at home I was working
[1:16:30] that try how it started but
[1:16:33] I did everything I could possibly
[1:16:36] I meant nothing
[1:16:39] so what's the most precious now what's
[1:16:40] the thing the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:16:43] I realized that how important these
[1:16:46] things are eternal
[1:16:48] these things are what God's going to
[1:16:50] give us rewards we've already got
[1:16:51] salvation now we're just what saying
[1:16:54] Lord God what do you what can I I oh we
[1:16:56] are oh we owe here
[1:16:58] we owe him he paid the price for us for
[1:17:01] our sins for my iniquities I mean sins
[1:17:04] are one thing but saints of God
[1:17:05] iniquities when you do something you
[1:17:07] know you shouldn't do and still do it
[1:17:11] I don't know why he's so merciful but he
[1:17:13] is
[1:17:14] and I am so grateful and I say Lord
[1:17:17] let's just let's just think on this
[1:17:19] right now let's just borrow close our
[1:17:21] eyes
[1:17:22] and just think for we're not going to
[1:17:24] say prayer right now just think on this
[1:17:26] just think Lord
[1:17:28] what more can I do
[1:17:30] for your kingdom Lord and Lord God if
[1:17:32] I'm doing all that you've ordained me to
[1:17:34] do
[1:17:35] then Lord put place no other burden on
[1:17:37] my heart
[1:17:38] but Lord if there's something more that
[1:17:40] I'm missing if I have greater gifts
[1:17:44] if there's more anointing for me there's
[1:17:46] uh more Ministry in any capacity Lord
[1:17:51] God
[1:17:52] reveal it to me

[1:17:56] us sink under your heart into your mind
[1:18:00] say Lord what's let's just say a prayer
