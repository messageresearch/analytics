TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Corinthian series Believe us part five uh by the grace of the Lord we'll read verses one two and three it's kind of where we left off last week we took a little skip ahead to chapter 13 I got some good feedback on that so I was thankful to the Lord helping us to understand the love of God a little deeper Hallelujah just what we need on life's journey is the love of God hallelujah so let's read 1 Corinthians chapter 2 1 2 and 3 by God's grace here we see the amazing character of a prophet of God the first church age messenger uh I would we' call him the great St Paul now he wouldn't call himself that but we would call him that because we appreciate God's servants give them double honor but let's look at here the character of St Paul God's true servant Hallelujah I'll read uh one and two and then we can all read three together and we'll be seated there by God's grace and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified let's read three together 1 two 3 and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you can be seated praise God hopefully this will work AAA because I'm going to plug it into the right place today Hallelujah so we want to continue on here by God's grace okay that's going to be good glory to God uh we we didn't read the four we just read the three but I thought I'd shorten it a little bit just to preserve some time here today so we're going to look at uh chapter two here we're going going to go right through by the grace of the Lord and the thoughts that the Lord put on my heart for this chapter I would like to preach them trust it'll be a blessing to you today Hallelujah so we looked at the introduction uh verses 1 through uh chapter 1 veres 1-9 the Believers standing and Grace Paul offers this church that was so full of mistakes he starts off by giving them so much grace Hallelujah brother Ram said that's how we ought to correct people first tell them how much we love them how much we appreciate them tell them what we're thankful for he said then you bring the correction after that so we see that modeled here in the scripture Paul talks about how they stand in Grace they have every gift they need he has Grace and peace for them but then in chap I'm sorry chapter 1 vers 10 he begins the correction on their divisions we looked at that and we'll continue to look at that today here by God's grace so chapter 1 was broken down into three sections the believer standing in Grace then you looked at the divisions in the church as far as who baptized them Paul said he was glad he baptized none of them other than guas and Crispus and then we look he looked at he ended the chapter by looking at Christ is the wisdom and power of God he hid all these wise things uh the mind of God he hid that from the wise and prudent of this world and revealed it unto babes such as would learn Hallelujah aren't you glad to be a baby in Christ today Hallelujah I'm not talking to immature I'm talking about just a humble CH uh child of God who has childlike Faith so let me just state that again we're children of God we're babes in Christ because we have childlike faith not that we're immature so in one way I'd say we're babies in Christ another way I'd say we're mature in Christ so does everybody understand that we're babes as far as we want to have childlike Faith but we're not babes as far as immature and giving into uh sins as we'll get to all these sins that we see in the Corinthian Church that's not kind that's not the kind of a bab we want to be Hallelujah in our spiritual life we want to be mature Paul says but as far as just our approach to God we want to have childlike Faith Hallelujah so chapter two he said and I Brethren when I came to you I came not with the Excellency of speech or of wisdom now he's not talking about the wisdom of God I'm going to emphasize that today because Paul always had the wisdom of God as we said on Wednesday what better W gift is there than wisdom there's none as far as the nine gifts the the greatest gift you can have is wisdom Hallelujah wisdom manages all the other gifts so Paul's talking about something different uh he's talking about worldly speech like worldly knowledge and worldly wisdom uh he declared unto them the testimony of God and he determined not to know anything among the Corinthians save Jesus Christ and him crucified and he had a good reason to do that of course this was the city of Corinth this was like a a port there where a lot of a lot of trade happened it was a very wealthy City and uh I forget how many millions of people were there it was it was a center it was the Roman Center of of that part of of the of the Kingdom uh as far as uh that area near Italy it was the I'm sorry further from Italy and so it was a very important place to be as we'll see here because because the Corinthians they highly valued public speaking and we get a glimpse of this I love this we get a glimpse of this in Acts 17 and when we look at acts 17 we see Paul and Athens which was only 50 m away so Corinth and Athens were very close and we we can see how Paul would come amongst many intellectual type of people or people that were into uh awful sins you know uh but yet were rich and had all these uh extravagant lives we can see how Paul would approach a group of individuals how many believe Paul had the power of the spirit how many believe he had the power of the spoken word that's right he did the Bible said it it was was plain but he but when he came mon of Corinthians he didn't come like like all these sophists or these orators that you would see in in Corinth and in Athens because that was uh they were kind of uh living off the glare of the Greek society right the Greeks magnified worldly wisdom and new ideas and intelligence and and eloquent speaking uh and human dramatic speaking but they lacked the power of God with the word of God hallelujah so that's what we'll see here uh you know just look at the EXT it was a Cosmopolitan City and it was known because it had so many intellectuals and they they placed such value on being a a good orator and a philosopher and public speaking were highly valued so you know they didn't have the internet in those days so they just couldn't go on the news and oh I wonder what's going on on X I wonder what's going on on Instagram you know uh hopefully you don't say CNN or MSNBC you know but they couldn't go on there they had to go out in the streets and they would hear uh these people talking they spend their time out uh in in the The Centers of the city and they hear people discussing ideas and sharing the news and that's how uh Corinth grew it it grew of course as a trade City but also this this worldly wisdom and they presented themselves I like that they presented themselves as wise and eloquent right but we know the the smoothest talker of all of them was the devil but he was the the father of Lies he was so smooth he could convince Even Adam to fall into sin individuals children of God that have never sinned before but he was such a smooth apparently a wise and and eloquent type of serpent he could convince them to sin Hallelujah that that's how slick and Sly brother Ram says that's how subtle the devil is he would they would use sophisticated arguments and pers uh persuasive speech to attract followers and these speakers often focus on the style persuasion and entertainment rather than the substance of their message now we see that amongst you know mega churches today and I'll just say like this you know Joel oin is probably the most uh uh stylish and persuasive and eloquent preacher I've probably ever heard but he's lacking substance he's lacking genuine repentance he's lacking sanctification he's lacking the baptism of the Holy Ghost so just being able to be eloquent doesn't qualify you as a man of God we want to be you know as as clear as possible uh we don't want to bring any reproach upon the gospel but God's not requiring human eloquence or or the style of a of a person's uh speaking ability or their personality God's not interested in man's personality God's interested in the character of his word hallelujah and God's not trying to entertain us God is trying to bring us truth God is trying to show us his presence Among Us that will recognize his presence so in this context of Corinth Paul was choosing deliberately to avoid Pol polishness being so polished and and every word is spoken particularly right and there's no stutters and there's no forgetfulness and it's just a beautiful memorized sermon Paul's specifically trying to avoid that because that's what they were used to that was from the world but Paul said I'm not from the world I come from Christ Hallelujah I was sent by Jesus Christ as a teacher of the Gentiles as an apostle and he wanted to show that he did not rely on human wisdom or eloquence or persuasive techniques but on the power of God that's what I and every Preacher Brother Cam and Simon and and brother Brooks and we must all uh we must all rely on the power of the Holy Spirit I'm not relying on that I know your your your needs I don't rely on my ability I'm trusting God to speak to every person like every service praise God whether it's a Wednesday night or Sunday night or Sunday morning I'm trusting in God I know I have no ability of my my own no preacher does but if we can just yield and let the Holy Spirit uh have his way and if each person can get hungry for God and we can be unified then we'll be in one place and one Accord and the spirit of God can move I just put that picture now they probably had a lot more Idols than that the Bible said uh Paul went there and he saw all there was like just a row of Idols there was all these kind of Idols so when when Paul when Paul came to Corinth is very similar to Athens right and what's the first thing he tells these these ID doubters and remember all these wise men sit around just all the time just saying new things he said I perceive that in all things things you're too superstitious you got all these wrong spiritual ideas uh you you got these ideas that there there's no really uh uh there there's no really foundation for them and our foundation is the rock of God's word Jesus is the rock hallelujah and Jesus said we must build our lives upon the rock of Christ Hallelujah his word amen and see he passed by and he he was watching them worship now of course they would have had an idol probably on every stone here you know you see some Idols up there he was watching their worship and remember these are all great speakers these are all uh can I say it Ted Talk people these are all college professors these are all Mega preachers and they could speak so eloquent so well and what would a prophet of God share he'd say you know I watched your devotion and I found an altar to the unknown God he said that's the one you ignorantly worship right so they were worshiping God they call him the unknown God but it was without understanding they didn't know that that's the really only true God there's no need to worship all these other gods so they would take time they'd worship the god uh of the Hebrews which we know was Jesus Christ eventually became Jesus Christ in the flesh body but but he he tried to correct them you're too superstitious too many different spiritual ideas you should get all your wisdom from the mind of God from the word of God hallelujah and then he ends by saying you know in God we live and in him we move and we have our being as certain also of your prophets have said for we are also his offspring now look at this he tries to connect no even some of your speakers have talked about how we're The Offspring of God and he so he tries to he tries to say well you guys believe this and that's what the truth is there's some truth in what you believe but you don't believe all the truth you have to accept all the truth of God for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is like a under gold or silver right or a statue he said or stone Graven by art or man's device he says and the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent now notice how can and brother Austin and Mal and I have talked about this these Street Preachers that we admire we admire their courage right and what what what do we admire when their arguments bring people down to their own sin what's the whole point of of preaching out in the streets what would be the whole point to get people to see their Sinners they need their sins forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's the whole point this is the power of the Gospel the power of the Gospel is to bring the reality of Christ sacrifice to the Forefront of every mind so realize we are guilty and if not if we don't repent of our sins we're going to hell but there's good news Jesus Paid the price and we can go to heaven and live with him if we repent of our sins Hallelujah the good news of the Gospel so what would a prophet of God what would a church member say to the most uh eloquent and the most uh influential the richest uh the the the most uh famous people what would he say he said you're too superstitious it's time to repent Hallelujah and so see church we ought to be encouraged when the Holy Ghost comes Among Us and tries to get us to repent of our sins to remind us that if we're still battling if we're battling we need to overcome and God can give us Grace for our our trials our weaknesses he can make our weaknesses strong Hallelujah that's right and then he closes by saying because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man so he says you need to repent and you're going to come to the Judgment every every person will stand before Jesus Christ every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess Hallelujah God ordained Jesus Will judge the world Hallelujah and he's given Assurance to all men because he raised him from the dead so now he brings in the resurrection he brings in the death Resurrection repentance what would you say to the smartest most eloquent uh richest uh Aristocrats you'd bring them to repentance the death burial and sacrifice of Jesus Christ that's what Paul said to the Corinthians right he said it right there I I decided I didn't I wasn't going to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified Hallelujah and when they heard of the resurrection of the Dead some mocked and others said we will hear again the again of this matter so Paul departed from them anybody see any uh uh casting out Devils here is there any uh uh bloody flux here uh healed like he did on the island of Mita did he uh did he cast out any Devils out of any Sorcerers no but what did he have the wisdom of God what do you think did he have the wisdom of God did he have the power of God yes he had to know he just came to plant some seeds and remember he's going to plant but somebody else might come around and water those seeds right but then who's got to give the increase God's got to give that if God wanted a demon to be cast out God would anointed Paul ready to go and that person with a demon would have been ready to be free from it and wanted to be free from the demon power they would want Satan out of their house amen that's how we got to look at this he didn't walk on water he didn't try to do anything uh anything Supernatural because he wasn't led to do it he was led to give them the wisdom of God to tell them repent believe the gospel Jesus died for your sins then he rose to forgive you and you'll face Jesus someday hallelujah how many believe that's the power of God the Bible say some believe some didn't because the it's the preaching of the Cross that's the power of the Gospel to save them that would believe hallelujah it's the power of God so I know that's the power of God for us today Hallelujah and so Paul when Paul went to the Corinthians how did he come he was in weakness and in fear and in much trembling which was the opposite of all the or many of the preachers they were used to Hallelujah and uh remember I'll pull some scriptures here they were used to having uh the most eloquent preachers so uh it seems like some of these eloquent speakers there in Corinth you know some maybe some of them got saved they started getting to the church they started preaching and teaching you're going to see it they had 10,000 instructors look at this next verse though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ that's quite now I know he's exaggerating but that's quite a few guest ministers they had in there I I want to kind of limit Our Guest ministers right for financial reasons but also doctrinal reasons right we just don't let we just I don't open up my Pulpit to anybody hallelujah it's got to be someone that's been tried that's been tested someone I prayed about and and then if they fail the test they won't be back anymore right but Paul said I didn't come the same way all these other preachers are preach to you because because you have 10,000 instructors in Christ but not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I begotten you through the gospel so a lot of these people were were born again under Paul's Ministry or heard about Christ through Paul's Ministry and he calls himself a father to them Hallelujah and then you know the next letter the second Corinthians 11 he says for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the a Apostles of Christ so Paul says you've got these false uh false Apostles right among you it's actually the devil transforming himself trying to impersonate an apostle and they let them preach in their church so how does Paul Come Paul comes in weakness trembling and fear Paul comes in humility not with uh the most eloquent words and the most beautiful sermon and the most deep intellectual thoughts Paul came with repentance Hallelujah right then look at verse 20 this is the one that met so much to me when I preach on the doctrines of devil series Paul said they allowed the Corinthian Pastor who is this pastor brother Austin we got to look this guy up in heaven did he make it to Heaven this pastor allowed men to bring them into bondage right with with legalism like a legalism was oh you can only wear long sleeves you can never wear short sleeves at church so don't don't everybody look down at your sleeves it don't matter here it doesn't matter here but they would take them into bondage or your dress has to be uh this many inches above the ankle or below the ankle there's churches like that you know thank God we're not a part of it but but Paul said look what you've allowed you've allowed preachers to bring you into legalistic thoughts and they devour you they take away uh all your joy all your Victory Hallelujah and then the preachers exalted themselves and he said he said they they even let the preachers disrespect them right to their face disrespect the people but see Paul said I've got to come different than the the way these false preachers are coming I got to come in the humility of Christ Hallelujah and my speech in my preaching was not with enticing this means persuasive words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and in power so see when Paul went to Athens now this is different but when Paul went to Athens he demonstrated the gospel by telling you you're superstitious you worship the god the true God a little bit but you need to repent and God's demanding you to repent that's the power of the Gospel he said came in the demonstration of the power of the Gospel now we know in Corinth people were healed uh Paul Jesus told Paul you have much people in this city we know there was signs Miracles and wonders as well but I want you to see what Paul's setting up here he's setting up the power of the Gospel will be different from a a false gospel a man- centered gospel instead of a word- centered gospel Glory now remember God's not against a man being eloquent no preacher was as eloquent as Apollos and that's true because that's what the Bible says about him the bi if when the Bible names a couple things about him he's eloquent and he was mighty in the scripture okay so there's nothing wrong with uh speaking perfectly and and getting every word right and and citing every verse approximately or completely accurately there's nothing wrong with that God's not against eloquence but God's against the enticing words or the the lying persuasive words brother R called them subtle lies as I preached to you a few weeks ago uh from the Rapture 1965 here's where he said it he said these Protestants now these these uh doctors of a Divinity they said oh the Bible's nothing but a book a history of the church and they didn't have it in literature till about 250 years ago it's always been the church now he's talking about exalting denominational tradition instead of the word they're saying oh well we haven't had the Bible that long so see before that we just we just relied on Church tradition they said oh it it was it's the church not the Bible the Bible's just a a history of what the church did he said what a subtle lie that is right and I'll just say like this oh we've got the tapes we don't need the Bible anymore what a subtle lie that is we got some subtle Liars around the message right the same lying Spirit Hallelujah I love a brother said I was looking up in the unveiling of God they had someone remember someone tried to tried to trap brother Bram and they said well surely uh with all the experience of you had uh you can tell us the revelation of the seven Thunders and write a new Bible right and brother BR said that was the devil trying to trap me I said but you're wrong he said yes I've had experiences but revelation 22 says you can't add one word or take one word away Hallelujah so brother man caught that lying spirit that subtle lie that would try to break something in the word of God he caught it by the discernment of the Holy Spirit that's right what a subtle eye why we had the Bible for 3,000 years the old testament's been written in the scripture for hundreds and hundreds of years before the coming of Christ just a subtle thing of the devil so you get a smart man or intellectual man or something like that and they they talk so well they can just bring any little lie upon people and people just say uhuh how many of you are checking what I preach on Monday morning anybody checking me who's checking me on Monday night or who's checking me Tuesday morning you ought to you ought to make sure that what I say is the word of God hallelujah and you got a chance sometimes once a week to ask me about it so I appreciate that that's what I want I don't want to ever exalt myself where I'm untouchable I can't be questioned I can always be questioned Hallelujah now Paul's not talking about you know uh uh he didn't have God's wisdom or and this is where a lot of people uh mistake they mistake the Bible and even quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham brother R preach a sermon uh wisdom versus Faith yeah wisdom versus faith and and so people say see faith is greater than wisdom he's not talking about Godly wisdom he's talking about worldly wisdom Hallelujah wisdom versus faith I think it was 61 if I'm not mistaken I've heard it before but he's not talking about faith is greater than wisdom now love is greater than Faith Hallelujah we just preached on that last week and the church said these three but the greatest of these is Charity but see people misunderstand it so let's not forget the scripture get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee if you love the wisdom of God God's wisdom will keep you in difficult times it'll protect you wisdom is the principal thing with therefore get wisdom with all you're getting get wisdom we put so much effort into trying to make a living right keep things clean and and get our get nice clothes we put all this effort in this but the Bible said with all your efforts get the wisdom of God have a make so make sure you have a time where you're trying to get the wisdom of God Sunday is a great day to do it amen but Monday and Tuesday are just as good Hallelujah exalt wisdom and she will promote you Hallelujah who wants a promotion at work don't raise your hand God's talking about a spiritual promotion here now I see where they get it they talk about getting a spiritual promotion exalt her I see a I see a promotional stack right there the statue of a perfect man Hallelujah wisdom will bring you to honor when you Embrace her so God will honor you when you embrace the wisdom of God I wisdom now where did wisdom start wisdom started dwelling with God in the beginning I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge with witty of witty inventions I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance I will fill their Treasures what a promise and the church said wisdom was with God in the beginning and if you love God's wisdom God will fill you up with treasure anybody any anybody spiritual uh Rich this morning by God's grace who's got the spiritual Riches of God hallelujah if youve have if you had any major scars in your life you'll be thankful for the wisdom of God to heal your scars and to keep you from future scars right he said if you if you love wisdom if you hold on to wisdom and embrace wisdom he'll fill you with treasure she'll fill you with treasure speaking of the the feminine attribute Hallelujah the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old wisdom was set up before from Everlasting from the beginning before the Earth was wisdom was there with God which we would say is the logos of God it's the Holy Spirit the visible Holy Spirit Christ Hallelujah Christ means the anointed Hallelujah so the visible the the uh the manifested spirit of God the visible spirit of God the logos of God is the wisdom of God and church well what are we left with the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things and desperately wicked who can know it don't you some some sometimes we see this on a daily basis my goodness there's still wickedness in me and the church said wow this sin nature is so wicked this I hadn't even thought about that the devil placed that right there I I wasn't even looking for I wasn't even trying and the devil tries to place all these traps and snares but through many snares and toils we've come but God will bring us through every one of them Hallelujah Grace will bring me through Grace will lead me home Hallelujah I was reading in Ezekiel and it's the same in Jeremiah God rebukes them because they they prophesy lies from their own Hearts their own imaginations how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yay they are prophets of the deceit of Their Own Heart people lie in the name of the Lord people lie and say the Lord told me this or the Lord led me to do this he'll never lead you to sin hallelujah hallelujah that's your deceitful heart and you're trying to Mas mask your sin uh by calling it from the Lord right God will never lead you to into the sin and so see Paul was saying don't focus on the messenger focus on the message like brother Ram said oh if he's praying if they could forget the illiterate Messengers and remember it's not the messenger it's the message he's come down again with us in the form of a pillar of light and he moves with the same Miracles same signs nothing out of the Bible saying right with the Bible holding it under subjection bringing out his glory showing his power blessed be his holy name I know you must think that I'm crazy but oh that blessed Eternal rest that's in my soul though storms may wave my anchor holds within the veil amen so brother said over and over again don't look at the messenger look at the message and church don't you know the same is true today how many believe the pillar of fire is here amen if anything could ever be done here that would be any good it had to be Jesus Christ in the form of the pillar of fire hallelujah amen cuz I have no power you have no power you have no Authority or or we we we say power of yourself to do anything we must be led of God to do anything praise God but if God's spirit was with brother raham then God's spirit is with this word hallelujah because we're preaching the same message brother Randon preached hallelujah amen he said Lord stand with the church who prayed with me and stood by me in the times of trouble Lord I love them and I offer my prayer that they will look to you Lord may they look away from this Mortal clay of a servant brother man saying may they look to him who is the omnipotent who is and we know Lord that we are finite no matter who we are we're still mortal but not the messenger but the message Grant it Lord that's where we point to Jesus Christ the son of God grant that he'll be so real to everyone here today even to the little children little children that he will become the absolute of the entire congregation we ask it in Jesus name amen gr granted Hallelujah that's what that's what we must realize Christ is here today to help us hallelujah Christ wants to minister to you he said wherever two or three are gathered there I am Hallelujah he came to set us free he came to deliver us to give us wisdom whatever we have need of he's here to help us hallelujah because he's the absolute Hallelujah said a few months later if you haven't got that absolute now get it if You' like to have that absolute that Assurance in your heart of the Holy Spirit raise your hand and say I want something that'll punctuate the word of God and I can see the word of God manifest he said it's all over the building see when people are responding when people are are hungry for God when people are in need of the word of God the Holy Spirit can move all over the building Hallelujah Oh my he said I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass you by I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you pay any attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you now that's why I believe God took brother B at 56 years old think about that brother William isn't he 73 now or 72 73 amen hallelujah and you know but God took brother at 56 why we don't know but this I think this is a clue he says he will share his glory with nobody that's right don't you watch the messenger watch the message if a man run in here and he might be black yellow brown ragged if he's got a check for you for a bank draft for a million dollars you wouldn't care what color he was or how he was dressed it's the message he has for you remember said now don't look at the grammar and the things you just remember I'm telling you about Jesus Christ who's here now you believe him with all your heart don't you fail to believe him Hallelujah Glory now I want to break this this is a famous uh sermon brother I don't know if you've heard it perfect strength by Perfect weakness it's a very long sermon but brother Ram lays out a lot of beautiful things how we must all we must all live by the power of God and we can we have no ability to trust our own human strength he talks about Moses Moses made all these mistakes Paul made all these mistakes uh he said and see we we must live by the power of God when we're weak in ourselves and we know we have no strength then we can be strong amen so it's about it's like we talked about last Sunday children taking up your cross and following God who was it was it Eden said how do I crucify myself or how do I how do I take up my cross and follow you cannot give into any desires of the flesh you must crucify them you must take the word of God you must believe God's word you must obey the word of God so I'm going to break into just a few of these quotes brother baham said you know he's he's in paragraph 82 of this sermon and he breaks into 1 Corinthians chapter 2 so when I was reading this this this memory came to me I've never preached this full sermon but maybe I'll have to by God's grace he said but Paul had to forget all he ever knowed in order to know Christ let's see what he said himself about himself what he had to do this man was trained he could speak pretty near any language there was in the world and then he was going to make havoc on the church skipping for this he said see Paul had to realize okay now he said he had to receive Christ listen to what he said how strong and great he was he had to forget it he had to realize that he could not depend upon himself he had to realize that his education was nothing he had to realize that all the training he'd ever had he'd have to forget everything he's ever trained for listen to him now and then that's the scripture we read I never come to you say no I'm Dr Saul from the school of soand so I'm of that great sect of this denomination Paul said I never came to you like that I'm determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified Paul said I'm determined to know nothing about your abilities I know that there's nothing in you and I'm only determined to know one thing that I see in you that's Jesus Christ and him crucified the crucified savior among you that's all I'm going to recognize Hallelujah can you imagine a a man a pH of Pharisees a teacher of the teachers a man that was trained from childhood for the ministry to be a eloquent man that was smart and Brilliant to come to a class of people like the Corinthians and say I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling a man who turned the world upside down the greatest missionary that's ever been known outside of Christ he said another quote confess that he come in weakness not as a trained scholar but in weakness and fear lest he step off the path somewhere in much trembling because he could not trust in his own ability now church that's how I want to come to church that's how you should come to church that's why I try to lay here or lay lay somewhere and say Lord I Have Nothing help me not to get in the flesh help me not to say anything from my thoughts help me to say your thoughts amen right because he said this is how I had to come I can't trust my ability now one thing we can trust is in the ability of the Holy Spirit praise God when God's spirit comes and anoints us to praise and worship repent to AC accept the promise of God we can recognize God's spirit that gives us the ability to do what God's called us to do Hallelujah even Malachi or Lydia as a musician they have to lean on God so it's the ability of the holy spirit in them I think it was a few weeks ago didn't Malachi was saying and he was saying in in the one service just everything was flowing good remember remember you telling that that was on Sunday nights we talk about our favorite uh memories from the day you know our of the services and Malachi was saying I thought I love that that that means God was just blessing every he was just yielded to the holy Spirit now God lets him I'm sure play some play some things that aren't exactly perfect all the time too right just like the song leader does all these crazy songs Crazy mistakes right the song leader wink wink but you know but we have to realize I can't trust in our ability we can just yield our ability to God and let the Holy Spirit Come anoint us and speak what God puts on our heart Hallelujah and play what God puts upon our fingers and upon our minds and then sing as God would lead us to sing Hallelujah that's the reason he was fearing not because he was scared of anything so so when he says I come in weakness and fear he said not that I'm scared of anybody in the church he was scared he would displease God in some way that he'd get his own ability mixed up into it something that he learned he was telling them that I didn't come to you with this Excellency of speech I come to you in the fear that I would come that way but I come to you knowing nothing but Christ and him crucified he reads that verse that we'll read again listen to this man was a warrior who' stripped himself of pride is what we're getting at this whole thing of oh I've got the ability I can do this in the church or I can do this for God when we get that feeling we can't do anything for God that's a prideful Spirit we got to strip ourselves of that prideful Spirit we can't do anything for God except God would come and anoint me for his glory you know we saw Haz at at mustard seed on Friday night he walked by I'm like I know that guy and I said 'lord if it's of you send him my way again and here he come right by me I said oh here's my chance I said God bless you sir I said did you go to Austin Alina's wedding but I was praying in the store Lord send him my way and he was telling me some things that are happened I said look that's God that's God providing a a friend Austin Elena for you and then look God used you to do this he's like yeah he yeah that that's probably right he said I appreciate your positivity I said man it's God setting you up HZ and so uh you know I just that blessed my heart to see him again but we have to strip ourselves of our own thoughts and our own abilities unless you would try to do something within yourselves I was trying to say Lord don't let me say what I want to say and I I've always got to adjust my thoughts how can I minister to him how can I talk about him how can I uh try to show God to him somehow Hallelujah he brother says I hope that gets down deep to us how many want the word of God to go deep today not just head knowledge but down into your soul and I like this and the tape world too that's us how many how many live in the tape world I live in the tape world that's right yeah you're not there in the physical service brother random we live in tape world I enjoy tape World Hallelujah that you realize you've got to become nothing not a know it all not a great somebody but a nobody you got to become dust see so I don't care if people don't like me I don't care if I get less popular I really don't care if I get less views really or anything like that what I care about is can God use me for His Glory Hallelujah remember remember Jesus and Paul both by the end they were rejected they were less popular and brother brandom at the end than they were at the beginning they didn't grow in popularity they got less in popularity he says you got to become dust dust brother Jess brother brand dust yeah you got to become dust did anybody wipe any dust off your shoes this morning butam said that's what you got to become there's some dust on there yeah get some dust that's what you got to become the dust Church the dust now he's going to tell us why he's going to show us the balance you're either too lazy or you're doing too much brother said you got to be right in the middle of the road right you're not lazy because you didn't you you didn't skip church today so don't don't let the devil beat you up you're not lazy we just got to find the balance right brother's going to tell us he said you got to become d us you got to get the place that you know that you're nothing Hallelujah and don't never rise above it for as soon as you rise above it you rise above God think about that oh I can do this I can go do this for God I've got all the faith I've got all the power but says you've already risen above God so now you got to we got to balance this right because there's times God has anointed you and you spoken the word right uh right uh like I've said before I've spoken to different things and God is honored it by God's grace but that would be in humility we're under the humility of the Holy Spirit not a sinful Pride attitude okay so there's a great balance here don't never rise above it because you rise above God you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus so the picture of Paul getting knocked off off his high horse right and laying in the dust brother said keep yourself there in the dust and say Lord what must I do Hallelujah that's what his question was Lord what do you want me to do amen that's how each one of us should do you've got to keep yourself off your high horses and that's for everywhere here and in the tape world where we live oh what a preacher what a great man he sought God he said oh God I'm weak I don't know what to do I just pray God you strengthen me take my infirmities away from me these things I so he's quoting 2 Corinthians 12 where Paul says three times take take this buffeting demonic messenger from my body right isn't that something I just never thought about that wow a holy ghost filled person could have demon powers all over filling their bodies look at that God spoke back to him and said Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness then Paul said well when I'm weak then I'm strong he said then I will glory in my infirmities of my weaknesses and so forth I'm thanking God that I got all of it out of me as far as my pride and when I get everything out of me then God can come in but as long as I've got some of myself there then God can't get in now he's talking about Pride Hallelujah there it is we smother him out so brother gives us this illustration we smother God out we drive him away from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves okay our own Pride you know the longer I'm serving God the the greater I realize pride is the greatest sin it's the greatest one we're tempted with because because most of us will keep the lust of the flesh lust of the Eyes under control but it's that Pride that gets us where we try to think we can do something or we know we think we know what to do but we got to lay in the dust until God tells us what to do amen hallelujah here's a here's a great balce here's I've als often said this the greatest enemy I got is Satan did I read that right the greatest enemy I got is the tape church ministry no no no no it's William brandham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy so that's one extreme I don't do nothing I'm not seeking God for any leadership I'm just lazy brother Ram said he gets lazy sometimes church so Church don't let the devil beat you up brother Ram got lazy and the church said he said it he's either telling the truth or lying he's telling the truth he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture right so see both sides you got deci side I'm not going to do nothing about it the other side well yeah I'm going to show them who boss I'm going to show them what kind of faith I got I'm gonna go do this and I'm gonna go show everybody what I got to do so see that brother is going on the extremes here of human of human thinking well I can do nothing about it I if God's just going to work it out whether I pray for brother Keith or not you know God's gonna work go that's lazy other side is well Keith just needs to speak the word well how you better be led by the spirit before you say that right Hallelujah so see we see both extremes here but when I can get rid of that guy who William brandham when Jesse Smith can get rid of Jesse Smith when I can get to a place when he's out the way then God can come over and do some things that William brandham knows nothing about right brother Jose I love this quote Hallelujah let let Jose get out of God's way and then God can do something Jose doesn't know anything about Hallelujah right you can put your all put your name in there Glory that's what Paul's saying this is what I've got to do when I come to the church to the Corinthians I've got to come like this I've got to know nothing I've got to know Christ I got to be led by the Holy Spirit that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot all right now remember in the in the sermon if you go listen to it he talks about uh Moses Moses knew you know he was uh to be the the the uh the prophet that that took Israel the promis land and what he do he tried to do it himself by killing that Egyptian brother BR said what did 40 years of education produce one stinking Ed Egyptian he said right but see but when he goes out when he runs and he he loses his own Egyptian training and thoughts then he has the mind of Christ then one man comes over to take over the entire country because God's with him Hallelujah because God now had perfect strength in his weakness Hallelujah right I'm not going to bring this promise to pass it's not going to happen when I want it to it's going to happen when God wants it to Hallelujah waiting on the timing of God waiting on the season of God waiting for the leadership of God and no notice many times God's got to Humble people before he can use them he's got to let them fall flat on their face I'm not going to physically trip on my face here but you get the you get the picture he let Moses fall flat on his face he let Paul knocked Paul right off the horse course flat on his face and then God said now I can use you when you're in the dust and you know you're nothing you know you're a failure think of all these failures these these Servants of God had Jonah running from the presence of God I mean Moses killing a man not uh not circumcising his children Paul persecuting the church right holding Steven's coat while they Stone stepen yeah that's right they need to kill this Christian and yet God let them fail to such a degree but then God was showing them though you fail you're when you're weak then I'll be strong in you you've got to know you're nothing you got to know you have no ability you're just a vessel that I'm going to pour my spirit in Hallelujah give you an overflow Hallelujah verse fin get to verse five now so that your faith should stand not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God again he's not talking about God's wisdom he's talking about man's Wisdom right he's not talking about uh your your faith isn't in the wisdom of God no your faith is in the wisdom of God he's talking about don't let it be in the wisdom of men sinful wisdom how because remember it's the it's the principle thing all effort should be made to get the wisdom of God and remember how did Paul go to Athens how did Paul go to Athens in the wisdom of the Holy Spirit that's what the what Holy Spirit wanted to do the Holy Spirit wanted to bring out oh they they got ignorant worship but you need to repent you're all going to stand before Jesus Christ Christ he died he resurrected he's coming to judge you and we have we are The Offspring of God hallelujah praise God we are God's Offspring we're God's children and that was the power of God to them the wisdom of God now which one of you have ever which one of us have ever stood in the street corner and preached to Sinners I haven't preached but I've sang and prayed for people just a couple just twice well three times I guess one in or four times two in Guyana two here with brother Brooks and akan we did that that that's the power of God to stand there it's the power of God when the spirit gives you the truth when the spirit gives you the word and tries to cuse Sinners to repent that's the love of God hallelujah that's the charity of God verse six how be it we speak wisdom among them the saints that are perfect or full aged so mature right so here's the maturity where we're not babes in one way we're we're we're children we have childlike Faith to believe God but we're not uh babies with our spiritual character God speaks his wisdom Paul said he speaks God's wisdom among the saints that are mature yet not the wisdom of this world see nor the princes of this world that come to not see Paul saying I didn't come in the worldly wisdom I come in the wisdom of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah but we speak the wisdom of uh wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory or honor think about that God revealed these seven SE seals to us God revealed the marriage and divorce and and the water baptism and all these wonderful Revelations God revealed it to us so it would be for our honor because when we receive the word of God we become like God when we receive the word of God we get the character of God and then God can honor us on the day of judgment because we received God's word we took it to our lives we invested in it and we became like God hallelujah because we're his offspring amen hallelujah and that's why I told you when we have different guest people I try to just bring the if I feel led of the Holy Spirit I try to just bring the uh the Revelation maybe not so high or eat deep you can go either way right high or deep I just try to bring it down to more of a mature level like a repentance and a water baptism and a getting saved right because our wisdom is very deep think about that when we preach on Revelation 10 or the seven Thunders or the Seven Seals it gets pretty deep in here praise God it gets very deep most preachers can't even understand the Seven Seals and I'm not saying that derogatory it's just a deep thing even the church ages a lot of preachers can't understand it but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery but remember the Bible said if you're a child of God you'll cry out for the wisdom of God in Proverbs chapter two if you want the wisdom of God you'll cry out for it and if you cry out for it God will give it to you so let's look at that what was the wisdom of God in Acts 17 it was repentance the shy that you're going to stand before Christ and be judged this was the power of God the Resurrection the death bar and resurrection and true worship Hallelujah of course we know the the fear of the Lord is the hating of evil that's the beginning of wisdom see Paul was trying to get them to the beginning of God's wisdom repent of all this idolatry God's not an idol God's not a something you can build with your own hands God gave you that God made you that way Hallelujah that you're God's creation you can't create God oh the mystery of God now I like verse eight I'm going to spend a little time on this one here maybe by God's grace we'll see which none of the princes of this world knew so see none of the Sinners knew about the manifold wisdom of God none of them knew about the Seven Seals or the the New Testament Mysteries the Jew and Gentile the wall being broken down between Jews and Gentiles and now both folds come into one fold both sheeps uh both flocks come into onefold as Jesus said in John chapter 10 they didn't know the wisdom of God for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory so think about that if Satan would have known what we have today he would not have let Jesus die on the cross Hallelujah why because you'd still be in Chains because Jesus died on the cross now you're set free because Jesus died on the cross now you're healed now you're saved now you got the Waters of Life flowing out of you Hallelujah glory to God so see the crucifixion and the forthcoming Resurrection ction it made many anointed ones rather than just one anointed one right because Jesus was the anointed one the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily now I got four points here I want to bring out here Satan would not have had Jesus crucified if he was going to know he'd lose the keys to his house Hallelujah because the Bible said Jesus died through death he defeated death right because he lived up death came about because of Disobedience Jesus lived a life of obedience so he conquered death Hallelujah he didn't deserve to die but he died anyway to conquer death Hallelujah he never would have done it if he would have known Jesus would have knocked on his door and took the keys of death and hell and then he emptied out uh he emptied out paradise of all the Old Testament Saints he would not have let it he he would not have crucified Jesus if he knew he was going to lose all his prisoners amen Jesus come down there took all the prisoners and said follow me we're going to make a Whistle Stop in Jerusalem hallelujah amen glory and like Moses Moses smoked the Rock and then water came out of the rock Satan would not have had Jesus crucified if he would if he knew Jesus was the spiritual Rock and when and when uh when when actually God allowed Jesus to be smoked when The Rock was smoked all the Healing Waters poured out and it poured out on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah he said I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh Hallelujah Satan would not have done that he would have want us to be dry but how many know you don't have to be dry today Hallelujah if you're dry today take a good drink brother BR says speak to the Rock if you're thirsty speak to the Rock speak to Jesus and the water will come out of the rock hallelujah Church you don't have to be thirsty today you don't have to be uh hungry for God today if you speak to God God will pour out his blessings that's the promise that's what the New Testament accomplished Hallelujah the third thing when he gave up the ghost it allowed the will or the inheritance of the New Covenant to go into action the Bible said an inheritance cannot be given until the death of the testator so Satan would not have had Jesus die if he would have known all the inheritance was going to be given to the children oh oh my Hallelujah church we have the inheritance of God how many enjoy The Riches of his holy spirit Hallelujah that's what we should be enjoying that should be the joy of Our Lives amen because Jesus died we get the benefits hallelujah our savior died our husband died and we get all this inheritance praise God there's so many blessings there's blessings for today blessings for tomorrow there's blessings for as many days as we'll be here it's in the inheritance it's in God's Will and God's will will be poured out Hallelujah who's going to stop God from giving out his will Hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord Isaiah 53 said we were healed with his stripes so Satan would not allow Jesus to go to Calvary if he knew with every stripe that he received every beating that he received every drop of blood that that he received was actually paying for our judgment Satan would not have allowed him to go think about that with each stripe yes uh your healing was being paid for amen so this stripe you are healed from depression with that stripe you're healed from cancer Hallelujah with that stripe you're healed from Pride all your prideful sins right with that with that whip you're healed from your lust of your eyes your lust of the flesh every sickness every disease every spiritual attack of the of the devil was paid for and with his stripes you were healed Satan would not have done that if he'd have known all the blessings that we were going to experience oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord brother Bram even said Jesus on the way down to Hell condemned every demon on the way down to Hell as he was going to Satan's house he condemned the demon of depression the demon of Oppression right the demon of sickness and infirmities and blindness and all these uh demonic addictions he condemned every single one until he got to Satan and then he took the keys of death and hell and he overcame he emptied out paradise and that's what he does he's our great Redeemer Hallelujah oh my hallelujah thank you Lord how we thankful that God sent Jesus to die for our sins every Redemptive blessing H was hiding in that rock being smitten and when it was smitten all the lifegiving uh spirit of God came pouring out to you and I now we can live the Christian life thank God I like this one brother man said let me tell you you weren't the devil stood up just start preaching Divine Healing Jesus died for Divine Healing Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 Souls were saved and Satan never even moved he never tried to persecute the church but a couple days afterwards he healed a man at the gate called Beautiful who is lame and all hell turned loose on him right they got arrested they got beaten they got taken to jail right that's right the devil don't like to see God display his power he thinks he's got a lot of power but he's finished amen our Christ is predominant take the initiative don't let him push something on you and the church said Don't Let The Devil push something on you you push it back Hallelujah right now I'm talking about with that balance right not not you're trying to do too much but you're led by God to push it back Hallelujah like I said I come back in July from those meetings in in Iowa I was preaching all these testimonies of Divine Healing what happened August I start getting all these battles right that's how it is you start testifying the power of God and the I'm talking about the real presence of God hallelujah I'm talking about God stepping down the services doing something Supernatural you start testifying to that you know Satan's going to try to make the church cold again he's going to come come try to uh fight the church and make the church nervous and afraid but we're supposed to be free we're supposed to be children of Faith hallelujah amen amen hallelujah that's right amen this is uh the gospel the gospel heals our spiritual diseases but also our natural sicknesses Hallelujah Satan wants to try to get us cold on God but we got to tell the devil we're not going to go your way we're going to cast down any thought that magnifies itself against the word of God hallelujah verse n but as it is written eyes is not seen ears not heard neither hath entered in the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him so Paul says we speak God's wisdom it's just for the Saints right the world can't receive it they don't know it and these are the things uh what God has given us because he loves us think about that the godhead is one person God gave that to you because he loved you the serpent seed the marriage and divorce God gave that to us because he loved us the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptism thank God we if we were baptized in titles we can be baptized the right way in the name of the savior God gave us that because he loved us he let us understand predestination that we're just not here by accident God had a thought about us and God had to bring that thought to pass God sent us here at exactly the right time right when he wanted us to be here and he sent us to be here in the last days in the seventh Church age of all the church ages he sent us here to be on fire not lukewarm not cold God sent us here to be on fire amen trying to stir up your fire today by God's grace Hallelujah anybody can anybody tell Hallelujah God has prepared the this wisdom of God the mystery of God we speak God's wisdom in the mystery God's prepared it for those that he loves Hallelujah brother Ram said Jesus will answer all of our unanswered questions now I'm talking about future things he's prepared for us right but this verse has a dual application because we're going to look at verse 10 we're going to look at verse 10 just a moment God loved us so much he prepared for us all the things not just the future things in heaven or in the Millennium or the future home but also here on this earth right because what's the next verse say but God hath that means he already has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God church I was raised in the Pentecostal church I never heard anything about the mysteries of God but when I come to the message now I see the mysteries of God now I I I see how God is one person not three Gods right now I see the the god of the Old Testament isn't mad but you know the god of the New Testament is happy for us that's not how we see it we see the wisdom of God we understand the plan of God it's the same God all the way through praise God he's given us the message of Grace it's always been Grace hallelujah it's never been legalism it's always been grace even in the law God was gracious Hallelujah the law was a school teacher to bring us to Christ that none of us could keep the the all the laws of God except a Holy One except a body that God has prepared for himself for sacrifice Hallelujah so we must recognize that God yes he has things we don't know that our future they're so amazing for us because he loves us but we should enjoy what God has given us now the plan the mystery of God how many en joining the Rapture series here that's part of the mystery that God is revealing to us now hallelujah what a blessing that is so we have a a dual promise God's going to give us things now and then it hasn't even think about that it hasn't entered into our mind the things that God has for us I love when people ask me uh brother Jesse are we going to go live on other planets and I said we might right will all of our uh will all of our our our animals that pass on be there they might but I've got this promise it h i can't even comprehend what God has for me because he loves me of all the things I could want it's even beyond that hallelujah praise God it's it's beyond what it hasn't even come into my mind Hallelujah I I can't reach that high those thoughts are too high for me I'm too low I'm too much of a human Jesse Smith keeps getting in my way Hallelujah I'm too much of a human but God has things that I can't comprehend because he loves me because he loves you and the cross showed us that he loved us all hallelujah oh it's beautiful the love of God but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit and the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God so see when we preach on the mysteries of God we're not going too deep as long as we as long as we stay in the word of God as long as we don't add anything to the godhead you know anything outside the Bible as long as we don't add anything to the Jew and Gentile or the baptism of the Holy Ghost as long as we don't add anything in there then we can go as deep as we can in the word of God hallelujah that's right look at that the holy spirit will take you deeper in your walk with God the holy spirit will only take you deeper into you knowing the word of God how many believe that's a how many believe that's a true verse right there the Holy Spirit searches deeper into the things of God like last year or earlier earlier this year when Simon had that Revelation about being re-baptized from Joseph remember that that was a great Revelation why did why was Joseph buried twice it's a type of being re-baptized you don't Simon said that sat on the shelf for what 20 years what the spirit want to do take us deeper in the word of God and that's every time I preach I experience something deeper Hallelujah every time I preach I'm like ah there it is that's I didn't never saw that before Oh that's deeper in the things of God hallelujah see God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God now how many know he's searching you right now how many know he wants to search you today that's right he searches all things he wants to know the condition of every heart here today for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man which is in him so see you're the only one that knows what's in your heart the spirit of man that's in man I don't know what's in Mercy's heart I don't know what's in Jose Patrick I don't know what's in your heart only the spirit of man knows what's in a man right even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so the things of God are so deep they only they only exist in the plan and in the mind and heart and soul of God hallelujah now now we have received ever say now ready now I know you're getting tired I'm trying to close here I use I try to close I think I'm getting closer to my closeth now we have received not the spirit of the world but the the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us right they're just freely given God wants to reveal and and how does he do that if we Su with him if we open the door and let him come in and Su with us he'll Su with us hallelujah if we spend time with God God will reveal these things to us hallelujah a deeper understanding a more appreciation a deeper knowledge of the love of God see because these Corinthians didn't have a deep love of God they were suing each other they were were sleeping around right the they were prideful they had divisions and I'm not talking to you I'm better than you I got more money than you and all these false preachers we just saw all these false preachers mistreating the people doing all kinds of wickedness in the church they had all these problems but Paul said the spirit of God is going to freely give us the truth of the wisdom of God with things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual like even churches there are saying oh we need I heard a church in Georgia say we need to unhitch from the Old Testament that's the last thing we need to do we need uh would an eagle want to unhitch from one of his wings would a husband want to unhitch from his wife no you need both Hallelujah you don't want to it's we need the spirit and Truth we need both Hallelujah there's prophecies we as we said in the Old Testament that are still not fulfilled there's a Rapture Prophecy in the Old Testament Hallelujah see that's man's Wisdom is teaching things outside of the wisdom of God I like this the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned now here's some examples how many know brother Ram said scripture must compare with scripture so brother Ram is basically quoting uh 1 Corinthians 2:13 brother Bram said I know God I know God's moving when a scripture from this book agrees with that book this is how brother knew the spirit was guiding him into deeper things especially with the Seven Seals he said God would show him a vision of like let's say the third the third seal oil and wine he said then I take my concordance and I I look down every time oil and wine is used in the entire Bible which is like 30 or 40 times and he said I compare the revelation of the third seal with the rest of the Bible and as long as they agreed he said I knew that was God now last night we find the first seal went forth the rider so helped me I never knew it before none of these things have I ever known before that's right I just don't go up there and take the Bible and sit down and sit there when it goes to Breaking like that in a vision I just pick up my pen and start writing and just stay there maybe for hours till it gets finished then I go back and I found out as I see where he said I thought well that looks like something I've seen somewhere I get my concordance go back is there something like that and here it is right here and then here it is over here again here it is back here and down there and over here then I just tie it right in I know that's God as long as it's comparing scripture with scripture and what did Paul tell us the spirit of God searches all things and Compares spiritual with spiritual that's the way it has to do just like putting a building together the stones have to fit Stone by Stone scriptures have to fit scripture by scripture now here's some examples like I said the third seal the oil and the wine right we see oil and Zechariah represents the holy spirit and wine right we see those together so we see the Old Testament verses Zechariah agree with Acts chapter 2 it's not a different it's not a disagreement it's anre agreement Hallelujah we see water baptism Matthew 28 uh versus acts 238 they're not in opposition somehow they're in unity Hallelujah and hell they say hell is not Eternal because the smoke ascendeth up forever and ever but the Bible says no murderer has eternal life so forever and ever doesn't mean the same as Eternal scripture has to agree with scripture Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit will take you down to the deep understanding of God's word but I want you to know too brother manam says the enemy tries to impersonate this scripture comparing with scripture right oh yeah I just saw one this week did you know there's people today in the LGB whatever Community they say it's allowed because of Ruth and Naomi because they say see uh when people get married they use uh uh Naomi saying no Ruth saying wherever you die I'll die and what and see see what are they doing it's it's the devil trying to look oh here's a scripture and here's marriage and Ephesians and here's Ruth and we use those together so God must be okay with it what a bunch of trash what about all the other Abomination scriptures see how the devil does that he tries to pull one verse here so see God Compares scripture by scripture but Satan tries him imp person oh yeah the other one was Jonathan and David they had a love for each other greater than women and so see the homosexuals pervert that see that that's the devil he's comparing wrong scriptures those don't go together right because David uh David stood against David had 500 or I'm sorry at least eight wives Hallelujah so it's it's Satan yeah and you have to know you have to rightly divide it by the Holy Spirit brother mam says why we're living in the last days what are we doing about it what are we doing you say well what you done perhaps what the Pharisees done they belong to church and deny Jesus Christ we always say today people try to say we compare we've got to compare Bible in Bible belief scripture was scripture that isn't the truth no it isn't the truth this Greek word means this and that means that the Greek themselves we back in counil Nia and them writers back there they had different forms one believed this way the Greek scholar meant this and the other one said this one meant it this way and they fussed over it we don't need interpretation of Greek Scholars or Greek words okay so there's a balance on this too right there's a balance on this so bam said all the way back in 3:25 at the council in NAA they were arguing about who had the right manuscript right but look at their doctrine that they lived if they were on Constantine side then they agreed with murder so it doesn't matter what you're what you believe about the Greek your your life proves you've got corrupt fruit Hallelujah yesam said to know him is life the person Christ himself not comparing it's a revelation that God built upon his church and if we don't build upon that same church he said the Bible said Abel by faith fath faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation the whole thing is built upon Revelation and unless this is revealed to you Jesus said I thank the father or thank thee father that thou has hid these things from the wise of the world and revealed it unto babes such as we learn see now the whole thing is built there you've got to know the person of Christ and let me show you the balance here I thought I was closer to closing than I I am actually I'm going to skip this here did you know brother Ram would use a few Greek words how many know this a few Greek Greek or Hebrew words and Scholars would come by and say brother Ram you use that Greek word exactly right and brother Ram was not an intelligent man he he that's what he says I think he was intelligent but he wasn't intelligent as the cares of the world right or the training of the world he didn't go to Seminary is what I'm saying yeah like I said he's way smarter than me he could quot all those scriptures and pray for all those sick people he's a million miles Beyond me or any preacher I know probably but brother R was complimented by a scholar on his use of the Greek so he opened up his concordance and he found the right word and then he used that word to help explain the godhead he said I just learned from a little greek scholar sitting here looking at me right now come over from Greece a scholar in Greek and he began to play my tape and he watched the message he said brother brandom I know that you haven't even gotten education but brother randam your words and your message run perfect with the Greek interpretation of the Bible said it's exactly right what you said is exactly right so a Greek scholar who knew Greek heard brother random used a Greek word and said you're exactly right so see how there's a balance people argue about the Greek and then they fuss over the Greek but God led a prophet an uneducated Prophet to interpret the Greek the right way get why because he was spiritual amen he had the mind of Christ Hallelujah he could compare he knows God's not three persons so he can take a Greek he can take the right Greek definition and apply it the right way and get the right Revelation Hallelujah brother raham used Greek to prove his godhead Revelation was from Jesus Philippians 2:7 but God made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men the word form is morphe morphe the form by which a person or thing strikes the vision an external appearance brother Ram was preaching about the godhead and the unveiling of of God he said God changed himself he changes his form Philippians said he took the form of a man now the Greek word there for form I've been looking at all day yesterday think about that all day he was in the Greek a prophet of God was looking at the concordance all day that's what I do some Saturdays thinking trying to think out what it was I come to find out this word am morphe it's spelled e n m o r p h e looking in the Greek to find out what a morphe was I may pronounce that wrong but reason I spell it when if a tape is released a p people will the scholars will know what I me mean by it and when the Amor that means that he changed himself he come down now the Greek word means something that couldn not be seen yet it's there and it changed that the eye can catch it so see it's the external appearance by which it strikes the vision so morphe is the visible image of something and so God took upon himself the image of a servant he said uh I'm going to skip down so what I'm trying to say is that God is always was is here the only thing he done when he become man he changes Mass so now he gives another word for Morp is like putting on a mask we couldn't see God when he was invisible so he put a Morp he put on a mask Allelujah and then this in morphe he changed himself to what he was to what he is or his mask another act Hallelujah and the church said so that's all God did God was in heaven he put on a mask the first mask he put on was the logos right then he created angels and the angels saw him create the Earth right and then he come down and of course we know the other times but he put on the mask of MDC right but he dropped that mask and went back up but then he put on the mask of a little baby infant Hallelujah and that was Emmanuel God With Us Hallelujah but thank God he wasn't done he put on the mask of a glorified body and then he sent back the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and then he stepped behind the veil on the day of Pentecost and now he's behind Peter amen now he's behind Paul now he's behind the Saints now he's behind Mary it's Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah Glory now you're not the fullness but you're a part you're a measure you're a part of God you are genan seed you're a thought of God you're an attribute of God but that part of God is just as much God hallelujah because it's the character it's a spirit of God you're an offspring of God you're a child of God Hallelujah that's what that's what brother man preaches in the Masterpiece and the unveiling of God that God God is now behind the bride Hallelujah because it's Christ in you the hope of glory and didn't Jesus say when you've done it to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me and didn't Jesus say Paul Paul why were you kicking against the my Pricks why were you hurting me right but Paul wasn't hurting the physical body Jesus he was he he was hurting the body he was the people the followers the children of God hallelujah church that's how if we want Unity here if we want Victory here we've got to see each other like that we're children of God God's hiding behind that mask God's hiding behind your Veil is that right that's what we see God and Morp God took on the form of a bride the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah she's a many-membered bride hallelujah amen finishing the chapter I'm going to finish up here I keep saying that but he that is spiritual judges all things oh brother don't judge me I'm told to judge all things and remember we're never judging Eternal destination we can warn them of the Eternal destination right whether it's Eternal Annihilation or eternal life we can warn them of annihilation Eternal judgment is the word I'm sorry Eternal judgment and yes Eternal annihilation yes it'll last eternally but see the Bible said when you're spiritual you can go deeper in the things of God you compare scripture with scripture you compare the Greek word to try to understand does that meaning compareed with all the rest of the scripture and he that spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man see don't let somebody else judge you you know you have to let God judge you God is your judge and the church said Thank God he's my judge he's also my advocate right he's also my attorney Hallelujah he's also My Sacrifice Hallelujah Paul said he's telling these Corinthians don't let anyone judge you right be spiritual compare spiritual things with spiritual things and that's Church in every in every trial or trouble we have we've always got to remember that go back to the word of God what does the word of God say about this Hallelujah that's how you know you can you you that's how you know you're free you're not letting other people judge you you you you yourself go before God and say God you form my heart I have a spirit of a man and I know what's in me and Lord your spirit I want your spirit to go inside of me search out my heart see what's in my life and show me if I'm wrong if I'm wrong correct me Hallelujah but I'm not going to let somebody else judge me I'm not going to let somebody else put me down I'm gonna let Christ judge me Hallelujah who who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him nobody gives God any tips right God don't need your advice God needs your submission and the church said prayers is to change your mind not to change the mind of God I preach on that I I've shown you the quotes on both sides one place brother said you can change the mind of God another place he says you can't so what was those other ones that was God giving people his permissive will okay if you want to go that route you can go but that wasn't my first will that's not what I wanted you to do none of us can instruct God but we have the mind of Christ last slide because our weapons are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and that's the word for complexes the word of God here today is so powerful it can pull down any complex any sin any fear any battle that you're facing the word of God will pull it down Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever and he tells us to cast down any imagination and every High thing that exalts itself against what God's word the knowledge of God says and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ what does Christ one he wants us to obey the word of God let's stand to our feet musicians can come hallelujah how many enjoy chapter 2 I'm I'm blessed I got through it Hallelujah by God's grace I trust you were blessed Hallelujah all glory to God God is so good I love the word of God we're so thankful God give us such a balance by sending us a prophit of God God so humble so humble use of God so mightily yet so humble just like St Paul I just see such a parallel don't you Church see such a parallel between St Paul and brother Brandon what a what a what a tremendous parallel there is there thank God we got the balance of the Holy Spirit praise God let's bow our hearts here if we could bow our heads let's talk to the Lord a little bit here friends as we pray let's remember the scriptures we've heard today God wants to freely give us all things Hallelujah if we're lacking anything in our lives we got to come before the Lord confess any wrong where I've been too lazy or I've tried to do too much we just got to confess our wrong and say Lord I'm trusting you I'm taking you at your word I'm going to wait on you I'm going to believe your promise I'm going to get out of your way I don't want to shove you out of the way I want you to have I want you to be the leader of my life how many know he'll do that by God's grace let's pray today play what a friend we have in Jesus if you would Heavenly Father we just come to you today in the name of Jesus Christ thank you for the scriptures we read today Lord what a refreshment Lord God it's amazing to see the power of God working through Paul in Mighty Miracles but also testifying to the Athens warning them of judgment repentance forgiveness through the resurrection of Jesus Christ Our Lord Oh Lord some believe some mock that's how we are Lord some sometimes we get mocked sometimes we're believed give us Grace to overcome Lord God we thank you Lord for your love today and Father Lord I just pray you take the word that you had me to say Lord God some of these things were in my notes some of them weren't but Lord I just pray Lord whatever was to be planted in the hearts they'd receive it in their hearts the word of God and Lord if anything was watered today I give you praise I give you honor and glory Lord I pray you'll give the people an increase Lord God for the glory of God make us joyful make us obedient Lord Make Us full of unity Lord God make us Overcomers Lord God make us grateful especially at this time of Thanksgiving help us to be thankful Lord For All You've Done Lord Jesus you've been so good for us been better than we deserve Lord as we say many times God you've been so good so faithful as a father pth his children so does the Lord pity us so we thank you God for your love and your mercy God give us Grace Lord to push Satan out of the way Lord get ourselves out of the way Lord God that you can move through our lives for the glory of God I ask it Lord God that you bless the people as we worship and now Lord Also may they water the seed we know preachers can water things but Lord now with our praise we're taught we can water the word that we've heard like Rebecca water the camels that carried her to her bridegroom Hallelujah may we water the word that we've heard that will carry us to meet Jesus in the air Hallelujah when the shout voice and Trump occur Hallelujah Grant it Lord God when the Savior calls we want to be able to hear Lord we want to be able to answer so bless us God as we prepare Lord for this Rapture Lord God let our lives be in tune with your Holy Spirit help us to have the mind of Christ
