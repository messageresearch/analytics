knows as well dear sister told me [Music] because she's crazy [Music] foreign foreign [Music] sometimes we have to walk through these areas six before we sit here God bless you guys okay so uh God did something awesome last Thursday so I recently got my my grandma's wedding ring in and uh she gave it to me so I was gonna put it around like a necklace you know to keep it on me but I didn't have a necklace that would stay on it always falls off so I was wearing it and I've been going to the trails a lot like walking the trails and this one day last Thursday I walked all the way through this Four Mile Trail and then on my way home I realized like or when I got home I realized the ring wasn't on my finger anymore and I felt so bad I was like what kind of grandson I could hear like it's in my head like come on why'd you lose the ring but so anyways though I literally started like thinking I'm like I gotta rely on God I was like I gotta I gotta humbly come to God and like repented some pride and stuff and just go to God and really trust in him you know so because I was like as small as it seems I was a God I know you can't help me find my grandma's drink I feel awful so I woke up the next day determined I was like oh yeah I'm gonna find it like I look good you know hey I'm gonna find it okay guys you know God's Gonna help me find it so I'm walking this Trail you know I go back to the trail and I'm like it's a Four Mile trailer takes like two hours you could do so I'm just scanning back and forth the whole time I was looking for this ring and I just keep I keep telling myself because I kept doubting I'm like awesome I found it you know it's it's over and every time I would think that I would start chanting I would be like it's God's will I'm gonna find it it's God's will I'm gonna find it until I wouldn't feel that doubt anymore and then like halfway through I was just like beating myself up I'm like oh an idiot for doing that and but I like I got on my knees and I started praying to God like really hard like I just started praying like I'm like Lord I was like if there's anything I'm so sorry you know forgive me Lord I don't I don't you know I just wanna I just want you to work through me I was like I know this is an insignificant you know materialistic ring but I was like it means a lot to me you know and I really want to find it I'll I'll just put it in a box until I get a necklace and I'm just really praying I'm like Lord if you don't if it's not your will for me to find it today then I'll fast and pray so you can give it well give me a vision and show me where it is in a vision like I was determined to find it so after that prayer I started feeling a lot better you know and I was just like all right guys will I started to doubt because God's willing to find it and I get to the end and I'm like by the end of it I'm like okay I don't even care anymore so I still get the season happens so it's okay but I get to the very end and then I'm walking and I walk into this Plaza sitting on sitting on the ground right so so I literally picked it up and I went outside and I started jumping I was like thank you God I was like yeah I was like hey man like it was it was it was the craziest it may be like a small story but like to me it was great I felt like like a Bible that was in a Bible verse like I was just like my God I was fighting doubt but then like God was like oh I'm really trusting in God this time and I really I ever found it sitting it was sitting in the public area too where all the people walked so had been God yeah so that that's the uh that happened last Thursday so I didn't like so excited since that so it was awesome thanking God why how far he's brought hair like she's 70 years that's a lot and then to think of the fact that she's not I don't even remember I don't even remember how she ever like getting taken in bed for a long time maybe it's just like a headache and then she's she's all about doing everything she has to do so and she came here like the whole time she's never been sick or anything like that so we are so thankful so so thankful we are going to sing in our Ghanaian song you're going to sing again song today and I'm gonna say what it means it's safe for how far you've brought me your Praises will never cease your Praises will never cease God of Grace what song can we sing

one more there's a name that's written in glory and it's mine Hallelujah listening that by God's grace that's the role we're talking about the Lamb's Book of Life how many believe your name is there well then you ought to have more rejoicing that your name's there than you can do a miracle or you could do any any certain thing down here you ought to have more rejoicing Jesus said that your name is risen in heaven praise God how many different toys we're gonna get me started Magic [Music] alone [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] energy today [Music] Glory [Music] days [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] thank you Jesus praise God get your Bibles out here let's go to Acts chapter two Hallelujah you like to preach on I will pour out my spirit part three by God's grace it's good to be with you in the House of Lords seems like it's been a long time since I preached so I kind of feel like a rookie again today Acts chapter 2 by God's grace verse 4 Acts chapter 2 verse 4. you know we've had some wonderful Ministry I'm so thankful the Lord sent brother Ben and then brother Simon you know we just had some wonderful Ministry pardon me um it was just something I love about both of their ministries of course all these brothers that come through here we're so blessed to have men that can yield to the Holy Ghost praise God that's just wonderful to have that the brother Ben took us deep down into some you know mind battles we might have and showed us how we can overcome those by God's grace by surrender how many still surrendering today a week later are you still surrendered absolutely Hallelujah Simon showed us how God's with us through the valleys we can't live on the mountain thank God for the mountain but God is going to walk with us through the valley praise God all the way through thank God I'm glad he doesn't leave us you know some some at some point in the valley I'm glad he goes more than halfway with us I'm glad he goes all the way through with me to praise God because I need somebody to walk with me praise God I can't do it alone I need the Lord Jesus Christ Acts chapter 2 verse 4. well look at that I will pour out my spirit here part three by God's Great I'm going to believe he pours out his Spirit still saith God it's such a beautiful promise God promised to pour out his Spirit he didn't say when he just said upon All Flesh and he said in the last days so we met already two conditions we're in flesh and we're in the last days Hallelujah now we're just waiting on the right timing praise God hallelujah and you know of course we've had the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is God's pouring out his Spirit but then we know we need revivals praise God when your revivals of our minds and we need uh we need church revivals praise God we just we need Revival Hallelujah thank God so let's go to Acts 2 verse 4. let's read that verse 4 1 2 3 and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now turn if you would to verse 15 I'll read 15. for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it as but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel let's all read verse 17 if we can one two three and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams amen let's have one more word of prayer how many want God to minister to them today by God's grace just show it maybe with the uplifting of hand or about heart let's pray together father God we're so thankful our names are written in heaven Lord God and Lord we're told in the Bible it was before the world was founded before it found its resting place our names were already in heaven Lord what a blessing Hallelujah Saints for the last two thousand years have rejoiced in this truth Lord God and we join them today Lord we're doing Lord our service here to worship and love you and Lord we are trusting in those same promises is that they've trusted Lord they trusted those promises as they were fed to Lions dear God they trust in those promises as as their their boats sank or as they went to The Chopping Block Lord to be beheaded they trust in these same promises God help us in the midst of our light afflictions dear God that we will trust your promises Lord God hallelujah we're so grateful Lord Jesus for all you've done Lord God and we know the Same Spirit the same holy ghost that minister to those early Saints will be with us today in the midst of our trials Lord God and you promise to pour out your spirit Lord God so we are looking to that God for those of us that have received that we're rejoicing in that but we need more of your spirit dear God we need more of your blessings to be poured out on us Lord God hallelujah we want pure Minds God we want pure hearts Lord God we want a testimony that pleases you Lord Jesus we want to be led by the spirit because we are the sons and daughters of God we can see that Lord God over all these years over these these lives we've lived Lord God we can see we are the sons and daughters of God you've proved it to us and Lord we just want to keep walking pleasing to you so Lord pour out your spirit that we can continue to walk into your promises we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so I want to continue with it uh continue on this little thought you know we've been looking a lot of history you know from Zoo's history I guess I'll go back here and just show some of these pictures again and then I'll just kind of skip forward I don't know if Emma's been here have you been here on I don't know if Emma's seen all the pictures there but William Seymour so this is the the black brother who preached uh the beginning of this revival the Legacy in churches think about that the laodicean church they started with one man who is so hungry for God we're going to see his exact quote in a minute but just a humble man this is the I couldn't see out of his left eye you can see it's a little bit different than his right eye I think he had polio and he lost the sight in his left eye he only had one eye now I think about that he has less eyes he had less eyes than we have to read the Bible and God still poured out the spirit in his life praise God he didn't have he didn't have all the natural blessings that we have praise God but he had one thing that we need more of and that's a hunger for God hallelujah and so we want to also uh just show you know here's the humble building it was just a 40 by 60 building a very humble building there's another look at it there's brother Seymour there at the front uh and I don't know if there had other ones oh yeah there's his wife Jenny Jenny was filled with the Holy Ghost that first night it fell I believe it was April 4th if I'm not mistaken 1906 and then uh there's a there's a there's the first house it fell in look at this humble little house and I can drive down some Akron streets I can see the houses that look a lot like this is this some mansion uh you know is this some Mansion or is this some beautiful edifice like Solomon's Temple it's just a humble home it was so humble after just three days of meetings this porch collapsed because it couldn't hold all the shouting jumping worshipers praise God the people that were glorifying the Lord so it's it's a beautiful story and we want to return to how many want to return to Our Roots praise God this is our Roots this is the beginning of the church age praise God brother Adam said as we'll see this is the second greatest pouring out of the spirit since the day of Pentecost so let's get up here now I want to look at more details I'm just going to pull a few details from this book you know sister Wendy actually gave me this book and it's been sitting on my shelf for years and years and years I knew there was a time in season four praise God and so I read through the the first portion you know uh the reason I'm not going to read through the second portion is because because it goes through like Oral Roberts and and you know now it says like TD Jakes is now one of these uh beneficiaries of the zuza street now myself I differ with that I want to respect all men and women but I don't really believe the Holy Ghost is truly a hundred percent in his ministry but of course I can name anyone Joel Steen or even John MacArthur who's a very sound Bible teacher but I don't believe they're fully yield to the Holy Ghost I don't believe they have the Revival I believe we've got the Revival praise God how do I know because it lines up with God's word amen just like Jesus said Jesus said they'll rise many false christs false anointed ones and show many signs and brother random I just listened to brother man yesterday he he said he said well how can we know brother they said brother how can we know if they have if they have Miracles if they have the dead Rays if they have all these things how can we know brother Adam said he said you got to look for the thus saith the Lord in the Bible Hallelujah so every time Church there's a question every time there's uh something we must know or understand we've got to look in the Bible Church we've got to stay in the Bible how many how many excited to say in the Bible praise God you have to stay in the Bible anytime we step out we're on Dangerous Grounds like brother Randolph said uh he said God can do things out of the Bible like God cannot be limited to just this Bible right because he's outside of time and he's outside a paper and he's greater than the paper he's greater than the ink he said but for me he said I just want to stay with what I know is in this Bible praise God because I know God he will do things according to this Bible Hallelujah he can do things outside of it we don't want to limit God to that uh even so much where brother Brandon originally thought in the 1960s or 1960 brother Ram thought there were seals inside the book and outside the book brother and thought that but then the Holy Spirit quickened him on the unveiling of God in 1964. he said I always thought there was seals inside and outside he said but then I realized it can't be outside the book he said because you can't add one thing or take one thing away from this word praise God my brother man was looking at one time he thought there was going to be seals and Revelations that are outside the Bible but he said if God did that he would contradict what he already wrote in the Bible what a consolation to us church if we can just stay in the word of God hallelujah if we can just keep feeding on the word of God then we shall not be deceived amen amen amen now here's what I thought I had this week just a simple very very simple thought how many know that the Bible says the elect cannot be deceived the elect cannot be deceived but this doesn't mean that we won't get deceived like in a mistake that we make so I just want to make sure this is a fresh thought I hadn't preached it before because look at Peter Peter got the Holy Ghost he started on fire but then he got deceived by his spirit of fear he let fear deceive him into not fellowshipping with gentiles right fear he was afraid of the Jewish teachers now maybe some of you have never experienced that fear before but peer pressure is a real thing you know I really never felt a lot of peer pressure so I sat around a bunch of message preachers and everybody's asking what do you believe in what are you thinking well I think this and I think that and everybody turns and it seems like they all look at you right at you all the faces in the crowd turn right at you and so it seems like maybe Peter come under that he's a man filled with the Holy Ghost Church he could say I've got thus saith the Lord I've got the Keys of the Kingdom but because of a few preachers looking at him and what do you think are the Jews more holy than the Gentiles well yeah actually you know we we actually are more holy so I'm not going to eat with the Gentiles and so God has to send this Prophet all the way across however however many miles and brother Adam said put a finger under his nose and said you're the one to be blamed preacher you men of God who walked on water you man of God who's got the Keys of the Kingdom you're the one to be blamed because you're honoring some brethren above the other let's honor all men praise God let's honor our Sisters Let's honor our children let's honor the elderly let's honor the young let's honor everybody with the same love praise God but notice church he was deceived in that in that in that space of time but God was gracious what that means is they won't be deceived into being lost that's what that means the elect cannot be deceived into being lost right so what a consolation we know God started our Salvation he's going to continue our Salvation he's going to finish and we're going to receive the end of our salvation Hallelujah I hope that was a help to somebody when you look at you know we are we are elect we that means we are chosen we're chosen before the foundation World we're chosen to salvation but we are going to be deceived we are going to have little mistakes in some minor areas right but God's grace he's going to send somebody to bring us back in line amen now specifically I don't want a preacher to come put his finger under my nose publicly I'd rather have it in private right but but Peter Peter got it publicly and Peter Paul said you're the one to be blamed so church we got to be humble and realize at some point the blame is going to be on us but we got to be humble enough to accept it praise God Hallelujah it was my fault imagine Peter getting up there and said you know Saints I'm sorry are the Keys of the Kingdom I'm sorry after church you know I'm sorry I I I I I I I walled off the Jews and Gentiles over there in the fellowship hall I'm sorry about that right because that's what he had he had a fellowship hall and he he only had Jews on one side and Gentiles on the other I'm so glad I could sit right next to brother amen I can sit right next to Sister Beatrice and her family right there's no walls dividing us praise God all the walls all the discrimination are all all of any any evil thoughts it's all been taken away by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we got to be careful I'm Gonna Knock this off like I did last week amen I don't know I don't know I didn't know that was a punching bag all these years you see the blood of Christ does that now look and that proves church we all need a fresh sanctification amen we all need a fresh Revival sometimes amen a man of God like Peter who knew Jesus he saw him resurrected he saw him in a glorified body he saw Jesus create fish and have fish burning there and bread right there when you come in from the the fishing and he said my Lord and my God you know he saw right there he saw Jesus do that and yet he could get so deceived where he would not eat with Jews or Gentiles anymore so we've got to Humble ourselves Church we've got to make sure that we're willing to be corrected because I say like this we've got to be willing for God more of God's spirit to be poured out on us amen and so see you know and we got to remember God's spirit being poured out is not always what is it's not always going to be shouting it's not always going to be praising God sometimes it's going to be you on your face apologizing before God that's God's spirit on us and the church said it's not always to me running around the church or it's always going to be jumping or shouting or speaking in tongues or glorifying God or God in America sometimes it's going to be I'm saying I'm the one that should be blamed Hallelujah that I'm willing to say I'm sorry because it was my fault of course that's what we need remember that fourth ground that good heart was called just good and honest that's what we need honest message Christians praise God honest Christians that's what we need today so I just want to that wasn't really my notes I felt I might say that as I was thinking about it but remember just because you're elect doesn't mean you're going to be perfect because you're elect there's nothing going to separate you from the love of Christ hallelujah amen that's what I mean I'm chosen to ultimately receive salvation I'm chosen to go to heaven I'm chosen to be with Jesus for eternity praise God that doesn't mean I'm not going to have stumbling stones on there or stumbling blocks on the way here doesn't mean I'm I'm going to be totally blameless my whole life and that's something Peter's one that said be blameless too Paul laid out Paul laid out the requirements for a bishop a preacher and a pastor and he said blameless so there you go there's a good balance that never came to me till just now teachers in other words we don't have to be spotless we don't have to be perfect God knows we're going to fall short but we should be striving to be perfect we should be willing to be corrected by the Holy Spirit that's right Paul said the bishop must be blameless well here's Peter a bishop and he's the one to be blamed church I today I'm trusting in the grace of God praise the Lord his Mercy's more brother amen praise God his Mercy is greater than my sins Hallelujah see we're in other words like as a pastor I'm striving to be hospitable I'm striving to be blameless but sometimes I'm not hospitable sometimes I'm not blameless right sometimes I fall short of God's glory sometimes I'm not apt to teach sometimes I forget the answers to some of these questions you guys ask and you ask some good questions sometimes I can't answer I need to well can somebody help me out there can somebody give me a I can't I'm not real fresh on that question anymore see we're gonna fall short but the grace of God because I have this the spirit of God is going to be poured on us afresh to have a fresh start amen Glory now let me get to this here um I'm not even not even halfway through sharing some of the things just in this book I made it through most of the other book that I preached but just just a background remember this revival in Los Angeles started because there had been previous revivals in the late 1800s there's a Revival in Kansas I'm not mistaken and then in 1904 there was a Revival in Wales through Evan Roberts and I got his journal over there I read it years ago I'm going to read it again by God's grace and learn about Revival again because we need Revival praise God we want God to pour out his Spirit praise God church I found this I think you found it too the happiest moments of Our Lives when we're is when we're really seeking God praise God those are the happiest moments like think about like we looked at you know remember I preach on the glory and the Wonder I entered the service without a couple Wednesdays ago see what what do we always desire oh I wish I could go back and live that again those those wonderful moments what was in those moments it was just a pure heart seeking God it was just God visiting you it was God anointing you praise God it was God helping you it was God strengthening you so Lord give me that again once more Lord can we pray like Samson today amen give me some more moments where we're really seeking God hallelujah when I'm really down to business with God whatever you got to do God get me to a spot where I'm desperate for you and I know when I'm desperate when I see God with all my heart I know God said You shall find me Hallelujah those are those moments and George I found too when God does those things I don't even realize this is one of those red letter days until later I'm like oh man that was one of the greatest days you know I had a like I'm sure Austin probably feels that way about last Thursday or two Thursdays ago he's rejoicing it I found it reminds me that woman that found the coin brother she said neighbors come and rejoice I had a coin it was lost but now it's found amen that's a type of win in a soul brother hallelujah praise God and so this this revival it happened in in Wales in England and uh the the people in the United States heard about it so they sent ambassadors over to meet Evan Roberts and they come back and they said the way to Revival is Cottage prayer meetings prayer meetings just home prayer meetings in other words just say like this just praying more at home now is God a god of confusion or is God a god of simplicity and that's just that's all they did they went over there in 1904 they come back and for two years they just prayed God sent us Revival and specifically preachers in Los Angeles we're praying God sent us Revival God sent it like you did in Wales there and God did more than that God did exceedingly abundantly above above what he did in Wales praise God because they prayed for two years going into it oh it's a beautiful testimony praise God I think of this too all those years you know growing up you know my dad and mom were divorced but every night my mom I don't know how she did all by herself she would Wrangle up six kids now I got eight kids and my wife and I to try to get you know there's some nights where it's like where's where's so and so where's so and so right where we got to get all these kids in here for Bible time we've been waiting five minutes where's ever we've been waiting 10 minutes right for about where are all these kids at well my mom was able to Rally them all around every night sometimes later than other nights sometimes we weren't all happy but think about that for all those years for 19 years of my life my mom prayed uh God saved Jesse's Soul she said you know being a single mother the only prayer she had the only strength for prayer that she had was Lord save my children that was all she could pray for after all the pressure of washing dishes cooking three meals a day for six kids trying to work a side job to make some money all by yourself with no husband she said all the strengths she had at the end of the day was to pray Lord save my children Church whatever you got at the end of the day give it to Jesus if all you can say is Lord Jesus send me the Holy Ghost then you pray that praise God amen whatever you got just pray what you got but for 19 years she prayed for all these children to get saved and then thankfully on two in 1999 or 2000 this this old sinner named Jesse Smith went to the conference and got saved and my mother's prayer of 19 years was answered Hallelujah we got to be willing to pray we've got to be willing to wait we've got to be willing to believe God hears our prayers amen got to be willing to wait I remember for years I was going to Lydia Malachi's bunk beds when they were I waited you know I'd kiss him good night and say good night and then I sneaked back in there and I Lay My Hands on and I remember looking up to the top bunk I said in the name of Jesus Christ Phil Lydia with the Holy Ghost In The Name of Jesus Christ Bill Malachi now I laid my hands on Acacia filled them with the Holy Ghost now don't do that as much anymore because I'm tired and old and I forget but I have done that recently a few weeks ago I went in there and I laid my hands on on Haven and Garrison and Acacia sorry uh Nick Haven yeah nature of nature sorry Haven Victoria I'm trying to go too fast Genevieve I've laid my hands on Zion a number of times in the name of Jesus Christ save his soul one time he was up he followed me up to the altar he's praying up here and I was praying God filled with the Holy Ghost he just comes up here he wants to be like Daddy that's one thing I want to I want him to follow that that example not my bad examples at home or other places praise God but think about that if my mom or your parents were able to pray all those years then church surely we can join and we can join the faith and pray and ask God to save the souls Hallelujah of our family of our friends praise God let's have real Faith praise God that's my love when Austin shares that testimony if you've got to fire your testimony come up here and share because that's going to search somebody up to keep praying praise God that's going to serve somebody out the next time you know we lose something let's remember Austin's prayer I know the children will bring it up because they're really good at remembering that because when I forget all the things that you're like Daddy we should pray yeah that's right why didn't I think of that you know I'm in the midst of these trials I'm going through these these battles see the next time we need something that's going to stir somebody up remember God was faithful to brother Austin God is faithful to us God will answer prayer God is here God cares God Longs God wants Fellowship praise God amen well they prayed for two years for Revival it was a beautiful story they go from church to church here's a few details now what did I do okay that was from the last time oh I didn't get to where I was today's lesson here it is okay yeah before I move on remember Brother Anderson God's provided them one of the greatest revivals this nation has ever known so brother says the uh the Seymour Azusa Street Revival is greater than Charles spurgeon's Revival Calvin Knox great reformers even Luther think about that Luther came out of the Catholic church and he denied transubstantiation he stood against it even when he would have got arrested now Seymour was never on the brink of being arrested as far as I know he lived out his whole life died at 52. but Luther stood up was willing to die was going to be arrested and and killed but this revival was greater Azusa Street Revival see Luther was a time of reformation but here in Azusa this is a time of restoration amen Hallelujah he says it's the greatest thing that struck the Earth since the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost so church that little house on Bonnie Bray Street that's the closest thing to the upper room that the world's ever seen praise God think about that greatest thing the world's ever seen since Pentecost happened in a small little tiny house has a porch on the front maybe had one or two rooms in there in 1906 did they have running water in the houses I don't know did they have plumbers in 1906. we got an assignment cam no no don't know about Plumbing they'll know the history of Plumbing I think they sold out houses if I'm not mistaken brother Jose I'm not mistaken and here God pours out the second greatest Revival ever been done because somebody got devoted to prayer and so we need to be church we need God to guide us into devoted prayer praise God and again it don't have to be five hours a day but it has to be a hunger for God that's what it has to be no just notice here again God poured out his spirit in dilapidated old houses and buildings now we're fortunate we got a new carpet three years ago when it flooded remember that when it flooded we got new carpet the chairs are from 2015. about eight years old now you know got fresh paint there also did a good job painting out there for us it's about two years old you know we got we got nice things but having nice things is is okay but it's not a requirement for God's spirit to come I didn't get there but I'm gonna go read a little bit more Church those people in Azusa Street and that building they would lay on dirty old floors they're not perfectly tiled it wasn't nice carpet it was a dirty floor dirt on the floor and they'd be willing to get on their knees in their Sunday best they get on their knees and pray and seek for more of God whether they're getting saved or whether they're getting the holy ghost or whether they're getting Sanctified whether they're praying for their their mom to be saved or their dad to be saved they were willing to seek God and God honored it as the second greatest pouring out praise God oh my God used the unknown humble one-eyed black preacher one item in a world ruled by white men God bypassed the white man and went to a black man right we're talking this is Henry fordtime the first millionaire with the automobile they said you got a million dollars what do you want now 2 million the eyes are never the lust of the eyes are never satisfied look he Henry Ford was working on on the automotive he was working on the spiritual and and Seymour was working on the spiritual praise God oh my look at that two men two great men at the turn of the century who I want to ask you who is great in God's eyes was it the smart businessman I mean I thank God for the cars you guys got to the Revival back or the yeah it might be a Revival the youth meeting him back I thank God for that but what was more beneficial for society it was Seymour amen the man that was seeking God the one-eyed man who believed God's word and just preached God's word let's believe God's word let's preach God's word let's pray for God's word to come to pass amen let's keep praying for God's word to come to pass don't ever give up on God his timing is perfect praise God church this is you know in that book it estimated right now there are 600 million people on Earth right now just 600 million that have say they're they're influenced by Azusa Street and listen church I'm one of them I'm one of them that meeting brought forth FF Bosworth who meet met brother Branham amen remember that how we can tie our lineage all the way there we are connected to there praise God we're connected and that's just 600 million alive today what have all what about all the means that have died there's probably a billion or more people all impacted and I'll say like this there are billions of people that will answer for what God did at Azusa Street praise God whether they accept it or reject it thank God we can accept it Hallelujah thank God we can enjoy blessings that come from Azusa because people hungered after God people believe God still pours out his fear hallelujah oh he still does it today praise God I think it's okay if lean if I just share this testimony but the last time I preached this on a Wednesday night I was preaching that verse Acts 2 17. what happens when you pour out the spirit you get prophecy visions and dreams that's what the Bible says and just as a small testimony sister Lena had a really spiritual dream and brother also thought maybe this was something she had to obey right it's probably something she has to obey God wants her to do and God's given her a I say a warning and a blessing a warning and a blessing just days after I preached that this is what the Holy Ghost does that's what the Bible says your sons and your daughters should prophesy your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams on my servants and on my handmaidens like Lena I'll pour out my spirit in the days of my spirit amen hallelujah praise God like brother Jesse amen like brother Jose amen God will pour out a spirit on his sons and his daughters your son your daughter God will pour out a spirit on you praise God Hallelujah but let's be open to how it's going to come praise God how do you don't have to come as they were seeking initial evidence initial evidence it may not come that way not all speak with tongues not all are Apostles not all have gifts of healings but I got something thank God I might not have it all but I got something hallelujah amen thank God I got something Hallelujah if God pours out his Spirit on me something's going to happen I'm going to share this about sister Zur here but just be an encouragement to her when she first came in the message sister Karen Sanders from Lima was looking at or I'm sorry sister and I got the email did I share it with sir sister Karen Sanders and you met her at the Emma's graduation party you might have met her she had the glasses and she's an older black lady sweet sweet sister she's prophesied right in front of me on numerous occasions and I've seen all of them come to pass when she was sitting down there we were fellowshipping and she'd come to Akron to visit us and Sir walked by her and sir and and sister Karen turned to Simon said who is that girl she said the spirit of God is upon her and she said she has gifts that God wants to use amongst the people praise God now church does that line up with scripture yes your sons and your daughters does that line with the scripture the Bible said every man is given a gift to profit the body of Christ so we know she has at least one gift right but Karen thinks maybe numerous gifts well how do you operate gifts you got to be sincere like like brother mayor said to operate a gift you got to be consecrated to the spirit that means obedience that's what Evan Roberts says he said there's three things to do for the spirit of God to flow obedience get ready for the second obedience get ready for the third obedience we gotta obey God instead of obeying the flesh Hallelujah amen if any good comes out of my life if any good gift is ever used in my life whether it's teaching or Divine Healing or discernment or wisdom or whatever be it would only be God it's only because I finally obeyed God hallelujah because you and I finally obeyed God what was it that was the Holy Spirit telling sister Karen I'm going to pour out my spirit on sisters there you go hallelujah how many glad God has poured his Spirit out on you for some time but I'm not done I'm still here that means I need more Hallelujah I've got it done with me yet praise God gets done with me and we either the Rapture will come or we're all stand around my casket you all stand there on my casket but I won't be there I'll be in heaven I don't know you can stand around there all you want praise God I'm Gonna Be With Jesus I'm gonna be with the Saints of moon hopefully one person runs to me saying my precious brother remember I know my grandpa'll be there praise God Amen Hallelujah hopefully somebody runs to me and said my precious brother hallelujah thank God Amen church is always going to come to the humble the pouring out of the spirit is always going to come to Humble people and God help us to be humble praise God remain humble here's a direct quote he said such a hunger to have more of God now this wasn't legalism he didn't say such a hunger I had so I didn't feel like I was lost such a hunger I had to make sure to feel like I had uh I had I had done enough to deserve this I'd reached my uh my quota on the number of times I had to pray he just he fell in love with God he just wanted to see God move such you're hungry to have more of God was in my heart that I prayed for five hours a day for two and a half years hunger every time we want to hunger like that I want to hunger like that we're in the most deceptive age it's not the darkest age that was the Dark Ages but we're in the most deceptive age where deception is all around us it's all around us and then we have all these uh cares of life right all the cares of the world all these battles mind battles like crazy we have all these things but I'm sure in some way Church don't you think some in some way in 1906 don't you think he had mind battles too don't you think's in some way you know he had struggles as well well first thing he didn't have a job he was a beggar he was basically a beggar bumming off these guys living in their house basically right the banker the uh the the the the teller the the his friend there where he was staying was a teller at the bank and he lived with the teller and he'd be the one praying he'd be the one seeking God well I just heard brother Adam say it last night brother I said if a man that got the Holy Ghost he don't care if you have to beg for his food or work for his food he said he don't care because he's got the kingdom of God he's going to you don't care if he has to beg for his food now to me I'd be ashamed to beg because of the conditions I've lived in right I don't want to beg I don't ask for money but brother Adam said and that's just like the beggar I just like the beggar in the story of Jesus and the rich man the Beggars begging can I have crumbs can I have crumbs see so when you're born again God wants us to focus on heaven God wants us to set our desires on Heaven praise God not so much on Earth but God wants us to be concerned about heaven that's why we just praying all the time because he was concerned about heaven amen Hallelujah he was locked out of that first church the woman Pastor I forget her name now Lucy I think it was invited him to come out and preach his message on tongues but then after he preached for about a week they locked him out it's a perfect type of Jesus being locked out of the church right I imagine he went out for lunch he come back in I don't know who paid for his lunch but he come back in I'm expecting to preach oh and the door was locked the pre the new preacher is locked out of his new church what a honeymoon what a honeymoon with the congregation right well that lasted about one week thank God what a honeymoon well I'll say like this I'm I believe that Seymour could feel what Jesus feels like right Jesus is on the outside of the church he's trying to get in let me in let me in let me in I said let me just be honest every service Jesus wants to get in our service right we either get closer to God every service or further away right every service Jesus wants to come in if we let him come in let's let him rush in amen praise God Hallelujah let's let him Rush In in other words what does he want to accomplish today well many times we know that through the preaching or also it could be someone after service who feels led to go pray for somebody or speak a word to somebody Hallelujah see and that's what we'll get to here at the a little bit further here Seymour this is his quote I prayed to God to give what parnam preached even though he didn't have it who's praying God give me that the real Holy Ghost and Fire with tongues and love and power of God like the apostles had now church this is what we can pray we can say I prayed to God to give me what brother Branham preached right the real Holy Ghost and Fire with tongues and all nine gifts of the Spirit amen and love and let me have what the apostles had amen make us such a reality make it real make it so real that all I want to do is talk about Jesus that people can see Jesus flowing through my life praise God I want a reality today praise God that should be our desire today give me a reality of God once the Holy Ghost fell they shouted for three days and three nights that's what the history said and it was Easter season the Holy Ghost fell right at the resurrection as the people came in they would fall under God's power the sick we're healed and sinners were saved just as they come in people would just come in and they just fall down you know the people would already be praying there and then they would just fall down and they would join in the prayer get saved get healed what a powerful move of God hallelujah thank you Jesus this is a this is a powerful testimony the second greatest second greatest nothing now let's compare that to the Pentecost Peter gets up there and he says we're not drunk this is what Joel spoke of and what followed that 3 000 baptisms amen how many people did Paul did Peter baptize that day Peter baptized all of them maybe baptize a couple hundred or something like that three thousand baptisms so people would just flood in that's kind of what was that's kind of what it was as Azusa they would flooded and get saved on the day of Pentecost they'd flooded and get baptized praise God it just wave after wave after wave people being baptized all these people flowing in and they cause such a trouble that they didn't have enough food to feed the people and then oh and then there come the first the first Ascension was these people are getting food and we're not getting food that's the first Ascension early church because sometimes we want numbers but sometimes we don't understand what goes along with big numbers well either way that was going to battle us right so we gotta we got to be Warriors whether we're a big church or small church God chose to be small for this season perhaps forever but we got to be faithful with what God has called us to do if he's if we're favored with little God will make us ruler over much praise God Hallelujah now Church did you know this building was previously a stable where was Jesus born in a stable it's a beautiful type Church that that second place we rented on Mo Drive I don't know brother Jose ever come there observer's there remember when we used to meet in that Mojo and had the garage door on the back that was an old wine cellar and how many wonderful Services did we have in that old wine cellar how many times did the wine of God flow out upon us amen ah that's a beautiful type praise God now this was formally for car parts I don't know the type there but brother Adam said you got to have Dynamics and mechanics to make the car run so I just believe we got all of it praise God Amen yeah I remember when I first walked in that Fellowship room there there was uh there was Auto signs certain name brands I forget the names and they had Mufflers in there and all these things like huh Auto Parts huh interesting a place for Auto Parts well God takes all those pieces and he puts them together and he gets some electricity and and some some gasoline and he fires it up and then an automobile can drive may God help us to have mechanics and Dynamics so this bride can drive into the heavens praise God driving to the Rapture praise God now that's just fun just to kind of type it out a little bit but that was literally a horse stable Azusa Street was a horse stable and Jesus was born and stable it was also a warehouse and Solomon's Temple included a storehouse all the treasures Hallelujah Heinz celebrates over to Old Auto automobile automobile Place praise God you know Perry Green's first church was a Jewish Church and brother Branham like it unto the uh the Jews giving to the Gentiles well and brother man like it unto the Holy Ghost was on the Gentiles and they're going to eventually give it back to the Jews liked it like under like that so there could be types here in our buildings but what a beautiful what a beautiful type that was this building formerly would hold you know animal babies being born but now greater than animal babies it's my sons and my daughters amen hallelujah the horses would be named but instead of Nang now they're praising God and speaking in tongues Hallelujah glory to God what a beautiful type now I just got a few more slides I want to get into a different thought here to kind of finish with their services were totally spontaneous they had no order they did not pre-announce events like some of you might have been surprised on Wednesday when Simon came I think I forgot to announce it but that's how all their services were everything was a surprise you never knew it was going to happen there are no special choirs right there's nothing wrong with that the Holy Ghost can follow when choirs sing right we know that they had no special singers or well-known evangelists he spent his time in prayer and he'd wait on God with his head in an empty shoebox you just wait on God and when the time came he would preach but the main thing about all the services was prayer it consumed all the participants the whole place was steeped in prayer you ever had a tea bag you got to steep it in the hot water right my wife tells me let it sit in there for 15 minutes then everything I want out of there will get into the water can go into me I can heal my throat but you got to steepener it's got to lay in the hot water sure sometimes we got to lay in prayer the lady is going to let it steep let it sit there sit there and pray don't give up after five minutes my Father in heaven Hallowed Be Your Name ah what's on Instagram now is that being steeped in prayer that's deep in your cell phone we all got them but we can't be steeped in those things they were steep in prayer they didn't quit after a few minutes they just stayed in prayer how many uh how many uh just recently or in the last few months have you stayed after from prayer or prayed before and you felt refreshed after the prayer this is God's way this is God's way to stay fresh or to refreshing yourself in the presence of God steep in prayer if you're I'll say like this if we're not getting much time a prayer at home then at least pray here at least pray here at least get some steeping here praise God if you can't Steep and what happens when when it Steeps right all the good things come out well Glory when you're when you are steeped in prayer all the good things are going to come out of your mouth praise God Hallelujah instead of all the jokes and the nonsense and the the bitterness and the whatever negativity when you lay in God's presence blessings are going to come out Hallelujah Praises are going to come out but the thing is you got to stay steep in the hot water of God's word amen I didn't know I was going to preach on T today praise God I sure like kombucha but that's a different kind of a tea different uh way to outbreak tea I guess or use tea anybody can testify at any time sometimes the spirit would fall right away and people would rush to the altar to either seek God get saved intercede get healed they simply prayed and God did the rest yeah that should be did did the rest so that was their testimony of all these years of Revival they just prayed and let God move now Church there's nothing wrong just you know there's nothing wrong with having an order for the service because look how God honored brother Branham brother man found the order in Joshua 6 right praise praise God first then the word comes right and then the battle brother random says and then all the armed soldiers right there's nothing wrong with that look how God honored him right so nothing wrong with order I'm not saying hey we need to change our our services but I do want to say this at the end of service we should have a lot of sponsors we should have that's a time for spontaneous things to happen like I might invite you up to have some group prayer or might invite people up to the altar I might have a call a prayer line right and we know these things but God's got to be in it praise God we've got to be moved by the spirit to get into that praise God that's the thing that they had they would pray so long until they were led by God to do something praise God that's what I want to do I want to pray so long so I feel led to preach a sermon I want to pray so long as I feel led to reach out and text a brother or sister I want to pray so long until I know this is the decision I got to make coming up I'm going to pray so long till I know the right decision to make praise God let's be steeped in prayer so people can taste the so God can taste the blessings on our lives the Bible says the Bible says our prayers our sweet smelling savior unto God Hallelujah now uh yeah I want to get to here I want to just work my way to close with it with these quotes here in a few scriptures by God's grace uh yesterday I was listening to questions answers and I got I was searching for some quotes and I found this it's a really beautiful quote brother man preach on what is the Holy Ghost now I know Church we've had numerous people seeking the Holy Ghost we have at least five or more people seeking the Holy Ghost in our church praise God maybe more maybe more and church I'm saying I'm seeking more of God brother man said uh I just heard him say yesterday he said I he said he said I believe he said my name's written there he said but he said if I don't have what Paul had he said I'm going to keep this until that comes right what I have now has led me safely these 23 years praise God it's kept me from sin it's kept me out of the the the world the garbage dumps of Hell in the world what I've had has made me a real a real Christian praise God but if I don't have all of it I want more praise God amen that ought to be every one of our desires praise God then church those of us that say we got it we ought to pray until somebody else gets it praise God if we're such good examples which we ought to be if we're if we're if it's not if we're a real weathered and mature Christians brother Brandon said we're not fresh recruits anymore right I've said that before look up that fresh record we're not I mean we have we have some new Christians in here but some of us have been around going on decades then brother William say he had over 40 years in the message if I wasn't mistaken over 40 years the message I know uh Brother Ray has over 40 years the message we're not fresh recruits anymore we should we should be uh able to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit and and yield and ask God to direct us to be a blessing to somebody else amen amen and I know he does the church I know he doesn't like we gave the example with Lydia going through that mind battle and Naomi and Beatrice and and Hua prayed for her and set her free that's what I'm talking about that's what I'm talking about right there when there's a need that the Saints Glory they feel light of the Holy Spirit they're led by the spirit of God and God's children are set free Hallelujah amen now now brother Adam just reads through a few of these verses now this is going to be good for all those young Christians but of course a good reminder for all of us who are have a few more years serving God now let's go to Luke 24 49 brother Brandon says brother Ram reads this I'm going to read it there out of the Bible Luke 24 49. brother Bram uh he's basically showing the difference between what churches today says the Holy Ghost is compared to what it really is there it is Luke 24 49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so see receiving the holy ghost in a greater measure is a promise he didn't say when but he promised I'm going to send more my spirit right I send the promise of my father and it's the it's the Father's Promise Glory your heavenly father has more power for you praise God your daddy wants to empower you praise God can I say like that layman's terms your dad wants to empower you with keys to his kingdom amen I'd buy you that car Emma or not did you or do you mind okay so your dad did Empower you with that car Dad provided the car right so my dad never gave once I couldn't use me so your dad got you a car your dad promised a car we'll say and then the power came to operate the car right the power came this is like Jesus the he said I send the promise of my father upon you but Terry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you've been due with power from on high so God promised to do it but you got to wait until the promise comes praise God said what promise the seal the Holy Ghost the sight of the Holy Ghost the comforter all these things I've spoken of times thousands more now look there's thousands of blessings of the Holy Ghost and the church said not only is he your sign your seal your comforter he's more than that he's your promise as well and thousands of other things in other words he's your love he's your peace he's your fruit he's your Victory amen Hallelujah he's your joy he's all all the attributes of the Statue of man he's every one of these everything you have need of the Holy Ghost is that to the believer praise God it's the Father's Promise he said I send the promise to my father upon you want promise the one that Isaiah said would come Isaiah 28 with stammering lips and other tongues I'll speak to this people I'll send that rest upon you I'll send what Joel spoke of that it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I'll pour out my spirit upon you and I'll send to you and make all nations all people beginning from Jerusalem I'll bring in the Seed of Abraham under the Covenant I'll seal away every one of them see I'll pour out my spirit I'll send the promise of my father upon you but Terry ye means wait in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power on high that's what we got to keep doing we got to keep waiting on God and church we've got to expect God to pour it out Hallelujah you have to wait on God you got to trust God if God makes a promise he's going to bring it to pass Hallelujah what is the Holy Ghost then it's power from on high not power from the bishop not power from the church but power from on high brother Chris and Lena whoever seeking the Holy Ghost is not power for me it's power from God 20 years ago I would have never thought I'd be a pastor never like I said I hate to go to church anyone I got saved I could hardly I could hardly raise my hands I was so ashamed of myself what do people think what are they going to say I was so I just spent all my services enjoying uh I was just I love the song service but I could never have any freedom now look at me now Church Look at me now I make a fool of myself almost every service I dance around and I praise God I give God the glory and I just love God Amen it's power amen it's a greater power than what I have praise God and God promised to send it and he said it Hallelujah amen and then you've got to have that power on the job like I said they try to get me to buy a lotto ticket the other week I said I ain't buying a lotto ticket they said well you might win a million dollars I just looked at them not buying your lotto ticket I had a sister from overseas text me and she said brother Jesse she said um my husband and all my family are drunks and she's the only one that believes the message got a couple kids and she said we're at a family uh a a family gathering and she said they were all sitting around she's there at the table she said somebody slit her up a drink of alcohol and she said the pressure was so great he said she took the cup and she said she let two drops touch your lips and then sit it down and she said brother Jesse am I saved I said I said I believe you're saved and I said I believe it's the Holy Ghost keeping that out of your mouth Church how many times have we touched sin I mean really close to sin I wasn't going to de-christianize her and I don't know where she stands with God but I said it's a real encouragement that she felt so bad about it afterwards and that she didn't drink it she just let it touch her lips but that's what I was talking about earlier peer pressure right it's easy to shout around here it's easy for me to jump around here it's easy to I can shout in praise God hallelujah but let me go out there for a few minutes let me get discouraged or not get enough sleep some night right everybody's asking me what are you gonna do with this or what are you gonna do with this situation what are you gonna do about that everybody turns and looks at you see what I've seen is that Jesus is there in that moment to help you right in that moment that's why he give you the Holy Ghost for those kind of moments praise God I don't know if she's got the holy ghost or not but I'm thankful that she didn't drink it she didn't drink it down she just let it touch your lips think about church what evil things come out of our lips the church said she kept the alcohol from going I mean the alcohol touch her lips but didn't go down her throat I said be encouraged I said just be aware next time and just say a million miles away from that table right just use wisdom for next time I thought that was a good testimony because peer pressure that's a that's a real thing and Satan always does it not when you're strong when you're weak when your husband hasn't been treating you're right hasn't been paying the bills because he's been buying all the alcohol hasn't been buying food for the kids because he's getting drunk all the time it's the moment when the test comes discouraged don't maybe don't have a home church or not I don't know not in the fellowship I don't know I don't know all the details I'll say like this the Holy Ghost was with her the Holy Ghost was there as a comforter to protect her in that hour Church don't you know the Holy Ghost is going to be there for you too like I said a few months ago it's not if you're going to have those moments it's when you're going to have those moments right like brother amen was in the hospital and some family come in and just accuse accuse accused he could have gone off the handle on them but the comforter was there brother amen praise God all the accusing all the lies all the attacks see all the peer pressure what are you going to say about it what are you going to do about what are you gonna do about it but see in those moments in your weakness story in your weakness his strength is made perfect Hallelujah amen he said my Grace will be sufficient for you praise God in weakness Hallelujah like I'm now I'm getting on the Simon's message again I thank God for the mountaintops but I want Jesus when I'm in the Valley praise God that's what I want him because I'm in the shadow of death death is all around me none of you are standing by there because you've got your life and I'm not standing with you and you're in your Valley praise God but Jesus will be there what is the Holy Ghost brother Chris it's

it's power Wherever You Are it's it's just it's just it's just the humility of saying I don't have the power Lord I need your power right now I need your power Paul was going off to be beheaded and what was his power was he going to show them a miracle no his power was oh death where is your state church if time goes on and I get all this gray hair my teeth start falling out God be merciful if that happens all these wrinkles and I get ready to die what power am I going to have let's say I'm a crooked hunched old man with a cane walking in here I'm going to hand my Bible over to my son to preach the gospel this will be my last sermon I'm 99 years old what power am I going to have at that time the power to look death in the face and say death you don't have dominion over me amen Hallelujah it's power in every situation I saw this for the teenagers it's power when there's a lot of peer pressure amongst your teenage friends it's power when you get that text from your friend that's got some sexual content on it and you delete it right away or you see it and the devil's tempting you you end up deleting it anyway power it's power praise God power for Jesus to rule your life amen hallelujah power like I got an email this week saying oh brother you had the power of the Holy Ghost when you did that debate back in September 2020. I was like well I didn't I didn't necessarily feel the power I was praying and fasting but I felt God just flow right out of me like I said people just they just every week or whatever they testify they can see God's spirit I can't always see it right but I want God to pour out more on me praise God pour out more pour more power praise God so I can be a witness of the Resurrection what is the Holy Ghost here's where they got power here's what here's where they're supposed to wait here's what happened when they did it all prophesied from Genesis right on up from Abraham right on through it come and how it promised it would come the results would come what is it it's promised to the church filled all the house where they were set and appeared unto every one of them cloven tongues I come to fire they're all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now we're going to find out after they were filled they were sealed until how long how many here got the Holy Ghost let's see your hand there's more with the Holy Ghost than there is without it we want you to be one of us brother sister when you understand what it is what is the holy spirit it's the spirit of God dwelling in you to do the works of God Lord that should be our prayer Lord just do the works of God in my life I'm not gonna it's not it's not the works I want to do for God it's the works God wants me to do that's what the Holy Ghost is for to give you power to do what God has called you to do I remember when your mom you were just a little girl and you were bad on seizures I remember when your mom my sister of course I can she won't get that that was the night I danced two hours around the church I remember when your mom went up for prayer for your seizures one woman walked over and grabbed it was either you were Ali out of her hands I don't remember which one it was I can't remember a woman just your mom was just standing there I remember and a woman just walked over and just took her and your mom started praising God worse than God and your mom Allison knocked over she she knocked over the whole Pew so it was not straight it was crooked because her thighs were bumping against her weeping and crying praying for this little one right here to be healed and then she didn't stop there she come up to the Altar and she laid there from 9 00 PM till midnight I left around 10 or 11. because I preached that night and I danced two hours I was I was exhausted and look at her today can everybody see her by God's grace a real trophy of God's grace driving my kids around the country thank you for doing that we're not the state rather safety don't go around the country unless you feel that then you can go I'm just sales over my kids that but that that's seeking the Holy Ghost that's power and don't matter how God answers sometimes God will answer right away sometimes it takes years the investment came the seeking God came the hunger for God to move was there Hallelujah that's what we need a hunger for the things of God in our lives amen that's what three hours of prayer does it produces an MSL Ane Hallelujah I didn't plan to say that just kind of getting to me it's doing the works of God a mother what's a mother's job to do well she has gifts of the Spirit but the main job is to raise those children to love Christ so do we see sister Betsy doing this I didn't know I was going to preach up with you what is the spirit of Christ and sister Betsy it's dwelling in her to do the works of God to raise the children in the admonition of Christ to love their siblings to teach them to walk in the ways of God to go to youth conventions rather than the Super Bowl party don't nobody go to any Super Bowl party tonight so I'm going to preach on you you know I will don't go to no Super Bowl parties don't you stare at that devil TV for three four hours don't you do that you're gonna you're gonna get evil spirits on you yeah I just had a woman email me from Arkansas this morning she's like brother Jesse I met brother brand I'm in the airport when I was a little child and then I heard about his preaching and then she said I I I I I was sitting there watching the TV and I saw the demons come out of the screen and try to get on me and then go back in because it's a real thing and look look now we got the screens right here now we got the screens in our pockets right here they hide behind those images those those words sometimes trying to get on us God will protect us though praise God God will he's our Shield amen he's our Shield I heard a preacher say that somebody's going to preach it to him might as well preacher I'm going an hour and a half I might as well keep reaching Thursday hallelujah it's been a long time since I preached so you got it probably want me to preach a little longer I don't know maybe if I heard a preacher say you know he said we need more offensive Services you know using the sword of the spirit or no he no he actually he said this he said we don't need defensive Services we need offensive services and immediately the holy spirit said what about the other five armor pieces of the Holy Spirit they're all defensive and this brother and they're the church that says God always wants you to heal God always wants to heal you we're the greatest of all time the bride is the greatest Christians ever was in the face and he's saying we don't need defensive Services we do need defensive services sometimes Church Malachi knows history sometimes those soldiers had to just hide behind the shields there's a story of the 300 remember that sometimes it's not an offensive moment sometimes it's a defensive moment sometimes it's camp out brother Chris digging your heels and just try to withstand attack after attack wave after wave but the shield of Faith Glory will distinguish every fiery Dart of Hell praise God Amen and then when it's your time to take the sword yeah then you can move the shield out of the way and then you can be on the attack and then you can overcome but not every piece of our armor is offensive there's times we got to be defensive God makes us well-rounded amen church I want to be a well-rounded Christian where I can speak the word sometimes but even if I don't have strength to speak to the word I still got God's defenses amen hallelujah because I know what it's like there are times I don't have the strength to speak God's word so tired of discouraged or whatever I might not have the strength to wield the offensive weapon but thank God for his defenses amen thank God for the helmet of salvation I know I'm saved sister Emma because he saved me I was there when it happened amen hallelujah I know thank God I got the I got the belt of Truth I got the the the feet shot with preparation the gospel of peace thank God I got a breastplate Hallelujah protecting my soul and my heart amen I got Christ's righteousness protecting me yes we have to have offensive Services I preach those on the Mighty Men services and he's dancing in the spirit that's offensive going on the attack praise God I went to the enemy's camp and took back what he stole from me that's offensive but not every service is offensive sometimes there are sneak attacks sometimes there's appendix problems we didn't know about we didn't know they were coming sometimes there's deaths in the family we didn't know what's coming but the Lord give us he give us armor to prepare us praise God how many can say thank the Lord for that let me try to close here what is the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of God dwelling in you to the works of God and then you'll do all these things that Holy Ghost pill Christians do if it's ordained for you to do you'll fulfill all your gifts you'll have all these fruits of the spirit right these signs will follow you in some manner you'll have some testimonies praise God he said when God ever sent any of his Spirit into any of his servants any of his prophets and and of his teachers any of his Apostles they were always rejected of the world they were considered crazy in every age there was even when Paul stood before Agrippa he said in the way that's called heresy what is heresy crazy in the way they call crazy a bunch of nuts that's the way that I worship the god of our fathers I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them yes sir that's right I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I want to close with one more verse here this is the last one here uh you just come on my heart here so I didn't have time to write this one down it's in John there it is yeah John 14. John 14 16. I'm sorry it's so small he said I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever I love that forever not just in your good times the Holy Ghost will be there in the bad times too well then really is it such a bad time if he's with you then it might feel bad but it's still good because he's right there with you and all things work together for good to them that love the Lord see this is one of the benefits this is part of the power brother Chris of having the Holy Ghost you have a comforter with you who never leaves you even we even sometimes when you're tempted to leave him or leave the church or leave your family even when you're tempted to leave everything leave your job leave leave all responsibility even when you're tempted to leave that he never leaves you praise God hallelujah what is a comforter it's an advocate that's what John says little children in first John chapter 2 he says be not discouraged he said if we sin we have an advocate with the father what is an advocate it's the same as a comforter it's someone who's called to your side called to your Aid one who pleads another's cause before a judge a council for defense a legal assistant amen and Advocate I'm glad I got a legal assistant who knows the laws of God real well sometimes I forget them brother Chris but my lawyer Jesus he don't forget any of these laws praise God and when I need help he's here to argue my case for me praise God and he's with me forever he's not going to lead me this is part of the power this is part of the pouring out of God's spirit that I want to remind you of today it's a person who pleads another cause with one an intercessor so Christ in his exaltation at God's right hand pleading with the father for the pardon of our sins he's also called our helper our aide our assistant you know the popular thing right now in technology is having a personal assistant somebody who can handle pay all your bills handle all your emails do all the little things for you first we got way better than that praise God Hallelujah we have a personal assistant we have an eternal assistant praise God Amen praise God any help I need he can help me achieve what I have to achieve praise God and then not only that he'll go to the father for me now say father you know Jesse did this but he didn't mean to do this he fell short of the glory he didn't mean to this father will you forgive him and the father smiles back and said of course I forgive my son or father Jesse's coming in here and interceding for brother Jose's Health today father would you please hear Brother Jesse's prayer would you please hear this today the helper he's the one that's going to help us praise God get the answers to our prayers amen let's stand to our feet he's the assisting God gave us then the Bible say when you don't know what to pray for the Holy Ghost will pray for how many times have we seen that I don't know what people are praying for and you go pray for them you don't you don't even know what's going to come out of your mouth but something comes out of your mouth praise God and it can sometimes go right to the need of the individual praise God let's have our musicians come by God's grace now church this is the time for spontaneous anybody that feels the Lord to do something now now's the time to do it the Bible says extinguish not the Holy Spirit so the preacher's done now thank God I'm done some of you are saying amen no I'm done whoever feels led to the holy spirit this is the time for them to operate if they have anything from the Lord any guess yes I love reading about Azusa Street or the day of Pentecost that's my heritage I wasn't there but our our spiritual fathers were there remember my wife got yelled over migraines when I was preaching the FF Boston my wife had Chris had migraines all grown up in high school she had egg junk all the time she didn't sleep well she had migraines all the time at one time I was reading that book up I was with I appreciate [Music] for a day with migraines our regional party tonight [Music] don't stop there it goes all the way back hallelujah our message goes all the way back to the day of Pentecost foreign [Music] to read about a one-eyed black man as I say black is because he was a minority it's unusual skin albino skin the Lord he was minority he was unusual he was an unlikely to the world in the humility of Our Lives there's others upon their minds others upon their flesh they can dance and shout and praise God or maybe we slay the spirit we just ask God pour out your spirit upon your sons and your daughters my natural dad maybe promises [Music] Lord how much more with a Heavenly Father keep his promise saith God assistance their children Village in each and every person a hunger here of God I want to see more of God over my life I want to see more of God through in our church [Music] foreign questions [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
