[0:10] 25 Matthew 7 verse 24 it says therefore
[0:14] whosoever Hearth these sayings of mine
[0:17] and doth them I will liken him unto a
[0:20] wise man which build his house upon a
[0:23] rock and the rains descended and the
[0:26] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[0:29] upon that house
[0:30] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[0:33] a
[0:35] rock that sounds to me like a solid
[0:42] foundation let's bow our heart heads for
[0:45] prayer Heavenly
[0:47] Father we ask that you would
[0:49] just lead
[0:52] this message today
[0:57] Lord Lord help me to get out of the way
[1:00] yes
[1:01] Jesus and you speak to our hearts Lord
[1:04] whatever we need thank you Lord and we
[1:07] ask that every demon demonic powers are
[1:10] cast out and have to go in dry places
[1:13] Lord in the name of Jesus thank you Lord
[1:16] for this and we ask that we could be
[1:19] truly yielded to you Lord Lord thank you
[1:23] Lord and only you and Lord give us
[1:25] wisdom and Revelation and understanding
[1:27] of your word which is you we we pray
[1:30] this in your holy name amen amen you may
[1:33] be
[1:44] seated I seeing more and
[1:47] more how important it is to have the
[1:53] word and I'm seeing more and more what
[1:56] the devil's trick is to try to get us
[2:00] away from the
[2:03] word that is the only place to stand the
[2:07] only safe place to stand but Satan is a
[2:10] deceiver and God warned us that they
[2:14] asked him what are the signs of the last
[2:16] times and what were the words that Jesus
[2:19] told them be careful that no man deceive
[2:26] you so if we look back what what did
[2:29] Satan you back in it started all the way
[2:31] back in the Garden of Eden while sin
[2:34] started in heaven cuz Satan was in
[2:38] heaven but sin started uh back there in
[2:41] the Garden of Eden and when the serpent
[2:44] came to Eve they had the word they had
[2:47] the promise
[2:48] right is it anything different from
[2:50] today we got the word we got the promise
[2:54] but why do we
[2:55] struggle James I think it's in James 1
[2:58] it says uh if we are tossed to and fro
[3:02] we are unstable in our ways I think if I
[3:05] don't if I'm not mistaken yesterday
[3:08] morning we had a pretty strong wind I
[3:10] think it was coming from the south or
[3:12] the Southwest well by evening it was
[3:15] coming from the North or Northeast and
[3:17] it was a cold wind so let's just picture
[3:20] in our minds if we were out on a boat on
[3:23] a on the
[3:26] sea if we if we didn't have our anger
[3:28] down of the on the boat which is upon
[3:31] the rock where was that boat yesterday
[3:34] morning it would have blown all the way
[3:35] to the North End Of The Sea and by last
[3:38] evening it would have been all the way
[3:39] to the South End Of The Sea and that's
[3:42] the way our lives are if we don't know
[3:44] where we stand with
[3:46] God and Satan loves
[3:49] it you know what he's doing today if I
[3:52] remember right there were thousands of
[3:55] demons released in the arrus river right
[3:58] who who are they attacking are they
[3:59] attacking the denominational system or
[4:02] are they attacking the bride of
[4:04] Christ amen they are attacking the bride
[4:08] of Christ because they want to destroy
[4:10] them so what are they going to do
[4:11] they're trying to get us off the word of
[4:15] God that's what they're trying to do how
[4:18] are they going to do it they do it he
[4:20] those demons tried to get us uh through
[4:25] religion stop and think it started all
[4:27] the way back there in the Garden of Eden
[4:30] Satan came to Eve and he twisted it got
[4:34] her to doubt doubt the word of
[4:39] God what happened they couldn't be in
[4:41] the Garden of Eden any longer so what
[4:44] did they do they made fig leaves and
[4:47] that's exactly what people are doing
[4:56] today if people say we need more and the
[4:59] word of God it is evidence that they're
[5:02] not trusting the word of God because it
[5:05] is the
[5:06] promise so let's just come down to the
[5:11] Rock to the real thing if I'm not
[5:13] trusting the word I'm going to try to
[5:15] build a
[5:18] religion if we build a if we build a
[5:21] religion it's we're telling people we're
[5:24] telling God we don't trust his
[5:27] word but it looks good
[5:32] we might have 30 40 people in here today
[5:34] and there's a difference if we have the
[5:36] spirit of
[5:38] unity if everybody would just agree with
[5:41] just agree as a group we'll be doing
[5:46] this doesn't really matter what the word
[5:49] says we'll agree to do one thing and
[5:52] we'll do that that Spirit of unity it
[5:56] looks good that's what Cain was
[5:58] doing he was offering up sacrifice to
[6:01] God it looked real
[6:08] good you know what is more
[6:12] powerful if we are in unity with the
[6:16] spirit of godallah one person standing
[6:19] in unity with the spirit of God is more
[6:22] power than 40 people agreeing on
[6:25] something that is not lining up with the
[6:26] word of godallah
[6:29] amen
[6:34] yes stop and think after the flood of
[6:37] Noah it says Noah was a man he walked
[6:41] with God he was obedient to God God told
[6:44] him to build an ark did he do it he did
[6:48] it did it save him and his family amen
[6:53] where were all the other
[6:56] people there was a lot more people on
[6:58] the Earth at that time where where were
[6:59] they they weren't believing the word of
[7:02] God or they would have been in the ark
[7:05] they would have been helping built the
[7:06] ark that's
[7:08] right but they weren't they weren't can
[7:12] you imagine how Noah probably got
[7:15] mocked no
[7:24] rain so here it
[7:27] says the rain descended the flood BLS
[7:29] came the winds blew and beat upon the
[7:31] house and it fell not because it was
[7:33] founded upon the
[7:37] rock so what is the rock for us
[7:39] today Hallelujah we've got a lot of
[7:45] people that know the word of God or they
[7:49] think they know it they're smart yes
[7:52] they figure things
[7:55] out but this is what I'm seeing we need
[7:58] the revelation of the word and that only
[8:01] comes from God revealing it to
[8:04] us and that's the only thing that can
[8:07] stand it says the Gates of Hell will not
[8:10] Prevail against
[8:12] it isn't that true right yes it won't be
[8:17] shaking us we won't be in one side of
[8:19] the Sea on the morning and the other
[8:21] side in the evening if we know where we
[8:23] stand amen amen it's not because we are
[8:28] smart it is because we humbled ourselves
[8:31] we repented and we received the Holy
[8:34] Ghost and God is revealing his truth to
[8:36] us the veil the veil has taken off our
[8:39] hearts and our minds and our eyes and
[8:42] we've got anointed anointed by the on
[8:45] our ears and our eyes we need that amen
[8:53] hallelujah if we stop and think after
[8:56] the the flood was and God promised
[9:01] that there will never be a flood again
[9:03] right to destroy all the Earth did they
[9:05] believe it absolutely not they didn't
[9:08] believe it because they started building
[9:10] a tower in case it would rain again that
[9:13] they could get above the water that's
[9:16] religion so they didn't believe the
[9:17] promise of
[9:20] God
[9:22] yes and that's where this all started
[9:26] Cain and then the Tower of Babel what
[9:28] was it the power Babel is confusion yes
[9:32] is is confusion from God or from the
[9:35] enemy yes sir from the
[9:39] enemy
[9:41] yes how many times does the enemy come
[9:46] and try to get
[9:48] us and we struggle maybe we're not
[9:50] believing the right
[9:52] thing that's the enemy
[10:04] and it says in verse 26 and everyone
[10:06] that Hearth these sayings of mine and
[10:08] does them not is like an unto a foolish
[10:12] man which build his house upon the
[10:15] sand and the rains descended and the
[10:17] floods came the winds blew and beat upon
[10:19] the house and it fell and great was the
[10:22] fall
[10:32] I found the
[10:34] verse that
[10:37] really touched my heart but I want to
[10:40] share something
[10:43] else yesterday morning I got up early
[10:47] opened my
[10:55] Bible and I wasn't sure what
[10:59] God is saying I know this is not what
[11:04] he's talking about here in Luke it's it
[11:06] says in Luke
[11:08] 21 verse
[11:11] 14 I don't know if God was saying just
[11:15] relax but it says settle it therefore in
[11:18] your hearts not to meditate before what
[11:22] ye shall
[11:27] answer I open my Bible and that verse
[11:30] just popped out to
[11:41] me but the verse
[11:43] I
[11:45] um I really noticed something I've read
[11:48] it many times but something just stood
[11:52] out to
[11:56] me it's in it's talking about about when
[12:00] Jesus went out SE it the seed it I'm
[12:03] going to go in
[12:05] Luke in Luke 8 verse 11 it says now the
[12:09] parable is this the seed is the word of
[12:15] God so there's different kinds of hearts
[12:18] that the seat is falling on that's
[12:24] right verse 12 it says this is in Luke
[12:28] 8:12 the G by the wayside are they that
[12:31] hear then cometh the devil and taketh
[12:34] away the what out of their
[12:38] hearts the
[12:45] word isn't he a deceiver that's right he
[12:50] wants to take the word out of our hearts
[12:53] and if he can do that he has
[12:55] us yes sir
[13:00] I've read that many times but it really
[13:02] just chummed out to me then the devil
[13:05] taketh away the word out of their hearts
[13:08] lest they should what
[13:11] believe and be saved Hallelujah so does
[13:15] that mean if we don't have the word we
[13:17] can't believe that's
[13:21] right amen amen
[13:29] it doesn't say anything about join the
[13:33] church or go to church does it sir it's
[13:39] I think we're living in a
[13:41] time doesn't it say in Revelation that
[13:44] Jesus moved out of the church and is
[13:46] calling people to come out to him it's
[13:49] an individual relationship with us sir
[13:59] now it says some seed in verse 13 it
[14:03] says they on the Rock are they which
[14:07] when they hear receive the word with
[14:10] joy and these have no root which for a
[14:14] while believe and in time of Temptation
[14:16] they fall
[14:21] away we we see these things happening
[14:25] yes sir there's people that you think
[14:29] both they're receiving the
[14:32] word but there's different kinds of
[14:35] soil so we better let God prepare the
[14:42] soil so what do we have to do we have to
[14:46] surrender it says I think in Psalms 51 a
[14:49] broken and a contrite spirit oh God thou
[14:52] will not despise there's a lot of power
[14:55] in there brothers and sisters what did
[14:57] Paul do he said I Die daily Hallelujah
[15:01] the flesh has to die let's never try to
[15:04] make this flesh better because we
[15:07] can if there's something deeper
[15:10] inside if the Holy Spirit rests in our
[15:14] soul it gives us power to come overcome
[15:18] victories and things and let's not
[15:19] condemn us if we fail if if this fleshly
[15:22] body fails let's not condemn us cuz
[15:25] let's stop and think Moses failed that's
[15:27] right many times yes sir before God used
[15:30] him mightily and afterwards he hit the
[15:34] rock and he wasn't supposed to but he
[15:36] still was a man of
[15:37] God
[15:39] Amen
[15:41] GL Abraham says believe God and it was
[15:44] counted to him for righteousness that's
[15:46] right did he fail absolutely he did he
[15:50] lied he
[15:52] failed evidently he didn't believe God
[15:55] that he took Hagar for his wife caused
[15:57] him a lot of trouble that's right he had
[15:59] the promise right where is Abraham today
[16:03] the word of God says in heaven
[16:07] yes this helped me a lot let's not
[16:10] condemn us if we fail let's just repent
[16:12] and move on
[16:22] Amen verse 14 it says and that which
[16:25] fell among the Thorns are they which
[16:27] when they hear the word go forth and are
[16:30] choked with the cares and the riches and
[16:33] pleasures of this life and bring no
[16:36] fruit to
[16:38] Perfection yes sir
[16:43] wow I can tell you one
[16:46] thing if God is working in our
[16:49] lives those things are starting to
[16:52] dimish Hallelujah they are
[16:57] Glory but the spiritual things are
[17:00] coming more and more of what we
[17:03] want it says walk in the spirit and ye
[17:05] will not fulfill the lust of the
[17:10] flesh so let's remember that the
[17:14] richest and pleasures of this life
[17:19] yes but it says something before that it
[17:22] says the
[17:24] cares good good would we like to take
[17:27] that word out of there
[17:29] preach brother sir Hallelujah aren't we
[17:32] caught sometimes in the cares of this
[17:34] world I am yes sir yes
[17:37] sir we're not always trusting God in
[17:40] everything are we yes
[17:47] sir verse 15 for some reason I got this
[17:50] highlighted in yellow it says but that
[17:54] on the good ground are
[17:56] they which in an honest and good heart
[18:00] having heard the word keep
[18:04] it and it bringeth forth
[18:07] fruit with patience Hallelujah patience
[18:12] patience is the fruit of the spirit
[18:14] that's right good brother
[18:16] good how many times do we pray to God we
[18:20] ask him but he is not answering right
[18:24] away
[18:27] right that's why we need patience
[18:30] Hallelujah we need patience and the
[18:32] Bible says tribulations work as patience
[18:35] good
[18:37] Hallelujah where would we be if God
[18:39] would immediately answer every prayer
[18:41] for
[18:42] us we wouldn't need patience would we
[18:45] that's right
[18:48] brother maybe God is checking us seeing
[18:51] if we got faith if we trust him yes yes
[18:54] sir Abraham it went many years till he
[18:57] got the promised son right Hallelujah
[19:00] till his prayer was answered till the
[19:02] promise that God gave him
[19:16] amen so I don't care what anybody says
[19:19] to you friends enemies
[19:22] whatever believe the word hallelujah
[19:25] trust God trust God
[19:33] Hallelujah it makes me think when Jesus
[19:35] was out on the boat the storm came why
[19:38] did the Storm
[19:41] come it came at the right time right
[19:44] Jesus fell asleep he was sleeping God
[19:47] wanted to show something to these people
[19:49] yes they awoke him what did he
[19:53] say what did Jesus say to his people on
[19:56] the boat oh ye of
[19:59] little faith
[20:03] yes that makes me think that didn't he
[20:05] say in another scripture if you have
[20:08] faith at a grain of mustard seat you can
[20:10] move mountains that's right now he said
[20:13] little faith maybe they didn't have any
[20:15] faith
[20:17] yes how big is a mustard
[20:21] seed very
[20:25] tiny but I think a lot of people have
[20:28] faith
[20:34] in the wrong
[20:35] thing good brother in the wrong thing a
[20:39] lot of people have faith in a
[20:42] religion
[20:46] yes I forget where it is but I I was
[20:49] reading it and it says something about
[20:51] other gods can we have other gods beside
[20:54] the true God sir
[21:00] sometimes in the Bible there's a capital
[21:03] G and sometime there's not a capital G
[21:06] there's a
[21:08] difference doesn't it say that our belly
[21:11] can be our God good brother that's right
[21:13] yes it does yes
[21:22] sir something that griefs me
[21:30] what I just read here in verse
[21:35] 14 the cares the riches and the
[21:38] pleasures of
[21:39] life and bring no fruit
[21:48] yes we can be living in
[21:51] that it's our choice that's right
[21:53] brother yes
[21:55] sir I see a lot of people living in
[21:58] pleasure
[21:59] just enjoying the Earthly things that's
[22:06] right and not aligning theirself with
[22:09] the word of
[22:10] God yes amen and I'm talking about
[22:13] people in my family yes
[22:22] sir I don't think I have to convince
[22:25] people to believe like I believe but I
[22:28] want to convince people to believe the
[22:30] word of
[22:31] God that's what I want to do turn people
[22:34] to Jesus Let Jesus get into their heart
[22:37] Hallelujah I don't have to go out and
[22:39] tell people quit smoking quit drinking
[22:43] quit running with women or running with
[22:45] men I don't need to tell them to do that
[22:47] I just need him to lead him to Jesus if
[22:50] Jesus gets into their heart they will
[22:54] repent the god that we serve can take
[22:57] away even the desire to smoke a
[22:59] cigarette or to chew tobacco that we
[23:01] can't even do it anymore that's the God
[23:03] we
[23:04] serve
[23:06] amen I don't need to offer you 50 bucks
[23:09] to quit smoking right I think if I do
[23:12] that money is my God right I'm just
[23:16] exposing what is in my heart if I do
[23:18] that if I have to pay somebody to quit
[23:20] sinning right I think the best thing we
[23:22] can do is just tell them Jesus paid for
[23:26] all that garbage Hallelujah Hallelujah
[23:33] everything in verse 16 it says no man
[23:35] when he has light at a candle covers it
[23:38] with a vessel and put us it under a bed
[23:40] and settle sth it but set us it on a
[23:43] Candlestick that they which enter in may
[23:46] see the
[23:47] light maybe that's what we need to do
[23:50] maybe we got to live it yes Hallelujah
[23:53] maybe people will start to believe once
[23:56] they see the light of Jesus coming out
[23:58] of our life
[23:59] Hallelujah yes I know one thing I
[24:03] believe more what I see in people than
[24:05] what they say that's right that's right
[24:07] that's right brother that's right so
[24:09] evidently that might be true for me yes
[24:12] I think it's true
[24:26] Hallelujah re question already came up
[24:29] did Jesus find us or did we find
[24:34] Jesus not everybody has experienced this
[24:37] SC that's
[24:40] right when Paul was on the road to
[24:43] Damascus was he looking for Jesus no sir
[24:46] or was Jesus looking for
[24:48] him right yes
[24:53] amen but weren't there more people with
[24:57] him
[24:59] yes they Hur the voice right
[25:04] yes but they didn't see
[25:10] anybody so that is quite
[25:15] a thing that happened there Paul was
[25:18] pretty persecuting the true
[25:21] Christians but when Jesus got a hold of
[25:24] him
[25:30] now let's stop and
[25:32] think when he heard the voice he asked
[25:34] Jesus who are you he said you're
[25:37] persecuting me was he persecuting Jesus
[25:41] he was persecuting God's people that's
[25:44] right
[25:45] amen so we can be careful yes Hallelujah
[25:50] we can be
[25:54] careful where is Jesus today
[25:59] is he sitting up in
[26:04] heaven or is he in our
[26:06] hearts yes
[26:09] sir I hope he's on the throne of our
[26:13] heart
[26:20] huah but coming back to Paul's
[26:24] experience there's a man involved there
[26:27] that by
[26:29] Marvel his name was
[26:33] ananas evidently his life was in line
[26:37] with God yes because God talked to him
[26:41] in a
[26:42] vision there's a man coming to you that
[26:45] needs help you you help this
[26:53] manlu can we do that yes can God use us
[27:08] Hallelujah so it looks to
[27:11] me if I study my Bible which the Bible
[27:14] says we're supposed to study the word
[27:16] yes it looks to
[27:21] me the word is the only
[27:24] thing that is safe to stand on
[27:28] that's right yes
[27:32] sir so this is the word of God
[27:37] right but if our house would catch on
[27:40] fire and if our Bibles would be
[27:42] burned would there be no
[27:46] word God is the word Jesus is the
[27:49] word hallelujah the word would still be
[27:52] here would still be alive that's right
[28:03] so how do we know that the word is
[28:05] actually a safe place and a sure place
[28:08] I'm going to turn back to Matthew
[28:10] chapter 4
[28:16] Hallelujah we were singing a song we
[28:19] want to be like
[28:22] Jesus how many people want to be like
[28:25] Jesus if we believe in him we better
[28:27] start acting acting like him
[28:29] right loving our enemies forgiving
[28:33] people that hurt us yes sir did we like
[28:37] that when we sang that song Or would we
[28:40] love to take some of the words out of
[28:45] there what did Jesus do that's right the
[28:49] woman that came and wept and washed
[28:52] jesus'
[28:54] feet and the proud religious man
[29:00] not very happy that Jesus was accepting
[29:02] this
[29:03] woman what was wrong with him that's
[29:06] right yes sir maybe he had more sins
[29:09] than he realized yes that's right but
[29:12] Jesus said to whom who you think love us
[29:15] the most the person that's forgiven the
[29:17] most or the least and then he said the
[29:20] person who's forgiven the
[29:23] most did we give Jesus any tears to wash
[29:27] his feet
[29:28] yes
[29:30] hallelujah or are we
[29:33] like what was wrong with the Pharisees
[29:35] what is the
[29:40] Pharisee wasn't it the Pharisees that
[29:42] were given Jesus a rough time yes when
[29:45] he was walking here on Earth yes
[29:49] sir weren't they church
[29:55] people did they all die
[30:04] let's ask us a question did the Pharisee
[30:07] Spirit die no sir I think he's alive and
[30:12] well that's
[30:18] right and there's one person that I'm
[30:20] concerned about and that is me that I
[30:23] don't have that Spirit living in my life
[30:29] yes sir we can so easily get to that
[30:33] place to have a better than thou Spirit
[30:36] that's
[30:37] right because we're in the
[30:41] message let's talk about that this is
[30:45] how deceptive Satan
[30:47] is he tries to get you out of the
[30:49] denominations get you into the message
[30:51] why not get into the
[30:54] word why did God send us a prophet right
[30:59] we can be very careful that we don't do
[31:02] exactly the same thing now we're in the
[31:04] message church now we are in the Baptist
[31:06] Church it's the same thing that's right
[31:09] right it's the very same thing we better
[31:11] be in the word we better be in Jesus and
[31:13] Jesus in us I think the reason God send
[31:16] the prophet is to open the seals to
[31:19] reveal the tricks of the enemy what he's
[31:21] doing from Genesis to Revelation and God
[31:25] is exposing it what the devil is doing
[31:28] yes the churches that look so good the
[31:31] denomination things that look so big it
[31:34] is a spirit that is wrong it is the
[31:37] Antichrist Spirit their anti- word yes
[31:40] sir that's right we might as well say
[31:43] the truth yes sir hallelujah amen
[31:58] I've read
[32:02] this in the back in Pentecost in Acts 2
[32:06] they asked they were pricked in their
[32:07] hearts and they asked him what shall we
[32:10] do then Peter being full of the Holy
[32:12] Ghost said repent and be baptized every
[32:15] one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:17] Christ and ye shall receive the gift of
[32:20] the Holy Spirit right is that something
[32:23] we can
[32:24] trust it's a promise yes sir
[32:32] I've read this it says being in Christ
[32:34] means receiving the baptism of the Holy
[32:39] Ghost
[32:41] yes we can go to a message church and
[32:44] not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:46] that's right brother yes
[32:50] sir we all need a personal relationship
[32:53] with God hallelujah hallelujah
[32:59] Satan is trying to twist things
[33:01] around getting people to believe if
[33:04] you're in so such a such a church that
[33:06] teach the truth you're okay you might be
[33:10] okay and you might not be okay that's
[33:12] right
[33:17] yes so we want to be like Jesus let's go
[33:20] to Matthew chapter
[33:22] 4 after Jesus was baptized why did he
[33:26] have to be baptized I thought if we when
[33:28] we were baptized it washed off all the
[33:30] sin of our life and Jesus wasn't a
[33:33] sinner that's right but he was
[33:37] obedient Hallelujah baptism doesn't wash
[33:40] sin away today for us we need to repent
[33:43] and believe in the blood of Jesus
[33:45] christall Paid For All sin sir paid for
[33:48] all healings
[33:50] Hallelujah in Matthew 4 it says then was
[33:53] Jesus led up of the spirit Into the
[33:56] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[34:06] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[34:08] nights he was afterwards a
[34:11] hunger when The Temper came to him he
[34:14] said if thou be the Son of God command
[34:17] that these Stones be made
[34:19] bread did we ever
[34:23] notice if thou be the son of God
[34:32] sounds to me like the same spirit that
[34:35] came to Eve in the Garden of
[34:38] Eden try to get her well maybe did we
[34:42] ever have that come to us well maybe we
[34:44] don't have to do this or maybe this is
[34:48] okay and we knew that the word said
[34:51] something different yes sir yes sir
[35:00] so if something is
[35:03] Twisted is it from God or the devil it's
[35:07] from the devil yes just twist
[35:10] it the devil likes to take truth and
[35:13] twisted that's
[35:18] right what did Jesus say in verse four
[35:21] he answered and said it is written man
[35:24] shall not live by bread alone but by
[35:27] every
[35:28] word yes that proceed us out of the
[35:30] mouth of God
[35:32] God so Jesus came back to the word yes
[35:38] so do you think it will work for us
[35:40] that's right I think that's the only
[35:41] thing that will work for us
[35:43] yes hallelujah we're living in a time I
[35:47] don't want to scare anybody but we want
[35:49] to stay with the word that is the only
[35:53] thing that's going to stand Hallelujah
[35:55] that's a safe place to be we we we
[35:57] better have our anger down on the Rock
[36:00] Glory that's
[36:04] right because
[36:06] sand it would be a lot easier just build
[36:09] on the sand build on religion wouldn't
[36:11] that be
[36:13] easier it would just fit in with a
[36:16] group right go to church sing a couple
[36:20] songs go home and live however you want
[36:24] to right have pleasure
[36:35] yes verse 5 it says then the devil
[36:38] taketh him up into a holy city and Seth
[36:40] in on the pentacle of the temple and
[36:42] sayth unto him if thou be the Son of God
[36:46] there he does it
[36:47] again cast thyself down for it is
[36:50] written he shall give his angels charge
[36:54] concerning thee and in their hands they
[36:56] shall bear thee up lest at any time thou
[36:58] Dash thy foot against the
[37:01] stone Jesus said unto him it is written
[37:05] again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
[37:07] God
[37:10] hallelujah I love it the devil can't do
[37:13] anything about the word can he that's
[37:15] right Hallelujah sounds to me like a
[37:18] pretty big
[37:19] rock yes
[37:25] sir verse S Jesus said un no again 8 the
[37:31] devil taketh him up into an exceedingly
[37:34] high mountain and shows him all the
[37:35] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[37:37] them and says unto them all these things
[37:39] will I give
[37:40] thee if thou will fall down and worship
[37:44] me then sayth Jesus unto him get thee
[37:47] hands Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[37:49] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[37:51] shall thou serve then the devil leaveth
[37:54] him and behold the Angels Came and
[37:56] ministered unto him him
[38:00] Hallelujah so there's our example yes
[38:05] Hallelujah so we have the
[38:08] word to stand
[38:16] on are we going to go through
[38:18] tribulations
[38:20] trials we
[38:22] will but didn't it Paul go through a lot
[38:25] of Trials I think I read this
[38:29] morning in Acts it says that they even
[38:31] stoned him and Drug him out of the city
[38:33] one
[38:34] day they thought he was
[38:38] dead how many of us people would go back
[38:41] to a church and preach if we'd be
[38:42] treated like that that's right that's
[38:49] right I would like to have more of
[38:52] whatever Paul
[38:55] had more of what Jesus this yes sir
[39:03] Hallelujah so I
[39:05] think and I believe Paul knew where he
[39:10] was
[39:11] standing yes sir why did he because if
[39:14] we read in Ephesians it said it was
[39:17] revealed to him from God that's right he
[39:20] knew where he stands the Gates of Hell
[39:23] couldn't Prevail against it the enemies
[39:25] the the wicked people the ious people
[39:28] tried to destroy
[39:29] him but God used him mightily Hallelujah
[39:34] it says I have fought a good fight I've
[39:36] have kept the faith yes Paul kept the
[39:39] faith
[39:42] yes and he received the crown
[39:46] Hallelujah but it says behind there it
[39:48] is not to him only but to all that love
[39:52] his appearing hallah amen thank you Lord
[40:02] so talking about the good
[40:04] ground spring is just around the corner
[40:07] the way it
[40:09] looks the farmers knows how it is to go
[40:13] out get the soils ready to plant and if
[40:16] we are a good farmer or a ladies a good
[40:21] Gardener we will not go and plant seats
[40:24] on our driveway and think there's
[40:25] something going to come up right for
[40:28] Harvest are
[40:30] we or go out in the woods where a lot of
[40:33] trees are and rocks and plant there but
[40:36] we usually try to find a good spot where
[40:38] the soil is dark and black and we work
[40:42] the soil and and then we put the seed in
[40:44] the ground
[40:47] Hallelujah that's our job yes but the
[40:52] Lord gives the increase Hallelujah yes
[40:56] wonderful
[40:59] last
[41:00] summer God put us through a
[41:06] drought where things didn't want to grow
[41:10] anymore pastors turned
[41:12] brown we had to feed hay to the
[41:20] cows so I was thinking what was God what
[41:23] is he telling us what is he teaching us
[41:28] we need
[41:30] rain we need sunshine in our lives don't
[41:32] we Hallelujah yes if every day would be
[41:36] cloudy and rainy how many depressed
[41:38] people would be walking around on The
[41:40] Thirst if the sun wouldn't come up in
[41:42] the morning yes but what if the sun
[41:46] would be up every day bright and shining
[41:48] and no
[41:49] rain
[41:51] right maybe this will help us to see our
[41:56] life maybe God will take us to a trial
[41:59] to test us to try our Fai see we're
[42:02] going to trust him
[42:04] Hallelujah he
[42:06] does he did Abraham he did Noah
[42:12] Moses they went through a lot of Trials
[42:15] yes sir it's amazing to me that God
[42:18] could use the man Moses not didn't he
[42:20] kill a
[42:22] person I used to believe if somebody
[42:25] would kill a person he should probably
[42:26] be in prison the rest of his
[42:35] life maybe I'm not understanding God
[42:38] like I
[42:40] should I'm understanding one thing God
[42:42] is got a lot of Grace for us yes thank
[42:46] God thank God how do we know that didn't
[42:50] he uh about the Fig Tree he gave him a
[42:53] couple years time that's right yes
[42:58] what kind of a lesson can we get out of
[43:00] this fig
[43:01] tree he came to get fruit and there was
[43:04] no fruit on it but it had leaves
[43:09] right is that how we
[43:13] are do we just have
[43:16] leaves or is there fruit coming out of
[43:18] our Lives Hallelujah did he immediately
[43:20] condemn the tree no he didn't he had
[43:24] patience he had Grace how many people
[43:27] are glad that God had Grace on our lives
[43:30] thankes I am
[43:34] Hallelujah and I
[43:37] trust he's got enough Grace to bring me
[43:42] home Hallelujah I need his grace every
[43:45] day brothers and sisters
[44:03] so I think sometimes we
[44:08] struggle believing maybe we're not good
[44:12] enough we would like to be like Jesus
[44:14] but we're not quite there
[44:16] yet that's
[44:18] right so doesn't the bible teach us that
[44:21] we were supposed to grow in
[44:24] Grace yes this little baby that was dead
[44:27] at this morning is not a woman that's
[44:30] right it's a baby we were all babies yes
[44:35] sir we grow up in adulthood
[44:38] right it took what 20 years maybe 40
[44:42] years maybe 60
[44:44] years to try to get us God's still
[44:48] working on us still chipping on us isn't
[44:51] he yes so let's give God time to work on
[44:55] us let's not condemn us right away if
[44:57] we're not where we want to be yes sir
[45:02] Hallelujah I think that's from the enemy
[45:04] trying to get us to doubt that we're on
[45:06] the right way that's right I love it to
[45:09] know that we are on the right way but
[45:12] we're not there yet yes but as long as
[45:15] we're going on the right road on the
[45:17] narrow road it's as straight as the path
[45:20] to the narrow road and that's the road
[45:22] we want to walk on yes Lord and by grace
[45:25] of God we can walk walk on that
[45:28] road if the storms and Trials come we
[45:31] can still walk on that
[45:33] road yes sometimes if we're driving down
[45:36] the freeway 70 M hour and this just
[45:38] happened yesterday or the other day the
[45:41] wind came and it it pushed the car a
[45:44] little bit but we kept right on going we
[45:47] didn't run into the ditch yes and that's
[45:50] the way trials and things come up we
[45:53] keep on going we keep our focus on Jesus
[45:57] hallelujah we're not to look
[46:00] back if we look in the mirror always to
[46:03] see what's behind us we'll probably end
[46:05] up in the ditch that's right that's
[46:08] right sometimes it's good if we have our
[46:10] wife in the passage seat to watch the
[46:12] road while we're watching
[46:16] scenery I've learned one
[46:18] thing usually where you're looking is
[46:20] where you're
[46:21] going that's right brother
[46:32] my wife is
[46:33] growing she drove about 2/3 of the way
[46:36] up to
[46:41] Dober and I was fairly
[46:44] relaxed
[46:46] Hallelujah and I think she was more
[46:48] relaxed than she was a couple years ago
[46:59] so I hope the more we mature in Christ
[47:01] the more relaxed we can be on this
[47:13] journey my mind goes back to the
[47:15] children of
[47:17] Israel when they put the blood on the
[47:20] door PL
[47:21] post they're in
[47:25] Egypt what did that repres
[47:28] God told them to do it right is what's
[47:30] instructions God gave
[47:32] them so they believed the word of God
[47:36] and they put the blood on the door post
[47:38] on the
[47:39] top but what was that sign that was a
[47:41] token they had but it was a sign that
[47:45] the people on the inside of the house
[47:49] believed in
[47:51] God what is our
[47:54] token the token is the life life of God
[47:58] in us yes the life of God in us is the
[48:02] token
[48:05] Hallelujah it makes me think of Rahab
[48:08] the
[48:12] Harlot isn't it something how Jesus
[48:15] accepted these harlots into his kingdom
[48:17] yes sir yes
[48:24] sir because he paid the price to
[48:27] forgiven yes
[48:39] sir I'm glad he did yes
[48:44] amen weren't we doing the same things
[48:47] following a different God instead of the
[48:49] Living God right we were living in
[48:53] adultery right
[48:57] God help
[49:00] us to keep focused on our living God
[49:04] Jesus our savior
[49:08] Hallelujah the price is
[49:23] paid we were talking about the word
[49:25] there's a lot of scripture
[49:28] to read from it says in uh acts 2:41 it
[49:33] says they well I'm going to read in 40
[49:37] and with many words did he testifying
[49:39] sword saying save yourself from this
[49:41] unto word
[49:43] generation then it says in verse 41 in
[49:46] Acts 2 it says they that gladly received
[49:49] the
[49:51] word were
[49:54] baptized and the same day we're added
[49:56] unto them about 3,000
[50:01] souls and they continued steadfastly in
[50:04] the apostles
[50:06] Doctrine Fellowship in breaking bread
[50:09] and in
[50:13] prayer so once the spirit of God is
[50:15] living in us it will cause us to follow
[50:19] his ways Hallelujah yes sir we want to
[50:22] it says use not your Liberty as an
[50:24] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[50:28] one another Wonder wonderful so how we
[50:32] treat each
[50:33] other is very important yes sir yes
[50:40] sir we're not here to condemn people
[50:42] we're here to help people yes sir
[50:45] Hallelujah there's a lot of people
[50:47] walking around that are in
[50:49] bondage people that are going to church
[50:52] people that are not going to church
[50:58] going to church doesn't get us out of
[51:01] bondage right oh I thought that's a good
[51:04] place to be in
[51:05] church but we do go to church if we're a
[51:09] true Christian that's right yes
[51:11] sir lift our praises to our Savior pise
[51:16] God bless him praise Him Hallelujah have
[51:18] fellowship with each other encourage
[51:21] each other pray for each other yes the
[51:24] power of prayer Glory
[51:42] in second Peter chapter
[51:47] 1 verse 5 it says besides this giving
[51:54] diligence what does he say in
[51:58] here add to your face
[52:01] virtue and to Virtue
[52:04] knowledge so that sounds to
[52:06] me we are to have faith in God and now
[52:11] it says we're to add the things to it
[52:14] yes
[52:19] amen so maybe once the first day we
[52:22] believ we didn't have all this evidently
[52:24] not that's right
[52:29] I think it's by the grace of God that we
[52:31] can believe yes sir I think God put a
[52:34] seed in us so we can
[52:36] believe
[52:46] right verse six it says and to knowledge
[52:49] Temperance and to Temperance patient
[52:51] there comes the word patient
[52:53] again and to patience godliness
[52:57] and to Godliness brotherly kindness and
[53:00] to brotherly kindness
[53:02] charity
[53:06] wow we're not going to stop there
[53:09] there's a promise here we want to see it
[53:11] Hallelujah for if these things be in you
[53:14] and
[53:15] abond they make you that ye shall
[53:18] neither
[53:20] be
[53:22] Barren nor
[53:24] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[53:27] Jesus
[53:29] Christ I think that's a promise we can
[53:31] stand on that's the word of
[53:35] God so let's have it in our lives
[53:38] hallelujah
[53:41] amen oh there's another verse here that
[53:43] we need to read but he that lackes these
[53:47] things what's wrong with
[53:49] him he's
[53:52] blind and it says he can't even see very
[53:54] far
[53:56] wow that'd be a dangerous place to
[54:02] be but it doesn't stop there it says and
[54:05] has has
[54:06] forgotten that he was perched from his
[54:09] old
[54:12] sins right
[54:18] wow anybody here today that is believing
[54:22] that he might not be forgiven
[54:31] I believe all sin is Forgiven Hallelujah
[54:34] past present future hallelujah it's paid
[54:39] for God can I believe
[54:43] that what is the number one
[54:47] sin
[54:54] unbelief that's why the children of
[54:56] Israel most of them couldn't enter the
[54:58] land of promise because of
[55:06] unbelief I'm glad that there were a
[55:08] couple that
[55:10] could Hallelujah Josh and Caleb had a
[55:13] right
[55:14] Spirit right so maybe that what was
[55:16] wrong we need a right Spirit within us
[55:19] so we can believe and trust
[55:22] God yes Josh and Caleb they've seen some
[55:25] things over there that didn't look like
[55:27] just minor little things they saw giants
[55:30] and stuff didn't they yes they did but
[55:32] wor did they have their
[55:34] trust in the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:37] hallelujah hallelujah in the same God
[55:42] that little David that destroyed the
[55:47] giant I think we need to destroy Giants
[55:50] that come up in our life yes sir sir not
[55:53] by our strength and our muscles
[55:57] but through trusting
[55:59] God yes sir
[56:01] GL and one of the Giants is that the
[56:04] enemy wants to bring to us is doubt fear
[56:08] yes believing lies believing I'm not
[56:11] good enough right maybe I'm not
[56:20] forgiven the Bible's pretty
[56:23] clear that we can be forgiven
[56:27] and if he sets us free we are free
[56:30] indeed it says ye shall know the truth
[56:34] and the truth shall make you free
[56:36] sometimes we just quote part of the
[56:37] verse but it says ye shall know the
[56:40] truth the truth is the word yes and that
[56:44] will make you free we don't need to walk
[56:46] around in
[56:47] bondage we sang a song like that didn't
[56:50] we
[56:58] I know the weight that went off my back
[57:01] and my shoulders when I turned to Christ
[57:04] Hallelujah
[57:07] Glory there were
[57:09] sins that I was struggling with in my
[57:12] life that never came up
[57:14] again not because of
[57:17] me not because of me but greater is he
[57:21] that is in you than he that is in the
[57:24] world I love it
[57:27] but I had to humble myself and repent
[57:29] and believe Hallelujah Glory if it
[57:32] worked for me it will work for all of
[57:34] you prise the
[57:44] Lord it makes me think of
[57:48] the the 10
[57:52] virgins they were called to come out
[57:55] right yes
[57:57] who were they supposed to
[57:59] meet the
[58:01] bridegroom where were they coming out
[58:04] of it looks to me like they were church
[58:08] people weren't
[58:12] they yes sir it says five of them were
[58:16] wise
[58:17] yes so what were the difference five of
[58:21] them were wise and five were foolish but
[58:23] they were all
[58:24] virgins yes sir
[58:28] the wives came
[58:30] out they were ready to meet their
[58:32] bridegroom right yes they have the oil
[58:35] represents the Holy Spirit right that's
[58:39] right so they had
[58:43] it the cry was
[58:47] made I think the cry is made today too
[58:51] the cry is here sir come out to meet the
[58:54] bridegroom
[59:01] Hallelujah I think that's our protection
[59:04] today the bridegroom is right here on
[59:06] Earth in human bodies yes
[59:13] Hallelujah and I think he's going to
[59:16] take care of his people Satan deceived
[59:19] many people but there is an elect that
[59:22] are not going to be deceived this time
[59:25] the very elect won't be deceived because
[59:28] they have the oil in their lamps yes
[59:32] Hallelujah the foolish one that they had
[59:34] get oil from the others but they
[59:37] couldn't isn't that how it is with us I
[59:42] can't get my salvation from Chessie
[59:45] that's
[59:49] right or from Howard or John that's
[59:52] right I can't do
[59:54] that yes go
[59:56] go to Jesus and get it yourself hallu
[1:00:00] hallelujah it's
[1:00:02] free my Bible says it's free
[1:00:06] Glory the living water is free for all
[1:00:09] who want it hallelujah praise God thank
[1:00:12] you Jesus thank you
[1:00:22] Lord we had a guy come to our church
[1:00:25] prob three and a half four years
[1:00:28] ago and he sat beside
[1:00:36] me and
[1:00:41] I at one
[1:00:43] time I wouldn't have wanted to sit
[1:00:46] beside a person like
[1:00:52] that why
[1:00:56] was
[1:01:03] divorc but I learned something from that
[1:01:07] guy there's a verse
[1:01:13] here that he
[1:01:20] claimed and we can find it in
[1:01:23] Philippians 4:13
[1:01:27] this is something if I think of that man
[1:01:29] I think of this verse I can do all
[1:01:32] things through Christ which strengthens
[1:01:40] meall I've noticed he was trusting God
[1:01:44] even for his
[1:01:47] work to make a living
[1:01:58] I've had to repent many times
[1:02:01] already in the last couple years and
[1:02:05] before that repentance is a change of
[1:02:09] mind Hallelujah that's what Jesus wanted
[1:02:13] the scribes and the Pharisees to do he
[1:02:15] wanted them to have a change of
[1:02:23] mindah I look at people different from
[1:02:25] what what I
[1:02:27] did because God made all of
[1:02:30] them sometimes we meet people maybe in
[1:02:33] town or at gas stations maybe they need
[1:02:40] prayer I was with a guy one time last
[1:02:44] year we were down Logan a gas station
[1:02:47] and he talked with a a guy in the gas
[1:02:50] station he was struggling and when he
[1:02:52] came out he said I want to pray with
[1:02:54] this guy
[1:02:56] and when he came out he went out and
[1:02:58] asked if he could pray for him and we
[1:03:00] prayed for him right there in front of
[1:03:02] the gas
[1:03:06] station this guy was
[1:03:11] troubled he had tattoos over his
[1:03:22] body I need Jesus and he needs Jesus no
[1:03:26] difference that's right no difference
[1:03:29] Hallelujah
[1:03:32] God in verse 19 it says my God shall
[1:03:36] supply all your needs according to his
[1:03:38] riches in Glory by Christ Jesus do we
[1:03:43] believe that
[1:03:53] yes we could change one one word my God
[1:03:57] shall supply all your wants according to
[1:04:00] his it's not what it
[1:04:03] says I think sometimes we get our wants
[1:04:07] and our
[1:04:13] needs that's why we need to grow in
[1:04:16] grace to get our wants and our needs in
[1:04:19] order that's why we need Christ
[1:04:24] God so I see
[1:04:26] I need to Die daily and yield to God so
[1:04:30] he can have his way in my life
[1:04:33] Hallelujah that's very important yes it
[1:04:41] is so we got to come to the feet of
[1:04:44] Jesus yes sir yes
[1:04:47] sir I want to share one more
[1:04:53] thing if we read in The Book of
[1:04:57] Ruth I don't understand all this but I
[1:05:00] think I got a a revelation of something
[1:05:03] there with Ruth and
[1:05:09] boas a kinsman
[1:05:12] redeemer neom and her two
[1:05:16] daughter-in-laws were widows
[1:05:19] right and Ruth had made a choice to go
[1:05:23] with Naoma wherever she went
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:28] thy people will be my people thy God
[1:05:30] will be my god look what
[1:05:34] happened she went out in the field to
[1:05:37] pick up grain that the
[1:05:40] Reapers didn't get
[1:05:46] right but was it I think it was in boas
[1:05:49] field and he if I remember right he told
[1:05:52] the Reapers to let some more grain lay
[1:05:55] there so she could have it I think we
[1:05:58] need that also we need some of that
[1:06:01] bread too from Heaven don't we
[1:06:03] Hallelujah but this is what I want to
[1:06:06] point out I think we all want to be the
[1:06:08] bride of Christ right yes
[1:06:10] Hallelujah this is the last thought I
[1:06:12] want to share what did Ruth do she was a
[1:06:18] virgin there was men out there gleaning
[1:06:21] but she was a
[1:06:24] virgin and she was safe but at night
[1:06:28] after they had boas had eaten he went
[1:06:30] and laid down to sleep where did Ruth
[1:06:33] lay
[1:06:34] down at the feet of
[1:06:37] boas our carnal nature think whoa what's
[1:06:41] going on here but this is a spiritual
[1:06:45] lesson where is the bride of
[1:06:49] Christ we lay oursel down at the feet of
[1:06:53] Jesus at midnight Bo
[1:06:56] awoke and see there's a woman laying at
[1:06:58] his
[1:07:00] feet this is a spiritual
[1:07:04] lesson Ruth wanted boas to cover her
[1:07:08] with his
[1:07:10] skirt isn't that what we want Jesus to
[1:07:12] do for
[1:07:13] us we want Jesus to cover oursel with
[1:07:17] his skirt Hallelujah yes Lord and boas
[1:07:22] ended up marrying her
[1:07:24] later yes
[1:07:29] and that's where Jesse and
[1:07:33] David isn't that wonderful hallelujah
[1:07:38] hallelujah I want to encourage all of us
[1:07:40] let's stand on the word of God if the
[1:07:44] enemy comes to try to get us to doubt to
[1:07:47] twist things it is written this is what
[1:07:50] the word of God says and let's stand on
[1:07:52] it that's the only thing that's going to
[1:07:55] stand
[1:07:56] yes and let's lay oursel at the feet of
[1:08:02] Jesus thank you for his
[1:08:06] grace let's stand for
[1:08:12] prayer Heavenly
