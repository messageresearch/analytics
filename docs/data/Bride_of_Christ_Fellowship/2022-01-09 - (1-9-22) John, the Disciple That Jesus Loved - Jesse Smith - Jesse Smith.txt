months maybe since the summer even but it just kind of came back to me this week and i thought mad i know i got to preach that message so i would like to preach that this morning john the disciple whom jesus loved and just so you know we had a little bit of internet trouble you know i'm not sure what the problem is but um so if you try to live stream this or listen to service later it won't have the song service on it so sorry about that we just had i don't know i need to uh reach out to somebody or that brother dan about uh that software i just i don't understand the software or we need to get a new computer i'm not sure which one it is but you know it's just a trial and error you know you just got to do trial and error until you figure things out and um but thank god for all the efforts praise god and enjoy the songs buddy wonderful job on the songs thanks for typing that out just do that very good beautiful song there how many have gratitude today for the lord jesus christ that's what i want to i want my life to have that i don't want the devil to steal that from me that's my possession that's my inheritance from the holy spirit and every good and spiritual gift is mine now and i want to possess that promise how do we want to possess that promise amen i know you do i want to as well it's just good sometimes good to say it out loud praise god so thank the lord for his grace today john chapter 21 and we're going to read verses 20 down to 25 basically finishing the the chapter here john 21 verse 20. i'll read 20 to 23 then we can all read 24 and 25 together then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also lean on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me just a side lesson here if we're more worried about other people's walks with the lord than our own then jesus is here to correct us today praise god here's a man who's going to be filled with the holy ghost he's the spokesman on the day of pentecost he has the keys to the kingdom he said what about this guy and jesus says what is that to you you're going to get distracted from your calling from my calling for your life peter if you don't just listen to my voice for your life don't get distracted by worrying about what's that brother doing what's that sister doing what's going on there with that church don't worry about that you follow christ amen verse 23 then went this saying abroad among the brethren look what it cost because of peter's human side can i say like that because of his human side what do you know what do you have in store for john you know what's john's life going to be all about because of that there went that the disciples should not die they went out of saying now this wasn't a true saying but a false idea went out because of someone's concern about someone else right yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarried till i come what is that to thee let's read verse 24 and 25 on 3 1 2 3 this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen let's have a word of prayer if you haven't eaten on your heart just make anointing to god somehow we'll just trust the holy spirit here to speak to us father god my hands up lord and we have sung your songs and we have gratitude today lord god we're we're taking this time to forget about our trials we're taking this time to actually cast our trials and our tests on you we're casting our cares on you because you care for us lord god hallelujah thank you for the cross thank you for the nail pierced hands lord god thank you that the darling of heaven lord descended came down to take our place lord god and then he ascended and sent down gifts unto men lord take your gifts today lord and use your gifts to bless your people to bring us to perfection lord god to prepare us for your coming lord we don't know the day or the hour help us to see the season lord god help us to be watching and praying as eagles lord watch from above as they as they pray on their uh on their food lord but we would say pray spiritually lord god and lord we're watching and praying with this eagle anointing lord god to live above the things of the world to live above laodicea's distractions and and sins lord god and we just thank you for your loving kindness wash us now in thy blood lord and help me to be able to preach your thoughts lord god on this subject that your people might be blessed and filled with your goodness and lord is ministered to all those needs we pray for there are so many needs lord god be with those those that are sick and need a healing lord god and be with the travelers and and lord just bring joy restore joy to the salvation of your people in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god so we'll look here to this thought here and uh i hope it would be a blessing to you you know i was telling my sister betsy i was messaging her this week and she was uh she was really blessed by the joshua series i said well you're not the only one i said i've been blessed by that series and she said it's meant a lot to her it's meant a lot to me too to just have a refreshing look at how more than a conqueror and i have the spiritual armor on and i can cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of god and be a conqueror in this day praise god and that's helped me out a lot in this last year of my life and so you know we were just talking and um and just trying to you know encourage one another and and i'm actually not sure where i was going with that story now that i think of that uh i can't think of it now i got kind of delayed there or sidetracked i'm hoping it'll come back later um but uh we do want to look at this and and like oh yeah oh yeah there it is now i was uh telling her how you know through the joshua series i got a lot of inspiration from brother branham and there's another preacher from colorado i was getting a lot of inspiration from and then just regular inspiration from the holy spirit just inspiration that no no man i didn't hear any man preach it i just heard the voice of god and uh and so with this thought i actually heard you know this may sound strange but when i was studying the the false prophets i was listening to some of the false prophets and i got i got this thought from one of them and so uh it's a bible thought right and that's how most false prophets or teachers operate they'll use part of the word of god uh but then they'll take away other important parts of the word of god okay so just you know i always like to reference where i got this thought i actually got this thought from a mega preacher i'm not going to name his name today but i can tell you after his church if you like but um and then i started studying it i found brother rams quotes and it just kind of all came together so i hope this will be a help to you it's been helping me again to see the love of god and this reminded me of that leah sermon leah loved of the lord a few years ago on mother's day so as i was driving to church i just played that you know on one and a half speed so i could finish the sermon you know before i got here and just was reminded again of the love of god for all of us praise god and uh kind of reminded me of that message but we'll we'll look to the lord here and uh you can switch over is it not working okay maybe i got the wrong maybe i didn't plug it in the right way i have some quotes and some scriptures i like to show okay there we go all right so you know this i found this picture you know and i whenever i find the picture online i want to find the most godly one and this was probably the most godly one i i could find here that and uh you know how uh as much as i hear it i just love to hear more how john loved jesus so much that he actually leaned on him you know he i remember in the bible days you know a relationship between a husband and wife was was very different in bible days uh you know like the bible said david had such a love for jonathan it surpassed women well that's because they they weren't born again in those days right uh and of course we know there was nothing sinful about that the world tries to make that a sinful relationship but it wasn't but the i the fact was in the society sisters were very separated from brothers right so brothers would spend most their time with brothers right sisters would spend most their time with sisters and no doubt that that that culture even flowed and continued into jesus day and beyond and finally today we're at a day where at least in america and some western civilizations and other civilizations a woman is now uh in her place as equal to a man because the bible said in christ there's neither male nor female right but in jesus day remember a woman couldn't even give a testimony in a court trial she wasn't even trusted enough a woman was so looked down upon right and you know through time you know the the saints have realized and given more revelation on the value of a woman and they can see the types and shadows in the the proverbs 31 chapters praise god and they can see some of those types and shadows and now they they can have the the rest the restored idea of a sister and her place and position in a christ in the family they can have that uh that full revelation now because the day's the day of restoration today's the day when the mystery of god is finished praise god and uh but i just you know you know thinking about that that that that culture that exists at that time i can see how john as a young man would want to lean upon christ and he would just kind of just imagine that like who who actually lays in your chest you know i mean like how many people actually lay in your chest you know that are not your children or your spouse you know just very few you know we'd say and then who who climbs into your who climbs into your chest can i say like john would you he'd just lean up and kind of squeeze up on the lord you know he just kind of hug him up uh this is the kind of love that john had for christ how many want that love praise god that's how i feel like when i go to prayer like jesus i really need you i really need your touch i need to hear from you today uh and this is john this is john who is a you know the fourth gospel which is the fourth anointing the eagle anointing he's no doubt a prophet saw the visions of the book of revelation a type of that fourth anointing uh the the challenger to the fourth horse rider death right so this is life amen this is spiritual life this is the anointing of eagle life amen hallelujah because the spirit of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy and our lives are prophetic uh speaking of christ in the church praise god so we see john here as a as a man who loved the lord now uh we did our texts and there's five verses five is grace right there's five verses that call where john himself we believe calls himself love to the lord okay there's at least five i believe there's five so let's read these and we'll just make some comments and you know in john chapter 13 23 this is right after jesus washed their feet right at the last supper or there and he said now there was leaning on jesus's bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved and so of course we see john here at the last supper uh leaning upon christ and and laying in his his bosom or his most intimate area here because he loved his savior so much praise god just a beautiful picture of john's love for christ in chapter 19 at the cross as jesus is dying i just i just love this thought you know brother branham brought out in different ones that brought out how in jesus's last moments he was still concerned about others he wasn't so much concerned for himself he'd already battled that battle in the garden of gethsemane that's where he said lord take it away from me if it's possible take it away but the holy spirit told him no he must take this cup right that great conference like brother van priest's conferences the holy spirit had a great conference with christ in the garden of gethsemane and settled the matter there that's where the real victory of the cross came was in prayer praise god how you know you get great victories in prayer amen how many have had victories in prayer amen hallelujah that means you're gonna have more victories in prayer remember jesus said pray that you don't enter into sin if you feel like a sin is coming on or there's a temptation coming on if you feel the temper coming on go to prayer and the tempter will have to move back because you have strength now you have spiritual strength to overcome the temptation because now the comforter has made his presence fresh in your life amen and you've been comforted where you don't have to you don't have to give in to the enemy's lies or or his trap you don't have to you don't have to go to the enemy to try to have some satisfaction or some type of whirly pleasure or something like that because now the pleasure of the lord is what you've received and you're holding on and jesus has become your pleasure amen and you will not enter into sin for a season praise god amen the bible said sin is a pleasure for a season that's quite a striking thought right we've all experienced as sinners we've all experienced the the spring season and the summer season of sin right most of us have where you just enjoyed sin there was a time where i just enjoyed doing all those evil things i just enjoyed it it was i stayed up late for it i get up early for it but there's a season where that ended amen thank god hallelujah thank god amen and then pretty soon out of fall season where that those desires were dying away right falling away then you come to the winter season where where it's like yesterday where i just hate being outside right we hate it because it's death death is overcome uh the season and thank god we got to that place amen brother austin just got to that place recently amen where sin was no longer a pleasure amen but it was a like a pig pen it was like a a freezing uh wilderness where there was no hope and there was there's nothing to attract him to the sin anymore so he cried out to god and he came home to god and god received him amen glory on jesus's cross he looks out like the disciple that he loved and said to him this woman is your mother and he said he said woman this boy is your son on the cross praise god what love jesus has for us praise god amazing love that he has for us even for his mother the second and third time are here after the resurrection uh she runeth and come to simon peter another disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they've taken away the lord out of the supper and we know not where they have laid him okay so they ran specifically and the bible specifically names simon and john peter and john as the ones the woman ran to to tell them the good news he's risen did they believe him or did they believe her not no not really not till later and then in chapter 21 verse 7 the bible said therefore the disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard there was a lord he gird about his fisher's coat unto him for he was naked so like in a swimming garment right swimming swimming clothes his undergarments on and he'd cast himself into the sea he wasn't ex he wasn't completely naked he just had that outer or i'm sorry that inner tunic like his underwear on right that's just his underwear he had that on and then uh the fifth time was what we read for our text where uh john is uh he's closing out the book and he he tells us that that peter wanted to know about his life and and his you know john's calling for his life and as we said it there in the uh at the beginning you know we got to be careful not to worry about other people so much now we're supposed to bear their burdens like recently i had a couple of people tell me thank you for bearing my burden i couldn't handle this burden so thank you for uh bearing that for me uh and that's what we're supposed to do as brothers and sisters but the fact that jesus rebuked peter it shows that peter must have had the wrong intention about this question right he wasn't born again yet he said well what do you what about john what do you do with john and jesus says what is that to you so that moment he was worried about something that he should not have been concerned about and that's what the devil likes to do he likes to make us worry about things we shouldn't even worry about why are we wasting our why are we wasting our energy on those kind of things if that is god's will you're wondering about god's will if it is god's will what is that to you in other words jesus is saying you're not going to really serve with john so much you have a different ministry remember it's peter peter spent most of his time right around jerusalem right establishing the church there john was ephesus right and then later to the isle of patmos uh boiled in oil but over they couldn't boil out the holy ghost out of them praise god amen my what a what a testimony these men had hallelujah such men of god so we we understand there's a there's a there's a desire that's wrong to want to know about other people's calling for their life so for us it would be why worry about the other churches you know now of course again balance that because there are times where god's going to use you to correct somebody god's going to use you to encourage somebody but this of course was not the right attitude because he gets rebuked by christ so five times we see that john calls himself the disciple whom jesus loved now this is a good thought i heard a preacher also just a different preacher i heard him from minnesota john piper john piper i listen i go into him because he's he they don't have everything right but he's a he's a student of the bible now he's really getting off on some things lately but of course that's my opinion but i believe it's right by the word of god but anyways i like to go to him because he has a lot of deep thoughts in the word and he brought out this point that jesus loved all his disciples and so he made the point you have to go through the whole book of john and see all the people that jesus loved so i just typed in the word love i did this study yesterday you know on the drive to the wedding and back and what did what did john say about the love of god right so we'd have to know is john saying jesus loved me more than you what was john saying i'll kind of save that for the end so i'll let you meditate on that for a few minutes let's look at what jesus said about love and john what john said about jesus love jesus john said that god so loved the world in fact this is jesus's words john's quoting jesus god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that's pretty good memory verse isn't it yes but now you have to balance this out with uh this idea this divine love that god gives everybody a chance to be saved because he loves him so much but if god knows a group won't repent anymore then god's going to have jesus not pray for them anymore because god's not going to waste jesus's time right because in john 17 9 jesus said i pray for my disciples i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine now we don't have that ability we don't know who's saved and who's not unless the holy spirit lets us know but i'll tell you this a lot of people i thought were holy ghost filled i found out later we're definitely not a lot of people i thought weren't filled with the holy ghost seem like they are praise god because we only have a small window into people's lives we only see a little bit about how they live and we think my that's brother's a real fine man of god find out later he wasn't or that sister or she's a real wonderful sister or she was an awful sister find out why she's pretty she's very sanctified i misunderstood it right i misunderstood the situation we have a very limited perspective so again it goes back to that idea don't worry about other people you just live for christ
