Lord to surrender in every area of our life and you might be glorified that we might live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God bless us now in your divine presence in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you mean seated praise God by God's grace to look at part 9 of this prove all things and unless something changes this will probably the last sermon I preached on this subject just because I put hours and hours into it and it's it's just just exhausting it's just exhausting and I think now I've covered the main things I'm settled in my heart about these things and I'll share the remainder of this today it is a live one today I didn't close this one off because I shared most of the personal testimonies or personal I should say interactions and names you know the last time we looked at proving all things and so I Lord willing I think I'll just finish off today but if you have any questions and you like me to preach another message forward your question I'll be happy to do that we can have a questions and answers or we can look at it again but I've been settled as I've looked at it this week I've just got more and more settled on it I feel like I know where I stand I feel like I have good answers that make a lot of sense that are scriptural and so you can switch over I do have quotes I want to look at the remainder of the prophecies that were spoken in the name of the Lord and as I showed you a few weeks ago most of the problems believe the sign has with brother Branham most of them are not problems that are thus saith the Lord they're just maybe accusations or that that are just brother branham's opinion and their hope they're open to having their opinion and they're allowed to have their opinion so but I find that as far as with prophecies I feel like I'm settled and I feel like I just want to move on to other subjects by God's grace I want to do the Ephesians series I want to finish that when I left off on that one that one kind of tied in with the jeffersonville things doctrines there I haven't heard back anything from Jeffersonville since the letter so I'm just patiently waiting and if they want to talk about it they got my number they got my email they got my video they got my mouth they got my book that they want to contact me Here I am I'm happy to talk about it anytime they want to so I want to continue on that one and there's other series I can't think of a now but there's other series I want to get to I want to eventually look at the entire life of Jesus Christ because we know our ministry has to match his ministry because he's called the the he's called the capstone we know he's the cornerstone and he's the hast called the headstone in the Bible and so he's gonna come down and rest upon a building the Bible says that we are a building placed together we're to be not just stones were to be living stones praise God were to have life to our testimonies praise God and the Bible says Paul says he's built a temple to dwell in and we are that living temple he's gonna come cap off a living temple a living body that he can dwell in a church that he can dwell in that's my great prayer that God will dwell in this church praise God that will be a church that the Holy Ghost can dwell in amen hallelujah that's a great blessing a promise that we that we can obtain and it's our choice right it's our choice whether to obtain to it or not just like many of God's promises are conditional and then Lord willing oh I'll be looking at more of the rapture series I just started that on Wednesday night now the reason I do that Church is because I'm writing I wrote on that and I hope you understand we have to get to a spot where we can prove everything we believe by the word only I think I think you you and I can see that people get in trouble when they just could say brother Branham brother Branham brother Branham people get into trouble with that as we saw because then you end up either leaning on brother Branham or leaning on the tapes or making too much of the tapes the tapes have a place right but our absolute has to be Jesus Christ it has to be the Word of God because the Word of God is the only thing that will never pass away so that's the reason why I wrote on that that's why I'm writing this book right now I'm in the the chapter to on Israel's blindness I'm going through all the covenants and so I'm learning a lot it's been a lot of research there to learning a lot it looks like there's eight covenants in the Bible and it looks like there's only one dispensation in the Bible and that's the Gentile dispensation so we'll get to that that's a whole nother teaching I want to get to that eventually and I want to give myself wholly to the Word of God I think it'll be a blessing to you and I want to just preach through all those chapters I've written because it'll just prove that we have the Word of God the true revelation Christ must increase praise God and we must decrease amen so that's kind of where I'm feeling led to go now but as I said if you have any questions about believe the sign or Jeffersonville movement please let me know I'll be happy to address them but I feel pretty pretty secure I was like I told you I was nervous for a while I was shaking up especially when friends like the ones I named it with you close to me we're kind of wondering about it and I'd never studied some of them I was really nervous for a few weeks there I was I was going through some tests but like all tests what do you want to test why why do you get shaken so you can find your foundation right you get shaken to see anything that would fall would fall but you're after the shake and you come back to your foundation and it's the Word of God so I didn't have an answer for the brown bear really I didn't have an answer for the 300-thousand I didn't have an answer for some of these other ones but through study and going back and waiting on the Lord and and searching the scriptures and the quotes then I found a place to stand praise God so anyways let's go now now what I do is sometimes you'll hear me I'll be like quoting something but it's not up there yet that's because I got two devices here I got my phone hooked up here but I got my iPad here because it's bigger so I can see it so if I'm ever if it ever seems like I'm not in line with what they're that's why so somebody just like go like this as they tap your tap your phone or something like that I don't mean to do that but I I just I need the bigger I like to see it bigger down here so I'm just gonna wrote real briefly say this just remember two perspectives there are so many correct prophecies from brother Branham that when you start looking at believe the sign you I forgot how many correct there were okay and then I always have to remember that this is basically the fruits that you have to look at the fruits of those who are accusing brother Branham the fruits of their false teachings the fruits of their life many of them are corrupt fruits they're not in holiness right and the Bible says in Titus and let me just go to that quickly there - Titus chapter 2 this is one way we know we're walking in the light because the Bible says teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ as I listened and study on both sides of this you know with Jeffersonville and believe aside I see on the side I believe assigned a lot of the testimonies of people but but what I find is that I don't I don't believe their lives are getting more righteous or more holy to me it looks like they're getting more like the world and I shared some obvious examples the last time I looked at this and there's other ones too you know you listen to the gentlemen and they talk more about they talk about how they love sports and how they love movies and entertainments and things like that you know the Bible says Jesus Christ gospel will produce righteousness it will produce a more godly life and so our lives have to be going more righteously to that's one proud to have with message people I love people but I got a problem when their life doesn't look more like Christ I've got a problem with that and so I've got a right to preach that in our church if our lives aren't looking more godly then there's a problem with our lives the gospel of Jesus Christ is produced a life like Christ's righteousness sober godly in this present world amen but we see a lot of message churches and people they let down the bars they let sin enter in they let a corruption and are in and so these are two things I keep in mind though with believe the side I remember there's hundreds of discernments on the tapes there that are absolutely right one of them we know was Florence Hughes and and other one we know was Tom Brown that was after the fact but he's one that we've met where we've talked him about that and had discernment and then there's the three prophecies in process and then believe the sign admits to programs gifted a sermon and healings they know it was a reality and now there we looked at the fall accusations there was 32 lot and then a lot of these only five of them though were of these 32 were in the name of the Lord and so those are really the only five we have to look at and so we looked at the brown bear a little bit I'm just gonna review that one real quick we'll look at this one today this one the prophecies of 1933 Russia Vatican and Florence you carrying with that but that was actually fulfilled that was actually fulfilled so with the the brown bear vision the accusation is that thus saith the Lord failed that that's what that's what they believed because brother Ram said it's on tape here I seen a huge brown bear he said it might be a Kodiak would have worked on there in Canada but whatever be it'll be it will be that's thus saith the Lord it will be now I don't have the quotes up here but there's other there's two other quotes or mother man talks about the vision he never says thus saith the Lord but in the vision he actually says he shot the bear and he could see how big it was in the vision but again we have to remember that part he never says was thus saith the Lord he just tells about the vision but notice what he says he says it will be that's thus saith the Lord it will be and now there's other quotes they're too small there that's all of them there and then he says later he says that the vision passed right through and he was left standing and we talked about that last time that brother man was supposed to go with the there was two groups of brothers he was supposed to go with the brothers but he turned it down three times and he didn't see the brown bear but the other brother bran went the other way they saw the brown bear and the brown bear was it was actually there but he disobeyed the vision so he didn't shoot it alright so there's two possible explanations the it I believe it was fulfilled he said it will be it was the brown bear was actually there it was seen by the group of men it manifested and he never said thus saith the Lord about shooting it the vision showed if he would obeyed it he would have shot it but he never said the stay at the Lord I'm going to shoot it he just said thus saith the Lord it will be and it was it actually manifested and number two this vision was conditional like so many other of God's worth like King saw he lost out on the word of promise Joshua's generation I wouldn't say Joshua I want to be very clear on that Joshua didn't fail the generation failed but see he was but he was part of the generation for the generation to possess all the borders the rest of the generation had to keep out idolatry but we saw last time that they didn't drive out all seven they just drove out one the girgashites so they lost out their generation lost out on God's promise it happened later and then millions Church now this is true millions will lose out on the promises of acts 2:38 now I've met numerous what they're called apostolic Christians women that will grow their hair long they'll wear long skirts but then they'll start trimming their hair or their wear where they'll wear makeup yet they speak in tongues yet they prophesy if they have healings and miracles then they're wear high heels and yet they are all baptized in acts 2:38 every one of them and I've met many of those let's see you got a look at their lives too pretty soon they start compromising and their churches start letting down the the standards of Christianity and so they'll fall short many many will fall short of thus saith the Lord so that's where I stand on that I believe with all my heart that it was the brown bear was there and it was in a place it should not have been because God allowed to be there but it was a conditional promise and brother Graham failed on the part and so the part of the vision that he could have fulfilled did not come to pass the vision was right the vision was God's possibility God's conditional promise but he failed the promise and there is no as I said there is no thus saith the Lord that failed because he never said thus saith the Lord I'll shoot it so we got to be very careful with that now the next one there's a a prophecy of brother Branham saying 300,000 will read it here now the accusation is that this thus saith the Lord failed but I've under under the impression that it came to pass brother Graham just didn't understand it okay so here's the here's the quote there are actually four thus saith the Lord's where he says it about the three hundred thousand and he said oh are they all black people and then he turned my face here in front of me to Durman again and there was beautiful white men and women standing with their hands up in the air raising god then he turned me back again in the great light started going way back over the hills and showing then the angel drew near and I heard him scream with the voice that shook me from the vision said there will be three hundred thousand of them in that meeting thus saith the Lord mark it in your book and I come out of it this is in 1952 this is in July 1952 now he says it again in March of 53 and I'm going to a meeting now where there are three hundred thousand will be set and I say this from my heart did you ever hear me predict anything in the name of the Lord but what was exactly that way ask where ever you want to anywhere in the world look at the hundreds of and hundreds of things that he said surely I know what I'm speaking about not for myself Christ in here the next one he said in this angel above me turned on a great big operating light and begin to show back like that and just as far as I could see was nothing but people and it was up over hills and valleys and they look like Indians so look at the vision look like Indians and then when this angel above me speak to the angel that's always with me at my side this big fellow kind of dark complected hair down to his shoulders folded arms he was standing here by my side I heard him tell this one standing by me and the voice was so strong that it broke me out of the vision and said there's 300 thousand of those in that meeting mark that down for us thus saith the Lord his word comes to pass the third one now this is the most direct in jeffersonville in 54 maiya 54 he said mark my word write it in the pages of your Bible for it's thus saith the Lord remember when we land in India you're going to hear of tens of thousands times thousands being saved the Holy Spirit said I've wrote it here in my Bible it's wrote in tens of thousands of Bibles right here like the resurrection of the little boy by a vision that he said there's 300 thousand of them in there and you see if that isn't right there's how the gospel is going to be preached just overnight she'll just sweep like that from place to place now we're going to show a quote now where brother Ram says the 1954 Indian meetings were not the success they should have been because he didn't obey the vision fully so they were supposed to go if I'm not mistaken to Africa first then to India but I think they went to India first and then to Africa and brother ran just and to be fair brother Graham kept looking for the vision of the 300,000 Indians to be fulfilled all the way up to 1965 till the time he died yet here's where ears where I was enlightened yet there are numerous quotes where he said there may have been up to 500 thousands in his meetings in Bombay India there's many many quotes like that so I believe the vision was fulfilled but brother Ram just didn't understand it just like John the Baptist had a vision fulfilled about Jesus you know getting the Holy Ghost but later doubted its fulfillment okay so that is scriptural a prophet can have a vision it comes to pass they believed it for a while but then they doubt it when they get in trials or hardships or something like that they doubt the vision so here is here's the quote he said and I'd been very much a strained constrained to go to India and yet as many of you know the Indian trip wasn't the success that it should have been because I failed to follow the leader leading of the Holy Spirit and never recognized it after he gave me a vision to go up to Africa first and then to India and some of the Brethren said oh we we can't get to Africa so brother Roberts has just been down there so take off to India and under the influence of my brethren well maybe taught but no matter what someone influences you if God has told you something different and now judge it by the word by the word then go so see this is the quote leave the sign we'll use to say see it failed but for some reason uh they never put these quotes on here now here is a quote I'm gonna skip ahead he said I'm going to a tabernacle beginning tomorrow night tomorrow night I'm going to Tabernacle that packed out will hold 64 a two nights meeting that's right Sturgis in Michigan when she's packed out it holds 60 people well I'm just as happy going there as I was in Bombay India to 500,000 it just depends on what the Lord would want you to do I like that pray for me so this is three years after the trip to India so he's already preached a 500 thousand so this is just like the tenth vision I'm gonna show those quotes later at the end here so let me skip past that because let me go to another one now this is in 1958 he said and so the little church that was sponsoring us was insufficient and take care of a place where it was estimated that at the time we were there three days that around five hundred thousand was present and oh I just wouldn't know how many tens of thousands of Mohammedans and everything came to Christ with no way at all to take care of it he had by praise God he said the law just crowd ever had the privilege of preaching to us Bombay India about three years ago five hundred thousand I'm gonna skip down the next quote now here we are probably three or four hundred setting in here tonight look here now I've seen four or five hundred thousand in Bombay India see two hundred seventy five thousand in Durban South Africa so program just gives quote after quote after quote where he says I've seen half a million in India now if we look at if we look at other quotes by the RAM said he exaggerated often okay so I think this five hundred thousand was actually the three hundred thousand from the vision he said was you in Africa Africa that time brother was you there no India see well now maybe I'll get a chance to speak of India was you there when I was in India not there that's when I had my greatest gathering at Bombay five hundred thousand at one time so that's where I seen well I can't go into that he said that he's done so much I tell you it's wonderful there's numerous more all you have to do churches type in Bombay three hundred thousand there's many many more there's probably like five or six more now let me just pull this up real quick on some of the other points I want to make here about this this vision so to me most likely the three hundred thousand vision was already fulfilled so I think brother Adam was just exaggerating on the five hundred thousand and it was actually three hundred thousand as we said it's possible for a prophet to believe a visions come to pass but then doubt it we see that in Scripture as well look at brother Branham also doubted the tenth vision but I believe if you look at other quotes that was already fulfilled I have a quote also her brother Branham says that this three hundred thousand he says will be fulfilled somewhere east of Africa so I hear he says it in 1953 he said mark it in your Bible I don't have this one up here but I just have it on my other document that you will hear that I was in India somewhere east of Africa tan Jenica somewhere where Indians are at somewhere in that Eastern country which I believe will be India itself where there will be 300,000 people either they will be attending the meeting or they'll be there so but at the point I'm trying to show his mother am said or I see so there was a lot of uncertainty about the exact details of the vision but he does report and other people are reporting that he had meetings that were at least two hundred seventy five thousand three hundred thousand he said maybe four hundred thousand maybe five hundred thousand that's the next point I want to make now the last point about this is when I've gone through before but go to first Kings 19 in your Bible first Kings 19 fifteen first Kings 19 fifteen the last point is one actually better let Laura shared with me years ago and he listened to that last sermon I preached on prove all things that's what sister Karen told me and told sister Karen I had some good points there so I was appreciative of that first Kings 19 15 to 17 so it looks like brother branham he had over three thousand people in his Indian meetings within those three-day campaigns so he had to take all the people that attended his meetings in three days and that would have achieved the 300,000 but this scripture speaks of God giving Elijah instructions to anoint three people but he only fulfilled one of them to other people fulfilled the word of the Lord for Elijah after Elijah was raptured so first 19:15 and the Lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus and when thou cometh anoint has yelled to be king over Syria now he did not anoint haseo because who did it eli should did it one will read out a little bit verse 16 and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and he likes you the son of shaphat of a bell mahalo shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room so there's a third one so he's gonna anoint three people has al Jehu and elisha look at verse 17 and this should gonna pass that him that escaped or the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay and him that escaped with a sword of Jehu shall Elijah's slay now you know the only one that he really anointed and this is even interesting too is elijah but it wasn't really elijah laying hands on him Elijah's just went in the rapture and he just said follow me and if you follow me if you don't take your eyes off me you'll get my anointing he really didn't even lay hands on him or anything just the garment fell down from the heavens praise God so we got to be careful that that we try not to interpret these things in our way with our mind or our understanding what happened was a double portion fell upon Elijah from Elijah but Elijah himself didn't lay hands on him and then the anointing came upon him it was God anointing Elijah through the falling down of the anointing through the mantle but God said you're gonna anoint Elisha are you with me Church God said you're gonna know Elijah but he actually didn't lay the hands on him the anointing just left him when he got raptured and it fell upon it Elijah so you have to be very careful how many believe you have to be very careful how you interpret God's Word very cool that's why the Bible said we got to rightly divide the word of truth now Elijah never anointed haseo because Elijah does this go to 2nd Kings 813 now second Kings 813 just to prove this by the Word of God and remember brother Loris told me he heard this from a preacher in Arizona when they used to go out to brother Perry greens church which this was this is a great revelation this is a great revelation that shows God interprets the word the way he wants to God doesn't need anybody in to interpret his word for him second Kings 8 13 and 15 and has he all said but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and Elijah answer the Lord has shown me that thou shalt be king over Syria so he departed from Elijah and came to his master and said to him what said Elijah to the and he answered he told me that thou should it's surely recover and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and has the I'll reign in the stead and the fifth year of Joe Ram the son of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah Jaeho Ram the Son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign thirty and two years old was he beget when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the Lord now here church leaders have to assume that he'll I should did annoy him because we're not told Elijah anointed him right we're not even told Elijah just says the Lord has showed me you'll be king over Syria but does it ever say that he anointed him no it never says that but we have to understand that if God told Elijah that he was going to do it that God meant the anointed ministry that followed Elijah was going to do it never be with me on that one Elijah do it but the anointed ministry or I say this the same Holy Spirit that was on Elijah now is transferred to the next ministry and the next ministry fulfilled it praise God and that's why I church I even believe this I believe people that knew brother Branham message preachers that priests in India I believe that it's possible that even the meetings that they have had over all these years if you add that up to 300,000 I believe that could fulfill the mission - I'm not saying it would but I believe that matches the scripture does every understand it's the same ministry as long as the same Holy Spirit is moving that was on the original one who has the promise was made - as long as the same Holy Spirit is on the next ministry God can use that ministry to fulfill the promise that he told to the Prophet hey then glory amen hallelujah in church I know Randy sighs told me his dad his dad was one of the the first missionaries to ever go to India and he said they had thousands of converts in India thousands Randy sighs told me his dad he would just you know his dad was the pastor and Randy was just preaching brother Randy sighs told me that if I got my story right one day his dad just come in and said Randy you're the pastor I'm going to India and the next day he was pastoring how would you like that church somebody said oh you're to start pastoring tomorrow and they'll give you any heads-up that's just the kind of man he was and now Randy's been passed in there 40 years 40 years so see you can see gods in it by the fruit that it bears and how many thousands see I believe God could have fulfilled brother and his vision through brother Randy sizes dad and also through Knoll Johnson they're still winning souls in India thousands thousands of message churches you add him up look at Sampson Shetty he's preached horse before seeing Souls many souls many churches turning to the message of the hour so if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then we have to allow that even if brother Graham didn't see that 300,000 that God could do it through message preachers in the next generation and we believe that because that's a Bible teaching hallelujah praise God and the Bible don't even say he'll I should anointed him so we have to infer it we have to just believe it because he's there and then he becomes the then haseo becomes King later because we know God's Word cannot fail how many believe God's Word can't fail can't fail God said you you anoint has yell but Elijah never did he said thou anoint haseo and thou shalt anoint Jehu and Elisha never anointed Jehu it was a son of a prophet how about that one how about that God told Elijah you anoint him you anoint J who he never did a son of a prophet did let's read that second Kings nine when the thirty no it's just the next chapter there I'm sorry my hands are really dry part of me and then I blew into the mic here sorry and Elijah the Prophet called one of the children of the prophets and sending him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in that hand and go to ramoth-gilead look one of the just one of the children of the prophets so now it's not Elijah or Elijah it's just a child so a child is fulfilling what God told the prophet Elijah hey how do you praise God amen and when thou cometh thither look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and going and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber then take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith the Lord I have anointed thee king over Israel then open the door and flee and tarry not and so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramoth-gilead hey hey man glory praise God Church ton that lifts your faith a little bit does that lift your faith man that really helps me God told heel idea you're gonna need three he only anointed one of them God used Elijah for Hesse oh and then he used a young prophet to anoint Jehu it wasn't Elijah but it was the same spirit that did it you say well where is that in the Bible revelation 10 the book comes down from heaven and what did any and God tells John to eat it and then God told John go and preach it to every nation - John do that no he didn't that's you and I praise God we're the ones that are supposed to take the revelations of the open book like brother Simon and brother Craig right missionaries go into every country where the ones are supposed to take it and prophesy again but as long as it's the same spirit then God's Word is fulfilled God's prophecies are fulfilled as long as it's the same spirit bringing it to pass amen hallelujah that's good that's wonderful thank God the preacher priest said there that's that's the reason God said brother Loris here I never would have found that I never would have found that God had to several Dolores here to share that revelation with us thank the Lord for that now this is extra I'm gonna share the tenth vision here briefly believe the sign says this vision failed I believe it was already fulfilled though in March of 1963 now here's the tenth mission now I myself I can't remember the Jose maybe can help me out with this I can't find where brother I never spoke the tenth mission and he said the words thus saith the Lord I can't find it I looked ok ok there could be though there could be I just have it Jose and I have not found that as we looked but he tells it of course beginning in 1965 or 56 and continues to tell all the way up to the end now brother branham repeatedly said it would be a physical tent and talked about it all the way up to his death like just months before he died you can hear him saying we're trying to get rent out a farm and we're trying to get the tent set up so we can see this vision coming to pass but he never says thus saith the Lord now I believe it was fulfilled when he preached the seven seals in March of 1963 that's what I believe now here's the vision let's read it this is from Wow January 1st yeah 56 and then he'd taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent I never seen such a tent and it was packed in lined everywhere with people and I looked and I walked out looked like I was standing above the people looking down where I just made an altar call and hundreds of hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior and I looked and then heard a man get up and say call the prayer line now I just thought that with Jose brother branham in the seven seals he did say hundreds of people were baptized that week that's right I just forgot about God amen I know he said that they had hundreds of people being baptized during that week of the seven seals that's right I forgot about that and I looked and then heard a man get up and say call the prayer line and then they had a healing service that's right that a-helix the Monday after the Seventh Seal was Sunday night he stayed over one more day and he recorded that different ending the Seventh Seal and then they had a prayer a healing line that next night I noticed in my left which would have been to my right if I was on the platform a little wooden building and I seen that light that all they have the picture but you know that's always in the meetings I seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third Pole I said why he said well I will it won't be a public show like the other and I came to so the first sign of the hand was the public show everybody in the public saw the second sign was the sermon that was a public show everybody saw it but the third pole was gonna nut was not going to be a public show and I just want you to know program says at the end of the preaching the seventh seal he says and now we're grateful to God for what he has showed us I've been sitting in the room up there for eight days and the message that I've just got through explaining you many of you here will understand and I promise that there was something going on spiritual all the time hallelujah that I was sure you were missing it and here's what it was it was absolute of vindication of this interpretation of the Scriptures being sent from God because before we even went into it and I left to go out west the Lord showed me a vision one day about 10 o'clock in the morning and I come to and explain it here that I'd seen it didn't know what it was it was a constellation of seven angels we'll remember that you'll get it on a tape called what time is it sir well now that is exactly what you're seeing now praise God amen so remember all them all the people random Tabernacle had visions of brother Branham going out west so he went out west he met the constellation of seven angels they said go back and preach the seven seals and open up the seven seals because the lamb opens him up and so he did and then he sat eight days in a room and studied in this private little room and each day the Holy Spirit would meet with him and the voice said I'll meet you in that room amen I hear you praise God and it won't be a public show but I'll meet you in the put in the private room and that was the room where he was studying and seeking God that's right now look what he says anointed ones he says notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message the first pole healing the second bowl prophesy the third pole the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order than to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word yes and remember the third pole was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in no-hair name how did they hear you praise God I believe that Amen that's what I like now I preached this years ago I'm going to bring it out again if you listen to the seventh seal sermons brother Ram says day after day the Holy Spirit would meet him every day to reveal the seal he says in something he says this has been a tremendous week for me I'm tired my mind is tired because I have what the best I could do in something strange going on every day I would be amazed to walk in the room and there be for a few minutes and see something just turn me completely around amen he says that I walked up and down the floor while I said well what is it Lord I kneel down and pray go back pick up the Bible and then all of a sudden when I got quiet here and unfolded like that and I'd grab a pen real quick and go to writing it down whatever I was seeing and doing watching it like that til I got a whole wrote down and then I take the rest of the day and go down and chase this out and see if it tied all the way down through the Scriptures prove all things amen there's our sermon title amen hallelujah thank the Lord well Ram said when he preached the first seal I would have had a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something I was riding down to say praise God he said there about twelve o'clock in the day the Holy Spirit just swept right down to the room the whole thing just opened up to me in the second thing he said the first thing you know something just happens he says and then I grab me a pencil real quick and start writing down as fast and I as I can while he's there hey man so while he's there he shows what his visions it wasn't a public show as a private show of praise God he met him they said I'll meet you in there and I opened the seals and I'll reveal him to you in the third series said but this morning early the Holy Spirit came to where I was just as plain as anything and I've seen this other seal open up just exactly amen he said when it was a real to me early this morning before daylight I went quickly to the scripture and begin to search it up there it is three of them so far has been absolutely supernaturally revealed the forseeable Ram said he said the four seal he says when it goes to breaking forth like that he said I just pick up my pen and start writing he said just stay there maybe four hours till it gets a finish I know that that's God as long as it's comparing Scripture with Scripture praise God amen the fifth seal Boehner said now I want to give thanks to him who's omnipresent that today not knowing one thing about that fifth seal it came in that same mysterious way this morning just about an hour before daybreak that when I was out in prayer amen hallelujah so when did the Holy Ghost come to him while he was praying early in the morning when does God come to you early in the morning yeah that's right praise God early the morning said about an hour before daybreak that's when the Holy Spirit would reveal the Word of God hallelujah the remson why isn't there one here on the fist Hill to announce it as far as a beast here it is according to the revelation that the Lord Jesus gave me today this morning early he said that is the mystery of the church ages are already finished at the time of the fifth seal who gave the revelation the Lord Jesus and he met him in that room amen people just you know it just it's just got to be revealed we just got to wait upon the Lord God will review all these things in time uh he says them revelations in the presence of that ball of fire hang in there in the room he says you never get used to it you can't it's too sacred Wow six see Obama have said something happened today when this seal was revealed til I had to walk completely out in the yard just walk around in the yard a little while that's right it just simply almost took my breath away see so something happened the Holy Spirit came in such a way he had to walk out of the woods house cuz he was staying with the woods the woods family and he had to go out in the yard because it was so powerful see God was meeting with him in a private way and he's gonna do the third seal he's gonna I'm sorry the third Pole he's gonna open up the word to God's people that's right and then brother Ram says of all the times I've been behind the pulpit at the Tabernacle I've never never in any time of my ministry ever worked into the realms of God and the spiritual realms as it's been at this time yeah it's beyond anything I ever did in any time of my ministry in any meeting anywhere anywhere like this mostly it's on healing this is on revealing of truth by the same spirit the same spirit praise God Church he's already seen five hundred thousand people or three hundred thousand a meeting he's seen tens of thousands times tens of thousands get saved but the meeting of the angel in the Holy Spirit with him day after day for all those days in a row was greater than any meetings ever had because he got the meet personally he got to have fellowship he got the SUP with Christ he opened the door and Christ sup with him and he sup with Christ he that's right did you know in the seventh seal brother branham said this is the third pole and there's three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today the other one unfolded today one folded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret it because it was an unknown language when I was standing right there and looked right straight at it and this is the third pole coming up grace God amen hallelujah now what Randy Cius said helped me out so much because Randy size showed me the quote where brother Branham said the angel of the Lord interpreted the the vision and I never knew that and this was this is back when we're on Waterloo Road when I brother Andy sighs come and preach for us this helped me and such and I always knew this quote would be so important I wrote it down and I've saved it and then when it did this one that was standing by me behind me the same voice the Angels voice he said I'll meet you in there and this is the third pole but nobody will know nothing about it I said well I don't understand why I'm there why there he said it will not be a public show this time and I said I don't understand going into that closet like that so brother I'm called the tent a closet Wow Amen honey area at church look at this boat man was just confused he was trying to set up a public tent by the hose they see that but that Lord said it's not going to be a public show amen hey he says it will not be a public show he said it isn't is it not written by our Lord this is what the angel said see I knew where the brother brother Andy was so inspired when he preached this I was like what the angel interpreted the vision for us is it not written by our Lord when thou pray us be not like the hypocrites who like to be a hurdle for men but enter the secret closet and pray to the Father who sees in secret who sees in secret shall reward thee openly it's perfect link to the scripture every time it is Amen hallelujah thank the Lord now that's what I believe with all my heart but believe the sign will say see the tenth mission failed - he never hadn't but yet it had happened already he just didn't understand it praise God that's beautiful see it's the work of the Holy Spirit God and is the own interpreter of his of his own word God is his own interpreter so see because I just thought I'd add in the tape the tenth vision because it was so clear to me this morning I might all the people got to see this the tenth visions already been fulfilled it can't be a published show it can't be out in a physical tent that's why God keep cutting off the tent every time every time the brothers get the read the tent every time it got cut off because it had to fulfill what the angel said amen on it there yeah and then he preached it knowing to ones at the end times not even knowing what he was saying not even probably knowing what he was saying and church did you know there was even great miracles during the seventh seal sermons a boy walked in and this is Rick this is this is a vindicated the Collins family came to the message because God healed their boy he was dying and the Collins family it's the family that used to pass her Brenham Tabernacle he said I'm sure you've noticed that the little Collins boy laying there dying the other night and that little leukemia girl like that week of the seals was so supernatural two children got healed they were gonna die but God healed them why because it was God fulfilling his Lord amen the kingdom of God is coming it's been becoming more from the negative the positive as it has now now that ought to choke people from justification sanctification to the Baptist only ghost then here we're just drawing closer to God all the time so that part of the vision where people are getting healed and prayer lines we got to find that quote on the baptisms let me write that down who's got a pen who's got a pen anybody got a pen real quick can you bring up Lydia let me just write this down so I don't forget all right I'll take that I want to find those quotes from the seven seals thank you where brother have says hundreds of people many people might not be hunters but he said many people were being baptized that would be just a it just be God interpreting his own word just God's grace brother God's grace you know what's so sad about that brother Jose the people will they'll try to interpret themselves and then they'll leave righteousness and they'll go out there and do the evil things that we're taught that s'what breaks my heart they don't even give it a long enough chance if you could see God vindicating in through the gift and discernment we'll just wait upon the Lord maybe that wait upon the Lord renew their strength amen hallelujah that's the part that breaks my heart they they either dfi brother and make every word or they're not waiting long enough and they don't pray about long enough and then they start live an unrighteous ly instead of living godly see God has you there has to be a prophet for every age there's got to be a prophet oh I'm talking about is there's gotta be a prophet like Paul we got to trust in God's prophets amen there's got to be some man God's got to send some man as a prophet to finish the mysteries of God but like I said I just feel like they don't want to tally up to obeying all the Word of God it's nice I'm being nice I'm not being critical I love people praise God I love those who accused brother Graham I love them but I believe that's what's wrong got to wait longer on the Lord wait to the Lord reveals that praise God amen now Church I don't have any slides on this because this would have taken even more hours I spent multiple hours yesterday on this and this morning I just there's not enough time now let me just give you my thoughts in 1958 I believe I could be wrong program starts talking about the vision he had in 1933 okay you know the seven major visions right well what you - if you listen to every time he talks about details change okay so like sometimes to talk about Franklin Delano Roosevelt Roosevelt in World War two and then sometimes they'll talk about with the bubble cars to talk about different things like maybe it's a checkerboard this time and maybe it's something else the next time but then when you come down so there's all these different details and that's what believed the signs upset about there's all these change of details but when you come down the church age book it's very short they just lift lists the ones about you know Mussolini Hitler and all those and so what they're saying is that the say that the Lord changed and I'm saying no they didn't change and here's what was happening cuz I don't have the coaster brother Rams this is over 20 years later he's trying and even says it on tape he's trying to find the original words of the prophecy but he just wrote down all that he can remember I don't know where I don't know if he had a file cabinet I don't know where he kept the prophecies so he's he's going off a memory and he's listing all these details that sometimes the details change but he'll say like this is now saith the Lord so programs he's giving a general statement that what and basically this is what he's saying whatever was said if the first prophecy was the state the lord but he's trying his best to remember all the details but it's it's not the same but overall whatever he was saying in 1933 was thus saith the Lord but see believe the sign says we'll see there's changes so but what they're doing is they're jumping to conclusions they're making every word that he ever said about 1933 prophecies he they're making it all thus saith the Lord but they can't do that brother man wasn't saying that like one got the Maginot Line and the Siegfried line mixed up there's two there were two different lines they weren't the same line there were different walls that were built up they weren't so he gets them mixed up a little bit and then he gets a year's often not every detail was thus saith the Lord but whatever that first prophecy was in 1933 that was thus saith the Lord now I want to share something too this is just my thought I think I preached this here before but you just bear with me if I have I thought I had another yeah I think it's down here just a moment George give me just a second now Church I believe yeah I believe even there with this quote you have to take it as a general thing he says five of these things has been perfectly fulfilled exactly how Mussolini would rise and go to Ethiopia and follow the steps and he would be turned to the people in shame with the woman many many years before it happened perfectly it to the dot and it's never failed and it won't fail because it's thus saith the Lord it's not contrary to these Bible it's got to be now as I can tell I hope you can tell to brother Graham wasn't saying every single word he ever said about the seven major visions was thus saith the Lord it's just like the church ages and the seven seals in marriage and divorce the thus saith the Lord statements are general like he says that marriage and divorce he said it's been thus saith the Lord all the way through well he didn't mean every word he met the revelations that were it contained the sermon right cuz he said Jacob had at least twelve live let's not in the scripture he only had four he promised his father-in-law I don't have four four wives he promised him so he couldn't have more than twelve now here's what the point I want to make I believe only four of them have been fulfilled that could be wrong but I believe only four of them and I don't believe brother am saying this thus saith the Lord I'm just I'm just saying it's his opinion five of them were fulfilled I believe that one about technology is still waiting to be fulfilled they might have the cars but we need a better road system right and that's exact that's what brother Ram said but I said he said I seen an American he said such progress will take place I seen all of me automobiles like the egg going down the street there's cars go down the highway some kind of control they don't have to guide it I see an American family playing checker in the back of their car they've got the car right now if they just had the highways to put it on the little Volkswagens a perfect egg just exactly and it's all the cars can you imagine 1933 what the cars looked like to now okay so I believe the fifth vision still has to be fulfilled I believe that the sixth one was a woman rising up in America but man said it could be a president or vice president he said oh I think it could be the Roman Catholic Church and the whole nations got a bow to her I really thought it was here let her Hillary Clinton but I was wrong I remember that but see even brother Graham says we still don't have the highways but other times he says the fifth one's perfectly fulfilled so we've got to let him be a man so I believe we're still waiting for the fifth one to be fulfilled I believe technology still needs to advance and I think this 5 G's gonna do it that's what I think 5g 5 is Grace I think the 5g is gonna do it because it speeds up information so fast now that now those sensors could have even more it's a lot stronger than 4G it's 5g and they can get all that data and now we can have safe cars but they got to build the highways and what will I did what did Donald Trump run on infrastructure one of his major campaign promises was to rebuild the infrastructure the breaking down highways in America and brother have said if we just had the highways to put it on so that's just my thought church that's my thought but Rams I've of them were fulfilled now personally i just--that's is a I believe that's his opinion I believe we're still waiting for the fifth one to be fulfilled okay so I hope you understand this one now I didn't have the time like I said I spent all all the day setting yesterday on those other ones just to have just to kind of search through the Scriptures and and then the quotes and find all that so to me this one doesn't worry me at all because brother Rama he may he may never have had those original papers I don't know if he ever did like I'm still waiting for a voice of God to put out that black book brother Jose man brother I'm brother I always talk about a black book that had all his visions in the right he wrote him down I'm still waiting for them to put that out I want her sister me to just all threw it away went you know because maybe because all the fanaticism around I wonder I don't know I just wonder because my man said he had a photostatic copy of the king of England's thank you to him for coming to pray for him when he got healed but where's that at oh yeah I've heard you I've heard things like that too if it is I want to see it I don't know if we'll get to but see all these things I don't know what happened to it but that's okay because this doesn't stumble me it's brother man just he's trying to remember everything that was said in 1933 now the Vatican in Rome I don't have this one either but this one's on my video of the future prophecies of William Branham some reason I believe the sign says that this has failed brother BAM said the Russia will destroy the Vatican in one hour thus saith the Lord and they don't even give it time to come to pass I don't know why they think it's failed but brother I never said when it would happen so I don't even know how that could even be a an argument we have to give it time to be fulfilled and then Florence she carrion brother branham his own tape saying thus saith the lord I had a vision she's gonna die now believe the sign says well that's not hard to predict because the doctors only gave her six months to live but the I think I shared this last time that the thing was all these Pentecostals were saying thus saith the Lord she's gonna be healed because she was only 39 years old so that's why the prophecy was so profound because brother ram stood up amongst a bunch of people that were saying the Lord saying healing the Lord sailing healing but man said no the Lord told me she's gonna pass that's why it was so profound and it come to pass but then brother Renton but then they criticized well ran for saying but it's possible God could still healer well it was because of Hezekiah Hezekiah thus saith the Lord set your house in order gonna die god never said when but then isaiah got another though saith the lord time he's got 15 more years now neither of us say the lord contradicted each other they both fit and so it is here it fits as well brother and said thus saith the lord she's going to die but god could change it if they cry out but god never did change it she still passed away and of course it's on tape when program says it before hand he said thus saith the Lord it's on tape and then before hand and then it happened she dies and that's on tape so that is one clear prophecy that did come to pass now let me check real quick here you know recently I got a email from a Missouri message pastor well he he's a former message pastor from Missouri and he asked me a lot more questions and I thought if I had time it would be beneficial to go over these real quick he had eight questions for me and I thought I'd share them with you to kind of close out this series I think that's about all right oh yeah yeah I just got a few more things to say after that yeah so let me just close it out with these things I feel like God has given me all the answers that I need I'm not struggling with anymore in fact the friends names that I mentioned a few weeks ago I've shared all my findings with them and I haven't heard back from them so I'm just praise the Lord you know they don't want to talk about anymore that's wonderful but I know where I stand now praise God in church we have scripture to back us up we have scripture if God gives if God tells a prophet he's gonna do something and it doesn't happen his life God will use somebody else to do it that is thus saith the Word of God praise God God's Word will never fall to the ground amen that's hard for me at church that's hard for me to understand God tells Elijah you're gonna do that all three and he doesn't only does one of them that's hard for me to understand but it's showing God interprets his word differently than you and I he's talking about that spirit that ministry behind the man amen he's not so much focusing on the man he's talking about the spear or the movement behind the man amen now so I got an email and this guy he was very nice but he called me ludicrous he said you're ludicrous to believe that and I said well I think I'm pretty good you did I sound crazy to anybody anybody here think I'm crazy raise your hand don't know Richard yeah I in love I didn't even address it I just let it go it's kinda like water off a duck's back people think I'm crazy I tell you people think I'm crazy for having eight children people think I'm crazy for that I two people joke around with me this week think I'm crazy about but I challenge anybody show me one scripture where God ever shortened a family show me one and I've never had anybody out but I've challenged people I've never had one now one person ever come to me and said oh here's one where God God God was blessing people by giving them less children I never saw that in the scripture that doesn't make you popular the message but I've never been popular anyway so I don't plan to be very popular in a message but the Word of God is our absolute now let's go through eight just kind of quickly I'm just gonna the first one now this is a legitimate church brother random said at least 10 times that just like Adams bride fell Eve Christ bride fell after Pentecost how many I'm gonna raise your have you ever heard those quotes before there's a bunch and so seeing the man it kind of accuses me saying Oh see brother have said how can a bride member fall and I said brother I said that's not what brother Branham means brother brother means there was people around the true bride claiming to be bride that Satan tricked them wolves entered in the flock and the people that were not born again fell away because brother have said when you're born again you're forever eternity never to fail you're a part of God cuz your godson amen praise God so I said brother I said you pastor I said you're just misunderstanding brother Branham brother Branham was doing his best to explain it in his words but brother man taught a bride member can't fall and so when brother man said Christ bride fell he just means the people claiming to be the bride because a Holy Ghost field person if you're sealed you're sealed to the day of your Redemption you cannot fail praise God God's own life God's own ease her life has entered into your soul praise guy you'll never fail but I said just to help you brother I said Hebrews 12:15 says a person can fail the grace of God someone who's just justified or sanctified can fail the grace of God because they turn it down and they do despite the spirit of grace hebrews 10:29 says a person can be sanctified but then do despite the spirit of grace and trodden underfoot the blood of Christ so can a bride member fall no can those people that are claiming to be bride fall yes and that's what I was talking about and the type works perfectly tuberose a Eve was not sealed by the Holy Ghost so she could fall amen she had a holy anointing she was innocent but it was just an anointing it wasn't the seal of the baptism Holy Ghost that's why God had to send the last Adam amen ha ha Jesus Christ to get the baptism of all egos and they said I'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost amen then my bride won't falling in ha ha that's right hallelujah thank the Lord the second one he attacked me and said well I should say attack he disagree with me forgive me the second one he said the church ages cannot be taught in the scripture I said well Colossians 1:26 uses the word ages ages is a Bible word the Bible said the Holy Ghost was hid from ages and from generations and now it's real to you Christ in you the hope of glory so if the Old Testament have ages how can the New Testament not have ages of course it has ages and he was saying that the church the seven letters represent seven different conditions a church can be in and church I'll agree that does make sense that's that's okay for what I mean is you can have a church that's in an Ephesian age they got their first love but then they start falling away I mean if if God's Word is true then we've gone through that stage when we first started in 2006 no doubt we're on fire but then some people may have lost their fire well I know numerous people some people left our church and went out into the world they are examples of that they lost they lost their fire so yes those seven letters can be seven different conditions you can be in but they can also be prophetic praise God to ages and generations and especially the Laodicean because out of her is the rich and increased with Goods and that has to be a church like the United States or the Western churches because I her is spiritual blindness they're lukewarm and out of laodicea comes the mark of the beast and the United States is the beast out of the land in Revelation 13 so I told the brother I said brother I preached over 100 sermons on the book of Revelation and the church ages and the seven seals you can teach us through the Bible you can teach you through history we showed that and so I said I agree the names and dates those dates from you know 1906 to now that's not in the Bible but I said was Martin Luther's name in the Bible was John Wesley's name in the Bible is your name in the Bible no my name is not in the Bible but I'll say that this my husband's name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I'm a part of him right and the whole family is named the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven and earth amen so see I search I'm saying this to brother Jose out this is okay I hope when do this okay I believe even the years of the church ages those don't even have to be thus saith the Lord I believe those could be flexible that's what I believe I believe those could be flexible his mother had never said these dates are thus saith the Lord he never said that so I think even those dates can be flexible what was thus saith the Lord was the revelation behind the letters praise God the rewards right the denunciations all the attributes that are written in Scripture all the attributes were thus saith the Lord praise God the revelation of the seven stars in the hand that is a mystery the Bible said that is a revelation amen but I go is that far as far as saying that I don't even the dates to me don't need have to be thus saith the Lord but the revelations have to be and that's what they are the lukewarm and no longer the mouthpiece of God left for your first love living a name but you're dead that has to be the the Sardis Church age with Martin Luther they were dead right as far as not being born again with her trying to live a name of Christ or Lutheran but they're dead spiritually now Martin Luther has the Baptist the Holy Ghost but the people after him may not have had it because they denominated now he talked about the bridge prophecy the municipal bridge and I agreed I said brother I said I'm only siding with brother Branham I can't prove 16 people died there but I said you can't prove 16 people didn't die there you can't the only way you know is if you sat there and we're it never went to sleep and had a video camera and recorded every single day we could watch every single second of every single day of every single hour you can't they could not prove it so I'm just taking sides brother branham same thing about the vision of the 300,000 not as I went through that I said yeah I said oh and jorgen said he wasn't a first-hand witness I said but neither was anybody else I mean the minister's brother I was talking about on tape I forget their names now Baxter they would have been witnesses my wife said she heard a quote where an official from Bombay told brother Branham it was 500,000 so it wasn't even brother ran those people in the city telling him there's over there's over three hundred thousand people here there was five hundred thousand so see they were the ones at church they can't prove nobody can prove he didn't have three hundred thousand those meetings nobody can prove that so you just got to take his side I'm taking sides with God's prophet because of the word that he taught and the life that he lived and I seen that life same life living in me praise God that's what I see and he didn't agree with my idea about there some are conditional promises of God some are unconditional but I listed and then he said Hananiah when he said two years was like brother branham I said no it wasn't this doesn't apply to brother Branham the 300,000 was fulfilled he just didn't understand it the brown bear was fulfilled because he never said he'd shoot it thus saith the Lord I said we have to be very careful what we make thus saith the Lord very careful I'll be it's like this some people have read first Corinthians 7:2 me where Paul says this is not the Lord this is me and Paul says you know the Virgin's should shouldn't marry and everything and some people will make that thus saith the Lord I've had people email me like that making that and Paul says it's not the Lord it's me and yet they'll try to make that now say it the Lord like you shouldn't encourage your daughters to get ready to be married because Paul is Paul's idea that's the state the Lord just people don't understand it people want to just they want to hang on to their revelation soap or their false revelation so bad but we have to very be very careful what we make thus saith the Lord and remember don't forget yours I'm just showing the ones that are coming against remember there's so many others that were fulfilled that were absolutely right on right especially all the discernments and the sister Humes and all the four tellings of healings and all that that's there's so many that were fulfilled okay some of these I don't think I'll get into I better I better close here oh yeah here's what I want to read brother Graham said the word that fell out on Pentecost will not work today and the brother kind of got upset with that statement brother have said that in choosing him a bride to think as one of his last sermons in 65 and I said not brother I said you need to balance this statement with other statements the point brother branham is making is that Joel 2 was fulfilled in acts 2 right but we are longing we need acts 2 and then but we're doing for isaiah 25:8 1st Corinthians 15:54 and 1st Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 to be fulfilled the body change scriptures in other words mother I'm saying we need more than the matches of the Holy Ghost we need rapture Scriptures amen we need body change scriptures we've got the soul baptism by God's grace but we need more than that we need to fall into the anointing and the prophecy of a body change and then the brother said did you Ram said he he opened up revelations hid from the foundation world I said he did Paul never knew about the seven seals because they were written after he died and the revelation program taught about those four horse riders I've never seen anybody teach anything the same he was the first one to say that the white horse rider was Antichrist and that it was at the beginning of the church age Clare's Larkin said it was at the beginning of the tribulation which is a two thousand year difference that's not the same and yet on their site Church on their site they say brother man plagiarized all the seven seals come on I can show to uni didn't is two as a two thousand year difference the same thing or not it's not see what are they doing they're jumping to conclusions because they're so upset I know and I know people and the message of made mistakes and their churches and it's been very hurtful has been some evil things happen okay let me close let's send our feet let me close of this here what's our responsibility Church to finish the Great Commission redeem the time get under the token prove all things amen I use this years ago when I preached that sermon called waiting for the vision to come to pass nor that sermon I appreciate how to Habakkuk I preached it two sermons here it was right when we had a family coming from brother Samuels and they stayed for us for two services then they left the message completely it was so inspired of the Holy Spirit because it gave him their last I'd be like a last warning Church look at this look at all the scriptures out of being fulfilled right now this is the lamp trimming time this is Malachi four time restoring hearts this is uniting time praise God this is the move is on the bride time this is walking with God time like Enoch amen this is laying in the prints of the son time like Jesus's parable in Matthew 13 amen hallelujah this is preparing for the third pour the latter rain time hallelujah program said God's great mysteries of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about even the Angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the 7c was open there was silence Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the Sun himself don't even know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and John was even forbidden aright at sea the coming of the Lord that's one thing he has a review of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he does it he is showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible 9 therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ hum that entire Bible was an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he went achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing that what God's great goal is and now in this last day has revealed it and shows it and God's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and to try to bring it to the people see and then I haven't had went into details to try to explain it as God revealed to me musicians if you'll come praise God now Church if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask I'll be happy to take any other questions now that to me is the the best answers I have at this time all the other ones is either just it's Broadband's opinion or just it's a minor doctrine nothing major I mean like I said they have 500 pages like those we just went through like maybe five or six they have 500 pages of differences with brother Branham and some of them are genuine concerns like how did he change his doctor from here here but the reality of it is if there are minor doctrines it's okay for him to change his daughter he's growing which one of us have every doctrine right which one of us make no mistakes and we know everything at the beginning of our lives and we don't need to ever grow an understanding and knowledge of the Lord none of us do we all need God's grace how many need God's grace today I need God's grace today I've had battles this week I need God's grace for today I need God's grace for this week coming up Paes grace but I wanted to show you at the end all these types all point to the same thing they're all pointing to the rapture of Jesus Christ's bride it's all pointing to that it's going to be a small group he said as it was the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man praise God thank you lord and there's a group that will live righteously in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the appearing of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as we bow our heads I just want to thank the Lord thank you Lord for helping me with these questions and I realized - I did study them a little bit but some of them I never studied very very thoroughly some of them I never studied at all the Lord in my hour of shaking in my hour of testing and trials Lord God thank you for holding me thank you for pointing me back to the word especially

listening Lord bless those live streaming hopefully are their friends who attend this church Lord heard the word strengthen encouraged by it dear Connie [Music] Rodan if this should be the last one it
