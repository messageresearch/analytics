[29:48] and it's uh
[29:51] it's actually what i'm going to be
[29:52] dealing with
[29:55] amen
[29:57] so in psalm psalms 100
[30:00] in verse 4
[30:07] amen
[30:08] psalms 100 and verse 4 it says enter
[30:11] into his gates with thanksgiving
[30:13] and into his course with praise
[30:16] it says be thankful unto him and bless
[30:18] his name
[30:20] amen father we thank you for your
[30:24] life lord we thank you for everything
[30:26] that you give to us from yourself
[30:29] father it's what we need
[30:31] and you're all that we need lord
[30:34] and within our lives the journey that
[30:36] you've set for each one of us
[30:38] you've brought each one of us to that
[30:39] place lord of realizing that you are all
[30:42] that we need we don't need anything else
[30:44] uh you are the all-sufficient god
[30:47] and we're grateful lord for many things
[30:49] and i'm grateful lord tonight or this
[30:52] afternoon for this song that was just
[30:54] sung
[30:55] lord you know how fitting it is to
[30:57] what's on my heart
[30:58] so i just pray that you would help us
[31:00] now this is your time and we are your
[31:02] people have your way amongst us we pray
[31:05] in jesus christ holy and precious name
[31:07] we ask it
[31:08] amen
[31:10] amen you may be seated saints god bless
[31:12] you
[31:14] praise the lord
[31:24] amen so i want to go also to luke
[31:27] chapter 17.
[31:30] starting at verse 11.
[31:37] it says and it came to pass as he went
[31:40] to jerusalem that he passed through the
[31:42] midst of samaria and galilee
[31:44] and as he entered into a certain village
[31:46] there met him ten men that were lepers
[31:49] which stood afar off and they lifted up
[31:51] their voices and said jesus master
[31:54] have mercy on us
[31:56] and when he saw them he said unto them
[31:58] go show yourselves unto the priests and
[32:01] it came to pass that as they went
[32:03] they were cleansed
[32:05] and one of them when he saw that he was
[32:07] healed it says turn back and with a loud
[32:10] voice glorified god
[32:12] and fell down on his face at his feet
[32:14] giving him thanks
[32:16] and he and he was a samaritan
[32:18] and jesus answering said he says where
[32:21] there are not ten cleanse but where are
[32:23] the nine
[32:24] it says they are not found that return
[32:27] to give glory to god save this stranger
[32:30] and he said unto him arise go thy way
[32:32] thy faith has made thee whole
[32:35] amen so tonight for a topic i just kind
[32:37] of want to
[32:39] for a short period of time just deal
[32:40] with a topic of being grateful
[32:44] amen being grateful
[32:47] just like being humble
[32:49] being grateful also is important to god
[32:52] it's important to god that we show
[32:55] gratitude
[32:56] to him no matter what it is that he does
[33:00] for us no matter how big or how small
[33:02] god wants us to always be in a mindset
[33:05] of gratitude
[33:06] right uh now what god doesn't like is
[33:09] complaining
[33:12] he says do all things without murmuring
[33:14] isn't that right now satan knows that
[33:16] right so because he knows that and guess
[33:19] what he tries to get us to do
[33:22] murmur and complain isn't that right
[33:24] because he's always trying to get us to
[33:26] go against god
[33:27] i mean he wants us to displease god he
[33:30] wants to to uh to create a displeasing
[33:32] atmosphere around us that he knows that
[33:35] god isn't welcomed in
[33:37] isn't that right
[33:38] but
[33:39] uh as a point on that let's go to
[33:41] numbers chapter 21
[33:43] and verse four
[33:45] now as we go here i want us to keep
[33:48] something in mind
[33:49] uh the
[33:51] the people of god israel right
[33:54] uh
[33:55] their whole journey in the wilderness
[33:59] according to the scripture
[34:01] it was actually ordained of god
[34:05] god said i i'm the one that made you
[34:08] to thirst
[34:09] i'm the one that suffered you to hunger
[34:12] right
[34:13] i'm the one that calls you these 40
[34:15] years to dwell in the wilderness
[34:17] he says but i did this to prove you to
[34:19] see what was in your heart he says to
[34:21] humble you
[34:22] he says and to bring you to a place
[34:25] that you know that man don't live by
[34:27] bread alone
[34:28] but by every word that proceeds out of
[34:31] the mouth of god
[34:32] isn't that right so their whole journey
[34:34] in the wilderness was actually planned
[34:36] by god
[34:38] amen how about when we go through our
[34:40] dry times our rough times our wilderness
[34:42] experiences per se
[34:44] amen how many realize that's the hand of
[34:46] god in our lives to achieve those same
[34:49] purposes he says i want to see if you
[34:51] love me or not
[34:54] amen i want to prove you i want to see
[34:56] what's in your heart
[34:58] amen he's i want to humble you
[35:01] amen so god in all of his his wisdom
[35:03] he's he's he's established us in these
[35:06] paths of life and every bit of our path
[35:09] is for a significant reason
[35:12] amen god is achieving something even in
[35:14] the times like we said this morning that
[35:16] don't feel so good
[35:18] amen but yet his hand is in and it's
[35:20] something beautiful that he's bringing
[35:21] out of it
[35:22] you might not be able to see it and
[35:24] appreciate it in that moment but give it
[35:26] time he'll go back and show you in
[35:29] retrospect this was my hand and this is
[35:31] what i was this is what i was doing in
[35:33] your life
[35:34] isn't that right so in numbers chapter
[35:36] 21 and verse 4 it says and they
[35:38] journeyed from mount hor
[35:40] by the way of the red sea
[35:42] to accomplish the land of edom it says
[35:45] and the soul of the people was much
[35:47] discouraged because of the way
[35:49] it says numbers 21-5 it says and the
[35:51] people spake against god and against
[35:53] moses wherefore have ye brought us up
[35:56] out of the out of egypt to die in the
[35:58] wilderness so now that was the devil
[36:00] working in their minds
[36:02] amen
[36:04] and i'm saying that in that way because
[36:05] that's how these are the same things we
[36:08] experience
[36:09] as you're in the heat of a situation a
[36:11] trial or a tribulation of some sort in
[36:13] your life the devil has a way in which
[36:16] he wants you to view your situation
[36:18] amen and he wants you to begin to feel
[36:21] like you know it's a hopeless situation
[36:24] like
[36:25] i don't see how any good is going to
[36:26] come out of this and you begin to maybe
[36:28] sometimes get discouraged and you begin
[36:31] to make your attitude begins to slip
[36:33] right
[36:34] you understand what i'm saying now you
[36:36] begin to get a little edgy irritable
[36:38] because of what you're going through you
[36:40] don't want because you don't understand
[36:42] it for one right the enemy want to make
[36:44] sure he want to make you frustrated
[36:47] right and that's how they were because
[36:49] as they were going through these
[36:51] situations and coming in contact with
[36:52] this these paths that god has
[36:54] established for them they didn't
[36:56] understand it it didn't feel good but
[36:58] god was proving them
[37:00] but look at the attitude that began to
[37:02] be expressed
[37:04] look at how they begin to view their
[37:06] situation and look at how they allowed
[37:08] the enemy to cause them to slip
[37:11] into a negative frame of mind
[37:15] to the point to now no matter what it
[37:17] was they saw they were seeing it in such
[37:19] a way all they could do was complain
[37:22] notice this now
[37:24] and the people speak against god
[37:28] i've seen people go through certain
[37:30] situations and they begin to question
[37:32] god
[37:34] many times they know better they've been
[37:36] taught better
[37:37] you understand what i'm saying and we're
[37:39] not immune to those things
[37:41] like i said i mean that's why i'm i'm
[37:43] ministering to i'm this is for myself as
[37:45] well because even like i told brother
[37:47] jesse even though we're ministers we
[37:49] find ourselves in places at times where
[37:52] a little amnesia sets in
[37:54] amen we know better we know there is a
[37:56] devil and how he tries to operate or
[37:58] whatever but sometimes you forget about
[38:00] those things and you don't realize it's
[38:01] a devil talking to your mind
[38:04] you understand you think it's just you
[38:06] huh
[38:07] it brings it into a natural realm and
[38:09] that's what he wants he wants us just to
[38:11] look at the natural keep looking at
[38:13] things on eye level and never be able to
[38:15] look up
[38:16] to be able by god's grace to see the
[38:17] bigger picture and what's really going
[38:19] on
[38:20] so they got caught up in that humanistic
[38:22] realm and all they can see is just a
[38:24] natural part of life and they see that
[38:27] they had lack and as a result of that
[38:29] they began to actually speak against god
[38:32] that's a very foolish thing
[38:35] right but yet
[38:36] it happens even today
[38:39] and against moses wherefore have he
[38:41] brought us up out of egypt to die in the
[38:43] wilderness god already made them a
[38:45] promise so you're going to go into the
[38:47] promised land
[38:48] you understand what i'm saying but look
[38:50] at how how now and this ain't even a
[38:53] real heavy trial right here
[38:55] they just don't have a few conveniences
[38:58] huh
[38:59] how many times we desire to have a
[39:01] certain lifestyle or maybe have certain
[39:03] things in life and we don't have it
[39:05] certain little conveniences that god
[39:07] don't like don't allow us to have at
[39:09] certain times and the enemy want to
[39:10] cause us to go into these mindsets
[39:14] why can't i have this why is it so
[39:15] difficult for me to have that why is it
[39:17] so hard for me to be able to achieve
[39:19] this
[39:20] and if we're not careful we begin to
[39:22] become ungrateful
[39:25] you understand what i'm saying the devil
[39:26] want to make you look so much at what
[39:28] you don't have and what's not going
[39:30] right until you can't give god proper
[39:32] praise for what you do have and what
[39:34] he's doing currently in your life
[39:37] isn't that the devil's objective to
[39:38] cause us to look completely beyond what
[39:40] god is doing and look at everything we
[39:42] don't have it ain't going right and
[39:44] that's what causes mindsets to shift
[39:46] like that
[39:48] and in the midst of when you're supposed
[39:49] to give god praise and should be giving
[39:51] god praise for being able to give you
[39:53] food to eat
[39:55] provide a job for you to be able to work
[39:57] and make money to take care of the
[39:58] necessary things in life
[40:00] like we said this morning to give god
[40:02] thanksgiving just for having good health
[40:05] being able to be able-bodied people
[40:07] that's not paralyzed or you you live to
[40:10] see another day many people died
[40:12] yesterday many people died last night
[40:14] that was brother jesse talking about the
[40:16] football player that died what yesterday
[40:19] he's gone now
[40:21] but god allowed us to be here and if he
[40:24] allowed us to be here guess what that
[40:25] means our purpose isn't finished yet
[40:28] but there are so many things to give god
[40:30] thanksgiving for so when we read in
[40:32] psalms chapter 100 when god says enter
[40:35] into his courts with
[40:36] what thanksgiving
[40:39] now god knew his people had issues going
[40:42] on
[40:42] they had spiritual battles going on
[40:45] everybody wasn't rich everybody didn't
[40:47] have easy streets you understand what
[40:49] i'm saying but god is saying no matter
[40:51] what's going on in your life i don't
[40:53] care what's right what's wrong or what
[40:55] have you when you come to my house i
[40:57] want you to come to my house with a
[40:58] mindset of gratitude amen and don't
[41:02] think about what you don't have don't
[41:03] think about everything that's going
[41:05] wrong when you enter into my gates i
[41:07] want to hear thanksgiving come out of
[41:08] your mouth
[41:11] because i don't care what's wrong i'm
[41:12] the one that's able to make it right
[41:15] i'm able to give you comfort in your
[41:17] mind i'm able to give you peace in your
[41:19] soul
[41:21] i'm able to give you what you can't give
[41:22] yourself
[41:24] but if you approach me in the right way
[41:25] you'll be able to see my hand move
[41:27] mightily on your behalf in your life
[41:31] you understand what i'm saying but it's
[41:32] the attitude that creates the atmosphere
[41:35] brother branham says when you come to
[41:37] god would it the right mental attitude
[41:39] toward any one of his promises he says
[41:41] your attitude would help to bring it to
[41:43] pass
[41:45] why because it produces an atmosphere of
[41:47] faith
[41:49] something that god is looking at in the
[41:50] midst of his child his child going
[41:52] through all kinds of difficulties and
[41:54] god see you in the midst of your trial
[41:56] giving lifting up your voice to give him
[41:57] praise
[41:59] he see that gratitude that gratefulness
[42:02] you tell me brother jesse the parents
[42:05] that are in here when you're shy when
[42:07] your child is grateful when you see
[42:09] gratitude and your child is grateful
[42:12] even for the smallest things they
[42:14] receive huh well how do they make you
[42:16] feel as a parent
[42:18] you understand you get mad lord thank
[42:20] you
[42:21] my child get the picture
[42:23] they understand that life ain't easy and
[42:26] for the little things that they're able
[42:28] to receive lord they're able to give
[42:30] thanksgiving and be grateful and
[42:31] genuinely be happy
[42:33] you understand what i'm saying
[42:35] so how much more god when he sees us
[42:38] being grateful and thankful even for the
[42:40] little things that we have
[42:44] sometimes god will get you comparing
[42:45] yourself against other people
[42:48] you pass you go through these nice
[42:50] neighborhoods sometimes
[42:53] and you you know you just kind of go off
[42:55] in your imagination man that house right
[42:57] there is nice man it'd be nice to have
[42:59] that
[43:00] but if you ain't careful the enemy is
[43:01] slipping they say why ain't got a house
[43:03] like that
[43:04] why i can't be like that
[43:06] well i can't have a car like so and so
[43:09] and when listen now when those things
[43:11] begin to settle in like that you know
[43:13] you know what begins to happen you begin
[43:14] to become dissatisfied with what you do
[43:17] have
[43:18] and depending on the attitudes you have
[43:20] toward what you do have that's that
[43:22] determines how you treat it
[43:26] if you ain't grateful for the car you
[43:28] got guess what you ain't gonna wash it
[43:31] you ain't gonna keep the maintenance up
[43:32] on it you don't get the oil changed why
[43:34] you don't even want the car
[43:36] huh
[43:37] but god is watching you the whole time
[43:39] because he gave you that car
[43:42] you understand what i'm saying he's
[43:44] looking to see how you handle what he
[43:46] gives to you
[43:48] because once once he sees that you can
[43:50] have a right attitude to what he has
[43:52] provided and that makes him want to do
[43:54] more
[43:55] he knows the desires of your hearts
[43:56] isn't that right saints
[43:58] but many times he'll give us amen
[44:00] sometimes what he wants us to have that
[44:02] time but it's a test for us
[44:05] for these reasons right here he want to
[44:08] teach us to be grateful
[44:10] and once we pass that test once he sees
[44:13] that we can really become thankful for
[44:14] whatever it is he provides for us man
[44:17] that make him want to come and do more
[44:19] for us
[44:24] notice this though
[44:26] this wasn't their mind
[44:28] they saw a little lack of little
[44:30] inconvenience and here in verse 15 verse
[44:32] 5 it says and the people speak against
[44:34] god and against moses wherefore have ye
[44:37] brought us up out of either to die in
[44:38] the wilderness but there is no bread
[44:40] neither is there any water now notice
[44:42] what they say here now
[44:45] he says they say in our soul
[44:47] loatheth this light bread
[44:50] you know what i was you know what that
[44:51] means they detested it
[44:54] they were very dissatisfied
[44:57] why we couldn't have better than this
[45:02] as parents you provide to your child for
[45:05] your children what you can
[45:07] but whenever you have a child that'll
[45:09] sit there and because of what you
[45:10] provide isn't what they exactly want
[45:13] and they turn up their mouth
[45:17] they put i don't want that
[45:19] huh
[45:21] what you don't want that
[45:23] you know there's children over there
[45:24] don't even have clothes on their backs
[45:27] one time a day they get a bowl of rice
[45:31] huh
[45:33] and because you don't have exactly what
[45:34] you want you're going to allow yourself
[45:36] to become dis dissatisfied with what's
[45:39] been provided
[45:42] god gave them manner they had food and
[45:44] this was this was better than what they
[45:46] had they didn't they didn't realize it
[45:48] though
[45:49] right because it came directly from the
[45:51] hand of god it was so pure
[45:54] amen it was they called it kosher
[45:57] clean i mean it was clean eating it was
[45:59] the best thing they needed for the
[46:01] journey that they were in
[46:03] isn't that right but yet the devil in
[46:05] their minds made them look upon what god
[46:07] provided
[46:09] and detested
[46:13] we don't want to fall into that same
[46:14] channel
[46:16] isn't that right
[46:17] no matter what it is that god provides
[46:19] us you might not have steak to eat you
[46:21] might not have choice meats or choice
[46:24] clothes or the finest fabrics or the
[46:25] finest cars but whatever you do have
[46:28] show god you appreciate it
[46:30] see lord thank you for my house thank
[46:32] you for my call thank you for my family
[46:34] thank you for my clothes thank you for
[46:36] my job lord the song you guys just saw
[46:39] lord i thank you
[46:41] i give you praise father god
[46:44] and that make him want to come right
[46:45] down in the midst of us and just amen
[46:48] just shower us with his glory with his
[46:50] presence and just do things for us that
[46:53] nothing in this world could ever touch
[46:59] and the lord sent fiery serpents among
[47:01] the people
[47:03] and they bit the people
[47:05] and much people of israel died why
[47:08] because they were complaining
[47:12] isn't that something
[47:13] a little complaint a little shifting of
[47:15] the thought
[47:17] of you projected by the devil into the
[47:19] people's minds cause people's lives to
[47:22] be taken
[47:24] how serious is that
[47:26] but yet for you know the devil want to
[47:27] make it seem like a light thing
[47:30] you understand what i'm saying we kind
[47:31] of just kind of toss these little things
[47:33] about lightly like they all mean nothing
[47:34] to god but god looking right at us every
[47:36] time listen and it might not be all
[47:38] together what you show outwardly
[47:41] god sees your inward reactions too
[47:45] we guilty of it right yes sir
[47:48] like say for answers at christmas time
[47:49] somebody give you a gift you don't
[47:51] really like
[47:56] oh you get the gift
[47:59] as soon as you see it you're like man
[48:03] but you
[48:04] smile you say thank you
[48:07] give him a hug
[48:10] but that inward response
[48:12] you understand what i'm saying see we
[48:14] can't do god like that because he looks
[48:16] beyond all the outward show and he looks
[48:19] right down at that real response of the
[48:20] heart
[48:21] and god hears beyond the smile lord i
[48:24] don't like that
[48:27] huh
[48:28] so now this brings it into a little
[48:30] deeper place because in order to be
[48:31] really grateful that's actually a place
[48:33] that god got to bring you into
[48:38] can we say praise the lord saying yes
[48:42] notice here in uh
[48:45] this is very interesting here now all
[48:47] right i want to go to luke 6
[48:49] right
[48:51] but as i touch on luke 6 just going back
[48:54] to just
[48:55] our opening scripture here or rather the
[48:58] one that we just read concerning the
[49:00] lepers
[49:01] right
[49:03] now
[49:04] those leopards you had 10 of them
[49:08] the bible doesn't tell us how long they
[49:10] were in this condition
[49:11] but we know what comes along with being
[49:13] a leper to a certain degree for the most
[49:16] part we're familiar with some of it
[49:17] right as a leper you were isolated
[49:21] right
[49:22] you couldn't freely mingle amongst the
[49:24] people and neither did people want you
[49:25] to be around them because
[49:27] of the condition
[49:29] right so you are isolated from amongst
[49:30] the people you had a very difficult life
[49:33] because not only were you isolated you
[49:35] were suffering in your body
[49:37] right this illness this sickness takes a
[49:39] whole and it begins to break down the
[49:41] body in certain ways and many times
[49:43] people lose limbs and stuff like that
[49:45] right so you got these 10 men we don't
[49:47] know how long they were in this
[49:48] condition but yet i'm sure they had
[49:50] heard about the testimonies of jesus
[49:52] christ
[49:54] right obviously because when they saw
[49:56] him and they knew that it was him that
[49:57] was coming look at what they did they
[49:59] cried out for mercy they called him
[50:01] master
[50:02] amen
[50:04] these are key points now yes
[50:07] they saw him come and they wanted relief
[50:09] from their condition
[50:11] and they called him master
[50:15] but now he called the master and he knew
[50:17] what they wanted and he told them go
[50:20] show yourself to the priest
[50:22] and the bible says as they turn to go in
[50:25] obedience to his command all of them
[50:27] were healed
[50:30] but even though they all were healed
[50:31] only one who was a samaritan came back
[50:34] once he saw he was healed to give him
[50:36] glory to give him praise
[50:39] but notice this now this is god in flesh
[50:41] and look at what god chose to pay
[50:43] attention to
[50:45] now notice he healed all of them as we
[50:47] read here in luke 6 chapter 35 it says
[50:50] beloved your enemies and do good and
[50:52] lend hoping for nothing
[50:54] nothing again and your reward shall be
[50:56] great and i didn't know i
[51:00] i've always operated by a certain thing
[51:03] just so i can help myself and the
[51:05] individual that i'm helping helping to
[51:07] be relieved of of certain pressures
[51:11] somebody might have a need for something
[51:13] right and if i have it i'll have no no
[51:15] problem helping them to be able to if
[51:18] it's financial or whatever you know but
[51:19] whatever i give i give it and i don't
[51:22] want you to return anything back to me
[51:24] because if you have a need for it now
[51:26] that means that when it's time for you
[51:28] to pay me back you may not be able to
[51:30] really afford to pay me back but you
[51:32] will try to out of your lack
[51:34] and i don't want to put the person back
[51:35] in that same situation that they were in
[51:37] when they had the bar in the first place
[51:39] so if i let somebody have something you
[51:41] have in it you don't have to worry about
[51:42] paying me back
[51:44] and that helps to relieve me also from
[51:46] having mind battles that this person
[51:48] borrowed something from me and they
[51:49] ain't tried to pay it back yet
[51:53] so you can have it
[51:55] amen and the bible actually says
[51:58] praise the lord it says lynn hoping for
[52:00] nothing again
[52:04] and god know why he's doing that
[52:06] right it says and your reward shall be
[52:08] great and ye shall be the children of
[52:10] the highest because this is how he
[52:12] operates right but notice what it says
[52:14] here it says for he is kind unto the
[52:17] unthankful
[52:20] so notice this now when he healed those
[52:23] ten men before he even healed them he
[52:25] already knew nine of them were
[52:27] ungrateful
[52:29] but he healed them anyway
[52:32] all ten
[52:34] and when the one came back he already
[52:36] knew nine wasn't coming back
[52:39] but for the sake of the scriptures
[52:41] he went ahead and just expressed the
[52:43] whole thing and said wasn't that ten how
[52:45] come where's the other nine at
[52:47] he already knew where they were
[52:49] they were going on with their normal
[52:51] lives again
[52:54] unthankful
[52:56] ungrateful
[52:57] it means a lot when you when you know
[53:00] somebody asks you to help them to do
[53:01] something or whatever to do something
[53:03] for them or whatever and you help them
[53:05] you know even amongst brothers and
[53:06] sisters how that didn't make you feel
[53:08] good when your brother or sister say
[53:09] thank you
[53:11] that's right
[53:12] even for parents to children the
[53:14] children that turn into the parents
[53:15] thank you mom thank you dad
[53:18] and for the children also for the
[53:20] parents you know you do a little
[53:21] something you like to be able to the
[53:23] parents to say thank you
[53:25] that makes you feel good
[53:27] right
[53:28] these nine men didn't even turn around
[53:30] and say thank you
[53:33] he re
[53:35] all right let's go a little deeper
[53:37] the word gratitude what does it mean
[53:40] gratitude means the quality of being
[53:42] thankful
[53:43] it means readiness to show appreciation
[53:46] for
[53:47] and to return kindness
[53:49] isn't that what the one that turned that
[53:51] return did
[53:52] he was ready to show appreciation
[53:55] what does appreciate means appreciate
[53:57] means to recognize the full worth of
[54:01] so once he was healed
[54:03] by the grace of god he recognized the
[54:05] full worth that was in christ
[54:08] and he turned around to give
[54:09] appreciation
[54:11] amen to the one that healed him amen
[54:14] listen now don't notice this now all
[54:16] right appreciate means to recognize the
[54:18] full worth of to understand the worth or
[54:22] importance of something or someone
[54:25] then thankful thankful means being
[54:27] pleased and relieved
[54:31] being relieved means no longer feeling
[54:33] distressed or anxious
[54:35] reassured so christ relieved those
[54:39] lepers of the condition they were
[54:41] suffering with for so long
[54:44] you understand what i'm saying he
[54:46] pleased them and he relieved them but
[54:48] the nine didn't even want to turn back
[54:50] around and give him appreciation
[54:52] recognizing his full worth
[54:54] they went on as though
[54:56] he was known i mean once they got what
[54:58] they got they didn't even care no more
[55:01] the lord don't like that
[55:04] amen
[55:05] god don't want us to deal with one
[55:06] another like that
[55:08] right
[55:08] isn't that right god god is mindful of
[55:11] how we handle one another and how we
[55:12] respond and react to things
[55:15] amen
[55:16] he was paying close he said where where
[55:18] are the other nine at now i healed ten
[55:22] and only one stranger came back to say
[55:24] thank you
[55:27] notice what our prophet says here
[55:29] i love this
[55:31] amen this is in the message of uh
[55:39] where are we at
[55:41] this is the message message of who is
[55:43] this
[55:44] but before i before i touch that i'm
[55:46] gonna read to you this this is the
[55:47] message of without money and without
[55:49] price brother branham says in any man or
[55:52] woman that's born of the spirit of god
[55:54] and receives the holy ghost listen to
[55:55] this now
[55:57] any man that's born of the spirit of god
[55:59] and receives the holy ghost will always
[56:02] be thankful
[56:05] that's a quality that the holy spirit
[56:06] brings into a person's life
[56:09] he says they will always be thankful
[56:11] watch he says no matter whatever happens
[56:13] you will be grateful
[56:17] huh
[56:18] see the holy ghost is god himself coming
[56:20] inside of a person's life and you begin
[56:21] to have the mind of god
[56:23] you understand what i'm saying and this
[56:25] is something that god introduced into
[56:26] his sons and daughters lives
[56:29] you will be a grateful people
[56:31] nobody ain't got to remind you to be
[56:32] thankful
[56:33] amen it comes from your soul knives by
[56:36] nature
[56:37] you understand that amen so now this
[56:39] particular message here is called who is
[56:41] this he says and as he come riding like
[56:44] riding in right he says lots of people
[56:47] said he's a healer oh we we seen him
[56:50] open the eyes of the blind we seen him
[56:52] make the crippled man to walk he says we
[56:55] seen him off a prayer and a fever left
[56:57] the child it says but then those type
[57:00] were only following him for the loaves
[57:02] and the fishes
[57:05] you have people that follow god only for
[57:07] the good things they can get out of him
[57:09] they don't really have a heart to give
[57:11] their hearts to them
[57:14] you understand what i'm saying
[57:18] there's a message brother jesse that's
[57:19] kind of
[57:20] been in the back part of my mind for a
[57:22] while
[57:25] it's a strange title the categories of
[57:27] the world
[57:30] you know because
[57:32] different people fall into different
[57:34] categories
[57:36] you know
[57:37] strange topic
[57:38] he ain't gave me the okay yet
[57:43] so i'm just holding it until the lord
[57:44] tell me okay
[57:46] but notice this now
[57:48] he says and that's the way the crowds
[57:50] are today many he says if there's a
[57:53] healer they follow him it says he's just
[57:55] an oasis it says if they get sick they
[57:58] run say oh will you please pray for me
[58:01] that the lord jesus will make me well
[58:03] and as soon as they come out of the
[58:05] hospital or the sick bed right back into
[58:08] the things of the world they go like a
[58:10] dog to its vomit he says oil or a hulk
[58:12] to its wallet as the scripture says just
[58:15] follow him for what good they can get
[58:17] out of him
[58:19] right
[58:20] it says they just use him for like a
[58:23] totem pole
[58:24] something like that he said that they
[58:25] can get from him and don't expect to
[58:28] serve him the crowd still goes on today
[58:31] he says
[58:33] there were nine lepers healed and one
[58:36] returned to give him praise he says or
[58:38] was it 10 he says they he says one of
[58:40] them returned to give him praise and the
[58:42] rest of them went ahead he says
[58:45] ungrateful
[58:47] he says listen i'm sorry he says in a
[58:50] paragraph 45 it isn't what we do he says
[58:53] it's what he has done for us nothing
[58:56] that we could do to merit anything he
[58:59] says who could we the unrighteous ones
[59:01] ever do anything to merit something
[59:03] before the great jehovah god and his
[59:06] great supreme holiness see we only thing
[59:09] we can do is accept and be grateful for
[59:12] what he has already done for us he says
[59:14] it's so simple
[59:17] so god is looking for for a grateful
[59:19] heart
[59:20] he want us to be grateful no matter what
[59:22] it is that that that that we face in
[59:25] life or whatever you might be having
[59:27] your hardest time most difficult moments
[59:29] but god allows those things to come to
[59:31] test us
[59:33] amen he's proving us he's established
[59:36] he's he's he's ridding us of things
[59:37] that's not right not good bad habits bad
[59:40] ideas bad thoughts right he's
[59:42] deprogramming us and he's reprogramming
[59:45] us amen he's getting our thinking right
[59:48] he's getting our lives recalibrated
[59:51] if you understand what that means
[59:54] my manufacturing friends they understand
[59:56] that
[59:57] you got to you got to calibrate an
[59:59] instrument to get it working right
[1:00:02] amen and make sure it's reading
[1:00:03] everything right from that point but god
[1:00:05] got to recalibrate our minds because it
[1:00:07] can get off sometimes
[1:00:09] thinking our views can get a little
[1:00:12] twisted got to realign everything
[1:00:16] praise god
[1:00:17] amen i'm gonna end with this note right
[1:00:19] here saints in the message of
[1:00:20] conferences brother branham says
[1:00:22] sometimes i wonder if we don't do a
[1:00:24] little bit too much complaining
[1:00:28] when everything isn't quite right
[1:00:30] quite like we wanted
[1:00:41] a little too much complaining
[1:00:46] it's nothing wrong with wanting your
[1:00:47] life to be structured in a certain way
[1:00:49] to have certain things or whatever you
[1:00:51] know
[1:00:52] and to the young adults
[1:00:55] just by experience
[1:00:57] everything don't go the way that you
[1:00:59] plan
[1:01:01] well i'm gonna go to such-and-such
[1:01:02] school i'm gonna do such and such thing
[1:01:04] it's good to plan but just put god first
[1:01:08] right he said lean not to your own
[1:01:10] understanding but in all your ways
[1:01:12] acknowledge him he said he'll direct
[1:01:13] your paths
[1:01:15] but his path for you may not be
[1:01:17] according to your desire and he has to
[1:01:19] he has to he has to work with you and
[1:01:21] bring you to a place to where you can be
[1:01:23] all right with that
[1:01:27] because my i
[1:01:28] i think my life was going to be like
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:31] career-wise and different things you
[1:01:33] know
[1:01:34] but early on the lord had to humble me
[1:01:37] you had to bring me to a place to
[1:01:39] realize life ain't about all what you
[1:01:41] want
[1:01:42] it's about what i want
[1:01:44] it's about what my purpose is for you
[1:01:47] and no matter where that might be you
[1:01:49] might end up living someplace you never
[1:01:50] would have thought of before
[1:01:52] i didn't know i was going to be back in
[1:01:54] south carolina i was ready to branch out
[1:01:56] after growing up there for all my life
[1:01:58] had i already had a job set in north
[1:02:01] carolina already hired and everything
[1:02:03] and on my way across country me and my
[1:02:05] wife to go there
[1:02:07] i was in oklahoma or in texas or
[1:02:09] somewhere and my i just changed my mind
[1:02:12] and saying i ain't going to the job
[1:02:16] thought i had something better waiting
[1:02:17] for me back at home and then once i got
[1:02:19] home the job i got was making less than
[1:02:21] the one i passed off
[1:02:23] i thought i made a mistake
[1:02:25] but you know god what god was doing he
[1:02:27] was bringing me back to the church home
[1:02:29] i needed to be in so he can begin to
[1:02:30] deal with me
[1:02:32] you understand what i'm saying i didn't
[1:02:34] understand that at that time but by and
[1:02:36] by
[1:02:37] he helped me to understand but notice
[1:02:39] what he said said sometimes i wonder if
[1:02:41] we don't do a little bit too much
[1:02:42] complaining
[1:02:44] he says when we think of now notice he's
[1:02:46] talking about a time where there was a
[1:02:48] war going on
[1:02:50] right so there was an actual war going
[1:02:51] on and soldiers were fighting on the
[1:02:52] field giving their lives
[1:02:54] he says when we think of the but when we
[1:02:56] think when we think of having to boil
[1:02:58] the coffee twice and complaining about
[1:03:01] it he says in men dying on the field
[1:03:04] young american blood being shed on the
[1:03:06] field and blood of the nations poured
[1:03:08] out and then we complain about some
[1:03:10] little sacrifice that we have to make he
[1:03:13] says it seems like i hope this doesn't
[1:03:15] seem wrong but we seem to be more or
[1:03:18] less an ungrateful people for the things
[1:03:20] that we do have he says we don't put the
[1:03:23] evaluation to the things that we do have
[1:03:27] meaning we don't look at it and begin to
[1:03:29] think about the fact that god you gave
[1:03:31] this to me
[1:03:32] you understand what i'm saying the
[1:03:34] people could have been left with nothing
[1:03:35] to eat in the wilderness but god gave
[1:03:37] them manna but because it wasn't
[1:03:39] according to their taste they they they
[1:03:42] had a different taste they had acquired
[1:03:44] when they were in egypt certain herbs
[1:03:46] and spices that were mixed in with their
[1:03:48] food and they were they were expecting a
[1:03:50] different flavor to what they had and
[1:03:53] because it wasn't exactly to their taste
[1:03:56] they began to complain
[1:03:59] and as a result of their complaining you
[1:04:01] had many of them that died
[1:04:03] why because of a murmur that the devil
[1:04:06] put into their hearts that they yielded
[1:04:08] to and they began to look they began to
[1:04:10] be ungrateful unthankful before god and
[1:04:13] god said i'm not having that
[1:04:15] so that's an example that god allowed to
[1:04:17] be there for our sakes
[1:04:19] can we say praise the lord
[1:04:22] so i'm done
[1:04:24] i just came to tell you to be grateful
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] to show god thanksgiving no matter what
[1:04:32] you go through
[1:04:33] you might not have all the best but
[1:04:35] actually what you have is the best
[1:04:37] because it was given by god
[1:04:39] treat it as the best
[1:04:41] take care of it right take care of what
[1:04:43] you have and god is watching that
[1:04:45] because if he can give you that and he
[1:04:47] can see that you handle it right and
[1:04:48] take care of it it makes him want to do
[1:04:50] more for you
[1:04:52] now according to his will he may give
[1:04:54] you the very desire of your heart
[1:04:56] because he sees you grown
[1:04:58] and he sees now that you understand the
[1:05:00] significance of appreciating and being
[1:05:02] thankful for what it is he provides for
[1:05:05] you
[1:05:06] amen is all in his power he can do
[1:05:08] anything
[1:05:10] isn't that right
[1:05:11] i believe that so god bless you saints
[1:05:14] i appreciate the fellowship
[1:05:16] i appreciate the time that we've had
[1:05:18] together keep me in prayer of course
[1:05:20] keep my family in prayer
[1:05:22] and by god's grace we'll keep all of you
[1:05:24] in prayer

[1:05:27] give the lord a handclap of praise
