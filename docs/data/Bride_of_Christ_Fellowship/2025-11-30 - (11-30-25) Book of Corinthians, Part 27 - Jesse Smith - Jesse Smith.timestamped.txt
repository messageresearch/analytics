[0:00] Thank you musicians. Appreciate that.
[0:08] How many were excited to come to church
[0:09] today? Praise God. Amen. Seems like it
[0:12] all these days go so slow. We can't wait
[0:14] till it's Sunday. Can't wait till it's
[0:15] Wednesday to be back in the house of the
[0:16] Lord. Hallelujah. That's how I feel. I
[0:19] think every Holy Ghost fil believer
[0:20] feels that way. Don't you? Hallelujah.
[0:22] Amen. Amen.
[0:26] 1 Corinthians chapter 15. Uh we're going
[0:28] to keep working through this book here.
[0:29] We're almost done. Got two more
[0:31] chapters. We preached all the way
[0:33] through it. And like I said, then I can
[0:35] say what uh Paul said or I can say what
[0:36] brother Brandham said. I preach what
[0:38] Paul preached. Hallelujah. That's what
[0:40] we want to do. We want to preach what
[0:41] Paul preached. For Paul's words will
[0:43] judge us on that day. Whether judged
[0:45] innocent or judged guilty, we want to be
[0:47] innocent by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[0:50] Hallelujah. We have a visitor today.
[0:52] Brother, what's your name?
[0:53] &gt;&gt; Greg. Let's give Greg a round of
[0:54] applause. God bless you, brother Greg.
[0:55] Hallelujah. Thank you, Chris, for
[0:57] inviting Greg by God's grace. Well, hope
[0:59] you feel at home here, brother. By God's
[1:01] grace, we just want to worship Jesus. We
[1:03] want the Holy Ghost to flow through our
[1:05] lives. Hallelujah. God bless you,
[1:06] brother. 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[1:15] I think we'll just read verses one and
[1:17] two uh to kind of preserve time. We just
[1:19] have one service today. I want to give
[1:20] everybody a break. You know, we've had a
[1:22] lot of wonderful services. and then
[1:24] remind everybody next Sunday we have two
[1:25] services. My brother Cameron will be
[1:27] here, brother Cam will be preaching.
[1:29] It's been a while since we had him, but
[1:31] uh you know with him pastoring, I don't
[1:33] invite him very often, just like he does
[1:34] invite me very often because we both got
[1:36] a pastor. But I thought, well, at least
[1:38] once a year I can get him over here. All
[1:40] right, out of 52 weeks, surely I can get
[1:42] one of those by God's grace. And that's
[1:44] kind of how he treats me as well, which
[1:46] is very sweet. So, we look forward to
[1:48] seeing what God has placed on brother
[1:49] Cam's heart. Just come expecting next
[1:51] week. Hallelujah. You should have came
[1:52] expecting today. Hallelujah. If not,
[1:55] let's let's get that attitude of
[1:56] expectation. Praise God. Because uh God
[1:58] can only do for us what we believe he
[2:00] can do. Hallelujah. Faith comes by
[2:03] hearing. Got to have faith. Hallelujah.
[2:04] 1 Corinthians 15.
[2:07] We'll read verses 1 and two. Uh then
[2:09] we'll have you be seated here by God's
[2:11] grace. Could you put up one and two hun?
[2:13] Maybe we can read those together there.
[2:14] Thank you, sweetheart. Appreciate that.
[2:18] Hallelujah. Let's read this on three.
[2:20] Ready? One, two, three. Moreover,
[2:22] brethren, I declare unto you the gospel
[2:26] which I preached unto you, which also ye
[2:29] have received, and wherein ye stand, by
[2:33] which also ye are saved, if ye keep in
[2:36] memory what I preached unto you, unless
[2:39] ye have believed in vain. May God add
[2:42] the blessing to the ring of his word.
[2:44] You can be seated.
[2:52] Okay. So, I have some uh quotes here and
[2:54] some scriptures here. We'll read uh show
[2:56] by God's grace.
[2:58] We're in part 27 here. We're almost
[3:00] finishing up. It's good to almost see
[3:02] the finish line. I've I went back
[3:03] through my notes. I have a thousand
[3:05] slides just on this book already as far
[3:08] as that's how many scriptures I've
[3:09] showed you, how many quotes I've showed
[3:10] you. So, I feel good about that. It's
[3:12] nice to go back and review and kind of
[3:14] see where we started and see where we
[3:15] are. by God's grace. We started this
[3:17] series back in October of uh 2024.
[3:21] Now, we're we're getting down. Now,
[3:23] we're in the eighth part here by God's
[3:24] grace. Now, we're in Paul's instructions
[3:26] about resurrections.
[3:30] We just finished up with uh tongues on
[3:32] Wednesday night. So, if you didn't hear
[3:33] that, you'd like to hear about tongues
[3:34] and um their place in the body of
[3:36] Christ, you could listen to that one on
[3:38] uh Wednesday from last Wednesday uh by
[3:41] God's grace.
[3:44] So, uh, we believe tongues are real.
[3:46] Hallelujah. Uh, we do not believe
[3:48] they're the sign of the Holy Ghost.
[3:50] They're just a sign that the Holy Ghost
[3:51] has anointed you to do a gift.
[3:53] Hallelujah. Just like if someone had a
[3:55] gift to give a word of wisdom or a word
[3:56] of knowledge. It's just a sign that
[3:58] God's anointed you with the gift. But
[4:00] every believer has a gift. Even
[4:02] unbelievers have a gift. Like Judas and
[4:04] like Balum, right? And like Kora, even
[4:06] all of them had gifts. Uh but you can
[4:10] have the gift without having the giver
[4:11] of the gift. We want to have Jesus
[4:13] Christ. He's the giver of the gift.
[4:15] That's what we were singing about
[4:16] earlier, the Holy Ghost. God has given
[4:18] us the victory through the Holy Ghost.
[4:21] Hallelujah. So, it's been great to go
[4:23] through this book. Uh very refreshing.
[4:25] And uh remember, you know, we we've seen
[4:27] uh some of their sins. You know, this
[4:29] church needed the love of God to
[4:31] overcome all their sins. There was
[4:33] divisions about who is the right pre the
[4:34] best preacher. There was sexual sin in
[4:36] the church which was so wicked a man was
[4:39] sleeping with his stepmother. Uh so
[4:41] wicked the Bible said even heathens
[4:43] wouldn't do something like that. Uh and
[4:45] yet Paul never disavows this church. He
[4:47] he he believed in grace. He believe
[4:49] believed in forgiveness. He believed in
[4:51] correction too.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; Uh they were suing each other. They were
[4:55] getting drunk at the Lord's table and
[4:57] the rich weren't eating with the poor.
[4:59] Uh and there were just too many
[5:00] spiritual gifts going on. Paul said you
[5:02] got to give two just two or three. Don't
[5:04] give a hund uh many many gifts. Brother
[5:06] Chris, you have a question.
[5:12] Uh the rich were not they were refusing
[5:15] the poor to eat with them. So that's in
[5:17] that's okay. That's in first uh
[5:19] Corinthians 11. The Bible said when they
[5:21] would have communion, they said the rich
[5:23] would bring their food and eat it right
[5:25] outside uh the church, but they wouldn't
[5:27] let the poor people eat with them. And
[5:29] then they were even getting drunk,
[5:31] right? So before communion they were
[5:33] getting drunk and so Paul said those
[5:35] things not should not be. The Bible said
[5:37] if you get drunk then you will not
[5:38] inherit the kingdom of God. Drunkards do
[5:40] not inherit the kingdom of God. So great
[5:42] question. Let's give him to class
[5:43] brother. Great question. I like to give
[5:45] a encouragement there. Great question
[5:47] brother. Now we haven't seen yet where
[5:48] they lacked uh generosity. Paul said you
[5:51] didn't even send me any gifts when I was
[5:52] struggling and yet his love extends to
[5:55] them.
[5:57] So church you're going to find that in
[5:58] your life just like Paul said. Paul
[6:00] said, "The more that I love people, the
[6:02] less I'm loved." And I bring that up
[6:04] from time to time just to remind you,
[6:07] don't expect that people are just going
[6:08] to love you more and more. Remember the
[6:10] prophecy for the end time is that Jesus
[6:12] said, "Because iniquity shall bound,
[6:14] what shall wax cold?" The
[6:16] &gt;&gt; the love of many. So expect, you got to
[6:19] keep your love hot while other people
[6:21] just cool off.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; That's what you got to expect. So just
[6:25] keep showing the love of Jesus Christ.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're at a time where it's the
[6:29] most deceptive time that's ever been.
[6:31] We're at a time where there's the mo I'm
[6:33] sorry, the least Christian love of all
[6:35] time. But yet, we have the full
[6:37] revelation at the end time as well. The
[6:39] Bible said, "I'll restore all things."
[6:41] So everything's been restored at the end
[6:42] time. So as long as the word's restored,
[6:45] we can be victors. Hallelujah.
[6:47] But this church lacked generosity. They
[6:49] were the They were huge church, big
[6:50] church, lots of tongues, lots of gifts,
[6:52] lots of prophecy, but they were stingy
[6:54] with their money.
[6:56] And then as we'll see in the next book,
[6:57] they brought in all these false
[6:59] preachers. So the pastors weren't very
[7:01] good. They were letting false preachers
[7:03] come in preaching false things. Um I'll
[7:06] try to do better. I try to do better
[7:07] than that by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[7:08] I'll say like this. You know, think
[7:10] about this church. We don't have I don't
[7:11] hear anybody arguing in here about who's
[7:13] the greatest preacher. I've never heard
[7:14] that here. As far as I know, there's no
[7:16] sexual immorality here. As far as I
[7:18] know, no one is suing anybody know here.
[7:21] I know that's true because we'd know it
[7:23] if somebody was suing somebody, right?
[7:25] No one's getting drunk here. I've never
[7:27] seen anybody drunk except on the Holy
[7:28] Ghost. And that's good. Uh I've never
[7:32] seen the rich, the more rich here uh not
[7:34] fellowship with the poor here. I've
[7:36] never seen that. And we've never had
[7:38] gifts out of order.
[7:40] And I found this to be a very generous
[7:42] church.
[7:44] And we don't allow false preachers in
[7:45] here. Hallelujah. So church, what can we
[7:49] say? Like brother Brandham said, we're a
[7:50] mature church by God's grace. Now, do we
[7:52] see immaturities in some areas? Yes. No
[7:54] one's perfect,
[7:56] &gt;&gt; but look, look, look, look how far God
[7:58] has brought us. And the church said,
[7:59] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Look how far." And Paul still calls them
[8:02] in 2 Corinthians 11, he still said, "You
[8:04] when you heard the gospel, you were a
[8:06] chasteed virgin." So in God's eyes, no
[8:09] matter even their struggles, God knew
[8:11] God knew he would correct them and help
[8:13] them to overcome all these sins and then
[8:15] they would be a virgin church, a pure
[8:18] ch, I'm sorry, a pure church, unspotted
[8:20] by the world.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; In other words, there's hope. Even if
[8:24] your church has all these awful
[8:25] situations, there's hope that the blood
[8:28] of Jesus Christ will help you to
[8:29] overcome these sins. Repent of these
[8:32] sins, and then you'll be pure in God's
[8:34] sight.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Then you will not be guilty anymore of
[8:37] these sins.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:40] Now, I just want to review, you know, uh
[8:42] some I went back and looked at my first
[8:43] sermon on this series, you know, in part
[8:45] one. This is part 27. And just remember
[8:47] that God's prophet, Brother Brandham, in
[8:50] uh his his ministry, he would preach
[8:51] through entire books of the Bible. So, I
[8:53] just want to let you know, brother
[8:54] preached the entire book of Job uh half
[8:57] of the book of Hebrews and the entire
[8:58] book of Revelations
[9:00] uh to his church.
[9:02] And I thought you might like this one.
[9:04] He said he preached the book of Job. It
[9:06] took him about a year and a half to get
[9:07] through it. When I got him over on the
[9:10] ash heap, I kept telling there I kept
[9:12] him there for about six or eight weeks.
[9:14] And one of the members, she didn't want
[9:16] to hurt my feelings, but she wrote me a
[9:17] letter saying, "Brother Brandon, when
[9:18] are you ever going to get Job off the
[9:19] ash heap?" Now, can you imagine if I
[9:21] preached six weeks on Job on the ash
[9:23] heap? Six weeks. I'll take maybe two
[9:26] services on that. And then you might be
[9:28] thinking, man, when is he ever going to
[9:29] move on to something else? But look, you
[9:32] know, the Holy Spirit had him deal with
[9:34] that because there must have been some
[9:35] people on some ash heaps. And so, they
[9:38] needed to know, they need to know really
[9:40] well that even when you're on the ash
[9:42] heap, God's going to bring you out of
[9:43] that ash heap.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:47] And then he preached on uh the send
[9:49] sermons on Hebrews chapters 1-7. I like
[9:52] this one. Uh brother Ram said he would
[9:54] start in the book of Genesis and tie the
[9:56] Bible together and start in Exodus with
[9:58] it and run the book of Daniel and maybe
[10:00] the book of Revelation. Just take the
[10:01] entire book from place to place because
[10:03] all of God's word is inspired.
[10:06] Hallelujah.
[10:08] And then he say uh he says in my home
[10:11] church once I took almost a year and a
[10:13] half to go through the book of
[10:14] revelations slowly each night teaching
[10:16] on just the book of revelations and
[10:18] comparing it with the rest of the Bible
[10:19] and the ages and so forth that have
[10:21] passed on. Hallelujah. Now remember um
[10:25] with a pastoral gift a pastor is
[10:27] supposed to take you through the books
[10:29] of the Bible. Brother Graham tells us
[10:31] this. He said, "An evangelist can't do
[10:34] that because he's only here one or two
[10:36] or three or four or five services. He
[10:38] can't take you through a whole book of
[10:39] the Bible, but a pastor can." And you
[10:42] know, we thank God for pastors. We thank
[10:44] God for evangelists. I thank God for all
[10:45] the five preaching gifts.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; We need all of them. Hallelujah.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; But brother tells us in adoption in
[10:52] 1960, he preached four sermons on
[10:54] adoption.
[10:56] And uh I'm not going to go through all
[10:57] this, but brother Bam said, "You repeat
[10:58] after me." He said, "Placing." And the
[10:59] congregation said, "Placing the body."
[11:01] the body of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ
[11:05] positionally positionally in Christ in
[11:08] Christ where the Holy Spirit where the
[11:09] Holy Spirit is leading us is leading us.
[11:12] He said, "There you are. You got it." So
[11:14] he just had the church rehearse after
[11:16] him.
[11:18] That we're placed in the body of Jesus
[11:20] Christ positionally where the Holy
[11:22] Spirit is leading us. So my question is,
[11:25] where is the Holy Spirit leading you in
[11:26] the body of Christ? I know where he's
[11:28] leading me. Where is he leading you?
[11:30] That's a good question to ask
[11:32] &gt;&gt; because you want to let you want to
[11:34] follow the Holy Spirit to where he wants
[11:36] you to be in the body of Christ. So what
[11:38] are you are you going to have a
[11:38] preaching gift? Now we know not the
[11:40] sisters but the brothers. Is he leading
[11:41] you there into song ministry, fasting
[11:44] ministry, prayer ministry, outreach
[11:46] ministry? Uh what is he leading you to
[11:49] do in the body of Christ? A wisdom
[11:50] ministry, knowledge ministry, tongues
[11:52] interpretation ministry, prophecy
[11:54] ministry. Sisters, what gifts has God
[11:57] given you? What ministry is he leading
[11:59] you in? So that you're in your position
[12:01] when Jesus Christ comes.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible said when Jesus comes, every
[12:06] soldier will be in his or her rank and
[12:08] they won't they won't break rank.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was in the book of Joel
[12:14] and Daniel both say that you have to be
[12:17] in your position and you can't step out
[12:19] of your position. You got to stay in
[12:21] your position.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; So let's find our positions. Hallelujah.
[12:25] I don't know when that will happen, but
[12:27] I'll say like this. If you set your face
[12:29] to finding your position, God will show
[12:30] it to you.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; How did I do it? Uh I waited on the
[12:34] Lord, right, for preaching. I waited on
[12:35] it for a while, over a year. And then
[12:38] they kept asking me, I said, "Let me
[12:39] pray. Let me wait till the right time. I
[12:41] got time to pray. I had to finish my
[12:43] football career at the University of
[12:44] Akan. I had to finish that. And then
[12:45] after that, now now I have time to pray.
[12:47] Now I have time to seek God." Right? And
[12:50] then through that, through seeking God,
[12:52] God gave me vindications. And now I'm in
[12:54] my position. So you've got to do the
[12:56] same. You got to make time. You got to
[12:58] set aside time to spend with Jesus so
[13:00] that he can show you the gifts in your
[13:02] life. Vindicate them to you so that then
[13:04] you can do your ministry he's called you
[13:06] to do
[13:07] &gt;&gt; because you need proof. You need
[13:09] vindication that God's called you to do
[13:10] what you're doing.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; And that vindication is fruits. You'll
[13:14] have fruits to your ministry. Brother
[13:16] Ram says you'll know what God wants you
[13:18] to do. You'll be able to do what God
[13:20] wants you to do.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; How do I know I got a gift to prophesy?
[13:23] Because you prophesy.
[13:25] How do you know you got a gift of of
[13:27] faith? Because you speak words of faith
[13:28] and it comes to pass. Hallelujah. How do
[13:31] you know you can preach? Because you can
[13:33] preach by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[13:35] How do you know you're a song leader?
[13:36] Because you can lead songs and the
[13:38] people enjoy the worship. Hallelujah.
[13:40] Amen.
[13:41] I hope that's helpful by God's grace.
[13:43] And I'm I'm not even getting to where
[13:44] I'm supposed to go. And he said, "Watch
[13:46] this master teacher, St. Paul. The first
[13:48] thing he does is knock out all the ideas
[13:50] of falling away."
[13:52] So if you're struggling with falling
[13:53] away, go read Ephesians chapter 1
[13:56] &gt;&gt; because this is what brother Ram's
[13:58] saying. The brother brother Ram said the
[14:00] Bible tells us that the the Bible says
[14:02] you were chosen in Christ before the
[14:04] foundation of the world. So how you
[14:05] going to fall away if God chose you
[14:06] before the foundation of the world?
[14:09] &gt;&gt; He chose you before you got here.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That means you're always
[14:13] going to be his choice. No matter what
[14:14] happens here, he already chose you back
[14:16] there. Hallelujah.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So just knock that just knocks it
[14:21] all out of your mind. I'm not going to
[14:22] fall away. Jesus chose me. Hallelujah.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Knock out all the idea of ever be a
[14:29] Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone
[14:31] and the next day God condemned me and
[14:33] the next day I'm back again. That's
[14:34] nonsense.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; In other words, God's not condemning you
[14:37] today. He didn't condemn you yesterday.
[14:39] He's not going to condemn you tomorrow.
[14:41] You're saved today. You'll be saved
[14:43] tomorrow. You'll always be saved.
[14:45] Hallelujah.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Because of God's promise. Hallelujah.
[14:49] You met God's conditions. And when you
[14:51] meet God's conditions, God backs up
[14:54] those conditions and God vindicates that
[14:56] you met the conditions.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's nonsense." This book is
[15:02] not addressed to evangelistic teaching.
[15:04] Sorry. Is that me? Is that me? Was that
[15:07] me? Okay. I'm sorry. Maybe I'm moving
[15:09] too much. I don't want to move too much.
[15:11] This book is not addressed to
[15:12] evangelistic teaching. Evangelist
[15:14] sermons. I don't touch this on the
[15:16] field. So brother said, "I would not
[15:18] preach Ephesians 1, the whole chapter,
[15:20] while out preaching at other churches."
[15:22] He would only preach it at his church.
[15:24] Why, brother Brandham? Because I bring
[15:27] this to the church. For Paul addressed
[15:29] it to the saints, those that are called,
[15:31] preserved, and filled, and set aside,
[15:33] and are in the Holy Spirit. They're
[15:35] already in Canaan's land.
[15:38] So church, everybody here should be
[15:40] either in Canaan's land or close to
[15:43] Canaan's land
[15:45] &gt;&gt; in evangelical services. Brother Ram had
[15:48] a lot of sinners in there. They weren't
[15:50] even out of Egypt yet.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; But you're out of Egypt.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; So you're either out of Egypt in the
[15:56] wilderness or you're in the promised
[15:58] land or maybe at the you're maybe at
[16:00] your at the banks of Jordan today and
[16:02] you're waiting for the waters to cross
[16:04] and be born again. Hallelujah. Amen.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Either way, we're not in Egypt, right?
[16:09] So, we need a word that's for the
[16:10] believer who's in the promised land, for
[16:13] the believer who's already a saint,
[16:16] who's already separated unto God. And
[16:18] that's what pastoral ministry does. It
[16:20] takes you through the word of God that
[16:22] is given to the saints.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:27] So, in other words, just just this might
[16:29] be helpful. The first thing, church, is
[16:31] get it out of your mind that you're
[16:32] going to get lost. Get it out of your
[16:34] mind today.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be lost. I'm going to
[16:37] be saved.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; And don't be scared of this and don't be
[16:43] scared of that. Don't be scared of
[16:44] nothing. For he's trying to tell you
[16:46] where you're at, who you are, and how
[16:47] you're standing.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Let's read that real quick since we are
[16:50] there. Let's go to Ephesians chapter 1.
[16:51] We might as well. I spent enough time on
[16:53] it already there. Ephesians 1 verse one.
[16:57] Remember, this is not for evangelical
[16:59] teaching. This is for pastoral teaching.
[17:05] Let's see if somebody feels better after
[17:07] reading this here. By God's grace, Paul,
[17:09] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[17:11] of God, to the saints which are at
[17:12] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[17:15] Jesus. So listen, you're not at Ephesus,
[17:17] but you are the faithful in Christ.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; The devil might say, "Oh, this was
[17:20] written for the Ephesus." Well, it was,
[17:22] but Paul also said for the faithful.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; That's you and I. Amen. Hallelujah.
[17:28] Grace be unto you, not judgment, not
[17:31] legalism. Grace, not condemnation. Grace
[17:33] is to you
[17:35] &gt;&gt; and peace from God our father and from
[17:38] the Lord Jesus Christ. You get grace and
[17:40] peace from God and his son.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be the God and
[17:46] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[17:48] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[17:51] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[17:54] Church, you should say it today. Say, I
[17:56] am blessed. Ready? I am blessed. You
[17:59] have you have every spiritual blessing
[18:01] you have need of. You just got to
[18:03] remember that you got it. You got to
[18:05] accept it. You got to believe it. And
[18:06] you got to thank God for it.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; You have You and I have everything we
[18:11] need. There's not something that we're
[18:13] lacking. If we're lacking to it, we just
[18:15] got to confess our sins or or drop what
[18:17] we're hanging on to and accept and
[18:19] receive what God has given to us.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:25] If you came in empty today or if you
[18:26] came in with a burden, lay that burden
[18:28] down and grab onto the promise of God.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; I'm chosen in Christ. I'm already seated
[18:33] in the heavenly places. THERE'S ALREADY
[18:35] A THEOPHONY body waiting for me in
[18:37] heaven. Hallelujah.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; When I leave this house, this body, when
[18:40] I leave this house, I go to another
[18:43] eternal house. Hallelujah.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; When I'm absent from this body, then I'm
[18:47] present with the Lord.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; And now verse four, one of my most
[18:51] favorite verses. Well, it's hard to say.
[18:52] They're all my favorite, but sometimes
[18:54] it feels like my most favorite verse in
[18:56] the whole Bible. According as he hath
[18:57] chosen us. Where did he choose us? In
[19:00] him. Before. When did he choose us?
[19:03] Before the foundation of the world. So
[19:05] before this this earth was, I already
[19:07] was.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Before this world, before the United
[19:10] States came along, I was already chosen
[19:12] in Christ Jesus.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before anything, before all this,
[19:17] we were already chosen in Christ. God
[19:19] knew us back then. If God knew us back
[19:21] then, then God knows us now. And God
[19:24] will know us for all eternity.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; That how that how how should we live,
[19:30] church, that we should be holy and
[19:33] without blame before him in love,
[19:37] having predestinated that means
[19:39] predetermined us unto the adoption of
[19:43] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[19:45] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:47] will. So God predetermined that we'd
[19:49] come to the earth as sinners and then
[19:51] we'd recognize that he was our father
[19:53] and he would we were out of his family
[19:55] when we were sinners, but then he would
[19:57] bring us into the family, adopt us and
[19:59] give us a home and a future and
[20:02] resources and every spiritual blessing
[20:05] in the family of God.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; I preached on adoption at the middle
[20:09] school a couple weeks ago and it was
[20:11] just awesome to see. Uh there was two or
[20:13] three middle schoolers that were uh
[20:15] adopted and I was like, "What was your
[20:17] life before the adoption?" Oh, it was
[20:20] awful. We were poor. I didn't have this.
[20:22] I I said, "Well, what was your life
[20:23] after the adoption?" "I got everything I
[20:25] need."
[20:27] &gt;&gt; I've got a mom. I've got a dad who cares
[20:29] for me.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Now I'm taken to church because I'm
[20:32] adopted. Amen. [laughter]
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I said, I said, "Uh, can
[20:36] you just go in the fridge and get
[20:37] whatever you want?" He said, "Yeah, as
[20:38] long as it's not sugary, I can go do
[20:40] that, too."
[20:41] In other words, you got a you got a
[20:42] license. You you got the right to go all
[20:45] throughout the house. It's yours. You're
[20:48] part of the family. You're not somebody
[20:49] outside the family. You have a new
[20:51] family. YOU'RE IN GOD'S family now.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; You have the rights and responsibilities
[20:57] of a child of God. You're adopted. And
[21:00] it was predetermined that God was going
[21:03] to do it. Hallelujah.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; And he chose you in Christ before the
[21:08] foundation of the world.
[21:11] Well, I could have stopped right there
[21:12] and we would already have a great time
[21:13] in the Lord, right? But Abraham said
[21:16] there's enough right in there. He said
[21:17] evangelist evangelists can't do that.
[21:19] This is for the people that are in the
[21:22] body of Christ. This is for people that
[21:23] are living in Canaan's land. Amen.
[21:26] That's the kind of preaching we need to
[21:28] hear that all spiritual blessings, we
[21:30] have them. We're already seen in
[21:31] heavenly places. We're a part of the
[21:33] family of God. THIS WAS ALL SET UP by
[21:35] God. And we're just walking in God's
[21:37] beautiful plan for our lives. Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just got to Earth mercy and we
[21:41] realized that we're part of a bigger
[21:43] plan than what we thought.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; We thought it was just a, you know,
[21:46] living our uh our family, but we
[21:48] realized, wow, I'm part of a greater
[21:50] family than just my natural family. I'm
[21:52] a part of the heavenly eternal family
[21:55] &gt;&gt; with Moses and Enoch. Hallelujah. And
[21:58] Joshua and all the saints down through
[22:00] the ages. I'm in the family of God. And
[22:02] Jesus is my king. Jesus is my Lord.
[22:05] Hallelujah.
[22:07] Well, if I ever get to Corinthians, it
[22:08] might might be now here by God's grace.
[22:11] Now, this this is quite a chapter. This
[22:13] is over this is 58 verses long. So, I'm
[22:15] not going to get through all that today.
[22:16] I'm not going to preach three hours
[22:17] today. I feel like it sometimes, but I'm
[22:20] not going to do that today. Um, I want
[22:23] to just get through the first 11 verses
[22:24] if I can here uh by God's grace. But
[22:27] this is a tremendous chapter. He first
[22:30] talks about Christ's resurrection and
[22:31] the importance of that. And then he
[22:33] deals with uh the resurrection of the
[22:35] dead. And then he deals with the exact
[22:38] body that you'll have in the
[22:40] resurrection. And then he deals with the
[22:42] body change from the terrestrial body or
[22:45] the physical body into the glorified
[22:47] body. And then he ends with the victory.
[22:50] That's why we sang about victory today.
[22:52] I had victory on my heart and mind as
[22:53] I'm studying here by God's grace. Now
[22:56] there's at least three reasons he wrote
[22:58] this chapter. He wanted to promote
[23:01] faithfulness. So church, be faithful to
[23:04] God.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Satan's always going to battle you on
[23:07] that. Are you faithful enough and try to
[23:09] make you discouraged, try to get you out
[23:10] of good habits, try to get you into bad
[23:12] habits. But this chapter was written so
[23:15] we would be faithful. And the way to be
[23:18] faithful is to remember what you're
[23:20] called to do,
[23:22] right? Think about at your job. What's
[23:24] what's the only way you could get fired
[23:26] at the job? Is if you forget to do what
[23:27] you're supposed to do. You forgot. Well,
[23:30] like brother Chris, I forgot to deliver
[23:31] the package, you know, right? I forgot
[23:34] to put it maybe by the uh the garage or
[23:36] I forgot to take a picture of it. That's
[23:38] the only way. What's that?
[23:41] Yeah, that's the only way you'll fail,
[23:44] right? Is if you don't remember what
[23:46] you're supposed to do. And that's the
[23:49] same for a Christian. The Christian just
[23:51] has to remember what am I here for? What
[23:53] is God's call for my life? What does God
[23:56] want out of my life? I I knew it at one
[23:58] time. Satan's trying to get me to forget
[24:00] about it. He's trying to get my mind off
[24:01] other things, but I've got the peace of
[24:03] God.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Or I'll say like this, I'm going to get
[24:06] back the peace of God. I'm going to get
[24:08] back a piece of mind so I remember what
[24:10] he's called me to do.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Because remember Paul writes this to
[24:17] make sure the saved, you're going to
[24:19] keep saved because people can lose their
[24:21] salvation whether they recognize the
[24:23] Bible or not. There's twice the God says
[24:26] in the Old Testament, Exodus 32, God
[24:28] told Moses, "I'll blot them out for
[24:31] their sins." And Moses says, "No, blot
[24:33] me out." And God said, "No, I'm not
[24:34] going to blot you out. I'm going to blot
[24:35] out anyone who sins against me." Right?
[24:38] And then Jesus says in Revelation
[24:40] chapter 3, I believe it's verse 5, he
[24:42] says, "If you do not overcome, I will
[24:44] blot your name out of the book of life."
[24:47] So people can lose their salvation
[24:49] because salvation is a gift. Just like
[24:52] you can get a birthday gift and then you
[24:54] can lose it, right? Or you got a
[24:56] birthday gift or you got a Christmas
[24:57] gift and you say, "I don't want this.
[24:58] This is just a cheap gift. I don't want
[25:00] this gift." And you reject you reject
[25:02] the gift. And it might be a great gift,
[25:03] but you just think it's cheap. That's
[25:05] how salvation is. Some people think it's
[25:06] something worthless. Salvation is the
[25:08] greatest gift you could ever receive.
[25:10] Hallelujah.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:13] So Paul says you're saved if you keep in
[25:16] memory. That's why keeping your mind
[25:18] right is so important.
[25:21] Because if you forget what the gospel is
[25:23] all about, if you forget why you're
[25:25] saved and how you're saved, you might
[25:28] believe in vain.
[25:31] In other words, that that gift will be
[25:32] useless in your life. I can't use this.
[25:35] I can't how can I use the message? How
[25:36] can I use the the Bible? You know, how
[25:38] how can I use this? You've forgotten
[25:40] what the message is. You've forgotten
[25:43] what the gospel is.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. The second reason he writes,
[25:47] he's assuring the believers of their
[25:49] future bodily resurrections.
[25:52] Now, in this big huge church where
[25:53] everybody had a miracle, everybody had a
[25:55] tongue, everybody had a revelation,
[25:57] everybody had a brand new song,
[25:58] everybody had some revelation of the
[26:00] Bible, some of them were saying, "Oh,
[26:03] we're not going to resurrect.
[26:05] There's no resurrection." Remember that
[26:07] same idea Jesus said was with the
[26:08] Sadducees. Remember that? The Pharisees
[26:11] believed in the resurrection. The
[26:12] Sadducees did not.
[26:14] The Sadducees gave that little riddle.
[26:16] Well, there's a woman who married seven
[26:18] brothers and she never had any children.
[26:20] Whose husband is she going to be? And he
[26:21] said, "You don't understand the power of
[26:23] God."
[26:25] Hallelujah. He said, "God's not the God
[26:27] of the dead. God's the God of the
[26:29] living." Hallelujah.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, he said, uh, angels, he
[26:33] said, he said, in the resurrection,
[26:35] they'll be like the angels. There's no
[26:36] marrying.
[26:38] So, that woman's not going to marry with
[26:40] one of those seven men or something like
[26:41] that. There's not that. They're going to
[26:43] they're not going to have any sex
[26:44] glands. They're not going to have those
[26:46] desires. They're going to be like the
[26:47] angels. Holy.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. But even amidst all these
[26:53] supernatural prophecies and miracles,
[26:56] some people are saying, "Oh, there's no
[26:58] resurrection. This is all we're living
[27:00] for right here." How sad is that? Verse.
[27:04] And then the third reason, he wants to
[27:06] explain how the dead are raised and
[27:09] which bodies they will possess. Because
[27:11] in verse 35 it said some men will say
[27:13] how are the dead raised up
[27:16] and with what body do they come up? And
[27:18] he says thou fool. So fools
[27:22] fools don't believe God can even raise
[27:25] up dead bodies. If God sent the body and
[27:28] gave it life, God can raise up a dead
[27:30] body. Hallelujah. But yet Paul says
[27:33] that's foolish to think God can create
[27:36] something that dies and God can't bring
[27:37] it back to life. Oh, thank God. There's
[27:40] hope for a resurrection. Hallelujah.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; God is so great. He will resurrect all.
[27:45] He will, the Bible said, will resurrect
[27:46] everybody for the white throne judgment.
[27:49] [snorts]
[27:50] Now, let's get into chapter 15 here by
[27:52] God's grace.
[27:56] Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you
[27:57] the gospel which I preach unto you,
[28:00] which also ye have received, and wherein
[28:02] ye stand
[28:04] by which also you are saved, if ye keep
[28:07] in memory what I preach unto you, unless
[28:09] you have believed in vain. So, church,
[28:12] look at these three things you must do.
[28:13] You must receive it.
[28:16] It's not enough just to receive it.
[28:19] After you receive it, then you got to
[28:20] stand in it.
[28:22] Well, brother Jesse, I went up to the
[28:24] altar. I got baptized. That's great.
[28:26] That's just receiving it. But now you
[28:28] got to stand in it while other people
[28:30] will fall with it.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Or other people will never stand in the
[28:34] gospel. You've got to stand against the
[28:37] trials of life. You got to stand against
[28:39] liars and deceivers and temptations of
[28:41] Satan who's like a roaring lion seeking
[28:44] to devour you. You've got to stand
[28:45] against him and resist him.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Remember this is just right. Remember
[28:50] what Jesus said with the four grounds?
[28:52] Remember he said that one seed fell on
[28:54] the ground and it rejoiced for a while,
[28:57] right? But then the Bible said Satan
[29:00] came away and snatched it out of their
[29:01] heart.
[29:03] So you got to you have to do more than
[29:05] just receive it. You have to stand with
[29:07] it.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Kind of looks like the three
[29:11] works of grace if I'm not mistaken.
[29:12] There's three steps in here. And third,
[29:15] now here's what we're dealing with today
[29:16] because most of you are believers.
[29:19] You must keep the gospel in your memory.
[29:24] You must give the gospel attention in
[29:27] your mind. You have to set aside time
[29:30] all throughout the week to get the
[29:32] gospel focus on your thoughts.
[29:35] Hallelujah. Or maybe I said vice versa.
[29:37] To get your thoughts focused on the
[29:39] gospel. Yes, we've all got to work. But
[29:42] you know, if you're honest, you can
[29:43] think about Jesus while you're working.
[29:45] Hallelujah. You can think about Jesus
[29:48] while you're taking the test, can't you,
[29:49] Brother Patrick? Yeah, I've been there,
[29:51] buddy. I've taken a lot of tests in my
[29:53] life, and I give a lot of tests in my
[29:54] life. You can think about Jesus while
[29:56] you're doing it.
[29:58] You must keep it in memory.
[30:01] And so, Paul is rehearsing the danger of
[30:04] false conversions just as he addressed
[30:07] in Galatia. Now, let's read that. Keep
[30:09] your spot there. Let's go to Galatians
[30:11] uh 4:19.
[30:21] This is important because all of us have
[30:23] seen people come into the church or come
[30:25] into other churches and then they leave
[30:28] and you and but yet they said they were
[30:30] born again.
[30:32] Well, how could you be born again and do
[30:34] that church? We don't know. But we we
[30:36] can do this. If they don't live the
[30:38] life, we can doubt whether they were
[30:40] born again.
[30:42] Hallelujah. Galatians 4:19. This is what
[30:45] happened to Paul. Paul helped uh No,
[30:47] Paul did not start the church of
[30:48] Galatia, but Paul Paul's brethren
[30:51] started it. He went and preached to them
[30:54] and then over the years that now they
[30:56] changed the gospel and said, "No, you
[30:58] men do need to be circumcised." And Paul
[31:00] said, "I doubt whether you were born
[31:01] again."
[31:04] So, see church, it's wonderful if you
[31:05] start serving God, but time is going to
[31:09] test you. God is going to allow you to
[31:11] be tested to see to show you what is in
[31:14] your heart.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; And the Galatians had fear, right?
[31:19] &gt;&gt; They wanted to try to add something to
[31:20] the gospel. It's not enough to believe,
[31:22] well, I've got to go get circumcised
[31:23] now. I'm saved. No, you're deceived.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "You're foolish to add
[31:29] anything to the gospel." Now, let's look
[31:32] at this here. Now, I don't have it. We
[31:33] just got our Bibles. My little children
[31:35] of whom I travail in birth again until
[31:38] Christ be formed in you. So anyone that
[31:40] adds legalism to the gospel, Paul would
[31:43] say, you need to be born again. You were
[31:46] not born the first time.
[31:48] Look at verse 20. I desire to be present
[31:51] with you now and to change my voice for
[31:53] I stand in doubt of you.
[31:56] So see see church all the people that
[31:58] have come into our church say they're
[32:00] born again and leave because of sin. We
[32:02] have a right to say I doubt they were
[32:04] born again
[32:06] because the Bible said they went out
[32:08] from us because they were not of us.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:13] See that?
[32:16] So Paul addressed some people are
[32:19] falsely converted
[32:21] right or they they they made it out of
[32:23] Egypt. They get justified, but they
[32:25] don't get sanctified or they don't get
[32:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Church,
[32:28] you better go all the way.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; You better make sure you believe, you
[32:33] receive, you stand, you keep these
[32:35] things in memory so that your faith, it
[32:38] lasts. It stands the test. And the
[32:41] gospel has an effect on your life and
[32:43] it's not done something that's in vain
[32:45] in your life.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:48] [snorts]
[32:49] So remember, I said this earlier. I've
[32:51] rehearsed this numerous times, but grace
[32:53] is a gift according to Paul, not by
[32:55] works, lest any man should boast.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; But therefore, it can also be rejected.
[33:01] People can receive that seed like the
[33:03] parable, but then they can allow Satan
[33:05] to snatch it out of their hearts. Only
[33:07] God knows. We don't know for sure. Alls
[33:09] we can do is just doubt that they are
[33:11] born again and pray for them to come
[33:13] back to the church.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Or any church. Is that right?
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter where they go. as long as
[33:18] they go to a church, they're feeding on
[33:20] the word of God, and they live a life
[33:22] that's worthy of the gospel of Jesus
[33:24] Christ.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Now, let's read these so you can see
[33:28] them. 1 Corinthians uh 9:27.
[33:38] So, here even Paul says, you know, I
[33:40] could stand in doubt. If I fell away, he
[33:43] said, I uh then I wouldn't be saved.
[33:45] Verse 27, but I keep under my body and
[33:48] bring it into subjection, lest that by
[33:50] any means when I have preached to
[33:51] others, I myself should be a cast away.
[33:55] So, in other words, none of us know
[33:57] truly for sure uh that uh that we're
[34:00] sealed with the Holy Spirit, right? None
[34:01] of us know. We have a testimony and we
[34:04] want to believe it, but Paul says, "I've
[34:06] got to keep sin out of my life. I've got
[34:09] to crucify my desires of sin or else I
[34:12] could be a cast away as well."
[34:14] Like brother Ram said, I can't I can't
[34:16] prove to you that my name is up in
[34:18] heaven.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Like who's ever taken their cell phone
[34:20] up to heaven, take a picture. Oh, my
[34:22] name's on the book of life. And then
[34:23] come back down and say, "Look what I
[34:24] got. I got proof. I'm I'm I got proof I
[34:28] got the Holy Ghost." You can't do it.
[34:30] Cell phones won't go in the rapture.
[34:32] Praise God. Cell phones can't be uh
[34:34] translated. Hallelujah. And that's the
[34:37] point Paul's making. We have a
[34:38] responsibility down here on earth. We're
[34:40] believing we're saved. We believe we're
[34:42] sealed with the Holy Ghost, but we're
[34:43] gonna keep all the sin out of our lives
[34:46] as proof that we are sealed by the Holy
[34:48] Ghost.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; All right. 2 Corinthians 6:1.
[34:53] 2 Corinthians 6:1.
[34:59] We then as workers together with him
[35:01] beseech you or beg you also that you
[35:04] receive not the grace of God in vain.
[35:08] Hallelujah. So Paul says it numerous
[35:10] times, people can receive God's grace,
[35:13] but if they forget about the gospel,
[35:16] then it will be in vain. Right? Judas is
[35:19] the best example. All of his service was
[35:21] in vain because he sold out Jesus Christ
[35:23] at the end.
[35:26] Now verse three. Now here's where we're
[35:27] going to get to some good old time
[35:29] religion. Hallelujah.
[35:34] Now Paul reminds them who started this
[35:37] Corinthian church. Paul did.
[35:40] Hallelujah. So Paul's writing a letter
[35:43] to a church that he started. It'd be
[35:44] like me, all right? Because I uh I
[35:46] helped start this church with six of six
[35:48] other adults. It'd be like me moving
[35:50] away and then writing a letter and say,
[35:52] "Listen, I God used me to help start
[35:55] this church with the saints."
[35:58] Right? So Paul's writing them saying,
[35:59] "Remember, I delivered to you first that
[36:03] which I received." So first the preacher
[36:06] has to receive from God and then he
[36:09] preaches it to the people.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:13] And that's what I did when I came to
[36:14] Akran. God gave me the message in Akran
[36:16] and then I started preaching the message
[36:18] in Akran.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; And now we got a church here.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; I received it through brother Simon.
[36:23] Right. I received the word of God
[36:24] through brother Simon. Studied myself
[36:26] approved and now I preach it and now we
[36:28] got a church here. Just like Paul's day.
[36:31] The preacher has to receive the word of
[36:33] God, then preach the word of God. Yes.
[36:39] And church, how how did Paul start this
[36:42] church? Well, of course, uh Jesus gave
[36:44] him a night vision and said, "Don't fear
[36:47] the city of Corenth." Remember, he lived
[36:49] with justice in a house right next to
[36:50] the Jewish synagogue. He lived in that
[36:53] house and a vision came by night. God
[36:56] spoke to him in a vision and said, "I
[36:58] have many people in this city. do not
[37:00] leave this city and don't fear for your
[37:01] life. Hallelujah. And so Paul started
[37:05] the church. But first he had met with
[37:07] Jesus in the Arabian desert or
[37:09] modern-day Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia
[37:12] and was given the gospel. He was given
[37:15] the revelation. Hallelujah. And then
[37:17] Jesus sent him to the city of Corinth.
[37:21] Now,
[37:23] here is the beautiful, simple, but yet
[37:26] powerful summary of the gospel of Jesus
[37:29] Christ. Right? We know John 3:16, right?
[37:31] That's a beautiful summary. For God so
[37:33] loved the world that he gave his only
[37:35] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[37:37] him should not perish but have
[37:38] everlasting life.
[37:41] But this is another way to paraphrase it
[37:43] as well. And this is what Paul preached
[37:46] to start the church.
[37:49] You You might think, "Well, Brother
[37:50] Jesse, what what if I'm going to start a
[37:51] church, what would God have me to say?"
[37:53] You might wonder. Well, here's an answer
[37:54] right here. This is how you start a
[37:56] church in the book of Acts. Hallelujah.
[37:59] Amen. Praise God. I hope I'm not losing
[38:01] you by God's grace.
[38:03] For I delivered this to you because I
[38:06] received this from Jesus that Christ
[38:09] died for our sins according to the
[38:11] scriptures and that he was buried and he
[38:14] rose again on the third day according to
[38:17] the scriptures.
[38:20] Imagine you could start a church by this
[38:22] simple message. Jesus Christ died for
[38:25] our sins. He was buried and he rose
[38:28] according to the scriptures.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:32] That's all you need to start a church.
[38:35] And the church said,
[38:37] &gt;&gt; "Is that enough for you to be a part of
[38:38] a church?"
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Would you have joined the Corinthian
[38:41] church by that simple message?
[38:44] There's no seven seals in there.
[38:47] Hallelujah.
[38:48] My there's no seven seals. Uh uh there's
[38:51] no seven church ages in there. He
[38:53] started the church by saying, "You're
[38:55] sinners."
[38:57] Jesus died to take your sin away. He was
[39:00] buried and then he rose again. That's
[39:03] enough to start a church.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; brother Chris.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, they preach the revelation of
[39:12] the Old Testament. You see it in Paul's
[39:15] letters, brother, like in Romans, Paul
[39:17] will make a point and then he'll cite
[39:19] numerous Old Testament verses to back
[39:22] up. So Jesus gave him a revelation of
[39:24] what he needed to preach, but then he
[39:26] could go back in the Old Testament and
[39:27] find verses that supported it. And it
[39:30] also prepared Paul for the future ages,
[39:33] the future seven church ages. It's a
[39:35] great question. Give them to class.
[39:36] You're Catholic. Hallelujah.
[39:42] Now just remember here, church, the
[39:44] gospel means good news. So it is good
[39:47] news. It should be good news to you that
[39:49] Jesus Christ died for your sins. You do
[39:52] not have to pay for your sins because
[39:54] Jesus already paid for them.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; That should be good news and so good
[39:59] that you want to be a part of the body
[40:01] of Jesus Christ.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Now, where did the Old Testament
[40:06] foretell the death, burial, and
[40:07] resurrection? There's many places, but
[40:09] I'm just giving you three. His death was
[40:11] forel foretold by Isaiah 800 years
[40:14] before Christ. He said, "For he was cut
[40:17] out of the land of the living." thing.
[40:19] So cut out means to be d to die, right?
[40:22] To be crucified.
[40:25] The Bible said he would be buried in the
[40:27] same chapter and he made his grave with
[40:29] the wicked with the rich in his death.
[40:32] And then the David said a thousand years
[40:34] before he was on the earth that he would
[40:36] resurrect
[40:38] because thine holy one would neither see
[40:41] corruption. Corruption of the body sets
[40:43] in after three days. Hallelujah. So
[40:47] corruption would not Jesus would raise
[40:49] within three days. Hallelujah.
[40:52] So this was enough to start a book of
[40:55] acts church. Amen. I'll say it like
[40:58] this. It ought to be enough for us to
[41:00] have a book of acts church today.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:06] I just thought, you know, this week I
[41:07] read through chapter one of the church
[41:08] age book. I'm trying to get back into
[41:10] that. It's only like 28 pages.
[41:13] But I read over this. And let's
[41:14] remember, church, that you were loosed
[41:17] from your sins and that your curse was
[41:20] taken away.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; You need to remember that. If you don't
[41:24] remember that, you might feel like
[41:26] you're serving God in vain.
[41:29] That your faith is in vain.
[41:34] Revelation 1 vers5 said, "Unto him that
[41:36] hated us." Well, why do you let the
[41:39] devil tell you that he hates you?
[41:44] But unto him that's discouraged with us.
[41:46] Is that what it says?
[41:49] Hallelujah. Come on, church. Hallelujah.
[41:51] Unto him that loved us.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus loves you.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; That's why he died for you. Praise God.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Unto him that loved us and washed us
[42:02] from our sins in his own blood.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; The word washed in the Greek actually
[42:09] means loosed.
[42:11] loose from our own sins in his in his
[42:13] own blood. Isn't that wonderful? But let
[42:16] me ask you, church, are you spiritual
[42:17] minded when I read that? Did you catch
[42:19] it? Catch what, brother Jesse? That it
[42:22] was God's own blood that he created. Not
[42:26] human blood that was contaminated by
[42:28] sin, but God made a special new blood.
[42:31] The blood of virgin-born savior Jesus
[42:33] Christ. Holy blood, not born through
[42:37] sexual desire, but through a virgin
[42:39] birth.
[42:41] It was God's own blood that loosed us
[42:43] completely from our sins. It was not
[42:46] human blood. It was the blood of God.
[42:48] Peter called it the blood of Christ.
[42:50] Paul called it the blood of the Lord,
[42:52] the blood of Jesus.
[42:55] And brother Ram says, consider this.
[42:57] Since it is the blood of God, it is
[43:00] perfect blood. And if the perfect blood
[43:03] is loosing us from the power and bondage
[43:06] of and defilement of sin, then the
[43:09] loosing is perfect and complete. So just
[43:14] to keep it simple, perfect blood,
[43:17] perfect forgiveness.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; That ought to make somebody shout today.
[43:22] Hallelujah.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; I'll shout. IF YOU'RE NOT, I'LL SHOUT
[43:24] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Perfect blood has perfectly forgiven me.
[43:29] Hallelujah.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't my blood, therefore it's not
[43:33] my forgiveness. It's his blood. It's his
[43:35] forgiveness. Hallelujah.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Because you and I have trouble forgiving
[43:39] ourselves,
[43:40] &gt;&gt; but God does it because it's perfect
[43:42] blood.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; And he poured out, Nia, all of your
[43:45] sins. All of my sins, Malachi, all of
[43:47] your sins, all of our sins, brothers, he
[43:49] poured upon Jesus. And now Jesus paid
[43:53] the the penalty for those sins. So we
[43:55] get perfect forgiveness.
[44:01] Consider that this morning, church, if
[44:03] the devil's trying to uh discourage you
[44:06] or make you feel unworthy, consider
[44:08] that. Well, I know I'm not worthy
[44:09] myself, but I am worthy in what Jesus
[44:12] did.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Consider that today.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Let's consider it by God's grace. Let's
[44:18] keep it in our minds. Hallelujah.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; So that our belief is not in vain, but
[44:23] our belief has effect and our belief has
[44:26] fruits to it. Amen. [snorts]
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Therefore,
[44:33] the loosing is perfect and complete.
[44:35] Now, there is therefore no condemnation
[44:38] in Christ Jesus.
[44:42] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[44:44] God's elect? It is God that justifith,
[44:47] declares us righteous. Who is he that
[44:49] condemnth? It is Christ that died.
[44:52] So the only way you can be condemned is
[44:55] if you reject the death of Jesus.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; But if you accept the death of Jesus,
[45:00] you cannot be condemned.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; So you know church, we often worry,
[45:05] well, what what's what is it going to be
[45:06] like on the day of judgment? He just
[45:08] told it told us what it's going to be
[45:10] like.
[45:11] There'll be nothing laid to your charge
[45:14] because all that you did was already
[45:16] laid upon Jesus.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, precious is the flow
[45:22] that makes us white as snow.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; No [screaming] other fountain I know,
[45:27] nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[45:29] Hallelujah.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; The devil can't lay anything to your
[45:35] charge.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; There's no person out there in this
[45:39] world that can lay anything to your
[45:41] charge because God's already forgiven
[45:43] you.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know who this is for, but I hope
[45:47] it's for somebody by God's grace. If
[45:49] not, it's just for me then. And so I'm
[45:50] going to relieve here with overwhelming
[45:52] joy. Hallelujah. Amen. There it is. His
[45:56] death gave us the blood. The blood has
[45:59] loosed us now. There is now no
[46:02] condemnation. How can there be?
[46:06] &gt;&gt; So the devil says, "You're going to be
[46:08] condemned. You're going to be
[46:08] condemned." Tell the devil, "How can
[46:10] there be?"
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Perfect blood gave me perfect
[46:14] forgiveness. Amen.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; That sound Does that sound like good
[46:21] news to anybody?
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Could we start a church with those
[46:25] words?
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Paul did. Amen. [applause] Hallelujah.
[46:30] How can there be any condemnation to me?
[46:32] So the next time Satan tries to talk to
[46:34] you, tell him that. How can there be
[46:35] anything against me?
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus already p Jesus' death paid for my
[46:40] forgiveness. His blood
[46:44] took my place, pardoned my sin, paid my
[46:47] debt that I owed. And so now I don't owe
[46:49] anything anymore.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid my debt.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; There is nothing to be condemned for.
[46:58] What about the devil says, "What about
[46:59] that yesterday? What about that last
[47:01] night? What about that last week? I
[47:02] confessed it. It's forgiven."
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; How can there be, devil?
[47:07] &gt;&gt; There's no condemnation. You can't lay
[47:10] anything to my charge.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Nobody can lay anything to God's
[47:14] children to their charge because Jesus
[47:17] already took all the suffering and all
[47:18] the pain for your sins. Hallelujah.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; He was already all the guilt and shame
[47:22] was already placed on him so that we
[47:24] don't have to have it placed on us.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; What a good lesson to remind this church
[47:29] in Corenth
[47:31] &gt;&gt; because they were arguing. Well, you I'm
[47:33] taking you to court. I'm going to get my
[47:34] money back. You owe me. But in Jesus'
[47:36] eyes, you don't owe anybody nothing.
[47:39] Hallelujah.
[47:41] Oh, no. This this preacher is way better
[47:43] than that preacher. But the blood of
[47:45] Jesus Jesus says all preachers are
[47:47] falling short of God's glory.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; There's no great ones among us.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; The only great one is Jesus Christ.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; So, see how see how this solves all the
[47:57] problems in the church. Christ died for
[47:59] all of our sins. Well, brother Jesse,
[48:01] you did this. Well, so did you did
[48:02] something, too.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; We all need the blood of Jesus Christ to
[48:06] forgive our sins. Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Perfect blood gave you and I perfect
[48:11] loosing
[48:13] &gt;&gt; and therefore we for we can forgive
[48:15] people because we've been forgiven.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; We do not lay things to people's charge.
[48:20] We can doubt their experience. Yes, we
[48:22] can doubt that and hope they get a real
[48:23] birth of the Holy Ghost. But we cannot
[48:25] lay anything to their charge. Only God
[48:27] can do that. And God won't do it if we
[48:30] believe the gospel.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to man. I'll say this.
[48:35] Don't listen to the devil either.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Listen to the word.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; You are loosed by the blood.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; I don't think you caught it. Well, some
[48:48] people did. You are loosed from guilt
[48:51] and shame by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[48:55] &gt;&gt; if it's a perfect blood, then it's
[48:57] perfect forgiveness.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; And don't forget that, church. If you
[49:04] forget it, you might believe in vain.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Next, let's remember, you're not going
[49:11] to be cursed, right? You and I will not
[49:15] be cursed on the day of judgment because
[49:16] Jesus Christ already took your curse.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; And so, therefore, you don't have a
[49:22] curse anymore.
[49:24] The Bible said, "Christ hath redeemed
[49:26] us." Let's all say us. Ready? Us. That's
[49:28] you and I. Us. from the curse of the
[49:31] law, being made a curse for us. He
[49:35] became sin that we might be made his.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Very good. Second uh Corinthians 5:21.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; For it is written, cursed is everyone
[49:45] that hangeth on a tree that the
[49:47] blessing. So, we're all we're worried
[49:49] about, am I going to be cursed? Am I
[49:51] going to curse? And the Bible's trying
[49:52] to tell us you're blessed.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; You're chosen. You're loose. You're
[49:57] washed.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:59] That's right.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; That the blessing of Abraham might come
[50:02] on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ
[50:04] that we might receive the promise of the
[50:06] spirit through faith.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; The blessing of Abraham came through the
[50:11] cross to the Gentiles. The Jews rejected
[50:14] the cross. Therefore, Jesus got the
[50:17] Gentile bride. How many Gentiles we got
[50:19] in here?
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Every hand should be up.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; If you're not a Jew and if you don't
[50:24] celebrate all the feasts of Israel, your
[50:25] hand should be up. I'm a Gentile. And
[50:27] that that's a good that's a good thing
[50:29] because you got the blessing, not the
[50:31] curse.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:36] And like I said on Wednesday, remember I
[50:37] showed you that if 144,000 Jews get the
[50:41] Holy Ghost in the tribulation, that's
[50:43] only 1.4% of all Jews.
[50:46] That means 98.6 are still with a curse
[50:50] on them. Think about that. 98% of the
[50:53] Jews are going to be cursed during the
[50:54] tribulation because they reject Christ
[50:56] as Messiah
[50:58] and they're not born again.
[51:00] Right? So, the majority of Jews are
[51:02] cursed by their sin, their love for sin.
[51:05] The majority of Gentiles are cursed by
[51:07] their sin. But you have been chosen to
[51:09] be blessed.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; You have been chosen to be loosed by the
[51:15] blood of Jesus Christ. You've received
[51:17] good news, not bad news.
[51:22] And I guess I'll just preach till my
[51:23] voice goes out. Hallelujah. Still
[51:26] recovering from that sickness, but God
[51:27] is good. How many want Malachi to lead
[51:30] more songs?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that, buddy? I'm not going
[51:33] to pressure you, but I like to joke with
[51:35] you, though.
[51:38] I want him to lead songs as he feels led
[51:40] of the Holy Spirit. Praise God. I never
[51:42] want to I never want to force anybody
[51:43] into anything by God's grace.
[51:46] Verse five. And he that was now oh yeah
[51:50] and that he was seen of Cphus then of
[51:53] the 12. So after sharing this beautiful
[51:56] gospel message that Jesus Christ died
[51:58] for our sins was buried and resurrected
[52:00] according to the scriptures Paul gives a
[52:02] list list of faithful witnesses of the
[52:04] resurrection.
[52:07] So church if you're going to prove to an
[52:08] unbeliever about the gospel could you do
[52:12] any better than Paul? What do you think?
[52:14] No. Paul actually saw Jesus face to
[52:16] face.
[52:18] So don't don't don't worry and don't
[52:21] fret like, "Well, I don't know what to
[52:22] say." Just say what Paul said.
[52:25] What? Why are you a Christian? Because
[52:27] Jesus Christ died for my sins and he
[52:30] rose for my justification
[52:33] and he sent the Holy Ghost and now I've
[52:35] got the Holy Ghost in my heart.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That's all you got to say. If they're a
[52:40] believer, they'll accept it. If not, it
[52:41] shows what seed is inside of them. At
[52:43] least as far as until they repent,
[52:44] right? sometime in the future.
[52:49] We can't do better than Paul, right? We
[52:51] can't change Paul's gospel.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; This either works or it doesn't work.
[52:56] How many know it works? Hallelujah. It
[52:58] works in my life. Hallelujah. If it
[53:00] works in my life, it'll work in your
[53:02] life if you're a believer. Hallelujah.
[53:05] So after saying the simple gospel
[53:07] message, now he tells these Corinthians,
[53:10] I started this church and listen, I'm
[53:12] going to give you six witnesses
[53:14] that know he was resurrected. And if
[53:17] that's not enough, too bad. You don't
[53:19] want to believe,
[53:21] &gt;&gt; right, church? Like I heard a good
[53:23] evangelist, Ray Comfort, say this.
[53:26] He said, uh, he said, you know, by by
[53:29] logic, I can prove Noah's arc by logic.
[53:32] If you take the smallest, if you take
[53:34] male and female of all those animals,
[53:36] they will fit onto those dimensions.
[53:38] It's logic. He said, but then I can't
[53:41] explain how God spoke through a donkey,
[53:45] right? A scientist would never accept
[53:47] that. Oh, animals can't talk.
[53:51] So he see he said he said that's not the
[53:53] gospel, right? If you just try to
[53:56] convince somebody by facts, that's not
[53:58] the gospel. To preach the gospel, you
[54:00] have to tell people that they're sinners
[54:02] and they love sin and they're going to
[54:04] hell if they don't accept forgiveness.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; That's the root of the gospel. You know,
[54:10] you can argue all day about all these
[54:12] facts. You can argue all day about all
[54:14] these things, but you got to bring it
[54:16] down to they are a sinner and they need
[54:19] to accept the good news. They got to
[54:21] accept the reality. They're going to
[54:23] hell if they don't repent of all their
[54:25] sins.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Right? And so that's what Ray Comfort
[54:30] does. He just goes through four of the
[54:32] ten commandments. He said, "Have you
[54:34] ever taken the name of the Lord in
[54:36] vain?" And every person says, "Yes."
[54:38] "Have you ever had lustful thoughts?"
[54:39] They all say yes. "Have you ever uh
[54:42] coveted after something somebody else
[54:44] wants?" Yes. Have you ever stole
[54:46] anything? Yes. Have you ever lied? Yes.
[54:47] Well, there's five of them right there.
[54:50] He said, "You've already broken five of
[54:52] God's ten commandments. So on the day of
[54:55] judgment, is God going to send you to
[54:56] heaven or hell?" And every one of them
[54:58] answer, "Hell."
[55:01] So then he says, "Now he's got you
[55:03] backed up, right?"
[55:05] And everybody has to answer the same for
[55:07] all those.
[55:09] Hallelujah. And when he's got you back
[55:11] in the corner, then he says, "What did
[55:13] God do for guilty sinners so that we
[55:16] could be forgiven of our sins and go to
[55:18] heaven? And 99% of them say he sent his
[55:22] son Jesus Christ to die for our sins.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to convince people
[55:30] by all these facts. That's not going to
[55:32] keep them. What's going to keep them is
[55:34] that they're a sinner and they need a
[55:36] savior.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:46] So Paul lists six groups.
[55:49] So I guess, you know, if you add them
[55:50] all up, there's over uh 500 witnesses.
[55:55] So Paul says Jesus Christ died, he
[55:57] resurrected, died for our sins. And on
[56:00] top of all that, Corinthians,
[56:02] there's over 500 people that saw Jesus
[56:05] Christ raised.
[56:09] Cphus,
[56:11] which was Peter,
[56:13] the 12, and they saw him on the evening
[56:15] of the resurrection. Now, yeah, Jesus
[56:17] met uh Peter one-on-one
[56:20] shortly after the resurrection.
[56:21] Remember, Peter ran down there to find
[56:23] him. He didn't find him. Shortly after
[56:24] that, Jesus met Peter one-on-one. And
[56:28] then when Peter was with the other 11
[56:29] that night, when they were hiding away,
[56:31] Jesus revealed himself to the rest of
[56:33] the the 12. But they call it the 12. But
[56:36] Judas wasn't there. They just called it
[56:38] the 12 because that that was their name.
[56:39] They were the 12.
[56:42] And then he showed himself to 500
[56:44] brethren either in Galilee or at his
[56:46] ascension near Bethany.
[56:49] And then he revealed himself to James,
[56:52] the halfb brotherther of the Lord Jesus.
[56:54] Remember Jesus had at least seven
[56:55] siblings, right? So does God like big
[56:58] families?
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Sister Janet, does God like big
[57:01] families? She has nine. She had nine in
[57:04] her family. glory.
[57:09] And then he showed himself to all the
[57:11] apostles probably at the Sea of Galilee
[57:13] in John chapter 21. And then Paul said,
[57:15] "Last of all, he showed himself to me.
[57:18] I've seen the resurre I've seen the
[57:19] resurrected Christ."
[57:23] Now, let's go through these
[57:25] church. Why is this so important? I hope
[57:27] it's going to be important to you by the
[57:28] end of this message here. I'm already on
[57:30] verse five. I got six more verses to go.
[57:33] So after the gospel message he was seen
[57:36] of Cphus. Cphus means stone in Aramaic
[57:40] but the word Peter is means stone in the
[57:43] Greek. So you can say either either one
[57:45] means stone. Whether you say Cphus or
[57:47] Peter they both mean stone.
[57:49] Now Peter was a significant witness
[57:52] because he he rose to follow Jesus. He
[57:55] fell by denying him three times right in
[57:58] his face
[58:00] and then rising again and receiving the
[58:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[58:05] Hallelujah.
[58:08] Church, take courage despite your
[58:10] failures.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; You might you might say, "Oh, I
[58:14] embarrassed myself. I I I disgraced
[58:16] Jesus in front of all those people."
[58:18] Join the club. So did Peter. Peter
[58:22] denied Jesus. And the third time the
[58:24] Bible said they locked eyes. He said,
[58:26] "I've denied you." And he runs away and
[58:28] cries and weeps bitterly. You couldn't
[58:30] have anything worse than that, could
[58:32] you?
[58:35] Remember, we remember the woman who was
[58:36] caught in an act of adultery. She's in
[58:38] the very act of it. And what does Jesus
[58:40] give to her? Mercy.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You're in the very act. And then brought
[58:46] into the presence of Jesus. He doesn't
[58:48] bring judgment. He brings mercy. God's
[58:51] trying to bring us mercy. Amen.
[58:54] [snorts]
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:58] So, I love the witnesses. Paul chooses
[59:01] the man who was bragging, saying, "I'll
[59:03] die with you." But yet, his bragging
[59:04] fell down to the ground.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He wasn't as strong as he thought he
[59:08] was. Right, brothers?
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll do this. I'll go DO THAT.
[59:12] I'LL SHOW YOU THAT. I'll I'll die for
[59:13] you. And sometimes, brothers and
[59:15] sisters, we brag like we got something
[59:17] and we can't even back it up.
[59:20] But Jesus forgives even braggers.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus forgives boasters.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus forgives those who deny him
[59:30] if you'll humble yourself and repent.
[59:35] What a list of believers we got here.
[59:38] And then the 12.
[59:41] Now he showed himself to the 12 in John
[59:43] chapter 20. Remember the Bible said they
[59:45] locked themselves in for fear of the
[59:47] Jews. So Jesus walks through the door.
[59:50] The Bible says it. So when you got a
[59:52] glorified body, you'll walk through the
[59:53] walls. Hallelujah. If if at the rapture
[59:57] the dead in Christ rise first, imagine
[59:59] if we saw him walk through these doors.
[1:00:01] Amen. Imagine if we saw Paul and John
[1:00:03] and Peter and all these saints, Brother
[1:00:06] Random and Martin Luther and John Wesley
[1:00:08] start walking through the walls. Well,
[1:00:10] we'll we'll have rapturing faith then by
[1:00:12] God's grace.
[1:00:15] Hallelujah.
[1:00:16] And church, Jesus said, "Have peace in
[1:00:19] your life
[1:00:21] despite the fact they were scattered
[1:00:23] like sheep from the shepherd."
[1:00:26] Despite running away from the truth,
[1:00:28] despite abandoning your family, despite
[1:00:30] abandoning your other brothers and
[1:00:32] sisters, anything you've done wrong,
[1:00:34] despite that, Jesus is offering you
[1:00:36] peace today if you'll remember his
[1:00:38] commands.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] because he speaks peace to a group of 12
[1:00:43] that had forsaken Jesus Christ.
[1:00:47] If you've forsaken the church, the body
[1:00:49] of Christ I'm talking about. If you've
[1:00:51] even forsaken this church, if you've
[1:00:53] forsaken your family that were
[1:00:55] Christians, there's forgiveness for you.
[1:00:57] Just come back to Jesus.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; And then on top of all that, he's he's
[1:01:04] saying, "I'll get you." He said, "As God
[1:01:06] sends me, I'm going to send you." And
[1:01:08] then he breathes on them and say,
[1:01:09] "Receive the Holy Ghost." Which they
[1:01:11] would get in about 49 more days.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, this sounds like
[1:01:16] amazing grace to me.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; I I can fall flat on my face. I can I I
[1:01:22] can be a total failure. I can run. I can
[1:01:24] show fear. I can bring disgrace on God.
[1:01:27] And yet, he'll forgive me. Yes. Because
[1:01:30] you're predestinated.
[1:01:31] You're you're chosen to be adopted.
[1:01:34] You're already a part of the family of
[1:01:36] God. Despite your mistakes, God wants
[1:01:38] you to come back to the family.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] [applause]
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; So, we got Peter, we got the 12 who were
[1:01:50] also failures.
[1:01:52] And then he showed 500 brethren at once,
[1:01:55] of whom the greater part of remain unto
[1:01:58] the present, but some are fallen asleep.
[1:02:01] Now, this probably took place at Galilee
[1:02:04] because remember Galilee was Jesus's
[1:02:05] headquarters for the most part of his
[1:02:07] ministry, the northern part of Israel.
[1:02:11] Remember, he told them, he said, "Be not
[1:02:13] afraid. Go tell my brethren that go to
[1:02:15] Galilee and they there shall they see
[1:02:18] me."
[1:02:20] So Jesus probably appeared to 500
[1:02:22] believers at once in Galilee because
[1:02:24] that was his headquarters of his
[1:02:26] ministry.
[1:02:29] And after that he was seen of James and
[1:02:31] then of all the apostles. Now I I found
[1:02:34] this out yesterday when I went and
[1:02:36] studied this. James was the halfb
[1:02:38] brotherther of Jesus. But this is
[1:02:40] significant that Paul names him because
[1:02:43] James did not believe in Jesus until
[1:02:45] after the resurrection.
[1:02:48] Imagine James was raised up up with
[1:02:51] Jesus. And Jesus was the oldest child in
[1:02:54] the family, right? And Jesus always did
[1:02:56] what Mary and Joseph said. He never got
[1:02:58] spanking, right? So James would, oh,
[1:03:02] he's always the goody douches. He never
[1:03:04] does anything wrong. He had to battle
[1:03:05] the sin nature, too, like you and I.
[1:03:07] Hallelujah.
[1:03:09] But even the Bible says as he got older
[1:03:11] in Mark 3:21 and John 7:5,
[1:03:16] James and the brothers did not believe
[1:03:18] Jesus was the Messiah.
[1:03:22] So Jesus had to show himself as a
[1:03:25] resurrected Christ to his halfbrother so
[1:03:28] he would believe.
[1:03:30] Hallelujah. And then Paul says, "Well,
[1:03:32] look at this man. He's a believer. He
[1:03:35] doubted for all those years of his life,
[1:03:38] but now he's believer." And after he got
[1:03:40] the Holy Ghost, he became like the
[1:03:41] pastor or one of the head apostles in
[1:03:43] Jerusalem. And then he even wrote the
[1:03:46] book of James.
[1:03:48] So this tells us don't give up on people
[1:03:51] in your family.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; If they don't believe, don't give up.
[1:03:55] Just keep praying. Pray that Jesus will
[1:03:58] show himself to your loved ones.
[1:04:00] Hallelujah.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; And last of all, he's gone through five
[1:04:06] different groups. Last of all, he was
[1:04:09] seen of me also,
[1:04:11] as of one born out of due time.
[1:04:15] For I am the least of the apostles that
[1:04:17] I'm not me to be called an apostle
[1:04:20] because I persecuted the church of God.
[1:04:24] So where does Paul place himself first?
[1:04:26] Did he make himself the greatest of all
[1:04:27] the witnesses?
[1:04:29] Did he make himself the goat?
[1:04:32] He places himself last.
[1:04:35] Now if you look in the Greek, born out
[1:04:38] of due time means an abortion or an
[1:04:42] untimely birth. something really bad and
[1:04:44] tragic.
[1:04:48] So just as an abortion is unwanted and
[1:04:51] unfit and just tragic, so was his
[1:04:54] persecution of the body of Christ.
[1:04:57] Hallelujah.
[1:05:01] That's how awful it is, church, to
[1:05:02] persecute Christians. It's like an
[1:05:05] abortion, right? It's just it's so
[1:05:06] unwanted. It's so tragic.
[1:05:09] It's so awful. An untimely birth. Oh
[1:05:13] yeah. In other words, for nine months,
[1:05:14] we're expecting these w this wonderful
[1:05:16] child or children if it's twins or or
[1:05:18] triplets or something like that. But
[1:05:20] then have that awful disappointment.
[1:05:22] That's what Paul says. That was my life
[1:05:25] when I was persecuting the Christians.
[1:05:26] It's like having an awful disappointment
[1:05:29] of an untimely birth or a miscarriage.
[1:05:35] So we can see how Paul humbled himself.
[1:05:38] Church, it would help us to be a little
[1:05:39] more humble in our Christian life.
[1:05:41] Hallelujah.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; It'd be helpful if we put ourselves
[1:05:44] last.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother Jesse, we got the seven
[1:05:48] seals. I believe that. We've got the
[1:05:49] revelation Godhead. I believe that. But
[1:05:52] let's see how much more humble we can be
[1:05:53] with it rather than how prideful we can
[1:05:55] be with it.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. Look at that. I'm
[1:06:01] almost to verse 11. Can Can you believe
[1:06:02] it? Hallelujah.
[1:06:05] Verse 10. But by the grace of God, I
[1:06:08] love that phrase. But by the grace of
[1:06:10] God.
[1:06:12] I say I say that all the time. By God's
[1:06:13] grace. Right? You hear me say by God's
[1:06:15] grace. By God's grace. By God's grace.
[1:06:16] Brother Jesse. When are you gonna stop
[1:06:17] saying by God's grace? I don't know.
[1:06:19] Maybe when I get raptured,
[1:06:22] but I just want I just want God's grace
[1:06:25] to be a part of all my decisions.
[1:06:31] So other words, Paul says, "My
[1:06:34] persecution of the church was like an
[1:06:36] abortion. And it was so awful. It's like
[1:06:39] I was born out of due time. My uh I was
[1:06:43] persecuting the church. I wish I would
[1:06:44] not have. He said, "But I can't go back
[1:06:47] and change it. By God's grace, I am what
[1:06:50] I am."
[1:06:53] Church, you and I, we can't change the
[1:06:56] past. So, we can't worry about it. We
[1:06:58] can't fret about it. We just have to
[1:07:00] say, "God's grace was there. God's grace
[1:07:03] brought me through it. But God's grace
[1:07:05] is here now. And now God's grace is here
[1:07:08] to lead me forward.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; God's grace, which is his unmmerited
[1:07:15] favor,
[1:07:17] his divine favor. God's going to give
[1:07:19] you favor even though you don't deserve
[1:07:21] it.
[1:07:24] Hallelujah.
[1:07:26] So God's grace empowers your future
[1:07:28] service. We must labor for the kingdom
[1:07:30] of God by the grace of God that is with
[1:07:33] us.
[1:07:35] I love this. His grace which was
[1:07:37] bestowed upon me was not in vain. God
[1:07:40] didn't give me this grace in vain,
[1:07:42] but I labored more abundantly than they
[1:07:45] all than the 500.
[1:07:48] Imagine that. Paul could say, "I worked
[1:07:50] harder than the 500 that actually saw
[1:07:52] him after the resurrection." He can say,
[1:07:55] "I worked harder with the gospel than
[1:07:57] Cphus.
[1:07:59] I worked harder than all 12 of them."
[1:08:03] And they would all admit that, right?
[1:08:05] Because they gave each other the right
[1:08:06] hand of fellowship. In the book of
[1:08:07] Galatians, it says that
[1:08:10] they all recognize Paul was a worker.
[1:08:13] But where did he place himself? He
[1:08:15] placed himself last.
[1:08:17] And then he he doesn't take credit for
[1:08:18] it. Brother Mercy, I love this. He
[1:08:20] doesn't take credit for all the work. He
[1:08:22] gives credit to the grace of God. The
[1:08:25] grace that was with him caused him to
[1:08:27] work harder.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; You don't have to raise your hand, but
[1:08:31] who would like to work harder for God?
[1:08:34] It's not going to be you that does it.
[1:08:36] It's going to be the grace of God.
[1:08:39] So, you will let you will receive the
[1:08:41] grace of God. You'll receive more. The
[1:08:42] Bible said he gives us more grace. Amen.
[1:08:44] There it is. And the Hallelujah. There
[1:08:46] it is. God gives us more grace. So, the
[1:08:50] more you receive of God's gracious word,
[1:08:53] the more you'll want to work for him.
[1:08:59] What have you done to to date for the
[1:09:01] Lord? How many souls have you won?
[1:09:05] Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] How many songs have you sang for the
[1:09:09] Lord? How many people have you witness
[1:09:11] to? How many people have you prayed for?
[1:09:14] Praise God for what you have done. It is
[1:09:17] God's grace that will empower you to do
[1:09:20] more.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; I like what that brother uh remember
[1:09:24] brother David Hawkins came. You remember
[1:09:26] his testimony? He said, "I don't want to
[1:09:29] preach until I've led someone to the
[1:09:31] Lord." I thought that was a good thing.
[1:09:34] But do you remember that? What was his
[1:09:35] testimony after that? Do you remember?
[1:09:38] He said he just preached his his
[1:09:40] testimony and a girl came up, a young
[1:09:42] lady came up, teenager, he prayed for
[1:09:44] her and she started screaming, shouting,
[1:09:45] weeping. She received the Holy Ghost. He
[1:09:47] said, "Well, that's good enough for me."
[1:09:50] Amen. I like that. Hallelujah. See, we
[1:09:53] ask God for things we want, but God's
[1:09:55] going to give us something better than
[1:09:56] what we want. Praise God.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; What is it better to be saved or to
[1:10:00] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost?
[1:10:02] Baptism Holy Ghost because you can lose
[1:10:04] your salvation but you cannot lose the
[1:10:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:09] Amen. I like that. Hallelujah.
[1:10:16] So church, that's what you need to do.
[1:10:17] As we said at the beginning, find your
[1:10:19] position and then invest in that
[1:10:21] position by the grace of God.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; [cough and clears throat]
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. Here we are. We come
[1:10:32] down to the last verse. And the church
[1:10:33] said,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; "We're almost done." 12:00.
[1:10:39] Therefore, whether it were I or they, so
[1:10:42] we preached, and so ye believed.
[1:10:47] So I my thoughts on this. It doesn't
[1:10:49] matter who preached the gospel to you,
[1:10:53] their past. Now, think of the person who
[1:10:55] first preached to you. They have a
[1:10:57] sinful past may not be as sinful as
[1:11:00] mine. May not be as sinful as others,
[1:11:02] but everybody's got a sinful past.
[1:11:06] Who whoever preached the gospel to you,
[1:11:08] whether it was like Peter's details. So,
[1:11:10] think about that.
[1:11:12] Those pe some of those believers could
[1:11:14] have said, "My goodness, Peter preached
[1:11:16] the gospel to me, but Peter also denied
[1:11:18] Christ three times."
[1:11:20] Hallelujah.
[1:11:22] You got saved through the preacher who
[1:11:23] denied him. How do you know that
[1:11:24] preacher is not going to deny him again?
[1:11:28] You don't know. All you know is he says
[1:11:30] he's got the Holy Ghost. Amen. And you
[1:11:33] watch his fruit. You watch his life.
[1:11:34] Hallelujah.
[1:11:36] So what what's Paul saying? Paul's
[1:11:38] placing emphasis on the power of the
[1:11:41] gospel, not on the power of a man.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; So your faith is not in me or any
[1:11:48] preacher or any preacher you knew in
[1:11:50] Ghana. Hallelujah. or Nicaragua.
[1:11:52] Hallelujah. Or uh Toledto, Ohio or
[1:11:55] Delta, Ohio, or wherever you heard a
[1:11:57] preacher, your faith is not in a
[1:11:58] preacher, your faith is in the message
[1:12:01] that the preacher preached. Amen.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; So whether you got saved under Peter,
[1:12:08] the Christ denier but forgiven one,
[1:12:12] under James, the one who refused to
[1:12:14] believe for all those years, but now he
[1:12:16] believes.
[1:12:19] It doesn't change the gospel message
[1:12:22] that Jesus Christ died for your sins. He
[1:12:25] was buried and he was resurrected
[1:12:27] according to God's promised scriptures.
[1:12:30] We should just be thankful and believe
[1:12:32] the gospel message.
[1:12:34] Hallelujah. I'm not sure. I'm closing
[1:12:36] with this. Yep. There's So, I'm going to
[1:12:38] close with this here,
[1:12:42] church. There is no excuses to
[1:12:44] disbelieve.
[1:12:47] Some people say, "Well, I'm not going to
[1:12:48] believe because the preacher." Well, you
[1:12:49] could have said that about James. You
[1:12:51] could have said that about Peter.
[1:12:53] People today are saying, "Well, brother
[1:12:55] Graham did this. Look at Brother
[1:12:56] Graham." Right? I'm not saved because of
[1:12:57] brother Brandham or Billy Graham or O
[1:13:00] Roberts.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I'm saved because of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] And I believe if this was good enough to
[1:13:10] preach to Corinthians who have way more
[1:13:12] tongues, interpretation, and miracles
[1:13:14] than us, then I believe it's good enough
[1:13:16] for us. Hallelujah. No, but they also
[1:13:19] had more sins than we had. Hallelujah.
[1:13:22] They had more gifts, but they also have
[1:13:24] more sins than we have. Because we just
[1:13:26] showed you that long list of sins. And
[1:13:28] church, it seems like from the text,
[1:13:29] they even allowed women preachers
[1:13:31] because why else would he tell them not
[1:13:32] to have women preachers? Why would he
[1:13:34] say that unless they had women
[1:13:36] preachers?
[1:13:37] Hallelujah. So, I could add another one
[1:13:39] to that. Now, they got women with
[1:13:40] dominating female Jezebel spirits
[1:13:42] running the church, trying to tell the
[1:13:44] church what to do, rather than a God-
[1:13:47] called man behind the pulpit who's
[1:13:49] submissive to the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:53] So friends, there's no excuse to
[1:13:55] disbelieve this gospel message.
[1:13:59] Remember what the Bible said. God is
[1:14:01] going to pour out his wrath in the
[1:14:02] sooncoming tribulation period from
[1:14:05] heaven against all ungodliness and
[1:14:08] unrighteousness of men because they hold
[1:14:11] the truth in unrighteousness.
[1:14:13] See, they know the truth, but they live
[1:14:16] a sinful lifestyle.
[1:14:20] Now, here's the two reasons. There's no
[1:14:22] excuses.
[1:14:23] Because that which may be known of God
[1:14:26] is already manifested in them. All you
[1:14:28] have to do is look at your life, your
[1:14:29] mind, your body, your soul, and realize
[1:14:32] there is a God.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody gave me life. Somebody created
[1:14:37] this being. I can think up thoughts. I
[1:14:39] can learn. I can do I can do lots of
[1:14:41] things. Someone gave me this. So, there
[1:14:44] must be a God.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Did you ask to come to Earth? Did you
[1:14:48] ask to have black hair or blonde hair?
[1:14:50] Did you ask to have blue eyes or brown
[1:14:52] eyes? Did you ask? No. Somebody sent you
[1:14:55] here and determined that and showed that
[1:14:58] God was manifesting himself in your
[1:15:00] body.
[1:15:03] Hallelujah. So just looking at your
[1:15:05] body, every person knows there's a God
[1:15:09] and there's no excuses.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] Second, the invisible things of him from
[1:15:15] the creation of the world are clearly
[1:15:17] seen, being understood by things that
[1:15:19] are made.
[1:15:21] So all of creation, the sunrise, the
[1:15:24] sunset, the beautiful snow we had last
[1:15:26] night, right? Everybody think that was
[1:15:27] beautiful lesson. Haven while she was
[1:15:29] dancing out in the snow last night. Just
[1:15:30] such a beautiful snow.
[1:15:33] Every creation, all the animals, right?
[1:15:36] All the insects, all these, we had a
[1:15:38] slug on our window. That's a creation of
[1:15:39] God today.
[1:15:41] All the creation is proof that there's a
[1:15:44] creator.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; All the creation shows his eternal power
[1:15:49] and godhead. So that they are without
[1:15:51] excuse.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; There'll be no excuses on the day of
[1:15:54] judgment.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Because you have a body that God made
[1:15:58] and everything you see is what God made.
[1:16:03] The Bible says the fool says there is no
[1:16:06] God.
[1:16:08] Only a fool is an atheist. And the
[1:16:11] church said,
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; "Because they have to deny everything in
[1:16:14] their body. They have to deny everything
[1:16:16] that their eyes see.
[1:16:19] And they're fools to say there's no
[1:16:21] God." And we'll show you why in just a
[1:16:23] moment. The Bible said the heavens are
[1:16:25] preaching the glory of God to them.
[1:16:28] Every day the the sun and the stars and
[1:16:30] the moon are preaching to every person,
[1:16:33] "God is great. God is mighty. There is a
[1:16:36] God. There is a heaven. There is a hell.
[1:16:39] Everything in the all creation is
[1:16:41] preaching them and God saying just
[1:16:43] believe.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the firminant shows his
[1:16:48] handiwork. My this guy is handy. Talk
[1:16:51] about a handyman. Hallelujah. The day
[1:16:54] utters God's speech. The night shows the
[1:16:57] knowledge of God. How smart God is.
[1:16:59] Watch the stars and the planets.
[1:17:01] Hallelujah. And the constellations,
[1:17:02] you'll see how smart God is.
[1:17:06] Hallelujah. And there is no speech or
[1:17:09] language wherein their voice is not
[1:17:10] heard. Everyone in the face of the whole
[1:17:12] earth from all time all throughout all
[1:17:15] 6,000 years of history is is accountable
[1:17:19] uh to God to believe. And if they don't,
[1:17:21] then they're lost. So what's the real
[1:17:24] reason people are lost?
[1:17:26] Because they don't believe. Why don't
[1:17:28] they believe? Because they love sin more
[1:17:31] than they love righteousness.
[1:17:35] The Jesus Christ said, "This is the
[1:17:37] condemnation that light is coming to the
[1:17:40] world." The Bible's coming to the world,
[1:17:43] but men love darkness rather than light
[1:17:46] because their deeds were evil. That's
[1:17:49] why people will be lost. There's no
[1:17:51] excuses in their body. Their body tells
[1:17:53] them there's a God. All nature preaches
[1:17:55] to them there's a God. The reason
[1:17:57] they'll be lost, 98% in Israel will be
[1:18:00] lost. How many What's the percentage of
[1:18:02] Gentiles? 99.999
[1:18:04] will be lost because they love sin more
[1:18:06] than they loved holiness.
[1:18:10] For everyone that doeth evil hates the
[1:18:12] light, hates the gospel. Neither cometh
[1:18:15] to the light, lest his deed should be
[1:18:16] reproved. So see church, you can't
[1:18:19] remain in your sin and call yourself a
[1:18:20] Christian. If you're a Christian, you
[1:18:22] become Christlike.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Christ did not sin. So if you're a
[1:18:26] Christian, you'll want to stop sinning.
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; But he that doeth the truth cometh to
[1:18:34] the light, that his deeds may be made
[1:18:35] manifest, that they are wrought in God.
[1:18:38] I got two more slides. These are my last
[1:18:40] three last three slides.
[1:18:42] I like what Ray Comfort did. He went up
[1:18:43] to these guys at the uh their doctorates
[1:18:46] of uh biology, their doctorates of
[1:18:48] science, and he said, "Is do you believe
[1:18:51] in intelligent designer?" And they said,
[1:18:53] "No, we don't believe in intelligent
[1:18:54] designer." He said, "No." And then he
[1:18:56] said, "Okay, design me a brand new rose.
[1:18:58] Design me one." They said, "I can't."
[1:19:01] And he said, "But you got to start with
[1:19:03] your own materials. You can't use God's,
[1:19:06] right?"
[1:19:08] Because God started without any God
[1:19:10] created it. He spoke the word and it
[1:19:12] existed.
[1:19:14] And they say, "Well, I can't I I can't
[1:19:15] design one." And he said, "Well, then
[1:19:17] how intelligent are you? If you can't
[1:19:20] designs, if a rose is so is not
[1:19:22] intelligent and you can't do one, that
[1:19:24] makes you very unintelligent.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; But what does it speak? It speaks that
[1:19:30] God intelligent intelligently designed
[1:19:33] everything.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; So that's the first one I like to say.
[1:19:38] Did the Mona Lisa paint itself? No. A
[1:19:41] painter declares I'm sorry, a painting
[1:19:43] declares there's a painter. Did the
[1:19:45] Golden Gate Bridge build itself? No. A
[1:19:47] building or structure requires a
[1:19:49] builder. Creation requires a creator.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] And the last one is like a book. Would
[1:19:59] anybody believe this book right here
[1:20:02] could just somehow fall from the sky and
[1:20:04] all the language and all the symbols
[1:20:06] would just be created by random
[1:20:08] accident? Does anybody believe that
[1:20:09] nonsense? If so, you're a fool.
[1:20:13] No, it was intelligently designed. So
[1:20:15] Ray Comfort says, "If this wasn't
[1:20:18] designed by something, if this was
[1:20:19] designed, how much greater is God the
[1:20:22] designer?" Because your body's full of
[1:20:24] many books of life. Your body's full of
[1:20:27] cells that have DNA. And DNA is called
[1:20:30] the book of life. And the DNA is way
[1:20:33] longer than this book right here.
[1:20:36] Hallelujah. And there's billions times
[1:20:38] trillions of cells in your body. And
[1:20:41] each one of them has a book of life
[1:20:44] inside of it that tells your body how
[1:20:46] tall you're going to be. What color eyes
[1:20:48] you're going to have. How long your
[1:20:50] eyelashes are going to be, whether long
[1:20:53] or short.
[1:20:55] Hallelujah. How big or small your nose
[1:20:57] is. Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] There's already a book of life inside of
[1:21:02] every single cell. So if it's impossible
[1:21:05] for this to create itself, so is it
[1:21:07] impossible for your entire body to be
[1:21:09] created.
[1:21:10] Aren't you glad you are not a fool?
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[1:21:14] come.
[1:21:16] Hallelujah.
[1:21:19] Hallelujah. Let's bow our hearts here
[1:21:22] today.
[1:21:26] Dear God, we're thankful, Lord God, to
[1:21:28] know exactly how Paul started the
[1:21:31] church.
[1:21:32] Lord, it seems like maybe our church was
[1:21:34] started on the water baptism in the name
[1:21:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ. and there's
[1:21:38] one God and the revelations that you
[1:21:40] gave us. But eventually, God, we came
[1:21:41] down to this same starting spot that
[1:21:45] Jesus Christ died for our sins.
[1:21:48] Hallelujah.
[1:21:51] He was buried.
[1:21:53] He rose on the third day according to
[1:21:54] the scriptures.
[1:21:59] He was resurrected for our
[1:22:02] justification, our being made righteous.
[1:22:05] Lord, help the people to remember today
[1:22:08] the curse is gone. The loosing is
[1:22:12] perfect.
[1:22:15] We are wise because we believe in God,
[1:22:18] not fools. Only fools would say
[1:22:23] that a painting painted itself.
[1:22:29] Thank you, God, for the wisdom of the
[1:22:30] Holy Ghost. Lord God,
[1:22:33] thank you for showing us your eternal
[1:22:35] power and godhead. Thank you for the
[1:22:37] good news. And I pray if anyone is
[1:22:39] struggling with their salvation, I pray
[1:22:42] they'll remember
[1:22:45] the simple gospel message
[1:22:48] that Jesus Christ died to take all of
[1:22:50] our sins, [music] died to take our
[1:22:52] curse, and they can be forgiven and know
[1:22:55] that they're going to heaven. they can
[1:22:58] have an assurance of their salvation
[1:23:00] today.
[1:23:01] Oh God, may the people not
[1:23:04] lose the mind battle to the devil. May
[1:23:06] they overcome by the grace of God.
[1:23:08] Hallelujah. May they fight the good
[1:23:10] fight of faith. Hallelujah. May they
[1:23:13] cast out anything that exalts itself
[1:23:15] against the word of God.
[1:23:21] May your people come to the light, dear
[1:23:24] God.
[1:23:25] May they love holiness and may they hate
[1:23:28] sin.
[1:23:30] May each and every person be saved
[1:23:32] today. If they're not, may they come
[1:23:34] forward to be saved. Lord, I pray.
[1:23:38] Lord Jesus,
[1:23:40] the gospel remains powerful. Hallelujah.
[1:23:44] The simple revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:47] dying for our sins,
[1:23:49] being buried, and raising for our
[1:23:51] justification. Thank you, God, that
[1:23:53] there's no condemnation to our
[1:23:56] our lives, Lord God. No man can lay
[1:23:59] anything to our charge. We're forgiven.
[1:24:02] We were chosen in Christ and were
[1:24:04] adopted into the family of God. We bless
[1:24:07] your holy name for these great truths.
[1:24:10] Bless your people. Deal with your
[1:24:11] people, I pray today, in Jesus Christ's
[1:24:14] name.
