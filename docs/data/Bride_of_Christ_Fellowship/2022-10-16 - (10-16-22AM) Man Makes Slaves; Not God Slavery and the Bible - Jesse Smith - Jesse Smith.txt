take our Bibles here today it's going to be in the house of the Lord amen beautiful song brother I appreciate that Hallelujah let's go to Exodus chapter 21. I was telling you in July I like to preach on slavery in the Bible so I'd like to preach on that this morning I've had a little more time to study on that and um of course we're going to look at you know we'll finish with the spiritual element to it by God's grace that we want to be the Lord's free man Hallelujah we don't want to be in bondage God has called us to live spiritually free Hallelujah so we can serve God in the beauty of Holiness praise God not in bondage to the things of the world Exodus chapter 21 verse one Exodus 21 verse 1. Hallelujah Keisha are all the other ones muted all the other ones thank you appreciate that Exodus chapter 21 verse 1. I know the brother Austin was talking about you know this topic being one he could share so I'm hoping that we'll um we'll get a good recording brother and if you feel led to share it with your friend you could share with your friend by the grace of God those are all great questions you know uh you know really Church you know with a carnal mind the carnal mind cannot understand the things of God so someone who's in darkness you know they're not spiritual they'll read a passage and they'll see something totally that's not even God is not even trying to say but a Believer who's filled with the Holy Spirit can read that same thing and they'll see the truth of God's word they'll see the beauty of God's word they'll see God's love and protection because they have the Holy Spirit praise God but someone who doesn't they cannot even see it because their mind is still in bondage they're under the spirit of Disobedience to the things of the world but we are under the spirit of obedience praise God we're under the spirit of wisdom and knowledge and and uh and might we would say so Exodus chapter 21 verse 1. girl this uh these first 11 verses is kind of a context we'll read it we'll read it in its fullness later on Lord willing during the service but I'll just read the beginning Let's uh why don't we read we'll read one to three okay I'll read one and two and then we'll we'll all join our voices for verse three now these are the judgments which Thou shalt set before them if thou by in Hebrew servant six years He Shall Serve and the seventh he shall go out free for nothing now let's read verse three one two three if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him amen so of course this is you know this is even before the I'm sorry this is right after the Ten Commandments were given God is giving Moses instruction once the people get in the land he's saying this is how you're to operate in the land and you're going to see this is God's system of Grace God is very gracious when people go through hard times you know when people would go through hard times God would have a system established so they could get back on their feet it really is a beautiful system it's a it's a system of God's love and his care his compassion let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make anointing to God here father God we've opened your word we've read your word this word is a light unto our feet and a lamp unto our path we've hidden your word in our heart that we might not sin against you Lord God thank you for these beautiful promises Lord again this topic Lord magnifies your grace Hallelujah and we thank you Lord for the Natural Freedom in America Lord that we have so many men and women bled and died to give us this Natural Freedom so we thank you Lord Jesus for that Lord and father help us as we as we look at this topic Lord to be able to help other people Lord with this topic and Lord ultimately the the end result for us Lord is that we would be spiritually free we would not be spiritual slaves to sin Hallelujah but we will be be your free Sons and Daughters Lord God to serve you in the beauty of Holiness Lord in the freedom and the uh the victory of the Holy Spirit Lord God we pray you Lord you minister to us the Lord God I'm a little nervous but God just help me Lord and God may just yield to your spirit May each person have have a part to play in this service Lord God Hallelujah Lord you said uh the ministers and the laity work together Lord It's a body Ministry let life flow one to another Lord God hallelujah if there's gifts to operate Lord may they operate Lord Jesus and Lord before service during service after service Lord May the gifts of the holy spirit move here God For Your Glory may we all have a personal Revival today Lord Jesus as we've been looking at Lord that beautiful topic Lord God that we can have renewed Minds today Lord God hallelujah we can be free today so Lord we thank you for this freedom in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so my subtitle will be man-make slaves not God because that's an exact quote from Brother Branham man makes slaves not God all right so we can switch over I got just a few slides we're doing some lengthy Bible reading Lord willing here uh this morning here by God's grace also just so you know this week I've been working on some new uh YouTube videos I don't have them out yet but I'm going to look at the Nephilim Nephilim is the word Giants in Genesis 6 4 there were giants in the earth in those days there was Nephilim in the earth in those days so I'm working on that script I got that done I just got to record it and then the other one I was looking at there's a quote uh brother random says thus saith the Lord if a woman cuts her hair a man can divorce his wife okay now that's all he says but people have asked me about that quote numerous times over the years so I'm making a video about that I'm I'm almost done with the script and of course I've shared it with you and just you know for a for a witness for the uh the live stream any man that would divorce his wife for cutting her hair I question if that man is saved because yes she may have Dishonored him by cutting her hair but has he ever Dishonored her by being angry with her being bitter with her the answer is yes because in marriage we see our best and we see our our worst and of course Satan will take that quote and he will use that quote to to convince Brothers to commit adultery brother random in that quote if you if you look at the quote brother and what he said is true but God at the same time God hates divorce right and if I'm and and in that context when the Bible was written and when uh and even the days of brother Brandon they were just coming out of a time when it was so holy you know America was a holy nation it you know was coming out of that and brother Brown was he was striking at the women he was striking at them telling them it's a shame you cut your hair and the context he was talking about the woman who washed Jesus feet and washed it with his own hair and he said women today are so shameful by cutting their hair he said you'd have to stand on your head to wash Jesus's feet today so in the context brother Adams rebuking American women for cutting their hair he says what shame you have on you this is in 1956 now same year Elvis became really famous that's the year America turned it down too there there's another one I didn't thought I didn't think about that that's your America turned on the Revival because it was 50 years from 1906 and if you look at the quote uh it's true because the word dishonor the word dishonor means to bring a great shame it means to be a repulse so a woman that would cut her hair is a repulse to her husband that means like I want to get away that's how much disrespect and shame it is right by the same time a man can disrespect his wife right so brother man is making a point he's driving a point home it is an utter disgrace for a woman to cut her hair and he's preaching it to a group that won't repent of it right and so he's laying out the word of God now also we've got to be very careful what Satan does he will add to that quote it's true what brother random said but Satan will add and see you so we'll we'll yes the man could divorce and then Satan will say well now you can remarry no he can't that if a man would divorce his wife for cutting her hair he is destined to be single till he dies unless his wife he put away dies right and if he marries again he's living in adultery and he's causing uh the woman with him to live in adultery so I'm going to blast that one here pretty soon by God's grace right there because Satan has done that so much in the message because these people they don't study the Bible they don't fall in love with Jesus Christ they might have a partial love for Jesus at the beginning but then they get more in tapes than they do in the Bible and you've got to have a balance her brother said to grow in love for God he said stay in the Bible and read your Bible and pray every day and that's what these people fail to do um anyways I'm gonna I'm kind of I kind of want to blast that pretty hard but uh I guess I kind of did but uh by God's grace we want to uh address that here I want to make a video on that I think it'd be a good topic so a man makes slaves not God God never made slaves uh God God allows it of course as a test remember all your difficulties in life are trials all these difficulties obstacles their tests of your faith and what I love is that God will never give you something that's too difficult and God knows you're going to pass the test praise God whatever you go through whatever he allows in his wisdom to come to pass he knows I have strengthened brother so-and-so I've strengthened sister so and so so much I know when the trial comes they may battle they may fight with it for a few days or weeks but ultimately they're going to get the victory because they are more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus my son amen and church you know I was a brother amen and I were texting this week you know uh we we all go through years of Silence brother Branham says years of silence and I sent brother amen a good uh good quote brother random says that when he's talking about the Widow of xeropath she had seen this three and a half year drought of Elijah go on for one year two years three years and they're crying out for three years where are you God where are you send rain and for three years it seems like God is silent and God lets it go to the very last measure of meal that she had and she's like I'm gonna die this is the last one God so got it for three and a half years God had never intervened and said I'm gonna send you Elijah right but was God loving the whole time you better believe he's a did God but did God have a plan yes God had a plan God had trials you know you've got to allow these trials he was allowing this to test the people to show them that they'd allowed idolatry to rise up in Israel but God thank God he had a prophet amen and he had seven thousand not seven hundred he had seven thousand who not bowed a knee to bail praise God but we make those mistakes all the time right we all do praise God like I guess I on my podcast somebody said they really liked our podcast brother amen yesterday and they said I cited acts 17 11 rather than Matthew 17 11. so I said well brother man did all the time I do it all the time too I I'm just citing the wrong verse but see God many times will allow us to go through trials and I love how God at the last moment he comes he said I got one more measure left and that's when Elijah came and said give that to me first put God first and everything else will be added unto you Hallelujah and the other example the other example Brother Bear gave was that three Hebrew children during that whole time from the time they didn't bow to the image up until the very moment they stepped in the fire they didn't hear from God but let me say like this they had heard from God before because they'd heard from God and they have a they had a revelation I Will Not Bow the knee to a false idol praise God Amen so see even though they never even in the trial we'd say the trial leading up to the the execution or the martyrdom they never heard a specific voice from God but they'd heard enough before that amen they'd heard through the word or they heard God speak to they and God was testing them are you going to stand with what you've already heard praise God and so so it is with our trials God wants us to stand in the word that we've already heard praise God and just like David you know with the lion and the bear godlin says when our next Goliath comes God wants us to live off the testimony of the past if God was God in the past he's God of the president Hallelujah amen praise God and I just told amen you know think about 430 Years Egypt I'm sorry Israel is in Egypt as slaves which we're going to get to and eat that that was ten Generations almost 11 Generations because the generation is 40 years okay think what if you were in the first generation God we prayed for 40 years bring us out of slavery and God didn't answer what if you're in the second generation oh God my my parents were in slavery for 40 years God bring us out bring us out and God let it go on third fourth generation fifth generation six seven eight nine ten eleven all these Generations and each one had to trust in God and many of them were faithful because it eventually produced a jock a bed amen which produced a Moses hallelujah praise God in other words church we just got to be faithful to what God has revealed to us God will give us Supernatural experiences but it's all in God's time and season but we what we should know enough that angels are in this room right now praise God Amen because he said the angel Lord and camps around those that fear God hallelujah Hallelujah so God expects us in our in our trials God expects us to live off the Revelation he's already revealed to us and not forget it and to trust him and keep all that we know keep all the Commandments that we know be a faithful witness it's a test it's a trial but you will pass the test the trial will end this too shall pass and there'll be a season of rest and victory praise God Hallelujah I just thought I'd start with that introduction there now here's the quote brother Brown talks about this so brother and I talked about if there was slavery in the South this is in 1963 he said uh if those people were slaves I take my church and go south to help them people out of slavery I sure would because man makes slaves not God and that quote has always stuck with me in relation to this subject uh we're all of One blood we all come from One Tree and that was from Adam God by one blood has made all nations and whether we our colors are brown or black or yellow red whatever it might be We're All Creatures the almighty see and there shouldn't be any differences in US praise God Hallelujah so the question was you know Austin and I were talking about that this summer does God permit and allow slavery uh well I guess I could re-reword this a little bit um God doesn't ordain slavery but God does permit it and allow it right because he allows sin he allows people to make bad decisions he allows people to make good decisions as well um so yeah let me just let me just change that real quick here so I'll say yes he permits it here um but yeah let's just go with that here by God's grace sorry I'm kind of updating it on the Fly here so yes he permitted it because he permitted slavery you know Israel to be slaves in Egypt now he allowed though two different forms of servant systems in Israel once they got into the Promised Land uh the first one was totally different from the second one the first one was purchase Heathen servants so any Heathen that was not an Israelite they could purchase and that person was theirs forever okay and that and so that individual had different rights than a Jewish person who is of their own tribe and of their own Kindred right another own blood well I'm sorry one blood but of their own uh family now the one that that we read in Exodus 21 the other system was a voluntary so it wasn't forced right there was no forced servitude with the with the Jewish people the Heathen servants were that was that that was forced uh because they they allowed it that was the that was part of the the world system at that time um but the Jewish system was voluntary it was based on a contract and they got paid okay so that's the one that most of us uh should be familiar with there as far as the scriptures in the Bible so the example is Genesis 29 now I'm not going to spend much time on this but Church remember Jacob is running for his life he's running for his life you know he thinks Esau is going to kill him and no doubt he would because he said he was going to do it he goes he leaves and he doesn't even know where he's going of course God knew where he's going Hallelujah God knows where all of us are going amen and remember he has that experience with God he makes a pillow of us out of a stone praise God and then he sleeps that night he sees the vision of the uh of Jacob's Ladder you know Angels ascending and descending praise God and he says this is none other than the house of the Lord praise God and then he anoints the stone the stone with oil praise God well really he's traveling and and you know on this journey he knows God's going to be with him and he said Lord whatever you give me I'll surely give you a tenth of all that you give me praise God if you'll be my God hallelujah and if you'll give me what I need one of the food and everything I'll surely give a tenth of it praise God so then we know the story he goes and he meets Laban and then notice he had nothing so when he got there all he could do was let me at your mercy Laban so that means Laban is going to give him clothes for seven years food everything else that he needs a shelter that's a pretty big that's a pretty big contract well you're gonna you're from you're going to provide all my shampoo all my toothbrush and all my toothpaste and you're gonna provide all my new clothes and yes I'll provide all that but you got to serve me for seven years so she had nothing and so this is uh this is the the system that God had built in there and I like it too you know once he gets there now everything that God gave Jacob he made sure he paid tithes and offerings on it as well amen hallelujah tithes and offerings and I wonder who his priest was I'm not sure who his priest was at that time Hallelujah but maybe they would just sacrifice to God maybe he would just sacrifice the tenth of God I'm not sure so he worked seven years for Rachel and of course and then he gets Leah well then well that's the custom of the land apparently and then so he has to work seven more uh to get Rachel he was under a contract right and he even got mistreated and it's a good lesson even if you get mistreated and you're serving God and you're doing what's right God will vindicate you in time because God Vindicated In Time by giving him more animals and he became more Rich than Laban and even when he left laban's like you sure we don't want you to go and Layman made sure don't marry any more women right because he had two daughters and two concubines and he promised he promised Laban I won't marry any other I'll just have your daughters and the two concubines but he leaves so much richer because he was a tie payer amen hallelujah he believed in the power of God hallelujah he was a real believer praise God and he kept his contract look he didn't break his contract he kept his contract praise God that's our Christians should be we should keep our contracts amen we should be men and women of our word hallelujah now what do you think do you think Jacob was grateful for these contracts or think he was uh upset about him I'd say he's grateful don't you if you had somebody that was if you were destitute had nothing you were a Wanderer and somebody took you in and fed you and clothed you for seven years that person would be very dear to you I think don't you think Church so we start seeing in the Bible we start seeing this this contractual system uh these the servant system uh right away now of course Jacob was before Moses but we see this system is already built in seven years was like a good uh contractual contractual length of course they knew the seven days of creation seven days in a week they would have known that and so this was kind of already built into the system okay and so there was a just so you know there's a couple good YouTube videos I watched that had some good uh teachings on this so that's kind of where I got the format of this and a couple online uh documents I read because it was a really good uh really good question there from Brother Austin here now I want to go over this to get your Bible handy let's go over I've always wondered about this there was two types of uh two types of jubilees okay there was a seven year seven year period and you could go out free uh but then there was a 50-year jubilee so I want to read over these we'll spend a little time on these we might as well you know uh this is a good question and it's good good Bible context here and you're remember all scripture is profitable for Doctrine for teaching instruction and training in righteousness that the man or woman of God may be thorough and ready unto all good works praise God this is going to help you somehow this is going to help us some way praise God okay so let's go to Exodus 21 or 1 to 11. now we already read verses one to three if a man comes in and he says like like Jacob or if he needs if he needs food shelter clothing I'll serve you for seven years if he comes in he goes out by himself and in this at the end of the seven years if he comes in married his wife goes out with him but verse 4 if his master have given him a wife and she have borne him Sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her Masters and he shall go out by himself now do you think a real husband would like that no so he'd have to stay and work for them okay his master gave him a wife now verse five and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an awe and he shall serve him forever so there's the first earring in the Bible I'm sorry not the first but that's one that that's a sign of an earring because there are earrings that date in Rebecca's days they're probably clip-ons right because we never see God wanting his children to uh purposely scar their bodies right or cut their bodies or scrape their bodies or anything like that but here we see the first like modern day earring where an ear is actually punctured through and and given a jewelry of that type of Mark okay so this is for the man who says I don't want to go free I Don't Want to Be Free now look at that God has a distinct Mark God has a public uh undistinguishable undeniable mark this person doesn't want to be free they want to be a slave the rest of their life they want to they want to be a servant the rest of their life and brother Adam uses this uh to do a type of the New Testament praise God when a person doesn't want to be free in Christ but the man said they're marked in the ear by Satan in other words they won't hear what the spirit is saying praise God that's like crossing the line between mercy and judgment right they don't want to be free they don't want to be God's free man they want to be a servant to sin they want to be a servant to uh to slavery they don't want to be free but Jesus today is offering us freedom praise God Amen just like this man he can be free it was his choice but whatever you choose you got to live with your choice amen but God is gracious to give us a choice how many could say Amen to that see forever and I said brother man uses it as a type of the mark of the beast as well I think it's in the 1953 sermon the mark of the beast of 1954 if I'm not mistaken he uses this God God gives him a chance you can be free you can be free or you cannot be it's your choice but if you don't then your ear is going to be marked where you will not be able to hear the sound for Freedom anymore verse 7 if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant she shall not go out as men's servants do now we're going to get to this later some people say like I think Austin was told this some people say well the Bible says a man could sell his daughter as a sex slave that's an absolute lie that's so wicked that somebody would think that but that's what you get when you're a carnal mind and you read the Bible because we'll get to some other ones this so this is a big question uh people have but we'll get to a little later okay so if he sells his daughter he should not go out as men's servants do if she pleases not her master who hath betrothed her to himself then she then shout he let her be redeemed so if she doesn't please her she could be redeemed she could be bought back okay to sell her unto a strange Nation he shall have no power so we're not to sell them to other strange Nations keep them in the Jewish community see seeing yet dealt deceitfully with her see that would be a bad thing to do to want to sell her off to some strange lands in other words take care of your family members right take care of your people you're God's people you're not to treat each other wrong treat each other with dignity treat each other with respect praise God your chosen people you're a covenant people praise God verse 9. and if he hath betrothed her unto his son he shall deal with her after the manner of daughter so look now you're she's a part of your family basically right in verse 10. and if he take him another wife her food her aiment and her duty of marriage he shall not diminish so he already betrothed her unto himself and if she doesn't please him he cannot treat her any less he still got it because he gave that vow he gave that betrayal and God makes us keep our vows so you could say well she doesn't please me but I've still got to give her the food everything that I promised her I still got to give her that equal rights as a wife see that see so people will read verse seven they'll read verse seven and think oh God allowed men to sell their daughters as sex slaves that's a bunch of they just look there's they just got to read three more verses down and they're so lazy they won't even do that they'll just take what somebody says that's called slandering the name of the Lord that's close to blasphemy slander In The Name Of The Lord see Satan's trying to slant he doesn't see that's his job Satan's job is to slander the Lord right to make him look bad but if you keep reading that's why the Bible says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and there they which testify of Christ Hallelujah search them day and night praise God search them every day and you'll find truth hallelujah my word is a lamp unto your feet and a light into your path verse 11 and if he do not these three unto her then she shall go out free without money okay so she goes out free now of course the church and just so you know just a broad generalization many Jews still did Even though God had these laws of Moses many Jews still did wrong things that's why I had they had to set up judges somebody had it just like today we're supposed to file the law but if not there's got to be some judge who actually makes some enforcer like a police department right they have to enforce these laws and make sure they're enforced but if it's not done she goes out as the Bible says just like that she goes out free so she gets her Freedom back now she was sold into this service right but then she gets her Freedom back if the if the if uh all the requirements are not met so see look God allows your freedom back see not forever allows the freedom back okay so there's so there's this in chapter 21 you get this this term that these servant contracts were generally seven years generally seven year long service contracts all right now let's go a little Leviticus 25 now this is a big long chapter I may do some speed reading in here so it may sound like I'm reading that twice speed here because this is a lot of reading but it's going to be good for us to cover this topic that's what I love about being a pastor I can cover all the topics I want to cover praise God next week in Albion I can't cover all the topics so I got to choose the one topics I feel better than the Lord of course I feel that Lord this morning but I just love the fact I have all this time I can teach you the whole counsel of God by God's grace because God is teaching me that Council I'm learning and God is helping us all learn together praise God Leviticus 25 verses one to seven Schofield calls the law of the land the sabbatic year and the Lord spoke unto Moses and Mount Sinai saying Speak unto the children of Israel and saying them when ye come into the land which I give you then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six years Thou shalt sow thy field and six years Thou shalt prune thy Vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord Thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy Vineyard that which groweth of its own accord of the Harvest Thou shalt not reap neither gather The Grapes of thine thine undress for it is a year of rest unto the land and the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant so here see there's some servants there's some Maids they can have these seven year contracts right and for thy stranger that Sojourner is with thee okay so there's even laws here in the Bible where if a stranger just wandered in maybe it's like uh what do they call the people that come when there's uh well like immigrants but because of War they're allowed into the land what do they call those refugees that's the word there I don't know why I can't remember some of these words so even refugees if there was other problems in other nations they had Hebrews were required to help them out and God tells us why because you were a refugee in Egypt you just couldn't say no you're not I mean they could say that but then God would judge them for that they would they would suffer for that they were supposed to open their home and say come on in because we were servants one time in Egypt but God delivered us but so we're going to show the same Grace God showed to us we're going to show it to everybody else verse 7 and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat now some of you know this but Israel was given this and they as a nation they never fully followed this in other words they didn't take the seventh year off so who knows what happened remember the days of Daniel 70 years they had to be kicked out because those were the 70 jubilees that they didn't follow that's why it was 70. why were we get that 70. it was 70 Jubilee so 70 times 50. all those years they were there and they didn't honor God's word so God said because you haven't honored you haven't given the land rest I'm kicking you out to give the land rest but God was faithful and he brought them back amen talk about Second Chances amen hallelujah you haven't kept my word for for 70 70 jubilees you've rejected it but I'm gonna bring you back praise God and I'll give you a chance to to keep the word of God again he said a suckling a mother may forget her suckling child but I cannot forgive Israel praise God because he's graving in the palm of my hands Hallelujah in other words I'm gonna have a messiah I'm going to send a Jewish Messiah for my people and his name is going to be Jesus Hallelujah and he shall save the people from their sins amen thank God we're safe from our sins Hallelujah Hallelujah verse now verses 8 through 24 Scofield caused the law of the land the Year of Jubilee and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be Unity 40 and nine years then Thou shalt I'm sorry then shout thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the land of the of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return listen every man unto his possession and he shall return every man unto his family so every 50 years if if any family member wasn't with their immediate family they got to go back if anybody lost their land think about that you had to go you went bankruptcy and you lost all your land every 50 years you got that land back see God was not trying to let it become a monopoly where the one Jewish family owns everything and everybody's a slave to him or their family God would allow you whatever was yours at the beginning your families God's allowing you to get it back praise God hallelujah what a God of redemption praise God verse 11 a jubilee shot that 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that which growth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of thy Vine undress for it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the Year of Jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession and if thou sell ought unto Thy Neighbor or by us ought of thy neighbor's hand ye shall not oppress one another so see even in these servant relationships there was no oppression later we're going to see the word rigor there was no severity or cruelness now was there some corporal punishment yes we'll get to that right even in America there was corporal punishment until up about what the 1940s or 50s or 60s uh they they finally they started taking you know rods out of the schools they used to be able to spank kids yeah maybe in the 60s or 70s I don't know I don't remember the exact I had a history I had a I had a class at the University of Akron College school law one year and I used to know back then but I don't know anymore okay because I can't remember all the details of that but it was a good class school law was a really good class I learned I learned a lot about the law but I forgot it all um so God did not allow oppression so in these servant relationships you had to treat them with a lot of respect you had to provide everything for them verse 15. according to the number of years after the Jubilee Thou shalt die of thy neighbor and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee according to the multitude of years Thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years Thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits death he sounded now this is a bit confusing to me but in other words um you know there was if there was a lot of years to the Jubilee there'd be a certain cost like you might buy land like if there was 48 years left to the next Jubilee that price might there be a certain price of that but if there's less the price might be higher because you only get that land for a few a few years so the longer it was to the Jubilee the less it costs the closer you got the more it costs right because you don't get that land for as long as you as you could have because there's so it's kind of like prorated there's a pro rated cost for things right all right so hopefully we can see that by God's grace verse 17 you shall not therefore oppress one another but Thou shalt fear thy God for on the Lord your God see there's no oppression it's fairness you work with fairness if someone's in a hard time and they need you to buy their land just get some money and you need to hire them to be a servant then do it you're going to help them out it's going to help you out too praise God but do not oppress one another verse 18. wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land safely and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety so see they had to give the servants the same amount of food if you're full you got to give your servants a full amount of food there was no mistreatment like in in the South you know all these years ago in the 1800s there was that was a totally different system that wasn't a bible-based system that was a sinful Wicked system here in America but that was all over the world at that time thank God it's mostly and it was Christians that got rid of that system praise God Hallelujah verse 20. and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold We Shall Not So neither gather an increase that I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years look at that my how many believe God is a god of increase amen how many know that in one apple seed all the apples that are going to be in that seat are from that tree are already in that seed so God would Supernatural in that in that sixth year if if they in that seventh year if if they were decided I'm we're going to live by faith we're going to give this year a rest now of course they never did it all right but if if they had believed by faith God would supernaturally allow that that seed all the DNA and the chromosomes in that apple seed God would allow all the all the DNA to work out there so the fruit would produce three times the amount of fruit right because God is the author of life amen that's God's Book of Life that's God's instruction book amen man tries to break in there and yeah he can break in there and he can genetically modify it but there's nobody that can modify it like God can modify it amen Hallelujah imagine a apple tree apple tree seed that would produce three times the number of apples you've seen it right Malachi I've seen him out there on the orchard right imagine three times of what they actually produced in one year because God was going to bless them for trusting his word amen look at that church God was going to bless them for taking a year-long vacation now how many of you would like a year on long vacation I could say Amen to that I wish every seven years I got a year off you know wouldn't that be awesome I have to go to work for a whole year I'm thankful for the two and a half years or two and a half months I get off every year I'm thankful for that but God's system was I'm going to give you a vacation every seventh year and you don't got to work you just got to trust me in that sixth year don't be tempted just trust me and my spiritual law will go to work and I'll make those seeds produced three times as much it's biblical remember Isaac trusted God and the Bible said Isaac's uh plants produce a hundred fold way above their normal production because Isaac trusted the Lord he planted in faith Hallelujah and he reaped in righteousness amen Hallelujah God's asking them to trust me and I will put a blessing on you if you'll just trust me Hallelujah just like we know what ties and offerings for the New Testament verse 22 and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until our fruits come and ye shall eat of the old store the land shall not be sold forever the land look at this for the land is mine now that's the attitude we need everything I got is actually God's my car my home by my cars rather my home my job my clothes my children everything I got is already God's and I understand that so I Fear God and I keep his commands Hallelujah but I know when I do that then he'll bless me praise God for your strangers and sojourners with me so look God even tells Israel really you're strangers of this world you're sojourners really you're on a journey with me amen Peter says we're pilgrims and strangers Church hallelujah thank God now this is our home eventually but here we're pilgrims and strangers until we pass away or get raptured then we go up to the marriage suffer the lamb that's really our real home is with God because that's where we started amen we start in the mind of Christ that's our reason whoever Jesus is that's where we are amen that's that's our real home praise God we're really pilgrims and sojourners here on this Earth praise God we're not supposed to get used to this life on Earth although we want God's blessing because our real home is wherever Jesus is amen that's our real home because we were chosen in his mind before the foundation of the world I told that to the middle schools this week so I was preaching them on Tuesday morning at 7 7 30 a.m I was preaching them I said you know where you started middle schoolers uh I said you think you started in Copley they're like yeah I said no it's actually the mind of Christ if you're a Christian you are in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world Hallelujah I said now he said you know where you come from now you ought to now he gave you a Bible that has his mind you came out of his mind now I gave you a Bible that teaches you his mind now now you need to invest in that Bible so you know his mind so you can go back to him praise God hallelujah he sent you here you get to know him here then you go back to him Hallelujah and then you're forever with him eternally praise God oh it's a beautiful plan amen it's a beautiful it's a beautiful teaching there see where pilgrims and sojourners here we're going back to where we came from praise God wherever Jesus is that's my hometown Hallelujah a Bible calls it motherland that's your motherland verse 24 and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for the land see everything that was yours you are going to get it back no matter how hard your life gets no matter how difficult things were in the Jewish time if it was given to your family by by redemption or by by inheritance you will get it back whether through hard work and working through contracts then you can so you work for seven years save up your money and then try to go buy your land back right if not you got to keep working so you can go get that land back but either way by the time that 50 year comes that you believe you're getting your land back praise God that predestinated that ordained land that God had given for you praise God Hallelujah little did I know growing up in Liberty Center Ohio three hours away little did I know God had a little inheritance out for me on uh 94 Route 94 in Doylestown Ohio I never knew that that was my little piece of predestinated land there everybody God's grace that's my little uh that's my little uh land of possession Hallelujah I just had to walk into that and church I'm glad I got a 30-year uh loan on that by God's grace I'm glad it's not seven years I couldn't pay that off in seven years right so I like how we have this 30-year loan instead of a seven year loan of course we have a massive inflation these days you know but God had a little predestinated physical plot of land for my family and I praise God I'm grateful for it amen but remember all the land is the Lord's anyway it's all God's we're just borrowing it for a little time in season praise God verse 25. If thy brother be waxed important here it is see here's why people would become servants voluntarily they'd be waxing poor and has sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold she could if your brother lost something you could buy it back for him and if the man have done none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the over plus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession so again you have to look at how many years has it been in uh under us and I'll pay whatever's left of that that price but if he not be able to restore it unto him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the Year of Jubilee and the Jubilee shall go out and he shall return unto his possession and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled City now brother uses this as a type as well so let's let's look at this one if he sells a dwelling house in a walled City then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it so it's a walled City now notice the land is very limited in a walled City cities were much smaller of course than the broad or the broad lands he's got one year if he sells his possession in the city he's only got one year to buy it back okay verse 30. and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled City shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout his Generations it shall not go out into the Jubilee now program uses that somehow as a type of denominationalism because it's walled in like a denomination walls you in praise God so that's that's how brother random uses that I don't quite understand it all the way but I'm sure God will reveal that to me if I need it verse 31 but the houses of the villagers which have no wall around about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the Jubilee so I guess you can't redeem a denomination but you can redeem a free land praise God Hallelujah that's that I can see that type verse 32 notwithstanding the cities of the Levites in the house of the cities of their possession May the Lee rights redeem at any time so Levites could redeem anything because they had a smaller portion right they were not given great amounts of land like all the other uh 12 or 11 tribes rather verse 33 and if a man purchased of the Levites then the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out in the year of his Jubilee for the house of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold for it is their Perpetual possession all right now here's another poor brother verse 35. and If thy brother be waxing poor and fallen in Decay with thee then Thou shalt relieve him Thou shalt what mock him should we should we ever mock the poor no God says show them some relief because you don't know what's happened maybe it was their own mistake but do we want to show Mercy yes because what if we made a mistake do we want God to be merciful to us yes we want God to show Mercy relieve him yea though though he be a stranger or a Sojourner that he may live with thee so now even if it's your brother or an Egyptian or a moabite or someone who's not of the faith if they're waxing poor show Mercy on them take thou no usury or interest of them or increase but fear thy God that thy brother may live with thee all right so see we must show the love they must they had to show the love of God this person's in a difficult time show them God's love fear God be more be more cautious of how God is going to react to how you treat someone that's poor Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy victuals for increase so if he's wax and poor don't charge him uh interest I am the Lord your God which brought you for see here's why because I brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God and If thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxing poor and be sold unto thee Thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant so see you don't treat him like one of those Heathen servants you treat him like a brother but as a hired servant and as a Sojourner he shall be with thee and Shall Serve thee unto the Year of Jubilee of course unto the next seven year period right whichever or whatever the contract was the contract may be to the next Jubilee the contract may be a seven year contract so it all depends Church what your contract is you could sign up well I'm going to serve you to the next Jubilee that may be 25 years maybe 35 years or you can do a seven year contract with a hired servant everybody can everybody say Amen it all depends on your contractual terms okay verse 41 we're getting there and then he shall depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return on his own possession or a family member in the Year of Jubilee that's that's that's Jubilee and unto the possession of his father shall he return for they are my servants which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt they shall not be sold as Bond men so see Jews are treated different than anyone else Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor that's the word but shall fear thy God so no severity don't be severe now you could be a little more harsh with non-jews we'll show that later but with your own people do not be severe unto them be merciful unto them and that's what I was thinking about yesterday you know the Bible said do good unto all men especially those of the household of faith so we need to be good to everybody but be especially good to Christians that's why I went and visited Austin yesterday on his birthday I don't know if I shared that with you but we went surprised him we sang Happy birthday to him right in front of everybody well I really felt ashamed of my singing it wasn't very good but you know I was like well I love Austin I don't care what these people think praise God I was thinking of that we need to be especially good to those of the household of faith and I didn't plan that that was all led to the Lord that was when I woke up on Saturday I'm like oh I know what I'm gonna do today it just kind of worked out that way I'd like to come to all your jobs and sing to you in other words but I'm not sure if I can quite do that so he's lucky well I should say lucky but that was ordained to God then I'd like you to come to my school and sing to me too [Laughter] no we're all family praise God the idea is be especially good to Christians right especially to the household of faith be good to your brother and sister praise God I know that's what I've always tried to do be better to our church than I am just the people outside of our church always try to be very good to the people of God see don't don't have rigor don't be severe but rule them in the fear of God verse 44 both thy Bond men and thy Bond Maids which Thou shalt have shall be of the Heathen that around about you of them shall ye by Bond men and by made so see he then servants are treated way different than Jewish moreover of the children of the strangers that those that do sojourn among you of them that ye shall buy and of their families that are with you which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession he shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bond men forever so see but over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule over one another with rigor so see if you bought an Egyptian slave they were yours and your families forever because thinking a lot of those a lot of those cases though they were refugees right they're just trying to live and so many of them would be happy just to have a job as a slave now of course I want to be modern it's not American slavery so don't don't ever put that American slavery and that was never God's system right that was a man-made Wicked sinful system but see these refugees they would they would gladly sell themselves in the service right because they would it would help them to live and help them to have a life and then they could have children they could have a wife and they could have children of course they'd always be uh the Servants of the Jews though they'd be that family's servants forever but at least they're alive at least they're not starving and dead somewhere right at least they're not being oppressed look how good God has these these Jews I'm sorry look how good God has the Jews treat their foreign slaves they get the fill of food they get the clothes they get children they get houses they get all these things praise God because remember once you were a slave amen once you were in bondage fear the lord thy God see it's quite a Godly system it's quite a wonderful Godly system verse 47 and if a Sojourner or stranger wax Rich by thee look they could even get rich Because of You blessing them I don't know how that worked I don't know if you'd give them some land I'm not sure how that would work but they'd have they'd have a need of something right they have they're starting to have a children if a Sojourner gets Rich by you and thy brother that dwelleth by him whacks poor and sell himself Under The Stranger or the Sojourner by the or to the stock of the strangers family now look at that your Jewish brother could go in uh service to this uh foreign a bond servant of yours that got rich somehow is that isn't that an interesting it's just amazing system look at that I mean what a land of opportunity brother William an Egyptian slave could get rich from the Jewish people and then he could he could hire Jewish servants too wow God is rich in mercy bye verse 48 after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brother may redeem him either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is not nigh of kin unto his unto him of his family may redeem or if he be able he may redeem himself see you work hard enough save up enough money he could redeem yourself and he shall reckon with him that bought him for from the year that he was sold unto him unto the Year of Jubilee and the price of his sail shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of and hired servant shall it be with him if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall give again the price of his Redemption out of the money that he was bought for and if there remain but few years in the Year of Jubilee then he shall count unto him and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his Redemption and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and so see yearly so it looks like they hired by years got to work a whole year for me right like that's you know when I became a teacher that's what before I was uh before I had tenure I was hired on a year basis so you might sign your contract you sign up for a year brother did you sign it just indefinitely not quite sure yet so yeah it's different at every place you know so I had to sign three one-year contracts after three years I got tenured in so I proved myself as a worker I got evaluated and now I'm just a perpetual worker there I don't have to sign a contract every year they just know I'm going to work there every year well in Israel it was a yearly contract verse 53. and let's finish 53 second part and the other shall not rule with Vigor over him in thy sight and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of the Jubilee both he and his children with him okay so there's that Jewish man that Jewish man could be redeemed right and he and his children could go out verse 55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants they they are my servants whom I brought forth on land of Egypt I am the Lord your God hallelujah everybody said amen so see we're getting some good uh understanding here I'm gonna get a good understanding so far amen I was really blessed to see this as I've been studying this so let's look at a few two points here Heathen servants could not be purchased I'm sorry Heathen servants could be purchased and some corporal punishment was permitted okay um and we'll get to that a little bit here second the Jewish system which was voluntary they were indentured servants it promoted poor Jews a chance to recover their livelihoods independence and possessions remember we already read it out of Exodus 21 it was a six or seven year term they were set free sometime in the seventh year right if it was the contract was seven years okay so that's a good a good review there by God's grace amen now we're going to Exodus 21. now that's a that's a that's a real striking chapter right there so that's where there's only one real there's only one and Austin and I were talking about this there's only one real verse in the Bible that's kind of hard to understand so we have to look at all the context of all the other things we've already read and we got to try to understand that based upon the context so the wording is just a little challenging just like in the New Testament all right sometimes things the wording is challenging like with Paul on the road to Damascus who actually heard the voice of the Lord who actually saw the light the wording is really challenging right we're not exactly sure and so we just say well God's word is right God's probably hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent right giving these uh Sinners an excuse to say well the Bible has mistakes and yet the Bible has so much truth in it all truth in it God's probably hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent now here's where we get a little bit uh there's more a little more uh serious here corporal punishment was commonplace for thousands of years it still is in some countries like Singapore I'll never forget when I was in high school we used to have this TV and we watched this news program every day and there was this American Teenager vacationing in Singapore and he did some graffiti and they whipped him with a a cane was it like 20 times and it was like worldwide news and it really it was like you you know like like why is the world become so like why are we so sisified you know it used to be commonplace to have now does anybody want to get beat with a rod no but you should know when you go into a country you got to keep their laws it was a rebellious American teenage that's a problem his parents are probably Rebels to begin with right but not maybe maybe not but maybe and so it's a big deal I can still see his picture I can't remember his name it was a big deal should there be Corporation punishment well I wonder if he ever did that graffiti ever again what do you think probably not because he probably didn't want to be whipped again right like I told you I was whipped one time with a belt for putting my dirty hands on the wall running and laughing in the house I never put my dirty hands on the wall again after that whipping because I learned what's called a lesson I learn respect I learned obedience through the pain that I suffered in the natural that's why our children sometimes need gentle spankings I'll say because the world wants to make it abuse every time they want to make it and some parents have because they're not born again or they lose control and all they got to do is say sorry but a real Holy Ghost feel Christian though they'll administer that that corporal punishment with the love of God behind it not with an angry bitter or I wish you were never my child I can't believe and you're just going to be a failure no you're doing it with love because you know they're going to grow up you know you had to be punished you you know you learn lessons and you know they'll learn their lesson and they'll grow up to be a real servant of God because this is God's Heritage not yours you didn't create this child Although our mothers knit him in the womb the Bible said God need him in the womb praise God Hallelujah these are God's Heritage and so we treat him with Godly respect and the fear of the Lord so it's it's clear from the scripture Jews would use rods to correct their own children right so Jewish families would would punish their Jewish children with a rod that was common rod right even adult Jews could be punished with rods if the judges approved of it which reminds us of Singapore which if you go to Singapore from what I've heard it's the cleanest country in the world because they punish with rods and nobody wants to get beat on the back with rods right sees how to see how there's some wisdom in this let's go to Deuteronomy 25. did we redether I don't think so we read apportionately of course remember Church these people are not born again right when you're born again is different you know you can you can uh you're more mature you have the anointings you have Temperance you have all these things you have brotherly kindness but these people were not born again they cannot have the Holy Ghost and their soul and so God allowed some corporal punishment 25 one to three if there be a controversy between men and they come unto judgment that the judges May judge them then shall they justify the righteous and condemn the wicked and it shall be if the Wicked Man be worthy to be beaten that the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before his face according to his fault by a certain number remember it was never over 39 because they thought 40 would kill a man for 40 Stripes he may give him and not exceed less if he should exceed and beat him above these with many stripes and thy brother should seem vile unto thee wow so 40 they thought 40 was enough so the Jews would just take one away from that and make it 39. okay so these are adults grown adults without the baptism the Holy Ghost need some physical spankings and look what it can produce a good I mean produce some peace it can produce some obedience in some way in the natural we can see that today even today so here's an example um adult Jews and foreign servants guilty of fornication could be punished he with a sacrifice and she with the rod so if I'm a unmarried man saw an Egyptian slave and he and he and she agreed to have relations the Bible said whoever lied calmly with a woman that it's a Bond woman betrayal to a husband oh yeah and she was already engaged and not at all redeemed she wasn't redeemed yet she was still a foreigner nor Freedom given her she shall be scared so she would get whipped again because she's not a Jew they shall not be put to death because she was not free now you will see later free Jews if they did that could be put to death if he raped if a Jew if a man raped a Jewish woman because he was free and he raped her he could be put to death and she as long as she cried out she didn't have any punishment if she didn't cry out they both were stoned and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord unto the door of the Tabernacle the congregation even a RAM for a trespass offering and the priest should make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord is sit before the Lord for his sin which he had done and the sin which he had done shall be forgiven him so God would forgive fornication of a Jewish man with a heathen servant girl okay now notice also a Jewish man was obligated to marry Jewish woman he would entice to lie with him in other words there was never any sex before marriage was ever allowed it wasn't allowed in the days of Moses okay because let's read Exodus 22. if a man in Tyson made that is not betrothed then lie with her he shall surely endow her to be his wife so he had to take her as his wife if her father utterly refused to give her unto him he shall pay money according to the Dowry of burdens so he still had to pay the full price to buy her as a wife but she would not be his wife so either he had to take her or pay the full price of a wife which was very expensive okay so see God never allowed sex before marriage it was always punishable with something now it was death to lie about purity before marriage and death for rape so let's read that Deuteronomy 22. remember all these laws got to be kept into account that's why when someone says oh Jewish men could sell their daughters into sex slaves that's it goes against all these promise all these other verses only someone who's ignorant of the word of God would make such a slanderous accusation against God Deuteronomy 22 20. but if this thing be true and the tokens of The Virginity be not found for the damsel then shall they bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house and the men of this the city shall Stone her with stones that she died because she hath wrought Folly in Israel to play the in her father's house so she wasn't true about whether she was a virgin or not so shall thou put evil away from among you again God does not permit fornication right if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband that's adultery then they shall both of them die so think of all the deaths that would be in America today because of adultery both the man that lay with the woman and and the woman so shall thou put away evil from Israel look at that death for adultery death so see that's why people say oh Jewish the Jewish men could just rape their servant women absolutely not they couldn't even do it they of course they wouldn't even do it to a Jewish woman they'd die so of course they couldn't take one of their slaves and just sleep with the slave it was death verse 23 if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto a husband and a man finder in the city and lie with her then he shall bring them both out unto the Gate of the city and ye shall Stone them with stones that they shall die see because she was already betrothed to another man right she was already engaged this is why engagements are really serious Now in America they're not but they are with Christians the dams are because she cried not being in the cities that means she uh wasn't against that she was uh partaking in it being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife so Thou shalt put away evil from among you but if a man find a betrayal of dams on a field and the man forced her and lie with her then that man only that lay with her shall die see and the church said see anyone any rapists would be instantly dead you don't get a second chance in Moses day you rape you die you adulterate you die see that so God's laws for servants had to mash and line up with ease there's no contradictions in God's Bible and the church said but unto the damsel Thou shalt do nothing theirs in the damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his neighbor and saith him even so this is the matter see that's that's what a rapist is it's the same as a murderer because you're you're destroying that person's Spirit right a broken Spirit who can bear verse 27 for he found her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none to save her I'm gonna do it on time okay I'm doing pretty good my gosh guys I'm almost a little over an hour now uh verse 28 if a man find a damsel that is a virgin which is not betrothed and lay a hold of her and lie with her and they be found then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsels father 50 shekels of silver and she shall be his wife so see any fornication instant marriage instant marriage because he hath humbled her he may not put away all of his days in other words he had to live with his decision the rest of his life it's not like today where you can have fornication adultery there's no consequence now there will be consequences at the white Throne judgment or and in this life too sometimes not all the time but instantly there were consequences you did the wrong decision you pay the price verse 30. a man should not take his father's wife nor discover his father's skirt so there's incest of course and that was by death as well there's other scriptures where incense in incest was was death was a death punishment as well or is that helpful by God's grace all right now corporal punishment was again commonplace for thousands of years Paul was scourged five times beaten with ruts that was according to the law remember in the 1600s you could be hanging for cross-dressing I put that in my book you could be hanged that's why nobody cross-dressed right but eventually it was just prison 200 years later you just go to prison if you put on a woman's garment if you're a man or a woman if you put on a man's garment you just go to prison you wouldn't you wouldn't be killed so see how it became less and less and less slowly over the years but just 400 years ago you would die in England if you cross-dressed and that's why brother Brown would make that statement about cutting your hair because that's what God thinks of it it's such a disgrace for a woman to cut her hair it's such a disgrace for a man to grow up dreadlocks and the church said it's a disgrace you're dishonoring your head which ultimately turns out to be Christ and above Christ is the invisible God it's a form of disrespect your outward appearance it either disrespects or it respects God thank God we're all honoring God here today praise God with your outward appearance because God has done inward work inside your heart now just so you know the word slavery is only twice in the King James version it's only twice it's in Jeremiah 2 and then Revelation 18 13. so see slavery wasn't a common word used in the King James days the 1600s for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water is Israel's servant is he a home-born slave why is he spoiled okay so in other words Israel should not be slaves they should be free God said I called you out of Egypt to make you free praise God why would you be enslaved to idolatry now Revelation 18 knows about the Judgment of the mother Harlot we believe his future brother Adam said thus saith the Lord he said it'll be the wrong it'll be the Russian government that will bomb the Vatican and be destroyed in one hour standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city of Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come that's the one hour is the Russian bombs We Believe and cinnamon and odors and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and Terrace and slaves and Souls of men so the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of slavery now now you can let your imagine go and your imagination go I don't know how to define that but the Bible says they have slaves at the end time now what about uh what about the children the sex trafficking that's the word I'm looking for what about this sex trafficking who's in charge of that now we know the drug mafias but who's behind that the Bible said the Roman Catholic Church is behind that all right now one brother emailed me and he said he said is this verse about all those ships that are backed up in the in the ports you know how we've had that since covered what are those called again the cargo ships remember they're backed up in ports and so there's like a supply chain issue I said well brother that's a good thought it might be I said only time will tell so you have all these Goods backed up in the Harbors right so we'll see I don't know see I'm not a prophet so I I can't say for sure I haven't seen the vision right all right now I've already gone over that somehow the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of all murders somehow all the slain on the Earth so again pre-civil War slavery does not resemble the Jewish system of servanthood at all there's no hardly anything at all that resembles and I'm going to show you again that picture so if you don't like it you know I mean you can turn your eyes but again this this did not happen this kind of abuse did not happen in Jewish slavery as long as they were God-fearing people I don't know what could have happened but God did not call for this all right remember the proof was now here's a good one we haven't read yet you received the death penalty for kidnapping and selling or planning to sell person that's how that pre-civil war um pre-civil War slavery system got started they would go into countries and kidnap slaves and take them and sell them to other places well in God's eyes if you kidnap anybody or even make a plan to kidnap somebody you're dead you don't get a second chance if we went to somebody's house and they had plans well here I'm gonna tomorrow morning I'm gonna go and steal these children they would we'd Stone them right there just the plan about it right that's how much God valued people's freedom I say hallelujah we serve a loving God Church don't let these Liars you know deceive us or make us doubt anything God is a gracious and merciful and loving God he's the god of redeeming praise God he's the god of giving you back your inheritance Hallelujah he's the god of bringing the poor into into riches praise God he's the god of Mercy Hallelujah just never forget where you came from he says that's what he told Israel don't forget you used to be a Slave don't forget I brought you out of slavery so show Mercy to everyone hallelujah praise God I like you just my own personal testimony I like the fact I was raised poor so because I'm raised poor I know the value of money and so because I was raised poor and people gave money to my family when I was poor I gladly give it out to people that need money and I'm thankful I was raised into poverty because I know the suffering of it and so I can easily give and it's just it's a natural thing to do I want to give back because God has given so much to me praise God he that stealth the man sell the man or if he be found in his hand he shall surely be put to death so God never supported any slavery system like the pre a pre-american pre-civil war I'm sorry pre-civil War slavery system they would kidnap people proof number two Jewish servanthood was a voluntary system that some of these are review and it was agreed upon in order to get out of debt a member of the Bible says we should we read this we shall not use rigor God will not let you be harsh or cruel or severe with any of your servants you had to show respect unto them if a Jewish man killed a and here's the only there's the only scripture that's kind of hard to understand if a Jewish man killed a Jewish servant he owned he lost his own life because you killed your brother so there was there might have been corporal punishment for slaves right because they didn't have the Holy Ghost and you might have to kind of punish them in order to get them obey but if you killed one of your servants you died as well he that's mighteth the man so that he die he shall surely be put to death go down to verse 20. if a man Smite a servant or is made with a rod and he shall die under his hand he shall be surely punished now we already know up here if he kills that man he dies we already know that it's in the same chapter so he'll be punished now here's the only one I don't understand notwithstanding if we continue a day or two he shall not be punished for he is his money so it looks like if if a man beats a servant his servant dies he shall be put to death but if he beats his servant with corporal punishment and he continues a day or two there's no punishment because his money because it looks like he loses out on the service that that servant would give to him because he's sick those few days he misses out on the work he would have done out in the field that's what it looks like to me but see sinners like the like Austin's friend that we were talking to and may God give them repentance but they said this verse proves you you can kill a servant or you can if you kill a servant you die but if you if you just hurt them for a couple of days there's no punishment well the Bible doesn't say whether this person lives or dies it looks like they get revived right looks like they're only sick for a couple days or they're only in pain for a couple days okay but remember earlier in the chapter that's why context is always King you always have to understand read the whole Bible look at the whole context look at all the books of the Bible praise God hallelujah don't add and here in this case don't take away from the word of God that's what these Sinners do they take away from the word of God they take away this but the Bible already says if you kill a man you lose your life too all right so this one just a little bit difficult to understand but if you look at the context you kill someone you get killed you kill your servant you're going to be punished likely with death right but if you beat somebody punish one and they they're sick for one or two days you that person represents your money that person represents uh your help and you lose out on that help uh we already went over this but you could not charge Jews interest I'm not going to go over that because we already did that one here's what I'll yeah here's what I like if you seriously hurt a servant he or she went free so you had to be careful how you treated them and look all the debts were clear let's say this person owed you ten thousand dollars you're gonna work for 10 years or whatever if you mistreat them you lose out on your ten thousand dollars sorry your fault can you imagine that if a man Smite the eye of his servant see if you if you whip that person hit him in the eye or the eye was made that appears he shall let him go free for his eyes sake just one eye now that's a lot don't get wrong that's a lot but I'm just saying you lose out on all those years of service all that you lose on all of it because they lost something very valuable to them or if you smite his manservant's tooth and he loses tooth he gets to go for free for one two look at that one tooth if you hurt them permanently you lose out so what do you think have you lost a finger you'd probably go free right you lost the ear Go free God's not saying well just teeth are protected under the law or just eyes and teeth are protected no he's giving you he's giving this uh giving us as a as a as a principal if you take something permanently you lose out that's what I love about the word of God right there see people they won't they won't they won't tell you about this one let's just focus on these questionable verses uh and they won't tell you about this if you take their tooth you lose out on your whole debt that they owe you think about that somebody owe you 20 grand you accidentally knock their tooth out you don't get your 20 20 grand back all right better start working harder yeah you gotta live with it you're not gonna get that money back they might owe you but you're not getting it back because you took something permanent from them you hurt their body more than what you should have so did Jewish fathers sell their daughters into Savory here's the verse we read it if a man sells daughter to be a maidservant she shall not go out as the men's servants do if she please not her master who have betrothed her to himself so in this case he bought a a Jewish girl and he was going to marry her right then shall he let her be redeemed to sell her unto a strange Nation he shall have no power so he's got to keep that girl in the family in the Jewish community seeing that it's dealt deceitfully with her see he promised he's going to marry her but then he's like ah you don't please me he can't sell her to somebody else he's got to provide her food clothing everything unless somebody else marries her also here's a good point this was from a video I watched these Jewish contractual servants their sons and daughters would have likely lived among their own tribes or kindred okay so let's take it back to our day let's just use like the hmongs let's use a mom you know so like the Hmong would be like a Jewish Community right and so if they would ever uh hire out their sons or daughters that person would always stay in among culture so they'd always be treated like the hmong's freedom right or Americans if it was my I'm American you know so it'd always be they'd be treated like an American right they could not be sold to another group of people they were always living within their family see a daughter would be contracted to work maybe to pay off a father's debt let's say she's old enough she's 15 or whatever he could allow her to sign a contract he would sign the contract for her and she would go work seven years to help pay off the dad's debt but if she got married in that time she could get married right should get married now I like this here the Kinsmen Redeemer and we see this in the Book of Ruth he was a tribal overseer whose responsibility was to ensure laws were carried out for his people's protection and this is why Boaz became the Kinsmen Redeemer right because Naomi and Ruth were in her his family within his kin right and so they had to make sure everybody even these women with no husbands we have to make sure they're treated right we have to do justice to them and God brought such Justice praise God he brought Ruth into it a Sojourner amen God brought a Sojourner in and then he puts his sojour into this woman of Faith Ruth he puts her in the very lineage of his Messiah Jesus Christ Hallelujah Ah that's the grace of God bring that Stranger in and she's going to eventually out of her loins I've heard her husband's loins are going to come David and Solomon and then Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's how much God loves a stranger amen hallelujah but Boaz was the kinsman redeemer he had to go to the gate and talk to all the judges well this one man are you going to redeem uh Naomi if you do you got to buy Ruth too he said no I can't do it whatever reason he said well then this day you're all these all these other Kinsmen they're they're witnesses that I purchased Naomi that I can get Ruth is that right Church then he takes under her Ruth well this is what would happen see they would keep these uh these family members within the family so they were protected Hallelujah God is a god of protection Hallelujah and God can take a poor old woman like like Naomi praised God who had no more uh no more husband praise God and yet then her in her old age could could give suck to a baby praise God oh my it's a beautiful thing in other words God will restore all the years that the Palmer word hath eaten I'll restore saith the Lord amen I'm going to make this woman who had no children I'm going to give her a child Hallelujah and this old woman weaned the baby praise God because God's system allowed them to bring the families back together to give them restoration to bring to give them their inheritance back amen hallelujah and God set up Kinsmen to make sure these laws were followed because God cares about each and every one by God's grace Hallelujah see Boaz offered Roost purchase to her nearest Kinsmen but he refused Naomi and Russia I should have put that one in there as well because uh Ruth was not in Kinsman Naomi was the near was the Kinsmen but Boaz was the kinsman redeemer and he offered the purchase of Naomi but because he wouldn't do it Boaz could do it he got both back praise God and then Ruth married to a Jew she gets full Jewish rights even as a moabite amen now that she's married to a Jew she gets full Jewish rights praise God and through her comes the very Messiah Hallelujah beautiful beautiful all right let's close with this here I'm going to try to close here in the next five or ten minutes here so let me set my timer here for 10 minutes have you enjoyed this today bye guys Grace amen I'm glad you I thought I'd take a little you know different thought I hadn't taken this one that's a blessing to you now remember in the New Testament I preach this a little bit sparingly before Paul never tried to do away with the Roman slavery because he knew that wasn't his Commission that was Abraham Lincoln's commission for America right not Roman but if you've fast forward all those years 1500 years or 2000 years God ordained Abraham Lincoln and the leaders of that day to bring America out of the slavery system but remember onesimus was a servant in the Roman system Philemon was his owner onesimus ran away he was he was deserter he could have been killed because of that but he goes to Paul Paul gets him saved he gets he repents he gets baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and Paul sends his letter to Philemon sends it back and he said receive onesimus as my son in the Lord and Paul said whatever money you lost because of him put it on my account and I'll be happy to pay it Hallelujah your slave ran away and then if your slave ran away but it was a sinner now he comes back as a Christian you're supposed to completely forgive him according to Paul Hallelujah make him a brother in Christ and then any money you lost the prophet of God will pay you back for it and how did you do that by making tents going to work every day Hallelujah the prophet of God out there working hard every day making a living he's going to pay off all the money think of all the help you lose you know with one servant gone you lose all the help out in the field you lose all the help in your home but the prophet God said well now that he's a Christian receive him back not as a servant but as a son and I will pay the money you lost put it on my account and he said I Rejoice I know that you'll do it in verse 11. Hallelujah Paul's advice to servants in Ephesians 6 5. I'm going to read this one Hallelujah 6'5 servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling and singleness of your heart as unto Christ not with eye Services men Pleasers but as the Servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart with Good Will doing Service as to the Lord and not to men so Paul tells the servants you find yourself in a slavery type condition but see your work like you're working for God and not for this man verse 8 knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord so all your good seeds you sow you're going to reap someday whether he be Bond or free see so Paul says whatever situation you're in do what's right plant good seeds because one day Church you're going to get a harvest if you do what's right God will do you right Hallelujah verse 9 any Masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening says he don't threaten them don't be harsh with Don't Be Cruel or don't be rigorous with them see that's the same as the Old Testament knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him Hallelujah so each one of us no matter how much money or power or authority or influence that we have all of us have a master I'm sure you understand if you have a master that Master wants to give you instructions if you have a master then you are not doing what you want to do you're doing what your master told you to do so how important is it for each of us to understand what does our Master want us to do with our time money influence relationships what does our Master want us to do because all of us are Masters and God doesn't like one of us more than the other he has the same love to all of us God doesn't like brother Jesse well because he's pastor and he's got eight kids you know God God loves him more no no no no God loves all of us the same yeah I have different needs in you I may have but then you have some needs I don't have God does not favor us like well he's a he's a master he or this person has this they have more so I'm going to favor them more no God is looking at every one of us and he wants every one of us to do the very best we can with what he's given to us and he is the Lord of all he's the gracious judge over every single one of us and all of us should work Hallelujah whether you're at Gardner Pie Company praise God or whether you're at Copley Fair Lawn City Schools amen no matter where you are serve that boss like you're serving the lord Jesus Christ praise God Hallelujah no matter where you find yourself serve that person like you're serving Christ how would I serve Christ if I was in college or High School how would I do it how would I study for Christ if Christ was my teacher in the in the high school or Elementary each one of us need to have this mindset I am not the master there's a master over me hallelujah thank you Jesus there's no respect to persons with God all right First Corinthians 7 17. I'm at an hour and a half you've been good good listeners here by God's grace I'm almost done First Corinthians I don't know how long it's going to be First Corinthians 7 17. But as God hath distributed to every man as the Lord hath called everyone so let him walk and so I ordain in all churches in other words God calls you at a certain point of your life with a certain purpose in your life so now we understand onesmus was called a certain purpose to teach Philemon a lesson praise God he was called after he was an escaped slave to teach Philemon real forgiveness right God calls each one of us at a different location to help teach others around us the ways of God so give me an example brother Jesse Yeah okay let's keep reading that in verse 18. is any man called being circumcised so Jewish let him not become uncircumcised if any be called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised circumcision is nothing an uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of The Commandments of God so God may call some of us in like a Jewish system some may come of us as Gentile Paul says you don't have to worry about going to one side or the other let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called art thou called being a servant right now nessimist had escaped he wasn't called as a servant he was called after he became a an escaped slave I guess we call him he said care not for it wow don't care that you're a Slave in the Roman system Paul says if God calls you as a Christian as a slave don't don't worry about it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather if you get that opportunity now look Paul's not promising them Prosperity Gospel like they're going to be free he's saying if you get the opportunity make the most of it but don't forget make the most of it in whatever situation you're in oh you see God is your master and serve man like you'd serve God Hallelujah one day if you're like Joseph and you're faithful God will exalt you praise God one way or another praise God maybe not of course not to all those Heights we can't all be second in command we can't all be vice presidents in America right it's impossible but in other words God's going to exalt you to some position of more power more Authority more responsibility if we're faithful he said don't care for careful or not if the obvious made free use it rather verse 22 for he that is called in the Lord being a servant is the Lord's free man Hallelujah Paul says even if you're a slave and you're a Christian you're not a slave you're free praise God he's talking about spiritually in other words every in every condition we're in we can be spiritually free we don't have to be bounded it's all about our perspective it's all about our attitude we should look at it from an eternal perspective praise God I'm just on this Earth for a short time and I'm a free man I'm a free daughter of God and I'll serve God hallelujah no matter who's around me I'll serve God I'll give a testimony that God loves all of us and that whatever we do God will bless us for it and we must do all of our works for the glory of God almighty and if you serve God God will reward you if you serve God secretly God will reward you openly in public that's exactly right Hallelujah likewise finishing verse 22 likewise also he that is called being free is Christ's servant you are bought with the price be not ye the Servants of men uh Paul tells us who who bought us it wasn't some man or a woman that bought us you know it doesn't apply to us today it would apply to them they might have a master that bought them but Paul says you were bought with a greater price than that you were bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ so serve God that way and last verse verse 24 Brethren let every man wherein he is called therefore abide with god let's say to our feet praise God musicians can come I didn't get to finish all of it but that's most of it you guys saw on your heart brotherhoods okay praise God yeah I want to I mean some more verses about Freedom you know in the New Testament was that a help today by God's grace amen I thought you know a lot longer topic than I thought I thought well we don't have time really for that in a Sunday night service you know take a few weeks to cover that but a Sunday morning where I usually preach an hour and a half you know or I thought we could cover that by the grace of God how many love God today hasn't God been so good to you Church how many want to be the Lord's free free servant free free son free daughter how many want to work for a man like you're working for the Lord that's what I want my testimony to be praise God let's be good to all men but especially those of the household of faith praise God let's bow our heads for word of Prayer Heavenly Father we're thankful for the freedom that we have today Lord we are blessed in this country Lord just was as we saw with onesimus you called us as free men or women we're not slaves today we're grateful Lord for the contracts we can sign I'm grateful for my school contract Lord God I can provide for my family we're thankful Lord for the jobs you've given us Lord all these natural blessings and father may we do what Paul said dear Lord hallelujah may we know that God you're not a respecter of persons but you're looking at each and every person loving them the same giving them the same opportunities you're saying work for me today serve me today and I'll bless you never forget that you used to be a slave to sin but now you're the Lord's free man free woman and serve me and that you believe that I've given you Lord I'm thankful for the Jubilee trumpet I heard Lord when I was 19 years old 23 years ago Lord God coming up on that great anniversary Lord God
