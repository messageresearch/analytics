[0:00] on Wednesday I just felt led to kind of
[0:02] continue on this series here about the
[0:04] coming of the lord The Rapture
[0:22] mystery Hallelujah re I'm sorry Psalm 27
[0:26] 1-5 and I don't know if you've listened
[0:28] to this but um I was listening do it
[0:30] real slow yesterday and today U this is
[0:32] the text Brother BR uses but um as I'll
[0:36] be sharing maybe a little bit more here
[0:37] as we go on with the Rapture there are
[0:39] certain things that um we're not given
[0:42] thus sayith the Lord on you know we're
[0:43] not given thus sayith the Lord on Psalm
[0:45] 27 for the Rapture brother raham just
[0:47] uses it for the
[0:48] Rapture so it's kind of like you know
[0:50] the squeeze and all these things that
[0:51] some things we don't have thus sayith
[0:53] the Lord on but we're just look into the
[0:54] scripture for inspiration Hallelujah and
[0:57] if you look it up I I would encourage
[0:58] you to look it up after reads verses 1-5
[1:01] he doesn't read this text again the rest
[1:04] of the sermon so it's just look it up
[1:06] yeah look up trouble I looked up trouble
[1:08] I looked up hide me in the Pavilion it's
[1:10] only used one time that's the beginning
[1:12] of the service uh the lady was trying to
[1:14] push him out of there uh there I guess
[1:16] they were too long in that uh hotel room
[1:18] there but just very interesting and so
[1:21] it just requires us to have some
[1:23] maturity and for us to seek God as well
[1:26] uh to say Lord Inspire us with the
[1:28] verses we need to fulfill F before the
[1:30] Rapture Hallelujah so it gives us a
[1:32] little bit of a Duty uh to stay in the
[1:34] word of God to look to the word of God I
[1:36] find it very striking brother bam uses
[1:38] this verse uh uh for the Rapture I've
[1:42] never heard anybody else use this verse
[1:44] of course I just only listen to Somebody
[1:45] of God preachers before that but let's
[1:47] read this uh Psalm 27
[1:50] 1-5 I'll read 1-4 okay and then we can
[1:53] read uh five together Psalm 27 1-5
[2:02] Hallelujah verse one says a Psalm of
[2:05] David the Lord is my light and salvation
[2:07] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[2:10] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[2:12] afraid just pausing just a moment we can
[2:14] see how this would be a real
[2:15] encouragement for the Rapture right
[2:17] because we're we're told there might be
[2:18] a squeeze there might be some fearful
[2:20] things happen but if this is a Rapture
[2:22] scripture then we're told not to be
[2:24] afraid it's going to take the anointing
[2:26] of the holy spirit it's going to take we
[2:27] what we call rapturing Faith Hallelujah
[2:30] verse two when the wicked even my
[2:32] enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat
[2:34] up my flesh they stumbled and fell so on
[2:39] their way to attack David they stumbled
[2:41] and fell God wouldn't let them actually
[2:43] get to
[2:44] David verse three though in host should
[2:47] encamp against me my heart shall not
[2:49] fear though War should rise against me
[2:52] in this will I be confident talk about
[2:56] confidence a war Rising against someone
[2:59] and yet there confident verse four one
[3:02] thing have I desired of the Lord that I
[3:04] will seek after that I may dwell in the
[3:07] house of the Lord all the days of my
[3:09] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[3:12] and to inquire in his Temple let's read
[3:16] verse five together one 2 3 for in the
[3:19] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[3:22] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[3:26] shall he hide me he shall set my feet
[3:30] upon a rock let's have one more word of
[3:32] prayer if you have a need on your heart
[3:33] just make it known unto the Lord somehow
[3:35] let's pray father God we thank you for
[3:36] the reading of Thy word Lord your
[3:37] Prophet used this Lord almost 60 years
[3:40] ago Lord to teach the people about the
[3:42] Rapture and Lord the Holy Spirit told
[3:43] them to store up food Lord God we would
[3:45] need it later on so Lord we see how we
[3:47] need this today in a time when there's
[3:49] Wars rumors of wars Lord God and Lord
[3:52] enemies and and uh Christianity is being
[3:54] attacked and mocked and made fun of
[3:56] scoffed at all around Lord we need your
[3:58] Holy Spirit Lord that we would not fear
[4:00] we need your Holy Spirit Lord to hide us
[4:03] in a time of trouble if the trouble
[4:04] should come upon us Lord so father God
[4:06] that we see the inspiration Lord now of
[4:09] the Holy Spirit storing up these things
[4:11] for us Lord God and we're grateful for
[4:12] the word of God Lord God thank you for
[4:15] the songs the worship Lord the baby
[4:16] dedication bless van Andia and father
[4:19] God bless our uh final here two services
[4:21] with brother William Lord and father
[4:23] we'll give you all the praise honor and
[4:24] Glory anoint me anoint your people with
[4:26] the Holy Ghost In Jesus Christ's name
[4:29] and the Saints said
[4:30] amen God bless you as you're being
[4:31] seated praise
[4:36] God so this is part five for those
[4:38] people keeping track part five the
[4:40] coming of the Lord uh the map The
[4:42] Rapture of mystery rather so Wednesday
[4:45] we finished the 1957 sermon uh the
[4:47] sudden secet going away the Lord and we
[4:49] started then we looked at the six proofs
[4:51] the Rapture is
[4:52] pre-tribulation and then we began
[4:54] looking at the beginning of this sermon
[4:56] the Rapture from Yuma Arizona uh
[4:58] December 4th 19 65 and we got in to see
[5:01] how brother random talked about the
[5:03] message of the hour he said it was the
[5:06] scriptures that God is vindicating right
[5:09] now it was foretold in the Bible and
[5:11] just hits exactly each time because it's
[5:14] God saying that hallelujah amen
[5:18] hallelujah praise
[5:19] God all right then he said uh the uh B
[5:23] uh the Christian businessman's
[5:24] Fellowship was an oasis of Fellowship
[5:26] outside of denominational barriers I
[5:29] think find out that as well when we can
[5:31] fellowship with other churches isn't it
[5:33] so refreshing you know when we remember
[5:34] when we had the and you know they're and
[5:36] they're message leaders remember we had
[5:37] the Pennsylvania Saints the open door
[5:39] Tabernacle come to see us wasn't it so
[5:41] refreshing it was so refreshing they
[5:43] sent us a card I still left it up there
[5:44] on the on the bulletin board out there
[5:46] just it so refreshed their spirit and
[5:49] they listen to our sermons you know they
[5:50] I show Malachi they made a comment on
[5:52] our Wednesday night service they gave
[5:53] Malachi a nice compliment I said Malai
[5:55] got to keep humble though by God's
[5:56] grace uh it was Aaron's wife said oh no
[5:59] nobody plays like Malachi I said well I
[6:01] appreciate that I said but Malachi knows
[6:03] he's got to be humble
[6:05] Hallelujah CU we're all growing in the
[6:07] grace of God right buddy Hallelujah and
[6:10] brother R said how God is turning a
[6:12] corner right and with the the seven
[6:14] Church age messenger god was turning a
[6:16] corner into this last final Church age
[6:19] and we're hoping by God's grace we're at
[6:21] that we're at the very end of this
[6:22] corner where the corners are going to
[6:23] come together and the building of God is
[6:25] going to be finished and he can Rapture
[6:27] the bride out of here hallelujah so
[6:29] that's what we're looking for by the
[6:30] grace of God and brother Bram did not
[6:32] call these uh Presbyterians Baptists
[6:34] Pentecostal he did not call them Devils
[6:36] he called them fine Brethren Hallelujah
[6:39] so we want to make sure we no matter who
[6:40] we disagree with we want to call them
[6:42] fine Brethren of course unless God
[6:43] anoints us to say something like oh
[6:45] Child full of subtility thou child of
[6:47] Satan or something like that unless we
[6:49] get some type of powerful anointing like
[6:51] that let's be gracious let's be kind
[6:53] Hallelujah because we always want to
[6:55] remember where were we Hallelujah when
[6:56] we were before the message came to us
[6:58] where was I right amen and we always
[7:00] want to remember that by God's grace now
[7:02] right after brother reads this text I'll
[7:03] be getting into the sermon here we'll
[7:04] just hit the highlights kind of as we
[7:06] feel L of the Lord uh brother Ram said
[7:08] how many in here believes the Bible
[7:10] teaches there will be a Rapture of the
[7:12] church yes sir that's right exactly a
[7:15] catching away of the church whether
[7:16] you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[7:18] whoever you are Pentecostal there will
[7:21] be a catching
[7:22] away and he says I in speaking I just
[7:26] don't try to get up here to say
[7:28] something that I would think would
[7:30] please the people I've never been guilty
[7:33] of that so brother said it's basically a
[7:34] sin to for a preacher to stand up here
[7:36] and say how can I please the people
[7:39] brother man said that's a sin and that's
[7:42] how I I never want to approach it that
[7:43] way I want to clarify things and I want
[7:44] to preach things and answer questions
[7:46] but I'm not up here to please the people
[7:49] I'm here to please Jesus Christ amen
[7:51] butam said I want to get up here and say
[7:53] something as I feel led to say it that I
[7:55] think would be a help to you something
[7:58] that would further your EXP experience
[7:59] with God if you are a Christian he said
[8:02] but make you so ashamed of yourself uh
[8:06] I'm sorry s it says if you're not a
[8:07] Christian make you so ashamed of
[8:09] yourself that you will become a
[8:11] Christian so see there's shame right
[8:13] there there before you can have good
[8:14] news you got to have the bad news you
[8:16] have to know you're a sinner going to
[8:18] hell but God's grace will save you if
[8:20] you repent of your sins Hallelujah so
[8:23] brother R said I want to further your
[8:24] experience with God not to please you
[8:26] but to give you a better experience and
[8:28] then make so ashamed of themselves
[8:31] they'll become Christians brother said
[8:33] that's the purpose I've always tried to
[8:34] line up my thoughts as the Lord would
[8:36] lead me Hallelujah now brother B takes
[8:39] the next I'm going to look at this the
[8:40] next uh I'm looking at time here now
[8:43] okay so 14 uh to 32 okay so that would
[8:47] be 16 18 the next 18 minutes brother
[8:49] Adam spends talking about scoffers in
[8:51] the last days so if you have your Bible
[8:53] Casa uh pull up uh he reads 2 Peter
[8:57] 3: 3 and 4
[9:00] for so this is the first verse brother
[9:02] am reads right after reading his text he
[9:05] talks about scoffers and he spends quite
[9:07] a bit of time on this uh starting with
[9:09] scoffers remember he's in a mixed
[9:10] audience they're not all message
[9:12] Believers they're all Pentecostals
[9:14] though they all believe in Divine
[9:15] Healing they all believe in Jesus Christ
[9:16] as Messiah they're
[9:18] businessmen and uh it's a
[9:20] non-denominational
[9:22] Gathering he says now we're warned in in
[9:25] the doctrine of this in the last days
[9:28] will be scorned at the doctrine of the
[9:30] Rapture will be scorned at right just
[9:32] like we saw with you know John rich and
[9:34] Tucker Carlson I've had three or four
[9:36] people text me over these last few
[9:37] months or so just uh belittling me
[9:39] because I believe in the pre-tribulation
[9:41] Rapture they have nothing to stand on uh
[9:44] they all they can do is name call really
[9:46] but brother Braham said that has to be
[9:47] in the last days because it's prophesied
[9:50] knowing this that there shall come in
[9:51] the last days scoffers walking after
[9:54] their own
[9:56] lust so again that's something we got to
[9:58] keep in mind anyone that attacks the
[9:59] message we have to look at their lives
[10:01] and see are they living in sin or are
[10:03] they living in Holiness if they're
[10:06] living in sin in the lust of their flesh
[10:08] and pride of life lust of the eyes and
[10:10] lust of the flesh then they're a
[10:12] scoffer now but if they're sincerely
[10:14] trying to understand they'll have a
[10:16] humble Spirit about them right if you
[10:18] really want to know something and you're
[10:19] really a real Christian you'll have a
[10:21] humble Spirit not an angry attacking
[10:24] kind of spirit like these scoffers right
[10:26] like brother Rand he's going to give
[10:27] some examples here in a little bit
[10:30] but you'll notice one thing about them
[10:31] they're always walking after their lust
[10:34] that's why I told you know these groups
[10:35] that leave the message that I've got in
[10:36] contact with some of them won't even
[10:38] share some of the things they do uh they
[10:41] they won't tell you their ideas about
[10:42] hair they won't tell you their ideas
[10:44] about uh dresses and pans they won't
[10:46] they won't say it they'll just attack
[10:47] brother brandham because they know if
[10:49] they say they're lust we're going to
[10:51] call them out right and that will expose
[10:53] them when they start compromising on the
[10:55] word of God when they start adopting
[10:57] Abominations it EXP oses them as
[11:00] scoffers as Peter said which was really
[11:03] the Holy Ghost predicting it that's
[11:05] right that's right and saying where is
[11:08] the promise of his coming since the
[11:10] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[11:12] as they were from the beginning of the
[11:15] creation so they're saying where is the
[11:17] rapture where is Jesus where's his
[11:19] coming you've been saying this for so
[11:21] long everything's just been going the
[11:23] same way it's always been for this they
[11:26] are willingly ignorant of that by the
[11:28] word of God the heavens were of old and
[11:31] Earth standing out of the water and the
[11:34] and the water in the water now I'm
[11:35] quoting by yeah standing out of the
[11:37] water and in the water thank you whereby
[11:39] the world that was being overflow with
[11:42] water perish so Peter gets the same
[11:44] inspiration of just like uh just like
[11:46] Luke CAU Jesus inspiration as it was in
[11:49] the days of Noah so shall it be in the
[11:51] days of the coming of the son of man
[11:52] Peter gets the same Revelation just like
[11:54] they doubt the flood they'll doubt Jesus
[11:56] Second Coming hallelujah amen it's the
[11:58] same Spirit
[12:00] scoffers uh that want to live in
[12:02] sin now brother gets done there and he
[12:05] says now we see that the reason the
[12:07] subject is so lightened at or attacked
[12:10] is because the prophet here has said
[12:11] that in the last days these scoffers
[12:13] would come saying these things see it's
[12:16] predicted the reason the people are
[12:18] acting today the way they're acting why
[12:20] you certainly are expecting it because
[12:22] the Bible said that now Church you're
[12:25] the same as me when we see these uh uh
[12:27] liberals or radicals when we say these
[12:29] things or when we hear them say the
[12:31] things they say it shocks us but really
[12:33] if we actually think about it it's it's
[12:35] exactly what was prophesied to
[12:37] come lovers of Pleasures more than
[12:39] lovers of God a great Falling Away now
[12:42] but it's shocking in the in the purity
[12:44] of our hearts it's shocking to see it
[12:46] actually in front of us right to see the
[12:47] video or it's shocking but it's actually
[12:49] the scripture because God's word not one
[12:52] jot or title will pass away from this
[12:54] word hallelujah someone's got to fulfill
[12:56] the scoffers if this is like the days of
[12:58] Noah the days of lot if this is also uh
[13:01] like the days of Enoch and all these
[13:02] things we've got to have uh scoffers
[13:05] around that are mocking Christ mocking
[13:08] Christianity and they are and they're
[13:11] fulfilling the scripture brother now
[13:13] quote second Timothy 3 in the last days
[13:15] they'll be heady high-m minded lovers of
[13:16] Pleasures more than lovers of God truth
[13:19] Breakers promise Breakers false accusers
[13:22] incontinent remember that's a lacking
[13:24] self-control especially sexually and of
[13:26] course with alcohol incontinent Des
[13:29] desis of those that are good having a
[13:31] form of godliness and denying the power
[13:33] thereof from such turn away Hallelujah
[13:36] brother Bram said can we look for an
[13:38] impersonation of Truth
[13:41] certainly now brother is going to give
[13:43] some examples of scoffers in the last
[13:45] day and I got two for you I kind of
[13:47] mentioned one on Wednesday night to the
[13:49] supreme court of justice but I got two
[13:50] for you here tonight I think you like
[13:52] these here brother man breaks into he
[13:54] said there were scoffers in Moses's day
[13:57] he said and then there was also
[13:59] impersonators Janice and
[14:02] jambre Hallelujah and that's what Paul
[14:05] said would be like the end times right
[14:07] as right there in second Timothy chapter
[14:08] 3 he said this has to happen because
[14:11] Satan is the God of this world the Bible
[14:14] calls him the God of this world I think
[14:15] it's 2 Corinthians 4:4 honey do you want
[14:16] to pull that up there uh the God of this
[14:19] the God of this world that doesn't mean
[14:23] uh he's to be worshiped or or that
[14:26] doesn't mean like he's greater than God
[14:28] it just means god gave him Dominion
[14:29] because he defeated he overcame Adam and
[14:32] Eve is that it second Corinthians
[14:35] 4:4 yes God of this world thank you Lord
[14:37] I had forgotten that one um in whom the
[14:41] God of this world hath blinded the minds
[14:42] of them which believe not lest the light
[14:45] of the Glorious gospel of Christ who the
[14:47] image of God should shine unto them you
[14:49] know I've heard people say uh if there's
[14:51] a God why would he make a place like
[14:52] this well God didn't make this place
[14:54] Satan made all this sin when God made it
[14:57] God made it good Hallelujah
[15:00] and then the creatures the the two in
[15:01] the image that that God made to have
[15:04] dominion over it they fell to
[15:07] Satan so God did not do all this sin
[15:10] sin's a perversion sin's not a creation
[15:12] sin's a perversion Hallelujah and Satan
[15:15] of course deceived Eve uh Adam has some
[15:17] guilt in there it's quite quite a
[15:19] mystery right that whole scripture there
[15:21] that whole set of verses why would a man
[15:23] leave his wife there uh if he's there
[15:25] why would he just stand there not say
[15:26] anything uh if if that's the case but if
[15:28] it's other case why would she be
[15:30] wandering away from him now that
[15:32] remember that uh drama we watch said
[15:34] they were played in hide and- seek and
[15:35] remember that Adam eve were playing
[15:37] hideand-seek and then she hid so good
[15:38] that Adam can't couldn't find her now
[15:41] that that's kind of a childish idea
[15:43] but uh it just you know it's hard to
[15:46] understand you know how could where was
[15:48] Adam you know where we we don't know but
[15:52] there's scoffers and Satan's the God of
[15:54] this world so Satan is also the prince
[15:56] and power of the air right and
[15:59] especially in this day the air waves
[16:00] right the radio waves and the internet
[16:02] waves Satan controls most of what comes
[16:05] out of there Hallelujah the God of this
[16:08] world and then brother man breaks into a
[16:10] second example after Moses's day and
[16:12] Janice and jamrose he breaks into a man
[16:14] from England he said scoffers I was
[16:17] reading a paper two weeks ago in Tucson
[16:19] there was some English man from England
[16:21] made a statement it's the headlines in
[16:24] the paper that the crucifixion of the
[16:26] Lord Jesus was only fake
[16:30] between pilate and Jesus so this brother
[16:33] said this was in the paper just to make
[16:35] himself something so Jesus just put a he
[16:38] he did a fake crucifixion to make
[16:39] himself look like he raised from the
[16:41] dead brother R said this was in the two-
[16:42] sound paper now look what brother R says
[16:45] there's no way that we could disprove
[16:48] that to
[16:50] them you and I we have no proof I like I
[16:53] like how brother says that in other
[16:55] words we can't make somebody believe we
[16:57] can present the evidence listen we can
[16:59] present the evidence and all the all the
[17:01] facts and all the number of Scrolls that
[17:02] we have far out number any secular
[17:04] Scrolls all these uh Scrolls of the
[17:06] Bible but it takes that person that
[17:09] scoffer it takes them coming under
[17:11] conviction of the Holy Ghost recognizing
[17:13] the truth repenting of their unbelief
[17:15] and believing the truth it takes that it
[17:17] takes their individual free moreal
[17:19] agency to be
[17:20] saved you and I can't save anybody
[17:23] praise God right well that takes us back
[17:26] to hadie Wright how did she do that it
[17:28] must have been it was the boy's will to
[17:31] be saved right cuz hatri can't force
[17:33] anybody to be saved brother man said I
[17:35] can't heal anybody you and I we can't
[17:37] save anybody any preacher preaching
[17:40] salvation by Christ is not a divine
[17:42] Savior and the church said so when hadri
[17:46] spoke to the boys there spoke about that
[17:48] that was God's perfect timing for them
[17:49] to repent Hallelujah God knew they
[17:51] wanted and look they were even
[17:52] snickering at it a few seconds there but
[17:55] then the power of the Holy Spirit fell
[17:57] and said give her whatever she wants
[17:58] Hallelujah that's right and she wanted
[18:00] the salvation of the souls and so in the
[18:02] moment the Holy Spirit convicted them
[18:04] and they the brother said they threw
[18:06] themselves down at her feet and were
[18:07] crying and wept their way to Calvary
[18:10] amen see but with these scoffers we
[18:13] can't make them believe I I was
[18:15] discouraged a few years ago I thought
[18:17] why can't I get more of these people
[18:18] that leave the message to come back and
[18:20] well now I know it's because I can't do
[18:24] it I I thought my brother William if I
[18:26] can prove this if I can show them all
[18:28] the water B isms the Lord Jesus if I can
[18:30] show them all these six thus say the
[18:31] Lord that come to pass surely they'll
[18:33] believe it and the people say oh that's
[18:35] not good enough that doesn't convince me
[18:38] what you you told something in the name
[18:40] of the Lord and it came to pass and
[18:42] that's not good enough for you see it
[18:45] shows they love the things of the world
[18:46] but they're under the anointing of
[18:48] scoffing thank God we're under the
[18:50] anointing of the spirit of truth
[18:51] hallelujah that we can see it
[18:54] Hallelujah they can't see it but we can
[18:56] see it Hallelujah brother say there's no
[18:58] no way we could disprove that that Jesus
[19:01] faked his crucifixion to them because
[19:04] all the things of God is to Beed by
[19:08] faith we must believe it that's why
[19:12] church we have to remember you know we
[19:13] get into the deep things of the message
[19:14] we have to remember now every now and
[19:16] then to say I believe Jesus died and
[19:17] rose again I believe in the resurrection
[19:20] we got to get back to the Simplicity
[19:21] sometimes of the Gospel right just
[19:24] stating that with our words with our
[19:25] desires with our faith Hallelujah I
[19:28] believe Jesus died and rose again
[19:30] Hallelujah I believe he's alive forever
[19:32] more Hallelujah I believe all power in
[19:35] Heaven and Earth is given unto Jesus
[19:37] Christ
[19:39] Hallelujah because it's what we we must
[19:41] believe it the individual must believe
[19:44] it
[19:46] Hallelujah and then brother BR breaks at
[19:48] the 19-minute Mark and I try to give
[19:50] these minute Marks here he broke into
[19:52] this thought of how we need a message
[19:54] for every time period he said our last
[19:56] great Reformation was Pentecost 1906
[19:59] he said but it's he gives us thought
[20:01] numerous time during this sermon he said
[20:03] the the the revivals is word on top a
[20:07] word he said Luther had a word
[20:09] justification he said but Wesley brought
[20:12] another word that's right we don't get
[20:14] rid of Luther we keep Luther's word if
[20:17] it's in the Bible right all he had a lot
[20:19] of things outside the Bible he wasn't
[20:20] perfect like brother BR wasn't perfect
[20:22] he said some things outside the Bible
[20:23] but what he taught from the word of God
[20:25] was the truth and he said God takes that
[20:27] word the J live by faith Builds on that
[20:30] sanctification and then he builds on
[20:32] that the nine gifts of the holy spirit
[20:35] brother said but see now God's doing
[20:37] something else he said then he begins
[20:39] talking about the Seven
[20:40] Seals but brother said it's all the word
[20:43] it's God building he said it's like the
[20:46] life in the stock of wheat I think my
[20:48] children saw the Harvest out in the
[20:49] field this week didn't they I said I
[20:51] think I looked out there and I saw I
[20:53] said it's Harvest Time one of these
[20:55] years right I hope it's 2024 I hope the
[20:58] Rapture is this year it might be next
[20:59] year we don't know but it's always a
[21:01] good reminder there's a season for the
[21:03] Rapture
[21:04] Hallelujah brother say it's like that
[21:07] it's like the the the life in the stalk
[21:09] of wheat he said Luther was like the the
[21:11] Chute and then the stalk uh Wesley uh
[21:14] and then the chaff he says like
[21:15] Pentecost but the wheat now the life is
[21:18] in the wheat seed and brother said
[21:20] that's his ministry the life is in
[21:22] maturity it's back in the wheat because
[21:24] we are the seed of God hallelujah and
[21:27] brother said that he said you can't beat
[21:30] nature Hallelujah if Luther had to
[21:32] restore with the beginning Foundation
[21:35] that it's just like that wheat seed the
[21:37] church has to be built up the church has
[21:39] got to grow amen amen the church has got
[21:41] to keep receiving more life and come to
[21:44] a maturity to where we bring the
[21:46] Original Seed glory to God the original
[21:49] seed that fell down in other words the
[21:51] day of Pentecost the power of Pentecost
[21:53] we've got to bring that back to the
[21:54] church hallelujah amen I believe we had
[21:57] we've seen brother like said we've seen
[21:59] portions of it he said but we want to
[22:01] see more of it remember perfect Faith
[22:04] remember perfect faith I preach that now
[22:05] it's about been about a year brother B
[22:07] said we've seen Apostolic times he said
[22:10] but we want to see more of it what is it
[22:11] going to take he said a real shaving
[22:13] down for us see that's why we got to
[22:15] keep coming back to church get shaved
[22:17] down right let the shepherd Holy Spirit
[22:19] shave off all your wool shave you down
[22:22] make you make you lighter right make you
[22:24] free in the Lord hallelujah he said just
[22:27] like the life in the stalk
[22:29] and then brother BR talked about a a
[22:31] scoffer that scoffed at
[22:33] him brother Braham said there was a
[22:35] scoffer also who wrote about him in one
[22:37] of his books and he said if there ever
[22:39] was a fanatic it's William brandham he
[22:42] said a magician he said he said William
[22:45] brandham was a magician and he said uh
[22:48] he said oh and then he said in this book
[22:49] he said he was an atheist he said
[22:52] brother R preaches about a God he said a
[22:54] God who sat back and put his hands on
[22:56] his tummy uh during the Dark Age and
[22:58] watch as God let all these women and
[23:01] children die and be killed
[23:03] martyred this is what the atheist
[23:07] wrote he writes a brother man believes
[23:09] in that kind of God who would would
[23:11] would hold his tummy and laugh at all
[23:13] the martyrs dying and brother said that
[23:15] man is so
[23:17] blind he said God wasn't watching it
[23:20] laughing like that he said it's God
[23:23] letting the seed go down into the ground
[23:25] Hallelujah a seed must be planted in
[23:28] corruption and then it raises in
[23:31] incorruption
[23:32] hallelujah hallelujah there's people
[23:35] that they have to know Jesus in the
[23:38] power Sor the power of His manifestation
[23:40] power of his resurrection and the and
[23:41] the fellowship of his sufferings
[23:43] Hallelujah and that lines up with the
[23:45] Seven Seals the ax anointing that's
[23:48] right there's a generations and and
[23:50] hundreds of years that had to know
[23:52] Christ as with that ax anointing give
[23:55] their life as a sacrifice as Christ
[23:58] Christ gave his life Hallelujah but then
[24:00] there was a man age Hallelujah and then
[24:02] now Church we're in the Flying Eagle age
[24:05] Hallelujah Eagle represents God or a
[24:07] prophet where the carcass is the Eagles
[24:09] to be gathered represents the birds that
[24:11] fly above worldly things Hallelujah and
[24:14] they only come down to Feast on the word
[24:15] of God and then they fly back up to
[24:17] safety hallelujah amen we saw two eagles
[24:20] flying over our house was it this week
[24:21] or last week I got video of it there's a
[24:23] male and female Christ in the church
[24:26] they're doing some Maiden thing or
[24:27] something like that
[24:29] yeah they weren't fighting right they
[24:30] weren't fighting they were doing some
[24:31] type of a mating thing there so I
[24:33] thought that's really good I don't know
[24:35] if I've ever seen that flying over my
[24:36] own house Hallelujah so I thank the Lord
[24:38] for that now I'm not trying to be super
[24:39] spiritual I'm just thankful you know
[24:41] because I've seen uh Eagles driving to
[24:44] cam church right out in the field that
[24:46] doesn't mean NE necessarily anything
[24:48] it's just a good omen Hallelujah it just
[24:50] makes you feel good it reminds you of
[24:52] God's grace and mercy amen
[24:55] hallelujah brother said see this man
[24:57] does it understand the martyrs the corn
[25:00] of wheat he said has to fall on the
[25:03] ground but it'll be raised again
[25:06] Hallelujah then brother man he says now
[25:08] he talks about more scoffers he said
[25:10] over in England the teenagers are on the
[25:12] TV at churches saying calling Jesus
[25:15] Daddo but BR said what a shame daddo's
[25:19] like hey dude or bruh now's the one bruh
[25:21] I think there's probably a new one too
[25:24] but like they say Jesus is BR my BR I
[25:26] don't know don't don't don't take me
[25:29] literally but uh and then there's you
[25:32] know for Our Generation my wife and I uh
[25:34] we had friends that had a church said
[25:35] Jesus is my homeboy Jesus is not your
[25:38] homeboy he's your Holy Savior the Son of
[25:41] God the Lamb of
[25:42] God see brother man said they see they
[25:45] start scoffing by making Jesus less they
[25:48] lose their fear of the Lord amen they
[25:50] got a partial fear of the Lord K was
[25:52] reading this week and she said Daddy
[25:53] every time now I see the fear of the
[25:55] Lord she says I think is it partial or
[25:57] full I said that's a good thought you
[25:59] keep those good spiritual thoughts
[26:01] coming honey cuz we don't want a partial
[26:03] I mean if anyone's going to have a
[26:04] partial be someone like us that really
[26:06] have fear of God and Satan will try to
[26:08] discourage us or make us pull down our
[26:10] standards but we got to keep the
[26:12] standards High Hallelujah we got to
[26:14] remember to fear God hate evil depart
[26:17] from Evil that's the beginning of wisdom
[26:21] hallelujah hallelujah he said they're
[26:23] calling Jesus
[26:25] Daddyo or like Jesus my buddy today or
[26:28] Jesus is uh my bruh or something like
[26:30] that a
[26:33] homeboy this is the type of uh scoffing
[26:35] that's going on
[26:37] today you know you I've even seen it too
[26:39] you know some preachers even cussing
[26:41] from the pulpit
[26:42] now people not message people but just
[26:45] in you know General it gets too loose
[26:47] sometimes Church brother brother said it
[26:49] gets too loose he said you got to get
[26:50] out the belt and tighten up the belt
[26:52] Hallelujah if our standards get a little
[26:54] loose we got to tighten up and brother
[26:56] said get your gear all tightened up and
[26:57] get ready to fight a battle Hallelujah
[26:59] Satan's trying to make us feel uh less
[27:02] connected to God but he said you got to
[27:04] put on the full armor of God hallelujah
[27:07] remember the belt of Truth was the mind
[27:08] he said be sober in your minds Peter
[27:10] said putting on the belt of Truth so
[27:13] having our minds sharp we're not going
[27:15] to lose the fear of the Lord we're not
[27:17] going to uh kind of make Jesus less than
[27:20] what he is we're going to keep him high
[27:21] lifted up Hallelujah then brother BR
[27:25] said another United States preacher now
[27:27] look he's going through all these TA of
[27:29] scoffers he said this us preacher said
[27:32] the crucifixion was fake and Jesus had a
[27:35] man drank weed and he said kind of like
[27:37] a marijuana that's listen brother BR
[27:38] that's what he said it was kind of like
[27:39] marijuana and Jesus slept for two or
[27:41] three days but then he woke up and then
[27:43] he went up to uh India and married a
[27:45] wife and everything like that brother
[27:47] man said think of that making Jesus like
[27:50] he was trying to fake a religion but
[27:52] brother said the scoffers are fulfilling
[27:54] prophecy he said they're the men
[27:56] ordained to fulfill
[27:58] that word about
[28:00] scoffing
[28:02] Hallelujah he said in every age God
[28:05] ordained men like Moses he said the Son
[28:07] of God Jesus in every age he for
[28:10] ordained his men brother R said nothing
[28:13] is out of
[28:14] cater ah Church we're right where we
[28:17] need to be God the God's timing God's
[28:20] clock is working perfectly
[28:22] Hallelujah his eternal clock amen it's
[28:25] better than atomic clock amen I
[28:27] appreciate that clock sisters I think
[28:28] sister Z got his that clock that's a
[28:30] good
[28:30] clock but God's timing is eternal it's
[28:34] perfect brother said he won't come one
[28:35] minute late one minute early the Rapture
[28:37] will be right on time and we won't miss
[28:39] it Hallelujah why cuz we're making ready
[28:42] for it that's why we're here today to
[28:44] make ready for keep washing those dishes
[28:46] as Wednesday night's Story the armor
[28:49] company brother R said keep washing
[28:51] dishes he's coming back for you
[28:52] Hallelujah he promised you amen he
[28:55] promised in your word in the word and he
[28:57] promised in your heart amen that's right
[28:59] Hallelujah nothing's out of cater and
[29:01] now at the 23 minute Mark brother random
[29:04] begins doing
[29:05] apologetics that's defending the
[29:08] truth so brother gives a few scoffing
[29:11] stories but now he shows how they're
[29:13] wrong that's called apologetics your
[29:15] pastor does that sometimes all the time
[29:18] he said the first reason they're wrong
[29:20] that Jesus drank this mandri weed and
[29:22] and faked his death was because the
[29:24] Bible said he was offered the vinegar
[29:27] but he spit it
[29:30] out right so the preacher saying see you
[29:32] know when the when the when the soldier
[29:34] put that vinegar up to him that was
[29:35] actually Mand Drake weed he drank it in
[29:37] and then he fell asleep for three days
[29:39] he woke up he never really died he went
[29:41] off and married Mary Magdalene in India
[29:44] and brother said see Let me show the the
[29:46] silliness of
[29:48] that he said GE the Bible said Jesus
[29:51] refused
[29:52] it right he refused the vinegar so right
[29:56] there their argument their whole
[29:57] newspaper article fails right there you
[30:00] might as well burn that paper it's
[30:01] better for paper to be burned Hallelujah
[30:03] than to read nonsense like that then he
[30:06] reads a second one the second proof is
[30:09] that Jesus's life exactly fulfilled
[30:12] every Prophecy of the Old
[30:16] Testament he says uh for a man to
[30:18] predict something he said you have one
[30:19] out of a million chance he said but then
[30:21] tell where would happen you have a one
[30:23] out of 10 million chance and then he
[30:25] says uh all the details what happened
[30:26] now you're on a 100 million of getting
[30:28] it right and there's hundreds of
[30:30] prophecies Jesus fulfilled and Jesus met
[30:33] every single one of them written 4,000
[30:35] years before he was here even before
[30:37] crucifixion was invented David said I
[30:39] stare at my bones Hallelujah even before
[30:41] it was invented God allowed to be
[30:43] prophesied and brother said that's proof
[30:45] these people are scoffers but we believe
[30:47] Jesus is Alive
[30:50] amen and that's only two
[30:54] proofs and brother R said the third
[30:56] proof this is the third and final one he
[30:57] does
[30:59] he said if Jesus faked his death he said
[31:02] why would all those Apostles give their
[31:04] lives as Martyrs and die for a lie
[31:07] because they would have known it was
[31:10] fake you say well uh the Muslims uh will
[31:13] die for a lie yeah but they die in a
[31:15] different way they die with murder not
[31:17] with
[31:19] self-sacrifice the church said that's a
[31:21] huge difference people say well Muslims
[31:23] they must be sincere uh uh they do
[31:26] suicide bombings yeah they're sincerely
[31:27] possessed possessed with
[31:29] Devils because when all the apostles
[31:31] died they died as a sacrifice no one
[31:34] else died in fact uh some of the church
[31:36] age Messengers and polycarp of them uh
[31:38] polycarp yeah that's right when he come
[31:40] back from Rome they said polycarp if you
[31:42] don't turn yourself in we're going to
[31:43] kill this whole village of Christians
[31:45] polycarp 90 years old went there and
[31:48] gave his life and was burned at the
[31:50] stake in order to save others lives see
[31:53] those Muslim extremists they're trying
[31:55] to kill people with their deaths
[31:56] Christians are trying to save people
[31:58] with their death
[32:00] Hallelujah and that's the third proof
[32:02] brother said brother said no man will
[32:04] die for a
[32:05] faker die as a
[32:08] sacrifice right those Muslim extremists
[32:10] they're dying as murderers not like
[32:13] Christians Hallelujah everybody see that
[32:15] so three proofs he already uh refutes
[32:18] some of these arguments he's doing
[32:19] apologetics here I like that brother BR
[32:21] prove all things brother Ram said
[32:23] because the Bible says that and then he
[32:25] said oh yeah he does the fourth one yeah
[32:27] and then uh he he said uh Moses they say
[32:29] Moses didn't actually go through uh uh
[32:33] the Red Sea or whatever uh he said Moses
[32:35] just went through the the real shallow
[32:37] water where the Reeds were and brother
[32:39] bam said I I I I'll give you to know the
[32:42] Bible says the water stood up on
[32:45] themselves so see their claims don't
[32:47] match the
[32:48] scripture Hallelujah see the Bible
[32:51] they're putting something in the Bible
[32:52] oh the Bible never said they went
[32:54] through the reads see it's the devil
[32:56] bringing it's the devil bringing doubts
[32:58] upon the word of God but God's here to
[33:00] remind us go back to the word the word
[33:03] Can't Fail don't take one word away
[33:05] don't add one word the word is life
[33:08] Hallelujah brother gives four proofs
[33:10] that doesn't match with the rest of the
[33:12] infallible
[33:14] scripture hallelujah oh yeah brother R
[33:16] gives a fifth one well no this just an
[33:18] example of a scoffer
[33:19] sorry he said uh you saw it recently
[33:22] astronauts went up into space and they
[33:24] come back and they said I renounce my
[33:26] faith because when I went up in space I
[33:28] was expecting to see the Throne of God
[33:30] and I didn't see anything so there must
[33:31] be no
[33:32] God brother Braham said how sad they
[33:35] lost uh to he said to think that God
[33:38] would would have a home some somewhere
[33:39] up there like by the planets or
[33:41] something like that the Bible never said
[33:43] God would be up upon the planets right
[33:45] the Bible never said Heaven is outside
[33:47] of Earth's
[33:49] atmosphere so brother shows these
[33:51] scoffers like God would let it be seen
[33:53] up there he said the church has become a
[33:56] Ragweed Church
[33:58] too much education too much science he
[34:00] said that's of the devil right all this
[34:03] doubting about uh the word of
[34:05] God he said this civilization is going
[34:08] to be destroyed he said there'll be no
[34:10] cars there'll be no automobiles think of
[34:11] that there'll be no planes in the
[34:12] Millennium because we'll travel like a
[34:14] thought Hallelujah he said Cain's people
[34:18] focused on science Seth people called
[34:21] upon the
[34:22] Lord hallelujah glory to God at the 26
[34:27] minute mark he says the Catholic Church
[34:29] made a statement recently the Bible is
[34:31] just a history
[34:32] book and he said the Catholic Church
[34:35] said well the Bible wasn't actually
[34:36] available until 250 years ago that been
[34:39] around the late 1600s so the Catholic
[34:42] church was saying because of that you we
[34:44] only had the Bible 250 years but said
[34:46] that's a lie he said but he says uh the
[34:48] Catholic Church says because of that see
[34:49] we got to file the traditions of the
[34:51] church because we haven't had the Bible
[34:52] very
[34:54] long brother brandom said this quote
[34:56] what a subtle lie that
[34:59] is brother said we've had the Bible
[35:02] 3,000 years before Christ he
[35:04] says
[35:06] hallelujah he says even before Christ
[35:08] came he said but what do they do they're
[35:10] making fun of the Bible they're trying
[35:12] to substitute the Bible for tradition or
[35:15] the Bible for science or the Bible or
[35:19] for Liberation or he says freedom of
[35:21] women he calls it which is uh slavery of
[35:24] women to the devil
[35:26] right brother they're making fun of the
[35:28] Bible and look his emphasis with
[35:30] scoffers is they're going to be judged
[35:32] by the word of
[35:33] God he says everyone will be judged by
[35:36] the word because Christ is the word
[35:38] brother saying if God judges the the the
[35:40] World by the Catholic Church which
[35:41] Catholic church if God judges it by the
[35:44] Baptist which Baptist
[35:46] Church if he judges it by the message
[35:48] which Message Church brother said he'll
[35:51] do neither he'll judge it by his word
[35:53] and Christ is the word amen see we all
[35:56] got the same judgment standard it's the
[35:58] word of God that's why if we remain
[36:00] humble he'll guide us into all truth as
[36:02] he
[36:03] promised that's how we know that we have
[36:05] Humble Hearts he we get more truth as
[36:08] time goes on brother said they're trying
[36:10] to push out the Bible and take Creeds
[36:13] and walk by it
[36:16] Hallelujah he said this revival of his
[36:18] now he breaks into his Revival has been
[36:20] sweeping for 20 years and it will never
[36:23] be a denomination now you know I
[36:25] preached this before uh any church that
[36:27] adds a man-made Creed if they don't
[36:29] repent of that they become a
[36:31] denomination right so the message itself
[36:35] all the bible promises we have like acts
[36:37] 238 right uh Hebrews 1 uh 2 about uh
[36:41] God's one person all the revelations
[36:43] father and Holy Ghost you know all all
[36:44] the truth of the Bible uh the serpent
[36:46] seed everything that we have Seven Seals
[36:48] all that is the truth of God's word
[36:50] hallelujah and it's been sweeping all
[36:53] those truths cannot be
[36:54] denominated Hallelujah
[36:57] other words brother R said you never put
[36:59] a period after what you believe you put
[37:01] a comma after what you
[37:02] believe
[37:04] Hallelujah and then brother breaks into
[37:07] this he said uh he says there's been
[37:09] blackouts going all over the east coast
[37:11] and all around the world he said people
[37:13] are wondering what is it he said it's a
[37:15] sign of the days we're living in and he
[37:18] goes back to the seven uh the seven
[37:20] Church age circles that were drawn in
[37:22] the back of Bram Tabernacle so if this
[37:24] was if this was Bram Tabernacle it be
[37:26] right above Acacia that's where those
[37:27] seven circles were drawn with the The
[37:30] partially shaded out areas of the light
[37:32] of the church ages so brother he's
[37:34] trying to get them to see modern things
[37:36] modern things happening are signs of the
[37:39] blackout in the churches that's right
[37:41] they're blacking out on the word of God
[37:44] they don't want the real word of God but
[37:46] I know you and I want the real word of
[37:48] God I know there's just a little light
[37:50] in that seventh circle but that little
[37:53] light is the light we're going to walk
[37:54] in Hallelujah I walk in the light such a
[37:56] beautiful light it shines where the D
[37:58] Drops of Mercy our bride amen shine all
[38:01] around us by day and by night Jesus the
[38:04] light of this world Amen he's the light
[38:06] of the church
[38:08] Hallelujah and then he quotes Zechariah
[38:10] which I've never I need to grow with
[38:12] this scripture I've never been able to
[38:13] fully understand that uh it shall be
[38:15] light about the evening time so I've
[38:16] never quite understood the context of
[38:18] that so that's why you never heard me
[38:19] preach on it because I can't understand
[38:21] that chapter of Zechariah but one day I
[38:23] will by God's grace Hallelujah because
[38:25] I'm looking at the context
[38:27] brother I talked about how the pillar of
[38:29] fire uh made those moons uh blacked out
[38:32] in the same forms of the church ages at
[38:34] brandham Tabernacle and he said Church
[38:36] Christ could come for his church at any
[38:39] time but there then all the scriptures
[38:41] have to be fulfilled Hallelujah now I'm
[38:44] about ready he's almost done with the
[38:45] scoffers so bear with me just a moment
[38:46] here we'll move on to the next section
[38:49] see brother said see the scoffers they
[38:51] didn't know what they were
[38:52] doing and he uses Caiaphas as an example
[38:57] Kai is there uh he's trying to murder
[39:00] Jesus but the bi but the Bible said he
[39:03] prophesied he's got a hatred towards
[39:06] Jesus but that must have left him for a
[39:08] moment and the Holy Spirit got on him
[39:09] and he prophesied and said it's
[39:11] expedient that one man died for the
[39:13] whole
[39:16] nation and then that Spirit must have
[39:18] left him right because then he rips he
[39:21] he rip he rips his clothes garments and
[39:23] slaps him they spit on him the Son of
[39:25] God think about that
[39:28] think how quickly they go from under the
[39:29] anointing and out the anointing God help
[39:31] us to stay in the anointing day and
[39:33] night
[39:33] Hallelujah not be double-minded like
[39:36] we've been preaching
[39:37] on Cai is brother said they brother said
[39:40] they were singing my God my God why has
[39:42] Thou forsaken me in the temple while
[39:45] Jesus is out there saying it on the
[39:47] cross and brother said they're so
[39:49] blinded they couldn't even see
[39:51] it they still couldn't see it they're
[39:54] singing that song on that Friday Friday
[39:57] after afternoon they're singing the song
[39:59] and they they hear him say it but they
[40:00] can't connect they can't put it together
[40:02] he said because they were ordained to be
[40:04] scoffers but brother man said look at
[40:06] God's grace Jesus even prayed father
[40:08] forgive them they don't know what
[40:10] they're doing there were some people in
[40:12] there that didn't know what they were
[40:14] doing and so Jesus prayed for
[40:17] Mercy hallelujah oh it's
[40:20] beautiful brother Ram now then he takes
[40:22] that verse about Caiaphas and he brings
[40:24] in he said Caiaphas was blind to it he
[40:26] brings in Revelation 3 I believe 17 he
[40:29] said they'll be miserable wretched poor
[40:32] blind blind and naked and he says
[40:35] blind he said they're blind to the word
[40:37] of God they're scoffing at it making fun
[40:40] of it Hallelujah but see it's falling
[40:44] under the anointing for this day see we
[40:48] we got to fall under the Holy Spirit
[40:49] they're falling under the anti-christ
[40:52] spirit right the pale horse rider oh
[40:54] thank God that we got the eagle
[40:55] anointing Hallelujah the lying you
[40:58] anointing the scoffers are against this
[41:00] word against this Revelation but we fly
[41:03] above the
[41:04] scoffing now I gave you this example let
[41:06] me give you two modern day scoffers I
[41:08] thought hope you like these
[41:09] these the recent Supreme Court justice
[41:13] as I said last week was asked when when
[41:15] she was getting approved what is a woman
[41:17] and she said I don't know you got I'm
[41:19] not a
[41:21] biologist and now she's sitting on the
[41:23] Supreme Court think about that the woman
[41:25] interpreting all the laws how they apply
[41:27] doesn't know what a woman is well I'm
[41:29] sorry there's a lot of laws about men
[41:30] and women
[41:33] right and then I saw this meme I thought
[41:36] I'd share with you just the the words of
[41:37] it if she can't Define a woman why is
[41:40] she campaigning for the first woman
[41:43] president how can you know she's a woman
[41:45] she might be a man she might be a
[41:49] man like some of our previous presidents
[41:52] and their
[41:53] spouses no I'm just I'm just being silly
[41:56] but look at that they say I don't know a
[41:59] woman I don't know what a woman is but
[42:01] we want the first woman present that's
[42:03] plain blindness everybody see that
[42:06] that's spiritual
[42:08] blindness that's called lying through
[42:10] your
[42:11] teeth like a hypocrite that's kind of
[42:14] rough but that's the truth see they're
[42:16] Anointed with that Spirit to lie and yet
[42:19] this person's exalted now some of I'm
[42:21] sure there's three or four just like
[42:22] that they're just the same I'm not
[42:23] picking out on this person yeah there's
[42:25] three or four on the on maybe two or
[42:27] three on the court just like that person
[42:29] but then they're looked at too as
[42:31] they're the ones who really have wisdom
[42:32] to interpret the law and they don't even
[42:34] know what a woman
[42:36] is just look at the XY chromosomes
[42:39] that's all you really got to do
[42:42] Mercy now this second one I thought you
[42:44] like this one this was I heard this uh
[42:46] Ken on uh not kenam it was uh Ray
[42:49] Comfort Ray Comfort how many know this
[42:51] astrophysicist named Neil Degrassi Tyson
[42:55] everybody heard of him well he really
[42:57] gives Christians a hard time he's
[43:00] atheist but I heard him say this
[43:04] uh uh interview asked him uh where does
[43:08] human life come from and he said we are
[43:11] literally
[43:14] Stardust he said he was asked on the
[43:16] origin of the world where uh where did
[43:19] we come from he said Stardust we come
[43:21] from the
[43:22] stars now Church in one way he's a
[43:25] million miles off in another way he's
[43:27] kind of
[43:28] close so bear with me here so let me
[43:32] read what the history says he's a
[43:33] well-known
[43:36] astrophysicist and he emphasizes that
[43:38] human life is deeply connected to the
[43:42] cosmos how many would say Amen to that
[43:45] I'll say Amen to that yeah yeah yeah
[43:47] human life got here from the cosmos but
[43:50] it's from the creator of the cosmos not
[43:53] from the cosmos themselves his statement
[43:56] about beings made of Stardust refers to
[43:59] the scientific now this ain't scientific
[44:01] so here's the LIE this ridiculous
[44:04] concept they call it
[44:06] scientific based on the origins of the
[44:08] elements that make up everything
[44:10] including living organisms so his
[44:13] argument goes back to where did all
[44:15] these elements come from they must have
[44:17] come from the Stars that's his argument
[44:20] okay now let me tell you how these
[44:22] elements came into humans that we have
[44:25] today
[44:27] in the early Universe only the lighter
[44:30] elements like hydrogen and helium were
[44:32] present now I'm a long ways from
[44:34] remembering my chemistry class so I I'm
[44:37] just reading this I don't understand any
[44:38] of this except for at the
[44:41] end there it
[44:44] is let
[44:47] me okay yeah over time stars formed and
[44:52] through nuclear fusion they produced
[44:55] heavier elements such as
[44:57] carbon oxygen nitrogen and iron these
[45:00] elements are crucial for Life as we know
[45:01] it when stars reach the end of their
[45:03] life cycles what do they do they have
[45:06] Supernova explosions good buddy
[45:09] good so he says uh he says there's all
[45:11] these elements out there and the nuclear
[45:13] fision and all the gases up there create
[45:16] these Stars okay like like that's
[45:17] scientific right like they've never
[45:19] proved that he says but then they the
[45:23] stars explode and the and they release
[45:26] these element M into outer space so
[45:28] first there was the lighter elements and
[45:29] then after all this Fusion you had stars
[45:32] and the Stars exploded and released all
[45:34] these heavier elements that makes no
[45:36] sense but here's what he says over
[45:39] billions of
[45:40] years this
[45:42] Stardust colest who knows what colest
[45:46] means come it means come together to
[45:49] form one mass or whole unite join
[45:52] together or combine so after all these
[45:54] Stars exploded everything just kind of
[45:57] comes
[45:59] together all these elements just kind of
[46:02] find their way to come
[46:04] together now you and I have enough sense
[46:07] to know that if we go get some dynamite
[46:09] and we go explode something out there
[46:11] out there in the churchyard you know in
[46:13] a million years it's never going to come
[46:14] back
[46:16] together in fact let's take one of your
[46:18] greatest enemies let's take your cell
[46:19] phone and let's go explode out let's go
[46:21] put some Dynamite on there I'm just
[46:23] joking and let's explode it and let's
[46:25] see if that ever will come back together
[46:26] through the the Sun and everything it's
[46:28] never going to
[46:29] happen this is what a smart
[46:32] astrophysicist does you know I looked up
[46:34] his job description he don't have a very
[46:36] hard job they look at data they teach it
[46:39] they make guesses they look at some more
[46:42] data they and analyze it they teach it
[46:44] they're just a bunch of smart know
[46:46] nothings as far as know nothing about
[46:48] the word of God who have they helped
[46:51] nobody they've only helped bring
[46:53] people's Faith down in Christ and this
[46:56] ties in with last week remember the
[46:57] Bible said there's all these it's the
[46:59] foolishness of the world this is foolish
[47:03] yeah people look at them and say oh he's
[47:04] a doctor or they Supreme Court Justice M
[47:06] they're really to be respected you
[47:08] should respect them and it's foolishness
[47:10] they can't Define a woman and God
[47:12] defines it just by your own sight
[47:13] Hallelujah can tell a woman right and
[47:16] then Common Sense any science remember
[47:18] science must be repeatable right have
[47:21] they taught you the scientific method
[47:22] you have to observe something and it has
[47:24] to be repeatable over and over again if
[47:27] you can't observe it and you doesn't
[47:28] repeat it's not science it's it's
[47:31] imagination it's a fallacy it's a fable
[47:35] it's a fairy tale amen and so this
[47:38] astrophysicist is giving people fairy
[47:40] tales when the word of God says let
[47:42] there be light and there was Hallelujah
[47:45] the word of God explains it perfectly
[47:47] brother BR said it like this God spoke
[47:49] the word he believed it and then it came
[47:51] to pass God believed his own word
[47:55] hallelujah oh amen Oh Glory to God over
[47:59] billions of years this uh dust star dust
[48:04] cast into new stars planets and
[48:07] eventually it turned into living
[48:10] organisms
[48:13] Stardust that's complete
[48:17] nonsense so there's no scientific method
[48:20] you can't prove this this is a fairy
[48:23] tale just like the the evidence you can
[48:25] defeat uh Evolution very
[48:28] simply right first of all uh there's
[48:32] never been an organism add DNA data to
[48:35] their
[48:37] DNA right so for a monkey to go from a
[48:39] human he needs some different DNA added
[48:41] to him and no organism has ever added
[48:45] DNA information to another one right
[48:47] whatever is in the seed that's what it's
[48:49] going to be can't add information in
[48:51] there right to produce a new like a it's
[48:54] never happened naturally right and the
[48:57] second proof there's no evolution is we
[48:59] never how come today we don't see any
[49:01] organisms turn like in the middle
[49:03] turning into from like a monkey to a
[49:06] human right or like uh a dog into a ape
[49:10] or something like that you know I don't
[49:12] you don't see any like mixture
[49:16] uh evolving
[49:18] creatures whatever the creature is
[49:20] that's what it is because God made it
[49:22] and God said it's
[49:23] good Hallelujah I love how Ray Comfort
[49:27] says uh well if the chicken or the egg
[49:29] was first well then who was who who
[49:31] Evolved first was it the the female
[49:33] chicken or the the the male
[49:36] chicken that's a good question if the
[49:38] female evolved there's no male how's it
[49:40] going to reproduce it ain't going to
[49:41] reproduce well now you got to have some
[49:43] really smart Stardust that makes a male
[49:45] and female at just the right time over
[49:48] millions of years that's some pretty
[49:49] smart Stardust I'd like to get some of
[49:51] that can create me some I don't know
[49:53] create me some help I don't know that's
[49:55] really really pretty powerful Stardust
[49:57] right there it's basically saying that
[50:00] stars listen listen what it's saying
[50:02] it's basically saying Stars contain DNA
[50:05] because DNA is the building blocks of
[50:08] life Zion asked me recently daddy how
[50:10] tall are you or how tall is Malachi I
[50:12] said or Malachi is taller than you I
[50:14] said because that was in his DNA buddy
[50:16] he's like okay like he understands that
[50:17] you know I said there's a there's a plan
[50:21] in in in your blood I said Z I'm sure he
[50:23] was catching this lesson there's there's
[50:25] a plan written in the cells of your
[50:26] blood and it says make the hair this
[50:28] color right make the eyes this color and
[50:30] make make make the the legs this long
[50:33] and all it does uh the living things the
[50:36] blood cells just do those white blood
[50:38] cells they do what's written there in
[50:39] the DNA they just go to heal and they go
[50:41] to attack the germs they go to build all
[50:44] the bone cells you know it's already in
[50:47] there God put it in there praise God but
[50:50] this smart guy the scoffer is saying
[50:52] there's DNA in the Stars I'm sorry you
[50:54] won't find that in science
[50:57] my
[51:00] goodness how many thankful that we have
[51:02] the simple plain Gospel of Jesus
[51:04] Christ and these people are they go on
[51:06] the uh to promote their latest book or
[51:08] their latest lie they go on these night
[51:10] shows and they're so honored and revered
[51:13] fools the Bible
[51:15] said right God has made the wise of this
[51:17] world
[51:19] fools oh you're a judge but you don't
[51:21] know what a boy or girl is you're the
[51:23] greatest judge in one of the greatest
[51:24] nine judges in the world really and you
[51:26] don't even know what a girl is or a
[51:28] woman and then you're the smartest
[51:30] astrophysicist ever believe in fairy
[51:34] tales oh thank God for the truth of the
[51:36] word hallelujah now brother R now he
[51:40] moves off of scoffers and that's where
[51:41] I'm going to move off of scoffers
[51:43] here and then he gets into Revelation
[51:45] the importance of Revelation for a
[51:47] moment so let's look at a few that he
[51:48] preaches about eight minutes on
[51:49] Revelation then he gets into a lection
[51:51] all in this sermon on the Rapture
[51:54] brother said but the Rapture is a revel
[51:56] ation to the bride and he said she'll be
[51:58] waiting for that Revelation how many
[52:01] waiting for it that's why I don't want
[52:03] to miss church that's why I don't want
[52:04] to miss a day to read my Bible or pray I
[52:06] don't want to miss it I want to stay in
[52:08] the word of God hallelujah brother bam
[52:11] said Revelation is faith faith is a
[52:13] revelation he says and notice it's like
[52:16] when
[52:17] Abraham could call those things not as
[52:21] though they were now this was a great
[52:23] lesson to me in here great lesson to all
[52:25] of us I'm going to PR preach it Lord
[52:26] willing I'm going to preach a sermon on
[52:28] Divine Healing again just to kind of
[52:29] show again the there there's all these
[52:31] Extremes in Divine Healing right my wife
[52:34] and I we've been finding quotes where
[52:35] brother man says you can't tell God
[52:37] anything to do you can't speak anything
[52:38] what you want you got to do what God
[52:39] wants but there's other quotes that say
[52:41] speak the word whatever you want you got
[52:43] quotes on both sides amen hallelujah and
[52:46] I just read yesterday where uh that that
[52:49] sister stad cleff she's from Germany her
[52:51] husband was a German soldier uh she was
[52:54] there in Mexico when they brought the
[52:55] dead baby to brother brandham the baby
[52:57] was dead all day it died in the morning
[53:01] and they took it to the doctor uh they
[53:03] uh they took the doctor they brought to
[53:04] brother r that night she pushed her way
[53:05] through the crowd right brother saw the
[53:07] vision pray for the baby came back to
[53:08] life after a day of being dead sister
[53:11] stad saw that she flew back to Germany
[53:14] she had a baby the baby died and said
[53:16] brother ram my husband's in the military
[53:18] he's going to fly you over
[53:20] here so you can pray for the baby and
[53:22] brother R said let me pray about that
[53:24] first
[53:27] brother said other brothers were saying
[53:28] yes God's going to raise up the baby
[53:29] brother said let me pray about it first
[53:31] remember for two days he didn't get an
[53:32] answer the third day the Lord said don't
[53:35] touch it that's my hand don't rebuke
[53:38] that remember
[53:40] that now why didn't she just speak the
[53:44] word because it was God's will to take
[53:47] the
[53:49] child does see we need some maturity
[53:51] around the message praise God well I
[53:53] thought every uh a positive attitude
[53:56] toward any promise of God will bring it
[53:57] to pass it will if it's revealed to you
[54:00] glory amen I'm getting in my sermon
[54:02] ahead of time okay I'm kind of preaching
[54:04] my Divine Healing sermon already but
[54:05] that's true that quote Works any
[54:07] positive attitude toward the promise of
[54:09] God that God's revealed to you will
[54:11] bring it to pass
[54:13] Hallelujah but still in every case you
[54:15] have to find the will of God
[54:18] hallelujah and you know what that woman
[54:19] C call called up brother crying and I I
[54:22] got the quote brother BR was saying or
[54:23] she said well brother Brandon what was
[54:25] the problem was it the weakness of my
[54:27] faith he said no sister you had great
[54:29] faith amen what my child died and I had
[54:35] great faith brother said yes you had
[54:36] great faith it was God testing your
[54:40] faith
[54:42] Hallelujah so see church that that's
[54:44] that's a great balance there you can
[54:46] have great faith this is why I want to
[54:47] preach the extremes I'm already
[54:48] preaching my sermon but since I'm
[54:49] already in it I'm going to say
[54:50] it you can have great faith and not get
[54:53] your answer or you can have little faith
[54:55] or no faith and God answer your
[55:00] prayer but see it that's why it's it's
[55:02] so sad when people say God will once to
[55:04] heal every single time what about sister
[55:06] stad
[55:07] Cliffe see it's totally unbalanced and
[55:10] remember the Lutheran Dean brother wrote
[55:12] a letter and put it out uh to brother
[55:13] Bram said I just want to say I
[55:15] appreciate brother brandham how he
[55:16] waited to get a clearcut decision from
[55:19] God before he said something about the
[55:23] baby see brother and so in other words
[55:25] brother saying find the will of God
[55:27] first before you speak something now
[55:29] unless you're led to speak by the Holy
[55:32] Spirit and that ties perfectly into the
[55:35] scripture about
[55:36] Abraham Hallelujah where brother R said
[55:38] it he said faith is a revelation just
[55:42] like it was revealed to Abraham how
[55:44] could Abraham call those things not as
[55:46] though they were because God had
[55:48] revealed to him that he was going to
[55:50] have a child through
[55:51] Sarah amen and if God had told him that
[55:55] then he could call his old body he could
[55:57] call the deadness of his loins he could
[55:59] call this this is a lie because God has
[56:02] already revealed to me I've got faith
[56:04] for Divine Healing and church we can
[56:05] have faith for a Rapture Hallelujah
[56:08] because it's in the scripture praise God
[56:10] right 1 Thessalonians 4 uh 1 Corinthians
[56:13] 15:51 to 58 the Rapture is in the Bible
[56:16] praise God we just got to make sure
[56:18] we've got the token to go in the Rapture
[56:21] Allelujah Hallelujah that's why this
[56:24] this message is so important he lays
[56:27] that in
[56:28] there Abraham could only call it not
[56:31] because he had a thus sayith the Lord
[56:33] like I told that example for you young
[56:35] people I had a friend uh he's a little
[56:37] older than you guys he was right out
[56:38] he's about 19 years old and my friend
[56:41] said this he said I claim that girl I'm
[56:43] going to marry that girl I claim her he
[56:45] was trying to speak the word like a real
[56:48] uh flying high an eagle anointed person
[56:50] or something like that right he was just
[56:53] he was just you know he heard brother
[56:54] ramam say claim things and without the
[56:56] context he claims it well within a year
[56:59] she she she didn't even give this guy a
[57:01] minute of the day and she within a year
[57:03] she married some other handsome guy over
[57:05] there then he's got he kind of got
[57:07] discouraged but then you know he had to
[57:08] wait a little while he had to learn that
[57:09] you just can't claim everything you want
[57:11] that's right you got to be led by God to
[57:13] claim things amen so think about that
[57:16] any a positive attitude he could had the
[57:18] positive attitude oh even though she's
[57:19] engaged she's still going to marry me
[57:20] well now that's going too far
[57:22] right he could have saw her engaged and
[57:24] said well God's still gonna give her to
[57:25] me God and he'd have to die for them to
[57:28] be rightfully married see every positive
[57:31] any positive promise of or any positive
[57:33] attitude will bring it to pass no it
[57:34] won't unless God showed it to you does
[57:37] everybody understand that that's crucial
[57:40] that's crucial to understand Hallelujah
[57:43] and see it's going to take a balance by
[57:44] the Holy Spirit by God's
[57:47] grace
[57:48] Hallelujah and it's this example brother
[57:51] bam gave too uh brother bam said two
[57:54] apostles were put into prison Peter and
[57:57] James only one of them got
[58:01] out James died he was
[58:04] martyred don't you think the saints were
[58:06] praying for
[58:08] him what made Peter any greater than
[58:11] James right oh did God fail with James
[58:15] no God took his son home when it was his
[58:17] time to go home Hallelujah like brother
[58:19] said he need a Little Flower by his
[58:20] altar you know sometimes in in the in
[58:22] the big churches they put flowers we
[58:23] don't do it here because we're not
[58:24] really denomination we're not but I
[58:27] don't really care about the decorations
[58:28] I mean I could put flowers here but it
[58:31] doesn't mean anything but brother RS
[58:32] uses that imagery he said see God had to
[58:34] pull up James and he needed a flower
[58:36] right by the throne up
[58:38] there he needed a he he wanted his his
[58:41] son or he wanted his daughter he wanted
[58:43] them with him in heaven at that time
[58:45] because God knows the best
[58:47] time God knows more than our time
[58:51] Hallelujah but look at Peter both are
[58:53] men of God Peter gets in prison the
[58:55] church prays and he gets an angel escort
[58:58] he gets the first automatic door before
[58:59] the hat at grocery stores he gets the
[59:01] first automatic door that opens
[59:03] itself right we walk in there and the
[59:05] camera sees us and the doors open Peter
[59:07] had that first Hallelujah yeah I heard a
[59:10] preacher say that I like that one Peter
[59:13] had it first before Walmart had it Peter
[59:14] had it before that the world always
[59:17] copies the word of
[59:18] God but look at that two men one man
[59:22] lives one man dies it was God's will
[59:24] Peter still had to write the statue of
[59:25] perfect man
[59:26] amen I just got that now he still had to
[59:28] write that praise God he had to say
[59:30] build up your faith virtue knowledge
[59:32] patience Temperance God brotherly
[59:33] kindness and receive charity Hallelujah
[59:35] he still had a Ministry to go but God
[59:36] was done with
[59:38] James and that's why people even think
[59:40] you know with this election coming up
[59:41] you know at when President Trump got
[59:43] shot at in Butler the bullet grazed his
[59:46] ear that's caused some people to believe
[59:48] in God because other bullets hit other
[59:51] people one person died two people are
[59:53] finally recovered but it explains that
[59:55] why did did one person live and one
[59:57] person die God's not done with them yet
[1:00:01] so we can thank God we're still
[1:00:03] here but I'll say like this we could
[1:00:05] also thank God if one of us left because
[1:00:06] then they'd be with God and their work
[1:00:08] on here would be done now we would mourn
[1:00:11] yes we would mourn because that's our
[1:00:12] human emotions just like Jesus Jesus
[1:00:13] wept he loved Lazarus so much that
[1:00:16] precious brother he wept he could feel
[1:00:19] the pain of losing someone he loved but
[1:00:21] he understood God's got a perfect time
[1:00:23] God's got a purpose his ways are higher
[1:00:25] than mine ways hallelujah amen his ways
[1:00:28] are past finding out God has plans that
[1:00:30] we don't always
[1:00:32] understand so see church it's going to
[1:00:34] take a revelation and I'm almost closing
[1:00:36] here it's going to take a revelation
[1:00:39] that's why brother said each person must
[1:00:41] find the mystery of God's will for their
[1:00:43] own
[1:00:45] life find what God has called you to do
[1:00:49] what God want you to do and then do it
[1:00:51] with all your
[1:00:52] heart remember the thief on the cross
[1:00:55] cross what was his purpose of his life
[1:00:57] to be right by Jesus to live a wicked
[1:00:59] life but yet at the very end of his life
[1:01:02] he'd be a deathbed confession how many
[1:01:04] people brother William over the last
[1:01:05] 2,000 years have been saved because of
[1:01:07] the thief on the cross the hope that
[1:01:10] even in the final hours before death
[1:01:13] Jesus will show Mercy if they'll just
[1:01:15] say remember me Hallelujah if they say
[1:01:17] God remember me I don't want to be lost
[1:01:20] may I be with you in heaven and surely
[1:01:22] Jesus if he's the same yesterday today
[1:01:24] and forever if he is the same he he'd
[1:01:26] say the same thing today you'll be up
[1:01:28] here with me in Paradise hallelujah amen
[1:01:31] amen that was the purpose of his
[1:01:34] life he couldn't argue about that he
[1:01:36] couldn't debate that he couldn't change
[1:01:38] that he just walked in the plan and
[1:01:41] purpose for his life he just had to be a
[1:01:43] testimony to the grace of almighty
[1:01:46] God are you thankful for Amazing Grace
[1:01:49] today it's Revelation God's got to give
[1:01:52] us a revelation of the will of God for
[1:01:55] our lives
[1:01:56] I think of all these young people God
[1:01:59] bless you young people I think of all
[1:02:00] these young people out there God's got a
[1:02:02] plan for your life
[1:02:03] Hallelujah just be humble brother man
[1:02:05] says it later here just be humble and
[1:02:07] accept God's plan for your life just
[1:02:10] wait upon the Lord and he'll renew your
[1:02:12] strength amen wait on God to reveal it
[1:02:16] to you don't be in a rush don't be in a
[1:02:18] hurry
[1:02:18] Hallelujah wait on the Lord wait for
[1:02:23] Revelation and then God will show you
[1:02:25] you uh his will for your life Hallelujah
[1:02:28] I've told you my testimonies I thought
[1:02:29] about tell my I always tell my
[1:02:30] testimonies you guys know my testimonies
[1:02:31] inside outside you can remember them
[1:02:33] better than me I always forget him let
[1:02:35] me try to close but said next a Baptist
[1:02:38] Minister came to him uh he says uh he
[1:02:41] didn't agree with brother's teaching on
[1:02:43] Revelation and the brother said brother
[1:02:45] Bram you're all mixed up and brother
[1:02:46] Bram said this listen he said then I
[1:02:49] pray you'll help straighten me out
[1:02:52] that's a nice attitude to
[1:02:54] have well I'm a prophet of God who are
[1:02:56] you to correct a prophet of
[1:02:59] God I'm the seven Church age messenger
[1:03:01] I've got a a Divine gift delivered by an
[1:03:03] Angel who are you to correct me brother
[1:03:05] R said I hope you'll help correct me and
[1:03:07] straighten me
[1:03:09] out Hallelujah there's a sermon I forget
[1:03:12] it's in 1965 right before brother Ram
[1:03:14] died he said he's preaching at the
[1:03:15] beginning he said there's all these
[1:03:16] doctorates back here he said I hope
[1:03:18] they'll correct me if I get something
[1:03:20] wrong after the
[1:03:21] service brother BR was willing to be
[1:03:24] corrected yes brother BR was willing to
[1:03:25] be correct Ed you think he was lying no
[1:03:28] he was
[1:03:29] humble he realized there's majors and
[1:03:31] minors Hallelujah in fact in the sermon
[1:03:33] he makes two obvious mistakes he said
[1:03:36] Enoch was the seventh from Noah look it
[1:03:39] up all you quote Searchers if you love
[1:03:41] to search the quotes I do I want to is
[1:03:43] that right preacher I'd love to go find
[1:03:45] those quotes he says it twice Enoch was
[1:03:48] the seventh from
[1:03:50] Noah I hope you go listen to the sermon
[1:03:52] this week and then he reads uh the shout
[1:03:55] voice Trump and he said let's look at
[1:03:56] our text from second
[1:03:59] Thessalonians why is that wrong because
[1:04:02] it was in first
[1:04:03] Thessalonians anybody been reading their
[1:04:05] Bible lately shout voice Trump that
[1:04:08] comes out of first Thessalonians 4
[1:04:11] brother manam says let's go to Second
[1:04:13] Thessalonians church he was in a hurry
[1:04:16] he was getting pushed out by the woman
[1:04:17] he's a man Hallelujah but he never said
[1:04:21] anything wrong with thus sayith the
[1:04:23] Lord and then then then now now think
[1:04:25] this then all these people will say oh
[1:04:26] every word on tape is thus say you can't
[1:04:28] correct a prophet I'm not trying to
[1:04:30] correct him he would he would want to be
[1:04:32] corrected right he would want us if I go
[1:04:36] try to read second Thessalonians look
[1:04:38] for shop voice Trump I'm not going to
[1:04:39] find it how can I preach the shout voice
[1:04:42] Trump if it's not in second
[1:04:43] Thessalonians if I believe every word is
[1:04:44] thus sayith the Lord I ain't gonna find
[1:04:46] I ain't gonna have nothing to preach out
[1:04:47] of I have to change my
[1:04:49] text it's so simple thank God for the
[1:04:52] humility of the Holy Spirit he says then
[1:04:54] I pray you'll help straighten me out
[1:04:56] and then remember in the same sermon
[1:04:58] brother Ram said nobody corrects a
[1:05:00] prophet in the same sermon brother
[1:05:02] Jose brother Bram says I pray you'll
[1:05:04] help straighten me out and he says I'm
[1:05:06] open to be corrected in the same sermon
[1:05:08] later he says there's two kinds of
[1:05:10] prophet gifts there's the gift of
[1:05:12] Prophecy in the church and then there's
[1:05:15] a prophet like a major
[1:05:17] prophet brother said with a minor
[1:05:19] prophet in the church if someone would
[1:05:20] say thus sayith the Lord in here we
[1:05:22] would need two or three people that have
[1:05:24] discernment that would judge is this
[1:05:26] from God or not before we can accept it
[1:05:29] now we've only had one but I was out
[1:05:30] that Sunday and that was where it
[1:05:32] actually said thus sayi the Lord and
[1:05:33] foretold something I was out that Sunday
[1:05:36] so we didn't do it that Sunday but you
[1:05:38] if someone gives a gift the prophecy
[1:05:39] thus say the Lord tomorrow at this time
[1:05:41] is going to happen like that like
[1:05:43] that we would need three people at least
[1:05:45] two to stand here and pray and say yeah
[1:05:47] that's the Holy Spirit or no that's a
[1:05:49] lying Spirit now what a thing to say to
[1:05:50] your brother or sister talk about love
[1:05:53] talk about
[1:05:54] maturity now what what if they were
[1:05:55] lying would you have would you have the
[1:05:57] mercy to sayh I think you're off the
[1:05:59] word here I think you got the wrong
[1:06:01] Spirit brother sister you got the wrong
[1:06:04] Spirit the devil got in there and
[1:06:05] tricked you would you have the grace to
[1:06:07] say that that's the book of Acts church
[1:06:09] right there because Peter told ananas
[1:06:11] and saf you've lied to the Holy
[1:06:13] Ghost
[1:06:14] Hallelujah so the same sermon brother
[1:06:17] says I hope he says I'll pray you'll
[1:06:18] straighten me out and then later he says
[1:06:20] but nobody stood before that Prophet to
[1:06:22] correct him he's talking about Isaiah
[1:06:24] Jeremiah
[1:06:26] right who was there brother will to When
[1:06:27] when when when he had written a virgin
[1:06:29] shall conceive who is there to correct
[1:06:31] that
[1:06:33] nobody right just like when Jeremiah
[1:06:35] remember Jeremiah had his uh Scrolls
[1:06:37] written down by somebody who was there
[1:06:39] to correct Jeremiah nobody he just had a
[1:06:41] scribe to write it down so that's what
[1:06:43] brother R is saying any thus sayth the
[1:06:45] Lord cannot be corrected by a prophet
[1:06:48] because it's God's word amen thus sayith
[1:06:51] the Lords don't fail thus sayith the
[1:06:54] lord it's eternal thus sayith the Lord
[1:06:56] is life you can hang your soul on thus
[1:06:59] sayith the Lord hallelujah nobody stands
[1:07:01] before to correct that now do you prove
[1:07:03] all things yes you got to go back
[1:07:04] brother you got to prove all things make
[1:07:06] sure it comes to
[1:07:07] pass but brother said nobody stands
[1:07:09] before a prophet to correct Isaiah no uh
[1:07:12] you got the wrong word a virgin shall
[1:07:14] conceive no uh it was something else a
[1:07:17] virgin shall rejoice in the Holy Ghost
[1:07:19] no no nobody was there to correct the
[1:07:21] prophet you
[1:07:24] understand so in the same sermon brother
[1:07:26] says correct me and then he says
[1:07:27] prophets you can't can't stand before a
[1:07:29] prophet to correct him it's all about
[1:07:30] the
[1:07:32] context Hallelujah would you be
[1:07:34] surprised how many preachers have shared
[1:07:36] that with me and said oh brother Jesse
[1:07:37] you're off you're trying to correct the
[1:07:39] prophet or nobody can stand before a
[1:07:40] prophet well there's all they're
[1:07:43] corrected All Through the Bible brother
[1:07:45] said my wife is my correction I mean
[1:07:47] what are you gonna do with that his wife
[1:07:49] was his correction it's just uh it's a I
[1:07:53] think I told my wife one time we're
[1:07:54] talking about it it's like a when when
[1:07:56] someone's fearful and they're wrong
[1:07:57] they'll just attack to they'll just
[1:07:59] attack you because they're afraid it's
[1:08:00] kind of like a wounded animal right you
[1:08:02] try to help a wounded animal try to
[1:08:03] attack you that's what some of these
[1:08:05] preachers you know they're wounded
[1:08:07] animal or they're wounded Eagles I'll
[1:08:08] say like that they're wounded
[1:08:10] Eagles right they they know their they
[1:08:12] know their logic is wrong so they just
[1:08:14] attack and anyone that's against me uh I
[1:08:17] can't love them God help us to have the
[1:08:19] love of the Holy
[1:08:20] Ghost
[1:08:23] Hallelujah wellam said he says we need
[1:08:26] every we need every word word on word
[1:08:30] hallelujah I'm going to close here let
[1:08:32] me close uh 12 let me find one place to
[1:08:34] close
[1:08:37] it yeah let me finish with Revelation
[1:08:39] I'll finish on this thought right here
[1:08:40] he says brother reads Matthew 16 Upon
[1:08:43] This Rock I'll build my church it's been
[1:08:45] revealed by the father brother said it's
[1:08:47] the spiritual revelation of who Jesus is
[1:08:50] the revelation of the word in its season
[1:08:53] he says the Book of Revelation is the
[1:08:55] last book of the Bible it's sealed to
[1:08:57] unbelievers see that's why they can't
[1:08:59] recognize the Seven Seals because
[1:09:00] they're unbelievers they can't recognize
[1:09:03] the truth of the Seven Seals brother
[1:09:05] sayso not add do not take one word away
[1:09:08] he says the Book of Revelation reveals
[1:09:10] the author of The Bible he's the Alpha
[1:09:12] and Omega the beginning and the end it's
[1:09:14] Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ and then brother breaks into his
[1:09:18] ministry he said Jesus has given us the
[1:09:21] revelation of the seven Church ages the
[1:09:23] Seven Seals Revelation 107 the days of
[1:09:26] the sounding of the voice of the seventh
[1:09:27] angel he says that's the age we're
[1:09:30] living in the Seven Seals should be
[1:09:32] opened at that day it won't be something
[1:09:34] outside the word he said but God will
[1:09:37] make it fit in with the rest of the
[1:09:40] scripture amen everybody catch that
[1:09:43] whatever brother man preached brought To
[1:09:45] Us by Revelation it has to already be in
[1:09:47] the Bible it can't be outside the Bible
[1:09:50] it's got to be something that's in the
[1:09:51] word of
[1:09:53] God hallelujah
[1:09:55] it won't be something outside the word
[1:09:58] it has to fit with the rest of the
[1:10:00] scripture and then brother says God
[1:10:02] don't need no interpreter he's his own
[1:10:07] interpreter
[1:10:08] Hallelujah did you know there's a Bible
[1:10:10] verse though that says the prophet is
[1:10:12] The
[1:10:14] Interpreter let me find that real
[1:10:18] quick yeah job pull up job 33:23
[1:10:27] a messenger is called interpreter how
[1:10:29] many know John the Baptist was called a
[1:10:30] messenger a
[1:10:31] forerunner My Messenger will go before
[1:10:33] my face and prepare prepare the way of
[1:10:35] the Lord job said if there is a
[1:10:38] messenger with him an interpreter one
[1:10:40] among a thousand to show unto man his
[1:10:43] uprightness Hallelujah so a messenger is
[1:10:45] an interpreter so what does that mean if
[1:10:48] brother says uh God doesn't need an
[1:10:49] interpreter that means the prophet is
[1:10:52] not adding his own idea the prophets
[1:10:54] just say what God Said everybody catch
[1:10:58] that and one again we have quotes on
[1:11:01] both sides one quote brother says
[1:11:02] brother R says I cannot interpret God's
[1:11:04] word and then there's a quote brother
[1:11:05] said the prophets are interpreters of
[1:11:07] God's word and I can say Amen to both
[1:11:10] because you have to take them in the
[1:11:11] right
[1:11:12] context Hallelujah every understand
[1:11:15] that only God gives the real
[1:11:17] interpretation so God's really the only
[1:11:20] interpreter Hallelujah but when a
[1:11:23] prophet speaks thus sayth the Lord he's
[1:11:24] giving you God's
[1:11:26] interpretation of the word of
[1:11:29] God okay I'm trying to help you so when
[1:11:33] you come across quotes that are seem
[1:11:35] opposing you'll know the truth behind
[1:11:38] it and you'll be solid in the word of
[1:11:40] God the quotes won't make you shake and
[1:11:43] quiver and uh run and talk to me about
[1:11:46] it which none of you have ever done but
[1:11:48] you won't run to your mama or your daddy
[1:11:50] or your husband or wife and I can't
[1:11:53] understand this just wait on the Lord
[1:11:54] he'll renew your
[1:11:56] strength there are answers church if we
[1:11:58] just wait upon the Lord let me
[1:12:01] close brother man said God don't need
[1:12:03] interpreter he's his own interpreter he
[1:12:04] said search the scriptures Jesus said
[1:12:06] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:12:08] life and there are they which testify of
[1:12:11] me he said we must believe every part of
[1:12:14] the word he said Luther's age Wesley's
[1:12:15] age uh Pentecost and now the Seven Seals
[1:12:19] he said God is restoring the word of God
[1:12:22] and brother says Pentecost is still
[1:12:25] burning so I want you to catch this too
[1:12:28] it's that portion of the word so brother
[1:12:30] bam was living in the day after
[1:12:32] Pentecost how many remember 1906 when I
[1:12:34] preach on isza street it's been a little
[1:12:36] while it's been over a year now I hit
[1:12:37] the highlights of that it was amazing
[1:12:39] time called it the greatest Revival
[1:12:41] since the day of Pentecost that's what
[1:12:42] brother Bram said that's a pretty
[1:12:44] amazing
[1:12:46] Revival brother Braham said uh the
[1:12:49] critics the scoffers here we are scoff
[1:12:50] scoffers said oh it'll go out in a few
[1:12:53] years brother maram said it's still
[1:12:54] burning
[1:12:57] 1965 54 years later it's still burning
[1:13:01] brother said you'll never put it out now
[1:13:03] church if you caught that that means the
[1:13:06] gifts will never go out of
[1:13:09] fashion let's go deeper that means
[1:13:11] justification will never go out of
[1:13:13] fashion amen that means sanctification
[1:13:16] will never go out of fashion hallelujah
[1:13:18] we're always need that the young
[1:13:20] believers our young believers will
[1:13:21] always need justification right cuz
[1:13:23] there's going to come a time when God
[1:13:24] where the enem is going to test their
[1:13:26] faith whether they're saved or
[1:13:27] not if that hasn't happened to you yet
[1:13:30] brothers and we sister if that hasn't
[1:13:31] happened yet you rejoice but it's going

[1:13:40] going to come but you got something to
[1:13:42] fight him off with you got the sword of
[1:13:43] the
[1:13:44] spirit hallelujah praise
[1:13:47] God but said you have to fight for every
[1:13:50] inch of land that you possess right and
[1:13:53] then sometimes Satan will try to drive
[1:13:54] you back em you'll go back to this spot
[1:13:56] and say am I saved that's where you got
[1:13:57] to look down and say I nailed a post
[1:13:59] down there I had an experience there I
[1:14:01] know God did something right there I'm
[1:14:03] not going to forget that I'm going to
[1:14:05] get the rest of my land back
[1:14:07] Hallelujah he might drive you back to
[1:14:09] there but don't forget where you come
[1:14:11] from amen don't forget the promise of
[1:14:14] God don't forget God is faithful to
[1:14:16] every generation

[1:14:43] God help us to be ready hallelujah amen
[1:14:45] well said we're living in the day when
[1:14:48] the bride is being called out Pentecost
[1:14:50] is still burning he says hallelujah
[1:14:53] praise God Amen he he said it's that
[1:14:55] portion of the word and church that
[1:14:57] explains why the Israel can still be
[1:14:59] saved because the Mosaic Covenant is
[1:15:01] still in effect for
[1:15:03] them that's what brother said they they
[1:15:06] they're blinded to the New Covenant so
[1:15:08] they're still under the Mosaic Covenant
[1:15:10] but when that 144,000 sees Jesus that
[1:15:13] davidic Covenant is going to come alive
[1:15:15] to them because they're going to have a
[1:15:17] king from the lineage of David rule over
[1:15:19] Israel the Millennium that Covenant will
[1:15:22] not fail hallelujah oh my we're closer
[1:15:24] than ever Amen to Jesus reigning over
[1:15:28] Israel that's what we're singing
[1:15:29] marching desion that's a millennium song
[1:15:31] you know that we're marching up word
[1:15:33] design now we might might have to March
[1:15:34] we we'll March if we want to or we can
[1:15:37] travel like a thought like Star Wars or
[1:15:40] we not Star Wars star track can travel
[1:15:42] like a thought that's what Jesus did
[1:15:44] with his theop or his glorified body he
[1:15:46] traveled like a thought he go in through
[1:15:47] the doors in through the walls he could
[1:15:49] just go wherever he wanted so we can
[1:15:51] choose to March up with our people that
[1:15:53] we're ruling over
[1:15:56] or we can just transport up there
[1:15:59] Hallelujah I imagine I want to be with
[1:16:00] my people don't you have mercy don't you
[1:16:02] think you'd want to be with the people
[1:16:03] that you're leading and by God's grace
[1:16:05] you know we're trying to direct them and
[1:16:07] we got the rod of iron and I'm not
[1:16:08] trying to be prideful I'm just saying
[1:16:09] that's the promise of the word of God if
[1:16:11] you can be faithful with the Revelation
[1:16:13] he said I'll make you ruler over much
[1:16:16] amen closing with this the Rapture is
[1:16:18] only for the bride brother R quotes
[1:16:21] Revelation 20 he said the rest of the
[1:16:24] Dead live not till the thousand years
[1:16:27] were accomplished that's right brother
[1:16:29] that's the verse I think it's Revelation
[1:16:31] 12 or
[1:16:33] 20:4 that's his verse it's only for the
[1:16:35] bride the Rapture is only for the elect
