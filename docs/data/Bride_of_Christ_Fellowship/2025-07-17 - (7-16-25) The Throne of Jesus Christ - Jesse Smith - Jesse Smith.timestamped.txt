[0:00] Right? That was the logos. And then
[0:02] brother Ram said the first thing God
[0:04] made after he created a body for his son
[0:06] uh the light would have been angels.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; So the very first throne would have been
[0:12] the throne in heaven. Hallelujah.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Right? And then you would have had
[0:15] Lucifer and Michael right there. Right?
[0:17] You would have had uh throne guards as
[0:19] we'd say or archangels.
[0:22] All the angels of God would have
[0:23] worshiped him. Then God would have
[0:24] created the universe and then he created
[0:26] the earth. Right? And the Bible said all
[0:28] the angels sang, the sons of God sang
[0:30] and clapped and shouted for joy. Amen.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; When the earth uh had its foundation,
[0:34] hallelujah.
[0:36] But then uh you know God created man on
[0:39] the earth and the Bible said there was
[0:40] two trees in the garden. Now you and I
[0:43] know they weren't literal trees like
[0:45] that.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; I'm just putting that up there because
[0:48] that's what most people think. And
[0:51] brother Chris and I did a Bible study
[0:52] about two weeks ago and and he caught on
[0:54] to it. you know, he caught on to the
[0:56] fact that uh the serpent was offering
[0:58] Eve another way to eternal life, right?
[1:01] Because she already had access to the
[1:02] tree of life. There's only one kind of
[1:04] life, that's eternal life.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; So, uh the serpent was offering her
[1:09] another way to have eternal life, but
[1:11] there's only one way to eternal life.
[1:13] It's not by eating apples or oranges.
[1:15] It's by faith. Hallelujah.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; Eternal life is by faith, right? In God.
[1:19] Hallelujah. By we're saved by grace
[1:21] through faith. Hallelujah. So this is
[1:25] the first throne we'd say on the earth.
[1:27] Praise God. And you know, church, God
[1:30] then has always had a spiritual throne
[1:32] in the heavens. Hallelujah. He's always
[1:34] had one. And he's always going to have
[1:36] one until the very end,
[1:39] &gt;&gt; till the future home, the new Jerusalem.
[1:42] Okay. Now, uh what I want to say too is
[1:45] that the Bible says God is omnipotent,
[1:47] which means all powerful.
[1:50] So if God has all power, that means
[1:52] God's spirit can be wherever it wants to
[1:55] be. God's spirit can be in as many
[1:58] places as at at a time as possible. He
[2:01] knows all things. He He knows what's
[2:03] going to happen in the future, right? He
[2:05] He's the beginning and the end. Praise
[2:06] God. He's the first and the last.
[2:08] Hallelujah.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; He already knows what's going to happen
[2:10] because he's eternal. Praise God.
[2:13] And so it it doesn't stumble us to know
[2:16] that God's spirit can be on his throne
[2:18] in heaven and he can also have his
[2:20] spirit enthroned on earth.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; So that won't stumble us. Now to a new
[2:26] Christian that might stumble them. They
[2:27] might in other words they they might
[2:29] think when Jesus was on earth, you know,
[2:31] heaven was bankrupt. Impossible.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus could have the fullness of the
[2:35] Godhead in him which meant all power and
[2:37] all authority. And yet God's spirit
[2:39] could be on the throne in heaven. That
[2:42] doesn't stop God. Hallelujah. You can't
[2:45] stop God with location. God created
[2:47] locations. That means he's outside of
[2:49] locations.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. Doing pretty good
[2:53] for a start. Everybody with me?
[2:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now, if I get to
[2:57] a spot where you don't understand, I'm
[2:59] going to hold this up because Jen, this
[3:00] is the one Genevieve made.
[3:03] So, if you don't understand something,
[3:04] I'll give you a reminder here. Okay,
[3:05] Jen.
[3:07] Whoops. Did I accidentally click it?
[3:09] Okay. All right. Now,
[3:12] now you just got a little outline here.
[3:13] I'm going to start with Old Testament
[3:15] thrones, New Testament thrones, heavenly
[3:18] throne, and then I'll close with brother
[3:20] Ram's two great revelations on the
[3:22] throne of God. Okay? So, I'm going to go
[3:25] kind of quick because I got a YouTube
[3:26] video on this. If you want uh if you
[3:28] want a full teaching on it, you can go
[3:29] through there or just go slow. Take
[3:31] notes here tonight and go, you know,
[3:33] read them when you get home. Does
[3:34] everybody understand? By God's grace,
[3:35] I'm just going to go kind of quick just
[3:36] for time sake. And I got some visuals
[3:38] here uh by the grace of the Lord.
[3:42] Okay. So the first throne on earth was
[3:45] the garden of Eden, the tree of life.
[3:49] Hallelujah.
[3:51] Uh and then you know uh after sin,
[3:54] right? We know what happened. God walked
[3:57] in the cool of the evening, right? God
[3:58] walked down in the garden to try to find
[4:00] Adam and Eve from hiding. Okay? Uh and
[4:04] then we know there that then the uh that
[4:07] throne just became a little different,
[4:09] right? In other words, uh the throne was
[4:11] now guarded by cherubam. So Adam and Eve
[4:14] couldn't get back into the throne.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Before they sinned, they had access to
[4:18] the tree of life, the spirit of God.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But after sin, now notice
[4:23] what God do. God put a guard for the
[4:26] throne of God. And now you're going to
[4:28] see this all throughout the rest of the
[4:31] history. God always has guards around
[4:34] his throne.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; When you see those rich people, what do
[4:36] they got? Bodyguards.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; What What does the president got?
[4:40] Bodyguards,
[4:41] &gt;&gt; right? What do you got? Bodyguard. Amen.
[4:44] The angel of the Lord and camps around
[4:46] those that fear God. Hallelujah.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; When I send Malachi off in the morning,
[4:50] I say, "Lord Jesus, let your angels be
[4:51] around him." Right? Protect him. That's
[4:53] hard for me. It's my son leaving. You
[4:55] know, he's leaving off in a full-time
[4:57] job. And so I said, "Lord, let your
[4:59] guards be on him." Hallelujah. Just like
[5:01] my mom did for me. She sent me off to
[5:03] Aker and dropped me off and let the
[5:05] angels of God protect him. They have.
[5:06] Hallelujah. Thank God. The angel of the
[5:09] Lord. But after sin, you know, God still
[5:12] would meet with individuals. He met with
[5:13] Cain in Genesis 4. He met with Noah in
[5:16] Genesis 6. Uh God came down in Melzdc
[5:18] and met with Abraham in Genesis 14. God
[5:22] met with Abraham in a vision. in Genesis
[5:24] 15 in a flesh body. In uh Genesis 18, he
[5:29] appeared to Isaac. In Genesis 26, he
[5:31] appeared to Jacob in a latter dream. In
[5:33] Genesis 28, and then God wrestled with
[5:37] uh Jacob in a theophony form.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry. It would have been a
[5:42] Theophony covered with flesh. Sorry.
[5:43] Yeah. Would have been a Theophony
[5:44] covered with flesh. Kind of like uh kind
[5:46] of kind of like Melzdc.
[5:49] Uh and God let Jacob prevail.
[5:51] Hallelujah.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's Genesis 32. And
[5:54] then God appeared to Jacob again in
[5:56] Genesis 35
[5:58] when he came back to the promised land.
[6:00] Hallelujah. And then church, uh, the one
[6:03] you're familiar with, and I wish some of
[6:06] our younger believers were here tonight,
[6:07] but that's okay. They can, uh, hopefully
[6:08] catch us later. And then we, as our text
[6:11] read in Exodus 32, uh, 25, God desires
[6:16] to dwell with his people. And God said,
[6:18] I'm going to dwell in one place. I'm
[6:20] going to dwell right upon this lid here
[6:22] called the mercy seat.
[6:25] Now, that word the the English word for
[6:27] the Hebrew word is propitiation.
[6:31] That's the same word. That's where we
[6:32] get the word propituation from. The
[6:34] Hebrew word mercy seat.
[6:37] Right? So, what's the propitiation?
[6:38] That's where the blood was poured out,
[6:40] right? That it means taking the wrath
[6:42] away.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; So, Jesus was our propituation. Jesus
[6:46] suffered the wrath so we could be
[6:48] forgiven and saved. Hallelujah. Amen.
[6:50] The good news of the gospel. Hallelujah.
[6:54] And God said, "I'll meet with you there,
[6:56] Moses. I met I met I'll meet with Aaron
[6:58] there as well." When Aaron would go in
[7:00] once a year, hallelujah.
[7:03] And so, this is now God's throne on
[7:06] earth. Hallelujah. Makes sense. Uh
[7:08] here's another uh illustration. I like
[7:11] the other one better, you know, but it's
[7:12] a good Well, at least we get the blood
[7:13] here. We get the picture of the blood,
[7:14] right? He would dip the blood and
[7:15] sprinkle the blood. Remember, seven
[7:17] times before the door and then he take
[7:18] he would put blood on all the horns of
[7:20] of the brazen altar and then altar of
[7:22] incense and all the wind. He take it all
[7:24] the way. The blood had to be in all
[7:25] three courts. Amen.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, the Holy Ghost has got
[7:28] to be on all three phases of your life.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul. Hallelujah. The life
[7:34] of God. But now look, these cherubams
[7:37] here are throne guards. So God is again
[7:40] showing what he does. He always guards
[7:43] his presence.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; Right? So here the throne guards
[7:48] guarding the presence of God. Now God
[7:50] doesn't need guards,
[7:52] &gt;&gt; but he still has them because it
[7:55] represents power and authority, but we
[7:58] need guards. Hallelujah.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy. Hallelujah. To
[8:02] guard us. Now, if you trace the ark down
[8:06] through the Bible,
[8:08] and if you got your Bibles, go to
[8:09] Jeremiah 3:16.
[8:11] Malachi, can you get it? You got your
[8:12] Bible there?
[8:15] Maybe you can read it, Malachi.
[8:17] Um, if you trace the Ark of the Covenant
[8:20] through the kings, right, you know, it
[8:22] was with Moses before the kings, right?
[8:24] Uh, and then it was with Joshua. Joshua
[8:26] carried it into battle. Praise God. He
[8:28] carried it. He used it to cross the
[8:30] Jordan River, which had been overthrown.
[8:33] And then in the days of Judges, they had
[8:36] the ark of the covenant, right? It was
[8:37] at Shiloh in Judges 20:27. And then the
[8:41] days of Eli the priest and Samuel the
[8:43] prophet. It was in Shiloh. Then it went
[8:46] to Phil Filistia, right? Philistia,
[8:48] sorry. And then it went after after it
[8:51] tortured them, right?
[8:52] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God will always torture
[8:54] sinners. I shouldn't say torture, but
[8:56] chasing them, right? Rebuke them. Then
[8:58] it went to uh Kirjath Jereim and it
[9:01] blessed that man. Hallelujah.
[9:04] And then David brought it up.
[9:06] Hallelujah. To the house. I'm sorry.
[9:08] David brought it up uh not to it was to
[9:11] uh Mariah. I'm sorry. I got my I forgot
[9:13] my Zion and Mariah. David brought it up
[9:16] to Mariah and he danced before the ark.
[9:18] Praise God. Amen. Glory to God.
[9:21] Hallelujah. And then Solomon placed it
[9:23] in the temple that he built, this
[9:25] magnificent, beautiful temple in First
[9:27] Kings chapter 8. And then it was with
[9:29] all the kings. The last king it's
[9:32] recorded with is Josiah in 2 Chronicles
[9:35] 35:E5.
[9:37] It's the sec. It's the last mention of
[9:39] the ark with the king. Now, there's all
[9:41] kind children, just so, you know,
[9:42] there's all kinds of people say they
[9:44] found the ark. Well, let's prove it.
[9:45] Nobody's been able to prove it yet.
[9:48] Okay? And church, don't worry. And
[9:50] children, don't worry about finding the
[9:51] physical ark. Just make sure you're the
[9:53] spiritual ark of God.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Just make sure this is your heart. Okay?
[9:58] &gt;&gt; What's the next one I got? Okay. Yeah.
[10:03] So, again, we can see the the the setup
[10:05] here of Moses's. Of course, this turned
[10:07] into Solomon's temple and so forth. Then
[10:09] Zerubbabel's temple. Hallelujah.
[10:13] Uh but the last mention is with Josiah,
[10:16] one of the final uh few kings of Judah
[10:19] before all Israel was dispersed. It's
[10:21] the last mention. Okay. Now, Malachi is
[10:24] going to read. I want you to listen to
[10:25] Jeremiah 3:16. It's a beautiful verse
[10:27] here. Go ahead, Malachi.
[10:42] Amen. So Jeremiah prophesies that
[10:46] there's going to come a time when they
[10:47] don't even think about the ark. When is
[10:48] that? When is Israel not going to think
[10:50] about the ark, church? After they
[10:52] receive Christ. After the 144,000 are
[10:55] sealed, right? And after the millennium
[10:58] starts. They're not going to need an ark
[10:59] because they got the presence of God
[11:01] already. They have the body of Jesus
[11:03] Christ. Amen. Hallelujah.
[11:06] All right. Now, what I got next? Okay.
[11:08] Now, this was just for the the newcomers
[11:09] like brother Chris and so forth. Uh
[11:13] we'll just get into that in a little
[11:14] bit, I guess, with the How many How many
[11:16] How many remember that picture? Remember
[11:17] that picture?
[11:18] &gt;&gt; So, the the tribes were placed in groups
[11:21] of three on four sides. It makes a
[11:23] cross. Hallelujah. So, when God looked
[11:25] down from heaven, he saw a cross.
[11:27] Hallelujah.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; The only way my people my people should
[11:30] live in a cross we should stay connected
[11:32] to the cross of Jesus Christ, right?
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then each of those uh
[11:37] four groups had a banner, right? And uh
[11:41] the banners were uh these four there was
[11:44] lion, ox, flying eagle, and a man. Okay,
[11:48] they each had their uh each had their
[11:51] representative, right? Okay.
[11:55] Now, let's see where we at next. Okay,
[11:56] now we get in the New Testament. Okay.
[11:58] So, uh,
[12:00] before I get to that, now let's
[12:01] transition to the New Testament. I
[12:03] didn't get a time, but I I could have
[12:04] put a picture of the body of Jesus up
[12:06] here because Jesus was the next throne
[12:09] of God, right? The Bible said in
[12:12] Colossians 2:9 that in Jesus dwelt the
[12:15] fullness of the Godhead body. Let's all
[12:18] say fullness, can we? Fullness.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; So, all of God's power, all of God's
[12:22] authority dwelt in the body of Jesus. It
[12:24] dwelt there. Remember the Bible said in
[12:26] John chapter 1, what did the Bible say?
[12:28] The spirit descended and then what?
[12:30] Remain. That's a let's all say remain.
[12:33] Ready? Remain. So the spirit just didn't
[12:35] come down and leave. What did it do? It
[12:36] dwelled.
[12:38] So what what's what's the word dwelling
[12:40] again? Dwelling means seat. Dwelling
[12:43] means throne.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; So the spirit of God was enthroned in
[12:47] the body of Jesus.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, after Jesus died,
[12:52] resurrected, and ascended, what did he
[12:53] send down on the day of Pentecost?
[12:55] What'd he send down? The Holy Ghost, the
[12:57] spirit of God. And the spirit, did it
[13:00] leave the people or did it stay in them?
[13:02] &gt;&gt; It stayed. So now they have a permanent
[13:05] anointing. They didn't have it before,
[13:06] but now they got a permanent anointing
[13:08] in the New Testament in the soul.
[13:10] Hallelujah.
[13:12] And that's why the Bible says that now
[13:14] we are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[13:17] So, if we're a temple, we got to have a
[13:19] throne.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, you're familiar with
[13:23] that. I'm just going to read them. 1
[13:24] Corinthians 3:16 and 1 Corinthians 6:19
[13:27] both say, "Don't you know your body is
[13:30] the temple of the Holy Ghost?" That's
[13:31] why we sang the song tonight because I
[13:33] was praying and thinking about, well,
[13:34] what songs would fit right here. I
[13:36] thought holy, holy, holy would fit
[13:37] because that's what the four beasts say,
[13:38] right? That's what they say. Got the
[13:41] lion, ox, man, eagle. They say holy,
[13:43] holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[13:47] But now remember church uh the Holy
[13:49] Ghost is in your soul according to John
[13:51] 7 38-39 Colossians 1:26 and 28 speaks of
[13:56] Christ in you the hope of glory. Now
[13:59] that verse is very important uh because
[14:02] it says Christ is the glory right Christ
[14:05] in you the hope of glory
[14:08] and the Bible said that the Messiah's
[14:11] rest would be glorious. Okay let's read
[14:14] that. It's Isaiah 11 verse 10.
[14:17] Isaiah 11 verse 10.
[14:21] How am I doing on time? Okay, got about
[14:26] 25 minutes. Okay, really good. All
[14:27] right, doing good on time. Now, if you
[14:29] got it, let's read it out loud here. Uh,
[14:31] let's read Isaiah 11:10. Ready? 1 2 3.
[14:34] And in that day there shall be a root of
[14:37] Jesse, which shall stand for an end sign
[14:41] of the people. to it shall the Gentiles
[14:44] seek and his rest shall be
[14:47] &gt;&gt; glorious. The Gentiles are going to seek
[14:50] after the rest of the Messiah and it's
[14:52] going to be glorious. Christ in you the
[14:54] hope of
[14:55] &gt;&gt; glory and that's the mystery that the
[14:57] Gentiles needed. So do you see that?
[14:59] Gentiles and glory. You see that? Now go
[15:02] to Colossians 1. That's what Colossians
[15:03] 1 says. Gentiles and glory. Oh, it's
[15:06] beautiful.
[15:07] Uh, so the Bible uses these
[15:09] terminologies over and over again so we
[15:10] don't miss it, church. God doesn't want
[15:13] us to miss it. Colossians 1:26.
[15:18] Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians,
[15:19] Colossians. Okay, I thought I got it
[15:20] mixed up there.
[15:23] Okay, now let's look for Gentiles and
[15:25] let's look for glory.
[15:31] It's verse 27. To whom God would make
[15:33] known what is the riches of the glory.
[15:35] There's glory of this mystery among the
[15:37] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[15:40] of glory other so glory everybody see
[15:42] that Gentiles glory the Messiah was
[15:45] going to give a rest that was glorious.
[15:49] Amen. And church if you all know if if
[15:52] you've been born again your life now is
[15:54] so much more glorious than your sinful
[15:56] life that was a slave to sin.
[15:59] So you were you were enslaved in sin.
[16:01] And now if you're born again, now you've
[16:03] broken those chains and now you're free.
[16:05] And you should be able to say, "My life
[16:07] is a glorious life.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; My life is so much better." Right,
[16:11] sister Beatatrice? Amen.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Your life should be so much more
[16:16] glorious.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. It is, church. It is. I was
[16:24] looking at old pictures. They were clean
[16:25] out a little bit in the garage and I saw
[16:26] pictures of my wife in high school and
[16:27] pictures of me. I thought, "Oh, I did
[16:29] such foolish things. I've got a glorious
[16:32] life now by the grace of God." I ain't
[16:34] chasing after those things. I'm chasing
[16:36] after the heart of God. Amen.
[16:38] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Matthew
[16:41] 11:28-29,
[16:42] Jesus said, "I've come to you that I
[16:44] might give you rest to your souls." And
[16:47] then Hebrews 4 1-12 speaks of we must
[16:50] labor and be careful not to come short
[16:53] of entering into his rest.
[16:56] Hallelujah. His rest will be glorious.
[16:59] It'll be Christ in you, the hope of
[17:01] glory.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so clear. My a child could see
[17:05] it. Hallelujah.
[17:07] Okay. So, we have the baptism of the
[17:09] Holy Ghost. Now, I want to go over two
[17:12] words now that show how your soul is the
[17:16] throne of God. Okay. The first word is
[17:19] the word dwell. Let's say dwell. Ready?
[17:21] Dwell. So, God's dwelling place is the
[17:24] throne. Let me go back here. God's
[17:25] dwelling place was the ark, right? He
[17:27] would dwell. He said, 'I'll dwell with
[17:28] you there. First Kings 8:30
[17:32] says, "And hearken thou to the
[17:33] supplication of their thy servant and of
[17:36] thy people Israel, when they shall pray
[17:38] toward this place," speaking of the
[17:39] temple of God, "and hear thou in heaven
[17:42] thy dwelling place. And when thou
[17:45] hearest, forgive."
[17:48] So heaven is called God's dwelling
[17:50] place, right?
[17:51] The ark of the covenant is called his
[17:53] dwelling place or the meeting place.
[17:57] But now the Bible says your soul is the
[17:59] dwelling place of God.
[18:02] Ephesians 3:17
[18:05] that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
[18:08] faith.
[18:10] See that the word dwell, the word dwell
[18:12] is used for God's throne in heaven. It's
[18:14] used for the ark of the covenant. And
[18:16] it's used also for you and your soul.
[18:20] Hallelujah.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:26] Now, I actually forgot to get a a verse
[18:28] where it says the ark would be the
[18:29] dwelling place of God. Maybe I read that
[18:31] earlier. I can't remember. But you can
[18:33] clearly see how heaven's dwelling place.
[18:36] There has to be a throne there because
[18:37] it's God's dwelling place. He dwells in
[18:39] his throne. And then Christ dwells in us
[18:42] now. So now you're the temple of God.
[18:44] Your soul is the throne of God.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[18:50] Now, here's why people say, uh, I
[18:52] invited Jesus into my heart. Okay? Now,
[18:56] that's not that's not used a lot in the
[18:59] Bible. Okay? In fact, the word invite
[19:02] isn't even in the King James Bible as
[19:04] far as inviting Jesus into your heart.
[19:06] Where they get that is Revelation 3
[19:08] where Jesus said, "I'm I'm going to
[19:09] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[19:11] let me in," right? Doesn't use the word
[19:14] invite.
[19:16] But what do we do? We we welcome the
[19:18] spirit of God into our life.
[19:22] And so people put a few verses together
[19:24] and they say, "Do you want to invite
[19:26] Jesus in your heart?" But they forget
[19:28] the part about repenting.
[19:30] He's not I mean he's not going to come
[19:31] in and really have any impact unless you
[19:33] repent of your sins.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; So see how see how the ecumenical move
[19:39] and the evangelical churches, see how
[19:41] they throw out water baptism and they
[19:43] just make a oh just let Jesus come into
[19:45] your heart. Well, he's not going to come
[19:46] into a dirty heart.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[19:52] All right. So, I'll read Galatians 4:6.
[19:55] Now, listen here. And because ye are
[19:57] sons, brother said, this is the
[19:58] triumphal capstone of the baptism of the
[20:00] Holy Ghost. You get the Holy Ghost
[20:02] because you're predestinated to get the
[20:04] Holy Ghost. Well, I said something
[20:06] there. Praise God. Amen. God has sent
[20:09] forth the spirit of his son into your
[20:11] hearts. Let's say hearts. Ready? Hearts.
[20:14] crying aba father. So see if we put
[20:17] these two verses together he dwells in
[20:19] your heart by faith and he sent his
[20:21] spirit into your heart.
[20:24] So that's why brother Ram says uh the
[20:26] throne of God now is your heart. But
[20:30] isn't his throne still up in heaven?
[20:31] Yes. Of course he's got more than one
[20:35] throne. And the church said okay and the
[20:37] church said
[20:38] &gt;&gt; he's got more than one throne.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[20:42] I I don't know. I don't want I don't
[20:43] want to do that too much. I just thought
[20:45] it was nice of Jen. Jen made this last
[20:47] time Brother Digs was here in May. So
[20:50] May, June, it took three months for us
[20:51] to get it here. So that that's because
[20:53] we had a baby. Okay.
[20:56] Okay. So see, God dwells in heaven. He
[20:58] also now dwells in you. What a privilege
[21:01] that God dwells in us. The next one is
[21:04] rule. Now let's all read Psalm 103:19.
[21:07] If you got your Bible, go there. Psalm
[21:08] 103:19. Let's read it together. There I
[21:10] want I want to hear your voices if you
[21:12] can.
[21:14] Psalm 103:19.
[21:19] This verse is beautiful. Now I want to
[21:20] look at the word rule. So we looked at
[21:23] the word dwell. God dwells in heaven.
[21:25] Now look, God rules from heaven.
[21:28] And then we're look at New Testament
[21:30] rule.
[21:32] Proving that God rules in you as well.
[21:35] That means you're God's throne. Now,
[21:38] okay. Now, is that is that too
[21:40] difficult? Is that too deep for anybody?
[21:42] Okay, Caris, she's got she's 11, right?
[21:44] Virtue, are you Nature? Are you 11? 10.
[21:47] If a 10-year-old can get it, uh, can you
[21:49] get it, Victoria? All right. You're the
[21:52] God sits on the throne of your soul now.
[21:54] Virtue, you got it. Eden, you got it.
[21:57] Everybody tap right here and say, "This
[21:58] is God's throne." Ready? This is God's.
[22:01] See, this is God's throne now. God
[22:03] dwells here. And he also rules in here,
[22:06] too.
[22:07] That means he sends out commands, right?
[22:09] He tells you to read your Bible, doesn't
[22:11] he?
[22:12] &gt;&gt; He tells you to pray every day.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Okay, very good. Let's read it. Psalm
[22:18] 103 verse 19. 1 2 3. The Lord hath
[22:21] prepared his throne in the heavens, and
[22:24] his kingdom ruleth over all. Okay. So
[22:28] the throne is where the kingdom is and
[22:32] the throne from the throne comes all the
[22:34] rules.
[22:36] Hallelujah.
[22:38] All right. Now, Colossians 3:15. And let
[22:41] the peace of God what? Rule in your
[22:44] what? Heart.
[22:47] So, see, the kingdom of God, uh, I'm
[22:50] sorry, the spirit of God is going to
[22:52] rule in your heart. So, not only do you
[22:54] have a throne, a place where God can
[22:56] sit, but from that place in your soul,
[22:59] God sends out his peace if you'll let it
[23:01] come out.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Right? Got to let the peace of God have
[23:06] rulership over your life. Okay?
[23:10] And then Jesus says in Luke 17, now I
[23:12] didn't get the verse on that one, so let
[23:13] me go look that up. Luke 17, I think
[23:15] it's uh 13. It's right around there
[23:19] where he says something else is inside
[23:21] of you. Oh, no. It's uh 21. Sorry, I was
[23:24] way off. Luke 17:21. Neither shall they
[23:26] say low here or low there. For behold,
[23:29] the kingdom of God is where? Within you.
[23:34] Everybody said,
[23:35] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Isn't that awesome? God's throne is in
[23:38] you. God's kingdom is in each one of us.
[23:41] Hallelujah.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; He rules there. I'm so happy. Sometimes
[23:44] I wonder why I laugh so much. I'm just
[23:45] so happy. Praise God. That God would
[23:47] rule in a sinner like me. But now I'm a
[23:49] sinner turned into a saint. Praise God.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a sinner saved by grace.
[23:55] Hallelujah. And now I live separated
[23:57] from the world, my past life. So I'm a
[23:59] saint. I'm a sinner saint. I'm a sinner
[24:02] saved by grace. That's another way to
[24:03] say it.
[24:05] So, see, God dwells in your heart,
[24:07] right? And he rules in your heart.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a blessing.
[24:15] I'll just read this one now. Um, if you
[24:17] got 2 Corinthians 6.
[24:23] Now, this is a good marriage text uh
[24:26] Paul's using in verse 14. Don't be
[24:28] unequally yolked with unbelievers. Now,
[24:30] Corinthians had a big problem with that,
[24:32] right? We saw it. They would go to the
[24:34] uh remember they would go eat inside the
[24:37] the I don't know what to call them
[24:39] today, like we'd say the bars, uh the
[24:41] houses of idolatry. They would eat in
[24:43] there. And Paul's got to say, "No, you
[24:44] got to come out of there, actually."
[24:46] Okay. Now, go down to verse 16. 2
[24:48] Corinthians 6:16. I want you to see
[24:50] this. This is very beautiful.
[24:53] And what agreement hath the temple of
[24:55] God with idols? For ye are the temple of
[24:57] the living God. As God has said, I will
[25:00] what? What's that word? Dwell in them
[25:03] and walk in them. See, church, did you
[25:06] understand God walked with you into
[25:08] church today?
[25:10] &gt;&gt; If he's in your spirit, if he's in your
[25:11] mind, if he's in your soul, God came to
[25:14] church today. That's man say that God,
[25:16] you brought God to church today, right?
[25:18] But it's really God leading you to
[25:19] church tonight,
[25:21] &gt;&gt; right? But God's walking in you. Praise
[25:24] God. God's walking in me. God's walk in
[25:26] each one of us because God dwells in us,
[25:31] &gt;&gt; right? And I will be their God and they
[25:33] shall be my people. Wherefore come out
[25:35] from among them and be ye separate,
[25:37] sayeth the Lord. Touch not the unclean
[25:39] thing and I will receive you. Right?
[25:42] Stop going to those uh restaurants or
[25:44] those houses of idolatry, eating their
[25:47] uh their meat that sacrificed to idols
[25:50] and there's prostitution there. and for
[25:52] us to be the uh all the basketball
[25:54] football games and the uh all the rock
[25:56] and roll music going on in those
[25:58] restaurants, right? Stay out of there.
[25:59] Be separate, sayeth the Lord.
[26:02] And verse 18, I love this. And what will
[26:04] God be for you? God will be your father
[26:07] unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
[26:09] daughters, sayaeth the Lord Almighty.
[26:13] See church, when we separate ourselves,
[26:14] when we say we don't want we don't want
[26:17] to live for the world anymore, we don't
[26:18] want to hang around with Satan's
[26:19] children. When we physically separate
[26:22] from them, that's when we really become
[26:24] the children of God.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; God's now walking in us.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, let me uh talk to
[26:30] nature here and these girls at the
[26:32] public school. Now,
[26:35] when you go back to school here next
[26:37] month, when you walk, let's say there's
[26:39] a group of people teasing, right? when
[26:41] you walk up and try to stand up for
[26:42] somebody, that's God walking in in you.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Or if some of the kids are look and
[26:47] showing dirty videos in between the im
[26:50] in between the classes and you walk
[26:52] away, that's God walking away in you.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:57] Girls, you got that? And same thing for
[27:00] our girls in our home school, right? If
[27:03] two if two of your sisters or your
[27:05] brothers are arguing and you start
[27:06] arguing with them, that was the wrong
[27:08] choice. You need to be a peacemaker,
[27:11] girls. Right?
[27:12] &gt;&gt; And where's my son Zion? Where's he at?
[27:14] He's sleeping. Okay. He's getting a good
[27:16] rest back there. His rest will be
[27:18] glorious.
[27:21] Would you understand that, girls?
[27:24] Somebody asks you to help out, you say,
[27:25] "Oh, sure. I'll sweep and help out,
[27:27] too." Right, girls? Not like that's your
[27:30] job. Well, what if somebody needs help?
[27:32] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to my girls, but it works
[27:34] for everybody.
[27:36] That's God. When you help out the family
[27:39] children, listen, that's God in you.
[27:41] God's walking in you,
[27:44] right? When you separate yourself, I'm
[27:46] not going to watch those things. I'm not
[27:48] going to partake of those jokes. I'm not
[27:50] going to be hang out with those people.
[27:51] Especially nature's getting in middle
[27:52] school. When when you physically walk
[27:54] away from the nature, that's God in you
[27:56] walking away.
[27:58] And shame on me because I couldn't do it
[28:00] when I was in middle school, but you
[28:01] can.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; See you, sister Nature. I'm I'm just
[28:06] talking to you now. You can live higher
[28:08] than brother Jesse when I was in middle
[28:10] school. Hallelujah.
[28:13] That'd be a great That'd be a great
[28:14] victory in the love divine. All right.
[28:18] Virtue is going to be there pretty soon.
[28:19] And then Eden, you know, see how that
[28:21] goes. Well, maybe they'll be
[28:22] homeschooled soon.
[28:24] We're praying.
[28:28] Now, I want you to see that. Now, the
[28:31] other one here. Uh,
[28:34] yes. And And now, let me go this. Go to
[28:36] Revelation 22:17. Revelation 22:17.
[28:42] I'm down to about 12 minutes. Okay.
[28:43] How's this gonna happen? All right.
[28:44] We'll see.
[28:46] I got to do it. I prom I didn't promise,
[28:48] but I said I'm going to do it. I got to
[28:50] keep my own rules. Now, now I want you
[28:53] to see this girls and even our adults.
[28:54] Now, here too. Revelation 22:17. Let's
[28:58] read together. Ready? One, two, three.
[29:00] and the spirit and the bride say come.
[29:04] And let him that heareth say come. And
[29:08] let him that is a thirst come. And
[29:11] whosoever will let him take the water of
[29:15] life freely. Now listen children,
[29:17] everybody. Everybody point to your soul.
[29:19] Point to your soul. Point to your heart.
[29:21] God lives in there if you're born again.
[29:23] And even if you're not born again, he
[29:25] lives up here as well, right? Because as
[29:27] soon as you repent, his anointing comes
[29:29] back here. But now listen, anytime not
[29:31] Eden virtue and the nature and then my
[29:33] girls, anytime you invite somebody to
[29:35] church like Charlie or anytime you
[29:37] invite anytime you encourage somebody,
[29:39] hey come to church or hey come let's
[29:40] read our Bible together at lunchtime.
[29:44] Anytime you invite somebody to have some
[29:47] time with God, God is speaking through
[29:49] you because God sits on the throne of
[29:51] your heart.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; You hear me?
[29:54] It's God. Because what the spirit and
[29:55] the bride say come
[29:57] &gt;&gt; when you invite people to church or hey
[29:59] let's read our Bible. Hey let's start a
[30:01] Bible club. Maybe you could do that
[30:02] nature. I don't know why I'm talking to
[30:03] you so much tonight.
[30:05] But I started a Bible club. And what
[30:07] when I when I invite kids to Bible club
[30:09] it's God speaking from his throne.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; God speaking from his throne tonight to
[30:14] you as well through me.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; That's what I got to that's my life.
[30:20] That's what preachers are to do. They're
[30:22] just to let God speak. And that proves
[30:24] it. If God's dwells in you by faith, if
[30:27] God sent a spirit to dwell in your
[30:28] hearts, and then if you speak God's
[30:30] word, now God speaking off of his throne
[30:32] to somebody else, and he's using your
[30:35] lips to do it.
[30:39] That ought encourage us adults to try to
[30:40] invite somebody to church
[30:43] like Beatatric did. Let's give her two
[30:45] claps. Brother Gary, you should come to
[30:48] church. Brother Gary,
[30:50] that's God in Beatatrice.
[30:53] Everybody, everybody catch that. God
[30:55] spoke through her.
[30:57] God spoke off the throne of her soul and
[31:00] said, "Why don't you come?"
[31:04] Everybody understand that?
[31:07] That That's the right word.
[31:12] I'm just trying to make it simple
[31:13] tonight, right? It's it's a beautiful
[31:15] thought. This brother from Minnesota
[31:17] said, "Could you make a video? I think
[31:18] people might help people." Is it helping
[31:19] somebody tonight? Here. Now, the
[31:21] heavenly throne. Now, here I want to
[31:23] show show some more visuals. I think I
[31:24] already passed him. Yeah. Here we go.
[31:28] Can I zoom in? Oh, it won't let me zoom
[31:30] in. Come on.
[31:32] Okay. Okay. So, this is where brother
[31:35] Brandham got this thought. He got it
[31:36] from Clarence Lin. Okay. The tabernacle
[31:40] of man. You have three parts, right?
[31:44] body, spirit, soul. God dwells in the
[31:48] soul.
[31:51] Moses's earthly tabernacle had three
[31:53] parts. Let's say outer court. Ready?
[31:54] Outer court.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Let's say holy place. Holy place. Let's
[31:57] say the most holy place. Ready? Most
[31:59] holy place. And now heaven is just like
[32:03] Moses's
[32:05] because Moses saw a vision of heaven and
[32:07] then he made uh he made the earthly
[32:10] tabernacle based upon the heavenly
[32:11] tabernacle.
[32:13] Okay?
[32:15] So there's an outer court in heaven.
[32:17] There's a holy place in heaven. There's
[32:19] a most holy place in heaven. Now
[32:21] everybody listen. Everybody watch this
[32:22] one now. Watch this one. This is the
[32:25] heavenly one. Sometimes you girls ask me
[32:28] where are the foolish virgin? Right?
[32:29] They're right here by the sacrificial
[32:31] altar.
[32:34] And the Jews are right here, right?
[32:37] They're right there. The Jews are the
[32:38] souls under the altar crying, "How long,
[32:41] Lord? Holy and true? Dust thou not judge
[32:44] and avenge our blood upon the earth?"
[32:47] That's what the Bible says. They're
[32:48] under the altar. Okay? Then you got the
[32:51] sea of glass. Now, there it just it's a
[32:52] beautiful uh it's a beautiful just
[32:54] waters, right? And then the Bible said
[32:56] there's a veil. So there's some type of
[32:59] a veil before the holy place. In the
[33:01] holy place, you have the golden altar of
[33:02] incense where the prayers of the saints
[33:04] are. You have seven lamps burning with
[33:07] fire before the throne of God.
[33:10] And you have the uh four and 20 elders.
[33:13] You have 24 thrones. Now, they're not in
[33:14] the picture here. Okay?
[33:18] This is the heavenly throne. And then
[33:20] you break past the second veil. The
[33:22] Bible said there's two veils. Veil
[33:24] before the holy place, a veil before the
[33:25] holiest of all. Then when you get in
[33:27] here, now you have four throne guards
[33:32] and you have God's throne. You have a
[33:34] rainbow round about the throne and you
[33:36] have lightnings and thunderings and
[33:38] smoke coming out of the throne of God
[33:39] and Jesus's body sits on the throne. All
[33:43] right, everybody got that? Okay.
[33:47] And church, the Bible says, remember the
[33:49] Bible says that in Hebrews 6:19, which
[33:53] hope we have as an anchor for the soul,
[33:56] both sure and steady. Everybody look up
[33:58] here. Your prayers don't go here. They
[34:00] don't go here. Although that's the place
[34:03] for heavenly prayers where they're
[34:04] stored. But your prayers, the Bible said
[34:06] your hope goes here into the very throne
[34:08] of God.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Your hope enters the veil where Jesus
[34:14] is. Hallelujah.
[34:17] Don't think don't think God doesn't hear
[34:19] your prayers. God hears your prayers.
[34:21] Your hope goes into the veil.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; And then church, remember Jesus is there
[34:28] not for his sake.
[34:31] He's there for your sake.
[34:34] Hebrews 9:24, "For Christ is not entered
[34:37] in the holy places made with hands,
[34:39] which are the figures of the truth, but
[34:41] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[34:43] prince of God for us." Let's all say us.
[34:47] Ready? Us. He's there. Victoria, he's
[34:50] there for you. Beatatric, he's there for
[34:53] you tonight.
[34:54] Kesha, he's there for you.
[34:57] He's there in the presence of God for
[35:00] your prayer requests.
[35:03] Hallelujah.
[35:05] All right.
[35:08] Now,
[35:11] the temple stays there. Now, here, let
[35:13] me uh click off here.
[35:18] I'm almost done.
[35:20] I better be done soon.
[35:23] So, here's another picture. You got the
[35:24] 4 and 20 elders. You got all these
[35:26] angels. The Bible said multitudes of
[35:28] angels. You have the four beasts,
[35:29] rainbow round about the throne, white
[35:31] throne. Oh, yeah. There's the seven
[35:32] lamps of fire, seven spirits of God.
[35:35] Okay? And now notice these cherubam are
[35:37] what? The throne guards. God always
[35:40] guards his throne.
[35:42] Okay? Now,
[35:45] during the millennium, now here's what I
[35:46] didn't get to. During the millennium,
[35:48] there will be a throne in the millennial
[35:50] temple that Jesus Christ will sit on,
[35:52] and he'll judge all nations with a rod
[35:54] of iron.
[35:56] So in the millennium, there'll be a
[35:57] throne on earth for Jesus in Jerusalem.
[36:00] And there'll still be a throne in
[36:01] heaven.
[36:03] But when the future home, when the new
[36:05] Jerusalem comes down, now the heavenly
[36:07] throne of God comes down to earth.
[36:11] So now there won't be a heavenly throne.
[36:14] Now the heavenly throne marries and
[36:16] unites with the earth. Praise God.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Revelation 21:22 says, "And I saw no
[36:23] temple." Let's say no temple. Ready? no
[36:25] temple therein. For the Lord God
[36:27] Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of
[36:30] it.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's gonna there's not
[36:33] going to be any new building where we
[36:34] got to go to in the future home because
[36:36] the Bible said, "The Lamb and the Lord
[36:38] God are the temple thereof."
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelation 22 verse one. And
[36:45] he showed me a pure river of water of
[36:47] life, clear as crystal, proceeding out
[36:49] of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
[36:54] It's at the very top of that pyramid
[36:56] city is a throne. Hallelujah. And a
[36:59] river of life flows out of it by God's
[37:02] grace. Now, I didn't have time to put
[37:04] those pictures on. In the past, I did.
[37:07] Hallelujah. So, the final temple,
[37:10] church, is the body of Jesus Christ.
[37:13] There's not going to be a building we
[37:14] walk into in the future home. It's just
[37:16] going to be the body of Jesus. That's
[37:18] the temple. But that body is going to
[37:21] have a throne as well. Hallelujah.
[37:24] And so church, what does it become? It's
[37:26] got you got one throne and all these
[37:28] other believers are thrown. So God has
[37:30] one throne and then he's got millions of
[37:32] other thrones.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; God ruling every believer.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; So it's God in control, God dwelling,
[37:41] God reigning in every single believer.
[37:43] Oh, isn't it so wonderful to know that
[37:46] God will dwell in you for all eternity?
[37:48] Praise God. If you're born again, you've
[37:50] already got God dwelling. You have a a
[37:52] down payment, an earnest payment that
[37:54] God will always dwell permanently for
[37:57] all eternity. Your soul will be the
[37:59] throne of God forever, for now and
[38:01] forever more. Praise God.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got two minutes.
[38:08] If I'm going to keep my word, I'm gonna
[38:12] I'm gonna keep my word.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; So, I'm closing with two. There's two
[38:18] revelations from the throne of God.
[38:20] Okay, there's two revelations from this.
[38:23] The first revelation is that these four
[38:26] beasts are also four anointings
[38:28] throughout the church ages. Brother Ram
[38:30] said that's thus sayeth the Lord.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; God sent the lion. That's the boldness
[38:35] of the early apostles. Then God sent the
[38:38] spirit of the ox for all those million
[38:40] 68 million martyrs. That was just what
[38:42] was recorded during the times of the
[38:44] early church down to the dark ages. And
[38:46] then God sent the wisdom of man in the
[38:48] 1500s with uh uh Martin Luther and John
[38:51] Wesley. And then God sends an eagle. God
[38:54] sends a prophetic anointing at the end
[38:56] time so we can understand thus sayeth
[38:58] the Lord. We can understand the Bible
[39:00] and especially the book of Revelation in
[39:03] Daniel. Praise God.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel. Thus sayeth the Lord.
[39:10] Now who remembers that last that last
[39:12] revelation the second anointing?
[39:14] Brother said those four beasts and the
[39:16] throne of God represent the four gospels
[39:20] protecting the book of acts. How many
[39:22] remember that?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Brother gives us an example. So this
[39:26] represents the throne of God and these
[39:28] four gospels represent the four throne
[39:30] guards.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:35] So God, brother Ram said God always
[39:36] protects his his presence and God's
[39:39] presence is salvation and water baptism
[39:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:43] But the rabb said God protects that
[39:45] revelation with his four throne guards.
[39:48] Hallelujah. Praise God. Because in
[39:50] Matthew, the name of the son is Jesus.
[39:52] And he said, "Baptize in one name to the
[39:54] father, son, and holy ghost." And then
[39:56] in Mark, he said, "He that believeth and
[39:58] is baptized shall be saved."
[40:00] &gt;&gt; And then in Luke, he said, "Repentance
[40:03] and remission of sins should be preached
[40:05] in his name." One name. Praise God.
[40:09] And then the Bible said, "John went down
[40:10] into the water because there was much
[40:13] water there." So it shows we don't
[40:14] sprinkle. We're going to baptize
[40:16] Genevieve, not sprinkle her. Praise God.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; So see our revelation, the prince of God
[40:22] that accompanies people that get saved
[40:24] and baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[40:26] Christ, it's protected by throne guards.
[40:29] God always protects his throne.
[40:31] Hallelujah.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; I'm already at 7:46, so this is my last
[40:35] minute. I'm going to go two minutes
[40:36] over. Brother Ram gives us a second
[40:38] example. Then he closes that sermon.
[40:40] It's from uh January 1961.
[40:43] Brother Bram said, "All of God's
[40:44] revelations are protected. Everything in
[40:47] the book of Acts is protected by the
[40:49] Gospels." In other words, there's no
[40:51] contradictions. There's no changes.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; So divine healing is taught. Jesus sends
[40:59] out his the apostles with power to heal
[41:02] the sick, raise the dead, cast out
[41:04] demons.
[41:05] In Mark, the last thing Jesus says
[41:08] before he goes, he said, "These signs
[41:10] shall follow them that believe. They
[41:11] shall cast out devils. Uh if they take
[41:13] up a serpent, it shall not harm them.
[41:15] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[41:17] they shall
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Luke Luke is a repeat here where Jesus
[41:22] sends out his uh 12 apostles." And then
[41:25] in the good old book of St. John, Jesus
[41:27] said, "Greater works than these shall
[41:29] you do because I go to my father."
[41:32] Nobody can do a greater miracle than
[41:34] Jesus. It means we'll do more miracles
[41:37] because now the Holy Ghost is in
[41:38] millions or maybe even billions of
[41:40] Christians for the last 2,000 years.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "If my words abide
[41:46] in you and and they you abide in me,
[41:48] then you'll ask what you will and it
[41:50] shall be done."
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Let's give God
[41:52] a round of applause. Amen. Hallelujah.
[41:55] Musicians can come. I was two minutes
[41:58] over at 7:45. How many appreciate the
[42:01] word of God tonight?
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't believe I fit it in there.
[42:03] Praise God. But hallelujah. All glory to
[42:05] God tonight. Are you happy, Hund? Is
[42:07] that Was that okay? Was that pretty
[42:08] good? All right. Amen. Hallelujah. God
[42:11] is good. You know, this is a special
[42:12] time of our lives, you know, is was
[42:14] different, you know, with Malachi. So, I
[42:15] appreciate everybody having mercy. And
[42:18] we had to do the same thing with Austin.
[42:19] Remember when Austin first came back in
[42:20] 2021, we had to shorten our Wednesday
[42:22] night services so he could get some rest
[42:24] by God's grace. But how many love the
[42:26] Lord tonight?
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. With our heads bowed,
[42:31] let's just pray that we'll let the Lord
[42:34] rule from the throne of our hearts.
[42:38] Especially our children and our young
[42:40] people. You have to learn from a young
[42:43] age. Let God rule every decision,
[42:47] especially at home. Everybody acts good
[42:49] at church, right? I mean, I could look
[42:50] at all the young people. Praise God.
[42:52] Everybody acts nice and happy. But
[42:54] really, where you want God to rule is
[42:56] when you're at home.
[42:58] Praise God.
[43:01] If someone's being mean to you, show
[43:03] kindness to them. That's God speaking
[43:04] through you. That shows God's ruling on
[43:07] the throne of your heart.
[43:09] [Music]
[43:13] I can really see a change in Caris's
[43:15] life. Every time I ask Caris to do
[43:17] something, he's like, "Yes, Daddy. Uh,
[43:19] can you hold Tulsi?" "Yes, Daddy. Can
[43:21] you get that uh peanut butter for me?"
[43:22] "Yes, daddy." I can see a real change in
[43:25] her life. I can see she's letting God
[43:28] rule her life. I've seen Genevieve do
[43:31] that now.
[43:33] She never came up for prayer before, but
[43:35] when she got saved, when she cried, we I
[43:37] prayed with her, wept, cried. Now, she'd
[43:39] been coming up, and I don't even got to
[43:41] ask her to come up and pray.
[43:44] God's ruling on the throne of her heart.
[43:49] Hallelujah.
[43:51] That's what I want, church. I want God
[43:52] to dwell in my in my soul, right? And I
[43:55] want him to rule in my soul as well. How
[43:58] many want that tonight? Let's let's
[44:00] let's pray. Father God,
[44:04] this is such a beautiful thought. The
[44:05] brother, his name is Brother Russ shared
[44:07] with me. He said, "Why don't you do a
[44:08] teaching on that?" Lord, I could have
[44:11] went a lot lot longer, but Lord, I think
[44:12] we got the main point. Our soul is your
[44:16] throne, God. How privileged we are that
[44:18] you said, "I will walk in them. I will
[44:21] speak through them because they'll say
[44:23] what the spirit says when they invite
[44:25] people to church. When they invite
[44:27] people about baptism,
[44:30] come. You need to be born again. You
[44:32] should pray about being born again. You
[44:34] should hear this sermon by brother
[44:35] Brandham. You should hear this sermon by
[44:36] brother Diggs. Whenever church, oh God,
[44:39] whenever we invite people, Lord, to
[44:41] listen or have some interaction with
[44:43] God, Lord, it's God speaking through us.
[44:46] How simple it is. Thank you for sister
[44:48] Beatatrice letting Lord you speak
[44:51] through her.
[44:54] [Music]
[44:57] Bless her I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[45:00] Father I pray for especially the young
[45:02] people and even myself, all the adults
[45:03] here, Lord God. Lord, may we have a
[45:05] fresh devotion to let this peace of God
[45:08] rule our hearts tonight. May the kingdom
[45:10] of God that's within us, may it have
[45:12] full control that will say the right
[45:14] thing. We won't be snippy or impatient
[45:17] or angry, but we'll be humble and sweet.
[45:21] We'll be patient. We'll be obedient,
[45:22] Lord God. Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[45:26] Oh God, that will prove to others that
[45:29] you sit on the throne of our hearts, oh
[45:31] God, and that you're actually ruling our
[45:33] hearts. Lord, if we're honest, sometimes
[45:36] I feel like we push you off our throne
[45:38] and we try to take over. God, forgive
[45:40] us. That's especially in our minds. God,
[45:44] forgive us. Bible said we offend, grieve
[45:47] not, offend not the Holy Ghost, whereby
[45:49] we're sealed to the day of our
[45:50] redemption. Father, if we've done that
[45:52] today, forgive us, God, for kicking you
[45:55] off the throne of our our minds. We
[45:58] invite you back in. Forgive us for our
[46:00] evil thoughts. Let your spirit come back
[46:02] in our mind, Lord God, we pray. May
[46:05] everybody see that Christ dwells within
[46:07] me. Christ dwells within each and every
[46:09] person here tonight. Dwell in us. walk
[46:12] in us. Speak to us. May we be your sons
[46:15] and daughters. I pray, oh God, let my
[46:17] soul, God, be your throne that people
[46:20] will know he's a real son of God.
[46:24] Lord, we're never claiming perfection,
[46:26] God. But we want to be so yielded to you
[46:28] that the peace of God rules our hearts.
[46:30] The love of God rules our hearts. The
[46:32] joy of God rules our hearts. And people
[46:35] can see that your spirit has full
[46:38] control of our lives. Grant it, Lord
[46:40] Jesus.
[46:42] Bless your people tonight in Christ's
[46:45] name.
