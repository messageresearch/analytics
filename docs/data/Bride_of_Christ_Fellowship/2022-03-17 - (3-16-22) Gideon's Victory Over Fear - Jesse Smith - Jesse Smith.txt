the praise on our door in jesus christ's name the saint said amen let's take our bibles here tonight by god's grace let's go to judges chapter 6 i was just praying today and i thought i thought about you know last wednesday how we looked at fear and the thought of gideon came to my mind and how he battled fear so it's been eight years since i preached sean gideon so i pulled out an old sermon from a while ago and we'll see the inspiration that god gives me here by god's grace i'd like to just preach on gideon's victory over fear so judges chapter 6. judges chapter 6. huh now let's go to a verse about getting here let's read 11 and 12 if we can together judges 6 11 and 12. judges 6 11 and 12. thank you hon all right let's read this on through if we can ready one two three and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was in orpha that pertained unto joash the abby urzite and his son gideon threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites in verse 12 and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou almighty man of valor may god has blessings to being of his word you may be seated i just want to call this gideon's victory over fear we'll see how far we get with this and uh it's been years like i said since i preached this i was looking at the notes today and i trust to be a blessing you know everybody got nice feedback about last wednesday night service about overcoming fear and so again i just kind of felt led like maybe i like to look back at this here by god's grace so gideon's a great character in the bible the bible mentions him in actually hebrews 11. so let's go to hebrews 11. and we'll see how gideon is mentioned here in the scripture he's called a man of faith so hebrews 11 32 hebrews 11 32. sometimes if we could you know if we could have talked to gideon before all this happened and someone would ask him and said brother get in are you a man of faith he probably would not have said yes because remember we're going to revisit some of his history he probably would have maybe laughed at you or maybe maybe just got humble and cried or felt bad about it but before this uh calling that god placed upon his life he the bible says he was the least in his father's house right we kind of saw that remember when we looked at leah you know a couple years ago how she was the despised one she wasn't the pretty one she wasn't the one everybody liked you know rachel was the one everybody liked and i just love how god condescends and humbles himself he god brings himself down to we'd say the least esteemed and that's in the new testament church too the bible says let them judge in the church who are lease esteemed so we would we would steam preachers right we would esteem deacons and song leaders and you know they're voted upon they're the offices in the church but the bible says god has special grace and wisdom upon the least esteemed because they're the most humble now in most cases yes the pastor will judge things but paul's making a point that it's the humble people many times that god is directly speaking to many times they can be because they're humble they can be taught things they can recognize the presence of the lord their minds are meditating on the things of god not that the leaders aren't but we know it's true in a lot of churches if the leaders fall if leaders get distracted if the leaders make mistakes then the whole church goes that way right many times the whole church goes that way but yeah there could be still some believers there and we've all met them like people that have left churches that are struggling or left churches that were in sin there were still some spiritual people in there and they tried to help out the church but maybe they got to the point where the holy spirit told them you know it's really not going to turn around and it's time to move on but paul specifically says that let them judge who are least esteemed in the church so no doubt the least esteem would probably be children or sisters right just because of the setup of the bible the bible sets up god christ man woman right so just looking at god's order the least esteemed would probably be children and women but god says i've uh he's he's put the body together he's placed the body together in such a way that every joint supplies a need every person can be used by god in other words to help somebody else praise god in other words the prayers of our sisters are just as powerful as the prayers of the brothers amen and god honors our sisters in special ways god honors the children in special ways when they act upon the faith that they've received amen god does the same with our brothers but i like this thought here how gideon is least esteemed in his father's house he wasn't the the sibling where you say oh that he's a real warrior that guy's a real warrior he was kind of the the run of the family okay so in hebrews 11 32 the bible says and what shall i more say for time would fail me to tell of there's gideon and of barrick who came shortly after gideon and of samson and of jephthah and of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms and that's exactly what gideon did he took down kingdoms of armies praise god uh the bible says it was a number as a number of grasshoppers now we've many of us probably haven't seen that i don't think i have where a whole field has been full of grasshoppers and you see them jump around now we've seen what are those birds swarming around here we see them all the time was okay i always forget that we see the starlings flying around austin we see them there's that that's something similar to that you know the midianites were this awful country and they they swarmed like that we'd say they were swarming it was a major kingdom but how did getting overcome he overcome by faith and faith is an assurance praise god faith is a trust in god almighty and they worked righteousness they obtained promises stop the mouse of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness we're made strong now we ought to say amen to that praise god because now we can all see ourselves in this scripture or we can see hope for our futures amen no matter how weak we've been no matter how little we've been or no matter even how the great blessings god has blessed us when god still wants to use us god still takes weak people and makes them strong praise god and of course if god ever did anything great in you you realize well that wasn't you anyway so you ought to return to being weak again amen and consider yourself how weak you are praise god because it is only god who makes us strong the bible says be strong in the lord and the power of his might amen in ephesians chapter six by faith they were waxed valiant and fight now that valiant's very close to what uh gideon's called a man of valor a man of courage and bravery right and turn to flight the armies of the aliens now sisters you ought to say amen on 35 women receive their dead to raise the life again look god put sisters in there see god god's not partial amen god will use both male and female children young and old he'll use anybody who wants to honor him because the bible said god will honor him who honors god amen others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and we read this a few wednesdays ago as well and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings they were weak absolutely whipped beaten yay moreover a bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wondered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy amen think about that now just go now to john the baptist and herod my mind goes to that the world was not worthy though herod and herodias were not worthy of a man like john the baptist standing there rebuking them amen they weren't worthy of that yet herod observed him for a little while remember that he observed some of the things he said when it comes down to his marriage and divorce you know being an adulteress uh he didn't like that right and he let his wife talk him into ending john's life of course through deception but think about that they weren't worthy of that they weren't worthy of a man like john the baptist what about today praise god was all those denominations worthy of a man like brother branham that would bawl them out praise god he would take their gifts to them and manifest manifest his gifts to them were they worthy of that no of whom the world was not worthy praise god they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise now of course they were speaking of the resurrection promise right god having provided some better thing for us see that they without us should not be made perfect amen in other words perfection will come when all the saints depart me when all the saints are gathered together and the bible says it in ephesians chapter 1 when god brings all things together in jesus christ amen they all look for that they all look for the the body change they all look for the coming of the messiah they all look for the the end of all the trouble the end of all the strife they all look for that praise god but they could not be made perfect without us amen in other words god knew there was going to come more people that have faith praise god after gideon amen there's going to become more people that have faith after john the baptist praise god think about it there's going to come people that have more faith after brother branham in church you and i should place ourselves in there i'm one of them amen my faith might be small like a mustard seed but that's all i need amen is that right that's what jesus said if you have faith as the size of a mustard seed grain he said you can say to the mountain move and it'll move praise god so what does that mean what does that mean god asks when you have faith you have confidence in god you have assurance in god in other words god has made known his will to you praise god and so we see gideon at the end of hebrews 11 through faith he subdued kingdoms amen through faith he waxed valiant and fight because remember as the story goes on we hear about the sword of the lord but also the sword of gideon in other words in other words god is going to fight parts of your battles now some battles he may fight the whole thing but there's going to come a time where god's going to let you fight as well god's going to let you speak the word amen god's gonna let you uh quote the scripture praise god god is gonna let you take a stand on the word of god and you're gonna see the word of god be active in your life amen and then you're gonna know what it's like where the bible where jesus said speak to the mountain and you're going to speak to a problem and the problem is going to move amen but don't get puffed up just remember you got a powerful god that gave you that sword amen hallelujah that's where you get all the victories from now gideon is called a man of faith but back in judges chapter 6 we read verse 11 he was hiding from the midianites he was hiding he was threshing wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midnight so they normally didn't thresh wheat there they would thresh wheat in another place but he had to hide behind the wine press in order to not be seen by the midianites now church if you look earlier in the chapter the midianites would come every year at harvest time for seven years the midianites would come and they they would the israelites would be plowing or weeding they'd be taking care of their and every year they start hearing the sound of armies coming and then pretty soon the armies would surround their lands and they knew it was the midianites and the midianites would watch and the armies would watch them and wait until it was harvest time and when they saw the israelites going out to harvest they would rush in and they would take all the grain they would take all everything they worked for for four months five months six months seven months depending on the crop that you used they lost it for seven years in a row and the bible said they would take all their animals too what would you do all the animals all the bread all the wheat every all the barley so i don't know how they did they must have like uh had people travel to other countries to bring in and then start all over again that year for seven years in a row and the bible tells us why did this happen why did they get in such a spot where every year they were robbed my every year they lost all that they worked for see there's reason people can't get ahead in life and we've met them there's a reason some people can't get ahead it's because of disobedience in verse one the bible says that uh the lord delivered israel into minions hands for seven years and in verse two it said it was it emitting prevailed against israel because uh and then even israel they made dens in the mountains and caves and strongholds they were so afraid of the midnights they would go build houses in the mountains to hide out from them and they would try to take a little bit of their animals and they tried to go hide up there in the mountains so the midnights wouldn't come get em in other words they were in other words let me say this they were running from the problems amen how many how many you ever battle running from you don't raise your hand how many we all we all do i would say we all battle running from problems right we all like to avoid problems we all like to avoid the battles right but this was israel's fault it was it was their own fault they were bringing this robbing upon them amen they were bringing this loss upon them they knew better but they still continued to live in sin they still continue to disobey the word of god and so every year like a cycle this is the cycle you don't want to get in you're getting a cycle of blessing after blessing after blessing amen you want to labor and plant invest and then see the harvest praise god you want to plant plant plant harvest plant plant plant harvest but they were plant plant plant robbing plant plant plant losing plant plant plant loss everything it was it was awful fix to be in and the bible says they would come and encamp in verse 4 and then leave them nothing can you imagine look think think about your uh yourselves at home right now your fridge it's all it's full maybe half full maybe you got to get to the grocery you know how much maybe you can relate tonight to the israelites you know sometimes every now and then we get there and i gotta go hold up the whole cart it's almost overflowing with food you know thank god for uh thank god for the prosperity that we live with but every year for seven years they would see everything they sort up be robbed you imagine the imagine as a man brother austin imagine as a man they'll tie you up or whatever they did or the the you just watch all of everything you labored for for your wife and kids you were just tied up and maybe kicked around throwing the ground while those soldiers plundered your house seven years in a row seven's completion right this was complete and utter destruction this is completely utter embarrassment and so the bible said they got tired of it and they were really poor verse 6 says they were greatly impoverished so they were living in a life of poverty now look at verse eight i'm sorry verse seven so here's church what happens if you and i ever find ourselves in a cycle of loss or cycle of disobedience verse seven tells us what we must do amen there's always one answer amen the one answer is prayer of repentance amen there's always one answer that's why the bible said the way of holiness is so easy a fool won't miss it because everybody knows about i mean even the world talks about karma now we don't we don't use the word karma but we realize the laws of god if you sow good seeds you'll get a harvest if you sow bad seed you're going to reap a bad harvest right now the world and universalism and everything they pervert that but if there is a law of god if you work hard god's going to bless you amen if you invest in the kingdom of god he said i'll add all these things unto you if you seek first god kingdom he'll give you everything you have need of amen but look what it comes to pass after seven years of seeing this every year and poor dirt poor the bible said they finally they will every year they would cry unto the lord and now look at verse 8 i love this and when you cry on the lord what happens the word of the prophet comes to you hallelujah you cry out long enough god's going to send you the prophet hallelujah you really want truth god said i'm prophet now that that's brother simon's testimony austin have you seen it online i put simon's testimony on there simon and brother amen both had this testimony now simon he was fasted i think it was three months he would go in the prayer closet fast and say god sent me the truth he was in denomination assembly of god saying god i know there's more i know there's more so he fasted off and on for three months and that's when the message came to him god sent him the prophet the word of the prophet amen to the same thing he was telling me on his testimony there was we were recording that podcast that he was just wondering lord there's got to be more how come the people are you know crying out for god how come the people are obeying the word of god and what does god do god sends him to the the church that has the prophet amen see when you really cry to god god's going to send you a vindicated messenger amen and that's what he did in verse 8 and the lord sent a prophet and the children of israel which said unto the unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage now that was many many years ago let me go back to exodus 12. just to kind of get you a timeline here so god takes them back this is 14. almost uh almost 200 years god's saying you guys weren't always in bondage 200 years ago you were free see aren't you glad god remind us of our past mistakes but also our past victories amen he said i brought you out 200 years ago you were a free people amen you had houses stacked with food you had everything you need 200 years ago when you kept the word of god yeah look at verse 9 and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave you out or drave them out from before you and gave you their land now here it is right here why was this happening for seven years in a row verse 10 and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice so obedience disobedience caused this cycle of loss and defeat and poverty can i say it like this many people today might have a lot of riches but they're spiritually poor they don't know how to repent they don't know how to pray they don't know how to hear read the word of god right spiritually poor the bible says they're rich they're rich and increased with goods and happy to nothing they're poor blind miserable naked and don't even know it praise god so see we see the same thing today and what caused all this a disobedience see that's why the bible says church we we we went over it no manner without excuse that you have a conscience built into you where you know if you're doing right or wrong you know thank god we can know for do right amen hallelujah but they knew and they were disobeying now you're going to see later in gideon's dad why this is important god said you have not obeyed and so for seven years they just get poor and poor and poor and poor because they have not obeyed the voice of god so what was god what was god's answer to god help me god what was god's answer i'm sending you a prophet obey the word of god amen look at your past fathers look at your mothers amen look at your grandmothers look at your great great grandfathers look how they obey god look how i bless them and if you do the same thing i'll bless you amen that's all we gotta do church if we got problems in our lives look back to the word look back to the history look back to the bible did i miss something am i off the word have i sinned have i disobeyed the lord somewhere and if not then you know it's just a test of your faith and god wants to prove to the devil that you'll serve god no matter what trial comes your way amen that you have rock solid faith hallelujah now verse 12 the angel no i'm sorry before i move on um remember verse 10 the prophet said fear not their gods of these nations so see they they they were given over to false gods they were trusting in gods they say like this they were trusting the stock market can you understand what i'm saying they were trusting in their maybe mother-in-law their father-in-law they're trusting their jobs they're trusting the economy right they're trusting their husbands or their wives or something or their grandpa they're trusting in things other than god and disobeying the word of god they had idols in their life but god sends you a prophet to escape the idols of your life amen hallelujah we just sing that song that's why that song kind of came to my heart i was thinking about the idolatry we bow our hearts we bend our knees no lord we cast out our idols so anything that we'd exalt anything that we would pay too much attention to we want to cast it down thank you lydia i appreciate that so see that it ties in with the story very well don't fear the gods of the amorites in other words don't don't get caught up in the superstition don't get caught up into serving other gods you obey the word of god now verse 11. verse 12 the angel lord appears unto them and says the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor so this man has done nothing in seven years he's done nothing and god says you are a man of valor amen you can tell by their conversation though this man was meditating on the word of god because he has a very scriptural question right look at verse 13. what's the first words we get from gideon out of his lips oh my lord so there's lords he calls him lord if the lord be with us then why is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told of us saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and deliver us into the hands of the many knights now church perhaps gideon maybe didn't hear all that the prophet said or maybe he'd forgotten but the prophet said you did not obey the word of god that's why this is befalling you but he had a good question if god's with me if i'm a mighty man where are all the miracles and god was in other words god was saying where's all your obedience if you want to see a miracle obey the word of god amen hallelujah and as brother braham said the greatest miracle is for you to become a christian and then you become a miracle right because miracles do not save as far as some if someone raised from the dead that won't save somebody that won't save their soul what saves the soul is a repentance from sin and acceptance of faith in jesus christ then you pass from death unto life and that's the greatest miracle seeing a soul saved hallelujah glory amen thank god amen it is now verse 14 and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee so the angel says go in your might he says haven't i sent you look they've had they've had one they've they've exchanged one word one sentence they've exchanged one little conversation and he's already said i've sent you see god god when god speaks god expects you to listen but at the same time church god knows we're human and that's why i love the story of gideon god will work with you if you need more signs god will work with you praise god if you want to overcome fear if you want to overcome doubt if you want to overcome any obstacle if you want to get out of any trouble that you're in god will work with you if you really want it and god will make you a valiant man or woman praise god amen if you want to get out god will make a way for you to get out because god is going to use this lease in his family god is going to use the least esteemed the one that doesn't look likely the one that would you not pick out as there's a deliverer or there's a judge or there's a there's a real saint of god that's not the one god chose god chose the least of them praise god but god looked down and said there's potential there amen just like david like jesse's dead or i'm sorry david's dead jesse jesse didn't forgot about david when samuel come he didn't even think to invite him there praise god david wasn't even in his mind he's just a small he's a handsome guy ruddy guy but but david jesse didn't even think well maybe it'll be my youngest son and again god uses the least esteem there it is again praise god god uses the least esteem church that's that's why i encourage all of us just stay humble praise god look for god to move in your life in little ways and be faithful in little things if you want to see a great miracle be faithful in the little things amen hallelujah god always chooses that the bible said he brings down the high mighty and he exalts the humble that's that's god's way now look at verse 15 here's where i was trying to show and he said unto him o my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house the least i'm not the greatest at the church can i just say like that i'm not the most talked about person in the church i'm not the one that's got the most testimonies and the church said but yet god came to him because god saw he had potential and he asked that great question i want to know where's all the miracles whenever there's a god there's a supernatural movement around amen hallelujah god constantly moving supernaturally man placing events of our lives together doing things that only he can get credit for praise god and what does the lord answer verse 16 and the lord said unto him surely i'll be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man amen what an answer he said how am i going to save israel church that's the only answer you and i need how am i going to do anything if god is with you amen how am i going to overcome this this financial crisis how am i going to overcome uh this persecution from my family how am i going to overcome this temptation if god is with you then who can be against you amen that's a simple answer god says i'm going to be with you does it take does it take a smart educated scientist to believe that no it just takes a humble person okay if god said it i believe it and so that's what we see in gideon's life he's fearful but all of them are fearful at first right the whole church was fearful at first because they've suffered through seven years of disobedience they'd feared other gods other than yahweh and gideon was one of the you must have been the first one who must have been one of the rare ones that actually heard the prophet's message believed it thought about well god where's all the miracles lord we want to see miracles he must have been one of those crying out in prayer amen hallelujah now this is the first sign he asked for now that that's the beautiful part of gideon's life he knows all these great promises are spoken to him he's valiant he's going to save the nation from these many nights that came every seven years but how is he going to do it in other words he's heard he said amen faith has come by hearing and hearing by the word of god praise god but can i say it like this getting one to go from faith unto more faith amen you want to go from glory unto glory hallelujah and for each step of the battle church each step of the trial he needs god to show him more supernatural hallelujah and i think if you look at it really every person's life in the bible that's what it was because remember even abraham the father of faith at one point he was laughing at god and genesis 17. he said i'm going to give you a son through sarah and he laughed god's got a sense of humor on him doesn't he and then sarah laughed sarah left when when the angel lord said it's coming through you they laughed so see we never want to make gideon seem like not a strong believer because we can all put ourselves right in those shoes when was the last time you defeated a country of of warriors and soldiers none of us have none of us so that's why we should respect gideon amen that's why he was putting in the hall of fame of faith amen so he can look at him and learn from him if god speaks any word to you he's going to bring it to pass but he's also got to teach you to trust him teach you to believe teach you to seek his face and then as you do that god will raise your strength and so he can use you to accomplish the great thing of your life i preached this a few months ago maybe six months ago a few for a month might be 12 months for me i don't know but i said you know some of us have just some of us have one great thing god's trying to get out of our life one great thing for example i use the the shulamite i'm sorry no uh the queen of sheba jesus said i'm going to raise up the queen of sheba she's going to be a witness this woman is going to witness and condemn all the pharisees and sadducees that lived a thousand years after her because she crossed the desert to hear solomon and that's all jesus says that one part of her life amen the whole the whole her whole life was building up to that moment amen and god was dealing with her and she heard there's a there's a prophet there's a prophet her whole life was building up with us and god had to keep raising her faith you've got to cross the desert and you all across the nation so i know god's going to bless you too god may use you honestly god may use you on the day of judgment for those people that wouldn't cross the street to come to our church or across the state or across the city brother you know what i'm talking about people running across the city to come to church right and that if they don't repent of that they'll be condemned because god's going to raise up people that made greater sacrifice to hear a lesser gift right god will raise those people up and use that against them i'm saying that as a warning it also has encouragement too now church gideon's life only has three chapters on it six seven and eight has anybody read those lately if not it's okay so six is all about this meeting with the angel seven is the victory over the midnights and in eight you see a little more a battle with with israel but then the end of his life ends in disgrace he marries like 40 women is it like has all that i mean and then and then uh uh he builds like a ephod i think it like that and the israel goes right back into idolatry at the end of his life so but look at it it's just like the the queen of the south you know she had one moment of her life where your whole life is building up to this this is this is a certain kind of testimony this certain kind of uh uh victory i want you to overcome with and that's what the whole those were the one major event in their life the the purpose of their life remember what was samson's purpose samson's purpose of his whole life was to begin the destruction of the philistines and he ran from it from all those years yeah he had a little victory here and there i mean big victory thousand i'm just saying like he wasn't doing what he all should have done the whole time and it comes down to the very end of his life so his his victory came at the very end of his life what a climax that was he had a good start and then fell real real low with delilah and then he ends on this major climax where in his in his death he did he kills more philistines than he did in his entire lifetime in one moment and that's what he used to remember for that's why he's in the hall of fame of faith because he cried out once more lord oh church don't you know your prayers are precious in the sight of god when you say lord just send another miracle lord just send another revival amen lord just send another soul that needs to be saved amen once more lord amen bring back back that fire that i once had amen bring back that zeal i once had bring back that obedience i once had once more lord god is in these kind of prayers where you cry as the lord for victory tired of defeat tired of the same old thing but the saints the people of god had to be desperate for it for seven years they cried for it then god sent it hallelujah sometimes it takes that sometimes it takes years of prayer years of like we just seen with austin coming back five years of prayer it might take some years like i was telling haven haven comes up for the certain person to be saved all the time i just keep telling just keep coming just keep coming year after year we've seen it on two occasions right people come back to the lord just be faithful i love that about her i love that that faith i'm gonna keep believing praise god i'm gonna keep asking amen i'm not gonna give up hallelujah god honors faith like that now here in verse 17 he asked for his first sign now i'm going to just uh go through this quickly here he asks for the angel to stay here he's going to go make a meal he's going to bring it back to the angel okay and then he brings the meal back the angel puts a staff on it in verse 21 and fire rises up out of the rock it consumes the whole sacrifice and the angel lord vanishes out of his sight and in verse 22 gideon perceives that it was an angel of the lord and then he says oh my lord because i've seen the angel of the lord face to face so he's he's going through seven years of loss seven years of poverty and the angel says i'm with you he said well just your if you're if you're really with me let me do this and notice it wasn't an unholy thing it was a sacrifice see church when we asked god to do something let's make it a sacrifice if you in other words if you want proof that god wants you to do this sacrifice something like give up some money or give up give up some uh give up some meals give up something this was a holy sacrifice amen if we want to see god we got to sacrifice if we want to show god that we really mean business we got to sacrifice something amen it's not like the denomination is well well for i'm going to give up chocolate until easter time then i can eat all the chocolate i want after easter that's not a real sacrifice because chocolate's not necessary for for for life you know or given i'll give up facebook until easter is over praise god i'll give up facebook that's ridiculous it's ridiculous you're just going to go right back to it but what he sacrificed here he couldn't get back amen amen that's why when you sacrifice your time or your money your energy all these things and it's a real sacrifice god will honor that real sacrifice so gideon's a man of fear first of course god sees faith in there and he says show me this one sign and god answers him and god shows him the sign amen now look at verse 23 and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die so now we know what's going through his mind well god just answered my prayer i met an angel but i'm going to die the many nights i've seen their armies circle for seven years we're just we're surrounded there's no way i'm going to die so the lord tells them you're not going to die in other words i'm here to protect your life can you imagine that one church one angel can protect you from thousands and thousands upon thousands of men with weapons amen i don't know if god is for us who can be against us amen that mighty angel army amen one angel amen could be sent from heaven to protect you and i in the midst of total total chaos total obstacles impossibilities god can send one angel to protect our lives amen if we're willing to obey the word of god he's willing to do it now church i'm going to call this i'm going to call this his justification moment because there's a type in here i preached this like i said eight years ago been a while since i preached this one but we i can see the three so this is where he's justified this is where he starts living a new life this is where he starts his battle against fear right here and the church said when did you really start battling sin once you got saved before that you were just a slave to it so here he says well i'm starting a new life now i know god's with me right you get saved now you know god's with me now you love god now you're serving god now you're repentant you're baptized in water praise god and now you're ready to serve god now he built an altar there to honor that he was visited by an angel lord now look here's the next thing now here's what i believe church is sanctification verse 25. now it came to pass not a different night the same night and look what god tried to he tries to get him a quick he tries to keep him moving in the spirit of god in other words he doesn't wait for a couple of nights to kind of he kind of in other words he strikes it while the iron's hot amen in other words god is going to do a quick short work here hallelujah just like the rapture we believe the rapture should be a quick short work we don't know if we 30 days 40 days we don't know 50 days no one knows that the the squeeze and the pouring out the latter rain before the rapture brother brahma calls it like a short quick work in other words it's the final anointing of the holy ghost that we need to take us in the rapture it's called the lattering yeah you'll get it then if you're if you're predestined you'll get it then what if you're not if you're not no you'll be you'll reproduce predestinated for sure yeah absolutely yeah we don't know but that that makes total sense yeah it makes total sense that you would get it then yeah because jesus said jerusalem will be trotted down until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled in other words god knows when that last soul gets saved or that last soul gets the holy ghost when that last one and then the la whenever the ladder rain falls we don't know when it falls in there but whenever that last one is there god has them saved sealed sanctified filled with the holy ghost whatever and then whatever time whatever needs to be done to finish all the prophecy then god raptures the church and then he goes back to the jews okay so there's there's a lot of mystery in there too there's a lot of brother man just puts a lot of ideas in there very little has thus saith the lord but what we do have thou saith the lord is the latter rain it's going to fall it's going to fall no it's spiritual rain yes it's kind of it's a metaphor yeah like the day of pentecost in other words god is going to end the church the way it started it started with the pentecost holy ghost fire like that it's going to end like that too probably probably but yeah probably but probably yeah yeah yeah the holy ghost truly fell on azusa street in 1906 in a powerful way yeah yeah just just that's humility brother just humility yeah humble that's a sacrifice that's a sacrifice see each person has to make a sacrifice and god honors the sacrifice yeah now look at the various so why he's hot why he's on fire he's he's met the angel of the lord he says that same night god came back again in verse 25 the lord said to him get in take thy father's young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that they that thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by it oh so now we see why the seven year things happened gideon's dad was an idolater and probably gideon maybe for a little bit like abraham remember abraham was the idolater but until god called him out of the land of china the bible said he worshipped the gods so i don't know how much giddy was in there but his dad had built an altar and i think they get poor and poor you would think well how come your god don't hear you for seven years you think they would catch on but they didn't his dad had built an altar to these fa the baal false god and there was a lot of awful things connected like you know child sacrifice adultery fornication all kinds of wicked things with the the false god of baal well yeah it could have been good um in other words he said go throw down your dad's idols you tear him down now why didn't he ask his dad to do that right yeah he probably wouldn't have he wasn't the one called god was going to use giddy you know what gideon means it means hewer or woodchopper he's a cutter gideon was a cutter and what the bible say you got the word of god in your hand so you can cut out you could cut out uh whatever you need up praise god you can cut down anything any obstacle in your way that and that's what he does here his name's gideon and that's what god calls him to do right here in this these next verses go into the grove and cut down this i idol that your dad has set up now for us it would be go clean up the past go clean go clean up all the problems in your family from the past that have not been cleaned up all the situations have not been talked about and repented of go clean out that before i can use you in a greater way you've got to take care of your home life amen i can't use you until you get your home right then i can use you that's why the home is the most important part the home is more important than this right here this is very important but home is more important praise god because you and i are supposed to bring an anointing to church and the church said you're supposed to bring your prayer life you're supposed to bring the word you're supposed to bring faith here now of course it raises when we get here right because we see one another but we're supposed to live so godly at home that we bring the anointing we bring the faith of god we bring the victory of god to church amen hallelujah i mean i've seen that over and over a time in my ministry in other words i'll study at home i'll pray at home and then i'll come out here and i'll preach some a message somebody say that's just what i needed well what was that i was praying i was seeking god in my home and i just god just led me to the scriptures and the quotes and put it all together delivered to you and god shows god loves you amen but see every person should be studying their home listening the bible worshipping their home reading the bible everybody should have a sanctuary in their home praise god but god tells get in before you go anywhere boy before you defeat the midnights you got to get your house cleaned up now we're going to see that his dad actually agree with this but in other words his dad must have not had the courage to do it so god had to raise up getting to do it amen now verse 26 and build an altar into the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the order place and take the second bullet and offer a bur sacrifice with the wood of the grove which is which thou shalt cut down okay so you see what he says you got to go clean up your father's past mistakes you got to cut down that grove chop down all those trees and that was his name gideon hallelujah i imagine he was out there brother austin said he went at night time he was chopping that down man you say look at this brothers i'm fulfilling my name i'm finally doing what god called me to do i'm manifesting what god made me to be praise god amen that's what you and i can say when we come to church when we worship god when we raise the godly family we can say we're doing what god has called us to do amen i was born to do this amen hallelujah gideon could be out there i was born to do this praise god i'm finally stepping in to the the destiny for my life amen i've been called gideon for all these years here i have been healing nothing i've been hiding but now i'm standing on the lord's side amen now i'm chopping down the lord's enemies hallelujah that's what i was called to do amen he finally started walking in the will of god for his life now look what he did god said go cast it down and go build restore an altar of worship in other words take it back to the beginning take it back to your first love get rid of that idol in your life and go make an altar to god in your home and worship god in your home that's why the that's why the enemies were there and what they do the bible said in verse 27 then gideon took man ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said to him and so it was because he feared his father's household that the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night now check that out he was afraid to do it during the daytime why because he thought he's gonna get killed but didn't the angel just say i'm going to be with you you're not going to die see church how we can believe part of the word but not all of it sometimes his faith that's right did god get rid of him no god worked with his fear oh hallelujah and the church said i'll say it like this god's going to get glory through our problems god's going to get glory through our weaknesses just obey as much as you can just believe the best you can amen hallelujah the angel said i'm going to don't fear you're not going to die now go cut it down well he's scared he's going to die so he was trying he had a little a little trouble with that part of the word but the rest of it he did he went right down there he said hey you nine other ten you ten other brothers you come with me let's just chop this down he said look i'm getting here i am i'm stepping into god's plan for my life nobody thought i'd ever be anything because i was at least in my house and look at me i'm establishing the altar i'm bringing back the worship to jesus christ amen hallelujah look at me guys look at me of course he wasn't he's probably just happy about it you know look at this i'm i'm becoming i'm finally becoming the man i'm finally becoming the woman god has always wanted me to be amen hallelujah i'm just overcoming fear one step at a time god's called me to do something great but i'm just starting with these little victories first hallelujah and church if you can get the little victories first the big ones are coming praise god hallelujah praise god let me share this just i want to share like a little testimony that meant a lot to me how long has i preached about 45 minutes about 45 minutes hour well
