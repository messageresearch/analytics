greet you uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Jim sends greetings nice to see and brother Brian and my son and sister Don coming I didn't know she was coming U I just want to thank brother Jesse for the opportunity again to come and minister to you it's always a a privilege and it's always a struggle uh to know what to preach because I know brother Jesse is such a good teacher and uh you just get to thinking well what what can I bring to these the people there well there's nothing that I could bring my wife reminds me of that I thank God for a good wife and she's absolutely right there is nothing that I could bring to you but uh just want to bury my face in prayer and uh into the scriptures and find out the Lord's will what what he once uh said and uh we were kind of standing around the the table Saturday you know I was struggling what to what to talk on and and uh we happen to me standing around my wife says well while we're all here why don't we pray and we started talking about the different prayer requests and somebody said something I said I just got my just got my confirmation just got my thought so if you would turn with me to uh Matthew chapter 6 sometimes you got to get the formalities out of the way Matthew chapter 6 verse 5 everybody there this morning praise God it says and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou H has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when ye pray use not vain repetition as the Heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask after this manner therefore pray ye and would you repeat with me everybody know this Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us us day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen and then he says for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you if if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses look to the Lord in prayer this morning most gracious Heavenly Father we just appreciate you we thank you we love you Lord we ask for your guidance we ask for your help we ask for your spirit to come and be with us today and uh Lord there's there's nothing in me uh that can that can come and and do anything uh without you without your spirit without your scripture Lord we are absolutely nothing Well Lord God we just pray that you would come and Minister uh to these people this morning Lord what you laid on my heart you've shown me in the scriptures and and Lord any man can just lay them out but it takes you your spirit to anoint this word to to make it real in people's lives and uh Lord we just want to follow your anointing this morning Lord we want to follow your spirit and uh just fill us once again forgive us of every trespass every uh every sin every iniquity anything that would be hindering us this morning from a closer walk with you and Lord we just pray that you would place it under the blood of Christ Jesus that precious blood that was shed on Calvary for us oh God such a selfless act Lord you did it just for us and we thank you for that in Jesus Christ's name we do pray thank you Father amen please be seated bear with me this is the first time i' I've preached from one of these things and uh it's a little bit uh more organized than paper I guess but I think I'm used to it from writing stuff down and I'm not sure if I'm going to like this or not so bear with me this is something new uh but if you would uh turn to Matthew 26 and verse 30 what we read in Matthew 6 that's just a little um that's that's how Jesus had taught the disciples how to pray and we should follow the same pattern uh you know sometimes you get into prayer somebody asks you to pray for them and you get into pray or you get into the prayer meeting and I don't know what to pray about but then other times you get to thinking man there's so much to pray about you know you forget and we just tend to forget things that's that's all I mean there's all kinds of things to pray about you know if you just sit there and meditate on on things of of uh of your life and other people's lives and and just start going back and and thinking of what people would ask you you start remembering uh what you what you can be praying for what you should be praying for and the spirit will intervene for us you know say it'll cry out I have a father for us if we know not what to pray amen amen the Matthew 26 but we thank thank God for that intervening of the spirit to come in and help us and instruct us when we don't know what to do Matthew 26 and3 it says and when they had sung A Hymn they went out into the Mount of Olives then saith Jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will will go before you into Galilee and Peter answered and said said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended sometimes we we think that's such an honorable thing we stand up and you know Peter probably thought that was a very honorable thing and no matter what I'm going to Stand By Your Side verse 34 he says Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this night before the Crow Thou shalt deny me thce and Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples so it wasn't just Peter that agreed with this it was all the disciples that were present with him that said we're going to back you up no matter what we're not going to we're we're not going to be offended and we're going to be here with you the whole way verse 36 it says then cometh Jesus with with them unto a place called Gethsemane and saith unto the disciple sit ye here while I go and pray Yonder now does anybody know what Gethsemane means the the interpretation of Gethsemane it means an oil press uh looking it up in a in a dictionary uh under Webster it didn't save it for me but it's uh like mental uh spiritual and mental uh a place where the great suffering would be which we know that uh Jesus had had gone through great suffering In The Garden of Gethsemane which is what we're about to read here uh in verse 36 it says then cometh Jesus with them unto the place called Gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while I go and pray Yonder and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tear ye here and watch with me and he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wil so he's relinquishing his will unto the father's will and he knows what's set before him and he's trying uh and of course any man if we knew that we were going to go through the punishment and through the the uh the the the torture and the torment that he was going to go through certainly we wouldn't want to willingly uh want to go through that right you know we we'd be we'd be a little scared we'd be afraid and and who would uh would we be willing to uh do it voluntarily for our fellow man I probably wouldn't want to I probably I know I wouldn't want to do that you know knowing to that I would be getting ready to suffer what he was getting ready to go through so you can if you can enter into his anguish if you can enter into this the suffering of what he was going through that the just the mental suffering and the spiritual suffering that he was going through but he was willing voluntarily to let that aside and says not my will Lord but your will amen oh if we could just do that to one another and to the Lord himself if we could just let down our will and just abide by his will and it says uh verse 40 and and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour could you imagine his disappointment when he came upon Peter and the disciples and they were sleeping and he asked them hey I asked you to watch with me can't you watch with me for one hour you know sometimes we have a hard time in service to stay away for half an hour when a Minister's preaching but yo but just imagine the disappointment that Jesus Jesus would have had when he came up to the disciples and he found them sleeping you know the ones that just beforehand said we're going to follow you all the way you know we're not going to be offended but we're there with you the whole way we got your back he says uh watching pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak but that uh what I'd like to talk on this morning is what could you not watch with me one hour in verse 42 he says it it says he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh my father if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done so he didn't just go once he went a second time and he prayed the same thing and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy you know it could have been late in the night I'm not sure what time it was it they might say it in there but I can't recall off hand but it it it could have been late at night you know they could have been busy that day you know just tired in verse 44 he says and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time so three times he's praying the same thing so if you can uh as I said if you can enter in the first first time that he went and prayed into the mental anguish that he was going through knowing that he goes the third time and ask for the same thing so he's going through this this turmoil and it's just a a suffering that he's going through but notice it says uh and he prayed the third time saying the same words now what we read in the in Matthew 6 it says use not vain repetitions saying the same words uh what he was doing that was a little bit different from what uh vain repetition is uh he was going with with the uh again with the mental anguish and the uh there's a word I'm trying to get out but it's just not coming to my mind but he's just uh toiling through this suffering and he goes the third time to try to get it to try to get out of this situation but vain repetition is is uh worthless words and repeating uh kind of like chanting uh a few of you know that I was called out of Witchcraft I I used to get into a little bit of the the black magic and Witchcraft and that's what vain repetitions are is U I don't mean to lift it up by any means but kind of give you a little instruction on it as far as uh if somebody was going to cast a spell you would uh write out some poem or something that's what you would concentrate and you would just repeat it over and over and over and over again uh that's not what Jesus was doing here so I've heard the argument that he was using vain repetition that is not vain repetition amen that's that's going to the unjust judge and and knocking knocking and knocking you know for something that you want you're there knocking something that you need you have a desperation you're there to the to the judge and you're just knocking because you have something that that you require you're requiring something you need something so badly that you're asking and asking and asking again that's how we should come to the Lord you know in our desperations right I can never keep those things on verse 45 it says then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto him unto them he says sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of Sinners and then there there had to have been some kind of a time frame in there I'm sure he didn't say this right away uh then he says Rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me so we see things are uh beginning to uh unfold here of uh why he was in the garden because I guess it's it's known that they went there often you know Jesus took his disciples there often and he went there and and prayed so Judas a scary would obviously know where he would be found now he says and while he yet spake Lo Judas one of the twel came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and Elders of of the people now he that betrayed him uh gave him a sign saying whomsoever I shall kiss the same as he hold him fast and forth with he came to Jesus and said hail master and kissed him and Jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come notice he calls him friend you know he was he knew what Judas was there for and he didn't call him enemy he said friend and it kind of reminds me of of uh brother brandham of of how people said people didn't know who his enemies were treated everybody the same you don't you wouldn't know whose enemies or who has an enemy or not you know and if we would just be uh behave ourselves that way nobody would know that we even had any enemies he says friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him and behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand and Drew a sword and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear so you see they're still sticking real close to him there even even what they were saying if I die I'll still be by your side you know I'm not going to leave you so even sming off the the the priest servant's ear then said uh then said Jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword Shall Perish with the sword think as thou I cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than 12 Legions of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be in that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes are ye come out against out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled and then here it is then all the disciples for forsook him and fled they got scared and ran this was the greatest emotional uh battle that Jesus uh that we know of In The Garden of Gethsemane before he was to be betrayed and like I said just before this or just before this took place they all agreed that they were going to stick by Jesus's side and uh all those disciples that were adamant I'm not leaving you I'm not going to be offended in you I'm going to stay right here what happened they fled they had to because Jesus had to bear this by himself you know this this was a this was a Warfare that he had to go through himself it was his own battle you know uh but this what I'm getting at as far as the the disciples they said I'm here to be with you to be by your side I'm here to help you at any given moment a lot of times we fail at that we say that we're going to be there for our brother for our sister uh when somebody asks us to pray uh we say okay I'm going to pray for you I'm going to go to I'm going to go to prayer but what happens is sometimes we forget or sometimes it might not be significant ific enough for us I hate to say it like that but some people probably think think that way but uh well that that's just something small I don't need to pray over that but to that person it may be so important to them and if they knew what you were just thinking in their in their minds they you know they wouldn't be able to trust you anymore they wouldn't be able to put their uh they wouldn't be able to look up to you I'll put it that way uh they wouldn't be able to you wouldn't be that go-to person there's a reason why people come and ask you to pray because they have a confidence in you they have a trust in you they believe that you're a prayer Warrior whatever it is but sometimes we have such good intentions that we forget we said we're going to be there for you what can I do for you anytime you need something call me 2 three in the morning I don't care what time it is but that those when those times come sometimes we don't follow through with what we say and know we can't pray for Jesus we can't sit there and watch in the Garden of Gethsemane with Jesus because he's already uh uh been crucified dead and and resurrected that wasn't our duty that was the disciples Duty that was what he asked the disciples to do there but what our duty is now is our fellow man our brothers and sisters that is our responsibility now is to watch and pray with our brothers and sisters amen but when Jesus was was teaching us how to pray and Matthew 6 uh in in the opening scripture it wasn't uh when you go to pray he said don't go as a Hypocrites do because they want to be heard they want to be seen you know they want to be heard for their much speakings and uh he was talking about the vain repetitions don't do that he says don't follow after that pattern but follow after the pattern which I lay before you which we which we read today and uh it it it isn't in some kind of an outward show prayer isn't an outward show it it's not a competition of of who who can remember what what uh prayer requests what who has what Revelation and it's not a competition among brethren we all know that we're all grown men spiritually mature here right so we know that prayer is not a competition it's not an outward show to to do before men to show how spiritual you are but where is the prayer supposed to be it's in a supposed to be in a secret closet before Christ or before God the Father alone amen but uh it should be an intervention prayer should be an intervention we're intervening it should be a communion we're communing with God it should be uh done with a pure heart with pure meaning with sincerity and backed up with action don't use meaningless Words which is the the Vain babblings and the vain repetitions that's just that's just something that's taking up time it's just taking it's just empty words that's making your prayer seem longer again making it an outward show when you have much speaking oh man that brother man he was praying a half an hour and 45 minutes man he must be a good prayer warri but you have no idea what that brother was praying he could have been just sitting there he could have fell asleep for all you know so we can't use other people as our pattern you understand what I mean say something let me know you're alive but a lot of times there's a problem the problem lies with then is we don't know what day or what time we're living in yeah we don't understand the crucial uh time that we have or or that we don't have I should say is uh we don't uh we don't understand how close we are we don't understand how much of a lazy age this is which a lot of times we slack in prayer it's not because uh we're not interested it's because we're lazy but you ever you ever wake up and uh you wonder who you are you wonder where you are am I late for work am I late for school you ever wake up like that wait who am I where am I what am I doing what am I supposed to be doing I've done that a few times my wife says it's okay it's Saturday you're not supposed to be just sleeping but sometimes you get your mind so focused uh or you're you're stuck on something me I don't like to be late so when I wake up like that and I feel like I'm late I start panicking you know am I late for work so you ever wake up like that you're into date you weren't focusing you just and that's what happens is sometimes we spiritually fall asleep and then when we're woken up with whoa where am I what am I doing what day am I in what am I supposed to be doing we get confused we have no idea what we're supposed to be doing but that's what happens sometimes just like the disciples fell asleep in the Garden of Gethsemane and they were adamant about being there with Jesus they were adamant about helping them out in this time of trouble Matthew 24 and verse 42 everybody with me amen sometimes that's scary just for a moment you wake up you don't know who you are where you are what you're doing I couldn't imagine somebody with amnesia you know just imagine the uh the fear that they would have on them you know not knowing any and it's not coming back anytime soon but when you wake up you know 101 15 minutes you're you're doing good get a cup of coffee and you're doing better for for those that drink coffee Matthew 24:42 it says watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the good men of the house had known in which what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would have not suffered his house to be broken up so if we knew what time of the Rapture would come we'd probably just lolly gag until the time of the rapture came but what did he say he said watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord.com so you have to be ready at any given moment amen yes sir you know some people had I was I was looking at some things uh over the weekend and uh I had read some comments over a video that I had watched and uh this person put on there and uh these people were in church for so long and and uh they were s such a good churchgoer but they were kind of coming against the church and excuse me and said something about uh teachings of a secret Rapture that that you know that that's a false teaching um no it isn't because it's not a secret it's in the scripture so the Rapture is not a secret but the time of The Happening of the Rapture is going to be a secret because doesn't the scripture teach that it it's going to be as a thief so it's going to be a secer so we just read here a thief is going to come at a time that you're not paying attention that's when they're most likely that's when they're most going to attack is when you're not ready why because it's easier to do that do it that way yeah if I was a thief I wouldn't want confrontation I want to make it easy as easy as I can so I'm going to try and make sure that nobody's home because I don't want any confrontation you know I don't want any problems I I would want to uh as I said easiest way possible that way I don't get in trouble as easy you know because a thief is trying to avoid the trouble so a thief plans things so it's a secret thing a thief isn't going to come and and lay the plans at your door and say hey I'm going to be here at such and such time no you you prepare your home you try to get locks and you try to get a security system to try to keep the thief out right so you try to prepare yourself against a thief so why not SP spiritually why not prepare yourself for the the time of The Happening that would come as a thief verse 44 says therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh and you know the world they just get tired of hearing this this stuff you know because they they they've heard it for decades they've heard it for centuries you know and people people just get tired of it uh verse 45 it says who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat and do season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming that would be a tragedy for us Believers to say uh why is my Lord delaying his coming you know as I said people are grumbling for years hearing uh Believers Christians saying the end is near and the time is at hand get ready uh and verse 49 it says and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken so they get tired of waiting on the Lord's uh coming that they just go out with the world they go out and drink with the drunken that's what it says here right the Lord of that servant shall come in that day or in a day when he lookth not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth but like I said we don't we don't always follow through with what we intend to do you know good intentions go bad sometimes you know we have good intentions to do something but we just don't follow through with it you know and then your words become vain because you said you were going to do something and then you didn't uphold your end but we get caught up so much in our own lives that we forget about others that are uh in need of prayer you know sometimes after a great Revival or sometimes we might be in a slump in a little uh in a little rut not getting anywhere you know it depends on the situation what what's going on sometimes you get so caught up in yourself that you forget about uh others you know somebody that some somebody that asked you to pray for them like I said earlier some somebody that has trust in you somebody that has confidence in you they're going to come say hey I'm having this struggle I have this issue that I just can't overcome would you watch with me would you pray with me you know or an accountability partner uh somebody that you go and confess things to and uh they do vice versa you know somebody that you could trust somebody that somebody that's there uh is how would you feel if you went to somebody and you said look I really need prayer I'm really having a hard time I feel like I'm backs slitter I feel like I'm just lost all together and you okay sure no no problem and then and then you get well I've got to take care of this right now you know I got a baseball game to intend to I'll pray afterward or I got some cookies and bread to bake I'll get to it after that or um I got such and such going on I'll get to it a little bit later and then you just kind of Shug it off what can you not watch with me for an hour what about 30 minutes what about 15 10 five can we give somebody five minutes of our time you know a lot of times that's all that's all it takes probably not even five minutes to just bow your head and and get into a sincere prayer you know you don't have to get all this incense out you don't have to get all these flowers out you don't have to get the music out just to prepare yourself for prayer at least we shouldn't have to we shouldn't be in that kind of condition anyways we should be able to at a drop of a hat be able to get into the presence of the Lord sometimes it does it doesn't always work that way I mean that that would be perfect that would be great if it did but there are times that we should be able to just uh pray without ceasing right we should always be in a in a season of prayer always uh one of the things that that helped me with this is uh my grandmother passed away uh what did I say it was about eight years ago U I had a I had had a surgery done and she had a surgery done uh like a day or two after my surgery and she called me you know hey how' your surgery go and she she was talking to me you know wanting to know how I was doing and uh so that was great that she called she was checking up on me and she said hey would you pray with me or pray for me I'm going to have my Sur where she had a a heart valve replacement I mean it's it's pretty serious surgery you know getting into messing with somebody's heart that's always a serious one is uh that well she came out okay or she came through the surgery okay but then a day later uh she passed away because of a blood clot and I tell you I felt so guilty because I didn't pray when my own grandmother asked me to pray at her time that she she was afraid of dying she had a fear of dying and she was so afraid of this surgery that she was going to die from this surgery and I had so much guilt after that because I realized afterwards she had asked me to pray and I did not get down in sincere prayer and pray for my own grandmother the same thing I had a brother pass away here a couple months ago his name was Shane and uh he was my step brother but I that step stuff kind of goes out of out the window you know when you lived together for so long and and you develop a relationship we we were brothers and uh I remember I started ministering this was uh some years ago and uh I was talking to him about uh being a minister and before I had left the house he was up visiting and uh he got me by my side and or he got me to the side by myself sorry I'm trying not to fall apart here so I'm concentrating on that um but he had pulled me to the side and he had said Brian I need you to pray for me you know I'm really struggling he wasn't a Believer but he knew something was there you know he he told me you know I know I know there's a change there's something there and he said I'd like for you to pray pray for me and uh I told him I would I might have done it once or twice but I wasn't as fervent as Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane because I I might have done it once or twice I I probably didn't do it three times or four times or I didn't do it every day I didn't do it every week I didn't even do it monthly or yearly and this was uh probably 10 years ago or more so you see what I mean about when somebody asks you to pray to not shrug it off when Jesus asked his disciples to watch and pray he meant he needed somebody there with him he needed to know that somebody is there with him I mean just he was a man at that moment he was a man and and a man of like passions as us we want somebody there we want a hold a hand to hold on to we want a shoulder to cry on we want somebody there to to to know that they're in our corner right it's exhilarating to know that you have somebody backing you up to encourage you to give you confidence to boost you up to help you to know that you can receive from the Lord because they might be in a condition that um they might be in a place where they they feel that they have no hope they might be in a hopeless condition what seems hopeless to them it's a desperate time for them so they're calling out to you can you not watch with me for one hour can we not pray for somebody for one hour but like I said what about 30 minutes yeah what about five can we not we have 24 hours in a day some people sleep for eight of it some people work for eight of it so there's 16 so there's another eight left right so what do we do in that time we do our own thing yeah we have our own lives we have families some of us have amilies to take care of we have children to take care of we have homes to take care of but certainly we can find five or 10 minutes in there to pray for somebody but like I said they might not have any hope they might not have any Assurance they might not have any confidence they might not have any idea how to access God you know that's a benefit of being part of a priesthood you know we're priesthood 1 Peter 2:9 says we're a royal priesthood a holy nation amen and one of the benefits of being a priest and being in a priesthood is you have access to God Amen so they might not know how to have access to God that you know some people believe some people really believe that they cannot pray or talk directly to God but we know that we have a direct line to God right we have a direct hookup all we have to do is talk to him but people are in that condition that they have no idea how to talk to God and that's where we come in is we show them that they have access to God too you know we're not a Catholic priest where people have to come to us and say confess their sins to us and and we go tell while go and say so many Hail marries and our father I don't know I'm not a priest I'm I'm not a Catholic but you know I don't have the rosary beads but we don't have to do that we have our own access to God we don't have to go to S pray to some dead saint but we could pray to a living God Amen but like I said it's it's not uh you were there to help them in this situation to you can instruct them amen because if you have direct access to you could show them have to have the same James 5:116 it says confess your faults one to another like I said it's not being a Catholic priest where somebody's confessing sins but like I said the accountability partner if you have an accountability partner you're going to confess your sins to them you know because you didn't trust them but it says confess your faults one to another and pray one for another we're not one of us is above above the other one yeah I'm not greater than anybody else in here and you're not greater than me right but pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the effectual fervent prayer not just some vain repetition well bless Susie bless Bobby and have a good day but earnestly contending for them when they ask you earnestly and fervently with passion with Desire with a care I'm not saying that y'all don't care but you understand where I'm coming from I I I hope and first John 5:14 is is a what I'm saying is we're trying to give them a confidence to know that that they can know that they can receive from God too and this is the confidence that we have in him that that is Christ Jesus that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him amen amen you know when Jesus went to pray for people he wanted to take care of things right now like I said you know we shouldn't uh we shouldn't have the mindset well after this baseball game I got a baseball game to go run off to or I got such such an crafting that I need to be at after that when I get back I'll go ahead and take care of that prayer you know but Jesus wanted to take care of it take gyrus for example when the people came and told the that that man that his daughter died Jesus said well let's go we're going to go take care of this situation right now you know he didn't say well we'll wait until next week or something you know well she's dead there's nothing we can do now he said let's go and take care of the situation right now and if he was in that house you ever hear that song he's in the house death has to flee oh my I wish I knew it I sing it for you I'm not you don't want to hear me sing anyway but if you get to hear that song it's such a a such a wonderful song to to get you in the spirit of worship to get you if if if you have need of something listen to that song he's in the and if he was in that house in their desperation he'll be in your house in your time of desperation you get it he's omnipresent he's not uh he's not a respector of persons he's not a respector of me brother Jesse brother John because of ministers he's not respector of any person like that he doesn't care what position anybody holds what is it the the weakest of Christians come on the weakest of Christians when they get down in prayer they Shake hell right amen so it doesn't matter if you have that little bit of Faith a little bit of light overcomes Darkness I don't care how small the light is it will overcome any Darkness it could be a little penlight it will overcome that Darkness a little bit of light overcomes amen amen everybody okay with me this morning all right I heard 1 Peter 1 and 21 it says who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God but of course we don't want to put our trust in in man you know just like healing doesn't come from man it doesn't come from a rock it doesn't come from a candle it doesn't come from a handkerchief I'm kind of getting into the Witchcraft thing again because there was Rock magic candle magic Earth Elemental Magic you know and they just concentrate their things on on that item alone which we don't there is no healing there is no power in any of that in nothing even even the handkerchiefs in acts with with Peter there was no power in the handkerchief it was their faith that brought the healing right it was their faith amen so it says uh seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently not with a relaxed heart but with a pure heart not with a an A A Heart full of a a heart full of uh Grudge a Heart full of hatred but it says love one another with a pure heart fervently and then Titus 2 verse 11 it says for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men it's there available to all men it's up to them if they choose it or not it's their choice ultimately we can't force anybody to do anything we can't force our beliefs we can't force Revelation onto somebody we can't force salvation onto people uh verse 12 it says teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking being alert now now looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee but in verse 13 going again it says looking for that blessed hope is something that we're looking forward to when you're looking your eyes are awake Your Eyes Are Open you're alert you're waiting for it to happen you're expecting it and ver uh first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 5 it says ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober again he's saying don't follow after that other pattern follow follow the pattern which I had laid before you don't follow after the the Hypocrites and as the worldliness does for their mind is not toward him our minds ought to be concentrated on him our minds ought to be focused on him and on his appearing at his coming waiting for his return amen and not not being grudging why is he delaying why is he taking so long and then turning into the worldly things going and getting drunk with the world you know sometimes we we get uh you rub shoulders with the world enough you sometimes you might uh be tempted to get into the same things that they do well man that cigarette sure smells good well I sure could have a beer you got to be careful of those thoughts now that's not what you should be focused on I think I heard brother John say we should we should uh meditate on Godly things the righteous things I can't remember the scripture whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are pure and so on the scripture says meditate upon these things you know put away from you the uh worldliness and the the uh unrighteousness and the worldly lust amen it says for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night that's when things happen that's when most parties happen is during the night I think it was brother brand said that's when the that's when the demon power really comes out is through the night time but let us who are of the Day Children of the light be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for in helmet the hope of salvation for God ha not appointed us to wrath but would obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him think I'm got to close with this I thought I was going to be a lot longer than this but I was kind of worried on the way here man I might have to cut some of this stuff out 1 Corinthians chapter 16 it says watch ye Stand Fast in the faith quit ye like men amen that doesn't mean quit that doesn't mean give up that doesn't mean stop what you're doing that doesn't mean give up the ship surrendering quit ye like men means to act like a man be courageous be brave it means to stand strong quit ye like men stand up and be a Christian if you're called to be a soldier in this blessed glorious hope and stand to be the best soldier you could be right God can't use a cowardly Soldier even our own uh uh Armed Forces can't use a cowardly Soldier cowards run we need somebody that's going to be in the fight amen he says quit ye like men be strong but let all your things be done with charity and we know charity means love let all things be done with love amen amen I'm got to close with this uh quote brother brand says this he says now then as we see this day appearing and see God sending great revivals across the country I know y'all just had some meetings and I I don't know who preached what I I don't know what happened over the weekend uh I just heard uh I think Sunday morning after brother Jim uh preach the morning service I think it was brother Mike and sister Shirley they said uh you just preached exactly I don't know who preached Saturday night whoever the brother was preaching Saturday night it might have been Isaiah Brooks brother Isaiah and they told him and said You Preach exactly what brother Brooks preached he used the same characters the same scriptures you know I guess we didn't have to be here you know we heard the same thing and we wanted to be here but we just couldn't make it but uh and see God sending great revivals across the country you Baptist a Billy Graham you Methodist of Jack Scher you Pentecostals and Oral Roberts why what God has done great signs wonders and miracles has taken place throughout the Nations everywhere and continually the nation wads on into sin all these great things happening and people still go into sin oh that's such a great thing that happened but they don't turn their eyes to God they don't turn their lives to God continually getting worse all the time it reminds me of a little story a little thing that happened uh in Louisville Kentucky about six months ago there was a lady that had her little baby and she was uh in one of those five and 10 10- cent store in Louisville and they begin to notice this the little sister uh she was picking up little gadgets you know and say look honey look honey you know just trying to get his attention so then she'd get nervous and run to another counter and say look honey look honey and the little baby would just sit staring not doing anything just staring then she'd go to another counter and another counter getting more nervous all the time she was getting Fran can can you perceive that through reading this she's getting franic for her little child uh getting more nervous all the time finally she picked up a little jingle outfit and she shook it and she said look darling look at this you know with the Bell surely that would get the baby's attention anything that ought to ATT a little boy's attention like that but he just sat and looked and stared in space you know that that's how we get sometimes you know word gets word is being preached before us something that we have need of and we're just staring off thinking about something else yeah you know not even concentrating on what's being said where that very nugget to get you out of your situation to get you out of your tribulation to help you overcome is being preached right from the pulpit and sometimes we're just not paying attention to it uh we're just staring off somewhere else yeah no I lost my place sorry uh but he just said but he just sat and looked stared in space and she fell down at the C counter and began to scream she said oh no it just can't be and the people that was in the store they were uh they went to went to her to find out what was wrong and she said my little boy about a year ago said into just staring in space and said I have done everything I've had him to the doctor and the doctor said he thought he was better but he isn't and said I've just done everything I can to attract his attention with little gadgets that ought to attract a little boy's attention of his age and said this little thing little horse cart it's got a jingle bells on it uh like a little boy near Christmas time like this ought to be listening to this uh this little bells in the snow and so forth and said he just sits and stares in in space said he's no better and her little mother heart screamed out for her baby because she knew there was something mentally wrong with her baby how we doing Saints kind of thinking reflecting on things in your own life yeah you know people that have asked you well I've been there I know I know the anguish afterward you know don't wait until somebody passes away you or don't wait until it's too late you know they've asked you beforehand he says I think that's a great deal with the church today God has shook every kind of a gift and things that he could before the church and it just sets and stares in space well that was a very nice meeting brother Roberts had a fine meeting did you walk away from your meetings a that was such a great one I can't wait for another one you know or did you really take it to heart well that was a very nice meeting brother Roberts had a real fine meeting brother Billy Graham has uh has great speaking but they don't move they don't react to the word what we need today is a soul stirring Revival something that would go down uh to cause all night prayer meetings men and women getting right with God and cities turning to God great signs and wonders would just keep accumulating but we know that America's already turned their back on God so you won't see that Nation why but if we could at least see a church you know in our own churches God sends us gifts he shakes them before our eyes and if we turn them down then what God can do about it if that mother thought about uh thought that about her baby what does God think tonight about his church when we've had so much before us great men in the land Tommy Osborne uh and brother Allan and and we have good Brothers now you know your pastor is one of them brother cam you know and the different ones throughout you I'm not into politics so I'm not going to politics for individuals [Music] so oh how many great men has has crossed the nation from place to place all kinds of signs and wonders has showed up right at the end time and yet the church sets dazed it just sets dazed it just sits staring not doing anything about it they say oh it was pretty good I believe I may go to another uh to another night see what will take place at the next meeting you know even with brother Brandon with with his Healing Ministry you know people just went to see the miracles happen they weren't concerned about the word which that's the lifechanging uh substance is the word amen it isn't the healing it isn't the Miracles that's not yeah it's lifechanging in the natural to some people that the miracles happen to but that's not eternal life destination changing the word is that substance that's not the thing to do what we need when we see God moving in our midst is to get down to business with it pray and cry out and do all that we know how to do so you're expelling all of your tools everything that you know how to do you're putting your all into it everything that you know what to do that you could support your meetings uh the the future meetings that you're going to have even the weekly meetings that you have you put everything into it well I guess we got to go to service tonight you know I wonder what the brother's going to preach on you know wonder if he's going to step on my toes wonder if he's going to encourage me wonder if he's going to bless me tonight now we can't have that kind of a mindset amen right he says what we need when we see God moving in our midst is to get down to business with it pray and cry out and do all that we know how to do let the gospel in this day in this last days attract our attention the Bible promised that this gospel would just become so each day like in the days of of Luther he taught justification it come in the minority when he come into the Wesley Methodist age through sanctification then when they settled down to a church and that was all there was to it God raised up Pentecost and now it's got to the place that Pentecost is becoming formal and indifferent and I would even go so far as to say the message has become informal and indifferent you know it's become a playground or something or some kind of a a nursery a nursery school I say that because people aren't becoming mature well it's either the ministry or your attitude it's one or the other if the minister is preaching the word the whole un uh the whole pure word that is not the ministry they come in the minority when you come into Wesley Methodist stes through sanctification uh let's see and now it's got to a place that Pentecost is becoming formal and indifferent God moves right on he said he won't stop at all he goes right on even in the message pews or chairs however you want to put it however the setup is it doesn't it doesn't matter if we don't reach out and get it he's just going to pass right by if we don't take him at his word if we don't put our confidence in him if we don't trust in him they'll pass right on by pass me not oh gentle savior amen that's my cry amen the children of Israel followed a pillar of fire and every time that fire stopped they stopped with it and if they didn't move they was left in the wilderness they were going to get left behind they had to move where the fire moved that's the way God's Church always does it moves with the fire when Martin Luther saw the fire in the First Reformation he come out of the Catholic church and he built his denomination under the fire moved into sanctification he was already organized under that and couldn't do it go any F farther Methodist took it and they organized under that and they couldn't go no farther Pentecost come and took it from them now if we don't watch the fire will move right on again let's stay under the fire worship right under the fire Worship in the power and the spirit believing God's word laying aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us amen following that fire wherever the fire goes that's where we ought to go amen not getting the hose out and quenching the fire no amen you would stand to your feet with me I'm going to go ahead and close I told a sister I said when I was studying I I fell asleep sleep a couple times and she said well you might want to pick a different topic if it's making you fall asleep what's it going to do to the congregation I found it funny because I was going to be talking about sleeping but we let so many things pass by us this is the hour that we need to watch there is no time for sleeping this isn't the time for sleeping if we knew the hour the thief was going to come then we would wait for that exact hour for that Thief to come and we wouldn't be ready at any other time I don't know I I I think I've said this here before uh when I was in the military we had what was called a Mobility bag I don't know if anybody's been in the military here or not uh what a Mobility bag is uh you have your uniforms in there uh you have your soap deodorant all than Necessities in case if you were called to War uh which uh if if you were called to go somewhere you had to have that bag ready you had to have your stuff ready right now because you have no time to pack there's no time to pack stuff so when you were called uh when your name is called on that list you better get your stuff and get the next person and you better get going because you're you're deploying right now so the same thing is with the Rapture when the time comes you have no time to pack anything you have no time to become righteous at that time but when the Rapture Comes The Rapture is coming now taking whoever's ready to go so let's unpack stuff that doesn't need to be in our bag and pack the necessity the necessary things that belong in our mobility in our rapturing bag if you would amen we've got to be ready we cannot this is not the time to be sleeping this is the time to be alert it says watch and pray for that glorious appearing amen you know uh I I can't remember exactly how it said but we know that there was a man that that uh had such good crops that he he tore the one Barn down and he built another one and he pecked it so fully he says now so I can take my knees just because you got baptized you repented and you you received the gift of the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean that you sck back and and take your ease and just watch things happen that's right no we move with the fire right fire puts it in the action so you have the Holy Ghost of fire you're going to be full of action you're not going to sit idly by idleness is in a sin itself but we know sin is unbelief we understand that amen bow our his most gracious Heavenly Father Lord I just appreciate appreciate you I just thank you for the opportunity to come and to minister your word once again Lord my prayer is always to be uh that it could be a blessing to the people and I pray that

we take it seriously may we just put it before you right now today in prayer not put it off to this evening or tomorrow or or next week but when somebody asks us Lord they have a confidence in us they have a h a trust in us they have there's something there that's drawing us to them uh to pray for them and Lord maybe take it seriously as a a desperation maybe enter into their desperation Lord just

don't want to sing it but just something that uh I wasn't sure if I was going to go over this or not anybody know that song uh while you were Sleeping by Casting Crowns anybody ever hear that song it's so it's it's very fitting especially for this this day and age I'll just go through the you can be seated if you want and I'll probably be a couple minutes it says oh little town of Bethlehem looks like another silent night above your deep and dreamless sleep a giant star lights up the sky and while you're lying in the dark there shines an everlasting light for the King has left his throne and is sleeping in a Manger tonight oh Bethlehem what you have missed While You Were Sleeping for God became a man and stepped into your world today oh Bethlehem you will go down in history as a city with no room for its king remember they said that there is no room in the in as a city with no room for its king While You Were Sleeping a little town of Jerusalem looks like another silent night the father gave his only son the way the truth the life had come but there was no room for him in the world he came to save isn't that so sad they couldn't accept him because they were sleeping to what was going on they had they have eyes to see and ears to hear but they they can't see or hear of what's going on or what happened in their day and the same thing is happening in this day right you know people have eyes to see and ears to hear but they're not they choose not to accept it it says Jerusalem what you have missed while you were sleeping and I want to say to you don't miss the Holy Ghost of fire because of you're sleeping amen the savior of the world is dying on your cross today Jerusalem you will go down in history as a city with no room for its king and then then they get right down into it as far as the United States of America looks like another silent night as we're sung to sleep by philosophies isn't that so true they're singing these people to sleep they're longing them to sleep by these different Phil philosophies that they have about LGBT about abortion about all these different things yes I know I'm on the internet that's one thing that makes me nervous coming here is because I know anybody can see it but I'm gonna say you know they're Ling people to sleep with their philosophies to try to get people to accept their way of life and they're bullying people with it that's as were're starting as sleep by philosophies that save the trees and kill the children isn't that so true the way they want to save gorillas but yet they kill children they want to save historical buildings but yet they want to kill children they want to save replica military uh memorabilia uh helicopters tanks or the whatnot they want to save those inanimate things but they want to kill the children they want to allow abortion to happen they want to save the pets but they allow killing of children this country is lulled to sleep by these philosophies by these immoral philosophies and while they while we're lying in the dark there's a shout heard across the Eastern sky for the bridegroom has returned and has carried his bride away in the night America what will we miss while we are sleeping will Jesus come again and leave us slumbering where we lay America will we go down in history as a nation with no room for its king you see how it is you can stand to your feet and I'm going to go ahead and close you see how it is is with men's philosophies they they try to criticize our way of life saying you have one track mind but they do the same if not worse as far as it's their way or no way they try to bully things they try to bully their way through forgive me of the rant but it's it's just what I see in this day and it upsets me especially when it gets into churches and churches accept the same thing when they know it's an Abomination against God they have no backbone to wake up and to stand for Christ they we need a lot more Peters that would stand up and and and be bold not that we not that we want to fight people that's that's not what I'm saying I'm not saying go and fight but stand up for what we believe we canot fall asleep in this day but we must have that urgency within our hearts to stay awake Jesus said can you not watch with me one hour can we not watch through the rest of this hour can we not watch and pray amen let's sing that song

song about that that we are greater than the blood and how can you say what could be greater than the blood well you are because you were the purchase of that blood you know if you go to buy something you give something of equal or greater value or of equal value to buy something that is of that value or more amen so you are more than the blood of Jesus Christ because he thought so much of you that he willingly shed so he thought of you more than his own blood praise God so you just think on that we have brother John come and close let's sing that course again this is my story if this is your
