by the grace of me get back to our two services and so we're so happy about it so happy to be in the house of Lord today so let's just invite our brother to come and let's sing that last verse again letting people that last verse up again let's see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh hallelujah is that your heart's desire Thank You brothers to appreciate that it's wonderful to say you might be a small group but you still have people that are willing to step up to at least make some music and it doesn't matter if you're small or large it's what matters is that the Spirit of the Lord is there and then if you would turn to revelations chapter three at verse 20 it's good to be here to see y'all again and greet y'all from back home in Albion Pennsylvania brother Jim sends his greetings and all the all the saints with him hey ma'am been a while since I've ministered so bear with me this morning thank you brother bear with me I might be a little bit nervous here and there I wasn't nervous so much until I stepped out but we always want to be reverent and in handling the Word of God and I just want to I just want to do the best that I can to help you all to be a blessing to you y'all know brother Diggs very well I'm sure you've heard brother cadre he preached a message one time blessed to be a blessing and that's something that's stuck in my mind as a I'm blessed and if I'm blessed I want to be a blessing unto you so let us read here in galatians chapter 3 verse 20 it says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me brother Brennan have talked about a painting of Jesus knocking on a door he says when the great artist painted the picture of Jesus knocking at the at the door he says any picture before it can become a famous picture it has to go through the Hall of critics the people who are famous artists artists are the ones who criticize the picture that's that's kind of how I feel like preaching this morning all the all the critics all the good preachers are going to be criticizing me now I just think a lot of brother Jesse and just appreciate the invitation he says they find all the flaws that's in it you might find flaws in me this morning but we're going to we're going to press on anyways that we're all human beings we all make mistakes but that's not my intention my intention is not to come and deliberately teach you something false so that is not my intention and that that's that's the way the world is is that they're looking at your life so much they're looking at every angle every aspect every word every action every reaction and they're criticizing that they're going to criticize to see if you were living up to it up to your confession so after this famous picture had went through practically the hall of critics it was asked the man who give the painting a critic said there's just one thing that I could find wrong with your picture he says you have forgotten to put the latch on the door and the one that painted the painting said oh no you misunderstand that's what hid his a lot in this days is misunderstanding you misunderstand if the latch was on the outside he would raise the latch go in but the latches on the inside the person inside must lift the latch and that's the way it is with Jesus with all of his mercy and all of his compassion yet you are the person that will let him in or keep him out you have the latch on your side this isn't just a one-sided thing this is a two-part thing a relationship a marriage is not one-sided it takes two it's a partnership yes but what would a man knock at another man's door for he said what would be the reason why it's to gain entrance he wants to come in he wants he's got something that he wants to talk about or something to show you there's a reason why a person is knocking on a door it's not just an empty just knocking and we used to play the game when we were younger you knock on the door and run you know it's not something in vain but there's a purpose to the knocking when someone knocks at your door they want to they want to come in there wanting to gain entrance or little fellowship or something to talk to you about that's the reason Jesus knocked at the door I remember in revelation 3:20 what we read he says behold I stand at the door and knock so he's knocking and If any man hear my voice and open the door remember the latches on the inside you're the one who is able to open it or close it in this situation you are the one who's able to open or close to allow him to come in or to keep him out it's your decision and then he says I will come in to him and sup with him and be with me so he wants to have fellowship with you let's look to the Lord this most gracious have any fathers just a great privilege to to come and be able to stand behind this pulpit once again and Lord as I I see myself as a as a human as a man of mortal flesh not worthy to stand here before your children and Lord that is so true because you are the one who bought them with the price Oh God you were the one who is worthy you were the one who is almighty and Lord you were the one that we were looking to this morning and my trust is in you this morning it's not a my own ability Lord the only ability I have is to be able to read and and and write I could read the words on the page but you were the one who quickens it to the minds and to the hearts of the people this morning father so lord I just want to come Lord if this is the last message I ever preached I want to do I want to do the best that I can I want to empty out nor God what you've laid on my heart I want to I want to show that this is a serious time and and Lord we want to take time to give you reverence this morning and Lord I want to respect your word with every fiber that's in me Oh God I mean not the toy with your word by any means I don't I don't mean to use it in any malicious way Lord God you know my heart I just want to be here and bless your people father as we read through this scripture this morning and through the different things and the thoughts that you bring to my mind my heart and and lord I pray that you would give me guidance to know what to speak and and when to close my mouth Lord God and and lord I just pray that you would help my spirit to yield when I needed you and lord I just want you to have preeminence this morning but father it's you that we want to see this morning and Jesus Christ name we do pray father we also ask that you would be with brother Jeremy Lord as he's ministering back at the home church and now Lord the first time that he's ministered outside his home church we just pray that you would give him strength and Lord ease he's mentioned that he's been real nervous and my lord putting our trust in you now I just pray that you you would do or he would do just that put his trust in you this morning that you would lead him and guide him and bless the people at the home church the Lord the Lord we're here this morning we want to concentrate and focus what's what's being said and what's being done and what's being led here father we give you praise and glory and honor and Jesus Christ name we do pray amen thank you may be seated and I'm gonna go ahead and get comfortable since this is the first time I've been been here oh now sent you off cordially oh you always treat me my family very well and it's wonderful to see familiar faces again hey man sir let's turn to John chapter 10 and verse 1 what I'd like to speak on this morning is accessing the door and John 10 verse 1 sometimes I go real fast so I'm gonna try and slow down today and I hope it's not too long I do have a lot of material but I just want to try to take my time no amen verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entered in by the door is the Shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by a name and leadeth them out does anybody ever wonder about that scripture because in our mind most of us here have been born in America and we have an American thought process we have an American culture that tends to if we don't research or if we don't have any kind of education on how they used to do things we look at it from an American standpoint and if you're born in the city you're really lost [Laughter] because if you don't it there there are a lot of people that have never seen a cow or a sheep or a goat or anything so they don't know the nature of those types of animals they don't know how to take care of those animals they don't know the work that goes into raising those animals they just don't know those aspects of it unless they do some kind of reading or they take a field trip out into the country and and speak to somebody who actually does the job they're not going to know so if we have the mind frame this morning if you read some background you get to see what the Shepherd does what a porter does now back if if they would have in the city or in the town they would have a Corral where shepherds could come and they would have a public place where they could water the Sheep or they would have a place to put the sheep so they can go in and and in the town and get whatever they need and then they can come back out and see the porter so the porter is pretty much the gate to the corral they would come and talk to the porter so the porter would recognize the Shepherd it's kind of like dry cleaning you ever take clothes to the dry cleaner you take your clothes in you get a little tag you go to pick up your clothes you got to give your tag to show that that's that's your property so the same thing the porter is not going to open up just to anybody he's going to have to recognize who the Shepherd is and when the Shepherd gathers his sheep he just the the Sheep just recognizes they recognize his voice so if another shepherd comes in or a stranger if he happens to get in they're not going to hear anyone elses voice but their Shepherd and that's how they gather their sheep and that's what this scripture is talking about the porter will open up to the Shepherd the Shepherd goes in and he calls his sheep they recognize his voice and they will gather unto Him only and only him there could be many voices going on but they're only going to go to that one voice and then when he gathers him up then they can go so that's kind of a background behind that verse for you you might know that already I don't know I don't know what you know and when he put it forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger they will will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what the things what things they were which he spake unto them then jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep now Jesus proclaimed several phrases of I am I was trying to research it yesterday but I I was going to try to count how many times it's between five and seven I can't remember something like that it might be six seven I can't remember but uh I didn't want to get distracted I had to get back on course sometimes you know how that is you start thinking about something well I'm not that's not my focus today so I have to I get derailed pretty easy when I'm studying but he said I am several times and then I think of one when he's talking about communion people often wonder about communion when he was talking about in the scripture where he said you must eat my flesh and drink my blood and and they were thinking of well this is vampire you know this now I can't think of what they cannibalize 'im but what did he say it in order to have eat his flesh he says I am the bread of life he says I am manna so he proclaimed that I am the bread of life and then you must drink my blood he says I am the vine you are the branches right so we kind of see his possessive stake there of what is personal to him of what authority he has but he here he's saying I am the door of the Sheep now in kind of going back with the corral in the in the town if they were out in the country they didn't have that Corral so he would have to the Shepherd we would have to make a makeshift Corral whether it be out of rocks and I think they typically use briars from the top so nothing would get in it's kind of like concertina wire on something that's being protected like a prison so nobody could get out I don't know if it's protected to keep people from getting in I don't know if I'd want to fight to get into a prison but as to keep them from getting out but what the Shepherd would do is he would lay in the doorway so that's why the Shepherd would become the door because the Sheep will not go in or out unless it goes through the Shepherd because the Shepherd becomes the gate so he says I am the door so he's in the doorway nobody you're not going to get into the sheepfold except through him he says I am the door by Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy he says I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly he says I am The Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd his life for the Sheep I'd like to talk a little bit about keys here for a minute does everybody know it a key is and what a key does a key allows access to what is locked out to others signifying that there is something valuable on the inside it's there's something worthwhile behind that door there's something worthwhile that you want to keep locked up to keep other people out of but it might also be something that would something that would be dangerous to keep unqualified people on as a maintenance mechanic I have we have special keys that allow us into what's we call it a TLB but it's a it's like a substation it's where we have our we control all of our power our high high-voltage power and if somebody unauthorised was to get in there they could they could cause devastation that if they don't know what their they're doing they could switch turn switches and push buttons and it would cause chaos for our product for our manufacturing it would cause interruption but if they're not wearing proper gear there's so much high voltage if they were to throw a switch it could cause harm and be fatal so there's there's also a restriction of why doors would be locked to to keep people safe it gives authority to person to a person to enter or to attain or receive there's no way no other way into my house if I if you don't have the key to my house you're not going to get in but if you do get in without my permission you are breaking in so that makes you a thief and a robber is that right now we have secret passwords or special code little knocks when you were younger you might do and you know the siblings you know which sibling it was and you say you can come in or or get away from me you know depending on which sibling you wanted to talk to hey I was a youngest so most times I wasn't let in because I didn't have that I didn't have the special special code my mind goes to judges where they were having that the the the battle I want to say it was JEP JEP though maybe but as they asked they were they were protecting the bridge and they were they were asking people if they wanted to cross the bridge well are you from such-and-such and if they said yeah they would tell him what you're gonna have to say say this word I think it was like a Shibboleth or something like that and they couldn't pronounce it so that's how they caught those people and they slew him you know they were trying to pretend to be somebody that they weren't and trying to gain access where they didn't belong but we have padlocks and we have locks now if you know how a key works I don't have one on hand but if you look at a key it has special little cutouts and when you put it in to the cylinder it has to meet a certain code you have tumblers on on the inside that are Springs spring-loaded so it's going to lift those tumblers to a certain code to give you access of that special key so if you look at your key you're looking at a code so just because your house key is not going to open a refrigerator key or a vending machine key because there are different types of keys your key to your diary is not going to open a bank vault right so you see the extremes and you see the the simple to the complex a diary lock is actually very easily picked to where a bank vault is very complex because they've had to they've had to make many advances in that because people were gaining it was so easy for people to get into it so they had to make it more complex now as I said a natural lock could be picked I highly recommend you leave here don't go buy a set of lock picks because if you carry lock picks with you and the police happen to pull you over talk to you and find out that you have lock picks you will be arrested because you are not allowed to carry lock picks unless you are authorized to do so whether it be a locksmith or or somebody else that has authorization carry lock picks because they are going to automatically be suspicious and think that you're planning on breaking into somebody's home whether you say I'm a Christian I wouldn't do that they're they hear all kinds of excuses they're not going to listen to it but so if somebody like I said if you broke into my house that makes you a thief and a robber so the natural types the spiritual if you were breaking in to somebody's house that means that you don't have authority to be there so jesus said if I am the door if any man comes any other way he is a thief and a robber and the same thing happens in the natural what happens if you break into somebody's house or you're somewhere where you don't have the authority to be you're probably going to get arrested and you're going to go where there are more locks and the same thing with the spiritual if you are where you're not supposed to be and I'm trying to think of that scripture where the the man went into the wedding supper and he didn't have the right wedding garment on he was kicked out of that wedding because he did not belong so if you try to get to heaven if you try to get to Christ some other way you're a thief and a robber amen so he also said that there were many before him and they were thieves and robbers because they were trying to portray themselves as something they were not they were not authorized that they did not have the authority to make that kind of a profession that there were many false christs I didn't say many false Jesus's but there were many false Christ's there were many false anointed ones that might look so pretty they might have looked like it fit the picture but not quite it was counterfeit it looked just like the real but it was not quite it might fit almost fit the code but not quite almost but not there but just because people say that they identify as something doesn't mean that they are that always remember watch the life of that person now having a key it might show authority to be somewhere to a specific a specific place of where you're trying to gain access but just because you have a key it doesn't mean that you have access like I was saying that there are special keys you have to have the right key with knowledge of how to use it I'm sure the little ones back there probably don't know how to use a combination lock there might be some other some adults here that don't know how to use a combination lock so you have to have the knowledge of how to use that specific key but there are many kinds of keys as we said of whether it's to a house or a church or to your car so we have that this might sound confusing for a minute but but let it sink in there false doctrines and false teachings there are false doctrines and right teachings there could be but it's not quite is that right there are right doctrines and there are right teachings there are right doctrines and false teachings so you can have false in the right but they have to come to a mesh they have to meet a certain code let me give you an example teaching on how to apply doctrine doctrines are your substance in order for us lightly divided the Word of God we need a right teaching let's see it a right teaching would be you need to be baptized that's a right teaching now you can have a wrong doctrine you need to be baptized in the name of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost that's a wrong doctrine with a right teaching now on the flip side on the other side you can have the wrong teaching of you need to be sprinkled in the name of Jesus Christ that's a wrong teaching right doctrine now we know you need to be baptized but everybody knows that baptize means to be immersed not sprinkled and immersed fully surrendered fully covered fully cleansed all the way so we need to have right teaching with right doctrine you have to meet the right code to access where you're trying to go amen some people believe that there are many paths of God in it but the scripture says and I can't help I don't like to call names but I can't help it I was watching something I think it was Oprah Winfrey and she was talking about yeah because I I ended up finding it somehow I saw the video this guy at work was talking about well there are many paths your cultivating your spirit and there are many paths that I happen to see the same thing now it had to have been the Lord because I had no idea Oprah was doing that and I just happened to see the videos like the next day so the Lord had it showed me this and uh that's where that man got that teaching from because he said the exact same thing Oprah did and so and I'm going down to her Habitrail there is this guy was and he believed in the power of the spoken word because we talked about that many times because he was saying you have to watch what you say because it might come to pass I said I agree with you he says you know I believe he could speak something and I wholly agree with you but then he got into this where you got a cultivate your spirit and and there are many paths to God have wait a minute know that that's where we will not have fellowship yeah that that's where we kind of draw the line because that's false teaching now he was telling this girl this woman that I work with he was telling her the same stuff and I was telling her I said don't listen to that I said that's Oprah Winfrey preaching right there and he got mad at me because he confronted me because she told him what I said I said that yeah well it's true she said you don't know how do you know I got that from Oprah I said because after you told me I saw a video she said the exact same thing so you had to pick that up from somewhere you know and then and that's what we have is people that are imitators they don't get a revelation of what it is they take what somebody else says but I encourage you to find out for yourself you don't have to do your researching you have to open the door it's you that's keeping the door shut or your opening it's you that has to have it give him the access you can't go off with some other man's teaching you just can't do it so faith is a key and Christ as the doors all right but I can hand out a different key to each person it may unlock something somewhere but that's its purpose that key was designed to do that to open something somewhere but it was specific to it to a specific lock cylinder or padlock or or whatever it might be but be careful what you're trying to access there's a key to the Quran there's a key to Mormonism there's a key to Satanism there's a key to magic there's different keys to get into these so be careful what you're trying to put your key in because when you look away from Christ it might fit into something else that you somewhere that you don't below but there is only one combination that's going to fit correctly to eternal life is that right Jesus Christ is the only way then we have spiritual keys the key is held in a hand that unlocks the door it does not turn by itself and brother Branham talked about a microphone this microphone by itself does nothing until I speak into it and even if I'm speaking into it there has to be a receiver to it so there are many combinations to get my voice out to a speaker it's just sitting there by itself it is useless just like a key in somebody's hand it's useless until they go to apply it faith isn't faith until you go to apply it but that is your part so you're there's more of an active part to being a Christian than what you thought right our hands hold the key of faith jesus said that he is the door By Me If any man enter in he shall be saved but you must have faith to believe that he is and a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him otherwise he is nothing to you we could see that a key could be referred to as his faith and uh which revelation excuse me if faith is a revelation and revelation will give us the authority to to unlock spiritual doors the more you read scriptures and pray and meditate the more you learn from God now see man can teach you can sit in a classroom until you're blue in the face or until you fall asleep but it doesn't mean anything with that man teach and unless you are an active listener and paying attention to what that person is teaching again there's something that you have to do that's something on your part that you're responsible for that nobody else can do it for you man can't give a revelation you have to pray to God for that revelation man cannot give that revelation it's God that gives that revelation amen but when you get ahold of revelation it gives you access to God and all of his attributes but we do not stop at faith faith does not stand alone you are not complete with just faith there is more to gain to attain perfection 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 5 everybody ok this morning 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 5 it says and beside this giving all diligence which means focus and hard work add to your faith so like I said faith does not stand alone something needs to be partnered with faith he says add to your faith virtue virtue is moral excellence and modesty and purity and brother Brando said also said that virtue is strength because when the woman touched Jesus he said I perceive virtue went out of me that was strength that went out of me there went out of him and brother branham had the same thing when people would touch him that they would have access that and in when he would have all the visions and different things he said virtue went out he got weak and to virtue knowledge getting deeper into the word and to knowledge temperance which is self-control see all these things have to mesh together to meet a certain code into temperance if you don't have self-control how are you going to have patience and patience means endurance constant a stability if you don't patience it's going to be easily you're gonna fall away easily amen you must have patience so you're not carried about with every wind of doctrine something new that comes up you hear Joel Osteen say something that just sounds so flower flowering so beautiful I've never listened to him preach so I don't know but even in the message rang she might have some people that make it sound so good and you don't go research it you're going to be carried away with that it's happened it's happened to even strong men ministers we're not immune we're no better than than anybody else sitting in the church so into patience godliness and guide leanness is holiness holiness and reverence and to godliness brotherly kindness which is love of the Brethren right brotherly kindness is it just to the people that you go to church with sometimes that that's a tough one you mean I gotta love that guy that just smacked the side of my car yes he said love your enemies those that despite despitefully try to use you or abuse you and to brotherly kindness charity which is affection and benevolence but add to your faith you say you have faith sometimes we have a hard time just just getting to faith but yet we want to be at the statue of a perfect man we want to hit that that pinnacle that that pyramid but we can't get past faith and that's what we're supposed to do this brother brand speaking he says and that's what we're supposed to do is reflect the Son of God and now we're supposed to do his work he said he that believeth on me Saint John 14 7 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ because it gets to be so miraculous it can't be man it becomes so spiritual so supernatural that it can't be man it has to be something on the inside projecting on the outside hey man Jesus on the inside working on the outside you know people want to get clean up on the outside first or just trying to get people to the law of the letter you got to look like this you got to look like that you got to do this how about getting on the Christ first Christ will take care of that amen I fully believe that I fully believe that but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us now there's the trouble we find those things happening you know it I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrapheap of Ministers Wow of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church and myself wow that would put a firehose on a lot of people's doctrines and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church and he said and myself and I feel the same way this morning and myself I'm here to learn - I don't know everything how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God now I want to say I want to believe that everyone here as they mature Christian I don't want to take that away from anybody but even brother Branham this was in 62 so he was very well experienced very well versed in his Christian walk he was very well established and he still says we're here to learn and myself that's that's really saying that did you catch what I said he's even saying the prophet of God he's saying that he has to learn - isn't that something so think of yourself a little bit more and a little bit less you got to have the right balance yes right when somebody tries to tell you that you're nothing you're something because you're brought by the blood of Christ now I was going to preach a fascist I am nobody but yet somebody I'll try not to get into that one this morning I'm going to try and stay focused but how how many would like to be that he says the dwelling place of the Living God where we can't be so proud and saying well I'm already there we still have to have that openness about us to say that there is more of God to be had is that right if you desire more of God there's more of God to be had that desire has to be there because we have not come to full maturity yet we have not come to full perfection not yet but we're getting there we're shaping we're learning we're experiencing this is the place of making mistakes we're going to make mistakes but don't lose heart it's okay we have an advocate with the father now here is what we do what's the first thing he says have faith and be born again how many is born again amen that's lay the foundation so you got a good good step right there you've laid the foundation if you've been born again truly born again then after we lay the foundation secondly you add to your foundation he says add to your faith Peter said first you have faith then you add virtue to faith this is the next column first pour your foundation faith then to your faith add virtue now right here there knocks a lot of us down yes sir and virtue to faith that doesn't mean just living a virgin life you know like the woman or a man and so forth that doesn't have anything to do with that the Bible said we read over here in the Book of Luke where it said virtue went out of him excuse me if we're going to be like him we must have virtue then we must have it to be like him the first song that I ever loved in the hymns one of the greatest was to be like Jesus well if I'm going to be like Jesus I've got to have virtue and then it could pass forward from me to the people from me to the people from you to the people you're still in this you're not counted out you're still in it you still with me amen because virtue went out of him to the people virtue and before you can let it out you have to have it first if you haven't got it it won't come out this is something simple that he's saying but this is a nugget inside of here inside of this man Wow there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone tried to draw a virtue out of a and the check would return insufficient funds see he says no there none there to draw from the check bounced somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner oh my not much virtue can be drawn from that he says virtue must be in us then we get true virtue or then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall not the next foundation it's the next foundation wall because you're building there's already foundation laid there's no sense of making another foundation the foundation is already there he says now first you must have faith faith alone won't do it Peter said then add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add it to your faith now how many people were counting how many times we said this or that I read this that you have to have faith and virtue and you must advert you to faith amen how many so that's stressing that point that you must have it in order to give it you know people act like they're they're more mature than what they really are and I think of preteens because preteens tend to do that because they're getting older that sounds like chuckles of experience I was there too right I know what I'm doing nobody needs to tell me I got this yeah I'm old enough I'm responsible enough you know you use yeah you you think you know it all and and that's the problem is that they think they're more mature than what they actually are they think they're an adult instead of a teenager where I'm growing up now I need to be treated like an adult but yet you still act like a little child in order to be treated as what you want to be treated as you must act that role you want to be treated like an adult act like an adult and that goes for some adults out there I've met a lot of childish adults I don't mean to laugh on that but I work with a lot of but but getting serious you know I'm kind of going down another rabbit trail brother branham said that there's a spirit on on every nation he talked about America having the spirit of haha I think I might have talked about this one of the other one of the recent times that I've been here he talked about America having the spirit of haha the spirit of laughter joking all the time and I find that to be absolutely true absolutely true now I like to laugh I like to joke or era laughter I think is good medicine but sometimes it goes a little too far sometimes it goes a lot too far but there's a time that we have to buckle down and be serious living a Christian life is not a joking matter amen it's serious so if we expect people to respect us as a Christian we try to build a reputation and we must act the role we want people to be saved you must act like you care I don't want you I'm not saying pretend that you care but you have to be in that role of caring for somebody it kind of hits home a little bit doesn't you say you say you say you say you want people saved we need people to come to church I feel so that guy is so lost he has no hope are you presenting hope are you presenting virtue are you presenting faith temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness are you presenting these types of things I have to check myself to a man because sometimes I get a little carried away like I said I like to joke around brother Branham had the same issue he'd have to go in the closet and repent Lord I'm sorry for joking around so much and and getting caught up and getting carried away so yeah it happens to be the spirit of this nation and people always have to have a good time you ever notice that they've always got to go out and have a good time somewhere they have to have that entertainment constantly before them I better get off that at it but when they when a preteen acts like that they're getting ahead of themselves just like when we're trying to put the other attributes in front of faith or you're putting the cart before the horse so to speak you're not there yet you need to attain such-and-such first before you can get here before you can you can't be fully developed until you get personally develop if a fetus has to become an embryo first right but some people are missing that very key element and wonder why they can't get closer to God everything else is built upon faith when you have faith then you can mature and you can move on to the next level of virtue and we should be living in a place people you've been coming to church for a while how many have been born-again for less than a year less than a year less than five years less than 10 less than 20 we're about the same time I thank brother we're right around the same the same time that was a wonderful move of God at that time brother Simon brother Jesse brother brother cam brother Tim Myers you know just at our church we had a few and just the explosion of the move of God my goodness I was that was outstanding but about the about to cry but just seeing the sovereignty of God just when people just when people think that God isn't moving anymore just just think of that time brother and when when people were thinking that God wasn't moving we want to see God move and people were we're praying we want to see a move of God and then they see an explosion of many and most of them have become ministers a lot of them have become ministers and people that you were around is that right brother a lot of them had become ministers myself and included so don't lose heart keep praying we might have another one before the Lord before the Lord returns who knows but we should be in a spot those that have been matured a little bit I could forgive you less than a year no but we should be in a spot if we've been in this for a little while we've had our experiences we should be in a spot to where we should be able to combat the thoughts of the devil right away we should be able to recognize the move of the end me amongst us you should know well that's not going to benefit I'm staying away from that you'd repent and go the other way turn and go the other way shun the very appearance of evil a man but don't spend so much time talking to Satan himself because time spent conversing with him is time not spent with God it is time taken away it's time take it away from the romance of your husband now those of you that have had boyfriends girlfriends those that are married now how would you that what do you think how do you think your spouse would feel if you're writing an ex-girlfriend or an ex-boyfriend to tell them that you don't want to talk to them anymore but you keep sending letters and you keep calling to tell them to stay away from you or I don't and they're saying I don't want anything to do with you you're the one who keeps calling how would you think the spouse would feel if you keep conversing with an ex you're divorced from old Satan yeah you're divorced from him you don't have to talk to him don't spend time conversing with him well you know you remember what you did to me back years ago and you know I'm changed now you know you remember this no don't talk to him don't give him the time of day the only time you should talk to here is when you say get thee behind me that's the only time you should be talk to him now there are some songs that are dedicated to and I wasn't going to bring this up but there are some songs that are dedicated to Satan by Christians and they spend the whole song communicating to Satan I know what they're trying to do and that's a good thought but why give the time to him give the time to God give your time to God converse with God spend time in the word you don't have to talk to him slewfoot that's that's why I was trying to think you don't have to talk to him amen but like I said spending time with him is time not spent with God when trials come we should be in a place where we could kick the the prison doors open and say you're not going to hold me bound anymore I'm coming through this I'm over coming through I'm overcoming there think of that as a rerun of Samson you know the promise was given to us you shall possess the gates of your enemy just think of that as a rerun you don't have to be bound by the enemy you don't have to be bound there Amen talking a little bit about more of Keyes everybody okay this morning anybody sleepy no I'm really not but if I was sitting there I probably would be yeah a lot of times I just sit on my off button yeah I just tend it if I sit still I tend to fall asleep so wake up Matthew chapter 16 and verse 17 just feels a little warm in here Matthew 16 and 17 this isn't and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that now art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it verse 19 says and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so he described what a key was you loose it here you open it here or you shut it up or you bind it there so he's saying that Peter you have the keys to the kingdom of heaven and whatever you he didn't say whatever I approve of that you say he says whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now see even even a man that had his own sinful shortcomings let's see this is where you where you come in to even though you have your shortcomings even though you have folks and failures he can still use you God still has a love for you you're not left in a sinful condition when there's when you've repented when you've made sorrowful repentance now this talking about Peter going back to Peter when he got the keys this is before his conversion Jesus later told him when he was converted to strengthen the Brethren Jesus said you won't enter the kingdom of heaven unless you are converted is that right that's Matthew and in 18 except ye be converted and you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven is that right so even Peter in his sinless condition received or excuse me in a sinful condition not sinless in a sinful condition received the key to the kingdom of heaven now there are keys to the bottomless pit which is mentioned in revving to cover those I'm not going to focus on those today but in Revelation 9 and in Revelation 20 talks about the key of the bottomless pit and and holding Satan bound amen but revelation 1 in 18 Jesus says I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and death now if you notice Peter had the keys to the kingdom of heaven Jesus had the keys of hell and death now when Jesus rose on the third day he did not have the keys to the kingdom of heaven did you know that he said I have the keys to death and hell but not to the kingdom because there had been given to Peter now he said Peter whatever you loose on earth I'll loose it in heaven what you bind on earth I'll bind in heaven now here he stands with the keys to open up this blessed thing to the world and here he's got the keys in his hand and they're asking what can we do to be saved no matter what the Apostle said to do God has to recognize it in heaven if he gave him that authority now Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is alright and that's the reason the keys turned your sins excuse me and that's the reason the keys turned in heaven to any other name throat's getting a little raw and that's the reason the keys turned in heaven to any other name any other way any other form it turned on earth and it turned in heaven or Jesus didn't keep his word to Peter and every place in the Bible they was baptized after that they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and those who were baptized before that had to come and be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ to get the Holy Ghost that's correct it still runs the same now I believe Peter was an example of our potential look what he was able to do he he had the faith he received the key keys of the kingdom of heaven he was able to walk on water how many have walked on water in their life ever I haven't done it I'd like to do it but I haven't gotten to that point forced and then to try to walk on water but he was in a spot where he was so close to God the Apostles had such a closeness and a likeness of Jesus that people were even they were one to call them God because they saw God's attributes in them now whenever people were calling them God where did they say oh yeah you got that right yep that's me no they said see you don't do that I am NOT him John the Baptist said don't you do that I'm not the one you seek the angel said don't do that I'm not him there's only one that you're gonna bow to and I'm not it that's the humility to give God his place amen not trying to take his place but being joint heirs with him you still don't take his place amen now the key of David in Revelation chapter 3 and verse 7 it says into the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth this is important here and shutteth and no man openeth did not Jesus say that I am the door I am the door he's the only one who's going to open that door and he's the only one that's going to shut that door amen for he's the Good Shepherd he'll let the Sheep know when they can go out and he'll let the Sheep know and they need to come back in now where did this scripture come from this is in line in continuity with Isaiah chapter 22 and verse 20 it says and it shall come to pass in that day that I will call my servant II like him the son of Hilkiah and I will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and I will commit my government into his hand notice it was committing a government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder where shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open and I will fasten him as a nail in a short place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons in that day saith the Lord of Hosts shall the nail that is fastened in the short place be removed and be cut down and far and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the Lord hath spoken it boy this sounds like the crucifixion and the resurrection amen but there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good and as fine as it may be but you will find the sum total the sum total of all perfection in Christ in Christ everything everything everything fades into insignificance beside him say I like the songs that lift him up those are the songs that I like those are the songs that I can really rejoice in those are the songs that I get into worship in I like the victory songs I like that but I know my favorite ones are the ones that lift him up those are my favorite ones but he that had the key of David this beautiful phrase follows and comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true he that is true Christ the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization here it is Moses was a prophet of God but Jesus like unto Moses and just like as the brass serpent was lifted up so shall Jesus be lifted up is that right and was it not said that a prophet should be raised up likened unto Moses but Moses was prophet Moses was a prophet Jesus was the prophet of God the prophet of God David a man after God's own heart was king of Israel but Jesus is the gray David king of kings and Lord of lords God very God how many believes that this morning amen now David was born of the tribe of Judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the showbread reserved for priests he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as king he sat on the throne he was a prophet he was a wonderful type of Christ and we read Isaiah 22 of and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church what the key of David signified at that time is mere shadow which is now fulfilled and Jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men did y'all catch up and is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone anybody else know Muhammad no Budda no none of them Peter James done any of the disciples brother branham you Satan absolutely not amen for him opens and shuts and no man has that right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does shorter had to do with it read Isaiah 9:6 it says and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government should the government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east remember we're not looking at it with an American mind frame we're looking at it from an Eastern mind frame not a Western mind frame formal wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and the scripture goes back in and says that wives submit to your own husband's not to somebody else's husband to your own husband oh my are you his and only his hey man and that beloved and that's why I say don't spend your time talking to the other guy that's why I say talk to God go to God alone with your problems he's the one who's taken the burden for you not some other man not some other God but he and he alone amen and that beloved is the key of David oh my anybody ever wonder when there was a Keith David well it's right there Christ taking his place as groom as husband and declaring the responsibility for his bride amen the responsibility is upon his shoulder not anyone elses God being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come under her on her own he died for her he lost her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts he accepts the obligation gladly accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sara called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight if you want to know where I got this information it's in the church ages chapter 8 the Philadelphia and church age I didn't reference some of the other quotes that I've read but if you're wanting to know I'll give it to you or you could look it up because y'all are supposed to check me right if something sounds that doesn't sound right okay that's where he found that or the other way brother we got something to talk about you said such-and-such here I don't find that exactly to be to the message you know and and there's a way to go about that you know but reading through there about the the key of David when brother Jesse first invited David and I out I was thinking I was thinking even before why I sure would like to to preach Beulah land and no because I preached it at the home church and many of you know that I don't I don't get on the website I don't especially if I know I'm if brother Jesse invites me I do not go on a site I do not I so I don't know what ministers have been through I don't know what they preached on and I do that for a reason but it just so happened here a little bit ago y'all had brother Keith Randolph here and if all the messages I I choose to listen to your Eddie had Beulah land preach to you because he say well there goes that one I gotta find another way [Laughter] and he did a great job that's the first I've ever heard of brief brother Keith ran off and he did a fantastic job because he went through everything that I had there was nothing for me to bring to you nothing nothing different he did a wonderful job but I can't help I can't get away from from that reading about the key of David and Beulah so y'all know y'all were schooled how many were active learners that day and picking up what he was saying Beulah means to be married correct and it that's a found in Isaiah 62 and verse four it says thou shalt no more be termed forsaken amen neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate amen but thou shalt be called Hephzibah in thy land Beulah for the Lord delighteth in thee as Hephzibah I'm not a scholar I think that's the way is pronounced Oh for the Lord the lighteth in thee and thy land shall be married oh my the key of David our husband and knowing what he's done for us oh my praise God it's really wonderful just get into the word you want to you want to have more of him well you've got to look you've got to you've got to access it amen but faith isn't in just saying that you're a Christian or going through the motions to become one it's a way of life it's not being able to abide by all the rules and regulations and bylaws and the whatnot so how do you know you'll be going to heaven how do you know you're gonna go to heaven any one of us but how do you know that you are part of the Bride you don't know for sure or you don't it's you're waiting for this big glamorous explanation to come out and you're waiting very patiently but you don't you don't know for sure but you claim it by faith and faith is you just know it's something you just know is right you don't have a detailed description well this is how you did this is this is this and this and this some things are just by faith you just know there's something on the inside that says I have that assurance I have met the requirements of the road map that's been laid out in front of me I have met those requirements and God is obligated brother Branham said if he did it one time he's obligated to do it another time you meet the same requirements amen what does the scripture tell us the just lives by faith amen praise the Lord I'm gonna go ahead and close I have more here but and I just feel we'll go ahead and close Psalm 68 and verse 18 says thou has to send it on high thou has led captivity captive thou has to receive gifts for men yay for the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell among them blessed be the Lord who daily loaded us with his benefits even the god of our salvation Selah he that is our God is the god of salvation and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death amen oh just the key if a can it can open so many opportunities so many opportunities but you have to by the key in the right way it has to mesh or dovetail it has to go together to work if he's ins four and four it says there is one body one body and one spirit even as you were called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism how many gods one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ but there is one door to salvation to liberate man from his sin one door to peace one door to heaven there is one door to healing I am THE LORD thy God that heals all thy diseases blessed be the Lord who daily loaded us with his benefits even the god of our salvation amen you know I know I said I was gonna close in the Old Testament in Exodus when the Death Angel was to pass there was a requirement of the people of Israel to perform is that right there was a certain way that they had to do something and it was the decree went out if you do it this way you and your house shall be saved if you do it heartedly if you don't do it at all if you don't follow my instructions that that Death Angel has authority to come into the house and wipe out anyone it wants to so you are giving the death angel or the evil spirits you are giving them access if you don't follow the instructions laid out before you amen amen amen that Death Angel could only access that house if that key was not applied correctly it's the only way he was going to enter into that house please God oh my you can go ahead and stand your feet close with this quote of brother Branham this was found in the key to the door he says and if there is such an evil as polio diphtheria smallpox yellow fever tetanus lockjaw and so forth you know those were common years ago because they didn't have anything the men of science the men of Medicine didn't find that key of knowledge to combat it but somehow they found that key and applied the key to eliminate that from man if being as as brother bran toccata as being inoculated with the vaccination these evils have been able to fight day and night but like I said until they found the inoculation from it because it's evil it's a killer how much more see these men spent time staying up day after day were pursuing it day after day to find the vaccination of these diseases because their goal was to combat evil their goal was to overcome that evil that killer of these diseases that was their goal as mere men but how much more he goes on to say how much more is there a key to salvation for a man that's imprisoned in the house of sin there is a key to that door to liberate men from it oh my let me feel that they've had something taken from that the devil has taken your joy taking your family your loved ones what do you think it's time to take it back instead of sulking at it and saying well I don't have this anymore I just don't have the joy I don't have the means to oh my lord speak to me now this is to me how many just don't have that desire to to worship God as they used to how many don't have that that desire to walk and the way they should how many have had something taken from them well it's time somebody say it's time it's time it's time it's time to take back it's time to be like little David and go back and get get the belongings that were taken going to take the Y's back that we're taking that we're stole from it's time to take captivity captive it's time to stop sitting on the bench sitting on the sidelines watching things happen to your family what did things crumble before you it's time to stop sitting around waiting and watching things happen waiting for something else to take happen or something else to happen we nits in our power to open the door or shut the door it's within our power to let Christ in it's within our power for letting the evil spirits in it's within our power to open or shut it's within our power of what we're entertaining it's within our power of what we're reading of what we're holding before us it's within our power what we're saying it's within our power of our tempers if we can't without our temper it's within your power to have that self-control oh my I know we're I know I said we were going to close but I just feel something now it's within us how many people how many of you feel that it's it's right there it's just right on the verge of being stripped away from you you don't have to let that happen you know Jesus said that I give you power to tread over scorpions and serpents I've given you that power to overcome that but that's not where your joy lies your joy lies where that your names are written in heaven so it's great that we can have control it's great that we could overcome he said those seventy came back and they were rejoicing that they were that they had power over those spirits and it sometimes I think we forget that we forget that we had that key a key has the power to unlock as well as lock and we forget that it has the power to lock Satan had his demons out we had that power if you had that que you had that power so where do we waiting on what are we waiting on what are you waiting on what am I waiting on what are we waiting on it's within your reach take the hand of faith and use that key amen accessing the door jesus said I am the door to the Sheep no man can come in unless I say so no man comes by me unless I allowed Oh My yes yes bar his ass more Amen Lord God truly is the quote that was written this morning when brother Branham said that we are here to learn and he included himself Lord I also include myself and I just I just know your spirit was talking with me Lord Lord if I'm going through the same situation somebody else here must be going through the same surely believe that you had held it to come out now Lord I don't believe that we go through things just to go through things but there is a purpose behind me Lord I know that you have a purpose there's a purpose there's a reason why we came today and spoke on what you wanted us to speak on this morning I just want to ask a question do you find yourself wondering why you're not receiving from God and I ask the same question to myself why am I not receiving from God [Music] I think something would be wrong within us if we didn't ask them when we're going through the trials and the tribulations it seems like things are crumbling around us there would be something wrong within us if we didn't come to that conclusion that something is wrong I'm not in the state of where I used to be of when I was up on the mountain the Lord if somebody's going through the valley rest assured we know that there's a way to the top of the mountain to have a mountaintop experience again the Lord just because we're in the valley doesn't mean that we lose faith it just means that we're being tested we're being tried and I just thank you for giving me putting me in the right mind frame the other day I was telling brother Jesse about it just seemed like everything was going wrong in the morning but that didn't mean I had to quit just because things weren't going right I still had to go through my day I still had to go to work I still had a fulfillment to make and the same thing with our walk this morning we don't have to stop becoming being Christians because we're having some trials things aren't going right that's what makes a soldier right lord that's what makes us soldiers as soldiers of Christ [Music] you find yourself questioning does God really exist [Music] Gideon often wondered something similar if God before us where are all the miracles if God before it's not everything as a as a sunshine good day there are rainy days and stormy days but I thank God for that blessed assurance that we continue on to know that you are and that you are a rewarder of those that diligently seek you thank you thank you Jesus Lord those that might be struggling today I heard a request for brother Jose for for healing in his body lord I know in the past when I've been here before we pray for the same thing healing in his body or his wife's body or we're healing in somebody else's by Lord of a surety through my own experience know without a shadow and now that you are a healer I know that you are a healer I know that you could raise Jose I know that you can heal him in his body right now and just that brother any other brethren sister in here [Music] might have a financial situation where it looks bleak wondering where the next paycheck is gonna come from I don't know your situations here but there is one that knows that situation there might be one suffering persecution in the walk of life this morning but rest assured we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to give strength to bear through that persecution this morning there might be one questioning this morning if they're saved it might be one question do I really have the Holy Ghost there might be one question am I going to make it heaven I'm not going to make it to him Lord only you could set these straight in the hearts of your children this morning only you could truly answer your child this morning there might be somebody here wondering what's the use of continuing on I feel like giving up oh [Music] lord give them the strength and the courage to pick up to know that we could fall seven times but we can rise an eighth there's one to give us strength to continue there's one to pick us up there's all that have the experience of comin that had the meat they've gone through the situation's before there's there's ones at that experience they could drop the meat of the word they could grab the meat to those that are gone through their struggles the Eagles that are going through their struggles [Music] there is a light there is a light where Jesus said I am the light of the world there is a light if you wonder if there is a light if there's a way out there is a way up for he said that I am the the truth the life and the way he is God he has got alone amen thank you Lord Jesus I don't know why I went the way that I went this morning they after sometimes I guess I just don't know how to close but I would it be sensitive to the spirit I had a picture in my mind of a different kind of a closing but it's not in the way that I wanted to go rest assured Jesus is here God is here God is able to deliver Lord we call your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen and holy are you Lord we just worship you this morning we give you praise you're worthy of it Oh God Lord we are blessed just to be able to speak your name off of our mortal lips we are blessed we are blessed in this hour to be able to understand your word as you give the revelation to us we are blessed people give us that faith that we need help us to get the right start give us the virtue help us to have the right building under that the next step help us to have the knowledge of the patients and the temperance and the brotherly kindness and help us to reach that blessed charity help us to reach the goal father thank you Lord Jesus I [Music] apologize if it seemed strange in the way I've closed me to do it that way but again it's not me does anybody need prayer this morning there you have two affray with you let's sing that that song there's not a friend like the lowly Jesus there's not a friend like the lowly Jesus no not one no not one no one is healed all our souls no no no [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
