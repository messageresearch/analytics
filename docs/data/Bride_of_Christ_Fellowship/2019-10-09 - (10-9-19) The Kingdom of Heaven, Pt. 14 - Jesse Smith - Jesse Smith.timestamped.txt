[17:34] service on Sunday at 2 p.m. it's a
[17:36] little how the ordinary but we just have
[17:39] kind of don't have much time to travel
[17:41] there so we'll have just one service at
[17:44] 2 p.m. on Sunday by God's grace it's
[17:47] kind of like our fall wheat time to get
[17:48] away and just have a little bit of a
[17:50] rest by God's grace so my work gives us
[17:54] two days off so it's like a four-day
[17:55] weekend so we're trying to take
[17:57] advantage of that and get a little rest
[17:59] so that's the Sunday one service this
[18:01] Sunday by God's grace
[18:04] also remember we have special meetings
[18:06] in November first second third we'll
[18:09] have a service Friday night I'm not sure
[18:12] the time yet I don't know if we'll do

[18:19] service on Sunday looking forward to
[18:21] those meetings by God's grace few
[18:24] testimonies maou is for my wife first of
[18:27] all we want to thank God for protecting
[18:29] our little cat he got bit on the head by
[18:31] what we think was a coyote he's very
[18:33] sick and injured yesterday God allowed
[18:35] us to get him to a vet yesterday and
[18:38] he's doing much better so thank the Lord
[18:40] for that praise God
[18:41] second my wife said I've had stomach
[18:44] pains for over a week every time I eat
[18:46] sometimes quite severe it's getting
[18:48] better and so I want to thank God for
[18:50] being my healer even as the work is
[18:52] still in progress
[18:53] I know it's finished in his and then I
[19:00] had a few weeks ago we prayed for one of
[19:03] my co-workers he's a 45 year old man
[19:05] he was having eye trouble and he was
[19:07] talking to one of kids about praying for
[19:09] his or for the the child's dad and he
[19:12] just announced in front of everybody
[19:13] he's like ya mr. Smith pray for me
[19:14] couple weeks ago and I'm feeling so much
[19:16] better now so even in public schools
[19:21] people talk about prayer and so we're
[19:23] thankful we have a real special
[19:24] community and I think the Lord for that
[19:26] is just wonderful to have that type of
[19:28] fellowship so thank the Lord for His
[19:30] grace and mercy God is so good there's
[19:33] only one healer that's Jesus Christ amen
[19:35] but God lets us intercede and do our
[19:37] little part in prayer so we're thankful
[19:39] for that one prayer request that says
[19:41] for my wife please pray for our
[19:43] neighbors mom she had a double stroke
[19:45] following a surgery and is only able to

[34:54] our peace amen thank you Lord when we

[35:08] and to receive for your correction and
[35:11] your truth and your joy your peace we're
[35:15] too large for all you've done
[35:19] take tonight Lord bless the preaching my
[35:22] world Lord minister to every heart
[35:23] that's our visitors more that's the home
[35:25] church Lord god I just pray Lord your
[35:28] spirits like to open up to the book of
[35:55] Matthew chapter 18 I think Lord willing
[36:00] we might finish the the kingdom of
[36:02] heaven series here tonight
[36:05] it's been a wonderful series that's been
[36:08] it's been great to preach on new
[36:12] subjects you know I've never preached on
[36:13] before and see the revelation behind
[36:16] them and that gives us overwhelming
[36:18] power because the gates of Hell cannot
[36:20] prevail against Revelation praise God
[36:23] so let's take our scriptures here
[36:25] Matthew 18:21 so in Lord winning tonight
[36:29] we'll look at two the last two parables
[36:31] on the kingdom of heaven the myrrh the
[36:33] unmerciful servant and the laborers in
[36:35] the vineyard
[36:37] so Matthew 18:21 for their say Amen
[36:48] verse 21 then came Peter to him and said
[36:51] Lord how oft shall my brother sin
[36:53] against me and I forgive him till seven
[36:56] times jesus saith unto him I say not
[36:59] unto thee until seven times but until
[37:02] seventy times seven therefore is the
[37:07] Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain
[37:09] King which would take account of his
[37:13] servants and when he had begun to reckon
[37:16] one was brought unto Him which owed him
[37:17] ten thousand talents but for as much as
[37:21] he had not to pay his LORD commanded him
[37:24] to be sold and his wife and his children
[37:25] all that he had in payment to be made
[37:27] the servant therefore fell down and
[37:29] worshiped him saying Lord have patience
[37:32] with me and I will pay thee all then the
[37:34] Lord of that servant was moved with
[37:36] compassion and loosed him and forgave
[37:38] him the debt but the same servant went
[37:42] out and found one of his fellow-servants
[37:44] which owed him a hundred Pence and he
[37:47] laid hands on him and took him by the
[37:49] throat saying pay me that thou ow'st us
[37:51] and his fellow servant fell down at his
[37:53] feet and besought him saying have
[37:55] patience with me and I would pay thee
[37:57] all and he would not but went and cast
[38:00] him into prison till he should pay the
[38:02] debt so when his fellow servants saw
[38:04] what was done they were very sorry and
[38:06] came and told unto their Lord all that
[38:09] was done then his Lord after that he had
[38:13] called him said unto Him o thou wicked
[38:15] servant i forgave thee all that debt
[38:17] because thou desirest me shoulda snow
[38:20] I'm sorry should us not thou also have
[38:23] had compassion on thy fellow servant
[38:25] even I as I had pity on thee and his
[38:30] Lord was wroth and delivered him to the
[38:31] tormentors till he should pay all that
[38:34] was due unto him let's all read verse 35
[38:36] together ready one two three so likewise
[38:40] shall my Heavenly Father do also unto
[38:43] you if ye from your hearts forgive not
[38:46] every one his brother their trespasses
[38:49] amen God
[38:51] busting zarina's word may be seated
[38:52] praise God quite a sobering parable how
[39:02] many could say amen to that
[39:03] quite a serious sobering thought here
[39:06] Lydia I do have a few slides here by
[39:08] God's grace quite a serious thought and
[39:14] we want to just look at these like we
[39:16] said we're about two more by the grace
[39:17] of the Lord I just prepared a few quotes
[39:21] to go along with the the scriptures here
[39:23] we'll look at tonight and then Lord
[39:25] willing we'll be moving on to the next
[39:28] series or finishing the other series let
[39:30] me say a little timer here so I can
[39:32] control myself
[39:33] all right the kingdom of heaven I
[39:35] believe this is part 14 if I'm not
[39:37] mistaken by God's grace and our text was
[39:41] the unmerciful servant but like I said
[39:42] we'll probably get to both of them we've
[39:44] looked at the sixteen parables and we've
[39:46] seen how we got to be stewards faithful
[39:48] stewards and even tonight you can see
[39:51] the scripture how again Jesus is
[39:53] mentioning stewardship because he said
[39:55] every servant must give an account so
[39:58] we're all gonna have to go through the
[40:00] decades of our lives you know when we
[40:02] stand before Jesus and give an account
[40:04] of what we did and I'm thankful to say
[40:07] that I give my I want to give my days I
[40:09] want to give my weeks months I want to
[40:11] give my decades I want to give my life
[40:13] time to Christ praise God I want that to
[40:15] be the account that I give praise God
[40:18] and so the talents the pounds and the
[40:21] four grounds they're all show
[40:23] stewardship and time conditions we've
[40:25] seen the wheat and the tares and the net
[40:27] cast in the sea Jesus specifically says
[40:29] those are for the end time conditions
[40:32] praise God Jew and Gentile we looked at
[40:34] those recently the wicked husbandmen and
[40:37] the great supper
[40:38] shows how Christ went to the Jews first
[40:41] and then the Gentile and we looked at
[40:43] sin how sin is like a little small
[40:45] mustard seed but grows into something
[40:47] great
[40:48] for the RAM said that was the false
[40:49] church and then the leaven hid in three
[40:51] measures it's no doubt the Roman
[40:53] Catholic Church with her trinity dogma
[40:55] and then the Holy Ghost in the rapture
[40:58] the king's son the ten virgins and the
[41:00] seed cast into the ground Sunday night
[41:03] we looked at the treasure in the field
[41:05] and the pearl of great price so Lord
[41:08] willing tonight we'll look at the labors
[41:10] in the vineyard and the unmerciful
[41:11] servant all right now I want to preach
[41:15] on this and I have a few quotes on
[41:16] forgiveness now a lot of this will be
[41:18] review but one thing we want to remember
[41:21] church is that even the most seasoned of
[41:24] Christians always need to keep a tender
[41:28] heart because at any time Satan will try
[41:30] to get a foothold through what we call a
[41:33] complex the Bible calls it strongholds
[41:36] praise God in 2nd Corinthians chapter 6
[41:38] but no matter how seasoned you are
[41:40] whether you're just a brand-new
[41:42] Christian and the message or you've been
[41:44] in the message 10 years I'm coming up on
[41:45] 20 here pretty soon by God's grace but
[41:49] no matter how long you've been in the
[41:51] word Satan always has a way to get in he
[41:55] always prevents he's always allowed to
[41:56] have one punch at you
[41:57] and so as we serve the Lord we got to
[42:00] make sure our hearts stay humble and
[42:02] we're quick to forgive praise God and
[42:04] that's why we know of course Jesus had
[42:07] forgiveness in the daily prayer the
[42:09] Lord's Prayer amen now in this parable
[42:12] we we see Christ stressing the necessity
[42:15] of forgiveness it's an absolute
[42:17] necessity and Jesus gives this parable
[42:22] in response to Peters question about how
[42:25] often he should forgive his brother
[42:27] Peter tries to be spiritual like we
[42:29] would be and say well perhaps seven
[42:32] times you know sevens the number of
[42:33] completion right but Jesus says no 70
[42:37] times that praise God or in other words
[42:39] an unlimited number of times praise God
[42:42] so in the parable the certain king
[42:44] represents the Heavenly Father who
[42:47] compassionately and freely forgives a
[42:49] servant that owes him one sorry ten
[42:52] thousand talents now remember we looked
[42:54] at the other parables remember we looked
[42:56] at this parable and the talents a tale
[42:59] of gold was almost a million dollars
[43:02] about 700 thousand dollars right
[43:04] the town of silver was much less but the
[43:07] town of gold was almost a million
[43:09] dollars so if you had ten thousand times
[43:12] a million I'm not even sure how big that
[43:15] would be praise God probably getting to
[43:18] the billions
[43:18] if not trillions so in other words if
[43:22] this if this if these are ten thousand
[43:24] talents of gold we're talking about an
[43:26] insurmountable amount of debt praise God
[43:30] and so that shows that our sin debt is
[43:33] great in God's sight
[43:36] none of us could ever dream of undoing
[43:38] the wickedness we've done praise God we
[43:41] can never undo it you know the the
[43:43] reason is because as soon as we would
[43:44] make up for little things then that same
[43:47] day we would do it some more
[43:49] praise God and then to make up for that
[43:52] I think of a man you know men often
[43:54] battle you know with lust of the mind
[43:56] right think of the adulteries men might
[43:59] have in their minds now or women now
[44:01] women today it affects women as well you
[44:03] know with adulteries and everything like
[44:05] that can you imagine having to undo that
[44:07] you know just undo that and then what
[44:11] about lying what about seeing what about
[44:12] murdering and just wanting people to
[44:14] have the Vengeance of God upon them the
[44:18] Bible says you can be have a you know
[44:20] the Bible says that there they have a
[44:22] wrath against people without a cause
[44:25] sometimes people get so jealous they'll
[44:27] get wrathful and they don't even really
[44:29] have a cause for that person - nothing
[44:31] against them but they're just jealousy
[44:33] right they're just jealous and so think
[44:35] about the insurmountable debts that
[44:38] could be built up and as soon as we get
[44:40] it paid off we fall back into it amen so
[44:44] in other words this is an
[44:47] uninterruptible debt we can never do
[44:49] we've done such damage against the
[44:52] holiness of God and in this parable the
[44:56] forgiven servant healy begs for God to
[45:00] forgive him and God does but then he
[45:02] comes around to a man that owes him just
[45:05] we'd say a hundred talents or one
[45:07] percent of the debt he was given and
[45:09] this shows how how unfair humans are
[45:13] they love to be forgiven they love grace
[45:16] but they don't like to give grace right
[45:19] we love to receive grace Oh God forgive
[45:21] me Oh God thank you Lord we rejoice in
[45:24] the grace but then we have a hard time
[45:26] forgiving others and extending the same
[45:28] grace to them and that's the human
[45:31] nature that we
[45:32] got to battle and we want someone to
[45:35] repay us right away we demand it no you
[45:38] can't make a mistake you've got to make
[45:39] it right right now but we want God to
[45:42] give us time to make it right oh god I
[45:45] can't make it right today give me grace
[45:47] to make it right next week and God will
[45:50] God is merciful praise God God's very
[45:53] merciful but then we in our sin our
[45:56] human humanity and our sin nature that
[45:58] is within us we want we expect people to
[46:01] make everything right instantly now it
[46:05] manifests often with us when we know
[46:07] with with denominations we expect
[46:08] denominations and sometimes we look down
[46:10] at the pond denominations if they don't
[46:12] believe the word insulate our friends or
[46:14] family if they don't believe it
[46:16] instantly we look down upon them but
[46:17] we've got to learn to have compassion
[46:19] upon them praise God we've got to learn
[46:21] to have patience praise the Lord now the
[46:24] fellow servant begs for patience but the
[46:26] first servant refuses and has him cast
[46:29] into prison when the King hears the
[46:31] injustice the first servant is brought
[46:34] before him in Wrath and declares him as
[46:36] wicked so church let's understand what
[46:39] God is saying God is saying it's wicked
[46:41] for us to enjoy mercy but not give mercy
[46:44] that's a wicked thing it's not just well
[46:47] it's my weakness that I battle it's not
[46:51] just that it's actually a deeper thing
[46:54] it's a deeper selfishness where Jesus
[46:56] calls it wickedness when we can't extend
[46:59] the same grace to others who might sin
[47:02] against us and so the King gives him
[47:05] torment until the ten thousand talent
[47:09] debt is paid which of course represents
[47:11] a sentence in the lake of fire right
[47:13] because the to pay that would take years
[47:15] and lifetimes and upon lifetimes so it
[47:18] represents the lake of fire sorry I'm
[47:22] still even though I got this coffin I'm
[47:24] doing better than last week amen now
[47:26] Jesus says so likewise shall the
[47:29] heavenly father do also unto you if you
[47:33] from your hearts forgive not every one
[47:36] of his brother their trespasses okay so
[47:40] we see it's got to come from the heart
[47:41] now in this case the heart means the
[47:43] emotions praise God so your heart
[47:47] your emotions because the Bible said
[47:49] when you're saved you have a new heart
[47:51] because when you're first saved you're
[47:53] not born again in the soul yet you just
[47:55] got a new heart or you got new emotions
[47:57] toward God before you had a stony heart
[47:59] away from the things of God but when you
[48:01] get saved it's like all of a sudden you
[48:03] come soft towards Jesus amen and you're
[48:07] given a new heart well we have to have a
[48:08] new heart towards those who sin against
[48:11] us say Amen
[48:12] and he says you must do it from your
[48:14] heart praise God
[48:17] so brother Branham says that you know he
[48:19] says it in the message desperation he
[48:21] said if you've got a temper he said you
[48:23] got to pray and ask God to soften your
[48:26] temper right so prayer so it's in prayer
[48:30] that we'll learn to forgive from our
[48:33] hearts and I've seen it recently you
[48:34] know recently I was talking about that
[48:35] there was two people in particular I was
[48:37] having trouble forgiving so I went in my
[48:39] prayer closets for about a week and I
[48:42] just said their names Lord I forgive
[48:43] so-and-so I forgive so-and-so and I
[48:46] didn't feel it right away but eventually
[48:48] I started feeling it and I feel it
[48:50] tonight I feel that I've forgiven them
[48:52] although they've sinned against me and
[48:54] maybe they never even ever you know
[48:56] today those two have never even come and
[48:58] said sorry to me but that's okay I told
[49:01] him about it but if they don't have the
[49:03] grace to come and apologize face-to-face
[49:04] that's okay well one thing I know is
[49:07] that Jesus freely forgave me so I can
[49:11] freely forgive them and I've learned to
[49:13] do it from the heart praise God
[49:16] it's got to be from the heart it's good
[49:18] you have to feel it
[49:20] amen now this parable is only found in
[49:24] Matthew never find it in any other book
[49:26] of the Gospels but Jesus is found with
[49:30] the same kind of principle in the Sermon
[49:32] on the Mount in Matthew 5 I'm sorry
[49:34] Matthew 6:14 and 15 during his fight and
[49:38] also during the final week of his life
[49:40] in mark 11 so we see these same
[49:42] principles where Jesus and both of them
[49:44] will say if you can't forgive others if
[49:49] you can't forgive others then the
[49:50] Heavenly Father can't forgive you we
[49:52] know there's multiple witnesses of this
[49:55] so we would say it's a major thing to be
[49:59] able to forgive your
[50:00] mieze it's not a minor thing because as
[50:04] Jesus says your salvation hinges upon
[50:06] this new heart if you can't forgive
[50:09] someone as sin against you then you're
[50:11] not really even saved praise God because
[50:15] Jesus says if you can't forgive them
[50:17] from your hearts then he says then you
[50:20] will not be forgiven of the Heavenly
[50:22] Father so see forgiveness is at the very
[50:27] hinge of salvation it's part of that new
[50:29] heart experience now don't get me wrong
[50:31] some people been hurt so badly the Bible
[50:33] says a wounded spirit who can bear
[50:36] especially with sexual abuse and verbal
[50:39] abuse and physical abuse all these kind
[50:42] of abuses especially when someone's an
[50:44] innocent victim
[50:45] that the abuse is so deep and the person
[50:49] may have a heart for Christ and so if
[50:52] they truly are saved then they really
[50:54] forgiven the person but the the the
[50:56] issue is that they've been hurt in their
[50:58] human spirit their human spirit has been
[51:02] wounded but a man said you get scarred
[51:04] in your human spirit it's a scar and so
[51:07] it's very hard to bear and you can be a
[51:10] genuine Christian genuinely saved but
[51:13] yet in your mind it doesn't feel like
[51:16] you've forgiven them like we've been
[51:18] dealing with a little counseling in the
[51:20] church recently and we've come up to
[51:22] some of these issues and the person no
[51:25] doubt is saved
[51:26] no but but the pain is so deep that it
[51:29] takes years and years and years to deal
[51:32] with those kind of pain because it is so
[51:37] deep and it's marked upon the human
[51:40] spirit praise God so I want to make sure
[51:43] we say that that that some pains are so
[51:47] deep it you you forgive the person but
[51:50] you live with the pain many times for
[51:52] decades if not your whole life you know
[51:59] I mean
[52:00] some examples like brother branham okay
[52:03] you know when he tells his life story
[52:05] and he tells about his first wife and
[52:07] child dying he'll start crying because
[52:10] he he connects that to his mistake of
[52:13] not going out to the Pentecostals right
[52:16] away and so he feels the guilt for that
[52:19] and so he'll cry and has to deal with
[52:22] that right had to deal with that and so
[52:26] we see one clear example there and yet
[52:28] God could give him grace to kind of deal
[52:31] with that right but the pain of that
[52:33] will probably never go away in this case
[52:36] in that case he has to forgive himself
[52:38] praise God and that's the one where
[52:40] Satan gets a lot of people especially
[52:42] the message they can forgive other
[52:44] people but the Satan will give them such
[52:46] a guilt trip they can't forgive
[52:48] themselves and that's a heavy weight to
[52:51] bear with the manes true church as as
[52:56] human as we are as fallible as we are
[53:00] many times in a shameful as we are the
[53:02] truth remains the same the Bible says
[53:04] cast your cares upon the Lord for he
[53:08] cares for you praise God Paul had to
[53:11] live with that pain his whole life
[53:12] member of holding the coat of Stephen
[53:15] the first martyr he had to live with
[53:17] that pain his whole life but he didn't
[53:19] let it get him down he let it motivate
[53:21] him to work more for Jesus amen the
[53:25] Bible says when we sin the Bible said
[53:27] when we obey we're supposed to take
[53:29] vengeance upon the devil and so that's
[53:31] what we've got to do if it's our
[53:33] mistaken if it's our guilt we've got to
[53:35] use the vengeance the holy vengeance of
[53:37] God and say Lord I know you forgive me
[53:40] of that I'm gonna use that as motivation
[53:42] I'll never do that again and I'll work
[53:44] more for the kingdom of God it'll be the
[53:47] grace of God working with me amen see
[53:51] that's where Satan will attack us
[53:53] because he puts a guilt trip on us
[53:55] we're like it was our fault somebody
[53:56] didn't get saved or it's our fault we
[53:58] didn't witness or it's our fault this
[54:00] happened to our children or it's our
[54:02] fault now some of these things may be
[54:04] true but the reality of it is we got to
[54:06] be like Paul if we confess our sin we've
[54:08] got to let the past stay in the past we
[54:11] got to forget the things in the past and
[54:13] forward toward the mark of the high
[54:15] calling in Christ Jesus that's got to
[54:18] become a reality to us where we stopped
[54:20] looking or stop letting Satan let us
[54:22] look in the rearview mirror we got to
[54:24] say God forgive me if you need to go
[54:25] back and make something right with
[54:27] somebody do it and I don't care if it's
[54:29] 30 years down the road do it and so you
[54:31] could have some peace in your heart and
[54:32] move on with God and say in your heart
[54:35] that I know I've cast this burden onto
[54:38] the Lord I told you that one time
[54:42] the one of the biggest condemnation is I
[54:44] had as a Christian was that when I was a
[54:45] teenager I went up to my cousin and I
[54:48] said well I kind of made fun of him
[54:50] because his parents got a divorce
[54:51] because my parents had not been divorced
[54:53] you know my cousin was picking on my mom
[54:55] me and my friend and I said what and I
[54:58] said so it's evil words I said well at
[54:59] least I have a dad that's what I said to
[55:01] him it was really awful I never should
[55:03] have said it and he immediately dropped
[55:04] his head he was way much bigger than me
[55:06] he immediately dropped his head and
[55:07] walked off in the cornfield I didn't see
[55:09] him you know he he just hid out there
[55:10] and I became a Christian later years
[55:13] down the road I'm talking maybe five
[55:14] years down the road and I never got over
[55:16] that and so one day I was at a football
[55:18] game my brother's football game and I
[55:21] was a Christian I was like this is the
[55:23] moment the Holy Spirit brought it back
[55:24] to me this is the moment you can make it
[55:26] right
[55:26] and so I did I pulled him out of the
[55:29] stands I said hey can I talk to you real
[55:30] quick and he's like oh no never even
[55:33] forget about it forget about it he said
[55:35] it's okay I forgive you that you know I
[55:37] didn't think anything of it but I know
[55:39] in my heart I felt better and then I
[55:41] know he started treating me better after
[55:43] that and that was a great weight that
[55:46] could be lifted off my shoulders because
[55:48] of my own sin my own filthiness and I
[55:51] confess it and that's just one example
[55:53] where when you have the opportunity to
[55:55] do right let's do right amen
[55:58] well you got the opportunity so there's
[56:00] so there's no chance for regret regrets
[56:02] later on when Satan's trying to give us
[56:04] mine battles because you know he's gonna
[56:06] give you mine battles amen but you gotta
[56:08] cast down those mind battles and you got
[56:10] to win the greatest battle ever fought
[56:12] amen hallelujah praise God so Christ
[56:18] wants us to understand all sins
[56:21] committed against us by others pale in
[56:23] comparison to the sins we commit against
[56:25] God
[56:26] right that's what this parable teaches
[56:29] that what a hundred talents is just one
[56:32] percent of the ten thousand talents that
[56:34] the guy owed praise God I can't forgive
[56:37] somebody one percent of the hundred or
[56:39] one percent of what I was forgiven I
[56:41] can't even give one percent oh come on
[56:44] we ought to be able to forgive now some
[56:47] of them will be harder some of them will
[56:48] take longer but the Bible says with God
[56:50] all things are possible amen with man
[56:53] it's impossible but with God all things
[56:56] are possible amen hallelujah they're all
[56:59] possible hallelujah so we got to believe
[57:01] that we got to confess that we got to
[57:03] devote some time to prayer for these
[57:05] things amen see too many times we leave
[57:09] these things on the shelf and we just
[57:10] become a punching bag - Satan can I get
[57:12] amen
[57:13] say we just let Satan beat us up week
[57:16] after week month after month year after
[57:17] year but church we can do something
[57:19] about it we can go to the Lord in prayer
[57:22] and we don't have to be a slave to Gil
[57:25] look be a slave to shame or to fear or
[57:28] bitterness we don't to be a slave to any
[57:30] of that because we have a kind Heavenly
[57:32] Father who mercifully and faithfully
[57:35] forgives if we confess our sins he lets
[57:38] us walk right back in the light amen and
[57:40] we confess our sins he's faithful and
[57:42] just to forgive us of all
[57:44] unrighteousness amen praise God
[57:47] now forgiveness is so important Jesus
[57:50] put it in the daily prayer of the Lord's
[57:52] Prayer it's the model prayer in Matthew
[57:56] 6:12 and forgive us our debts as we
[57:59] forgive our debtors
[58:02] now here's what struck me here's what
[58:03] the Holy Spirit put on my heart as I
[58:06] study this we are supposed to look at
[58:08] ourselves as sin debtors in other words
[58:11] I owe a debt I'm a debtor right because
[58:16] every day says pray this so we wake up
[58:19] we should say mine I've done wrong
[58:21] against God I owe God an apology now see
[58:26] now once we've asked God sorry then we
[58:28] can be free from that but every day it's
[58:31] built into the Lord's model prayer not
[58:34] that we just recite it religiously like
[58:35] Catholic or something like that but
[58:37] there's nothing wrong with reciting the
[58:38] prayer if you want to pray that to God
[58:40] wrong with that brother Bram does it on
[58:41] tape numerous times but the point is God
[58:45] tells us to humbly possess a debtor's
[58:48] mindset so we forgive those indebted to
[58:52] us see it's easier to forgive other
[58:56] people that have sinned against us if we
[58:58] got the mindset that I owe somebody -
[59:02] right if you're constantly thinking my
[59:05] eye oh I gotta make this Ryder I owe the
[59:08] Lord my if we got the right attitude not
[59:11] not the guilt like Satan puts on an
[59:13] extra kill but just the reality right
[59:15] the reality that everyday Jesus says
[59:18] pray this forgive us our debt
[59:21] Lord I'm indebted to you there's
[59:23] something healthy about that can I get
[59:25] an amen to the head there's something
[59:27] healthy about waking up in the morning
[59:28] say my forgive me my debts Lord I'm
[59:31] indebted to you I owe you my life amen
[59:35] I owe you my energy I owe you my praise
[59:39] I owe you my strength I owe you my soul
[59:41] aim ahead I do I owe you everything
[59:44] praise God I'm indebted to the Heavenly
[59:46] Father see that's the reality
[59:52] it's a God designed debtors mindset and
[59:56] this produces not guilt but it produces
[59:59] gratitude and mercy
[1:00:01] rather than hopelessness see it produces
[1:00:05] thankfulness that's why we pray it right
[1:00:08] forgive us our debts Lord as I forgive
[1:00:12] those who sinned against me that
[1:00:14] produces confidence in God that God I
[1:00:17] know because you've forgiven me I can
[1:00:20] forgive others praise God see it
[1:00:23] produces this debtors mindset but not a
[1:00:26] negative don't leave here you know
[1:00:28] beating your that Satan beat you up but
[1:00:31] just the reality of it like that's why
[1:00:33] brother RAM say we can't pray up he said
[1:00:34] we just can't prep every day we got to
[1:00:36] pray up every hour he says see that's
[1:00:39] why he would say that because we got to
[1:00:41] realize he would say we got to check up
[1:00:43] every hour see so that's the that's the
[1:00:47] reality Lord am i pleasing you right
[1:00:51] brother Ram says when you become a
[1:00:52] Christian you don't get rid of pressure
[1:00:54] he said you add pressure he said because
[1:00:57] you constantly wonder am i serving the
[1:00:59] Lord or not am i pleasing to Jesus
[1:01:02] there's something healthy about that
[1:01:04] I'll say like this that brings humility
[1:01:08] when you're constantly wondering am i
[1:01:10] pleasing your Lord have I made a mistake
[1:01:12] have I missed the mark when you're
[1:01:14] wondering that now you can't let Satan
[1:01:15] take it too far
[1:01:16] but it's healthy to examine yourself to
[1:01:19] check up on yourself and make sure
[1:01:21] you're serving God in the right spirit
[1:01:24] that's a healthiness or else why would
[1:01:27] Jesus put it in the prayer every day say
[1:01:30] lord help me to forgive others as I'm
[1:01:32] indebted to you forgive me my debts see
[1:01:37] that keeps us humble right each day I
[1:01:39] owe a sin debt either I was prideful I
[1:01:41] thought I was better than somebody or I
[1:01:45] was lustful I want covetous I wanted
[1:01:48] something that shouldn't wanted I was
[1:01:51] mean right spiteful angry bitter see
[1:01:55] every day I do something that causes me
[1:01:57] a debt in the sight of God I gotta say
[1:01:59] God forgive my debts and I'll forgive
[1:02:02] other people amen every day it's not you
[1:02:07] know easy to teach us to pray so it's
[1:02:09] every day we take this mindset of I'm a
[1:02:13] sin debtor now in our flesh right
[1:02:16] because the Bible says the soul doesn't
[1:02:18] sin amen
[1:02:19] right remember first John that beautiful
[1:02:22] book about love and eternal life the
[1:02:24] Bible says the soul doesn't sin so your
[1:02:27] your nature doesn't sin but it's in your
[1:02:30] mind and your humanity where you sin so
[1:02:33] to recognize Lord I'm in debt because of
[1:02:35] that I made a choice in my mind I didn't
[1:02:39] go down and ask the soul first I didn't
[1:02:42] pray about it before I said that and the
[1:02:44] church said see that's why we're guilty
[1:02:47] because we're the ones are giving free
[1:02:48] more agency we can check in first and
[1:02:51] pray first and ask God first should I
[1:02:53] say this or not and we fall short of
[1:02:56] God's glory and so Jesus makes it a part
[1:02:59] of the daily prayer he wants us to
[1:03:03] always remember how much we're forgiven
[1:03:05] so we can extend that same forgiveness
[1:03:07] to others
[1:03:08] and Jesus promised I love this in the
[1:03:10] beyond sees Matthew 5:7 blessed are the
[1:03:12] merciful for they shall obtain mercy
[1:03:16] brother Graham says it too it's better
[1:03:18] to err on the side of mercy right then
[1:03:21] judgment err on the side of Mercy
[1:03:24] because blessed are the merciful for
[1:03:27] they shall be shown mercy praise God
[1:03:32] so this parable we can clearly see the
[1:03:35] power of forgiveness now I wanted to
[1:03:38] show this with the stature of managers
[1:03:40] of the court I found today of course I
[1:03:42] preached it before but this is from
[1:03:44] statue River man now 60 let's add the
[1:03:46] Bible said it brotherly kindness now
[1:03:48] that's a good one right here the six and
[1:03:50] then the seventh alright adding
[1:03:52] brotherly kindness all right when you
[1:03:53] get to that brotherly kindness put
[1:03:55] yourself in his place on the matter so
[1:03:58] see when you've got brotherly kindness
[1:03:59] the the the character trait of Christ in
[1:04:03] your life when God has added that to you
[1:04:05] now you can put yourself in somebody
[1:04:07] else's shoes and you can stop being so
[1:04:09] selfish stop thinking about yourself and
[1:04:12] you can see someone else's perspective
[1:04:14] well I can see how that would hurt my
[1:04:16] wife's feelings I can see how that would
[1:04:18] hurt my husband's feelings seekers you
[1:04:20] can put yourself in somebody else's
[1:04:21] shoes right he said my brother sinned
[1:04:25] against me said Peters I forgive him
[1:04:26] seven times a day really kindness now
[1:04:30] you see I'm sorry no he said Jesus seven
[1:04:33] times seventy see brotherly kindness now
[1:04:34] you see if a brother's all out of tune
[1:04:36] don't be impatient with him see no sir
[1:04:39] be kind to him go anyhow just a simple
[1:04:43] thought there but remember on the sad
[1:04:45] forever man brotherly kindness is the
[1:04:47] last step before charity so that proves
[1:04:51] Jesus will not give somebody the Holy
[1:04:53] Ghost until they've got brotherly
[1:04:56] kindness until they can treat the rest
[1:04:58] of his body the right way
[1:05:00] praise God he's not gonna put the CEO or
[1:05:04] the cap on that person so he's not gonna
[1:05:06] quicken that soul with the baptism he's
[1:05:08] not gonna seal that soul until that
[1:05:10] person is gonna treat others the way
[1:05:12] they want to be treated forgiveness just
[1:05:15] common forgiveness we say where we say
[1:05:18] uncommon forgiveness because Christians
[1:05:20] aren't very common these days
[1:05:22] so an unusual Holi style forgiveness
[1:05:27] from real Christians praise God amen
[1:05:32] see kingdom citizens right in the
[1:05:36] kingdom of heaven Kingdom citizens keep
[1:05:38] their hearts or grounds free from every
[1:05:40] life-sucking root of bitterness see
[1:05:43] bitterness just sucks the life right out
[1:05:45] of a Christian it tries to spring up in
[1:05:48] their hearts the Bible says but through
[1:05:51] prayer Christian's daily wean their
[1:05:53] hearts and cast their cares upon the
[1:05:55] Lord putting away all bitterness let's
[1:05:58] go to a scripture briefly let's go to
[1:06:00] Ephesians 4:31 and 32 I might as well
[1:06:04] just use my Bible app here it's just
[1:06:06] love a little bit faster to Ephesians
[1:06:08] 4:31 hope everybody couldn't see it to
[1:06:16] let all bitterness see all not some of
[1:06:19] it all of it see make sure all the
[1:06:23] bitterness towards that person is gone
[1:06:25] all of it so that when you see a picture
[1:06:29] of them you'll try to smile now try now
[1:06:33] in the intense ones God don't expect you
[1:06:35] to smile like that if it's super intense
[1:06:37] and you've been hurt but you have to
[1:06:38] forgive them all the way and Church the
[1:06:43] thing to do is just say it with your
[1:06:44] lips say it with your lips and then God
[1:06:45] will make your body and your mind obey
[1:06:47] your confession right he's the high
[1:06:50] priests of your profession we've got to
[1:06:53] start professing it and then God will
[1:06:55] bring it to reality let all bitterness
[1:06:59] and wrath and anger and clamour and evil
[1:07:01] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:07:02] malice see all of it
[1:07:05] now why would Paul say all if it wasn't
[1:07:07] possible see it's possible Church is
[1:07:10] possible Amen it's possible to put all
[1:07:13] of it away
[1:07:13] and be kind one to another
[1:07:17] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[1:07:19] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:07:21] forgiven you now that just stirred my
[1:07:23] mind here I forgot about this let me
[1:07:24] pull something up real quick let's watch
[1:07:27] this video real quick here's a man who
[1:07:29] really had forgiveness
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:40] sorry so this is about brother
[1:07:42] mike.mccluskey he goes to brother kam
[1:07:46] Church he was shot he was a sinner he
[1:07:49] was shot in the back by a cop on purpose
[1:07:52] and he won the he won the court date and
[1:07:55] he couldn't forgive the cop until Simon
[1:07:58] introduced the message to him and then
[1:08:00] he heard his father-in-law preach on
[1:08:02] forgiveness and then he forgave the man
[1:08:03] in tears and weaping and you're gonna
[1:08:06] see it right here this is a real example
[1:08:09] of forgiveness and I told brother miking
[1:08:10] this numerous times I said brother I
[1:08:12] believe on the day of judgment you will
[1:08:14] be one of the examples of true
[1:08:15] forgiveness in other words Jesus will
[1:08:18] use Mike and that time he'll raise up by
[1:08:20] that wheelchair cuz right now he's still
[1:08:21] paralyzed in a wheelchair I believe at
[1:08:23] that time he's gonna rise them he'll
[1:08:25] have a new body praise God and he may
[1:08:27] get that before the rapture amen
[1:08:29] hallelujah he was once an angry man he
[1:09:02] talks about that he was so upset at that
[1:09:04] cop he hated that cop
[1:10:42] amen praise God that beautiful that's a
[1:10:47] real modern-day example that brother
[1:10:49] went to many denominational churches and
[1:10:51] he can never understand forgiveness
[1:10:52] until he came to the message hey hi
[1:10:55] there yeah that's right
[1:10:57] and then he heard his father-in-law
[1:10:59] preach on true repentance and
[1:11:01] forgiveness and that caused him to go to
[1:11:04] that man and forgive that police officer
[1:11:06] and then he did that in front of
[1:11:07] everybody that was after Simon done so
[1:11:10] many Bible studies he received baptism
[1:11:11] serpents eat everything and then he come
[1:11:13] to the message church he was faithful
[1:11:15] and then he received it and I believe
[1:11:16] God will use that man on the day of
[1:11:18] judgment against all those who said I
[1:11:20] couldn't forgive somebody shot me
[1:11:21] somebody they took my ability to walk
[1:11:23] and God will raise up that man and say
[1:11:26] but he forgave by the power of Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ love and he's still in a
[1:11:33] wheelchair he's been in wheelchair since
[1:11:34] the 2009 or 2008 he's still in a
[1:11:37] wheelchair and he's forgiven that man
[1:11:40] and so see that's the power of God's
[1:11:43] love praise God see Christians put away
[1:11:47] all bitterness and they do it for
[1:11:49] Christ's sake and did you notice he said
[1:11:51] that person deserves it
[1:11:53] praise God
[1:11:55] each person deserves to be forgiven see
[1:11:57] because you are giving you because we
[1:11:59] were all given a hundred percent amen
[1:12:01] so so if God's forgiving us a hundred
[1:12:04] percent then we should be able to
[1:12:06] forgive somebody one percent right they
[1:12:11] deserve it because we've been forgiven
[1:12:13] of so much we they deserve to be given a
[1:12:15] tiny amount even if it's taken your
[1:12:19] ability to walk away from you see that
[1:12:22] proves me really glad the power of this
[1:12:24] message he couldn't find it in any other
[1:12:26] Church he couldn't find it anywhere else
[1:12:29] but when he come to this word it was
[1:12:31] like it was unveiled it became a
[1:12:33] revelation hey I didn't praise God it's
[1:12:37] a reality of it amen see that's the
[1:12:40] power of this word holds because it's
[1:12:42] the true Word of God the true revelation
[1:12:44] of what the Bible teaches freely
[1:12:47] forgiven and I got his whole testimonies
[1:12:50] gonna watch it's on our church YouTube
[1:12:52] channel it's about 30 minutes long it's
[1:12:54] a beautiful testimony God and I even put
[1:12:57] on there I even put on there the video
[1:12:58] of the actual moment he got shot he had
[1:13:00] his hands up like that and that the cop
[1:13:02] did it on purpose and he was going to
[1:13:04] get all kinds of jail time he was gonna
[1:13:05] get like 10 or 20 years but Mike just
[1:13:07] forgave him totally he just forgave him
[1:13:10] totally not that mandates our one day of
[1:13:12] jail time for purposely shooting a man
[1:13:15] in the back that's the power of God's
[1:13:18] forgiveness my now let's go the the last
[1:13:23] parable I hope that's a blessing let's
[1:13:25] go the last one Matthew 20 verse 1
[1:13:34] Matthew 20 verse 1 now this is a very
[1:13:38] familiar parable probably to most of us
[1:13:41] its verses 1 to 16 so this is the
[1:13:45] parable of the laborers in the vineyard
[1:13:48] and most of us I'm just gonna we're not
[1:13:50] gonna read all this but I'll reference a
[1:13:52] few of the scriptures now the revelation
[1:13:54] of this parable is that eternal life is
[1:13:56] the reward God gives to all who labor in
[1:13:59] his kingdom that's a revelation no
[1:14:02] matter what the circumstances God gives
[1:14:04] eternal life to all of them
[1:14:07] now this parable magnifies God's equity
[1:14:11] or his fairness because he gives each of
[1:14:14] his servants a just reward for their
[1:14:16] labor Isaiah describes God as a just God
[1:14:21] and Savior I believe God's fair amen he
[1:14:24] is isaiah 45:21 says that he's a just
[1:14:28] God and Savior he's wholly fair our God
[1:14:33] fairly deals with mankind in every age
[1:14:35] and he's seeking Labor's in his kingdom
[1:14:38] Paul says the same thing he says is
[1:14:40] there unrighteousness with God god
[1:14:42] forbid amen in other words God is never
[1:14:45] gonna mistreat you he's never gonna
[1:14:47] mistreat me we can trust God he's fair
[1:14:50] he the Bible said every temptation is
[1:14:53] common unto man we're not the only ones
[1:14:55] that have gone through this somebody
[1:14:57] else has tasted this bitter cup if we're
[1:14:59] tasting a bitter cup praise God somebody
[1:15:02] else has gone through the same similar
[1:15:03] thing and much harder probably than we
[1:15:05] have and we can't feel sorry for
[1:15:07] ourselves we got to remember that God is
[1:15:09] just and fair and there's a rewarder of
[1:15:12] all those who diligently seek Him amen
[1:15:15] that's right so Jesus in the parable is
[1:15:19] the householder he hires Labor's for his
[1:15:21] vineyard at the first hour of the day
[1:15:23] and he agrees on their wages and then he
[1:15:26] goes out the third hour the sixth hour
[1:15:29] and the ninth hour and then he makes one
[1:15:34] last hire at the 11th hour so it looks
[1:15:38] like it's for calls now to me
[1:15:41] I'm not certain on this because I don't
[1:15:43] have a quote on this but I believe those
[1:15:45] four representing the four anointings of
[1:15:47] the church ages the lion the Ox the man
[1:15:52] the Eagle because mode RAM does say we
[1:15:55] are the 11th hour workers he doesn't say
[1:15:56] that he said the bride the end time
[1:15:59] bride is the 11th hour workers praise
[1:16:02] God and he says that because World War
[1:16:04] one ended in the 11th month in the 11th
[1:16:06] hour so remember that's what program
[1:16:09] says we are the 11th hour workers and we
[1:16:12] have the Eagle anointing amen so that's
[1:16:16] what I believe now everyone at the
[1:16:19] conclusion of the day the 12th hour the
[1:16:22] labors come to Jesus for payment the
[1:16:25] last laborers are paid first receiving a
[1:16:29] penny when the first hour workers are
[1:16:32] paid the same amount they murmur against
[1:16:34] the householder but are rebuked because
[1:16:37] God's initial contract agreement was
[1:16:40] kept the householder even says hey I'm
[1:16:44] lawful he said I'm good he says he's
[1:16:46] good remember Jesus said there's none
[1:16:48] good but God so this householder has to
[1:16:52] represent God because he says don't you
[1:16:54] know I'm good can I do with can I do
[1:16:56] with my money what I want to do with my
[1:16:58] money
[1:16:59] who are we to tell god what to do with
[1:17:01] his money who are we to tell god what to
[1:17:04] do with the vineyard right he can do
[1:17:07] whatever he wants he's God but the
[1:17:09] reality was he kept his word he kept
[1:17:12] this contract God always keeps his word
[1:17:13] amen
[1:17:14] the main lesson church is that some
[1:17:17] Christians labor longer than others and
[1:17:20] go through much more difficult
[1:17:22] circumstances yet eternal life is a
[1:17:26] reward for all faithful Labor's the
[1:17:29] first our workers work 12 hours how many
[1:17:33] worked a 12-hour day before I've done it
[1:17:36] a couple times I don't like it very much
[1:17:38] it's not very fun so some of them work
[1:17:42] 12 hours and had to work through the
[1:17:44] hottest heat of the day
[1:17:47] but yet the eleventh hours you and I
[1:17:50] live with our workers we do one simple
[1:17:53] little hour and the Sun setting and the
[1:17:57] temperatures decreasing at his lowest
[1:18:00] god help us and yet they both get the
[1:18:07] same reward praise God
[1:18:09] they all get the same reward they'll get
[1:18:12] a penny now I preach this a few years
[1:18:15] ago I'm sorry a few weeks ago in passing
[1:18:16] but let's compare this here let's
[1:18:20] compare the workers let's compare them
[1:18:22] for the amount of time they worked
[1:18:24] let's compare Stephen the first martyr
[1:18:25] mention him earlier and john the divine
[1:18:28] the Revelator history says Stephen was
[1:18:33] stoned in a t-34 when he was 29 years
[1:18:36] old
[1:18:38] 29 where were you at 29 really Glenn
[1:18:41] yeah were you saved yet no I I got saved
[1:18:50] at what 19 I got saved in nineteen so
[1:18:52] okay two years after that Wow Wow two
[1:18:56] two years my goodness hallelujah praise
[1:18:59] the Lord this month two years Amen
[1:19:01] hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus
[1:19:04] Alleluia amen glory my so Stephen was 29
[1:19:13] when he died for Christ but during his
[1:19:19] one-year the Bible said he was empowered
[1:19:21] the Bible said he was full of faith and
[1:19:24] power and he did great wonders and
[1:19:27] miracles amongst the people oh my he so
[1:19:31] he had a one good hour of work amen he
[1:19:33] worked really hard now he must get the
[1:19:38] same reward that John got because
[1:19:40] history said John died in a hundred ad
[1:19:43] at 94 years old yet they're both born
[1:19:49] again on the day of Pentecost they both
[1:19:51] received the same Holy Ghost but one man
[1:19:54] worked one year another one worked 66
[1:19:58] years
[1:20:01] they both endured the heat of
[1:20:03] persecution right
[1:20:06] while laboring for the householder but
[1:20:08] they'll both receive eternal life
[1:20:10] because God is just and the payment is
[1:20:13] good because the good one promised them
[1:20:16] the same payment amen
[1:20:18] Laurie John labored sixty-five years
[1:20:21] longer than Stephen but the Bible said
[1:20:24] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:20:27] the Lord and he delights in his way amen
[1:20:31] God delighted in Stephens life I know it
[1:20:34] sounds hard for us to understand that
[1:20:35] but he delighted in Stephens life and we
[1:20:38] know that brother man said Jesus stood
[1:20:40] up from the throne and gave us standing
[1:20:42] salute when Stephen entered into that
[1:20:44] glorious place hey man
[1:20:46] because the Bible said he seated on the
[1:20:48] right hand but when Stephen came to
[1:20:50] heaven Jesus stood up and gave a salute
[1:20:52] amen in the presence of a faithful
[1:20:55] martyr a great reward that he had he
[1:20:58] received but Jesus ordered Stephen steps
[1:21:01] tonight 29 don't you know God ordered
[1:21:04] brother Branham to die at 56 years old
[1:21:07] don't you know he ordered him to die in
[1:21:09] a car accident that God wasn't surprised
[1:21:12] by that and although people make fun of
[1:21:14] it let him make fun of it because it's
[1:21:16] not us who chooses the way we go it's
[1:21:18] God who chooses the way we go it's God
[1:21:23] and see the reality of it us no matter
[1:21:25] how brother man died people stumble out
[1:21:27] that my mum friends someone like that he
[1:21:29] kind of laughed and made fun of it may
[1:21:30] God have mercy on that man but the
[1:21:33] reality of it is he died as a Christian
[1:21:35] and he died without any shame or sin on
[1:21:39] his life no matter how he died he died
[1:21:41] right in great standing before the Son
[1:21:44] of God amen
[1:21:46] he died driving back to preach some
[1:21:48] meetings amen
[1:21:50] he didn't die just barely save like a
[1:21:52] thief on the cross although thank God he
[1:21:54] was saved we appreciate this salvation
[1:21:56] but but he died with the reward amen he
[1:22:00] died with the legacy of Eliezer going to
[1:22:03] go preach to Rebekah praise God amen
[1:22:06] he died he said I want to close the
[1:22:09] bride in the righteousness of Christ
[1:22:11] were a men he died by giving the bra
[1:22:14] the clothes that she had to put on for
[1:22:16] the rapture amen faithful witness amen
[1:22:20] no matter how he passed this dimension
[1:22:23] we don't we look at that we look at the
[1:22:25] fruits of their lives and did they labor
[1:22:27] faithfully for the kingdom of God I say
[1:22:29] he did amen hallelujah people can
[1:22:34] criticize whatever they want but the
[1:22:36] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[1:22:38] Lord see the householder plainly states
[1:22:42] he said I can do my own will with my own
[1:22:46] workers because I'm good he's gonna
[1:22:50] treat you good huh as God treated you
[1:22:51] good Church hallelujah has the
[1:22:55] assignment God given you is it too hard
[1:22:58] for you or can you deal with it I can
[1:23:01] deal with it Bray's God it's not too hot
[1:23:03] it's not too long it's not too hard amen
[1:23:08] we just got one hour to labor for Christ
[1:23:12] and it's not even the hottest time it's
[1:23:15] not even the the biggest time of
[1:23:16] persecution that was in the beginning
[1:23:18] right that's why they'd have that line
[1:23:19] anointing to battle and with boldness
[1:23:22] against the heat of persecution right
[1:23:26] and then of course we know the Ox age
[1:23:27] where they died they freely gave their
[1:23:30] lives away right see he says I'm good
[1:23:35] God is fair he's a Heavenly Father's
[1:23:38] Fair with a plan for every life God has
[1:23:41] different assignments for believers and
[1:23:45] today the spiritual conditions around
[1:23:47] the world
[1:23:48] are they date they're different all
[1:23:50] around the world did you know there's an
[1:23:54] article from Newsweek a few years ago
[1:23:58] that said Christianity is our quota it
[1:24:01] says is facing genocide in the Middle
[1:24:04] East we got it easy over here we're at
[1:24:08] the it feels like it's the end of the
[1:24:09] day but there's Christians that feel
[1:24:12] like they're in the heat of the day
[1:24:14] right now especially in the Middle East
[1:24:17] it's that many Christians in the Middle
[1:24:19] Eastern are facing genocide
[1:24:21] anti-christian persecution is increasing
[1:24:24] and it's severity is intensifying making
[1:24:27] Christians the most
[1:24:28] persecuted a religious group in the
[1:24:30] world amen my army so it's it's even
[1:24:40] though it seems like it's not so hot
[1:24:42] here it's not but it is hot in other
[1:24:45] places around in the world and we got to
[1:24:47] remember to pray for those Saints no
[1:24:52] matter the circumstances God desires
[1:24:54] faithful service in the hour in which
[1:24:56] we're working and listen Church you know
[1:24:59] and I know it the conditions are not
[1:25:01] going to get better they're going to get
[1:25:03] worse the Bible says the love will
[1:25:08] decrease and the converts will decrease
[1:25:12] Matthew 24:12 because iniquity shall
[1:25:15] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:25:17] sin destroys love and sin is only going
[1:25:21] to increase so love is gonna get smaller
[1:25:24] and smaller smaller if anybody ever sees
[1:25:26] love in this world it ought to be in you
[1:25:28] and I I had a guy tell me on on Tuesday
[1:25:33] said I felt the love of God in your life
[1:25:35] he said the room felt were filled with
[1:25:37] filled love because of what you did
[1:25:39] that's what he told me and I'm not
[1:25:41] bragging I'm just saying we got it we
[1:25:43] ought to be living epistles amen people
[1:25:46] should feel the love of God in our lives
[1:25:50] sin destroys love but Jesus had got us a
[1:25:53] short in the days so that some people
[1:25:55] are saved in Matthew 24:22 and except
[1:25:58] those days should be shortened there
[1:26:00] should be no flesh say for but for the
[1:26:02] elects sake those days are shortened so
[1:26:06] there's going to be less love there's
[1:26:08] mean less converts but we've still got
[1:26:10] to work and labor no matter the
[1:26:12] conditions of the day we got to be
[1:26:14] faithful and we got to work until we
[1:26:16] hear the bell to go home amen
[1:26:19] hallelujah praise God amen
[1:26:23] despite what you know Pentecostals say
[1:26:26] they're saying this worldwide revival
[1:26:28] and a great harvest of souls scripture
[1:26:30] says the opposite they and I saw that
[1:26:35] prophesy again that last year that woman
[1:26:36] made a prophecy and said there's gonna
[1:26:38] be billions and billions of souls save
[1:26:40] with the anointing of what
[1:26:42] Radames ministry I don't see how that's
[1:26:43] scriptural because Jesus has to shorten
[1:26:47] the days that some might be saved they
[1:26:51] can say what they want but scripture
[1:26:52] says when sin abounds love is destroyed
[1:26:55] love gets worse there's less love and
[1:27:00] John says all nations will be deceived
[1:27:04] and will cooperate with the false church
[1:27:07] the mother harlot who we learned about
[1:27:10] recently when we preached on revelation
[1:27:12] 17 and 18 right the Roman Catholic
[1:27:14] Church all nations are gonna be deceived
[1:27:17] not some all nations and the final
[1:27:22] scripture that he says Matthew 20 verse
[1:27:24] 16 so shall the last be first and the
[1:27:27] first last for many will be called but
[1:27:30] few chosen other scripture has always
[1:27:32] puzzled me because of this in the
[1:27:35] rapture the first ones that died are the
[1:27:39] first ones that are raised in the
[1:27:41] rapture right because the dead in Christ
[1:27:44] rise first right so this must be
[1:27:50] speaking of something else
[1:27:51] this must be speaking of the awards the
[1:27:54] rewards at the at the throne of Christ
[1:27:57] which we see in 1st Corinthians 3 the
[1:28:01] Bible said every man must stand before
[1:28:02] the judgment seat of Christ not the
[1:28:04] white throne judgment but the judgment
[1:28:06] where rewards are given out to the bride
[1:28:10] so it has to be that because the rapture
[1:28:12] is the first ones that die are the first
[1:28:14] ones resurrected and bromances more
[1:28:17] blessed to be in that group he says I
[1:28:18] think he says that to encourage the
[1:28:20] Saints that have died you know the ones
[1:28:21] that have had loved ones that died he
[1:28:23] encourages them he said it's more
[1:28:24] blessed to be in that group he says I
[1:28:26] just heard it this week so this this the
[1:28:31] last shall be first the first last it
[1:28:32] must be Christ assurance that God will
[1:28:37] determine the order of rewards not us so
[1:28:43] God is going to honor the last first and
[1:28:46] the first last he calls many to service
[1:28:50] but he's chosen a select few to a higher
[1:28:53] more honorable works based upon his
[1:28:55] foreknowledge
[1:28:56] God's choosing is always right so I
[1:28:59] imagine that I don't know if this is
[1:29:01] right but it just what it seems like if
[1:29:02] this parable is right it would seem like
[1:29:04] the Laodicean bride will come up for
[1:29:06] rewards first although she only worked
[1:29:09] one hour because the last shall be first
[1:29:13] and the first shall be last now I can't
[1:29:16] say that for sure but that's what it
[1:29:17] looks like by the scripture because the
[1:29:19] rapture doesn't look like that
[1:29:21] the first that died our resurrected
[1:29:23] first so it must be something that God
[1:29:26] wants us to show God wants us God wants
[1:29:30] to show us that no matter how long your
[1:29:33] assignment was God is going to reward
[1:29:35] you if you're faithful to your service
[1:29:37] amen
[1:29:37] no matter how long how hard it was God
[1:29:41] rewards faithful servants amen and we
[1:29:44] cannot exalt others above of other ones
[1:29:47] because we're all in this by the grace
[1:29:49] of God and many of us don't choose right
[1:29:53] we don't choose our path God has chosen
[1:29:55] our past God has given us a calling if
[1:29:57] we had our choice we'd all be prophets
[1:29:59] won't we brother brother brother glad
[1:30:00] won't we because we'd all want to
[1:30:01] foretell the future we'd all want to
[1:30:03] know what's gonna happen if we aren't
[1:30:05] but see God we didn't got it let us
[1:30:07] choose our gifts God chose our gifts and
[1:30:11] also you gotta do is be faithful with
[1:30:13] the assignment God gave us and thank God
[1:30:15] for it now in closing I want to say this
[1:30:18] let me read a few quotes I'm preaching
[1:30:22] 50 minutes I'm trying to be less than an
[1:30:24] hour so maybe I'll finish fast now he
[1:30:26] says brother I heard it earlier this
[1:30:27] week I was listening how can I overcome
[1:30:28] 63 beautiful message beautiful miss they
[1:30:31] asked my brother ham well what church do
[1:30:33] you belong to
[1:30:34] I don't belong what denomination you
[1:30:35] belong to I said none I said well what
[1:30:38] do you belong to I said a kingdom a
[1:30:42] kingdom
[1:30:44] what do you belong to well Bride of
[1:30:45] Christ fellowship what denomination the
[1:30:47] kingdom of God but it's not a
[1:30:50] denomination a kingdom by one spirit
[1:30:54] we're all baptized into that kingdom
[1:30:56] because jesus said the kingdom of God is
[1:30:58] within you
[1:30:58] by one spirit all in this kingdom jesus
[1:31:01] said pray my kingdom come thy will be
[1:31:04] done on earth as in heaven now
[1:31:06] he stood one day before mount
[1:31:08] transfiguration said bear
[1:31:09] to you that some shall stand here and
[1:31:11] not taste death till that they see the
[1:31:13] kingdom come in power it was for shadows
[1:31:15] we've been taught the Mount of
[1:31:16] Transfiguration he's talking about the
[1:31:17] rapture that's what they saw him out
[1:31:19] Transfiguration they saw a foreshadowing
[1:31:20] of the rapture and 144,000 now a new
[1:31:23] quote no I'm sorry the Bible said the
[1:31:26] kingdom of God is within you
[1:31:27] so this in this kingdom people that
[1:31:30] professes that this is not their home
[1:31:32] this is not our home we're looking for
[1:31:35] the coming of the king set up the
[1:31:37] kingdom amen praise God thank you lord
[1:31:42] now here's another quote look on
[1:31:44] Hollywood look at these little girls lay
[1:31:45] now here in the parks and the boys
[1:31:47] wallowing around over these things and
[1:31:49] things like that even seen in choirs and
[1:31:51] the Elvis Presley's and so forth that we
[1:31:53] have today it's a disgrace to the name
[1:31:55] of America to what our forefathers
[1:31:57] fought and bled and died for but the
[1:32:01] hours come that every Kingdom has to
[1:32:03] give away because there's a kingdom of
[1:32:05] God that's established in the human
[1:32:07] heart by the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:09] and the presence of Jesus Christ and
[1:32:11] Christ will come to his bride and set up
[1:32:14] a kingdom here on earth that will never
[1:32:16] be diminished how do you get in this
[1:32:18] kingdom you're born into it how do you
[1:32:21] know it
[1:32:21] you just keep how would you belong in
[1:32:23] the kingdom and disagree with the king
[1:32:25] amen how do you know you're born again
[1:32:27] you believe and live every word of the
[1:32:30] kingdom praise God that's the evidence
[1:32:33] of the Holy Ghost someone who keeps all
[1:32:35] the Word of God see he says it here how
[1:32:39] would you belong in a kingdom and
[1:32:41] disagree with the king see and the king
[1:32:45] is the word a king is the word amen you
[1:32:50] can't disagree with the word and be a
[1:32:52] part of this kingdom in the beginning
[1:32:55] was the word towards with God the Word
[1:32:56] was God the Word was made flesh and
[1:32:58] dwelt among us the same yesterday today
[1:32:59] and forever now a new quote now the
[1:33:03] Queen of England might ask you a favor
[1:33:05] she might take something from you she
[1:33:07] you know so so much the president he
[1:33:09] might ask you two things that you didn't
[1:33:10] want to do he might ask you for
[1:33:11] treasures you didn't want to give up
[1:33:13] which would mean nothing just to him but
[1:33:15] Jesus is bringing something to you when
[1:33:18] he knocks he's bringing a pardon
[1:33:21] forgiveness hey
[1:33:23] don't turn it down for as it was tried
[1:33:27] in the courts here so will it be in the
[1:33:29] kingdom of heaven so just as courts are
[1:33:31] done in on earth so other courts in
[1:33:33] heaven be if he knocked and brought the
[1:33:36] pardon and you turn it down and die in
[1:33:38] your sins you'll perish though you had
[1:33:40] the honor of sitting in a meeting like
[1:33:42] this though you had the honor of
[1:33:43] attending the revival or your church how
[1:33:46] many leave it's the honor to come to
[1:33:47] church that's what he said right there
[1:33:50] it's an honor to come to a meeting or
[1:33:53] come to notice not just any church but
[1:33:56] your church see everybody needs a your
[1:34:00] church and heard a pastor your pastor
[1:34:07] preach a gospel message and the church
[1:34:09] said see everybody needs their own home
[1:34:13] church and their own pastor and that was
[1:34:16] what I didn't get to sister Naomi and
[1:34:18] Beatrice on one Sunday one of the winds
[1:34:21] that blow through our church is that
[1:34:22] somehow they have that people have some
[1:34:24] revelation where you don't need a home
[1:34:26] church anymore because we're all one big
[1:34:29] church now it's a shame they didn't let
[1:34:32] brother branham know that right they
[1:34:35] should have let brother Brad know that
[1:34:36] because well Ram the whole time says you
[1:34:38] need your church and your pastor he
[1:34:42] didn't say I'm your pastor he never said
[1:34:44] I'll always be your pastor in fact
[1:34:45] brother Brad said there come a time when
[1:34:47] I won't be your pastor anymore see and
[1:34:53] you had the audience that yes I was
[1:34:54] there maybe it was hard to tell when all
[1:34:56] you could say I heard the singing I
[1:34:58] enjoyed it I heard the testimonies it
[1:34:59] was real but you turned down God's
[1:35:01] forgiveness see we got that we got to be
[1:35:03] forgiving we got to accept the blood of
[1:35:04] Jesus Christ now let's say into our feet
[1:35:07] here let me read these because I just
[1:35:10] want to close with that thought it's
[1:35:11] kind of a thought I just didn't get to
[1:35:12] on Sunday like I said the winds blowing
[1:35:16] through this church and amongst some of
[1:35:18] the brothers that oh you don't need to
[1:35:20] have a pastor you don't need a home
[1:35:21] church that's a bunch of that's a bunch
[1:35:23] of lies you got to have it it's
[1:35:26] scriptural remember the by
[1:35:31] I don't have time for all the scriptures
[1:35:32] but Jesus looked at the multitudes and
[1:35:33] the Bible said he had compassion because
[1:35:35] they had no Shepherds so he said pray
[1:35:38] pray that I'll send four Shepherds out
[1:35:40] there Jesus gets sad when people don't
[1:35:43] have a home church because they just
[1:35:45] wander around like a like a sheep run
[1:35:47] around there and the devil's like a wolf
[1:35:48] gonna eat him up right and when you ever
[1:35:53] see a sheep wander from one flock to the
[1:35:55] other doesn't happen very much does it
[1:35:59] see and the Bible said ordain elders in
[1:36:04] every city so in the Bible days every
[1:36:06] city had a church and a pastor and then
[1:36:10] Timothy gives the requirements in 1st
[1:36:13] Timothy 3 I'm sorry Paul gives it to
[1:36:15] Timothy elders got to be the husband of
[1:36:17] one wife or they got to rule their house
[1:36:18] well and they got to preach the word
[1:36:20] they got to be hospitable they can't be
[1:36:22] partakers of wine right all the
[1:36:24] qualifications God said a man that's
[1:36:27] gonna rule the house of God he's got to
[1:36:29] rule his house the right way first and
[1:36:33] remember we read it on Sunday the Bible
[1:36:35] said some of you say I'm a palm apostle
[1:36:38] I'm sorry I'm Apollo's but Paul said God
[1:36:40] has given a preacher to every man so God
[1:36:43] has given a pastor to every man or woman
[1:36:45] if they'll just look for it
[1:36:48] praise God the Bible said every man it's
[1:36:50] given to every man before I read this
[1:36:58] Hebrews 13:7 these are some of my
[1:37:01] faithful scriptures I go to if people
[1:37:03] try to say oh you know have to have a
[1:37:05] home church well look what the Bible
[1:37:06] says and now we know that well also we
[1:37:09] know Ephesians 4 about pastors they have
[1:37:12] a port enroll Hebrews 13:7 remember them
[1:37:22] which have the rule over you see who has
[1:37:25] spoken unto you the Word of God whose
[1:37:27] faith follow considering that and to
[1:37:30] their conversation Jesus Christ the same
[1:37:33] yesterday today and forever
[1:37:35] so God puts men as examples not lords
[1:37:39] but as examples over the flock and
[1:37:43] Bible said obey them when they preach
[1:37:45] God's Word
[1:37:46] right the trouble is they a lot of
[1:37:50] people a lot of pastors give a commands
[1:37:52] but they're not in the word that's the
[1:37:53] trouble now go down to verse 17 obey
[1:37:57] them that have the rule over you and
[1:37:59] submit yourselves for they watch for
[1:38:01] your souls as they that must give
[1:38:04] account see the preachers have to give
[1:38:08] account of the people that they may do
[1:38:13] it with joy and not with grief for that
[1:38:16] is unprofitable for you so I'd like I
[1:38:19] told you before I got to give an account
[1:38:21] of this church and the souls that came
[1:38:22] to my church I will give an account for
[1:38:25] that and I want to do it with joy I want
[1:38:27] to do it with happiness I don't want to
[1:38:30] do with grief the Bible says I don't
[1:38:32] wanna be sad when Jesus asked me well
[1:38:33] how did this family do her how did this
[1:38:35] individual do I don't want to be grief
[1:38:36] and sad I want to be joyful and say they
[1:38:39] believed your word Lord they live by
[1:38:41] they fed on every word of God that was
[1:38:43] preached amen look what says after the
[1:38:47] seals I mind you and now tomorrow Sunday
[1:38:50] and there will be Sunday school the
[1:38:52] churches the reason we have our service
[1:38:53] afternoon on Sunday is so we won't
[1:38:55] interrupt any service at all brother Ram
[1:38:57] never interrupted the local home church
[1:38:59] services he always had his services
[1:39:02] between the morning and evening so he
[1:39:04] wouldn't interrupt the local pastors
[1:39:05] that's how much a prophet respected the
[1:39:08] pastor's we don't see that today with a
[1:39:11] lot of people they want to take all the
[1:39:14] people from the pastor's we believe
[1:39:17] every Christian ought to have a home
[1:39:20] church that they go to every Christian
[1:39:23] ought to meet somewhere with believers
[1:39:24] and wherever you meet that's the church
[1:39:27] the brother man believed in staying home
[1:39:29] no he said he said don't stay at home in
[1:39:31] the Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:39:32] praise God
[1:39:34] now there are situations where like we
[1:39:36] talked about in Sunday you could if
[1:39:38] there's no good churches around you and
[1:39:39] they're all in the sin you might stay
[1:39:40] home and livestream right you might say
[1:39:43] home a new tape services we said that if
[1:39:45] there's not a real if there's a church
[1:39:48] that's full of demons you don't want to
[1:39:50] go to that church now look what you said
[1:39:54] if I lived here I would belong to one of
[1:39:57] these churches here
[1:39:59] well yeah people are saying today oh you
[1:40:02] don't need a home church we're all just
[1:40:04] a part of the same church well we are
[1:40:06] one sense by the blood but not by the
[1:40:08] flesh by the flesh we all need a home
[1:40:12] Church I belong to one of these churches
[1:40:15] here not all of them see that's what
[1:40:17] they're trying to say today to our
[1:40:19] sisters are our faithful home church
[1:40:21] people here they're trying to say we're
[1:40:22] all in the same church no we're not by
[1:40:25] the blood we are but not by the flesh
[1:40:28] these pastors here that's cooperate and
[1:40:31] represents why I they're here sitting up
[1:40:33] on the platform to be seen of all the
[1:40:35] people that they endorsed what's going
[1:40:37] on they believe in this type of ministry
[1:40:39] divine healing the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:40:40] and so forth they are here giving
[1:40:42] witness to it they was the one who
[1:40:44] invited me to come here that may be the
[1:40:45] ministry Lord has given me might help
[1:40:47] their congregation now that's a real
[1:40:48] pastor that's looking out for all the
[1:40:50] spiritual benefits that he can of
[1:40:51] everything God is doing that he's trying
[1:40:54] his best to help the church to move on
[1:40:56] for God I certainly take off my hat and
[1:40:58] admiration for a pastor like that and
[1:41:00] these men had to do that under difficult
[1:41:02] to see the heat of the day right the
[1:41:04] heat of the day laborers in the vineyard
[1:41:06] it's difficult form you can leave that
[1:41:08] to be true they had to do it under
[1:41:10] difficult I certainly am grateful for
[1:41:12] such great men of God who's willing to
[1:41:14] take their place and their post of duty
[1:41:15] upon their convictions and God ever
[1:41:18] blessed them he says I'm sure they'll do
[1:41:23] you good the pastor's if you're
[1:41:24] estranged here find out where these
[1:41:26] brothers have their churches where

[1:41:44] and there remain faithful how long to
[1:41:48] the posted it until death shall set them
[1:41:51] free from this earthly course the
[1:41:54] brother bramble even staying at home or
[1:41:56] not having a home church no he didn't
[1:41:57] but then believed in having a home
[1:42:00] church until death sets you free amen
[1:42:04] but like these and and I'm not saying

[1:42:21] right thing they're doing the right
[1:42:21] thing I'm talking about spirits that

[1:42:25] say you don't need a home Church you
[1:42:26] don't need a pastor you do need one you
[1:42:30] got to have one that's what the program
[1:42:31] taught and he never changed it praise
[1:42:33] God and even if people try to change the
[1:42:36] day just say you're wrong I disagree and
[1:42:38] do it with love all right Malachi come
[1:42:42] on up here by God's grace there I had
[1:42:44] four more quotes let me just put this
[1:42:45] one up well mother bear said I have to
[1:42:49] answer for the church he says he said
[1:42:51] you have to answer for a church you have
[1:42:54] to answer for your family maybe just for
[1:42:55] yourself see I've got to answer I've got
[1:42:58] to give an account did I preach the word
[1:43:00] first if I did thank God for that
[1:43:02] and then the second thing did you
[1:43:04] receive the word
[1:43:05] I got a preach it you got to receive I
[1:43:08] got a live it - I got a live it before I
[1:43:11] preached it actually cuz I'm a hypocrite
[1:43:13] if I'm preaching to them I'm not living
[1:43:15] it praise God right but these are just
[1:43:20] the quotes I've been sharing with some
[1:43:22] of the saints but man said any man
[1:43:23] that's more the Spirit of God loves to
[1:43:25] go to church better than he loves to eat
[1:43:27] his meat but man said if you love God
[1:43:30] you'd be at church aha he said the
[1:43:35] Spirit of God will run you straight to
[1:43:36] the church every time the door opens for
[1:43:38] fellowship it'll run you to church every
[1:43:41] time the doors open he said don't stay
[1:43:43] home if God's in your heart you can't
[1:43:44] hardly wait for the doors to open out
[1:43:46] yonder to get in there to fellowship
[1:43:48] with your brothers if you don't it's
[1:43:50] time you got to praying amen
