[34:30] let's kind of recap a little bit you
[34:32] know we've done 31 sermons now 32
[34:36] uh with the remaining chapters are going
[34:38] to look like this you know we're in
[34:40] chapter 18 and 19
[34:42] where
[34:44] the tribes begin receiving their
[34:46] promised lot some 300 to 400 years
[34:50] after they were prophesied of by both
[34:53] their father
[34:55] and then
[34:57] not long before that then was moses that
[34:59] prophesied of him as well
[35:04] as we are looking at 18 at the end of
[35:06] chapter 18 benjamin receives his lot
[35:08] we'll actually look at benjamin here
[35:10] tonight lord willing
[35:12] chapter 19 uh the lots are given to the
[35:14] remaining six tribes
[35:17] and then josh was given a gift of
[35:18] inheritance we kind of looked at that
[35:20] additionally
[35:22] as we looked at joshua's tribe judah
[35:24] and how he was given a special portion
[35:26] in judah
[35:28] because of his faithful service to the
[35:29] lord
[35:31] in the remaining chapters there's only
[35:33] five chapters chapters left rather after
[35:36] this
[35:36] uh chapter 20 is on the cities of refuge
[35:39] chapter 21 is the cities of the levites
[35:41] among their tribes
[35:43] god's faithfulness to israel and keeping
[35:45] all of his promises
[35:47] chapter 22 is about joshua's words to
[35:49] the two and a half tribes on the east of
[35:51] jordan
[35:55] and then there's a little bit of
[35:56] confusion followed by peace regarding an
[35:58] altar set up by that by these two and a
[36:00] half tribes
[36:02] and then chapter 23 a summons by josh
[36:04] reminding of blessings or cursings in
[36:07] the land then the book ends in chapter
[36:09] 24 with another summons by joshua urging
[36:12] israel to make their choice
[36:14] and then we are told about joshua's
[36:16] death so that's the conclusion to the
[36:18] book of joshua
[36:20] and lord willing we're going to try to
[36:21] preach through all that lord willing if
[36:23] god would help us it's been just a
[36:25] tremendous
[36:27] series here
[36:28] i've learned so much i've grown so much
[36:30] as a christian and hopefully we feel
[36:32] stronger now that we've been preaching
[36:34] this
[36:36] series this year because we see
[36:37] ourselves as uh spiritual israel right
[36:41] possessing our promised land in the
[36:44] baptism of the holy ghost the third work
[36:46] of grace
[36:47] and in other words beginning this
[36:48] adoption process we know it's not
[36:50] finished until we get a new body
[36:52] according to book of romans
[36:54] uh to it the redemption of our body
[36:56] that's to it is that is the redemption
[36:59] of our body that's the the fullness or
[37:00] completion of adoption
[37:02] but as we are living in this world we
[37:04] should possess many promises of god all
[37:07] the promises of god are yea and amen
[37:10] and we do that by the grace of god and
[37:12] also yielding our
[37:15] human will to the will of god
[37:18] and we know it's uh it's the love of god
[37:21] working in us because
[37:22] paul says
[37:24] faith with which works love i believe in
[37:27] galatians five verse six so each day
[37:29] we've got to humble ourselves
[37:31] uh die to ourselves
[37:33] and live from the love of god in our
[37:35] soul
[37:36] and that love will inspire our faith and
[37:40] that faith will work for the kingdom of
[37:42] jesus christ
[37:43] each and every day not just sunday like
[37:45] a lot of churches not just wednesday
[37:49] but each and every day as we seek first
[37:50] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[37:54] then everything else will be added unto
[37:55] us how many want to be righteous praise
[37:56] god you want christ's own righteousness
[38:00] that only comes through obeying the holy
[38:02] spirit praise god
[38:03] and living a life pleasing unto the lord
[38:05] we know it's possible and so we thank
[38:07] the lord for that
[38:09] so
[38:11] i just want to also briefly review
[38:14] again this quote from as i was with
[38:16] moses 1960
[38:19] brother branham said
[38:20] a very beautiful type of what we need a
[38:22] joshua for today
[38:24] the trouble today when we're coming to
[38:26] our promised land god wants to raise
[38:28] sheep like ephraim and one wants to
[38:30] raise something like the other every man
[38:32] wants to be the same
[38:33] let god give one man a gift to healing
[38:35] every man wants to get to healing
[38:37] ephraim and god and all of them wants to
[38:38] mix all them
[38:40] come with one but we are divided in our
[38:43] position
[38:44] all don't have the gift of wisdom
[38:47] all don't prophesy
[38:49] all don't speak with tongues all are not
[38:51] prophets but god has sent the church
[38:53] some that prophesy
[38:55] some that speak it with tongues
[38:57] we want to make them all speaking in
[38:59] tongues of course that's pentecostal but
[39:01] see how the confusion is then you can't
[39:04] get nowhere
[39:06] he said god give us a joshua
[39:08] god give us a joshua that will hold the
[39:10] commission with the word
[39:12] so one major emphasis of this series is
[39:15] for us to be baptized with the holy
[39:17] ghost find our position
[39:19] and be who god made us to be as brother
[39:22] adam said we can't be something that
[39:23] we're not or ain't
[39:25] or hate whatever he said it
[39:27] uh
[39:28] we want to be what god made us to be now
[39:30] of course church you know at some point
[39:32] we'll find somebody else with our same
[39:34] gifting right so and we can actually
[39:36] learn from them you know we can learn
[39:38] from them especially if they're an older
[39:39] christian the lord we can if our gift is
[39:41] wisdom or our gift is tongues or
[39:44] or miracles whatever it is we can learn
[39:46] from that individual
[39:47] um but of course we wouldn't copy
[39:50] uh that person in every little aspect
[39:52] you know god may have
[39:54] uh you know maybe a larger
[39:56] uh portion of the gift for that
[39:58] individual
[39:59] uh
[40:00] maybe it's larger in our life you know
[40:02] so we've just got to be aware of that
[40:05] my question is i'm sorry my connection's
[40:07] unstable so let me see if i can
[40:17] friends i may slide the camera back a
[40:19] little bit it's kind of unstable
[40:22] maybe towards our router so just bear
[40:23] with me here
[40:34] so hopefully that will
[40:35] get a little bit better we'll see how
[40:37] this kind of pans out
[40:45] the screen says it's uh please wait
[40:46] while we we try reconnecting so
[40:49] what's that just go okay so my children
[40:52] think i should just go so i'll just go
[40:54] all right you think it'll record
[40:56] okay
[40:57] well praise the lord hopefully it'll
[40:58] record by god's grace
[41:01] so um again we see that god sets us in
[41:04] our land and we want to be content with
[41:06] our land
[41:09] and the way to find that is seek the
[41:11] lord the bible says seek the lord while
[41:13] he may be found
[41:15] and of course that means before
[41:17] the lord would come but also before a
[41:19] person may turn and take a reprobate
[41:22] heart
[41:23] which would be the worst kind of heart
[41:24] someone could have a reprobate mind
[41:26] rather
[41:27] where god gives them over to believe a
[41:29] lie be damned by it
[41:31] in other words while we have this window
[41:33] of a long in our hearts a window
[41:36] that we want to seek the lord
[41:38] oh with all of our hearts we should seek
[41:40] that and then always continue i'm
[41:41] talking about generally to all people
[41:44] everybody has this window where they
[41:45] have to choose to seek the lord or deny
[41:48] the lord i actually read about romans 1
[41:50] this morning that was my chapter
[41:53] about how they did not like to retain
[41:54] god in their knowledge so god give them
[41:56] over the strong deluge and reprobate
[41:58] mind to do the things that are not
[42:02] and so the wrath of god rests upon those
[42:03] people but thank god that you and i have
[42:06] uh accepted the lord's invitation thank
[42:09] god we've heard the knock praise god uh
[42:11] from the laodicean church age he stands
[42:13] the door knocks and thank god we're
[42:15] supposing with him tonight praise god
[42:17] we're out here just you're not watching
[42:18] just to be a religious act but we want
[42:20] to sup with the lord we want to feast
[42:22] with the lord we want to know his will
[42:23] and we want to grow by his food and his
[42:26] power
[42:27] and his
[42:28] his word in our lives praise god
[42:31] and as again as 15 years of pastor god
[42:34] found that i need every sermon i need
[42:36] every service i need every worship
[42:37] service
[42:39] i can't skip any of them my spirit needs
[42:40] that my soul needs the word of god and i
[42:44] can't remember
[42:46] of course every single service over 15
[42:48] years and now uh
[42:50] 21 years as being a christian
[42:52] but i know each and every one was
[42:54] especially important especially needful
[42:56] it's helped me to get to where i am
[42:58] today thank god and that's true for each
[43:00] one of us as we're on our journey uh
[43:02] serving the lord jesus christ we need
[43:04] each and every sermon each and every
[43:06] song service we need to meditate upon
[43:09] the lord uh just be fully devoted to the
[43:12] lord and love with him
[43:14] and let him be our portion let him be
[43:16] our satisfying portion how many would be
[43:18] satisfied with jesus amen
[43:20] that's that's really what it comes down
[43:21] to for the bible says if the love of the
[43:23] world's in you then the and the love of
[43:25] the father's not in you
[43:27] all right we must overcome the lust of
[43:29] the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride
[43:32] of life
[43:34] and
[43:35] by doing that we'll have we'll have
[43:37] christ be our satisfying portion in
[43:40] other words we'll be satisfied
[43:41] uh with every surface we'll be satisfied
[43:43] with worshiping and loving the lord that
[43:45] will be the highlight to our day
[43:47] highlight to our week it's just loving
[43:49] and serving god looking to the sky to
[43:51] see as jesus coming today praise god
[43:53] just having that type of expectation for
[43:56] the lord jesus christ
[43:59] so let's review you know we've gone now
[44:01] through 10 of the sons
[44:03] of israel
[44:05] and let's just briefly review them i'll
[44:08] try to be very brief
[44:10] so reuben was the eldest now of course
[44:12] he was disgraced demoted and replaced as
[44:16] we'll read a little bit
[44:17] of course he himself repented he had
[44:19] this awful sin simon preaching on this
[44:21] as i preached on it unstable as water
[44:24] sexual sin with his father's concubine
[44:26] there
[44:27] but we know later he was saved and he's
[44:30] given one of those
[44:32] 24
[44:33] seats around the throne of christ as one
[44:36] of the heads of the 12 tribes of israel
[44:40] simeon and levi kind of goes together
[44:42] second and third
[44:44] simeon was disgraced into insignificance
[44:47] while levi was redeemed and exalted to
[44:49] the priesthood remember we kind of had
[44:51] two sets of brothers there that kind of
[44:53] worked together a lot
[44:55] issachar and zebulun and then
[44:57] um
[45:00] and then uh simeon levi
[45:03] okay and uh
[45:04] so this is what we see there thank god
[45:06] for the levitical priesthood you know
[45:08] and so forth uh ministering uh before
[45:11] the throne of god
[45:12] uh the ark of god
[45:14] fourth was judah judah was exalted to
[45:17] the lead
[45:19] not the birthright which that was a it
[45:20] was quite a good thought there
[45:22] brought up by brother simon
[45:24] he's exalted to the lead of the tribes
[45:27] but not given the birthright
[45:30] and of course he was exalted the lead
[45:32] because he was given david and then
[45:34] eventually christ
[45:36] because we know david was a pre-figure
[45:38] of jesus christ and then solomon a
[45:40] pre-figure of the son of david in the
[45:42] millennium
[45:43] and of course then we know solomon
[45:45] started the seven old testament church
[45:47] ages you know that's a beautiful message
[45:49] we looked at that recently
[45:51] fifth was dan dan was honored in samson
[45:54] but then disgrace in idolatry
[45:57] just to kind of summarize his
[45:59] his tribe
[46:01] and also before i move on remember like
[46:03] all these tribes got back together
[46:04] during the time of dave remember to make
[46:06] david king
[46:08] benjamin didn't have as much during that
[46:10] time because they were still kind of
[46:11] hanging on to clinging to saul
[46:14] but they still had some
[46:16] uh and and they came all these tribes
[46:18] get great came to a great unity and a
[46:21] great uh
[46:22] political and
[46:25] military power during the time of david
[46:27] and they all made david king praise god
[46:30] so we see again the unity of the body of
[46:32] christ
[46:32] for the rapture we know that's coming
[46:34] brother branham said it's in the name of
[46:36] the lord
[46:38] all the denominational barrels will be
[46:40] broken down barriers rather and the
[46:42] bride of jesus christ will be united
[46:44] before the rapture so we're looking
[46:45] forward to that and we're doing our part
[46:47] to make that happen now because we're
[46:48] uniting we only unite around the truth
[46:50] praise god
[46:51] and the love of god produces truth and
[46:54] we want to have the right spirit and the
[46:55] right doctrine just like the apostle
[46:57] paul had praise god
[47:00] six we have naftali i hope i'm saying
[47:03] that right
[47:04] uh he helped barrick and deborah
[47:07] but then remain insignificant until
[47:10] messiah and the apostles and but then it
[47:12] was very significant
[47:14] because jesus
[47:15] uh
[47:17] uh
[47:18] is his jesus
[47:20] uh
[47:23] is his his hometown for him for the
[47:25] majority of his ministry was in that
[47:27] area along with some of those other
[47:29] tribes but naphtali became extremely
[47:32] significant during the time of christ
[47:35] seventh was gad
[47:37] gad had overcoming warriors in david's
[47:39] time
[47:40] and they even produced elijah as god's
[47:43] mouthpiece for justice which fulfilled
[47:45] one of those prophecies as we saw a
[47:47] couple months back
[47:49] eighth was asher and asher for a time
[47:53] he was blessed in every single area of
[47:55] his life he had these beautiful children
[47:57] lots of children
[47:58] he had the most dainty food the best
[48:00] food
[48:01] uh the work and he had amazing strength
[48:06] okay and then kind of goes into some
[48:08] insignificance after those days
[48:10] but he was a great example the tribe was
[48:12] a great example of for a time
[48:15] able to possess every blessing god gave
[48:17] to them
[48:20] ninth was issachar issachar had an
[48:23] agricultural inheritance to work in and
[48:25] rejoice in
[48:27] and they possessed the plane of jezreel
[48:29] a pleasant land
[48:31] they had the wisdom to call israel to
[48:34] make david king in first corinthian or
[48:36] first chronicles 12 verse 32 it was they
[48:39] were the ones that had
[48:40] uh the wisdom they had some warriors but
[48:42] a lot of their men
[48:44] were known for their wisdom and their
[48:46] course it would have been their
[48:47] revelation
[48:48] because they the bible said they knew
[48:50] what to do in those times and they knew
[48:52] to make
[48:53] david king and so
[48:55] many other tribes all the other tribes
[48:56] followed these men of issachar because
[48:59] of their wisdom that god had foretold
[49:02] they were blessed naturally in their
[49:04] trade alongside zebulun
[49:06] who was positioned by the sea
[49:10] and then 10th zebulun
[49:12] zebuin was blessed naturally in trade
[49:14] alongside is a car
[49:17] and i'm sorry here we see these two
[49:19] brothers in harmony sorry i said the
[49:20] wrong one earlier
[49:22] no i think i said right it's a car in
[49:23] zebulun yeah sorry isa car in zebulun
[49:27] uh kind of like the other two
[49:30] but uh
[49:31] these these two were in harmony which is
[49:33] the opposite right of simeon levi
[49:36] because they when they got together it
[49:38] was destruction and trouble
[49:40] but when these two got together zebulon
[49:42] and nissikar it was harmony and blessing
[49:45] amen
[49:46] that's what we want all of our children
[49:47] to be praise god we want them all to be
[49:49] in harmony and blessing and where can be
[49:52] more than two maybe can be eight right
[49:53] or maybe it can be four or five or
[49:55] whatever three four whatever the lord
[49:57] would have you know that everybody would
[49:58] be in one accord
[50:00] and everybody could
[50:02] exist
[50:03] in harmony fulfilling god's perfect will
[50:06] for their lives
[50:10] and of course we also saw in zebulun the
[50:12] spiritual mountain that moses spoke of
[50:15] which likely referred to christ and his
[50:17] disciples because remember the bible
[50:18] said in matthew that christ would be
[50:20] there in naphtali and zebulun so their
[50:22] lands are really close there
[50:25] to capernaum where jesus spent the
[50:26] majority of his ministry
[50:29] and what a blessing for those tribes to
[50:31] have the messiah
[50:32] minister so often in their lands no
[50:35] doubt that was prophetic
[50:37] and fulfilled through jesus christ our
[50:39] lord what is what a tribute to those
[50:41] tribes
[50:42] okay so let's look at
[50:44] the i'm sorry the tribe of joseph pardon
[50:46] me uh
[50:47] so let's go look at our bibles here we
[50:48] read the birth scriptures
[50:51] in genesis 30 why don't we get uh
[50:53] malachi want to get genesis 49 22
[50:57] okay should you want to get deuteronomy
[50:59] 33 13.
[51:03] joseph's name means he shall add
[51:08] i couldn't find brother random giving
[51:09] him a meaning of a name
[51:13] so i couldn't write anything there
[51:15] so let's uh let's let malachi read the
[51:17] prophecy of jacob
[51:19] about jacob's prophecy about his own son
[51:21] in genesis 49 verses 20 through
[51:24] 22-26 forgive me
[51:28] joseph is a fruitful bow even a fruitful
[51:31] bout by a well whose branch has run over
[51:33] the wall
[51:34] the archers have sorely grieved him and
[51:36] shot at him and hated him but his bow
[51:38] abide in strength and the arms of his
[51:40] hands were made drawn by the hands of
[51:42] the mighty god of jacob commences the
[51:44] shepherd the stone of israel
[51:46] even by the god of thy father who shall
[51:48] help thee and by the almighty who shall
[51:50] bless thee with the blessings of heaven
[51:52] above blessings from the deep that lie
[51:55] under blessings of the breasts and of
[51:57] the womb
[51:58] the blessings of thy father have
[52:00] prevailed above the blessings of my
[52:02] progenitors unto the utmost bound of the
[52:05] everlasting hills they shall be on the
[52:07] head of joseph and on the head of on the
[52:09] crown of the head of him that she was
[52:11] separate from his brother
[52:13] all right thank you
[52:15] now i looked at matthew henry what he
[52:17] said about this and obviously noted some
[52:19] very significant prophetic things
[52:23] joseph was going to be very large and
[52:25] full
[52:26] he was compared to a fruitful bow or a
[52:28] young tree
[52:30] and god had made him fruitful in the
[52:32] land of his affliction
[52:35] his two sons were as branches of a vine
[52:37] and other spreading plant running over
[52:39] the wall
[52:41] and we see how god makes those fruitful
[52:44] and great comforts to the themselves and
[52:46] others who've been looked
[52:48] upon as dry and withered
[52:50] and of course we saw that the beginning
[52:52] of the prophecy about how he'd be
[52:53] rejected of his brethren which we know
[52:55] he was and joseph was a almost a perfect
[52:57] type almost a perfect type of jesus
[53:00] christ right being spiritual having
[53:02] dreams being loved of the father
[53:04] rejected their brethren sown into a pit
[53:06] redeemed out of the pit
[53:09] and ultimately taken to be second in
[53:11] command right we know jesus on the right
[53:14] hand of the majesty on high there's many
[53:17] many beautiful types in the story of
[53:18] joseph but we see how it's prophetic
[53:21] foretold here by his father
[53:26] um
[53:27] we can see lots of results of course
[53:29] from this and i'm just kind of
[53:31] summarizing to make sure
[53:33] i can try to cover this kind of broadly
[53:35] here
[53:36] he received many blessings
[53:38] including a double portion
[53:41] and his two sons
[53:43] uh eat manas and even each became
[53:45] founder of a tribe of israel as well
[53:49] notice the best words went to joseph
[53:52] along with judah so just look at again
[53:54] look at judah and joseph
[53:56] and see how these men were so faithful
[53:59] that when god knows people are going to
[54:01] be faithful when god sees their heart
[54:03] they have served god with a perfect
[54:05] heart god is going to pour out his
[54:06] blessings on them
[54:08] okay now we know some of course will
[54:11] uh obey god but you know also go through
[54:13] great trials like stephen stone at such
[54:15] a young age what a what a wonderful
[54:17] servant of god obedient servant so we
[54:20] want to be careful when we talk about
[54:21] blessings you know because the blessing
[54:23] was for stephen to be a martyr
[54:25] and to have a martyr's crown and
[54:28] to see jesus
[54:29] you know uh after very short life
[54:32] have that time there in heaven
[54:34] so we gotta be careful we say the
[54:36] blessings but in this case you know
[54:38] these sons were given
[54:40] many natural blessings and of course
[54:41] spiritual blessings as well
[54:43] because their faithfulness
[54:45] joseph was faithful his entire life
[54:48] whereas we know judah grew into it he
[54:50] grew into this faithful walk
[54:53] so we see our case you know whether
[54:55] we
[54:56] if we look at our lives and we have
[54:58] failures we got to look past that and
[54:59] say god's given me a new day
[55:01] god's given me another chance he's a god
[55:03] of second chances third chances four's
[55:05] chances
[55:06] million chances
[55:08] and we've got to make the most of that
[55:10] and recognize that god sees our desire
[55:12] god will help us if we want to do right
[55:14] god will help us to do right and then we
[55:15] can expect the blessing of god to rest
[55:17] upon our lives
[55:21] we would just trust that our children
[55:22] born and raised in the message born and
[55:24] raised in a holy environment we just
[55:26] trust they'll be like joseph praise god
[55:29] that they'll have an experience with god
[55:30] at such a young age that the world will
[55:31] never be able to pull them away though
[55:33] satan will you know reach out and try to
[55:35] grab them each time they'll be able to
[55:37] pull back or maybe they can take the
[55:39] sword of the spirit you know and chop
[55:40] down the enemy
[55:42] by the grace of god that would be such a
[55:44] great testimony
[55:46] as
[55:47] we had a couple of preachers come in
[55:49] over the years and say that that jesus
[55:51] testimony was the greatest testimony
[55:53] that's true
[55:54] the greatest testimony is never forsaken
[55:56] the lord
[55:58] never leaving the church and going out
[55:59] and sewing wild notes like some people
[56:01] say in denomination you know
[56:02] uh or in the amish community or
[56:04] something like that
[56:05] the greatest testimonies being faithful
[56:07] overcoming satan and every one of his
[56:09] tricks
[56:10] and remaining faithful to the house lord
[56:12] so maybe we have some josephs and some
[56:14] josephines here
[56:15] spiritually speaking
[56:17] that each one will grow up and be such a
[56:19] testimony to jesus christ
[56:21] of the keeping power of the holy spirit
[56:23] praise god
[56:24] remember the bible said that remember
[56:26] the creator where in the days of your
[56:28] youth
[56:28] so only harder days are coming
[56:30] physically but also spiritually
[56:34] because we know the days get darker but
[56:36] of course the light of god in our lives
[56:38] shines brighter and brighter
[56:42] so those are great words to remember
[56:45] there
[56:46] um
[56:48] let's read that scripture i'm going to
[56:49] read that you stay there occasionally
[56:50] i'm going to read first chronicles 5.
[56:52] here's a just a
[56:53] beautiful thought
[56:55] this explains why joseph had so many
[56:58] promises malachi read malcolm i read all
[57:00] these promises all these natural
[57:01] blessings the hills the mountains and
[57:03] uh the womb you know he was gonna have
[57:05] so many blessings why
[57:08] because he was given the birthright
[57:11] because rue of what the evil sexual sin
[57:13] reuben committed so first chronicles 5 1
[57:16] now the sons of reuben the firstborn of
[57:18] israel for he was the firstborn but
[57:20] for as much as he defiled his father's
[57:22] bed
[57:23] his birthright was given unto the sons
[57:25] of joseph the son of israel
[57:28] and the genealogy is not reckoned
[57:31] after the birthright
[57:33] for judah prevailed above his brethren
[57:35] and of him came the chief ruler
[57:38] but the birthright was joseph's
[57:40] so it's interesting these two men you
[57:42] know judah and joseph their tribes and
[57:44] their lives were so spectacular or so
[57:47] humble maybe before god maybe that's a
[57:49] better word humble
[57:51] god gave one the rulership judah david
[57:54] and solomon and christ and god gave the
[57:56] other
[57:57] the birthright
[57:59] and that's what god would do god will
[58:00] honor those who honor him
[58:03] and so just a beautiful
[58:06] fulfillment of those prophecies how
[58:09] judah is given the scepter the rulership
[58:11] right but then joseph has these
[58:13] wonderful blessed wombs uh hills food
[58:16] all these wonderful things given the
[58:18] birthright
[58:19] so he took it from leah right take it
[58:21] from leah's firstborn and give it to
[58:23] rachel's firstborn the wife he loved the
[58:25] woman he loved
[58:27] okay
[58:29] so there's that's great scripture that's
[58:30] all new understanding for me i can see
[58:32] how that's uh important to know can be
[58:34] applied to our lives as we we uh
[58:37] constantly possess more of our spiritual
[58:40] land as well that god will bless us and
[58:42] help us and guide us and direct our
[58:44] entire lives whether it be like joseph
[58:46] he was faithful even in prison
[58:48] if we'd be imprisoned or
[58:51] you know for a long time god would honor
[58:54] the faithfulness and and god would see
[58:56] our desire to love him serve him and
[58:58] trust god would give us a restoration
[59:00] like he did for joseph
[59:02] by the grace of the lord
[59:05] i thought i would just stop here and i
[59:07] had this thought as i was studying that
[59:08] i would
[59:09] um
[59:10] maybe interject to hear why joseph of
[59:12] the old testament types jesus christ i
[59:16] already went through some examples but i
[59:17] just want to say again why he doesn't
[59:19] type
[59:20] brother branham's son joseph branham
[59:22] our precious brother in the lord who i
[59:24] respect and have emailed and been in
[59:26] contact with numerous times
[59:28] um
[59:30] but the air is that in uh his letter
[59:32] from 2001 here i stand
[59:35] um he typed himself
[59:38] as joseph of the old testament storing
[59:41] up the food but brother branham never
[59:43] used his type
[59:45] okay the type the wrong it's a wrong
[59:47] type because
[59:48] uh types the bride is either egypt
[59:52] right right
[59:54] or
[59:54] joseph's brothers
[59:56] rather than joseph's gentile wife as an
[59:59] f
[1:00:01] so the error here is from this letter
[1:00:03] here i stand was adding to the word or
[1:00:05] message
[1:00:06] of course the message only points to the
[1:00:08] word
[1:00:09] and misinterpreting the word
[1:00:13] so what is that 20 years ago now
[1:00:15] 20 years ago now we can all look and say
[1:00:16] okay this is still wrong and hopefully
[1:00:19] everyone's eyes are or more people's
[1:00:21] eyes are being open to this
[1:00:23] 20 years ago wow they misinterpreted the
[1:00:25] word look where they're at now
[1:00:27] at least 11 false doctrines
[1:00:29] exalting the tapes almost worshiping the
[1:00:32] tapes pretending brother ram is alive
[1:00:33] and he's still their pastor and he can
[1:00:35] still marry them
[1:00:37] just
[1:00:38] a lot of
[1:00:39] erroneous doctrines
[1:00:42] we can see the results of those seeds
[1:00:45] those were seeds planted in 2001
[1:00:49] this brother and the ministry exalting
[1:00:51] themselves above the other and look at
[1:00:52] the results all these years later
[1:00:55] god be merciful
[1:00:58] so the quote says you you might be
[1:01:00] eating stolen bread my friend this is
[1:01:02] from
[1:01:03] here i stand in 2001. but it's not
[1:01:05] because there's a famine among the bride
[1:01:07] or because i have scheme to keep food
[1:01:09] from your table
[1:01:10] as some would have you to believe the
[1:01:13] food has been stored up why should the
[1:01:15] bride be starving the granaries are
[1:01:16] stocked
[1:01:17] food is available in 45 languages end
[1:01:20] quote
[1:01:22] so in genesis 41 it said the famine was
[1:01:24] over all the face of the earth and
[1:01:26] joseph opened all the storehouses
[1:01:29] and sold unto the egyptians
[1:01:31] and the famine wax soar in the land of
[1:01:33] egypt and all the countries came into
[1:01:36] egypt to joseph for to buy corn
[1:01:38] because that the famine was so sore in
[1:01:40] all the lands
[1:01:43] so the real type is joseph's
[1:01:46] wife azaneth
[1:01:48] typing the gentile bride and joseph
[1:01:50] typing jesus christ
[1:01:52] because jesus christ is the one who
[1:01:55] has all the stored up food
[1:01:57] right he's got it all stored up
[1:02:00] and even if you look at the type there
[1:02:01] were storehouses in every every city
[1:02:03] location well that's not how it is
[1:02:05] jeffersonville thinks they're the only
[1:02:06] storehouse that doesn't fit the type
[1:02:09] right
[1:02:10] so the type would be there's a
[1:02:11] storehouse or there's a local church
[1:02:14] all over right there's many places to be
[1:02:16] fed praise god
[1:02:18] uh but the one who controls it all and
[1:02:21] feeds all is jesus christ amen because
[1:02:24] he's in control of all of it he knows he
[1:02:26] knows all where it's all at he's the one
[1:02:27] who organized it planned it out that's
[1:02:30] jesus christ took care of that
[1:02:32] so egypt is correctly typed to the world
[1:02:34] running to and fro around the world
[1:02:37] searching for food
[1:02:38] fulfilling the prophecy of amos 8 verses
[1:02:42] 11 and 12.
[1:02:43] joseph's brethren are correctly typed as
[1:02:45] the 144
[1:02:47] 000. so amos 8 says there's a famine
[1:02:50] not a bread
[1:02:52] but the hearing of the words of the lord
[1:02:54] and isn't that prophetic also about how
[1:02:56] the the truth would be lost through the
[1:02:58] church ages
[1:03:00] if the truth wasn't lost then you could
[1:03:02] find bread in every church right no
[1:03:04] matter what denomination
[1:03:06] but if the truth was lost and there was
[1:03:08] only a small group who would have it
[1:03:10] restored to them then this would make
[1:03:12] sense
[1:03:13] there's a famine for the hearing of the
[1:03:15] words of god
[1:03:17] so churches will travel over planes
[1:03:19] conferences all over the world of course
[1:03:21] it stopped during 2020 but starting to
[1:03:22] pick back up again
[1:03:24] thinking they're traveling there to get
[1:03:26] the food but they're missing the
[1:03:27] revelation on marriage and divorce they
[1:03:29] don't have the revelation they marry
[1:03:30] they're adulterers right they don't have
[1:03:32] the revelation on holiness
[1:03:34] they're paying to face jezebels and i
[1:03:36] don't say that arrogantly but that's
[1:03:38] that's what many of them are they
[1:03:39] control their husbands right they're
[1:03:41] dominating females
[1:03:44] cutting their hair dishonoring their
[1:03:45] husband as the sisters and men that cuss
[1:03:47] and smoking are adulterers in their
[1:03:49] hearts
[1:03:50] right
[1:03:51] unholy
[1:03:52] unthankful
[1:03:54] unnatural you know
[1:03:57] addicted to all kinds of things you know
[1:03:59] pornography and
[1:04:00] food like we said on sunday food
[1:04:02] idleness addicted to idleness and
[1:04:04] laziness
[1:04:06] because of all the excessive natural
[1:04:08] food
[1:04:09] and not working for the lord like they
[1:04:10] ought to many of these preachers have
[1:04:12] fallen over the last few years the
[1:04:14] big name preachers into
[1:04:16] money money laundering and
[1:04:18] uh adulteries all kinds of wickedness
[1:04:20] you know and by their fruits they're
[1:04:23] known
[1:04:24] but we want to be not a corrupt tree but
[1:04:26] we want to be a a good tree that
[1:04:28] produces good fruit and we can by
[1:04:30] staying attached to the vine we are the
[1:04:32] branches christ is the vine praise god
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:36] so that fulfills uh
[1:04:39] amos 8 and makes this
[1:04:41] make sense no wonder there's a famine
[1:04:43] for the hearing of the word no wonder
[1:04:46] because the truth has been lost down to
[1:04:48] the church ages and it's only restored
[1:04:50] in a small group jesus said fear not my
[1:04:52] little flock it's your father's good
[1:04:54] will to give you the kingdom
[1:04:58] okay
[1:05:00] so brother
[1:05:00] repeatedly said uh joseph types christ
[1:05:03] here it is in the church age book let's
[1:05:05] examine the life of joseph while he was
[1:05:06] in egypt for it is here we see him as
[1:05:08] the perfect type of christ he never said
[1:05:11] my son right brother never said that but
[1:05:14] brother man did say i pray that billy
[1:05:16] paul would fully be a prophet of god was
[1:05:18] he no
[1:05:20] brother ram did say rebecca will take my
[1:05:22] place did she no
[1:05:24] okay
[1:05:25] brother brown did say billy paul's my
[1:05:27] promise joseph was he no
[1:05:31] so those are fathers hopes those are you
[1:05:33] know loving dads would want that i mean
[1:05:35] what dad doesn't want his son and
[1:05:36] daughters to grow up and
[1:05:38] be spiritual and leaders and
[1:05:41] anointed with all kinds of gifts of the
[1:05:42] holy spirit i want that for all my
[1:05:44] children
[1:05:45] and i hope that is and i pray to that
[1:05:48] but just because i believe something if
[1:05:49] god doesn't show me that doesn't mean
[1:05:51] it's going to happen
[1:05:56] and then in a prisoner 1963 july 17th
[1:06:00] brother branham said
[1:06:01] i see one before me now his name is
[1:06:03] joseph he was an elected son he was a
[1:06:04] perfect type of jesus christ he was born
[1:06:06] a prophet he was a prophet also saw
[1:06:09] visions and so forth brothers bowing to
[1:06:11] him you can read that quote if you like
[1:06:14] now here's what i want to say too
[1:06:15] brother ma'am recognize that these
[1:06:17] spirits
[1:06:19] that got on people to make his every
[1:06:20] word infallible
[1:06:24] they cannot be reasoned with
[1:06:28] and yet they say they believe every word
[1:06:30] of brother branham this is from
[1:06:32] 1961 revelation chapter 5 part 2.
[1:06:38] he said how could they do it
[1:06:40] he said
[1:06:41] 15 or 20 people thinking i was jesus
[1:06:44] christ
[1:06:46] i was right on to them until i found out
[1:06:48] that god told me it was a spirit
[1:06:51] and the them said men said and the men
[1:06:54] believe me every word i know that just
[1:06:56] sound like this movement out of
[1:06:57] jeffersonville
[1:06:59] i said how do you believe me then if i
[1:07:02] tell you then we got to the word then
[1:07:04] they begin to see well we sure we didn't
[1:07:06] believe you or we would have listened
[1:07:07] what you'd said see here
[1:07:10] but they actually thought they were
[1:07:11] right sincerely see and one of them
[1:07:13] spirits gets on you that's got it see
[1:07:15] you'll absolutely believe it i don't
[1:07:17] care you nobody can tell you any
[1:07:19] different
[1:07:21] see no matter how much the word says so
[1:07:22] well you just believe it anyhow just go
[1:07:24] on
[1:07:26] remember leadership from jeffersonville
[1:07:29] has said that they don't care brother
[1:07:30] ma'am lied on the tape they said they're
[1:07:32] still going to believe it
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:35] so
[1:07:36] that's to me that's revealing the spirit
[1:07:38] that they're under yeah
[1:07:40] well see we need to be under the real
[1:07:42] joseph the lord jesus christ
[1:07:45] amen amen because he's the type for this
[1:07:47] day it fits perfectly how he's feeding
[1:07:50] us all thank god we're the wife and
[1:07:51] jesus wife joseph's wife never was
[1:07:53] starving
[1:07:54] and we're never starving we always got a
[1:07:55] good solid meal the word of god thank
[1:07:57] god for his grace and mercy we're
[1:07:59] feasting on the message of the hour
[1:08:00] praise god
[1:08:02] stored up food
[1:08:05] all right let's move on to benjamin here
[1:08:06] let me check my time
[1:08:08] okay now of course much more could be
[1:08:10] said about joseph but i'll stop there
[1:08:13] because i want to get this thought here
[1:08:14] finished
[1:08:16] because you can see of course how the
[1:08:17] prophecies were about joseph and
[1:08:19] even him and his his overcoming of his
[1:08:22] brethren and so forth and loving them
[1:08:23] forgiving them and then all the
[1:08:25] blessings that remain on he and his
[1:08:26] offspring in the promised land
[1:08:29] getting the birthright the best of the
[1:08:31] land all those great all the blessings
[1:08:33] of the womb you know all the great
[1:08:34] blessings that god gives to his children
[1:08:38] joseph's family received
[1:08:41] okay so benjamin now benjamin was
[1:08:47] a tribe here it's a little bit south of
[1:08:50] uh of ephraim and dan and gad a little
[1:08:54] bit
[1:08:54] it's kind of close to judah so north of
[1:08:56] judah
[1:08:59] uh so let's look at uh some scriptures
[1:09:01] on
[1:09:01] benjamin here i'm sorry we never read
[1:09:03] questions you never read did you i'm
[1:09:05] sorry yeah let me get back i never i
[1:09:07] guess i never read those scriptures
[1:09:11] do you want to read on you or do you
[1:09:11] want me to read it
[1:09:13] okay
[1:09:13] yeah i'm sorry let's go back we i missed
[1:09:15] those uh joe subscription let me read
[1:09:16] those um deuteronomy
[1:09:18] 33 and then 13-17
[1:09:23] and if joseph he said blessed of the
[1:09:26] lord be his land and the precious things
[1:09:28] of heaven
[1:09:30] for the dew and for the deep that
[1:09:32] couches beneath and for the precious
[1:09:35] fruits brought forth by the sun and for
[1:09:37] the precious things brought forth by the
[1:09:39] men
[1:09:40] and for the chief things of the ancient
[1:09:42] mountains and for the precious things of
[1:09:45] the lasting hills and for the precious
[1:09:47] things of the earth and the fullness
[1:09:49] thereof and for the good will of him
[1:09:52] that dwelt in the bush let the blessing
[1:09:54] come upon the head of joseph and that
[1:09:57] upon the top of the head of him
[1:09:59] that was separated from his brethren his
[1:10:02] glory like is the first swing of the
[1:10:05] bullet and his horns are like the horns
[1:10:07] of the unicorns
[1:10:09] and with them he shall push the people
[1:10:12] together to the ends of the earth
[1:10:14] and they are the ten thousand of
[1:10:17] ephraim and the and they are the
[1:10:20] thousands of manasseh thank you hon so
[1:10:22] we can again see more about prophecy
[1:10:24] regarding joseph and then his sons
[1:10:27] ephraim and
[1:10:28] manasseh notice how his glory is like to
[1:10:31] the first sling of the bullock there's
[1:10:32] the first sling firstborn
[1:10:35] you can see how that prophecy was in
[1:10:36] there and later played out beautiful
[1:10:38] thank you keisha thanks malachi for
[1:10:40] reading
[1:10:41] i appreciate that
[1:10:42] okay so now let's go back to benjamin
[1:10:44] there
[1:10:46] his name means the son of my right hand
[1:10:50] i'm gonna start with deuteronomy 33 12.
[1:10:56] this is of course moses
[1:10:58] and a benjamin he said the beloved lord
[1:11:01] shall dwell in safety by him
[1:11:03] and the lord shall cover him all the day
[1:11:05] long
[1:11:08] and he shall dwell between his shoulders
[1:11:10] what a blessing
[1:11:12] that god would cover you all the day
[1:11:14] long
[1:11:15] i had a brother from india emailed me
[1:11:17] this week and he said brother should we
[1:11:19] pray the blood of jesus over our lives
[1:11:20] every day or is it just one sufficient i
[1:11:23] said well it seemed like you'd want to
[1:11:24] do it every day
[1:11:25] because people can reject the blood
[1:11:28] and the scripture was hebrews 10 29
[1:11:30] people that were once sanctified by the
[1:11:31] blood can then turn around and trample
[1:11:33] underfoot the son of god afresh
[1:11:35] and then also the lord's prayer lead us
[1:11:37] not into temptation but delivers from
[1:11:39] evil it's a daily prayer
[1:11:42] so in other words you're asking for the
[1:11:43] leadership of the holy spirit and then
[1:11:45] the bible says the blood of christ the
[1:11:46] everlasting covenant in hebrews 13
[1:11:49] 19 and 20 will make you perfect unto
[1:11:51] every good work what does the blood the
[1:11:54] blood makes you perfect for every work
[1:11:56] in other words the life of god and the
[1:11:58] forgiveness of jesus blood will make you
[1:12:00] perfect to do every good work your
[1:12:03] schoolwork
[1:12:04] all right your
[1:12:05] uh your ministry your music ministry you
[1:12:08] know
[1:12:09] uh
[1:12:10] anything at all you know your future
[1:12:12] ministry you know your future job
[1:12:14] uh
[1:12:15] your singing ministry you know you think
[1:12:17] of everything god's given to you
[1:12:20] the blood of christ makes you perfect in
[1:12:22] those ministries just constantly
[1:12:25] confessing obeying the holy spirit
[1:12:28] staying true to god
[1:12:30] that god's gonna bless you in all those
[1:12:31] ministries
[1:12:33] okay now the uh
[1:12:35] uh commentator adam clark said
[1:12:38] this is prophetic of jerusalem because
[1:12:41] jerusalem was within the coast of
[1:12:43] benjamin
[1:12:45] where the temple of god would be built
[1:12:48] and that's where they get he'll dwell
[1:12:49] among the shoulders so the two mountains
[1:12:51] is what adam clark said which would be
[1:12:53] pretty powerful
[1:12:55] mariah and zion
[1:12:58] be pretty powerful and i'm gonna dwell
[1:12:59] there i'm gonna cover them all day long
[1:13:01] we sang about that right
[1:13:03] it's the joy of the whole earth is mount
[1:13:05] zion the city of the great king
[1:13:08] so just a beautiful there seemed to be a
[1:13:10] beautiful prophecy
[1:13:12] of of course solomon building the temple
[1:13:14] there david had the tabernacle but
[1:13:16] solomon built the temple
[1:13:19] and then of course the future coming of
[1:13:20] the millennial temple of jesus christ to
[1:13:22] rest right there of course the earth
[1:13:24] will raise up the bible said i believe
[1:13:25] in isaiah chapter two
[1:13:28] a mountain will raise up and then a
[1:13:29] mountain will sit upon a mountain praise
[1:13:31] god beautiful
[1:13:33] beautiful prophecy of our lord
[1:13:36] now i'm going to go to genesis 49 27 for
[1:13:39] the other one
[1:13:44] 49-27 so benjamin again is a very
[1:13:48] uh
[1:13:49] very short prophecy
[1:13:52] only two verses
[1:13:54] and benjamin shall raven
[1:13:57] as a wolf
[1:13:59] he'll be a ravenous wolf
[1:14:02] in the morning he shall devour the prey
[1:14:04] and at night he shall divide the spoil
[1:14:07] or the plunder
[1:14:08] the hebrew says
[1:14:11] okay so albert barnes looked at this and
[1:14:14] the pro the prophecy was fulfilled
[1:14:16] because benjamin was a very warlike
[1:14:18] tribe
[1:14:19] by both character
[1:14:21] and conduct now conduct is a good one
[1:14:24] character is not you don't want a
[1:14:25] warring character
[1:14:28] but that's kind of what they got
[1:14:30] wasn't saul trying to kill david i think
[1:14:32] he's using all his warring powers and
[1:14:34] abilities to try to kill his own
[1:14:36] son-in-law who've done nothing wrong
[1:14:39] so we have that idea of a war-like
[1:14:41] character but also conduct
[1:14:45] and this tribe produced some warriors
[1:14:48] like e-hood remember ehood was a
[1:14:49] left-handed man the second deliverer
[1:14:52] or judge of israel he's the one that
[1:14:54] snuck in there to egg line and deceived
[1:14:56] him and
[1:14:57] he stuck that knife through right with
[1:14:59] the left hand and
[1:15:01] he was a great mighty deliverer he was
[1:15:02] from the tribe of benjamin
[1:15:04] then you have saul and jonathan
[1:15:07] i remember david looked at after he died
[1:15:08] so these men were stronger than lions
[1:15:10] they were swifter than eagles
[1:15:12] they were some really great warriors
[1:15:14] unfortunately though saul had an evil
[1:15:16] spirit on him the majority of his
[1:15:18] adulthood
[1:15:20] and kingship which caused great disgrace
[1:15:22] upon him but again we see this idea of a
[1:15:25] ravening wolf right
[1:15:27] a ferocious
[1:15:29] uh
[1:15:30] predator
[1:15:31] warrior
[1:15:32] we see that being played out
[1:15:34] in some of their descendants
[1:15:38] okay
[1:15:39] now
[1:15:42] another prominent individual was the
[1:15:44] apostle paul
[1:15:46] came in the tribe of benjamin right
[1:15:49] so that was
[1:15:51] important
[1:15:55] benjaminites had some also
[1:15:57] prominent left-handed men
[1:15:59] as we talked about e-hood
[1:16:02] benjamin was also the center of a civil
[1:16:04] war that devastated them so that's where
[1:16:06] they get that wolf in character
[1:16:09] a civil war
[1:16:10] nearly destroyed them remember because
[1:16:12] they wouldn't give up those sons of
[1:16:14] belle isle that did the awful things to
[1:16:15] the concubine levites concubine if i'm
[1:16:18] not mistaken it's in genesis chapters 19
[1:16:20] through 21
[1:16:22] and they were almost totally wiped out
[1:16:26] um benjamin also included some famous
[1:16:28] cities like bethel
[1:16:30] but eventually idols were set up there
[1:16:32] for israel to worship and
[1:16:34] but then also of course
[1:16:37] contain jerusalem which many times was a
[1:16:39] great center of worship
[1:16:47] so we see that benjamin had a
[1:16:50] a strong start but then became cruel
[1:16:56] and we see that played out through the
[1:16:58] different histories
[1:17:01] okay looks like we got most of that
[1:17:04] oh yeah one more thing too this is
[1:17:05] beautiful
[1:17:06] benjamin was famous for their archers
[1:17:10] so let's go to first chronicles
[1:17:14] uh
[1:17:15] 8 40.
[1:17:16] i'll read that
[1:17:20] so again like the wolves right the
[1:17:21] warrior the predator type of people
[1:17:24] first chronicles 840.
[1:17:29] and the sons of ulam were mighty men of
[1:17:32] valor archers and had many sons and son
[1:17:35] sons and 150 all these were the sons of
[1:17:38] benjamin
[1:17:41] chapter 12 verse 2.
[1:17:49] they were armed with bows and could use
[1:17:51] both the right hand and the left in
[1:17:53] hurling stones and shooting arrows out
[1:17:55] of a bow even of saul's brethren a
[1:17:58] benjamin think about that both
[1:18:00] i think it's called ambidextrous right
[1:18:02] where you can use both
[1:18:03] right hand just as good as your left
[1:18:05] hand
[1:18:06] with the
[1:18:08] stones and the bow
[1:18:10] they were like the scripture said they
[1:18:12] were going to be ravenous wolves
[1:18:14] they were going to hunt they were going
[1:18:16] to be warriors and then divide the spoil
[1:18:19] just according to the scripture
[1:18:26] okay so we can see the prophecy here all
[1:18:29] fulfilled
[1:18:30] and then also a beautiful type of
[1:18:32] jerusalem
[1:18:33] uh being the place where god would dwell
[1:18:36] a beautiful type there so we see with
[1:18:37] many of the sons you know some had some
[1:18:40] had all good things said about him but
[1:18:41] then others had some negative but then
[1:18:44] would be redeemed and have some positive
[1:18:47] uh you know prophecies as well so we
[1:18:49] thank god doesn't that speak to us about
[1:18:51] amazing grace
[1:18:53] there's going to be some christians that
[1:18:54] really live the high calling right
[1:18:56] they're going to be exalted like joseph
[1:18:58] judah type of christians but there's
[1:19:00] going to be other ones that maybe have
[1:19:01] difficult starts but god's going to be
[1:19:03] able to redeem their lives and make
[1:19:04] something beautiful out of their lives
[1:19:06] praise god and so we're just thankful
[1:19:09] for that and we want to be
[1:19:10] the faithful ones we want to be ones
[1:19:12] that always stay true to god
[1:19:14] able to overcome trials and temptations
[1:19:18] and the bible says give all diligence to
[1:19:20] make your calling elections sure so we
[1:19:22] want to be the ones that are diligently
[1:19:23] serving god there's no question where we
[1:19:26] stand right
[1:19:27] people look at our lives and they see
[1:19:28] all these people are abiding in the vine
[1:19:31] they're abiding in christ jesus may god
[1:19:33] give us that type of testimony
[1:19:36] all the days of our life that we can
[1:19:38] accomplish
[1:19:39] god's will for our life because that's
[1:19:40] really at the heart of it it's not for
[1:19:42] self-exaltation or self-reward
[1:19:44] it's uh pleasing the heart of god
[1:19:48] right jesus said i always do that which
[1:19:50] pleases the father
[1:19:52] and that's what our desire should be to
[1:19:54] to please our heavenly father as well
[1:19:59] now in closing i'm just going to briefly
[1:20:00] say a few words about joshua 20. so i'm
[1:20:03] going to close with that so now i'm done
[1:20:05] with those 12 tribes by god's grace we
[1:20:08] finished those 12 tribes and seen all
[1:20:10] their prophecies
[1:20:11] or many of their prophecies throughout
[1:20:13] the scripture there
[1:20:14] and how although we can't maybe
[1:20:16] understand them ourselves we know god
[1:20:18] fulfilled
[1:20:19] all of them and we can
[1:20:21] we can see with our own eyes and our
[1:20:23] spiritual mind in the scriptures in
[1:20:24] history
[1:20:25] we can see how most of them were
[1:20:27] fulfilled
[1:20:28] and again 400 years or 100 years before
[1:20:32] they happened
[1:20:33] it doesn't matter to god because god
[1:20:34] sees the beginning from the end the
[1:20:36] spirit of jesus christ is the spirit of
[1:20:38] prophecy
[1:20:39] so that encourages us everything god
[1:20:41] foresaw about our lives will come to
[1:20:42] pass god knew he wanted us living in
[1:20:44] 2012
[1:20:46] so we could be a light and witnesses and
[1:20:48] we can be standards we the bible said we
[1:20:51] can be examples to the people
[1:20:53] uh and we would be a city on a hill that
[1:20:55] could not be hit and we'd be a bride who
[1:20:57] made herself ready praise god we were
[1:20:59] chosen for that
[1:21:00] we've got to walk in that
[1:21:02] and fulfill that scripture just like
[1:21:04] jesus fulfilled the scripture for his
[1:21:05] day
[1:21:06] praise god
[1:21:08] okay so let's close with joshua 20
[1:21:12] 1-6 i'm gonna do it on time okay
[1:21:16] the lord also spake unto joshua saying
[1:21:17] speak to the children of israel saying a
[1:21:19] point out of
[1:21:20] i'll say out for you cities of refuge
[1:21:23] wherefore i spake unto you by the hand
[1:21:25] of moses that the slayer that killed any
[1:21:27] person unawares
[1:21:29] and unwittingly may flee thither and
[1:21:31] they shall be your refuge from the
[1:21:33] avenger of blood
[1:21:36] and when he that doth flee unto one of
[1:21:38] those cities shall stand at the entering
[1:21:40] of the gate of the city and shall
[1:21:41] declare his cause and the ears of the
[1:21:43] elders of the city
[1:21:44] they shall take him into the city unto
[1:21:46] them and give him a place that he may
[1:21:48] dwell among them
[1:21:50] if the avenger of blood pursue after him
[1:21:52] then they shall not deliver the slayer
[1:21:53] up into his hand because he smote his
[1:21:55] neighbor unwittingly
[1:21:57] and hated him not a four time or
[1:21:59] unintentionally
[1:22:02] and he shall dwell in that city until he
[1:22:04] stand before the congregation for
[1:22:06] judgment and until the death of the high
[1:22:07] priest
[1:22:08] that shall be in those days then shall
[1:22:10] the slayer return and come unto his own
[1:22:12] city under his own house
[1:22:14] under the city from whence he fled
[1:22:18] of course the rest of the chapter
[1:22:20] verses 7 and 9 is about this as well
[1:22:24] i just i was thinking about this and i
[1:22:26] remembered a quote from brother branham
[1:22:27] so i just want to close this quote from
[1:22:28] brother brown just a beautiful thought
[1:22:34] he says now if you want to do right
[1:22:38] he said i'm so glad tonight to tell you
[1:22:40] that there is a city of refuge
[1:22:43] he said that's jesus christ
[1:22:47] if you don't want to do wrong
[1:22:50] the enemy's after you then there is a
[1:22:52] way of escape how many feel like the
[1:22:54] enemy sometimes after that you're trying
[1:22:56] to do right
[1:22:57] right and this in this case it was
[1:22:58] unintentional you did you didn't mean to
[1:23:00] do anything wrong
[1:23:02] sometimes the devil seems like he's
[1:23:03] after you
[1:23:04] and brother ram said then there's a way
[1:23:06] of escape and that escape is jesus
[1:23:08] christ
[1:23:10] there's a place where you can come and
[1:23:12] let off the steam amen
[1:23:14] but if you're
[1:23:16] loved to sin
[1:23:17] and you don't want god then the enemy is
[1:23:19] going to overtake you somewhere
[1:23:23] you have you can't come to christ
[1:23:25] because you don't want to
[1:23:28] and when this man comes to christ this
[1:23:29] place of refuge when a man come in the
[1:23:31] old testament the first thing he had to
[1:23:33] come upon his own free will so they
[1:23:36] couldn't force him had to be his own
[1:23:38] desire i want to be free i want to be
[1:23:39] safe
[1:23:40] i want to stop running from the devil
[1:23:42] right
[1:23:43] i want a place where i can rest
[1:23:45] that's the only
[1:23:47] that's the way you have to come to
[1:23:48] christ
[1:23:49] you've got to want it yourself you have
[1:23:52] to be tired of running from your past
[1:23:54] right tired of running from
[1:23:56] your previous mistakes
[1:23:58] what a beautiful thought that is praise
[1:24:00] god
[1:24:01] at church we shouldn't run from him you
[1:24:02] know we should go confess our sins right
[1:24:05] that's really the city of refuge right
[1:24:07] we confess our sins confess our faults
[1:24:08] one to another and the bible says pray
[1:24:10] for those that are sick and god will
[1:24:12] heal them praise god
[1:24:14] james chapter 5 we confess our faults
[1:24:16] one to another
[1:24:18] not running from our problems but
[1:24:20] dealing with our problems
[1:24:23] and being a respectful
[1:24:25] honest sincere christian
[1:24:31] i'm going to continue the quote another
[1:24:32] thing you must be satisfied while you're
[1:24:35] there
[1:24:37] you can't hang around every day crying
[1:24:39] i'd like to get out of here i like to
[1:24:40] get out of here
[1:24:41] they put you out brother says
[1:24:45] you must willingly
[1:24:47] want to stay it must be that you must
[1:24:49] want to stay
[1:24:50] in that city
[1:24:53] and when you come to christ you can't
[1:24:54] look back to the world the bible said he
[1:24:56] that puts his hand on the plow and turns
[1:24:58] the look back is not worthy of plowing
[1:25:02] like we think of mrs lot right lot's
[1:25:04] wife
[1:25:05] looking back
[1:25:06] now there's where there's where so many
[1:25:08] so-called christians make their mistakes
[1:25:10] see they act like they're going to plow
[1:25:12] but the first little thing comes along
[1:25:14] they blow up about it
[1:25:18] okay and they lose their place of safety
[1:25:21] so i'm closing with that
[1:25:23] may god help us uh to remember
[1:25:26] that if we want to do right there's a
[1:25:28] place of safety for us where we don't
[1:25:30] have to run from our our past run from
[1:25:32] our problems
[1:25:33] that's in jesus christ
[1:25:36] and we can stay there as long as we want
[1:25:38] to praise god it's a free gift we can
[1:25:40] have that gift as long as we want it
[1:25:42] and my prayer is that we'll have it so
[1:25:44] long it'll be sealed into us praise god
[1:25:47] and then we'll never leave praise god
[1:25:48] because we're sealed not to the next
[1:25:51] high priest lives or dies you know we're
[1:25:53] sealed to the day of our redemption in
[1:25:56] christ jesus all right america can come
