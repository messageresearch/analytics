[24:48] let's go to second Corinthians four then
[24:53] we'll read our memory verse after that
[25:03] same Corinthians 4:16 like to look at
[25:13] the mystery of godliness restored a man
[25:16] again tonight this is where I'm hoping
[25:18] to get by the end by God's grace so I'm
[25:21] going to really try to endeavor to get
[25:23] here and Lord willing tonight we'll
[25:29] continue looking at how the character
[25:31] traits on the Statue of a perfect man
[25:34] can be added or lost now verse 16 is
[25:48] what I worry and I'll read 16 and 17 and
[25:51] then we'll go to isaiah 12 and read that
[25:54] together there 16 for which cause we
[25:57] faint not but though our outward man
[25:59] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[26:02] by day so we have quite a thing going on
[26:06] in our bodies we get weaker and weaker
[26:09] in our bodies but then our spirit we
[26:11] should get stronger and stronger and
[26:13] newer and newer by the grace of the Lord
[26:16] that's our great choice every day to
[26:19] draw closer to God or to draw closer to
[26:22] the world let's draw closer to God
[26:23] tonight that's why your lives should
[26:25] meet praise God then Lord should bless
[26:27] you in that verse 17 for our light
[26:30] affliction which is but for a moment
[26:35] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[26:39] eternal weight of glory
[26:43] so believers have a weight of glory
[26:48] there's a heavenly eternal weight or
[26:52] substance in glory that awaits the
[26:56] believer
[26:56] so see as we add God's character we do
[27:00] God's works and it produces an eternal
[27:03] weight in heaven so let's go to isaiah
[27:08] 12:2 as a twelve to the three two
[27:33] through five let's begin on three one
[27:36] two three
[27:37] behold god is my salvation i will trust
[27:41] and not be afraid for the lord jehovah
[27:45] is my strength and my son he also is
[27:50] become my salvation therefore with joy
[27:55] shadi draw water out of the wells of
[27:58] salvation and in that day shall you say
[28:03] praise the lord call upon his name
[28:06] declare his doings among the people they
[28:11] mention that his name is exalted sitting
[28:14] into the line or he has done excellent
[28:17] things this is known in the earth amen
[28:22] may God has blessing the ringers word
[28:23] may be see
[28:38] so nor willing tonight we'll look at
[28:41] this mystery of godliness restore demand
[28:45] again appreciate everybody's patience
[28:53] you know going through this series
[28:58] that's part of your Christian attributes
[29:01] his patience praise God
[29:03] it's so wonderful for me bleed for you
[29:08] to to see how scriptural all of brother
[29:11] branham's sermons really work you know
[29:14] there's a human element there's a human
[29:15] side where it was just his opinions or
[29:18] thoughts but on his doctrines and his
[29:22] teachings that he he reference over and
[29:24] over it's beautiful to see how
[29:28] scriptural everything was and I I'm I'm
[29:33] a first-hand witness to that you know
[29:34] having written a book about modesty and
[29:36] I writing this book about brother
[29:38] branham's ministry was to finish the
[29:40] mystery of God so basically as I've been
[29:43] studying this week I've thought about
[29:44] that I'm writing just a scriptural
[29:47] summary of all the major highlights
[29:53] brother branham's and ministry I'm he
[29:55] hated the highlights and then I'm just
[29:57] pulling all the scriptures together and
[29:59] bringing it all together so you can see
[30:01] even more of the picture that's what
[30:04] brother Graham said even when he
[30:05] preached the seals he said I could only
[30:06] hit the highlights even when he preached
[30:08] the statue of hereford man he said he
[30:11] said each character trait deserves its
[30:13] own day its own sermon right and so
[30:17] brother Ram said you could preach for
[30:18] months on just one seal and no doubt you
[30:21] could preach months just on faith as
[30:23] we've seen you could preach months on
[30:26] virtue and knowledge and all these
[30:27] different things so really we're just
[30:29] hitting we're just trying to find more
[30:32] details on the highlights brother Graham
[30:34] hit the highlights for sure and we're
[30:36] trying to add to that and make it so
[30:39] plain that it's undeniable the only way
[30:42] you would deny it it wouldn't be because
[30:45] you can't see it's because you don't
[30:47] want to see it
[30:48] and we know that's exactly what Paul
[30:49] says is going to happen the reason
[30:51] people are gonna perish is because they
[30:54] did not receive the love of the truth
[30:57] they could have but they turn down the
[31:00] love for truth which is a love for the
[31:03] Bible so I want my family I want the
[31:07] church I pastor that God has given in my
[31:09] care to know the Bible right because if
[31:12] you love the truth then the truth makes
[31:15] you free praise God
[31:16] amen so that's so now tonight Lord
[31:19] whether you want to pick up and we're
[31:21] look at how you you and I can either add
[31:25] the qualities or lose them and we have
[31:27] six texts about that we kind of we kind
[31:33] of majored on a couple of them and we'll
[31:35] go through that but I want to just
[31:37] revisit some of these again let's go to
[31:40] Matthew 12 29 and 30 so we'll have Lydia
[31:50] read Matthew 12 29 and 30 thank you and
[31:53] now Kevin don't you read 12 verses 43
[31:57] and through 45 so we're going now to one
[32:02] of these six scriptures that I felt as I
[32:04] was writing this clearly proved that
[32:07] people can receive God's virtues we call
[32:12] them character qualities in order to not
[32:15] use the word virtue over and over again
[32:16] or with different meanings to it you can
[32:20] receive God's character qualities or
[32:22] God's anointings
[32:23] but then lose him so Lydia Matthew 12 to
[32:29] 29 and 30
[32:34] first find the strong in that and then
[32:38] while he's boy in his house he does not
[32:40] with me is against me he that gathereth
[32:42] not with me scattereth abroad all right
[32:45] so Jesus clearly shows if you are with
[32:49] him you will keep his Goods in your
[32:52] house amen
[32:54] so if you are for Jesus you'll keep his
[32:57] anointings
[32:58] in your life if you're against him
[33:01] that you'll let his enemies come in bind
[33:05] up your faith right or bind up your
[33:08] strength like Samson that's a good
[33:11] example Samson bound up and then robbed
[33:16] he was robbed of his power right or the
[33:18] source of his power
[33:19] was keeping the vow so just like that he
[33:22] was robbed of just like that here Jesus
[33:26] says believers today can be robbed of
[33:27] God's blessings they had him but then
[33:30] they were the spoils weren't taken from
[33:33] the house okay now Malik I can read
[33:37] verses 43 through 45 then you say I will
[33:48] return into my house from once I came
[33:50] out when he has come he finds that empty
[33:52] swept and garnished then goeth he and
[33:55] taketh with himself seven other spirits
[33:57] more wicked than himself and they enter
[33:59] in and drove there and the last state of
[34:00] that man is worse than the first even so
[34:03] shall it be also unto this wicked
[34:04] generation Amen so Jesus says the
[34:07] generation in which he lived people
[34:10] could live a sanctified clean out life
[34:13] with no demons in their life but if they
[34:16] didn't get God's character qualities in
[34:19] there then evil spirits would come in
[34:22] more powerful right they were first
[34:24] delivered being first saved but then if
[34:27] they didn't fill it they didn't keep
[34:29] building up and possessing God's
[34:31] blessings and receiving more of his
[34:33] anointing and receiving more of his word
[34:35] than the enemy would come in spoil the
[34:37] blessings and then eight other demons
[34:40] would come in and now we know this
[34:42] happened to Judas and church with Judas
[34:44] it wasn't eight demons that came in it
[34:46] was Satan himself the chief demon and so
[34:50] we must be very careful Judas had his
[34:52] house cleaned out he had good qualities
[34:55] at one time but we know because of his
[34:57] thieving desires he eventually sold
[34:59] those out and that Satan himself came in
[35:02] his house okay we need the Holy Ghost to
[35:05] come into the house praise God and fill
[35:07] it up and keep out and seal out Satan
[35:10] until the day of redemption forever for
[35:13] eternity praise God
[35:15] so I want to hope I want everyone to see
[35:20] that that spiritual robbery you know we
[35:23] sang that song years ago went to the
[35:25] enemy's camp and took back what he stole
[35:27] from you right this is the scripture we
[35:30] can see for it also in David and David
[35:35] and I forget the name of the King there
[35:39] I can't remember when David had all of
[35:43] us came out of the city but David had
[35:46] his his wives and his family and all
[35:48] this good stolen then he had to pray and
[35:51] he prayed about it should I go get it
[35:54] and then he went out and got him and
[35:56] brought him back he he went and took
[35:58] what the enemy stole from him you know
[36:00] Abraham did the same right Abraham heard
[36:03] about lot his brother taking captive he
[36:05] took 400 men defeated five kings and the
[36:09] nine kings were five and then for four
[36:11] total nine kings and then he brought
[36:14] everything back in God's mercy did you
[36:18] find Ziklag Ziklag that's it
[36:22] Thank You Lydia all right as Susan I do
[36:25] it was a very interesting name of a city
[36:28] Ziklag so he went out of Ziklag and took
[36:32] back what Satan stole from him by the
[36:36] Word of God amen now let's look at one
[36:39] more scripture on this because remember
[36:41] brother Branham says Satan can't get in
[36:43] unless you let him in and then men of
[36:46] God or sisters cannot cast out demons
[36:49] unless the person wants to be free from
[36:52] that so let's go to 2nd Timothy 2:26
[36:56] case you can get that
[36:57] 2nd Timothy 2:26 I'm gonna get it too
[37:01] just in case there's some surrounding
[37:04] scriptures 2nd Timothy 2:26
[37:11] now speaking of ministers in verse 24 he
[37:15] said the servant of the Lord must not
[37:17] strive but be gentle unto all men have
[37:22] to teach and patient in meekness
[37:25] instructing those that oppose them
[37:28] sells so we have to look at people that
[37:31] have fallen away from the message or
[37:32] people that are still in church but are
[37:34] falling away from really loving God
[37:36] they're actually opposing themselves
[37:39] right there mine is against their soul
[37:42] right and we saw that with the man who
[37:44] built the barns right his soul his mind
[37:48] spoke to his soul and said soul take
[37:51] your ease don't worry about everything
[37:52] I'll take care of it we'll build build
[37:54] bigger barns he opposed himself in other
[37:59] words he was quenching that holy thirst
[38:01] with the world instead of instead of
[38:05] satisfying that holy thirst with the
[38:08] things of God hallelujah now look at
[38:11] this verse 25 if God peradventure will
[38:14] give them repentance to the
[38:16] acknowledging of the truth okay so a
[38:21] sinner or someone who's caught or
[38:24] addicted to certain things they must
[38:26] acknowledge the truth right they must
[38:29] acknowledge I'm addicted and it's my
[38:32] fault and I want to be free my house has
[38:36] a demon in it it shouldn't have a demon
[38:38] in it I acknowledge that and I
[38:42] acknowledge that I'm guilty
[38:43] I need forgiven and I want to be changed
[38:46] praise God verse 26 in case you can read
[38:49] that for us 2nd Timothy 2:26 you who are
[39:01] taking a cat tear that I hear at his
[39:04] room
[39:05] very good so see what is Paul saying we
[39:07] have to be meek as as Christians to try
[39:11] to give instruction to people who are
[39:13] hurting themselves so they can recover
[39:17] themselves out of Satan's trap because
[39:22] they were taken captive by Satan's will
[39:24] but remember they wanted it as well
[39:27] right they had a surrender their will
[39:30] before Satan program says before Satan
[39:33] could take you you got to go out to him
[39:35] you've got to leave the protection of
[39:37] the word the best exam the simplest one
[39:40] is Eve right II
[39:42] had to submit to the will of the serpent
[39:45] right the serpent couldn't force even to
[39:49] it but he had to deceive her by telling
[39:52] her a lie
[39:53] in church I was looking at that lie this
[39:54] week and I heard a preacher say in a way
[39:56] I'd never heard it before the lie was to
[40:02] make Eve the absolute I thought that was
[40:06] really good I never heard that before
[40:07] because the serpent said when you
[40:09] partake in this fruit you'll be wise
[40:11] like God knowing good and evil so see
[40:15] this is the this was the ability it was
[40:18] a saint was trying to convince her you
[40:20] can be the absolute instead of God being
[40:24] absolute you can be the absolute and
[40:26] that's the sin of the take church
[40:28] movement they're making brother Branham
[40:30] the absolute right instead of Jesus
[40:33] Christ but there's only one absolute
[40:34] praise the Lord so see Satan tricked her
[40:38] into thinking she could be elevated
[40:40] where she could be the absolute you and
[40:42] I must always keep our humility that the
[40:45] word is the absolute not us every day
[40:48] we need to cleanse our minds and filter
[40:52] our thoughts through the absolute of the
[40:54] Word of God we must not let Satan trick
[40:58] us into making ourselves something when
[41:00] we're nothing okay so see Christians can
[41:08] recover right they can recover
[41:11] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[41:14] like another good examples Kings saw
[41:15] King Saul was in a snare right a
[41:18] murderous spirit he threw javelins at
[41:22] David trying to kill him hunted him down
[41:24] his own son-in-law but eventually he
[41:27] repented he stopped it he recovered
[41:30] himself on that snare now of course he
[41:32] got into another one with the Witch of
[41:34] Endor and everything but it's just an
[41:36] example of how to you they can be
[41:37] recovered out of their fall okay so
[41:42] that's a good Scripture I want you to
[41:44] see that that ties in so recovering out
[41:47] of the snare of the devil it's very
[41:49] similar to Matthew 12 this idea of Satan
[41:52] taking captive spoiling you but those
[41:56] spirits or spirit can be driven out and
[41:58] you can recover your clean estate right
[42:01] so we've seen it today like Peter right
[42:04] like Peter as you preach on Sunday night
[42:06] he had virtue he lost it but he got
[42:09] recovered thank God that we can be
[42:12] recovered out of the snare or trap of
[42:15] the devil
[42:16] praise God all right now the second
[42:20] example we are looked at Luke 8 and the
[42:22] four kinds of believers the first ground
[42:26] believed for a while and Satan's snatch
[42:28] it away Jesus said they believed and I'm
[42:32] sorry the first one heard it didn't
[42:35] believe it and then Saint statue ate the
[42:37] second one believed for a while but it
[42:39] didn't have a good foundation right it
[42:41] was built upon this so I fell upon
[42:43] stones and it endured dearth for a while
[42:48] lasted for a season but is only
[42:51] temporarily and then it withered away
[42:54] and died so that's like Judas and that's
[42:57] like people today that could have start
[42:59] to have some growth they start getting
[43:02] some more anointing and more blessings
[43:05] of God but then it withers away because
[43:07] of their heart condition and then we
[43:12] looked at Hebrews three chapter three
[43:15] and four it's an allegory of Israel
[43:18] leaving Egypt to get to the promised
[43:20] land the church we saw that souls who
[43:23] died in the wilderness had gained many
[43:25] miles on the journey many miles but they
[43:29] lost every benefit because they doubted
[43:34] the next step okay because they down to
[43:37] the next step it made them want to go
[43:39] back to Egypt alright so they really
[43:42] made it that far but then lost they
[43:45] really in their hearts went back they
[43:46] lost everything because God shut them
[43:50] out of the promised land now let's go
[43:54] back to Hebrews 6 let's go back to
[43:57] Hebrews six six readers 6:1 Hebrews 6:1
[44:01] so I want to spend more time on this one
[44:03] here
[44:10] so these rap Lydia here Hebrews 6:1 I'm
[44:19] gonna have Lydia just read verse three
[44:22] so let me read Hebrew six three all
[44:30] right
[44:31] so Paul in verses 1 and 2 says all he
[44:35] lists all the beginning doctrines of
[44:38] Christianity such as faith repentance
[44:44] baptisms laying on of hands resurrection
[44:47] eternal judgment then Paul gives the
[44:50] same idea we'll leave those and move on
[44:55] to perfection if God permits so see we
[45:00] must work with God's will right to move
[45:03] on to greater teachings right greater
[45:06] understandings of God's Word so again
[45:09] it's like a journey right huge the
[45:12] children here I have to choose all of us
[45:14] have to choose to move on in your
[45:16] journey pass the elementary teachings of
[45:20] the gospel okay now next it shows about
[45:25] people that don't continue on to
[45:29] perfection but fall away in verse 4 so
[45:32] now I can read verse 4 verse 6 for where
[45:36] is it possible for those who were once
[45:39] enlightened and have tasted of the
[45:40] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[45:42] the Holy Ghost verse 5 and have tasted
[45:45] the good word of God and the powers of
[45:47] the world to come if they shall fall
[45:49] away to renew themselves again unto
[45:53] repentance seeing they crucify to
[45:54] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[45:57] him to an open shame my what a scripture
[46:01] so this is a lot like Judas again he
[46:05] tasted of the gifts of the Spirit he
[46:07] tasted of the good word of God he heard
[46:09] the best preacher preach the Lord Jesus
[46:11] Christ
[46:12] none of us could ever touch it if
[46:14] anybody had tasted if anybody had ever
[46:16] been enlightened it would have had to
[46:18] bend Judas but he fell OH
[46:20] from that he had it and he was there he
[46:24] had attributes he had anointing and
[46:27] power understanding but he fell away
[46:29] from that and he put Christ to an open
[46:33] shame publicly betraying him with the
[46:35] kiss now this portion ends let's go to
[46:41] verse 12 I was right verse 11 in case
[46:46] you can read verse 11 he verse 6 11 and
[46:48] we desire that every one of you do show
[46:52] the same diligence to the full assurance
[46:56] of hope unto the end ok so when dealing
[47:01] with falling away Paul emphasizes
[47:04] diligence so if you don't want to fall
[47:07] away if you want to continue on and
[47:10] press toward the mark of the high
[47:11] calling you've got to show diligence and
[47:14] we started this chapter by showing that
[47:16] godliness is obtainable Jesus says by
[47:20] giving all your strength all your love
[47:22] all your heart soul mind and strength
[47:24] praise God we got to give all of it in
[47:27] other words we got to give every fiber
[47:29] of our being over to the Holy Ghost
[47:31] praise God and obey Him in everything
[47:33] Amen hallelujah now in the middle of
[47:37] this portion notice he talks about the
[47:40] two seats now Church this the two seeds
[47:43] is only known by God right because none
[47:45] of us really know right just like at
[47:48] just like at Jesus's Last Supper did
[47:50] they know it was Judas that was going to
[47:52] betray do they know Judas was a thorn no
[47:55] but but Paul gives us this insight that
[47:58] really in God's eyes but by
[48:00] foreknowledge it's either one seed or
[48:02] the other right by his foreknowledge but
[48:05] we don't always know right we don't
[48:08] always know people that we thought were
[48:09] solid in the message would fall away and
[48:12] live like a devil and enjoy it
[48:14] and it's awful so that proves they were
[48:17] the wrong seed but we didn't know it all
[48:19] the time because they let they let their
[48:22] human spirits get cleaned out right
[48:24] their house got cleaned out for a while
[48:26] but they never filled it they never
[48:28] continued on and so then seven or eight
[48:31] seven more demons came in eight demons
[48:34] came into these people but verse 11 and
[48:37] 12 said we will inherit the promise if
[48:40] we're not slothful we can't be lazy we
[48:43] have to be diligent Christians
[48:45] hallelujah we must diligently with all
[48:47] of our effort serve God not be lazy but
[48:50] be hard workers for the kingdom of God
[48:52] amen
[48:53] in other words giving our will giving
[48:55] our strength surrendering our desires
[48:59] praise God with faith and patience to
[49:02] inherit the promises amen thank the Lord
[49:06] okay now this diligence is the same idea
[49:10] taught in the statute of a perfect man
[49:13] by Peter in 2nd Peter 1:5 and 1:10 I'll
[49:18] read that because I'm right here 2nd
[49:22] Peter 1 5 and 10 all my terms this
[49:27] statute over man teaching is rock solid
[49:30] it is absolutely the word of the Lord I
[49:33] believe with all my heart
[49:35] it is so see how this see on diligence
[49:38] and falling away goes hand in hand it's
[49:40] the same thing Peter says here beside
[49:44] this giving all diligence at faith to
[49:47] your to your virtue see if you want to
[49:50] if you want God to add more anointing to
[49:53] your life more understanding you got to
[49:55] be diligent amen you got to see God
[49:58] every day you got to pray and humble
[50:00] yourself and repent and stay true to God
[50:03] keep the house clean and fill it with
[50:04] good things amen
[50:06] pray for God to fill it with with faith
[50:08] and virtue of knowledge and patience of
[50:10] temperance godless brotherly kindness
[50:12] amen and then seal it off seal Satan out
[50:15] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost verse
[50:17] 10 wherefore the rather brethren give
[50:19] diligence to make your calling and
[50:22] election sure for if you do these things
[50:25] ye shall never fall what a promise will
[50:29] never fall if we fill the house with
[50:32] good things with treasures we'll never
[50:35] fall in let let Christ seal that Christ
[50:38] put a lock on that door and see all the
[50:40] good things in will never fall we'll be
[50:43] faithful and we'll have eight eternal
[50:45] weight of glory
[50:46] he's God that's beautiful night it just
[50:51] it just ties the whole Bible together
[50:53] like Bram said that was his ministry to
[50:55] take all the loose ends and tie them all
[50:58] together alright two more scriptures
[51:04] we're not going to read them because
[51:06] they're very familiar in 2nd Timothy 3:1
[51:08] to 7 Paul says in the last days perilous
[51:12] times will come because men will be
[51:14] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[51:17] God and he said they will fall away yeah
[51:22] they'll fall away there's a great
[51:23] falling away then 2nd Thessalonians 2:3
[51:26] says before the person the Antichrist
[51:29] can be revealed a great falling away or
[51:32] apostasy from the Christian faith has to
[51:35] occur so that means only believers can
[51:40] fall away and that's taught in 2nd Peter
[51:43] 2:21 so I'm going to read that second
[51:45] Peter 2:21 because I'm right there yes
[51:49] beautiful for it had been better for
[51:52] them not to have known the way of
[51:54] righteousness then after they've known
[51:57] it to turn from the holy commandment
[52:00] delivered unto them
[52:02] Peter said it'd be better not to know
[52:04] because the punishment would be less
[52:07] right just like there's there's degrees
[52:10] of punishment in hell now this is the
[52:13] thing I understand about people that say
[52:14] hell's eternal if hell is eternal
[52:18] everybody gets the worst punishment
[52:20] because it's gonna be forever right I'm
[52:23] just gonna be eternally but here it says
[52:27] there's different levels again it'd be
[52:30] better not to hear the gospel and face
[52:33] Jesus is judgment then to know it and
[52:36] then turn away from it alright so those
[52:40] are very clear teachings there you can
[52:43] see again people can know it they can be
[52:46] approaching it and then fall away and
[52:48] turn from it
[52:54] all right let's go to another Maine
[52:56] scripture another big text Hebrews 10
[52:59] let's go there by God's grace Hebrews
[53:02] 10:19 239 it's a long text but we'll hit
[53:05] the highlights here at church that's why
[53:12] I'm writing this book so I have a
[53:13] reference so if anyone ever tries to say
[53:17] people can't lose the anointing and
[53:20] people can't lose their salvation their
[53:22] scripture your six scriptures that say
[53:25] you can you can believe for a while and
[53:27] then let it die away you can have good
[53:30] things in your house and then have them
[53:31] stolen right you can be clean and then
[53:36] be dirty there's so many scriptures and
[53:41] it just it makes the Bible a new Bible
[53:44] it makes the Bible understandable
[53:47] because it's God's revelation of the
[53:49] Bible phrase God not a man it's God's
[53:52] it's Jesus's faith that we live by
[53:54] so Hebrews 10:19 239 so in this portion
[54:03] people can draw back unto perdition
[54:07] which means lose their confession of
[54:10] eternal life not believing unto the
[54:14] saving of the soul so that's verse 39
[54:20] I'm going to read that but we are not of
[54:21] them who draw back unto perdition but of
[54:25] them that believe to the saving of the
[54:27] soul now drawing back means retreating
[54:31] or shrinking back okay so again we get
[54:37] the idea of soldiers possessing the land
[54:40] right Israel possessing the land but
[54:43] then retreating from it you know you can
[54:47] take the land you know you can do it but
[54:49] then you retreat from it why would you
[54:50] do that we wouldn't do that we want to
[54:54] want to but people did it because of
[54:57] fear right Israel shrank back because of
[55:01] fear and doubt our enemies are too great
[55:03] our enemies are going but look at our
[55:05] God our enemies are bigger than us
[55:08] but our God is bigger than our enemies
[55:10] why should we retreat we should move on
[55:13] because God is with us and we God is
[55:15] with us who can be against us I love you
[55:18] look how great our God is look what he's
[55:20] already done the children even you have
[55:26] a good testimony because God has
[55:28] protected you and God has been with you
[55:31] and guided you so I may have I'm asking
[55:34] children to give their testimonies in
[55:35] July kind of thinking about that and
[55:38] just a head start you have to start
[55:40] having a testimony because you overcome
[55:43] Satan by the word of your testimony you
[55:48] have to have a story to tell I know a
[55:50] lot of my children are good storytellers
[55:52] but the the reason behind that is so you
[55:56] can overcome the enemy and if you want
[56:00] you can write them out and I'll read
[56:01] them for you I know some people are
[56:03] there's more nervous in front of other
[56:05] people but you have to have a story if
[56:08] not you don't even know where you came
[56:10] from you don't know where you're going
[56:11] you don't even know what you're doing in
[56:12] this life but you got to have a story
[56:15] you got to know that God's called you to
[56:17] something God's giving you blessings and
[56:20] you got to know what to do next praise
[56:22] God okay so on the road to eternal life
[56:33] you choose one of three options right
[56:35] you'd either finish strong or you become
[56:40] I don't stay in one place
[56:42] that's Israel stopping and stopping at
[56:46] Kadesh Barnea or you retreat from the
[56:49] narrow road to the broad road you give
[56:51] up entirely and go to another road okay
[56:59] so let's go to verse 26 so I'm not sure
[57:02] where I think we're at now I write
[57:05] because let me read that really small
[57:06] verse so Paul begins this section by
[57:10] talking about having a true heart of
[57:13] assurance of faith but and then he says
[57:17] Christians should gather more and more
[57:19] and edify one another now verses
[57:22] 26 and 29 show how if people sin
[57:27] willfully on purpose after knowing the
[57:31] truth it's grounds for punishment in
[57:34] other words the more you know the more
[57:36] you're accountable for
[57:38] so especially message people are going
[57:41] to be judged harshly if they're not
[57:44] obedient if they're obedient they'll be
[57:46] judged now praise God but they're not
[57:49] obedient they'll be judged at the white
[57:51] throne judgment for not obeying God's
[57:54] Word
[57:55] okay so Malachi read 26 please Hebrews
[57:59] 10:26 for if we sin willfully after that
[58:02] we have received the knowledge of the
[58:04] truth there remains no more sacrifice
[58:05] for sins okay
[58:08] so Paul says have a true heart of full
[58:11] assurance gathered together more but if
[58:14] you do if you sin willfully yeren you're
[58:19] getting very close to the danger zone
[58:21] look at verse 29 I'll read that of how
[58:26] much sorer punishment suppose ye shall
[58:28] he be thought worthy who hath trodden
[58:30] under foot the Son of God and hath
[58:32] counted the blood of the Covenant
[58:34] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[58:36] thing and hath done despite unto the
[58:39] spirit of grace now the main phrase for
[58:43] this topic that we have to see is
[58:46] wherewith he was sanctified proving a
[58:50] person can be sanctified because church
[58:52] the Greek meaning for sanctification is
[58:55] separate from profane things and
[58:58] dedicated to God that's what it means
[59:01] think of the house again in Matthew 12
[59:02] the house was separated from profane
[59:06] devils right there was no Devils in
[59:08] there was cleaned out that's what
[59:11] sanctification is cleaned out and set
[59:13] aside now you can put things in it right
[59:16] set aside for service set aside for
[59:19] having possessions right goods and so
[59:25] that's what's it's saying here you can
[59:27] be sanctified but then do despite the
[59:30] spirit of grace so the spirit of unn
[59:35] in favor the spirit of unmarried favors
[59:38] trying to give you more favor right give
[59:41] you more of God's blessings more of as
[59:43] his Holy Spirit is anointing but to do
[59:46] despite that to turn down those
[59:48] blessings is to be punished and open the
[59:52] door for demons to come in and bring in
[59:54] their addictions and their evil habits
[59:57] and their evil thinking and all their
[59:59] oppression and torment suicidal thoughts
[1:00:02] on this evil that's got to be driven out
[1:00:05] and they got to be kept out by the power
[1:00:07] of the Holy Spirit all right so this is
[1:00:15] again the idea of Israel coming up to K
[1:00:18] - they were so close but then they drew
[1:00:21] back right they did despite the spirit
[1:00:24] of grace and setup being born again and
[1:00:28] going into the Promised Land they drew
[1:00:32] back but verses 38 gives us a great
[1:00:37] encouragement now the just shall live by
[1:00:40] faith
[1:00:42] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[1:00:46] have no pleasure in him well we are not
[1:00:48] of them who draw back unto perdition but
[1:00:51] of them that believe to the saving of
[1:00:54] the soul okay
[1:00:56] so believing is a journey is the race we
[1:00:59] have to keep going forward we can't draw
[1:01:02] back we have to go forward running the
[1:01:05] race with patience the the path that's
[1:01:08] set before us
[1:01:10] pressing on toward the mark of the high
[1:01:11] calling praise God
[1:01:15] so see church your journey starts at
[1:01:20] faith you choose the path and then as
[1:01:23] you go along get the virtue and
[1:01:24] knowledge and temperance of patience
[1:01:26] godless and brotherly kindness just like
[1:01:28] Israel could know at any time they could
[1:01:31] know where they stood so can we know
[1:01:33] where we stand
[1:01:39] in fact if you
[1:01:40] the scripture God always told Moses
[1:01:43] where to go the pillar of fire was
[1:01:45] always leading them they knew where they
[1:01:47] are at and you can know where you're at
[1:01:49] today do we can all know where we are
[1:01:57] now let's look to the last text to prove
[1:02:01] this back to second Peter 2 so Keysha
[1:02:03] you go to 2nd Peter 2:19 now this is
[1:02:21] speaking of sermons of corruption so
[1:02:23] preachers that are going to hell and
[1:02:26] taking other people to hell with them
[1:02:28] that's what verse 17 says then verse 18
[1:02:33] talks about their their vain words okay
[1:02:37] should read 19 force please well they
[1:02:40] promise them Liberty they themselves and
[1:02:43] the servants of corruption 4 of whom a
[1:02:46] man is overcome of the same is he
[1:02:49] brought in bondage
[1:02:51] praise God so false preachers and you
[1:02:53] see it all the time on TV or the
[1:02:55] internet they make promises all the time
[1:02:58] but the people never get there by just
[1:03:01] makes me sick to my stomach to hear
[1:03:02] people the same preachers time after
[1:03:04] time promise the people all these things
[1:03:06] and they never get to it because the
[1:03:10] preachers themselves serve corruption
[1:03:13] instead of serving God I'm happy I'm
[1:03:21] happy to report by God's grace that
[1:03:24] people that I've taught in our church
[1:03:26] right you can think of different
[1:03:28] examples I promised them or I made
[1:03:31] though I share God's promise with them
[1:03:34] if you repent and get baptized and
[1:03:36] sanctified you shall receive the Holy
[1:03:38] Ghost praise God amen and I've made I
[1:03:42] made that Bible promise to people and
[1:03:45] I've served righteousness not corruption
[1:03:47] and I believe I'm trusting my God's
[1:03:50] grace people have received the promises
[1:03:52] we've been pointing to praise
[1:03:54] amen thank you Lord because we're not
[1:03:57] being overcome by sin
[1:03:59] we're being overcome by God's love amen
[1:04:01] he's conquered by heart amen he's won my
[1:04:04] heart and I'm a prisoner of my Savior
[1:04:07] praise God now look at verse 24 if they
[1:04:12] have escaped the pollutions of the world
[1:04:13] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[1:04:16] Savior Jesus Christ there again
[1:04:19] entangled therein and overcome the
[1:04:24] latter end is worse with them than the
[1:04:28] beginning is that something there it is
[1:04:30] right there proves it you're either
[1:04:32] gonna overcome Satan or he's gonna
[1:04:34] overcome you right see they're entangled
[1:04:39] again and overcome you're either gonna
[1:04:41] overcome the devil or you're or the
[1:04:43] devil is gonna overcome you who's
[1:04:45] stronger see you're gonna fight right
[1:04:48] you're gonna fight the devil who's gonna
[1:04:49] win who's gonna get the most points
[1:04:52] who's gonna get the victory you're
[1:04:55] either gonna overcome him or he's going
[1:04:57] to overcome you but thank God we got a
[1:04:59] real sharp sword praise God way sharper
[1:05:02] than his way anyway sharper right all
[1:05:07] you have to do is keep our armor on
[1:05:10] right keep our defensive weapons and
[1:05:12] then attack with the sword of the Spirit
[1:05:15] stay behind the Word of God and we can
[1:05:17] overcome and we can be the victors
[1:05:19] praise God verse 22
[1:05:25] what's happened to them according to the
[1:05:27] true proverb the dog has turned to his
[1:05:28] own vomit again and the sow that was
[1:05:31] washed to her wallowing in the mire
[1:05:36] okay so Peter compares a backslider like
[1:05:40] Judas to a pig that can be washed and
[1:05:44] made clean within returns to the mud and
[1:05:47] Jesus says the only way to be clean is
[1:05:50] through the word John 15:3
[1:05:53] now are you clean through the word which
[1:05:56] I've spoken unto you I hope that's how
[1:05:58] you come to church I hope that's how the
[1:06:00] Saints come to church they come they
[1:06:02] hear the word and they walk out feeling
[1:06:04] clean if not then you got to believe the
[1:06:06] word
[1:06:07] because we're preaching the clean the
[1:06:09] cleansing power of the word right but we
[1:06:13] should leave the church feeling clean
[1:06:15] because we received it because Jesus
[1:06:17] said the word cleans amen hallelujah so
[1:06:23] see just like a pig can temporarily get
[1:06:25] clean the word cleans if you hang around
[1:06:28] the word you're gonna get clean but it's
[1:06:32] only temporary when they forsake the
[1:06:34] clinic cleansing agent and go back to
[1:06:37] their sin addiction lifestyle okay
[1:06:44] so Lydia Matthew 27 44 now in the book
[1:06:48] I'm closing this little section here
[1:06:50] with the thief on the cross as an
[1:06:55] example of how quickly you can receive
[1:06:58] the attributes of God okay so you know
[1:07:05] in Luke 23:43 Jesus tells the thief
[1:07:13] verily I say to thee today thou shalt be
[1:07:16] with me in paradise we know that he who
[1:07:18] is saved at the end but most people
[1:07:22] don't know Matthew 27 44 so the D can
[1:07:24] you read that and the thieves also which
[1:07:27] were crucified with him he has the same
[1:07:29] in his teeth okay so both thieves were
[1:07:33] mocking and challenging Jesus at the
[1:07:36] beginning so this is a beautiful example
[1:07:39] of how a sinner can you know just a few
[1:07:46] minutes before they get saved be mocking
[1:07:48] and reviling Christ but then once
[1:07:51] getting into his presence all that the
[1:07:53] hair is right there just get the Jesus's
[1:07:55] presence start hearing his word and
[1:07:57] worshiping him loving him you'll fall in
[1:08:00] love with him praise God and you'll see
[1:08:02] that he's all holy he's all worthy he's
[1:08:05] worthy of all of our praise they met
[1:08:08] once in his presence
[1:08:13] the thief received enough faith to
[1:08:17] choose the right way to say Jesus has
[1:08:20] done nothing wrong
[1:08:21] you would he's speaking to the other
[1:08:23] thief you and I deserve this punishment
[1:08:25] but he's done nothing wrong the word is
[1:08:28] right and then he had enough virtue to
[1:08:32] stand up and rebuked the other thief
[1:08:34] saying dust thou not fear God seeing
[1:08:38] thou art in the same condemnation and we
[1:08:40] indeed justly for we receive the due
[1:08:42] reward of our deeds but this man hath
[1:08:45] done nothing amiss and he said unto
[1:08:47] Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest
[1:08:50] into thy kingdom
[1:08:52] so the lesson is Jesus will quickly and
[1:08:55] faithfully pardon all those who glory in
[1:09:00] his sinlessness and humbly plead for
[1:09:03] eternal life praise God he quickly gives
[1:09:06] them faith and in this case he quickly
[1:09:08] got virtue and even knowledge I'd say
[1:09:10] cuz he had knowledge to know that Jesus
[1:09:12] was gonna save him and then he be with
[1:09:15] Jesus
[1:09:21] all right so let's see this I'm gonna
[1:09:25] finish with this next thought here I
[1:09:27] didn't set my timer ok well I'll set it
[1:09:30] for 15 year I want to finish with this
[1:09:33] last thought I've reached on this a few
[1:09:35] times over the years but I want to put
[1:09:36] it all together in this closing thoughts
[1:09:38] here ok so let's go to mark 10 21 we had
[1:09:51] milk okay now guys go to mark 10 21 so
[1:09:55] I'm gonna close this little sermon here
[1:09:57] with each each one of us can know that
[1:10:04] our current character okay in other
[1:10:08] words we can know where we are in the
[1:10:10] statute perfect man we can know if we
[1:10:12] possess in our own spirits or our soul
[1:10:16] we can know if we have the spiritual
[1:10:20] goods that Jesus talked about in Matthew
[1:10:22] 12 we can um
[1:10:32] okay yeah so okay okay
[1:10:36] actually skiers Mark 10:17 please and
[1:10:40] when he was gone fourth another way
[1:10:42] there came one running healed him and
[1:10:43] asked him good master what should I do
[1:10:46] that I may inherit eternal life okay so
[1:10:48] here the rich young ruler let's see him
[1:10:51] this is what I love about this story he
[1:10:57] comes running he don't come walking into
[1:10:59] church he comes running in the church we
[1:11:02] rarely seen that right he comes running
[1:11:09] and then not only does he run he falls
[1:11:12] down and kneels so he comes running now
[1:11:16] I've had my children run up to me and
[1:11:18] asked me questions the last few days
[1:11:19] daddy when can we do this I like that
[1:11:21] that's that's running to Daddy to ask
[1:11:24] him things but he's running to Jesus
[1:11:27] falling on his knees and he says what
[1:11:32] lack I yet so he goes he goes and tells
[1:11:37] Jesus he's kept all these six
[1:11:40] commandments that are listed here in
[1:11:41] mark 10 Malka I can read verse 21 then
[1:11:46] Jesus beholding him loved him and said
[1:11:48] to him one thing thou lackest
[1:11:50] go thy way so it so ever thou hast and
[1:11:53] give to the poor then shout the treasure
[1:11:55] in heaven and come take up their cross
[1:11:57] and follow me
[1:11:58] okay so the Bible said Jesus loved this
[1:12:01] man he loved him he had to get
[1:12:05] compassion form doesn't not have
[1:12:07] compassion upon all the world for God so
[1:12:09] loved the world if God loved this man he
[1:12:12] had to love Judas as well love him in
[1:12:16] the sense of a creator he created the
[1:12:19] these beings so he loved them he had a
[1:12:21] desire for them to know him and want
[1:12:25] them to be saved now notice he kept all
[1:12:29] six of the commandments did you notice
[1:12:31] which ones he talked about it was
[1:12:34] Commandments five through nine he kept
[1:12:38] five through nine the ones that Jesus
[1:12:40] listened was five to nine
[1:12:42] those are the ones that deal with other
[1:12:44] people rike is the first four deal with
[1:12:46] God you know don't take his name in vain
[1:12:48] all these things
[1:12:49] I know other gods before me so Jesus
[1:12:53] lists how are you treating others see
[1:12:56] what Jesus was trying to do he's trying
[1:12:57] to get down do you really love other
[1:12:58] people and so he challenged them
[1:13:01] he didn't challenge everybody with the
[1:13:03] challenge but what was his challenged go
[1:13:04] sell all your goods give it to the poor
[1:13:08] in other words do you really love other
[1:13:10] people that was his test
[1:13:12] remember not everybody had to do that
[1:13:14] right like Abraham he was rich Solomon
[1:13:18] was rich David was a lot of money but
[1:13:21] jesus knew this man needed to prove to
[1:13:25] Jesus that he loved Jesus and the word
[1:13:28] morning love money and when he came down
[1:13:31] to it he really didn't because after
[1:13:34] after Jesus told him that what'd he do
[1:13:37] he walked away with his head down
[1:13:39] sorrowful so see even in keeping those
[1:13:45] Commandments five through nine he said
[1:13:50] what lack I yet to see children and
[1:13:53] Saints God puts something in your heart
[1:13:56] called a conscience right it's an
[1:13:58] awareness it's a moral awareness and you
[1:14:02] know what's in your heart whether you
[1:14:05] have the blessings of God or you lack
[1:14:08] some God puts it in your heart so you
[1:14:11] know and then notice Jesus the Jesus
[1:14:15] play around with him at all know Jesus
[1:14:18] told him exactly keep these things but
[1:14:21] there's one more thing you need see God
[1:14:24] will always show us in our servants we
[1:14:26] listen to as we meditate as we read our
[1:14:28] Bibles in the mornings God will always
[1:14:30] show us what we have need of Jesus
[1:14:34] points and here's what you need to do
[1:14:36] you need to sell all that all that all
[1:14:38] your possessions give that to the poor
[1:14:40] follow me that would be that sound like
[1:14:45] an adventure wouldn't it mom I get to
[1:14:47] leave I'll leave all that behind all
[1:14:49] that business and money and counting all
[1:14:50] the money and building big things I can
[1:14:53] leave that behind I can go on follow
[1:14:54] Jesus and
[1:14:55] we see the maracle's and see Souls saved
[1:14:58] I'd be an adventurer to some of us but
[1:15:01] to him
[1:15:01] money was way more important than the
[1:15:05] ministry the preaching the praying for
[1:15:08] the sick that was way more important
[1:15:15] so church serves a church and family we
[1:15:20] can know how far we've come with God and
[1:15:22] if we still lack his character qualities
[1:15:26] Jesus agreed with the rich coming world
[1:15:28] he said one thing thou lackest right he
[1:15:32] said what do I lack he said you lack one
[1:15:33] thing he left Jesus grieved and
[1:15:39] sorrowful sad he left church because he
[1:15:42] had great possessions and the preachers
[1:15:44] were saying don't love money love the
[1:15:47] gospel
[1:15:53] okay so friends our story doesn't have
[1:15:57] to end like that
[1:15:58] right by God's grace you can add the
[1:16:02] qualities rather than lack the qualities
[1:16:05] we don't have to lack we can have them
[1:16:09] added to us so see this story tells you
[1:16:16] God's Spirit will always give you an
[1:16:18] honest spiritual assessment of where you
[1:16:21] are with God always they'll tell you
[1:16:24] what you got he'll show you what you
[1:16:26] lack so think about have you just been
[1:16:30] recently baptized that's good you got
[1:16:33] faith but do you have virtue to live it
[1:16:36] publicly where no matter where you go
[1:16:38] whether it's horse lessons or dance
[1:16:40] people know they really love God or
[1:16:43] Taekwondo so think of the public places
[1:16:47] where you would go do those people know
[1:16:49] that you there's something different
[1:16:51] about you you you're honest you keep
[1:16:55] your word you don't steal you don't say
[1:16:58] evil things if you can live it in front
[1:17:01] of other people publicly you got virtue
[1:17:08] okay so more maybe you're the spot where
[1:17:10] you're you're very impatient in your
[1:17:13] home right or or you see that you you
[1:17:20] don't treat others you're not a loving
[1:17:23] sinners you get really upset with
[1:17:25] sinners and you speak bad about them
[1:17:27] that shows you need godliness because
[1:17:29] God is good to the just and the unjust
[1:17:31] or maybe it's that last umbrella
[1:17:34] kindness when your brothers in the
[1:17:36] church or sisters in the church say
[1:17:40] something wrong you get mad at that you
[1:17:42] get mad at them and don't want to come
[1:17:44] to church don't want to forgive or maybe
[1:17:50] you won't even sit down and talk about a
[1:17:51] problem with somebody at the church
[1:17:52] because you're so upset with them you'd
[1:17:54] rather leave and go somewhere else
[1:17:56] or just ignore them and not talk to them
[1:17:59] and not shake their hand not talking
[1:18:00] about it remember the last step before
[1:18:03] the baptism Holy Ghost is brotherly
[1:18:06] kindness being able to deal with
[1:18:09] problems amongst your brothers and
[1:18:11] sisters and be kind with it right we
[1:18:15] have a lot of people we've seen come and
[1:18:17] go that when they disagree they're not
[1:18:18] very kind right that's a good read
[1:18:22] that's a good that's a good sign that
[1:18:25] people aren't in brotherly kindness yet
[1:18:27] right or maybe your cross over Jordan
[1:18:34] but now it's time to find your position
[1:18:36] but where's your ministry where are you
[1:18:40] where are you supposed to be and then
[1:18:43] you're so in you're so attached to the
[1:18:46] Word of God that you're bringing forth
[1:18:48] fruits of the spirit people can see the
[1:18:50] fruits the rare the the rare expressions
[1:18:55] of God's love the genuine ripe
[1:18:57] expressions of God's love oh thank you
[1:19:02] Jesus
[1:19:04] remember Saints Jesus's bodies in heaven
[1:19:08] but his spirit is near to every heart
[1:19:11] trying to show you your character and
[1:19:14] offer you a greater experience with God
[1:19:17] acts 17 says the
[1:19:21] or has determined your bounds of your
[1:19:23] habitation that you should seek the Lord
[1:19:26] if happy they might feel after him and
[1:19:29] find him but we be not far from every
[1:19:32] one of us and that great to know that
[1:19:33] God is very close to this house God's
[1:19:36] not far from Doylestown God's right here
[1:19:39] in Doylestown right God is in Akron he's
[1:19:42] not far from us he's very close to us
[1:19:45] but we after feeling him we have to go
[1:19:48] we have to go seek after him right
[1:19:50] search for him as silver and find him
[1:19:54] for him for in him we live and move and
[1:19:58] have our being when you're in your
[1:20:00] calling you that's when you feel like
[1:20:02] you're alive like when I'm preaching and
[1:20:04] is writing and making videos I feel like
[1:20:06] I'm alive because I'm doing what God
[1:20:10] called me to do is it heart yes it's
[1:20:13] labor but in him we live and move and
[1:20:17] have our being so see he's very close to
[1:20:22] us we can live for him but we have to
[1:20:24] listen to him respond to him and and
[1:20:28] respond right as a scripture says and
[1:20:31] find him find his will for our lives
[1:20:36] here are some beautiful scriptures I'm
[1:20:38] just gonna read them to you see
[1:20:41] scripture declares that God weighs your
[1:20:43] character so in other words God ways and
[1:20:48] knows which attributes of the statue for
[1:20:50] man we have proper 16 - all the ways of
[1:20:54] a man are clean and his own eyes but the
[1:20:56] Lord waiteth the spirits so see the Lord
[1:21:00] weighs the spirits he knows he judges
[1:21:03] the spirits he knows which ones we have
[1:21:04] which ones we don't and God's Word is
[1:21:09] the measuring stick or the balance that
[1:21:12] weighs your character because Paul says
[1:21:15] in Philippians 3:16 Christians should
[1:21:17] walk by the same rule which means of a
[1:21:20] measuring rod a carpenter's line see we
[1:21:25] should take that statue of every man and
[1:21:26] use that to measure ourselves how where
[1:21:28] do we stand on that are we growing in
[1:21:30] that right that should be our eye should
[1:21:33] be our ruler
[1:21:35] are we as tall as are we as tall as
[1:21:37] faith virtue and the knowledge of
[1:21:39] patience of temperance godless brotherly
[1:21:41] kindness or charity where we at on
[1:21:43] growing on that measuring stick see God
[1:21:51] gives us his word so we can measure our
[1:21:54] lives by its truce and by its character
[1:21:58] and some day we'll all be judged by the
[1:22:01] word because Paul said we shall all
[1:22:02] judge I'm sorry God shall judge the
[1:22:04] secrets of men by Jesus Christ according
[1:22:07] to my gospel you might as well go stand
[1:22:09] by the ruler now right let me go to the
[1:22:11] doctor you always stand there getting
[1:22:12] weighed and measured we should do that
[1:22:15] now it's going to happen eventually we
[1:22:17] should do it with a statue for men no
[1:22:20] way measure yourself right weigh
[1:22:23] yourself or measure yourself according
[1:22:25] to the ruler of God's Word now the last
[1:22:30] few examples I gathered just a few
[1:22:31] minutes here yeah the last two examples
[1:22:39] our Belshazzar from the time of Daniel
[1:22:43] and Joe how much time I got
[1:22:44] okay good I got two minutes that's
[1:22:46] perfect Belshazzar you know he was king
[1:22:50] of Babylon at the time of its fall he
[1:22:53] was the last king but he'd profane
[1:22:58] Israel's holy temple vessels by feasting
[1:23:01] with them and praising idols all that
[1:23:04] mustn't make God so meant supernatural
[1:23:08] fingers interrupted the feast and wrote
[1:23:10] the Kings doom on the wall which Daniel
[1:23:13] interpreted as thou Belshazzar are
[1:23:15] weighed in the balances and are found
[1:23:18] wanting
[1:23:19] see he was guilty of refusing to learn
[1:23:23] humility through Nebuchadnezzar's life
[1:23:27] so he was lacking the humility that he
[1:23:31] should have learned in other words God
[1:23:33] was trying to add right there God was
[1:23:35] trying to add humility to him praise God
[1:23:37] but he turned he refused it and so God
[1:23:41] said your character is lacking just like
[1:23:43] the rich young ruler what do I lack
[1:23:47] see
[1:23:48] God's Spirit means you you're possessing
[1:23:52] an eternal weight praise God having
[1:23:54] God's anointing you have a spiritual
[1:23:56] weight praise God
[1:24:00] seeing God's eyes Belshazzar's character
[1:24:04] was wanting or deficient it was lacking
[1:24:07] humility though there was lacking faith
[1:24:11] so we know what happened he was killed
[1:24:14] that night and then the kingdom went
[1:24:17] over from gold to silver right from
[1:24:19] Babylon to meet the Persians because he
[1:24:22] lacked character that's how his people
[1:24:24] today is they they don't their house ISM
[1:24:27] if their house doesn't fill with good
[1:24:29] things it gets taken over right and that
[1:24:32] Kingdom got taken over just like houses
[1:24:34] and Jesus parable can get taken over
[1:24:37] just give me one more minute here finish
[1:24:40] up with Joe job we you know is known for
[1:24:43] having his patience tested to the limit
[1:24:46] we oh my I don't think we've been there
[1:24:47] have we we haven't had our patients
[1:24:49] tested that much yet he passed the test
[1:24:54] he lost his livestock servants and
[1:24:57] children my Satan's desires one of those
[1:25:00] traps we were talking about earlier yet
[1:25:02] Satan kept his integrity by worshipping
[1:25:05] God and not charging God foolishly
[1:25:09] he went through months of tests and
[1:25:13] finally pleaded with God he said let me
[1:25:15] be weighed in the even balance that God
[1:25:18] may know mine integrity see job new job
[1:25:22] new I haven't sinned he said I I know
[1:25:25] I've got these character qualities
[1:25:28] inside of me praise God no I've got
[1:25:30] God's anointing still on me I've got
[1:25:31] mine integrity praise God amen he said
[1:25:36] God that God may know my integrity let
[1:25:39] me be weighed in God's balance amen
[1:25:42] in other words let the world see them
[1:25:45] I'm on the statue of perfect man let the
[1:25:48] world see that I've got faith and mert's
[1:25:49] you praise God right like your friends
[1:25:53] let's go I let my friends see that I've
[1:25:55] got virtue
[1:25:56] I've got knowledge and I've got brother
[1:25:58] kindness for my Christian man let him
[1:26:00] see it in me I know I've got it
[1:26:03] that's a jobber say I know I've got it
[1:26:06] I'm passing the test I'm not failing I'm
[1:26:08] not getting overcome I'm overcoming
[1:26:12] that's what Joe was saying it's
[1:26:16] beautiful in this beautiful my goodness
[1:26:17] this is rich oh thank you hard see God
[1:26:23] would eventually wake jobs life and deem
[1:26:26] it or judge it acceptable telling his
[1:26:30] three friends that Joe had spoken right
[1:26:32] and day had spoken wrong so job said
[1:26:35] Judge mean way me Lord I know I'm right
[1:26:39] and God did and God said Joe was right
[1:26:43] see children you can know where you
[1:26:45] stand with God you can know you've got
[1:26:47] the weight of God's character in your
[1:26:49] life you have to wonder you can know it
[1:26:52] and the way you know glory is by getting
[1:26:56] victory in the midst of trials wearing
[1:27:00] your hardest trials and you stand the
[1:27:02] test and you turn down Satan's
[1:27:04] temptation that's when you know you got
[1:27:06] it Alleluia so last thing I want to say
[1:27:11] is this scripture that we started with
[1:27:12] Paul says trials and tests of faith
[1:27:16] produce an eternal weight of glory we
[1:27:19] know what the way it is right the way is
[1:27:23] since it's eternal it must be a heavenly
[1:27:26] reward because we've got a body that's
[1:27:29] eternal waiting in heaven right
[1:27:33] so what eternal weight is there must be
[1:27:37] the heavenly awards that await
[1:27:40] Christians such as the crown of life
[1:27:43] pulsed to have a crown of life
[1:27:46] that's weighty right it has weight in
[1:27:48] heaven and the memorials of God kept as
[1:27:54] witnesses of his children's acts of
[1:27:58] faith because remember the angel met
[1:28:00] corniest and what he's saying there's
[1:28:03] memorials of your prayers and alms
[1:28:06] before God in heaven so see there's an
[1:28:10] eternal substance in heaven for the true
[1:28:13] believer who's a overcomer
[1:28:16] amen hmm and Paul says I'm sorry Peter
[1:28:22] says our tests of faith are more
[1:28:24] precious than gold that perishes thanks
[1:28:29] Jesus will help you know your current
[1:28:30] character what's lacking and as we've
[1:28:35] said a few weeks ago what needs prune in
[1:28:36] your character if you're born again and
[1:28:41] if you're lacking you can accept his
[1:28:44] portion of anointing of character that
[1:28:48] will help you store up an eternal weight
[1:28:52] of glory in heaven praise God we'll stop
[1:28:55] right there
[1:28:56] Lord willing on the following Wednesday
[1:28:59] because I'll be gone Sunday we'll look
[1:29:02] at the third weight knowledge by God's
[1:29:06] grace so let's uh let's worship the Lord
[1:29:10] here praise God what a blessing tonight
[1:29:38] what a blessing this is how God restores
[1:29:45] his character to man he goes from glory
[1:29:50] to glory okay I like this foot by foot

[1:30:14] possession but also growing step by step

[1:30:26] inventory your house tonight if Jesus
[1:30:30] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:30:32] forever and if you come to him like the
[1:30:35] rich young ruler I come and you're
[1:30:40] honest and say I lack this or I struggle
[1:30:44] with that they'll tell you exactly what
[1:30:46] you need to do I already believe that
[1:30:49] may not be tonight maybe tomorrow as you
[1:30:52] study maybe when you go through the next
[1:30:56] test or trial but since we know he's the
[1:31:00] same we know if we come and approach in
[1:31:03] the same way as rich young ruler or Joe
[1:31:06] I have a thorn I'm in the midst of fire

[1:31:12] showing my character let it be proved
[1:31:14] right
