[0:00] Tony I like to look at the life of
[0:01] Solomon but before I get to Solomon I
[0:03] like to uh just look at leadership for a
[0:06] few messages here by God's grace so
[0:07] we're going to preach on leadership this
[0:09] morning Matthew chapter 20 verse 16.
[0:20] Hallelujah
[0:24] of course A Familiar verse here and
[0:30] as I talked with different you know
[0:31] Saints and brothers and things like that
[0:32] we just come on the topic of leadership
[0:35] you know over the last few months and
[0:38] I've just been meditating on it and
[0:39] reading a little book on it I got a book
[0:41] about
[0:42] the Temple of Solomon I bought by Kevin
[0:44] J Connor he's a Pentecostal preacher and
[0:47] he's just been a wonderful resource for
[0:49] me to find a lot of great scriptures and
[0:51] history so and then tying that with what
[0:54] brother Brandon said in the Bible you
[0:56] know it's been a real good study and I'm
[0:58] just gonna try to build to that by God's
[1:00] grace in the next few weeks here but
[1:02] Lord willing
[1:03] so Matthew 20 verse 26.

[1:34] message but of course if you know the
[1:35] real heart of leadership you know the
[1:37] real leaders are the servants
[1:40] and there could be no greater leader
[1:41] than our Lord Jesus Christ let's have

[3:08] name and Saint said
[3:09] amen God bless you as you're being
[3:11] seated praise God
[3:14] so we'll look at leadership this morning
[3:16] you know this evening we'll probably do
[3:17] the kids Bible study we'll look at what
[3:19] is the message I think we started that a
[3:20] couple weeks ago
[3:22] right now I got about uh
[3:24] 27 verses brother Branham used to say
[3:26] what is the message
[3:28] so the message is the scriptures that
[3:31] God is fulfilling right now
[3:33] and Satan attacks that so much he says
[3:35] the messages the tapes as the messages
[3:37] of Jeffersonville or something or the
[3:39] message or you're the message or
[3:40] something like that's why I've been
[3:42] hearing preachers say lately you're the
[3:43] message
[3:44] I'm not the message the message has come
[3:46] into me but Jesus Christ is the message
[3:48] praise God his word is the message
[3:50] Hallelujah
[3:51] and so little children will do the bible
[3:53] study tonight and we'll try to get
[3:55] through maybe five or six of those
[3:56] however many we can get through just to
[3:58] show you right through the scriptures
[3:59] what the message is it's the word of God
[4:00] God is fulfilling today
[4:03] okay so how about a few verses here uh
[4:06] again I'd like to
[4:07] look at this and let's start with the
[4:09] context here of this
[4:13] the scripture here as we look at
[4:15] leadership and of course it's a vast
[4:17] subject it's a I mean you can apply this
[4:19] the word leadership you can apply it to
[4:21] every story in the Bible
[4:23] right
[4:24] how about the leadership of the Garden
[4:25] of Eden can you see the leadership there
[4:26] it was it was God gave it to Adam right
[4:28] but Adam failed right uh
[4:31] and so you can see leadership you can
[4:33] place leadership in every
[4:35] single story of the Bible Hallelujah and
[4:39] then we see leadership all the way at
[4:40] the end there's no Temple because the
[4:43] lamb and the Lord God are the temple
[4:45] thereof praise God there's no need for
[4:46] light because the lamb is a light
[4:48] thereof so who we led by then we're led
[4:50] by Jesus Christ praise God Hallelujah
[4:52] who is God manifest In the Flesh so of
[4:54] course you apply this to every single
[4:56] topic but as I was showing you I like to
[4:58] look at Solomon and eventually get to
[5:00] that I'm going to try to close a little
[5:01] bit you know today with some of his
[5:03] some of his story and the importance of
[5:07] leadership by God's grace
[5:11] so uh Matthew 20 verse 24 I actually
[5:14] preached a little bit of this on
[5:16] Wednesday
[5:17] when we looked at Isolation part three I
[5:19] believe it wasn't
[5:21] but here uh
[5:23] James and John's mother
[5:27] comes to Jesus and says let my two sons
[5:30] sit at your right and left hand
[5:32] right
[5:34] and Jesus said well can you be
[5:37] can you drink the cup that I drink of
[5:40] can you be baptized with the baptism I'm
[5:43] baptized with and they said yes Lord and
[5:46] surely they would surely as Martyrs
[5:48] they'd give their lives each one of
[5:49] those disciples outside of John gave
[5:51] their lives for Jesus Christ
[5:54] um
[5:55] but after Jesus kind of says you know
[5:57] dear Mother
[5:59] Woman and
[6:01] he said this is only given to the Father
[6:02] the father is the only one who gives
[6:04] these seats
[6:06] right and that kind of goes back to our
[6:08] sermon and I think I even preached at
[6:09] Albion you know the pride of message
[6:10] people to say oh we're the greatest of
[6:12] all time
[6:13] the pride and message people to say we
[6:14] are the ones who sit on the right and
[6:16] left hand
[6:18] that's Pride that's a sin
[6:21] um
[6:22] because they're saying they know
[6:23] something that Jesus didn't know or
[6:24] Jesus didn't share on Earth and that's
[6:26] just so awful and of course the tape
[6:28] players say it and the preachers say it
[6:29] too you know it's a shame for anybody to
[6:31] say that
[6:32] because it's pride in the heart and
[6:35] pride is an Abomination unto the Lord
[6:39] priorities abomination of the Lord so
[6:41] that's why we pray for those people that
[6:42] are in such a sad condition because we
[6:44] don't want to be prideful we want to be
[6:45] humble
[6:46] praise God God works in humility
[6:48] Hallelujah
[6:49] thank God for that Hallelujah and we
[6:51] thank God for every testimony verse 25
[6:53] but Jesus called them unto him so now he
[6:56] calls him over
[6:57] actually I didn't read 24. when the 10
[6:58] heard it they were moved with Indian
[7:00] Nation against the two brothers so I
[7:01] like what Jesus does whenever there's
[7:03] anger what does he do he calls people
[7:04] together let's talk about this
[7:06] right he doesn't send you away and okay
[7:08] you just be angry and he tries to bring
[7:10] Unity right he tries to bring Unity when
[7:12] there's anger
[7:14] and feelings are hurt and everybody's
[7:16] mad he just he doesn't say go ahead and
[7:18] walk away Jesus doesn't walk away from
[7:19] him he says come unto me
[7:22] right that's what I've always
[7:23] appreciated about my wife you know when
[7:25] I I think I preached like eight marriage
[7:26] Banquets now and at the last few I've
[7:28] just been uh
[7:30] I've been bringing it down to this you
[7:32] know the best part of our family I feel
[7:34] like of course is the leadership of the
[7:36] word of God that God's given unto us in
[7:37] this hour but how it applies to the home
[7:40] is my wife uh will when the children
[7:42] make a mistake she'll correct them right
[7:44] away
[7:45] like she doesn't wait weeks and months
[7:47] and let it and then she talks to them
[7:49] about it so Lydia's smiling so that's
[7:51] probably like an amen from a minute
[7:55] and that's kind of opposite of me like I
[7:57] was raised to just laugh at mistakes and
[7:59] our family was in Pentecostal you know
[8:01] we we kind of laughed at mistakes we
[8:03] didn't you know my mom couldn't bring
[8:04] much correction because she you know her
[8:06] she and my dad were divorced you know so
[8:08] it was really hard for her to do all the
[8:09] jobs
[8:10] um and maybe she didn't know better I
[8:12] don't know uh but that's one thing I
[8:15] love about it you know my wife will call
[8:16] the children together
[8:18] I'm not there all the time right nine
[8:20] months out of the year I'm not there I'm
[8:21] at work but I just love that and that
[8:24] I've tried I've tried to stress that to
[8:25] the married couples that I've been able
[8:27] to minister to
[8:29] that's love Jesus's love is saying hey
[8:31] you're all Angry he's like he's like
[8:33] just come come to me let's talk about
[8:35] this
[8:36] let me calm your anger
[8:38] right let me and the Bible says a soft
[8:41] answer turns away your Wrath
[8:43] now there's times of yell Jesus yelled
[8:45] in the temple right with the Zeal he
[8:47] took the ropes out whipped them out
[8:49] there's a time to yell but there's a
[8:51] time to be gentle
[8:53] so what do you have to do be led of the
[8:54] Holy Spirit
[8:56] the best part about family and
[8:58] Christianity is that you can repent if
[9:00] you make a mistake
[9:01] and God's not going to throw you out of
[9:02] the Kingdom oh I'm done with Jesse he
[9:04] got mad I'm just I'm done with him no
[9:06] I'm saved by grace praise God hallelujah
[9:09] I'm saved to the uttermost the Bible
[9:11] says praise God
[9:13] uh
[9:14] so
[9:16] just what a what an example of Christ so
[9:19] he says you're all Angry don't go fight
[9:20] amongst yourself don't go out to your
[9:22] tents or go don't go out two by two and
[9:24] argue about it he said come to me and
[9:25] I'll make everything right
[9:27] I'll calm you down
[9:29] right because Peter's saying I'm greater
[9:31] and John's like no I'm going to be
[9:32] greater James oh I'm going to be greater
[9:34] they were all great men in One Way by in
[9:37] God's eyes they're all great men
[9:39] right but we don't exalt one another and
[9:41] say oh Peter's the greatest or that one
[9:42] and I'm the greatest or this church is
[9:44] the greatest
[9:46] but God will decide who labored the most
[9:49] God will decide who gets the greatest
[9:51] reward praise God it's up to God
[9:54] and Jesus said you know the prince of
[9:56] the Gentiles exercise dominion over them
[9:58] and that they are great and they that
[10:01] are great exercise authority over them
[10:04] so Jesus has to go outside of their
[10:06] culture and say you know remember the
[10:07] Gentiles you're Jews remember the
[10:09] Gentiles they're the ones who Lord over
[10:12] others don't get that Spirit on you
[10:15] so now we know what spirit is on the
[10:17] people that call themselves the greatest
[10:18] of all time right
[10:19] there's a there's an evil spirit on them
[10:21] because the Gentiles didn't have God
[10:23] they didn't have promises they didn't
[10:24] have covenants but the Jews had the
[10:27] covenants the Jews had the word of God
[10:28] hallelujah
[10:30] and so those without the covenants those
[10:31] without the Holy Spirit those without
[10:33] the word of God exercise lordship and
[10:36] they have they have Wicked leadership
[10:37] they have sinful leadership and Jesus
[10:40] says Don't Take Your examples from the
[10:41] Gentiles take your example from me
[10:43] praise God
[10:44] Hallelujah
[10:46] and Jesus I love what Jesus says but it
[10:48] shall not be so among you aren't you
[10:49] glad Jesus stepped in your life and said
[10:51] it will not be so it will not be a
[10:52] sinful life in your life amen
[10:55] you will not be under the wrong
[10:56] leadership you'll be under the right
[10:58] leadership hallelujah amen that just
[11:00] struck me right there real good amen
[11:01] hallelujah
[11:03] it will not be sub why because he
[11:04] dropped the charges
[11:06] because he had Grace on me amen my life
[11:09] will not be a wasted life my life will
[11:11] speak of a testimony of Christ Jesus
[11:13] hallelujah amen it will not be so among
[11:16] the real believers
[11:18] but whosoever will be great among you
[11:19] let him be your minister
[11:22] let them be your servant and we've been
[11:23] looking at that over the last few months
[11:24] how to serve others and we want to
[11:26] encourage one another to serve one
[11:28] another
[11:30] that's why I told Zur and each one of
[11:32] the uh each one in the Yang family I
[11:34] said if you need to talk to anybody
[11:35] about the passing of your father just
[11:37] let me know I'll be a listening ear I
[11:39] won't say anything I'll just smile I'll
[11:41] probably cry a little bit too
[11:43] but if you want to share any memories
[11:45] with me about your father and you know
[11:47] the good times or maybe the challenging
[11:48] times I'm here to listen praise God we
[11:50] want to we want to give of ourselves
[11:53] we want to be servants to other people
[11:55] right we just don't want we don't want
[11:57] to be served we want to be the servants
[11:59] and each one of us can have that Spirit
[12:01] of service right the Holy Spirit of
[12:03] service
[12:04] at verse 27 and whosoever will be Chief
[12:06] among you let him be your servant
[12:10] even as a son of man came not to be
[12:13] ministered unto
[12:14] but to minister
[12:16] and to give his life a ransom for many
[12:19] now this thought just came to me right
[12:20] now remember the Bible said uh there
[12:23] were some women that ministered under
[12:24] the needs of Jesus I think Joanna was
[12:26] one of them
[12:27] somebody help could somebody help me
[12:29] with one of those other names
[12:31] who was it
[12:32] Solomon again one of those
[12:34] but here Jesus says I've come to serve
[12:37] you and he no doubt he was he was the
[12:39] greatest servant but even Jesus had
[12:40] servants who served him
[12:42] these humble little sisters right and
[12:44] then who did Jesus honor after the
[12:46] resurrection amen Mary Magdalene amen
[12:48] The Humble one The Humble servant yeah
[12:50] Mary Magdalene was one of them that's
[12:51] right yep she was delivered out of seven
[12:53] demons and then she along with Joanna I
[12:56] just remember that name Joanna is always
[12:57] a beautiful name there a servant to
[13:00] Christ Jesus
[13:02] and she would and so Jesus honors them
[13:06] by first showing them the resurrection
[13:07] you get to be the first witnesses that
[13:09] I'm alive think about that it wasn't
[13:11] Peter the man with the kingdom it was
[13:12] these humble servants amen oh come on
[13:16] God help us to be servants today
[13:18] hallelujah thank God help us to serve
[13:20] one another humble ourselves like
[13:22] brother said humble yourselves and then
[13:23] you'll really be great in God's eyes
[13:25] got to Humble ourselves
[13:28] not exalt ourselves we have to Humble
[13:30] ourselves
[13:32] and so he gave his life as a payment for
[13:34] many he paid the charges Hallelujah he
[13:38] paid the debt that we all owed praise
[13:40] God he gave his life as a ransom so that
[13:43] should encourage us let me give my life
[13:45] for others as well
[13:47] yours might look different from you know
[13:49] other people
[13:51] you know you give you give your life in
[13:53] other words you give them uh you you
[13:55] give of your own desires your own hopes
[13:57] and dreams which are all selfish dreams
[13:59] right
[13:59] right we have to we have to give up our
[14:02] selfish dreams in order to meet the
[14:04] needs of others and when we do that we
[14:06] really have the mind of Christ we really
[14:09] have achieved the dream that God wants
[14:11] for us right or the the destiny God
[14:13] wants for us when we choose to give up
[14:16] our ideas our plans and we accept the
[14:18] plans of the Lord
[14:21] you know I've talked to how many how
[14:23] many older people have I talked to these
[14:24] last few years that their parents have
[14:25] died you know they're in their 50s or
[14:27] 60s their parents have died or their
[14:28] parents have gotten sick and their whole
[14:30] life trajectory I can't hardly say that
[14:33] word trajectory
[14:34] I gotta go back to Elementary good thing
[14:37] I'm going tomorrow
[14:39] trajectory that's not probably third
[14:40] grade word anyway but uh you know there
[14:43] I've talked to these adults and their
[14:44] life was going this certain direction
[14:46] and then all of a sudden a parent gets
[14:47] sick and now their whole life changes
[14:51] and I've told those I've told each one
[14:53] you know it's been difficult maybe they
[14:54] can't work as much or maybe uh they
[14:57] don't have as much Freedom anymore but
[14:58] I've told each one in each case God will
[15:00] honor you for taking care of your
[15:02] parents because your parents took care
[15:04] of you
[15:04] right that's a simple lesson right Jesus
[15:06] talks about that in the scriptures right
[15:08] the Pharisees try to take that money to
[15:10] take care of the parents right they try
[15:11] to take that away and Jesus said that's
[15:13] a commandment of man
[15:15] that you need to take care of your
[15:16] parents
[15:17] right
[15:19] but just think Church how you know our
[15:21] lives can we can have a certain idea but
[15:23] we've got to be humble enough to accept
[15:24] the leadership of the Holy Spirit praise
[15:26] God if God would change the trajectory
[15:28] of our lives in order to serve other
[15:31] people we have to accept that and say
[15:33] praise the Lord God's ways are the right
[15:35] ways
[15:37] because we all know people that choose
[15:39] not to
[15:40] right to their shame right and I know
[15:43] there's cases at them in their lives
[15:44] where they've got to go to hospice or
[15:45] they got to go to the nursing home I
[15:47] understand that but we understand that
[15:48] I'm just saying when God leads you to do
[15:51] something when it's in you the Bible
[15:52] says when it's in your ability to do
[15:54] something to be good to others we should
[15:56] do it praise God
[15:57] Hallelujah and so here we see a real
[16:00] leader Christ Jesus
[16:03] he says you lead by serving other people
[16:06] now of course I looked up web servers
[16:08] this is these are just kind of General I
[16:10] don't really like this leader these
[16:11] definitions so much because just as a
[16:12] position or the ability and capacity to
[16:15] lead but if you look up leading I like
[16:17] that with the arrow you know providing
[16:19] direction or guidance I like that
[16:21] definition there praise God
[16:24] because leadership is giving you
[16:25] guidance it's giving you a direction to
[16:28] go
[16:29] you need to walk in this way
[16:32] right I need to walk with this and I
[16:35] need a word of guidance so Lord Lead Me
[16:37] Guide Me with some type of word
[16:39] some type of Direction
[16:42] I need to know which way to go I need to
[16:45] know what to choose
[16:47] so God thankfully God gives us guidance
[16:50] and Direction praise God we're like
[16:52] sheep he's like the great Shepherd
[16:54] Hallelujah Hallelujah and he leaves the
[16:56] 99 to go get the one amen hallelujah
[16:58] thank you Jesus so he's here Church he's
[17:01] here today to provide guidance and
[17:02] Leadership to each one of us
[17:04] Glory
[17:05] and you know of course this thought came
[17:07] to my mind too everyone leads in some
[17:09] way
[17:10] right like last night James was James
[17:12] and I were playing with the Dinosaurs on
[17:14] the floor he was leading the play
[17:16] I was following his lead
[17:18] his lead was his T-Rex would uh kill my
[17:21] T-rex
[17:22] and I just had to act like I was dying
[17:24] you know that
[17:25] he was leading there you know
[17:28] uh and so you know just one simple
[17:30] example but everybody's a leader you
[17:32] know I pastors lead the congregation I
[17:33] lead the congregation Paris lead
[17:35] children husbands lead wives
[17:37] I could have put wives lead children in
[17:39] there and they when they guide the home
[17:40] right the Bible says I'm sorry sisters I
[17:43] forgot that one forgive me I don't want
[17:45] to forget the sisters I got a church
[17:46] full of sisters
[17:47] we're way outnumbered Brothers
[17:50] uh so forgive me I didn't mean to forget
[17:51] that today
[17:53] uh but it's just a vast beautiful
[17:55] subject you know you can break it down
[17:57] each one of these could be a long series
[18:00] I mean how many series is a man gonna
[18:02] need to be a real leader
[18:05] right I need leadership all the time I
[18:07] need to learn all the time how to follow
[18:08] the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[18:10] right
[18:11] how many sermons do children need to
[18:13] become leaders of their parents to
[18:14] listen the first time children
[18:17] how many how many sermons do we need for
[18:19] that how much prayer time do we need for
[18:20] that praise God
[18:22] obey the first time don't wait to the
[18:24] second time obey the first time
[18:26] I was lecturing my class about that this
[18:27] week you know
[18:29] I'm saying first time obedience you must
[18:31] I want you to obey the first time
[18:34] they're just trying to get caught up
[18:36] from the you know the Christmas break
[18:37] and all the sugar they ate probably and
[18:39] come down from that sugar high
[18:42] but just reminding them like it's so
[18:44] important you know
[18:45] um everyone leads you know and the
[18:47] children will lead their friends right
[18:49] when you have play dates somebody takes
[18:52] the lead
[18:53] we're gonna play this game okay well
[18:54] either you follow or you don't I mean
[18:56] you go play by yourself or whatever
[18:58] you have that choice
[19:00] so everybody is a leader
[19:02] and uh
[19:05] the greatest leaders are the servants as
[19:07] we said with Jesus that's our text there
[19:08] so yeah I just want to revisit that
[19:09] again that's what makes Jesus so great
[19:13] that he was such a servant to other
[19:16] people I just love what John said I'm
[19:17] always reminded that in John chapter 20.
[19:19] you know he said I suppose even the
[19:21] whole world cannot contain the books
[19:23] that could be written about Jesus's
[19:25] leadership
[19:28] because that's what he was he was a
[19:30] servant a servant leader
[19:33] praise God you know I just uh
[19:36] I just thank the Lord you know you
[19:37] always Jesus was always serving other
[19:39] people
[19:41] his life was given as a a sacrifice for
[19:45] other people that's how we knew he was
[19:47] different of course he had the signs
[19:48] wonders Miracles the prophecies but here
[19:50] in this we can see how he served other
[19:52] people he went to other people he
[19:55] ministered other people
[19:56] and that's what made him great was his
[19:58] service for other people
[20:01] and great leaders as well as I'll tell
[20:03] them brother amen yesterday I was
[20:04] telling him you know what I was going to
[20:05] preach today and
[20:07] just how I was being stirred up when I
[20:08] was studying and everything like that
[20:10] uh
[20:12] I said great leaders are really great
[20:14] followers
[20:15] so whenever you see a great leader you
[20:17] know we could go I was looking at some
[20:18] other books I was looking at you know
[20:19] the history of military and all these
[20:21] things and how many great generals there
[20:22] were I mean see how you could preach
[20:23] they could preach a whole you could
[20:25] preach a whole lifetime on leadership
[20:26] really
[20:28] uh
[20:30] you know you could look to every area
[20:32] business you look at military religion
[20:35] good leadership or bad leadership but
[20:38] really the greatest leaders are those
[20:40] who follow another leader
[20:43] or have learned to follow another leader
[20:46] right
[20:48] and so Jesus followed every word of the
[20:51] father
[20:52] there can never be a greater leader than
[20:54] Christ
[20:55] never
[20:56] so here with with him it's just it's so
[20:58] simple you think about it all the all
[21:00] the self-help podcasts that are out
[21:03] all the self-help books that have been
[21:05] written over the years
[21:07] think about that think about all the
[21:08] YouTube videos and all the Rumble videos
[21:10] and all the self-help and how to lead
[21:13] and how to be successful how to be
[21:14] productive all these things
[21:16] it could all be summed up in one person
[21:19] if you want to be a great leader if you
[21:21] want uh if you want to be great in this
[21:23] life if you want a life that's worthy of
[21:25] the Gospel follow Jesus Hallelujah or
[21:28] look to Jesus's leadership and that will
[21:30] show you how to be a leader praise God
[21:34] but I was just thinking now even
[21:35] remember uh
[21:37] Miriam on the Red Sea Red Sea Shore she
[21:40] was a leader for the Sisters right with
[21:42] their worship
[21:44] right the Bible didn't say Moses got out
[21:46] there and danced the Bible said Miriam
[21:47] led the sisters out there to dance
[21:49] right
[21:51] see even that a woman leading women
[21:52] right Titus said that the Elder women
[21:55] ought to teach the younger women how to
[21:57] love their children
[21:58] how to keep their home amen see so see
[22:01] Elite sisters can be leaders right
[22:03] just simple examples like that all from
[22:05] the scripture
[22:08] but I love what Christ said uh and he
[22:10] that sent me is with me how many no
[22:12] God's with you praise God let's pull out
[22:14] all the blessings all the truth out of
[22:15] here and the father hath not left me
[22:17] alone how many know the father is with
[22:19] you praise God
[22:20] Hallelujah for I do always those things
[22:24] that please him so we get some lessons
[22:26] in here first if we want if we want
[22:29] God's presence more we have to obey What
[22:31] God Says
[22:33] right so Jesus is saying I I'm
[22:34] constantly In God's Presence God's never
[22:36] uh left me he said one of the reasons is
[22:39] because I always do that which pleases
[22:41] the father
[22:42] right
[22:44] he's with me he sent me and church yeah
[22:46] that with that thought too each one of
[22:48] us has been sent
[22:51] to this time
[22:52] we were sent here from the mind of God
[22:54] the Bible says you're chosen in Christ
[22:56] before the foundation of the world
[22:58] so God knew all six thousand years of
[23:00] human history in any prehistory whatever
[23:02] who knows how long that was
[23:04] but God knew all that but he sent you
[23:07] here at this time
[23:09] he sent you to be on the earth at this
[23:11] time
[23:12] so we know he sent us here praise God
[23:15] and by Grace he saved us he's opened our
[23:17] spiritual eyes we're no longer Children
[23:19] of the darkness we're Children of the
[23:21] light and he's proven he's with us
[23:23] praise God
[23:24] and he said I'll never leave you nor
[23:27] forsake you he cannot break the promise
[23:29] of his watchful eye his watch will care
[23:32] over our lives he's going to be faithful
[23:34] he's going to keep his word praise God
[23:36] we're set here by God to do a work
[23:38] praise God fathers are sent to lead the
[23:41] the homes and and be not discourage
[23:44] their children the Bible says right
[23:45] don't bring them to discouragement
[23:46] praise God mothers are called to nurture
[23:49] the children in the fear and admonition
[23:51] of the Lord and to and fathers are
[23:53] calling our husbands are called to love
[23:55] their wives and and wives are called to
[23:57] submit to their husbands praise God and
[23:59] all this is done through following the
[24:00] leadership of Christ's example to us
[24:03] amen
[24:04] each one of us in those situations must
[24:06] look to Christ and recognize Christ gave
[24:10] me the example Christ showed me what I
[24:11] must do Christ was a leader he showed me
[24:14] how to overcome in this situation
[24:17] he showed me how
[24:19] uh he gave me guidance for this moment
[24:22] of my life praise God
[24:25] and you know I just think about you know
[24:26] the moment the moment that we're in
[24:28] we're in a moment of mourning
[24:30] we're in a moment of loss with zur's
[24:32] Father passing and amen being sick
[24:35] this probably isn't a dance in service
[24:37] like we'd say
[24:39] we've had some too brother Matt they've
[24:40] been really wonderful we've I've been
[24:41] dancing we've been dancing all around
[24:42] here by God's grace it's been good
[24:45] Hallelujah
[24:47] but you know look at the moment and you
[24:49] I just got to watch those things look at
[24:51] the moment that we're in now
[24:53] we got sick and Afflicted we got
[24:56] you know we got
[24:57] death we got to deal with that
[25:02] but you know in each moment we can look
[25:03] to the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[25:04] Lord what must I do in this hour
[25:07] what's the direction for right now guide
[25:10] me for this moment praise God
[25:12] but I just want to say this too if God
[25:15] answered somebody's prayer and you want
[25:16] to dance around the church you go right
[25:17] ahead
[25:18] have your Liberty you know do like David
[25:20] you just do it with all your might
[25:22] praise God
[25:23] don't give me a half might dance
[25:25] who's looking at me who's watching me
[25:28] should I do how should I dance just do
[25:30] with all your heart praise God
[25:32] let's do it with all your money dance
[25:33] like Dave and dance amen praise God we
[25:36] dance at the school on Friday you know
[25:37] the kids every week I ask the kids at
[25:38] bible Club who wants what song you want
[25:40] to sing and they always say dance like
[25:41] David dance
[25:43] see there's something about a child the
[25:45] joy in their hearts I saw I danced
[25:46] around my classroom Friday morning I do
[25:48] it almost every Friday
[25:50] I'm always dancing around the school
[25:52] there
[25:54] but it's something about children they
[25:55] always want to dance praise God they
[25:57] always want to uh they always they're
[25:59] always usually joyful usually you know
[26:01] if their lives have been protected by
[26:03] the grace of God
[26:04] and the Bible said we must become like
[26:06] children to enter the kingdom of God
[26:08] Hallelujah but thank God he's never left
[26:11] you alone and church you can do those
[26:13] things that please the father
[26:15] Hallelujah you can do it today
[26:17] you and I can choose to please the
[26:19] father today
[26:21] Glory bless you
[26:23] and you know Jesus again these are more
[26:26] thoughts about Christ hearing from the
[26:27] father
[26:29] but you know Jesus only gave them what
[26:31] they could handle
[26:34] right you know like how many times have
[26:35] you prayed for Lord
[26:37] help me to know something I want to know
[26:39] this I want to know that God doesn't
[26:40] always answer
[26:42] right because God knows maybe our motive
[26:44] and objective is wrong or our motive
[26:47] objective could be right but it's just
[26:48] not the time and season for it
[26:51] right
[26:53] so Jesus said henceforth I call you not
[26:55] servants for the servant knoweth not
[26:57] what his Lord doeth now of course they
[26:59] were still servants but he's saying in
[27:00] our relationship you're not you're not
[27:02] he's comparing their relationship to
[27:04] Servant or son there the disciples are
[27:06] always going to be servants everybody
[27:07] understands a minister or a child of God
[27:10] is always going to be a servant but he's
[27:11] just talking about their relationship on
[27:13] our relationship you're not going to be
[27:14] a servant you're going to be equal
[27:16] you're going to be a friend
[27:17] right now of course nobody's equal to
[27:19] Jesus so don't take that too far you're
[27:21] getting all kinds of false doctrines
[27:22] that people take things too far
[27:23] but our relationship you're not going to
[27:25] need a servant you're going to be a
[27:27] friend
[27:28] I'm raising up as Abraham was a friend
[27:30] of God Amen so are we the friends of
[27:33] Christ Hallelujah
[27:36] see the servant doesn't know what he's
[27:38] doing that's why I thank God for the
[27:39] message praise God we know what God is
[27:41] doing right now praise God God is doing
[27:44] uh Revelation 10 8-11 we're eating the
[27:46] book praise God where's my Bible did I
[27:48] leave my Bible in there
[27:50] I left my Bible in there well I always
[27:52] got an extra up here anyway Hallelujah I
[27:55] can't believe I left my Bible in there I
[27:57] left my my good old Scofield
[28:00] but that's what he's done we're eating
[28:01] the revelations of this book the water
[28:03] baptism Hallelujah the marriage and
[28:05] divorce which is crucial
[28:06] people can be adulterers fornicators and
[28:09] not inherit the kingdom of God
[28:10] and think of all these Revelations we
[28:12] have with us saith the Lord the Seven
[28:13] Seals the seven Church ages we have all
[28:15] these Revelations we're eating those
[28:16] Revelations and prophesying them again
[28:20] but we're they're not getting more
[28:22] people Jesus said there's actually less
[28:23] people he said few will find the way
[28:25] that leads to life but thank God we're
[28:27] some of those few praise God oh my thank
[28:30] God I wasn't even looking for this
[28:31] message it came to me you know why
[28:33] because I was hungry for truth
[28:35] well all the other football guys went
[28:37] out I was there in my I was dorm I was
[28:39] reading the Bible on Saturday nights
[28:42] I was in denomination you know what does
[28:44] Matthew 7 mean how how can you do
[28:47] prophecies and go to hell
[28:49] I didn't understand
[28:50] a few months later I hear Brother Brown
[28:52] preach anoint the ones the end time now
[28:54] I understand praise God hallelujah it's
[28:56] a beautiful Revelation praise God but
[28:58] see we know where we are Hallelujah so
[29:00] see that proves we're the friends of God
[29:02] like Abraham he knew where he was going
[29:04] Hallelujah just like that where the Seed
[29:06] of Abraham we know where we're going
[29:08] praise God church and I mean this too
[29:10] you know I watch different uh you know
[29:11] just Christian news sources like CB I
[29:13] never heard of CBN or anything like that
[29:15] they actually believe there's going to
[29:17] be a great Revival
[29:18] and all these uh prophets in the
[29:21] charismatic movement they're not profits
[29:24] they say there's going to be this great
[29:25] story this great Revival but we don't
[29:27] see that in the Bible
[29:30] right we see Paul saying evil seducers
[29:32] will act worse and worse deceiving and
[29:34] being deceived
[29:37] we see Paul saying we're not children of
[29:39] the darkness we're Children of the light
[29:40] praise God
[29:42] Hallelujah and the whole world will be
[29:43] groped in darkness the Bible says the
[29:45] Antichrist will deceive All Nations
[29:46] including China including the USA
[29:48] including Russia right including Ukraine
[29:50] Satan will the Antichrist will deceive
[29:52] all of them so the Bible paints a very
[29:54] dark picture but thank God we know where
[29:56] we are praise God we're not servants
[29:58] we're friends hallelujah we're not
[30:00] strangers we're family hallelujah amen
[30:03] thank God but that's really what they're
[30:04] preaching
[30:06] I just heard a prophet now a charismatic
[30:09] prophet
[30:09] uh yesterday now the reason I listened
[30:12] to him was because he reached out to me
[30:13] and he liked one of my YouTube videos
[30:15] and now he's the president of this
[30:17] charismatic group and
[30:19] he was trying to pull me into his
[30:21] influence and I said I don't want your
[30:23] influence
[30:25] I said you could have my influence I
[30:26] don't want your influence
[30:28] he was trying to get me to put him on my
[30:31] YouTube channel oh my God
[30:33] I don't do that
[30:34] but he was saying oh there's this great
[30:36] Revival coming and we feel it coming oh
[30:38] yeah he said there's gonna be such a
[30:41] Revival
[30:42] that God will send Christians all the
[30:45] money to pay off America's debt now look
[30:47] how close that is oh I just thought of
[30:49] that right now
[30:50] he said don't you know God can come up
[30:52] with 32 trillion because that's how much
[30:54] our debt is
[30:57] oh yeah the ceiling yeah I don't know if
[30:58] they're going to go into gridlock or not
[31:01] but like that's their thinking like okay
[31:03] so uh God's Gonna Save A bunch of people
[31:05] and then God's gonna send all the
[31:07] Christians money to get America out of
[31:09] debt and there's going to be a new age
[31:10] you see how that's it's so wrong but
[31:13] it's it's so close
[31:15] like brother Ram said the debt is going
[31:18] to cause somebody to pay it off but it
[31:19] ain't going to be Jesus it can be the
[31:21] Antichrist it's going to be the Pope
[31:23] right
[31:24] right it has to be because the woman
[31:26] sits on Seven Hills who else sits on
[31:29] Seven Hills but the Roman Catholic
[31:30] Church the seven ancient cities or seven
[31:33] ancient Hills of Rome I mean it has to
[31:35] be the Pope
[31:37] but see how it's so close but yet it's
[31:38] so far away but thank God we are not
[31:41] servants amen hallelujah we're not
[31:43] servants We are family members we're
[31:45] children of God hallelujah we're Jesus
[31:47] is Broad hallelujah amen oh thank God
[31:51] so let him have 15 000 views on his on
[31:54] his on his latest video and I'll take
[31:55] five five or ten
[31:58] let him take that he can have it because
[32:00] the word of God will go to God's elect
[32:02] amen hallelujah God's word will not
[32:05] return void Hallelujah
[32:07] oh it's beautiful
[32:08] that we're not servants we're friends
[32:10] but I've called you friends I'll be glad
[32:12] to be a friend of Jesus
[32:15] I'm glad I'm not a stranger to Christ
[32:16] I'm glad I'm his friend
[32:19] for all the things I've heard of my
[32:21] father I have made known unto you
[32:23] praise God
[32:25] all that God wants us to know he's made
[32:28] known to us and we just know this too as
[32:30] much as we need to know for the Rapture
[32:32] Jesus will let us know all that we need
[32:35] remember brother Adam said thou say the
[32:36] Lord we received the last sign for the
[32:38] Gentiles
[32:39] his ministry the discernment of that was
[32:41] the last sign to the Gentiles so we're
[32:43] not looking for some other great sign
[32:46] we're looking for what the scripture
[32:47] says we're looking for Jesus to return
[32:49] praise God
[32:50] we're looking to trim our lamps
[32:52] Hallelujah and get closer to God and
[32:54] live a more Sanctified dedicated life
[32:56] praise God and also here's another thing
[32:59] I've preached of course you heard me say
[33:00] this we're looking for American laws to
[33:03] change based on the influence of The
[33:05] ecumenical move
[33:07] because that's what program lays out in
[33:08] spoken word Original Seed and the church
[33:10] age book right
[33:11] people have asked me that what are you
[33:12] looking for about Joseph what are we
[33:13] looking for
[33:14] well that's what that's what brother
[33:15] Adam says America has to change the laws
[33:18] in order to murder the Christians
[33:21] because if you don't take the mark of
[33:22] the beast you get murdered
[33:25] so Bob Brown says the churches will
[33:27] unite kind of Unite with the government
[33:28] in order to change the laws that's why I
[33:31] watch the different news places mostly
[33:33] now I'm on Newsmax because the other
[33:34] places
[33:35] just get that Newsmax I mean it's just
[33:38] hard to find any good news source if
[33:39] somebody finds a good news source let me
[33:40] know
[33:41] I've been looking for a long time it's
[33:43] hard to find a good news source where
[33:44] you actually get the updated news of
[33:46] what you know is going on in the Senate
[33:47] and the house and all these things
[33:48] but
[33:49] that's what Broadband told us to do
[33:52] that's what that's what brother Brown
[33:53] said was going to happen and we see it
[33:55] happening remember Trump even allowed
[33:57] the churches now to get into politics
[33:59] remember I showed you that in 2017. I
[34:01] don't have the article right now but
[34:03] he allowed the churches to have more
[34:05] influence in politics and church is just
[34:07] increasing all the time
[34:08] right it's increasing all the time so
[34:10] that's what we're watching for before
[34:13] the mark can be laid down Jesus said I
[34:15] will keep you from the hour Temptation
[34:17] that will come upon the whole earth in
[34:19] Revelation 3 verse 10. why because
[34:21] you've kept the word of his patience
[34:23] Hallelujah
[34:25] if you've kept God's word if you've kept
[34:27] God's leadership he'll rescue you from
[34:29] this one world government thank God
[34:31] we'll be rescued because the word of God
[34:32] has been shared with us his friends
[34:34] hallelujah oh my thank God that was not
[34:37] my notes I just thought I'd preached
[34:38] that today Hallelujah
[34:40] Jesus told him right before he has sent
[34:42] it up to heaven he said he said unto
[34:43] them it is not for you to know the times
[34:45] of the seasons which the father hath put
[34:47] in his own power
[34:49] right so no man knows the day or the
[34:50] hour you know it was
[34:52] it was just shocking to me I was reading
[34:54] uh Charles days Russell and
[34:56] um Uriah Smith this week
[34:59] and I was shocked to see that uh Charles
[35:00] says Russell
[35:02] predicted the Rapture would be in April
[35:04] I think it was uh
[35:07] 1878 or something like that he predicted
[35:10] the Rapture and people still follow him
[35:13] you know I was you know I was just
[35:15] thinking like like Jesus said
[35:18] no man knows those times
[35:20] now was he still safe in one way yeah
[35:23] because he didn't say the day and the
[35:24] hour
[35:25] he gave the month in the year was he
[35:27] still safe yes but look how deceptive
[35:29] that is
[35:30] now come and gone and they said okay
[35:32] well there's reasons it could fail and
[35:33] now they still of course he started the
[35:35] Jehovah's Witnesses movement and
[35:36] everything like that
[35:37] see how that I just was reading that
[35:38] this week
[35:40] but he had all these other doctrines
[35:42] like Jonah went to hell and everything
[35:43] and then came back because the Bible
[35:45] said when he was in the whale he went
[35:46] down to the depths of Hell well that
[35:48] wasn't literal
[35:50] but that's what he taught
[35:52] you know all these kind of things you
[35:54] know
[35:55] it just really shows we need the
[35:56] leadership of the Holy Spirit praise God
[35:58] hallelujah thank God we got it
[36:00] Hallelujah because it's in the word of
[36:01] God hallelujah the Holy Ghost will only
[36:03] point us to the word of God
[36:06] that's right
[36:07] now I just want to
[36:09] encourage you
[36:11] that this you know Jesus's life shows us
[36:14] that we can be great leaders too
[36:17] not that we'll call ourselves great I
[36:19] never want to say that we're not calling
[36:20] ourselves great but we can achieve
[36:21] wonderful things for Christ
[36:24] because he had no physical Beauty
[36:27] now don't raise your hands but how many
[36:29] feel you're not handsome enough
[36:33] but you sisters don't feel like you're
[36:35] not pretty enough don't raise your hand
[36:37] but like right we all battle these
[36:39] complexes right
[36:41] but Jesus had none of that and yet he
[36:43] could still influence billions
[36:45] hallelujah amen he can still make the
[36:47] most lasting impact as a leader because
[36:50] it didn't deal with your physical image
[36:52] it deals with your spiritual image
[36:54] praise God
[36:55] Amen it's not who you are naturally it's
[36:59] who you are spiritually praise God
[37:01] it's what people see behind the the Veil
[37:05] it's the Christ it's the character that
[37:07] they see behind the outer person
[37:10] it's the character
[37:12] soon after you never have to worry
[37:13] sisters well I'm not pretty enough for
[37:16] her
[37:18] my hair is not long enough
[37:20] or brothers I don't have enough hair I'm
[37:22] losing my hair
[37:24] you never never have to worry about
[37:26] nonsense like that because that's not a
[37:28] requirement the requirement is to obey
[37:31] the father Hallelujah
[37:33] thank God and church it don't require
[37:36] money
[37:40] for the rest of the Holy Ghost is not
[37:41] moved by money he moves by his power
[37:45] so the the prayer should never be Lord I
[37:47] want more money so I can do something
[37:48] for you that that has nothing to do with
[37:50] it
[37:53] money often corrupts and you know power
[37:55] without character satanic and that's
[37:57] what that's you know that you know Oral
[37:59] Roberts may have started out right I
[38:01] don't know I wasn't there but by the end
[38:02] of his ministry that money had corrupted
[38:04] that man
[38:06] have you seen it where he and he
[38:08] ordained Kenneth Copeland take his place
[38:10] and he said
[38:13] he used that scripture in Acts where
[38:15] Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None
[38:17] and he was ordaining Kenneth Copeland
[38:19] and he said Silver and Gold Have We much
[38:21] and they all clapped and they
[38:23] they were saying hallelujah now which
[38:25] now which one do they got they got money
[38:27] but they got no power
[38:29] I'd rather have power and less money
[38:33] thank God for what he you know the signs
[38:34] wonders and miracles he's done in our
[38:36] lives thank God for that
[38:37] but look no matter how he started look
[38:39] at the end Church look at the end
[38:42] unbelievable
[38:44] so it never it never involves riches
[38:47] you know and I'll just be
[38:50] I'll just be transparent you know we I
[38:51] think as Americans we all battle like oh
[38:53] if I just had a little more money
[38:57] if I could just get a little more what
[38:59] can I do to get a little more money
[39:02] but godliness with contentment is what
[39:04] hallelujah amen church amen I'm Amen to
[39:07] you now
[39:08] your testimony
[39:12] you know but it's never by physical
[39:14] looks it's never by riches if you want
[39:16] to be a good leader it's not going to be
[39:17] right into that
[39:18] it's not how much money you have
[39:21] it's not how many likes you got on your
[39:23] selfie
[39:27] I never really got into this I thank God
[39:29] I didn't get into those
[39:31] but see it's all about them it's all
[39:33] about me right it's that's not a leader
[39:35] a leader it's all about you
[39:38] the real leader says it's all about you
[39:40] how can I serve you
[39:44] and it's it's not really how many years
[39:46] you have in your life
[39:49] because again Christ really of Holy
[39:51] Ghost Ministry he only had three and a
[39:52] half years
[39:54] and it's been the greatest Ministry
[39:55] there ever was
[39:57] you know Moses had 40 Years of ministry
[39:58] powerful he part of the Red Sea
[40:01] he spoke things into existence think of
[40:03] that church he spoke please into
[40:06] existence frogs into existence he just
[40:08] spoke it
[40:09] but that didn't compare nothing to John
[40:11] the Baptist
[40:13] now you tell you figure that one out for
[40:15] me
[40:15] he spoke things and
[40:18] his his stick ate up two other serpents
[40:21] all the supernatural he saw the hand of
[40:23] God he was he was so much in God's
[40:25] presence his face was turning like God's
[40:27] face amen it was glowing but God still
[40:30] said Jesus said John the Baptist is
[40:31] greater than all these other prophets
[40:35] so it's not it's not even like the
[40:37] supernatural in your life
[40:40] not even that not even the depths of
[40:43] the supernatural experiences doesn't
[40:46] make a person a better leader now was he
[40:48] a great leader yes Moses was a great
[40:49] leader no doubt by the grace of God
[40:52] but let's just cancel all these off our
[40:54] expectations well if I'm going to be a
[40:56] good leader I got to be handsome no
[40:57] that's that one if I'm a good leader I
[40:59] gotta have riches no that's not one uh
[41:01] for me to be a good leader I got to have
[41:02] a really long ministry that's not one
[41:04] either
[41:07] so how many feel better about your
[41:08] chances to be a good leader so far
[41:12] Hallelujah I feel pretty good too
[41:14] thank God
[41:16] six months how could six months of
[41:18] ministry be greater than 40 years
[41:23] it had to been
[41:25] like brother man said about he said why
[41:26] did why did God use the spirit of Elijah
[41:28] because he was so obedient to the word
[41:30] of God
[41:32] right
[41:33] Elijah would get thus saith the Lord and
[41:35] go out there now let me think about that
[41:36] church he'd go right up to the white
[41:37] house that day and say thus saith the
[41:39] Lord Jezebel
[41:41] think about that
[41:42] thus saith the Lord Ahab
[41:44] and he could have died
[41:47] thou saith lord it's not going to rain
[41:48] until I call for it he stomped out of
[41:51] the window went out back to the
[41:53] Wilderness now we know that's an Old
[41:54] Testament Prophet New Testament prophets
[41:55] stay with the church today right we
[41:57] looked at that
[42:00] but John the Baptist got right there in
[42:02] the face of uh Herod and herodias said
[42:05] it ain't lawful for you to be married to
[42:06] this person
[42:09] and it burned her up I want to begin his
[42:11] head on a charger
[42:13] just couldn't couldn't handle that
[42:15] rebuke
[42:16] what do you do he just preach repentance
[42:18] repent repent and the Bible said the
[42:20] mountains were made low and The Valleys
[42:22] were raised up it put everybody on the
[42:24] same plane because all all men are
[42:27] without excuse praise God
[42:29] John the Baptist preaching just put it
[42:30] all on the same level everybody needs to
[42:32] repent and Herod even honored John the
[42:34] Baptist in some things but not in the
[42:36] important things praise God God help us
[42:38] let's listen to brother Brandon let's
[42:40] listen to God's Prophet but let's obey
[42:42] all the word of God hallelujah
[42:45] right we see all these people say well
[42:46] just press play and yeah we should
[42:48] listen to the tapes in the quietness of
[42:49] our room but what about forgiving
[42:52] what about repenting of all your sins
[42:54] especially worshiping man like brother
[42:56] Branham
[42:57] right worshiping brother Brandon
[42:58] worshiping Joseph or worshiping Milly
[43:00] power worshiping the tapes or worshiping
[43:01] your pastor or something like that
[43:03] yeah let's obey the most important
[43:05] things amen Jesus said you must obey all
[43:07] the way to your matters of the law
[43:08] praise God judgment Justice Mercy amen
[43:12] hallelujah let's obey what's the most
[43:14] important praise God hallelujah
[43:17] see they might they major on a minor
[43:21] it's good to press play in the quietness
[43:23] of your home I do it in the quietness of
[43:25] my drive to church or the quietness of
[43:27] when I'm washing dishes
[43:30] but that don't get exalted above the
[43:32] fivefold ministry sit down and put
[43:34] brother and brat back in his place but
[43:36] man the Bible never said to do that nor
[43:37] did Brother Brown ever say to do that I
[43:39] sent Joseph the message the other day I
[43:40] said why are you saying change why are
[43:42] you saying change the ministry when
[43:43] brother Brown said don't change a thing
[43:46] I'm still waiting for my reply here
[43:50] see because when you have the truth
[43:51] you're not afraid to answer questions
[43:54] that's what I found
[43:55] it's easy to put stuff out but now let's
[43:57] take some questions here that's what
[43:59] they don't want they don't want
[44:00] questions just follow me and give me
[44:02] your money that's what people want
[44:04] that's not what we want we want to
[44:06] follow Christ and serve other people
[44:08] how many one do that by God's grace
[44:10] so think about that you know that's a
[44:12] whole other thought I'd like to get into
[44:13] that at some point how can we six months
[44:15] be greater than 40 years speaking
[44:17] squirrels
[44:19] seeing the hand of God right Ten
[44:21] Commandments on two tables of stone
[44:22] watching God's hand do it
[44:25] but somehow it was greater because Jesus
[44:27] Christ said so
[44:29] Hallelujah
[44:31] a church I was this was my chapter of
[44:33] the morning you know Proverbs 21. so I
[44:35] thought wow this is a pretty nice
[44:36] chapter to read I'm going to preach on
[44:38] leadership
[44:39] he that filed after righteousness so see
[44:42] if you're being led you're going
[44:44] somewhere
[44:45] and if we're following Christ if we're
[44:48] following his leading then we know where
[44:49] we're going we're going towards
[44:51] righteousness that's integrity
[44:53] right right doing what's right
[44:55] you're not going to be a liar you're not
[44:57] going to be a swindler
[44:58] you're not going to be a deceiver now
[45:00] you're going to make mistakes you're
[45:01] going to tell that you're going to do
[45:02] we're all going to make mistakes but
[45:04] you're gonna say Jesus forgive me try me
[45:06] again Hallelujah
[45:07] drive me again Lord amen
[45:10] and you're on the path Jesus had led you
[45:12] to what he's leading you to Mercy and to
[45:15] eternal life amen amen amen hallelujah
[45:18] is leading you to heaven Hallelujah he's
[45:20] leading you to a life of Integrity
[45:22] showing Mercy on other people
[45:24] now I don't have the verse in front of
[45:26] me but I read it the other day in
[45:27] Proverbs the Bible said a real king
[45:29] shows mercy and I'm just paraphrasing
[45:31] like any King can lead and oh one
[45:33] mistake cut off their heads right any
[45:34] King could do that right but Proverbs
[45:37] says a real King has Mercy on others
[45:40] yes he exercises judgment but he also
[45:43] must show Mercy
[45:45] right
[45:47] now we're all glad God is a god he's a
[45:48] god of Mercy praise God
[45:50] if not he'd all get rid of us
[45:52] now I was studying uh the Zuzu Street
[45:54] Revival I'm gonna preach on the Zuzu
[45:55] Street Revival pretty soon pretty
[45:56] powerful stuff there pretty powerful
[45:58] stuff and it can really help us
[46:00] it could really help us
[46:01] but William Seymour at the beginning of
[46:03] his ministry when the Holy Ghost first
[46:05] fell
[46:07] he was real hard on Saint vacation
[46:09] so he was taught under uh preachers that
[46:13] taught Wesley's sanctification
[46:16] and so at when the Holy Ghost fell you
[46:19] know it fell because they prayed seven
[46:20] hours a day
[46:23] seven hours a day
[46:24] now that's not always what has to happen
[46:27] right because corneos we know he prayed
[46:28] gave alms fasted but we don't know how
[46:30] much
[46:31] the Bible never says Thou shalt pray
[46:33] seven hours a day then thou shall get
[46:35] the Holy Ghost the bible say that
[46:37] God fills you when you're empty
[46:40] and no man knows the number of hours but
[46:43] just this is the point if you want a
[46:44] great Revival you got to put a lot of
[46:45] investment into it yeah
[46:47] right
[46:49] but he was so strict at the beginning
[46:50] right when the Holy Ghost fell Church
[46:52] they had three services every day for
[46:55] three years
[46:57] think about that think about the times
[46:59] where think about the times where you
[47:00] can't wait to get back to church right
[47:02] that feeling okay
[47:03] and I mean twice on Sunday twice on
[47:05] Sunday
[47:07] most churches do once on Sunday
[47:09] right we're one of the few that does too
[47:12] but think about that
[47:13] think about the love you have oh I can't
[47:15] wait to come back to the evening service
[47:16] what a move of God right they had that
[47:18] re-services
[47:20] for seven days a week
[47:22] for three years
[47:25] because they kept coming back
[47:28] you couldn't keep them away and there's
[47:30] pictures they could I think they could
[47:31] fit 800 in that building and then they
[47:34] said there was 500 out in the outside
[47:36] waiting
[47:38] but he eventually got you know after
[47:39] three years he got to this point where
[47:41] he was preaching if you don't say
[47:43] Sanctified you've lost your salvation
[47:44] now he was wrong but he was on to
[47:47] something because we know Judas fell
[47:48] away
[47:49] right and God says in the Old Testament
[47:52] Moses said blot my name out and God said
[47:54] no I'll blot out the names of those who
[47:56] sinned against me
[47:58] so people can lose their testimony and
[48:00] lose salvation
[48:02] he was onto something but
[48:05] but when he when he he was going too
[48:07] hard on that during the Revival and
[48:09] people just started leaving because they
[48:10] needed what they needed Mercy
[48:13] Church you and I can only we could only
[48:15] maintain Revival for so long
[48:18] right
[48:19] if you don't know just get about eight
[48:21] kids you'll find out you you can only
[48:23] maintain a Revival for so long
[48:27] or just get two kids or whatever just
[48:28] get one just get one
[48:31] they you know what I'm saying is they
[48:32] keep you up all night you know they got
[48:34] to take the diapers and you got to do
[48:35] all these things
[48:36] they just wear you out get a few nights
[48:38] where you don't have sleep how excited
[48:39] are you going to go to church you know
[48:42] it's just it's brother I've said a
[48:44] revival can only lasts about three four
[48:45] years a man's Ministry the first three
[48:47] four years sometimes that's where you
[48:49] see the great move and they just got to
[48:51] maintain after that
[48:52] that's how I mean John Wesley did a
[48:55] great job for 88 years you know that was
[48:56] a powerful job he might have been the
[48:58] the exception to the ruler I don't know
[49:00] I haven't studied his life enough
[49:02] but see Seymour had to learn Mercy
[49:05] and by the end of it right before he
[49:07] died he was preaching to us they were
[49:08] down to 20 people imagine that you had
[49:10] you had 800 people every week for three
[49:13] years
[49:14] but because of your then he made some
[49:16] mistakes every man does
[49:19] no pastor's perfect
[49:21] yeah thank God they said that amen then
[49:22] they'll forgive me if I make a mistake
[49:24] they won't vote me out
[49:26] because I Repent I'll make it right but
[49:28] by the end he was down to 20 people per
[49:30] service
[49:32] and he was telling the people he would
[49:33] say
[49:35] do not seek the gift seek The Giver
[49:38] because he saw all these people speak in
[49:40] tongues
[49:41] and Fall Away they were only seeking an
[49:44] experience a one-time experience rather
[49:46] than a lifetime of leadership you say it
[49:49] like that
[49:50] and he learned Mercy by the end the
[49:52] beginning it was like if you backslide
[49:53] if you do this you're going to hell you
[49:55] lost it now there's some truth to that
[49:56] but he went too hard on it
[49:59] people started leaving
[50:01] Revival leaves
[50:04] they had all these schisms they had so
[50:06] much Unity that was a time where there
[50:07] was segregation between white and blacks
[50:09] but he brought everybody together and
[50:10] that's why God blessed it was such a
[50:12] time of unity but then God brought
[50:14] divisions these preachers it was it's
[50:15] funny and every time they'd lock out a
[50:17] preacher if they didn't like what the
[50:18] preacher said they wait till he leave to
[50:20] eat and then they lock the door when you
[50:22] come back he couldn't get back in to
[50:23] preach anymore it happened they just did
[50:25] it over and over again
[50:26] they didn't see more when he first got
[50:28] there
[50:29] the church locked him out and then he
[50:31] had to lock other preachers out and we
[50:33] just was division after division after
[50:34] division Strife strive Strife strive
[50:36] strife
[50:38] the Satan attacked the unity of the
[50:40] church
[50:41] but by the end he learned God's God of
[50:43] Mercy
[50:44] and seek to know Christ he yeah he said
[50:47] let the evidence be the fruits of the
[50:48] spirit that was so powerful he said Let
[50:51] It Be love amen let it be loving your
[50:53] heart for other people to serve them
[50:55] praise God that was his message at the
[50:57] end
[50:59] it was beautiful I mean it's a beautiful
[51:00] lesson we can learn from these these
[51:02] brothers
[51:03] I mean especially with the lens of the
[51:05] message the hour I mean it's three works
[51:07] of Grace
[51:08] they were so close Charles parnam was a
[51:10] white man uh Seymour was a black man
[51:12] white uh he and that's the one who
[51:14] Seymour got taught under and he taught
[51:16] he was the first one to preach three
[51:17] works of Grace but he said the third
[51:19] work is speaking in tongues he was so
[51:21] close he had two out of three
[51:23] but that's better than the lutherans
[51:25] they just had one right better than the
[51:27] the wesleyans they just had two
[51:31] but see what a great blessing we can
[51:33] learn
[51:35] from the message of the hour
[51:38] see we're being led and we're going
[51:40] somewhere
[51:41] Christ is leading us he's leading us to
[51:43] righteousness look at this Mercy life
[51:46] and then he says again righteousness and
[51:47] honor
[51:48] Hallelujah
[51:50] so what does that mean I'm not making a
[51:52] Doctrine or anything but look at that
[51:53] double righteousness we talk about a
[51:56] double anointing right here
[51:59] give me uh give me a double portion of
[52:00] your spear there we go that's what it is
[52:02] oh Lord give me a double portion give me
[52:04] a double portion how about a double
[52:05] portion of righteousness
[52:07] help me to be double righteous to this
[52:09] week and be totally a man or woman of
[52:12] Integrity for Christ
[52:14] I'll take that over speaking in tongues
[52:16] twice I'll take that any day
[52:18] I appreciate that uh the women would say
[52:20] it's like they had a jar inside him and
[52:22] then it burst and that this tongues just
[52:24] came out that's beautiful
[52:25] but what about the rest of the week
[52:28] what about when somebody goes against
[52:30] your idea what about when somebody calls
[52:33] you a name
[52:35] how are you going to respond give me a
[52:36] righteous Heart Lord God
[52:38] give me a righteous heart
[52:40] I set my time okay I'm on that 48
[52:42] minutes okay so
[52:44] I set my timer for an hour
[52:47] so when we follow Christ as Kings and
[52:48] Priests we find all these blessings
[52:50] right the king's heart is in the hands
[52:52] of the Lord as the rivers of water he
[52:54] turneth it with orsoever he will so this
[52:57] is a good King
[52:58] right now we know God can control the
[53:01] evil Kings too he can cause them to give
[53:03] uh he can cause him to keep the word of
[53:05] God like Nebuchadnezzar and everything
[53:06] like that
[53:07] servants in the hand of God
[53:09] but this is what we want our hearts to
[53:11] be we want our hearts to be like water
[53:12] so God can turn us whatever way he wants
[53:14] to lead us
[53:16] Lord I really you're turning me to be
[53:18] more of a servant praise God
[53:20] you're turning me to focus focus more on
[53:22] prayer
[53:24] you're turning me to to focus more on
[53:27] reaching out to other people being a
[53:28] help and blessing to them
[53:30] how many would say that Lord turn my
[53:32] heart as you turn the waters praise God
[53:34] turn my heart if I'm going the wrong
[53:36] direction Lord just turn my heart
[53:38] because I want to be a king
[53:40] I want to be I want to be an example of
[53:42] leadership somebody can look at and say
[53:43] God just turned his heart towards
[53:45] something
[53:46] I can follow that kind of that type of a
[53:48] leader
[53:49] because God's leading me to that my
[53:51] heart is opening to this
[53:53] right my heart is changing Hallelujah
[53:55] God help our hearts to change Amen to be
[53:57] more like Christ
[53:59] it's a beautiful thought
[54:01] because we are Kings and Priests unto
[54:03] God we know that Revelation went out to
[54:05] preach that again I've preached 125
[54:06] sermons on the Book of Revelation you've
[54:09] all been patiently sat through and
[54:10] enjoyed it by God's grace
[54:12] remember we read this a few weeks ago
[54:13] you know we are Kings and Priests
[54:16] by Christ let us offer therefore I'm
[54:19] sorry therefore let us offer the
[54:21] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[54:23] that is the fruits of our lips giving
[54:25] thanks to his name now we're talking
[54:26] about leadership
[54:28] if you want to be a great leader let God
[54:31] move your heart
[54:32] right to his plan and make sure your
[54:35] mouth is always giving God praise
[54:37] continually
[54:38] right
[54:39] so just like we said thanking God
[54:41] whatever situation we're in whether
[54:43] we're in a Temptation like I was talking
[54:45] with amen if you're in the Temptation or
[54:47] if you're you're being hedged about and
[54:49] you're not really battled with many
[54:50] Temptations God has you hedged like job
[54:53] and protection or if you're coming up to
[54:55] a temptation
[54:57] right if you know if something's coming
[54:58] I feel something Stern things are get a
[55:01] little strange here if you're coming up
[55:03] to a Temptation let's do what the Bible
[55:06] says I thank God in every place I'm at
[55:08] I thank God God's going to guide me here
[55:10] I feel something coming on or I'm in the
[55:12] midst of fires this seems awful this is
[55:14] hard but I'm still going to give God
[55:16] praise Hallelujah the midst of the trial
[55:18] praise God or if it feels like all the
[55:21] enemies are under my feet I'll give God
[55:23] praise I'll say hallelujah thank you
[55:25] Jesus amen thank God for a Mountaintop
[55:27] experience Hallelujah
[55:29] we sure ought to enjoy those like I said
[55:31] you better enjoy your mountaintops
[55:32] because you're gonna have some valleys
[55:34] grab some dark valleys
[55:37] but the same Christ that's with you in
[55:38] the valley will be with you on the
[55:39] Mountaintop
[55:42] but to do good and to communicate forget
[55:44] not for with such sacrifices God is well
[55:47] pleased so God is pleased when you
[55:48] praise him when you do good things and
[55:50] when you communicate right
[55:53] and God is well pleased now remember
[55:54] Church
[55:55] God loves us
[55:57] God loves you he died for you praise God
[56:00] and you can know God as well pleased
[56:02] when you do these things
[56:04] when you make the sacrifice I'm going to
[56:06] praise God in the midst of my trial
[56:10] I'm going to do good today I'm not going
[56:12] to do evil
[56:14] you know you can go to sleep at the at
[56:16] that at night time you can look yourself
[56:18] in the mirror and say thank God God's
[56:20] well pleased with my life
[56:22] I've done good today
[56:23] right I praise God all throughout the
[56:26] day
[56:28] and then I've communicated I forgot the
[56:30] definition of that brother Matt do you
[56:31] happen to know that at this moment the
[56:32] Greek definition of communicate
[56:35] is it really praise God Amen
[56:39] that's that's felister that's right yes
[56:41] I preached on it
[56:43] yeah the financial element that's right
[56:44] that's right thank you let's give him
[56:45] two claps
[56:47] Hallelujah yeah somebody emailed me
[56:50] about that a few weeks ago and I was
[56:51] like I know that what is that I'm like
[56:52] Get Out of My Head you know
[56:55] yeah so you know Lord I've given my
[56:58] tithes and offerings or I've helped out
[56:59] the poor today now you're not bragging
[57:00] but you're just being honest it's the
[57:02] end of the day
[57:03] Lord I know you're pleased with me
[57:05] and remember don't trust your feelings
[57:06] we looked at that last week right your
[57:09] feelings are lying to you all the time
[57:10] look at what God says about you
[57:13] don't trust your feelings they'll betray
[57:15] you all the time
[57:17] all the time
[57:19] and then obey so here's leadership so
[57:22] when you obey the Lord you're actually
[57:24] following his leadership right obey them
[57:26] to have the rule over you so obey the
[57:27] preaching when it's according to the
[57:29] word
[57:30] right you don't have to obey my
[57:31] testimonies because God might not work
[57:32] with you in that way you know he might
[57:33] but he might not
[57:35] obey my human mistakes obey the word of
[57:38] God
[57:39] right and look at my life the Bible said
[57:41] we're father the ministers are examples
[57:43] if you see a good example in my life
[57:45] follow that praise God
[57:47] and submit yourselves to the word for
[57:49] they watch for the ministers they watch
[57:51] over your souls as they might give
[57:53] account that they may do it with joy and
[57:55] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[57:57] for you now I've said this many times
[57:59] but on the day of judgment I've got to
[58:01] stand there with my art my church
[58:03] and I've either got to be
[58:05] I've got to give a good account of some
[58:07] of your lives I got to give a sad
[58:08] account of your lives
[58:10] right but don't don't forget someone's
[58:12] going to give account of my life the
[58:13] Lord Jesus is going to give a cow to my
[58:14] life
[58:15] right but God has ministers right the
[58:17] Bible says it
[58:19] and then fathers you got to give account
[58:20] of your homes
[58:22] right you got to give an account over
[58:24] your stewardship
[58:27] right so live in a way that you want the
[58:30] pastor to say something good about you
[58:31] on the day judgment right
[58:33] I would live in such a way that
[58:35] you know my brothers and sisters the
[58:37] congregation will say something good
[58:38] about me on the day of judgment praise
[58:39] God
[58:40] live in such a wonderful way that
[58:42] everybody knows you're led by the Holy
[58:44] Spirit
[58:45] because you're a servant
[58:50] Hallelujah we got to give an account
[58:53] when we follow Christ we follow
[58:54] spiritual blessings he that loveth
[58:56] father a mother more than me is not
[58:57] worthy of me
[58:59] I love Christ more than any family
[59:00] member and he that loveth son or
[59:02] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[59:04] me
[59:05] anyone that will put family above the
[59:07] word of God doesn't love Christ
[59:11] he that taketh not his cross and
[59:13] followeth after me is not worthy so
[59:14] leadership see so you want to be a good
[59:16] leader you got to take up a cross and
[59:17] follow Christ
[59:19] if they take up a slow death the cross
[59:21] is a slow death we gotta each each day
[59:23] we have to Die daily take up that cross
[59:26] Die daily
[59:28] don't be tempted by money that's a cross
[59:30] you got to crucify that desire right
[59:33] don't be tempted by lust you got to
[59:34] crucify that desire
[59:36] don't be tempted by uh jealousy got to
[59:38] crucify that desire
[59:40] don't be tempted by gossip you got to
[59:42] crucify that desire and you got to
[59:43] follow Christ
[59:44] don't be tempted by social media you
[59:46] gotta crucify that desire praise God
[59:50] don't don't be tempted by anything
[59:51] praise God overcome the Temptation I'm
[59:53] saying we can't help being tempted but
[59:55] overcome every Temptation don't give in
[59:57] to any Temptation praise God
[59:59] forgive me
[1:00:01] and again Jesus said in other places if
[1:00:04] a man will come after me if a man really
[1:00:06] wants to be led by the holy spirit let
[1:00:08] him deny himself take up his cross and
[1:00:09] follow me
[1:00:10] every day daily
[1:00:13] each day you take up a cross
[1:00:15] each day you're gonna something has to
[1:00:17] die out your desires my desires have to
[1:00:19] die out and that's fulfilling what Jesus
[1:00:21] said seek ye first the kingdom of God in
[1:00:23] his righteousness and all these other
[1:00:25] things will be added unto you
[1:00:27] praise God and I'm trying to get down
[1:00:28] here to close I got about a couple
[1:00:30] minutes here
[1:00:32] um brother Brown labors on this thought
[1:00:34] being saved is accepting Christ's
[1:00:37] leadership
[1:00:38] that's just a just a summary of it you
[1:00:40] know when we repent of our sins we
[1:00:42] confess our sins except Jesus Christ as
[1:00:44] Savior
[1:00:45] our sins are thrown the sea of
[1:00:48] forgetfulness what we've really done is
[1:00:49] accepted the leadership of the Holy
[1:00:51] Spirit
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:54] well Brian said Moses chose to go with
[1:00:55] that group instead of being called the
[1:00:57] king son look at that see because he was
[1:00:58] he's seen the end time see that rich
[1:01:00] young man but he's seen Jesus like we
[1:01:03] have see him in a vision that the end
[1:01:05] time is what is going to pay
[1:01:07] now he accepted Christ's leadership and
[1:01:10] Moses esteemed the reproach greater
[1:01:12] Treasures
[1:01:13] so Chris just got saved a couple months
[1:01:15] ago God bless him amen he chose Christ
[1:01:18] leadership
[1:01:20] rather than his moms or his dads oh no
[1:01:22] he we appreciate all the human
[1:01:24] leadership
[1:01:25] But ultimately somebody's leading you
[1:01:27] right it's either me the devil or it's
[1:01:29] going to be Christ and Chris accepted
[1:01:31] Christ's leadership praise God what a
[1:01:34] blessing amen hallelujah
[1:01:36] and we'd rather go through we'd rather
[1:01:38] go through the suffering of being a
[1:01:40] Christian than enjoy pleasures of sin
[1:01:42] for a season that ultimately lead to
[1:01:44] death
[1:01:45] and destruction in God's Wrath we want
[1:01:47] God's mercy not God's Wrath Hallelujah
[1:01:52] so salvation is choosing the leadership
[1:01:53] of Christ Joshua is a godsend prophet
[1:01:56] and he knew the promises of God so he
[1:01:58] waited for them he waited for a
[1:01:59] clear-cut decision from God and when the
[1:02:00] time came to move God placed a full
[1:02:02] leadership in Joshua's hands because he
[1:02:04] stayed with the word
[1:02:06] God could trust Joshua but not the other
[1:02:08] so it will repeat in this end day the
[1:02:10] same problem the same pressures
[1:02:12] see God's leaders they Faithfully obey
[1:02:14] the word they stay with the word of God
[1:02:17] Hallelujah if it says it in here then
[1:02:19] we've got to stay with it praise God
[1:02:22] we've got to stay with the word of God
[1:02:23] that's how you know a real leader a real
[1:02:25] leader will stay with the scripture and
[1:02:27] not with their own human opinion
[1:02:29] right
[1:02:31] now we know Bishops or pastors they must
[1:02:34] be blameless
[1:02:36] see they have to say with with the word
[1:02:37] so much that people see them as
[1:02:39] blameless
[1:02:41] there there's so much under the
[1:02:43] leadership of Christ that you can't put
[1:02:45] a finger on their life and blame them
[1:02:46] for something
[1:02:48] see and God don't ask you to file a
[1:02:50] leader that's not blame us God asks you
[1:02:51] to follow somebody who's Faithfully
[1:02:53] following Christ
[1:02:55] I love this uh Nehemiah said I gave my
[1:02:58] brother Hannah Hannah and I and hananiah
[1:03:02] the ruler of the palace charged over
[1:03:03] Jerusalem why did you do that Nehemiah
[1:03:05] because he was a faithful man
[1:03:08] and he feared God above many praise God
[1:03:12] remember we preached on that a few
[1:03:13] months ago the fear of the Lord
[1:03:14] the fear of the Lord is everything the
[1:03:16] fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life
[1:03:17] the fear of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:03:19] of praise God the fear of the Lord is
[1:03:21] that apart from Evil praise God it's the
[1:03:23] beginning of wisdom praise God and Jesus
[1:03:25] was anointed with this with the fear of
[1:03:27] the Lord the Bible said he was quick in
[1:03:29] the fear of the Lord hallelujah
[1:03:31] so being a leader is obeying and you
[1:03:33] obey by being fearful of the Lord being
[1:03:36] respectful of the Lord recognizing his
[1:03:37] presence knowing that his promises are
[1:03:39] true he's going to keep his word
[1:03:41] hallelujah
[1:03:43] we want faithful leaders who obey the
[1:03:46] word of God
[1:03:47] they stay with the word because they
[1:03:49] fear the lord more than man
[1:03:54] that's why I don't care what people say
[1:03:55] brother Jesse believes the messenger
[1:03:57] brother Jesse don't believe the message
[1:03:58] I don't care the message is God's word
[1:04:00] and I believe God's word I believe the
[1:04:02] message I don't believe your opinion of
[1:04:04] the message
[1:04:05] right
[1:04:06] so I don't care what anybody says I know
[1:04:08] in my life I know how I live and I want
[1:04:10] to be a faithful like these leaders I
[1:04:12] want to be blameless I want to stand on
[1:04:14] God's word praise God I want to say what
[1:04:16] the spirit tells me to say praise God
[1:04:17] and how do I know it'll be lined up with
[1:04:19] God's word
[1:04:21] how you know it'll line up with God's
[1:04:22] word
[1:04:24] there's my hour so let me bring this
[1:04:26] down here
[1:04:27] yeah I'm just uh let's see
[1:04:30] I'm just going to skip ahead let me just
[1:04:31] close to this let me give me five give
[1:04:33] me five minutes to close here
[1:04:35] my wife's like yeah right
[1:04:38] I want to just start getting into
[1:04:39] Solomon because I had this request
[1:04:40] somebody requested I look at Solomon's
[1:04:42] life and I've I just preach on David's
[1:04:43] lifestyle I'd like to look a little more
[1:04:45] or David's uh
[1:04:46] uh David's dancing and so forth like
[1:04:49] that a little more David and the Ark
[1:04:50] returning and so I wanted to get into
[1:04:51] Solomon as well but let's look at
[1:04:53] Solomon's leadership now Church look at
[1:04:55] him he was born in the leadership
[1:04:56] position most of us are not going to be
[1:04:58] born like that
[1:04:59] he's born into it like I'm going to be
[1:05:01] king there's just no I don't have a
[1:05:03] choice
[1:05:04] I've got to make decisions over millions
[1:05:07] of people most of us are not born there
[1:05:09] how many can say thank God I'm not born
[1:05:10] under that right brother I said don't
[1:05:12] you ever wish you were a prophet right
[1:05:13] and we we wouldn't wish that right
[1:05:15] because they have so much responsibility
[1:05:18] right and then suffering look at
[1:05:19] Jeremiah suffering look at Isaiah's
[1:05:20] suffering
[1:05:22] most of them were killed right most of
[1:05:23] them were murdered martyred
[1:05:25] look at Paul look at I mean being a
[1:05:27] prophet not a glamorous thing at all
[1:05:32] to see Solomon was born in this he had
[1:05:34] no choice
[1:05:36] I'll get your Bibles ready I'm gonna
[1:05:37] we're just gonna read a few scriptures
[1:05:38] here as we close so Solomon had to trust
[1:05:41] his father's leading about his life's
[1:05:43] purpose now look church he don't even
[1:05:44] have a choice about what he's supposed
[1:05:46] to do
[1:05:47] now he really did but
[1:05:49] you know it was already laid out Solomon
[1:05:51] you were born your beloved your name
[1:05:52] means beloved your love of God God loves
[1:05:54] you but God is calling you to build a
[1:05:56] house
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:01] the Sea church that's how we are too you
[1:06:02] know
[1:06:04] we have a choice we can either do God's
[1:06:06] will or we cannot do God's will Solomon
[1:06:08] could have said well I want to do
[1:06:09] something else I don't really want to
[1:06:10] build a house I want to I want to dig a
[1:06:12] a channel I want to build boats or
[1:06:15] something he could he could've done
[1:06:16] anything he wanted to do
[1:06:18] but it was already kind of set up like
[1:06:19] this is what Dad said to do looks like
[1:06:22] God's leading this way and he had a
[1:06:23] choice
[1:06:24] what was he going to be led by
[1:06:27] all right so do we
[1:06:28] we have a choice in fact it's already
[1:06:30] been laying out too the word of God's
[1:06:32] already been laying out for our lives
[1:06:34] we just have to accept the word of God
[1:06:38] and so see we've got to trust our
[1:06:40] Heavenly father's leadership about our
[1:06:42] purpose in life
[1:06:44] praise God
[1:06:45] so this is the main thing I just want to
[1:06:47] end with this because this is what I'm
[1:06:48] going to start with looking at Solomon's
[1:06:49] life here the first thing to find for
[1:06:51] Solomon was to find the vision or you
[1:06:54] could say or find the direction or find
[1:06:56] the Revelation for his life
[1:06:59] right and at first Chronicles 28 11.
[1:07:01] let's turn there
[1:07:05] First Chronicles 28 11. just a simple
[1:07:07] thought here this morning have you been
[1:07:08] blessed today
[1:07:10] all right praise God that's
[1:07:12] good to hear
[1:07:14] First Chronicles 28 11.
[1:07:19] then David gave to Solomon his son the
[1:07:21] pattern of the porch now look
[1:07:23] he got it from who from his dad
[1:07:26] his dad already had the blueprints laid
[1:07:28] out
[1:07:30] on the porch the houses thereof and of
[1:07:32] the treasuries thereof and the upper
[1:07:33] chambers thereof and the inner parlors
[1:07:35] thereof and the place of The Mercy Seat
[1:07:37] look at that
[1:07:39] there's the porch the houses the
[1:07:41] treasuries The upper chambers parlors
[1:07:44] and The Mercy Seat
[1:07:47] look at verse 12 and the pattern of all
[1:07:49] that he had by the spirit see where did
[1:07:51] David get all these things from the
[1:07:52] spirit
[1:07:55] and of the Courts of the house of the
[1:07:57] Lord the chambers round about the
[1:07:58] treasury of the house of God and the
[1:07:59] treasuries of the dedicated things
[1:08:01] there's ten things right there
[1:08:04] this was a detailed pattern
[1:08:07] samica said wow this is overwhelming or
[1:08:09] he could have said well if God called me
[1:08:11] to it if God birthed me here God knew
[1:08:13] what he's doing and I'll overcome by
[1:08:15] God's grace
[1:08:16] if God brought me to this God will bring
[1:08:18] me through this praise God
[1:08:21] verse 12 we read that verse 18.
[1:08:24] and for the altar of incense refined go
[1:08:26] by way and go for the pattern of The
[1:08:28] Chariot of the cherubims and the spread
[1:08:30] and that spread out their wings and
[1:08:32] covered the Ark of the Covenant of the
[1:08:34] Lord again the word pattern so there's
[1:08:36] the holiest of holies right
[1:08:38] and verse 19.
[1:08:40] and all this said David the Lord made me
[1:08:42] understand in writing by his hand upon
[1:08:45] me well look at that wow the Lord was
[1:08:47] moving my my pen the Lord moved me to
[1:08:49] draw this out the Lord did all this
[1:08:52] designing even all the works of this
[1:08:55] pattern
[1:08:56] so where do leaders how do they know
[1:08:58] what to do whether you're going to build
[1:09:00] something whether they're going to write
[1:09:01] something write a music or make a
[1:09:03] YouTube video or write a book whatever
[1:09:05] gonna do where do you find it you got to
[1:09:07] find inspiration you got to find the
[1:09:09] vision first from the pattern that you
[1:09:11] receive from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:14] you've got to find the pattern of your
[1:09:15] life the vision of your life has to come
[1:09:18] from Heaven first
[1:09:20] praise God that's what Solomon received
[1:09:22] he received it from his father he had to
[1:09:24] trust that his father had the right
[1:09:25] pattern how do you know because his
[1:09:27] father was a man after God's Own Heart
[1:09:29] hallelujah thank God despite his
[1:09:32] mistakes church and the church said
[1:09:34] despite murder adultery numbering the
[1:09:36] people just by those mistakes he still
[1:09:37] to trust he was still a man after God's
[1:09:39] Own Heart how do you know because he
[1:09:41] repented of that praise God
[1:09:43] he didn't do that again
[1:09:47] church God will always make the vision
[1:09:48] plain
[1:09:49] so Simon couldn't say well Lord I don't
[1:09:51] know what you to do or I don't know what
[1:09:53] I'm supposed to do God made it plain for
[1:09:55] Solomon
[1:09:56] to be this great leader the wisest
[1:09:59] leader now I'd still say maybe John the
[1:10:00] Baptist was wiser because of what Jesus
[1:10:02] said but we get these sayings among
[1:10:04] ourselves you know Solomon was the
[1:10:05] wisest of all time well he wasn't wiser
[1:10:06] than Jesus right
[1:10:09] and he wasn't as great as a man as John
[1:10:10] the Baptist
[1:10:12] John the Baptist was greater than all of
[1:10:13] them
[1:10:15] so I just want to you know try to be
[1:10:16] balanced but see God will make it so
[1:10:19] plain that we are without excuse
[1:10:22] Paul said in remember in Romans 2 16 in
[1:10:25] that day God shall judge every seeker of
[1:10:27] man's Hearts according to my gospel
[1:10:29] every person here every person uh over
[1:10:32] there watching the playoff game the
[1:10:33] football game every person at the at the
[1:10:35] restaurant every person at Applebee's
[1:10:36] every person at Walmart right now will
[1:10:38] be judged by the same pattern
[1:10:40] Paul's Epistles
[1:10:43] and God always makes it plain go to
[1:10:45] habakkuk too this is just such a
[1:10:46] glorious scripture
[1:10:53] habakkuk Zephaniah
[1:10:56] Hagia and Zechariah
[1:11:11] there it is wow
[1:11:13] Hallelujah Abacus 2 1-3 I will stand
[1:11:17] upon my watch and set me upon the tower
[1:11:19] and will watch to see what he will say
[1:11:21] unto me and what I shall answer when I
[1:11:23] am reproved he knew he's going to be
[1:11:24] corrected if you know chapter one he was
[1:11:25] rebuking God he was mad at God and then
[1:11:28] God rebuked him
[1:11:29] verse two and the Lord answered me and
[1:11:31] said write the vision and make it plain
[1:11:33] upon tables that he may run that readeth
[1:11:35] it
[1:11:37] so it had to be so plain a man could
[1:11:39] look at it understand it and then go run
[1:11:41] with that message
[1:11:43] right for the vision is yet for an
[1:11:45] appointed time but at the end it shall
[1:11:47] speak and not lie though what Terry wait
[1:11:49] for it because it will surely come it
[1:11:51] will not tear it of course this is
[1:11:52] referring to Israel but we can look at
[1:11:54] this and we can see God's pattern in
[1:11:56] this God always gives a word so we can
[1:11:59] run the race in Hebrews 12 by laying
[1:12:02] aside every sin that so doth easily
[1:12:04] beset us praise God man it's so plain
[1:12:09] right love the Lord your God with all
[1:12:10] your heart you can summarize in so many
[1:12:12] ways love God with all your heart and
[1:12:13] love your neighbors yourself
[1:12:15] or follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:12:17] Spirit be led by Christ every single day
[1:12:19] he'll lead you to righteousness I mean
[1:12:20] we can sum it up in so many ways but the
[1:12:22] point is first we must have the
[1:12:24] revelation
[1:12:26] and God makes it so plain Proverbs 29 18
[1:12:28] we don't have to read it but he says
[1:12:30] without a vision the people perish
[1:12:33] Solomon would have perished in this
[1:12:34] ability to build a temple if he had not
[1:12:36] received the vision and the instruction
[1:12:38] from his father David but thank God God
[1:12:40] was faithful if God calls you to do
[1:12:42] anything he's going to supply you with
[1:12:43] everything you have need of to finish
[1:12:46] the work and to please God hallelujah
[1:12:50] Paul made the vision plain too his whole
[1:12:53] life was a pattern in first Timothy 1 16
[1:12:55] I'm going to read that
[1:12:56] this is the portion
[1:12:58] where he said I was a blasphemer but I
[1:13:00] did it ignorantly
[1:13:02] that's why God can forgive me
[1:13:04] if I blaspheme before I became a
[1:13:06] Christian God can forgive each one of us
[1:13:09] how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy
[1:13:11] that in me first Jesus Christ might show
[1:13:13] forth all long-suffering for a pattern
[1:13:15] to them which should hear after believe
[1:13:18] on him to everlasting life so God was
[1:13:21] very long-suffering to say Paul that's a
[1:13:23] pattern God will be long-suffering with
[1:13:25] you
[1:13:26] God's not going to give up on you God's
[1:13:29] patient with you he's going to save you
[1:13:31] he's going to bring your life to a
[1:13:33] complete estate he's going to make your
[1:13:35] life glorify him praise God as you
[1:13:38] submit to God
[1:13:39] God will make your life glorify him
[1:13:42] he's made it plain Paul made it plain by
[1:13:44] writing all those Epistles
[1:13:47] and then church our pattern our Our
[1:13:48] Lives should be a pattern of good works
[1:13:52] you should see wow this brother well he
[1:13:54] did that last week he did it again this
[1:13:55] week
[1:13:56] he was faithful last week he was
[1:13:57] faithful last month he was faithful last
[1:13:59] year look at him this year he's so she
[1:14:01] she's so faithful wow what a pattern a
[1:14:03] good works they Faithfully teach Sunday
[1:14:05] school or they Faithfully do this or
[1:14:06] they Faithfully
[1:14:09] it's a pattern of good works
[1:14:12] see that's how you know you've received
[1:14:13] the vision from Heaven because your life
[1:14:15] is a pattern Hallelujah your life is an
[1:14:17] expression of that Vision praise God
[1:14:19] people can see the pattern in your life
[1:14:22] and they know you've seen God's pattern
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:25] I'm not quite saying it right but you
[1:14:27] understand Hallelujah your life gives a
[1:14:29] pattern your life expresses the pattern
[1:14:31] of the master Hallelujah
[1:14:35] so brother Branham gave us that see the
[1:14:37] pattern of Paul's gospel was laid out to
[1:14:40] us by Brother Branham like I said
[1:14:41] Charles Barnum I got to have tongues in
[1:14:43] the third step brother man come in and
[1:14:44] said brother said that's my message of
[1:14:46] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:14:48] the Holy Ghost that Jesus Christ is the
[1:14:51] same yesterday today and forever brother
[1:14:54] said the Holy Ghost will only point you
[1:14:56] to the word so the pattern of today is
[1:14:58] point us to the word back to the word I
[1:15:00] got a problem go back to the word I've
[1:15:02] got struggles back to the word I'm sick
[1:15:04] go back to the word everything's back to
[1:15:06] the word that's the pattern we have
[1:15:07] Paul's gospel will meet all of our needs
[1:15:10] praise God because it was Christ
[1:15:12] Revelation to us hallelujah
[1:15:15] and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:15:16] against this Revelation this pattern
[1:15:19] this direction
[1:15:21] so what do we want to do we want to be
[1:15:22] careful Builders right
[1:15:24] the Bible says wisdom hath builded her
[1:15:26] house
[1:15:28] right
[1:15:30] wisdom has builded the house so these
[1:15:32] are scriptures wisdom builds the house I
[1:15:34] think about sisters how they build the
[1:15:36] atmosphere of the house while the the
[1:15:38] husband's away working
[1:15:40] they build the atmosphere of the home
[1:15:42] right of course speaking of Solomon he
[1:15:47] was building a house of God
[1:15:48] and then Paul said let every preacher be
[1:15:51] careful how he builds upon the
[1:15:52] foundation that he laid
[1:15:55] see we're all building something
[1:15:58] right and we got to build by the wisdom
[1:16:00] of the Holy Ghost this is the last verse
[1:16:02] go to First Kings 3. I'm closing with
[1:16:05] this first king three this is my clothes
[1:16:08] First Kings 3.
[1:16:10] so hard just getting these places you
[1:16:12] know you just want to say in the
[1:16:13] presence of God first Kings 3 verse 3.
[1:16:17] this is the prayer God loved
[1:16:23] Lord you've called me to be a leader
[1:16:26] of the church that's my prayer
[1:16:28] for the husbands Lord you've called me
[1:16:30] to be a leader of my wife and children
[1:16:33] sisters could say Lord you call me to be
[1:16:35] a leader of my home and the children and
[1:16:36] guiding the house
[1:16:40] teenagers can say you've called me to be
[1:16:42] a leader of my younger younger siblings
[1:16:44] right
[1:16:46] you call me to be leader of my other
[1:16:47] friends who are teenagers
[1:16:53] First Kings 3 3.
[1:16:55] let's remember today this beautiful
[1:16:56] prayer
[1:17:00] church if you need to you can pray this
[1:17:02] prayer yourself
[1:17:04] God loves a prayer like this
[1:17:08] and Solomon loved the Lord how many love
[1:17:10] the Lord today
[1:17:11] and he walked in the statutes of David's
[1:17:13] father no of course not not his whole
[1:17:14] life
[1:17:15] at this time he was walking he was
[1:17:17] keeping the commands
[1:17:19] only he sacrificed and burned incense in
[1:17:22] high places and the King went to gibeon
[1:17:24] remember we looked at that how the
[1:17:25] sacrifices were in gibeon but David had
[1:17:27] the holy place in holiest in Jerusalem
[1:17:30] so he went to giving the sacrifice there
[1:17:32] for that was the great high place a
[1:17:34] thousand word offerings that Solomon
[1:17:35] offer upon that altar
[1:17:37] so he wasn't a stingy giver when it come
[1:17:38] to ties and offerings
[1:17:41] Hallelujah
[1:17:45] and in gibeon the Lord appeared to
[1:17:46] Solomon in a Dream by night and God said
[1:17:48] ask what I should give you now notice
[1:17:50] God comes to him after his sacrifice of
[1:17:52] praise
[1:17:53] that's when God will come to you
[1:17:55] and look so there it is Solomon Drew
[1:17:58] nigh unto God and so God Drew nigh unto
[1:18:00] him
[1:18:01] see he had to leave where he lived he
[1:18:04] had to leave where that was he had to go
[1:18:06] out to meet God he had to make great
[1:18:07] sacrifices and but that's where he met
[1:18:09] God
[1:18:16] ask what I shall give you
[1:18:19] what a question
[1:18:21] what do you want Solomon
[1:18:23] what the Holy Spirit was here today and
[1:18:24] said what do you want brother Chris
[1:18:27] now before you answer pray about it
[1:18:29] Hallelujah
[1:18:32] sister Beatrice what do you want what
[1:18:34] the Holy Spirit was here today it
[1:18:35] reminds us of brother and how do you
[1:18:37] write doesn't it
[1:18:38] another reminder for that
[1:18:41] whatever you say you'll have it
[1:18:43] God did the same thing see he's the same
[1:18:45] yesterday today and forever
[1:18:48] ask whatever you want
[1:18:51] I'll give you all your hair back
[1:18:54] if it's the bald man you know whatever
[1:18:56] you want I'll give it back
[1:18:57] the biggest muscles the longest life
[1:19:00] ask whatever you want
[1:19:03] and see if it isn't given to you right
[1:19:04] now
[1:19:06] right verse 6 and Solomon said thou has
[1:19:09] showed unto thy servant David my father
[1:19:10] great Mercy see he saw God's forgiveness
[1:19:13] in his life according as he has walked
[1:19:15] before thee in truth and in
[1:19:17] righteousness and uprightness of heart
[1:19:18] with thee and thou has kept for him this
[1:19:21] great kindness that thou has given him a
[1:19:23] son to sit on his throne as it is this
[1:19:26] day look at this just to stop for a
[1:19:28] moment look how kind God was to a
[1:19:30] murderer
[1:19:33] look how kind God was to an adulterer
[1:19:37] look how kind God is in just in general
[1:19:41] Church don't ever think that God's not
[1:19:42] going to be kind to you
[1:19:44] just repent of your sins
[1:19:46] just come back to Christ
[1:19:48] remember he's going to throw all that in
[1:19:50] the sea of forgetfulness yes there's
[1:19:51] consequences on this side but I'll say
[1:19:53] like this there's really no consequences
[1:19:54] on that side praise God
[1:19:57] he said God you are still kind to my
[1:19:59] father
[1:20:00] your kindness never left him
[1:20:05] Hallelujah verse seven and now oh Lord
[1:20:07] my God thouest made thy servant King
[1:20:09] instead of David my father and I am but
[1:20:11] a little child I know not how to go out
[1:20:14] or to come and look at the humility in
[1:20:16] this prayer you've been kind to my dad
[1:20:18] your kindness never left my dad and I'm
[1:20:20] just a child I'm a nobody
[1:20:22] at church we can all pray that can't we
[1:20:25] we're just a tiny little church where
[1:20:26] nobody we're not a big Message Church
[1:20:28] we're not a mega church we're nobody
[1:20:30] but that's who God can work with
[1:20:33] yes God can work with big churches too
[1:20:35] I'm not saying he can't but I'm just
[1:20:36] saying let's let's relate to the
[1:20:37] humility of this prayer
[1:20:39] let's see how we can be humble today
[1:20:43] and thy servant is in the midst of thy
[1:20:44] people which thou has chosen a great
[1:20:46] people that cannot be numbered nor
[1:20:47] counted for multitude give therefore thy
[1:20:50] servant an understanding heart to judge
[1:20:52] thy people that I may discern between
[1:20:53] good and bad for who is able to judge
[1:20:56] this so great of people
[1:20:58] and the speech pleased the Lord
[1:21:01] that Solomon had asked this thing
[1:21:05] this is a prayer God loves
