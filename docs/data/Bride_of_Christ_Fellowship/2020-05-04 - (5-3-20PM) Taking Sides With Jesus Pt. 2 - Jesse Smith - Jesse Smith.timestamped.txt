[27:11] let's uh read our let's start with our
[27:12] memory verse and isaiah 12
[27:15] verse 2. we'll read another text here by
[27:19] god's grace
[27:42] i didn't know if it was too hot uh if
[27:44] it's does anyone
[27:45] want the air on does anybody want to air

[27:50] conditioning okay
[27:52] do you know how to do it man thank you
[27:55] thank you sir appreciate that
[27:57] i don't know whether to put on the air
[27:58] or not so sorry sometimes people you
[28:00] know some people like it hot some people
[28:01] like it cold
[28:03] i try to find the middle of the road
[28:04] isaiah 12
[28:08] oh let's read two to five you know six
[28:09] is a b this is a really short short
[28:11] chapter but look at verse six two cry
[28:12] out and shout thou inhabitant of zion
[28:16] you know zionist you know new jerusalem
[28:17] is called mount zion in a
[28:19] spiritual sense and it's very fitting to
[28:21] the bride
[28:22] for great is the holy one of israel in
[28:24] the midst of thee
[28:26] in other words we're supposed to shout
[28:28] because jesus is so great
[28:31] oh we're shouting for eternity praise
[28:33] god
[28:34] jesus christ amen the same yesterday
[28:36] today and forever
[28:38] all right let's read verse two to five
[28:40] here let's begin on three one
[28:42] two 3 behold god is my salvation
[28:47] i will trust and not be afraid for the
[28:50] lord jehovah
[28:51] is my strength and my song he
[28:54] also has become my salvation
[28:58] therefore with joy shall ye draw water
[29:01] out of the wells of salvation and
[29:04] in that day shall ye say praise the lord
[29:07] call upon his name declare his doings
[29:10] among the people
[29:12] make mention that his name is exalted
[29:16] sing unto the lord for he hath done
[29:18] excellent things
[29:20] this is known in all the earth praise
[29:22] god let's go to acts
[29:23] 15 we'll just read one verse there acts
[29:38] 15.
[29:41] uh lord willing tonight i just read
[29:43] verse two
[29:47] uh we'll be looking more at uh taking
[29:49] sides with jesus um
[29:51] but this scripture is important here for
[29:53] verse two i'll just read it because it's
[29:54] a little bit longer
[29:55] when therefore paul and barnabas had no
[29:57] small dissension
[29:59] and disputation with them the the men
[30:02] that were preaching
[30:03] uh circumcision was required for
[30:06] salvation
[30:08] so paul and barnabas had a lot of
[30:09] arguments with them
[30:11] and certain over of them should go up to
[30:15] jerusalem unto the apostles and elders
[30:17] about this question praise god
[30:21] so how should the church act today if
[30:23] the church then
[30:25] had trouble and all got together to
[30:27] solve problems how should the church act
[30:28] today the same way
[30:29] by god's grace same way because it's the
[30:31] same church
[30:33] let's have a word of prayer if you ever
[30:34] need on your heart just make it known
[30:35] unto god here
[30:38] dear heavenly father we love you we
[30:39] thank you we come into your presence
[30:40] lord we
[30:41] sing in worship lord as the scripture
[30:44] says we should cry out
[30:45] shout aloud for great is the holy one of
[30:48] israel in the midst of us lord jesus
[30:50] you're great
[30:51] we shout holy praise be to god in your
[30:54] presence we know you're here lord god
[30:56] you promise to be here and lord we'll
[30:58] take at your word lord so we know
[31:00] lord that you are the word and you keep
[31:02] your appointments lord god
[31:04] we ask you to dwell amongst us here
[31:05] tonight by your holy spirit
[31:07] and bless our hearts tonight with your
[31:09] presence in jesus christ's name
[31:11] and the church said amen god bless you
[31:13] being seated
[31:14] i'll try to keep it brief here tonight
[31:15] by god's grace we'll try to just preach
[31:17] about 45 minutes
[31:18] or hour
[31:24] you know i didn't i want to finish this
[31:26] text that i
[31:27] was reading with this brother
[31:31] uh from texas i kept reading it and then
[31:33] i saw oh i'd like to share that too
[31:35] because uh i was reminded of a quote how
[31:37] many remember the quote where brother
[31:38] branham said
[31:39] you know if you're having trouble with
[31:40] your wife you know there's a man that
[31:42] asked
[31:42] brother brandon i'm having trouble with
[31:44] my wife and
[31:46] she doesn't believe the message like we
[31:47] do he said i try to rebuke that spirit
[31:50] he said but it's not going anywhere i
[31:51] remember that quote
[31:52] brother ram said why don't you buy her a
[31:54] box of chocolates
[31:56] instead of rebuking her and you know
[31:59] calling her a devil
[32:00] he said why don't you buy a box of
[32:02] chocolates and he said it actually
[32:04] happened and it
[32:05] and it restored their marriage he went
[32:07] and bought chocolates
[32:08] and she believed after that
[32:11] and so the reason i say that is because
[32:14] chocolates don't cast out devils
[32:19] it's the love behind it amen
[32:22] and the same was true with like i was
[32:24] saying this morning i just called the
[32:25] brother
[32:26] i did we talked maybe for an hour maybe
[32:27] an hour
[32:30] he says it seems all i needed was a kind
[32:33] word
[32:34] an encouragement from a brother as a
[32:36] catalyst to move forward
[32:38] which i'm doing now and you provided it
[32:42] he said and now i have no more kind of
[32:44] condemnation's begun to leave me
[32:46] i brought a i have a peace i've been
[32:48] longing for
[32:51] oh thank you lord it's not the call
[32:53] right it's not the call
[32:55] it's not the text that moves demons it's
[32:58] the love behind it
[32:59] praise god so i just want to express
[33:02] that because it reminded me of this
[33:03] quote
[33:04] where brother ram said a box of
[33:05] chocolates caused his wife to repent you
[33:08] know and then believe the message
[33:10] so it wasn't chocolates it was love and
[33:13] love but
[33:13] i said divine love casts out all demons
[33:15] praise god it's divine love
[33:19] so i hope that's a blessing there uh by
[33:20] god's grace
[33:23] okay
[33:26] now uh tonight i guess i want to be
[33:28] brief um i know we got i got to get my
[33:30] even i
[33:30] even i got to get my body back in the
[33:32] mode of preaching hard twice on a sunday
[33:35] it's been nice you know it's kind of
[33:36] been nice at home you know on a sunday
[33:37] we can just
[33:38] go do the live stream and then we're
[33:40] done you know we don't have to drive
[33:41] home
[33:43] but uh i believe in this i believe it's
[33:45] the right thing to gather together more
[33:47] as we see that day approaching and
[33:50] worshiping the lord in this manner
[33:52] there's nobody else i'd rather be with
[33:53] than god's people that is true
[33:55] i i'd much oh i love like i said i
[33:58] you know like the scripture says i'd
[33:59] rather be a doorkeeper in the house of
[34:01] lord
[34:02] uh one day than to dwell in the tents
[34:05] with the wicked
[34:06] i love i love coming to church i love
[34:09] worshiping and
[34:10] praising god and god has blessed us with
[34:12] these musician gifts remember
[34:14] bang just remember a few years ago we
[34:15] didn't have any of this man
[34:18] maybe a couple of years 10 12 years ago
[34:20] didn't have all this
[34:22] we're so blessed and so i just love to
[34:24] raise my hands and sing and
[34:26] worship it's such a great time to be in
[34:29] the house of lord today
[34:30] so i'll just start with that just it's
[34:32] love that removes
[34:34] every uh demon power
[34:38] so let's get now i want to get back to
[34:40] these quotes like i said i'm going to be
[34:41] going back to acts 15.
[34:44] and i got a few more scriptures separate
[34:46] scriptures that kind of came to me while
[34:48] i was just sitting back there so i wrote
[34:49] them down real quick
[34:51] um so we ended this morning by showing
[34:55] how brother branham said
[34:56] brother neville just continue on and now
[34:59] brother ram goes into his ministry
[35:01] in this like first half of the sermon he
[35:04] says there's four things that could
[35:06] happen to him one of them he could die
[35:08] one of them could be he's going off the
[35:10] scene and another prophet is going to
[35:11] rise on the scene
[35:12] he's not sure he said it could be him
[35:15] that steps into the ministry which
[35:16] that's what happened
[35:17] he came into the third poll and there
[35:19] was something else i can't quite
[35:20] remember
[35:21] what he said but he said uh but the
[35:24] church he said talk about the rapture
[35:25] now the church will go home
[35:28] he said if that would take place
[35:29] tomorrow it doesn't hinder us from
[35:31] keeping on today
[35:33] let's make today count so i just want to
[35:36] reiterate that with the church we should
[35:38] make every day
[35:39] count amen for jesus christ because we
[35:41] never know
[35:42] when it will be a chance wouldn't it be
[35:44] a day that would be a red letter day
[35:47] it'll be a special day a day that will
[35:50] uh
[35:51] our testimony one of our prayers will
[35:53] actually come to pass
[35:54] we never know when that day will be so
[35:57] we want to be faithful
[35:59] prepared for that day praise god and we
[36:02] know
[36:02] that god is watching all of our efforts
[36:06] i'm going to read this real quick if
[36:07] you've got your bible revelation i
[36:08] believe chapter 2
[36:10] um yeah i believe it's uh
[36:13] 19 yeah
[36:17] revelation 219 remember this is the
[36:18] great revelation it came to me about
[36:20] three or four years ago
[36:21] when i was preaching and brother i
[36:22] remember brother john was in the back on
[36:23] a wednesday night
[36:25] and this revelation just came to me from
[36:27] the church age book
[36:30] brother branham said the secret to
[36:32] christianity
[36:34] is increasing your love for god
[36:37] increasing your works for god your
[36:40] service for god
[36:41] he said satan satan's whole battle is
[36:43] going to be trying to get us to
[36:45] to decrease our service for god he said
[36:48] but a christian when he goes through a
[36:49] trial
[36:50] he doesn't quit uh he looks up and says
[36:52] lord
[36:53] thank you help me to get through this
[36:55] trial i'll keep
[36:56] i'll increase my love for you instead of
[36:59] decrease i'll
[37:00] increase it and so this scripture
[37:03] is that great revelation because
[37:06] remember i was talking about how paul
[37:07] could have given up what if paul would
[37:09] have gave up
[37:10] what if all these brothers would have
[37:11] gave up he said make every day count
[37:13] verse 19
[37:14] i know thy works and charity and service
[37:17] and faith
[37:18] and thy patience and thy work so he
[37:21] starts with works and he goes back to
[37:22] works
[37:23] and the last to be more than the first
[37:27] so see at the end of their life these
[37:30] old saints now were serving god better
[37:32] at the end
[37:33] than the beginning and i can say amen to
[37:35] that i can see that in my life
[37:37] i'm serving god with more faithfulness
[37:39] than even at the beginning
[37:41] praise god and so that brother says is
[37:44] the secret to christianity
[37:47] continue your service in the midst of
[37:49] trial satan just wants you to quit
[37:51] or decrease like like today
[37:53] jeffersonville
[37:54] trying to get us to decrease our
[37:55] preaching but the bible said
[37:57] increase it praise god i like how jesus
[37:59] says i know
[38:01] he said i know what you're going through
[38:04] he says he's been there i know your
[38:06] works jesus knows what it's like to
[38:08] serve jesus knows what it's like to have
[38:10] faith jesus knows what it's like to have
[38:13] persecution and trials and obstacles but
[38:16] ram said remember he was
[38:17] constantly badgered by the pharisees
[38:20] he said but brother he said but jesus
[38:22] took god's word and he learned to live
[38:24] above the criticism
[38:26] i had a brother text me yesterday from
[38:28] arkansas and he said brother he said one
[38:30] of my friends shared your video
[38:32] and he said man it's getting criticized
[38:33] i said that's a good sign
[38:35] i said i'm glad about that tell them to
[38:37] keep posting it
[38:39] if i was if i was a real believer i
[38:40] should be criticized right
[38:43] i should expect it and that's what i
[38:45] expecting more of it this week i'm gonna
[38:46] tomorrow i'm gonna film the token a
[38:49] video uh brother ram said
[38:50] the holy ghost is the token because
[38:52] jeffersonville is saying it's the tapes
[38:55] the tape is a token no it's not brother
[38:58] ram said it's the holy spirit
[39:00] it's the eternal token so they say the
[39:02] tape is the token then they say being a
[39:04] tape church is the token
[39:07] and all they've done church is they've
[39:09] done the same thing pentecost did when
[39:10] they
[39:11] made tongues the evidence they've made a
[39:13] man-made evidence that you can
[39:15] impersonate
[39:16] but the token is the same as it was in
[39:18] the day of pentecost amen
[39:20] god's spirit living in the soul of
[39:21] mankind amen
[39:24] so see it's got to be done it's
[39:25] someone's brother bam said uh
[39:28] he said uh he said if all i can do is
[39:30] put my voice against it he said i'll put
[39:32] my voice against it for that day
[39:34] because the preachers will say well you
[39:36] shouldn't be doing it but ram said
[39:38] brother bram said a man i think it might
[39:40] have been billy graham or oral roberts
[39:41] walked up and said let me lay my hands
[39:43] on you
[39:43] that you'll stop rebuking those women
[39:45] about their hair and makeup
[39:47] and brother ram said no you're not going
[39:49] to lay hands on me about that he then
[39:50] the man said it's not your business
[39:52] he said then whose business is it and
[39:54] that's what i say
[39:55] if other preachers aren't going to
[39:56] preach it whose business is it it's my
[39:58] business
[40:00] it just so happens i'm a nobody and
[40:01] nobody not too many people watching so
[40:04] i can do it by god's grace if nobody
[40:06] else is going to
[40:07] correct that person i'm going to correct
[40:09] them by god's grace because i'll do it
[40:11] in love
[40:12] you know church if i was wrong i want
[40:14] somebody to correct me
[40:15] right all it really is church is just
[40:18] divine love
[40:19] when you see somebody wrong you just go
[40:21] to them in love
[40:22] so really it's an evidence that you
[40:24] actually love people that are wrong
[40:26] you love them so much you don't want to
[40:28] continue to see them walking in the air
[40:30] that they're walking in praise god
[40:33] that's what it boils down to
[40:36] okay so he said make today count now
[40:40] brother ram says this you'll like this
[40:41] he said did you notice when pentecost
[40:44] fell
[40:44] those brothers were filled at pentecost
[40:46] with the holy ghost
[40:48] it wasn't hardly any time until the
[40:50] message had begun to dim down
[40:53] so see day of pentecost ah they're all
[40:55] shouting they're
[40:56] running out on the streets they're
[40:57] praising god they're you know 117
[41:00] nations
[41:01] watch it 3 000 people get saved
[41:04] but he said it wasn't very long until it
[41:06] starts dimming down
[41:10] he said then they begin to set up
[41:12] churches to hold the fort for christ
[41:15] expecting him to come so see god gives
[41:19] you god gives you an amazing start
[41:21] a powerful emotional start then you
[41:23] start going through trials
[41:26] and he said they set up and you got to
[41:27] hold the fort
[41:29] right keep the castle right don't lose
[41:31] the castle anyone ever played king on
[41:32] the mountain in here we used to play
[41:34] we'd pile up the
[41:35] the the snow and man that was we had the
[41:38] best games on the snow
[41:40] because it's slippery and you could dig
[41:42] holes in your
[41:43] your hill you know you can dig holes and
[41:45] trails in there you know
[41:47] passages and you got to hold the fort
[41:50] you got to stand at the top that's what
[41:52] brother ram says you got to
[41:54] they begin to hold the floor expecting
[41:56] christ to come
[41:57] he said that's the same thing taking
[41:58] place today if the scripture is true
[42:01] i will restore saith the lord praise god
[42:04] all that the palmer and cankworm has
[42:06] eaten
[42:07] now if that is the message and god
[42:09] forgive me i don't know
[42:10] if it is then the time is close at hand
[42:12] because the message he said is over
[42:14] in other words he thought like the
[42:16] mystery of god was finished but he
[42:17] hadn't even preached the seals yet
[42:19] so see there was more revelation to come
[42:23] church i love going through these old
[42:24] sermons because i get to hear how
[42:25] brother random changed by the end
[42:27] because brother amen i've studied so
[42:29] much at the end
[42:31] focusing on the major revelations like
[42:33] you know marriage and divorce and seals
[42:35] everything like that that you know i
[42:36] haven't spent as much time in the older
[42:38] ones
[42:38] when i go back to the older ones i see
[42:40] how much he grew
[42:41] because i got like the other ones like
[42:42] some parts would memorize you know
[42:45] like the token and all these ones so
[42:47] like when you hear the old ones like i
[42:49] know
[42:50] he taught this later
[42:53] and so it's wonderful to see how god
[42:55] could help him grow
[42:56] in his understanding he didn't
[42:59] denominate
[43:00] and just figure he was right god could
[43:02] teach him something new
[43:04] and so he learns this and he says we
[43:07] gotta
[43:07] he said you were we're doing the same
[43:09] thing today it's like we're holding
[43:11] forth
[43:11] we just gotta keep our ground praise god
[43:14] we just gotta keep our
[43:15] church open that's what we gotta do we
[43:17] gotta hold the fort amen
[43:19] don't let the devil shut it down or
[43:20] don't be discouraged just hold the fort
[43:22] keep it alive
[43:23] until jesus comes amen hallelujah praise
[43:27] god i love it
[43:29] then brother braham says all the things
[43:31] he thinks might happen to him
[43:33] uh then he gets to this thought here
[43:36] now this is important i really wanted
[43:38] everybody to hear this uh
[43:40] amen and i talked a little bit about the
[43:42] anointings i want amen to hear this here
[43:45] yeah brother bam said that he said it
[43:47] could be the end of my road it could be
[43:49] the coming of the lord it could
[43:50] be the change of the day it could be the
[43:52] coming of that mighty one
[43:54] if there is to be another one besides
[43:55] what's already come it could be that
[43:58] all those things we'd have to draw from
[43:59] it would be
[44:01] and as i stand here tonight before god
[44:03] and you brethren i don't know i couldn't
[44:04] tell you
[44:06] if i did i'd tell you or i wouldn't
[44:07] mention it bring anything up like this
[44:09] if i didn't know which way if i know
[44:12] which way the thing was going i'd say it
[44:13] but i don't know i can't tell now right
[44:15] here listen to this
[44:17] i'm going right now on meetings
[44:20] without one speck of leading
[44:25] can you imagine that a holy ghost-filled
[44:27] prophet brother amen
[44:28] he said i'm going this is july i'm sorry
[44:31] june of 1962.
[44:34] he's about what nine months away from
[44:36] opening the seals
[44:37] he said i'm going in my meetings
[44:39] traveling around without
[44:41] one speck of leading in other words the
[44:43] angel
[44:44] the angels never told him like the angel
[44:45] used to tell remember go to africa go to
[44:47] india
[44:48] the angel used to tell him but now he's
[44:50] like i don't have
[44:51] one speck of leading yet he's born again
[44:55] so see if i if i ever say that amen
[44:57] don't judge me okay
[44:59] now kai don't be discouraged if i ever
[45:00] say that i don't have that feeling like
[45:02] i don't have any leading of the lord
[45:04] because but ma'am went through that same
[45:05] thing
[45:08] there's times we feel like we don't have
[45:10] any leading
[45:11] now here's my thought about this two
[45:14] months earlier
[45:15] brother ram had that dream about store
[45:17] up the tapes
[45:18] and the dream said don't go overseas
[45:20] stay home
[45:21] and record lots of tapes
[45:24] so that's what i believe that's why he
[45:26] felt like this
[45:28] because god two months earlier had
[45:29] already shut them down and said
[45:31] stay at home make a lot of sermons store
[45:33] up a lot of sermon tapes
[45:34] so you'll have they'll have them later
[45:36] when you go on to meet the lord
[45:38] that's what i believe and i could be
[45:39] wrong on that but i just wanted to read
[45:41] that brotherham said i didn't have one
[45:43] speck of leading oh my
[45:47] praise god see i like it because he's a
[45:49] man he's like me
[45:50] praise god there's a quote later in here
[45:53] where brother branham says
[45:54] you brothers think you got it hard he
[45:56] said it's much harder on me
[45:58] he said you've got you know one church
[46:00] looking to you he said i've got
[46:01] millions of people looking for me what
[46:03] are you gonna do brother graham what's
[46:04] the word of the lord
[46:05] how are you gonna operate he said i've
[46:06] got millions of people waiting for me
[46:09] to give the next word he says a lot he
[46:11] said i've got to sweat it out a lot more
[46:13] than you do
[46:15] oh help us jesus he said i'm going
[46:18] because i don't want to sit up there i
[46:20] like to get out in the woods as well as
[46:21] anybody
[46:22] he said if i'm wrong god forgive me then
[46:24] he says three things could happen to him
[46:26] i'm not going to get into all those
[46:27] right now oh yeah he says i might go
[46:30] into evangelist might be a prophet
[46:33] now here's the next thing i want to
[46:35] notice i want to just uh
[46:37] focus on this for about half hour here
[46:42] his next thought is and i hope everybody
[46:44] can understand this i hope people are
[46:46] listening at home by god's grace because
[46:47] this is an important topic here
[46:49] especially with the tape church movement
[46:52] brother adam starts getting into the
[46:54] fivefold ministry
[46:56] and he starts saying that if you're one
[46:58] of the gifts you can't be any of the
[47:00] other
[47:01] now he later fixed that he later
[47:05] corrected that in standing in the gap
[47:07] but amen and i were talking about that
[47:08] after church
[47:10] standing in the gap is kind of like
[47:12] brother brown's confession sermon where
[47:13] he says
[47:14] i'm i have sins i have complexes and he
[47:17] said pray for me that i could overcome
[47:19] my complexes so if you want to hear a
[47:20] good sermon on that
[47:21] it's standing in the gap 63 june
[47:26] um so
[47:29] this is what we see in the in this in
[47:31] this time so
[47:32] a year earlier brother ram is convinced
[47:34] a prophet
[47:35] this is his thinking a prophet has to
[47:38] sit out in the wilderness all by himself
[47:40] and not be with anybody
[47:42] but god corrects him a year later amen
[47:45] and that's what
[47:46] uh acts 15 is all about we'll get there
[47:48] in just a moment here
[47:52] so i want to be prepared for that so let
[47:54] me read that brother man said
[47:55] i cannot go on the way i've been going
[47:58] because the peoples believe me
[48:01] many times they regard me as being a
[48:03] prophet i do not regard myself that no
[48:06] sir i do not i don't say that to be
[48:08] humble i say that to be truthful
[48:10] i do not regard myself to be a prophet
[48:13] of the lord
[48:14] i haven't that honor so what brother
[48:17] brahm is saying
[48:18] i he said real men of god don't honor
[48:21] themselves and call themselves i'm the
[48:23] prophet
[48:24] right now how many know this though the
[48:27] brother amen i don't know if you know
[48:28] this
[48:29] but there's other tapes where brother
[48:30] bam is under the anointing in the prayer
[48:31] line
[48:32] and he'll say i'm god's prophet to you
[48:36] so when the anointing is so strong there
[48:38] and the angel the lord is standing right
[48:39] there
[48:40] brother man will say if you believe it
[48:42] if he said if you believe me to be
[48:44] god's prophet and if they do though you
[48:46] know god will heal them
[48:48] because they trust god
[48:51] and so that's we got to be careful too
[48:53] you know some people
[48:54] don't like that but brother graham was
[48:56] saying like he's saying i don't have the
[48:58] honor to call myself a prophet
[49:01] but the holy ghost when they would get
[49:03] on him really strong and the angel of
[49:05] the lord standing right there
[49:06] the angel of the lord would permit him
[49:08] to say that
[49:10] oh my that stumbles a lot of people but
[49:12] doesn't stumble me i can understand that
[49:15] because you never want to feel exalted
[49:17] like look at me i'm some big buddy
[49:19] big person people need to look to me so
[49:22] to me brother
[49:23] is being very humble i have in that
[49:25] honor he said i do believe the lord has
[49:27] used me in a special way
[49:30] maybe laying a foundation for a prophet
[49:32] that will come
[49:34] now here's where it gets back but a
[49:36] prophet doesn't operate the way i
[49:38] operate
[49:39] a prophet is an evangelist an evangelist
[49:41] isn't a prophet a pastor is an
[49:43] evangelist an evangelist isn't a pastor
[49:46] and then he quotes the scripture but god
[49:47] is set in the church apostles and
[49:49] prophets and teachers and pastors and so
[49:51] forth
[49:53] okay
[49:56] now here's uh just a few thoughts on
[49:58] this
[50:00] i understand what brother branham is
[50:01] saying but let me share this here how
[50:03] many remember when
[50:03] i preach on the parable the talents how
[50:05] many remember the talents
[50:06] and how remember you can have different
[50:08] amounts of talents
[50:09] so that's how i believe that quote
[50:12] applies to the scripture
[50:16] you some people might just have one
[50:18] talent now what i mean by that
[50:19] you just might be a pastor that's all
[50:21] you will be
[50:22] you don't you're not evangelist you'll
[50:24] never do evangelist work you'll never do
[50:26] prophet work
[50:27] right you'll never do a uh teaching work
[50:31] but i believe it's scriptural and i
[50:33] showed you this morning paul was an
[50:34] apostle and a teacher
[50:37] and a prophet undoubtedly no one can
[50:39] deny that he had three at least those
[50:41] three gifts
[50:41] and i believe he had all five
[50:44] but see the parable the talents is so
[50:47] beautiful because
[50:48] the highest number of talents was five
[50:51] amen and five is grace and there's five
[50:54] preaching gifts amen
[50:57] i think god has a good sense of humor he
[50:59] hides it from the eyes of the wise and
[51:00] prudent
[51:01] reveals it unto babe such as would learn
[51:05] oh thank you jesus oh hallelujah
[51:08] so what i'm saying is that some people
[51:10] will just have one gift
[51:12] like this um well i don't want to call
[51:15] names but
[51:16] there's some people that you know they
[51:17] just they're just a teacher
[51:19] that's all they that's all they do which
[51:21] is okay they just teach god's word
[51:23] they're not a pastor
[51:24] they never prophesy things like that
[51:26] they never prophesy
[51:27] which is okay um
[51:31] and so to me that parable of five
[51:34] two or one five two one the talents
[51:38] that allows there to be this this uh
[51:42] this calling from god where you could
[51:43] have all five gifts of the holy spirit
[51:46] as far as preaching or just two or just
[51:49] one
[51:50] okay or three or four
[51:54] praise god now i see at least three in
[51:56] my life i see a pastor teacher
[51:57] evangelist
[51:59] and i've had people tell me that as well
[52:00] i've see i can see all those three
[52:02] and i told you i've twice shared two
[52:04] things that were prophetic according to
[52:06] my friend jacob
[52:08] he said two of those things i he said
[52:10] prophesied but i i wasn't trying to i
[52:12] just
[52:13] was just praying so i don't consider
[52:17] myself to have any gift of prophecy
[52:19] but i do consider those three
[52:22] and then you know with the nine gets the
[52:24] holy spirit you know brother braham said
[52:25] martin luther had all nine
[52:28] so now you have even more like you have
[52:30] these certain you have certain levels
[52:31] you know you have levels of
[52:33] responsibility five two one you have the
[52:35] different levels
[52:36] so i believe you could have the
[52:37] preaching in there plus the gifts of the
[52:39] spirit you know you could have
[52:40] you could have all this responsibility
[52:43] um but this is the quote where a lot of
[52:45] people struggle
[52:47] and let me just say this i know uh i
[52:49] know at least one pastor
[52:51] bless his heart i'm not going to say
[52:52] where he's from but i invited him to
[52:54] come preach here
[52:56] and he said brother jesse i can't preach
[52:58] there because brother ram said
[52:59] you can't be a pastor an evangelist and
[53:02] church i went to his church and he's so
[53:04] sad
[53:05] uh i can tell he's so sad he's so
[53:07] frustrated just being a pastor
[53:10] and i was just like trying to encourage
[53:12] him you know
[53:13] and i can see how that type of mindset
[53:17] you know if it's not from god it could
[53:19] it could be a discouragement
[53:20] it could limit you when god wants to use
[53:22] you in a in a greater way
[53:25] i can clearly see that
[53:28] now do i believe there's times where you
[53:31] could be more focused on one another yes
[53:33] that's why i haven't gone on any
[53:34] missionary or evangelistic trips
[53:37] overseas for what seven years now yeah
[53:39] 2013 was the last time
[53:41] i just told him no every time no no no
[53:43] sorry sorry i'm saying with my family
[53:44] now i'm pastoring the church now
[53:46] i just feel led to pastor right now
[53:48] that's mainly what i do
[53:50] and there can be times like brother
[53:52] branham brother brown was a pastor for
[53:54] 17 years and then god called him out to
[53:57] be a missionary and evangelist
[53:59] praise god and at the end of his life
[54:02] god called him to be a teacher
[54:04] of the church ages and the seven seals
[54:06] amen
[54:08] we're listening to our house there are
[54:10] to me there's no better teaching
[54:11] tapes than the seven seals if you want
[54:14] to hear
[54:14] some solid teaching my goodness those
[54:17] are the best tapes i've ever heard on
[54:19] teaching just
[54:20] one scripture after another all the
[54:22] thoughts that brother man brings out
[54:24] each sermon is like three hours you know
[54:26] it's just a treasure of uh teaching
[54:28] because he sat there day after day and
[54:30] could just study every day don't have to
[54:32] go pray for the sick or anything
[54:33] just study study study study preach it's
[54:35] one of the most beautiful teaching uh
[54:38] series ever all right that's my opinion
[54:43] okay now
[54:49] okay so
[54:52] here is i want to read now now i want to
[54:54] read i want to go back
[54:55] uh to standing in the gap that i
[54:57] mentioned earlier here's what brother
[54:59] bam says
[55:00] uh remember brother branham is at a
[55:03] restaurant
[55:05] and he sees mountain men remember he
[55:07] does the big sneeze the big wachui
[55:09] and everybody laughs on the tape when
[55:11] they listen to it
[55:12] brother ram said he saw a man a big
[55:15] mountain man
[55:16] and uh he sneezed and and he didn't
[55:19] apologize brother graham said he'd like
[55:21] that he thought that was a real man's
[55:23] man
[55:23] and then there was a man sitting next to
[55:25] brother a man sitting across from
[55:27] another poor man
[55:28] and looked a lot like brother branham
[55:30] and brother ram got in the car with
[55:32] billy paul and said
[55:33] billy one day i'm going to be like those
[55:35] men and billy paul said daddy don't do
[55:37] that
[55:39] he said no i'm going to do that someday
[55:40] i'm just going to be a wilderness man
[55:41] like that
[55:42] like all you know not no haircuts no
[55:46] no shave in his face you know old ratty
[55:48] clothes on problem said i want to be
[55:50] like that
[55:53] and brother abraham is driving along
[55:54] billy paul goes to sleep and the angel
[55:56] lord says
[55:58] carry out your plans and you'll be like
[56:00] that the beggar
[56:02] that old man beggar with the that was
[56:04] sitting next to the big mountain woods
[56:06] man
[56:07] and brother man says lord i don't want
[56:10] to be like that
[56:11] now look at that brother one hour you
[56:13] can be saying i want to be like that the
[56:15] next hour i don't want to be like that
[56:17] doesn't that sound like a human to you
[56:20] doesn't that sound like somebody has
[56:21] mind battles like you and i
[56:23] one minute i'll be like no way we're
[56:25] gonna do that okay let's do it
[56:27] the next minute or yes i feel that i
[56:29] really want to do this
[56:30] next hour no i better not do that
[56:34] so he goes from wanting to be a woodsman
[56:38] and when he live in the woods and dress
[56:39] already until he says no
[56:41] the angel lord in the presence of angel
[56:43] lord no i don't want to do that
[56:46] the angel said your wife will go too can
[56:48] you imagine that your wife will leave
[56:50] you
[56:50] if you go up to the mountains she won't
[56:52] live up there in them hills like that
[56:54] you'll become a bum just as the dream
[56:56] showed you would
[56:59] i said lord i don't want to be like that
[57:02] i don't want you to i don't want to have
[57:03] to live like that i want to do something
[57:04] different
[57:06] now look what he tells the lord
[57:09] but i was told that you'd call me to be
[57:11] a prophet
[57:12] and i want to live in the wilderness
[57:15] like a prophet
[57:17] now look what brother branham says next
[57:20] brother adam says but i was using my own
[57:24] excuse so i could hunt
[57:27] my own good
[57:31] so if i can just say this i know some
[57:32] people might faint if i say this but i'm
[57:34] gonna say it anyway
[57:36] brother brown was being selfish
[57:40] i know people might have a heart attack
[57:42] if so call 9-1-1
[57:45] or let me pray for you he says it was
[57:49] my own good now let me say this
[57:53] how many know elijah was a wilderness
[57:55] man
[57:56] elijah came from the wilderness a
[57:58] tishbite nope and it's it's clear in the
[58:00] scripture
[58:00] nobody knows where he came from nobody
[58:03] knows where he went
[58:04] other than heaven right he went to
[58:06] heaven the rapture
[58:09] and so brother man that that's in his
[58:11] mind all the time well prophet's got to
[58:12] be like elijah you know
[58:14] out at the uh the brook of cherith right
[58:16] all by himself
[58:17] ravens feeding him you know so brother
[58:20] people are told brother baby you're like
[58:22] elijah you're like a like and so he had
[58:24] this idea sorry about that
[58:25] my fault yeah it's probably my fault
[58:32] so brother ram tells the lord he said
[58:33] lord but i thought i'm supposed to be a
[58:35] prophet
[58:35] and live out in the woods and brother
[58:37] bam said i admitted later
[58:39] i was just saying that so i could go
[58:41] hunting more
[58:46] he wanted to be out in the woods so he
[58:47] could hunt more so he didn't have to be
[58:49] with the people as much
[58:54] see now don't you appreciate that that
[58:56] he was honest
[58:57] i appreciate that
[59:02] now look what the lord says but he said
[59:05] but that was the prophets of the old
[59:07] testament
[59:09] you've been called to be there in a much
[59:12] higher office than that
[59:14] so i hope everybody understands that old
[59:16] testament prophet must be way
[59:18] down here a new testament prophet must
[59:20] be way up here
[59:22] now we're not we're not exalting
[59:23] ourselves remember jesus said
[59:25] even the least in the new testament is
[59:27] greater than john the baptist
[59:29] now i it's hard to understand
[59:32] how can amen how can we be better than
[59:34] john the baptist i have
[59:35] i don't know i don't even it's hard to
[59:37] believe
[59:40] but the angel the lord tells brother
[59:42] branham
[59:43] you've been called a much higher office
[59:46] than an old testament prophet
[59:51] he says you have more gifts besides
[59:54] that besides being a prophet see you
[59:57] have more gifts
[59:58] praise god paul had a gift to be a
[1:00:00] teacher he had a gift to be an apostle
[1:00:02] a gift to be a prophet and a a pastor
[1:00:06] evangelist he had all these gifts and
[1:00:08] it's a higher calling than an old
[1:00:10] testament prophet
[1:00:14] he said you was called to pray for the
[1:00:16] sick and to preach the gospel
[1:00:18] and in the apostolic form you know of
[1:00:20] greater things
[1:00:21] many great gifts
[1:00:25] now let me read this little list to you
[1:00:27] let me ask you church
[1:00:28] who is the greatest prophet ever
[1:00:32] who's the greatest prophet ever starts
[1:00:35] with a jay
[1:00:37] jesus did jesus hide away out in the
[1:00:40] wilderness all by himself
[1:00:42] no he was with the people
[1:00:47] right how about haggai and zachariah
[1:00:51] remember we preached on that a few
[1:00:52] months ago were they just hiding out all
[1:00:54] by themselves
[1:00:55] or were they working right there with
[1:00:57] zerubbabel
[1:00:59] they were right there see
[1:01:02] so see people had just put it in brother
[1:01:04] ram's mind see elijah was
[1:01:05] he was every prophet is like that he
[1:01:07] just stomps out in the wilderness
[1:01:09] he says thus saith the lord is not going
[1:01:10] to be never going to be rained till i
[1:01:12] call for it and he stomps out
[1:01:15] right that's what that's what elijah did
[1:01:17] and people have told brother graham
[1:01:18] you're just like that you're just like
[1:01:19] that
[1:01:20] but then he started thinking well if i'm
[1:01:22] like that then i can go hunt more
[1:01:25] and the lord had to correct him on that
[1:01:28] how about jeremiah does anyone know
[1:01:29] jeremiah did jeremiah hide out all by
[1:01:31] himself or was he in the city
[1:01:33] he was in the city he saw zedekiah
[1:01:36] church
[1:01:37] he saw zedekiah get chased down brought
[1:01:40] back
[1:01:40] got his eyes poked out they carried him
[1:01:42] to babylon
[1:01:44] and jeremiah went with them jeremiah was
[1:01:46] spared because he didn't rebel against
[1:01:47] the king
[1:01:49] but zedekiah was eventually you know
[1:01:51] taken out
[1:01:53] how about isaiah was isaiah all by all
[1:01:56] by himself or was he with the people
[1:01:59] right amongst the people so see church
[1:02:02] this is why it's so important
[1:02:04] we have to take everything brother ma'am
[1:02:07] said back to the word of god
[1:02:09] because now i see i see a pastor that
[1:02:11] he's all sad and discouraged because he
[1:02:13] can't come preach you know he
[1:02:15] he's basically locked himself in
[1:02:16] isolation because he's taken these
[1:02:19] quotes but not taking it back to the
[1:02:20] scripture
[1:02:22] and not even taking it to standing in
[1:02:23] the gap where you could have more than
[1:02:25] one gift you could have
[1:02:26] multiple gifts
[1:02:31] and i'm not i'm not saying anything
[1:02:32] against that pastor i love the brother
[1:02:34] wonderful he let me preach for him a
[1:02:36] couple times i had a wonderful time
[1:02:38] at his church the holy spirit was really
[1:02:40] moving and drawing people to a closer
[1:02:42] walk with the lord
[1:02:43] but i'm just saying this is why we have
[1:02:45] to be we have to be open to learning
[1:02:47] more
[1:02:48] right we got to be open to taking every
[1:02:51] thought
[1:02:51] back to the word
[1:02:55] and growing our understanding okay so i
[1:02:58] hope that's helpful by god's grace i
[1:02:59] hope that helps you
[1:03:00] that's what kind of came to me as i was
[1:03:01] sitting back there i wanted to make sure
[1:03:03] i read that here
[1:03:05] so just so you know brother man was
[1:03:07] using his own excuse
[1:03:10] his own excuse his own selfish desire
[1:03:13] was to be out in the woods
[1:03:15] and the angel lord has to correct him
[1:03:16] and say no your wife will leave you
[1:03:18] you'll be a bum and god has to correct
[1:03:23] him
[1:03:26] oh great is god's faithfulness praise
[1:03:28] god great is his faithfulness
[1:03:30] and then you want to hear what the angel
[1:03:32] said next he said
[1:03:34] why do you wait for me to move you every
[1:03:36] time you move
[1:03:37] where's your reward
[1:03:41] so see we were talking about remember
[1:03:42] this morning i was saying how you want
[1:03:44] to wait on the lord well i guess brother
[1:03:45] brown was waiting too long
[1:03:50] he said why do you wait to move so long
[1:03:55] now i'm not sure let's read it here
[1:04:02] okay so he doesn't say anything more
[1:04:03] about that so i'm not sure about
[1:04:05] what he's talking about but then
[1:04:08] the angel says you've lost the feeling
[1:04:10] for the people so the whole
[1:04:12] reason he wanted to go hunting was could
[1:04:13] he want to get away from his church
[1:04:15] he want to get away from all the
[1:04:17] churches because they he said he'd
[1:04:18] preach
[1:04:19] about holiness and the next time he come
[1:04:20] back they were worse
[1:04:23] and it hurt brother branham so much he
[1:04:25] left his family
[1:04:26] he left everything to preach to them and
[1:04:27] they wouldn't obey
[1:04:29] it hurt him so much he said fine he'll
[1:04:31] i'll just go up in the wilderness and
[1:04:32] they don't they don't have to hear it if
[1:04:33] they don't want to hear it
[1:04:37] so see church we really got to make sure
[1:04:39] our hearts don't get overtaken in
[1:04:41] complexes
[1:04:43] if you ever feel a hard feeling towards
[1:04:45] somebody please go talk to them
[1:04:48] and please just love them just love them
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:52] don't let satan try to inject something
[1:04:54] that will cause you to separate yourself
[1:04:56] from other people
[1:04:59] you know god wouldn't let brother
[1:05:00] branham do that and so we've got to stay
[1:05:02] with our family praise god
[1:05:04] we must be right here you know that's
[1:05:06] what happened to my dad when my dad
[1:05:08] uh got under depression
[1:05:12] and maybe i'll share you know malachi
[1:05:13] knows him you know my children know
[1:05:15] grandpa
[1:05:16] but when he really got under depression
[1:05:17] children we had we had a building we
[1:05:19] lived in there was two stories
[1:05:21] he'd wake up early one of the first ones
[1:05:23] to wake up he'd go down in his office
[1:05:25] and just smoke cigarettes and drink
[1:05:27] coffee all day
[1:05:29] he would only come up to eat maybe once
[1:05:30] or twice and i'd have to go
[1:05:32] this was every day for years before they
[1:05:34] got divorced
[1:05:36] i think he got divorced when i was in
[1:05:37] seventh grade what grady in malcolm
[1:05:39] eighth your eighth your seventh okay
[1:05:42] well
[1:05:43] you're the eighth next year yeah so
[1:05:45] you're at the age
[1:05:46] uh when my parents got divorced same age
[1:05:49] it really hurt me
[1:05:50] it really hurt but see the devil
[1:05:53] isolated him it made him live in the
[1:05:56] same house but he wasn't there
[1:05:58] he really wasn't there and i would go
[1:06:00] down and see him just to spend time with
[1:06:02] him
[1:06:03] and every time i go down there brother
[1:06:04] amen he was sitting like this just
[1:06:05] reading the bible smoking cigarettes and
[1:06:07] drinking coffee at his
[1:06:08] desk all day all day
[1:06:12] all day uh
[1:06:15] and so that's what i'm saying like we
[1:06:16] don't i love my dad and he's you know
[1:06:18] he's doing a little bit
[1:06:19] a little bit better but we don't want to
[1:06:21] let satan isolate us that's what satan
[1:06:23] was trying to do to brother branham
[1:06:25] now he would not have smoked and drank
[1:06:27] you know my dad didn't drink
[1:06:28] you know maybe not much at all but
[1:06:31] that's what's the same thing satan was
[1:06:33] trying to do
[1:06:33] he was trying to take those gifts and
[1:06:35] separate them from the people
[1:06:36] when they were made for the people
[1:06:38] praise god brother
[1:06:40] brother amen your singing gift is for
[1:06:42] the people praise god
[1:06:43] we need it praise god and when you play
[1:06:45] the tambourine sister
[1:06:46] we need that praise god maokai and
[1:06:48] acacia every one of us
[1:06:50] everyone that has everybody we need
[1:06:53] everybody's gifts praise god
[1:06:54] we might not see until later did you
[1:06:57] know this brother amen
[1:06:58] jim shumake didn't even preach or pass
[1:07:01] now he's pastor
[1:07:02] up in albion he didn't even start
[1:07:04] preaching her pastor until
[1:07:06] like he was in his 50s and he's one of
[1:07:09] the most faithful pastors
[1:07:10] i've never i've never seen a pastor love
[1:07:12] their people so much as him
[1:07:15] and he even start preaching though he's
[1:07:16] in his 50s
[1:07:18] so every service after service he was so
[1:07:20] faithful to the message
[1:07:22] and brother pastor after pastor came and
[1:07:25] they stole the money from the people
[1:07:26] or they married another woman and had
[1:07:28] adultery and they just went through one
[1:07:31] bad pastor after another and finally
[1:07:33] they the churches split and finally they
[1:07:35] said we need a pastor
[1:07:36] and everybody said jim you're lester
[1:07:40] and it was that moment because nobody
[1:07:42] else come to visit him
[1:07:44] it was at that moment brother jim said
[1:07:45] god spoke to my heart said i am the path
[1:07:48] and he's been a faithful pastor
[1:07:51] so let me just encourage you with that
[1:07:53] not all gifts operate right away
[1:07:55] there's gifts laying in people's lives
[1:07:57] you know
[1:07:58] i hope there's some more in my life too
[1:08:01] i see some of them but i'd like to see
[1:08:02] more by god's grace
[1:08:04] like we can see acacia's singing gift
[1:08:06] you know now we can see that
[1:08:08] malachi we can clearly see it with the
[1:08:10] piano playing and instruments
[1:08:12] girls with we can hear it but there's
[1:08:15] more
[1:08:15] there's got to be more
[1:08:19] and so we have to just stay faithful to
[1:08:21] god
[1:08:22] and not be selfish don't become isolated
[1:08:24] right like brother
[1:08:25] tried to isolate himself my dad i say
[1:08:27] himself don't isolate yourself
[1:08:30] be with the people love the people even
[1:08:33] if the people
[1:08:34] speak evil against you love them anyway
[1:08:36] praise god
[1:08:38] amen love them anyway there were some
[1:08:41] years where it was really hard to come
[1:08:43] to church here because people were
[1:08:44] really mean to me
[1:08:45] but i kept coming i kept coming i didn't
[1:08:48] give up and now look at me i'm happier
[1:08:49] than ever praise god
[1:08:52] we just we all got to go through trials
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:55] what if i would have quit out of have
[1:08:56] been awful praise i would still be in
[1:08:59] i'll probably be depressed like my dad i
[1:09:00] probably i would probably repeat
[1:09:02] his cycle right because that's what
[1:09:05] satan likes to do
[1:09:06] like with you know like gambling or
[1:09:07] something or adultery or
[1:09:09] uh you know just sins satan likes to
[1:09:12] anoint the sons to do like their fathers
[1:09:14] but we've got to break the cycle praise
[1:09:16] god and i have broke this cycle by god's
[1:09:18] grace
[1:09:21] okay let's give me 20 more minutes here
[1:09:22] we'll try to finish up by god's grace
[1:09:26] okay now brother ram he gets so
[1:09:29] deep into this thought about how you
[1:09:31] can't you can't mix the gifts
[1:09:35] he says this
[1:09:39] let me read a little bit here
[1:09:44] he says if god called me to be his
[1:09:46] prophet then i'm certainly not holding
[1:09:47] the office of one
[1:09:49] prophets don't evangelize look what he
[1:09:52] says
[1:09:52] a prophet hides himself in the
[1:09:54] wilderness alone with god
[1:09:56] until he gets exactly directly what god
[1:09:59] wants him to do
[1:10:00] now is that the case not always i just
[1:10:03] i just read you five prophets that were
[1:10:05] with the people the whole time
[1:10:07] moses only left for 40 days he came
[1:10:09] right back that's another one
[1:10:10] moses he was right with him yeah he was
[1:10:13] so much with him brother amen that he
[1:10:15] had to say god
[1:10:16] i don't i can't judge all these people
[1:10:18] so god said i'll anoint 70 judges
[1:10:21] i'll take the spirit on you and i'll put
[1:10:23] it on 70 others amen
[1:10:25] see moses it was hard job but he was not
[1:10:29] separate from the people he was right
[1:10:31] with the people
[1:10:34] we'll see brother ramsey he just has
[1:10:35] this idea in his mind well prophet's got
[1:10:37] to be just like elijah
[1:10:38] you stomp you come in stomp that say
[1:10:40] thor you leave out well that was elijah
[1:10:43] that was elijah
[1:10:46] it's not every prophet
[1:10:49] see he said a prophet stomps right out
[1:10:52] gives his message and goes back in the
[1:10:54] wilderness and goes again
[1:10:55] he's not an evangelist holding meetings
[1:10:58] now listen this
[1:10:59] the man said a prophet doesn't hold
[1:11:00] meetings
[1:11:03] and getting cooperations and all these
[1:11:07] things like evangelists do
[1:11:09] he don't teach like evangelists
[1:11:12] he has thus saith the lord and that's it
[1:11:14] and that's all
[1:11:16] can you believe that if that's what he
[1:11:19] thought
[1:11:21] can you imagine if that's if that's all
[1:11:23] jesus did jesus come and said thus saith
[1:11:25] the lord
[1:11:26] here's a sermon on the mount and he
[1:11:27] walked away and he never healed the sick
[1:11:29] can you imagine that would have been
[1:11:32] like a
[1:11:33] a just such a difference ministry
[1:11:36] but brother amen he said come over here
[1:11:38] little children come over here and sit
[1:11:39] on my lap
[1:11:41] jesus said come on over here let the
[1:11:43] little children come unto me
[1:11:46] amen i love it praise god amen this word
[1:11:49] is so true
[1:11:54] brother see see how we can get our minds
[1:11:58] we can get so sure we're so sure we're
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:02] we can be wrong
[1:12:06] god help help me to be humble that i can
[1:12:07] be corrected if i'm wrong
[1:12:09] that's my prayer he said a prophet gives
[1:12:12] it throws it out and let the chips fall
[1:12:14] where it may
[1:12:16] and he goes away again nobody knows
[1:12:18] where he's at he's in isolation
[1:12:20] somewhere
[1:12:24] oh my goodness but even elijah wasn't
[1:12:28] always like that because remember when
[1:12:30] remember when
[1:12:30] the woman that had the baby prayed for
[1:12:32] it maybe the baby died remember
[1:12:34] she knew right where to find him right
[1:12:37] she come and knock she sent her
[1:12:39] messengers and my
[1:12:41] the baby's dead go with elijah bring his
[1:12:43] staff remember that
[1:12:45] in the book of kings she knew right
[1:12:47] where he was
[1:12:48] he wasn't hiding away in some isolation
[1:12:53] so here's what i think church i think
[1:12:54] jeffersonville i think in other people
[1:12:56] they take these one quotes like this
[1:12:59] that's all he does he just gives thus
[1:13:00] saith the lord he doesn't teach
[1:13:02] he just gives us the lord he stomps out
[1:13:04] with us they say that
[1:13:07] uh just to just to try to make uh
[1:13:10] brother brown different from everybody
[1:13:12] else and they try to start these
[1:13:14] these uh these false teachings
[1:13:18] and they don't read on they don't read
[1:13:20] the rest of it
[1:13:21] they don't read even the scripture many
[1:13:23] times
[1:13:24] elijah wasn't hiding out the whole time
[1:13:26] in isolation
[1:13:31] okay now
[1:13:34] let's go to acts 15 and remember what i
[1:13:37] just said
[1:13:38] what i just read brother braham said he
[1:13:40] don't hold meetings
[1:13:42] the ramp said a prophet doesn't hold
[1:13:44] meetings okay
[1:13:46] he doesn't get cooperation with anybody
[1:13:51] if you read your bible lately in chapter
[1:13:52] 15 you know what i'm talking about
[1:13:55] paul had cooperations and he had
[1:13:57] meetings with people
[1:14:00] see brother amen this is why i'm sharing
[1:14:01] with you in malachi
[1:14:03] everything by braham says we got to make
[1:14:04] sure it lines up with the bible
[1:14:06] if not we'll get a false idea
[1:14:09] and we'll just go off on some false
[1:14:11] doctrine
[1:14:13] i just read it to you said they don't
[1:14:14] have meetings they don't hold meetings
[1:14:17] and they don't get cooperation they
[1:14:19] don't teach people
[1:14:23] acts 15 1 and certain men which came
[1:14:25] down from judea taught the brethren and
[1:14:27] said except ye be circumcised after the
[1:14:28] manner of moses
[1:14:30] you cannot be saved what a false
[1:14:31] doctrine
[1:14:33] verse two and where and there i'm sorry
[1:14:36] when therefore paul and barnabas had no
[1:14:37] small dissension and disputation with
[1:14:39] them
[1:14:39] they determined that paul and barnabas
[1:14:41] and certain other men should go up to
[1:14:43] jerusalem under the apostles and elders
[1:14:45] about this
[1:14:45] question was paul going to cooperate
[1:14:49] with other people
[1:14:51] yes was paul going to hold a meeting yes
[1:14:57] oh but every word on the tape is thus
[1:14:58] saith the lord no it's not
[1:15:01] no it's not you guys we got to take
[1:15:03] everything back to the word
[1:15:05] verse 3 and being brought on their way
[1:15:08] by the church they pass through
[1:15:09] venice and samaria declaring the
[1:15:11] conversion of the gentiles and they call
[1:15:13] us great joy
[1:15:14] unto all the brother well there he's had
[1:15:16] meetings right there right
[1:15:19] he's having meetings verse 4
[1:15:22] when they were come to jerusalem they
[1:15:23] were received of the church and of the
[1:15:25] apostles and elders and
[1:15:26] declared all things that god had done
[1:15:28] with them
[1:15:30] but there rose up of the certain of the
[1:15:32] sect of the pharisees which believed
[1:15:33] saying
[1:15:33] that it was needful to be to circumcise
[1:15:36] them and to command them to keep the law
[1:15:38] of moses and the apostles and elders
[1:15:40] came together for to consider this
[1:15:42] matter
[1:15:43] here see what it said they came together
[1:15:46] all the churches
[1:15:48] all those pastors are apostles prophets
[1:15:51] they all came together
[1:15:52] to have a meeting brother ram just said
[1:15:55] a prophet doesn't hold meetings
[1:15:59] hallelujah
[1:16:03] verse 7 and when there had been much
[1:16:05] disputing peter rose up and said to them
[1:16:07] men and brethren you know how that god a
[1:16:09] good while ago
[1:16:11] made choice god made choice among us
[1:16:13] that the gentiles by my mouth
[1:16:15] should hear the word of the gospel and
[1:16:17] believe and god which knoweth the hearts
[1:16:19] bear them witness giving them the holy
[1:16:21] ghost
[1:16:22] even as he did unto us and put no
[1:16:25] difference between
[1:16:26] us and them purifying their hearts by
[1:16:28] faith now therefore why tempt you god to
[1:16:30] put a yoke upon the neck of the
[1:16:32] disciples
[1:16:33] which neither our fathers nor we were
[1:16:35] able to bear
[1:16:36] but we believe that through the grace of
[1:16:38] our lord jesus christ we shall be saved
[1:16:41] even as they amen then all the multitude
[1:16:45] kept silent so this is a pretty big
[1:16:46] group of people
[1:16:48] and gave audience to barnabas and paul
[1:16:50] declaring what miracles and wonders god
[1:16:52] had wrought among the gentiles
[1:16:53] by them and after they had held their
[1:16:57] peace
[1:16:57] look this is awesome peter goes first
[1:17:00] then paul and barnabas and james is the
[1:17:03] last one to go
[1:17:05] and james was one of the first ones to
[1:17:06] die for christ
[1:17:09] and remember jay this is the same james
[1:17:10] that wrote the book of james
[1:17:13] he was called a pillar in the church
[1:17:15] like our little baby james there
[1:17:17] sweet little baby james same same name
[1:17:22] he stands up in verse uh
[1:17:27] yeah 13. james answered saying men and
[1:17:30] brethren hearken unto me simeon hath
[1:17:31] declared how
[1:17:32] god did at first visit the gentiles to
[1:17:35] take out of them a people for his name
[1:17:38] now there's a good bride scripture right
[1:17:39] there why do you take the people
[1:17:41] to share his name to get to marry them
[1:17:44] to give them his name
[1:17:46] praise god i'm glad my wife became a
[1:17:48] smith instead of a hesterman praise god
[1:17:50] i took her out for my name and i got a
[1:17:52] son from my name and daughters
[1:17:54] for my name verse 15. and to this agree
[1:17:57] the words of the prophets as it is
[1:17:59] written so this is beautiful
[1:18:00] how is james going to prove to this
[1:18:02] multitude
[1:18:04] that they shouldn't they don't have to
[1:18:05] be circumcised to be saved he quotes
[1:18:07] the prophets amen so a prophet like
[1:18:11] james
[1:18:12] quotes more prophets and it's because of
[1:18:15] james sermon here
[1:18:17] his short sermon and he quotes numerous
[1:18:19] prophets i believe it's amos
[1:18:20] and isaiah after james speaks everybody
[1:18:24] says amen now we're convinced praise the
[1:18:27] lord
[1:18:29] so how's god going to convince people
[1:18:30] today that this message is the truth
[1:18:33] through the word of god amen through the
[1:18:36] prophets
[1:18:37] through all their prophecies that's how
[1:18:39] i was convinced you're convinced we're
[1:18:41] all convinced
[1:18:42] through the word of the prophets amen
[1:18:47] verse 16 and after this i will return
[1:18:49] and we'll build again the tabernacle of
[1:18:50] david which has fallen down
[1:18:52] and i will build again the ruins thereof
[1:18:53] and i will set it up that the residue of
[1:18:56] men might seek after the lord
[1:18:58] and all the gentiles upon whom my name
[1:19:00] is called saith the lord
[1:19:02] who doeth all these things
[1:19:05] praise the lord now verse 18 known unto
[1:19:08] god are all his works from the beginning
[1:19:10] of the world
[1:19:11] sorry
[1:19:15] now look uh in verse 19 and 20
[1:19:20] james gives four things the gentiles
[1:19:23] should not do
[1:19:26] uh verse 20 yeah here it is absane from
[1:19:29] pollutions
[1:19:31] i'm sorry pollutions of idols don't get
[1:19:33] into idols
[1:19:35] don't fornicate uh don't eat things
[1:19:38] strangled animals strangled
[1:19:40] and then don't drink blood
[1:19:43] and then he says moses now look at verse
[1:19:45] 22. here it is i'll finish here soon
[1:19:47] then pleased at the apostles and elders
[1:19:50] with the whole church to send chosen men
[1:19:53] of their own company to antioch with
[1:19:54] paul and barnabas
[1:19:56] namely judah's surname
[1:20:02] and silas chief men among the brethren
[1:20:04] and they wrote letters by them after
[1:20:06] this manner the apostles and elders and
[1:20:07] brethren send greetings unto the
[1:20:08] brethren
[1:20:09] which are of the gentiles in antioch so
[1:20:11] they write letters
[1:20:13] and they send them out to all the
[1:20:16] churches
[1:20:20] yeah now look at verse verse 30. so when
[1:20:23] they were dismissed they came to antioch
[1:20:25] and when they gathered the multitude
[1:20:26] together they delivered the epistle
[1:20:29] which when they had read they rejoiced
[1:20:30] for the consolation and judas and silas
[1:20:33] being prophets also themselves
[1:20:35] exhorted the brethren with many words
[1:20:36] and confirmed them
[1:20:38] and after that they tarry their space
[1:20:40] they were let go in the peace from the
[1:20:41] brethren unto the apostles
[1:20:43] notwithstanding it please silas to abide
[1:20:45] there still paul also and barnabas
[1:20:47] continued in antioch teaching and
[1:20:49] preaching the word of
[1:20:50] the lord with many others also
[1:20:54] praise god amen this is paul's
[1:20:57] apostolic pattern as a prophet
[1:21:01] did he hold meetings yes or no church
[1:21:03] did he hold meetings
[1:21:04] yes did he cooperate with people yes or
[1:21:07] no
[1:21:08] yes he sat there and let paul let
[1:21:10] everybody take a turn preaching
[1:21:14] ah glory praise god he he could have
[1:21:16] said everybody
[1:21:17] shut up and sit down i'm the proud i'm
[1:21:19] the prophet
[1:21:21] he didn't say that neither did brother
[1:21:24] branham
[1:21:25] because he knows we're all led by the
[1:21:27] holy spirit we all have to have a gift
[1:21:28] of the holy spirit
[1:21:29] we must all use that spirit for god's
[1:21:31] glory
[1:21:33] and then he let james stand up james
[1:21:34] stood up and said here's what the
[1:21:36] prophet said let's do this and everybody
[1:21:38] said
[1:21:38] amen hallelujah james i like that
[1:21:42] write it down and they wrote letters and
[1:21:44] they said paul barnabas you take it to
[1:21:45] that one
[1:21:46] uh you take it this one silas and you
[1:21:48] just take these letters all out and he
[1:21:50] cooperated with
[1:21:51] all the brethren
[1:21:54] oh thank you jesus this just makes me so
[1:21:56] happy
[1:22:02] and then remember verse 36 does do
[1:22:05] prophets
[1:22:06] have cooperation let's see and some days
[1:22:08] after
[1:22:09] paul said unto barnabas let us go again
[1:22:12] and visit our brethren in every city
[1:22:13] where we have preached the word of the
[1:22:14] lord
[1:22:15] and let's see how they do paul say let's
[1:22:17] go into isolation
[1:22:19] no sir he did not go into isolation
[1:22:24] he kept ministering now look how he did
[1:22:27] it church and i'll close with this
[1:22:29] he went from one church to another the
[1:22:31] prophet went to the church
[1:22:33] now it's different today let me say it
[1:22:36] like this today the church of
[1:22:37] jeffersonville they bypass all the
[1:22:39] pastors and they go straight to the
[1:22:40] people
[1:22:41] because they got a mailing list
[1:22:44] and i i've heard it i mean we it's uh
[1:22:46] it's known to everybody
[1:22:47] they have a mailing list of everybody
[1:22:49] who ever orders from them and they send
[1:22:51] out their ideas
[1:22:53] just straight to the people that's not
[1:22:55] how a prophet operates
[1:22:57] a prophet goes to the church and he goes
[1:23:00] to the pastor
[1:23:02] you see that and that's how
[1:23:07] that's how their false doctrine is even
[1:23:09] spread they skip the pastor
[1:23:12] and they come right to the people let's
[1:23:14] stand our feet musicians you can come
[1:23:18] here
[1:23:21] i think i'll just stop with that because
[1:23:23] i think that's a real blessing
[1:23:25] i think everybody can see can anybody
[1:23:26] see that paul had multiple gifts
[1:23:28] can we see that paul did not isolate
[1:23:30] himself away from other
[1:23:33] jesus christ did not operate i'm sorry
[1:23:36] did not isolate himself from other
[1:23:38] people
[1:23:39] he stayed with the people
[1:23:42] jeremiah isaiah moses haggai zechariah
[1:23:46] they were all right with the people
[1:23:49] there may have been times moses went
[1:23:51] away for 40 days right
[1:23:53] elijah went off for what three and a
[1:23:55] half years the brook sheriff
[1:23:57] well maybe it wasn't their whole three
[1:23:58] and a half years because he went and uh
[1:24:01] stayed by that woman's house that that
[1:24:03] uh
[1:24:04] fed him with the meat the meat offering
[1:24:06] and everything the meal offering
[1:24:08] but church i hope it's clear to you and
[1:24:10] i that we have to be very careful when
[1:24:13] we listen to the tapes
[1:24:14] not that we're going to be deceived but
[1:24:15] that we just don't take the wrong idea
[1:24:18] but we know brother brahma was not out
[1:24:19] to deceive anybody
[1:24:21] we know he was a godly man a holy
[1:24:22] ghost-filled man
[1:24:24] we have to make sure that we don't
[1:24:26] listen to one specific quote
[1:24:28] and take that quote too far without
[1:24:31] taking it back to the word of god
[1:24:33] how many want to take everything back to
[1:24:34] the word of god
[1:24:37] see i thought those were some really
[1:24:38] important examples bang were you able to
[1:24:40] hear that one that last one
[1:24:42] okay praise the lord i want you to hear
[1:24:43] it too uh just to see that
[1:24:45] but abraham said prophets don't hold
[1:24:46] meetings they're in isolation
[1:24:50] they don't meet with anybody yet paul
[1:24:51] was with people all the time
[1:24:54] remember he was how long was he with
[1:24:56] ephesus church three years
[1:24:58] he didn't he didn't hide away from the
[1:25:00] ephesians he was with them
[1:25:02] he was right there working remember he
[1:25:04] was with the thessalonicans
[1:25:06] and he said i don't want your money he
[1:25:08] said i'm gonna make my own tents
[1:25:11] he was so with them that he wouldn't
[1:25:13] even take their money
[1:25:14] he said i'm going to set up my own tents
[1:25:16] i'll be a tent worker i just want
[1:25:18] everybody to see
[1:25:19] that i'm here to be a servant he was so
[1:25:22] careful
[1:25:22] and yet then other times he would
[1:25:24] receive from the corinthians he received
[1:25:26] from the philippians at times so we're
[1:25:28] just led by the holy spirit
[1:25:30] praise god let's uh you got a song on
[1:25:32] your heart but you'd like to see
[1:25:33] okay i want to sing that one again i
[1:25:36] stand amazed let's sing that one

[1:29:33] bring out these quotes
[1:29:35] and people think i'm trying to correct
[1:29:36] brother branham
[1:29:38] i'm not trying to correct brother
[1:29:39] branham i'm just trying to preach the
[1:29:41] truth
[1:29:44] brother and brought such great
[1:29:45] revelations we'll never correct the
[1:29:47] major
[1:29:47] things they're already the major things
[1:29:51] don't need any correction
[1:29:53] it's these little minor details
[1:29:56] that makes perfect sense he had to come
[1:29:58] and finish the mystery of god
[1:30:00] he gave us thus saith the lord on
[1:30:02] baptism godhead
[1:30:04] everything you know all these all these
[1:30:06] marriage and divorce church ages
[1:30:08] we have thus all these major doctrines
[1:30:12] and just on these little minor things
[1:30:14] they're so important though because we
[1:30:15] can see
[1:30:16] if they're not taught right people get
[1:30:18] the wrong idea
[1:30:20] and they start making something a
[1:30:22] doctrine that shouldn't be a doctrine
[1:30:26] i hope church that you understand i'm
[1:30:27] not trying to exalt myself or anything
[1:30:30] like that
[1:30:30] i just want to know the truth i just
[1:30:33] wanted to take everything
[1:30:34] like brother bram said i want to think
[1:30:36] in man's filter praise god
[1:30:39] i just want to filter for my mind
[1:30:43] i just don't and brother bam said he
[1:30:45] said we shouldn't be just a bunch of yes
[1:30:47] men maybe i have to bring that quote on
[1:30:48] wednesday
[1:30:49] lebron said i appreciate a man who's got
[1:30:51] convictions just doesn't say i believe
[1:30:53] everything you say
[1:30:55] how come people don't use that quote
[1:30:58] i want to i want the word of god to
[1:31:00] filter i'm going to take the
[1:31:02] message and filter it i'm sorry i'm
[1:31:03] going to take brother sermons and filter
[1:31:05] them through the message this is the
[1:31:07] message
[1:31:08] amen this is the message the revelation
[1:31:11] of
[1:31:11] this is the message but the man's
[1:31:13] sermons point to the message
[1:31:15] they point to the word of god and this
[1:31:18] is our filter a thinking man's filter
[1:31:21] praise god that's okay i don't mind
[1:31:24] being criticized like i said i just want
[1:31:26] to
