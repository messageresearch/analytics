[33:34] [Music]
[34:45] [Music]
[34:54] it's all about Emily men
[34:56] where will we be without him amen he's
[34:59] the one that drew us to this place
[35:01] amen he's the one that made us who we
[35:03] are
[35:04] amen we were we were going the other way
[35:06] and Christ came and pulled us and turn
[35:09] us around put us right where he designed
[35:11] us to be hey man he's the one that had
[35:13] the vision before the foundation of the
[35:16] world he saw us in his mind before the
[35:19] foundation of the world and in the midst
[35:21] of our going the wrong way he called us
[35:24] to go back to what the vision said that
[35:26] we ought to be amen and I'm just I'm
[35:29] just so glad that he did Amen because I
[35:31] know that his vision is perfect
[35:33] amen his vision is beautiful hey man
[35:36] this is the God that created the
[35:38] mountains they created the oceans they
[35:40] created everything that we enjoy about
[35:41] this planet amen he is willing to create
[35:44] all those things amen and he created
[35:46] them according to a vision that was in
[35:47] his mind a man in that same vision spoke
[35:50] of you spoke of you spoke of you that
[35:53] same vision is just as beautiful a man
[35:56] is what the mountains is as the oceans
[35:58] that same vision is just as beautiful
[36:01] amen and we are walking right into that
[36:04] hey man we're stepping right into it
[36:06] amen it'll be a beautiful thing
[36:09] beautiful hey man so this evening I just
[36:13] want to preach a message I think your
[36:15] break for coming out on a Saturday night
[36:16] I want to preach a message called
[36:18] God's response to the cries of bondage
[36:23] amen God's response to the cries of
[36:27] bondage because when God's people get
[36:30] into a place of bondage he has a
[36:33] specific response to that cry when they
[36:37] cry out when they're in bondage God has
[36:39] a specific response that he gives to
[36:42] that cry but it isn't necessarily the
[36:44] response that you would think it would
[36:46] be a mess let's turn to access chapter 2
[36:50] hey man I just want to say I enjoy every
[36:53] single time I come to this place hey man
[36:55] so I appreciate everybody having such a
[36:56] welcoming spirit it's always good to be
[36:59] back because here about a year ago I had
[37:01] a awful struggle trying to get here I
[37:04] had to really talk to my flesh this
[37:08] morning and say we're not here to get
[37:09] frustrated that's my flesh fight the
[37:15] flesh was weak and thankfully the Lord
[37:18] gave me a nice long layover in Chicago
[37:19] and I had uh get some things settled out
[37:24] and it's amazing how Laurie is able to
[37:27] turn this around a man we were always
[37:29] our body always seems to want to go some
[37:32] way but God is giving us a position to
[37:35] stand up here above our own selves so
[37:38] when we would start to go the wrong way
[37:39] there's Lois spirit that's not the way
[37:42] to do it go back go back go back towards
[37:44] the vision and there it is
[37:46] amen a mess so exodus chapter 2 will
[37:51] read the 23rd the 24th verse and it says
[37:55] and it came to pass in the process of
[37:59] time that the king of Egypt died and the
[38:04] children of Israel side by reason of the
[38:07] bondage and they cried and their cry
[38:11] came up unto God by reason of the
[38:14] bondage and God heard their groaning
[38:18] and God remembered his covenant with
[38:21] Abraham and with Isaac and Jacob and God
[38:24] looked upon the children of Israel and
[38:27] God had respect unto them a malicious
[38:31] power has a word of Prayer Heavenly
[38:33] Father we just thank you Lord for an
[38:35] evening where we could gather together
[38:36] Lord to you Lord here at the end of the
[38:39] week father that you gave us Lord in the
[38:41] beginning CD to you Father have nine own
[38:47] way Lord take your place a smarter Lord
[38:50] have the preeminence this evening father
[38:52] we give ourselves over to you father for
[38:56] we whatever it is that you had in your
[38:58] mind when you were dying upon that cross
[39:00] Lord that's what we want to be father
[39:02] and we give ourselves over to that
[39:04] tonight Lord in the name of Lord Jesus
[39:06] Christ we pray amen amen god bless you
[39:10] you can be seated I think we all
[39:14] remember how the story of how the
[39:17] children of Israel got to be in this
[39:19] position you remember when Joseph was
[39:25] put into prison by his brothers that
[39:27] that uh he was sold into slavery and and
[39:31] they they took him all the way over to
[39:35] Egypt and they put him into slavery in
[39:37] Egypt they end up rise nothing power
[39:39] then he got thrown into prison and then
[39:41] God delivered him with the mighty hand
[39:43] and got enough blessing him and Egypt so
[39:47] much so that the ruler of Egypt said
[39:50] come over here I want to give you a
[39:51] blessing I want to give you a blessing
[39:53] of the land of Goshen and I want to put
[39:56] you in this land I want you to be at
[39:58] peace in this place I want you to have
[40:02] your way in this place but I just want
[40:05] you to cut you know and they were they
[40:07] were given that land of Goshen and it
[40:09] was a blessing to them you remember as
[40:12] Joseph came and he he took his his
[40:14] father and always brethren his family
[40:16] and they all went over to Goshen and
[40:18] they were blessed there amen they they
[40:21] they began to increase and riches amen
[40:24] they they had children and their
[40:25] children's children and their
[40:27] grandchildren amen great-grandchildren
[40:29] and as they grew God just always
[40:31] bless him in that place amen but you
[40:34] know God that was not the land that God
[40:36] had promised to their father Abraham so
[40:40] no matter how much they were being
[40:42] blessed there in Goshen they were not
[40:45] living in the promises of God amen so in
[40:50] the process of time now remember in the
[40:52] process of time that after the the eat
[40:55] that king died there rose up a pharaoh
[40:57] that did not know Joseph amen and that
[41:01] Pharaoh began to get scared about this
[41:03] rich and powerful people over on the
[41:05] borderland over in the well water land
[41:08] of Goshen and so he began to put them
[41:10] into slavery and it is he began to tax
[41:13] them as he began to slowly put the
[41:15] pressure down and slowly I don't know
[41:17] how long it took him but he just I'm
[41:19] sure you know how the devil does he just
[41:21] slowly moves him from peace into bondage
[41:25] he that's that's how it always goes
[41:28] every time Satan is gonna bring you into
[41:30] bond it's always gonna be a slow walk
[41:32] amen
[41:33] you're gonna go from what you think is a
[41:35] land of peace but it's gonna slowly
[41:37] transform into a land of bondage amen
[41:41] and so after 400 years I got to the
[41:44] point where they began to rise
[41:48] we're slaves we're in bondage it's
[41:52] there's something about the human heart
[41:55] that is like yeah I'm not it's not
[41:57] supposed to be like this and there's
[41:59] something about the human spirit that
[42:00] when they catch themselves in that type
[42:02] of a position there's something within
[42:04] them that just rises up and says it's
[42:06] not supposed to be like this you take
[42:08] any man that's sick you know he cries
[42:10] out I there was a time when I used to be
[42:12] well and there's something inside of
[42:14] them that cries out I want to be well
[42:16] again you take someone that gets in a
[42:18] bad situation where they're where
[42:20] they're being abused or or or or
[42:24] whatever it is or they're in a bad spot
[42:26] in their job or they're in debt or
[42:27] something like that there's a cry begins
[42:30] to rise up inside of them because there
[42:32] was a time when they were in that
[42:34] condition and there's a hope inside of
[42:37] them and where they wish they remember
[42:39] what it was like to not be in that type
[42:41] of a bondage and like how do I get back
[42:43] to what the land of Russell
[42:46] how do I get back - there's something to
[42:47] citing Mina's crying out for peace
[42:49] there's crying out for joy that's crying
[42:52] out for a health that's crying out for
[42:54] peace how do I get back to that place
[42:57] amen and so they begin to cry out unto
[43:00] the Lord amen and the Bible says as they
[43:04] began to cry that their cry began to
[43:07] lift up off the earth and it began to
[43:10] enter into the ears of Jehovah amen as
[43:13] soon as the Lord began to consider their
[43:15] the cry of the people his mind drifted
[43:19] back to what the vision was before the
[43:21] foundation of the world his mind began
[43:24] to drift back to what the promise was
[43:26] what is it that I gave what probably is
[43:28] that promise I gave to Abraham
[43:30] what is it the where it was a condition
[43:32] what was the what was my vision say what
[43:36] was what was it that I had in my mind
[43:37] before the foundation of the world and
[43:39] as their cry began to rise up to Jehovah
[43:42] in God's mind we came in mind to deliver
[43:45] them but had a deliverance now now
[43:48] remember their cry would have been
[43:49] something like this Lord bring us back
[43:51] to Goshen Lord let us be back at peace
[43:54] and Goshen Lord take off this bondage
[43:56] from us let's go back to the land where
[43:58] we grew up in Goshen but God wasn't
[44:00] interested in bringing them back to
[44:02] peace and Goshen if God ever once
[44:05] delivers you he's his mind is to deliver
[44:09] you back to what the vision was if God
[44:12] ever once restores you he's not
[44:15] interested in giving you a half-hearted
[44:16] deliverance or a half-hearted
[44:18] restoration if God ever once is going to
[44:21] deliver you or ever what's going to heal
[44:24] you or ever once going to restore you
[44:26] his mind is going to restore you not
[44:28] back to what you want but back to what
[44:30] his vision was before the foundation of
[44:32] the world that is always God's response
[44:37] to the cries of bondage if your if your
[44:41] cry ever gives up to the Lord if your
[44:44] cry enters into his ears he's
[44:47] immediately gonna go back and consider
[44:49] what the promise is over your life amen
[44:54] and yet you might think Oh Lord I just
[44:56] want to be at peace I just want to be do
[44:57] this but I remember
[44:59] God has a vision for your life and he
[45:01] will do whatever it takes to get you
[45:03] back in compliance to that vision amen
[45:08] so because of that God's deliverance is
[45:12] sometimes look mighty strange amen
[45:17] sometimes the way God delivers us a she
[45:20] looks a little strange sometimes it gets
[45:24] worse Amen why because God is not just
[45:29] in a patch up business but God always
[45:33] has in his mind a total deliverance God
[45:37] always that has in his mind a total
[45:40] deliverance he's not interested in
[45:42] giving you a half way deliverance amen
[45:49] living outside of God's promises brings
[45:53] bondage I'm gonna repeat that living
[46:00] outside of God's promises no matter how
[46:02] peaceful it is no matter how wealthy you
[46:06] might see no matter how good you might
[46:08] have it living outside of God's promises
[46:12] brings bondage eventually it's going to
[46:15] happen sure as the world because God had
[46:18] a vision of you from before the
[46:20] foundation of the world
[46:21] and if you are ever catch yourself on
[46:24] the outside of that vision God wants to
[46:28] bring you back to restoration and he
[46:31] will do whatever it takes to get you
[46:33] there
[46:33] amen and let me tell you how God's
[46:35] vision is a beautiful thing
[46:38] God's vision is a beautiful thing it's
[46:40] God's vision that created all the things
[46:42] we enjoy in this world
[46:43] amen everything that we think if you
[46:45] think of all the beautiful pictures you
[46:47] see of all the places you'd love to go
[46:49] amen aim as I love to travel I'd love to
[46:53] see what God has created and every time
[46:54] I go to a new place I think my the
[46:57] beauty the variety of God but yet that
[47:00] same beauty of that same vision that
[47:02] created all that beauty created the
[47:04] vision that's resting upon my life amen
[47:07] and that vision will bring me to a place
[47:09] that's just as beautiful
[47:12] amen now the children of Israel you know
[47:14] they they didn't they didn't you know if
[47:16] they were to write the story themselves
[47:17] they probably wouldn't have written that
[47:19] they are gonna be embodied bondage for
[47:21] 400 years
[47:22] but God was writing a story God's
[47:25] writing a vision think about Jonah whose
[47:32] idea was it for Jonah to be in the belly
[47:34] of a whale it was God's idea
[47:39] now when Jonah was in that belly of the
[47:42] whale I don't know if he really thought
[47:43] too much you know he was in a good place
[47:46] but he was right where God 1 the Bible
[47:48] says that God created a special fish a
[47:51] man God had that in mind amen think
[47:55] about a Hannah Hannah wanted to have a
[47:58] child she had been married so many years
[48:01] and couldn't have any children do you
[48:04] know the Bible says how her womb got
[48:06] closed the Bible says God closed her
[48:10] womb but no God close the womb God
[48:15] closed the womb so what did the word
[48:18] wanted closing Hannah's womb cause it
[48:23] costs a cry
[48:25] it caused a cry and when that cry began
[48:30] to enter into the remember she went into
[48:33] the temple one day and she her in the
[48:35] and she was she had been got she'd gone
[48:38] long enough the cry had a certain pitch
[48:41] she was trusting the Lord so much and
[48:44] she was just crying the Lord and God
[48:45] finally answered her prayer and his mind
[48:48] immediately went back to you what the
[48:50] vision was and the vision was of a
[48:53] special child amen
[48:56] a special child and what to do God gave
[48:58] remember way every time in the Bible
[49:00] when someone couldn't have children when
[49:02] God gave them shorter and he gave them a
[49:04] special child amen my God always wants
[49:13] to bring them back you know you really
[49:17] can never be desperate until you get to
[49:21] a
[49:21] certain point God has to do certain
[49:24] things in your life to cause a
[49:26] desperation Amen but desperation or is
[49:30] the thing that brings you to lay
[49:32] everything aside and not be happy and go
[49:36] amen amen God is determined that will
[49:42] not be happy in Goshen so if you're
[49:47] living in Goshen right now let me tell
[49:49] you God is determined that you're not
[49:52] gonna stay happy in Goshen very long
[49:56] because God has a land of promise every
[50:01] single one of us should have in mind
[50:03] what the promises of God are and have a
[50:05] mind inside of us that cries out when we
[50:08] see things contrary to that vision
[50:10] Amen there's there's just something
[50:13] inside of me that when I see a promise
[50:16] in the word I just I gotta have it I
[50:18] just I cannot rest and tell us I just I
[50:22] want to see this Bible so manifest it
[50:25] you know when I witness you know I just
[50:28] let me just go down this path here for a
[50:29] second when I was when I was going to
[50:32] this particular denominational Church we
[50:35] decide one day that we were going to go
[50:37] door-to-door witnessing and we're gonna
[50:40] go knocking on door to door and I hated
[50:43] talking to people I was not a social
[50:45] person and but yeah they signed me up to
[50:48] go anyway and so I went and you know
[50:51] what I had nothin to say to the people I
[50:53] had never seen God move in my life
[50:54] before and I did not have a witness to
[50:57] testify of and Here I got all these
[51:00] friends I got it delivered them from
[51:02] drugs and deliver us from this and my
[51:05] testimony was I grew up in church you
[51:09] know what's my testimony but you know
[51:12] God eventually down the road showed me
[51:14] what my testimony was and he got to the
[51:17] point now it's where I have seen God do
[51:19] so much that my entire life is trusting
[51:23] in the gospel as someone once asked me
[51:27] not too long ago say well what's your
[51:28] type post what holds you down what do
[51:31] you have to hold on to the gospel I'm a
[51:34] Christian
[51:35] I hold on to the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[51:38] all I have to
[51:39] I just I'm at the point in my life to
[51:41] where that's all I had to hold on to
[51:43] because I know that he has a vision for
[51:46] me that is more beautiful than anything
[51:48] that I could try if I tried to write the
[51:51] story of my life I wouldn't write it as
[51:53] good as he's gonna write it Amen if I
[51:54] was trying to make it a little bit
[51:56] better I couldn't do it
[51:57] amen but God has a vision for us and God
[52:01] has particular ways to get us to enter
[52:03] into that vision let me tell you if
[52:06] you're reading your Bible if you're
[52:07] praying if you're if you're doing the
[52:09] things that are right and you have a
[52:10] desire upon your heart take it to God
[52:12] and prayer because God is a prayer
[52:16] answering God amen I just want let's
[52:19] just take a moment here and let's just
[52:21] go back into the scriptures real quick
[52:22] let's turn over to Romans 8:26
[52:40] Romans 8:26 and says likewise the spirit
[52:45] also helpeth our infirmities for we know
[52:51] not what we should pray for as we ought
[52:53] but the Spirit itself maketh
[52:56] intercession for us with groanings which
[52:58] cannot be uttered and he that searches
[53:01] the heart knoweth what is the mind of
[53:04] the Spirit because he maketh
[53:05] intercession for the Saints according to
[53:08] the will of God a man so this is the
[53:12] process we don't always necessarily know
[53:16] what we ought to pray for I think all of
[53:19] us could say that some guys we have
[53:21] burdens on our heart and we don't
[53:23] necessarily know what the right answer
[53:25] is we'll have something that we desire
[53:27] in our mind questions is this the will
[53:29] of God or not sometimes like like you
[53:33] think of think of your teenage years
[53:34] that's when the you get all these deep
[53:36] desires in your life but you always
[53:38] wonder well should I go this way or
[53:39] should I go that way or you know it's a
[53:41] it's a time of your life to where you're
[53:43] you're always wondering which direction
[53:45] should I go amen and you have these deep
[53:47] desires you know especially at 18 19 20
[53:50] 21 and trying to figure your life out
[53:52] and you have all these deep desires in
[53:54] your life but yet when you lift these
[53:56] this cry up to the Lord Lord take my
[53:59] life over what does the Holy Spirit do
[54:01] he grabs the hold of that cry and he
[54:05] makes intercession for you and he adds
[54:07] his cry to your cry amen and he makes
[54:11] intercession for you according to what
[54:13] the will of God and they all sudden your
[54:17] your prayer gets gets goes right up
[54:20] along the side of the Holy Spirit and he
[54:23] can kind of just grab that prayer and
[54:24] okay and go around the heavens with it
[54:27] amen and all of a sudden he answers that
[54:30] prayer according to the will of God amen
[54:35] let me tell you I had a lot of deep
[54:36] desires things I wanted to do things I
[54:38] wanted to be when I was growing up and
[54:40] God I can say without fail has
[54:42] constantly been answering my prayers
[54:44] throughout my whole life ever since I
[54:47] was a child I started reading my Bible -
[54:49] 13 years old everyday I've read almost
[54:51] every day since I was 13
[54:53] God has been throughout my life been
[54:55] answering my prayers I've seen it over
[54:58] and over again God has been answering my
[55:01] prayers he's been answering my Christ I
[55:03] know I know that it is possible I know
[55:06] who he is
[55:07] let no man trouble me I've seen Christ
[55:10] in action amen let's start one more
[55:21] scripture here real quick let's go to
[55:23] Exodus chapter 22 X's chapter 22 will
[55:34] read the 22nd verse
[55:48] it says ye shall not afflict any widow
[55:52] or fatherless child if they afflict them
[55:56] in any wise and they cry it all unto me
[56:00] I will surely hear their cry and my
[56:03] wrath shall wax hot and I will kill you
[56:06] with the sword my God's listening to the
[56:10] cries God is still listening to the
[56:14] Christ let me tell you when God's people
[56:16] begin to cry out because in their
[56:18] because they're in bondage doesn't
[56:20] matter what it is whether it be sickness
[56:22] if it's temptation if it's a passion in
[56:26] your life something maybe something you
[56:28] don't even know is right whether it's
[56:30] right or wrong you're not sure but if
[56:32] there is something that's bothering you
[56:34] something that's taking a hold of your
[56:36] mind that has put you in bondage that is
[56:39] taking you away from your focus in life
[56:41] or taking you away from your focus on
[56:44] God whatever it may be either that's not
[56:46] that bad of a thing if something has put
[56:49] you into bondage your cry will go up to
[56:52] the Lord
[56:53] and he'll answer according to his will
[56:56] amen he will always go back to what the
[56:59] vision is an answer according to the
[57:01] will of God he let says God's response
[57:04] is always to go back to his will he's
[57:07] not gonna bring you to Goshen he's not
[57:09] gonna try and give you peace and Goshen
[57:11] but he's gonna find out what's the will
[57:13] for Malachi's life
[57:15] what's the will for phurba livings life
[57:17] what's the will for soma so his life
[57:19] he's always gonna go back and foot look
[57:21] back to what the vision for your life
[57:23] was and he's gonna answer you according
[57:26] to what the vision is I'm glad that he
[57:29] does do that I'm glad that he does do
[57:31] that
[57:33] amen amen
[57:45] you know it's a funny thing about
[57:47] people's whenever they cry out there
[57:49] they almost always they cry out for
[57:52] partial deliverance
[57:56] it's funny how guys people are like that
[57:59] almost every time God's people begin to
[58:02] cry out they almost always cry out for a
[58:04] partial deliverance you know God's not
[58:07] in the business he doesn't provide
[58:09] partial deliverances that's not his
[58:12] business if God is ever gonna deliver
[58:15] you of anything he wants to knock you
[58:18] down and start over from scratch he
[58:21] wants a total deliverance he wants to
[58:24] deliver you so much to the point that
[58:27] you will say there's no way I could
[58:30] deliver myself out of that that was
[58:32] nothing but the hand of the Almighty God
[58:36] amen because God will share his glory
[58:38] with no one amen so when you began
[58:41] crying out to the Lord and things began
[58:43] to look worse in your life don't worry
[58:45] God has God has something in the a in
[58:49] the works but he has this vision in his
[58:52] mind that he's bringing you to so just
[58:55] be patient with him just be patient with
[58:57] him so you don't end up like those are
[58:59] murmured in the wilderness because they
[59:01] may have been crying out oh Lord
[59:03] Goshen was so wonderful we heard the
[59:05] stories of Goshen why are we going this
[59:07] way
[59:08] because there was a promise that God had
[59:10] the way back before the foundation of
[59:12] the world and God was bringing them to
[59:14] that promise Amen it's worth the journey
[59:20] it is worth let me tell you that if
[59:22] you're wore out by the journey through
[59:24] the wilderness it is worth there is a
[59:26] blessing on the other end just be
[59:28] patient just keep going there's a
[59:30] blessing on the other end because God
[59:32] has a perfect response to the cries of
[59:35] bondage and it's to go back to the will
[59:37] of God amen once you get there you'll be
[59:40] you'll be you'll look back you say I'm
[59:41] glad I made it all the way I'm glad I
[59:44] made it to the other side I'm glad I
[59:47] Malad I made it to the Swiss Way amen
[59:50] amen
[59:53] [Music]
[59:55] a man whenever you cry whenever your cry
[59:59] Inter's God's ear the Holy Spirit begins
[1:00:02] to cry but he only is to go back
[1:00:05] according to the vision yes I wanted to
[1:00:09] read this quote a brother brand was
[1:00:10] coming from a total deliverance he says
[1:00:16] just like you if you are a Christian God
[1:00:21] doesn't make any halfway Christians do
[1:00:25] you believe that God doesn't make
[1:00:27] halfway Christians a man if you're
[1:00:30] living in half way kind of life let me
[1:00:32] tell you God doesn't make you like that
[1:00:34] amen you're living in bondage to
[1:00:36] something amen let me tell you if you go
[1:00:39] on living a half way life he might have
[1:00:42] to knock you down pretty far to get you
[1:00:43] out of that thing amen it's not always
[1:00:46] pretty pretty when someone tries to
[1:00:48] straddle the fence it's not always
[1:00:50] pretty when they come out of it okay but
[1:00:52] they'll get out of it
[1:00:53] amen God makes complete Christians God
[1:00:58] don't make halfway preachers but the
[1:01:00] preacher can be halfway and God makes
[1:01:04] his children Christians but sometimes
[1:01:06] they're halfway Christians but it's not
[1:01:09] God's intention for them to be that way
[1:01:12] but if they're always got mixed up with
[1:01:16] the plan of God for their life and
[1:01:19] that's what makes them the way they are
[1:01:21] God don't want them to be halfway
[1:01:24] Christians or halfway preachers
[1:01:27] compromising on either side he wants
[1:01:30] them to stand completely in the breech
[1:01:33] by let me tell you what every time

[1:04:18] absolute Christians for his namesake
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:24] amen God's response is always to bring
[1:04:29] you he has a burden to bring you back to
[1:04:32] the word a man when he searches your
[1:04:35] hearts and he sees that you're off the
[1:04:37] word a little bit he beings cry out for
[1:04:39] you

[1:04:42] responsibility to lay your life down and
[1:04:44] go with him in submission back to the
[1:04:47] vision back to the word Amen he wants to
[1:04:49] bring you back to compliance to the Word
[1:04:52] of God amen God is not interested in
[1:04:54] giving you peace in Egypt amen remember
[1:04:58] the Bible says if your riches increase
[1:05:00] set not your heart upon them a man yells
[1:05:03] things sometimes can get so comfortable
[1:05:06] in Goshen a man Senayan is what I'm
[1:05:09] driving down the road you know I was
[1:05:11] like oh I'm getting a little cold in
[1:05:12] here and I reach out my hand and I just
[1:05:14] turn the dial and up with a couple
[1:05:17] degrees and starting to feel a little
[1:05:19] bit better you know and I just Mar like
[1:05:22] Laura we're so so coddled sometimes you
[1:05:27] know we're just so cozy sometimes like
[1:05:29] oh it's getting a little warm I can just
[1:05:30] turn the knob a couple degrees the other
[1:05:32] way you know or I walk into a room
[1:05:34] that's darkened and and I just turned
[1:05:37] the light on and light fills the room
[1:05:38] but you know and those are just
[1:05:40] temporary blessings amen because but the
[1:05:43] vision is is that we're going to a city
[1:05:46] where the lamb is like a man so no
[1:05:49] matter how much we enjoy the light
[1:05:50] switch on the wall we're not here to
[1:05:52] enjoy the life switch unless it's a
[1:05:54] temporary blessing that's a blessing of
[1:05:56] goshen we're going to a city where the
[1:05:59] lamb is the light amen we're going to a
[1:06:01] city where it's 72 degrees all the time
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:05] we're going to a city where where we
[1:06:07] don't need to control the temperature
[1:06:08] amen God's got it all under control
[1:06:11] amen we're going to a city where God
[1:06:13] said before you cry out to me I will
[1:06:16] answer my won't that be a blessing Amen
[1:06:20] right now we cry out why we get off the
[1:06:22] word we're going down this way God has
[1:06:24] something he wants to teach us something
[1:06:25] he wants to show us and he's gotta get
[1:06:27] our mind off the world long enough and
[1:06:30] by getting them maybe into bondage of
[1:06:32] something maybe a little get a little
[1:06:33] bit over on this way or a little
[1:06:35] this way because yes our mind has to get
[1:06:38] just like Hannah's guy get your mind on
[1:06:40] something and the the cry has to he
[1:06:43] reach a certain pitch and all sudden God
[1:06:45] moves on the scene a man there we get to
[1:06:48] see him in action all over again
[1:06:49] a man so don't don't worry when you see
[1:06:52] yourself getting into these situations
[1:06:53] don't you know don't know fret
[1:06:56] don't despair don't count it like Oh
[1:06:58] Lord I'm law so just say Lord I'm gonna
[1:07:00] start crying out to you all over again
[1:07:03] Oh Lord Here I am again Lord once more
[1:07:06] entering into my prayer closet Lord I
[1:07:08] don't know what happens somehow I got
[1:07:10] off over here again Lord somehow I got
[1:07:12] off over here again Lord I didn't mean
[1:07:13] to Lord I didn't want to be over here

[1:07:18] again over here a little bit Lord but
[1:07:19] Lord I'm crying back to you Lord I'm
[1:07:23] coming back to you and Lord it and I'm
[1:07:25] Lord might let my cry enter into your
[1:07:28] ears and let me know when it gets to
[1:07:30] that point oh my things are getting
[1:07:33] ready to happen because the thing of it
[1:07:36] is is you might have something in your
[1:07:37] mind that you want to get back to a
[1:07:39] certain type of deliverance but God has
[1:07:42] something in his mind you have even
[1:07:44] considered a man and that cry is gonna
[1:07:47] start some processes in motion that you
[1:07:49] can't even imagine what they are let me
[1:07:52] tell you when God's children were crying
[1:07:54] to go back to peace and Goshen they
[1:07:58] couldn't even vision the blessings of
[1:07:59] Solomon's Temple let me tell you there's
[1:08:03] no way they could have thought about the
[1:08:06] blessings of the cloud coming down
[1:08:09] there's no way they could have thought
[1:08:11] of the blessings of Joshua sitting there
[1:08:14] at the tabernacle outside the outside
[1:08:16] the campus as the president law came
[1:08:19] down in a field the place there's no way
[1:08:22] they could consider that but you know
[1:08:23] and those things are so much better than
[1:08:25] Goshen why wouldn't you have liked to
[1:08:29] have been there when Solomon was
[1:08:30] dedicating the temple well he began cry
[1:08:33] now and he said Oh Lord
[1:08:35] I am dedicating this place to you it
[1:08:39] seems like such a small thing for a
[1:08:41] people to create a house for God a
[1:08:45] dwelling when God he doesn't even dwell
[1:08:47] in houses
[1:08:49] you made the earth and here we and our
[1:08:51] futile attempts tried to create a house
[1:08:53] for you but nevertheless Lord here we've
[1:08:55] created this house for you and Lord
[1:08:58] nanus and saltless of Solomon's cry to
[1:09:00] the to the Lord was Lord if any of your
[1:09:05] people ever have a need I pray father
[1:09:08] that they could walk through the doors
[1:09:10] of this place if they walk through the
[1:09:13] doors of this place and they have
[1:09:15] respect unto your name in the name of
[1:09:17] Jehovah and they get down to this altar
[1:09:21] and they cry out to you Lord I pray Lord
[1:09:23] that you would hear from heaven and
[1:09:24] answer their prayer and in Solomon's he
[1:09:27] said in furthermore Lord I pray father
[1:09:29] that even if a stranger from another
[1:09:30] land comes to this place now if he would
[1:09:34] just come into this house even though he
[1:09:35] be a stranger if you just come into this
[1:09:38] house and have respects under the name
[1:09:39] of Jehovah and cry out to you at this
[1:09:42] altar Lord that you hear from heaven an
[1:09:44] answer is prayer I pray Lord you would
[1:09:48] hear him and heal his land when they
[1:09:52] were in Goshen they couldn't fathom that
[1:09:53] and let me tell you and neither can we
[1:09:56] when we're living in a lukewarm
[1:09:58] condition neither we can we fathom a
[1:10:02] time in our lives where all we have to
[1:10:04] do is just close her eyes and cry out
[1:10:06] and God answers our prayer like that can
[1:10:10] you imagine that
[1:10:11] but God has it free God has that for me
[1:10:16] God has a walk for you brother Branham
[1:10:21] said that the disciples knew that way of
[1:10:23] living Twitter is just one little nod
[1:10:26] from the Lord and there go about his
[1:10:29] business with that is that a good place
[1:10:33] to be in one little nod from the Lord
[1:10:36] wake up in the morning Lord Here I am
[1:10:38] your righteous servant father I've
[1:10:41] washed my sins in your blood
[1:10:42] Lord I've tried to keep my life clean
[1:10:44] the best I know how and Laura de here is
[1:10:47] another morning and I am sacrificing my
[1:10:49] life again Lord I am here to be at your
[1:10:52] service let that cry in it up to the
[1:10:55] Lord what could he do with that and all
[1:10:57] sudden that cry it starts going up to
[1:11:00] before the altar Lord and it goes up
[1:11:02] where the blood
[1:11:02] Glamis makes intercession for all your
[1:11:05] faults and failures oh my and then god
[1:11:08] doesn't even see your faults and
[1:11:09] failures anymore and the Holy Spirit
[1:11:10] grabs a hold that cry and he starts
[1:11:12] moving on your behalf and he and God
[1:11:15] looks back oh what's the vision four
[1:11:17] four four four sister Wendy's life and
[1:11:20] he looks back he sees what that vision
[1:11:22] is that's there's the vision there's
[1:11:25] something waiting for her in the wings
[1:11:27] maybe as I grab ahold of your life and
[1:11:29] steer you that direction and when the
[1:11:33] thing comes to place it's more beautiful
[1:11:34] in the mountains of Colorado it's more
[1:11:36] beautiful in the oceans of the South
[1:11:38] Pacific
[1:11:38] a man why because it's the perfect will
[1:11:41] of God for your life
[1:11:42] amen amen God has a walk for you amen
[1:11:47] but when we began to cry out to the Lord
[1:11:50] God and mediate connect cry causes God
[1:11:54] to go back and review the vision for
[1:11:57] your life I'm gonna repeat what we said
[1:12:01] in the beginning God's response to the
[1:12:05] cries of bondage is to go back and
[1:12:09] review the vision he has for your life
[1:12:13] and it's your cry that causes that
[1:12:16] review so if you would like to if you've
[1:12:20] been living a lukewarm Laodicean life if
[1:12:23] you--if when you read revelations 3:14
[1:12:27] where he says that you know that there
[1:12:30] are lukewarm they're cold there or
[1:12:32] they're not caught they're not cold he
[1:12:34] wants to spew them out of their mouth
[1:12:35] there they're comfortable they're
[1:12:37] enjoying their riches they it's been a
[1:12:39] while they're not praying like they used
[1:12:41] to they're not witnessing they don't
[1:12:43] enjoy the joy the Lord as their strength
[1:12:45] anymore when people get to that
[1:12:46] condition that's not God's vision for
[1:12:49] your life but when you get to that
[1:12:52] condition and you begin crying out to
[1:12:54] the Lord all sudden that cry starts a
[1:12:57] chain of events and let me tell you you
[1:13:01] just keep crying out to Lord and that
[1:13:04] chain of events will the high Sparrow
[1:13:06] come up on your side and pull you back
[1:13:08] into the vision of God it's a beautiful
[1:13:12] thing since I've seen it over and over
[1:13:14] in my life it's a beautiful thing
[1:13:16] boys spare you've been crying out for a
[1:13:18] while and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:13:19] Spirit just comes up by your side and he
[1:13:21] turns you like oh that's the way I'm
[1:13:23] supposed to go and there you are back on
[1:13:26] the path back going towards the vision
[1:13:29] of the Almighty God and a little while
[1:13:32] down the road you look back you think oh
[1:13:33] my you know the Bible or a brother man
[1:13:36] says you know sometimes you have to do
[1:13:38] something for God to honor a man
[1:13:42] sometimes you just have to do something
[1:13:44] for God honor
[1:13:45] you know and all of us we get to that
[1:13:47] point in our lives where we at we just
[1:13:49] have to do something to give God honor
[1:13:51] the other is lose there's times in my
[1:13:53] life where if I need a response from God
[1:13:55] there's just little things I do there
[1:13:57] little tokens I have in my own life to
[1:13:59] where I do them for the Lord because
[1:14:01] lord I need an answer from you and
[1:14:02] there's little things that I do that
[1:14:04] because like Lord when I do this I am
[1:14:07] entering into your presence father Lord
[1:14:09] when I'm doing this I'm looking only
[1:14:11] towards you you know sometimes I'll just
[1:14:13] paste about the floor with my the Bible
[1:14:15] to my face cuz lord I am focusing on
[1:14:18] your word alone Lord you know I just
[1:14:20] have little things idea why because I'm
[1:14:21] always wanting to bring my just let's do
[1:14:24] something that God can honor do a little
[1:14:27] something that God can are a little
[1:14:29] token of me because God gives us tokens
[1:14:31] we can give God tokens Amen God gave us
[1:14:35] a token of the Holy Ghost which is a
[1:14:37] down payment of the future home right
[1:14:39] amen and we can give God tokens of a
[1:14:42] little surrender over here
[1:14:43] amen are a little surrender over here
[1:14:46] Laura give this little little I'm gonna
[1:14:48] give a blessing to this person over here
[1:14:50] Lord because I need a blessing over here
[1:14:52] amen amen Lord I need this over here so
[1:14:56] I'm going to be a blessing to that over
[1:14:58] this person over there amen I need help
[1:15:01] of my life song I pray for brother
[1:15:03] so-and-so in his life hey man I'm gonna
[1:15:06] do this Lord so that you can honor
[1:15:09] give give respect to the honor I give to
[1:15:11] someone else a man sometimes you have to
[1:15:13] do something for God to honor so if you
[1:15:20] find yourself where your prayers are
[1:15:22] always selfish it's good to do that so
[1:15:25] that God has something that he can
[1:15:26] respond to something that he can honor
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:30] amen amen
[1:15:40] I'm air one time I had a need of we
[1:15:43] didn't have a lot of money and I had a
[1:15:47] little bit and I knew someone needed
[1:15:49] money more than me I knew they wouldn't
[1:15:53] receive it and so I got together with
[1:15:57] them and and I just put a little bit of
[1:16:00] money in an envelope and I and I knew
[1:16:03] that there was no way they would ever
[1:16:05] receive it they were the type of person
[1:16:06] they would just throw on the ground if
[1:16:07] you try to give it to him you know they
[1:16:08] just there's no way they would receive
[1:16:10] it and so I met him for for dinner one
[1:16:13] time and I asked him I said how much did
[1:16:18] Christ's death cost what did it cost him
[1:16:25] it cost him everything he had a right to
[1:16:29] keep on living and he gave up his rights
[1:16:32] it cost him everything I said I said
[1:16:36] brother have you received the life of
[1:16:38] Christ he says yes I said have you
[1:16:42] received the blood of Christ for your
[1:16:44] sins he said yes
[1:16:47] I said don't you realize that that costs
[1:16:50] him everything and you're just taking it
[1:16:54] and he said yes I said well here I'll
[1:16:58] this is just a little token if you can
[1:17:00] accept the blood of Christ you can
[1:17:01] receive this and he couldn't refuse
[1:17:10] couple weeks later someone sideswiped my
[1:17:13] car but the damage was so minor that it
[1:17:20] wasn't even worth bothering about and I
[1:17:23] was trying to get the person just to
[1:17:25] drive off and they wouldn't do it they
[1:17:26] insisted on calling the police it was
[1:17:29] their fault and so they called the
[1:17:31] police and then I just let it go and
[1:17:33] then but she had my phone number
[1:17:35] little while they're there insurance
[1:17:37] agent called me one look at my car I
[1:17:39] said well it's not that much damage to
[1:17:42] it and so he comes he look
[1:17:43] at my car and he totals it out gives me
[1:17:48] a check for the entire car and after a
[1:17:54] winter of rain all the ski those few
[1:17:56] scuff marks on the side and after a
[1:17:58] winter rain they all had washed away
[1:18:00] without having me doing anything the the
[1:18:02] doors bent and I took my hand I pulled
[1:18:04] out and it like popped right back in
[1:18:06] place he could even tell they ever bend
[1:18:07] in it and and after about six months a
[1:18:10] demon looked like it ever been hit and
[1:18:12] the search search agent and the Mel was
[1:18:15] about 150 percent away just given to the
[1:18:18] brother week before but I knew someone I
[1:18:22] needed it something but I knew someone
[1:18:24] they needed something a little bit more
[1:18:26] amen I did something for God to honor
[1:18:30] and sometimes we I do just do a little
[1:18:33] something for God to honor a man give a
[1:18:36] little prayer for somebody else go to
[1:18:38] the go to your prayer closet for half an
[1:18:40] hour for somebody else do something for
[1:18:42] to honor for somebody else
[1:18:44] so the God could have respect to you
[1:18:46] amen and as you do for someone else God
[1:18:49] will do for you
[1:18:50] amen amen but if you have something in
[1:18:54] your life a deep bird in your life give
[1:18:56] it to the Lord just keep crying out and
[1:18:58] when your cry reaches that certain pitch
[1:19:00] he always answers I've seen it without
[1:19:05] fail when the people begin to cry out
[1:19:08] before Lord telling me search the Old
[1:19:10] Testament search the New Testament when
[1:19:12] men and women were crying out to God
[1:19:14] what always happens God answers isn't
[1:19:20] that the pattern do you think that after
[1:19:22] 6,000 years of God answering people he's
[1:19:25] gonna quit with you no no he's gonna
[1:19:30] keep on listening amen and remember once
[1:19:34] you begin crying out to the Lord when
[1:19:36] your cry hits that certain pitch it
[1:19:39] starts a chain of events that cannot be
[1:19:42] stopped
[1:19:45] say brother cannot be stopped now think
[1:19:48] about it think about the charter of
[1:19:50] Israel living in Goshen did they try to
[1:19:54] stop the chain of events
[1:19:57] how much idolatry between was there
[1:20:00] between them and the promised land
[1:20:02] how many golden calves how much idol
[1:20:06] worship
[1:20:06] how much foolishness how many sacrifices
[1:20:10] how many adulteries did they commit how
[1:20:13] much turning around how much crying out
[1:20:15] for Egypt did they do but yet their cry
[1:20:18] that they cried back in Egypt started a
[1:20:22] chain of events and action that could
[1:20:24] not be stopped a man and I want to tell
[1:20:28] you Saints they're crying out to God
[1:20:30] we'll start a chain of events in your
[1:20:33] life that cannot be stopped but that
[1:20:36] chain that but that response is not
[1:20:38] necessarily what you think it's gonna be
[1:20:39] that response is gonna be back to what
[1:20:42] the will of God is for your life hey man
[1:20:46] I hope that's what you want because I
[1:20:48] think that's what you're gonna get amen
[1:20:52] that's what you're gonna get
[1:20:54] amen and I'm glad that he does that it
[1:20:59] takes all the guesswork out of it a man
[1:21:02] it takes all the guesswork out because I
[1:21:04] don't necessarily know what God has for
[1:21:05] me the rest of my life I don't really
[1:21:07] know I never I never once in my life
[1:21:10] pictured me where I am today and I know
[1:21:12] 10 years from now I'll be somewhere like
[1:21:14] a man imagine right now but I do know
[1:21:17] one thing that placed my life in the
[1:21:19] hands of the Lord a man so I know
[1:21:21] whatever does happen it's in his hands
[1:21:24] amen amen and whatever comes to me upon
[1:21:27] life's journey I'm just gonna place my
[1:21:30] concerns upon the altar of the Lord and
[1:21:32] I'm gonna keep placing them there and if
[1:21:34] I any need I have upon life's journey I
[1:21:37] just place it upon the altar of the Lord
[1:21:39] and I cry out to him and I know that
[1:21:40] he'll answer me according to Romans
[1:21:42] chapter 8 the Holy Spirit will cry out
[1:21:45] with me and he will hijack my prayer and
[1:21:49] bring her right back into compliance
[1:21:51] with the will of God
[1:21:53] isn't that beautiful God can hijack your
[1:21:56] prayers yes that's what Romans what we
[1:21:58] read there in Romans 8 God will hijack
[1:22:00] your prayer let's turn back there I'm
[1:22:02] not gonna be much longer here Saints but
[1:22:03] let's just turn back to that I want to
[1:22:05] read it again I think it bears repeating
[1:22:13] Romans 8:26 it says likewise the spirit
[1:22:17] also helps our infirmities amen whatever
[1:22:21] is wrong with you the hit on the Holy
[1:22:23] Spirit here is to help you amen because
[1:22:26] why why because we do not why is he help
[1:22:28] us and tell us helping ourselves because
[1:22:31] we don't know how we should pray as we
[1:22:35] should we just don't know so what does
[1:22:38] he do it doesn't mean we should stop
[1:22:40] praying we keep on praying but the Holy
[1:22:43] Spirit joins himself to our prayer and
[1:22:46] he makes intercession for us and now
[1:22:49] it's not just us praying but he's
[1:22:51] praying with us and his prayer goes up
[1:22:53] to heaven with our prayer Wow isn't that
[1:22:57] powerful his prayer goes up to heaven
[1:23:00] where took with his with our prayer and
[1:23:03] where does that prayer go it goes up to
[1:23:07] the altar where the blood of the Lamb is
[1:23:09] and the blood of the land was sacrificed
[1:23:11] for the answer for your prayer a man so
[1:23:15] don't ever doubt that God hears your
[1:23:17] prayers because the blood of the Lamb
[1:23:19] gave God permission to hear your prayer
[1:23:21] amen the blood of the Lamb gave God
[1:23:25] permission to hear your cry amen and so
[1:23:28] when you're and when you cry the OI
[1:23:31] spirit's prayer joins up with your
[1:23:33] prayer goes up to the altar where the
[1:23:34] blood of lamb is and he makes
[1:23:35] intercession for you what according to
[1:23:38] what the vision of God is for your life
[1:23:40] and it starts a chain of events in your
[1:23:44] life that cannot be stopped
[1:23:47] it's beautiful let me say it to the
[1:23:50] young children it's beautiful to the
[1:23:52] teenagers it's beautiful yes just keep
[1:23:55] watching just keep reading just keep
[1:23:56] praying if you have something that you
[1:23:58] want in life put it upon the altar Lord
[1:24:02] I'm placing this prayer upon the altar
[1:24:03] Lord I got this desire in my life I
[1:24:06] don't know if it's in your will or not
[1:24:07] Lord but I got this desire and I don't
[1:24:09] know what to do with it so I'm just
[1:24:11] gonna place it upon the altar Lord I'm
[1:24:13] gonna see how you answer it Lord this
[1:24:15] I'm putting it at your mercy Lord answer
[1:24:18] it according to your will Oh God let it
[1:24:20] start that chain of events sometimes I
[1:24:22] give God
[1:24:23] a little bit of that little gods waiting
[1:24:26] for you to do something like that so he
[1:24:28] can move alongside and join his prayer
[1:24:30] with yours you have to give God you have
[1:24:33] to do something for God to honor a man
[1:24:36] why so that he can get the glory so when
[1:24:39] you bring the testimony later on amen I
[1:24:42] cried to the Lord and he heard my cry
[1:24:44] and delivered me amen
[1:24:47] as Noah says in the Psalms over and over
[1:24:50] and over again God heard my cry God
[1:24:52] heard my cry amen amen God doesn't make
[1:24:59] halfway Christians he makes total
[1:25:01] Christians a man they cry out for a
[1:25:03] total deliverance amen nothing less but
[1:25:08] a total deliverance amen amen amen like
[1:25:16] Joby the end result is your situation
[1:25:18] might get worse but in the end it'll be
[1:25:21] a promised land it'll be the promised
[1:25:24] land hey man I just I want to close here
[1:25:28] on this one scripture I know I I think
[1:25:30] I've read this a few times when I come
[1:25:31] here but I want to read Psalms 18 again
[1:25:33] I think I probably read this Psalm
[1:25:36] almost every time I come I don't know
[1:25:37] but
[1:25:46] this all means a lot for me because I
[1:25:47] have a lot of testimonies I have a lot
[1:25:51] of testimonies of times when God heard
[1:25:53] my prayer and my brother even testified
[1:25:55] though just a little bit ago in the
[1:25:57] office there about how last time I was
[1:25:59] here we were sharing some testimonies
[1:26:01] and and he took one of those testimonies
[1:26:04] he had a situation it was similar in his
[1:26:07] life and so he my prayer gave him
[1:26:12] permission to pray the same way
[1:26:15] sometimes we need that we hear a brother
[1:26:19] or sister that prays and gets a certain
[1:26:21] response like oh my I didn't know I
[1:26:23] could ask for that I think I'll ask for
[1:26:25] that amen and and so he prayed the same
[1:26:29] prayer and the same prayer work for him
[1:26:30] too
[1:26:31] amen amen
[1:26:34] this here is one of my favorite Psalms
[1:26:37] in the Bible Psalms 18 it means a lot to
[1:26:40] me because in verse 6 there it has one
[1:26:45] verse where David describes his prayer
[1:26:50] in verse an 18-6 there says in my
[1:26:54] distress I called upon the Lord and
[1:26:57] cried unto my God and he heard my voice
[1:27:01] out of his temple and my cry came before
[1:27:05] him even into his ears and one thing I
[1:27:10] want you to know about this scripture is
[1:27:12] every single one of us has to have the
[1:27:15] exact same faith that when you pray the
[1:27:20] same thing happens to your prayer every
[1:27:25] single one of us has to have that same
[1:27:27] faith that when you pray your prayer
[1:27:30] when it leaves your lips it doesn't stop
[1:27:32] at the roof but it goes into the temple
[1:27:35] of the Most High God and enters into the
[1:27:37] ears of the Lord Amen and it causes him
[1:27:41] to look back to the vision for your life
[1:27:44] amen
[1:27:45] and so one little verse there describes
[1:27:48] David's prayer but the next I think it's
[1:27:54] the next eleven verses describe God's
[1:27:56] reaction
[1:27:59] what the next 11 verses say this is
[1:28:02] God's reaction in verse 7 to David's
[1:28:05] little prayer it says and then the earth
[1:28:07] shook and trembled the foundations of
[1:28:10] the hills were moved and were shaken
[1:28:13] because he was wroth there went up a
[1:28:15] smoke out of his nostrils and fire of
[1:28:17] his mouth devour colt coals were kindled
[1:28:19] by it he bowed the heavens also and came
[1:28:22] down and darkness was under his feet he
[1:28:26] did ride upon shara but he did fly yeah
[1:28:28] he flew upon the wings of the wind
[1:28:31] he made darkness his secret place his
[1:28:33] pavilion round about him were dark
[1:28:35] waters and thick clouds of skies and
[1:28:37] brightness was before him his sick
[1:28:39] clouds passed hail stones and coals of
[1:28:42] fire and the Lord also thundered in the
[1:28:44] heavens and the highest gave his voice
[1:28:47] hail stones and coals of fire yeah he
[1:28:50] sent out his arrows and scattered them
[1:28:52] he shot out lightnings and discomfort of
[1:28:55] them now think about us Saints he's
[1:28:57] still this is just an answer Davis
[1:28:58] prayer this is how a guys are spying to
[1:29:02] what David needed you imagine you're a
[1:29:05] little prayer having God respond in this
[1:29:08] way to one of your prayers
[1:29:09] it can happen God will move heaven and
[1:29:13] earth for you because you are his son
[1:29:15] and daughter amen and then the channels
[1:29:19] of the waters were seeing the
[1:29:20] foundations of the world were discovered
[1:29:22] at thy rebuke O Lord at that at the
[1:29:25] blast of the breath of the nostrils he
[1:29:27] sent from above he took me he drew me
[1:29:29] out of many waters he delivered me I
[1:29:32] love this verse here he delivered me
[1:29:34] from my strong enemy and from them which
[1:29:37] hated me for they were too strong for me
[1:29:40] and that little thing and it keeps going
[1:29:44] on and on and on Saints you can just
[1:29:47] keep you can read that one he at home
[1:29:48] but that is God's response this big long
[1:29:53] multi-verse response to this one little
[1:29:56] one verse prayer I cried unto the Lord
[1:29:59] and my prayer went up into his temple
[1:30:01] and God came down on the scene for my
[1:30:04] behalf
[1:30:06] every single one of us if we're going to
[1:30:09] be a Christian has to have this
[1:30:11] testimony
[1:30:13] they've been something that God did for
[1:30:18] us that we could not do for ourselves
[1:30:21] where God came down and heard our prayer
[1:30:25] and sometimes you know like Jonah
[1:30:28] I love Jonah
[1:30:33] sometimes I like to think of myself kind
[1:30:35] of like Jonah you know can you imagine
[1:30:38] Jonah he knew he was a prophet of the
[1:30:41] Most High God he knew that God spoke to
[1:30:44] him he heard things that nobody else
[1:30:47] heard he heard the voice of God for his
[1:30:49] age
[1:30:51] Amen well that's a powerful thing but
[1:30:54] instead of going the way the voice of
[1:30:56] God said he went the other way how would
[1:31:00] you feel in that situation Lord why
[1:31:04] can't I be as faithful as Enoch Lord why
[1:31:09] can't I be as faithful as Moses or why
[1:31:12] can't I be more like Abraham I could
[1:31:14] just hear Jonah no Laura why can't why
[1:31:16] is it when you say to go this way I go
[1:31:18] that way and Harry enters into the ship
[1:31:22] and the storm starts raging and he's
[1:31:24] like and he's telling the men that are
[1:31:27] sailing the boat he says all of this
[1:31:30] guy's is because of me
[1:31:32] guys angry with me and I'm like well
[1:31:33] what did you do to make the God of
[1:31:36] heaven upset and he says I was just so
[1:31:39] goddamn Ile if tear and I disobeyed him
[1:31:43] I wouldn't he said to go right I don't
[1:31:46] know what left however many people hear
[1:31:49] the voice of God but he was the one that
[1:31:51] heard it and he was disobedient to it
[1:31:54] and so he says the God of heaven is
[1:31:57] Rossa me bind me up and cast me into the
[1:32:00] sea and the Seas will become calm as
[1:32:02] glass a man so they banging up his hands
[1:32:05] behind his back and they throw him into
[1:32:06] the sea and they say Oh Lord God forgive
[1:32:09] us we wash our hands of this man a man
[1:32:12] as he sinks us God prepares a special
[1:32:15] fish and he's in the belly of the fish
[1:32:17] for three days and three nights and you
[1:32:19] know what as much as Jonah thought he
[1:32:22] was like Lord why am i this such a
[1:32:24] disobedient prophet
[1:32:26] God made that disobedient prophet a type
[1:32:29] in a shadow of the most obedient to be
[1:32:33] ever be done upon the earth when Jesus
[1:32:36] Christ went willingly to the cross
[1:32:40] sacrifice 33 years of his life never
[1:32:44] once committing a sin though he was
[1:32:46] tempted constantly have you ever been
[1:32:50] tempted so much so you just gave in he
[1:32:56] just gave in and the temptation went
[1:32:58] away because you gave in to it you have
[1:33:00] a little bit of momentary reprieve from
[1:33:02] your temptation because you gave in to
[1:33:05] it
[1:33:05] jesus never did that suffered 33 years
[1:33:10] of his life suffering through temptation
[1:33:12] after temptation temptation after
[1:33:15] temptation never once giving in my the
[1:33:19] most obedient is says face like a flint
[1:33:21] to the cross obedient to the end laid
[1:33:27] down his life he said as Jonah was in
[1:33:29] the belly of the whale three days and
[1:33:31] three nights so shall the Son of Man be
[1:33:34] in the belly of the earth because I'm
[1:33:36] gonna let a type I'm gonna let the most
[1:33:39] disobedient prophet be a shadow a type
[1:33:42] of the most obedient act poor Jonah
[1:33:45] didn't know I don't think he knew at
[1:33:48] that time and what he was doing was
[1:33:50] typing out the most obedient air act
[1:33:51] ever to be done upon the earth so don't
[1:33:55] be discouraged just keep following the
[1:33:57] Lord if you're in bondage to something
[1:34:00] if you're doing something you shouldn't
[1:34:02] be doing lay it upon the altar cry out
[1:34:05] to him lay it upon the altar say Lord

[1:34:10] want to get back to where you are back
[1:34:12] to where the will of God is from and
[1:34:14] that cry will enter up into the heavens
[1:34:16] a man and God will respond to make a
[1:34:19] heavy response in your behalf amen and
[1:34:21] bring you back to the vision that he had
[1:34:23] of your life before the foundation of
[1:34:25] the world amen if God has ever once
[1:34:28] tugged at your hearts door Amen then he
[1:34:31] has a vision for your life respond
