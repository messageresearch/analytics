going right now Church ages Ephesians and worship seriously just kind of thought about this morning after prayer go in this direction I hope you enjoy the thoughts here that the Lord has for us tonight this is part eleven Fijians chapter three verse 13 visions 3:13 now we'll start a 13 but actually why don't I start teaching on 13 but let's go to verse 20 let's just read 20 and 21 that's what I think we're gonna spend the most of our time as I studied a thoughts kind of kept flowing out of that scripture verse 20 so we'll spend I think most of our time in verse 20 and 21 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US let's read 21 together one two three unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end glory how many one to give Him glory in all ages well I know I can give him glory in the Laodicean Church age I know that and then if we're faithful in this age we'll be able to give him glory all ages all throughout eternity let's just bar as and word of Prayer everything on your heart making known into God here tonight Heavenly Father Lord our eyes are closed we're praying Jesus we love you Jesus speak to us Jesus we give you glory hallelujah help us to glorify your name tonight Lord Jesus and father's speak to us through this holy word which we know millions have shed their blood to give us this word thank you Lord God may you speak to us Lord may show us that you'll do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask her thing help us only Lord to dwell in Christ help us to let the power of God work in us for Lord we're grateful to be here tonight and we love you Lord Jesus minister now to us by the Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless your being seated there praise God okay so let's smell it you can switch over when you're ready thanks yeah thanks again Lidia Malachi for all your help he's in chapter 3 this is part 11 we'll look at this tonight by God's grace how many can hardly believe we're almost in December this year how many cannot hard to believe that hard to believe by God's grace okay and we're looking forward to the Word of God here tonight did you try it I'm sorry Mac I could do that again I don't know if it came up or not I want to look at this thought like I said I want to focus on the exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think I prepared some slides okay there we go praise the Lord thank you children appreciate that look into part 11 I remember there's three themes we're still dealing with this second theme right here the one body of Christ both the Jew and Gentile so we're talking about the blessings of being in this body tonight and that and see after tonight Lord willing if we finished tonight we'll go to chapter 4 and then we'll get into the third theme the walk and the warfare now the walk is in chapter 4 and 5 the Warfare's in chapter 6 is your pride familiar with in the book of Ephesians now remember part 10 the last time about two weeks ago we focused on the fellowship of the mystery which was the intimacy of the mystery which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost God wanted such an intimate relationship and this is what I'm teaching tomorrow Bible club I'm actually teaching this about the secret that God hid from the foundation world I'm gonna teach it to the kids tomorrow and it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost I could to show them how this was hid from all ages Paul said in Colossians 1 I'm gonna show how it was hid it was hid in the Old Testament it was hid all these times the Bible said the Holy Ghost could not be given until Jesus was glorified and then after his resurrection he breathed on some receive the Holy Ghost receive be born again let my spirit live in you let the comfort of her live in you and now this mystery that's been hidden is now made manifest to us amen so hopefully that the children will catch you tomorrow if not the children I'm confident those adults will catch it tomorrow by God's grace because they're starting to catch the name of Jesus and different things about that that we've been teaching oh and the three works of grace they've some of the adults have caught that oh yeah you you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost you after you're baptized you know you you just don't receive the Holy Ghost of your baptism you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost I'm so glad the word cannot be defeated amen praise God I'm so thankful now tonight I'm not gonna review it all that one let's go right to the scripture verse thirteen so have you got your Bible Oh Paul tells us I'm sorry Paul tells the Ephesians to not faint at his persecution because remember right now he's in prison he's riding in prison one historian said he was chained up you know to to a Roman guard it's at times not sure how often but he said don't say at my persecutions because they're actually a strength to you which is interesting so look at this let's read verse thirteen remember we finished last time with verse twelve about the boldness and access with confidence we have when we pray verse four 13 wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory now verse let me read unto 16 for this cause I bow my knees in to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man now let's just break that down there's a lot in here this is one of the medius sections of the book of Ephesians right here there's a the scriptures are just so deep and so filled with with statements and verbs and powerful scriptures let's just slow down this a little bit by God's grace now verse 13 remember Paul said don't faint at my tribulation so don't be spiritless don't be discouraged when Christians are persecuted don't let your spirit I like like we talked about in Ghana you know what the pastor passing away that shouldn't leave a spiritless or we read our exhausted will we be sad absolutely but Paul said not to be weary at persecutions he said but let it be for your strength let it be for your your glory he says now this is interesting but let's this will lead us into some more scriptures we cannot faint we can't become spiritless we've got to let that encourage us I know it's hard to say especially in situations that are so personal like we talked about but we've got to see what God is doing God allowed it remember God told Joe or job said God allowed good and God allowed evil so even Satan can't get the credit for evil right because God allowed it Satan's gonna get credit for nothing except sin right and unbelief but see God allowed evil God allows good God allows evil we must accept both at the hand of God and we must let it encourage us and seek God for understanding that we might go through the trial and come forth as gold in other words come forth with more faith with stronger faith now which is the scripture says which is your glory so rather which are your glory namely and as much as showing that God loved you so much as both to give his son for you and to permit his apostles to suffer tribulations for you in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles so see that Paul said this was for your glory I'm being persecuted for your glory he says now now remember he said he was a prisoner in Ephesians 3-1 so he says my tribulations here are your spiritual glory as your faith is further thereby if we were preaching some lie do you think it'd be persecuted absolutely not they let you know look at all the look at all the other religions that don't get persecuted why is Christianity so highly persecuted around the world because it's nothing but the truth it's the truth of God it has a true anointing of the Holy Spirit and the spirit of Antichrist hates the Spirit of God and wants to destroy anyone who truly has the Spirit of God hallelujah and so see when we hear about Christians being persecuted it should give us hope it should give us strength yes we will sweet we weep with them we hurt with them we feel with them at the same time it raises our faith God's letting them be persecuted and that ought to raise our faith let's read these scriptures I took time to write those out I read each one let's take a moment and read those if we can so let's go to first Corinthians 4:10 Paul says this over and over we've not to let persecutions strengthen us first Corinthians 4:10 I know it's tough like I said first Corinthians 4:10 now here Paul's writing here about the apostles 1st corinthians 4 time who would like someone like to read this for me madam thank you sir amen Paul's making the point about the preachers the Apostle the Apostles that travel and sacrifice the Apostles the one that looked like fools right because they're out there on the front lines and they're the ones being persecuted in this case especially in Paul's day all the great persecution he said the posture looked like fools but the Christians are the ones they're not being persecuted our wise Paul said we are the weak ones because we're actually getting persecuted buffeted he said but you are strong and he says ye are honorable he said and we are despised so you see this there's this there's there's these said like this there's some soldiers on the battlefront that are going through the hardest trials right but when we know they're suffering it should encourage us it should make us strong we should take courage by those who are on the front lines don't you take courage when you hear about missionaries going into China don't you get encouraged when you hear about missionaries going into Vietnam crossing and they're putting their lives on the line doesn't that encourage you they're the ones that look like fools they're the ones that are destitute there's one but we're the ones that are getting strengthened because of that we're seeing that the faith of Christ I'll say like this the Great Commission is being fulfilled Amen it's going to happen if God didn't call you and I to go then we ought to send somebody and our prayers should be with them constantly that's why we can pray for them tonight at the end of the service as well but see he said that's what it is those on the front lines those are the Apostles they're the ones that are going through the great heavy burdens on the battle fronts and here we are back here we're not really suffering but thank God were wise thank God were strong hallelujah and thank God were honorable praise God thank God for that I go to second Corinthians 1 verse 6 thinker thien's 1 verse 6 and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we become we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation amen see these apostles they're the ones suffering they're the ones but what happens because they're suffering because they're spreading the gospel we could have consolation we can have peace we can have comfort and we can rest assured that we are saved amen why because we heard that we heard preaching from st. Paul now you and I heard it from the Bible through a prophet named William Branham right but that's why we know we have salvation because we're hearing the same word Paul preached he was being he suffered brother Branham suffer - especially rejection at the end of his lifetime you know as this is not the real age of Christian persecution let's see as he was rejected and he was he was just given a bad name yet we are cut we are consoled by that and we are having salvation anyway amen that's exactly right but see you have this idea all throughout the scripture that the Apostle is the one who brought the word there are ones that suffer but yet we have salvation we have comfort we have hope we have strength we have all these things because we know God is with us amen we know God is with Christianity hey man I go to flip Ian's one now I'm sorry let's go to this one that's right we are I'm sorry we already passed let's go to first Corinthians 12:26 he's just a couple of turns of the page sorry you should have put that in order first contains 12 six this is what I mentioned earlier yeah this is when when one member suffers we all suffer and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it for one member be honored and all the members rejoice with it Amen see there's a part of us that suffers with them but Paul still tells them you're still gonna be consolation you're still going to be saved because we're all believing the same word now Philippians 1 verse 12 Philippians 1 verse 12 we see this all throughout Paul's writings Christian persecution brings us all these benefits consolation makes yes we suffer we're sad but also strengthens our faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ blippi ins 1 12 13 and 14 brethren I'm sorry but I would ye should understand brethren that the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confident by my bonds and are much more bold to speak the word without fear look what this produced Paul got locked in jail and what did it produce it made the Saints more bold to witness when people get persecuted what does it cause it caused you a godly love and it makes you want to stand up for Jesus right if someone's hurt as a Christian or or someone gets persecuted you just can't stand it you just want to be more bold for Jesus Christ this is what Paul's saying so any Christian persecution is for our glory amen can you say amen to that it will benefit you it'll benefit us somehow it'll benefit the body of Christ although it's difficult to see them suffer we suffer in a way but it also she makes us stronger in the faith and should make us more bold for Jesus amen just like when somebody picks on your little brother's sister what do you do do you pick on your little brother no you stand up for him that's if you got love in your heart and you weren't a rascal yet you know it makes you want to fight if you're fighting my brother I'm gonna fight you right you're not gonna pick on my that's how this was Christ you're not gonna pick on Christ he's the head we're the body and when you see somebody persecuting Christians you want to rise up and help them that's exactly right and our biggest battle we can do is on our knees that's the best thing we can do we can send money I've done that before you send money to people Christian that are struggling you know they have your churches you can send them we sent a couple years ago member when the remember that typhoon hit the Philippines a couple years ago we were at the other church on Waterloo that little hole-in-the-wall remember I think we were gathered together some money I think we sent a couple hundred or a thousand over there I can't remember how much it was but look here we're a real tiny Church but it breaks our hearts to see all those churches destroyed all those homes in water and then when it went away and the season the Saints there gathered around those pictures they don't have any clothes and they've lost everything what does it make you do you want to do something for Jesus because you know what if that was you you'd want somebody to help you out and you know they're standing for the same message you and I are so see persecution is for our glory it helps us to glorify Christ more helps us to be more bold helps us to be the Christians we ought to be amen I don't know about you and every whenever I get in a spiritual battle it really brings out the real fighter in me the real the real it brings out your zeal doesn't it somebody comes against water baptism or somebody comes against the serpent seed oh you're gonna see a fight then you're gonna see the sort you're gonna pull out the sword of the Spirit you're gonna start cutting through all those lies and all that that's why I love the comments on YouTube because it's just something I can do I see a lie right there I just take out the sword and cut that up like that or somebody emails Mira calls me I sure like that I get to pray about it I get to get that sword out and I get to fight for the truth of God because the Bible said we're fighting the good fight of faith it's going to be a fight hallelujah yes now then he says for this cause and going back to the chapter three we looked at that was chapter chapter 313 so see in verse 13 wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulation for you which is your glory so you're gonna be you're gonna enjoy the glory this you're gonna enjoy the benefit of Paul being persecuted and for this cause Paul bowed his knee so in other words he got down in prayer to worship Jesus in other words because the Saints would benefit by his persecution it took him to his knees alright so for this cause the cause of the Saints being strengthened with might by his spear and the inner man for this cause the Saints being strengthened Paul bowed his knees or he bowed down to the Lord Jesus Christ isn't that how you'd feel if I knew brother amen was gonna walk out of here stronger than when he walked in wouldn't that make wouldn't that make me bow my knees and say hallelujah when that if I knew Jose and all the sisters if I knew you're gonna walk out of here or spiritual powerhouses and your glory glory of God would shine greater on you wouldn't it send a real Christian to their knees in praise to Almighty God they're not gonna be weaker when they leave here they're gonna be stronger that's what's Paul saying I'm in bonds I'm in prison but my persecution is gonna cause the Saints to be stronger amen they're gonna Black's more bold and it's gonna send me to my knees to give glory to the Lord Jesus Christ amen Oh glory now verse 15 of whom the whole family in heaven earth is named I love that scripture it shows the name of Lord Jesus Christ is the name above all names and it shows that you and I are mrs. Jesus Christ mrs. Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah the whole family heaven earth his name just as Adam and Eve share of the same name in Genesis 5 so Christ and the church share the same name amen now verse 16 that he would grant unto you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man so see he knew his persecution would produce a glory in them and produce a spiritual encouragement and then it threw him to his knees they bowed his knees and said God strengthen them with inner strength in the inner man so in other words this persecution would throw him to his knees and say God strengthened the Saints even though I'm in prison strengthened all those Saints that we started the church there in Ephesus strengthened then that they'll have strength of the Holy Ghost in their lives how many love with the strength of the Lord how many can see the strength alone when it's not your strength but you can recognize someone's strengthen me someone's keeping me someone's helping me do this it's not my strength I didn't have straining to this before this is God's strength Amen that's what drove Paul to his knees to say God make them stronger let them see the strength of Christ in their lives and not their own strength and church you and I have no strength amen we're no match for the devil it takes the strength of God for us to cast down awesome tations amen now remember our strength has to be made new day by day we can't take the strength of Wednesday and hope well I hope it helps me on Friday don't get me wrong it might bless you well the RAM said the blessings of the future home lasted him two weeks he said all the revelations in the future home last them two whole weeks but what Paul sang here is we do not faint but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by in other words you got to keep that fire going every single day in other words for like brother branham's the example I gave of him he would have had to go over those future home quotes every day and when he did and those scriptures every day it would just bring him more strength ma look at this every day and you know that word renewed means it means renovation think about that does anybody remember what this room looked like I use that illustration board remember what this room looked like before we moved in here does anybody remember I know the children do well what do we do we gave it a renovation well can you imagine renovating this room every day what if I what if we painted today and said okay let's get the paint out tomorrow give it a fresh coat let's rip out this carpet let's put some new carpet in here that's what it's like that's what the word rent of renew means to renovate it be like ripping it all out and started all again and that's what we need to do in our minds church in our minds you ever wake up with a bad thought in your mind yeah you ever had a bad dream and wake up with a bad thought in your mind you ever wake up cranky before you need to renew that mind every single day and the church said Paul is praying said God strengthened them with your strength in the inner man see we don't want to be strong so much on the outside we want to be strong on the inside that we can stand up to the devil and all his devices amen see if any man's in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature the only thing that counts in Christianity is that you and I become brand new that's the only thing that counts people can be baptized but if they don't become a new person every single day if their life if the life of Christ isn't prevailing over their old man then they're not a new creature we must be new creatures and that's all Jesus once that's the whole end of the gospel so you'll be made more like Christ a new creature and not like you're all dirty self anymore amen glory that's the only thing that avails that's the only thing that means anything is that you are a new person amen glory now verse 17 is this a little bit tricky for denomination I hope you understand this here's I I mentioned this that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love let's look at this first thought of Christ dwelling in your hearts by faith all right now all right now I want to make sure notes here make sure I'd say the right thing there's two E's two ways you can take this let me just say that there's two ways there's two ways you can take that Christ dwell in your hearts by faith there's two ways you can take it now most denominational churches take it like this when a sinner gets say they say they say oh do you want to repent of your sins yes do you want to invite Jesus into your heart and they say yes I'm gonna invite Jesus into my heart and they think that person's filled with the Holy Ghost when they're not even living a sanctified life right and so that's why that then this is the one scripture in the whole Bible that said Christ dwells in your hearts and this is where they get their prayer from oh invite Jesus in your heart and now you're filled with the Holy Spirit well not really not really you're not even sanctified because after that just watch their life the next day they still might cuss right Easter might watch dirty shows their old habits of the world are still there but yet they got a scripture where Christ dwells in my heart by faith well yes he tells in your mind anybody wants to dwell all the way down in your soul does ever understand that there's two ways you can take the scripture the denomination taken well he dwells in our hearts now we're all filled with the Holy Ghost but really it means that he dwells in their in their minds right it's just an anointing in their mind but he wants to get all the way down to that intimate part all the way down to the soul amen it's exactly right because look at this here now let me let me look at the scripture remember the Bible said the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it I the LORD search the heart I try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doing to see most churches grossly misinterpret Christ dwelling in the heart their use of the heart cannot deal with the minor spirit it has to be the soul I'm sorry this use of the heart so we look at Christ dwells in your hearts by faith as Christ dwelling in the soul of man because the Holy Ghost dwells in your soul by faith and that's in Matthew 11:29 and Hebrews four nine so let's go to Matthew 11 twenty-nine let's read that again by the grace of Lord this is what makes us different from the churches right here this is the main thing the baptism of the Holy Ghost Matthew 11:29 they say oh I got it I invited Jesus in my heart when I was you know six or seven or and and then they still cuss and swear and they still practice immoral things they practice immoral a living unsanctified life and they misunderstood the scripture because they didn't have a prophet to tell them and that's not their fault it's their fault when we tell the truth and then they reject it okay Matthew 11:29 can somebody read that for me by God's grace Malachi thank you sir amen can you see all Jesus teaching here Jesus saying you've had the Holy Spirit on your flesh Jonah had on his flesh David had on his flesh but they didn't have it down in the soul and if you don't believe that go to go to Hebrews 10 read Hebrews 10 tonight that was my scripture I read that whole chapter this morning that was my scripture reading that my devotion time this morning oh my it's just beautiful the Bible said we're sanctified forever by one sacrifice praise God Jesus don't doesn't have to die every time we come to church he only died one time and we're forever sanctified by that one offering amen and it says then the blood of bulls and goats could never take away your sins nor could it purge your conscience but that means the blood of Jesus Christ takes away all your sin and the second fold it purges your conscience so you don't walk around saying I'm guilty I'm going to hell i'm going to hell aren't you glad church you have a conscience that's purged and you can know that your sins are forgiven and you can know that's you're on your way to heaven amen but not do that amen but the New Testament does that it takes away all your sin and it should clean out your conscience so you know I'm living right I'm doing right I'm forgiving I'm a son or daughter of God I'm on my way to heaven I'm shouting victory and I'll serve God and dwell in the house the Lord all the days of my life amen glory so Jesus saying I'm going to give rest of your soul your souls have never had rest because the blood of bulls and goats could never take away your sin it could never take away your unbelief but now in the New Testament he said I'm giving you rest for your souls amen this is Christ dwelling in the heart in other words the soul by faith it's not just that like we said it's not the denominational idea I'm by Jesus in my heart okay now let's go play video games let's go shoot somebody up on a video game I've seen that I've seen kids do that we've seen kids baptized a Bible club and they leave they come back you're talking about all kinds of evil video games that's not the love of Christ that's not the Spirit of Christ Christ really didn't come in the soul right although people tell them that we need to tell them you must be born again amen you got justified now you need to walk into st. if occasion you know walk in that wilderness and then you need to possess the promised land you need to walk through the River Jordan ain't ahem and get filled with the Holy Ghost I didn't hear ya that's exactly right Laurie now next in verse 17 jesus was preaching to the soul I want to dwell on your soul I'm gonna give you rest for your soul fusion's 3:17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love that's just a simple thought but I showed this picture last time I found this on the internet I thought this was really pretty we are rooted and grounded in love fusions 3:17 these are all these leaves I mean the fruits of the spirit come out of here but our roots you and I are called trees of righteousness how many remember that and if Psalms chapter one we are the tree where the sea that becomes a life right we're the seed of the tree that becomes a tree but our roots our life must be rooted in the love of God amen now the word rooted means to be stabilized to be grounded you and I must be stabilized in the love of God you and I must be grounded in the love of God see we are that growing seed a tree of God stable in the love of God do you feel that tonight do you feel that you are selling the love of God which means you are settled in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're anchored in God your place in God you're abiding in God's love amen how many you're living in God's love amen Oh glory that's where I'm rooted that's where I'm Ankur that's where I stay that's where I live at in the love of God amen where's mo Jesse he's grounded in the love of God amen I live in Doylestown but I actually Lester not my real location my real location is I'm in Christ love that's where you'll find me all the time amen in the love of Christ because the Bible said were rooted and grounded and settled and anchored in the love of God amen now remember the next verse and I preached on this a few months ago may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height who was here when I preached on that he's ever remember that okay I'm gonna just go that quickly I don't know if sister Connie heard that or not now Paul said we must understand the love of Christ that we are rooted in and we must think this you and I must think this God's love has breadth to it God's love has length to it God's love has depth to it and God's love has height to it how many believe that Paul's that's why I says these are some of the richest scriptures in the New Testament some of these things some of these ideas he gets out and it had to come from God because we never would have thought of it and so remember we must review we must use our minds and remember the love of God and he said all saints should try to wrap your brain around this wrap your spirit around this that God's love have us for we'd say manifestations to it now remember I thought this was striking the the love has four parts or four manifestations and then the Holy Ghost has four powers I thought that was really striking as four manifestations as the lion the Ox the man thing I thought that's very striking don't you I think it's very striking now I already show this one so what is God's love God's love has breadth or width because as far as the East is from the west so far has room he removed our transgressions from us so breadth is with the crossed God's love separates our sin as far as the east is from the west amen that we must understand we must remember that God has separated me as far from my sins as I could possibly get from them amen Corie and remember he or she that is forgiven much love much so God if God took a lot of sins away from you and had to separate you from a lot of sins guess what you're the one that loves Jesus more hallelujah that's why I can say like this well I'm not gonna say like that I'm gonna move on I don't want to say the wrong thing I just kind of felt checked on that no no no let me not say that let me move on so God's love has breath it separates us for as far east from the West is God's love has length and this is measured in the length of days and the length of generations for surely goodness and mercy shall follow me what all the days of my life and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen now look here he says this I will make known that faithfulness to all generations so God's love is so long it lasts to every generation hallelujah his truth endureth to all generations his love is so long it's so wide but it's also so long to every generation here in the Bible says he keeps his love to a thousand generations hallelujah amen so his love has width it separates us from our sins as far as we could possibly possibly could be it's so long it goes to a thousand generations and now his love has depth and depth always deals with the mind of God when you read the scripture the depth of God always refers to the mind of God the depth of riches of his mind who hath known the mind of the Lord okay so we must remember his love has depth of his mind great thoughts that he had the Bible said he's rich in mercy his great love we're and he loved us even when we were dead in sins he's quickened us together with Christ by grace you're saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen Romans 5 says for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly but God commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him can I get a Amen tonight these are old time gospel scriptures about the love of God amen now here's the depth of his mind according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world and he has made us accepted in the beloved praise God so that's the depth of God it's so deep it the God's love is so deep it was so deep in his mind that he was thinking about it before the foundation of the world hallelujah let me skip past that I got a lot of that and his love has height because the Bible said his mercy reaches into the heavens praise the Lord don't you love that it's deep in his mind it was deep way in his mind before the foundation world and now his love is so high it reaches to the heavens hallelujah for as heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him how many scared of heights it makes me twinge every time I see something on Facebook when someone jumps off a high building because I don't like Heights see we don't like that but God likes that God like cuz he's showing us how high his love is above us his love is so great extends way high above all of us so we must not to get over my fear I guess but the fact is his love it reminds us how high is mercy is to us his mercy is great above the heavens it's even up above the heavens amen and the truth reaches unto the clouds amen and remember Church our hope is so high it's past outer space it's past the universe the Bible said our hope is so high it enters into the veil in heaven where the forerunner entered even Jesus and our hope is anchored at the very throne of God at the very mercy seat of God that's how high God's love is for us amen our Lovins focus on Jesus Christ amen glory amen now here's the thought I want to get to have the most slides on this because I'm gonna read some quotes I'm gonna read actually a few quotes about exceedingly abundantly now verse 18 read 18 8 verse 19 see all Saints need to remember that God's love has breath it's wide it's long it's high and it's deep all saints seem to remember god's love is so great for me it's got four it's got four manifestations to it it's so great Oh hallelujah and to know the love of Christ which passes all knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God Oh hallelujah now verse 20 now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think now how does he do a church according to what why does he do this according to the what the power that works in us how is God gonna do exceedingly abundantly great for me how is he gonna do it by the power that's in you praise God the power that's in me oh I want God God do something exceedingly great out here do something exceedingly great well actually the power for that is gonna start in you and how's it gonna start in you in your love for Christ and your prayers and your Bible study and your hungered on the word and you're speaking the word see that powers got to start in you first and then you'll see exceedingly a above all you ask your thing I love this because that's oh that's a blessing for me I needed that I need to know that that power that exceeding great power is actually has to start in me that's the start of me I've got to be filled with that power and then I'll see God do exceedingly abundantly above all I ask or think hallelujah now this scripture reminded me of a few others in John 10 and John 16 I remember these ëthey coming not but for to steal to kill and destroy but I'm come that they might have what life and that they may have it more abundantly how many want the abundant life I'm going to show you what the abundant life is and they Rolls Royces and lifestyles of the rich and greedy rich and famous if that's not the abundant life I know that's what pre TV preachers say but that's not the abundant life and in that day you show ask me nothing barely verily I say unto you whatsoever you ask the Father my name he'll give it to you the speaking when the Holy Ghost comes hither to have you asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full God wants us to have fullness of joy so he says in order to get the joy you got to ask and then when you ask him believe then God will fill your joy hallelujah keep hanging on just don't doubt just keep hanging on to the promise of God God will fulfill your joy remember I told you that Testament forget this testimony his name is brother herb up in Sheffield so where we at which direction are we pointing here and I think where's the parking lot okay there's a parking lot right okay so north to Sheffield Sheffield's up there brother herb is 83 years old I just saw him at brother James's funeral he was in the message back in the 90s when I came in the message in 2001 he's one of the first people I met up at Sheffield at that time in 2001 none of his children were serving God 2001 he kept hanging on he cups coming to every service he keeps praising God he keeps he's an old man now he's got gray he's all gray he's got he's an old man he's 83 I just seen him a couple months ago and I said how you doing he said God has brought my two children into the message now when I met in 16 years ago that wasn't the case they were out in the world but I walked in there and I got to meet his son and his daughter they're both now going to the church in Sheffield his daughter got his hair grunting hair she's got long hair now she wear dresses now doesn't paint herself up like a like a barn door anymore anything like that she looks like a godly woman God healed her of cancer because of that she's now accepted the message of the hour but 16 years ago we would not have seen that you see so we've got to ask him to leave and say God give me fullness of joy and help me to believe in amen the only thing that really brings us joy that brother man said is winning souls that's the only thing that really gives us joy is seeing people come to Christ Jesus so see we got to ask and keep hanging on who wouldn't new within 16 years God would have saved those two adults and they're in their 50s I'm not mistaken fifties or sixties and they're grown children now both Baptist and he got the seat now his wife died a couple years ago before they got saved so he had to stay say in faith even though his wife passed away and keep believing God's gonna fulfill my joy and because he was faithful he saw both his children baptized in water right in front of his face amen that's the joy of the Lord amen so Seeley must be faithful we must ask him believe that our Joy's we made full amen now what does abundant mean I thought you never asked so here it is here's what abundant means in the Strong's Concordance it means a super abundance it means superior in quality and I want to make sure I say that it's the quality of life that you and I live Jesus said I'd give them life that they haven't might have it more abundantly so you and I live a quality of life that's so much higher than a sinner can you say amen to that sinners got to deal with lie and they got to cover up their lies all day they're haunted by their lies they're haunted by their past they always think all is gonna catch up to me and it is gonna catch up to them it's the Holy Spirit trying to convict them but you and I can have such a quality of life what do you mean real jest you can go to sleep in peace and know that I've confessed everything it's under the blood of Jesus your quality of life is so much greater than theirs when it comes to Christmas they got to worry about a binary big enough president to make somebody happy yeah they got impressed their boss so they got to do this and they're just overwhelming stress all these things like that but you and I don't when we can get people presents but it's all based upon love it's not based upon competition or worried about our wonderful men's are gonna get me something for Christmas how can I afford to get amen and Adam something you know that's just one example of how the quality of our life is ought to be better we ought to have so much peace we have so much joy we ought to have so much forgiveness because the quality of our life is abundant compared to a sinner it's exactly right amen we know what the real meaning of Christmas is it's not necessarily the coming of the son it's the coming of the son in your hearts amen that's the real meaning of Christmas that Christ will be born in the dirty stable of your heart amen and if he does so clean it out real fast what does it mean Church ask that you're giving you life that you have more abundantly you have life that has advantages to it your life as a Christian has advantages over the center that they can't even imagine amen think of all the advantages you have your attitude I've seen it recently in over the last few years when there's trouble strikes people come to work at school and they're so nervous oh what's gonna happen violence and all these things in nuclear war they're so nervous now whether it happens or not that's up to God but you and I can have such an advantage over them we don't let those things bother us there's a certain worker you know I'm friends with them and they worry about this all the time there's like a worrywart and I'll just walk in the room and say excuse me can help you and those just would say whoa they'll just jump there nerves are on end all the time but people walk in my room I'm like who cares just let them walk in I'm a servant of the Lord I'm all right everything's gonna be all right you I don't live under those stresses we don't live under that we don't walk on pins and needles we have peace with God a man you and I have advantages you and I have a quality of life that we ought to experience and enjoy and know that our life is a much better life than a sinners life amen it's the quality abundant life is quality of life its advantages spiritually that we have but let me give you an example because listen we have Christian advantages but when people are living in sin they have sinful disadvantages because look at the scripture less saying should get at what an advantage over us see we Jesus promised life abundantly life with advantages but if we don't serve Jesus then we Satan has advantage over us see now we're disadvantaged with Christ so somebody's gonna have advantage of your life who are you giving advantage in your life I'm giving Christ advantage how do you know because I'm I have the quality of God in my life right I know how to treat other people I know how if I made things right if I make a mistake this is what it means advantage means to defraud or make a gain we don't want Christ that or we don't want Satan to get a gain in our life we don't want Satan to get a gain on us we want Christ to have the victory in our lives because the Bible says that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will so see when Satan has an advantage over someone he's taken them prisoner they're a prisoner to lust their prisoner to greed they're a prisoner to fear their prisoner to anger that's when Satan has advantages aren't you glad for the advantage of Jesus setting you free I'm so glad Jesus set me free singing glory hallelujah Jesus lifted me amen that's the advantage that's the abundant life that we so desire preachers on TV make it out like it's money that just brings you more problems and the church said more money brings you more problems right brings you more problems more responsibilities more stress if you're not ready to handle like Solomon or someone who who God could trust with that kind of money but see this is the advantage of the life the abundant life Jesus was talking about this is the advantage it's not being a slave not being captive to Satan but actually ruling over Satan amen ruling over spiritual darkness huh me love the Lord now let me give you one clear example and I didn't have time like I said I went through all that I had spent a lot of time today on this sermon a lot of time I spend all my free moments on this sermon today but I didn't have as much time as I wanted I wanted to find more examples where God did more than what they asked for I only could come up with one so forgive me I I was thinking of times where you could see a specific prayer and where God did exceedingly abundantly more than ask who think I just thought another one Jesus with the twelve loaves I'm sorry Jesus with the loaves and the fish right he gave exceedingly abundantly above all they could ask or think hallelujah there it is that seven baskets extra he did Jesus did exceed it Jesus prayed and God gave him exceedingly abundantly above all he could ask your thing there it is right there there's two examples okay now there's one here's the second the second one's Hannah I've been preaching on Hannah I've been preaching on Hannah well Brandon said Hannah was a barren woman in the Bible she wanted a son and she got the fasting for him she fasted and prayed until she even the priest at the temple thought she was drunk she was in such desperation with the rest of the women watching what kind of bun it the other one had wore you know how it goes other ones seeing what kind of clothes they had on and talking about the things going on in the farm but not Hannah she stepped right through the whole crowd and went to the altar she had been fasting she wanted her reproach taken away what a difference it is today it's almost her approach to have a child then it was it was a reproach not to have one and she got her knees and she never noticed the dignity of the people she never noticed the dignified priest as he walked out she was in such distressed so the tears was rolling down her cheeks and she was crying and desperation Oh Lord God give me a son give me a son what she asked for a son what did God give her a prophet okay man and I was a studying today this thought felt like it'd come down from heaven to me I just remember this quote this quote where brother Graham said this he gave her a extra blessing so God gave Hannah exceedingly abundantly above all she could ask her that shows there's a difference between just a man and a prophet glory a prophet is one that God will speak with lip to ear hallelujah and notice she wasn't selfish when she prayed when God heard her and answered her prayer and gave her a son she gave him back to God and because that she was willing not to be selfish after God had answered her prayer he gave her a prophet oh that was an extra blessing oh he's just full of them those little extra blessings that he gives she asks for a son and God said I'm doing more than that I'm giving you a prophet I don't know yeah I love that so that's what the Holy Spirit brought to me as I studied this exceedingly abundantly when did God do this when I got two examples I got Jesus with the the loaves and the fish and now I've got Hannah Hannah asked for a son God gave her more God gave her profit not only son but a profit and there had been no open vision for many many years in Israel Samuel the first prophet for many many years because a mother got desperate that she could have no churn she was past the age of barren probably 67 years old and she prayed with desperation she must have this child what was it God had spoke to her no doubt you can't be desperate so God speaks co-chair rise and shake yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in the hour we must be desperate or perish there's coming for something from the Lord I know it as thus saith the Lord there's coming for something and we better get desperate it's between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it because that she wasn't selfish she was given a prophet I mean love the Lord I thought that was beautiful unto it's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us hallelujah amen I'll try to think of another one there but enough to move on now I want to bring this up and after I thought it actually before I thought of this thought about Hannah when the Holy Spirit brought that to me I was actually thinking of a quote I heard brother Branham say about the trip that he made to South Africa in 1951 he made a trip there and this this takes the other side of exceedingly abundantly so I showed you the good side of exceeding abundantly now I'm going to show you the opposite side of missing the exceedingly abundantly because this you will never receive exceedingly abundantly in the permissive will of God help me understand what I'm saying you can't expect God to bless you abundantly over and over and over if you're disobeying things in the Word of God if we keep the Word of God like Jesus did God bless the food the fish the loaves and you keep it like Hannah did God give you more he'll give you a profit but if we break the Word of God we cannot expect to receive the exceeding abundantly the higher quality of life or our super spiritual advantages right quality and advantages we can't expect a higher quality of life or spiritual Vantage's if we're breaking the Word of God now here's the context of this quote it was either 1951 or 1952 brother Graham went on a South Africa trip brother branham disobeyed the angel Lord and almost died of amoebas I don't remember this story didn't remember this story okay they started off I think in Johannesburg I don't remember exactly which one it was but brother Branham the angel Lord said stay in Johannesburg but the man that he was working with had a certain itinerary and they were only going to go to the pastor's churches that they liked instead of instead of preaching to the masses that the thousands of thousands they were gonna go to real tiny small little churches where this gift of God was meant to go to the masses it was meant to go to the big groups brother Bosworth came to brother brandman and said this now they were starting to get an argument by the band was saying no we're supposed to say in Johannesburg and they're saying no we got to take you south but brother Bosworth came up with some brother branham I think you're wrong he said I believe if you'll go down that way around Cape Town you'll see exceedingly the abundantly the best you've ever seen in all your life and their sense brother Bosworth as a witness so brother Branham is telling this story in July of 1952 and brother Bosworth is sitting in the congregation so you know he's telling the truth I said brother Bosworth as long as I've been with you and you seen those visions and seeing how they come to pass I tell you now in the name of Lord that is not God's will for us to do that where to go to Durban not down to Cape Town and you mean to tell me and brother Bosworth said well he said I wonder if it could have been a false vision you had brother Branham and how many those prophets don't get false visions they don't get balls missions I said well brother Bosworth there's nearly my second daddy the man I love so he's right there in the service very bosom friend of mine I looked and I said oh god have mercy 15,000 miles away from home and there my manager and brother backs were brother Baxter brother Bosworth and everybody and I said God what can I do I walked back in there and I said brother I'm trapped but not in God I tell you the name of Lord I shall not take that way there and they said it is or is it well somebody thought up and said could it end me the permissive will of God well then something was named about the permissive and I said pray with me Billy we knelt down in the course he got tired you don't know much about it so he went to bed I stayed there along towards 3 o'clock in the morning I raised up I felt I just like a man sitting there he moved around this side so I'm not the angel the Lord and I said my lord what are these men telling me out there so let me just tell a little bit more of the story brother Branham eventually decides to listen to these men he was going to side with them his son Billy Paul was saying no just do what the Lord said do what the Lord said and his managers saying no you got to follow all these all these preachers stay with the preachers and now that after all these days of battling back and forth the angel Lord comes and tells brother Branham he's going to you to go in the permissive will of God because brother branham wouldn't obey the angel the Lord at first he wouldn't obey the the vision he wouldn't obey it so the angel says fine then have the permissive will of God but you're gonna suffer for it now Church think about times we've suffered our lives because we obeyed the Word of God I'm sorry disobey the Word of God if we break the Word of God then we can expect what suffering so the angel Lord said go with them go on but you'll pay for it said you're trapped but you'll pay for go on with them I'll give you permission to go but remember you'll pay for and he said for that go wake up your boy he honored Billy Paul cos Billy Paul said obey the vision he said go wake up your boy because Billy Paul had the truth and he said come go wake up your boy and tell him in the morning it's going to be a pretty day the storm and things will clear away in the morning it'll be a pretty day and they'll want you to pray for the sick at Sunday school I will bless it he said and Billy is going to come out for you and a man a young fella in the little black car that's gonna pick you up another boy on the road and on the road back there's going to be a native a colored man we we call it they're standing by you know eucalyptus tree near a bridge fixing to strike another one he has got a white safari suit on fixing to strike another one with the stick tell your boy that and tell those men that they'll know that it's thus saith the Lord now everything happened according to the vision but as soon as they left and as soon as they went to the Cape Town brother branham says this and brother Bosworth you're a witness of God the very next meeting hell broke loose see when you when we get in the permissive will of God that's when trouble happens because we have to reap what we've planted right whatever sees we plant if we if we compromise and break the Word of God then we're gonna so we're gonna so reap what we sow we're gonna have to bear the consequences of breaking the Word of God he said trouble set in it was the way it was that way till we plumb got to Durban and there in Durban we're nearly a hundred thousand people gathered for the meeting so forth there's where the thirty thousand conference was in one day on the road around I got a great brother Baxter got sick first he got sick Billy got sick all of them got sick all of my bunch Billy and I and brother Baxter then I got sick I got really sick I mean I was so sick I couldn't even get to the Pope at Harley I just stand so weak so sick my and come to find out I caught African amoeba the Brethren told me I could have in my church and oh now I'm skipping ahead so see these preachers were saying oh we can have in our church you need to bring broadband to our church and poor oh brother Bosworth he said I never seen him out of humor in his life he come back up to the house and said let's take a walk we went walking said brother branham did you ever hear of such it's ridiculous so now brother Bosworth gets upset with all the preachers wanting their itinerary and what does brother Branham say he said of course brother Bosworth that's the seating Lee abundantly so see he's kind of mocking him and joking around in other words you're the one who wanted this exceedingly abundantly and this is what we're reaping because you compromise on the vision of the Lord beseech a joke see I thought this was all this exceedingly abundantly all this trouble all this arguing with ministers all this political mess with ministers see we're reaping what we so what we planted back there because we disobeyed the Word of God then brother Branham said I suffered for and I'm gonna skip past this he went back to the United States sick he didn't get better he got worse and he got so worse he had actually missed preaching appointments for eight months can you imagine me being out from today what is it it's almost December December January February March April May June July he imagined me not being in church till July next year be like where's the pastor I don't know who would anybody come if I wasn't here would we have anybody here to lead songs we would have here lead songs we would be here to preach imagine me being out eight months brother band was out of preaching eight months he laid in a bed all because he disobeyed the vision of the Lord and brother Bosworth he said here's another thing I speak this name of Lord before he went to Africa he was in Shreveport and he spoke and Naima Lord and said Satan has a trap set for me so God told him there's a trap but he missed the trap he said in Africa there's something you all pray for me little did I know it was among my brother those are the worst kinds aren't they church those are the worst kinds of traps when they happen right in the church it's a lot easier when it's people outside the church it's a lot easier right because you can just brought you can just recognize oh this is the devil but Satan's more sly when he uses people right and Bride of Christ fellowship to try to get you to compromise oh you don't do that brother Jesse just preaches too hard on that you know you could even compromise on that a little bit how other people the church do it to you understand it's more deceptive when Satan uses somebody amongst the church David said the same thing he said if a sinner would have spoke bad about me he said I could have born but it was one that I ate with it was one who I had great fellowship with and that hurt more than anything isn't that true the pains that her hardest are those that you receive in the house of your friends brother Ram said he went to pray he knelt down before and he said it seemed like God said next time you'll listen so brother man eventually he prayed and fasted he said three in the morning the angel came to the Lord angel or came to him eight months later angel Lord came and said he said is this ameba gonna be gone and he said I'll never bother you again he said he woke up the next day and ran to the doctor and said test me said I just tested yesterday he said test me I had a vision it's the state the Lord dr. Derek tested him and didn't have any more amoebas supernatural miracle but I wanted you to see both sides of exceedingly abundantly blessed like Hannah like Jesus with the food or missing the exceeding abundantly because we compromised on the word we can not expect an advantage over temptation if we compromise on the following if we let unconfessed sins go if we rob god of tithes and offerings with our finances how can we expect exceedingly abundantly if we skip the worship or don't hear all the preaching of the word how can we expect to get hungry for the word if we're skipping the word if we skip our devotions if we don't read and pray in the morning how are we gonna get renewed every day how are we gonna get a fresh painting how we gonna get fresh carpet how's our life gonna feel fresh if we don't get renovated every morning and how are we gonna get exceeding abundant if we're not feeding on the if we're feeding on the world instead of the word if we're spending more time on our phones or more time on social media or more time on the magazines then we are in the Word of God how are we gonna get exceedingly abundantly above all we asked her think we're not because we won't have the power inside of us we got to have the power in our lives amen we got to have power these things keep the power from us we have to have power in us then we'll see exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think that's close let's try to finish out this chapter well I've been if you like I've been in this chapter forever chapter 3 see Frank it's been alone because it's a really deep chapter so really thick just think of the glory of God I'll say thick like honey in the rock cave and thick like honey been a real deep chapter on to him be glory in the church by Jesus Christ throughout all ages world without end amen I stand on our feet I just want to show you a few things I just want to point out just a couple things I want to rehearse a few things with you unto him that can do exceedingly abundantly give us major advantages give us such high quality of life how many 1 a high quality life he can give us such a higher quality he'd give us such a higher advantage over Satan that's what I want Church as advantages over Satan advantages over temptation how do we get that by letting the power of God flow through us remembering the how much love God for has for us right and then if we have this then the Bible said unto Him be glue working throughout all the ages God has got glory in every Church age right now we're on this church age but he's gonna get glory in a lukewarm sin loving church age he's gonna get glory out of some word loving saints amen some hot on fire Saints he's gonna get love right he's gonna let our love like the scripture said he's gonna get glory because of our love for him in this age God's gonna find someone who loves him and member he said as many as I love I rebuke them and chasing them so if you love Christ expect to get rebuked expect to get chasing but then after that he'll love you even more now I'm closing with this after right now this is the possible order of endtime events I don't think sister Connie has ever seen this but this is the order brother Branham taught us brother Branham said right now we are at the binding of the tares never know that next comes the rapture of course after we believe a squeeze is gonna happen how many believe the squeeze is gonna happen with all my heart I believe that but the Bramson is scriptural the temptation that comes upon the whole world so the binding of the tares they're uniting in their ecumenical council they're gonna bring pressure from the government's put pressure on the church it's gonna bring a squeeze during that squeeze time cheese is gonna rapture his bride off the earth after that we enjoy I'm sorry during that that's called the first resurrection during that time when we're up at the marriage supper of the Lamb they're going through tribulation we come back as the army of God at the Battle of Armageddon emember Christ is gonna get glory through all these ages he's gonna get glory in the tribulation by what pouring his wrath out and he gets glory as we feast with him at the marriage supper of the Lamb he gets glory throughout all ages world without end and then he gets glory in the Battle of Armageddon right when he comes back now at that point member of the earth is burned with fire because we have to walk out into the millennium on the ashes of the wicked so before we can step foot on the earth before Christ was step foot on the earth after that great battle he has to burn it all over then we step down for the honeymoon and he's gonna get glory in the honeymoon how many looking forward to that honeymoon oh I can't wait to give him glory all throughout the thousand years amen before I speak before I think it he'll already answer me that's what Isaiah said before I ask it he'll answer already well that's love right there next in this age then Satan's loosed for a little season that's the Battle of Gog and Magog that Satan's demise after that he's tossing the lake of fire and next is the white throne judgment that's another age of time there another span of time the white throne judgment all men women must stand before the judgment seat of Christ that's the second resurrection I'm sorry I got cut off that's the second resurrection so the rapture is the first resurrection all the dead in Christ rise first we'll see them we'll meet them together in the clouds the second resurrection is where everybody else all these ashes of all these dead people all those ashes will be brought back those souls will be brought back those bodies will be brought back but we brought back to the white throne judgment and then we know after that after that all the sinners are put in the lake of fire and then we enter into the final age the new heavens and the new earth this earth now let's guys got a fire baptism now the capstone comes down and that's you and I that's our home there for all eternity heaven isn't gonna be up there in heaven heavens coming down to earth this is where this is my home well
