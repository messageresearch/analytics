[0:08] thank you
[0:11] Texas 25 or state
[0:25] you got it you say man
[0:30] one two three and let them make me a
[0:38] sanctuary's word
[0:41] I have some slight descriptions we'd
[0:44] like to share
[0:45] did you get a chance to listen to
[0:46] Wednesday night I'd encourage you to
[0:48] listen to Wednesday the first sermon in
[0:51] the series here see how many uh we get
[0:53] through
[0:54] we ended Wednesday night we're looking
[0:55] at the high priest and how we had to
[0:57] offer uh blood
[0:59] in the holiest of holies in order to
[1:02] forgive all the people praise God and
[1:05] when we know in the New Testament Jesus
[1:07] did that by offering his own blood in
[1:09] heaven for us aren't you glad for that
[1:11] praise God Amen now Church really really
[1:13] this should take away all of our fears
[1:15] of failing
[1:17] this should take away all of our fears
[1:19] of going to hell
[1:20] because Jesus Christ presented a blood
[1:22] sacrifice for us praise God Jehovah
[1:26] Jireh provided himself a sacrifice
[1:28] praise God a sacrifice for you and I
[1:30] amen I hope that makes your heart
[1:32] forward of God's love amen amen and uh
[1:34] let's continue on this thought here by
[1:36] the grace of God the Tabernacle Moses
[1:38] now the Bible says before Faith came we
[1:40] were kept under the law shut up unto the
[1:43] faith which should be afterwards be
[1:44] revealed wherefore the law was our
[1:47] school Master to bring us unto Christ
[1:49] that we might be justified by faith so
[1:53] the law uh was incredibly detailed we
[1:55] know there were 613 laws in general and
[1:58] many of those related to the ceremonial
[2:00] law the laws related to the Tabernacle
[2:03] of Moses or the temple yeah Tabernacle
[2:05] Moses rather the Temple of Solomon
[2:08] um it was incredibly detailed I can only
[2:10] scratch the surface I mean every color
[2:12] in there every detail every socket every
[2:15] every Blossom every single thing you see
[2:19] as a type it's all pointing to the work
[2:22] of Jesus Christ it's all pointing us to
[2:25] Christ and so the law was a school
[2:27] master so you think of a teacher you
[2:28] think of someone who knows a lot no I'm
[2:30] gonna I'm the exception I don't know a
[2:32] lot praise God but most teachers know a
[2:34] lot amen their teachers are supposed to
[2:36] be knowledgeable and strict and and help
[2:39] you learn uh the Bible said the law was
[2:41] a Schoolmaster to bring you to Christ so
[2:45] uh we look at the Old Testament was
[2:47] pointing us to Jesus Christ all these
[2:49] details point us to Jesus Christ so many
[2:51] details uh so many uh uh things you can
[2:55] read in the Bible and scratch your head
[2:57] and not quite sure but if you go to the
[2:59] New Testament you'll find all of it was
[3:01] pointing to Jesus Christ why that we
[3:04] might be justified which means declare
[3:07] righteous as one ought to be praise God
[3:10] Amen so this this means here that that
[3:13] the righteousness of Jesus Christ here
[3:15] was shared with us it was a Divine
[3:18] exchange Jesus took all of our iniquity
[3:20] all of our guilt all of our shame and we
[3:22] inherited by uh by The Exchange We
[3:25] inherited his righteousness praise God
[3:27] and he justified us because a sacrifice
[3:31] was provided for us amen we could not
[3:33] bring our own sacrifice God had to
[3:36] provide a sacrifice for us and when we
[3:38] accept that sacrifice and I'm saying
[3:40] this when Heaven accepted that sacrifice
[3:42] then we were accepted with it praise God
[3:44] Amen Hallelujah that's what Justified us
[3:48] the fact that we believe and we're
[3:50] trusting in Heaven's sacrifice that was
[3:53] sent down to earth and we'll get to that
[3:55] Lord willing today now after faith has
[3:57] come we're no longer under the law
[4:00] praise God because if you if you break
[4:02] one thing you're cursed the Bible says
[4:04] right uh so we're not under the law
[4:08] like a school Master right like some
[4:09] teachers you have as long as you do what
[4:12] they say you're on their good side but
[4:13] you do one thing wrong now they hate you
[4:16] I ever had a teacher like that I've had
[4:18] a few like that
[4:19] all of a sudden they'll just flip on you
[4:21] and they'll be against you but but the
[4:23] Bible says we're not under the law that
[4:26] way anymore you break one law you're
[4:27] guilty of all
[4:29] we're not under that we are now we're
[4:31] not uh slaves we are children unto God
[4:35] we are God's children just like you
[4:36] would never you would never think of
[4:38] getting rid of your children you never
[4:40] think well I don't not what I don't
[4:41] really want this child or I could do
[4:43] away with that child you always love to
[4:45] embrace God because they came out of you
[4:47] amen
[4:48] that's how it is with God God doesn't
[4:49] look for opportunities to get rid of us
[4:51] God's trying to keep us God's trying to
[4:53] help us grow God's trying to help us to
[4:55] be real sons and daughters amen amen
[4:58] and so the incredible detail of the law
[5:00] was to show us the incredible character
[5:03] of Jesus Christ
[5:04] like I said I can only scratch the
[5:06] surface of it no I just want to review a
[5:07] little bit on the purpose and pattern I
[5:09] want to add a few things
[5:11] God had Moses built this Tabernacle so
[5:14] he could dwell with them
[5:16] right uh and and this is what God wanted
[5:19] God wanted to be right in the center
[5:21] remember the picture I showed it to you
[5:22] Wednesday uh God one let me just go back
[5:25] I might as well go back this okay I'm
[5:27] gonna slide 63 up let's go back to the
[5:28] beginning God wanted to dwell with them
[5:33] there is
[5:34] and I know it's God God would dwell here
[5:36] so God wanted to be at the very center
[5:38] of their lives that's right that's what
[5:41] it is today Church you know love loving
[5:43] Jesus should be at the very center of
[5:45] your life amen don't make it the outside
[5:47] thing the last thing you get to make it
[5:50] the very first thing amen
[5:52] amen make it your motivation make it
[5:54] your love make it your strength put
[5:56] Jesus Christ at the very center meet
[5:58] with him every day so he guides your
[6:00] full day praise God and make sure you do
[6:03] a morning and evening sacrifice
[6:05] amen start the day with him end today
[6:07] with him break up spend the whole day
[6:09] with him he was he wants to dwell with
[6:11] us praise God that's why he added this
[6:13] Tabernacle place there so he could speak
[6:15] to them dwell with them Hallelujah be
[6:18] with them and that's what he wants in
[6:19] our lives he wants to be with us
[6:20] constantly amen
[6:22] Hallelujah so look at that Wednesday
[6:24] that he wanted to dwell with them now
[6:26] 63.
[6:29] yeah
[6:30] and notice also commune now here's where
[6:33] it was you
[6:34] talk with us now most of us don't hear
[6:36] voices some of us do like maybe Brother
[6:38] Ray from time to time and he's not here
[6:40] but uh you know just know people that
[6:42] sometimes hear the voice of God so you
[6:43] have to understand there's there's a
[6:45] certain kind of communion God has with
[6:47] you in other words God will show you
[6:49] when he's speaking to you
[6:51] and you'll learn to understand okay this
[6:53] is God speaking to me here and normally
[6:55] church it's completely different than
[6:57] our human thoughts that's why when the
[6:59] Bible says be transformed that transform
[7:02] is the same word as Transfiguration on
[7:04] Mount Transfiguration so Jesus was
[7:07] standing like a man like brother amen
[7:09] but then when he was transfigured he was
[7:10] as bright as the sun that's the great
[7:13] difference between our thoughts and
[7:15] God's thoughts amen when God speaks to
[7:18] you glory when God communes with you
[7:20] it's the difference between regular and
[7:22] Supernatural praise God
[7:25] Hallelujah
[7:26] that's the reality of God communing with
[7:29] us praise God because God says I want to
[7:32] meet with them I want to dwell among
[7:33] them so I can talk with them so I can
[7:36] fellas it with them so I can know them
[7:38] and they can know me praise God
[7:40] Hallelujah to know Christ that's what
[7:42] Paul said that's the greatest thing to
[7:44] know Christ and him crucified Hallelujah
[7:47] wake up
[7:48] now we looked at the five applications
[7:50] I'm just gonna add a little bit more I'm
[7:52] not gonna do any really review I'm just
[7:53] going to add more on it like I said you
[7:55] can easily listen to the sermon uh I'm
[7:57] sorry it cut off two-thirds of the way
[7:58] through so I'm sorry about that
[8:03] the softwares I think it's the software
[8:05] because I bought a new computer so it's
[8:07] got to do the software but sorry about
[8:09] that but we just want to add a little
[8:10] more now
[8:11] Israel's approach to meet with God was
[8:13] quite plain I want to just look at this
[8:15] thought though
[8:17] uh that the Tabernacle had outer
[8:19] curtains and also one gate or one door
[8:21] and remember all this pointed to Christ
[8:24] so when you would come here if you were
[8:26] a worshiper
[8:27] you could not get in if you were unclean
[8:31] and you had to be honest if you were
[8:33] dishonest and you had touched something
[8:35] dead and you tried to get it and they
[8:37] found out later you'd be killed yeah
[8:39] because God said you defiled My
[8:41] Sanctuary
[8:43] praise God you don't you don't come to
[8:44] God to file you come to God God has a
[8:47] way for you to come you've come by
[8:48] getting his cleansing work on your life
[8:50] praise God
[8:51] Hallelujah
[8:53] so if you had no sin this is what you'd
[8:55] see you'd see this white uh this white
[8:57] structure a white fence and that was
[9:00] your meeting place with God praise God
[9:02] but you didn't come there uh just
[9:05] without being cleansed you had to be
[9:06] cleansed before you'd let be let in
[9:08] praise God now the outer curtains the
[9:11] Bible said uh
[9:13] were hangings of fine twine linen of a
[9:17] hundred cubits long for one side
[9:20] so you would see it on the side back
[9:21] there in the picture you'd see white all
[9:23] the way around so goddess house was the
[9:25] White House amen
[9:27] because white represents the
[9:30] righteousness of saints praise God
[9:32] that's what the Bible says for God hath
[9:35] made Jesus to be sin for us who knew no
[9:37] sin that we might be made the
[9:40] righteousness of God in Christ amen
[9:42] praise God in other words please we
[9:45] Christ shares his righteousness with us
[9:48] praise God
[9:49] he became our sin he shares his
[9:52] righteousness with us and the Bible said
[9:54] in Revelation 19 at the battle of
[9:56] Armageddon Jesus comes back and with his
[9:59] army his armies his bride her and she's
[10:02] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[10:04] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[10:06] of saints you and I have no no
[10:08] righteousness of our own our
[10:10] righteousness is like bloody filthy rags
[10:13] and we have no righteousness of our own
[10:15] the only righteousness we have is what
[10:18] God will share with us amen amen which
[10:20] he will give to us as a gift
[10:22] for repenting and believing in his son
[10:25] Jesus Christ
[10:26] so the white violin represents the
[10:29] Holiness of Jesus Christ
[10:32] right and so the outer curtain of course
[10:35] there were 60 pillars total
[10:37] and now Church you know you see in the
[10:38] scripture here each pillar had sockets
[10:42] of brass and hooks uh and fillets of
[10:46] silver and I don't I forgot to get a
[10:47] picture up here to show you but if you
[10:49] have to look at the intricate details uh
[10:51] you would see that these pillars were
[10:53] made of wood which is humanity
[10:56] would always represent represents
[10:58] Humanity
[10:59] okay just like that uh like uh Paul said
[11:02] Paul said there's four kinds of vessels
[11:04] right gold silver wood and Earth
[11:07] so wood represents that that third one
[11:10] like Judas is scared it's still for burn
[11:12] right it's to be burned represents the
[11:14] humanity
[11:16] now each one has grass sockets and Brass
[11:19] represents sin has already been judged
[11:22] when uh when the when the people
[11:24] complain when Israel complained the
[11:25] Wilderness uh God told Moses go get a
[11:28] brass serpent and they just have to look
[11:30] and live they didn't have to do anything
[11:31] else they just had to look at God's uh
[11:34] God's servant and they were healed
[11:38] they didn't have to memorize the
[11:39] scripture
[11:40] right they didn't have to recite a Creed
[11:43] they'd have to pray 10 times but they
[11:46] just had to look and live Church you
[11:48] just gotta look to Christ and live amen
[11:50] amen sometimes there's no we got to
[11:52] memorize scripture to train our bodies
[11:54] and my husband just for salvation you
[11:56] just gotta look and hold yourself Turn
[11:58] Your Eyes Upon Jesus look forward to his
[12:01] face just revenge of your sins just look
[12:03] and live and God will do the Reckless
[12:05] work if you just look to Heaven praise
[12:07] God
[12:08] Hallelujah
[12:10] and silver speaks of redemption because
[12:12] every man had to pay a shekel of silver
[12:15] in order to redeem his soul every year
[12:18] to the Tabernacle that kept the money
[12:20] flowing and it gave them you know the
[12:22] funds they needed to support all the
[12:24] work of the Tabernacle and God
[12:26] specifically said silver shekels for the
[12:29] Redemption of your soul so you're
[12:31] reminded that your soul was purchased it
[12:34] was redeemed your soul was rescued from
[12:37] Death unto I praise God
[12:39] and so see each one now you can spend
[12:41] the whole service just on this aspect
[12:43] right and I'm not going to do that but I
[12:45] just want you to see some of these
[12:46] aspects of it when you come to the
[12:48] Tabernacle you'd see white the
[12:49] righteousness of Christ you would see
[12:52] the humanity of Christ amen you see
[12:54] Jesus as wrath remember when Jesus comes
[12:57] back to Revelation uh the Bible says his
[13:00] feet are his brass
[13:03] that means he's already judged a sin
[13:06] praise God the Bible said he's trotted
[13:08] the right wine press of the fiercest and
[13:11] Wrath of almighty God he already walked
[13:14] through the fires of Affliction so we
[13:16] don't have to praise God Amen he's
[13:18] walked through that difficult fire he's
[13:20] walked through the wrath of God so we
[13:22] don't have to and then he gave us a
[13:24] white God praise God
[13:26] he took away our dirty garments and
[13:28] closed us with life his own
[13:30] righteousness praise God
[13:32] so we see that he defeated our sins for
[13:35] us amen amen what a blessing praise God
[13:38] so you can see all these types now
[13:39] remember there's only one gate or one
[13:42] door there's only one way in to the
[13:45] Tabernacle
[13:47] and notice it was a it was a hanging so
[13:49] the gate was a hanging and they'd have
[13:51] to move it to the side it had the colors
[13:54] of blue purple and Scarlet again fine
[13:57] twine linen
[13:58] so they'll give you the righteousness of
[14:00] Christ it has the pillars and I'm not
[14:03] going to focus on that but there was one
[14:05] way in right and Jesus said I am the
[14:08] door of the Sheep
[14:10] so this one entrance so there's always
[14:12] going to be one way in praise God
[14:15] all that ever came before Jesus were
[14:17] thieves and robbers the Sheep did not
[14:19] hear them but Jesus said I am the door
[14:21] if any man enter in he shall be saved
[14:24] and go in and out and find pasture right
[14:26] now David I live church that's what we
[14:29] should come in when we come to the
[14:31] message when we don't come through
[14:32] William Branham we come through Jesus
[14:34] Christ amen William Brandon was just
[14:36] pointing us into the door amen but Jesus
[14:39] is the door praise God you know I always
[14:42] listen always listen uh to these guys
[14:44] that leave the message and I hear their
[14:46] testimonies and it's so sad they were
[14:48] raised in message charges to essentially
[14:50] worship Brothers
[14:52] he said they wouldn't even the one guy
[14:54] left and now he's criticizing brother
[14:55] but he he said he was raised just to
[14:58] listen to things he never read his Bible
[15:00] because they were told when Roman reads
[15:02] the scripture that that's the only
[15:03] interpretation that you can have of the
[15:05] Bible
[15:06] now we know about a man grew in his
[15:07] Revelation right like the white horse
[15:09] rider so many examples you could give
[15:11] but I thought isn't that so sad in other
[15:13] words these churches were making brother
[15:16] Brown the dog
[15:17] my brother Brandon was just like the
[15:19] wood
[15:20] you were just Humanity
[15:22] but that wasn't the type brother man is
[15:25] not the type of the door Jesus Christ is
[15:27] the type of the door Brother Brad had no
[15:30] righteousness of his own Jesus is the
[15:32] only one who have righteousness so thank
[15:34] God we come through the door the right
[15:35] door praise God
[15:37] amen no doubt they came through a door
[15:39] but it was the wrong door to the wrong
[15:41] phone it was to go pastures not the
[15:43] Sheep pasture praise God
[15:46] Under the Sea patch
[15:48] how do you know we got a bunch of sheep
[15:51] around me a lot of I hear the Sheep
[15:53] bleeding praise God I hear the voice of
[15:55] sheep I see the character of sheep I see
[15:57] the humanity of God's people who are all
[15:59] defended by the one Shepherd that's
[16:01] Jesus Christ amen
[16:04] one door
[16:06] no
[16:09] church I'm saved not because of what
[16:11] I've done but because I've come to the
[16:13] right door
[16:14] if you walked in that Tabernacle you and
[16:17] God forgiven you would know I'm saved
[16:20] I'm forgiven because I came in the right
[16:22] door praise God man I didn't go to
[16:24] anybody else's door any other
[16:26] impersonator's door I just went through
[16:28] God's door and the Bible said if I go
[16:31] through Jesus the door I say hallelujah
[16:34] that's the confidence we have in Christ
[16:36] people can say what they want they could
[16:38] call me a Judas they could call you
[16:39] whatever they can say anything they want
[16:41] but that doesn't take away the fact that
[16:44] you know you've gone through the right
[16:46] door praise God
[16:49] be baptized every one of you in the name
[16:52] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[16:54] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[16:56] the Holy Ghost In other words repent
[16:58] come through the gate amen go through
[17:00] the outer core and the inner core and
[17:02] you shall reach the holiest of holies
[17:04] amen hallelujah
[17:07] now
[17:09] anyone can look if you looked at the
[17:11] scripture
[17:12] yesterday I had to say a lot of free
[17:13] time it was actually quite strange we
[17:15] had stayed at home to hold out didn't do
[17:16] any errands yesterday it was one of the
[17:18] weirdest days of my life
[17:20] it's kind of said oh why time to look
[17:22] about the sky and it was so beautiful
[17:23] blue yesterday if I was doing it most
[17:26] beautiful Blues you'd ever want to see
[17:27] yesterday hopefully you can get some of
[17:29] that today it's a little overcast though
[17:30] but blue you know this this this uh this
[17:33] uh this hanging here was blue purple and
[17:37] Scarlet so blue represents heavily so
[17:39] we're learning about Jesus when you come
[17:42] to Jesus you're coming the Heavenly way
[17:45] right because that's what his color is
[17:47] blue you come to him he's the Heavenly
[17:49] way also there's purple which represents
[17:52] royalty when Jesus crucified when they
[17:54] put a purple robe on him to mock it oh
[17:57] here's hilar key lrk purple always
[17:59] that's royalty so when we come uh Jesus
[18:02] way we're coming the way of the king uh
[18:05] we're coming the way of Heaven's cave
[18:07] praise God hallelujah Heaven's King and
[18:10] Scarlet represents he bore our sins
[18:13] because Isaiah says though your sins be
[18:15] as Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[18:17] so we see this is the way in knowing
[18:20] that God sent Jesus from heaven and this
[18:23] is the Heavenly Kingdom's way to Bear
[18:25] our sins our sins will be done away with
[18:28] our sins will all be parted if we come
[18:30] God's provide a way through the one door
[18:33] the one day and Jesus is the dog oh
[18:37] thanks so much and takes away all the
[18:39] feeder Church yeah yeah when you see
[18:41] this what because this is all pointing
[18:43] to somebody not pointing to me it's all
[18:45] going to Christ the word amen
[18:48] remember these are better promises we
[18:52] are beautiful promises but we have
[18:53] better promises than that praise God
[18:56] Hallelujah now I want to add a little
[18:58] bit more just to prove I felt like I
[19:00] should prove a little bit more on this
[19:01] and maybe go a little deeper so inside
[19:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we'd say
[19:05] inside your soul the word of God is
[19:09] written upon the fleshy tables of your
[19:10] heart
[19:12] so now you have Heaven's will inside
[19:14] your heart
[19:16] praise God I believe that's a little
[19:17] buzzer that goes off but Iran says if
[19:19] you got the word of God and something
[19:20] goes against that it's a little buzzer
[19:23] Ah that's not right that's not that God
[19:25] put it in your heart to save your life
[19:27] I'm sorry brother to save your life
[19:31] to protect your life
[19:33] now the man I said was the original seed
[19:36] and I I thought about that why did I say
[19:37] that and so I got the scripture on that
[19:40] and then the rod is a resurrected life a
[19:44] resurrected testimony
[19:46] now here's where I knew I knew it was a
[19:48] c but I had to find the scripture until
[19:50] yesterday
[19:51] Exodus 16 31 the house of Israel called
[19:54] the name thereof Manna which means what
[19:56] is it and it was like a coriander seed
[19:59] white the taste of it was like the
[20:02] Wafers made of honey
[20:05] so that's why the Bible says You must be
[20:08] born again of The Incorruptible seed the
[20:11] word of God
[20:12] Amen so see Manna is like a seed and
[20:17] your soul is a place that's likened unto
[20:20] having a seed
[20:21] praise God
[20:23] and of course this was the original seed
[20:26] for there it is the original was Manna
[20:27] From Heaven this is a scene from Heaven
[20:29] praise God
[20:31] God's nature God's character a seed from
[20:35] heaven where does it live listen your
[20:37] soul praise God
[20:38] Hallelujah
[20:43] no the rod of Aaron I want to add a
[20:46] little more on that rate gave me a good
[20:47] thought and uh after service I'm like no
[20:48] I never knew that but let me look that
[20:50] up the Bible's at number 17. now here's
[20:53] where we get Aaron's Rob
[20:55] now just to give you a background of the
[20:57] story Cora and Nathan were some famous
[21:00] men in Israel and they said you know
[21:02] what Moses and air we're just as holy as
[21:04] you we'd like to go in and offer incense
[21:07] we wanted to go in the Holy place and mo
[21:10] said no no no God's chosen us you guys
[21:13] you guys are going to take care of the
[21:14] Tabernacle Furniture you're just gonna
[21:16] pack a carrot
[21:18] the God has called us this he said no he
[21:20] said no no no we we're just as holy as
[21:22] you are and Moses fell down on his face
[21:24] and cried out to God and God said have
[21:27] every one of those men bring their rod
[21:29] and say
[21:33] he said the one that brings forth fruit
[21:35] he said that's the one I've chosen to be
[21:38] my minister
[21:40] right you know the story right
[21:43] God and Moses said if these men die
[21:46] regular death then God didn't send me I
[21:48] think God swallowed him up in the earth
[21:50] if I'm not mistaken yeah
[21:52] yeah so all these other men die poor
[21:54] days and all these men died
[21:56] but when they went in the the holiest of
[21:58] holies the only Rod they brought out the
[22:01] only one that had in life was Aaron's
[22:03] rock and Aaron's Rod here brought forth
[22:06] buds had blossoms and yielded almonds
[22:11] and Moses brought out all the rides
[22:12] before the Lord under the children of
[22:14] Israel they looked and took every man
[22:15] this round
[22:16] and the Lord said to Moses bring Aaron's
[22:18] Rod again before the testimony to be
[22:21] kept for a token against the rebels and
[22:23] thou shalt quite take away their
[22:25] murmings from me that they die now so
[22:27] see this was an issue of people
[22:28] complaining against the the prophet and
[22:31] the priesthood
[22:32] right now Aaron's Rod types Christ
[22:36] because Aaron was God's chosen minister
[22:39] so is Christ God's chosen Minister and
[22:43] he proved it by the power of
[22:45] Resurrection
[22:48] amen thank God that church in all men
[22:51] here
[22:53] it resembles a peach tree
[22:56] uh but I want to read this part here
[23:00] the reason it's given a special account
[23:02] it's putting forth it blossoms is so
[23:05] early generally generally uh February
[23:09] sometimes even January
[23:11] okay
[23:13] so in other words all friends are the
[23:16] first to Blossom
[23:18] and when Aaron's Rod got the prince of
[23:20] God it didn't bring forth peaches or
[23:22] anything like that or Outlaws it brought
[23:25] forth almonds
[23:27] they brought forth the first fruits
[23:30] Hallelujah
[23:31] and every man in his own order Christ is
[23:35] the what first fruits afterwards and
[23:39] it's coming
[23:40] Hallelujah so God had to have almonds
[23:43] come out because it shows that here this
[23:46] Aaron's preacher would be would be
[23:47] recognized with the resurrection Aaron
[23:50] would have the connection to the
[23:52] Everlasting God the god of Resurrection
[23:54] praise God
[23:55] Hallelujah
[23:58] Aaron had the connection to the
[24:00] resurrection
[24:01] now also it's interesting too is uh God
[24:05] gave Jeremiah a vision and he said what
[24:07] see us now Jeremiah chapter one he said
[24:09] I see a rod of an almond tree
[24:12] then the Lord said unto me thus well
[24:14] seen for I will hasten my word to
[24:17] perform it so all men can offer also
[24:19] represent God's watchfulness to perform
[24:22] his word in other words God's word
[24:25] churches ought to make us so happy today
[24:26] God will not delay the Fulfillment of
[24:30] his word amen just because it hasn't
[24:33] happened yet doesn't mean it's not going
[24:35] to God watches over his word like he
[24:38] brings forth the almonds he brings the
[24:40] first verse in other words God is going
[24:42] to bring his promises the best the
[24:45] Rapture is coming I don't care what
[24:46] anybody says God is going to make sure
[24:48] God watches over every promise and it
[24:51] will come to pass in his time
[24:54] Hallelujah that's what the Almond
[24:56] represents I'm going to watch over my
[24:58] word you can Bank on my word my word
[25:01] will happen before anything else happens
[25:03] amen praise God in other words church
[25:07] God is always on time
[25:10] encourage us don't be frustrated if we
[25:12] have to wait right
[25:14] we just have a we have to sign that song
[25:16] says just a few more weary days and then
[25:20] I'll Fly Away
[25:23] it's just a few weary days God's Eternal
[25:25] God's outside of time God's not looking
[25:28] at your talking God is looking at his
[25:30] timepiece
[25:31] Hallelujah and he Likens this almond why
[25:34] did Ayers rod bring almonds the
[25:36] resurrection God was performing his word
[25:39] God was going to perform his
[25:40] resurrection power through the ministry
[25:42] of Moses and error
[25:47] out of Egypt what's that Resurrection
[25:51] he said well now I bring my son out of
[25:54] Egypt out of Egypt haven't I called my
[25:56] son Amen in other words you never forget
[25:59] about us son was dead and sins and
[26:01] transgressions his son was dead Israel
[26:03] was dead in the Abominations of Egypt
[26:05] but God had called his son out come out
[26:08] of there come out of there come into
[26:10] life praise God
[26:11] [Applause]
[26:15] no they waited 400 years or some say 430
[26:18] the Bible says that
[26:19] there's a little extended time here
[26:21] although we had to wait 430 years God
[26:24] was hey God was hastening to perform his
[26:26] work
[26:27] that's right
[26:29] so never be discouraged God's timing is
[26:31] always perfect
[26:33] he's going to watch over it like the old
[26:35] amen
[26:36] notice he says the Almond in February or
[26:39] January that months before the first of
[26:41] the first fruits
[26:45] way before it's months before God always
[26:49] sends that reminder I'm watching my word
[26:52] my word will come to pass look for that
[26:54] first fruit that proves I always keep my
[26:57] word
[26:58] oh thank God amen amen in church if you
[27:02] remember that almond was even on that
[27:04] Menorah too
[27:05] what's that Menorah that's the type of
[27:07] your life and the Seven Church ages
[27:10] almonds were on there blossoms were on
[27:12] there
[27:13] does the bible say that we're a part of
[27:16] the Church of the firstborn
[27:18] amen praise God the dead in Christ rise
[27:22] fire Satan Hallelujah
[27:25] that's not Menorah River says the seven
[27:27] Church ages all men are on that menorah
[27:31] because we're the Church of the
[27:33] firstborn the dead in Christ will rise
[27:36] first how many believe that
[27:38] God's watching over his word God is
[27:40] going to bring it to past Church
[27:44] also Aaron and his sons would bear
[27:47] Israel's iniquity type in Christ bearing
[27:50] our iniquities as Heaven's high priest
[27:52] that's what numbers 18. so after Aaron's
[27:55] Rod budded the Lord said to Aaron thou
[27:58] thy Sons thy father's house with thee
[28:00] shalt bear the iniquity of the sanctuary
[28:03] in other words they had to deal with the
[28:05] sins of the people
[28:06] the bear
[28:08] the Bible said that to Bear their own
[28:09] sins
[28:10] on the down the on the day of atonement
[28:12] Aaron had to First go in there and make
[28:14] atonement for his sins
[28:16] before he could help the people oh and
[28:18] not a good lessons amen but in other
[28:20] words before you can help anybody you
[28:21] gotta ask forgiveness for your sins
[28:24] because the Bible said of our hearts
[28:25] condemn us we're not going to get what
[28:27] we asked for yeah
[28:29] say what a great lesson what a great
[28:31] lesson
[28:32] see and that church that's what we're
[28:33] here to do as well as spiritual Kings
[28:35] and Priests we're here to Bear people's
[28:37] burdens come up beside them and help
[28:40] them say Hey Brother here just come
[28:41] under my shoulder God's made me strong
[28:43] for this season you come I'm going to
[28:44] help you out by God's grace is that
[28:47] right bear bear burdens pray for them if
[28:49] they're battling suicide give them Words
[28:51] of Life praise God
[28:53] if they're bowel and depression give
[28:55] them words of Hope God's gonna change
[28:57] his situation around God can turn it
[28:59] around God will do great things you can
[29:01] trust God's gonna bring you up praise
[29:03] God Amen
[29:06] bearing the iniquity of the sanctuary
[29:08] number church that's when Daniel got
[29:09] that Revelation about the 70 weeks he
[29:12] got it after confessing the sins of his
[29:15] fathers and Israel for 21 days
[29:19] he confessed their sins see Barry not
[29:21] that you're guilty but it's of your
[29:23] father's sins or mother's sins but the
[29:25] fact that you're so burned over sins you
[29:28] just want God to forgive sins and you
[29:30] want God's will for your life
[29:32] oh hallelujah what do you want God's
[29:34] will today amen glory
[29:38] then the Bible say Jesus was wounded
[29:40] broad transgressions he was bruised for
[29:42] our iniquities Who Bore our iniquities
[29:43] Christ did
[29:46] the whipping of our peace was upon him
[29:50] and with his stripes we are here let's
[29:53] say I'm him we stand together I'm Healed
[29:55] I'm Healed today praise God I'm Healed
[29:58] my wife is healed amen I'm just
[30:00] believing praise God with his stripes we
[30:03] were healed praise God
[30:05] only all we like cheaper going straight
[30:07] we've turned everyone his own way and
[30:09] the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of
[30:12] us all
[30:13] so again Christ like was the anti-type
[30:16] of Aaron
[30:17] oh he had to Bear the iniquity he took
[30:20] care of our sins
[30:22] Church our sins are put away amen oh
[30:25] thank God Amen
[30:30] okay that's a little I want to add on
[30:31] that part
[30:32] now also the Tabernacle represented
[30:36] Jesus's body
[30:39] I don't know if you do this I've heard
[30:40] this is a good thought I forgot about
[30:41] this but I heard it before John 1 verse
[30:44] 1. in the beginning was the word the
[30:46] word was with God and the Word was God
[30:49] and he would and he was clothed with a
[30:51] Vester dipped in Blood and his name is
[30:53] called the word of God
[30:55] so Jesus is the word
[31:00] now I don't you remember this I heard
[31:03] this song Go the word was in verse 14
[31:05] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[31:08] Us now the word dwelt means Tabernacle
[31:11] to set up a tent
[31:14] praise God
[31:16] so Jesus the logos
[31:19] created a tent he constructed a tent in
[31:23] the womb of Mary praise God Amen
[31:25] hi area the worm was made flesh
[31:30] and dwell Among Us here's what the
[31:33] actual Greek means to fix one's
[31:35] Tabernacle have one's Tabernacle abide
[31:38] or live in a tabernacle or tent to dwell
[31:42] so the word fix his Tabernacle and dwell
[31:47] Among Us praise God hallelujah I love it
[31:50] it's the only time it's used in the New
[31:51] Testament
[31:52] praise God
[31:55] it was he was made flesh and grown Among
[31:58] Us God set up his beautiful Tabernacle
[32:00] and that was the body of Jesus Christ
[32:02] didn't Jesus say the same he answered
[32:04] and said unto them destroy this temple
[32:06] in three days I'll raise it up then the
[32:08] Jews said 40 and six years was this
[32:09] temple building will thou reared up
[32:11] three days but he spoke of the Temple of
[32:14] his body
[32:15] Hallelujah
[32:17] so we see
[32:19] God wanted to dwell amongst his people
[32:22] and so he built a tabernacle it's
[32:25] totally different
[32:26] this time he didn't have all these men
[32:28] work on it like bezelio and Moses and
[32:30] Aaron this time he had a conceived by
[32:33] the Holy Spirit In the Womb of a virgin
[32:35] amen amen
[32:36] Hallelujah where God constructed that
[32:39] Tabernacle amen
[32:41] God made that sound God made that egg
[32:44] God brought them together praise God God
[32:46] knit together this Tabernacle in Mary's
[32:49] womb God is the author God of this
[32:51] Tabernacle and then God said I'm going
[32:52] to come live in this Tabernacle oh
[32:56] Hallelujah not for a little while not
[32:57] off and on but I'm going to dwell in it
[32:59] praise God continually
[33:03] Oh What a Beautiful story
[33:06] beautiful lesson we get
[33:08] now this is a long chapter and I just
[33:10] feel led like I just want to read it
[33:12] here most of it
[33:14] it is not possible that the blood of
[33:16] bulls and goats should take away sins
[33:19] wherefore when you cometh into the world
[33:20] he says sacrifice and offering now is
[33:22] prepared that I'm sorry that word is not
[33:24] but a body thou has prepared me
[33:28] in birth offering and sacrifices for sin
[33:30] thou Hast had no pleasure now look God
[33:33] would forgive them when they get into
[33:34] animals but it really wasn't God's
[33:35] pleasure
[33:37] okay
[33:39] a body was prepared for True sacrifice
[33:42] Jesus said lo I come in the volume of
[33:45] the book it is written of me to do thy
[33:48] will o God
[33:51] a church if only each one of us could
[33:52] say that today
[33:54] Lord I'd come in today I'm living this
[33:57] life in 2022 not to do my will but to do
[34:01] your will praise God
[34:04] in other words I'm looking in the word
[34:05] of God what is the word of God say for
[34:08] us and Laramie to do for God
[34:10] what does the word of God say for Jesse
[34:13] Smith what is God's will for my life God
[34:16] show me what's written of me in this
[34:18] book and let me do it praise God Amen
[34:21] that's a real Southern dog of God
[34:23] hallelujah
[34:25] I come to do God's will I don't come to
[34:27] do my will
[34:29] and when I don't do God's will
[34:32] quickly let me know of it convict me of
[34:34] it and let me repent of my will and let
[34:36] God's will be done
[34:38] but Jesus never failed we can't be that
[34:41] perfect but we can strive to do that
[34:44] because you're all striving for
[34:45] something right
[34:47] girls striving to what are you striving
[34:49] for well
[34:50] gotta get this I gotta get that I gotta
[34:52] feed them I gotta do this but we should
[34:54] be striving for the will of God Amen
[34:55] Above All Else
[34:59] above when he said sacrifice and
[35:01] offering and burnt offerings and
[35:02] offering for sin not what it's not
[35:04] neither has pleasure therein which are
[35:06] offered by the law then he said lo I
[35:08] come to do thy will o God he taketh away
[35:10] the first that he may establish the
[35:12] second he took away the law that even
[35:13] established Grace amen by which will we
[35:17] are Sanctified through the offering of
[35:19] the body of Jesus Christ what's for all
[35:24] Hallelujah I'm gonna read that again we
[35:26] are Sanctified through the body of Jesus
[35:28] Christ once for oh praise God it is a
[35:33] one and done work praise God
[35:36] I don't have to go given more sacrifices
[35:39] it was one and finished hallelujah amen
[35:43] the effects of Calvary are still
[35:46] available today all the benefits of the
[35:48] Cross and the resurrection are here
[35:50] today we must be Sanctified and praise
[35:53] God and Jesus will wash us and he'll
[35:55] give us all that we have need on praise
[35:56] God
[35:57] once for all
[36:02] every priest stands daily ministering an
[36:04] offering oftentimes the same sacrifices
[36:07] which can never take away
[36:09] but this man after he'd offered one
[36:12] sacrifice for sins for
[36:16] not just for emphasis or Smyrna or
[36:19] pergamos authority or Sardis or laodicea
[36:22] or Philadelphia but forever for learn to
[36:25] see us the same blood has never left his
[36:28] power amen it is not lost his power we
[36:31] have access to the blessings of the
[36:32] blood of the dead because there was one
[36:34] sacrifice once and for all and its
[36:37] blessings last forever
[36:40] then what do you do you sat down on the
[36:42] right hand of God that's when you know
[36:43] you rested you can sit down Hallelujah
[36:47] he defeated death Hallelujah hell Satan
[36:51] every demon and he goes up to heaven
[36:53] gives us blood Hallelujah laces brother
[36:55] on The Mercy Seat and he sits down and
[36:57] said now forever I'm reigning over sins
[37:00] I've forgiven their sins the one and
[37:02] only sacrifice my people are sinners my
[37:06] people are forgiveness praise God
[37:08] Hallelujah
[37:11] God help us
[37:14] to never doubt that our sins are totally
[37:16] done away if we doubt our sins are taken
[37:19] care of then we doubt Hebrews chapter
[37:20] 10.
[37:22] praise God
[37:26] forever
[37:27] once and for all forever my sins are
[37:30] done away with once and for all and
[37:33] forever
[37:34] oh Hallelujah
[37:37] from henceforth expecting till his
[37:39] enemies be made his foot still so he's
[37:41] waiting all these enemies will be to be
[37:43] put under his feet for by one offering
[37:46] he has perfected forever them that are
[37:48] sanctified
[37:51] see this one offering will make you
[37:53] complete forever praise God
[37:55] just let the Holy Spirit sanctify your
[37:58] life amen amen let it sanctify you let
[38:00] it clean you out every single day amen
[38:04] see this one offering perfects forever
[38:07] them who are Sanctified cleaned out and
[38:10] set aside for service praise God
[38:13] wherefore the Holy Ghost is also
[38:15] witnessed to us for after that he had
[38:17] said before this is the Covenant I'll
[38:18] make with them after these days saith
[38:20] the Lord I'll put my laws in their
[38:22] hearts and their minds will I write them
[38:24] and their sins and iniquities will I
[38:26] remember no more Church no more God
[38:29] remembers our sins no more
[38:31] man now where remission of these is
[38:34] there's no more offering for sin
[38:37] having therefore brother so how should
[38:39] we react to this
[38:41] the Bible tells us

[40:32] body was torn open

[43:39] let's look at just briefly the
[43:40] representation I don't think I have a
[43:42] hold on on this one but the Tabernacle
[43:44] represents your body as God's Tabernacle
[43:49] right
[43:52] in Exodus 25 verse 90. uh according to
[43:55] all that I show thee after the pattern
[43:57] of this Tabernacle
[43:59] after the pattern now Peter says Before
[44:02] Peter dies he writes this last letter
[44:03] before he died yeah I think at me as
[44:06] long as I am in this Tabernacle
[44:09] to stir you up by putting you in
[44:11] remembrance now look Peter says if I
[44:13] preach to you and I remind you the
[44:15] things of God that will stir your
[44:17] Tabernacle of
[44:19] in other words that will bring the glory
[44:20] of God back
[44:22] Hallelujah
[44:24] we don't raise our hands but all of us
[44:25] are probably felt where's the glory of
[44:27] God where's the glory I used to feel
[44:30] where's that original seal I used to
[44:33] have for God where's that excitement I
[44:35] used to have for singing over here in
[44:37] the word of God where's that Glory the
[44:39] Bible says God will serve up by
[44:41] reminding you of his promises
[44:45] Oh I thought Peter said as long as I'm
[44:48] in this Tabernacle I'm going to serve
[44:50] other Tabernacles amen
[44:53] knowing I must shortly put off this my
[44:57] Tabernacle
[44:58] even as the Lord Jesus Christ has showed
[45:00] me he said I'm soon to die
[45:04] all right I went to that funeral this
[45:05] week of my friend who passed away at 64.
[45:08] and I told the family you know what I
[45:10] told him

[45:31] I got to tell him I have to look at his
[45:32] son and his wife in the aisle I got
[45:34] tears rolling down my face and I said
[45:35] the day before he died I got to tell God
[45:38] honors men like you I got I put my arm
[45:40] around him and told him that you've been
[45:42] faithful to your wife you've been loved

[1:11:02] oh sorry I'm a priest unto God I know
[1:11:05] there's times in seasons for their
[1:11:06] second shift people in here that's why
[1:11:07] I'm talking to Austin about I'm just
[1:11:09] saying when you know it's the devil
[1:11:11] well you know I said that we're trying
[1:11:12] to steal your metric praise God

[1:11:20] time God is give me this time to worship
[1:11:22] Him intercede for others and petition
[1:11:26] see brother Bill was real glad he prayed
[1:11:27] for him because the MRSA left
[1:11:30] how that happened was you interceded for
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:35] his wife should have kind of calls to
[1:11:36] church no doubt maybe they pray but how
[1:11:39] many sinisters do they have in their
[1:11:40] lives God won't hear their prayers
[1:11:41] because of the sins that they have so
[1:11:43] whose prayers did he hear
[1:11:46] for my prayers
[1:11:49] I don't know about another church I'm
[1:11:51] just saying many times there are
[1:11:52] churches or sins like that in churches
[1:11:55] all right
[1:11:57] okay now this verse remember the Bible
[1:11:59] That's so small I didn't mean to do that
[1:12:00] but the Bible says may God sanctify you
[1:12:03] wholly that means every part your spirit
[1:12:05] your soul your body may it be preserved
[1:12:07] blameless under the coming of the Lord
[1:12:09] Jesus Christ
[1:12:10] okay so just like the old the Old
[1:12:13] Testament you have a body
[1:12:15] and the outer Court was like the body
[1:12:17] that you have okay
[1:12:19] three parts
[1:12:20] your human spirit
[1:12:22] is like the holy place
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:26] and then the Soul is like the holiest of
[1:12:29] holies
[1:12:31] ever understand that three parts
[1:12:35] and God wants his glory on every part
[1:12:39] on every part
[1:12:42] Just Like That Glory filled the house
[1:12:45] and the Bible said Moses and Aaron
[1:12:47] couldn't even minister in them they
[1:12:49] couldn't go in there because the power
[1:12:50] of God was on Earth
[1:12:53] that's what our lives should be like
[1:12:56] the power of God the glory of God on our
[1:12:59] lives
[1:13:01] Hallelujah
[1:13:04] and sometimes I'll come to church but
[1:13:05] amen I'll just share this
[1:13:07] I'll be a little tired Sunday morning
[1:13:08] and all of a sudden they'll hit it like
[1:13:10] what somebody hit last week There's a
[1:13:12] real Snappy upbeat song and I just it
[1:13:15] just lifted me right up out of my
[1:13:16] tiredness
[1:13:18] in other words the glory of God came
[1:13:19] back amen amen I needed a I needed an
[1:13:22] upbeat song brother and then God will
[1:13:24] lead you right to that song and go oh
[1:13:26] don't worry
[1:13:27] it brings the glory back praise God
[1:13:30] wants his glory on your flesh
[1:13:33] praise God God wants the glory in your
[1:13:35] minds you're thinking about the things
[1:13:36] of God I want you watching YouTube
[1:13:38] videos about God
[1:13:40] wants you listen to podcasts about God
[1:13:43] who just passed 500 dominoes by the way
[1:13:46] we're getting out there to different
[1:13:47] countries
[1:13:49] people thank God for that and thank God
[1:13:52] that there's a good alternative that the
[1:13:54] glory of God can remain on us praise God
[1:13:56] Amen he wants the glory in your soul by
[1:13:58] the grace of God
[1:14:01] now so that here's here's you you're the
[1:14:04] New Testament believer here's Israel now
[1:14:06] do I have any emotions on this okay
[1:14:08] remember Israel that Waters of
[1:14:10] Separation you need your first
[1:14:12] repentance
[1:14:13] Israel then had blood sacrifice and
[1:14:15] washing we have justification and water
[1:14:18] baptism you accept their sacrifice and
[1:14:20] price if you get baptized in water
[1:14:22] Israel had light bread incense we have
[1:14:25] sanctification by knowledge the word and
[1:14:27] prayer
[1:14:29] Israel had communion and fellowship with
[1:14:31] God we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:36] to say rocket science this is God in
[1:14:38] simplicity
[1:14:40] praise God now here for every service
[1:14:42] church every service this is my this is
[1:14:46] the lesson the lord gave me on the water
[1:14:47] separation
[1:14:49] how many fellowship with God every
[1:14:51] service amen where God talks to yourself
[1:14:53] the only way it's going to happen is if
[1:14:55] you first confess all your sins
[1:14:58] before every service
[1:15:00] or say like this even during then so
[1:15:02] from that point on whenever you confess
[1:15:04] it now you're going to get something out
[1:15:05] of the service
[1:15:06] George
[1:15:07] the reason people don't get anything out
[1:15:09] of church is because they fail to come
[1:15:11] the way the Bible says come
[1:15:14] they have sins that they they've hurt
[1:15:16] people they haven't repented of it
[1:15:18] they've done all kinds of evil things in
[1:15:20] their homes they haven't repented of it
[1:15:21] and they come to church and church we I
[1:15:24] preach about the blood of Jesus and
[1:15:25] baptism and don't move anybody
[1:15:28] or don't move those people that are in
[1:15:29] sin removes you if you're a believer
[1:15:32] you think about Jesus as the cross his
[1:15:34] love ran red
[1:15:36] are you watching the blood of the Lamb
[1:15:37] have you come to Jesus for the cleansing
[1:15:39] power it moves you
[1:15:41] because you confess all your sins
[1:15:44] and now this this worship means
[1:15:46] something
[1:15:48] the cross means something because you're
[1:15:51] sprinkled from an evil conscience amen
[1:15:53] no Hallelujah you haven't been touching
[1:15:55] dead things or you asked God and God
[1:15:57] forgave you of touching dead things amen
[1:16:00] we all do a church we all come on church
[1:16:02] I share a few days
[1:16:05] we all touch dead things we all say dead
[1:16:07] things we all do good things we don't
[1:16:09] think nothing but we must confess
[1:16:11] everything if the cross and the
[1:16:13] sacrifice and the Waters of washing are
[1:16:16] going to move us amen
[1:16:17] into the praise of God
[1:16:21] Hallelujah
[1:16:23] I know it does because remember when I
[1:16:24] preached on son of Manson of God said
[1:16:26] David
[1:16:27] I know it does
[1:16:29] because that lie went out from message
[1:16:31] churches saying we're we all have the
[1:16:33] son of man anointing that lie went out
[1:16:35] about nine years ago brother
[1:16:36] I never agreed with that
[1:16:40] but what I do I pray I call the presence
[1:16:42] of God and I'm coming to church and I
[1:16:44] get fellowship with the Lord and the
[1:16:46] Lord gives me verses that proves that
[1:16:49] God is speaking to my soul in other
[1:16:51] words God is giving me thus save the
[1:16:53] Lord when I come to church and he's
[1:16:55] speaking to me and I know they'll say
[1:16:57] the word we are not the Bible said are
[1:16:59] all Prophets
[1:17:00] do all speak with tongues
[1:17:02] you are all workers of Miracles see what
[1:17:05] I'm saying when we come the right way
[1:17:07] God will speak to us off the Throne of
[1:17:09] our soul and it'll give us truth it'll
[1:17:12] give us not save the Lord God communion
[1:17:14] with us and we just approach God to the
[1:17:16] Rivalry praise God
[1:17:20] that's just one example
[1:17:22] think about all these Joseph random
[1:17:23] false doctrines these message preachers
[1:17:25] they're the grace of all time see each
[1:17:27] time God gave us the word on that it was
[1:17:29] thus saith the Lord
[1:17:31] Scott was speaking to my soul
[1:17:35] and now I know I'm not a prophet I don't
[1:17:37] have Elijah's anointing on me but I got
[1:17:39] Jesus anointing on me
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:44] and the spirit of Jesus will produce the
[1:17:46] life of Jesus Amen sure see what I'm
[1:17:49] saying what if I would have came to
[1:17:51] church with an attitude against brother
[1:17:52] amen or Andrew against Jose or attitude
[1:17:55] against Lydia see I would not this would
[1:17:57] have meant nothing to me
[1:17:59] and ought to preach something false to
[1:18:01] kind of get at Lydia I'm going to try to
[1:18:02] get at nature or try to get a Victoria
[1:18:04] character I gotta Vendetta against him
[1:18:06] and then I never would have heard the
[1:18:07] voice of God in here I never heard
[1:18:11] because I didn't come God to provide a
[1:18:13] way
[1:18:17] that's why at the Baptist Church last
[1:18:18] week that's why I'm preaching about
[1:18:19] repentance
[1:18:21] nobody can even get here that's right
[1:18:23] not even one person not one person
[1:18:24] wanted to
[1:18:25] but he's battling Suicidal Thoughts to
[1:18:27] see he hasn't confessed all these so you
[1:18:29] can't even get here
[1:18:31] I invite all those people to come and
[1:18:32] prepare they don't come up why
[1:18:33] something's hindering them they haven't
[1:18:35] dealt with all the dead things in their
[1:18:37] lives does that help everybody I know
[1:18:40] it's repeat for our local church y'all
[1:18:42] preached in 2017.
[1:18:47] Austin and Lena to see that this is why
[1:18:50] the cross means nothing to people that's
[1:18:52] why that's why the Mysteries and the
[1:18:54] bread and prayer means nothing to people
[1:18:56] because they got sin out here God won't
[1:18:58] even let them in
[1:19:00] until they confess their sins
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:04] then I'll I'll study and pray I'll pray
[1:19:06] I'll study for hours brother I'll pray
[1:19:08] and people don't even get some people
[1:19:10] get nothing out of it why because
[1:19:11] they're not even they're not even in
[1:19:13] here how are they going to hear the
[1:19:15] voice of God but thus save the word
[1:19:17] whether they're not even in here
[1:19:20] how are they gonna they're not going to
[1:19:21] do it
[1:19:22] that's why
[1:19:24] Church always confess all your sins
[1:19:27] come in the friends of God
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:19:30] the Bible says get your mind right pray
[1:19:34] sing worship Hallelujah feel the prince
[1:19:38] of God become a part of this service
[1:19:41] Hallelujah so when the word of God
[1:19:43] speaks you know God is speaking you with
[1:19:45] thus saith the Lord
[1:19:47] that's God's communion with you
