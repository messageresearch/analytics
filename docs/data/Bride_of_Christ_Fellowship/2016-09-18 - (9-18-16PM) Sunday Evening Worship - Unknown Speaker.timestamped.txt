[24:43] lot going to take a a different thought
[24:44] tonight I won't be really preaching
[24:45] necessarily on the baptism of the Holy
[24:48] Ghost I kind of feel like I want to go a
[24:50] different direction then maybe get back
[24:51] to that on Wednesday and
[24:53] Sunday
[24:55] Numbers Chapter 20 please
[25:18] I want to um give this an interesting
[25:21] title
[25:22] tonight
[25:24] um thinking about different thoughts and
[25:28] titles from Numbers Chapter
[25:34] 20 like to call this a little message
[25:37] the name calling complex I like to call
[25:39] it
[25:41] that name calling
[25:44] complex like to maybe if I could a
[25:47] subtopic of Ricky and Retta I like to
[25:51] kind of look at that not the Lord has
[25:54] kind of been dealing with me on some
[25:55] certain things I want to
[25:58] look at this here
[26:04] tonight so if you got your Bibles there
[26:06] Numbers Chapter
[26:09] 20 sorry not there
[26:13] yet know recently we looking at the
[26:15] power of the tongue and the power of the
[26:16] words and and we looked at brother BR
[26:18] how he had a battle of the critical
[26:20] spirit and this might tie with it like I
[26:22] said I don't have you know maybe like a
[26:23] full Revelation but I just want to read
[26:25] what brother R says when he talks about
[26:28] mettus
[26:31] um but if you remember in Numbers
[26:33] Chapter 20 um Moses the the people of
[26:36] Israel want water right so God tells
[26:38] them go speak to the Rock and here's
[26:41] what happens
[26:43] here verse 10 numbers 20 verse
[26:47] 10 and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[26:49] congregation together before the Rock
[26:52] and he said unto them here now ye Rebels
[26:56] must we fetch you water out of this
[26:59] rock and Moses lifted up his hand and
[27:01] with his Rod he smokee The Rock
[27:05] twice and the water came out abundantly
[27:08] and the congregation drank and the
[27:10] beasts
[27:12] also verse 12 and the Lord spake unto
[27:15] Moses and Aaron because you believe me
[27:18] not to sanctify me in the eyes of the
[27:20] children of Israel therefore you shall
[27:22] not bring this congregation into the
[27:24] land which I have given them this is the
[27:28] water of
[27:29] meah which means Strife because the
[27:32] children of Israel strove with the Lord
[27:35] and he was Sanctified in them praise God
[27:38] so look at this let's bow our heads one
[27:39] more word of prayer Father in Heaven
[27:41] Lord we read your word I pray God just
[27:43] help this to be a blessing to the people
[27:45] Lord here tonight I pray Lord that we
[27:47] can understand it Lord with this complex
[27:49] here that your Prophet talks about and
[27:52] be able to help us all Lord we love you
[27:54] so much in Jesus Christ's name the
[27:55] church said amen amen God bless you
[27:57] being see you
[28:02] here so I want to take this thought
[28:05] tonight looking at the name calling
[28:08] complex we might
[28:09] say and
[28:12] uh trust it be a blessing to
[28:15] you how many remember the message
[28:17] standing in the Gap that brother Brandon
[28:19] preached from 1963 okay some of us
[28:21] remember that um brother brand takes his
[28:24] text uh from number 16 Okay so uh he
[28:27] takes his text and he's talking about
[28:29] how Moses had to stand the gap for Dayan
[28:33] and Kora if you remember numers 16 they
[28:35] said oh you say you're the only holy
[28:37] ones Moses and Aaron we're all holy we
[28:39] can all preach you we can we can all go
[28:41] into the holy place and so we like that
[28:44] and uh Moses the Bible said goes up
[28:47] after he hears this oh and they were
[28:49] they were accusing Moses oh you're the
[28:50] one who's you've called yourself to be a
[28:52] prophet and you you think you're so holy
[28:54] and you you you've put all this together
[28:57] and and Moses was so humble he threw
[28:59] himself in the Gap and the Bible said he
[29:01] fell on his face and cried out for the
[29:03] people but they kept going on they
[29:05] didn't repent of it okay so we know the
[29:07] story they brought they everybody
[29:09] brought a rod in right and the Lord said
[29:10] I'm gonna show who's who I'm gonna I'm
[29:13] I'm gonna bring a resurrection of a dead
[29:15] stick and whoever's Dead stick
[29:17] resurrects that's who's my real priest
[29:19] that's who's my real high priest right
[29:21] whichever Branch brings forth a revel or
[29:23] a resurrection or Revelation that's
[29:26] that's that's my branch
[29:27] okay and it was only Aaron's Rod that
[29:29] budded right and so after that God
[29:32] swallowed up you know Dayan and cor you
[29:34] know swallow up at the Earth and so
[29:35] forth so in that case Moses had the
[29:39] right kind of attitude okay uh for the
[29:42] people he saw the people in an awful
[29:44] condition so what did he do he stood in
[29:45] the gap for them he asked God to
[29:47] intercede for them and help them but in
[29:49] this case it wasn't a time where they
[29:50] could actually repent these people
[29:52] weren't going to repent but he still
[29:54] threw himself in the gap for the people
[29:57] praise God now I want to bring this out
[29:59] too
[30:00] because you know Wednesday night I said
[30:02] that you know I feel like I've just I
[30:05] get if I'm not careful I take it
[30:07] personal when people don't come to
[30:08] church or don't let me know you know why
[30:10] they're not at church or something like
[30:12] that and I take it personally because
[30:14] you know so much of my effort and my
[30:17] time is into the ministry right um and
[30:20] I've learned that that's wrong and so
[30:22] you can you could you know if you wanted
[30:23] to with my wife we could sit down and
[30:25] talk about how um I if I'm not careful I
[30:28] develop a complex about
[30:31] that and it makes me discouraged that's
[30:33] what I mean so a complex will never lead
[30:35] to good fruit it always leads to the
[30:36] wrong thing right a complex is something
[30:39] you build up brother brand says and he
[30:41] asked the church he said how many have a
[30:42] complex he said oh look almost every
[30:43] hands up he said don't ever get a
[30:46] complex and there the whole church is
[30:47] sitting with
[30:48] complexes so it shows we got to do
[30:51] better right right the God's people need
[30:52] to do a better job I think we we need to
[30:54] do a better job and a complex is like
[30:57] this
[30:57] uh it's this uh feeling you build up
[31:00] towards someone or something and it's
[31:03] something you build up uh and whenever
[31:06] that person is brought up or whenever
[31:07] that issue is brought up you have a bad
[31:09] feeling toward it okay uh for example
[31:13] like someone might have a complex with
[31:15] their father or complex about their
[31:17] sister or complex about their family so
[31:19] every time somebody brings up this
[31:20] family member that they have a complex
[31:21] with oh they get all upset you know uh
[31:25] and a comp it's interesting that brother
[31:27] calls it a complex because a complex
[31:29] we'd say like this a stadium complex or
[31:31] a building is a complex and that's
[31:34] scriptural because in second Corinthians
[31:36] I believe it's 10 uh the Bible said we
[31:38] must pull down all the strongholds and
[31:40] the strongholds mean like a castle so
[31:42] the Bible so the Bible literally says
[31:44] that in our minds if we're not careful
[31:46] we let Satan build up a a complex in our
[31:49] minds and we build it up and brother
[31:50] brand said from there you start if Satan
[31:53] has grounds in your mind he uses Satan
[31:56] uses you to attack attack another child
[31:57] of God he said then Satan don't have to
[31:59] fight him because he's already got you
[32:00] fighting him that's awful Place amen we
[32:04] don't want to be there by God's grace
[32:06] don't attack the people of God but I
[32:08] showed you if you Wednesdays ago that
[32:10] brother bradam battled a critical spirit
[32:12] so I just want to briefly read over that
[32:13] real quick um so you'll have that and uh
[32:17] see it there I want you to see uh just
[32:21] kind of exactly the words that he said
[32:22] because as I said this morning he goes
[32:24] and then he he preaches right during
[32:27] right right as he says
[32:28] it okay and it was on a Wednesday night
[32:31] so I'm not sure we even got to hear it
[32:32] by God's grace brother BR said I want to
[32:35] ask the church one more thing before we
[32:36] get some place to studying the
[32:38] scriptures that is that you'll pray for
[32:39] me I developed a critical spirit and it
[32:43] haunts
[32:44] me we're coming up on Halloween time
[32:47] right they talk about haunting right and
[32:49] I heard brother Craigs Bo preach a Ser
[32:51] one time called the haunted house he
[32:53] basically say how you're we're a temple
[32:54] we're a house and and Spirits haunt us
[32:57] right you know if we're not if if we
[32:59] Harbor and don't confess things they
[33:01] haunt us because we haven't confessed
[33:04] something we haven't overcome something
[33:06] so brother man said I've developed a
[33:08] critical spirit and it haunts me and
[33:10] remember he gave the two the two
[33:12] examples okay the one was a woman over
[33:15] in India remember she was claimed to
[33:17] have Divine Healing and she was pulling
[33:20] money uh pulling money from the these
[33:23] poor Indian people and then saying well
[33:25] God will heal you if you give more money
[33:26] and there are dir poor andever she's
[33:28] begging money brother Bram said he
[33:30] started attacking her just criticizing
[33:32] everything that she was doing he said
[33:34] then he got home uh from India because I
[33:38] guess they were there at the same time
[33:39] and he picks up a voice of healing
[33:41] magazine and he starts criticizing
[33:43] everybody in that
[33:45] magazine so the what we saw is that a
[33:48] critical spirit condemns everybody
[33:51] judges everybody except
[33:53] yourself we saw that in the scripture
[33:56] okay so let's read Proverbs
[33:59] 17:20 because this is something that
[34:01] would haunt him he said pray that I'll
[34:02] be get delivered from it so was
[34:04] something it must have been a complex
[34:06] that's why I said I feel like I'm just
[34:07] trying to put these pieces of the puzzle
[34:09] together so you can see it he hadn't
[34:12] been delivered of it he has for prayer
[34:13] from Deliverance of it and it haunts him
[34:15] so maybe it keeps coming back I don't
[34:17] know a little bit tricky to understand
[34:19] there but I think you understand what
[34:20] I'm saying he that at a frower heart
[34:23] findeth no good so there's right there's
[34:25] a critical spirit if you have a a frower
[34:29] which means a crooked
[34:31] heart you findeth no good about things
[34:35] okay and he that have the perverse
[34:36] tongue fth into Mischief all
[34:39] right now remember the Bible said that
[34:42] the Pharisees remember they tried to uh
[34:45] find they try to catch Jesus wrong in
[34:47] what he was saying remember that I know
[34:48] the scripture in front of me but it's
[34:50] kind of comes to my remembrance they
[34:52] their whole idea was to catch him in his
[34:54] sayings and try to find something wrong
[34:56] with him so my dad always told me he
[34:58] said they're always trying to uh
[35:00] religious people always try to find
[35:01] fault with real Christians right because
[35:03] who's the accuser of the brother Satan
[35:05] is Right Satan's accuses of the brother
[35:08] so uh brother B says that and
[35:12] then he goes on to say a little bit
[35:15] further he says but look he said at
[35:19] those poor people lovely people out
[35:21] there following going along with the
[35:23] voice of healing and honest hearted
[35:25] people I look around and see other
[35:27] things that goes on and I start
[35:28] criticizing in my heart I don't want to
[35:31] get that way if I do I lose favor with
[35:34] God so is this a serious thing yes you
[35:37] lose the favor of God upon your life you
[35:39] feel like the heavens are closed to your
[35:41] prayers
[35:44] okay here's what he had to learn he said
[35:47] but I hear this I say who battle is it
[35:50] so when you have a critical spirit you
[35:52] feel like you're the one who has to
[35:54] fight against these people instead of of
[35:57] letting God God fight for you right The
[36:00] Battle Belongs to who I love that song
[36:02] Battle Belongs to the Lord but see
[36:04] brother Bram said I felt like I had to
[36:06] do the battle I like I had to battle AA
[36:08] Allen in the voice of healing or I had
[36:10] to battle This Woman's Ministry and he
[36:13] had to realize whose battle is it he
[36:15] said then God said let the weeds and the
[36:18] wheat grow together the Angels would
[36:20] come and separated at the end
[36:22] times remember Jesus said uproot not the
[36:25] Terrors uh because you get some
[36:27] wheat everybody see that so that's why
[36:30] we don't want to critical spirit we
[36:31] don't want to criticize everybody
[36:33] criticize that church criticize because
[36:35] and what we're just criticizing we're
[36:37] really not doing any good right we're
[36:39] not really doing any good we're just
[36:41] cutting cutting cutting cutting but what
[36:43] about applying some balm like if you're
[36:45] gonna cut somebody you better have some
[36:47] balm to bring some healing right like
[36:50] doctors like Brother Scott would know
[36:52] he's been around doctors you're going to
[36:54] cut somebody you better Stitch it up
[36:55] right you better better apply some uh
[36:58] ointment or whatever more to help it
[37:00] heal and that's and that's what we said
[37:03] as the critical spirit it just cutting
[37:05] people without really trying to help
[37:06] them you just feel like you're the judge
[37:09] or in this case find there's nothing
[37:11] good about them but Jesus said let the
[37:13] blind lead the blind right they both
[37:16] fall in the ditch he said uh and don't
[37:19] try to uproot the
[37:20] tears so don't try to decide who's
[37:23] serpent seed and who's not there's life
[37:26] will show us they are right and as long
[37:28] as they're breathing if God hasn't show
[37:30] me their servant seat I'm going to keep
[37:31] praying even if they have left the
[37:32] message three or four times what's keep
[37:34] praying asking God to do a miracle so
[37:37] they can have a testimony on that day
[37:38] praise God and get saved right at the
[37:41] end he said but instead of criticizing
[37:44] it I need to I will love them anyhow and
[37:46] go
[37:47] on he said just been a constant grind
[37:51] and I'm just human my mental powers are
[37:53] breaking like that and I've got to get
[37:54] away for some rest
[37:57] praise God so now we get more of the
[37:58] picture because he's tired he needs a
[38:01] vacation he needs some time away with
[38:03] the Lord he's under a lot of pressure a
[38:06] lot of traveling he starts criticizing
[38:08] mothers ever get under pre the mothers
[38:10] or fathers ever get under pressure and
[38:12] criticize their children too
[38:14] much
[38:15] right and it can happen to preachers
[38:18] could happen to me it could happen to
[38:20] pastors it happened to brother Brandon
[38:22] happened to brother
[38:25] Brandon he said uh I want to come I want
[38:28] I want it to come from my heart that I
[38:30] really have love for those who are not
[38:32] lovely that Jesus did he said when I was
[38:36] critical when I needed to be criticized
[38:39] still he loves me anyhow
[38:41] amen but said now I'll pray you'll help
[38:44] me take the critical spirit from thy
[38:46] servant Lord so he preaches this full
[38:48] sermon and at the end he said Lord take
[38:51] this critical spirit from your servant
[38:53] if the men are wrong you be the judge
[38:55] let me just love love them anyhow will
[38:57] you father he says how many like that by
[39:00] God's grace I like that so now with that
[39:05] I want to read a few things
[39:08] here and I have my text there with Moses
[39:10] so you understand here I think this will
[39:12] tie in pretty well by God's
[39:19] grace how many ever heard brother brand
[39:21] say Ricky and Retta any never heard
[39:24] that he says it quite a few times I want
[39:28] you to hear when he talks about it on
[39:29] standing in the Gap has anyone heard
[39:31] that
[39:31] lately okay so maybe hope to refresh to
[39:34] you so brother R preaches standing on
[39:36] the Gap and he admits his complex you
[39:38] remember his complex his complex was
[39:41] well I preached the message I go back to
[39:43] the same place a year later and they're
[39:44] worse off than they were and he said if
[39:46] these people won't receive my message
[39:48] then they don't have to hear it anyway
[39:50] he was tempted to go live up in the
[39:52] wilderness remember and just come down
[39:54] when he had thus say the Lord but the
[39:55] holy spirit said you're not a Old
[39:57] Testament prophet he said you're a new
[39:58] testament Prophet with Apostolic gifts
[40:02] that's the Old Testament Prophet the New
[40:04] Testament Prophet stays with the people
[40:06] praise God he's got they got gifts and
[40:09] that's what Apostle does that's what a
[40:10] prophet does they stay there in they're
[40:12] part of the fivefold ministry praise
[40:15] God and then remember God showed him a
[40:17] dream he's driving Billy Paul sleeping
[40:18] he's driving God shows him a dream if he
[40:21] doesn't straighten it out he's going to
[40:22] be like that old man he met in the
[40:23] restaurant there and he repents and then
[40:25] God shows him Seven Mountains and the
[40:27] Seven Peaks and the mountains and so
[40:29] forth he sees that he's got seven
[40:30] letters in his name he feels that's
[40:32] that's God giving him confirmation that
[40:35] he must have a different heart towards
[40:37] people that won't receive his preaching
[40:39] amen and here's what he says in
[40:41] paragraph 159 said in the Gap and these
[40:43] Ricky and retas that have so sassed the
[40:48] words and I've called them Ricky and
[40:50] Retta God give me to understand I
[40:53] shouldn't do
[40:55] that
[40:57] because that's many of them are still
[40:59] his
[41:01] children oh my now Church did you CCH
[41:05] this he's name calling all these people
[41:09] in
[41:09] denominations now what do we call that
[41:11] today when you put everybody in one
[41:13] group and call them names that's
[41:15] stereotyping right some people
[41:16] stereotype white people some people
[41:18] stereotype police officers some people
[41:20] stereotype black people or Spanish
[41:22] people or Mexican people or whatever
[41:24] people stereotype they love all them
[41:27] together is God pleased with that
[41:28] brother said God didn't wasn't pleased
[41:30] with that God's not pleased with that
[41:33] because he's got children in
[41:34] there and they're not all Ricky and
[41:37] they're not all rickettes so here he is
[41:39] name calling some of God's people
[41:42] stereotyping putting them all
[41:45] together now look now look what brother
[41:47] man says God would have me to understand
[41:49] I shouldn't do that so God let him know
[41:51] he shouldn't do
[41:53] that they can't help because they act so
[41:56] much different some of these old cold
[41:58] foral churches has got them that Spirit
[42:00] upon them and they're in his in prison
[42:03] as Israel was in prison just as much as
[42:06] Moses went down to deliver them from
[42:07] slavery human beings that love Jesus
[42:10] Christ and would serve him if they only
[42:13] know what to serve him by amen and
[42:16] they're in bondage under
[42:17] denominationalism that tells them you
[42:19] don't do this and you don't do that
[42:21] praise God isn't that wonderful can
[42:24] everybody see that by God's grace
[42:26] you see how we in the message have to be
[42:28] careful not to be critical and not to
[42:30] name
[42:31] call Brother B I'm going to share
[42:33] something too last week we were sitting
[42:35] at a table remember and somebody called
[42:38] uh somebody called all the Seminary
[42:40] preachers idiots remember that do you
[42:42] remember that I okay and it just grieved
[42:46] I didn't say nothing it just grieved me
[42:47] I thought oh I was wondering why you
[42:50] know basically somebody's making it
[42:52] sound like all men that go to Seminary
[42:55] are idiot
[42:56] OT and that that grieved me church
[42:59] because there it wasn't for God's grace
[43:02] I would have been one in there and then
[43:03] God would had to call me out of there
[43:05] but uh they're not they're not all like
[43:08] that God has foolish virgin in there and
[43:11] God apparently must have bride still
[43:13] there because we're still here and
[43:15] Revelation 18 it says come out of her my
[43:17] people come out of Babylon come out of
[43:19] denominations of my people so we
[43:22] shouldn't so Godless brother no you
[43:23] shouldn't call my people shouldn't call
[43:25] my people
[43:28] but what does he talking about that
[43:29] sermon I developed the complex I preach
[43:32] it they won't live it I preach it they
[43:33] won't live fine they don't have to hear
[43:35] I'll go up in the
[43:37] wilderness and God has to say no you
[43:39] won't do
[43:42] that so see what a complex can bring it
[43:44] brings about name
[43:47] calling and I constantly got to watch my
[43:50] children as all parents know my children
[43:52] have to be careful not to name
[43:55] call
[43:56] that's not a that's not a pleasing thing
[43:58] to God it's not pleasing to say all
[44:01] pastors are like this or all preachers
[44:02] are like this all women are like this
[44:04] all men are like that that's not
[44:06] pleasing to the Lord because he might
[44:08] have some servants in that group and we
[44:12] don't want to call them
[44:15] names now he says but the call of God
[44:19] must come to them whosoever wants to
[44:21] March toward the promised land let him
[44:23] March amen so all these people that are
[44:25] in denominations have to hear a call
[44:28] whoever wants to March for Jesus come
[44:30] march with Christ amen we're on our road
[44:34] to the promised land amen let them come
[44:36] March we're on a road to meet Christ at
[44:38] the end time and I wanted to bring this
[44:40] to you so you would see and show that
[44:42] the mistake that a man can make yet
[44:44] being sincere amen so what is brother ra
[44:47] he's showing he's just he's bearing his
[44:49] soul to us isn't he he's showing us his
[44:51] his very this is how he is this is this
[44:55] these are the these are the battles he
[44:56] had he battled a critical
[44:59] spirit he battled name
[45:02] calling God let me know I shouldn't call
[45:04] him
[45:06] that so he shows this is how I was
[45:09] sincere yet I made a mistake he's
[45:11] sincere because what he go goes to
[45:13] preach then goes to preach goes to
[45:14] preach goes to preach brings the message
[45:16] even though they don't want to hear it
[45:17] brings him the message but then if he's
[45:19] not careful he said he loses the feeling
[45:22] of the people how many remember that he
[45:25] lost the feeling of the
[45:26] people in other words he stopped having
[45:29] compassion upon the people remember
[45:30] Jesus looked out on the multitude and
[45:32] what the Bible say he looked at them
[45:33] with compassion because they were sheep
[45:35] without a Shepherd is that
[45:41] right so and then since van and I sat
[45:44] there and witnessed that and you know
[45:46] then different things this week I like I
[45:47] really need to preach this I feel like I
[45:49] really need to preach
[45:51] this
[45:54] um because we we can't group all those
[45:57] people together some of them might be
[45:59] children of God if somebody would have
[46:01] blasted the all those Assemblies of God
[46:03] they're just a bunch of heathen worldly
[46:06] people and yet here I was sitting right
[46:07] in the
[46:08] church and I don't want to I don't want
[46:10] to be Heathen I want of God's children
[46:13] praise the Lord I I don't want to be
[46:14] called
[46:15] that and God has let brother R know I
[46:18] still got children in there don't call
[46:21] them Ricky and
[46:24] ricettas name call
[46:28] remember in the power of your words is
[46:30] what life and death life and death do
[46:32] you say well I don't like this or unlike
[46:34] that or this always do this or people
[46:37] like this always do this always do that
[46:39] you're creating the wrong
[46:40] atmosphere that's a negative atmosphere
[46:43] that's not a a positive atmosphere where
[46:45] where there's Faith there there's no
[46:46] faith there that's just complaining
[46:49] that's criticizing right now he goes on
[46:52] a few more paragraphs he says and all
[46:54] these years I've tried to serve him with
[46:55] with a pure heart and I won't go out
[46:58] there being a hypocrite so he says right
[47:00] now he's feels like he would be a
[47:02] hypocrite if he went and tried to preach
[47:03] and evangelized outside of random
[47:05] Tabernacle this is in June of
[47:07] 1963 so you you must have got victory
[47:10] over this right at some
[47:12] point because he says I can't go back
[47:14] out there unless I get the feeling for
[47:16] the people
[47:18] back I got to feel that that it isn't
[47:22] Ricky and Retta and it isn't this Bunch
[47:25] it's God children that's in bondage and
[47:27] I must go to them until I can feel that
[47:30] way I'll just have to loaf around preach
[47:32] some conventions and things but
[47:36] wait praise God how many heard that is
[47:39] that new to anybody Ricky and Ricket
[47:42] us God let his Prophet understand we
[47:46] shouldn't name call and we shouldn't
[47:48] group everybody together in like
[47:51] stereotypes and so forth so now let's go
[47:53] back to the scripture and let's look at
[47:55] it's something with prophets and name
[47:56] calling must be the Zeal of God it must
[47:59] be the the the office that they hold
[48:01] right but look at look back in numbers
[48:07] 20 verse 11 and Moses and er gathered
[48:10] the congregation before the rock okay
[48:13] now I'm I'm sorry let's go back to verse
[48:16] eight because this is what the Lord
[48:17] tells Moses in 20 verse 8 take the rod
[48:20] and gather thou the assembly together
[48:22] thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye
[48:25] unto the rock before their eyes and it
[48:28] shall give forth his
[48:32] water what was the direction was a
[48:34] direction to speak or
[48:35] Smite speak speak to the Rock and thou
[48:39] shalt bring forth to them water out of
[48:42] the rock so Thou shalt give the
[48:44] congregation and their Beast drink God
[48:46] gave very specific directions you're a
[48:49] prophet of God Moses Aaron you're the
[48:50] priest you speak to the Rock and it'll
[48:53] bring forth water
[48:56] is that
[48:57] right now look let's finish verse 10 and
[49:01] Moses and Aaron gathered the the
[49:03] congregation before them I'm sorry
[49:05] together before the Rock and he said
[49:06] unto them here now ye Rebels must we
[49:09] fetch you water out of this
[49:12] rock what's he do church he calls them
[49:14] names he calls you bunch of
[49:17] rebels brother R would call you bunch of
[49:19] Rick and
[49:20] retas right you bunch of rebels do we
[49:25] have to bring water out of this
[49:27] rock and notice he puts himself into it
[49:30] like he has something to do with
[49:33] it this is a very serious sin if you
[49:35] know the Bible this is a this is a very
[49:38] serious sin Moses commits
[49:41] here look at the next few verses and
[49:45] Moses lifted up his hand and with his
[49:46] Rod he smot The Rock
[49:50] twice now what is that type that types
[49:52] how Christ had to be smitten because
[49:54] brother man preaches is that in the
[49:55] indictment right Christ is the rock well
[49:58] he was smitten once but here the
[50:00] scripture says he had to be smitten
[50:01] twice he was crucified once 2,000 years
[50:04] ago but the Bible said he's crucified
[50:06] again in Hebrews 6 he's crucified today
[50:10] by trotting under the the the try trting
[50:12] underf foot the Son of God aresh just
[50:14] saying oh I won't live I won't let this
[50:16] Blood cleanse me I don't have to live a
[50:18] holy life when you Tred under the word
[50:20] of God and the Holy Ghost for your day
[50:22] it's crucifying the effects of the Holy
[50:24] Ghost to you
[50:27] amen so if you haven't listen to
[50:29] indictment I listen to indictment you
[50:31] brothers would want to do that if you
[50:32] haven't done that that's where this type
[50:35] is fulfilled Christ was smitten twice he
[50:37] was crucified in 2,000 years ago and and
[50:41] then the effects of the word the message
[50:43] has been crucified today to the effects
[50:45] of the people you understand what I'm
[50:46] saying the message lives on but the the
[50:48] message can't get to the people because
[50:50] the preachers have hindered the move of
[50:52] it amen it's been crucified it's been
[50:54] Trot Under Foot but like Austin's mom
[50:56] was telling me yesterday how come I
[50:57] never heard of brother how come I never
[50:59] heard of the mess churches I can say the
[51:00] same thing how come I never heard of it
[51:02] because it's been
[51:04] crucified it's been bad Mound and now
[51:07] they people don't even talk about they
[51:08] don't even now most preachers don't even
[51:10] know about but the old timers
[51:12] do because God was with them God
[51:14] Vindicated his
[51:16] ministry brother Kevin sends me he's
[51:18] we've talked numerous times he sent me a
[51:19] text this week that he met another man
[51:21] who knew brother Brandon's Ministry and
[51:22] was raised in a mess his church and all
[51:24] these things there's of course there's
[51:26] pockets of people out there that know
[51:27] about it but as time goes on fewer and
[51:29] few fewer and fewer people know about it
[51:32] so thank God we got the tapes and we got
[51:33] the videos to show that this was a true
[51:35] man of God he tells your name and your
[51:36] address and the streets you're on and
[51:38] all these things like that that's Jesus
[51:39] Christ the same yesterday today and
[51:41] forever
[51:43] amen now look at verse 12 this is so
[51:46] serious the fact you get up there and
[51:47] call them you bunch of rebels look you
[51:49] had the wrong feeling towards his church
[51:50] didn't he God never said call them name
[51:53] call them and God never said smile it
[51:56] she must have been really angry right
[51:58] smoke the rock twice now brother brandom
[52:00] said God honored Moses's gift and let
[52:03] water come out but because he was A
[52:05] Gifted
[52:07] Man because God never said Smite it he
[52:10] said speak to it but Moses must have
[52:11] knew he had a gift of God with the rod
[52:13] right because he held the rod and to
[52:15] split the Red
[52:17] Seas God so honored it and water still
[52:20] came out even though he Smit it because
[52:22] he was A Gifted Man and brother Bram
[52:24] gives the example of Eli call down she
[52:26] bearss against children God honored the
[52:28] prophet's word but that wasn't the right
[52:30] thing to do he honored his office yet he
[52:34] did the wrong thing so see a prophet can
[52:36] step out of the per the perfect will of
[52:38] God and get into the permissive will of
[52:39] God too just like you and I does that
[52:42] make sense but said that's not of God
[52:45] for she Bears to Maul children just for
[52:47] saying oh Baldhead oh Baldhead oh
[52:49] Baldhead that's what they were
[52:52] doing brother man says because their
[52:54] parents weren't teaching them the right
[52:55] way in their homes their bad mouthing El
[52:57] Elisha their bad mouthing Elisha in
[52:59] their
[53:00] homes and because of that Elisha got
[53:02] upset and God had to honor his gift just
[53:05] like here God has to honor Moses's gift
[53:07] water comes but that wasn't the way God
[53:10] said all
[53:14] right now look at verse 12 and the Lord
[53:17] spake unto Moses and Aaron because you
[53:19] believe me not let's stop right there
[53:21] what didn't they believe they believe in
[53:23] God they still believe in
[53:26] Jehovah but God says perfect obedience
[53:29] is really believing me praise the Lord
[53:33] perfect obedience is actually believing
[53:35] me they believed in God but God said you
[53:37] didn't believe me other words you didn't
[53:39] do what I told you to do you didn't keep
[53:42] the directions to a te you didn't dot
[53:45] the eye and cross the te right you
[53:46] didn't do it
[53:48] Faithfully because you believe me not to
[53:50] sanctify me in the eyes of the children
[53:52] of Israel therefore you shall not bring
[53:54] this congregation in the land which I've
[53:57] given unto
[53:59] them now they didn't sanctify God which
[54:03] means they didn't set apart God and
[54:05] really they didn't make the miracle look
[54:06] like it was from God who do you make it
[54:08] look like it was from him and Aaron and
[54:11] brother BR picks this up and said Moses
[54:14] glorified himself with this instead of
[54:18] glorifying God and just speaking to the
[54:19] Rock he has to have something to do with
[54:21] you bunch of rebels Bam
[54:24] Bam and brother B said that's a man
[54:27] glorifying himself look what I can do I
[54:29] can bring this I have this gift in my
[54:31] life oh
[54:33] my so because he glorifies himself
[54:37] what's he kept out of the promis land
[54:40] what is that type today we preached on
[54:42] that recently the baptism of the Holy
[54:44] Ghost that's an interesting thought
[54:47] anyone with the gift of God that they
[54:49] glorify themselves with the gift of God
[54:52] can't be born again I say like that that
[54:56] now doesn't that open up Matthew 7 where
[54:58] they say Lord Lord have we not
[54:59] prophesied and Jesus said I never knew
[55:01] you they Jesus didn't say they didn't
[55:03] have
[55:04] gifts but I wonder who got the glory
[55:07] when they spoke in tongues or prophesied
[55:09] who got the glory did Christ or did the
[55:11] church or the individual that's pretty
[55:14] good praise
[55:16] God because they glorified because Moses
[55:19] and Aaron glorified themselves name
[55:21] called the
[55:22] people God says you can't go into the
[55:25] Promised
[55:26] Land that's quite that's quite a that's
[55:28] quite a judgment that God gives you
[55:30] didn't sanctify me you didn't make me
[55:32] look like the one that was holy set me
[55:34] apart and show and let me show The Glory
[55:37] you you Sanctified
[55:39] yourself you made yourself you set
[55:41] yourself apart you made it look like it
[55:43] was
[55:44] you because remember what did he say
[55:47] must we fetch you water this Ro we no
[55:50] man can bring water out of a rock right
[55:52] it wasn't we it was God it was he not we
[55:55] amen it was he but they he glorified
[55:59] himself well because I'm called of God
[56:01] I've got the gift of God I could do
[56:02] whatever I want bunch of
[56:05] rebels and here brother brandom 3,000
[56:08] years later said I'm name calling God's
[56:11] people there some of them that are God's
[56:13] people I shouldn't do that can you see
[56:15] the similarities there both prophets
[56:19] both spoke with thus sayi the Lord both
[56:21] had Supernatural signs wonders and
[56:22] miracles and both named called some
[56:26] people of
[56:31] God now go to uh Psalms 106 the people
[56:35] were not innocent
[56:37] either I mean it's true Moses you know
[56:41] did the wrong thing but look look what
[56:43] the Bible says about this Psalms
[56:45] 106 I love how I love how you know God
[56:49] gives more Revelation and more insight
[56:51] on scripture all throughout the Bible so
[56:52] you can't just read one chapter and
[56:53] think you got it all figured out out you
[56:55] know you got to keep
[56:59] reading Psalms
[57:03] 10632 the church like I said I'm
[57:04] bringing this out because like I said
[57:06] I've had complexes I've I've taken
[57:09] things
[57:10] personally and it meant a lot to me and
[57:12] then brother bang and I sit there and
[57:13] hear things like that I think oh we
[57:15] don't want
[57:17] that because that will start Glory well
[57:19] look at us we don't go to Seminary it
[57:21] didn't come to that but I don't want it
[57:23] to come to that brother van you
[57:24] understand what I'm saying we sit there
[57:25] and hear that we don't ever want to
[57:27] exalt ourselves we don't want to glorify
[57:29] us because who are we who are we we're
[57:32] just humans we're just we're just people
[57:35] that need God every hour praise God
[57:38] we're not the judges we're supposed to
[57:40] judge ourselves that the word judge us
[57:42] but we're not to get a critical spirit
[57:44] and condemn everybody else except
[57:45] ourselves and we're not to name call
[57:51] either all right Psalms 10632 they they
[57:54] angered him also at the Waters of strife
[57:57] remember maraba means
[57:58] Strife so that it went ill with Moses
[58:01] for their
[58:04] sakes because they provoked his
[58:07] spirit so that he spake
[58:10] unadvisedly with his lips a't that
[58:12] something right there my goodness that's
[58:17] powerful
[58:19] Moses I mean he had every right to say
[58:22] the people are wrong they're the ones
[58:23] stirring me up and it's their fault
[58:26] could brother say the same it's their
[58:28] fault they keep cutting their hair those
[58:30] men keep dabbing into sin and all these
[58:32] kind things like it's their fault I'm
[58:34] the I'm the one trying to serve God up
[58:37] here but because of their complaining it
[58:40] caused him to do something and say
[58:43] something unadvisedly too you rebels you
[58:46] name call he named Cs and said we are
[58:49] going to bring do we have to bring water
[58:50] from the rock it wasn't Moses and Aaron
[58:53] it was God going to bring water
[58:57] so yes the people would provoke him but
[58:59] this shows us the same thing too just
[59:01] because uh somebody makes you mad you
[59:03] can't say well you made me mad so I can
[59:05] be mad from now on that's Moses are you
[59:09] with me I've heard so many people say
[59:11] that I had a teacher one time walked
[59:12] into my class a
[59:14] professor no it was a okay I was a
[59:16] teacher not a professor it was a teacher
[59:17] of a class I was in one time I think
[59:20] probably
[59:21] remembers and uh this teacher was was
[59:24] all upset during class and he looked
[59:27] over at his son and said you're the
[59:28] reason I'm upset and everybody starts
[59:30] laughing but really I thought of this I
[59:32] thought no one has the power over you to
[59:35] make you mad because we can cast down
[59:38] all Spirits praise
[59:41] God no one can force you to do that look
[59:43] at this Moses let himself get weak right
[59:48] and because he let that get to him he
[59:50] started name calling but what he should
[59:52] have done he should have went and stood
[59:53] in the gap for them right right just
[59:55] like he did earlier right he did he did
[59:57] that numerous times for Israel standing
[59:59] in the Gap so instead of complaining
[1:00:02] about people what do we got to do pray
[1:00:04] for them gotta pray for
[1:00:07] them is this good is this good tonight
[1:00:09] by God's
[1:00:10] grace seeing how brother brandom had you
[1:00:13] know a critical spirit CR criticizing
[1:00:16] everybody but feeling like he had to
[1:00:18] battle everybody and now he starts name
[1:00:21] well he named call for
[1:00:23] years
[1:00:25] and God let them know he shouldn't do
[1:00:26] that he shouldn't do that and now he see
[1:00:29] in the scripture Moses bow the same
[1:00:33] thing and he was kept uh Moses was kept
[1:00:36] out of the promised
[1:00:39] land now I want to just bring this down
[1:00:41] to the close
[1:00:46] here and I want to say this I found the
[1:00:49] word Retta six times after standing in
[1:00:52] the gap
[1:00:55] and there's a reason I'm saying that God
[1:00:57] had showed him he shouldn't say
[1:01:00] that but yet he would he kept he kept
[1:01:02] saying a few more times there's a lot of
[1:01:04] sermons you know after June of 63
[1:01:06] there's quite a few sermons
[1:01:08] actually maybe 80 or 100 or something
[1:01:10] along those lines um but I'm just
[1:01:13] letting you
[1:01:14] know he shouldn't he he God showed him
[1:01:17] he shouldn't do it but every now and
[1:01:19] then he'd slip up and do
[1:01:20] it praise God so what does that show you
[1:01:25] what does it show
[1:01:26] me well it tells us we're all human
[1:01:30] right and battles we have God shows us
[1:01:33] they're wrong sometimes they might come
[1:01:36] back and haunt us can I say like
[1:01:38] that does the bible say that though the
[1:01:40] Bible says you know with demon Spirits
[1:01:42] once they're once they get off you what
[1:01:43] they do they try to come
[1:01:45] back and I'm not saying you know I'm not
[1:01:47] sure how many I'm not sure how many
[1:01:49] demons or whatever would come back on us
[1:01:51] or whatever more I'm just saying when we
[1:01:53] get over something Satan likes to try to
[1:01:55] bring it
[1:01:57] back he even called his own daughter
[1:01:59] Rebecca a rietta he said she's at that
[1:02:02] ricketta age the Tian
[1:02:04] age and God and she was a daughter of
[1:02:06] God right love the Lord serve the Lord
[1:02:09] mother George Smith
[1:02:13] there and he calls his own daughter
[1:02:17] Rett so you
[1:02:19] see it gives us an
[1:02:22] understanding that once we get victory
[1:02:24] over something we have to keep the
[1:02:25] victory over
[1:02:27] it and we must watch the words of our
[1:02:30] mouth praise God they're so important uh
[1:02:34] to watch it at all times now let's turn
[1:02:36] to one more scripture here I want to
[1:02:39] uh look at another scripture by God's
[1:02:42] grace Matthew 5 let's go back to Matthew
[1:02:53] 5
[1:02:56] going back to
[1:02:57] our our tongues and the conditions of
[1:03:00] our heart
[1:03:09] here hey Matthew 5 verse
[1:03:18] 21 was it a serious thing that Moses
[1:03:21] name called yes kept him out of the very
[1:03:24] it kept them out of finishing his
[1:03:26] commission did not his commission was to
[1:03:28] take them out in order to bring them in
[1:03:30] right to the promised land because
[1:03:32] brother man said Redemption is not a
[1:03:33] one-step process it's three
[1:03:35] justification sanctification and then
[1:03:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost well Moses
[1:03:39] only got to two of them he wasn't able
[1:03:42] to finish his commission say it like
[1:03:44] that but oh yeah oh brother said this
[1:03:46] too but because God is so gracious amen
[1:03:50] hallelujah 1500 years he said God was so
[1:03:53] gracious to Moses God let Moses back in
[1:03:56] the promised land when Moses met Jesus
[1:03:59] on Mount
[1:04:00] Transfiguration hallelujah amen Glory
[1:04:04] Hallelujah that's the grace of God God
[1:04:07] had given him the commission to take him
[1:04:08] in but because he glorified himself
[1:04:11] exalted himself made himself the big
[1:04:13] shot name called upset with the people
[1:04:17] spoke the wrong thing God didn't let him
[1:04:19] see it in his we'd say his his first
[1:04:22] life so he see it in the the next
[1:04:26] one striking is that
[1:04:31] striking
[1:04:33] 521 you have heard it that it was said
[1:04:36] by them of old time Thou shalt not kill
[1:04:37] and whosoever shall kill shall be in
[1:04:39] danger of the Judgment but I say to you
[1:04:41] that what's whosoever is angry with his
[1:04:42] brother without a call should be in
[1:04:44] danger of the judgment and whosoever
[1:04:46] shall say to his brother Rocka shall be
[1:04:47] iner of the council but whosoever shall
[1:04:50] say thou fool be in danger of
[1:04:52] Hellfire so Jesus said just by calling
[1:04:54] people fooling names you can be a danger
[1:04:57] of going to
[1:04:58] hell praise
[1:05:00] God Rocka means you empty-headed you
[1:05:03] senseless person so if you call someone
[1:05:06] you senseless you empty head or
[1:05:08] knucklehead or whatever he said you're
[1:05:10] in danger of going to a counsil of men
[1:05:12] like cor but when he says when you say
[1:05:15] fool now fool means a Godless person
[1:05:19] right it's like calling somebody a devil
[1:05:22] you have no God in you you
[1:05:24] fool for us it's like oh you they're
[1:05:27] just serpent see they're just they're
[1:05:28] lost and they're a wasted cause and
[1:05:30] everything like that Jesus said you're
[1:05:32] in danger of Hellfire when you start
[1:05:34] calling people
[1:05:35] that remember the Bible said God is not
[1:05:38] far from each one of us it says that in
[1:05:39] act 17 in him we live and move and have
[1:05:42] our being and he be not far from each
[1:05:45] one of
[1:05:46] us why because brother BR said he's
[1:05:48] trying to press in and trying to press
[1:05:49] into our lives because he wants to save
[1:05:51] people God would that all men be saved
[1:05:53] how know that's the scripture his love
[1:05:56] is so great his compassion is so great
[1:05:58] he trying to get into people's lives
[1:06:00] he's tearing amen as we heard this
[1:06:02] morning he's
[1:06:05] waiting my what a what a what a thought
[1:06:08] do you like that thought tonight amen
[1:06:11] let's go one more Matthew 12 we'll close
[1:06:13] after this by God's grace I told you I'm
[1:06:14] G to try to keep it
[1:06:20] shorter Matthew
[1:06:23] 1236
[1:06:25] and also I want to say this too I need
[1:06:26] to email the brother so I'll try to do
[1:06:27] that right afterwards in the past we've
[1:06:29] had we've had sister
[1:06:31] services this is before uh the RS came
[1:06:34] so this is probably like in 2008 to
[1:06:38] 2012 and uh you before we read this what
[1:06:42] happened at sister Services I would I
[1:06:44] would pray and I invite an elderly
[1:06:45] sister and give a testimony I think we
[1:06:47] we might did that one time yeah over
[1:06:49] there
[1:06:51] um so for example I called sister Brooks
[1:06:54] from Iowa brother Brooks brought her and
[1:06:55] then she
[1:07:09] brought and had his wife uh sister SAS I
[1:07:12] can't first name I just said it
[1:07:15] yesterday Alice and Alice gave a
[1:07:18] wonderful testimony to the sisters and
[1:07:20] she said she was so refreshed after that
[1:07:22] and so forth it was really great time in
[1:07:24] the Lord but now um another brother does
[1:07:28] sister meetings and they and they have
[1:07:30] all sisters come and preach I'm all
[1:07:33] these sisters come to meeting and they
[1:07:34] have a brother preach to them like it's
[1:07:36] happening in a few weeks um over there
[1:07:38] in Pennsylvania at a church so I I'll
[1:07:41] email the brothers and ask them about
[1:07:43] that if the brothers and the reason
[1:07:45] behind it is to refresh the sisters like
[1:07:48] my wife watching the kids all the time
[1:07:50] it might be nice for her to just have a
[1:07:51] whole service and sit in there and hear
[1:07:53] the word of God God so I'd have to watch
[1:07:54] the six kids you know I call like a
[1:07:57] Godly Man to come preach to the sisters
[1:07:58] or something like that um so that's some
[1:08:02] that's a thought I had by God's grace so
[1:08:04] and also uh in PM Services we've done
[1:08:06] children Bible studies in the past
[1:08:08] remember when we had all the children
[1:08:08] sit up front um and really kind of focus
[1:08:11] our teaching right to them so I want to
[1:08:14] pray about that too because I really
[1:08:15] want to I really want to make the most
[1:08:17] of this time that we have on Sunday
[1:08:18] nights uh to kind of minister to
[1:08:20] different needs in the church you know
[1:08:22] so I know I know Lydia would love to sit
[1:08:24] by Sarah you know and Mali love to sit
[1:08:27] up here some of little boys come you
[1:08:30] know so those are two things I want to
[1:08:32] mention and I'll email you about that by
[1:08:34] God's
[1:08:35] grace I want to make sure I mention
[1:08:37] those before we finish Matthew 12:36
[1:08:40] praise God let's say praise the Lord
[1:08:42] ready praise the Lord okay 36 and 37 but
[1:08:45] I say unto you that Every Idle word that
[1:08:47] men shall speak they shall give account
[1:08:49] thereof in the day of
[1:08:52] judgment for by Thy Word words Thou
[1:08:54] shalt be justified and by thy words Thou
[1:08:57] shalt be
[1:08:59] condemned
[1:09:03] amen so it's important what we say right
[1:09:06] let's stand to our feet here by God's
[1:09:07] grace it's important what we call
[1:09:11] people it's important uh how we
[1:09:13] stereotype
[1:09:15] right it's good not to
[1:09:18] stereotype
[1:09:20] rightless you stereotype the bride and
[1:09:22] say oh she's all wased the blood they're
[1:09:25] all a bunch of Blood Washed Christians
[1:09:26] am Glory that's true that's one
[1:09:30] stereotype that'll work amen but is it a
[1:09:32] serious thing church it's very very
[1:09:36] important God showed a prophet you don't
[1:09:39] call names we don't stereotype people
[1:09:42] together we don't make fun of white
[1:09:44] people we don't make fun of black people
[1:09:45] we don't make fun of Asian people we
[1:09:47] don't make stereotypes like that we
[1:09:49] honor all God's people praise the Lord
[1:09:53] and now looking at churches we honor all
[1:09:56] churches not I'm I'm not talking about
[1:09:58] satanic churches we honor all Christian
[1:10:00] churches we should give honor and
[1:10:02] respect and not try to lump them
[1:10:05] together do we have to preach against
[1:10:06] their sin absolutely they're false
[1:10:09] Doctrine absolutely but to name call and
[1:10:12] call them when we start calling names
[1:10:14] and criticizing and we get the wrong
[1:10:17] spirit and so I want to share that too I
[1:10:19] feel like sometimes I get the wrong
[1:10:21] spirit I
[1:10:22] feel I feel upset with people in the
[1:10:25] church if they don't you know come to
[1:10:26] church and serve God like they ought to
[1:10:28] and that's wrong with me and it'll slip
[1:10:31] out when I'm preaching and I don't like
[1:10:33] that it slipped out when brother Brandon
[1:10:35] was preaching when he had he called
[1:10:38] names um and I might not call names but
[1:10:41] I get I just kind of get up upset so
[1:10:44] please pray for me let's bow our heads
[1:10:46] and in this prayer if you pray for me
[1:10:48] and I'll pray for you that you don't
[1:10:50] that that we uh call people the right
[1:10:52] things let's have hope for people praise
[1:10:55] God let's have patience with people
[1:10:57] let's give them time you know let's give
[1:10:59] God some time to work with them let's
[1:11:01] not try to stereotype and group all
[1:11:03] people together act like we're the judge
[1:11:05] or something like
[1:11:06] that let's pray
[1:11:09] here father we thank you Lord for your
[1:11:11] grace tonight we thank you for this word
[1:11:13] that we've
[1:11:16] heard father I thought it was so
[1:11:18] important after last weekend Lord and
[1:11:20] brother bang and I sitting there um and
[1:11:23] then hearing that this week Lord hearing
[1:11:25] your Prophet say these
[1:11:27] things and knowing in my heart that I
[1:11:29] battle complexes and Lord as your
[1:11:31] Prophet said we we all battle them we
[1:11:34] want to be free from complexes but as we
[1:11:37] even heard sometimes they'll try to come
[1:11:41] back as we saw with the prophet saying
[1:11:45] Ricky and Retta again after the the
[1:11:47] sermon standing in the
[1:11:51] Gap Lord uh I I want to say that this
[1:11:54] message really gives me a lot
[1:11:57] of awareness of your
[1:12:00] grace you're able to be gracious you
[1:12:02] were gracious to Moses amen you still
[1:12:05] let him come in the promised land you
[1:12:07] were gracious to brother
[1:12:10] brandom and even told him he had a great
[1:12:12] portion of Heaven that awaited him yet
[1:12:14] he struggled with criticism and name
[1:12:18] calling and Lord in my heart I struggle
[1:12:21] with hurt feelings and I've built up
[1:12:24] complexes in the
[1:12:26] past God I need you to help me Lord
[1:12:29] Jesus I felt so good today I feel like
[1:12:32] you gave me victory over the last few
[1:12:33] days but I'm praying for future Lord God
[1:12:37] praying for the future that I would not
[1:12:39] fall back into this again I wouldn't
[1:12:41] take it
[1:12:42] personal but I'd be able to love Lord if
[1:12:45] I have a question reach out and ask the
[1:12:47] individual Lord God if I'm wondering
[1:12:49] something I need to talk to about it
[1:12:51] with
[1:12:52] somebody
[1:12:54] help me not to speak unadvisedly with
[1:12:56] with my lips Lord if someone tries to
[1:12:58] provoke people in the church or us on
[1:13:01] the job or whatever help us to respond
[1:13:03] with the right words
[1:13:06] Lord with the spirit of love a soft
[1:13:09] answer turneth away wrath

[1:13:16] us pray for those who despitefully use
[1:13:18] us and speak Evil all all evil manner
[1:13:21] against us Lord God that we might be the
[1:13:24] children of God for God lets the sunrise

[1:13:36] be Children of the highest the most high
[1:13:41] god thank you for this message Lord it
[1:13:44] even reminds me as I pray it reminds me
[1:13:46] even of racism Lord it reminds me of
[1:13:48] anyone that would look down upon other
[1:13:50] people
[1:13:51] Lord with a prideful heess oh God help
[1:13:54] us never to have that dear
[1:13:57] God I've been so thankful Lord my life
[1:13:59] my parents were never racist and I never
[1:14:01] had to really battle that I love people
[1:14:04] of all skin color Lord all backgrounds
[1:14:06] and they have so much to offer the the
[1:14:09] body of Christ there's so much to give
[1:14:10] to the body of
[1:14:14] Christ even racist or even sexist Lord
[1:14:18] Brother brandom said women have such an
[1:14:19] easier way of letting go and getting in
[1:14:21] the spirit and than men and even about
[1:14:26] African-Americans brother BR said
[1:14:27] they're so much more gifted than the
[1:14:29] white man Lord in different ways we all
[1:14:31] have different giftings and abilities
[1:14:34] Lord help us to never have any critical
[1:14:39] spirit I just pray let our words be full
[1:14:42] of

[1:15:09] on my heart I just felt like I had to
[1:15:11] deliver it tonight dear God it's so
[1:15:13] important too to see that that Moses
[1:15:16] what he lost because he let people put
[1:15:19] him in the wrong
[1:15:21] Spirit instead of having rued over his
[1:15:23] own
